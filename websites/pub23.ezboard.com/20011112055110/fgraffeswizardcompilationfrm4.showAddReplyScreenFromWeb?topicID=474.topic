<br>
&lt;&lt; <br>
Wizards have been saying forever &quot;we need to do more damage&quot;. I've always just scoffed at that, considering us a tad weak in damage, but fine overall. Now, I firmly believe wizards should get a damage upgrade. Nothing massive. 50% would get us killed, and quickly. 10% would be a good test starting point. Tweak it from there.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Are you serious?  Let's take a look.<br>
<br>
med + c2 = 27 + 11 = 38/tick = 6.333 / sec<br>
Draught of Ice dmg/mana = 3.4 which gives us a sustained, long term damage output of 21.<br>
<br>
Let's look at that again: 21 dmg/sec, average, long term.<br>
<br>
Yes, I know about PotG.  You are never getting PotG in an XP grind because lev 60 druids don't go to XP grind groups.  And if they did, they could snare and evac, so who needs a wizard?  Nor are you going to get a bard.  You are going to get clarity 2, and that is all.  Yes, I know about the super knifty 3/tick regen on the epic.  Feel free to adjust my numbers if you have to include that, since it doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
Wizards gave up everything but ports to be damage dealers.  No AC, no HP, no defense, no pets.<br>
<br>
Warriors.  You remember warriors?  The ones who were supposed to absorb damage, not deal it.  The ones who have 1200+ AC?  The ones who have 4000+ HP?  They average around 50 dmg/sec.  They have twice your AC, almost 3 times your HP, and 2.5 times your damage dealing capacity.  They can take damage.  And a single cheal puts them right back to 100% effective.<br>
<br>
2.5 times your damage dealing isn't &quot;a tweak&quot;.  It isn't &quot;balance&quot;.  It's a totally fubared situation.  They could crank your spell costs to a third of what they are now, and you would still be arguably underpowered, because now you are merely doing the same damage as a warrior, but you can't tank.  You don't have the hit points and AC to protect the cleric and chanter.<br>
<br>
Moving right along.  Let's get to rogues.  Rogues are also supposed to be pure damage dealers.  That is all they bring to the table: backstab.  Some of the better rogues are starting to creep to the 120dmg/sec range.<br>
Regardless, a lot of rogues are sitting firmly in the 90 - 100 dmg/sec range.  They get hide and sneak, which aren't useful all the time but irreplacable when needed.<br>
<br>
So explain to me what a wizard has that is so great that it justifies a 5x dmg reduction compared to rogues?  Explain to me how a 10% jump will help a class doing 1/5th the dmg of another class?  Flowing Thought II isn't going to help.  At this point, Flowing Though 160 is what it's going to take.<br>
<br>
Five times your damage, boys and girls.  Or, hell, call my numbers wrong and bump it down to rogues only do 80dmg/sec.  Now they only outdamage you by a factor of 4.  Why does a warrior with 1300AC get to do 3 times yor damage?  Or a monk?  Slightly more damage?  Sure, I could live with that.  Over a span of more that about 15 mins, they get to outdamage you by a factor of anywhere from 3 to 5 times.  Is that what you call balance?  Is that what flowing thought II is going to fix?<br>
<br>
You know why you sit at the zone line LFG forever?  Because wizards are damn close to useless.  Waiting for a rogue or monk is always the right thing to do.  It isn't a perception issue.  Showing what our spells hit for isn't going to help.  Practicing ghetto root crowd control isn't going to change anything.  You do 1/5th the damage of a rogue, and nothing you can do will change that.  You do a third the damage of a warrior, who can tank, and taunt, and no amount of skill on your part is going to make you more useful.<br>
<br>
Banes are great.  Banes are keen.  Banes allow you to open up cans of whup ass unseen in this game.  Banes have made some fights possible.<br>
<br>
Banes don't help for the 60 levels you have to work your way up.  Banes don't help if you don't feel like joining a vulak raiding guild and just want to hit Vox and take a few years to get to lev 60.<br>
<br>
We have tricks.  We can get to 60 by other means if we want to.  After BoF and jboots, we are the best soloers around.  But it's boring as shit.  It's what we have to do though, because we aren't just a little inferior to melee in sustained damage, we are ages behind. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamadhibots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samadhi BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Sorcerer</font></td></tr></table></span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/24/01 1:47:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Melee dmg v caster dmg.</span><hr size=1> Moved this to Rants.

<br>
1. you can't regen 6.333 mana/ sec when you are standing up casting. To acheive long term 21 dps you have to be chain casting. The situation you have presented isn't even possible.<br>
<br>
2. even if you could regen 6.333 mana/sec while casting, you would be death before you could get your 3rd spell off. I don't know wany tank that can out taunt me chain casting from the start of a fight.<br>
<br>
This comparison is invalid because you are comparing 2 completely different things. Your job is not to pump out constant damage - its to tank large chunks in a short amount of time.<br>
<br>
Think about what you have posted here - if I had the kind of mana regen you are talking about or the kind of damage you are claiming to want, we could solo any &lt;32khp mob in the game! Solo in fear would be no problem. I think 10% is about right. What you want is to be a god and pretty unreasonable if you think about it for a minute. Flowing though 160?

<br>
Warriors are supposed to suck up damage and they lose... the ability to cast... which means... they don't fizzle... they don't get resisted (no mobs have the kind of defense that would cause a warrior to get &quot;resisted&quot; as much as our normal stuff), they can attack forever... =P<br>
<br>
The only thing we have better than wars are gates / evacs, uhm... true north, lev, inviz. All handy stuff all in all. But they can just snap their fingers on a raid and get it, and in the end, raids are all that really matters for class strength.<br>

This arguement will never fly - for every comparison of melee v. spell damage that presnet a case in favor of one type of damage, you can come up with another the shows the exact opposite. I can come up with dozens of scenarios where a wizard FAR outdamages melees in exp grind and raids. <p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: arial"><b>Wandor Kilbringer<br>Evoker of the 57th Conclave<br>Vini, Vidi, Nuki</b></span><br>

<br>
It would help if you quoted the rest, or did you even read it?  I'm talking about (and exampled) a 10% increase in base damage to ALL DD spells we have.  Not a 10% overall increase.  10% overall would be a joke.<br>
<br>
As for your damage output - are you insane?  Chain casting to hit that magic number of yours would equal:<br>
<br>
1 - dead wizard.<br>
2 - hated wizard.<br>
3 - never invited to anything ever again wizard.<br>
<br>
Also, LFG for 4 hours?  That's not limited to wizards.  I've seen every class stuck like that before (not all at once, of course).  I've been LFG for an eternity before myself.  I've also been invited to THREE seperate groups within seconds of /shout'ing.  Getting groups is part luck in timing, and part having friends all over the place.  The first one can't be improved (much), but the second one can.  Try it.  You'll be amazed. <p><BR><BR>

Ok, FT160?  You're saying this wouldn't help?  FT 160 means I could get back mana for a full nuke in 2 ticks...STANDING!<br>
<br>
Second, as stated, our job is to do damage in chunks.  And why do you want to do more dmg than a warrior?  That would mean the mob is on you instead of him, and I dont know about you- but I have a hard ass time keeping the mob off of me as it is.<br>
<br>
Third, NOBODY does damage like I do and NOBODY taunts like I can.  I can pick a mob and say &quot;Cleric ready?  Taunter ready?&quot; then go from full mana to zero.  That mob will be dead and that exp will be mine. Simple.  Sure, if a rogue's been stabbing at it for 30sec im not gonna get the kill- but hey, he's just doing his job as a damage dealer too.<br>
<br>
Does this mean that I think we're fine?  Hell no.  I want some tweeks just like everyone else.  I may only take chunks out, but I want them to be large chucks when I do!<br>
<br>
My only problem with the rogue as a damage dealer is Evade.  When they aggro they (A)Turn off attack[already reducing aggro] (B) push a button[though it has a skill check].  When we aggro we have to cast a spell that (A) Costs mana[just a tad] (B)Has to channel THROUGH the mobs beatings[HA!] (C)Has a casting time (D)Has to go trough a resistance check[though some reports say it works even when resisted] (E)We had to go through a bunk-ass quest to get where they just have to turn level 6 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uyain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>yain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/25/01 6:57:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ROFL</span><hr size=1> Go to ToV and see how usefull a wizard is.<br>
 You can do a full burn and not even see the hp move on a mob. Only in the lower parts of the game can a wiz nuke a mob down.<br>
Wizards have been under powerd since the first expasion and it only got worse with the second expasion.<br>
 Verant seames to think if they up the wizs nukes. All the wizards are going to run back to the old world and own the mobs.<br>

ToV mobs do have a lot of HP, but we are most certainly NOT useless.  Last HoT raid I did, they were paying attention to wizard mana counts.  Everyone knew we (there were 4 wizards) would be the ones to make mobs die, and die fast. <p><BR><BR>

<br>
A Tank hits for max 100 dmg with his weapon.<br>
He hits like once every 2 seconds.<br>
A miss is a fizzle.<br>
A hit for less then 100 dmg is a partial resist.<br>
He can keep swinging until out of stamina, which is about 6 minutes.<br>
He is full stamina again in 30 seconds.<br>
He is always One Cleric heal + 10 secs away from full health.<br>
<br>
To compare:<br>
<br>
A wizard needs to do 50 dmg / second<br>
Has to be able to do that during a period of 6 minutes<br>
Needs a regain time of 30 seconds total in those 3 minutes<br>
Must be 1 cast + 10 seconds away from full capacity again.<br>
<br>
Draught of fire: 643 dmg in 3 sec + 2.5 sec regain.<br>
28 casts of Draught will do about the same dmg in 6 minutes as the Tank.<br>
28 draughts can be cast in 154 seconds (2.5 minutes)<br>
<br>
So I should have 4 minutes 1 cast and 10 seconds left to be at full capacity again.<br>
<br>
This means that there should be a way to:<br>
<br>
1. have mana to cast 28 draughts. (I can cast max 14 with a little luck (specialize skill kicking in))<br>
2. regain that mana within 4 minutes with the help of another class, that can regain the used mana therefore in the 6.5 mins<br>
3. Do this all standing.<br>

<br>
A tank missing is a full resist, not a fizzle.<br>
A tank hitting for under max damage is a partial resist.<br>
A fizzle is an extra penalty casters have that tanks don't.<br>
<br>
This was stated above.  But since another example was given, I thought I'd toss it out there again.<br>

I have a warrior friend who soloed in velks to 58. However toss in rains for dmg/mana. <br>
As for cc. I have been invited to Kael arena groups purely for that facility. A good wizard with epic can be far better than a chanter anyday in situation where mobs cannot be mezzed. A charmed giant is good til charm breaks. Fetter or kiting [for healers] is far more reliable then dictate. Using rains and watching aggro I have solo gotten exp in kael arena against 3 full groups including rogues, monks, warriors, sk's, necros, I  was still at 40% too. <br>
Our job is not to do constant damage. Yes we need a damage upgrade, there is no reason a rog can do so much more than us dmg. However we are still very useful. We can ghetto cc, evac, and blast the crap out of anything better than any other class in the game. And btw banes are worth it.<br>

After reading the posters original message a couple times.....<br>
<br>
I really see genuine information offered. <br>
<br>
I'm not seeing a reason why this thread is in rants?????<br>
<br>
I know you dont agree with what is being said. I also know that the thread covers ground already covered. However, I've seen alot of topics covered and revisited in the General area. <br>
<br>
What gives?  <br>
<br>
Why are threads that deal with melee vs caster damage and class balance discussion relegated to an area where fewer info-seekers are likely to read?<br>

(reprise for my fans)</span><hr size=1> Dear Wandor K.  You must be another fine product of Mississippi public schools.  If this were any board save rant, I wouldn't dignify you with a reply:<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; lets see where the flaws are in this -<br>
<br>
1. you can't regen 6.333 mana/ sec when you are standing up casting. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
No, you can't regen 6.33 mana/sec, because you miss a few ticks while casting.  You regen slightly less.  I could have figured it out, but<br>
a) since wiz are dead last in long term damage, I figured quibbling about a few ticks of med mana lost to be rounding error.<br>
b) You are obviously incapable of handling the 3 line equation.  Any attempt to take casting med ticks into account would fly so far over your head it would be like a midget ant watching a satelite.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; To acheive long term 21 dps you have to be chain casting. The situation you have presented isn't even possible.<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
No, to acheive long term 21dps is to sit and med and stad up every so often and cast a nuke.  Oh, and not ever fizzle or have partial resists.  If you chain cast, genius, you achieve some very spectacular short term dps.  Then you have to med, which brings it back down.<br>
<br>
Don't take my word for it, and don't try to do math on your own: log it.  Log a long (long being anything over half an hour) Seb or Karnor or whatever 6 man group, with clarity, of the mez/single target variety.  I am willing to bet you any stakes you want that your average dps, barring bard or potg, but including C2, will be 20dmg or less for every second logged.<br>
<br>
You have my personal guarentee.  My psychic friend told me it would be so.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; This comparison is invalid because you are comparing 2 completely different things. Your job is not to pump out constant damage - its to tank large chunks in a short amount of time.<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
No, my job is to do damage.  And huge volumes of consistent damage is far better than small amounts of fast damage.  Every single time.  Furthermore, for a class with no AC, defense, hit points, and the fewest amount of combat util spells to also do the least amount of long term damage is ridiculous.  Justify it all you want.  Check my math with logs all you want.<br>
<br>
Rogues: 90-120 dps, long term<br>
Wizards: 21 dps, long term, max<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Think about what you have posted here - if I had the kind of mana regen you are talking about or the kind of damage you are claiming to want, we could solo any &lt;32khp mob in the game!<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
No.  We would still run out of mana and be left with a live and angry mob in the exact same number of casts as we do now.  See, I am not asking for a bigger mana pool, I am asking for faster mana regen.  Or more efficient spells.  It's the only way to make our average dps go up.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Second, as stated, our job is to do damage in chunks. And why do you want to do more dmg than a warrior? <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Oh, I dunno.  Maybe it's because if a warrior can do more damage than a wizard, and a warrior can take more damage than a wizard, and a warrior can tank better than a wizard, that would mean that a warrior is better at every single aspect of combat, as compared to a wizard, and therefore there is no place for wizards in XP grinds.  Other than that, no, I guess I see no reason to want to do more damage than a warrior.  You know, playing a damage dealing class and all...<br>
<br>
I am pretty certain that Verant can fix any aggro problem they create by upgunning wizards.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;This arguement will never fly - for every comparison of melee v. spell damage that presnet a case in favor of one type of damage, you can come up with another the shows the exact opposite. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
OK, first and foremost, forget raids.  Wizards are great in raids.  Wizards shine in raids.  Wonderous, great.  We are discussing XP grinds.  You know, those first 59 levels before you get Porlos?  That trivial little period?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
I can come up with dozens of scenarios where a wizard FAR outdamages melees in exp grind. <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
OK.  Go.  Give me &quot;dozens&quot; of scenarios where, in a half hour, a wiz outdamages a melee.  Humor me and make it realistic, please. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uburrowowlx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>burrowowlx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/30/01 8:56:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> More ranting!</span><hr size=1> What can I say, it's a no eq day for me  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Time for more math!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, FT160? You're saying this wouldn't help? FT 160 means I could get back mana for a full nuke in 2 ticks...STANDING!<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Not two ticks.  1.25 ticks.  Or 7.5 seconds, with C2, standing.  Which would put your draught of ice nuking damage at 96/sec.<br>
<br>
Because a 731 dmg draught of ice every 7.5 seconds averages to 96 dmg/second.<br>
<br>
Which is still less than rogues.  QEMFD.<br>
<br>
Lemme repeat myself: Even with my &quot;ridiculous&quot; FT160, which would allow you to regen one nukes worth of mana in 1 and a quarter tick, you would be doing less damage than a rogue with a ragebringer (commonly referred to as &quot;freebringer&quot; for how easy it is to come by) and another decent weapon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4>Rant Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
