<br>
Quest Information / Dialogue:<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:24:34 2001] You say, 'Hail, Trade Commissioner Henry'<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:24:34 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Hello there, traveler. I don't believe that I have seen you around these parts before- then again, I could have and simply forgotten since there have been so many new faces around here. However, if you are a newcomer to Shadowhaven, please make sure that you [register for trading] in the Haven. Registering with the Traders of the Haven will legitimize you in the eyes of local merchants and customers. <br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:24:42 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Hello there, traveler. I don't believe that I have seen you around these parts before- then again, I could have and simply forgotten since there have been so many new faces around here. However, if you are a newcomer to Shadowhaven, please make sure that you [register for trading] in the Haven. Registering with the Traders of the Haven will legitimize you in the eyes of local merchants and customers. <br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:24:46 2001] You say, 'How to I register for trading?'<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:24:46 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'It's great that you are interested Vespid, you will surely be glad you did. I have some simple deliveries that I need completed if you wish to be a registered trader in Shadowhaven. <br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:24:54 2001] You say, 'What deliveries?'<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:24:54 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'The deliveries are simple enough, I just need you to bring some letters to some merchants of the Haven that are currently working in other locations. Will you [deliver these letters]? <br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:25:04 2001] You say, 'I will deliver these letters'<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:25:04 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'I surely do appreciate the help, Vespid- clearly you understand the value of solid relations with the locals. First, I will need you to take this newsletter to Sateal. He is currently on assignment in the Bazaar and has been out of the loop on the happenings of Shadowhaven because of his heavy workload. Bring this to him and then return to me with his sales report. I look forward to seeing you soon. <br>
<br>
Sateal can be found on the outside wall of the bazaar<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:28:53 2001] Sateal Deirosap says 'Ah great, I have been meaning to go and pick one of these up from the Trade Commissioner but I have been very busy with my work. Im sure Henry has been waiting for my sales report so here it is. Please return it to him for me if you could and thanks again! <br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:28:53 2001] You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Back to Henry<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:31:39 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Great to see you back so soon Vespid, you looked like a dependable person from the start. The next thing I need you to do is a bit more dangerous, but by the looks of you I doubt it will be a problem. Go to the Shadowhaven outpost in Fungusgrove and give Thar this book. Thar is a great merchant but I have seen his sales steadily declining, so I figured this book full of selling tips will help him regain his confidence and help him produce the kinds of numbers I know he is capable of. If his economy report is ready please, bring that back to me when you return. <br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 18:31:39 2001] You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Now travel to Fungus Grove, which can be reached by going through the Echo Caverns. Hand the book to NPC Thar (loc needed)<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] Thar Anton says 'I see you have brought a book from the Commissioner. Well I'm not much for reading but I will surely try anything that may increase my sales. Anyways I'm sure you arent that interested in how bad my sales are and would like to be on your way so here you go. <br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] Your faction standing with Traders of the Haven got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] Your faction standing with House of Fordel got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] Your faction standing with House of Midst got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] Your faction standing with House of Stout got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] You gain party experience!!<br>
<br>
Now go BACK to Shadow Haven and turn in the Report to Henry. (NOTE: You cannot bind in Fungus Grove.)<br>
<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:50 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Excellent work Vespid, I knew that you were someone that I could trust to get the job done. The trader's union of Shadowhaven will hear of your solid work ethic. Perhaps a courier job is in your future, I couldn't have expected anyone to make these deliveries as fast as you did! Please take this amulet as a symbol of your dedication to Shadowhaven's booming economy. While wearing this you are sure to get all the greatest deals from the merchants of the Haven both here and in the bazaar. It was a pleasure meeting, you and thanks for all of your help. <br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:50 2001] Your faction standing with Traders of the Haven got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:50 2001] Your faction standing with House of Fordel got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:51 2001] Your faction standing with House of Midst got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:51 2001] Your faction standing with House of Stout got better.<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:51 2001] You gain party experience!!<br>
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:55 2001] Vespid saved.<br>
<br>
The item you recieve give you sufficient faction to buy/sell in Shadow Haven when worn.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Quest Name: Beriol's Research Delivery<br>
Quest Giver: Beriol Talorakoir<br>
Quest Zone: Shadow Haven and Katta Castellum<br>
Quest Level: unknown<br>
Quest Information / Dialogue:<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Beriol Talorakoir'<br>
<br>
Beriol Talorakoir says 'Hail Jarnin. And good day to you. What brings you to my quarters today? Do you wish to learn more about the [magic] that we study in our hallowed section of the Shadowhaven? <br>
<br>
You say, 'what magic?'<br>
<br>
Beriol Talorakoir says 'It's always a pleasure to meet someone that shows interest in the magic that we practice here. Our magic studies consist mostly of teleportation and the arts of elemental mastery. I'm actually conducting a study now, but I'm missing a few [books]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what books?'<br>
<br>
Beriol Talorakoir says 'Well, I have an old student that is now serving as an advisor to one of the most respected residents of Katta Castelleum. He has some specific books that I need to further my research, but I cannot take the time to travel so far away from my home to retrieve them. I seek out one who will [bring my research] to me from Dersino.<br>
<br>
You say, 'I will bring my research'<br>
<br>
Beriol Talorakoir says 'You are exactly the one I am looking for. After presenting this seal to Dersino, inform him that you wish to take the research and I am sure that he will know I have sent you. I look forward to seeing you soon.<br>
<br>
He gave me a coin labeled 'Seal of Beriol', so off to Katta Castellum I went. Never found Dersino, but I think I found the &quot;respected resident of Katta Castelleum&quot;. His name is Nathyn Illuminious. He was dubious, as were most of the residents of Katta. Will update this when I find more out.<br>
<br>
**EDIT**<br>
<br>
Finished this quest tonight with invis. Got faction! I got another seal while maxin' out shadowhaven merchant faction. plan on turning them in until I can do some Katta Quests.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quest Name: Grimling Raid<br>
Quest Giver: Scout Derrin <br>
Quest Zone: Grimling Forest in the Vah Shir outpost<br>
Quest Level: unknown<br>
Quest Information / Dialogue:<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Scout Derrin.'<br>
<br>
Scout Derrin says 'Greetings Jarnin, what brings you to the battlegrounds? Looking to raid a grimling camp perhaps?<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am looking to raid a grimling camp'<br>
<br>
Scout Derrin says 'I can lead a dozen men of my strength on a raid against a well fortified grimling encampment. It's a risky mission, but one that has the potential to yield substantial rewards. If you have the manpower and the courage, give me a glowing acrylia sphere and we'll get started.<br>
<br>
Glowing Acrylia spheres are sold by a merchant right in the same camp. They cost 113pp, and since I didn't have the money or the &quot;manpower&quot;, I kept looking around. Oh, there is also a bank in this camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quest Name: Grimling Traitor<br>
Quest Giver: an imprisoned grimling<br>
Quest Zone: Grimling Forest<br>
Quest Level: unknown<br>
<br>
Quest Information / Dialogue:<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, an imprisoned grimling'<br>
<br>
an imprisoned grimling looks up at you through wild eyes, 'You help me, I tell you things! I no lie! You not kill me. I beg. Things I know, you will see.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'how many I help you?'<br>
<br>
an imprisoned grimling says 'Big catman in jail we have. I got key. I give you key and you not kill me. I beg!<br>
<br>
You say, 'Give me the key'<br>
<br>
You get a key, which I destroyed because the grimling mines (Where I figure the Catman is) wasn't on my agenda tonight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, I also picked up some no-drop items that were kinda weird.<br>
<br>
Zone: Tenebrous Mountains<br>
Item: Grimling Runner Pouch<br>
Item looted from: a grimling runner<br>
Faction: - Grimlings of the Moor<br>
<br>
I figure this is a Vah Shir lowbie quest. The runner was low green, and it was dead with only one DoF.<br>
<br>
**EDIT**<br>
<br>
I was able to have someone invis me for the hanging in of the Grimling runner pack. I got some faction, and a relic(?) pack pattern. I'm still dubious, so he wouldn't say what the stuff was to make the pack.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zone: Katta Castellum<br>
Item: Glyphed Skin Samples -slot/side-<br>
Item looted from: Various undead traps in the graveyard.<br>
Faction: none.<br>
<br>
This is still way unsolved. There are ten pieces in all that I've found. Been getting dupes since I got the tenth. They're all no-drop and lore. They identify as &quot;Writing on skin&quot; or some such.<br>
When you kill the various undead traps (yes, I said traps) they drop a random sample always. They're probably between 35 and 45. The skeletons were Blue to me, while the zombies were &quot;blue lite&quot; and green.<br>
<br>
If you go inside the building there is a halfling and about 6 gargs that conned Blue at 54. I'm thinking level 50 for some reason. Anyway, hail the peck, erm... Halfling, and he replies like so:<br>
<br>
<br>
Ruulzu says, 'Hail, Yurddle the Caretaker'<br>
<br>
Yurddle the Caretaker says 'Greetings stranger. It's nice to have visitors of the living sort. Seems like my work here is never done. When I'm not having to dig fresh graves and keep the mausoleum clean I'm having to refill old graves that have been dug up by the [restless dead] or them disrespectful [grave robbers]!<br>
<br>
Ruulzu says, 'what restless dead'<br>
<br>
Yurddle the Caretaker says 'That's right. We've got our fair share of undead lurking around our fine city. Most of the sorry souls aren't as troublesome as the vampyres and we've even got a few [friendly spirits] right here in this very mausoleum.<br>
<br>
Ruulzu says, 'what friendly spirits'<br>
<br>
Yurddle the Caretaker says 'Every so often when Norrath is near its zenith a group of spirits gathers at the podium and chairs over there. Seems they were some of the original Loyalists that arrived here on Luclin and helped build our great city of Katta Castellum. Their bodies are at rest in the stone crypts along these mausoleum walls and guarded by the [gargoyle warders]. Yet even in death their spirits convene to discuss the condition of Katta Castellum and the teachings of Tsaph Katta.<br>
<br>
Ruulzu says, 'what gargoyle warders'<br>
<br>
Yurddle the Caretaker says 'The gargoyles that guard the residents of this mausoleum are quite fascinating. They were carved late in the construction of Katta Castellum by a very talented dwarven stone worker, Gundle Chislebeard. Gundle used a type of stone found in the very cliffs Katta Castellum is built upon. At first the gargoyles were nothing more than impressive statues but then over time they began to [change].<br>
<br>
Ruulzu says, 'how change?'<br>
<br>
Yurddle the Caretaker says 'I noticed the eyes of the gargoyles developed a slight glow to them, then they began to shift every so often. The movements were so slight that I probably would not have noticed had I not been working near them every day. Then one night a group of robbers entered the mausoleum and attempted to remove the lids of several crypts. The gargoyles came to life and chased the bandits away. The common presumption is that the spirits of fallen Validus Custodus Legionnaires inhabit the stone forms and continue the duties they performed in life.<br>
<br>
Ruulzu says, 'what grave robbers'<br>
<br>
Yurddle the Caretaker says 'It is unfortunate that there are so many disrespectful people that would rob the graves of the dead. The citizens of Katta Castellum do not commit such crimes against their ancestors but thieves from Shadow Haven, greedy Vampyres, and even members of the traitorous Inquisition seeking old combine relics have been caught digging up the dead. I have [lists of belongings] that have been stolen, it would please the spirits of Katta Castellum greatly if these items are returned.<br>
<br>
Ruulzu says, 'what lists of belongings'<br>
<br>
Yurddle the Caretaker says 'Here are some lists of items that have been stolen from the crypts of the mausoleum in the past. You may bring each crypts set of four missing items to me separately. It is not necessary to find all three sets of items before returning but any set you do return must be complete to please the spirits. Perhaps you should ask around the shops in the other cities of Luclin if the merchants there have seen the missing items.<br>
<br>
The list was written in Combine Language, which I'm a master of, but the paladin that got the list didn't know the language, and the list was no-drop. She had to log shortly after, so I couldn't take this further.<br>
<br>
This last part could be part of the glyphed skin samples quest, or it could be something totally different. <br>
<br>
I'll update when i find more stuff out.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamadhibots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samadhi BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Sorcerer</font></td></tr></table></span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/6/01 8:19:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shadows of Luclin: New Quests.</span><hr size=1> Quest posted by Dartenor:<br>

[Wed Dec 05 18:31:03 2001] Daloran Glimmerblade says 'Ah that is excellent to hear Aelverin. I believe I have a task that I could entrust you with. I have numerous Gemmed sword hilts that I have yet to attach to a blade. They have all been glowing for quite some time with an [unknown force]. All of my residing magicians and enchanters have been unable to decifer the magics that surround these hilts. <br>
[Wed Dec 05 18:31:21 2001] You say, 'what unknown force?'<br>
[Wed Dec 05 18:31:21 2001] Daloran Glimmerblade says 'I wish that I was able to discover this myself. Unfortunately not one person in my quarter possesses such identification powers. However, I do have a [friend] in Katta Castellum that specializes in discovering such magical origins. <br>
[Wed Dec 05 18:31:56 2001] You say, 'who is a friend?'<br>
[Wed Dec 05 18:31:56 2001] Daloran Glimmerblade says 'Yaeorat is who I speak of, he is a very trusted and old friend of mine that is a very powerful and skillfull enchanter. Will you bring to him the [Gemmed sword hilt]? I feel that if anyone will be able to identify this it will be Yaeorat. <br>

I am currently in the middle of researching more effective magical methods of combating the [vampyres] of the Coterie of the Eternal Night.

[Wed Dec 05 21:46:58 2001] Roshawna Rhorer says 'A pleasure to speak with you Aelverin! You appear to be a foreigner to Katta Castellum as well. I hope your reasons for visiting this noble city are more leisurely than my own. In addition to my normal duties as a Shar Vahl Emissary to Katta Castellum there is the issue of the [tormented vah shir] in Tenebrous Mountains that must be dealt with. <br>
[Wed Dec 05 21:47:03 2001] Roshawna Rhorer begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Wed Dec 05 21:47:07 2001] Roshawna Rhorer feels much faster.<br>
[Wed Dec 05 21:47:16 2001] You say, 'what tormented vah shir?'<br>
[Wed Dec 05 21:47:17 2001] Roshawna Rhorer says 'Recently the skeletons of Vah Shir have been spotted wandering the Tenebrous Mountains ferociously and blindly attacking the living. There are legends among my people that speak of Vah Shir warriors that were murdered dishonorably in their sleep by a traitor allied with [dark spirits]. The spirits of these murdered warriors become trapped in their decaying mortal shells for often many years before they are driven mad by the despair, rage, and torturous experience. When this negative spirit energy becomes strong enough the corpses rise and attempt to slaughter all that crosses their path in their state of eternal rage. Spirits tormented in such a manner must be assisted so that they may finally find peace in death. Will you [help the souls] find peace? <br>
[Wed Dec 05 21:48:12 2001] You say, 'what dark spirits?'<br>
[Wed Dec 05 21:48:13 2001] Roshawna Rhorer says 'Not all spirits that can be called upon by those who are in touch with the spirit realms are of good intentions. There are spirits who seek to destroy and corrupt. These dark spirits are best avoided and kept from manifesting their influence on the mortal realms. Unfortunately the foolish or the weak willed are tempted by their promises of power. Most who deal with the dark spirits are shortly driven mad by the spirits influence or destroyed by the very powers they were promised. There are tales however of powerful shaman capable of harnessing and controlling the dark spirits and their evil powers of corruption. These wicked traitors to the Vah Shir teachings are called [Rakshasa]. <br>
[Wed Dec 05 21:48:42 2001] You say, 'what Rakshasa?'<br>
[Wed Dec 05 21:48:42 2001] Roshawna Rhorer says 'Like I said the Rakshasa are spoken of only in old tales. Whether they truly existed or not can not be proven for sure and the elder spiritist insist they are nothing more than creatures of fiction. If there truly is a Rakshasa alive today it would be a powerful creature indeed. They are said to no longer have a physical body of their own, having traded it to a powerful evil spirit so that it may enter the mortal realm in exchange for dark gifts. Because the Rakshasa no longer has a physical body of its own it must take the forms of other creatures and can not be destroyed with conventional weapons. <br>
[Wed Dec 05 21:49:20 2001] You say, 'i will help the souls '<br>
[Wed Dec 05 21:49:20 2001] Roshawna Rhorer says 'The only way for a tormented undead vah shir to be put to rest is to destroy its body and take its skull to Shar Vahl where our spiritualists can perform a ritual to cleanse and free the imprisoned spirit. Fill this chest with skulls and return it to me and I will make the preparations for it to be sent to Shar Vahl. The spiritualists there have just recently received word of the situation and will be prepared to perform the proper rituals when the time comes.<br>

There is a wonderful ore native to Luclin called [Acrylia] that has proved to be a valuable asset to my crew and I. <br>
[Wed Dec 05 22:30:26 2001] You say, 'what Acrylia?'<br>
[Wed Dec 05 22:30:26 2001] Toktonn Geerlok says 'Yes, it is a marvelous luminescent ore that when properly smelted has properties similar to the finest of steels, and sometimes even better. Depending on the purity of the ore of course. The Tenebrous Mountains are rich with very pure acrylia veins but unfortunately the Grimlings have overrun the mines and are not willing to allow others to mine the ore. Instead they horde it for their tribes to the south. I am permitted by the Validus Custodus to reward those seeking to cleanse the mines of the Grimlings.

<br>
Welp, was wandering around in Katta Castellum and guess who I found:<br>
<br>
Elnerick Augustleaf (+135, +156)<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
Drenic Garrison (+283, +30)<br>
<br>
Both responded to me fine at amiable faction. Elnerick is a High Elf. Garrison is a Human.<br>
<br>
I couldn't get Elnerick to say antying other then his normal hail response.<br>
<br>
Garrison gave me 3 quests. 1 to do with Firetree (who is also in the zone) and two others.<br>
<br>
Quests didn't sound too hard, but doubt they could be done solo. Probably 1-2 group things. <br>
<br>
My guess, the 2 level 60 nukes and level 60 familiar buff are quested here.<br>
<br>
Good luck all,  I'll post the logs later today.<br>

[Fri Dec 07 19:39:02 2001] Elnerick Augustleaf says 'Greetings Ralanorn. I am Magistrate Elnerick Augustleaf of Katta Castellum and the Loyalist Empire. If it is arcane knowledge that you seek you have come to an excellent place to study. Not only do we have wondrous magical resources available at the Magus Conlegium but the teachings of Tsaph Katta are well known to all of our citizens and aid in preparing the mind for the freedom of thought and mental and emotional discipline needed to become a great wizard. <br>

[Fri Dec 07 19:39:23 2001] Drenic Garrison says 'Greetings Ralanorn! I am Drenic Garrison, Governor of Science here in Katta Castellum. I am currently involved in several scientific endeavors with the other governors and am in need of assistance supplying my researchers with the proper [materials and samples] for their studies. <br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 07 19:39:37 2001] You say, 'Materials and samples?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 07 19:39:37 2001] Drenic Garrison says 'The Magus Conlegium are assisting with some studies on the physiology of the Vampyres of the Coterie of the Eternal Night and are in need of [ash and blood] samples. Maralicis Dilsm our Governor of Health is assisting in research on [counteragents] to the venom and diseases native to Luclin. Finally, there have been reports from the agents of Erikal Wolfeye that there is a civilization of [snake people] that live on the furthest reaches of the light side of Luclin in a region devoid of atmosphere. <br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 07 19:40:00 2001] You say, 'ash and blood?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 07 19:40:00 2001] Drenic Garrison says 'Every four piles of vampyre ashes or four samples of vampyre blood that is collected should be delivered to Avir Sterbla in the Magus Conlegium. Avir is the Governor of Magician Studies and is currently working with Kellari Autumnfall, Lathin Firetree, and myself on developing better weapons and spells to battle the Coterie of the Eternal Night. Avir is zealous in his battle with the vampyres, he lost a relative to their wicked coterie many years ago. <br>

[Fri Dec 07 19:40:29 2001] You say, 'counteragents?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 07 19:40:29 2001] Drenic Garrison says 'Since our Empires first arrival on Luclin a citizen or in some cases several citizens occasionally fall victim to terrible diseases and toxins. The effects on our people were devastating at first but over the years we have become more accustomed to life on this moon. Still, if we were able to eradicate these diseases and poisons entirely many lives would be saved. The damp subterranean Fungus Grove and Paludal caverns are among the most infested areas. If you brave those dank passageways and return with a Muck Beetle Mandible, Black Fungal Fiend Spores, Green Fungal Fiend Spores, and a Grimfang Poison Sack I will gladly take them to the researchers for further study and experimentation. <br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 07 19:41:08 2001] You say, 'snake people?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 07 19:41:09 2001] Drenic Garrison says 'To the west beyond the Twilight Sea is an airless grey region between the light and dark sides of Luclin. Some time ago our scouts cooperating with powerful members of the Magus Conlegium attempted to chart the expanses of the barren treacherous region. During this excursion the scouts and magi encountered a small group of strange snake like men. The magi detected no magical aid that was allowing the creatures to move freely in the airless void without danger of suffocation. When approached the snake men quickly fled. We wish to know how these creatures survive in such conditions. If they prove to be a hostile species then we will have to resort to examining their [anatomy]. <br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 07 19:41:26 2001] You say, 'anatomy?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 07 19:41:27 2001] Drenic Garrison says 'I wish to examine the lungs or whatever breathing organs these creature have.  It would not be prudent to hunt and kill a living member of this species and society we know practically nothing about but there are several undead snake men in the region as well. I will require three such organs however to perform the proper experiments. <br>
<br>
*That's the end of Garrison's text.*<br>

<br>
This &quot;Quest&quot; will result in a caller moving down into a cave and &quot;calling&quot; monsters<br>
<br>
So far we have seen them call 3 Fungusbeasts at a time, and then the caller gets attack and dies if you do not kill the 3 monsters first. <br>
<br>
One of the times the monsters were called, a named one came out called Katcha, and when killed it dropped a Swollen Fungusbeast Gland. This item was a all/all ammo slot item with 10 charges of snare.<br>
<br>
We are trying to figure out the rest of Quest atm. Oh and btw, the Blargrot cost 50, 80, or 100 plat, depending on what one you buy.<br>
<br>
**10 mins later**<br>
<br>
Chakno dropped Gloves of Fungal Flesh on second attempt at this quest, and we now think we know what this quest is.<br>
<br>
<br>
We did this quest with 4 ppl and did not know what to expect, but now it has become clear as to what you do.<br>
<br>
<br>
First it does not seem to matter what Blargrot you hand over to a caller, they all seemed to do the same thing up to this point.<br>
<br>
You hand over the Blargrot (bought in the camp at a Tamrok vendor loc -189, -641), and the caller moves down into the cave. He calls forth 3 Fungusbeast, and you will sometimes see a named be called in that group of three. If you keep the Caller Alive by pulling the Fungusbeast off it and killing them, once you have killed all 3, the caller will call more.<br>
<br>
At this point I am not sure if he calls more after you kill all three, or after a certain amount of time, I will let you all find out.<br>
<br>
I will add to this once we get a better group together =P and please, if you find out anything add to this as well.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujarnin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jarnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/10/01 9:32:54 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.interofficenetworks.com/demo/doh/concussion.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New type of Quest/Camp found out.</span><hr size=1> The Grimling Pouch quest results in a Lore pattern for a backpack.

I know where the quest starts.  See Saumeem Unja in the warrior type building near the graveyard.  He then sends you to (I think) the third floor of the caster tower to see Kallain somethingorother.  She gives you a box for the skins and when you get ten you can combine.  I then gave her the box and got a note but then gave the note to the wrong person.
