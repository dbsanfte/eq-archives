We started from scratch instead of everyone joining the local uber guild and did it right.. But now i dread what happens when we finish off Vindicator and Velketor and look for more uber options like Cazic.. The current uber guilds on the server eat those mobs up before we even get everyone on.. sooo...<br>
<br>
I agree with him in principle.. There are changes to be needed but I dont agree with his style..<br>
<br>
First he complains about spoiler sites... Which is Okay, Id like to be in a guild where we did server firsts but that won't happen for this expansion..<br>
<br>
Then he complains about every &quot;idiot&quot; that triggers a spawn who doesnt know what he is doing.. HELLO! how will you know what you are doing if its your first try.. People can't just go into a first time situation and be expected to win.. <br>
<br>
He comes from a standpoint where every mob is his for his zergling guild..<br>
<br>
He is right though trivialized encounters suck.. I like to feel the mob has a chance when we charge.. its more exciting that way rather than the &quot;lets get this done and move on&quot; attitude..<br>
<br>
But I also take offense to calling every mob I cant kill yet.. Trivial...<br>
<br>
Maybe to them but they have like 70 guildmates thats more than half of what you need...<br>
<br>
<br>
He is right but he is an idiot too.. which i'm sure he doesnt mind being called. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uryzak620.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ryzak620</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/1/02 7:09:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12240.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Being on the same server as Cassius and Eelyen, I gotta agree with them on certain points, and be kind of a pain on some others.<br>
<br>
Yes, we have a serious problem with the two big asian guilds, especially eastern keep.  These 2 guilds used to be allianced, but something happened a couple of weeks ago, causing them to sever ties.  EK, is a weak guild that can no longer do certain things, and literally rides on the backs of others to accomplish things now.  Not to mention their leader is the most server wide hated person I have ever encountered.  However; there are some new alliances amongst some higher level guilds that can do stuff.  A perfect example is my guild Dol Amroth, and their alliance guild Echoes in Eternity.  I won't get into the whole NToV thing w/ you guys.  I like cass and eel a lot.  I respect what they say, and have positive feelings towards them in general.  I was really happy when they went out of their way to tell me grats when i hit 60.  I wasn't at ToV on Wednesday when the shizznat hit the fan.  I was at NToV for about 30 minutes, but w/ 180 peeps in the zone, and going LD 4 times in 20 minutes, decided it wasn't worth the hassle.  And I don't think you are meaning to mention da/eie when you  say some guilds are doing stuff on your coat tails.  We won't go into it. <br>
<br>
But this does lead to the problem that most people have hit on.....we don't need any more 1-50 zones.  Maybe a couple of dungeons for the 30-50 crowd would be cool, on the par w/ lower guk and sol b.  But seriously, even today, the dreadlands is the zone to be in for outdoor 40ish grind.  We dont need more.  What we do need is more Raid oriented and even single group oriented 50+ dungeons.<br>
I may miss some, so bear w/ me. <br>
 Here are the single group dungeons 50+ (not including SoL, i don't go there often to know)<br>
Sebilis<br>
Howling Stones<br>
Chardok<br>
Velks<br>
Sirens Grotto<br>
Karnor's Castle....i guess<br>
opening areas of Icewell Keep<br>
<br>
Here are the 50+ raid zones (including the sol ones i know of)<br>
Western Wastes<br>
Temple of Veeshan<br>
Veeshan's Peak (if you are patient enough to do this inane quest)<br>
Akheva (also has some decent single group grinds)<br>
Juggs/Trak<br>
Ssra Temple<br>
RoF<br>
Planes: Fear, Hate, Growth, Mischief (if even anyone goes here), Air (epic stuff only)<br>
<br>
I'm sure I am missing some, but the point is this......Our server has about 7-8 guilds/alliances capable of doing most if not all of this stuff.  That doesn't seem like a lot of guilds, BUT, almost all of this stuff is on a 3 day timer.  On RN, most of the 3+day timer stuff drops w/ in 12 hours of a patch.  Then, we all wait for 3+ more days to do it again.  There is not enough to go around.  Hence, especially in the last 2 days, there has been some serious strife going on between the higher guilds.  Da/eie have recently made some serious upgrades to their killing ability.  Took us about a month of working together, but we have now done Yelinak, the NToV mobs that have been up we have done.  We've come a long way in the past 2 months, and are ready for out next challenge.  The monopoly held by AoD and Ascent is quickly ending.  And a lot of other guilds are gearing for NToV, when in the past it was just those 2 guilds.  What is the solution? I wish I knew.  I don't want to start guild wars which will end, although very casual, friends I have made in several guilds.  Probably one of the best solutions would be to decrease the spawn time of the mobs, and make their drop stuff slightly more rare.  That probably won't help either.  <br>
<br>
There needs to be something though, or enough people will say the hell with this, this is a game, I dont need to be more stressed playing EQ than I do in my real life career.  Cass and Eel, you guys are great, screw EK, and we'll all figure something out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Sure, the sleeves off of THO are nice, and the Mask out of RoF is nice, but there's simply NOWHERE that you can get as much quality loot as NToV.  Not even close, not in the slightest.  Your three pieces of Vulak loot are pretty much your &quot;perfect in every way&quot; kinda loot, and that's not even counting the other 12 or whatever dragons, plus the flurries and guards.<br>
<br>
A good guild can rip through NToV in 6-8 hours, getting about 40 very great drops.  Compare to Luclin, where there's like one boss mob in every zone.  Since CoH is disabled in pretty much every Luclin raid zone (Ssra, Greigs, Acrylia, The Deep, etc.), you gotta fight through the entire dungeon, taking a good 2-3 hours per raid target... and the popular one (THO) doesn't even respawn upon server resets, and smaller Asian guilds almost always get the Rhags in Ssra, and sometimes accidentally spawn the Glyphed.  Again, you can't rake in the loot ANYWHERE nearly as fast as you can in NToV.<br>
<br>
VP was THE uber raid zone when Velious was released.  It was quickly abandoned as people started killing the earlier boss mobs in Velious, whom dropped far superior loot to VP, and there were a lot more better loot obvious just over the horizon.  This all let up to NToV.  But now that Luclin was released... NToV is STILL the best raid zone available, bar none.  And it *will* continue to be top priority for every guild until Vex Thal is finally released... assuming Vex Thal is similar to NToV.  If it's not, then NToV will STILL probably be the prime target.<br>
<br>
NToV used to be a LOT harder.  Things got a lot easier during that DAoC release patch, where they upgraded melee damage, and reduced resistances.  They rescaled the mobs a bit, but it wasn't enough.  I can say from experience that things got significantly easier that day.  Then when you factor in AA skills, where wizards will do double damage every 6 casts, tanks have 10% more HP, tanks take less damage, casters and priests regen mana faster, priests heal better, spells become more mana efficient, etc.  Things just get easier and easier.<br>
<br>
It's simply a problem that Verant needs to address.  Unfortunately, I think they're over their heads here, and the only way to fix the NToV problem is to create a new NToV raid zone... and then probably yet another a few months after that.  The presence of NToV has severely altered the high-end game recently, no question about it.<br>
<br>
EDIT: To make matters worse, Verant is bloating the loot tables of the new Luclin mobs with, how shall I put it... crap.  Yes, most mobs have a VERY nice drop or two mixed in with a couple average drops.  But lately, Verant has added a ton of cleric weapons that proc DDs, shaman weapons that proc DDs, druid weapons that proc DDs, wizard weapons that proc DDs, mage weapons that proc DDs, necro weapons that proc DDs... and these weapons have stats inferior to epics, let alone the stuff from NToV.  Why they're watering down the good drops like this, I dunno.  I would think that at this point, they'd want to do all they could to encourage players to move away from NToV... <p><a href="http://www.reconstructed.nu/profile.php?pid=119">Baron Aledar Boomcaster</a><br>Sorcerer of <a href="http://www.reconstructed.nu/">Reconstructed</a>, E'ci<br><img src="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~bwa/kerasig.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ualedar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aledar</A> at: 2/1/02 9:22:34 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukrusch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krusch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/1/02 9:04:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12240.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Solution</span><hr size=1> They can always do a complete player wipe.
