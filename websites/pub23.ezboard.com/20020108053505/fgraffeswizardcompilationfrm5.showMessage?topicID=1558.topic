Now, I'm not saying the golem is terrible difficult in comparison to the others, in fact, it's pretty easy.  BUT, look at how long the battle lasts compared to all the others.<br>
<br>
Venril Sathir goes down within 2 minutes, or wins and wipes people out, is that epic?  Does it seem like the battle lasts all that long?<br>
<br>
Any dragon used for epics is difficult, but it's not a long sustained battle, it's more like, &quot;go in, kick ass, or get ass kicked&quot;.  32k hit points isn't a lot when you look at the current damage output.<br>
<br>
The idea of an epic quest is one that is long, complex, and takes a long time to complete.  If they made each staff be a LONG set of subquests, all which lead to the final reward.  Is our quest really so long and complex?  Is there really any quest in EQ that is epic?  The Paladin quest, which requires working on other quests to complete is close, but in general, the only difficulty about the epics in the game is the rare spawns, and the rare drops.  An epic battle should be long and drawn out, throw 50 people at mobs that split, and split, and spawn new mobs, and have it an hour long straight fight.  THAT would be a true epic battle.  The Avatar of War is an epic battle, it lasts for a long time.<br>
<br>
Am I the only one that feels this way, that an epic quest should lead us around by the nose, with 75 steps, each of moderate difficulty, and with waypoints in the quest where you have made obviously significant progress?   <p>Targonis Manastorm<br>

<br>
First I think ragefire is a tougher fight than the broken golem.  Yes he dies faster, but you need more people to kill him.  Broken golem does have a lot of hp's but he doesnt cast/ae, and he doesnt hit hard, so it just takes a while.<br>
<br>
As far as quest difficulty I think mage quest is epic.  Getting to 7th isle for crowns isnt easy or fast.<br>

It's not the difficulty of the battle, I agree that Ragefire is a tougher battle, but it's not a long and extended battle.<br>
<br>
Now, my other point is that for a QUEST to be considered epic, what do you think of in non-EQ terms?  A quest that takes a long time to complete, with many sub-adventures along the way that need to be done to complete it.  Now, where are the sub-adventures/quests?  We get a shopping list of items for most of them, hand them in, and it's over.  Difficulty isn't the key, it's the improper use of the term epic that I find fault with.<br>
<br>
Now, a rebuild of the wizard epic quest with this in mind.  Note that long-term, it's the same effect:<br>
<br>
From Camin:  The one that has knowledge, Arantir was last seen traveling northward into the snowy wastes.<br>
<br>
On traveling, and asking every NPC around, you find one that says, &quot;I know of him, but he has chosen not to reveal himself to just anyone.  Ask for Arantir in the City of Halas, and perhaps he will make himself known to you in time&quot;.<br>
<br>
From there, you come, and are told to deliver several potions for the vendor/NPC to different NPCs around Halas, and a final delivery to be made to Camin.   It is then that we get the next part, that Arantir reveals himself.  You do the bit with the ring to Felwithe, return, and then he tells you about each staff.  Now, instead of the staff being where it is currently, you have several sub-quests/plots....<br>
<br>
From Venril Sathir, he no longer has it, one of his followers has stolen it, and all you find is a diary entry that indicates who the thief was, and a mention of where the thief might have gone.  You track down the thief, through multiple battles and in a battle with a mob that has that 125k HP, you finally get the staff.<br>
<br>
<br>
This sort of idea, that you need to go through many steps to even get one staff out of three would make it more epic, and by having more steps, it also allows for less of a bottleneck on each step.  <br>
<br>
My idea is that it shouldn't be this, &quot;Get me 3 items and bring them back&quot;, and having those three items be difficult because of rare spawns and rare drops off rare spawns.  They should be long and drawn out(the way this post turned out to be).  They should make it so each PIECE feels like you had to spend a lot of time, not GUESSING where to go, but actually going through the steps needed.  Figure 15 steps per staff to get.  You will feel like the Gnarled Staff, when you finally get it, is a great achievement.  Useful on it's own(as it is now), but all the more rare because it's a pain to get.  Unlike the magician epic quest, there should be NOTHING that requires you go that deep into a very unused and expensive to raid zone.  But that's another argument.  <br>
<br>
Difficulty is not the thing I disagree with you on, it's what you consider epic, and it's clear Verant has no clue.<br>

Ragefire has died to 7 people, no harder then the weaker western wastes dragons. Hell we killed Nag last week with 11 secondaries. The encounters are all a joke.  FYI. The two hardest epic battles =<br>
<br>
1) Killing Hoshkar for your green scale (war epic)<br>
2) Prob Queen for war epic. <br>
<br>
Both are fairly easy but if you have never fought Hosh, there is a definitive learning curve. <br>
<br>
You want a epic battle? bring back Cazic skin. remove the golem and have skin drop every time off of New Cazic. Its nice the golem has alot of HP and is compareable to a PoG boss in fighting. However our epic went from hard and rare to a joke with alot of smaller guilds wielding them. Its good I guess that everyone has a chance at the item now and its not out of reach. However I do think they are a lil to easy. Compared to what I and others had to go through.<br>

When they were making the epics, Verant probably had a single list of all the classes listed alphabetically. On a list like this, Wizard would be last.  They probably went down the list one class at a time, then found out they didn't have time to fully implement the Wizard quest.  As a result, they had to cut it down to what it is now (with Cazic, not the Golem). <p><BR>

Instead, I look at the difficulty of the mobs themselves, since if EQ had a true quest system, all quest mobs would ALWAYS drop the item if we've been given the quest.  So, how rare a spawn is, or how often it drops the item really isn't a matter of the difficulty of the quest.<br>
<br>
I agree, needing to kill one or more dragon is harder than what we need for the wizard epic right now.  It's that reason I feel that the epic quests should be more like 4 main parts, with 25 pieces for each of those 4 parts.  Each should be a moderate to difficult fight, but there should be a reasonably clear direction the quest sends us in.<br>
<br>
Phinny, how did we KNOW that it was Phinny?  Because of trial and error.  Same with VS, same with Cazic skin.  There was no good storyline to know that Phinny picked up the staff, or Venril Sathir, or that Cazic Skin was the key.  And let's face it, how can you kill Cazic without getting skin off him if you've been given the quest in the first place?  No, it's clear that the wiz epic really was either rushed, or Verant was just too lazy to make some decent quests that were fun to do.  <br>
