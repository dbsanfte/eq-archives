It is also an example of how Wizards should work.<br>
<br>
The REASON we shine at AE is because mana and aggro don't matter.  Aggro is totally controlled, allowing us to uncork and flatten the bad guys, and mana efficiency is incredible, we can kill 30 guys at once (theoretically) with a bar of mana or less.  Further, resistances are less meaningful because you are chaincasting and its superefficient.  What keeps Wizards from being what they could be is the reasons AE blasting works, you WANT the aggro and the mana doesn't matter if you just killed so many guys it takes a couple minutes just to loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=amueldaemon>Amuel Daemon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/1/01 1:27:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> In the lvl 50+ game there are plenty of dungeons to AoE in for exp.

I dun rantededed.<br>
<br>
I would say that I agree with some, not all, of the subject matter of the post.<br>
<br>
It is apparent that some abilities are not being factored in balance of the class.<br>
<br>
While I agree whole-heartedly that wizards should be tweaked (not totally revamped) to be more group friendly, other capabilities should not be ignored.<br>
<br>
Soloing is VERY boring.  Very.  But - it is something that can be done.  A warrior past around level 20 (arguably less) cannot solo effectively.<br>
<br>
To make the changes that are being presented, you would have to do one of two things:  Allow warriors (or all melee that is being compared to for that matter) capable of soloing a third as well as wizards OR make wizards solo ability far, far less than it currently is.<br>
<br>
Neither of these will ever fly.  One of the two parties would cry foul, and I can pretty much guarantee which one.  Wizards would go ballistic if solo capability was taken, and would complain heavily if warriors and other melee were given effective solo ability.  Not so much the second, as it doesn't affect the wizard too much.<br>
<br>
I agree that soloing is boring, and generally only used as an alternative to grouping.  However, I (44 wiz currently) leveled quickly in The Overthere by soloing.  Made it through level 40 in 2 days.  It took my warrior (49 currently) about 3 weeks to perform the same feat.<br>
<br>
Wizards also have the ability that only one other class does.  Gates.  Not ports, gates.  Ports are convenient, but thats about it.  Gates, however, can come in handy when it comes to grouping.<br>
<br>
When Im LFG, I dont sit at Karnors hoping to be picked like the unathletic, antisocial mole of a kid being picked for lunchtime handball.  I go to numerous places.  I gate all around and usually get a group fairly quickly.  Even though I might have gotten more experience or better loot at Ruins 3, I could be having just as much fun in Lower Guk, Sol B, Eastern Wastes, Great Divide, etc.<br>
<br>
Warriors have to pretty much be where they want to group.  Not much option other than hoofing it.<br>
<br>
Again, I agree that wizards should be tweaked to be more desired in groups.  But Ill be damned if I think that wizards arent powerful.  Even if I dont have ports.  I have snare, awesome AEs, amazing nukes, etc.  Im happy to be a wizard.  <br>
<br>
And for clarification<br>
<br>
A tank missing is a full resist<br>
A tank hitting for less is a partial resist<br>
A tank getting riposted is a fizzle.  <br>
<br>
A wizard fizzling wastes mana (read: hitting ability).  A warrior getting riposted lowers tanking ability (read: absorbing damage).  Not directly lowering ability, but a dead warrior does as much good as a wizard OOM.<br>
<br>
I love my warrior.  I love my wizard.  I think that by playing both characters up to a relatively high level I can appreciate the benefits and flaws to both characters.  When I want to knock the living crap out of something while laughing maniacally and having it beat on me I play my warrior.  When I want to nuke the hell out of something and show it who its daddy is, I play my wizard.  I feel fortunate to have the option.<br>
<br>
Again, sorry for the rant/rave/flame/smacking/novel, but sometimes I just need to get my word in.<br>
<br>
Im probably going to get this ripped apart by the others here, and I openly accept that.  Theres a lot of very smart wizards and other classes that post to this forum, and I feel that any input is good as long as its constructive.<br>
<br>
Thank you, drive through.<br>

<br>
Second, I was not arguing about wizards in raids, nor in AoE groups, nor the ability to get XP by other means, nor any number of other sidetracks and deflections you have tried.  I argued about a wizards long term single target damage, in response to people claiming that wizards did not need a massive jump in that area.<br>
<br>
I have posted my numbers.  Rogues = 5 x wizard.  You can bitch, you can moan, you can point to roots and stuns, you can tell me that I do not know how to play my class, but I am still waiting to see why it is acceptable to you for a warrior to outperform a wizard in every single aspect of an XP combat grind.  Tell me again why this isn't a problem??<br>
On to my favorite idiot du jour:<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; . If you haven't figured out why you don't want to outdamage the melee in a single group setting you are beyond help. I suppose you have never heard of agro management   &lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
No, I haven't figured it out.  Tell me again what the point of having a wizard is if a warrior is better at both offensive damage output and defensive damage absorbtion?  If doing more damage than a warrior is impossible/deadly, explain how monks do it?  How do rogues manage?  My wizard did more damage than any warrior in the game pre-kunark.  You know, when dual yakeshas were the best a warrior could manage.  How did it work then?  How do rogues manage now?  Hint: It's that big &quot;taunt&quot; button.  The same that allows a lev 50 SK to pull a mob off an Ice Comet.<br>
<br>
The game is busted.  Rogue/war/monk damage far outstrips caster damage.  Pointing to aggro, or root, or the mythical aoe group doesn't change that.<br>
<br>
Compare:<br>
Lev 50 war with yaks v Ice Comet wizard and<br>
Lev 60 war with lammys or lightning claw v Sunstrike wizard.<br>
<br>
The former is a nice balance between offense and defense.  The latter is a burden to the warrior.<br>

Fact is..when we do damage..we do the most damage the fastest. And we do it when its needed. When all is good and there is no danger..then we also lose a great deal of our usefulness. but you cannot have the best of both worlds.<br>

Agreed.<br>
<br>
Can 5 wizards drop an add in ToV?  I honestly do not know that, as I am not level 60.  I'm not even level 50 with my wizard yet, so I really can't comment on upper end game.<br>
<br>
But if the answer to the above question is yes, then there's usefulness and uniqueness above what a warrior can do.<br>
<br>
5 warriors cannot drop a high level mob because the damage you are refering to is over time.<br>
<br>
One hit with a lammy is going to be around 30 damage.  Factor in tripple attack and duel wield and you get, max without crits, around 120 damage (it's next to impossible to tripple while duel wielding, but you can tripple and double in the same round).  Multiply by an equivilant to how long it takes to cast sunstrike.  Multiply by 5 warriors.  <br>
<br>
My calculations are 821 damage in 7 seconds from 5 level 60 warriors using a cloak of flames, 255 strength, and duel lammys.  That's max damage, not factoring crits, crips, ripostes, parries, dodges, blocks, etc.<br>
<br>
From 5 level 60 wizards in the same 7 seconds (the cast time on Sunstrike) will get maximum of 8075 damage.  This is also not counting interrupts, fizzles, partial resists, total resists, etc.  I wanted to keep it best case scenereo in both cases.<br>
<br>
Again, warriors will outdamage over time.  That goes without further analysis.  The issue I see here is the wizard's role.  I personally don't see wizards as being the biggest damager in the game.  I see wizards as being situationally amazing at damage.  The role was redefined for both wizards and warriors when kunark and velious came out.<br>
<br>
Warriors were given more AC and better weapons because they needed to keep aggro and take huge damage.  Wizards were given bigger spells (sunstrike, ice spear, questionably banes) but were also given other spells such as lures because they were needed.  Lures by themselves show that the class has been somewhat redefined.  Not major damage, but much more likely to connect.<br>
<br>
If wizards were stripped of many large damage spells and given lots of cheap small nukes that could come close to the damage of a warrior, what would be the point of bringing the wizard along at all for?  Ports?  That's what we're trying to avoid.  The fact that wizards CAN do massive damage quickly when needed is one of the defining characteristics of the class.  Take that away and replace it with (essentially) dots or small cheap nukes, and you have a warrior that doesn't use weapons but uses spells instead and one that can't take hits.<br>

Yea, if you chain-cast from the very start of combat, it will get us killed(hell, it's why rangers go down most of the time).  No, the issue is that pre-57, we don't do nearly as much damage as we should.  At 57 and up, you ARE able to pump out good damage, and it's why it's easier to get into groups as you go up in level.  Here's what I noticed as I leveled up from 51 to 60:<br>
<br>
51: Damage output doesn't quite make us desired in groups, but we do a reasonable amount of damage in a group that isn't twinked too badly.  <br>
<br>
52: We get lure, and quickly discover it doesn't do ANYTHING for us except at raids, or when fighting level 60+ mobs, and even then it gets resisted a LOT.  Damage from draught of fire isn't much more, but we get a few extra casts per bar of mana.<br>
<br>
53: We get nothing except our first Jyll's spell, which is great for AoE groups, or going to places like Unrest or Mistmoore.  Draught of fire still doesn't do much more than it did at 51, but we get a few more casts, but still not enough to let us be fully functional in zones like OS where the mobs have a ton of hit points.<br>
<br>
54: Oh, we get a magic based draught, same damage output at 54 and draught of fire at 54, and generally, mobs resist magic more than fire anyway, so it's pretty useless in most zones when fire is available.<br>
<br>
55: We get another lure(fire), and we get the, &quot;Please kill me now&quot; spell commonly known as draught of Jiva.  This spell has so much more agro, that if you chaincast two of these, it agros more than chaincasting 5 draughts of fire. <br>
<br>
56: Like 53, we get another Jyll's, and if you are VERY lucky, you can get a copy of Markar's Discord, but most will probably never see it since it's as rare, or more rare than sunstrike.  So, without Markar's Discord, this level is useless, with that same stupid +5 damage/cast.  BUT, you will start to feel that you can cast a LOT of draughts at 56 on a bar of mana.  It's still not enough to satisfy, but you start to feel like you can burn down a couple of mobs in OS and feel fairly useful as long as you keep C2 up.<br>
<br>
57: This is our biggest jump in damage output, going to 716 cold damage with our new draught.  Suddenly you are able to do a decent amount more per cast, and over a bar of mana, this works well.  OS becomes much easier to deal with since you CAN drop mobs easier in an emergency, but it's useless through most of Velious.<br>
<br>
58 and 59 just give us more casts.  Our flaming sword of crap is actually useful on a FEW mobs that we can't cast on, including on the enraged golem for the wizard epic.  Fetter shows up, and it IS very very useful, like a cross between the old enstill line(holds a long time if you don't attack the mob), and root line for root and nuke.  Fetter CAN break quickly, but when it sticks, it can stick a LONG time, and is good emergency crowd control.<br>
<br>
60 is only useful if you can get the spells, and none of them are available on vendors.  There are also very few mobs that drop the level 60 wizard spells.  So, unless you have 10k+ to spend to buy each spell, you shouldn't expect to get these short of a LOT of really boring camping.<br>
<br>
With epic, or even with manaskin, chaincasting isn't going to get you killed if you wait to cast.  If you focus on stamina, and insist that the cleric give you a symbol buff, you will also be able to do well while chaincasting.  Our epic is a great thing, it lets you chaincast, and help your GROUP more than you may realize if you don't have it yet.  A mob hits you a few times, you either nuke it down, or you concussion the mob and it eventually gets off you.  You just need to play intelligently.<br>
<br>
The wizard class isn't easy to play well, we all know it, and it's why we complain.  I still am upset that the class isn't balanced, but it's NOT that bad at 60, even without the level 60 spells.  But, level 60 isn't the only place that needs to be balanced.  At level 1, 20, 35, 45, 50, and from 51 to 60.  Items need to help our class besides give us more int or stats.<br>
