<br>
That part made me laugh.  Ummmm My main hand is called an epic weapon.  It's called ragebringer...<br>
<br>
15dmg 25dly 100hp 20str 10 sta 10 agi 10 dex 20pr 20mr 10 dr The effect (worn) grants the wielder 40% haste (stacks with spells but not inate haste items) and 40atk.<br>
<br>
With 40% haste it is a 15 dmg 18 dly weapon. Thanx info.  What really makes me laugh is the fact that all the good stuff is low dly.  Lower than epic in fact. With delays generally ranging from 17-22. <br>
<br>
&quot;It doesnt mean offensive classes are generaly unbalanced. &quot; Did I say they were?  I said they were strong in their environments.<br>
<br>
The biggest thing pvp needs is for cheapo exploits and bs that real pvpers wouldn't touch allready to be nerfed without harming the legitimate tactics. Oh and to have certain AA skills get the hell out of the pvp environment.<br>
<br>
They then need to look at pvp intensely and fix some imbalances and ridiculousnous that effects all classes melee and casters included at different times and in different situtions.<br>
<br>
Then they need to look at the ridiculously broken item loot setup they have now and realize it is in need of major revision because skilless ganking, cheapness, and cowardice shouldn't be the best path to material gain (or point gain for that matter).  Its just bs.<br>
<br>
To claim that you need DT, exploits, or cheapness to pvp as any class is to bring grave doubts forward as to your competence as a pvper.  I would hope you would be in agreement with that.<br>

So the 25 delay weapon you had was a bit more what I expected then an 18 delay weapon, as most of those are pretty low damage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/20/02 6:08:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pffffff</span><hr size=1> &quot;Ah, that explains it.

You'd be suprised how many people even melees can't.  I kinda thought giving the actual adjusted dly showing precisely how fast I was hitting specificly once every 1.8 seconds was a useful way to put it.<br>
<br>
&quot;...and is mostly used by people that want to inflate their egos&quot;<br>
<br>
Excuse me, but how many people do you know that use the way they give weapon dly as a way to boost their ego?  Can you argue without just making shit up?<br>
<br>
Wizards have always been the favored pk class on RZ.  You've  never been the underpowered and under privileged step children of pvp.  You fit that image even less with focus items and AA.   If your concerned with twinks lvl up.<br>
<br>
People who spend their time in melee heavy exp grind groups think wizard dmg sucks.  People who do AE groups, quad kiting, and raiding have a different opinion do they not?<br>
<br>
People who don't play their wiz agressively, the kind of guys whose pvp vs melee experience consists of melees whacking them while their medding unawares and taking their lunch money think wizards suck in pvp.<br>

I wouldnt call one decent weapon with that delay many. And it would still be somewhat worse for pvp then epic. The rest of the list doesnt have anything to do with it at all (and I recognise all the rest), because close still isnt the same.<br>

Rogues have always been the favored pk class on RZ. You've never been the underpowered and under privileged step children of pvp. You fit that image even less with new weapons and disciplines.

That makes a lot of sense there Aurore. In fact it even makes a lot of sense for RZ if you think about. How many no drop wizards do we have that lose nothing in dying and gain hugely from the very same situation described above. Killing AND dying a lot.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Practically all the PK wizards on RZ why? Everyone PVPs as they wish, I know that I do my best not to die, because that's what shows how good you are at PvP, and that's why I will gate / run if the situation is not to my advantage.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So whats shocking about wizards being on top of point gain and gain of loot on RZ? Strong offense and weak defense like rogues. Warriors with their huge hp have great defense but weak offense. They don't die often but they wont be ahead point wise on SZ and much more importantly for the people on RZ thye will over time replace good gear lost to pvp with very little or nothing to show for it as far as pvp gains regardless of skill unless they chooses to gang bang pk with some casters. Is the grass really greener?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nope but if you just run around always in no drop gear then you won't lose anything, if that's your problem. The point is, if a wiz ran around with gear, he'd have lost it all pretty fast. That's why they run around with nothing, and get stuff when they kill people. Is it fair? No, but up to you to chose the way you want to PvP, be it by risking gear and having a slight advantage to using it, or by going no risk, and possibly losing some effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Are wiz the perfect PK-Ebay class? Yes I agree. Do wizards fit my view of balanced PvP, in so far as they have a chance against every class, no not at all. The PK-Ebay wizards are simply using the best tool for their ends (ie get loot off players regardless of the number of times they die themselves.<br>
<br>
This is quite a different discussion from the fact that wizards are good in PvP or not. I don't call dying 10 times and killing 1 monk and looting a fungus tunic a class balanced in PvP. I have my views on PvP; and Sullon is imo the best PvP server from the ruleset, because even if they are scoring points, those wiz are taking the deaths (albeit small with xp res but still) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ullyapakadeabn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llyap aka Deabn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/02 9:11:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pffffff</span><hr size=1> Aerimus wrote: &quot;Wizards have always been the favored pk class on RZ.&quot;<br>

<br>
Since when? I know of exactly 1 non newbie pk rogue on RZ. You know what though?  He waited till upper 50s after good guilds helped him get good stuff to turn pk... <br>
<br>
Thought admittedly I have seen a bunch of uber twinked 20ish alts rogues pking if thats what you mean.  But I guess when you have gear 30 lvls above your actually lvl any melee becomes a god. A bunch of lvl 20s twink alts hardly makes rogues the pk class of norath...<br>
<br>
As far as wizards power vs skilled oponents what do you mean by that.  You mean you can't kill plate tanks and clerics because they have too many hp, that uber guilders kick your ass, or that you can't win a fair duel.  <br>
<br>
The first isn't all of pvp nor is the 2nd both demand their own precise solution not a blanket one, the last hardly matters.<br>
<br>
As far as there being no balance here well wizards are good at killing by suprise.  You might say that this is balanced by something of a disadvantage vs a prepared oponent.<br>
<br>
Any specific pvp problems that wizards may well face need to be described in detail and adressed by precise solutions.<br>

Which needs work there? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27>PVP Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
