There were some bugs, to be sure, but nothing that couldn't be forgiven with the understanding that they would be fixed over time.<br><br>i.e., that the number of bugs would become fewer, not more.<br><br>It was also my understanding that wizards were supposed to be the masters of fast damage.<br><br>It appears that I was wrong on both counts.<br><br>Rain spells are broken (yes, BROKEN) due to a fix to something unrelated to wizards, and Verant hasn't felt it necessary to fix them in at least six months now (Hint: Try casting any rain spells in a newbie area.  See if any rats actually die, even at level 60)...<br><br>Sight spells are broken/useless, as the targeting code Bind Sight uses now requires you to see a monster's feet, and you could *never* actually cast around corners by doing this.  NIGHT is broken, since so many people who chose night-blind classes whined apparently.  Granted, at level 50+ you have about 40,000 candlepower in light-emitting equipment anyway, but naked at midnight I can now see in North Karana just as well as I can at high noon, so the various vision spells are also quite useless.<br><br>Identify has come in handy all of twice, and at level 28 when I got the Staff of the Wheel I also got a rock that can cast it for me.  I needed that for what, exactly, again?<br><br>I've watched new damage item after new damage item get dropped into the game for melee classes, all with higher damage per second ratios than before, and quite a number of them with wizard spells on them that I would DIE to be able to cast without manna, and many that are just one notch under what I would consider using in the same fight, to the point where just about any tank can get their hands on enough equipment to KS a wizard without really trying (i.e, they do more damage over the long term, AND the short term now)... that is, if it's not a rogue who can just assassinate the thing.  I have yet to see new wizard spells get dropped into the game that actually exceed the current manna:damage ratio range.<br><br>I've found quests (in EverQUEST) specific to the wizard class so few in number that I can count them without taking off my shoes.  How is it that the game is named EverQuest, yet the vast majority of the time I have to spend sitting on my ass, anyway?  You'd think there'd be two or three quests per level available, rather than one every five to ten levels or so.<br><br>After awhile, I'd gotten used to waiting three hours for a group, and had even begun planning my play time around it... and then finally, sitting in the back room in Velketor's Lab, it hit me.  I could get to level 60 without ever leaving that room, and I knew to within a 10% margin of error exactly how many hours of play it would take, and that very little else would possibly be able to happen OTHER than just that, since I'm not in an uber-guild.  (Temple of Veeshan?  Not a chance without being in an uberguild.  Tell me again how badly I need to go looking for these bane spells, which incidentally, I can't get because I'm not in an uberguild... ...and good luck getting into an uberguild if you don't have uber gear and clothes.  I suppose people are twinking them over from the druid main.)<br><br>There are *no* complex puzzles in the game that can be solved at a rate faster than that achieved by the application of tons of spare time.  Now that literally everything in the game has been wrapped in nerf tape and buried under six feet of nerf nuggets due to the 5% of continual whiners trying to play the game on a 14.4k modem with with a Pentium 133 and their Trident 8900 card, there are hardly even any split-second decide-or-die situations that don't give you a good fifteen to twenty seconds before they become unrecoverable.  *No* quest in the game requires the intelligence of a turnip to solve, aside from one with some rats in Queynos which is now gone again.  ...and actually, with the number of things that Verant has changed and added without managing to fix much of what they brutalize, it's no longer even a good idea to pay attention to what NPCs say because they're very likely to be giving completely *wrong* information, and your best bet is to rummage through web boards trying to figure out how the quest currently has to be completed.<br><br>I also determined that there was no way in hell I was going to continue putting up with this crap.  The reason people play this damn game for hours and hours and hours is not because they're enjoying themselves so much, it's because the game is 99.9% centered around *your character sitting on it's ass doing nothing*, waiting endlessly for whatever it is that's going to happen (Ancient Critter spawning, regular mobs to respawn, the forage/fishing skill finally getting the rare fine, etc).  No class seems to be affected by this more than the wizard class.  I, for one, am done with sitting around.  I am particularly done with sitting around for four hours at a time waiting to find a group and hoping that they'll stick around for four more hours just so I can break even on actual play time, because the class is so terribly broken.  I am very VERY done with sitting around watching people with uber-weapons land blows rather frequently that do more damage than my bread-and-butter nukes.  ...and I am certainly done with listening to Verant's bullshit about how none of these problems actually exist, and it's all the fault of the players anyway.<br><br>And for anyone that cares to suggest it, NO I do not consider it even remotely humane to suggest that I make another character of a different class and play it back up past 50 just to get back to the same level of play.  Not when the game has been designed from the ground up as a collossal time sink with every single way out painstakingly and ruthlessly eliminated (excepting quad-kiting, which is exciting for the first week or so, and then simply becomes boring as hell, but quieter).  Anyone who suggests that an acceptable option is taking six more months of time (if you have even a small life) just to take another character through all that nonsense because of poor planning on the part of the game developers should seriously have their head examined.<br><br>If players are expected to put in this MAJOR investment in time, then Verant should understand that there damn well needs to be something there that's useful once that time has been invested.  Or to put it another way, if you buy a car (major investment in time as money), and it turns out to be a lemon after six months, you're not going to go politely buy another car because the dealer says it's the right thing to do, and you're certainly not going to be buying it from the same dealer.  I want a game where there is a balance where risk == reward, not time wasted == reward.  I thought I was playing it at first, but over time the game has changed, that assumption has become wrong, and I am done.<br><br>You'll probably see me wandering around Luclin seeing the sights, since that's really pretty much all there is to do in the game anymore.  I'm guessing it'll be good for about two weeks of poking around, and then I'm terminating my account.  If I want to waste tons of time staying up all night looking at pretty colors, I think I'll just go back to doing acid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usilaren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silaren</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/uberkaduber/1510069.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/2/01 6:21:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I've had enough of this crap</span><hr size=1> Bye Dagmar,<br><br>Was nice talking to you on Quellious when we had the chance. <br><br>Especially at CS while sitting on our asses <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Silaren<Br>52 Channeler<Br>On Quellious </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umdarkelf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mdar kelf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/3/01 5:40:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mdar.homestead.com/files/elf_queen.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I've had enough of this crap</span><hr size=1> Later, take care.<br>And I have killed stuff with rain spells before in the newbie garden... <p><table border="0" width="111"><tr><td nowrap style="filter:glow(color=#FFFF00"strength="1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt'"><font  size="6" Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Mdar Kelf</font></td><td><td>Only on E-marr</td></tr></table>Test your sig <a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/brombustestboard">Here!!!</a><br><br><a href="http://www.botepidemic.com/frikbot/q1mons/"><img src="http://www.botepidemic.com/frikbot/q1mons/shub.jpg" border=0 alt="I'm Shub Niggurath!

The world is static and bland.  the graphics are now long stale, and just how many npc's can you brutally murder before you realize how boring this really is?<br><br>I tried the play up another character approach.  In 3 months, with reasonable (not major) play, I had a 49 cleric while my then 55 wizard rotted.  What a silly mistake.  Because of the VAST time comittment I already had in EQ, I was unwilling to just let it go.  But now, my 52 cleric is tired of sitting on hit butt (which is the main thing Clerics do), and my 58 wiz is locked in the lose exp on raids, sit around for ever trying to get exp group syndrome.  So I had a lemon (my wizard), and as you pointed out, bought another lemon from teh same dealer.<br><br>Now, out comes SoL.  But the system requirements are higher than I have on my deskstation or my notebook.  So, am I now going to buy an upgraded box?  Hmmmm.<br><br>Addictions are a terrible thing.   EQ is clearly an addiction for any one who plays up to L 50, let alone any one who plays multiple characters up to such.  We will see...I get the luxury of being forced to go cold turkey.  We will see if I come back.  Your post above helped me with the resolve not to go right out and charge a new machine.
