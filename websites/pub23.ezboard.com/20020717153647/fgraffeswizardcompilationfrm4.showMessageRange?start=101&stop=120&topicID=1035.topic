     The &quot;offical&quot; definition.  What authority makes it official?  The Constitution creates the Supreme Court to interpret such provisions, it doesn't state, &quot;Check the dicitionary.&quot;  What about word meanings that change over time?  Which dictionary do we follow?  Oxford, Webster, American Heritage?  Which one is the official dicitionary which controls our word interpretation?<br>
<br>
     And the dictionary defintions are not always so clear.  This is the definition from the dictionary for establishment which someone listed above:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 6. To make a state institution of (a church).</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
     What is a &quot;state institution&quot; of a Church?  To Create a &quot;Church of America&quot; obviously falls under this definition.  Are there any areas of grey where &quot;institutions&quot; may be de facto created?  What about the government funding one religion over others?  What about the government providing the use of public facilities to one religious group and prohibiting such use to others?  At one point does favoritism towards one religious group, to the exclusion of others, lead to a &quot;de facto&quot; establisment of a state religion?

I will not say that discipline is not required with guns..because it is.  The responsibility falls squarely upon the shoulders of the parent to enstill the respect in guns that they rightfully deserve.  As a parent you will teach your child to drive, you will teach them to look both ways before crossing the street...and above and beyond all else you should be teaching them not to do harm to others.  <br>
<br>
in a nutshell, and not to sound cliche...but guns arent the things that kill people.

     Or we could turn to the case law and examine the precedent decided upon by the Supreme Court.  Asserting that it is a right, does not make it so.  Stating this right with more finality, does not make it more correct to assert this alleged right.  <br>
<br>
     The Second Amendment is about as ambiguous as it gets.  Read one way, it seems to narrowly apply to militias.  Read another, it provides a right to bear arms.  The SC has determined that there is no <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> fundamental right</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to bear arms and as such the legislation has wide discretion to pass legislation in this area.  Ironically, it is those that cry loudest about &quot;State's Right's&quot; that seem to want to constrain the power of the state to legislate in this area.   <p>Torcer Arcana - 60 Sorcerer - Brothers of Darkness - The Nameless</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/14/02 4:34:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> typical idiocy</span><hr size=1> People like you are why this country is screwed up.

This is such a common argument, and it is incredibly flawed.  Have you ever heard of amendments?  The constitution can be changed.  It was intended to be changed.<br>

The founding fathers were intelligent enough to realize that there is no universal truth.  That what is appropriate in their time may not be appropriate in the future.<br>

      You have a very distorted view of the &quot;Founding Fathers.&quot;  &quot;Natutral Law,&quot; was important to the FF, no doubt, but there was anything but absolute agreement as to how these NL principles were applied to actual situations.  The FF wrote down general principles in the Con because they distrusted what the political majority would do to the political minority, thats all.  Despite what you assert, there was no  agreement in this first generation as to what the words meant when applied to specific factual situations.  <br>
<br>
     The Federalists and the Jefersonian Republicans had disagreements which dwarf those present in today's American society.  They had disagreements about those very words that you think they viewed as absolute.  The Alien and Sedition Acts, Slavery, the Commerce Clause, State's rights, etc, ad infinitum.  <br>
<br>
     This supposed &quot;absolutes&quot; written down by the FFs is myth.  What you seek to do is take your viewpoint, assert that it is the &quot;absolute truth&quot; written down by the FFs, and by this assert that your view is the absolute truth.<br>
<br>
     You state that the Con is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;interpereted&quot; by losers who don't believe in truth or any authority.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Um, no.  The Con is a living document meant to constrain the power of government.  The question is &quot;what authority,&quot; because someone must  interpret it.  If you let the legislature, i.e., the majority, interpret it, then the Con becomes w/o purpose because its this very majority the Con seeks to constrain.  <br>
<br>
     Its easy to criticize, but I ask you &quot;which autority&quot; should interpret the Con?  You belittle the role of precedent and misconstrue what it is or how lasting it is.  Case law is the way we have decided disputes for 800 years.  It is natural that the Court and not the legislature interpret the provisions, not the legislature.  The original menaing of the words, in the 18th C, is one factor the SC uses.  Your lack of respect for this system and the rule of law is what would truely have appauled the Founding Fathers. <p>Torcer Arcana - 60 Sorcerer - Brothers of Darkness - The Nameless</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ualtruxquestmaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Altrux Questmaster</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/02 5:01:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=111>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://personal.bhm.bellsouth.net/bhm/l/l/llid/EQ/altruxhat.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1> &quot;This is such a common argument, and it is incredibly flawed.

The drafters were no doubt visionaries, being wise, compasionate sane people for their time.... but I doubt any one of them considered that in the future &quot;arms&quot; would include automatic weapons that can be concealed in a pocket, can be quickly reloaded, are accurate at reasonably long range, and which (in short) give a single person the potential to quickly kill large numbers of people.  What they were accustomed to were long barrelled single-shot rifles, or wildly inaccurate single-shot pistols.  The differences in what they were used to, and the modern state of firearms (and of the US) are vast.  <br>
<br>
NT: I doubt the drafters of the constitution had a handy Standard American-English dictionary handy at the time, or that word meanings have gone completely unaltered in two hundred years.  Hence the need for interpretive law.<br>
<br>
Personally, I favour relatively strict gun control.  Gun owners should be licensed. Those licenses should be sufficiently hard to obtain to deter &quot;casual&quot; buyers, buyers who don't demonstrate adequate knowledge or responsibility in respect of gun maintenance and use etc, and buyers who by virtue of other standards (diminished mental capacity, past criminal convictions etc) are plain not &quot;good risks&quot;.  I favour severe restrictions on the resale of firearms.  I favour periodic &quot;relicensing&quot; of firearms so that the authorities can ensure that firearms are remaining in the possession of those authorised to possess them.  That's about it.  In short, I don't mind people owning guns, but they've got to demonstrate at least minimal sanity and responsibility by jumping through the hoops first; and once they've got the guns, those guns need to stat &quot;legitimate&quot; rather than filtering down to the street.  <br>

The concept of the right to bear arms holds true weather you are talking about wheel lock rifles or swords or a Mossberg 12 guage.  The reasons they put it in the constitution have not changed.  And the bottom line is this: you may not LIKE what the Bill of Rights says, but you can't simply IGNORE it as a lawmaker.  Every single legislator and elected official at the US federal level swears to DEFEND AND UPHOLD the US Constitution.  They are under its legal authority, and if you or anyone else doesn't like what a part of the constitution says, then you feel free to work to get that changed.  Until it IS changed however, you are required and legally bound to work under what it says - not wiggle around trying to make it say something it does not, and certainly not to ignore it.<br>
<br>
And I like cops, just not lawyers.  People who are paid to lie and distort and defend things they don't believe in just leave me with a profound sense of disgust. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufaithkills.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faithkills</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Will Argue For Food</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/02 8:49:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=114>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1> &quot;There's some nitwit religious leader from Ottawa who's been publishing essays on why the Taliban and Al'Qaeda are good.

Martial arts is just not a practical means of self defense. The criminals WILL have guns, (as they do, even in Canada) in many situations the only way for a victim to survive is to be armed.<br>
<br>
&quot;As my coworker puts it, &quot;the feeling of need for a firearm is a sign of cowardice.&quot; You think you need to hide behind a 9mm barrel with 17 magnum hollowpoint rounds in the magazine because you are afraid to actually confront those who accost you, and you are not confident enough in your own abilities to realize that there's far better solutions to conflict than violence in any form, even that implied by the presence of a gun.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
This is purely assinine. A CRIMINAL using a gun may be a 'coward'. However is not the job of a woman walking home from work to be brave and 'actually confront those who accost' her. Victims do not ask to be in that situation. Victims do not have to subscribe to your idiotic assertion that cowards deserve to be victimized. Not everyone deludes themselves that they will be fearless when confronted with death. Until it's happenned to you I think your implication that YOU would do so is uninformed and delusional at best and horseshit at worst.<br>

&quot;Do you think you'll be able to draw a gun fast enough for them to not realize what you're doing and fire?&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Well since every state with concealed carry laws has reduced crime apparently the CRIMINALS think that this is the case, or at least it is not worth the extra risk. Whether this is the reality or not is rather moot, since even the increased risk of you being armed is enough to deter many criminals.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know that if I were a panicked individual, or a criminal, pointing a gun at you and I saw you reaching for a gun in your pocket, I'd shoot.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Yes but this isn't how it usually works. The criminal must needs approach you first. Giving the vigilant time to prepare.<br>
<br>
Certainly being armed is not make you impervious to crime, it never has. However it is absurd to think being armed doesn't help your chances.<br>

&quot;The only possible reason for you to want a concealable firearm is to perform a criminal act. If you are not intending to break the law with your firearm, you don't need to hide it. That, in itself, invalidates your argument.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
LOL. Despite this being patently preposterous, I only need one counterexample to disprove this. But I will provide tens of thousands. The examples provided by all the people that carry legally licensed concealed weapons for self defense. <br>
<br>
And commit no crimes.<br>

Further there is good data on people with concealed carry permits, obviously, and the people with them have drastically lower crime rates than the population at large.<br>

<br>
&quot;This is such a common argument, and it is incredibly flawed. Have you ever heard of amendments? The constitution can be changed. It was intended to be changed.&quot; - Liquid<br>
<br>
Yes but it has not been.<br>
<br>
Further if you read the writings of the people in question (federalist papers, anti-federalist papers, etc) it is clear they thought the right to bear arms and further the common excercise of that right was necessary to ensure a free state.<br>
<br>
&quot;...... but I doubt any one of them considered that in the future &quot;arms&quot; would include automatic weapons that can be concealed in a pocket, can be quickly reloaded, are accurate at reasonably long range, and which (in short) give a single person the potential to quickly kill large numbers of people.&quot; - Bone<br>
<br>
Well I don't know if the machinegun was imagined by this point, but I am sure they could have understood the concept if it was. And I am sure they would not have thought that the _government_ should have exclusive right to such weapons. The POINT was to keep govt honest.<br>

    Avoid?  No.  Most of the historical evidence suggests that the Founding Fathers originally intended the Second Amendment to apply to local militias, a dominant form of defensive orgainzation at the time.  The &quot;Grey&quot; area I am talking about is &quot;did they intend for the Second Am to apply to an individual right to bear Arms, outside of the context of militias?&quot;  If I were the NRA then I would tread carefully with the &quot;Origianl Intent&quot; argument.&quot;  They might not like the result if asking whether the framers, living in a pre-rifle, pre assault weapon, musket world, really intended the 2nd Am to apply as broadly as they would like to think it does.<br>

You think absolutes were vital to the upper classes at any point in history?  Laff.  Members of governing bodies have broken moral codes and legal bounds regularly since long before our Constitution was written.  Again, the only absolute ALL the founders believed in was the existence of God.  Have you ever wondered why the first ten Amendments weren't simply included in the Constitution?  Many of the original founders couldn't have cared less about them, but the ratification of the Constitution depended on certain elements who wanted additional guaranteed freedoms, and who saw the original document as an open invitation to tyranny.  <br>
<br>
You think all the founders had the same vision for the country and believed in the same set of absolutes?  Laff.  Remember the whole slavery debate that took place before the Constitution and Bill of Rights were drafted?<br>

You see, TWTW plays an important role in every society.  If you want to ignore TWTW because you personally believe that, 200 years ago, people believed in certain absolutes that match yours...feel free.  While you're doing that, people who do understand TWTW, who understand your argument completely, and who reject your argument based on their own research will snicker quietly and move on.<br>

To the extent it _is_ true it was not a Christian god they all believed in.<br>

<br>
There are ways to remove judges from office. They are not equivalent to the law nor immune from it.<br>
<br>
From a legal perspective the Constitution is mutable. From a philosophical perspective the people have a duty and an obligation to oppose an unjust law or an unjust government.<br>
<br>
In fact these things overlap. For example, if I am a soldier and obey a DIRECT ORDER from a lawfully commissioned officer to do something wrong, I CAN be court martialled, along with the officer, if they can show that I knew it was wrong.<br>
<br>
Morality and justice are not totally separated from the law, hence jury nullification. You can outlaw guns, but if you try me for killing someone in self defense the jury can, and has, told the law to go sodomize itself and aquit me.<br>
<br>
Political reality can cause the Bill of Rights to be compromised. But at some point the people must rebel against tyranny. That the constitution and thus the government is empowered by the people is the _philosophical_ underpinning of it. It is the understanding that every high school kid gets in Civics class.<br>
<br>
It was RIGHT for americans to overthrow an oppressive and tyrannical government.<br>
<br>
