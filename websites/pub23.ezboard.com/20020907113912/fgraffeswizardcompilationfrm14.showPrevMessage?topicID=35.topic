No need to panic, just read this!  <br><br>I'll teach you how to run a basic Hall of Testing lobby raid.  While roaming the halls themselves are a lot more fun and usually (in my guild's experience) result in a better drop rate for armor, setting up your first ToV camp in the lobby of the Hall of Testing is a lot safer (and more forgiving) for beginners.  This is because A) no mobs will roam into your campsite unless you agro them and B) it's a lot easier to recover from a wipeout by having your clerics step into the lobby and start rezzing, than it is to have to get people back into ToV so that their corpses can be summoned before they can be rezzed.<br><br><br>Part One: What You Need To Do Before The Raid!<br><br>If this is your first time in Temple of Veeshan, I suggest you bring a well-balanced raid of at least 24 people.  While my guild has personally done a lobby raid with as few as 8 people, we have also been doing ToV together for a while now and know how to stay alive long enough to get the kill.  If you can bring a level 60 shaman, magician, enchanter, and warrior with you-- not to mention a level 58+ bard-- it'll make your first raid run a lot more smoothly.  Make sure to also bring at least one Feign Death puller (monk, shadowknight).  While it is possible to use other classes as pullers in ToV, a FD puller will die far less often while bringing the mobs back to the raid party.<br><br>Make everyone who is coming check their faction!  If they do not con dubious or higher to anything on Claws of Veeshan faction (or if they do not know what faction they are!), do NOT let them come on the raid!  Send them to Kael to kill giants until they are at least dubious to the inhabitants of Skyshrine.  The best place to faction farm in Kael is in the Arena.  It might take 3 or 4 sessions in Kael-- especially if you've killed some things on the Claws of Veeshan faction-- but your bad dragon faction is fixable if you're willing to work on it.  I don't care how valuable a person might be on the raid; if Skyshrine considers them a walking snack, they'll do more harm than good in HoT by agroing our dragon buddies.  This is a BAD thing, especially if you happen to be fighting at the time.<br><br>Also, make sure everyone brings their resist gear!  Unless you are the main tank, you are far more likely to die to a mob's AE than you are to be mauled by the mob itself.  While occasionally something will poison, the two most important resists to raise are fire and cold.  Also, because ability to resist AEs determines how well you survive a fight, I recommend that you do not have anyone lower than level 54 on the raid.  Prior experience with people lower than 54 on the raid has demonstrated that those 53 and below are far less likely to resist AEs than those 54+-- thus being a bigger mana drain on your raid's healers both during the fight and after, when the lower level people need to be rezzed and rebuffed more often.  This will slow down your raid, thus making it boring!  Bored people will make your job as raid leader hell.  Bored people will do stupid things like try to explore areas they have no business being in, and agro mobs while your casters are OOM.  So tell your level 53 and lower friends to level up if they want to come!<br><br><br>Part Two: Getting Everyone To ToV!<br><br>The nearest port to Temple of Veeshan is in Cobalt Scar.  There are two zones between Temple of Veeshan and Cobalt Scar: Siren's Grotto and Western Wastes.  This is the safest way I know how to get people there:<br><br>At the Port Circle in Cobalt Scar: Give your raiders levitate, see invis, and invis.  Levitate because someone will probably otherwise need a rez if they don't know how big a drop there is from the cliff-top to the beach if they've never been in Cobalt Scar before, and it's also easier to keep up when you're running out on the water to Siren's Grotto zone.  See invis so people can see you, so that they can follow you when you are invisible.  INVISIBILITY IS IMPORTANT IN GETTING TO SIREN'S GROTTO SAFELY.  The zone to Siren's Grotto is located underwater at 1150, 1560.  It is guarded by two sirens that-- fortunately-- do not see invis.  These sirens are enchanters-- which means that they can charm!  Ever see a level 60 druid fry a level 60 cleric?  I have.  That cleric didn't know what hit him before he was dead!<br><br>In Siren's Grotto:  Have your people stay by zone-in until they are decessioned, evacced, or succored to the zone's &quot;safe spot&quot;-- which just so happens to be really close to the zone to Western Wastes (205, neg90).<br><br>In Western Wastes: SoW, levitate, see invis, and invis your raiders before you leave the tunnel.  The levitate is VITAL in this zone, if this if your first time in Western Wastes.  There's nothing quite like doing a 10K dive into a canyon that you didn't know was there!  The invis is important too.  The reason for this is that while the dragons and their kin will not bother you if you do not bother them, there are some things (like velium hounds and ice burrowers) that will.  Also, if you have bad Ring of Scale faction (read: you've killed lots of Kunark wurms and dragons), there is a KOS dragon named Esorpa of the Ring that roams the area in front of Temple of Veeshan zone.<br><br>Once everyone has SoW, lev, see invis, and invis, go northwest to loc 700, 700.  You will encounter two canyons before you zone into Temple of Veeshan.  The first is the canyon to Dragon Necropolis, and you can run around it rather than drop into it and have to climb back out.  The second canyon holds the zone to ToV itself.  Drop into this canyon and look for a temple-like entrance.  Wave to Sontalak if he's alive.  If you're a caster, bind right next to the two pillars shooting lightning at the end of the hall.  When you're ready to enter ToV, get close to one of those pillars and click on it.<br><br><br>Part Three:  Getting Everyone Into The Hall of Testing!<br><br>You are now in the Lobby of the Temple of Veeshan.  You need to get your raiders to the lobby of the Hall of Testing, where the mobs that drop the armor for Skyshrine quests are located.  The Hall of Testing is in the East Wing of ToV.  Mobs in the East wing are factionless.  The story behind why it's okay to kill in the Hall of Testing is because these dragon-kin are damned because they went against Veeshan's will, and are eternally being rezzed (respawned) to be killed again in punishment for their crimes.  To get to the Hall of Testing lobby, go north through the only exit in the Lobby and down the long hallway, until you reach the doors going left and right.  MAKE EVERYONE GO THROUGH THE SAME DOOR!  You don't want to deal with people wandering and getting lost, especially if they get separated and blunder into the KOS-to-all North wing or past the drop-off in the Claws of Veeshan-friendly West wing.  I suggest using the right-side door, since the door you want in the next room is on the right side.<br><br>You are now in what I like to call the Intersection room.  Behind you (on the same level-- do not go down any stairs) is the zone-in, aka the place you just came from.  The left-hand door leads to West, which is safe to dragon lovers and-- if you stumble around long enough-- has a zone out.  The door ahead of you goes to North-- DO NOT GO THERE!  North is not safe for ANYONE, not even those allied to Claws of Veeshan.  The final door on the right is East-- the door you want.  Open that door, and step into the lobby of the Hall of Testing.  Get used to it.  You will be setting up your camp here.<br><br><br>Part Four: Setting Up Camp!<br><br>Here is a rough map of your camp-site.  It is not to scale, nor are the trifling details (like how many stairs there are before the drop to the pit) completely accurate.  But this should give you a general idea of what I'm talking about when I mention certain parts of the lobby camp:<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.ixpres.com/kohpry/hotmap.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Before you get ready to pull, make sure you drill this into your raid's heads: the area before the stairs on my map marked &quot;Tiles&quot; is No Man's Land.  NO ONE except for the puller crosses those three final rows of tiles unless they have your permission!  Do NOT let anyone explore!  That's a sure way to bring 1, 2-- possibly even 3 or 4-- level 60+ mobs down on your unsuspecting raid party.  Don't think that's a serious problem?  Imagine then that Venril Sathir, Vox, Naggy, and General V'Ghera for the Rogue Epic are all on steroids and decided they're gonna gang up on your raid party.  Do you think you can handle all four of them at once?  No?  Then make sure your raiders stay PUT!  If they won't listen, trans them after you're done rezzing!<br><br>There is another, very vital rule that your raiders have to have etched into their brains:  the door you opened to come into the lobby of the Hall of Testing MUST STAY CLOSED!  No one is allowed to open that door without asking if it is &quot;safe&quot; to open the door first.  &quot;Safe&quot; is defined by the following three conditions:<br><br>1) The puller is not out pulling.<br><br>2) You are not actively killing something.<br><br>3) The Feign Death people are not dragging a player's corpse back to the lobby to be rezzed. Special note: only necromancers, monks, and shadowknights are allowed to drag someone's corpse back to the lobby, and said-classes must first FD before /corpse-ing the body.  Dragons (friendly or otherwise) will snack on anyone dragging a corpse while standing.<br><br>The reason for this is simple: dragons do not care what faction their fellow dragons are on.  If the Claws of Veeshan-friendly dragons on the other side of the door see you fighting another dragon, they WILL assist said-dragon.  This can hurt a lot when suddenly 5-6 adds come flying through the door from the Intersection Room!  So don't let ANYONE open that door unless they ask you first!<br><br>Also, instruct the raid NOW as to what they should do if a mob manages to gate.  You have a couple of different options, depending on how close the spawn point for said-mob is to the Hall of Testing lobby.  If the mob spawns close by (like in the Pit), you could have the melees dive in and fight the mob there.  If the mob's spawn point is farther away, you can also have the raid camp out, the casters gate outside to the entrance of Temple of Veeshan in Western Wastes and then zone back in, or have the druids and wizards do an in-zone evac to the zone-in area of ToV-- then go back to the Hall of Testing lobby and recover the corpses of those who didn't make it out alive.  (Note:  if a necromancer or a shadowknight needs to summon somebody's corpse, the corpse-summoner MUST do it in the Temple of Veeshan zone-in, as that is the only place in the zone that you can summon a corpse!)  Decide on what you're going to do now, so that if the worst happens, people are not standing around waiting to be picked off one by one.  It is easier to recover and rez a couple of bodies than it is to do the same for the entire raid party!<br><br>Now is the time for your raid to switch to their resist gear.  Bump up those cold and fire resists!  I do not care how much AC, strength, etc. your melees lose in bumping up said-resists-- make them do it!  As I stated earlier, you are far more likely to die to an AE than to the mob shredding you with its claws, unless you're the main tank.  Their precious AC will not save them from the mobs' non-melee damage and they will be a bigger drain on the healers' mana as a result.<br><br>Once everyone is in their resist gear, make everyone disband from any groups they're currently in and go /lfg.  Then have your lead cleric group the main tank (it MUST be a warrior), a secondary healer (another cleric, shaman, or druid), the FD puller, and then fill the last two spots with 1-2 melees or an enchanter.  Have the second highest cleric then do the same for the secondary assist (also must be a warrior) and fill out his/her group accordingly.  Once that's done, have the other clerics and healers pick off the rest of the LFGs.  If you have a cleric for each group, great!  If not, let the melees group with the clerics first.  Int casters and secondary healers (druids, shamans) can get away with lighter healing than melees because they can &quot;hide&quot; from most of the AEs, as I'll explain later.<br><br>Buff up, then med to full.  Your raid is almost ready to do the Pit Break.<br><br><br>Part Five: The Pit Break!<br><br>The initial pull will consist of trying to get one of two level level 61+ AEing wurms in the Pit (the area immediately ahead of the drop-off at the bottom of the stairs on both sides) to come solo into the lobby.  This is complicated by the fact that there are two roamers that path through the Pit on occasion, so you should have someone watching for roamers while your puller is trying to bring a solo wurm.  The Pit respawns approximately 75 minutes after a Pit mob is killed, so designate someone to keep track of the time between Pit kills.  Depending on which Pit mob the puller decides to try to pull first, the raid party and the main tank (we discovered) work best if they are positioned in the following manner for the pull:<br><br>If the puller is pulling from side A: hide the raid party around the corner at point B (but do not let them on the area marked &quot;Tiles&quot;!) and put your main tank on point D so the main tank can tag the mob off of the puller.<br><br>If the puller is pulling from side B: hide the raid party around the corner at point A (but do not let them on the area marked &quot;Tiles&quot;!) and put your main tank on point E so the main tank can tag the mob off of the puller.<br><br>The raid party &quot;hides&quot; during the pull because it is less time-consuming to rez the puller and/or the main tank than it is to rez the entire raid if the puller gets more than one mob.<br><br>Once the main tank is certain that the puller only has one mob agroed, the main tank tags the mob and walks it into the middle of the room, so that the mob is centered on point C on my map.  Give the main tank a little time to build agro before you let the melees circle the mob and attack; your wizards will live a lot longer if the main tank has the mob's undivided attention.  Also, don't be afraid to tell the melees to move around if-- while hacking -- they push the mob too close to a wall.  You want to keep the mob centered in the lobby as best as you can to avoid agroing another mob before you are ready for it.  If the mob is damaging your main tank too quickly, the warrior should use their Defensive Discipline asap!<br><br>Meanwhile, the healers and int casters should stay &quot;hidden&quot; because that corner will protect them from most (if not all) of the AEs, and (I have been told) that they can cast quite a few healing, debuff, and damage spells from the &quot;hide&quot; point safely.  I'll be honest right here-- I'm a ranger, I know far more about the melee side of the fight than I do about anything wis and int casters have to deal with.  So I can't really tell you what damage spells will land or what debuffs will stick to what mobs at your level.  I can tell you that when I pay attention to how I'm being healed in the middle of a fight that clerics tend to use complete heals and Divine Light, while the shamans and druids seem to favor Chloroblast.  The main tank tends to get only complete heals from the clerics while the shamans and druids Chloroblast the main tank if they are too low on health, until the CH goes off.  So if you're a caster, I suggest that you talk to a fellow caster of your class who's already fought in ToV about class strategies.  As a melee, I know far more about dealing physical damage and how to handle a mob that is low on health than I know about the most efficient use of your mana.<br><br>A mob that is low on health will react in one of two ways, depending on whether it is a caster or a melee:  it will enrage (if melee) or try to completely heal itself and/or gate (if a caster).  If you've spent time in Kael Arena, you should know how to deal with an enraged mob. For the casters, I suggest the following strategy, as it works quite well for our guild and seems to stop all but the most lucky wurms and drakes from getting off a heal or a gate spell.  We call it a perpendicular push:<br><br>When the mob is at 50% health, order all of your melees to get on the same side as the main tank.  Once the melees are on the same side, the main tank (who if they're doing their job right should still have agro) turns the mob 90 degrees so that the rest of the melees are now attacking the side of the mob.  Keep your melees &quot;pushing&quot; like this until the mob is dead or until you've almost pushed the mob into a wall.  If the mob is too close to the wall, order all but the main tank to switch to the opposite side and push the mob back in the other direction.<br><br>If the mob manages to gate, it will start summoning players on the top of its agro list and kill them one by one, until it regenerates enough health to where it feels brave to come back to the lobby and kill there again.  When it does come back, it might be bringing friends!  This is why you do your damnest to make sure that the mob DOESN'T gate!  Wizards are the raid's best assets in this situation.  There is no such thing as over-nuking with gaters!<br><br><br>Part Six: After The Pit Break!<br><br>Once the front two wurms are dead in the Pit, wait a few moments and tag the two roamers as they pass through the Pit and kill them.  Once the roamers are down, your puller can then go through the right or left doors and bring back static spawn mobs for about 75 minutes from the time the first Pit mob died.  Once the Pit starts respawning, you'll have to clear the two Pit mobs and the roamers again before your puller can go back out into the halls and bring more pulls.  Tell your puller to leave the door that is straight ahead in the Pit alone.  You do not want to mess with Dozekar (if he is on track) and this is your first Hall of Testing raid!  Stick with the non-named mobs for this first raid, until you're comfortable dealing with the normal spawns.<br><br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>By my guild's definition, a &quot;good night in HoT&quot; is when we get at least 10 pieces of armor during a 3-4 hour farming session.  If we're especially lucky, we'll see a pair of legs or a breast plate/robe drop.<br><br>When you are ready to wrap up, it is less time-consuming to port/trans people out of ToV than it is to lead people to the zone out in the West wing.  Besides, if you make them zone out, they'll still be stuck in Western Wastes, which does not exactly have a convenient spires/ring where the non-porters can get a ride back to civilization.  So don't bother with making the raid party zone out unless you all want to explore the West wing.<br><br>This is my first draft of a Hall of Testing raid guide for beginners.  I'd love some feedback if I've missed something or have a suggestion on how I can improve it.  Especially considering that I wrote this and drew the map during a bout of insomnia, heh.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br><b>Kohpry Mossarrow, Warder of the <a href="http://pub69.ezboard.com/bunleashedeq">Unleashed</a>, Povar</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udelaregarwiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DelaregarWiz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/25/02 2:29:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://saedyan.freeservers.com/images/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to Run a Hall of Testing Raid-- For Beginners</span><hr size=1> since I can't see your map, this one might be of help to pullers and just for general knowledge<br><br><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.knightsofthecreed.com/pom/north_tov.jpg">www.knightsofthecreed.com/pom/north_tov.jpg</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Edit: changed the image to a link</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udelaregarwiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DelaregarWiz</A> at: 5/29/02 11:58:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukohpry.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kohpry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<Br>Tunare's Biggest Fan</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/26/02 1:27:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.users.qwest.net/~copperhawk/Ranger.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to Run a Hall of Testing Raid-- For Beginners</span><hr size=1> Bah, server for my webspace is acting funny tonight. /slap ISP  <br><br>Thinking of switching again, they've been dropping me left and right during raids lately.<br><br>EDIT:  There, hope that fixes the problem!
