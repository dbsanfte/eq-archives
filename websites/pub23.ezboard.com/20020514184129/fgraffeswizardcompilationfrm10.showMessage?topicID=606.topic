In other words, this log was taken over a year ago, well before velious but after kunark had been released.  It is a log of a 2 hour and 45 minute session in the courtyard and maze of Cazic Thule.  The initial group was a 25 warrior, 24 shadowknight, 27 Cleric, 25 Cleric, 25 Enchanter, and myself, a 22/23 magician.  After seeing the data and looking back over the log, I discovered that the 25 warrior and 27 cleric both left an hour and a half into the session.  I parsed the first half of the session separately, in addition to the entire log, and that data is listed second.<br><br>This was my first real experience in a 6-man dungeon group.  I had fought in dungeons before, but always with a partner or small group, and I had fought in groups, but always outdoors, so I probably would have done things differently, had I known what I know now.  However, I think this is a decent example of what a normal dungeon group would have been like back before velious.  The warrior had an Executioners Axe, I don't know what anyone else was using.  <br><br>All the pets were mine.  They were either killed in combat or killed by me so that mez would not be broken.  (Remember, this was my first real experience with a good enchanter)<br><br>This log does not include any damage from pet procs, however, I was not likely using pets that had a damaging proc.<br><br>I calculated the time spent in combat by measuring the distance between melee hits, and counting anything longer than 20 seconds as downtime.  This has the obvious flaw of the fact that the log did not include misses, so if a melee went more than 20 seconds without hitting at all, then the parse is erroneous.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Damage</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>(lvlcls ... damage ... av. dps combat ... dps overall) - This is still overall, so might seem wierd because the group changed halfway.<br>25 War ... 14,815 ... 9.37 ... 2.69 (~29% in combat)<br>23 Mag ... 12,698 ... 5.30 ... 1.30 (~24% in combat - based on the 24 SK)(pets(3122) + nukes(8603) + damage shields(945) + melee(28) )<br>24 Shd ... 11,153 ... 4.66 ... 1.13 (~24% in combat)<br>25 Clr ... 5,060 ... 2.96 ... 0.52 (~17% in combat)<br><br>(With pets listed separately)<br>Note:<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Overal damage per second from the pets might look high, because I stopped counting time for a pet after it died.

For those of you that often like to argue that a mage pet is free damage, here are the damage/mana numbers:<br><br>Jenaner = 7.3 damage/mana<br>Gebarab = 2.7<br>Jabarer = 2.4<br>Vonerer = 2.0<br>Xartik = 1.2<br>Unknown ratio on the reclaims..<br><br>Overall damage/mana from pets was 3.9, not counting the reclaimed pets.  If I had spent another 200 mana on summoning reclaiming, then the damage/mana would be closer to 3.  It's still lots better than any nuke in the game, but it's not exactly free melee.  Of course, 200 is the same mana cost for the level 49 pets, so this does change, but at level 20 pets are very expensive to cast.  Also, at level 23, 5 pets is a fairly large number to go through in a group setting, had we been in an outdoor chain-pull groups.  A couple of days after this I was in a very fast pull group in the loio, I wish I had numbers for that too, but unfortunately.. :( .<br><br>I analyzed the nukes by searching for all nukes that hit for 96(max damage on the level 16 shock of flame), then all nukes that hit for greater than 96(would have to be the level 20 Bolt of Flame), and finally all nukes less than 96.<br><br>Hits for 96 = 39<br>Hits for 97+ = 22<br>Hits for &lt;95 = 33<br><br>One final thing I'd like to note for now, is that the pet spells I was using were the level 20 pets, so level 24(1 level away) would have shown a noticeable improvement in damage output and tanking ability.<br> <p><hr align="left"  width="100%"><font face = "Arial" color=00005E><center><b>Goladus Mistrydia</b></font><br><font face = "Arial" color=00005E>55th Conjurer |  <a href = "http://www.darkblood.com">Darkblood</a> |<a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8506">Profile</a> | Solusek Ro</font></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A> at: 11/10/01 4:31:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/11/01 1:26:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=606.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Parsed damage logs from a year ago</span><hr size=1> This log is a group of four players(22 Magician, 15 Magician, 15 Druid, and a Shaman that was at least level 15, but likely higher) camping the 3-spawn of aviak guards in lake rathear.
