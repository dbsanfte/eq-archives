Could an officer please post or repost the rules used for looting on these joint raids (such as Hate).  I think some lively discussion on the subject from each of the guilds might help.  Is it possible the original rules are outdated or members have changed their goals and opinions that would cause a need for these loot rules to change.<br>
<br>
I agree with Swmaestro (hope I spelled that right!) that loot above all else should be based on need.  I currently have one EM bracer, EM arms and EM gauntlets.  My helm and other bracer are from PoG (named Stability) and have equal if not better stats than EM and for boots I use either Gebs for the wisdom or Royal Velium (if Niema hooks me up with insight so I max out wisdom) if I want higher AC.  Having the highest possible wisdom and AC is vital to a cleric, so the last couple Hate raids, I haven't been looking to roll on anything except the breastplate (currently using Seb scale coat) and EM legs (currently using Jarcrap) because these on the only improvements to what I currently have and I know some of the other clerics have a much greater need for EM.<br>
<br>
Its my personal opinion though that someone should not be forced to turn over the armor they are replacing with plane armor.  If they choose to, great, but some don't have the financial luxury to do that.  Selling to a guildie at a large discount is a nice alternative.<br>
<br>
Once again, plane raids are done for bettering the equipment of the guilds and having fun with fellow guildies, not gaining experience or getting cash loot.  No one should take a bath on expenses from buying Hate stones or peridots (enchanters and clerics).  There is typically enough cash loot to cover these expenses, it is a simple matter of discussing the expenses incurred with each person and distributing the loot accordingly.  Don't be shy about it, if you paid for Hate stones or a large supply of peridots, just let the MLer know approximately the amount you need reimbursed. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umenniantheelder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mennian The Elder</A> at: 5/7/01 10:57:55 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uzenknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zenknight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/7/01 11:14:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loot Rules</span><hr size=1> A touchy topic but one that needs to be discussed.<br>

<br>
How do other guilds handle members who only need a few pieces of armor? <br>
<br>
I can see the arguement. Is it fair for Bamil, (who has 0 Indo) to win a BP over Zombei, where Zom won't be rolling on all the items that Bamil will be rolling on. Zom has to hope the BP drops (b/c he won't be rolling on bracer, helm, etc...) and then hope he wins the roll (purely an example, i don't know what Zom needs exactly). I know of guilds using &quot;veteran&quot; statuses an such... how have you seen this to work?? Can it work for the SGA?? Need to get some input on this.<br>

I think we should have veteran status, and that in the case of our hate raid yesterday, Zombei should have been the only one allowed to loot helm/bracers, but shouldn't have been allowed to roll on all other pieces. <p><img src="http://members.home.net/lawrenck/sig.jpg">

Sometimes, when a piece of armor is dropped, instead of rolling on it, it is given to the person who only needs 2 or 3 pieces of planar.  Logically, I guess it makes certain sense since if a person is that close to having a full set of planar, chances are, 4 out of 5 times his armor drops, he'll already have it or have better/equal, therefore can't roll for it.  But, when the piece he needs does drop, he shouldn't be competeing with 5 other people for it since he's not competeing with those 5 for the other pieces which he already have.  The need in this instance is an iffy issue I guess and there will prolly be complaints but the overall idea is that, a newcomer to the plane shouldn't have the same chance in winning a gear which someone else, who has been to the planes 10 times and worked for each piece of planar he has, needs.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udarkseekerajamais.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkseeker Ajamais</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/7/01 12:30:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loot Rules</span><hr size=1> Well let me just bore you and say there are really only two sk that go to raids in the sga and that is telivak and me. When we went to fear raid, my first time, he sent me a tell and we made an agreement that since he hade most of his armor, that instead of rolling, he would get the pieces he needs and i would get the others. I thought it was fair and besides I was just excited to be on raid. I usually pass up on armor if the other person needs that one piece more badly, well look at me you think i am still wearing darkforge cause i look soo damn sexy, come on i look damn sexy in everything i wear. I think that all the clerics or whatever class should send each other tells before the raid and discuss and decide how it should be done for the pieces that drop. Usually if they do this the person just missing a couple of pieces will normally get them automatically and the others will get the rest.  I don't think we should force them to do it, we are all friend and i am sure if they were ask, they would most likely agree.<br>

I have often thought about their system and actually like it fairly well.  Let me try to summarize my understanding of it.  <br>
<br>
In general, no one rolls on an item.  The raid leader selects the recipient of a drop based on (1) Need for the Item (by class) and (2) Merit based on Attendance.  The raid leader keeps track of how many times a certain individual has attended this raid.  Whoever has need and has been there most often gets the item.  In the event that multiple players have need and have participated equally, these players roll.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Veteran Status&quot; is conferred to certain individuals.  My understanding is that if you need 2 items or fewer (say BP and leggings), you are considered to have &quot;veteran status&quot; and you will automatically get any BP's or Legs that drop. In the event that there are multiple &quot;veterans&quot;, these individuals roll for the item.  <br>
<br>
This system is clearly need based, so it should fit in well with our guilds' looting philosophies.  The difference is that luck of the draw is minimized and past contribution to (SGA) raids is recognized.  A further the benefit of this system is that it encourages attendance at our events.  <br>
<br>
A disadvantage to this system is that it places newcomers at a (comparative) disadvantage by limiting the number of pieces they are eligible to roll for.  If we find that we frequently need to enlist the help of a few individuals from outside the SGA for our raids (like Florie at yesterday's hate raid), it may be more difficult to attract them if we use this kind of system.  <br>
<br>
Well, let me close by saying that i am not the architect of the system and if certain details are not stated exactly as they are applied, then i would not be surprised.  However, the above system does make a lot of sense to me in addressing this issue.  <br>

<br>
I actually liked Heaven and Earth's loot system more, the raid leader (typically Evildoer, the GL) decided on who received any armor that dropped.  He would send a tell to each person that could use, find out what they were currently using, then make a judgement call on who needed the item the most.  No rolls were ever done, his decision was final, and there was no further discussion on the subject (i.e. no bitching and sending tells to the raid leader).<br>
<br>
There is a difference at high levels with gear even if it is just a few AC or stats better.  And most of the plane armor has resists that are needed eventually.  But honestly, I don't think SGA people really need to be concerned with minor improvements in AC or resists (we aren't taking Trak down next week, sorry to tell ya).<br>
<br>
All you really need to do is see a couple examples to get an idea on how messed up the current loot rules are.  First example: the first mob killed in Hate on an SGA raid is a cleric of inny that drops the cleric bp.  Should I really be competing with a level 46 cleric on a roll for it?  Especially if that cleric doesn't have any other EM armor, and I have absolutely no use for anything but the bp and legs.  Coupled with the fact that most likely, 5 more pieces of EM armor I don't need will prolly drop (if we clear most of Hate that is).  Second example:  I attend four Hate raids, staying the complete duration of each with no bp drops, the next Hate raid, a lvl 54 cleric in SGA attends for the first time, comes in late, stays a couple hours, and a bp drops.  Should I have to compete with them on a roll for it?  Seems to me the current loot rules would have a roll done in both cases.  If this is truly the case, what is SGA about other than putting together &quot;pickup&quot; raids.  And furthermore, what would be my incentive to join a &quot;pickup&quot; raid for Fear considering I already have the Girdle of the Diligent (the only cleric item that drops there).<br>
<br>
I was under the impression that SGA was about uniting the guilds and bettering each one by creating the ability to do plane and dragon raids without outside help.  Why use a loot rule system designed for a raid comprised of outsiders if that isn't what SGA truly is or wants to be? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umenniantheelder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mennian The Elder</A> at: 5/7/01 9:05:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvainne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/8/01 8:31:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http--braggarts.shareplay.com-pics-Wythe.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loot Rules</span><hr size=1> I have nothing but the utmost respect for all of you, and for that matter for the guildleaders of the guilds that use the merit system.<br>
<br>
I attend ToN raids sometimes, and I suspect I will never, under their system, receive a piece of armour. That is ok. I just like their members.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, if I wanted to be in a guild that was raid and armour and item focused to the extent that the larger guilds on the server are...well...I'd be in one.<br>
<br>
If we were one guild, and not--um 4 now? 5?--the merit system, the vet system might work. As it is, there are too many parties involved...we are many and that is our strength--that is also our weakness.<br>
<br>
The crises in the merit system comes down to this: you are rewarding people for playing alot, and penalizing those that don't. To an extent the high level game does this a fair amount itself...it is the nature of it, that for us to go to Hate someone needs to spend 20+ hours running the show, for us to continue to do high level raids, we have to have that level of dedication...that sucks, but one of the reasons we exist (I thought) was to share that burden, alleiviate it a bit by expanding the responsibilities, by sharing them with each other.<br>
<br>
We have a very high calibar of players, morals-wise. We have a decent amount of &quot;need before greed&quot; peer pressure that also reminds us at all times to put the good of the many before the one. I think that is enough. I think formal rules will cloud this issue enitrely. I think they will be abused.<br>
<br>
I dont see a practical way to apply the merit system in this case. I think the judgement calls are too complicated, and there are too many parties involved for there not to be misunderstandings.<br>
<br>
I realize that it would be galling to lose the last piece of planar you need to a random person that just joined the raid...but...PLEASE...I thought we weren't about loot.<br>
<br>
If our current policy is too much like pick up groups--hm...I'll cut to the chase:<br>
<br>
I am just saying two things here: one--I dont beleive merit will work in multi guild organization. And two: if this is why Hareq is leaving the SGA--and Amnesty--am sorta pissed--at both him and the rest of you.<br>

You have some very valid points Vainne, and the whole point of these discussions is for us to not only speak our own thoughts, but listen to what others say, so that we (which i guess ultimately is the officers) can make the best decision for everyone.<br>
Whatever their decision is be it stay with the status quo, or change loot policies somehow, I will shut up on the subject, and open my mouth next time a topic arises where I have an opinion. <br>
I really can't picture Hareq leaving the SGA because some people differed in opinion with him, but if he did, although I probably would not be mad at him, I would definitely have a what the @#%$? look on my face <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://members.home.net/lawrenck/sig.jpg">

Ouch, poor wording.<br>
<br>
I think in a multi guild alliance it can become very tough to enforce/maintain. It's also complicated and we should learn to walk before running.<br>
<br>
Right now a simple equation for loot should be is (item)  better/worse than (person) has? If (better) then person can roll.<br>
<br>
Later, when we get that simple thing worked out we can take people's comments and refine the system.<br>
<br>
I tend to favor the &quot;all roll&quot; mentality since that makes it easy for now. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uzalliben.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zalliben</A> at: 5/8/01 10:29:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulandyalexandre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LandyAlexandre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/8/01 11:18:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loot Rules</span><hr size=1> I believe that rare items like planar BP's should go to the player(s) who have (just about) all the other pieces.  For although no individual is responsible for the raid as a whole, these players tend to be the ones we need the most in order to be in a plane in the first place.  <br>
<br>
Regardless of the looting rights the SGA ultimately decides to confer to me as a junior member of our planes crew, I pledge to do what i can to see that these items go to &quot;veterans.&quot;  I believe that this is the right decision, but i do not expect or ask others to hold the same opinion.  Whats more, if and when i grow to be a &quot;veteran&quot;, i will NOT ask or expect to have this &quot;privilege&quot; accorded to me.  <br>
<br>
The one thing i do ask is that we all continue to honor and respect each other's differences and strive together as a team.  If we do not, then our planar loot policies will be irrelevant for there will be no planar loot.  <br>

My goal in starting this discussion was to get this out in the open and settled before we have another raid and continuous arguments over it.  A happy median does need to be established with &quot;complete merit system&quot; on the one end and &quot;random rolling&quot; on the other.  Neither of those systems would seem to work with the complex nature of SGA.<br>
<br>
The people like myself that have already spent a considerable amount of time in the planes acquiring good armor are being punished if we are continually forced to roll on the one or two pieces of armor we need.  Likewise, people that are newer or don't have the time to attend each event are being punished if a merit system in instituted.  I have no doubt a system can be established that makes each party happy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> tanvaras</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/8/01 4:57:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE:</span><hr size=1> I agree with Darkseeker(my god how I am going to pay for that one!).

I am still amazed at seeing things selling for 4k and up and I'm even more amazed that people have that kind of cash. The most I have ever had is 1.6k and then I did some research on what I could upgrade to and then went to NFP and did so. I must be doing it wrong though because it seems to me my armor is of low quality for my level. I have never paid 1k for anything, mostly because I would try and get 2 or 3 things for about the same.

I will also expand a bit.<br>
<br>
I may not have a place in this discussion as:<br>
1 I did not go on this hate raid<br>
2 The Dragonchow are not members of the SGA (Hopefully this will change with time)<br>
<br>
But I do have some opinions (obviously) and I do read the SGA board dailey (at least for the last 2 weeks)<br>
<br>
Now, I have a pretty unique perspective on planes gear being a monk, we monks call our Shiverback armor Shivercrap, and most woud only wear the boots other than occasional resist here and there.<br>
<br>
With this in mind here are some of my suggestions/comments/opinions.<br>
<br>
First and foremost, considering that SGA is heading away from the &quot;Open&quot; raids to more controled SGA only raids, there should be at least some rules, senority, and or subjectivity.<br>
Second, all cash loot should be divided by the raid leaders to reimburse the people that spent money. Dont matter what cash loot, blue diamonds, or opals, or ruby crowns, it should go to those that bought the hate stones, peridots, and so on.<br>
Third, those that are attending after the break in, should be bringing their own stone, I had considered checking if me and some of my guild were welcome later in the day on sunday, but if I had, I would have been sure we had our own hate stone.<br>
Fourth on NoDrop gear, I do believe the Raid Leader and certian people, as determined by the raid leader get some loot as default, period. That Zenknight walked away from this entire raid with nothing but a bluediamond is quite sad IMHO.<br>
<br>
Now for my expanding.<br>
<br>
Certain raids have different goals.<br>
Some examples: (Once again I am not trying to tell anyone how to do things, I just consider myself somewhat unbiased do to the lack of need in most instances&quot;<br>
<br>
Zenknights Icewell keep raids:<br>
Of course these should be run and looted as he sees fit, but I believe the raid leader should have the right to divy out loot the way they would like, part of being raid leader. The stated goal of these raids has been better equipment for the SGA as a whole, so looking at the larger picture would be perfect.<br>
<br>
Planes Raids:<br>
Once again, run as the Raid leader wants to, cash loot should go to reimburse those that spend money, clerics, enchanters, hate stone buyers for hete, and so on.<br>
I will also comment on the fear raid where the ToE druid got a piece of planes gear. I would have to say that while a member of the Chow had to give up his droppable item, and this raid was more or less &quot;Open&quot; in nature, I do not feel someone from a guild that can run their own Planes raids should be at an open raid. Now I am not saying anyone did something wrong (except rolling-looting nodrop gear-during combat and without the raid leader saying to) I am just saying the raid was &quot;loose&quot; in nature, so there was little communications.<br>
Now on a raid the RL (raid leader) can be much too busy to divy out loot and settle disputes, there should be a &quot;Loot Boss&quot; designated by the raid leader.<br>
<br>
Thats about all I have for now, and as I have stated in the past, no loot rules are &quot;fair and perfect&quot; and all of this is just my personal take and opinions on the situation.<br>

<br>
Thanks for the post man, Yes you guys could have come up to hate actually as your guild is becomming more and more SGA with every raid you attend. I understand your point about the raid leaders getting first choice, it's hard for me to implement that really for one reason. I could not bring myself to impose a loot rule like that as a raid leader to me it seems selfish for me to do so. <br>
<br>
Although we do raids where one person is after something and it's agreed upon before we go, that kind of decision for a planes raid seems to me to be more of a consensus of the group type decision. Yes I lead hate raids and Icewell raids cause I'm after a particular thing, but I also know that others in the party are after the same. I  would have an ethical problem with personally stating that I get first choice.<br>
<br>
Conversly I do believe in a merit based system. I personally hate randoming for loot, some people are just luckier then others. The problem here is that some people will not show if they figure they will get nothing out of the raid. It's a shame but true. The fix is to make things attendance based there for encouraging people to raid there by ensuring they get loot if they come to ones where they won't. This to is flawed some people can't raid alot and may feel that our loot policy sides with the power gamer that can always be on. But then again the power gamer is more entitiled since he goes to more raids. A vicious cycle.<br>
<br>
We are going to have a guild officer meeting Tuesday about this as one of the issues. Hopefully we can come up with a system that we all can live with and will benefit all.<br>
<br>
This discussion is a good one because it's productive. Keep the ideas comming so that we can discuss your ideas at the meeting.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. I appreciate the Chow Cleric making that right The loot on our raids is NBG and not for resale. I was impressed that he gave it back. I found an SGA cleric that did need it and gave it to him. <br>

I did want to clarify one thing in concern of the Fear raid cleric belt thing.<br>
Kappaphi was wearing a crystalline belt, that he had on loan from me, and once he received that belt in Fear he had already given me back the Crystalline belt, so while his need might not have been as big as someone else, there was never a greed issue IMHO.<br>
<br>
Now I am just clarifying how it happened, I have no issues with it, I considered it to be a SGA before pickups thing, and we had accepted this, so lets move on.<br>
<br>
Hopefully in the near future, Dragonchow will be SGA members.<br>

one thing i would suggest is maybe /telling the people who are about to roll the stats. i didnt know anything about that belt, i just heard clerics roll, got stoked and randomed. i looted it and it was pretty much not what i thought planes loot would be. so i figured, maybe someone could use it more than me. my only intention was to at least get my roll back. thats all i wanted. besides that, i figured maybe another cleric would buy it for maybe 300pp, i mean just enough to cover peridot purchases. i would have, and did, give it away to anyone who needed. however, zenknight, i take MAJOR offense to basically calling me out as a farmer in /shout. that is a /tell thing man. and to insinuate that someone goes to planes to farm? come on man... what 1/1000 is not no drop? any one whos met me can tell you i spend countless hours at camps i have nothing to gain at. @#%$ last night i went to kedge with lyris for mermaid hair. im 51 and wear a CCS for crissakes. im sorry i didnt need that belt, but before i rolled if you would have just /told me the stats this whole thing would have never gone this far.<br>

<br>
Ok here we go. I did not shout out kappaphi is a farmer. I shouted out some time later, about a few kills actually that loot is need before greed and we are not rolling for stuff to sell. Loot was announced as Need Before Greed from the start. The only reason I knew you didn't need the belt is because the cleric said in group that you sent him a tell asking if he wanted to buy it. I did not name you in the shout but we had alot of non SGA people on that raid and I wanted to make a clear point to everyone at once to make sure we were all clear on that. You handed me the belt and I gave it to a cleric that could use it. As far as I was concerned all was right with the world.<br>
<br>
I'm really sorry you took offense to that. We all took offense to the fact that need before greed is a staple loot rule and when the tell came to our cleric asking if he wanted to buy it, well we all took offense. These things happen, after my shout (which did not name you or the item) you gave it to me and I thought this was over. If this is a sticking point for you, well I don't know what to tell you.<br>
No one thinks your a loot hound. I explained to everyone how you gave it back and no one holds this against you. Then again I'm not gonna apologize for the way I handled it either. I didn't name you directly and didn't name the item.<br>
<br>
You could have just stated in /ooc ot /tell that you couldn't use it and yes we would have given your roll back.<br>
<br>
Rabbizz No it wasn't an SGA first then pickup thing, All that go on our raids get the chance to loot the only difference being a 1 hour rule that applies to late comers.<br>

Only now since Hate has this seemed to become a major point of contention amongst us.<br>
<br>
I must preface this by saying I have been in Hate more than ayone else save Myriah, and have yet to loot one piece of insidious wear. Now if I could only come up with anything to replace that /random business cause we all know that I just have bad luck that way. But as of yet I cant, that having been said this is how I feel about looting.<br>
<br>
Everyone who shows up and stays for the duration of a raid should have the opportunity to roll on that which drops of their class. There are some of us who basically have to show up at every raid in order for it to go off. One thought on how to compensate that is an extra roll on one piece of said persons gear, to be announced proir to rollingby raid leader or assistant. As for latecomers one hour rule.<br>
<br>
My idealistic hippieish wish would be for classes present to discuss amongst themselves if any major pieces should go to certain &quot;vets&quot; that would benefit more than they could. Perhaps unrealistic it's what we've for the most part always done in my little flock. I've seen members of all our guilds performing random acts of selflessness so it may not be as unrealistic as i think.<br>
<br>
What I feel should be most concentrated on by our raiding at all should be teaching those who havent much experience how best to accomplish raid goals. When is it we got soo far away from this.<br>
<br>
 Loot has never mattered to me. Sure I want my halo and my robe and am bummed when I always roll a 3 or 12 on it but thats the breaks. I've always gone on raids to help people and find new and interesting things to kill and be killed by.<br>
<br>
 I mean I'm happiest in this game when I'm a little over my head in a situation that could wipe us all out. Thats the excitement and fun in this game is(for me anyway). Particularly in hate due to its gruelingly long nature we just dont seem to be having much fun. We need to find some way to quit the bickering during and post raid and have some fun with it. If we cant then we should not go back up there until we've matured more.<br>
