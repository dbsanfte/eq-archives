Can I solo well?  Hell yes, do I do good in a group (if I have a chanter/bard)?  Hell yes.  Do I think we're broken?  *NO!*  <br>
<br>
We need some fine adjustments here and there, but aside from that our class is good enough as is.  Anything else they decide to do would only be icing on the cake.  If you all didn't love playing wizards, why the hell would you sit here and bring down those of us that do just because *YOU* don't feel adequate?<br>
<br>
Wizzy's are god, without us I guarintee you that big mobs wouldn't die.  We're a 100% must on all the &quot;high end&quot; game.  The low end game?  Big deal, so you can't get a group in Guk because all you do is bitch and complain about how you suck.  If you were someone in a group, would you really wanna invite someone who says time and time again how much they suck?  I don't think so, and I hope you wouldn't either.<br>
<br>
Now, on to what I think could help the class (or at least be nicer)<br>
<br>
Translocate - This is a great spell but 1 thing.  Loose the group requirment.  Keep the confirmation box up, but really, drop the groups.  Also, add in a translocate to *EVERY* wiz port in the game.  This will do nothing but save all of us countless hours of time.<br>
<br>
New Spells - I believe they should have 2 new &quot;lines&quot; of spells for all 3 elements.  1 spell line has a better ratio than draught of ice (DoI is 3.4 damage per mana) but *ONLY* effects level 50+ creatures.  Maybe 3.75 damage per mana?  This would be a new &quot;loot&quot; drop from uber mobs accross the world.  Perhaps Trakanon could have something like this, added to his random drop table (in addition to BP's)  Will it make soloing easier?  Nope.  You don't solo level 50+ critters...  you get summoned and die.<br>
<br>
the 2nd line would have a slightly higher ratio than that one.  perhapse... 4.0 damage per mana.  This spell would *ONLY* effect creatures level 60 or higher, and have a lure based resist (or slightly less).  This would be a great spell line for the likes of Dain to drop.  Would it make soloing easier?  Well, if you can solo a level 60 mob, I'd like to give my account to you.<br>
<br>
Also fixing bind sight would be a nice change.  That was a great spell to play with.<br>
<br>
Aside from that, no we're fine as is.  Those are my suggestions.  Are they overpowering?  Honesly, I don't think so, but that's just my perspective.<br>
<br>
If you feel the need to flame me, don't bother as I won't respond to a flame.  But please, *STOP* being children.  We're not broken so stop trying to force everyone into thinking we are.<br>
<br>
The key to our demise is in ourselves.  This is also the key to our salvation. <p><font size=2> <P align=center>

If you mean Kunark dragons and bosses as &quot;high end&quot; game, you have a half point.  If you mean Velious, you're absolutely, positively, incorrect. The only must have in those groups is a cleric and a tank/melee type.<br>

Lower Guk is a place where wizzies are great. Even with twinkage I think we do fine in lower guk...only been there a few times though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Simply not true. <br>
<br>
I think the best example of this is the Nsgy raid my wizard went on when he was just a pixel short of 53.  I was the only wizard on the raid.  There was 1 mage, 3 enchanters and no necros.  The rest of the raid was 27 meleers, 6 clerics and 5 druids/shaman.<br>
<br>
Nagy went down in 38 seconds.  I never cast a single spell during battle.<br>
<br>
The _only_ high end mob that wizards make a significant and worth while difference on is Venral Sathir.<br>
<br>
<br>
What you say is true if, and ONLY if, there are not an abundance of meleers and healers available.  But that is not the way EQ is.  EQ is swimming in healers and meleers, this is especially true since druids and shaman got a significant boost in thier healing effectiness.  When you have plenty of healing the need for fast spell damage is negated.  This is even further agrivated by the fact that there are melee classes that can deliver damage faster and more consistently than wizards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uikeya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ikeya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/01 1:04:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ummm...</span><hr size=1> Honestly... indulge me as to where I might be useful on a Velious-uber mob raid.

Yes, there are problems with Wizards.  Some minor, some not so.  <br>
<br>
I liked the news post that said... &quot;I hate to say this, but it might be possible that part of the reason that a wizard might not be getting invited to groups is that you've spent so much time telling everyone how you aren't useful… It's hard to tell the sequence of events here, it's a chicken and the egg thing. But I often worry that this might be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Tell enough people that you're not useful and they will believe you.<br>
<br>
This may not be true, but I worry about it nonetheless.&quot;<br>
~Abbsor<br>
<br>
Maybe we convince ourselves we aren't good against mobs and in so doing, the masses.  I personally love my wizard.  I enjoy the class, if I can't find a group...I Solo.  If I am not in the mood to solo, I find other folks that are LFG and say &quot;Hey wanna go to X?&quot;  As a &quot;Taxi&quot; I can make a pickup group and take them where I want to go.  We have some great strengths as well as weakness.  Why not focus on our strengths?  I didn't create my wizard to compete with a warrior or a monk or a mage or a necro or a... I made my Wizard to have fun.  If you don't have fun with your wizard, I mourn the loss of another brother or sister.<br>

The reason for this is no more uber-AEs. Vindicator does not cast AEs, Klandicar does not AE, the Statue of Rallos Zek does not AE, nor does Dain Frostreaver. Zlandicar has 2 diseased based AEs that do little-to-no damage IF they even hit. In Veeshan's Peak and the Kunark Dragons Wizards need clerics on most of the dragons because they all have evil raid-killing red-bar reducing Area Effect spells. Why is this good? I can wear all my mana/hp gear without having to switch to resist gear in most cases. This translates to more nukes over the long run and the ability to use the nuke-casting uber-items because of the long fights.  <p><P align=center>

As for 40's groups, grinding away at experience.  Without a bard and/or chanter do you really think that we are as/more effective than another rogue/warrior/monk would be in that same group in the long haul (say an hour)?  I personally feel this is not the perception in Norrath.<br>

Avoid these foolish extremes and we'll find something useful. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamadhibots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samadhi BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/01 1:47:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At what point did we all become pre-schoolers?</span><hr size=1> ((I think the proper line to walk is between saying &quot;Wizards suck!!!! we NEVER get groups!!! we are totally useless!!!&quot; and saying &quot;Wizards rule!!! we roxor and are great in any group!! we need no work!!! leave my Wizard alone!!!&quot; because neither is true.))<br>

I would have to agree. We are NOT as bad off as some of you make us to be, but we also still need some improvements. All classes can use adjustments and changes, we're no exception. <p><P align=center>

Sure its rough finding a group at times, but finding a group is hard on many others as well with the server overcrowding that is going on lately. Sure, clerics, chanters, and a melee are a must, but do i feel like i hinder a group? No. I have just as hard a time getting my monk and warrior into a group as i do with my wiz, so there isnt much argument there from me. I believe many people have said this before, but ill say it again, If you want to get a group and not sit lfg for hours, make your own group. Its not that hard to do, go in whatever zone you want to do, /shout xx wiz lfg, if no tells..../shout camp check. Pretty simple really. <br>
<br>
I cant say we are completely balanced, but I think most of the things are minor. I dont feel useless in velious even, sure I havent done many big mobs there, but the few ive been to, i didnt feel that way. Keep telling other people we suck, and its not gonna get any better. Whenever i join a group, I get things like &quot;ok lets get something a bit harder, or now we have some damage thats gonna keep us steady. It feels good to hear that, and I come here and see the complete opposite. I think also one of these 2 guys were stating about not being able to get into a group in guk, I notice alot of the people here complaining about damage are still green and dont realize what they really have. I know when i was in my 30's, I hated people telling me that I didnt know half the time what i was doing, but you know what? They were right. I'll re-iterize it a bit. I can honestly say you might think you know what you are doing, but you dont know much about your class in your 30's. Hell, even today I learn something new every once in awhile. <br>
<br>
If you want to complain and whine because you arent having fun with your class, thats ok no problem. Some of us still are having fun so dont ruin it for all of us. If you want to say we are completely broken and that we suck, maybe you are doing something wrong? This is my say and somewhat a rant, but it needed to be said and of course is just my humble wizzie opinion. <p><table style=filter:glow>Xandollf Truefyre<br>54th Channeler of Bristlebane<br>Ill Tempered Sea Bass</table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujadrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jadrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/01 2:49:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At what point did we all become pre-schoolers?</span><hr size=1> I Think Xarp is slightly viewing our class through rose coloured glasses.<br>
But then im an old jaded pessamist where as he has the enthusiasm of the young.<br>
Also his guild is much bigger and more organised than mine, so he has a lot more experience of the high end of velious than me.<br>
<br>
mmm, hang on, why do i like the guy again? ;o)<br>
<br>
---<br>
But Seriously...<br>
We have problems, so lets try to analise them, and get them fixed without overexagurating, or putting our own class down.<br>
<br>
I still belive that Mages, Rangers, Shadow Knights still *Much* worse off than us. Where as Necros, Druids, Shammies and Pallies are on our level. Its just that people focus on the strong classes of Warrior, Monk, Rogue, Enchanter and Cleric.<br>
<br>
To Sum up Its not just Wizards that are Broke, its EQ itself.<br>

I also agree that it is EQ that is &quot;broken&quot; and that the current mob design has reduced the necessary classes to the warrior, cleric, rogue/monk, and chanter and this affects ALL the other classes not listed. The upping of HP by extreme amounts and the resistances of those mobs as well accounts for the majority of this in regards to Velious. I think that the adjustments made should be minor but we will see where they go.<br>
<br>
And, do have fun with your wizard. I love taking mine to cazic or Mistmoore with a chanter friend and young bard to see how big we can get the train <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Also go popping around the world and explore and remember back how much fun you had on the journey. I sat on top of the Aviak tower in Lake rathe the other day and watched the pretend sunset by the blue flame and it was very nice....<br>
