I got this information from various sites and edited it together so it would make more sense.  Enjoy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>5th Shawl<br><br>You go to the temple and ask the Loremaster. &quot;How can I further advance my reputation with the Coldain?” He tells you that he doesn't have the stuff or time to give you another shawl and he sends you to speak to Rexx Frostreaver at the bank.<br><br>&quot;What Prayer Shawl?&quot;<br>Rexx gives you a container and tells you to do the following:<br><br>1: Collect Crystaline Spider Threads and make 5 strands of Crystaline silk thread.<br><br>They are dropped in Velketors Lab off of crystalline spiders.  The crystalline spiders that see through invisibility drop the 75 threads you will need.  <br><br>2: Combine 5 of the Crystalline Spider Threads in a large sewing kit or Coldain Tanners kit to make a Crystaline silk Fiber.<br><br>3: In the container you're given, combine glowing shardwurm bile with 3 fibers to make a glowing Crystaline silk.<br> <br>To find the Bile, you need to hunt shardwurms in the Great Divide.  After you get 5 of the Glowing Crystalline Silk Pieces you take those 5 and your 4th Shawl and combine them together and hopefully with enough skill you can make the shawl<br><br>4: Combine 5 of these silks with your prayer shawl in a sewing kit to make the Silk Coldain Prayer Shawl and take it back to Rexx Frostreaver at the bank for inspection. <br><br>At 115 the combination was trivial.<br><br>All recipes other than the crystalline silk require the use of the Coldain Tanners Kit, instead of a large sewing kit. The crystalline silk can use either the Coldain Tanners Kit or a Large Sewing kit.  You can find a Coldains Tanners Kit from Betti Frostweaver (bank).<br><br>If you fail you on the last step you lose all the items except your 4th shawl<br>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ <br><br>6th Shawl<br><br>Now for the 6th Shawl. You need 1 Woven Giants Beard, 2 Siren Hairs, 2 Manticore Manes, and 2 Drakel Dire Wolf Whiskers.<br><br>First go to Betti Frostreaver and say 'What embroidered prayer shawl' she will hand you a pattern that is used for the 6th step.<br><br>Next go to GD near the Wizard Spires near Eastern Wastes zone and kill the Wolves that pat around there. Most of the time you'll find someone killing them for faction with the Codian. It's a semi common drop but is No Drop. While your killing those Wolfs /Auc your buying a Woven Giants Beard. It is Lore so most of the time someone will let you loot one off a giant or will give you one if they sell it to you the common price is about 50 plat for one. I got both whiskers in about 20 mins and the beard during that 20 mins. <br><br>Next zone over to Eastern Wastes, a tracker is helpful during this step. You need to hunt down 2 manticores and hope they drop their manes. The Manticore Mane is not no-drop so you can purchase one if your lucky, or find a merchant selling one.  Manticores roam the entire zone. They are most common near the Great Divide zone area, but they are still semi uncommon to find. Normally only 2-3 Manticores  are up in the whole zone. I killed 6 manticores and got 4 manes.  They were blue con at level 49. <br>Lastly, killing Sirens. Head or Gate to Cobalt Scar. There is 2 main areas. These are behind the Skyshrine ramp, and down at the waters edge you can see 3 from above. There is another 2 in the water a little bit deeper. Near the Sirens Grotto Cave, underwater there is 4 guarding the cave.  Bring a group with you if you can. The Sirens are Enchanters and will Charm your friends and nuke you also. The camp near the Skyshrine ramp is easier to pull and kill.  I killed 18 of them and looted 8 hairs. <br><br>Now place the beard, 2 manes, 2 whiskers, and 2 hairs into the kit.  This will make thread. Now place your thread, your 5th Shawl, and the pattern your got earlier and click combine. This will make your 6th Shawl. If you fail you WILL get your 5th shawl back. I failed then went around and recollected the items and got them back in less then 2 hours. My skill improved when I made the 6th Shawl to (129), so it is not trivial at that skill level.  <br><br>Here is a link to see the 6th Shawl<br><!--EZCODE CODE START--><pre> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=6078">eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=6078</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--></pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br>_ _ _ _  _ _  _ _ __ _ _ _  _ _  _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _  _ _ _ _ _ _ <br><br>7th Shawl<br><br>Start out by showing your 6th shawl to Betti Frostweaver in the Thurgadin Exchange. <br><br>Betti Frostweaver says 'Spectacular artistry! I doubt I could have done better myself. You'll have to forgive me, I know time is short and I tend to carry on. This is the pattern for the making of a rune sacred to our people. It will be our final test of your craftsmanship and will put many of your skills to the test, but I trust you'll find the finished product to be more than worth the effort. Show Gilthan the silk shawl, he will set you on the path. May Brell always be with you outlander. <br><br>Now show your shawl to Gilthan. <br>Gilthan Brittleblade says 'So, you've been chosen to attempt the rune, eh? Been ages since anyone's even made an attempt. The rune represents the very essence of our people, our culture, and our religion. Take a sea shell runed with enduring breath and a small brick of velium and grind them together in a mortar and pestle. Add water to the powder and model the rune. Fire the rune with water and the best of firing sheets. Show the product to Trademaster Kroven. <br><br>Head off to Siren's Grotto and kill Sirens until you get a Runed Sea Shell with 1 charge of Enduring Breath. It has to be a Runed Sea Shell with 1 charge of Enduring Breath.  It is not LORE or NO DROP. <br><br>Combine the Sea Shell and a small brick of velium in a Mortar and Pestle which you can buy from a rogue vendor. I have no idea what skill check this is but it was trivial to me. I'm assuming it was pottery. <br><br>Result: Enchanted velium powder: LORE Trivial at Pottery 188 <br><br>Combine the powder and water in a pottery wheel. <br><br>Result: Unfired Rune: LORE Trivial at Pottery 188 <br><br>Combine the rune a high quality firing sheet and water in a kiln. <br><br>Result: Blank rune: MAGIC LORE NO DROP <br>Trivial at Pottery 188 <br><br>Now show the rune to Trademaster Kroven also in the Thurgadin Exchange. <br><br>Trademaster Kroven says 'Fine piece of work there, Adorean, especially fer an outlander. Now yer gunna need to make a burin to etch the rune with. Once that's done ye need to kneel in the chapel and recite this prayer with total sincerity in yer heart. If yer plea be heard by our Father Brell he'll bless ya with the knowledge necessary to carry on. With that knowledge you'll take the blank rune, the burin and a fletching kit to etch the rune. Show Grimthor the etched rune and he'll guide you from there. <br><br>He gives you a: Prayer to Brell: LORE NO DROP <br><br>You say, 'what burin' <br><br>Trademaster Kroven says 'You'll need a fletching kit and a fair bit of skill for this one, Adorean . Round up a tooth from a swordfish and attatch it to an Ulthork tusk wrapped in a Molkor hide. <br><br>Head to Siren's Grotto and get a swordfish tooth from the swordfish and a molkor hide from the molkors. You can also get ulthork tusks there but they're much easier to get in eastern wastes where you can kill the low level ulthorks for their tusks. The swordfish tooth is NO DROP which is the only item actually forcing you to go into SG. <br><br>Combine the tusk, swordfish tooth, and hide in a fletching kit. <br><br>Result: Burin: LORE NO DROP Trivial at Fletching 194 <br><br>Go to the room where the quest started with the Grand Historian and wander around spamming the following prayer until you see a message saying you've been inspired. <br><br>You say, 'Oh Brell, Thank you for protecting me and seeing me through my trials. Forgive me for the things I think and say and do that displease you. Please reveal to me your will and bless me with the patience and obedience to do that which you desire. Amen.' <br><br>You have been inspired. The sacred pattern of the Coldain rune materializes on the ground before you. <br><br>On the floor in front of the Historian was a Etched Rune pattern: LORE ITEM NO DROP <br><br>Combine the pattern, burin, and rune in a fletching kit. <br><br>Result: Etched Rune: MAGIC LORE NO DROP <br>Trivial at Fletching 194 <br><br>Go show your Etched Rune to Grimthor by the brew barrel in Thurgadin. <br><br>Grimthor Brewbeard says 'That looks about right. You're moving along well outlander. Next you'll be needin to brew up a sacred ink to fill the grooves in your rune. Take Iceclad Cutlass fish oil, liquid velium, and some Royal Kromrif blood, brew them in the barrel here then take the product and the rune and combine them in a fletching kit. Show Talem Tucker the resulting item if yer successful. <br><br>You say, 'what cutlass fish oil' <br><br>Grimthor Brewbeard says 'Grab a pole and fish the waters in Iceclad until you catch yourself three Iceclad Cutlass fish. Place them in this oil extractor and you'll have whatcha need. <br><br>You say, 'what liquid velium' <br><br>Grimthor Brewbeard says 'Collect a small piece of velium and a bottle of rubbing alcohol and brew them together in a barrel. It aint easy, but it should prove to be a minor task for the likes of you. <br><br>He gives you: Fish oil extractor 4 slot container LORE NO DROP <br><br>Fish in Iceclad until you get 3 Cutlass fish and combine them in the extractor. <br><br>Result: Cutlassfish Oil: LORE Trivial at Brewing 168 <br><br>You need to go to the Mortician in Cabilis and buy rubbing alcohol. Luckily I have an iksar who picked it up for me. <br><br>Combine the rubbing alcohol and a small piece of velium in a brew barrel. <br><br>Result: Liquid Velium: LORE Trivial at Brewing 168 <br><br>Combine the Liquid Velium, Fish Oil and a Royal Kromrif Blood (LORE) from Kael in a brew barrel. I don't know which mob drops the blood as guild members who'd been hunting there already had some. <br><br>Result: Sacred Velium Ink: LORE NO DROP <br>Trivial at Brewing 168 <br><br>Combine the ink and rune in a fletching kit. <br><br>Result: Velium etched Rune: MAGIC LORE NO DROP Trivial at Fletching 194 <br><br>Go to the jewelry store in Thurgadin by the Exchange. Show your rune to Talem Tucter. <br><br>Talem Tucter says 'I've heard of your mission, Adorean . I must admit that I had my doubts you'd make it this far. The rune's creation is nearly impossible for even the most skilled of Coldain craftsmen. You should be exceedingly proud. Many have attempted this feat and nearly all have lacked the skill, faith, patience and persistence that is prerequisite for what destiny holds in store for you. You are now ready to use this pattern to construct the sacred rune's casing and complete the runed shawl. <br><br>You say, 'what casing' <br><br>Talem Tucter says 'Combine two platinum bars, a small piece of velium and the casing pattern in a Jeweler's kit. Take the completed casing and the rune and combine them in the same kit. When this is done all that's left is to tailor the rune to the shawl with the pattern. Take the finished product to Borannin, I'm sure he's eager to speak with you. <br><br>Combine the pattern he gives you, a small piece of velium and two platinum bars in a jewelry kit. <br><br>Result: The casing. Trivial at Jewel Craft 182 <br><br>Combine the Casing and your Rune in a jewelry kit. <br><br>Result: Encased Velium etched Rune: MAGIC LORE NO DROP Trivial at Jewel Craft 182 <br><br>Combine the Encased Velium etched Rune, the original pattern Betti Frostreaver gave you at the beginning, 6th shawl and combine it in a tailoring kit<br><br>Here is a Link to see the 7th Shawl<br><!--EZCODE CODE START--><pre> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=6079">eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=6079</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--></pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br><br> Go to Loremaster Borannin and show him your 7th shawl. <br><br>Loremaster Borannin says 'Incredible! Never before has an outlander been skilled and determined enough to craft our sacred rune. You are now worthy of the Dains most perilous tasks. One is being prepared for you as we speak, please check back with me soon and I will outline the details for you.

About 15 seconds (with jboots) after you leave bridge stop.  there are a good deal of manticores in this area.  I see them all over with the mammoths.  Would guess there are at least 10 in the zone at any given time, so they're not rare.  They are rare near GD though.  <br><br>As for the sirens, there are 3 spots in CS. The SG spot which has 4 I think, the spot directly beneath tower by ulthorks, which has 3 above water, and 2 below. And then the spot right behind that on other side of cliff.  One Siren spawns on a rock along the ledge wall and can be pulled solo.  2 other sirens spawn in the water on a rock near that and can be pulled solo if you're high enough. This is the best place to camp them because you dont' have to worry about double pulls. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usaedyan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saedyan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/17/02 7:58:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Spoiler for Shawl #5 through #7</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the info Srobin.
