<br>
<br>
MISSION:  It is the goal of the Saryrn Guild Alliance (SGA) to allow it’s members the ability to keep the individuality which makes their guild unique. The alliance will enable it’s members to embark on journeys they would otherwise not even think to attempt with the resources of only one guild. By retaining membership in SGA, smaller guilds can continue to remain a size that accommodates the guild, without sacrificing the opportunities that a larger guild would offer. Above all the SGA is designed to add an aspect of fun and excitement to the game while keeping intact the close friendships that make this game special.<br>
<br>
RULES: Members of the SGA will be held accountable by their own guild’s charter and set of rules.<br>
<br>
INVITATION: The SGA is not a static organization. We will continue to expand membership for as long as the members find this viable. Guilds wishing to join the SGA should:<br>
<br>
1) Post interest on the SGA message board with a link to the guild website as well as an email address of the contact.<br>
<br>
2) Within one week they should expect to hear from the SGA Chairman or an SGA Diplomat and begin dialogue.<br>
<br>
3) Members will be added on basis of merit. When the SGA members find it is the right time to add new members to the organization we will compile all applicants and discuss them individually.<br>
<br>
4) The interested guilds will be contacted and informed of the council’s decision.<br>
<br>
THE SGA COUNCIL:<br>
<br>
The purpose of the SGA Council is to ensure that the interests of each guild are being represented fairly. Matters that will be decided by the council include: The order of priority of proposed raids/events; decide disputes between SGA members; accept or deny the application of a new member to the Alliance. If necessary the council has the responsibility to be a catalyst for SGA events.<br>
<br>
1) Each guild will provide 1 diplomat. This will be the primary decision maker for their guild. They will act as the contact to discuss interguild relations involving the alliance.<br>
<br>
2) The diplomats will be chose by the representative’s respective guild in any manner that guild sees fit and will remain the diplomat for as long as the guild determines appropriate.<br>
<br>
3) The council will select a chairman. The chairman has the power to act as the “final word” to settle any disputes. The chairman will be the primary contact for guilds outside the SGA and will be the public “face” to the Saryrn community.<br>
<br>
4) Each vote from the diplomats counts equal regardless of guild size. The chairman will vote only in order to break ties that may occur or to settle issues that have grown stagnant or have found no compromise.<br>
<br>
MEMBER RESPONSIBLITIES:<br>
<br>
As a member of the SGA you are expected to follow the code of conduct established by your individual guilds. At SGA raids you are to listen to the leader and follow his or her every command (even if it sounds completely insane).  After the raid is a time for critique not during. Should any dispute arise between yourself and anyone inside or outside of the SGA contact an officer of an SGA guild immediately to mediate. These officers will escalate to the SGA diplomats and to the chairman as necessary. <br>
<br>
You are encouraged to be active on the SGA members board as well as the raid events calendar. You should seek out SGA members and group with them even in xp situations. This will enable better communication and unity when conducting our large scale raids.<br>
<br>
RAID GUIDELINES:<br>
<br>
1) Any member of the SGA is encouraged to set up and host a raid of any level. There are several veterans of this game that are experienced setting up events. Contact these members for advice on running your raid.  Learning how to run a raid is not a skill you can train at your guildmaster in Qeynos upon obtaining level 50. It takes practice and the willingness to attempt and can be accomplished at any level.<br>
<br>
2) The raid leader or host has FULL discretion regarding his raid in ALL aspects. It is his or her responsibility to advertise the raid and ensure it is on the SGA calendar. The rules of the raid are to be explicitly stated in advance to leave no room for dispute or bitterness. <br>
<br>
3) As a member of the raid you are to listen to your raid leader. You are not to use the /shout channel and the /ooc channel should be used sparingly and only when necessary. That being said, raids are to be fun, enjoy yourself at an SGA raid, just not at the expense of others enjoyment. Ask questions to your GROUP leader first. If they cannot answer they will contact the raid leader or secondary leader for clarification and disseminate the information back to the groups.<br>
<br>
<br>
LOOT GUIDELINES:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Clerics/Enchanters/Raid providers (hate stone buyers) are compensated with cash and plat loot for reimbursement. It is the raid leaders responsiblity that this happens.<br>
<br>
2. All loot will be assigned on a need before greed basis. Need = You WILL equip the item over what you are currently wearing/using. If you are wielding a Lamentation you better have a good reason why you are claiming Need on the Yak that just dropped. If more than one person claims need on an item you are to /ran 100, highest roller wins the item. If you win an item you will not roll on another item until all members that claim need have received something on the particular raid you are attending. <br>
<br>
3. Puller and Raid leader will be compensated appropriately<br>
<br>
4.  All other compensation will be left to the raid leaders discretion (such as rogue scouter etc.)<br>
<br>
5. We will institute a 2 piece rule for planes armor. If you need only 2 pieces or less of armor you are to instruct the raid leader before the raid of what 2 pieces these are. Should those pieces drop, you will loot that armor with no competition. If there is more than one person of your class that needs less than 2 pieces of armor and needs the piece that dropped... you /random with that person.<br>
<br>
6.  If you arrive late to a raid you are not allowed to roll on loot for one hour. After this you may roll on loot  normally.<br>
<br>
7. ALL SGA xp GROUP: In an all SGA xp group, loot is given out on a need before greed basis. All who need will /random for the item. If no one needs all will /random.<br>
<br>
8. SGA/non-SGA mix xp GROUP: Should you be in an SGA/non-SGA mix xp group you are to follow the group leaders set rules. Should you as an SGA member be the leader it is suggested that the outlines in 1 and 2 are followed.<br>
<br>
9. The raid leader will have FULL discretion on all loot issues but must stay with in the boundaries provided in the charter. The raid leader will decide who cash loots are to be given to and how specific items should be handled.<br>
