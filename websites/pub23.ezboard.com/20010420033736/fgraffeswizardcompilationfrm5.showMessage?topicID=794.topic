The risk -vs- reward for this item sucks. By the time a Wizard gets one of these they are most likely always surrounded by a high level Cleric when anything dangerous is near. Also throw in some Bards, a Chanter and maybe a Necro who's FM and whats the big deal? It seems the best case scenerio to use this staff's effect is when soloing. And here I thought Verant always tried to prevent people from soloing.<br>
<br>
Since the quest doesn't require going after anything out of the Ordinary I suppose it will be casually done. CT, Phinny and Venril are all on a regular rotation so eventually any ole Wizard will get this and not even be trying. Keck just show up for the raid.... Epic? I think not!<br>
<br>
Atleast its good stats for a 1 handed item.<br>

Hey maybe this staff of the four have a secret effect like the warrior FA, you double click on the staff and you have 2 1H Staff :<br>
-&gt; the first one is a Summon PP effect ( cause it seem than all peaple who think that the effect is nice said : &quot; its nice effect it save peridots and money&quot;.<br>
<br>
-&gt; the second one is 10 000 HP buff recast 1 second free mana, and stackable ( cause it seem than all peaple who think that is a good effect said : &quot;cool i will be able to tank more during fight&quot;.<br>

<br>
A manatap? that would not help me on a raid, as is on VP dragons, I hardly go below 20% mana and that is with nonstop nuking and the odd manaskin tossed in.<br>
<br>
A stun? again, that will do me no good in a VP/raid situation, as most of the monsters I fight would be non-stunnable.<br>
<br>
A nuke? nope, I can get a nuke staff and a nuke robe from VP, why would I want that on my FA staff? would seem a tad pointless to me.<br>
<br>
A clarity? While it would help for exping and soloing, it would be useless on a raid situation, I dont spend any mana buffing other people and have no prob being FM before the fight, unless is tstacked with clarity 2, it would be pretty useless.. and I doubt verant would make a good clarity that would stack with C2 and the bard song.<br>
<br>
A shield skin? Great effect for raids where dragons spit out high-damage AOEs, the near 800 extra HP can reduce the inital damage of some of those AOES by 50%, msot of them less then 50%, but when I am standing there w/o ruin and an AOE takes me right out from near FH .. I'll take any sort of extra skin I can get to make a barrier between me and the dirt. Great effect for high-end raids, so-so usefull when soloing and moderatly usefull when exping. Possibly now you &quot;I never get hit&quot; wizards can now afford to nuke a bit more pull your weight a bit better and not be a drain on your clerics mana *G*<br>
<br>
The only other possible effects I can think that would be anywhere near usefull on a raid or exp group, is if the staff increased our damage on our spells by 25%, or reduced the casting time .. but I am not sure if that is within the limits of Verants system.<br>
<br>
When all things concidered, the barrier of foce is the most usefull effect for a high-level raiding wizard. Now, if they made it castable on others that would be a HUGHE improvment.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucylus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cylus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>11/21/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>10:06:58 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://megababy.com/niggergook/bdrunk295.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: ...</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Don't bother, Zurren...they will find anything to bitch about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#33333><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usnipdarkcomet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>snipdarkcomet</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>11/21/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>1:09:11 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: ...</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I am agree with you Zurren, i know how its hard to invent and find new spell for a specific class, i dont want any clarity of DD too, but i dont really think than HP buffing is a wizard job, cause for me this spell is just an HP buff, maybe it would be nice if you could cast on other character and the mana regen was a bit faster.<br>

<br>
Do you mean for Wizards?  True, true.  People are probably thinking about how the stats compare against the other FAs, though.  We get our big whopping 25 int and 100 mana, which is basically thrown away on the Wizards who thought ahead and picked Erudite and maxed Int.  But so do Clerics (Wisdom, that is, and since there's no such thing as an especially wise Cleric, they can use the Wisdom).  And they also get a total of 50 resistance points.  And their quest is considerably more doable than ours.<br>
<br>
Everyone gets 50 resistance points, matter of fact.  I expected our resistances to be 15, 15, 15, 5, 5.. a little extra, to match the fact of our weapon being &quot;a little&quot; less obtainable than the rest.<br>

<br>
You must be one of the few massive guilds that will go to VP so therefore think you should have all the best toys there. Like I said, I am in a solid guild and we will never see the inside of VP. VP currently has 2 wizzy items that proc DD effects. Why not have one proc a dd and the other barrier of force? If you had gotten the barrier of force effect on one of your VP cool toys you would have thrown it into the &quot;gripe about the effect&quot; pile. <br>
<br>
The FA should be as good as a piece of VP loot. You ought to have the option if you do not want to bother with the quest to get an equivalent item in VP instead. There is no reason the FA should NOT be as good as a piece of VP loot. It is only one piece...<br>
<br>
Like many here have expressed, it is about class defining.<br>
<br>
All the melee FAs make them fight &quot;much&quot; better.<br>
<br>
Chanters are asked for 2 things all the time and are core abilities of their class. Clarity and Haste spells. Their FA is a haste spell. No class will have this ability the way they do.<br>
<br>
Mages are defined by their pets and their FA is an Uber Pet.<br>
<br>
Necros are about pets and DOTs. Their weapon procs a DOT and snares too.<br>
<br>
Clerics and clickable Res. Duh.<br>
<br>
Every FA except ours is offensive or group oriented. It makes the user more effective in combat or makes others more effective in combat. That is why it is a WEAPON. Wizzys have the ONLY effect that is a buff AND self only and will NOT make us better in combat. Not to mention, wizzys are picked up for 2 things. Porting and Nukes. Our FA does neither.<br>
<br>
Someone pointed out that getting every other class their FAs will help an individual wizzy more than getting their own FA and Ithink it is true. I just wish some more thought had been put into the effect. <br>
<br>
1) I would have LOVED an effect that increased nuke damage by 25% or made all our spells use 25% less mana (like a 100 point boost to our specialize skill). <br>
<br>
2) I would have loved a clickable lure or clickable dd that decreased fire and cold resistance by enough that others could nuke ubermobs (that would help everyone and your whole guild would love your FA just like the chanters and clerics). <br>
<br>
3) I  would have loved the above mentioned gate/evac spells. <br>
<br>
These would have been CLASS DEFINING and that is what the FA is all about. Class defining combat. A clickable self only Rune spell has nothing to do with our class. I am sure they will never change the effect now and that is too bad. I will get it because, hey, why not have the 100 mana in a  slot. It is just sad that this is reduced in value to the kedge robe.<br>
<br>
Hopefully Narris will read this and tells us what his thoughts were on picking this effect.<br>

<br>
All the best toys SHOULD be in Veeshan's Peak.  What would be the point of going there if the items were sub-standard?  (and don't give me that &quot;for the experience of killing Phara Dar&quot; crap)  Verant themselves have said this is as close to &quot;endgame&quot; as you can get in EQ.  Veeshan's Peak is one of the most challenging experiences you can have playing this game.. and you should be well rewarded for it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;1) I would have LOVED an effect that increased nuke damage by 25% <br>
<br>
I would have loved this too.  Unfortunately I doubt this is within the constraints of EQ's game engine.  A great idea for EQ2.<br>
<br>
Barrier of Force seems to round out the class nicely, wether you're using it with manastone/manna robe, or using it for protection against uber mobs' AE.  The only real complaint I have with it is it doesn't stack and is self-only.  *shrug*, other than that I'm really happy.</font><P>Frozboz D'Sospes<br>

<br>
I wont ramble on about how VP items should be better, since Froz did a good enough job IMO.<br>
<br>
I do think that Barrier of Force rounds out our class nicely, and an &quot;Uber item&quot; should be usefull against &quot;Uber mobs&quot;, which Barrier of Force is, a right click nuke would do me absolutly no use in VP unless it was ultra-fast casting, in VP when I have on full resist gear, I hardly go below 40% mana with nonstop blasting.<br>
<br>
.. But what the heck, I am going to ramble about VP.<br>
<br>
Veeshans Peak was said to be the closet thing to &quot;End Game&quot; you could come to in EverQuest (of course this will change a bit with the new SoV uber zones/quests). The ammount of time, effort and dedication required by a LARGE number of players to simply step foot into this zone makes the loot worthy of being better then the FA. It would be one thing if a rouge could pick the door open and all of us rush in. But no, each person must get a key to enter the zone, and depending on luck of the spawn this quest can be VERY long.<br>
<br>
Once you enter the zone, these dragons are some of the hardest monsters you will face in EQ and requires good teamwork and dedication by a LARGE number of players (40+ players), compared to need like 24 people or less people needed for VS, a similar ammount for killing Cazic (probably less) and a small group for pulling Jumpalot after a larger guild has killed trak.<br>
<br>
Doing VP is much harder then doing the FA quests, and I do think that VP loot should be of &quot;better quaility&quot;, but lets face it - The stats on our FA is nice, the resists could use some work, but the effect complements the caster loot from VP nicley.<br>
<br>
The reason why I would not want to see a DD effect on our FA item, is because it would either <br>
<br>
- Need to be better then the rend robe, there by making it obsolite (the robe), IMO, that is a non-option<br>
<br>
- Needs to be worse or equal to the rend robe, in which case the effect on the FA would be obsolite and useless once you got a rend robe, again another non-option  <br>
<br>
Now, if we got two staffs out of the deal and one was the DD and one was the barrier of force, cool .. but it's not that way so live with it.<br>
<br>
The stats on the staff are pretty nice, the effect is usefull on &quot;Ubermobs&quot; that have strong AOEs, and it rounds out the class nicely. The item does not make VP caster items &quot;obsolite&quot; by procing a DD, and likewise the VP loot does not make this staff obsolite (or atleast the effect) but having a barrier effect on it. The only improvments I can think of for the item, is make it stackable with manaskin/ruin, and let it be castable on others.<br>
<br>
And if the wizard staff in VP did have the barrier of force effect on it, I would not be pissed off - why? it's a usefull effect, and we got a spiffy rend robe also *G*<br>

You CANNOT justify an epic weapon based on VP loot.  The epic is supposed to be the end all, be all weapon for your class.  You're not supposed to need a manna robe to make it good, or a robe from VP.  <br>
<br>
It SHOULD stand by itself, and as in a post I just made, I think the quest could have been harder, and given the difficulty, the result justifies the effort.  Don't get me wrong, I still think the staff sux in terms of helping boost our usefulness.  You can't argue that &quot;with a manna robe or rend robe&quot; this item will be worth it.  How many wizards honestly are EVER going to be in a group that kills phara dar, and then be allowed to loot the robe. Same for the manna robe, except you'll have more ppl lotto'ing for it.  Would you notice the difference between a wizard who has this staff and one who doesn't?  Probably not, and THAT'S what makes it a shoddy epic in the end. Hell, as I've said before, RESISTING a spell in the end will help you FAR more than absorbing the dmg from it.  Especially since you don't need to recast resists with a 12 sec casting time, and they can't be dispelled like this one probably can.  (Oh yeah you forgot, effects can be dispelled) <br>

Sure, it's nice to have when out exping but it is not a major thing, just saves a little bit of mana. But on a raid situation, the effect on the cleric mace is simply amazing and cuts down recovery time increadbly.<br>
<br>
Then there is the wiz staff, eh .. it's so-so for exping not really &quot;required&quot; material, but it's a great effect for a wizard who goes raiding alot vs monsters that have strong AOE attacks. Now given, the resists on this staff could be improved a bit, but the thing is - if you dont like the resits for raids, use the effect then slap on a better hand held resist item. Not that big of a hassle.<br>
<br>
If these epics are supposed to be the &quot;be all and end all&quot; of class defining items, then these quests are to damn easy. I can think of a few harder things out there then killing Jumpalot, Cazic, VS and Phin.<br>
<br>
If these were ment to be trueley uber-epic items IMO, they should require atleast 1 piece each from the hardest monsters/zones in the game (top levels of sky, veeshans peak, Trakanon, Fear, Hate).<br>
<br>
The effect on the weapon itself is very usefull for a raiding wizard, and for daily exping wise, it complements the solists robe of invocation nicely, and the fact that it works good with the manaskin is a nice boon. Do you need a rend robe or a mana robe to make this staff worth having? no, the fact is - If you go on raids alot where monsters whack out high damage aoes. Barrier of Force is a usefull effect.<br>
