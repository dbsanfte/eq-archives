You sir are the idiot for even starting name calling in the first place.  Simply because I choose to believe what I believe with the facts I've been presented does not make me an idiot.  Now if you want to turn this into a flame fest simply over a discussion such as this, well I can do that as well eventhough it is simply not necessary.<br>
<br>
If you do not accept what I choose to believe then thats just too bad.  I don't care one way or the other, I'm not here to try and convince someone else to feel the same way.<br>
<br>
Basically, the facts don't add up to me, it's been this way since day one.  The Apollo missions which were never done before and most importantly, has never been done again stands out like a sore thumb from the rest of the history of NASA.<br>
<br>
By the way, pick up a science book...  Traveling to the moon is considered going though deep space for you are going COMPLETELY out of the Earth's atmosphere (missions take place within the upper layers today that provide some protection from the elements of deep space).<br>
<br>
Also, the space suits WERE not sufficient for travel though deep space.  They should have been subjected to high levels of radiation that only suits of about an inch thick of lead could provide protection from, yet they have no effects of radiation poisoning.  Don't forget solar flares (the Earth somewhat protects us here but NOT in DEEP SPACE).  Which CAN send temps in the thousands.  Don't forget that once they got there, being subjected to temperatures in the hundreds out in the open yet dropping to below temps in a simple shadow should have been a problem.  No &quot;insulation&quot; of that time could adjust to those temp changes or even those temps themselves.<br>
<br>
It's also amazing that I know for a fact, that the space shuttles cannot operate safely today with temperatures far less hectic.  The shuttle cannot even be launched if temps are below freezing!  How do I know??  Because I've been there!!!  Yet, the Apollo crafts did just fine for the most part with far inferior equipment in the elements of DEEP SPACE.   I'm talking about wiring, insulation, shielding, tubing, FUEL... of the 1960s??  Now I can understand, that you can push to do something despite the odds and despite it being dangerous.  But going to the moon several times at that point in time just does'nt add up for me until I am convinced otherwise.<br>
<br>
Everyone will not agree with what I think.  Thats fine, I have no problem with that.  But I simply cannot agree for myself that it was possible from the facts I've been presented and my knowledge in Engineering.  <br>
<br>
Now take your smart comments and your &quot;ignorance&quot; elsewhere.<br>

<br>
Why werent the Apollo missions followed up on?  Well, it's very expensive to go to the moon for a kodak moment after you've already been a few times and collected several samples of rocks and dust.<br>
<br>
I dont know what area you feel your engineering expertise is in, but astro physics, metalurgy, chemical and structural engineers in the thousands all work on and for the space program in one respect or another.  Companies from Dow to DuPont to General Dynamics, LM, MT, GE, and so on and so on.  Do you really think they are all lying?  <br>

<br>
Erm... the shuttle can not be launched in low temperatures due to components (o-rings) in the solid rocket boosters, which do not ever leave Earth orbit.  This does not mean that the shuttle itself can not withstand a little Florida freeze.  It means that the rubber seals in the boosters shrink in the cold, causing leaks, which was the direct cause of the Challenger accident.<br>
<br>
As far as whether it was possible for people to get to the moon with technology of the time...  well suffice to say that your &quot;proof&quot; which is actually a collection of your gut feelings is not exactly convincing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufilanfyretracker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Filan Fyretracker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/27/02 8:11:09 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://pages.cthome.net/filanwizard/wtcsmall.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: (OT)Shuttle Fleet grounded for cracked fuel line liners.</span><hr size=1> the space program pushes aerospace tech higher in a similar way to how gaming is pushing computers to the limit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udryfft.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dryfft</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/27/02 8:18:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: (OT)Shuttle Fleet grounded for cracked fuel line liners.</span><hr size=1> I would be willing to be that the first colony in space is a commercial venture.<br>

I am in no way a &quot;troll&quot; or &quot;stubborn&quot;, I believe what I believe and thats just it.  Why can't none of you people just agree to disagree?  Why the name calling?  Must we all agree on everything to be accepted?  Maybe someone else has more information than what I have researched that shows more definite proof.  Maybe even proof that would convince me as well.  But I have yet to see it.  That does not make you more intelligent to me, or it does not mean any of you should come up with these colorful metaphors to describe someone whom you know nothing about.<br>
<br>
About the other questions.<br>
<br>
I never doubted the space program as a whole, just the Apollo program.  I agree that the space program as a whole is influential in many advancements we have today.  Yet  I can still say that from evidence I've seen so far, the Apollo program is too outrageous for me to believe.  Others don't agree with that.  Fine and dandy.  But please note that others have the same belief as well.  That does not mean I or anyone else should disregard what I've come across and blindly fall in line what YOU believe simply because you believe it.  I am not a clone and I think freely on topics with the information I am provided.<br>
<br>
Moon rocks (yes we have sent &quot;unmanned&quot; craft to the moon).  Also note that moon rocks and meteorites fall to Earth all the time (even before the Apollo missions).<br>
<br>
Why didn't the Russians know?  *shrug*  Maybe they were fooled like others, maybe they did know.  This is something I really haven't researched cause the Russians didn't &quot;know&quot; about alot of stuff.<br>
<br>
Also Mr Sildiven, I am not the only one with questions such as these, there are people with heavy credentials refuting the evidence as well...so what does that prove?  Could you possibly be the stubborn one?<br>
