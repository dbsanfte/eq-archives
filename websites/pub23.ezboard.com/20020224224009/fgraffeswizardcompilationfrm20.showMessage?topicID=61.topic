I was kiting Paw Gnolls in SK last night.  I kited 3 at a time at one point using Col of Lightning.  So happens that when all 3 finally dropped, I dropped them in front of a full group that was doing only one at a time.<br>
<br>
The enchanter in that group was so impressed that she decided to join me. Foolish me, what was I thinking.. and I said OK.<br>
<br>
I snared 3 and took off running.  Guess what the enchanter did?  Yep, you’re right, she mezzed the other 2.  I turned my back and there was only one chasing me.  I just felt weak on the knees and thought I didn’t have enough manna to kill these one at a time.<br>
<br>
Needless to say the enchanter died.<br>
<br>
Lesson learned.  When kiting multiple mobs, do it SOLO!  Never ever get anyone to join you, specially an enchanter, when multiple kiting.  <br>
<br>
It’s a really bad feeling to see somebody die when you use a method that you thought was absolutely safe.  I’ve been multi-kiting for 3 levels now and I’ve forgotten how dangerous it truly is.<br>

They key is to take turns doing the majority of the damage.  I quad-kited in DL quite a bit with a lower level wizard.  The trick is to run in a straight line if possible, and if not, run side-by side, and cast in tandem.  Always let the puller tick them off a lot with a solo CoF or other piller line spell before you let the second help.  With a duid, feel free to let them use their single snare and tracking abilities to round up the mobs before you step in.  As a wizard, the hardest part of the quad-kiting is maintaining the snare on all the mobs.  Instead of relying on a short-duration AE snare, they can single-snare each and it will last the entire fight easy.  Then the wizzy is left to his specialty, raw damage.<br>
<br>
AE tactics work well with an enchanter as well, but you have to use different tactics.  If the enchanter has a really good sense of timing and good cha, they can follow your AE cast immediatly with a mez.  Idealy if you get hit at all, it will only be once by each mob.  You can then med up while the mez does its thing, or even run away a bit if you get into trouble.  Try memming your PB AOE instead of just a piller with an enchanter.  You can stand right in the middle of a mass of mobs when the chanter casts Mez, then drop a nuke, mez, nuke, mez, etc.  Most players are not capable of adapting their strategies so much though, so be careful you can trust the enchanter (and slowly ramp up the number of mobs as you are comfortable, practicing on 1 first).  Too many players get into the &quot;I have to split up the mobs or we die&quot; train of thought, and neglect the fact that &quot;Wow, if I cast an AE on all 5l, I can do a total of 1160dam on 175m!  If I cast on just one, I can do about 320 on 160m!&quot;  The mana efficiency is just insane when you use AE to it's fullest.  Also some of the most fun in the game is spent grouped with a bard, chanter, and some fellow wizards.  A single mid twenties group can hold the top of paw (everything before the doors) if they follow these tactics.  It was also one of my most favorite times (Just make sure you don't get cocky and get a port into cazic thule for some more AE; we killed 31 mobs straight until OOM and we had to zone). <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=6029">Azlinon Seflarian</a> of <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/divinesymphony">Divine Symphony</a><br>

The main thing to keep in mind is the Wizard should have aggro at all times. Druid keeps you sowed and can track, but Wizard pulls with flux staff, and flux them up a LOT at the beginning so by the time you start the damage part of your run they stay on the wizard. Another wiz is less easy since he'll be doing as much damage as the pulling wiz, (or else he's wasting mana). Two wizards are better at single kiting yellows than quadding IMO, but it can be done.<br>
<br>
Main thing is the puller needs to flux up each pulled mob a LOT as he pulls it so it stays focused on the pulling wiz.<br>

Number 4 will agro on someone else if possible. You only actually have the full attention of 3 at a time. If you stop and let them beat on you (for whatever reason.. hehe) only 3 will administer the beating, the 4th will start to lose interest. This is also a problem when you have the idiots who like to get to close while you are kiting agro mobs. I have had someone screw up the mobs like that more than once when I was kiting raptors. It is also the reason you should never quad kite agro mobs around other people, you will lose one. You can kite 3 at a time over the top of people no problem as long as they don't agro based on proximity (like the undead).<br>
<br>
I've done raptors with a chanter before. Just get clarity from them and have them invis until one is dead and have them finish the last 3. Was able to clear all 8 spawns on the big island constantly that way. <p>Qaman<BR>

Their primary concern should be staying in line with the wizard when running.  Who cares which PC the mobs are actually agro'd on if you run in a straight line in front of the mobs?  I actually suggest to the people I do this with to start with autorun just long enough to get in my direct line of travel before canceling autorun with a quick press of num-lock.  The primary role of the second character in this situation is mostly as a finisher and to take care of the other with a quick snare, root, etc in case you get friends that want to help your mobs.  When I say finisher, I mean primarily the last 25-35% of the mob hps.  It does take a lot of work and a smart partner, but it is much safer and can yield exp faster.  The faster exp is due both to the marginal group bonus, handling of adds, and ability to avoid a situation where you must med-kite.  It also has the benefit of insurance in case one of you goes LD.<br>
<br>
Now, I tried something else recently.  A bard and wizzy make a really good pair for single pulls, and I would assume doubles as well.  If they stay in range and always play mana-song, you get mana back faster then clarity or clarity II, and they work as a great finisher, and mob-finder.  You can't beat the speed a bard can get 3 mobs pissed at him, hehe.  I personally found the single-pull situation very useful and had my friend keep mana-song up the entire time with no gaps.  I would nuke twice, having let the bard snare; I kept the agro, so the bard just kept slashing off the hps as it followed me.  For good measure, I kept fluxing it.  An ice comet, and a conflag will kill a rager in DL if you have the bard.  And, you can be FM before you get to the next mob, and the bard takes no hits either. <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=6029">Azlinon Seflarian</a> of <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/divinesymphony">Divine Symphony</a><br>

With the bard auto-following you and drumming Selo's, you almost don't even need to snare your targets, you get ahead of them that fast.  Forget SOW and forget Jboots.<br>
<br>
And the bard can melee and finish off any stragglers.  <br>
<br>
And then the bard can sing clarity during downtime.<br>
<br>
And they can also get you out of there, or at least far enough ahead to evac, if things should happen to go horribly wrong.  (Funny how Wyvern and Yvolcarn look similar when you're not paying that much attention...)<br>

Come up with a path for kiting and make sure you both follow eachother in that general direction for kiting. Both of you do your nukeing thing at the same time sorta. Ex. Both you 2 are running, 1 begins to nuke, other needs to run little further, then they begin nuke, other wiz runs past and beyond the other guy and nukes. etc. SHould work wonders and uber exp from those mobs you cant solo quad yourself.
