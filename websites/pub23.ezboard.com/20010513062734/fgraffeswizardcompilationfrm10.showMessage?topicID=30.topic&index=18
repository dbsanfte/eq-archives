You will not fizzle a spell any more than normal even halfway into the same level as you got it.  Fizzling is based on your skill compared to the max skill of the level you got the spell, and your INT.  You do not need to be level 50 to avoid fizzling, that is a rumor started on this board by someone trying to defend Verant's decision.<br>
<br>
It is a level 39 spell, yes?  Why is it not obtainable at level 39?<br>
<br>
Lets play a game, and assume that the false rumor is why Verant made the quest this high.  Which is better, to have it earlier and fizzle more, or to have it much, much later and not fizzle much?  Even on THOSE terms it is a silly setup.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#33333><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uleadpipe79.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leadpipe79</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forum Apprentice</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>1/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>12:25:17 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">....</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">&gt;&gt;OK here's the deal. I sat with the raiders in South Karana and grouped them up in a tight pile, all 8 of them in a bunched up area and cast every Al'Kabor we get. I got exactly 5 hits every single cast, no more, no less. That's how I know it hits 5 guys. Gravity Flux does too.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Ok, I wil concede that perhaps the messages I got were double packet reading, or some other such lag related, that it appeared on my screen as I hit 6 targets when I only hit 5. Very well, that still doesnt invalidate my point that Verant, when you complain of these spells, will argue that since you can get more targets (even if it is only one), then if you do hit 5 things with one Al Kabors you are getting the kind of mana/damage ratio you want. Nevermind that that is an assinine comment, or pretty much just plain wrong, thats what they will argue.  You need something to say to that, and you have yet to come up with a better reason for explaining why they suck, and remember, Verant doesnt understand stuff like dps, or damage to mana ratios, for spells or melee.  How do you think the 3/10 moss twigged ended up on a level 35ish mob? The guy that made the twig thought it would just be good to practice 1hb with.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You seem to be willing to dismiss the damage differences, but you know what? You are in the vast minority. Wizards are supposed to be the best at DD, with nobody close. Well, Verant won't make us the best with no rivals, but we sure as hell can fight to make us at least slightly better. You want to discuss casting times and mana efficiency? OK lets talk about ALL the issues then, throw in a Magician using ALL his best tools and us using ALL our best tools. Now they out damage us in 1-2 casts at ALMOST ALL spell levels, are you happier?&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Yes, I know Mages outdamage us, at times by extreme amounts.  And yes, they shouldnt have done more damage by DD in the first place at all.  I will even concede that you could say its not just 16 more damage than us they are doing, since we normally do (off the top of my head) around 5% more damage than them ayway, so they are actually doing around 30 more damage than they should for 34 compared to us.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Why? Because the reason groups really look at Wizards isn't fast damage, we can't DO fast damage in 99% of the fights (you blast constantly as fast as you can do you? Neither do any of us). They look at things like evac and snare. But we aren't supposed to be the class known for snaring and evaccing, we are supposed to be fast burners, nukers, the cannon. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Granted probably 70% of the people Ive ever grouped with never knew wizards had a snare till I used mine, this is only true up to 50.  Post 50 this would almost be acceptable, very few groups want to go far into Seb or such without an evaccer, even if they are planning to just die and let the clerics res them anyway.  But I do agree, pre-50 it would have been nice to be taken for my damage abilities, because they needed it, not because the groups had an extra opening and figured any nuker is good as any other.  This point has never been in contention, but do you really think that upping our damage on our 34 dd by 20 points is really going to change this?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What bothers me most is that even Clerics and Druids nod and say &quot;you got something there&quot; when I point out that if Verant finds it acceptible for someone to do that much damage at any point, then it should be ok for Wizards to do at least that much... since that is our specialty. Yet you only seem to want to answer with wierd, cryptic non applicable analogies and dismissal as if it doesn't matter. It does, every bit of it matters.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Ok, first, I never claimed the spell setup was logical, what I did claim is that there are some things the just arent worth arguing about, because nothing will change them.  <br>
<br>
By weird cryptic analogies Im guessig you mean the preacher alcholoic one.  My knowledge of the history of statistics is not good enough to include a date, but my analgoy refers to a study done, if I had to guess I believe somewhere around WW1, that showed that the more preachers there were in a town the more alcoholics there were.  <br>
<br>
What the study didnt show is that there were more preachers in the town simply because town a was bigger than town b.  In other words more preachers didnt cause more alcoholics, both were products of larger populations.  But the study didnt mention that the towns with more preachers were bigger, and almost everyone who reads it the first time tries to figure out how preachers cause alcoholism.  This study was never truly serious, I will point out, it was more of a learning exercise, but it was meant to demonstrate that you cant argue preachers cause alcoholism without more backround info.  <br>
<br>
Which in turn is the same as me trying to explain that you cant argue more dd damage by class A means better dd damage by class A than B, because class B might be able to cast twice as fast for 75% the damage of a single nuke of class A.  Yes Im sorry my last example was horribly cryptic, if anyone didnt understand it tell me, Ill try to explain better, but teaching has never been my strong suit.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;So every single little baby step we take to make that more so is a step in the right direction.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Conversly every baby step we take, Verant throughs that back in our face as a major improvement and we should be happy with what we already got.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The reason I edited your comments is to keep the post from being 98028 pages long, not because I was trying to censor you. I was putting the basic statement down and responding to it, its not like people can't scroll up and look.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Ok, I can understand this, mostly I was mad at the cazic gate comment because you made it sound like I was disagreeing that it had any danger at all, I never claimed that, just that the danger was possible to avoid without much hassle.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Regarding Cazic Thule, that is an option, probably better than moving the port (although I would still argue it is a retarded place to put a teleport - imagine how Druids would complain if their circle was dumped in the middle of Lower Guk or something?). But the fact is, every Wizard who walks the planet knows that is a lethal, awful place to teleport into.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Well, actually I thought it was pretty neat to have a tp into a dungeon, but the point is moot to me, so I still leave my suggestion to stand to simply try to get verant to change the spawns, not the tp location.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The only way anyone can move into there safely is if they know ahead of time what is up, get very lucky, and have everything prepared just right. That isn't how a teleport should work, is it?&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Again I could argue that I do it by simply memming invis in a slot, and leaving everyhting else as I usually have it memmed, but the point is moot, Im not here to argue over the finer points of tping into cazic.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;And finally, the fizzle rumor was started right here on Graffe's board and was answered by me, quoting GZ on fizzles the very next message. Sadly though, people don't seem to remember that one, just the junk about it being higher level. My opinion is they wanted it rare, and didn't want many Wizards having it. All they succeded in making only high level Wizards have it, so that its not rare, its just impossible for the level it is given. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Ok, fine.  As I said, personally I would like to see the quest made a little easier so that I could do it, but while I was trying to be objective, I was simply trying to inform you that, while I freely admitted that it might have started elsewhere as a rumor, the first I heard of why the spell was level 39, I heard the reason I gave.  And I never did find that reason completely satisfactory ether, I was merely trying to help you get a response ready for when verant threw that at you.<br>
<br>
As it stands after doing this three times now, Im not sure if Im helping you or just angering you, but my original intention was to just help.  Regardless if you dont find my criticism helpful, then tell me and I will stop.<br>

Someone posted that on this very web site, in response to a previous draft of this exact post I did.  I responded quickly that it was not anything of the sort, and even if it was, that is a moot point, because I'd rather have it at 39 and fizzle a lot than not have it.<br>
<br>
An unfortunate effect of the way these message boards work is that they often will start rumors that are repeated as fact.  When someone types in a response that Cleric/Wizard damage comparisons aren't worth doing, that might lead others to go &quot;eh, hell with it&quot; instead of really thinking about what that implies about Verant's approach and what might happen if we jar them out of the box.  Your example of the twig is excellent, they really don't have the damnest clue about their own game half the time.<br>
<br>
And that is EXACTLY why I think fights like this are worth fighting, because if we can get them to see that Al'Kabor's design and features are WELL KNOWN to Wizards and we still think its trash, and that no Magician should blast better than a Wizard and the other little details, we might, just MIGHT be able to get them to sit down and give this some thought.<br>
<br>
Take a look at the interaction between Verant and Necromancers and Enchanters right now.  They did the same thing with Rangers, Bards, and Rogues in the past.  So far they have totally ignored Wizards, and I am not exaggerating when I say this, they have literally blown off posts about Wizards by people in toto.  The last response we have EVER gotten was very early last year.<br>
<br>
What we have to do, to get any kind of work done properly, is to open this avenue and get them thinking of things in ways they haven't before.  I personally think that my anger and persistence has had a bad effect on them, and that they aren't likely to EVER listen to me.  That's why I have been kind of quiet lately on Wizard issues.<br>
<br>
But we can't let even little stuff slide, Bards posted EVERY SINGLE ISSUE they could think of and got responses on them all.  The least we can do is hope for that.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#33333><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=marcin>Marcin</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forum Apprentice</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>1/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>2:52:14 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial"> </font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">This is the exact same post you made about 4 months back.

<br>
You need to post something original because obviously reposting the same old thing isn't worth a damn.<br>
<br>
Cazic Gate is fine with levitate on and they did move the drop spot from the left side to the center of the pad. Porting in without aggro is easy now.<br>
<br>
Concussion is 39 because of channeling purposes to make it actually useful, not because the quest is intended for lower levels. If they make it higher level it will fizzle as bad as Atol's or Shield of the Magi, making it worthless until about 59/60. Don't have them mess up a spell that is actually useful and works.<br>
<br>
The dmg over other classes thing is a dead issue. And really, its not that big of a deal. We aren't rangers, give up this need for balance. We are still needed more than ever (pending the lurefix in the next patch) post 50. Enough already.<br>
<br>
Gaze/Glimpse/etc do work exactly like a telescope spell, it would be too much work to make something that actually increases your clippane. Maxclip is already coded into the zone, and so most likely the work around would be to make maxclip a much higher number, but preventing normal vision from going beyond a certain point, and having that extra clipping to be seen only by gaze. Not only would this be an insane amount of work, it would cause a lot of useless lag for many players, and the clippane sliderbar works by percentage, not actual numbers, so its not likely to happen. It works like a zoom spell so you can just see things better, as intended.<br>
<br>
Your only valid points are Bind Sight, Al'kabors, Tishan's relocation (good luck with them rebuilding the zone, a.g.h.), and the fade/yonder issues.

For instance, have two categories of the post:<br>
Problems that need solutions:<br>
Al' Kabors<br>
etc etc etc<br>
<br>
Odd Design Choices showing a lack of direction for the wizard class:<br>
Cleric level 1 &amp; 5 DD higher<br>

etc etc<br>
<br>
Then I think you have more of a post that just shows that a. we have some problems we need fixed, and b. we can tell that the wizard class wasnt really well thought out past DD and tp, and c. DD has become way underpowered due to the death penalty and other time sinks causing players to constantly look for the most efficient form of play, which for 99% (ie Non-Ae groups) of the groups a wizard tries to get into, that means dots and melee damage.

What does levitate do for aggro? And I could swear they never moved the tp spot, but whatever.<br>

Ok from my, admitedly limited, understanding of channeling, channeling works solely based on your channel skill, not on the level of the spell plus channel.  And the stuff about fizzling is exaclty what Grim is saying people are wrong about, so do you know differently? Do you have proof?  <br>

Please at least finish the thought.  From my experience up to 51, that should read We are still needed more than ever post 50 for raids and events, but exp groups scoff at us as inefficient.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Gaze/Glimpse/etc do work exactly like a telescope spell, it would be too much work to make something that actually increases your clippane. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Or they could figure out where you would be, using glimpse, to get that same view, put a non aggro, non visible (as in no graphics), level 1 eye of zomm in that place instead.  The effect would be pretty much the same, but now you would get a new place to start the clip plane from where this little creature is.<br>
