So far I've had a pretty hard time finding myself groups. I usually hang out in EC, Nro, and for the past few days Oasis(a pure death trap). There are times in which I have to pretty much beg myself into groups. It seems to me things are this way. I have to pretty much beg to get myself in groups, like I said before and people beg for me not to leave the groups when I have to leave. This type of thing really pisses me off as I guess it would other people. To not be worth the time of others or not have others want to group but then have them get mad when I have to leave. Now I understand why wizards charge other classes(most wizards I've run into help the young(wizards) ones out because they remember how hard it was when they were that level) the prices for teleports the way they do, a kind of payback as it were. Is there an easier way of getting into groups or does it remain like this even in the higher levels.<br><br>Anyway I've heard that wizard do have the ability to solo at higher levels(jboots and snare spells) but is it possible at the lower ones(root)? I really need something to do when I can't get into a group and I refuse to beg anymore. Are there any zones or certain mobs in zones that I would be able to solo? Note I don't have luclin. I might buy it if it has a lot better grouping and hunting advantages. Also does root(a worthless spell that I'm kicking myself for spending money on, this thing has gotten me killed so may times I've lost count) work better when you get to high levels? I haven't used it for the past few levels because it got me killed a lot. . I don't want to try another class. I already have a Pally(lvl 9) and tried a Mag but I got bored with him pretty fast so I didn't take him over 15. I'm sorry if this has been posted before but I'm pressed for time right now and I thought I might get a better response by posting a new topic. I've read guides or list where to hunt at certain levels but I still have to beg my way into groups or the locations are completely empty, meaning I would die without anyone to help me or group..<br><br>Any suggestion, advice, or comments would be greatly appreciated.

My understanding of the whole line, if you look you will notice  we get a few of them.  Root, immobilze, fetter and such.  One line is for root nuking and one for parking and forgetting.  Leveling does help with having not only these spells landing but most spells.  I forget where i saw it but at level 30 or 35 Wizards and only wizards get a lower resistance check for all spells.  So although root does seem resisted alot or break soon, you might also want to try to have shadowstep loaded for escaping.<br><br>Wizards are by far the most fun to play and as someone's signature states: for wizards guilds and groups are just a social thing not a requirement.  I have only grouped for a couple sessions.  I think a few of the 20's and a few of the 40's.  Mostly I wander the lands keeping the full XP kill to myself.  <br><br>So stick with it and it will only get better.<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66366">Orsmo Xlorr 56 Lvl Wizard</A><BR><table width="350" border="0" bgcolor="#996433"><tr bgcolor="#F0A268"><td width="125" bgcolor="#FFCCFF"><div align="center"><img src="http://orsmo.freewebspace.com/images/merlin.jpg" width=350 height=200> </table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=chiriko>chiriko</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/14/02 1:11:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=476.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Help on soloing</span><hr size=1> Yeah, soloing is the way of the wizard, which is farily ironic I find since we were initally built to be the core damage dealers of a group, hiding behind tanks, and supposedly not able to solo becuase of our low AC and HP. Kiting changed all that though. &lt;grin&gt;. the low levels can be very rough for a youngerster though, here's what I'd recommend. <br><br>At 13, you should definatey make the trek to North Karana. Beeltles there are so slow you don't even need sow to kite them (though it helps) and if you're adventurous you can even quad kite them. this should get you to 16-18 easy. Alternatively, you can also do pretty well through these levels in kurns' tower if you feel like making that trek. you'll be root/nuking there though. At 16 a very good place to get xp is the orc camp in High Pass. you'll have to group here though, but its *Very* fast xp. <br><br>Once you get to between 16-18, you should be heading to the Lake of Ill Omen. This zone is just one of those zones you kinda have to deal with. you'll see some of the best and worst of EQ here. when you arrive here in your late teens, you'll be reduced to grouping the goblin fort, and root/nuking. the advantage here though is that there's a pretty good chance you'll be able to get a breese/sow for free just by asking around, and having sow makes all the differacne with root/nuking. sure, your root is still going to be resists/break all the time, but you'll be able to outrun the creature and cast it again, or just run and nuke, in a sort of ghetto-kite. These levels are some of the worst IMHO, but you should be able to get through them pretty quick. As you level up in the Lake to your low twenties (aren't your new ports wonderful? now you can bind in the lake and gate back to fay to sell!) you'll progress around the south side of the lake toward the sarnak fort. in your low 20s you can make great xp grouping around here and soloing. Save those runes and ask people to give you extra ones because you're going to want your research high enough that as soon as you hit 24 you can research column of ligtning or whatever you lvl 24 AE spell is.<br><br>This is where you really come into your own as a soloer. you might also want to get your staff of the wheel and staff of the temperate flux around this level too, the extra mana and clicky will help you IMMENSLY in the levels to come. I got my Staff of the wheel at 24 and I still use. Didn't even die getting it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  anyway. Once you've got your column spell. load up on buffs and go talk to you local shaman/ranger/druid and get a sow. now head to the northwest side of the lake and find the goblin ruins there with 4 golbins spawned inside. most of the soloers along here leaves these alone, because its hard not to get all of them, but that's what you *want*. Take a deep breath and run right through the middle of the ruins, getting fairly close to them to agro them. if you've got a skin up you should be fine. pull the 4 of them out of the ruins and start making circles around them so that they get close together, then run a good ways from them til their just out of range (don't run too far, or you'll lose agro). I usually ran down along the north side of the shore, since there's no one over there usually and you don't have to worry about getting any outside &quot;help&quot; from friendly druids. Anyway, get to max range and cast your column, you should be able to get it off in plenty of time to hit them and then keep running. once you get the timing down this is a peice of cake. and the xp is simply jaw-dropping. on a single bar of mana you'll find yourself getting 1.5-2 or more full blues of xp. its nuts. keep this up until you hit 30.<br><br>Alternatively, you could try the Warrens and Stonebrunt mountains, if you perfer the truely solitary path. (you can hunt all day in stonebrunt and never see another soul) but you won't be able t kite without sow, so I don't recommend it.
