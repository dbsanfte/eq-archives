<br>
I wanted to start this thread to discuss ways we can improve and tweak how we do things. I really would like this to be as constructive as possible. I would like to define here what we want for the SGA, define any strengths and weaknesses in order that we are able to get the most benefit to the members.<br>
<br>
Let me begin.<br>
<br>
The SGA, to me, means that we as small guilds can gather the resources to do large encounters and also be a community unto ourselves but not exclusive like some of the larger guilds.<br>
<br>
Strengths - We do one hell of a fear raid.<br>
            We aren't loot hungry<br>
            Diversity of Levels<br>
            We work very well together as players <br>
            All of the guilds are families<br>
 <br>
Weaknesses - <br>
<br>
             Communication, we do have problems on raids    and setting up impromptu raids since we don't share a common chat channel.<br>
             Respect, in the larger guild community we are still seen as 4 small guilds and there fore do not command the respect of the larger guilds in terms of raids, spawns etc... This also comes into play with loosing members to those guilds ie the current cleric / chanter shortage.<br>
             Leadership, I think we need A designated SGA leader (no I'm not nominating myself for this) that does not have power over the individual guilds per say but does set direction. This could be rotated out like terms of office.<br>
             Regular Raids, we need to set up more regular raids for all level ranges to get our members used to working together. The difference between us and larger guilds are that they do regular raids. They are used to working together on a regular basis. This also promotes keeping the members of our guilds from leaving.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a few thoughts some may seem radical some may not, but the dialouge must begin somewhere and this is all for the improvment of the SGA. Please post your suggestions/thoughts here guys.<br>

That said, it's probably wise to start shaping some things up right now, and it sounds like you've got things on a good track Zen.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of an SGA leader quite a bit. One central person to administer things tends to work well. Perhaps we should also redefine the roles of the SGA reps a bit as well...<br>
<br>
To me, at least, it would make sense to have a team of people, 1 from each guild, who's responsability is to hold up that guild's end of event planning. That person might not have to set up a raid, but would at least serve as the liason from the event planner to the SGA. This team then would try to coordinate things as best they could amoung one another, etc. looking at the scheduling for things with other guilds, etc. Basically, just something to give a little more structure to each guild's interaction with the SGA, and give small guild's like PoJ a nice pool of people to draw on for assistance with planning raids.<br>
<br>
Basically, it's a bit more what I envisioned the role of SGA rep as being, something a little more active than just the face in the crowd that everyone knows.<br>
<br>
Just a suggestion, but I think it might help out with some of the communication problems, especially if one person from each guild is assigned the duty of disemminating raid info to the guild. While message boards are nice...not everyone in the guild will read them =)<br>

<br>
First and foremost, I would like to commend those who are setting up raids for SGA. I know this can be a frustrating thing sometimes. A few do seem comfortable setting up and hosting these things, however we need a method for making others in the different guilds comfortable with hosting or planning a raid (of any size).<br>
<br>
When I initially drafted the charter I comprised 2 councils so to speak. 1 rep from each guild was to handle the &quot;administrative&quot; things... being our PR people, talking with other guilds, settling disputes, &quot;the face in the crowd&quot; as Sarindal says. The other council was to be an Event council. 1 rep from each guild would be responsible for setting up raids weekly. This person could be approached by members of his own guild and help his guildmates set up SGA raids (by no means is the Event rep going to be setting up all raids). During the completion of the charter the Event council was taken out and just a rep was left. I think it is time to reevaluate this, as I too see the event planning part of SGA needing some structure to be successful.<br>
<br>
Some suggestions (Board Admin.. tell me what you think)<br>
<br>
1. We need a simple raid CALENDAR for SGA events. This board is nice, but for example, this week we have 3 raids planned, combined with a bunch of other topics, it is easy to get things lost in the shuffle and takes some time to find out what's going on and when. I saw a great calendar here... <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.samurais.uni.cc/">www.samurais.uni.cc/</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. Go to the SCHEDULE link and see the simple format. WE can still use the boards to post all the pertinent information and gather interest, but one calendar with upcoming events will make everyones life easier and should improve event attendance. It would be nice to know what is going on the next week or two without having to dig through a week's worth of topics.<br>
<br>
2. I think our own SGA website would be awesome. Is this feasible? Is there anyone out there that knows how to set up websites that would be willing to take on a project? I surf all of our guild webpages, and I must say the work that is put into them is Excellent. The SGA page would not need to be elaborate, just our charter, the msgboard, event calendar, and links to our guildwebpages.<br>
<br>
3. I think Zen has suggested this before, but I would like to have a password protected forum for Raid Event strategy discussion.<br>
<br>
Now my first 3 bullets are all around communication on the web. What I envision the SGA rep as being is the communicator and facilitator of information. This is what I enjoy doing. I think the above three tools would be incredibly beneficial to our group communicating and setting goals.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have more ideas, but will put them in a seperate post as they will deal with actual direction of our raiding and goals of SGA.<br>

<br>
Whether we decide on a raid council or not, we need to come up with a method for organizing and synchronizing REGULAR SGA raids. With 4 guilds, it would not be &quot;overdoing&quot; it if we ran 3 to 4 events a week. We don't require attendance so members would be given the opportunity on 3 to 4 nights a week to do some raiding. I would like to see our method of organizing raids include people of all levels within our guild. That being said I think it is important to have a group of people focus on 46+ raids and a group of people focus on 10+ raids. Our guilds can individually run smaller raids with great success. It is the planar and higher raids that we need the SGA for. I believe we need a group of people focused on setting up these raids.<br>
<br>
I really like the idea of a Raid council or Event planning council. This could be comprised of more than just one rep from each guild. They can have their own forum to discuss tactics, zones, events... This group can do research on zones we have not done and plan dates and times for raids.<br>
<br>
I would like Hate and Fear to be the &quot;bread and butter&quot; of the SGA. These zones are perfect for our size, and all of us need (and will continue to need) our planar armor. If we do not go the route of the event council, I would like to see each guild be responsible for setting up a planar raid once a month. This would put us in Hate or Fear every weekend, however it would only put the stress of leading the raid on each guild once a month. For every 1 raid you led you would have 4 to attend. <br>
<br>
With Hate and Fear being regular events and coming more easily to us we will have time to set up different raids. I like the direction we are taking by setting up Icewell raids. Like I said in a previous post, Velious is designed for the higher end multi group encounters. This is a great place for SGA to prove thier muster. I would like to see a great number of SGA lead raids in the new zones. Why? Because they are difficult, not everyone does them, they will be a great learning experience, and the rewards justify the difficulty IMO. Zones like Velek's, Kael, WW, Siren's Grotto, Icewell and others should be where SGA is spending time. It seems everyone and their brother &quot;knows&quot; the right way to do Hate and Fear... I would like to pioneer the &quot;right&quot; way to do some of these newer zones. Zones that have not been fought in for over 2 years now... zones where we will need to come up with our own strategies to succeed, not someone else's.<br>
<br>
So now we are in Fear and Hate, and Velious on a regular basis. If our planners have the energy (and I'm hoping we do) we can continue to expand the zones we want SGA to be in. The Hole, Howling Stones, Chardok, Skyshrine. There are a lot of great zones that are perfect for our numbers.<br>
<br>
If we really spend the next few months working together in these environments, planning several raids weekly, it is not impossilbe for the SGA to be in PoG or Sky this summer... and taking names there.<br>
<br>
I look at this organization and am excited. Believe it or not, we in the SGA, have an opportunity not afforded to many others in this game any longer. The larger guilds will always be able to do these zones, however, unless you are a pioneer in that guild, or have been there from the beginning, all the fun in figuring out how to do the zones are not experienced anymore. Either you level up in EQ and stick with your small guild of friends, catch some pickup raids, and never see these zones, or you join a larger guild where the &quot;right&quot; way to do it has already been laid out and you are just in it for the experience (albeit a fun one). I don't think anyone in the SGA &quot;knows&quot; how to do PoG or has been standing on the last ilse in sky. We have the resources to do the larger raids now... it's time to learn how to do them together.<br>

that was beautiful man<br>
<br>
I like the event council/commitee to be unique to the actual governing body.  Each in their own right is an important enough task that I dont want to see a few individuals weighted down.  I think we need to really get cracking on prioritizing our growth.  As I see it...<br>
<br>
1)  settle on a governing coucil/general leader of the SGA<br>
2)  settle on the charter<br>
3)  decide on whatever commitees when need/want<br>
4)  work on a more consolidated set of websites/scheduling to minimize some uneeded headaches<br>

The drops there are better then the planes and very few people go there. We should as an organization have a presence there. <br>
<br>
Also we should start to do regular Naggy/Vox raids, a couple of epic piece drop off them not to mention the other loot. I for one have been gearing up to start my epic soon and am going to help with a naggy raid to night for that purpose. <br>
