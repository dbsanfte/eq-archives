<br>
Someone who knows FOR SURE, please tell me if I have the correct breakdown here. I'm going to re-write that spoiler in a super basic format, I will put **asterisks** where there is a problem as far as I read the spoiler.<br>
<br>
#1 - Get the note from Solomen in Temple of SolRo<br>
<br>
#2 - Take the Note to Camin in Erudin, Give the Note to Camin, Get a Positive TrueSpirit Faction Hit<br>
<br>
****#3 - Hail Camin, give him 1000pp ?????<br>
(This is already messed up in the spoiler, it says you can talk if you have good faction, it doesnt say what to do if you DONT)<br>
<br>
#4 - Buy a Ro's Breath Potion, give it Camin to be stripped, get a potion back<br>
<br>
#5 - Give the stripped Potion to Dargon in Halas, this makes Arantir spawn, and potion is returned<br>
<br>
#6 - Give the potion to Camin, get a TS faction hit, potion is returned<br>
<br>
***#7 - Give the potion to Dargon in Halas (wtf, the spoiler already said Arantir would be spawned in Step #5 - why would Dargon be there again? who do you give this potion to?) Arantir spawns (again?) - Get a note from Arantir.<br>
<br>
#8 - Take the note from Arantir to Challice in Felwithe Paladin guild (nice place for a de wizard to go im sure). Give her the note, get a + TS faction hit, get a letter/ring back.<br>
<br>
****#9 - Give the letter/ring from Challice back to Arantir/Dargon in Halas (either one is ok?). This will spawn Arantir. <br>
<br>
<br>
#10 - Hail Arantie, go through the dialogue, and hear his BS. Arantir tells you about Phinny Staff, VS staff, and the gnome. Arantir gives you a letter for the gnome.<br>
<br>
#11 - Give note to Kandin Firepot in BB. Talk with him, get the SPARE GEARS.<br>
<br>
#12 - Give gears to Broken Golem in POF, which spawns enraged golem. Kill the golem, loot the GREEN OIL off its corpse.<br>
<br>
#13 - Give oil to Kandin Firepot. In return, you get a Note and the Staff of Gabstik.<br>
<br>
#14 - Kill Phinny, get the staff.<br>
<br>
#15 - Kill VS, get the staff.<br>
<br>
*****#16 - Go back to Halas, give the note from Kandin to Dargon. This will spawn Arantir. (Where did Arantir go from the earlier times you spawned him? If he is already up, do you have to give the note?)<br>
<br>
#17 - Give the Phinny Staff, VS staff, and Gabstik staff to Arantir. Arantir will give you a pack.<br>
<br>
#18 - Take the Pack to Solomen in Temple of Sol Ro. Give him the pack, you get the epic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry, but the spoiler really is confusing, and leaves a lot of questions to be answered. Would someone who has actually done the quest please read over my list and confirm those are the correct steps? Thanks.<br>

If you read through the Spoiler carefully...everything will make since...<br>
<br>
Step 3 - Handing Camin the 1000pp is basically increasing your TS faction and (if you were doing the quest w/out the spoiler) recieving further instructions to the quest...<br>
<br>
Steps 4-7 ; man you've really fucked this part up - Simply go to Dargon, purchase Ro's Breath (with charge) and bring it to Camin to be stripped of it's charge.  Once the potion is stripped...bring it BACK to dargon...spawning Arantir<br>
<br>
Step 9 - Return the ring from challice (you don't get a letter from Challice - only the ring you gave her) to either Dargon or Arantir (if he is still up once you return from your trip to felwithe - if not then hand to Dargon who will spawn back into Arantir)<br>
<br>
Step 16 - No Arantir will despawn back into Dargon after a certain amount of time - but handing dargon the note from Kandin will spawn him back into Arantir - who you give the three staves to, in return for the pack containing the four items you give to solomen<br>

Well, you sort of helped, but not really. I want to know how my breakdown is different from what the spoiler says. My steps 4-7 are as follows (With Quotes from the spoiler)<br>
<br>
<br>
#4 - Buy a Ro's Breath Potion, give it Camin to be stripped, get a potion back<br>
<br>
&quot;You can buy Ro's Breath from any of these vendors but you cannot return it to them. Neither of them will turn into Arantir. However, it is confirmed that you can buy Ro's Breath them, take it to Camin to be stripped of it's charge&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
#5 - Give the stripped Potion to Dargon in Halas, this makes Arantir spawn, and potion is returned<br>
<br>
&quot;and then take it to Dargon.&quot; Handing this potion to Dargon in Halas will make her turn into Arantir and the quest will continue.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
#6 - Give the potion to Camin, get a TS faction hit, potion is returned<br>
<br>
&quot;Now take this potion back to Camin in Erudin and hand it to him. He will reply with the following:<br>
<br>
Camin says 'Very interesting... I've seen this work before. Yes, yes! It's the work of Arantir Karondor! Give this back to the person you got it from. Maybe he will have a clue to Arantir's location.' <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
You gain experience!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Camin gives you back the potion (it has now been stripped of it's Shield of Lava charge)&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
***#7 - Give the potion to Dargon in Halas (wtf, the spoiler already said Arantir would be spawned in Step #5 - why would Dargon be there again? who do you give this potion to?) Arantir spawns (again?) - Get a note from Arantir.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;and you must take it back to Dargon in Halas.<br>
Note: you cannot skip the previous trip to Camin. You absolutely, must hand the potion to Camin. If you try to skip the trip to Erudin, you will get the following message from Dargon: &quot;I didnt request this item, but thank you very much&quot;.Back in Halas, hand the Ro's Breath potion back to Dargon.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
How is my steps 4-7 different from what the spoiler says?<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
MY STEP 3<br>
&quot;****#3 - Hail Camin, give him 1000pp ?????<br>
(This is already messed up in the spoiler, it says you can talk if you have good faction, it doesnt say what to do if you DONT)&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SPOILER SAYS<br>
<br>
&quot;Now hail Camin and he will respond with this -<br>
Camin says 'Go away! I have no time for you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If this happens, you can continue with the quest.&quot;<br>
(WTF? That makes no sense, if he says go away you can continue?)<br>
<br>
&quot;If you have good faction already, you can talk to Camin: &quot;<br>
(WTF? This makes even less sense)<br>
<br>
&quot;At this point, hand Camin 1000 platinum and the quest will continue.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry, but that is just confusing and poorly written. Basically, after all is said and done, you just give him 1000pp right? Why all that other bullshit?<br>

Ok, no matter WHAT your faction is, if you hail Camin he will say 'Go away!  I have no time for you.'  You can continue the quest.  <br>
<br>
If you have good faction already, you can talk to Camin... IF you have good faction, you say 'What are you searching for?'  He will initiate dialog with you, HENCE continuing the quest IF You have good faction.  It makes perfect sense, you're reading the spoiler poorly (no offense).<br>
<br>
Now, at this point give him 1000pp (no matter what he says or does) and you will continue the quest.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ***#7 - Give the potion to Dargon in Halas (wtf, the spoiler already said Arantir would be spawned in Step #5 - why would Dargon be there again? who do you give this potion to?)

<br>
You just totally screwed that part up heh.  BUY a potion from DARGON in Halas, BRING it to Camin, he strips it and gives it back to you, GIVE that STRIPPED potion to Dargon and she spawns the VERY FIRST Arantir who when hailed gives you the ring.  Steps 6 and 7 shouldn't exhist.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ****#9 - Give the letter/ring from Challice back to Arantir/Dargon in Halas (either one is ok?). This will spawn Arantir. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, it says you can give it to either Arantir (who will continue the dialog) or Dargon if Arantir has despawned (he despawns into Dargon after about 4 minutes of being up) just like the spoiler says. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> *****#16 - Go back to Halas, give the note from Kandin to Dargon. This will spawn Arantir. (Where did Arantir go from the earlier times you spawned him? If he is already up, do you have to give the note?)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Arantir is already long and gone if you have the Note <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> to</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Arantir.  He'll be in Dargon form.  Again, Arantir has only a spawn time of about 4-5 minutes then he reverts back into Dargon.  You *must* hand this note to Dargon so that she spawns the Arantir version (3 different versions) that accepts the staves and hands out the bag.  <br>
<br>
You're misreading the spoiler and interpreting it wrong, hehe.  I used this spoiler while doing my epic to make sure I was doing it right.. here's a quick breakdown:<br>
<br>
1. Temple of Solusek Ro, Hail Solomen, Get Note.<br>
<br>
2. Bring Note to Camin.<br>
<br>
3. Give Camin 1000pp.<br>
<br>
4. Goto Halas and buy a Ro's Breath Potion.<br>
<br>
5. Give Potion to Camin for stripping.<br>
<br>
6. Give stripped potion to Dargon, he spawns into Arantir.<br>
<br>
7. Hail this Arantir, he gives you a ring.<br>
<br>
8. Take Ring to Challice in Felwithe, give it to her, get a ring back.<br>
<br>
9. Give this new ring to Arantir or Dargon if Arantir has despawned, a new one will spawn.<br>
<br>
10. Hail him and engage in coversation, say 'What about the gnome?' Get Note FROM Arantir.<br>
<br>
11. Give note FROM Arantir to the Gnome, continue dialog, get sprocket.<br>
<br>
12. Hand in Green Oil from Broken Golem to the Gnome and get a Staff of Gabstick AND a Note TO Arantir.<br>
<br>
13. Goto Halas and give Dargon the Note TO Arantir, he spawns into the final version.<br>
<br>
14. Give this Arantir the Blue Crystal Staff, Staff of Gabstick, and Gnarlled Staff.. he will return a bag to you.<br>
<br>
15. Take this bag to Solomen in Temple of Solusek Ro and he gives you Sot4.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps!  Good luck!  And yes, you just give Camin 1000pp after you hand him the note from Solomen. <p><BR>

Again, if something happens with the quest, even if you lose everything to a KNOWN bug, if they see you skipped ANY steps, they won't reimburse ANYTHING.<br>

Happened to my old guildmaster back when she was going to have the VERY first Enchanter Epic on Povar.  The quest was in fact broken and she would have gotten item reimbursment... except for the fact that she skipped one small part (giving the SMR to the nome for factioN) which others had skipped.  Verant saw this and said sorry we can't help you.  <br>
<br>
Trust me, just do ALL the steps.  Losing Money and Time &lt; Losing three staves.<br>

The answer is 'yes,' give it to him anyway. I remember seeing a post long ago about someone trying this while a friend had Arantir targeted, and he went off target when handed the note. That means he respawned and is a new NPC as far as game mechanics go. Handing the wrong Arantir your staves could result in some serious heartbreak. Rombus' advice is best, don't skip a thing. <p><table><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#cc0000 strength=1)><font size=2 color=#ffff00 face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Daeanor Endarion of the Rathe</font></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm5>Staff of the Four - Epic Quest</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
