If someone said different, I could argue them down and come out on top. With the recent Lure nerfs and the Hate list / exp nerfs, our class has been notably decreased.<br>
<br>
 Things I don't mind:<br>
Necro's: Have a pet<br>
Wizard's: Don't....BUT a necro will never nuke as hard as us, ever. Their Dot's don't even get a chance to work before a mob is killed, in a large scale raid.<br>
<br>
Necro's get Dot's<br>
Wizard's don't.....but I have always taken it as &quot;We weren't meant to Dot, period. We are nukers, that is what we do and asking VI to change this, so that we can &quot;better solo&quot; is absurd IMO&quot;. Solo'ing is not what we are all about, nor is it what VI intended our class, nor any other class, to do. Learn to play your class effectivly and interract with other classes and people.<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
 Now the real deal:<br>
Wizard's lure got changed completly. The lure line of spells was supposedly hitting mobs with a Dragon breath save, it has now been changed to a Lifetap save.<br>
<br>
 C'mon in all honesty here...there was never a time that you could get Lure of Frost to hit Lady Voxx for full DD, nor Lure of Flame on Nagafen. The spell didn't need to get changed at all IMO.<br>
<br>
 When was the last time that you saw a Necro getting spells off on any Ubar mobs? Like Life tap for instance. yeah it was good in old Norrath, but for the wizards who are the appropriate level to use this spell (lure), we are all killing UBAR mobs, not Gnolls in Split Paw. Our resist rate is now through the ROOF and it is uncalled for IMO.<br>
<br>
 Lure line of spells did EXACTLY what they were meant to do, not get resisted. The spell was a sure bet on any mob that didnt have a direct resist to the spell. There is NO SUCH THING as a wizard who uses Lure spells at ANY time, other then on an ubar mob. With a spell that is VERY close to our level 49 Ice Comet, in cast time and mana....yet it only does 640 dd, instead of 1,120 dd...who would use it at ANY time, except for direct hits on mobs? So now a spell that costs us 400 mana and has a 4.0 second cast time, yet only does 640 dd.....can get resisted about 80% of the time. <br>
<br>
 At first, I said to myslf &quot;Ok np, I'll have to figure out what mobs have what resists&quot; I am a 56 Wizard and to be honest, 90% of the mobs will only take Lure of Ice or Lure of Lightning...rendering me, at 56, almost useless. I have to have a level 60 Shaman present, to cast Malo, at ALL time's, or I am just taking up space.<br>
<br>
 I just don't find this acceptable. At one point, wizard's were considered useless to other classes. because of the lack of &quot;friendly&quot; spells that we had and our DD's got resisted so much. VI impliments a line of spells that is meant to fix this, at least make us usefull and NOT get resisted, with the kickback of the spell having a crazy long cast time + a crazy mana cost, per spell. All through Kunark, wizards were finally usefull again. If you wanted to kill Venril Sathir, you had to have 8 Wizards, same went for Trakanon also. It felt really good to be needed by people finally.<br>
<br>
 To turn around and make us utterly useless, unless level 58 - 60, is *really* wrong to do IMO. I would just like to see the Lure line go back to the way it was. 400 mana and 4.0 seconds cast time, to do 640dd....SHOULD NOT be resisted IMO, the spell is useless with the resists in it and for such a demanding spell, there should really be a reward.<br>
<br>
 Agro lists / exp gains:<br>
<br>
 Cmon..you can't tell me that this hasnt been played with. To have a Wizard in your group, meant that you were going to get some exp, becase we were the almighty powerful wizards, we could NUKE! 3 monks, Druid, &amp; cleric were getting TONS of exp the other day. One of the 3 monks logged so the group leader picked up a lvl 53 Wizard and myself...we got MAYBE half the exp that the grop did with 3 Monks. It jst isn't fair...we are wizards, we ARE nuker's...why take our ability away, to nuke with ?<br>

Pre-Kunark, wizard were almost useless and a not desired class against ubermobs like Nagafen and Vox because we were insanely getting resisted. Then we got the lures spells and finally we were a class that was required tyo take down big mobs (finally something good). But why nerf lure spell, im lvl 60 and get resisted a lot now, i remember least venril, 6 cast out of 8 got resisted heh. Now we no longer really needed, just add a pure melee type.<br>
<br>
Exp nerf<br>
Two group i experimented latetly (all 55+)<br>
<br>
first one - 2 warriors, rogue, enchanter, cleric and a druid.<br>
<br>
second one - 3 wizards, cleric, shadowknight and a mage<br>
<br>
Hunting like this for few hours, second team never got a single kill even if they were dealing twice the damage first team could do.<br>
Wizard isnt the most desired class in a regular exp group in dongeons. With the nerf, we aslo not desired in multi-group hunting. i feel.. hmm .. bad. It seems the key class, whatever you doing, is warrior.<br>

Just needs to be presented in a non-confrontational manner.<br>
<br>
I believe the Lure issue is already known and will be fixed in the next patch.<br>
<br>
The EXP issue, Verant needs to do some testing.  A wizard should be able to control if the group gets EXP or not.  A warrior cannot do this hence that group always gets EXP.  In raids I was told to slow down or speed up my nuking to even out EXP to make each group feel like they were doing something.  This is no longer the case and is very disheartining.  They need to take a look on how EXP is awarded.  It sure isn't based off damage alone.  I believe it is a mix of aggro and damage.  But it's leaning a lil too much on the aggro side.  A taunting warrior with 2 procing blood points is kicking out a hell of a lot more aggro than I am.  But I'm doing a hell of a lot more damage than he is.  He will get the EXP the way it is currently set up for large groups of people.  There needs to be a balance set up so that EXP can be controlled in multi-group raids.<br>

I understand their rationale though, we aren't efficient.  For long dungeon crawls get someone who is.  But there we hit the critical point with the exp nerf.  Who gets exp in raids now?  The melee's get it all, wizard cannot pull exp into their group at all.<br>
   I'm not advocating that wizards be super KS'ers, not at all.  Just let us get our share.   I mean, it used to be that I got more exp on raids than in 6 man groups, simply because I was invited to raids, they needed me and the 6 man dungeon crawls didnt really need me.  That was ok, so I would just go on raids.  <br>
   Now I get 0 exp in raids at lev 56, unless someone else in my group does it.  Case in point:  on a 8 hour raid in Kael , my group got 2 kills, I was MEDDING and NEVER cast a spell either fight!  Yet on fights where I was determined to &quot;get us some exp! you're a wizzy right?&quot; (my group tells me) , I would nuke like mad doing over 5000 damage, and still no exp.   That is plain wrong.  Don't make us super KS'ers but if its gonna be that hard to get a group (without your local uberguilds help) at least let us get exp somewhere...<br>
   I really believe that Verant has attempted to reduce wizzy KS power, but I feel that someone misplaced a decimal point somewhere or something of that nature.  Its absurd that I can dump 5000 damage into a mob and get nothing then med and my group gets the kill.<br>
   I believe the obvious solution would be multi-group exp splits, but for some reason Verant seems unwilling to incorporate this feature.  If 40 people work hard for 7 hours to clear a zone, why must 6 people get all the exp?  is that right Verant?  <br>

60 Rogue,57 warrior,46 Rogue,54 Cleric,60shaman,and 60 Enchanter (no memblinking,shammie was pulling) got Xp over everyone and my group never got xp! normally wouldnt mind but we all focused on one mob and didnt and group was<br>
60 Wizard,56 Wizard,55 Wizard,59 Cleric,57 Druid (heh wasnt nuking,just healing in offtime),and i believe a 55 wizard. it Reaaaaaally made me mad that all of us nuking our lil hearts out couldnt get xp and just forced cleric to heal like mad. makes me mad as we got 0xp all night but oh well,but personally i think the share xp to any group who does a decent amount of damage (10%),though loot right should go to highest dmg group so KSing doesnt matter and should only be at higher levels (46+) as this is the levels of raids and people would use it for KS later on,Just an idea,hope you like it =)<br>

<br>
Before this we could take the spot first on this list by a large blast at the end when there is a lot of people popping in or out of the list, and get the exp. Now when it is 32 spots on an agro list we are again bested by the meele classes. As meele classes do more total damage over an interval that is longer than we can do half a burn. Now with 32 spots on the list they will not pop off it as they did when it was 6 spots so its impossible for a wizard to get their groups exp now even if we do a full burn as we are outdamaged by meele nowadays.<br>

<br>
Previously, ubermobs had no chance to resist a lure of any type.  This didn't make sense.  Hitting Lady Vox with Lure of Frost without her having a bigger chance to resist it doesn't make any sense.  Now ubermobs may have a chance to resist a lure of a certain kind.  For instance, Lady Vox will resist cold-based lures 50% and magic- and fire-based lures 0%.  This just makes sense.<br>
<br>
The resistance check was just a rumor.  Lures are still on &quot;dragon breath&quot; types saves.<br>
<br>
The only thing that *was* added by accident was a level check on lures.  Lures should have no level check.  This is a known issue and they are taking it out.<br>
<br>
That's all there is to lures.  Lures are just as marvelous as they were before, only you have to use your brain a bit when using them.  (Oh no, not that!)<br>

I seem to remember reading about mobs throwing extra saves vs lures now.  It's that part, if I understood correctly, which became the major part of the nerf/bug.  The programmer who responded and revealed this, also added that they were going to fix those extra saves so they wouldn't occur at all.<br>
<br>
If a mob had 0% resist to magic, then for exactly 100% of the time magic lures would land for full assuming the wizard was in melee range.  There seemed to be the implication that for *most* major mobs, they always had at least one dragon save set at 0%.  Is this wrong?  I'm curious to hear if other wizards found a lure that always worked on particular major mobs that required the use of lures.<br>
<br>
A bit after that, the programmer found out that PC lvls were actually a factor when the spells were tried on higher lvl mobs.  He said that shouldn't be the case, and would be fixed as well.<br>
<br>
I also recall some people saying this all started when Verant shifted the saves on lure spells to dragon-saves.  Intending to improve the lure line, Verant wound up nerfing it.  Hopefully Tuesday's patch will address this and clear up any confusion.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#33333><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufealith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fealith</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forum Apprentice</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>1/8/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>9:33:16 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://gofree.indigo.ie/~klan/almageste/fiches/fealith.jpg height=200 length=152></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: My Take on the recent nerfs</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">/agree Sorasil<br>
<br>
This change was 2 months ago. I discovered it against a kunark dragon. Usually only the killing group took the faction hit. But suddenly all the raid members took faction hit.<br>
The aggro list was increased.<br>
<br>
Before that, the tip was to cast a big nuke at the end of a fight if you want to get xps.<br>
<br>
Killer groups are now filled with monk or rogue. It's the proof that amount of damage is the key (rogues or monks would be killed or couldn't give the kill if the key was only aggro).<br>
<br>
With our limited manapool, it's now nearly impossible to get the kill with a big nuke or a full bar of mana (at least in Velious with the huge hp mobs).<br>
<br>
Ask your local chanter to memory blur mobs (if not resisted) before your nukes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
On the main topic : Lure.<br>
Lures are still on the dragon breath saves, but the dragon breath saves were nerfed.<br>
The real nerf on Lure is a second roll on the wizard's level vs mob's level. Verant told us that they will change that with the next patch (so hope Tuesday).</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucassiusruneblaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cassius Runeblaze</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forum Apprentice</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>1/8/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>9:40:34 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: lures were not nerfed</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial"><br>
One thing people are missing on raids is that we used to be able to stop corpses insta-rotting when the tank group etc. went LD. We can't now, and when you've just got 40 people together to kill an uber mob for the corpse to rot due to the people at the top of the list going LD its a pain. KSing in that situation was well liked...</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#33333><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ublique1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>blique1</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forum Apprentice</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>1/8/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>10:06:18 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Nerf</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Arguing over whether the definition of a nerf applies here is pointless.

lure spells - i thought they got repaird with the last patch, so a mob that has no save to ice can now never resist the lure of ice and i should do 100%dmg. at least thats why i understood (post of uzune)<br>

<br>
In the former, you hunt little frogs in Seb or whatever, and one group kills them, and multi-group XP is not an issue.<br>
<br>
In the latter, the mobs have way too many HP's for their level (and consequently, the XP they give).<br>
<br>
If you are hunting 10,000+++ HP mobs with multiple groups for experience, instead of a quest, or items, or for the hell of it, then you are, quite frankly, probably a brain addled high elf or gnome.<br>
<br>
If you aren't hunting them for XP, then why does it matter which group gets the XP from some overpowered dragon?<br>
<br>
I hate to have to resort to simplisticly dragging through simple logic point by point, but you forced me into it.<br>
<br>
Let's put it another way:  How many warriors gave a damn when their groups never got the XP?  I never found one.  Frankly, I very gladly give every shred of multi group raid XP in hate or fear or SoV or whatever for taunt to work well enough for the meat puppets to get it off that overambitious cleric.<br>
