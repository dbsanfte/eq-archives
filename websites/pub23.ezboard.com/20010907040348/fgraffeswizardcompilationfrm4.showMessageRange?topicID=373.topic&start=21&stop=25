Hey nonny nonny and a hootie hoo.<br>
<br>
Verant has said over and over that GROUPING is the main focus of the game.  They've made changes to the game and to classes themselves to discourage soloing.<br>
<br>
Sorry if you don't like the whining.  People do enjoy their wizards and want to play them.  But they get bitchy when they can't get a group and can't solo without bumming SOWs or camping jboots.  It's always been like this and Verant hasn't done a damn thing to change it.<br>

<br>
<br>
And I've quit trying to LFG's....<br>
<br>
<br>
And I've quit porting...<br>
<br>
<br>
And I've quit trying to educate the masses about the Wizard class...<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I solo, quad kite and nothing more...I try various mobs in different areas, some are neat, most just plain deadly. I get some varity of scenery that way.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for being negitive...well let me compare my various characters...<br>
<br>
level 40 Wizard - approx 1.5 months play time.<br>
level 40 Druid - approx 3.5 weeks play time<br>
level 31 Ranger - approx 3 weeks play time<br>
level 13 Monk - approx 36 hours play time.<br>
<br>
Each gets about the same play time per week, I started my Wizard first, yet my othere chars are advancing MUCH faster...I'm the same person playing all the chars...but my Wizard levels MUCH more slowly...<br>
<br>
This is fact, not some fool blowing off steam.<br>
<br>
Look again at the played stats and tell me that the Wiz class is balanced....<br>

Of course your wizard leveled the slowest.   Also, wizards are the class that least benefits from twinking.  Did you twink your other characters *at all*?<br>

<br>
As I've said before, yep yep yep, it's their game.  They can do with it as they please.<br>
<br>
I suggest they change it for a couple reasons:<br>
-Other games ruled with wizzies as powerful nukers, or awesome buffers/enchanters/utility people.  Before you put your foot in your mouth and bite my head off, note I said SUGGEST.  Other games did it well, it can work for EQ too.  SUGGESTION.<br>
<br>
-It's kinda expected.  This is a fantasy game.  Fantasy is generally build on D&amp;D, books, legends, and such.  Again, SUGGESTION.  It's an &quot;expectation&quot; simply because it's in the foundations of the genre.  If they want to make it different, that's FINE, it's their game.  It's my SUGGESTION because I like it the original way better. =)<br>
<br>
-They told us different from what we got.  At least in my opinion.  This is a quote from the EQ website.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wizards are second to none when it comes to casting powerful offensive spells.&quot;<br>
Mages are not far behind at all.  Wanna argue? Go look at the spell lists and compare.  No, not 100% of the time, but there isn't a large notable difference.  Large being the keyword.  &quot;Second to none&quot; means large in my head.  Seems like it's a notable difference.  I love being redundant.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Certainly, other magic users are proficient in their own areas, but the wizard is most effective in battle.       &quot;<br>
Yeah.  They just fixed that with the lures, etc.  Hadn't been true for 50+ for a long time, from what I understand.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is, as long as they have someone very sturdy to protect them from melee attacks.&quot;<br>
Generally always true.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me add to this: the original description told of wizzies as being the &quot;heavy artillery.&quot;  I remember that quote.  That also means &quot;much better than the 2nd best nuker&quot; to me.  This is not apparent to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's their game.  They can do what they wish.  Even if they told us otherwise.  I'm suggesting that they make certain changes to bring more balance and uniqueness to wizzies as a class.  And no, I'm not being a self certered little kid, I believe they should make changes to other classes as well.  This, however, is a wizzie forum, thus I post my wizzie related ideas. =)<br>
<br>
Flame me, whip me, beat me.  I'll always be back for more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In other words... yes, we do have a 'right' to complain and state things to them. They appreciate it and desire it.<br>
<br>
No company in their right mind would reject all customer input.&quot;<br>
<br>
Being the cynic I am, it seems that they delete a lot of well founded and respectable (good spelling, etc.) posts off of their boards.  I imagine it's just spam they get tons of and are sick of hearing:  I don't read the EQ forums enough.  Still, it seems to me that Verant gives many customers good helpings of the ugly-stick-to-the-face, and yet they pay their $10/mo. without question.<br>
<br>
I hate big business.  Bad ones that is.  And although I lack the direct experience with Verant to form a true opinion of my own, I do listen to lots of folks who seem credible.<br>
<br>
I'm really just neutral.  I just seem like a cynic. =P<br>
