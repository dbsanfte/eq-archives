At the end of the 3rd day Darkehawke imparted to the other 2 brothers the story of the legend of manaburn. And said to them, &quot;Though it is dangerous work, such powerful neutral magics would be of great ally not only to our brotherhood, but to our family as well in places of dire peril.&quot;<br><br>He informed them that he must leave again, but as he was packing he gave them certain items to help them in thier own quest for experience in the ways of combat. And that day he gated with the promise he would someday meet them again in the City of Mist once the secret had been revealed to him.<br><br>He set out at once for the transport to Luclin where the secrets would be reveales to him in gaves under the Grimling Forest. <br><br>In order to work his research he needed other magic practitioners to assist him in his quest, and he found them for they could all partake in the magical research to gain more experience to better harness magics. The only problem was that together they had the ability to cause great destruction, though because of thier lesser demeaner, much of thier channeled magics were wasted, so they needed an individual with the ability to anger as many creatures as possible so this reasearch tould be completed.<br><br>It was found that a bard singing foul tunes would work the best. Some were better then others though. The group changed many times over the months ahead, but they were never diminished, for as one left another came to take his place to continue the reasearch.<br><br>Darkehawke many times came close until he did discover quite by accident that the magics he was looking for were quite close to him the entire time. Though he could not wield the mana he was conjuring for either a destructive or even a constructive purpose, but the legend of manaburn was indeed true, he only needed to learn how to control and wield it.<br><br>Many weeks he worked at this until he was so close he could taste it. Shen a messenger came to the caverns and let him know his brother, the monk, had been harmed and needed help.<br><br>Darkehawke got leave from his friends and went to help his brother. When he arrived his brother had faked his demise and was lying in the ground, hovering above him were 3 foul looking creatures. These creatures were dispatched by the wizard and the two broke bread, sharing tales of thier travels. <br><br>Brotherhawke had news from the Warlord that his Eldest brother was needed for battle in the mighty Temple of Veeshan, at this news they embraced and Darkehawke departed for the lands of ice and dragons sending dispatch and offering magical transport to any guildbrother and sister who asked for it.<br><br>Further on, working his magic and the magics of guildbrothers a great chan of transport was set up to speed guildbrothers and sisters across treacherous lands. over the course of 3 days many deaths were died and many a foul dragon creature was slain. The honours were justly rewarded.<br><br>At the end of this affair along with his other Wizard and Druid brothers and sisters began transporting the weary Guild to thier respective destinations. <br><br>During this time he spoke with a peer in wizardry, Eelien, a guildbrother, who also was working on this great skill. They shared ideas and points of research, and both were greatly enriched by this exchange of information.<br><br>Darkehawke returned to his research in the caves beneath the great Grimling Forest, continuing still to work techniques with manaburn. Darkehawke set a goal for himself to complete the skill and be ready to wield it at the conclusion of the Fortnight, but a few accidents occured and he did not complete his reasearch in the time he had promised himself, his guild brothers and sisters and the Crimsonhands clan he would.<br><br>He became distraught with himself and his inability to complete his quest in the time he had alotted himself. He had worked hard, but aside from generating magical experience for the guild brothers and sisters that came and joined him, he had yet to see the fruits of his labors, and he was ashamed of himself.<br><br>Yet, his resolve would not be broken, the time was coming to spend more time with his guildkin, although when this time was passed he was resolved to return to his task with utmost fervor. He hoped at the completion of this quest to bring pride upon his brothers and his guild.<br><br> <p><BR><center><IMG SRC=http://www.enteract.com/~mofohawk/newdarkesig.jpg></center><BR></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showPrevMessage?topicID=27.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showNextMessage?topicID=27.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.emailToFriend?topicID=27.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.threadControl?topicID=27.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm30">Veeshan's Peak Key<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm31">Fusibility Research<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Luclin Spell Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Luclin Faction Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Luclin Quest Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Luclin Item Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm39">MOB Resistance Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37>Wizard Tales and Chronicles</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
