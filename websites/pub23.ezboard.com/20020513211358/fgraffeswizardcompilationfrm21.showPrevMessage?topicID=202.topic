one thing that those of us who do a LOT of ae grouping learn is that all enchanters are not made the same.  Two lvl 60 enchanters with similar gear can be miles apart in skill.  I can't really explain why this is (although there are a few factors I can name) but when you make AE groups a lot you would be well served to keep a list of relative skill.  Some enchanters can keep a huge number of mobs locked while others cant keep 10.<br>
<br>
some things to look for.<br>
<br>
Turn on showspelleffects but turn particle density off.  You can watch the chanters and see how fast their stuns are going off.  If one is stunning a LOT less than the other, he is either not very smart or is very lagged (neither being a good thing).<br>
<br>
watch for AE tash and don't let them do it.  This is suicide to enchanters in AE groups.  The only thing that keeps AE groups alive is multiple layered stunning, tash doesnt help that.  If you have 50 mobs in stun lock your probably going to get 4 to 12 resists per cast and AE tash wont reduce that much.  Further, the cast time on tash leaves an opening in the stun cycle where mobs aren't being layered with stun, this almost always leads to a momentary loss of lock where a beat down and relock has to occur.<br>
<br>
watch for chanters that dont move.  Unless you are using facing chanters across a path, your chanters are going to be constnatly pushing mobs away from them in the direction they are facing.  Chanters that stay where they are at as the mobs move farther away are asking for it.  Once mobs move out of stun range they will RUSH that chanter as soon as the current stun wears off.  This interupts the casts and predictable results follow.<br>
<br>
these are just some of the things ive noticed and thought I'd pass on to people jsut getting into AE grouping.  Feel free to add any advice to this based on your experiences.<br>

Here is a bit of advice that I can offer to other wizards hoping to learn and perfect the funky science of AE bombing:<br>
<br>
1.  Take your enchanter-specific advice from enchanters, not from wizards.  <br>
<br>
2.  You're the wizard; your job is by far the easiest unless you are the primary puller.   Stick to the role you know.  Just because you may be able to recognize that Joan Rivers and Michael Jackson look like hell does NOT make you a qualified cosmetic surgeon.<br>
<br>
3.  The number of AA points you have gained doesn't indicate anything except the amount of time you have invested.  Any idiot can get AA levels, given enough time.  If you need proof of this, you need only look at Dhalamarx.  He has not just ONE, not just TWO, not even just THREE or FOUR or FIVE, but FIFTY-TWO AA points.  Contrary to what he may have been brought to believe, he will NOT transcend corporeal existence and become an immortal being with scary powers when he gets his 53rd.<br>
<br>
Dhalamarx, it's extraordinarily bad form to insult (feeble though the attempt may have been) a person you've never met, and who has done nothing to you.  My personal theory is that people who offer unsolicited &quot;advice&quot;, attempting to speak from a position of expertise (known commonly as 'false authority syndrome'), are simply in need of some ego gratification for reasons that I'll happily leave to the psychology majors in attendence.  Perhaps your Ambnesia's post, which seemed to contradict some of your assertions, bruised your ego a little and made you feel just a little less sure of yourself for a few seconds.  Thus, the most swift and sure way to deflect the criticism you inferred from the post was to roofle and rofl and lol and omg and end it all with an extremely snooty, &quot;glad he's not on my server&quot;.<br>
<br>
Here's a bit of advice specifically Dalamerx. for Could be that you are not the ultimate authority on AE grouping.  Could just be that Ambnesia has been doing AE groups almost every night for months now.  Maybe, just maybe, Ambnesia has been doing it with the same core of friends for long enough that she has developed a technique that works exceptionally well for her and her group, and gosh, it could even be that her perspective is just as valid as yours, if not moreso (haven't yet met an enchanter who quad-kited her way to 60).  <br>
<br>
I'm glad Ambnesia's not on your server, too, because that also means that I'm not on your server. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufizziisotope.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fizzi Isotope</A> at: 3/2/02 5:00:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uniqlamor2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>niqlamor2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/3/02 1:05:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the scarry part</span><hr size=1> AOE stun DOES push back, I verified that just yesterday, both chanters were facing wall, wizzies didn't cast a single spell and yet mobs were pushed into the corner anyway. <br>
<br>
Oh and I grouped with Ambnesia, and other people from the team (Cablor etc), they're doing good, but chewing a bit too big of a piece at once IMO. Better do a few dozen 25ish pulls flawlessly than to die repeatedly doing 40s. <br>
<br>
I find that when you're pulling too many, you end up always waiting on the cleric's mana, and the benefit is negated. <br>
<br>

<br>
BTW I did a great AE in Seb the other day, with a 60 druid as puller/buffer (hmm POTG), Enc 60/57, Wiz 60/58, Clr 59, we were pulling all of d1/d2/entrance/exit and bridge to jail in 3 steps. Roughly 20-30 mobs on each pull, and we were still limited by respawn. <p>--<br><small>"I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of...Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all." -- Thomas Paine</small></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uambnesiavos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ambnesia VoS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/4/02 9:58:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the scarry part</span><hr size=1> Dhalamar, thank you for your useless information.  would you also like to tell the clerics how to play?  there is not a knockback effect to pbaoe stuns (knockbacks are coded in the sp.dat file for those that dont know).  the mobs move towards you because as they resist they move towards you to hit you.  also our lowest stun has a smaller range than the other 2 meaning the mobs in the back dont always get hit and move forward on that cycle.  <br>
<br>
mobs DO NOT move away from you when you pbaoe.  this is very easy to prove do it EVERY NIGHT FOR 3 MONTHS.  and your advice to have them moving around to use the push from pbaoe to move them is the dumbest idea i have ever heard.  moving gives you alot more chances to be interrupted with the old client has stopped but server still thinks you are moving problem (clients only send packets once every 6 seconds unless you do something, its why doing a slight turn immediately after you stop helps you not get the still moving interrupt).  having your back to a wall keeps you from getting moved when hit and helps you channel stuns through.  <br>
<br>
yes our pulls are long, we do alot of mobs at a time.  it takes time for the pullers to get them all there, in order to keep our down time low i try to conserve mana.  i have just cast an 8 second stun with no resists.  casting a 6 second stun 2 seconds later benefits you how exactly?   its a waste of mana and time since i now have gained no benefit but still have to wait on my gems to refresh.  glad i gave you a laugh though oh knowledgable one.  i'm glad i'm not on your server too if you are typical of it. <p><BR><BR><BR>

<br>
The knockback from the enchanter PBAOES's is<br>
a perceived effect in my opinion.  If the mob<br>
that is being stunned happened to have been<br>
in movement mode at the time that it was success-<br>
fully stunned, our refresh will position the mob<br>
instantly at the spot to which it had been moving<br>
without rendering the anim from point to point,<br>
and thus it appears that the mob was knocked<br>
back, when in reality, it was already there, and<br>
our refresh hadn't caught up with it yet.  Similar<br>
to rooting a fleeing mob and seeing it &quot;hop&quot; to<br>
its actual location.  Just my thoughts on it since<br>
the spdat doesn't jive with the idea of a knock-<br>
back property, and yet the mobs DO appear to<br>
move on occasion.<br>
<br>
As it stands, I play the enchanter and one of<br>
the wizards in the AE group with my friends.  I<br>
use Ogre Form to lessen frontal stuns and put<br>
my back to the corner to lessen the jolt and<br>
jarring of being whacked by a particularly resistant<br>
little bugger.  The mobs hop around and yet<br>
with Thunderclap herding, they get coralled into<br>
my corner and are lined up for the slaughter.<br>
I never move the enchanter to chase after mobs.<br>
My job is to stun-stun-and more stun.  I let<br>
the rest of the group herd them to me.<br>
<br>
We may not be the hottest AE group around, but<br>
we have a blast, and we enjoy great success.<br>
Just last night we had a personal best of 41<br>
mobs, and that made us quite proud of our own<br>
efforts.  So you can see, we aren't the uber of<br>
ubers, and we're still successful.  It just goes<br>
to show that there are different ways to go about<br>
things, and just because someone disagrees with<br>
the way someone else does something doesn't<br>
mean that either is right or wrong all the time.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I thought the Ogre Form was a nice<br>
touch, and placebo effect or not, it seems to<br>
work for me, so I keep it =)  It also provides a<br>
very visible target for the puller, heh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udhalamarx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dhalamarx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/5/02 3:56:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> boggle</span><hr size=1> <br>
for an enchanter to try and say tha stuns don't move the mobs is scarry.  Once again, this is like the single easiest thing to prove in the game.  Have 1 enchanter, pull 1 more, start stunning with the mob behind the chanter with the chanter facing away and watch the mob move in front of said chanter.<br>
<br>
not going to address the personal insults.  children like that just like to listen to themselves talk.  My original advice stands and if you want a sound ae group, they are good tips to follow.<br>

<br>
It's there. You can verify it. You get hit, you get pushed back. You hit something, you push it back slightly. <br>
<br>
Now some spells (Enc DD's, Thunderclap, Smite) do have an additionnal knockback in them. <br>
<br>
I can guarantee you you can verify this. In fact, I've tried several times and I can direct the mobs in the direction I want, if the other enc is not moving. I'm telling you, you CAN see it happening. It's very small, but you can see them jumping like 1cm up and back then falling. <br>
<br>
I don't know, try with green mobs and chain stun them; you'll see what I mean.  <p>--<br><small>"I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of...Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all." -- Thomas Paine</small></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uniqlamor2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>niqlamor2</A> at: 3/6/02 5:07:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uambnesiavos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ambnesia VoS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/6/02 6:26:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: boggle</span><hr size=1> i do notice the mobs warping a very minute bit.  this is not our spells moving them this is the client syncing up with the server.  you can hold them with stuns for hours and they never will move out of the reach of your spells as he was implying.  like was said by someone before me its the same thing as seeing a mob move a small amt when you root them.  this does not mean root has a knockback effect to it. <p><BR><BR><BR>

If the spell had no knockback at all, you wouldn't see anything listed in the spdat concerning it for the spell.<br>
That said, the displacement effect from enchanter stuns is negligible, you will see more movement due to damage AE's and stun-resisted mobs movement.<br>
<br>
It is still a good idea to face into a corner to keep them as tightly packed as possible, but the stunner can be standing a step or two back... that allows stunning all the targets and mashing them into the corner, while also not having any of them in a position to backstab the enchanter if it is done right.<br>
<br>
Placement gets more and more critical as you add more targets. If doing large volume AE's, its likely you will gather up mobs in more than one pull, keeping the first (and second etc) group of targets stunned while you wait for the rest to arrive. While the enchanter is keeping them stunned, we (wizards, or other AE damage casters) can help by using AE's WITH knockback, like Thunderclap, to push any outlying mobs into the corner with the rest of the pack, reducing the chance any will drift out of the AE stun or DD areas once you have enough to be worth burning down.<br>
<br>
Even with the best enchanters, I would say you need 2 if you plan on killing more than 15 at a time, or the lack of overlap, the law of averages, and resist rates to the stuns will kill the enchanter.<br>
<br>
If the enchanter dies from a large pull, so does everyone else unless they can escape or FD successfully, and thats a matter of wild luck in most cases. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uniqlamor2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>niqlamor2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/6/02 10:52:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Knockback while AE'ing</span><hr size=1> Ambnesia, <br>
<br>
I used to think there was no knockback. Now I'm 100% positive there's a small one. <br>
<br>
How do I know? We typically hold mobs stunned for like 2 mins with 2 encs. We usually have wizzies pulling with epic, so they don't nook, so they can't be the ones pushing. Moreover, to reduce display lag, I usually face the corner, and ask the other chanter to do so. <br>
<br>
Initially, all the mobs are behind me. <br>
<br>
1 minute later, almost all of them are between wall and me.<br>
<br>
You might not notice the mob moving at all if you're facing it while stunning it, but if you chain stun it, and it moves forward, it HAS to be moving!<br>
<br>
Try it for yourself!
