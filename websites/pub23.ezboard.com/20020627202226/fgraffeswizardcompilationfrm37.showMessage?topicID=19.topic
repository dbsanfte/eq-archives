Fair warning.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I. The Teir'Dal</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Eventually, Solusek Ro came to test the Koada'Dal of Tunare. In his eyes, Tunare had blessed the Dal for years and made them weak.  The Elddar Forest prevent the invasion of outside armies.  The purpose of Dal had passed with the end of the Age of Scale.  Tunare's protection of their land from the hated Teir'Dal kept the Koada'Dal weak.  Their faith is all what mattered.  Eventually, their faith left them and assumed Tunare would continue to guard them.  Indeed she did, but Solusek Ro, The Burning Prince, came to remind them of what loyalty was.<br><br>A Teir'Dal, in ragged clothes fell forward through the forest.  His stumbling brought before a wizard guild that had been dedicated to Ro.  The Koada'Dal present were cautious at first, their guards had their weapons ready.  Two wizards, present, however took the young Teir'Dal in and sheltered them.  Ironically, one of them was the guild's leader.  When the guards protested, the leader ordered them to return to Takish-Hiz and report it to the king if they held a problem with his decision.  The guards did just that.<br><br>The wizards quickly learned that their sheltered Teir'Dal was a fellow wizard.  This discovery broke down several of the barriers of mistrust, but not all.  When the time came for them to confirm their dedication to Solusek Ro, the Teir'Dal joined them.  The discovery that a hated enemy followed Solusek Ro removed the racial barriers.  The Teir'Dal was welcomed among the Koada'Dal worshippers.<br><br>Eventually, however, the guards did make their report.  The king sent out an legion to arrest to the Teir'Dal and disband the wizard guild.  Ro was gracious to the wizards, and when the legion finally arrived, the Teir'Dal was not to be found.  Even the wizards were puzzled.  The legion departed, not completing their orders, with beliefs that the guards of the guild were drunk.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> II. Plasmatic Priesthood</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Solusek Ro grew angry with the Koada'Dal for their attack against the Teir'Dal he sent.  The flames of sun reached toward Norrath, creating a draught.  As the land dried up, small fires began in the forest.  The druids began to combat Solusek Ro's magic and summoned great storms to combat the draught.  It seemed as if the Elves might survive Solusek's curse.  But his magic would be so easily defeated.<br><br>Solusek sent visions to the wizards of the guild that housed the Teir'Dal.  When they awoke, they met in council to discuss the dreams.  Shortly after, they formed the Plasmatic Priesthood, which is now known for its worship of Fennin Ro.  The Priesthood travelled among the Elddar Forest, spreading the warning of Solusek.  Most considered them drunken fools and disregarded their warnings.<br><br>Realizing the futality of trying to teach their heathen brothers, turned to subvert the druidic efforts the counter Solusek's efforts.  Whisking away a group of clerics, the Preisthood travelled to Hills of the Serpent.  Channeling the awesome powers of Solusek Ro in conjuration with the cleric's Earthquake spell, the the hills arched upwards, creating the Serpent Mountains.  The heat exhausted in the effort banished the rain storms the druids summoned.<br><br>Angered with their actions, the crown sent the entire Koada'Dal army out to drive the Preisthood out from the Elddar Forest.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> III. The Flaming Spear of Solusek Ro</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Solusek Ro grew tired of toying with the Elves of Tunare.  He had given them plenty of chances to change their ways.  Conjuring up a great firestorm, Solusek Ro swept away the forest of the Elves.  The city laid open before the armies of the Teir'Dal.  As the armies of Innoruuk approached, Karana summoned a squall to give the Koada'Dal time to flee.<br><br>Solusek Ro grew angry with Karana and his actions.  As the armies of Innoruuk came closer to the city of Takish-Hiz, Solusek Ro finished his curse.  Hefting his great Spear of Flame, Solusek Ro herled it into the heart of the the Elven Empire.  The burning flames created a great current in the air and the squall of Karana was blown away.  The raging flames engulfed the land and the sea retreat, creating a vast and barren desert.  The invading Teir'Dal army was completely destroyed along with the Koada'Dal warriors who stayed behind to combat the Teir'Dal army.  Feir'Dal druids fled with their kin to the lands of Butcherblock to avoid the flames.<br><br>What remained of Takish-Hiz was turned into the Deserts of Ro, serving as a reminder to the Elves of their mistake.<br><br>-Ikeya <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utinthalastigris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tinthalas Tigris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/21/02 7:22:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Fall of Takish-Hiz</span><hr size=1> uhh..<br><br>what was the elves' mistake?<br><br>Tinthalas <p><IMG SRC=http://www.cpl.net/~tetsuo/level2/pops.jpg><BR>1g of Protein per serving</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eaminwhitefalcon>Eamin Whitefalcon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>¡Viva la inquisición!</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/24/02 4:30:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Fall of Takish-Hiz</span><hr size=1> Being WEAK.<br>Being WEAK is not something Solusek Ro likes. <p><center><img src="http://web.tampabay.rr.com/eqsite/Eamin2.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uevantineessidel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evantine Essidel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://evantine.homestead.com/files/Eventine.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/26/02 1:19:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Fall of Takish-Hiz</span><hr size=1> I always thought that it was because he believed the time of the Koada`Dal were over, that they were interfering with the balance. Solusek is all about the balance of power and how everything is equal to the eyes of flame.<br><br>I thought I'd post <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> story under this thread, seeing as how my character as well as my friends are involved with the fall of Takish-Hiz (ignoring all sense of time, but whatever). Befallen really is the ruins of Takish-Hiz, and there is an NPC named Cmdr Windstream there. My best RL friend's character is Rone Windstream, and there was an intricate storyline with friends we met online that since, well, we've gone different ways (I refuse to speak to Doner again, unless it's to open fire). Noks Norespite and Shuglen Battleforge remain close friends of mine, however.<br><br>Without further ado:<br>------------------------------<br>        My name is Evantine Essidel, High Elf, scholar of Norrath, Wizard of the Tranquil, son of Eve and Eric Essidel, previous Council Member of the Knights of the Silver Moon, member of the Iron Tower, and this is my story. <br><br>        My father was a paladin. He was Captain-Commander of Takish-Hiz, protector of the King himself, alongside his old friend, Rygil Windstream. My mother was a wizardess of the city’s researchers. She held an office and had a powerful word in the Council of Arcane Arts in Takish-Hiz. They met through mutual acquaintances, married, and birthed me. <br><br>        This all took place during the fall of the Elven Empire in what was then known as Tunaria, and is now Antonica. The researcher guild in which my mother was a part of was in the process of developing new magics, spells that would allow us to enter the heavens and allow the heavens to enter us. Spells of protection, evocation, conjuring, and many many others were being created the likes of which the world had never seen before. One of these spells was a teleport to an entirely different plane of existence. <br><br>        Long before had the gods gathered together to seal Rallos Zek, the god of war, into the Plane of Power, his domain. There was an absolute barrier, which prevented anything from entering, and anything already inside from leaving. Rallos Zek had been efficiently dealt with. <br><br>        Altar Plane: Power had been created, by my mother as well as other researchers. They had found how to destroy the seal the gods had created and allow them entrance to this powerful area. However, this would lead to the God of War himself being allowed to escape what had held him off for so long. Once the barrier had been compromised, it would be useless forever after. <br><br>        The Throne of Thex had disapproved, but my mother had been a powerful orator and advocate of this spell. The ultimate goal was not to use it, but by understanding how to break the seal to another plane would open up theories, possibilities, and eventually spells on how to enter less dangerous, and more profitable ones, that were bound to exist, such as Tunare’s own Plane of Growth. She concluded that the research in her spell would eventually lead to developing many others. And so, she was charged by the King himself to protect this spell from falling into others hands, on her life if need be. She was sworn in and kept the spell always safely away. Until I was born. <br><br>        Eve Essidel died during complications of the birthing process. My father had been left a single parent with me, only an infant child, to take care of. The task was daunting, until his good friend, Rygil, stepped in. <br><br>        Rygil had several children of his own. The Windstream brethren had never quite gotten along with each other, but they were always a large family, and with some of the most respected members of Takish-Hiz represented in their lines. Rygil promised Eric that I would be well taken care of with his other children by their mother, and my father consented. Thus is how I came to meet the Windstream family. <br><br>        However, this was a bad time for Takish-Hiz. Solusek Ro was in full power, destroying the fertile grounds of the Elddar Forest and sweeping Tunaria with a drought the likes of which the world had never seen. His minions of Flame were sent into Takish-Hiz regularly, but all the time the forces led by my father and Rygil Windstream fended them off. But as the power of the druids failed, the power of Ro’s minions increased. Every day the fight was getting harder, and every day we lost more men. Takish-Hiz was crumbling. <br><br>        The eldest Windstreams were old enough to take the sword and fight in battle, and the smallest were sent to their aunt in High Keep, along with myself. The fight against the orcs of the Highpass was constant there, in the gateway from one side of Tunaria to the other, but it was safe. Safer by far than Takish-Hiz, at the moment. <br><br>        My father and Rygil fought together while the Elddar Forest burned around them, while Takish-Hiz crumbled. They fought bravely, and they fought well. But the power of Solusek Ro was overwhelming. To keep the royal family alive, to protect them while they escaped the falling city, they would have to give their lives. <br><br>        My father held Eve very dear to him. As such, he had never touched her things after she had passed, nor meddled with any of her spells. As such, the teleport to the Plane of Power was still there. Since my mother had died during such a period of turmoil, it had gone unnoticed, until the fall of Takish-Hiz was around all their heads. Only then did they realize what they truly stood to lose, what was held in a simple spell scroll in the Essidels home. <br><br>        My father had to retrieve the scroll, had to see it out of Takish-Hiz safely. Rygil had to stand his ground, to stop the army from overtaking King Thex, and now to stop them from obtaining a spell that could wreck havoc on the world anew. <br><br>        Thus it was that Eric Essidel escaped the fall of Takish-Hiz. Rygil Windstream did not. <br><br>        I say escaped, but I use the term loosely. My father had known where he was meant to have fallen. Perhaps with his help, Rygil would have survived. He was with me, in High Keep, but I am told that he was not the same. He would be found often contemplating the spell he held in his hands, in the room with me, and staring off to the horizon, towards the ruins of Takish-Hiz, towards what was now called Befallen. A city twisted in evil, a city corrupted where the dead walked the halls. <br><br>        I am told, one night, he burned the scroll, kissed my forehead, donned his sword and cloak, and set off towards the ruins. He was never seen again.<br><br>        I grew older, with the Windstream children who had been sent to High Keep. Sarahly, my younger by 2 years, and the twins, Doner and Rone, my elder by a week, became friends. But while Doner and Rone practiced with the sword and strength, I seemed to develop more of an affinity to the library, and to Ran Flamespinner. He confronted my guardians, whom I call Aunt and Uncle Thafter, but are in actuality only the Windstream’s family, and they gave their consent for him to teach me the arts of wizardry. <br><br>        Time passed. Doner and Rone discovered their true heritage, which had been kept from them until it was decided that they were ready to leave High Keep, and they decided to travel to Faydwer, to the forests of the Faydark, new home of the elves, to meet for the first time their brothers Corlyn and Silveron, whom they had been separated from after they had fought at Takish-Hiz. As a close friend eager to see the world, I traveled with them. <br><br>        I was thrilled by the prospects for adventure, to see the world and experiment with the art I had spent so much time learning in the libraries of High Keep alongside my mentor Ran. There was so much to see, so much to do. Through Kithkor the first day, the Commonlands at night, and in the morning, Freeport. <br><br>     Freeport. Such a city I had read about, but I did not fully understand the glory or the decay. At the time it seemed a million kingdoms of buildings and walls, structure and architecture the likes of which I had not seen before. Yet underneath you could sense the decay and politics of the region, the everlasting battle between the corrupt militia and honorable paladins. The city was already beginning to lose its glory to the decay that was overrunning it. I was allowed to stop at the Academy of Arcane Sciences, and the trip, although brief, amazed me. The library in High Keep that had seemed so filled with knowledge paled in comparison to this. It worse than paled, it was laughable when compared. The Academy was magnificent, it was huge, it was amazing. It made the mind reel with the amount of knowledge confined within those walls. <br><br>        I found myself on the Siren’s Bane, in the Ocean of Tears, almost weeping for the sheer beauty of the sea. It captured me, and I was caught up in the sweep of ocean across the galley, the wind that filled the masts. It was quite the opposite of Doner’s newly found sickness for this form of travel, and Rone’s distaste for the long waiting period; I was enchanted. I couldn’t simply pass through, I had to pause for a time here, had to see all that was to offer. When the boat left from the port at the Sister of Erollsi Isle, it left without me. I would catch up to the Windstreams later. <br><br>        I spent a week or so there, absorbing tales from travelers and gaining knowledge from the Sisters. I swear, I almost became a bard of Erollsi that week, life devoted to traveling and adventure, telling tales wherever I went of heroes and legends. A dwarven adventurer shook me out of my illusions, however. <br><br>        He had been on the isle simply to get some food, and then had taken a walk along the shore, when a pirate had attacked. I, standing on the dock and talking with the Stormbreaker’s captain about various ways of reading the stars, saw it happen, and felt the power of the Arts fill me. It had been some time since I had used evocation, and I had never used it on a living thing. Yet as the warriors steel clashed against the pirates, I knew what I must do. <br><br>        Years of channeling, and I have yet to feel anything different each time I do it. You allow an intensity to flash over your mind, focusing all your thoughts on your act. Sometimes the words are spoken, sometimes not, but always they are felt, felt as though there is nothing in the world but the translations of pure energy into words, into thoughts, into one singular goal. Suddenly spells begin to flare around you, flame and ice and particles of mist, flung transporting you to locations in an instant and transporting the enemy closer to death. A maelstrom of power fills you, becomes you, and that is all there is. There is nothing else. Then, as quickly as it came upon you, it is over, a feeling of slight fatigue and tiredness all that is left. Never surprise at what you have done, even the first time. There was only understanding and acceptance. I was a wizard. <br><br>        Despite my efforts, the warrior had been injured and unfit to travel. He was forced to take under the care of the Sisters for a time. I decided to stay until he was gone. We quickly became friends. He taught me of the warrior’s way, why they did what they did and what I could do to help in a battle. He also taught me how to carve. <br><br>        This man was a sculptor, and a talented one at that. His carvings were beautiful. Stone wasn’t his only tool, but steel, metals of all sorts. His ancestors trade was smithing, and the knowledge would pass from one line to the other. Gems and jewels of the finest quality he was able to render, and the dwarfs natural feel for all of the earth’s gifts amazed me. I asked for him to teach me, and he gave his consent. I was never quite as good with it as him, not even close, yet I was pleased by how easily it came to me. He said that I had developed a knack for carving things from wood, which “probably stemmed from my pointy ears”, as he put it. I had been an elf my entire life, yet never had I felt close to my brethren, for I had no contact with them. It made me feel good indeed to have something more than physical appearance in common with my race. My love for the woods was there, and I could use that to render the most interesting carved images. <br><br>        When it was time for me to depart, the Sisters of Erollsi presented me with a gift. Two amazing sapphires, a blue as deep as the ocean itself, with the silver linings of the waves. They called them the gifts of the sea, the tears of the ocean itself. My new acquaintance had mumbled that they weren’t of much use, however, and set to work sculpting them. With incredible grace and carefulness that only a dwarf could have for the earth and rock, he created from the pair of tears dice of amazing beauty. The Sisters of Erollsi, first shocked he was defiling the gift, fell into an awe at the amazing way he had transformed the gems, their many facets and corners shimmering in the sun. I left the Ocean of Tears with something that the dwarf had swore would be more useful in adventuring than the mightiest sword or spell, if luck was with me. At the time, I wasn’t sure what he meant. <br><br><br><br>        When I arrived in Butcherblock, I could see traces of the Faydark in the deep valleys of the mountains. Trees were scattered here and there, forests to the eyes of one whom had never seen anything close to that except for the darkness of the Kithkor forest. My excitement to be in the forests so many of my kind called home was overwhelming, and my desire to push on tried to drive me onwards. But there was so much that Kaladim had to offer, and night was coming on, the Greater Fay still a half a days walking distance away. I yearned to find what Rone and Doner had done since their arrival, yet there was no avoiding stopping in Kaladim overnight. Besides which, my dwarven friend from the Ocean of Tears had requested I make a delivery for him to a nephew of his. <br><br>        So I entered Kaladim, not knowing what to expect. Grizzly dark caves with barbaric dwarves eating whatever meat they find down there on mice or men was a picture that was placed in my head at childhood, but I had learned quite a bit since that time. As soon as I caught sight of the entrance from down the path I was traveling, I was astounded. <br><br>        I had known that dwarves were magnificent with stone. I had witnessed it firsthand, from my dwarven friend, but I had failed to make a simple connection. That dwarf was a warrior, bred to battle, and taught to use stone because that was the work of his people. Some dwarves became not warriors, but stonemasons, and devoited their life to what was his hobby. And their devotion showed clear on the entrance to Kaladim. <br><br>        The mountain itself was carved into a castle. Above the entrance to the caved home of the dwarves was a gigantic likeness of the King himself, depicted with an axe close at hand. It was unlike anything I had ever seen. <br><br>        The city itself, once I was able to tear my eyes from the huge sculpture outside, was much the same. Castles of stone loomed inside the mountain, carved from the mountain. The dwarves lived lives imbedded in their work, their love. Everywhere you looked you could see all sorts of precious metals glistening from the walls and buildings. I had never been comfortable with my eyes unable to view the sky, but this…this was different than anything I had ever seen before. <br><br>        I made my way through the city, gazing at everything, absorbing it in. Ducking into buildings (literally), I managed to find directions from the friendly merchants to the cleric guildhall, and the nephew of the veteran warrior I had befriended recently. <br><br>        “Shuglen Battleforge?” I asked as I knocked on the door that the cleric guild leader had directed me to. My head scraped the ceiling as the door suddenly swung in. <br><br>        There was mild resemblance to his uncle. His beard was grayer, which was odd, for he would be younger, and his body lacked the battle hardened muscles I had come to expect from all dwarves. They were certainty there, just less of a presence as in most of the dwarves. While it was likely he would be able to lift me and all of my possessions with short arm, he appeared somewhat weak, for a dwarf. His graying beard was thick and curly, but it resembled a rats nest, full of tangles and somewhat frizzy. But what struck me were his eyes. They were not the hardened eyes of a warrior or a miner. They were a pale gray, and they shimmered with a kindness and sense of humor I had not witnessed in a dwarf before. I hadn’t exactly met an army of dwarves at this time, but from the start, Shuglen Battleforge looked like a healer. He looked like he cared. <br><br>        He grunted (more of a hum, when compared to the strong grunts of other dwarves, but quite a grunt to a High Elf) as he read the letter, and then tossed it to me. I took it as his blessing to read what I had carried all this way for him. <br><br>Shuglen, ye knuckle headed excuse fer a dwarf, <br>        Bah! This journey already is a bad idear. I should have known when I had decided ter take yer stinkin hide with me ter see yer own aunt and uncle, who had raised yer since yer were too small ter tell an axe from a shield, that yer wouldn’t a cared ter go back ter that flamin halflin excuse fer a village. A village er pranksters and tricksters most like, and yer cousin Noks is the werst one of em! I aint lookin forward ter spendin time with that one one bit! But fer Brell’s sake, yer could have at least been comin along ter help me fight through bloody Kithikor, or at least help a dwarf heal in peace instead of with all those bloody halflings! I never even bloody made it that flamin far! I get halfway through that Ocean of Tears, and along comes a bloody pirate, tryin ter take the measly gold I have! It takes a bloody flamin wizard ter help me, and I hate thems sort of magic enough, never mind it been a flamin elf, and never mind the annoyance er him tryin ter pump me fer infermation while I slowly heal on that damn island! Bloody nosey, that one, wants ter know everythin there is to know! Yer better show him right though, boy, er else when I get back ye’ll be in worse than ye already are! Ar! Next time yer be sleepin while I be goin, I’d be right ter toss yer in the bloody fountain! Undependable, that’s what yer are! When I get home, I might just learn some of them halfling tricks just ter teach yer a bloody lesson! And I hate halfling tricks! <br><br>Yer Bloody Annoyed Uncle<br>        Several times I nearly laughed aloud when reading this. Shuglen had already seemed to forget that he had read it and was looking at me with an odd look on his face. “So, what did you do to get him to like you so much?” <br><br>        I laughed and told my story, which led to others. Shuglen listened to them all patiently, and even contributed a few of his own. In the morning I departed for the Greater Faydark, and Shuglen saw me off. He even told me that Tarkar Blazetoss was the one I sought, and gave me a rough description of where I could find him.
