You left this part out.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> “The force fired two tank shells in order to deter the crowd from approaching,” the statement said. An initial inquiry “indicates that the force erred in its action,” and an investigation was continuing, the army said.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The Israeli military agrees with you.  I do not think firing a tank shell into a crowd is ok, nor do the Israelis.<br>
<br>
Still, I will NOT equate the rash, snap, heat of the moment decision of a young Israeli military man or woman with the cold calculated decision to take a kid, teach him to hate so much that he thinks it is a good idea to blow himself up as long as he gets some Jews with him, prepare him for days, select a target of innocents, then send him on his way. Will you?<br>
<br>
I think that is the accurate comparison of the Israeli shell incident vs. the terrorist leaders' actions.<br>
<br>
Of course, if there any evidence that the Israeli action was calculated, taught, or even condoned, I reserve the right to re-evaluate my position.  Likewise, if there were a pattern to suggest that is not an accident, I would likewise reserve my right to change my mind.  However, I will not assume that every time things go badly, in a horrible urban combat situation where Israel's enemy has blurred the line between combatant and civilian, they are targetting innocents.  I simply do not see them doing that now.<br>
<br>
I also do not think I am an &quot;apologist.&quot;  I am happy to condemn anyone, or any nation, if what I see warrants that.  I  just do not see that with Israel.  We have had our military people make mistakes in the field, and I do not think that makes us a bad country.  If there was a similar incident in another country, and the military admitted it was a mistake, I would react the same way.<br>
<br>

I will say, it is nice to be able to discuss something this charged without people going postal.  This is a very important topic for everyone in our world, and I learn a lot from you all.<br>

Remember, this happened last weekend as well. And the helicopter attacks on political offices -- which weren't even said to have any military or terrorist aspects, they were just sending a message -- and of course the attacks on Arafat's home are well-documented.<br>

<br>
     Who is apologizing?  The IDF is admiting that something went wrong and is investigating.  Everyone is troubled that tear gas wasn't used.  I certainly don't know anyone who is happy about these kids dying or any Jews who are claiming that killing kids is a valid form of conflict (as opposed to the Palestinians, and others, who seem to think killing kids is &quot;freedom fighting&quot;)<br>
<br>
     However, we don't know all of the facts on the ground yet.  There was a curfew.  It was violated.  Palestinians have strapped bombs to kids before and used them to kill Israelis.  And, this unit was checking for bombs, in Jenin, a.k.a., Suicide Bomber central.  The Israeli's saw a curfew breaking crowd come towards them, in hostile territory.  Maybe some 20 year old Israeli commander went all Mai Lai on this market place, or, maybe, they paniced and fucked up.  We won't know until the investigation.  Israel is investigating, its the Palestinians and their supporters who apologize for suicide bombers and refuse to investigate or stop it.  <br>
<br>
     It certainly isn't the policy of the Israeli government to do this sort of thing, but it is the unofficial policy of the PA as seen through the Al Aqsa Martyr's brigade and documents linking Arafat to terrorist financing.  After all, if it were not for Wed and Thursday's attacks, Israel would not have been in Jenin today and this would never have happned. <p>Torcer Arcana - 60 Sorcerer - Brothers of Darkness - The Nameless</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrindel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grindel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/02 11:08:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1215.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/grindel/elminster.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alan Keyes's tirade. . .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Normally, we would ask for the Palestinians to prove the massacre before we found Israel guilty.

In trying to win a propaganda battle Israel put itself in a position to lose the propaganda war.  As a person who tries to get news from many sources, I'd say the media has been fairly balanced in their reporting, with American media being a bit more Israeli-leaning than say Canadian media. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ustumpeyfyzzbang.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stumpey Fyzzbang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/02 11:09:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1215.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pages.prodigy.net/cohmsford/america.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alan Keyes's tirade. . .</span><hr size=1> Again, I think they were wrong to fire the shells.

We can argue back and forth forever about who is right and who is wrong.  My initial point, however, was not so much that as how entrenched the sides are in their positions.  I do not think peace is possible there.<br>
<br>
Now, if there was some way to effectively remove the extremists from the cause (not political ones, but the ones who want to blow things up), then maybe it could happen. <p><font face=impact>

     Surely you are joking.  The Palestinian &quot;leaders&quot; asserted that a massacre happened, they had no interest in finding if it actually happened.  They blamed Israel, with no evidence.  This was to put international pressure on Israel, which worked . . .  until the evidence that no massacre happened became overwhelming.  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.israelinsider.com/channels/diplomacy/articles/dip_0204.htm">The Palestinians have been known to lie before about those that &quot;allegedly&quot; have been killed.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.idf.il/english/announcements/2002/april/reka1.stm">And Israel had very real reason to believe that the Palestinians were not above bringing in bodies from outside of Jenin to fake a massacre.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  <br>

Sanctioning Arafat only makes things worse; there just isn't anyone else in his organization with the network and contacts he has among Palestinians.  Plus most of the countries in the area insist that any talks involving Israel and a Palestinian state have to involve Arafat.  Israel has a real chance at peace with its neighbors for once and bumping off Arafat would absolutely deep-6 that prospect, and turn him into a martyr.<br>
<br>
Sharon, an elected official, refuses to sit at a table with Arafat.  Arafat isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  So what does that tell you about what step needs to be taken to get the ball rolling again?  It's going to depend in part on the Israeli ballot.  I'm sure Torcer could come up with a Palestinian act that predated this, but I seem to remember that a lot of this escalation started when Sharon very publicly visited a joint holy site, reminding Palestinians of previous massacres that some people attribute to him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uclaudshadowflare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ClaudShadowflare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/02 1:25:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1215.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arafat</span><hr size=1> Walking into Afghanistan and declaring peach is a bit different than Israel.

Israel is a leading player in todays' securities market.  Do you see the difference between the two?<br>
<br>
And cutting off aid to Israel would be a big mistake.  Someone else would give them the money and they'd form new alliances.  China would be more than happy to take over as Israel's lead benefactor.<br>

Who is right and who is wrong?  No one can say, the very least of all me.  There is no higher moral ground here; both sides can justify war on each other, and until both sides learn that war isn't getting them anywhere, peach is, unfortunately, not possible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eaminwhitefalcon>Eamin Whitefalcon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>¡Viva la inquisición!</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/02 1:38:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1215.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web.tampabay.rr.com/eqsite/Eamin_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arafat</span><hr size=1> How the hell would China benefit from becoming Israel's ally?

     We don't know this.  What we do know is that Arafat is a major part of the problem.  He certainly didn't do his people any favors in June, 2000.  He should be exiled.<br>

     How dare a Jew visit the sight of the TEMPLE, the holiest sight in all of Judaism!  The Audacity!  You know, the Temple that the Arabs built a Mosque on top of?  That a Jew, visiting the holiest place in the universe to them, should incite the Arabs to riot, is a very sad statement about tolerance in the Arab world.  Its worth noting that when the Arabs controlled the Temple Mount, prior to 1967, Jews were forbidden from visiting.  However, Jews allowed the Arabs to visit whenever they wanted once they controlled the area post 67'.<br>

Further, that's a holy site to Islam, too, and traffic there for Palestinians was restricted at the time. It looked, quite convincingly, like a victorious butcher playing &quot;nyah nyah&quot; to the Islamic community. It's worth noting that he had NOT visited the site in years prior, at the specific request of his then-boss in the Israeli government, because they knew the reaction this would cause.<br>

There are holy sites to Islam in Jerusalem as well.
