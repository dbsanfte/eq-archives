We have a reasonable solution to nerf low lvls with high resists...and then we have a suggestion to nerf all resists (/rude).  Sort of like swatting a fly with a sledgehammer.  We then have the typical anti melee bs in response to ridiculing this rather useless idea.<br>
<br>
First off the first part of the post was directed at this comment by shortie<br>
<br>
&quot; I say keep the 66% nerf, Without it, other wizards will be able to one-shot you. Although, i propose making resist gear less useful. Howbout a 66% nerf on resist gear? 9 MR/CR/HR becomes a 6 MR/CR/FR =) Make melee's feel our pain.&quot;<br>
<br>
I should have made that clear.<br>
<br>
I did feel the need to respond to the idea that its ok if they nerf resists to the point where high lvl resists wont protect you from root/snare/blind because melees can always pumice if off or use a range weapon.  Which seemed to be a post in support of the earlier poster.  Which is ridiculous.  I don't care how well it works for your most likely rather twinked lvl 35 warrior.  As a lvl 55+ its bs pure at simple k?  A 60 has 0 trouble channeling through 3 hits and 0 trouble killing a rooted melee.<br>
<br>
It should be pretty clear that lvl limits on items something I've been in agreement with before and still am now will in no way effect the high end game.  This or a soft cap on resists would make uber twinking less effective for pvp.<br>
<br>
A little fyi for you snare/root/blind IS 100% resisted by serious pvpers allready.  Only bluebies and naked cowards are subject to rooting/snaring/blinding at high lvl.  This is how it is, how its gonna stay most likely, and how it should be.  <br>
<br>
Nerfing resists would in my opinion be disasterous.  A number of things to consider here. Lvls 1-50 melees without twinkage for one. <br>
<br>
Next The lvl of mr after the allready buffed up tash, bard mr debuffs,  mala, or malo hit ya.<br>
<br>
The problem is that lowering resists often doesn't have a measured decrease over time as far as pvp strength.  Its more like a threshhold effect.  At a certain lvl of mr a melee becomes a joke. Get it?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=maegnarloth>Maegnarloth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/02 10:25:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Don't &quot;nerf&quot; resists</span><hr size=1> I would agree with Aerimus (omg, did I just say that?) in that resists should not be nerfed.<br>
<br>
What I'm talking about isn't nerfing things.  My problem lies in the attainable gear that anyone can get to resist my, and every other wizards, only means of attack.<br>
<br>
I believe that resists, as they stand, are just fine.<br>
<br>
If someone has put in the time/plat to get their resists up through twinked gear, that great!  They deserve it!  I don't have a problem with twinking.<br>
<br>
But here's my point:<br>
<br>
Mr. Melee thinks &quot;I need to get some resist gear to cut down on those ganking caster fookers.  Hey, I have a jeweler friend.  Maybe we can cut a deal!&quot;  or &quot;Hey, I've got a high level character, I'll get some phat lewtz with good resist stats!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mr. Wizard thinks &quot;Man, I just drained my manabar on that warrior with a 2 level difference than me, and he's only at 50percent health.  I better get some gear to help get his resists down.  Hey, I can get a staff of temperate flux that will cut his FR and CR by 6! ...... I'm screwed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nothing needs to be &quot;nerfed&quot; here.  I just believe that to make PvP balanced, there needs to be gear available that can nullify or at least counteract all the resist gear available.  The flux staff is great, but if it could be changed so that debuff was 1 resist point for each of your lvl's, that would be a little more effective but not stupid imbalancing.  So at worst, a lvl 60 wizard could cut cold/fire resist by 60.  Mr. Rogue's 120 resists go down to 60.  MR stays up high, so he can still run around (or away), but drafts might actually land for something and the wizard might actually be able to do some damage without making the rogue helpless.<br>
<br>
Also, the Flux Staff doesn't stack with the malise line, so don't panic about your resists going into the negative.<br>
<br>
This may solve the problem of PvE unbalance with items that strip resists.<br>
<br>
I'm not asking for uber wizard helping changes, here.  Tell me if I'm asking too much.<br>

My uber twinked warrior?</span><hr size=1> Hmmm here is my (as you put it uber twinked warrior):<br>
<br>
Armor is a blend of BA and Lightcrawler armor. Got that by soloing it all but a few parts of BA armor- all attainable at level 30 or sooner with a good group.<br>
<br>
My weapons are Scimitar of Ethereal energy (yes I bought it with my cash earned from this warrior) and a BA Longsword for Duel weild. For 2 hander I have a Mithral Staff.<br>
<br>
For ranged weapons I have a Forlorn bow (laughable at best).<br>
<br>
Ooops, I forgot to mention my Dwarven Ringmail Tunic for resists (again laughable)<br>
<br>
I have only 2 things on my person that I bought and might be beyond my level. The Scimitar of Ethereal Energy, and 2 MR rings I paid a jeweler to make.<br>
<br>
My &quot;uber&quot; MR of 88 with ALL my &quot;PvP&quot; gear is the best resist I have. <br>
<br>
With this in mind I base my above recomendations on my personal experience. I have died to a caster twice in PvP. And yes I ran sometimes, I know when I am outclassed. Here is another tidbit on how your Bow skill works for you.<br>
<br>
In Neth Lair I was at half life, got jumped by 3 darkies (iksar). A shaman, SK, and unsure of last class. I ran the entire length of Neth lair with 2 of them trailing me and I was snared. By the time I made it near the Nexus zone I was below 2 bubs of life. I proceeded to fight at zoneline but after trying to joust (which I am not that good at), I gave up and started firing bow shots off. After several 40 point hits with my good arrows. One ran off. He wasnt that wounded but guess figured I was too much effort. His buddy stayed a bit and kept Doting me. When I zoned with less than 100 hp, we chatted. He found archery very frustrating, especially when I landed a few crippling blows with arrows. Yes they were smoking me, but guess what? I was level 35 at time, they were 39 and 40, and against one I held my ground by running around and firing bow way better than I could have used melee (sk had a fungi and hit for 90-100 damage, unsure of rest of gear.. too busy running). So maybe, just maybe archery IS usefull. Shaman said I interrupted him 50% of the time.. Not bad for a useless bow (I tried to melee him, but between his gear and level diff, couldn't hit him 25% time). I do not know if bow uses different attack table to figure hits, but i hit 80%-90% of the time, go figure...(yes my str is higher than my dex&lt; so that was not reason, and skills in weapons maxed vs skill in archery at 130ish at time)<br>
<br>
But I strayed from original question....<br>
<br>
should wiz damage remain nerfed? YES (problem is gear related with low level twinks, not to be fixed by adding more gear)<br>
<br>
Sould manaburn be nerfed? NO (yes it is a one shot kill to casters, but so is Ice Comet when you get it at level 49. Remember if manaburn doesnt kill you, wizard is screwed... No mana, not even enough for gate.. And being as that damage is somewhat random, it is not guaranteed to one shot kill ALL the time those who have not the hit points of a warrior.)<br>
<br>
Now for a slightly different topic of comparing damage, ever been hit with Splurt? Pretty much instant kill if you don't get rid of it... Yet I don't see a lot of complaints against it.. (I feel that the spell is fine... in fact my only real complaint is the twink gear on low level characters)<br>

The twink bit isn't really that relevant the point is that archery isn't sufficiently good at interupting to justify using it other than to chip away at the hp of a hp lvl caster as he runs around.  Rooted/snared melees at the high end are dead ones especially if your a rogue without a lot of hp to start with.  In other words...we need those resists.<br>
<br>
The idea of giving wizards a resist debuff in my opinion is ridiculous.  A little fyi here.  Resist debuffers do 1.5x normal when used in pvp.  A 60 fr cr debuff would be -90 to both.  This would essentially make resist gear for most melees utterly pointless vs wizards as we wouldn't be able to get enough to make a difference.<br>
<br>
Wizards allready  have a solution to high resists.  Lures.  They rightly pay a price for them in manna effeciency and cast time.<br>
<br>
Though that staff you mentioned does indeed need a change.  It needs to either have a cast time or a recast time to prevent a favorite strategy which is chain clicking it on someone to lag them out.  To balance that out make it unresistable so you don't NEED to chain cast to get it to stick.<br>
<br>
IC btw only does 730 or so dmg IF it hits for max. I wouldn't call IC much of a one shot kill even at the lvl that you get it between player hp and resists.<br>
<br>
Splurt isn't much of a one shot kill either as you can dispell it.<br>
<br>
Mannaburn on the other hand IS a true one shot kill. It's unresistable and few classes have enough hp to withstand it with cleric buffs let alone unbuffed.

Could you at least stop the blatant lies? Any class can survive manaburn with cleric buffs (rogues and wizards too).<br>

First off other classes buffs can't really be a balance factor in pvp balance can they?  Unless you think every rogue should only be balanced with a cleric in his back pocket.  Especially when those buffs can be golem wanded.<br>
<br>
Lets make a short list of who you can't kill with ok gear with the help of a golem wand?<br>
<br>
Very uber n tov equiped warriors.<br>
<br>
Get just a bit more gear and they'll go down nicely too.<br>
<br>
Oh joy! Balance at last?<br>
<br>
Even without golem wands most people even buffed will fall below the 4k mark on hp. Much less the 6k one.<br>
<br>
Unbuffed in a truely fair pvp situation... only the forementioned warriors will survive the MB.  I feel real sorry for you unuber folks being unable to DT 1/10 of 1% of the population.  I can see how that would be limiting.<br>

<br>
Yes, live in fear of all 12 wizards who can manaburn so far at any time they want. Cause all us wizards want is to kill &quot;helpless&quot; rogues all day long.. over and over.. yep.. I have nothing better to do.. Oh look I have to wait a few hours till I can cast it again. Have to wait a good 15 minutes of med time(with clarity) before I can venture forth again... As you have siad soooo maaaannnnnyyyy ttiimmeess before, &quot;Move!&quot;.. Rogue heed thy own advice and quit dispencing such vaunted wisdom that you fail to use yourself.. Oh, If you are grouped like the spirit of the game is designed for, I would like to see that solo wizard MB you so your buddies can tear his mana-less ass apart. Problem of MB solved. Groups, what a novel idea.... And don't even suggest that 6 wizards with manaburn can go on a party killing spree.. The odds are the same as Cazic Thule being killed by a solo character.<br>
<br>
Quit yer bitchin, heed your own advice before dispencing more, and if you don't like it, move to a blue server so you can have that warm, fuzzy, &quot;no player can kill me feeling&quot;<br>
<br>
Eternally searching for &quot;helpless&quot; rogues to MB all day long to loot the 6 cp everyone carries on a PvP server so I can afford that gear from the Sleepers Tomb (if it wasn't NO DROP).<br>
<br>
Get a grip dude, chill out, play the game, and have fun.... if you aren't having fun, then what's the point?<br>
