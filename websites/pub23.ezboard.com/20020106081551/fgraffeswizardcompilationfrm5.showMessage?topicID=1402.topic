<br>
I don't play my wiz that much mostly because his 60 and if I'm on neme I'm just a port biatch.  So I got on him just to say hi to some friends then think I should camp phin waiting for him to spawn while I read my book.  So after 30 or so mins I see a other person come up to me. Saying even though he wasn't here when I was. During the 30mins he wasn't here while i was quietly reading my book he had to help his guild out so that means he was camping the spawn. <br>
<br>
*This means I can camp Phara Dar but I can help the guild out doing ports then come back 30mins later and say HEY, I was here give me my spawn back*<br>
<br>
So, as I try to tell this man he is a tottal moron he finally<br>
gives up and tells me to talk to a other person. <br>
<br>
*ohhh this is a good part*<br>
<br>
Now this guy wasn't even there, but since he done the last 3 phins he thinks he is entilted to the 4th phin by this person (*don't want to say his name*) who came up and is taking my spawn. (the idiot I'm talking about from above)<br>
<br>
Ahh.. so this means I can get my other friend to camp phara dar for me.. hmm...<br>
<br>
Well 30mins after this discussion Phin spawns..<br>
<br>
I spam my guild asking them to help, I get quit a few tells and people start to head down.<br>
<br>
Well what do you know.. the goof ball that came 30mins after I was camping phin.. decides to take his guild down there and take this guy from me.<br>
<br>
And lookie there a other guild is comming this time with 2 real life friends.. <br>
<br>
*look they want to take phin from me too*<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
So let me give you a timeline here<br>
<br>
*Neme camps phin*<br>
*30mins later gimp boy tells him he had to help guild so he is entilted for phin*<br>
*Neme wins fight but gimp boy tells him to talk to someone else*<br>
*Bigger gimp says that he has had the past 3 phins so he is entilted to phin because he has this gimp boy who is taking phin from me*<br>
*PHIN SPAWNS*<br>
*Neme gets guild to help*<br>
*Other gimps get there slightly more powerful guild to come take phin from me*<br>
*a OTHER GUILD this time with RL friends come to take phin from me*<br>
<br>
<br>
((All this time I was the one who was there camping phin, I never left the spawn  I sat there waiting for phin to spawn and *hoping* he drops this staff))<br>
<br>
Ok, now we goten to this part.   I see all this shit happening and decide that phin isn't imporant enough to get a guild fight going.<br>
<br>
So I camp in anger.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, phin droped a mage staff *whoop de fucking do*  And for all thoes &quot;friends* that I thought I had that tried to take phin from me.. YOU ARE DUMBASSES. <br>
<br>
/tell verant - Why did you make a epic like this? A epic shouldn't have this much greed enloved, hey our epic isn't even that good to begin with so why make it like this?<br>
<br>
--- <br>
<br>
Has this happed to any of you guys? Where people are tottally hogging spawns and taking them for epics?  My case is a bit harsher.  <br>
<br>
Neme - 60 wiz <br>

*btw new spells  = big ass joke*<br>

<br>
Secondly I was at phin before you showed up and claimed him. Not only that but the other &quot;gimp&quot; as you called him had been checking in on phin before that because he did not know that i knew the spawn time. <br>
<br>
Also you were not at phin for 30 min, because i had left phin to teleport a cleric to a good friend of mine who needed a rez and could not get the cleric to him, so i had left the spawn to port him, then i brought a group to phin as he was due, the mage that showed up had went to set up coh to get it done.<br>
<br>
Now, I will apologize to yuo for the confusion, as I should have had someone go and sit in lair while i went, but i did not expect someone to pop in during the 5-10 minutes i was gone to port someone and try to claim my camp, as no one knew when phin was due except my guildmates, as the kill before hand was done by people exclusivly from my guild.<br>
<br>
And as to this statement: <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, phin droped a mage staff *whoop de fucking do* And for all thoes &quot;friends* that I thought I had that tried to take phin from me.. YOU ARE DUMBASSES. &quot;<br>
<br>
It was not a bad raid, as my long time partner for 54 phingals finally got his staff, i learned how to solo pull phingal for myself, saving time from looking for a tank who knows how to pull, as well as another friend of mine getting the kedge robe for his epic.<br>
<br>
As to the spirit of this post, i will state some of my past experiences with phingal:<br>
<br>
54 phingals, 54th phingal got epic.<br>
<br>
11 times my raids were over run by other high rank guilds, and on 5 of those times he had the staff.<br>
<br>
Over 30 some deaths, 11 of which were non xp rezzable due to game bugs etc etc.<br>
<br>
Had the phingal and vs staves, friend destryed them accidently in a bag, had to start over.<br>
<br>
4 phingal backstabs where wizards joined my raids than ninja'd the staff, after this i permitted no wizards on my raids i did not know.<br>
<br>
I truly agree with you that phingal (at least on our server) sucks. From the spawns i have noted (maybe not killed, but have gotten times and loot dropping from friends on raid) our staff appears to be around a 1 in 10 to a 1 in 15 drop rate, not to mention the phingals were no wiz is present and the staff may rot on the occasion it pops (have heard of this happening 3 times)<br>
<br>
And at one point in time we were friends, as someone else directed you to me when you were a lower lvl than i was ( yes, even me being 54 and you 60, i was once higher than you, I was unable to play eq for awhile do to cpu problems)for assistance on your staff of the wheel quest and i gladly assisted you, and before this gets twisted around into me thinking that gives me rights to phin, it doesn't, and I am not claiming it does. But i feel that I had rights to that camp as I had been camping it and had to leave to help a  friend before their xp res ability poofed.<br>
<br>
And as to future phingals, i just got my staff from him today on  his morning spawn, if you need future help with phingal i will be glad to assist you still if you ask..... I am not one to hold a grudge. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usorenhsolarflare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soren H Solarflare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/15/01 10:39:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Phin is more then a *rare* drop prob on Xegony (please r</span><hr size=1> According to PnP whoever first aggros the mob gets it.

Even if you wait 40 hours. If you can't kill it, you don't own it. I HAVE honored some people's ludicrous behavior before, and other times not, depending on my mood. But if you don't have the force to kill it, don't complain when someone else walks up and does. I have had people claim spawns, tell me I could have such and such a portion, and then ask me if I would help break for them. How stupid can you get? Hate to be insulting, but it just irritates me when people try to monopolize zones and spawns. While it is difficult to imagine a multi raid Fear invasion, I even sneer at the reservation system that currently exists on my server. People will reserve a day, CT will spawn, they cannot possibly kill him, refuse to let a group that can take it, then ask for help. It's like someone camping the stone spider, hearing that Naggy spawns, then claiming him with their one group and asking the rest of the zone for help. Get over it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwizxeg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WizXeg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/01 2:19:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Phin is more then a *rare* drop prob on Xegony (please r</span><hr size=1> Xegony is the ghetto server. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

And as to the PnP thing, it may apply to this situation... But I try to avoid PnP at all costs, this was basically a misunderstanding that ended up making someone very pissed. <br>
<br>
I hate PnP, and i think verant should go back to the old dungeon rules, but that is my opinion, there is just something not right about forcing someone who may have been at a camp for a long duration to share it with someone else because that person wants to:<br>

i got the staff after 10 or 11 phini with my guild. (sorry for speaking i am french in karana)<br>
<br>
we are 7 wiz in my guild, the second staff up for me.<br>
<br>
in the 3 last phini:<br>
i buy before an item rebreather and i camp the spot<br>
i tell my guild when pop.<br>
the firts phini killed: no staff (wednesday event)<br>
the second (same week, sunday): we try to pull it in room before lair. at 20% hp bug wall and gate in lair. all nukers was summoned and killed in lair. Waiting in guildsay, the tank finish phini and he drop the staff. but no wiz live for loot, add mob, not possible to rez in time, staff decay.<br>
the last phini (monday): we pull it in lair for prevent bug gating. I no cast for prevent aggro. i give my account at friend for prevent LD. phni dead quick, monk in my guild single pull all, and the staff drop.<br>
<br>
so yes staff is a rare drop. you can kill ten phini and no staff. but you can kill 3 after and get 2 staff. not rules, only lucky and perseverence.<br>

Sitting at zone does not constitute a camp.<br>
<br>
I've thought long and hard on this.<br>
<br>
Camping Phinney means taking a group and killing swirlspines.<br>
<br>
If you tried camping VSR or Ragefire from the zone in you would get laughed at.    <br>
<br>
Camping Phinigel means having a force there sufficient to kill him and having that force there first. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udolomite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dolomite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/01 5:55:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> GM's Statement Regarding Epic Camps--</span><hr size=1> GM's rules regarding epic camps such as Phini and Ragefare is as follows:<br>
<br>
&quot;He who mobilizes and kills the guy first has the right to the spawn.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is what came out of the mouth of a GM and is written in their guidelines.<br>
So.. if you are camping an epic spawn such as Ragefire of Phinny, and you<br>
can't mobilize fast enough to kill him.. and some other person manages to get<br>
their group in there before you and kill him.. then you have just lost out.<br>
<br>
Sure it sucks BIGTIME, as I had a friend lose Ragefire after camping him for days on<br>
end.. sleeping in front of the freakin' computer.. but thats how the rules work.<br>
<br>
Epics are just that.. Epic.  Its damn hard, and there is bound to be a bottleneck at<br>
some point along the line of the quest.  Verant will only allow epics to flow into the<br>
game at a certain rate, and that is why there are such sucky spawns as Phinny (rare<br>
staff drop) and Ragefire (lucky if you manage to ever see him).<br>
<br>
All I can say is.. if you are camping an epic parts, make sure your guild is there to<br>
support you at a moment's notice.  Have your 'epic team' organized before hand if<br>
necessary so that they are able to immediately get their asses out of whatever<br>
situation they are in and get over to help you.  Heck, bind them near the camp to help<br>
