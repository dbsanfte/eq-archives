or &quot;I need a port&quot; isn't near as helpful (or likely to get a favorable response) as &quot;I need a port from DL to WC, if any one has the time, thanks&quot;<br><br>5) If all the porters are busy, and cant do it, don’t be offended, just like clerics and necros we have stuff to do in EQ too that isn't porting/rezing/summoning...90% of the time or more we are happy to port you<br><br>6) In case of raids if it will be a few before we get to you, remember we are porting quite a few people in most situations, we haven’t forgotten about you, and you will get ported...the raid usually wont start till every one is there<br><br>7) In some cases there can be quite a few porters grabbing people and porting them, so we may ask who needs ports several times, its not a bad case of attention deficit disorder, we just don’t always know who is getting who<br><br> When you need a port, get to a port site, don’t expect the porter to run to KC/Thurg/OT/port up to nexus/EC ect to pick you up, and unless there is some dire emergency (or you are helping this person) don’t ask them to either<br><br>9) Clerics use peridots, necros use coffins, CoH mages use gems to, wizards use portal chips, now 1.2pp per person per port doesn’t sound like a lot, and it isn't, and I refuse to charge guildies for ports, to give you an idea on average I go through a stack of chips a day, and upwards of 4 on longer raids (esp. Fear/PoG where people come and go) I don’t mind shelling this money out at all, but it shure makes my day when some one hands me a port chip when they need a port, you carry 2 coffins some jewels for CoH, and some peridots, and sometimes batwings and fish scales, why not give the wizards that TL you out of raids a chip or two sometimes, like I said its not the money it just makes us feel good, they are sold on the 2nd floor of the temple of sol ro (main floor) by a gnome vendor, all TLs use chips excluding bind and large spires<br><br>10) We porters port as part of our job requirement, just like clerics rez ect, but we do other stuff too, like nuke on raids and druids buff and nuke and dot ect, we like to attend raids and have fun just like every one else, but to do this we must be on the said raid, remember if you need a port, do it before hand or show up early, don’t make us late, and don’t waste time when we porting.... if your late arriving from work or somthing its one thing, if you just din't want to leave your xp group sooner that’s another<br><br>11) In some situations (i.e. wiz port to SF, hate, sky, ect.) special directions may be given to avoid bad situations, or certain directions could be given to avoid mob pathing or to get to the location of the rest of the raid, please listen to these and don’t argue/suggest better ways, we have probably already ported in several times *that day* using these techniques and they work, if the porter asks that you not break invis go south till you hit the zone wall then run right (west) do it, don’t land and ask a lot of questions about it AFTER we land at the destination, break invis and train us all, you do this for fear breaks, shouldn't be that hard in these situations<br><br>12) If you are bugged, and know it, please take care of it before your porter gets there, if we find out you are bugged after the porter arrives, please hurry in your camping and relogging, don’t make your porter and the other passengers wait<br><br>13) If you go LD, we may go ahead and port other people, that doesn't mean you are out of luck just let us know you are back on and ready for port and we will be by shortly to pick you up, if you go LD at the end of the raid we are not going to leave you, even if we have to gate out because of a dangerous situations (i.e. upper lvls of CoM and hate) then come back when you get back on and summon a body and rez you, usually this is not the case and we will wait a few for you to get back on, if it appears that you will not be getting back on, if possible its appreciated to call some one on the raid and let them know that you cant get back on, this way a group of people don’t sit there for an hour waiting on you to show...sometimes this is not possible, and we understand that<br><br>13) When getting ports out of the raid, a few things are important to remember<br>        a) if the raid is winding down, wait for word to be given that we are leaving, this is important because there may still be mobs to clear, some one's body to get, or some one to protect while they have rez effects<br>        b) Once word to leave is given to leave, don’t dilly dally around, *your porters should not wait 10-15 min after every one else has left to port you out, unless there is a darn good reason (i.e. getting a body, waiting for a LD)* just because you want to look around or see what the other guild moving in is doing, or see if the group your trying to get into in the same zone is going to take you, is not an acceptable reason for a porter to stay there waiting, if this is the case it is your responsibility to find your own port out if you want to wait longer than every one else, we are tired to at the end of raids, or we want to get to doing other things, waiting on you is not what we usually want to do<br> <p>Illegal javascript event tags or url parameters detected.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ualtruxquestmaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Altrux Questmaster</A>&nbsp;
