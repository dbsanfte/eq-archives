<B>The story of Spork:</b>
<BR>
<BR>

One day I was flying by a base that was just hacked by VS on Searhus. 
I see about 5 or 6 enemy out on the wall including a max and a guy with a lancer who was oblivious to my presense.
Normally I would afterburn away incase the max was AA and come back at the right angle to  rocket them.<BR>
<BR>
But out of the corner of my eye, I catch the name of the guy with the lancer: Sporkfire!<BR>
<BR>
So instead, I put on the brakes and wheel around and launch a full salvo or rockets into Spork. 
I manage to kill him but am blown to pieces by all his friends.<BR>
<BR>
Over the course of the night I ran into and killed him a few times. The best one was when we were heading up the east coast of Searhus from the dropship center to Iva, I was following my squadmates in their prowler with my reaver. I was fooling around, flying low and that kind of thing you do when you are bored and not really paying attention.<br>
<BR>
Then the prowler driver tells me a reaver just flew past, at high altitude. I wheel around and see it flying south. He either didn't notice us or was intent on some other mission. I afterburned after him and of course with the great situational awareness you have in all vehicles, he didn't notice me.<br>
<br>
As soon as I caught up and started firing, he afterburned away. Mistake. He started heading for that very high mountain (not the volcano) on the east coast. He tried to fly around it to avoid me but I chewed him up good enough that he bailed.<br>
<br>
That's when I saw it was Spork again. This is the screenshot of him slip sliding his way down the mountain as I slowly pegged him with rockets.
<br>
Sorry man ;)<br>
<br>
What impressed me the most was we had pushed the VS off the continent and things were pretty quite but there was one tower left and one last VS on the entire continent: Sporkfire!
