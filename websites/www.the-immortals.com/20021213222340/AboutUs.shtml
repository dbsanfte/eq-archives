                      . I remember waiting endlessly for screens shots to download 
                      on my 14.4-baud modem and our jaws dropping on the ground 
                      to see such graphics. I remember thinking to myself, surely 
                      this must be a hoax. How could one have online graphics 
                      like this? Sure enough, it was an open beta product! The 
                      download took nearly 5 hours to complete. Once inside the 
                      cockpit I knew immediately that I had found my new home.</font></p>

                      1995, an a bold experiment was begun in taking multi-player<br>
                      on-line gaming action to a new level. In an unprecedented 
                      move, a 6 month<br>
                      beta period was established for what was then called Confirmed 
                      Kill. Today,<br>
                      after many changes this game? is known as Warbirds (tm).&quot;

                      good-bye to AW and it wasn't long after were the 901st Immortals 
                      born<br>
                      . The 901st Immortals had many <a href="#901Roster">MEMBERS</a><img src="images/901st.gif" width="150" height="150" align="right">(see

                      today in various MMPOGs. The 901st was one of the oldest 
                      squadrons in WarBirds, dating back to the beta in version 
                      .82 of WarBirds. Soon after, we became sister squadrons 
                      to the 900th Bloody Jaguars and enjoyed a larger sense of 
                      community. The 901st Immortals were some of the best &quot;sticks&quot; 
                      whoever flew a virtual cockpit. Its membership and officer 
                      corps were completely dedicated to the squadron and its 
                      goal of being one of the most highly-competitive and respected 
                      squadrons to ever fly the virtual skies.</font></p>

                      other. In its<br>
                      second year, the 901st Immortals and its sister squadron 
                      the 900th Bloody<br>
                      Jaguars brought squadron to squadron team competition to

                      bragging rights in this modern-day-jost of the heavens. 
                      The 901st Immortals had achieved an unsurpassed dueling 
                      record (of its time) of 27-3-1. One of the two most memorable 
                      accomplishments of the 901st Immortals was their second 
                      place win in ICI's first Official Squadron Duel, where they 
                      lost in a controversial match against the Flying Pigs. This 
                      defining moment had forever pitted each other as arch-rivals. 
                      Ironically enough, Squid, the Flying Pigs CO, happened to 
                      live in the same town as Sand, the CO of the 901st, that
