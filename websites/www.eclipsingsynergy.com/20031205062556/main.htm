  <font face="MS Sans Serif">Well tonight seemed to be &quot;Get Sumatri her Epic 
  night&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got Sumatri MUCH closer to completing her epic by 
  taking <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4588">Venril 
  Sathir</a>&nbsp; for a little ride.&nbsp; We then headed to the Swamp of No 
  Hope, in search of
  <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5318">Ulump Pujluk</a> 
  and ask him if he would be so kind as to hand over the &quot;Froglok Essence&quot; that 
  Sumatri needed.&nbsp; Well, he wasn't in an obliging mood so,... he died.&nbsp; 
  We then decided that since we had come this far we might as well head over to 
  Kedge Keep and see what mayhem we could create over there.&nbsp; After making 
  our way to the Seahorse cave, we decided we would pay a little visit to
  <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=1852">Phinigel 
  Autropos</a>.&nbsp; We killed him in short order as well, however he didn't 
  drop anything of notable worth.&nbsp; It was around this time that Yienka gave 
  out a resounding &quot;Doh!&quot; over guild chat, letting us know that she was no 
  longer in route to Kedge Keep and had instead received a free trip to her bind 
  point.&nbsp; After this the majority of the &quot;Raiding Party&quot; broke up.&nbsp; 
  Myself, Sumatri, Robotion (after kindly rezzing Yienka), and 2 members from 
  the original force went back to the Seahorse cave in hopes of getting the 
  second to last piece of Sumatri's epic.&nbsp; Unfortunately we were 
  unsuccessful as that wily little Tainted Seahorse never came out to play with 
  us.&nbsp; But after discovering a nice little path to get back there, we 
  predict we will be heading there often to sniff out the little fella!&nbsp; So 
  stay tuned for more death and carnage...same bat-channel, same bat-time!</font></b><p align="left">

  GLOVES OF FIRE</a><p align="left">After our total annihilation of Ixi, the 
  Raid Force headed off to Chardok in search of the Royal Family.&nbsp; After a 
  wipe  and a little help from some gracious members of 
  &lt;Crimson Seekers&gt;, we managed to take out the
  <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4982">King</a> and 
  then 10 minutes later we decided to invite his
  <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4979">Queen</a> to 
  the party.&nbsp; The both of them fell with relative ease, although myself and a few 
  other members fell with even greater ease to the Queens AoE 850hp per tick DoT.&nbsp; 
  OUCH!!</p>

  <p align="left">Tonight a few of us headed to City of Mist after a not so 
  successful attempt at a LDoN.&nbsp; Clevawich, who's dice are now being 
  checked by the Norrath Gambling Committee, walked away with a nice new shield:
  <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24620">DREAD SHIELD 
  OF MURDER</a>.&nbsp; And Sumatri managed to pry a pretty decent ring off the 
  fingers of one of our victims:
  <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23012">SLIMY GREEN 
  RING</a>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I failed to take any pictures of our 
  expedition.&nbsp; I will try to remember to do that more often, =)</font></strong></p>

<DIV align="left"> Today a few of us went on a raid to Plane of Fear, however 
  after about 2 hours the target never showed themselves and the raid took on a 
  new focus... to take out
  <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5218">Zordakalicus 
  Ragefire</a>.&nbsp; Talk about overkill...we had about 30 people there for 
  Rage and although the fight lasted longer then some of the posts on Allakhazam 
  say, we took him down very efficiently.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this time around 
  it was not for one of our own clerics, but I think we had a good time 
  nonetheless.&nbsp; Besides Robotion provided plenty of action for us with his 
  multiple deaths throughout the night.&nbsp; 2 deaths in PoF in a matter of 
  minutes and then another on the way Rage.&nbsp; It looks to me like Wasded has 
  some competition, =)</DIV>
