  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Eclipsing Synergy is a guild 
    on the Xev Server that was formed in late July 2003 with our founders 
  envisioning 
    grouping, developing, and growing together. We started our guild recruiting 
    members between the levels 25 and 35. We are a group of people that will 
    never be compared to any other, we are unique. </font></strong></p>

  </font></strong> 
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Common questions of what 
    type of guild we are: </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: Are we a raiding or a 
    social guild? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: Why can't a guild encompass 
    both raiding and social aspects within its members? Eclipsing Synergy is BOTH 
    a raiding and a social guild. We currently have scheduled raids that will 
    progress our members in both equipment and experience. We also enjoying grouping, 
    chatting, and doing things together and having fun. Both can go hand in hand.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: When are our members primarily 
    online? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: Our members are online 
    throughout the day and night. We do not reserve ourselves to one time zone 
    and usually have groups of members online at all times of day. We will be 
    having guild events different times of the day, and different days of the 
    week to accomodate all our members.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: Why can members of Eclipsing 
    Synergy ONLY belong to this guild? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: We want our members to 
    focus within without any conflicts of interest. Having multiple guilds or 
    priorities is not only very self serving but also cheats the rest of the members 
    in our family. </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: What are our goals in 
    the future and how are we going to achieve them? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: Our goals are very reaching.. 
    we want to be the best guild on the server. Maybe we will be steps behind 
    certain guilds in progression due to the seniority of status on the server 
    but we want to be the best! We are going to achieve our goals by treating 
    each other as people, not icons. Every member of our family is important and 
    will be treated as so. Are we going to advance through Kunark, Velious, Luclin, 
    and Planes of Power? YES!</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: What is the leadership 
    of the guild like? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: The leadership of the 
    guild is very carefully chosen. All officers and the Guild Leader believe 
    in the importance of synergy and work on eclipsing it 8). We believe to succeed 
    we need to work together and not pursue personal interests. We have our hearts 
    in our guild. Many of our leaders have vast experience in the game of Everquest, 
    some even starting new characters or new ones on this server. </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: What is your policy on 
    alternate characters? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: Every guild member is 
    allowed to have as many alternate characters as they wish in the guild. The 
    only current requirement is that they are of at least Level 40. </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: May my girlfriend/boyfriend/fiancé/spouse 
    join the guild if I join? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: Not only do we allow couples 
    and friends to join our ranks, but we encourage it! Couples and friends must 
    meet the recruitment requirements like any other member, however, no girlfriend/boyfriend/fiancé/spouse 
    will be turned down because we have enough players of a certain class. We 
    are family.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: Does the guild help the 
    members achieve epics and other accomplishments? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: MOST CERTAINLY! Our guild 
    strives on helping each other with quests and epics. Just remember, the more 
    effort that a member puts forth to help another, the more assistance that member will get 
    in return when they need it. Just don't ask the guild to complete your epic 
    for you on the first week of joining 8).</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: Where does Eclipsing Synergy 
    raid, and what mobs do we kill? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: We are currently working 
    on Tier 1 and Tier 2 mobs and equipping our members to handle more difficult 
    and skilled encounters. We will be fighting mobs in ALL expansions and will 
    progress rather quickly having a lot of fun doing it.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: Are we a role-playing guild? 
    </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: We are not a guild that 
    requires role-play, however if you wish to role-play in our family you are more 
    than welcome 8).</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: Does our guild promote 
    other Everquest paths such as Tradeskills? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: We welcome any of our 
    guildmates that would like to be tradespeople. The contribution of our members 
    is what is important, not what level and how many AA a member has.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: Will Eclipsing Synergy 
    ever merge with another guild and combine forces? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: Keeping things definite 
    is very difficult but we have no plans of merging our family into another 
    guild. Most guilds are much different than we are, however, it is very possible 
    in the future for another guild to merge with us given their members agree 
    to our policies and meet our recruitment requirements. We are willing to ally 
    with other guilds to accomplish tasks that neither guild is able to take on 
    their own. We may also work with other guilds during epic fights and such 
    to benefit the Xev Community.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Q: Who are your officers 
    and how can I get in contact with someone about joining? </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">A: Our guild leader is Byle. Our officers are 
  Clevawich, Beani, Fystz, Robotion, and Sumatri.<br>
    <br>
    You can contact any of our officers or guild leader in game by sending a tell 
    or send an email via the CONTACT US option on our main menu. </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">NOTE: We are a guild that 
    will never take on a bad reputation. We will always take the high road in 
    situations of conflict with others on the server. If you are a person that creates conflict you will not be welcome in our family.</font></strong></p>
