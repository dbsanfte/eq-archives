  <p align="left"><strong><font face="MS Sans Serif">Even though we only play 
    the game for fun and never expect to win a ton of loot, upgrades in items 
    help the guild do better things. There can not be any PUBLIC disagreements 
    with how loot is allocated as it isn't beneficial and takes away from the 
    person obtaining the item enjoying it to its capacity. </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>ANY LOOT OR ITEMS THAT WERE 
    ALLOCATED TO YOU BY AN OFFICER OR THE GUILD LEADER ARE PROPERTY OF ECLIPSING 
    SYNERGY AND WILL NOT BE SOLD!!!!</strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>If you are the beneficiary 
    of a droppable item that item may remain in your <br>
    possession until either you recieve an upgrade to that item or you choose 
    to <br>
    leave our guild. If the item is no drop, of course you may enjoy that item 
    for <br>
    your characters life 8). The reason behind this rule is we are a family, a 
    <br>
    guild and we are not here to advance our personal fortunes. When a member 
    <br>
    receives an upgrade that item that was awarded previously will be re-allocated 
    <br>
    to another guild member. </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>Loot Allocation Method </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>Loot will be allocated by 
    the officers of the guild and awarded to the member <br>
    that receives the most votes of the officers online. Online officers will 
    cast <br>
    their votes in a private channel based on the following criteria:</strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>1. Best suited class(es) 
    for the item. <br>
    2. Online Attendence <br>
    3. Member contribution to the guild <br>
    4. Level Requirement(s) if any <br>
    5. Recent allocations to any one member or class <br>
    6. Current equipment of member (can the upgrade create another allocation) 
    <br>
    7. Senority &amp; Experience (Level &amp; AA) </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>If there is a tie in the 
    officer channel on allocation of the item, the Guild <br>
    Leader or Senior Officer will break the tie. </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>Loot will NOT be given to 
    an alternative character unless no primary character <br>
    in attendence (or able to log in to loot) is in need of that item. Spells 
    will <br>
    not be given to a member in which the level is not met. If a droppable item 
    is <br>
    not needed by any primary character (present at the raid or otherwise), it 
    will <br>
    go in the guild bank to sell for guild funds. Any member may purchase the 
    item <br>
    from the guild bank for current market value of the item for an alternative 
    <br>
    character. If the item is an parchment or a rune that can be turned in for 
    a <br>
    random spell, an officer will loot that parchment or rune and turn in for 
    <br>
    classes that provide guild assistance first. </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>Having said all that, these 
    loot policies only apply to situations where more <br>
    than one group of guildees and the Guild Leader or an officer is present to 
    make <br>
    a decision. If the Guild Leader or an officer is not present, the group or 
    raid <br>
    force will make their own loot procedures but it is strongly suggested NBG 
    (Need <br>
    Before Greed). </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>The equipment and items that 
    a member attains themselves are property of that <br>
    member. No member will be required to turn in a FBBS they paid 1500pp for 
    when <br>
    they get allocated a Cloak of Flames, for example. HOWEVER, if the guild member 
    <br>
    wishes to donate the item to the guild for further allocation, this will be 
    <br>
    taken in consideration during the officer vote.</strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>KEYS, QUEST ITEMS </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>Keys (such as Sleeper Tomb 
    keys), and quest items (such as the Temple of Veeshan <br>
    quest items) will be allocated in the follow manner:</strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>1. Essential classes FIRST 
    <br>
    2. Online Attendence <br>
    3. Member contribution to the guild <br>
    4. Level Requirement(s) if any <br>
    5. Quantity of parts attained to complete the quest <br>
    6. Senority &amp; Experience (Level &amp; AA) </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>Quest items that can be multi-quested 
    will be looted by an officer that has the <br>
    requirements to multi-quest the item. Once the member allocated the right 
    to <br>
    that item is ready to complete the quest, the officer will multi-quest that 
    item <br>
    to them. Example, a Halls of Testing farming raid officers will loot all armor 
    <br>
    molds, patterns, etc and will multi-quest for the members afterwards. Members 
    <br>
    will ONLY be allowed rights to such an item if that member currently has the 
    <br>
    faction needed to follow thru with the quest. </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>ONLY the Guild Leader or 
    an officer is permitted to loot corpses on raids unless <br>
    authorized. Any member that attempts to loot, loots by accident, or ninja 
    <br>
    loots items will be punished up to and may include guild banishment (ninja 
    <br>
    looting or any infringement of SoE policies will also get reported to a GM 
    and <br>
    pursued vigorously). It has happened many times, a member likes to loot to 
    see <br>
    what is on the corpse, and instead of viewing the item.. it is now in their 
    <br>
    inventory. </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>There may be times that an 
    item is granted GUILD USAGE and will not be allocated <br>
    to a member. A good example of this would be our first one or two Blade of 
    <br>
    Carnages off Avatar of War. Those weapons would remain in the possesion of 
    the <br>
    Guild Leader or an officer and given to the current Main Tank for use in the 
    <br>
    encounter until we have enuff of them to ensure each Main Tank will have one 
    <br>
    equipped for use on raids. After the guild raid is completed, the weapon will 
    <br>
    be returned for use on the next raid. </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="MS Sans Serif"><strong>We are a team and all loot 
    decisions will be made to further pursue our guild <br>
    goals, not the individual aspirations of members. Yes, the more mobs we kill, 
    <br>
    the more loot that drops, and the more a member improves themselves they will 
    <br>
    cain prestige. Just keep the guild in mind when loot decisions are made and 
    <br>
    please NO WHINING! <br>
