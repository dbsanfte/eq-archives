    <br>
    - access to all expansions of Everquest including Lost Dungeons of Norrath<br>
    - patience, good communication skills, and a good sense of humor<br>
    - playtime of at least 4 days a week (30 hours or more)<br>
    - resist gear to maintain 100 or more in FR CR MR and PR DR MR unbuffed<br>
    - an enduring breath ITEM, not the spell<br>
    - a right clicking item that can be used indoors<br>
    - either good sense of navigation of zones or access to maps of them<br>
    - the ability to celebrate others successes and work on personal opportunities<br>
    - faction with Claws of Veeshan (Skyshrine) to the point of NON KOS<br>
    - the ability to listen to raid leaders commands, follow through with instructions 
    and be a good raiding citizen<br>
    - no fear of dying in game, accepting the fact that you WILL die, and 
  probably often.<br>
    - the preference of grouping together with guildees, if guild groups aren't 
    available, starting one or finding a group to join. If you go &quot;/roleplay&quot;, don't 
    say hello/goodbye in guild chat and just do your own thing most of your time 
    online.. you will not be with us long. Developing grouping skills is what 
    is needed for good guild awareness and further enhances raiding skills<br>
    - participation in the website guild forums expressing your opinions<br>
    - NO OTHER CHARACTERS IN ANY OTHER GUILDS</font></strong></p>
