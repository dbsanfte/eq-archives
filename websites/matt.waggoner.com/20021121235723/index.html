They get married, and have families and friends.<BR>
They have jobs, and pay their taxes.<BR>
They can fall in love, but they can also get angry.<BR>
They live, and they die.<BR>
They are not perfect, and they don't claim to be.<BR><BR>

They... are atheists.<BR>

And they're nothing to be afraid of.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="normal">
Like Christians, the vast majority of them are normal, law-abiding citizens.  They don't all believe the same things.  Their politics are vast and varied.  I know a married couple where the husband is a conservative Republican, and the wife a strict Democrat.  I know others whose political opinions are so mixed that they don't fit into any of the major political parties.<BR><BR>

Atheists <I>do</I> have morals.  Just like most people, they believe it's wrong to kill others.  They believe that you should treat people the way you'd want them to treat you.  They believe in peace, and love, and many of the good things in the world.  Just like Christians, they want to live their lives, and be happy and fulfilled with their jobs, families, friends, and communities.<BR><BR>

They don't want to take away your church.  They don't want you to lose your religion, or your rights, or your family, or your friends.  They want you to be able to raise your children how you see fit, just as they want to raise their own children as they see fit.<BR><BR>

Of course, like any group, there are a small number who are bad apples.  A few atheists are cruel, mean, angry people, who want to hurt others.  But in the same way that one bad Christian doesn't mean most Christians are bad people, one bad atheist doesn't mean most atheists are bad people.<BR><BR>

In fact, the only real difference between an atheist and a Christian is their spiritual beliefs.  Christians generally believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but the details of their beliefs can differ.  Baptists, Catholics, and Lutherans are all Christians, but their beliefs aren't all exactly the same.  In a similar way, atheists all generally believe the same thing, but their individual beliefs can differ.<BR><BR>

But atheists don't worship Satan.  They don't worship demons, or animals, or the sun, or nature.  Actually, they don't worship anything.  They don't believe in devils, magic, or ghosts, either.  But even if an atheist doesn't believe in Christ's divinity, they can still find wisdom in his words.<BR><BR>

I know there are some people out there who don't really know or understand what an atheist is, and I hope by writing this I can bring closer together those who read it.  No one should live their lives in fear or ignorance of their neighbors; we will all be helped by learning about and understanding one another.<BR><BR>

If you have any questions or comments, I would love to hear them.  Please email me at <A style="text-decoration: underline" href="mailto:matt@waggoner.com?subject=Atheism page">matt@waggoner.com</A>, and I will do what I can to answer your words.  Thank you, and may peace and tranquility be with you.<BR><BR>
