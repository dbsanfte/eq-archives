Notes/Administrivia: If you have ANY QUESTIONS about the guide; any questions about details not included in the guide; any suggestions for the guide; or any information to be included in the guide; please e-mail <A HREF="mailto:matt@waggoner.com">matt@waggoner.com</A> with your questions or information.  I will do my best to include and update this guide.<BR>
<BR>

If you do send screenshots, please send YOUR OWN.  I could go download screenshots from Illia's Everquest Beastiary all day long, but that would be rude. :)<BR>
<BR>

<FONT COLOR="red"><B>THINGS THE GUIDE NEEDS:</B></FONT> If you have nice, clean screenshots of the mobs involved in the quest, they would be most appreciated.  I prefer that screenshots be fullscreen, with no HUD (i.e. hit F10 until all your little floating windows go away), with the mob centered and well-lit, and ideally with their name displayed (if you target the mob before taking the picture, the flashing white/blue name often will stand out better against certain backgrounds).  Daytime shots are preferable when possible.  Please send me the ORIGINAL .BMP FILE THAT EVERQUEST CREATES -- PKZIP it up if you can.  I'll do the editing and cropping myself :) Send them to <A HREF="mailto:matt@waggoner.com">matt@waggoner.com</A>.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>INTRODUCTION</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>

The Magician epic quest reward is a level 46 spell, Summon Orb.  Once you receive the reward, you scribe the spell, which you then may use to SUMMON your epic weapon, the Orb of Mastery.  The nice side effect of this is that when you die, you may SUMMON ANOTHER EPIC WEAPON BEFORE YOU RETRIEVE YOUR CORPSE!  Plus, it doesn't require any reagents like malachite to summon, so you essentially get a free pet for 500 mana (not to mention a kickass primary slot weapon).<BR>

To get the Orb of Mastery (or really, the Summon Orb spell), you turn in the four Elements to the Master of Elements in the Plane of Sky.  Each of the four Elements (Wind, Water, Earth, Fire) is itself a sub-quest, where you must turn in three or four items to an NPC, who will reward you with the corresponding element.  (Earth and Fire each require four items; Air and Water each require three items.)  All but three of the 14 items are simple drops from mobs; some high-level and rare, some lower-level and common.  Two of the 14 items are your lower-level focus items from the Temple of Solusek Ro.  The last item, the Power of the Orb, is an item for the Element of Fire sub-quest.  The Power of the Orb itself requires 3 sub-items to be traded in; each of those 3 sub-items needs either 3 or 4 items.  A tree diagram looks like this:<BR>
<BR>

The symbol preceding each item indicates whether or not:<BR>
* = you can do it solo<BR>
&amp; = it will require multiple people to get (i.e. not even a level 60 mage could safely do it solo)<BR>

Do not confuse the Power of Water, Power of Earth, etc. with the Element of Water, Element of Earth, etc.  The "Power of" items are for the "Power of the Elements" sub-sub-quest of the Power of the Orb sub-quest, and the "Element of" items are the four items you turn in to the Master of Elements to GET YOUR EPIC QUEST REWARD.<BR>
<BR>

<B>A WARNING: DO NOT COMPLETE THE ELEMENT OF WIND QUEST UNTIL LAST OR YOU WILL POP THE MASTER OF THE ELEMENTS AND HE WILL DEPOP BEFORE YOU GET THE OTHER ELEMENTS DONE.</B>  This means that you should have completed and acquired the Element of Fire, Element of Earth, and Element of Water, BEFORE you go to the Plane of Sky and turn in your items for the Element of Wind.<BR>
<BR>

A note: Some of the other epic quests (Cleric and Monk, for example) require you to do things in a certain order.  You must get item A, give it to mob B, which will cause mob C to spawn, who you kill for item D, and so on.  The magician epic has items that can all be acquired in ANY ORDER.  The only time that "order" matters is, as noted above, when you turn in the Element of Wind items, because this causes the Master of Elements to spawn.  (There are one or two instances with the Power of the Orb sub-sub-quest where you are "supposed" to talk to someone who gives you an item to give to someone else, but, these SHOULD BE optional.  Do them anyway!  It's epic, man!)<BR>
<BR>

Also, in the cases of items from the Plane of Hate and Plane of Sky, you need to be level 46 to even be teleported into those zones.  For your own safety, we recommend that you are at least level 47, and preferably 49, before you enter the planes.<BR>
<BR>

Some terminology:<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ffff80">always drop</FONT></B> - This refers to items that will always drop when you kill the mob.  There are possibly some cases where the drop rate might be high but not 100%, but when I mark something as "always drop", it means that every time I've killed the mob, it's dropped the item.  More to the point, there are no recorded instances of the mob NOT dropping the item.  This doesn't mean that it won't happen, just that no one's yet seen it happen.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ffff80">common drop</FONT></B> - At least 20% of the time.  While one in five may not seem all that common (some "common drops" are 100% of the time!), since most of the mobs here are rapid spawns, you'll end up with the item in short order assuming you camp the mob for a little while.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ffff80">semi-rare drop</FONT></B> - 10-20% of the time.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ffff80">rare drop</FONT></B> - 5-10% of the time.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ffff80">very rare drop</FONT></B> - less than 5% of the time.<BR>
<BR>

Keep in mind that these are GUIDELINES; since we don't have enough data to be positive about them, the terms are assigned to tbe best of our ability.<BR>

Okay.  Here's the quest itself!<BR><BR>

Turn in the following four items:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#elementoffire">Element of Fire</A>
<LI><A HREF="#elementofearth">Element of Earth</A>
<LI><A HREF="#elementofwater">Element of Water</A>
<LI><A HREF="#elementofwind">Element of Wind</A>
</UL>

to the Master of Elements, a named air elemental in the Plane of Sky.  Each of the four Elements is a quest all its own, and they are detailed below.<BR>
<BR>

The Master of Elements spawns when you give Kihun Solstin, who is also in the Plane of Sky, the three items he needs in order to give you the Element of Wind, so be sure to turn in the items to Kihun Solstin LAST, when you are ready to complete the quest.<BR>
<BR>

The Master of Elements will then give you the Summon Orb spell, which, when cast, summons the Orb of Mastery:<BR>

<A NAME="embers"></A><FONT SIZE="+0" COLOR="#ffff80"><B>* Burning Embers (Burning Wood: "Nezekezena", "Gylton", "Phenoz", rare)</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/vd_burning_embers.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Picture courtesy of <A HREF="mailto:gte039f@prism.gatech.edu">Varia Darselai</A> of The Tribunal</FONT><BR><BR>

The Burning Embers are a confirmed drop off Nezekezena, Gylton, and now (thanks to Orko Soulblighter) Phenoz, another named wurm in Burning Wood.<BR>
<BR>

Reports indicate that if you go to Nezekezena's spawn location (about (-450, -2550) in Burning Wood) and kill everything in sight, eventually Nez or his (her?) placeholders will start spawning with a cycle time of 90 seconds.  People have evidenced acquiring Burning Embers at a rate of 1 or 2 in a few hours' time with this method.  Phurzikan and Nezekezna both spawn on this spot, and they are both strong; sometimes Nez or Phurz will spawn two times in a row, so your group had better be strong enough to take them.<BR>
<BR>

Nezekezena, if not killed when she spawns, will wander sometimes along the east and south walls of the zone, so if you can't find her near her spawn, look there.  A tracker would definitely help.<BR>
<BR>

Thanks to Kelston Bernstar for contributing info about Nezekezena and Phurzikan (Phurz does not drop the Burning Embers so he is not listed here).<BR>

Apparently Gylton, another named wurm in the Burning Wood, can also drop the Burning Embers.  Barbel Tchitchaah of Karana says (edited for clarity :) ):<BR>
<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff">About Gylton's spawn: I'm not sure of the exact loc.  This named wurm wanders near the Skyfire zone.  Once you kill him, either he spawns again or Entalon spawns (5 minutes after), and when you kill Entalon, either Entalon or Gylon spawns again.  I've never had many difficulties finding him, just kill a few mobs near Skyfire (just after the ruins, before the way to zone), and eventually you'll see him.  Of course, a tracker would be a great help.  Gylton hit for around 145-155 max, isn't always the same level.  I saw him be level 45, but lower sometimes too.  He's a warrior type wurm (huge hit range, very low aggro range, Ring of Scale faction), and I don't feel he's harder than a standard wurm of the same level.  About soloing him at level 49, I would say yes, you basically would use the same level spells I use when I see him: Earth pet to tank and root, Shock of Swords of course (never never never use fire based DDs, they will resist fire too much to be effective), but also the level 49 conjuration-based Rain of Swords, Gylton and wurms in general have low resists against it, so it's actually mana effective and a good way to kill him fast with SoS between waves (editor's note: Verant is considering fixing the rain spells so that one of the waves is not eaten up by your pet, so this may become an even more efficient spell!).  Just make sure you are at full mana and use a SoW potion before fighting and nuke all you can, you'll be fine :) If you got a druid to track, you can switch to snare kiting also, but beware of adds in this zone.  Make Gylton follow you near the Skyfire zone, because fighting in the forest can be very dangerous.</FONT><BR>
<BR>

Note that Gylton has been spotted as far east as (+3440, -2468).<BR>
<BR>

Jeremy Champlin, who plays on Bristlebane, however, has said that no mage he knows of has gotten the Burning Embers off Gylton; you're probably better off focusing on Nezekezena.<BR>

<BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/rykas.jpg"><BR><BR>

Rykas can be found in Lake Rathetear, on the rocks at approximately (+950, -650).  He is a gnome wearing a bright yellow robe.  As far as I know, he never moves from his spawn area, and he's pretty much always there.  I showed up to find him in the middle of the game day (around 2pm game time) and he was sitting there with his earth pet.<BR><BR>

An elementalist's power comes from the Orb of Mastery.  The Elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water are contained within the orb.  The Master of Elements holds the Orb.<BR><BR>

He can be found within the Plane of Air.  No mortal has been able to contain the true power of the Orb.<BR><BR>

Trilith Magi'kot presented himself to the Master of Elements and the Orb of Mastery.  The power of elements brought agony to his mind and body.  Magi'kot was not of Balance.<BR><BR>

Fire burned his eyes unto blindness, Wind put his mind into a spin, Earth entered his body and aged him like the mountains, and finally, Water washed his memories of mortal life away.<BR><BR>

Failing his test, the Orb exacted its terrible price, and now Magi'kot is part of the Orb.<BR><BR>

Jahsohn Aksot is a human mage who is found wandering in the West Commonlands.  He is near the Kithicor zone border, either wandering along the road that leads south from the Kithicor border, or a little ways east, wandering through the trees.  If he has summoned a pet (he does not always do this) you can use Sense Summoned to find him.  Otherwise, bring a tracker, or just wander around until you see him.

Reports indicate that any of the dread wolves ("dread wolf", "dreaded wolf", "enraged dread wolf") in Kithicor at night, will drop this item.  Be careful; even a level 46 mage with his strongest pet can be overrun in seconds by himself.  You can probably do this part solo at 49 without too much difficulty, but for safety's sake, TAKE A GROUP WITH YOU ANYWAY.  I got my page 1 off an "enraged dreaded wolf", which was easy to kill once I was able to engage it near the West Commonlands zone border, without fear of random zombie troopers showing up to ruin my day.  Or rather, night.  I had the help of two warriors, a cleric, and a wizard, and we dispatched the enraged dread wolf easily.  Then a zombie trooper showed up, and my pet soloed it while the others took on a dread wolf that came out of nowhere!  Both the enraged dread wolf and the dread wolf dropped the Torn Page of Magi'kot 1.<BR>

At level 39 I was on a guild raid into Unrest.  Nearly every mob in the zone conned blue to me, with the exception of some Festering Hags, and these puppies.  Get a group of high 30s/low 40s together, and you can clear out the entire Unrest basement single-handedly.  Of the handful of Tentacle Terrors we killed, at least 2 and maybe 3 of them dropped the page.  These nasties are usually found in the last room in the basement, where Garanel Rucksif (the ghost dwarf) spawns.  They aren't all that hard to kill, but you'll want a group, because TTs are casters, either shadow knight or necromancer class (though they didn't have any pets, and they didn't harm touch that I could tell).  They cast lifetap- and disease-based spells.<BR>
<BR>

Also please note that there are tentacle terrors in Najena, but the Najena TTs are much lower level AND THEY DO NOT DROP the Torn Page of Magi'kot 2.<BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/torn_magikot_3.jpg"><BR><BR>

I spent about half of level 42 in the Frenzy camp in Lower Guk.  This was a good level to be there; most mobs conned low blue to even (a handful of yellows); the groups' members ranged anywhere from 38 to 52.  I was there for exp and loot, since I wasn't really aware of the fact that the page dropped from bloodthirsty ghouls (and, as it turns out, the Frenzied Ghoul itself can also drop the page).  If you are in this camp for even a couple of hours, you will with certainty see bloodthirsty ghouls, and probably at least one frenzied ghoul, and about one out of four of the BTs dropped page 3.  (I saw about four pages while I was there, not including the one that a party member looted accidentally 'cause he didn't know what it was.)  BTG's are strong warriors, but a normal Frenzy group can take them easily.  If you're building a party to go down there (and for some reason it's not already camped), BRING AN ENCHANTER.  The best room to camp in is the rectanguler anteroom just outside of the frenzied ghoul's room, since only a couple of weaker frogloks actually spawn in that room; you can actively pull from the surrounding rooms into it safely.<BR>

Walnan tends to wander along the path from the Butcherblock docks, to near Kaladim.  When I found her, she was standing behind a tree just upslope of the road near the last dwarf guard hut before you reach Kaladim.  However she can be in the area north of the road near the docks.  Your best bet is to cast Sense Summoned in this area, which will hopefully lead you to Walnan's pet.  Or, find a druid or ranger to track her for you.  Walnan is a female High Elf wearing a purple robe.<BR><BR>

<BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/power_of_earth.jpg"><BR><BR>

If you've killed faerie guards for your Robe of the Elements quest, well, you know how they go.  I got lucky; some guildmates and I were in Lesser Faydark helping a druid guildmate camp Brownie Scouts for an epic quest item.  During a break in the spawns, I SoW-ran with my air pet over to the faerie village, and pulled the faerie guard who spawns east of the village (behind a tree).  One Shock of Swords, and two seconds being beat on by my pet, and the faerie dropped dead.  I guess I was lucky because she dropped both the Power of Earth (a black ball, looks like a black pearl or a Glowing Black Stone) and the Twice-Woven Cloak (for the RotE quest), so I was able to go complete the RotE yet again.<BR>
<BR>

Faerie guards are easy if they're green to you, since they will only come one at a time when you pull them.  They are typical warrior mobs, nothing out of the ordinary for their level (max 24).  Don't confuse them with Fairy Guards, who are not the same mob (I don't know whether they drop the same loot).<BR>
<BR>

Faeries have the Faerie faction, though as far as I know only faeries are sensitive to this faction, so once you kill a few faerie guards, you will be KOS to the faeries and will not be able to travel safely through their village.  However there don't appear to be any other places in Norrath where this faction comes into play.<BR>
<BR>

Two separate sources have stated that they camped the Faerie village, killing more or less everything in sight, upwards of 8 hours before getting their Power of Earth.  Damn, I'm lucky.<BR>

<BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/power_of_fire.jpg"><BR><BR>

Boring but easy camp if you have your 39 pets or better, and even at 34 you SHOULD be able to do this solo although it will be more work.  I personally had to camp for about 3.5 hours to get the Power of Fire; lucky for me, it was 4 am and I was going to give up for the night after one last spawn, and lucky me, it had the Power of Fire.<BR>
<BR>

The Blazing Elementals spawn in the north part of Sol A, in a pit that has two false ceilings (rather, false floors in two other rooms) and a ramp that leads into another room where nothing spawns.  (If you have the EQ Atlas map of Sol A (http://www.eqatlas.com/solusekseyemap.html), the Blazing Elementals pit is marked at spot 3, and the unoccupied room is the small, perfectly square room just southwest of the "3".<BR>
<BR>

At first I camped in that room, waiting for the Blazing Elementals to spawn (they are on roughly a 19-minute spawn timer) and meanwhile pulling some of the surrounding goblins just to pass the time.  I even tried clearing out the entire circular area surrounding these rooms (everything north of -200 on the map), but that was too much effort.  I finally figured out that the simplest way to do it, was to sit in the Blazing Elemental pit ITSELF, and wait for the BEs to spawn.  They would immediately aggro on me, and my fire pet (sitting there waiting with me) would beat them to dust in a few seconds.  One of the reasons I did this was because I could simply sit there meditating, and I'd read a book, so I wasn't bored.  (Even killing green goblins over and over got tedious.)  The mobs would spawn, I'd move away a few steps, and my Jobaner would kill them.  The other reason was, given enough time, Blazing Elementals will cast a fire shield on themselves JUST LIKE YOUR FIRE PET, and their shield is JUST AS STRONG.  My level 38 fire pet (from my 44 spell) nearly died the first time it fought a Blazing Elemental, because of the fire shield it had (my pet hit so much it was beating ITSELF to death).  So I had to quickly sit, memorize Nullify Magic, and dispel the BE's fire shield.  Sure I probably could have just nuked it, but...<BR>
<BR>

If you sit in the BE pit itself, the BEs will aggro on you before they can shield themselves, and your pet will have absolutely no trouble disposing of them.  The BEs are level 25.  The only other threat is the Reckless Efreeti, who is level 28 and spawns near the back of the pit.  He is more or less a level 28 generic warrior mob, easily disposed of by my pet.  I only saw him once, near the end of my camp, and he had no fire shield, nor did he cast any spells.  My pet wiped him out in no time, solo.  He dropped the Platinum Armband.<BR>
<BR>

The upshot of all this is, the BE camp is boring as hell, yes, but the best solution is, sit in the BE pit with your fire pet guarding you, and get a good book and dig in.  I've heard stories of anywhere from a 20 minute camp to a 20 HOUR camp before getting the Power of Fire (which has the graphic of a red gem, just like a Ruby), but it's probably on average about a 4-5 hour camp.  Just stick with it and you'll get it.<BR>
<BR>

It is commonly considered as true that the lava elemental in the rear of Sol A (behind the gnome castle) drops the Power of Fire as its common loot, but I have not personally confirmed this.  If you are camping the blazing elementals, and want to deal with running over to see if the lava elemental has popped, feel free to do so.  Also, Dark Elf magicians or people who have bad faction with the gnomes in Sol A will have a difficult time doing this, which is probably why the Power of Fire drops off the BEs.<BR>
<BR>

Sumoner Deltorros of Bristlebane says that the Power of Fire is at best an uncommon drop off the lava elemental; at least, the PoF does NOT drop every time you kill the lava elemental.<BR>

<BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/power_of_water.jpg"><BR><BR>

Any of the various raveners in this zone can drop the Power of Water.  I, oddly enough, got lucky.  I went to Kaesora by myself; there were one or two other people in the zone.  I levitated down the eastern drop from the entry room, summoned a pet, went linkdead, came back, summoned another pet, and was almost immediately attacked by a famished ravener.  My earth pet rooted it and I nuked it half to death; my pet finished it off.  The ravener dropped the Power of Water.  Then I gated out.<BR>
<BR>

You will probably not get that lucky, so take a group with you; find somewhere that raveners spawn, and camp it, killing everything that moves, until you get your Power of Water.  I didn't go any further into Kaesora so I don't have much to say about how to deal with the dungeon, other than that a well-balanced group should be able to handle themselves quite nicely.<BR>
<BR>

Note that I personally only killed one ravener, and it dropped the Power of Water.  I have heard reports that the raveners drop the Power of Water commonly, but I haven't killed enough to confirm that.<BR>

Gypsy Dancers themselves are only level 25-26, but the room they primarily spawn in (the ballroom in Mistmoore) also contains lots of higher level mobs, usually in the low 30s.  If you have a group of 30+ people and can safely handle one mob at a time (either because you have a monk to pull or an enchanter to mez), then breaking in and camping the ballroom should be not too difficult.<BR>

<A NAME="wordsofmastery"></A><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#ff0000"><B>Words of Mastery<BR>(Najena: Akksstaff, quest)</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/akksstaff.jpg"><BR><BR>

Akksstaff wanders in random places in Najena.  When I found him, he was literally standing at the zone border to the Lavastorm Mountains.  Reports have him in almost any spot in Najena; inside various rooms, in the dungeon cell with Linara Parlone, in the goblin caverns, etc.  He is a male Dark Elf wearing a hideous brownish-green robe.<BR>
<BR>

Kelston Bernstar reports that Akksstaff's spawn point is in the hallway that leads to Rathyl's and Linara's cells, and he will eventually wander.  If Akksstaff is killed, his spawn time is THREE DAYS (ouch).<BR>
<BR>

For my part, I was in Lavastorm on my way to Nagafen's Lair, and I shouted, "Anyone heading to Najena, if you see Akksstaff, it's worth 20 platinum pieces."  A few minutes later, someone sent me a tell that Akksstaff was standing at the zone, so I rushed over there, talked with Akksstaff (below) and gave the lucky player his 20pp.<BR>
<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#aaaaaa">You say, 'hail Akksstaff'</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff">Akksstaff says 'What do you want?! Foolish High Elf, I am in no mood to treat with beggars.  I have half a mind to turn Jobober here loose on you!  Well, don't keep me waiting, state your business or be off with you!</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#aaaaaa">You say, 'magi'</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff">Akksstaff says 'Ah, that I can help you with.  Magi'kot was a powerful elementalist, able to control the power of the elements which surrounded him.  He was not able to fully master the elements when I was learning from him, but soon after my departure I heard rumours that he was going after the Orb of Mastery.  At the time, I did not feel he was ready to harness all the elements, but Magi'kot listened to no one.  He was in search of power beyond any held by a mortal.  Do you wish to hear more?</FONT><BR><BR>

When you're in your 20s, Najena is a good place to go for loot and exp.  It's a "doable" dungeon, meaning a single group of mid-to-high 20s (or even low 30s) can crawl through the dungeon, clearing it out room by room.  A single crawl, even if you kill every mob in the dungeon, is not likely to net you all four pages; I spent a good 5-6 hours there both at levels 40 and 46, killing literally every mob in the dungeon, before I gathered all four words.  Keep at it, and you'll get it.  Note that the words can drop off both the goblin magicians found in the northern caverns, as well as the Dark Elf magicians, and even a few of the named mobs in the zone.  I personally looted the Wind words off of Rathyl.<BR>
<BR>

If you're higher level like I am (45+), it's relatively trivial to solo literally the entire zone.  Just run about killing everything you see, and eventually you'll get all the words.  It's not really worth it to bother with Najena's room, because you have to resummon a pet to get in there (pets will not be able to leave the pool that leads to Najena's room).  At any rate, the spawn time in this zone is around 18 minutes, and it will take about that long to hit all of the other spawns you need to hit.  These are:<BR>
<BR>

1. BoneCracker and the necromancers in his room.<BR>
2. Trazdon and the magician[s] in his room.  (I don't know whether Trazdon is capable of dropping the words, because I only killed him once and he didn't drop them that time, so it's hard to tell.)<BR>
3. The magician at the front gate of the castle area (where the entry caverns end).<BR>
4. The magician in the room behind her.<BR>
5. The two magicians in the Crystal Room.<BR>
6. The two necromancers and Drelzna (or her PH, another Necro) in Drelzna's room.<BR>
7. The three magicians in the antechamber outside Rathyl's room.<BR>
8. Rathyl or his placeholder (a magician) in Rathyl's room.<BR>
9. The three goblin camps in the north caves.  One is in a cul-de-sac to the west; the other two are in rooms to the east and north.<BR>
<BR>

If you hit these spots in this order, you will sooner or later get all the words.  Be wary of other people camping the dungeon for exp and loot; don't run over their camps.  But do shout to the zone that you're looking for the Words, and if people could please not loot them and tell you, that would be nice.  A friendly group of low-20's adventurers were camping Trazdon's room when one of the magicians there dropped the Water words (the last one I needed); I gave one of them all the platinum I had earned in the 2 hours I spent trying to get the Water words, and she was incredibly grateful and excited (at my level, 46, the 12pp was nothing; if I'd had 50pp I would have given all that to her).<BR>
<BR>

You will need some keys to get around the dungeon.  The best order for this, is thus: Go to BoneCracker's room and kill him.  He will drop the "Dull Bone Key" (DBK).  Then go to the nearby Ogre Captain, and kill him, for he drops the "Shiny Metal Key" (SMK).  The SMK opens the cell outside Rathyl's room; the DBK opens Rathyl's room itself.  Kill Rathyl or his placeholders until Rathyl drops the "Bloodstained Key" (BSK) (this key is NORENT so if you go linkdead or camp, you will need to get it again).  The BSK opens the door to Drelzna's room.  Drelzna drops the "Golden Crescent Key" (GCK), but this only leads to Najena's room, and you don't really need to go there, so just stick the GCK in a bag and forget about it unless you really feel like killing Najena.  The GCK is also NORENT.  (The DBK and SMK are NOT NORENT, you can hang onto them forever, and probably should if you have to camp this place more than once.)<BR>
<BR>

Because there are so many mobs that can drop these words, we will not list them all here.  Suffice to say that few, if any, of them have more than 600 hit points or hit for more than 50 damage max.  The magicians and necromancers will all have pets and will cast their appropriate class spells, but otherwise are trivial to kill at high level.  They can be difficult at lower levels, however (fighting 3 necros solo at 39 can get you killed if you aren't careful).<BR>
<BR>

The named mobs are, as expected, somewhat more difficult, but not much.<BR>
<BR>

A quick summary of which pages dropped of what mobs in Najena, although I don't know whether there's any correlation:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Water dropped off a magician in Trazdon's room.
<LI>Wind dropped off Rathyl.
<LI>Earth dropped off a magician in the main castle area, although I also saw several pages of Earth drop off the goblin magicians in the north caves.
<LI>Fire dropped off a goblin magician in the north caves.  I believe I also saw fire drop off one of the magicians, but I saw it drop off the goblins at least 3 times.
</UL>

Lynn Lively tells me that, apparently, the words can all be found on the alligators in the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule (a dungeon on the south wall of the Feerrott).  The alligators have historically had the same loot table as the dark elf magicians in Najena, so this is understandable.  Whether there are any other mobs in Cazic Thule that have the words is unknown, but unlikely (your best bet for the words is still Najena).
<BR>

Kelston Bernstar tells me that he has never heard of the pages dropping off Trazdon or "a necromancer" (this seems like it would include Najena herself, as she is a necro), but I still keep them in the list on the off chance that they have the pages in their loot table as a rare drop.<BR>
<BR>

Sumoner Deltorros of Bristlebane says that he looted the Torn Page of Mastery: Wind off of a darkbone skeleton.  I haven't confirmed this myself (if someone else has, please email me) but it's something to keep in mind.  Darkbone skeletons, in my experience, only spawn in the front area of Najena, before you enter the keep proper.<BR>

<LI>a shovel from magicians in Najena or Alligators in Cazic-Thule;
<LI>the toes of a hill giant from hill giants, or (more easily) vendors near hill giant areas;
<LI>a gargoyle eye (from gargoyles or, again, vendors near places where people hunt gargoyles, like Mistmoore and the Ocean of Tears); and

</OL>

None of these items are NODROP.<BR>
<BR>

Turn them in to Vira in the Temple of Solusek Ro to get the Shovel of Ponz.  Vira is upstairs, on the left side of the balcony surrounding the main hall (as you face the dais).<BR>
<BR>

You need good faction with the Temple of Solusek Ro to do this quest.  The simplest way to do this is to kill Shadowed Men.  Another way is to turn in Dervish Cutthroat rings to Ortallius in the Southern Desert of Ro.  A third way is to find Ssynthi, the renegade Shadowed Man (he is aligned with the Temple) in Mistmoore, and give him the flower found on the tomb inside the building he hides behind.  The fastest way is probably to kill Shadowed Men, since at 45+ you can easily pull them solo and kill them quickly.<BR>

Klex is a level 50 Iksar Skeleton warrior.  He has 11,000 hit points and hits for a max of 137 damage.  He is not particularly fast, he just takes a while to kill.  The easiest way to kill him is to partner with either a necromancer or a druid, and either fear-kite or regular kite.  Kiting with a druid is a little harder, because Klex will sometimes aggro on your pet instead of the druid (you should turn your pet's taunting off, to keep Klex following the druid around while your pet gets hundreds of free attacks from behind).  When Klex kills your pet, summon another one, cast your best Burnout spell on the pet, and send it after Klex.  If you're with a necro and the necro can constantly keep Klex feared, then you'll have an easy time; the downside is, Klex will probably wander past many other wandering mobs, who will aggro and attack you.  With a druid, you can have the druid run in a circle centered on you (meditating while your pet attacks Klex), so you don't have to go anywhere near mobs that spawn.  In either case, pull Klex out of the crater he spawns in (the glowing meteor crater in Burning Wood), or you'll end up dealing with a lot of wandering hornets.  The drop was common for a while, but appears to be rare now.  Expect to kill Klex a number of times.<BR>
<BR>

In a nutshell: Pull Klex out of the crater, to the south, where there is a large flat area with almost no wandering mobs.  Kite him there, or kill him outright if you have the proper group for it.<BR>
<BR>

Kelston Bernstar tells me that he killed Slixin Klex 11 times in a row recently, and the Dirt did not drop.  Apparently the Dirt has been nerfed back to its original extremely-rare drop state, instead of its relatively common state.  Sigh.  Another easy mob we have to kill over and over...<BR>

Jinalis Andir can be found in Dagnor's Cauldron.  I don't know if she roams, and if so how far she roams, but when we found her (thanks Myrr!) she was at approximately (-600, -2000), near the orc scout camp on the east side of the zone.  She is an Erudite female wearing a blue robe.<BR>
<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#aaaaaa">You say, 'hail Jinalis Andir'</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff">Jinalis Andir says 'Let us dispense with pleasantries, Teramenor .  I am Jinalis, as you know.  I imagine you want  to control the Elements.  The Element of Water, which I possess, is the most powerful of the Elements.  With it you can control the water which falls from the Air, erodes the Earth, and extinguishes Fire.  It is a pity you do not focus on the Prime Element, but if you wish to follow that fool Magi'kot to your doom, I will not stop you.

As I have not yet acquired the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water, I don't know what she says when you finally give her the items.<BR>

Turn in the following three items to Jinalis Andir in Dagnor's Cauldron, and she will give you the Element of Water:

Phinigel is in the very bottom of this dungeon; you'll need a group just to get to him, and two groups to take him out safely.  Kedge raids by high-level guilds usually end up clearing the zone anyway, so go on enough of these and Phinigel is your bitch.  However the staff is a rare drop, so be prepared to go back numerous times.<BR>

As far as fighting the boss fish himself, I have no idea how difficult it is, as I haven't fought him yet.  We'll see.<BR>

<BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/rain_of_karana.jpg"><BR><BR>

Tarbul Earthstrider is a named Hill Giant found in the Eastern Planes of Karana.  He roams the large rocky hill in the southern half of EK.  He's a very common spawn; when we arrived to hunt him down, he was already wandering about.  We killed him easily (we were there for another purpose, so we had 2 groups of people together; several warriors, druids, rangers, a cleric, and me, a mage), and he dropped the Rain of Karana.  15 minutes later, he was running around again!<BR><BR>

He was level 48 both times we saw him, and took a lot of punishment, but he went down no problem.  Both times he dropped the Rain of Karana, so it probably will drop every time you kill him.<BR><BR>

Nintalten Legbiter adds, "Trabul [sic] Earthstrider is a piece of cake with a lvl 49 Earth pet and a lvl 44 cleric.  That's how I did it :)"  Apparently if your level 49 earth pet beats on Tarbul, and you have a cleric cast Complete Heal on your pet every so often, Tarbul will go down fairly quickly.  You'd probably want to fire shield and burnout your pet, to speed things up.<BR>
<BR>

When I went to take this screenshot, I was level 49.  I was also invisible and TARBUL WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE THROUGH INVIS.  I don't know if this will hold true at lower levels, but it did today!<BR>

<A NAME="tears"></A><FONT SIZE="+0" COLOR="#ffff80"><B>&amp; Tears of Erollisi (Overthere: "Captain Rottgrime", always drop)</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/tears.jpg"><BR><BR>

I joined up with a group of people from various guilds who had banded together to get the good Captain dead, dead, dead, dead.  In fact, they got him four times, and the fourth time, the Tears of Erollisi went to me.  Killing the Captain isn't hard, you just need lots of tanks and clerics.  Casters who have pets can help, but I don't think any other spells will be useful against him.<BR>
<BR>

Pulling him from the outpost in the Overthere is difficult; the two times I was present, a dragoon was pulled along with him.  He is usually standing near the southeast corner of the Outpost, along with six undead marines, who are level 50.  You'll probably want a monk to feign pull the Captain, and it will be much easier to do at night when the dragoons are out on patrol (fewer things to aggro).  I don't know the exact method that was used however.<BR>
<BR>

You will take a Venril Sathir faction hit for killing Rottgrime; apparently it's a pretty sizable one, so be careful if you're used to being able to travel there (evil races and classes, for example).<BR>
<BR>

The following is the body of a post that came from a Monk message board, but the person who sent it to me (Kelston Bernstar of Requiem on The Tribunal) says he doesn't remember who posted it.<BR>
<BR>

<PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff" SIZE="+0">
"Ok, most will never need to know this, but if one person finds it useful,  
it's not a waste of time.  

Part of the insanely hard magician epic quest involves killing Captain  
Rottgrime in the outpost in Overthere. He is a level 55 skeleton, and doesn't  
seem to be too tough to kill. 
 
The trick is pulling him. Capt. Rottgrime is surrounded by 6 or 8 skeletons,  
all blue to me at 52 (someone said lvl 50, but I'm not sure). Besides that,  
there is a damn hard 55 or so Golems guarding both side entrances, and 4  
gargoyles, level 50-53 or so guarding the main entrance. And still, you have  
about 4 roaming DE goons, as well as General D'Veers who's tough as nails and  
a necro. Add to this the fact that most are KOS in the outpost, and it's not  
a pretty sight. 
 
The pull is actually not that hard. First off, you're probably going to want  
someone who is not KOS to pull him...Agnostic monks work nicely. My faction  
in the outpost was kindly, so I can roam freely. You need at least one other  
non kos person to help, and they dont' necessarily have to have FD. We had a  
troll warrior.  
 
Have your groups set up camp on the northwest wall, very near the outpost.  
Very few roamers, and no goons seem to come up that way. We had 2 groups: 2  
clerics, 2 magicians, 1 monk, 1 warrior, 2 necros, 1 druid, 1 shaman (turned  
out to be overkill), and an enchanter showed up a 
bit later.  
 
Get in to the outpost, and target rottgrime..stand as far back while still in  
shuriken range as possible. A great thing to have here is one of those nice  
snaring nets from Crystal Caverns. Have your lookout watch the golem on the  
far east side of the outpost, and when he is at his 
point closest to water, either cast snare net or chuck a shuriken at the  
captain, turn, and run like hell. If you happen to get stunned, use stone  
stance. Then run outside the outpost, well outside the gates, then FD. Those  
things hit hard, but never took more than a bubble or so, 
even with about 10 on my tail. Have your lookout/tagger run up to Rottgrim  
and start hailing him. 99% of the time, this will stop him, while everyone  
else walks back. Either /q to clear aggro, or have your mage CoTH you back,  
then run back up to capt, or have lookout pull him 
the rest of the way. 
 
Bang snap pow, easy kill, happy mage. We did it twice, 0 deaths. Faction is  
rough though...I went from kindly to indifferent in 4 kills (2 capt, 2  
goons). And on that note, for some reason a goon always managed to find us  
and show up with the captain...not a big deal, except for the 
additional faction hit. The only other advice I can give is to know where the  
goons are; they leave the outpost at midnight and usually come back or  
despawn at 10am if memory serves. Try to time it when they are furthest away. 
 
I wrote this for one reason: I asked 3 people about pulling this, and they  
either said it was impossible to split all those guys, or said to have a  
cleric with a click stick handy. There are other tactics; some have bards  
kiting the stuff around and a tagger to pull rottgrime, etc..but this was so  
clean and fast, seems like a waste of time any other way."

<A NAME="pegasus"></A><FONT SIZE="+0" COLOR="#ffff80"><B>* Pegasus Feather Cloak (South Karana: Quillmane, very rare drop)</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/mc_pegasus_feather_cloak.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Picture courtesy of <A HREF="http://www.magecompendium.com">The Mage Compendium</A></FONT><BR><BR>

Quillmane is a rare spawn, but he can spawn anywhere in the zone.  Most commonly he is found in the interior of the zone, away from the zone walls, but he can be out there, too.  He wanders almost constantly, and is killed almost instantly by any who see him (because the cloak you need for the quest is All/All and has unlimited charges of Levitate...).  This sucks, but it means it takes some real effort to get the cloak.<BR>
<BR>

Because Quillmane spawns randomly and wanders, the best way to get the cloak is to go to South Karanas with as many high level rangers and druids as you can gather.  More than 5 would be overkill, since you want to be grouped with them all.  Basically, what you should do is summon your pet of choice, get a SoW, and then run around the zone killing anything that wanders.  Static spawns like the Aviaks at their tower or the Tesch Mas Gnolls outside splitpaw, need not be killed (Quillmane doesn't spawn there, and there will always be people camping the Aviaks and Gnolls anyway).  Anything else that wanders -- centaurs, wolves, lions, elephants, aviaks, gnolls, treants (although there is a faction issue there) -- is fair game.  You want five trackers with you because they can always home in on a mob and kill it, and they can do this constantly -- the instant something shows up on tracking, they will go after it and kill it.  And the reason you want to be grouped is, if someone in your group does see Quillmane and kills him, then you will be able to get to the corpse and loot it before it opens up and some ninjalooter steals your cloak!<BR>

Even one high-level tracker with you can make this an easy enough camp.  (To put it another way, one tracker tracking and killing mobs, and Quillmane when he pops, is better than wandering about hoping to encounter Quillmane by yourself!)  If you have even one or two ranger or druid friends who can help, then your life will become immeasurably easier.<BR>
<BR>

Nevertheless, even with your entire guild scouring the zone for Quillmane, expect to spend at least several hours on getting the cloak.  If you're doing it solo, then may Mithaniel Marr protect your soul...<BR>
