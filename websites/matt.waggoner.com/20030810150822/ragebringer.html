<SPAN class="secthead">NOTES</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting Ragebringer Before Level 50</SPAN><BR><BR>

Generally speaking, the epic quests were designed to be done by characters who were level 50+; in almost all cases, you have to be level 46 or higher to do the quest at all, since for some quests, there are NODROP pieces that come from the Planes (and you have to be 46+ to even zone into the Planes).  Some of the epics' NPCs will deal with you if you are below 50, but many will not -- according to William Jackson, <SPAN class="npc">Stanos Herkanor</SPAN> will scoff at you if you give him the torn parchment pieces before level 50.  (I've had multiple people send in that bit of info.)  Whether this is true of all the rogue epic mobs, I don't know, but it seems to be true of Stanos, and since you hand in the final three items to Stanos, he probably won't reward you with <SPAN class="item">Ragebringer</SPAN> if you aren't level 50.  But then, maybe he will... who's willing to try? :)<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">The Planes</SPAN><BR><BR>

The <SPAN class="zone">Plane of Hate</SPAN> is not connected to any other zone through normal means; you cannot zone into Hate the same way you zone from <SPAN class="zone">West Freeport</SPAN> to <SPAN class="zone">East Commonlands</SPAN>.  There is only one way to get to the Plane of Hate: the level 46 wizard spell <SPAN class="spell">Alter Plane: Hate</SPAN>.  This spell teleports the wizard and his group to the port-in house in the Plane of Hate.  Note that it uses up a reagant (a <SPAN class="item">Fulligrans Soulstone of Innoruuk</SPAN>) which cost 125pp each, and can be purchased at the cleric guild in Neriak.<BR><BR>

Also, note that you <B>MUST BE LEVEL 46 OR HIGHER TO BE TELEPORTED INTO THE PLANE OF HATE!</B>  For this reason it is not recommended that you visit Hate until you are at least level 47, since if you lose your level and drop to 45 while you are in Hate, you may not be able to get back there to recover your corpse.  You can get rezzed into Hate no matter what level you are, but a raid wipeout may take more than 3 hours to recover from, and if that happens, you're basically screwed.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Other Notes</SPAN><BR><BR>

Most of the steps in this quest have to be done in the proper order.  The way the Guide is laid out represents that order, although there are a few cases where the order can be different (for example, you can pickpocket the two torn parchment pieces in either order; you can acquire the book from Hate at any time before you turn it in; etc.).<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Spawn Times</SPAN><BR><BR>

All spawn times are in REAL TIME, NOT GAME TIME.  E.g., a spawn time of "1 day" means 1 regular real life Earth day, not one day in Norrath (which is 72 minutes in real life).<BR><BR>

<DIV class="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/wield_rb.jpg" ALT="Ragebringer wielded">&nbsp; &nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/closeup_rb.jpg" ALT="Ragebringer close-up"></DIV><BR>

To get Ragebringer, you must turn in three items: the <SPAN class="item">Cazic Quill</SPAN>, the <SPAN class="item">Jagged Diamond Dagger</SPAN>, and the <SPAN class="item">General's Pouch</SPAN> to <SPAN class="npc">Stanos Herkanor</SPAN> in <SPAN class="zone">Highpass Hold</SPAN>.  Acquiring each of these three items requires a great deal of work (though not nearly so much as the other epic quests!).<BR><BR>

<A name="detail"></A><DIV class="bighead">- DETAILED STEPS -</DIV><BR><BR>

<A name="founy"></A><SPAN class="secthead">1. Pickpocket the Stained Parchment Top<BR>(North Kaladim - Founy Jestands)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to the dwarven city of Kaladim, and head into its northern section (<SPAN class="zone">North Kaladim</SPAN>).  There, locate <SPAN class="npc">Founy Jestands</SPAN> outside the bank and pickpocket the <SPAN class="item">Stained Parchment Top</SPAN> from him.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kaladim is located on the north wall of the <SPAN class="zone">Butcherblock Mountains</SPAN>, which are located on the western end of the continent of Faydwer.  A great statue of a dwarven king stands astride the city gates, which lead to South Kaladim.  Once inside the city, head north through the entry gate, then turn left and head past some shop buildings.  Stay to the right wall, and you will find a zone connection to North Kaladim.  Once you zone in, head along the passage a short ways until you see the following room:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/north_kaladim.jpg" ALT="North Kaladim">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/founy_jestands.jpg" ALT="Founy Jestands"></DIV><BR>

Founy should almost always be standing there unless he has recently been killed.  (Even if he is trained to another part of the zone, he will walk back to his normal spot immediately.)<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Pickpocketing the Parchment</SPAN><BR><BR>

Founy despawns every day at 7am game time, and respawns again at 8am game time (thanks Kintheris of Tarew Marr for the update).  He does NOT always spawn with the "Stained Parchment Top", so you may have to wait, or come back for another visit later.  The simplest way to get the parchment piece from him is to pickpocket it, so you should definitely max your pickpocket skill to 200 before attempting to steal the piece.<BR><BR>

Killing Founy is another option, but he hits for around 140 and probably backstabs for a lot more -- additionally, many other dwarves in the area will aggro if you attack him, so it can be quite a task to kill him.  You're probably better off just pickpocketing him.  (If you are level 53 or higher, and he aggroes on you, you can activate one of your defensive disciplines, like Counterattack or Nimble, to defend yourself while you flee the short distance to the zone line.)<BR><BR>

Even worse, however, is that there's now a level 60 dwarf named <SPAN class="npc">Crovsar Dirkbringer</SPAN> who spawns right near Founy, who will aggro if Founy aggroes.  This dwarf hits for up to 358 and is highly dangerous, so this part of the quest may have gained some unfortunate difficulty.  If you have the Nimble discipline (level 55), you can activate it if they aggro, and you should be able to make it to the zoneline.  Even the Counterattack discipline (level 53) works, as long as you can keep the dorfs from getting behind you ;)<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/crovsar.jpg" ALT="Crovsar Dirkbringer"><BR>

Ogony of Bertoxxulous says that if you throw something at Founy, you can pull him closer to the zoneline, and possibly without getting Crovsar to come along.  If you zone to South Kaladim and back fast enough, Founy will still be there -- and you can make him stop walking by asking him about the note (described below).  This way, you can attempt pickpocketing, and keep him away from Crovsar.  And you're right next to the zoneline, so if he does aggro, you're one step from safety.<BR><BR>

As Kaladim is full of dwarves, any players who are KOS in Kaladim will need to use SH to get to Founy.  Once you are near him, stand behind him and pickpocket him until you are convinced he does not have the piece (how many attempts you make before you are "convinced" is up to you -- in my opinion, if he doesn't have it after 20 attempts, I'd give up and come back later), or until you pickpocket the piece from him.<BR><BR>

It took me 2 trips to Kaladim to get the Stained Parchment Top from Founy.  My pickpocket skill was 200 before I attempted to PP him, and he never aggroed on me.<BR><BR>

Takalon reports that killing Founy is infeasible now; his regen and hit points appear to have been boosted through the roof.<P>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/siam_item_spt.jpg" ALT="Item: Stained Parchment Top"><BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Siamese of Rodcet Nife</DIV><BR>

Founy has other dialogue, but this is the only relevant bit:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'What note?'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Founy Jestands says 'I don't know what you're talking about, if you know what I mean.'  Founy fingers his belt pouch.  'You should leave now, if you know what's good for you.  Don't make me sic the crew on you.</SPAN><BR>
</DIV><BR>

<BR>

<A name="tani"></A><SPAN class="secthead">2. Pickpocket the Stained Parchment Bottom<BR>(Neriak Third Gate - Tani N`mar)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to the dark elf city of Neriak, and head into its deepest region, the <SPAN class="zone">Neriak Third Gate</SPAN>.  There, locate <SPAN class="npc">Tani N`mar</SPAN> at the rogue guild and pickpocket the <SPAN class="item">Stained Parchment Bottom</SPAN> from him.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Neriak is located in the very northeast corner of <SPAN class="zone">Nektulos Forest</SPAN>, itself north of <SPAN class="zone">East Commonlands</SPAN> on the east side of the continent of Antonica.  Neriak is divided into three sub-zones: you must travel through the <SPAN class="zone">Neriak Foreign Quarter</SPAN> and then the <SPAN class="zone">Neriak Commons</SPAN> to reach the Neriak Third Gate (N3G).  To get to the rogue guild, enter N3G and head past the cleric guild and pool of water, down to the main part of the city.  Angle right as you go through the main gate, and you will see the rogue guild.  Enter the rogue guild from the front door, turn right at the bottom of the entry stairs, and then turn right again and follow the path until you see Tani:<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/tani.jpg" ALT="Tani N`mar"><BR>

dark elves are somewhat less friendly than dwarves, so unless you are yourself a dark elf, getting to Tani may be difficult.  The easiest way is to get the <SPAN class="item">Mask of Deception</SPAN> from the <SPAN class="npc">Ghoul Assassin</SPAN> in <SPAN class="zone">Lower Guk</SPAN>, which has a right-click effect of <SPAN class="spell">Illusion: Dark Elf</SPAN> and lets you pass as a dark elf in their home city.  However, if you cannot acquire a Mask of Deception, or have ruined your faction with one of the dark elf factions to the point where you cannot pass through the city safely, you will need to use sneakhide to make your way to Tani.<BR><BR>

Tani despawns each game night at 8pm, and proceeds to respawn/despawn repeatedly until 10pm, when he respawns and stays up until 8pm the following evening.  (His repeated spawn/despawn may have been fixed by now.)<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Pickpocketing the Parchment</SPAN><BR><BR>

Once you are there, simply pickpocket Tani (read the guidelines above in the Founy section for details) until you get the Stained Parchment Bottom.  He doesn't always spawn with it, so again, it may take several trips; stop by whenever you are in the area.  It personally took me 4 trips to get the parchment.  (If he's still doing his multiple-respawn shtick specified above, each time he respawns means another chance that he has the parchment.)<BR><BR>

Aside from pickpocketing him on his spawn point (which is how I did it), there are various other methods.  Jereck of Quellious recommends having a friend create a level 1 dark elf necromancer, and using the necromancer's pet to pull Tani to the zoneline.  Park the pet next to Tani, then have the necro go outside the building and tell his pet to attack Tani.  Tani will destroy the pet instantly, and chase after the necro.  The necro can then run to the zoneline where the rogue (in dark elf form) will be waiting.  The necro lets Tani catch him and kill him, and then the rogue can keep hailing Tani to keep him in place while he tries to pickpocket him.<BR><BR>

Ferrall of Quellious confirms that this method works well, and that Tani will stay at his new spot and not wander home.  Once he despawns, he'll respawn at home like usual, but until that happens, he'll stay wherever you left him.  Presumably, since Tani stays where he kills the necromancer, you can do this yourself by creating a level 1 necromancer, letting him die, and then switching to your rogue, who will be conveniently hidden nearby (in a safe spot!).<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/siam_item_spb.jpg" ALT="Item: Stained Parchment Bottom"><BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Siamese of Rodcet Nife</DIV><BR>

Tani says a few things, but the relevant text is:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'What note?'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Tani N`Mar says 'Oh, you want that piece of paper Stanos was so hot after?'  He taps his belt pouch.  'Well, it's mine now, though it looks like ogre scratch to me. You're not getting it, Stanos is not getting it, and Hanns is not getting it.  It is MINE!  Now, Soandso , scamper off like the dog you are, before I decide I need more practice with these short swords!'</SPAN><BR>
</DIV><BR>

<BR>

<A name="hate"></A><SPAN class="secthead">3. Get the Book of Souls<BR>(Plane of Hate)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to the otherworldly <SPAN class="zone">Plane of Hate</SPAN>, and find the <SPAN class="item">Book of Souls</SPAN> on the <SPAN class="npc">Maestro of Rancor</SPAN>'s nightstand.  Steal it, and return to Norrath.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Book of Souls is simply sitting on a table in the Plane of Hate.  It has a spawn time that, apparently, varies from 8 to 12 hours -- but it's always an exact number of hours.  Thantos Shadowwalker of The 7th Hammer informs us that she saw the book spawn at exactly 12 hours after it was picked up, and on another instance exactly 8 hours after it was picked up.  So if someone has recently, erm, "acquired" it, you may need to wait a while.  Waiting while in the Plane of Hate is not really very safe, as there are a large number of wandering monsters that are very powerful and can even see through your sneakhide ability.  The safest way to get to the Book is to travel to Hate with a normal raid party, wait until the raid clears the Maestro's building and kills the Maestro (assuming he's up), and then run upstairs and go get the book.  Just click on it to pick it up.<BR><BR>

The Maestro's building is the large one in the northwest corner; the first floor of that building has a huge pipe organ in the northwest corner, in front of which the Maestro himself spawns.  Just inside the door to that building, on the right, you'll see a ramp leading up; once you are on the second floor of the Maestro's building, the book is found in the southwest corner (the upper floor has essentially the same layout as the lower floor).<BR><BR>

The book can be seen in the following picture, on the table on the right side:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/hate_room.jpg" ALT="Maestro's bedroom">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/hate_book.jpg" ALT="Book of Souls on the table"></DIV><BR>

This is the southwest corner of the second floor of the Maestro's building.  The top picture is facing roughly southwest; the bottom one is facing due west.<BR><BR>

<A name="combine"></A><SPAN class="secthead">4. Combine the Parchments<BR>(Highpass Hold - Stanos Herkanor)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to <SPAN class="zone">Highpass Hold</SPAN>, halfway between the cities of <SPAN class="zone">Freeport</SPAN> and <SPAN class="zone">Qeynos</SPAN> on the continent of Antonica, and locate <SPAN class="npc">Stanos Herkanor</SPAN>.  Give him the <SPAN class="item">Stained Parchment Top</SPAN> and <SPAN class="item">Stained Parchment Bottom</SPAN>, and he will give you the <SPAN class="item">Combined Parchment</SPAN>.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Highpass Hold is accessible from <SPAN class="zone">Kithicor Forest</SPAN> in the east, and the <SPAN class="zone">Eastern Plains of Karana</SPAN> in the west.  Roughly in the center of the zone is a hidden smugglers' camp; find your way to the Tiger's Roar inn and bar, and outside you will see this:<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/hhp_secret.jpg" ALT="Highpass secret passage"><BR>

Circled in red is the location of the secret underwater passage (it's very short, so there's no worries about drowning) to the smugglers' camp.  Swim through it, and follow the path, and you will come to the following area:<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/hhp_camp.jpg" ALT="Highpass smugglers' camp"><BR>

On the left is the path leading back to the underwater area, and to the right is the small cavern where Stanos is located.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Spawning Stanos</SPAN><BR><BR>

However, it's not that simple.  Normally, Stanos never spawns -- you must deal with <SPAN class="npc">Anson McBale</SPAN> to get him to spawn.  Anson is located in the same room that Stanos spawns in (that's Stanos on the right, and Anson in the middle):<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/anson_and_friends.jpg" ALT="Anson McBale and friends"><BR>

But again, it's not that simple.  Anson himself is not always up: he has a placeholder, confusingly enough called <SPAN class="npc">a smuggler</SPAN>, just like all the other "a smuggler" NPCs in the camp (there are around a dozen).  Anson's placeholder will be standing exactly where Anson is standing in that picture, and the placeholder smuggler will con blue to anyone around level 50.  The other smuggler, standing behind him, will con green (you can see this irrelevant, low-level smuggler in the picture above).<BR><BR>

A level 60 warrior with epic weapons and gear from the Temple of Veeshan was not able to solo Anson's placeholder (as of October 2001 -- due to the AA abilities that came with Luclin, and the improved gear from that expansion, it might be possible now), though a 60 warrior and a 51 rogue can kill him fairly easily, or even a solo 60 magician, epic or not.  The simplest method is to have the warrior pull the placeholder (the placeholder will virtually always come solo to a 60 puller) into the yard outside Anson's room, and run across the yard to the ramp that leads up to a ledge overlooking High Keep.  The placeholder CAN get stuck in pathing in the yard, so make sure he follows you all the way across.  Once he does, jump down off the ledge, run to the High Keep entrance, and wait.  The smuggler will eventually path to there, and you can fight him and kill him.  The High Keep guards will not assist the smuggler, nor will they assist you, so it's a straight fight.  (If your faction with High Keep guards is bad, however, they may attack you on general principle, so you'll need to pull the smuggler to somewhere else.<BR><BR>

Keep in mind that there are other blue smugglers in the area, and fighting them all can be difficult, not to mention the fact that you lose faction with Anson for killing them!  This is the reason you want a level 60 to pull the smuggler; if you aggro all the blue smugglers, you have to fight all of them.  You could bring an enchanter, too...)  The Anson spawn has an 18 minute spawn time, and you may need to kill the smuggler multiple times to get Anson to spawn.<BR><BR>

Once you have Anson spawned, there are two ways to get Stanos to spawn.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Method One</SPAN><BR><BR>

The first method is to walk up to Anson and have the following short conversation:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'I need to see Stanos'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Anson McBale says 'This better be important. </SPAN><BR>
</DIV><BR>

This will cause Stanos to spawn immedately.  According to Wulfang Bonecrusher of Tarew Marr, this only works if you're level 50 or above; otherwise, Anson tells you to go kill rats.  I don't know what the minimum faction is for this to work, but I do know that if you are indifferent or better to Anson, Stanos will spawn.  Anson, Stanos, and all the other smugglers are on the CarsonMcCabe faction, and the easiest way to raise that faction is to kill the orcs and gnolls that live in Highpass, and turn in their scalps to <SPAN class="npc">Captain Ashlan</SPAN> and <SPAN class="npc">Captain Orben</SPAN>, respectively (they wander around the orc and gnoll areas at the ends of Highpass Hold).  You can also kill the <SPAN class="npc">pickclaw goblins</SPAN> that live in <SPAN class="zone">High Keep</SPAN>'s basement, and turn in their left ears (4 at a time, I believe) to Captan Bosec in High Keep.<BR><BR>

Des Vetrov says that there's an easier way to get the faction -- the card quest in Qeynos.  <A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=523">Go here for details.</A><BR><BR>

Chaid of Drinal says that, as an agnostic dwarven rogue, he was able to use the above phrase to spawn Stanos when Anson conned DUBIOUS to him.  Assuming that anyone who is not KOS to Anson can spawn Stanos this way, there is no reason to do Method Two, outlined below.  This was several months ago, however; since then, Velenia Ankletinker of Zebuxoruk has informed me that with dubious faction, Anson replied, "I didn't know slime could talk!" and refused to spawn Stanos.  However, using sneak and repeating the query from behind Anson solved the problem, so faction doesn't really appear to be an issue.<BR><BR>

According to ThornKat of Torvonnilous, he was grouped with a druid and said the above trigger phrase.  Stanos spawned and despawned immediately.  Thorn then degrouped, and the trigger phrase worked properly.  Weird.<BR><BR>

Drakren of Fennin Ro says that, as a dubiously-conning Wood Elf rogue worshiping Bristlebane, Stanos spawned normally when he said, "I need to see Stanos."  Drakren said he was not sneaking or hiding at the time.  Go figure.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Method Two</SPAN><BR><BR>

The second method to get Stanos to spawn can be done if you are interested in seeing an unnecessary (but interesting, plot-wise) part of the quest.  Travel to the <SPAN class="zone">Qeynos Aqueduct System</SPAN> beneath the city of Qeynos, and find <SPAN class="npc">Malka Rale</SPAN>.  She will give you <SPAN class="item">Stanos's Pouch</SPAN>, which you can then give to Anson, causing Stanos to spawn.  BE CAREFUL DOING THIS!  If you are standing on Stanos's spawn point when you give the pouch to Anson, Stanos will not spawn, so you should stand behind Anson, preferably on the table in the corner, when you hand him the pouch.<BR><BR>

To get to Malka Rale's room, enter the QAS from the secret entrance outside the gates of Qeynos (there is a false wall to the left of the main gate).  Once you zone into the QAS, follow the path shown on the map below:<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/qcat_map.gif" ALT="Qeynos Aqueducts Map"><BR>

The gray sections of the map lead off to other, irrelevant areas.<BR><BR>

Malka's room looks like this:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/qcat_courier.jpg" ALT="Malka's room">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/malka_rale.jpg" ALT="Malka Rale"></DIV><BR>

In the left picture above, we see the room where Malka spawns.  Highlighted is her placeholder, <SPAN class="npc">a courier</SPAN>.  DO NOT KILL THE COURIER!  He will despawn around 9pm game time, and Malka will spawn at about 11pm game time, every game day.  She despawns around 7am.  Once Malka spawns, have the following conversation:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Malka Rale'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Malka Rale says 'Whew!  I thought you were one of Hanns' goons.  These sewers are a mess, you never know what is going to turn up next.  I really wish I could get out of here. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'I will help'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Malka Rale says 'Ok!  I am trusting you.  Take this pouch to Vilnius in West Karana. Last word I had from him, he was hanging out near one of the bandit camps.  Be careful, since he does not know you.  Just give him the pouch, and tell him I was.. delayed. &lt;grin&gt;  While you are doing that, I will be thinking of a way to get out of this slimehole.  With any luck, the Circle will learn the pouch is out of Qeynos, and will assume I got away.  That means they won't be looking for me here. </SPAN><BR>
</DIV><BR>

Malka then gives you an item called "Stanos' Pouch", which can be placed inside of other containers (it is not itself a container, even though it looks like one).  The pouch has recently been changed to actually have 20 charges of Summon Throwing Dagger, instead of the 0 charges it used to have (thanks to the many folks who sent this in).<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/item_sp.jpg" ALT="Item: Stanos' Pouch"><BR>

Give this pouch to Anson McBale to make Stanos spawn.  Once again, BE CAREFUL DOING THIS!  If you are standing on Stanos' spawn point when you hand in the pouch, Stanos will immediately despawn!  You should stand on the table behind Anson when you give him Stanos' Pouch.<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/stanos.jpg" ALT="Stanos Herkanor"><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Talking to Stanos</SPAN><BR><BR>

In either event, once Stanos spawns, you can have the following conversation:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Stanos Herkanor'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Stanos Herkanor says 'Ah, the pouch.  This is the first step Anson.  The Circle has to be upset having this taken right out from under them.  That speaks well of the person who did the taking.  Hanns must be even more furious now &lt;chuckle&gt;. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Anson McBale says 'Vilnius has always had a good eye for talent.  I think we can trust this one. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Stanos Herkanor says 'I tend to agree Anson.  We could make a deal.  I have a blade I won't use anymore, and you have those fine looking daggers Vilnius gave you.  Of course, you would have to do something for me first.  Let me tell you my story, then you decide. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'Tell me your story'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Stanos Herkanor says 'Johann Krieghor was the leader of the Circle and I was his second-in-command.  He made a dark bargain  with a  Teir'dal General.  The Circle was to assassinate Joren,  the high elf ambassador to Qeynos.  Had the plot worked, it would have weakened the alliance between high elves and humans, and possibly  caused a war between the two powers.  In either case, the Teir'Dal would have profited greatly by this event, and all others would have suffered.  I could not stand by and let this happen, but Johann would not be deterred, for the Teir'Dal had promised him much.  I had no choice but to kill Johann and the Teir'Dal agent.  I made it look like they offed each other, and then I hid the tools. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'What tools?'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Stanos Herkanor says 'To allow the assassin to slay a prince, and fight his way back out, a fell blade was crafted.  It was small enough to conceal under a garment and yet large enough to strike a mortal blow through armor.  Aided by vile Teir'Dal enchantments, it is much more fearsome than it appears.  I would glady rid myself of it, but I fear I can not until I clear my name with Hanns. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'I will clear your name'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Stanos Herkanor says 'I need proof that what I say about Johann is truth, so that Hanns may forgive me.   YOU can gather that proof for me.  First, travel to Kaladim and Neriak, and there, upon the persons of the rogue guildmasters, you should find that which I seek, two parts of a document I recovered from the dead agent.  I entrusted one to Founy, but that trust is gone, and Founy would betray me to Hanns were I to attempt to reclaim it.  Tani N'mar has the other, which he should not possess, and keeps it only to spite me, not knowing its real import.  Steal them both, and bring them back to me.  And don't let anyone follow you! If I am not around, tell Anson you want to see me. </SPAN><BR><BR>
</DIV>

<SPAN class="subhead">Combining the Parchment</SPAN><BR><BR>

Lest we forget why you have to do all this in the first place, the point of coming to HHP is to give Stanos the two parchment pieces you pickpocketed off the rogue trainers in steps 1 and 2.  Simply give Stanos the <SPAN class="item">Stained Parchment Top</SPAN> and the <SPAN class="item">Stained Parchment Bottom</SPAN> at the same time:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="npctalk">Stanos Herkanor says 'Excellent!  With this document I can..' &lt;He pauses for a moment&gt;. 'Damnation!  Curse my tired old mind, I forgot that I could not read the document.  It is written in some obscure code or language.  I can't decipher it, but I know someone who can.  Seek out one called Eldreth, an Erudite who used to do work for me.  I know not where he may be found these days, only that he will not be found in Erudin, as they want his head for some misdeed in the past.  Give him the complete parchment, and tell him I sent you.  He owes me.</SPAN><BR><BR>

<A name="translate"></A><SPAN class="secthead">5. Begin the Translation<BR>(Lake Rathetear - Eldreth)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to <SPAN class="zone">Lake Rathetear</SPAN>, and find <SPAN class="npc">Eldreth</SPAN> in the tower on the northeast island of the lake.  Give him the <SPAN class="item">Combined Parchment</SPAN>, plus 100pp and two unstacked <SPAN class="item">bottles of milk</SPAN> for payment so that he will translate it.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Lake Rathetear is located south of the <SPAN class="zone">Southern Plains of Karana</SPAN>, and west of <SPAN class="zone">Rathe Mountains</SPAN>.  Once you are in the zone, head to the northeast island which is located approximately at (+2600, -500).  On the island is a large tower, inside of which you will find Eldreth:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/lake_tower.jpg" ALT="Eldreth's tower">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/eldreth.jpg" ALT="Eldreth"></DIV><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Beginning the Translation</SPAN><BR><BR>

According to Wulfang Bonecrusher, Eldreth has an exactly 7.5 hour spawn time.  Zairu of Xegony confirms this number.<BR><BR>

Eldreth has a companion named <SPAN class="npc">Cyanelle</SPAN>, who is pretty much always standing in the tower next to him.  She's not his placeholder; she's just an additional magician NPC who stands there.  If you talk to her when Eldreth isn't there, she'll say so, but otherwise doesn't provide any useful information.<BR><BR>

Talk to Eldreth, and you will have the following conversation:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Eldreth'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Eldreth says 'Go away! I'm busy! I don't have time for scoundrels like you!  Leave me alone or I shall, um..turn you into, er, a fish or something!  That is what us powerful wizards do to those who annoy us!  Yes, that is it.  A fish!  &lt;leans towards you, looking abashed&gt; Did that sound scary enough? </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'That was scary'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Eldreth says 'Ha!  I knew it. I could see you trembling! Everyone fears an angry wizard and nobody wants to be a fish.  I know I detest fish, it is always fish fish fish around here.  Fish cakes, fish stew, fish wine, I am sick of fish.  But alas, while I am a powerful wizard, I am also a poor one.  Oh well, good things come to those who wait.  So, why are you here, Soandso ? </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'Stanos sent me'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Eldreth says 'Stanos?  Stanos Herkanor?  I thought he was long dead.  He nearly got me killed, in any case.  What does the old fool want of me now? </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'He wants you to translate this parchment.'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Eldreth says 'Ah, codes are my specialty! It's what I did for the Circle before Hanns took over.  But the Fox is wrong.  I owe him nothing!  As a fact, he owes me!  He wants this translated - he will have to pay! </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'I will pay you.'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Eldreth says 'Aye, pay, and pay you must.  I need 100 platinum pieces to begin my work. This tower is old and drafty and it will take that much to make it bearable.   And while you're at it, I need something else.  I am very busy here and have no time to shop, so bring me back a couple bottles of milk along with your very large bag of platinum, and I will translate anything you wish at that time. </SPAN><BR>
</DIV><BR>

Give him the Combined Parchment, 100 platinum pieces, and 2 bottles of milk.  (Do NOT stack the bottles of milk together; make sure they are SEPARATE when you hand them in.  It is not known whether this matters, but no one has volunteered to test it so far.  Also keep in mind that you don't want to accidentally drink your milk before handing it in, so I recommend buying an entire stack of milk before heading out to see Eldreth (and make sure you have other drinks above the milk, so that you don't use up your milk if you have to wait).  Milk is cheap, and a stack should be only a few pp at most.)  Once you hand him the items, Eldreth says the following:<BR><BR>

(Note about the milk: Raejin of Vallon Zek says that the milk CAN be stacked, and the hand-in will still work, but I wouldn't advise this until I get a couple more confirmations.  In any event, it's probably safer to leave the milk unstacked even if it is confirmed.  Shadowclimber of Prexus also confirms this; can I get a third?)<BR><BR>

(Contradiction!  Darkedmist Shadows of Fennin Ro tells me that stacking the milk does NOT work.  In any event, as it requires little effort, I would advise not stacking the milk.)<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">

<A name="yendar"></A><SPAN class="secthead">6. Continue Translating<BR>(Steamfont Mountains - Yendar Starpyre)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to the <SPAN class="zone">Steamfont Mountains</SPAN> on Faydwer, and find <SPAN class="npc">Yendar Starpyre</SPAN> roaming the zone.  Give him the <SPAN class="item">Scribbled Parchment</SPAN> to translate, and he will give you back the <SPAN class="item">Tattered Parchment</SPAN>.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Steamfont Mountains are accessible from <SPAN class="zone">Lesser Faydark</SPAN> in the west, and lead to the gnomish city of <SPAN class="zone">Ak'anon</SPAN> at the south end of the zone.  Druids of an appropriate level may also teleport to Steamfont.<BR><BR>

Yendar roams the zone, though his usual path seems to be from the entrance to the minotaur caves in the northeast, southwest past the windmills, and all the way down toward the druid portal ring.<BR><BR>

<DIV class="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/yendar.jpg" ALT="Yendar Starpyre">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/tobon.jpg" ALT="Tobon Starpyre"></DIV><BR>

If Yendar is not up, you can go to his brother, <SPAN class="npc">Tobon Starpyre</SPAN> (pictured above right), who is found in the Library Mechanimagica (the caster guild) in Ak'anon and say to him, "Who is Yendar?"  This will cause Yendar to spawn out in Steamfont, however reports vary on whether or not you can do this immediately after Yendar despawns or if you have to wait a while.<BR><BR>

Numerous reports indicate that Yendar can indeed be spawned, but there is still some debate as to whether this can be done immediately after he despawns, or whether you must wait.  Most reports indicate that you must wait a couple of hours after he despawns, and if he's still not up, you can talk to Tobon and Yendar will immediately spawn.  Several people have claimed that you can chain-spawn Yendar (i.e. every time he despawns, immediately go talk to Tobon) but many others have said this is false.  I'm not going to confirm one way or the other until I test this myself.<BR><BR>

Tobon replies:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'Who is Yendar?'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Tobon Starpyre says 'Oh, he is my older brother.  Used to be the leader of the Eldritch Collective.  Then he founded the Observers, a pretty good piece of work.  Went off his rocker a long while back, though.  Became obsessed with Innoruuk and the Teir'dal.  Stays away for days at a time, nobody knows where he has been.  Mother still worries about him, asked me to keep an eye on him. But he is a grown gnome, and with his mastery of the art, has little to fear in this world or others.  But if you are seeking him, I would look outside Ak'Anon, in the Steamfonts.  That is where he makes his home these days. </SPAN><BR>
</DIV><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Dealing with Yendar</SPAN><BR><BR>

Yendar will not stop walking when you hail him; you have to mention the document for him to stop walking.  He'll start walking again after a little while, so if you want to keep him in one place, keep asking him about the document:<BR><BR>

This is not a simple matter; Renux is a level 50 rogue who wields a weapon called Trochilic's Skean.  It is a 1HS sword that procs Clockwork Poison, a stun/DoT that is very deadly.  There are two simple ways to kill Renux:

<OL>
<LI>Bring a swarm of people and mob her.  She'll die relatively easily, but you may take a few casualties.
<LI>Bring a group consisting of yourself (the rogue), a druid, an enchanter, a warrior, a cleric, and another person (preferably another rogue).  The druid will snare Renux, and kite her in large circles around the zone.  The druid should KEEP snaring her, to make sure that Renux's aggro stays on the druid (whom she cannot reach) instead of on the others.  The enchanter should Tash Renux, the rogues and warriors should beat her down, the cleric should keep everyone alive (in case Renux does get off a few hits), and the druid should... well... keep snaring and DoTing Renux.  Renux appears to have somewhere upwards of 20,000 hit points, so she can take several minutes to kill with this method, but as long as you all start at full mana, you should be fine.
</OL>

There are certainly other methods of killing her, but these are relatively simple.  I know of one rogue who did this step with only himself (52 rogue), a 58 enchanter, and a 60 ranger.  The enchanter chain-tashed Renux while the ranger snared her; then the ranger and rogue beat Renux to death while she chased the enchanter (the Tashan line of spells have a pretty large amount of aggro, and cast very quickly).  I've even heard of Renux being killed by one druid and one rogue!<BR><BR>

Stor Gendibal sends in this odd tidbit:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv"><SPAN class="npctalk">I wanted to give you some new info on the Rogue Epic that I noticed in my questing today. I have a level 51 rogue on the Terris-Thule server named Stor, and today a 60 necro, a 60 druid and myself killed Renux in Steamfont.  Now, the news isn't that you can kill Renux with 3 people, we all know that can be done.  No, the news is this:  After Renux drops below 20% health, if she has a melee person (or pet, it happened more than once) attacking her, she will heal herself for 12% of her life.  She's not casting a heal spell, and you can always tell right before she does this because she will say the line she says when you attack her the first time, I believe it's something about "Have you ever had your heart handed to you by a woman?".</SPAN></DIV><BR>

This (her healing by 12% when she reaches 18-20% health) has been confirmed by Dakth Frostshadow of E'ci.<BR><BR>

Renux gives the following faction hits when she dies: -CircleOfUnseenHands, -CorruptQeynosGuards, -KaneBayle, +MerchantsofQeynos, +GuardsofQeynos.  Once Renux is killed, she says:<BR><BR>

This means, in case you care, that Renux is Stanos's daughter.  (Interestingly, Renux can also be found at the rogue guild in Qeynos, along with the aforementioned Hanns.  It's been suggested that the Renux in Qeynos despawns when she spawns in Steamfont, but no one has confirmed this yet.)<BR><BR>

The blade is a gift from Innoruuk himself, forged in his temple and imbued with rage.  Be sure to recover it after the mission is complete, it is much too powerful to leave in the hands of those we intend to <I>il'kaash</I> in the future.  Combined with Stanos' skill, Joren and his guards should fall easily.<BR><BR>
The Guise has been handcrafted my our Master Coercer and should allow the wearer to pass undetected as Koada'dal, thus allowing the assassin to gain entry into the Ambassador's quarters.  Luckily, it shall be a human transforming himself into that <I>zm'rina</I> form.<BR><BR>
Be sure to eliminate all the human <I>x'kanda</I> you have recruited, and have no fear of the repercussions, for the Circle of Unseen Hands is no threat to us here in Neriak.<BR><BR>

Majax of Solusek Ro tells us that if you tell Stanos that you killed Renux, he'll yell at you and you'll take a negative faction hit with the Highpass Guards faction.  The conversation is as follows:<BR><BR>

<A name="vghera"></A><SPAN class="secthead">9. Kill General V`ghera<BR>(Kithicor Forest - General V`ghera and his aides)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to <SPAN class="zone">Kithicor Forest</SPAN>.  Find the house full of evil dark elves, and give one of them the <SPAN class="item">Sealed Box</SPAN>.  <SPAN class="npc">General V`ghera</SPAN> will spawn.  Kill him and take his <SPAN class="item">General's Pouch</SPAN>.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kithicor Forest is directly adjacent to <SPAN class="zone">Highpass Hold</SPAN>.  It is also west of <SPAN class="zone">West Commonlands</SPAN>, and south of the halfling city of <SPAN class="zone">Rivervale</SPAN>.  The house full of dark elves is located on the east side of a small hill, at coordinates (+800, +2400).<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/nemesi_de_house.jpg" ALT="dark elf house"><BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Nemesi of Vallon Zek</DIV><BR><BR>

The house, looking through the front door.  Outside you can see some low-level ghouls and skeletons guarding the place.  This shot was taking during the day.  At night, there are also higher-level undead (35+) guarding the house.<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/nemesi_de_house_int.jpg" ALT="dark elf house closeup"><BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Nemesi of Vallon Zek</DIV><BR><BR>

Note that the mobs named <SPAN class="npc">Tasi V`ghera</SPAN> and <SPAN class="npc">Ioltos V`ghera</SPAN> are <B>NOT GENERAL V`GHERA!</B>  They merely have the same surname (they're probably his siblings or cousins or something).<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Spawning the General</SPAN><BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/dakth_general_vghera.jpg" ALT="General V`ghera"><BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Dakth Frostshadow of E'ci</DIV><BR><BR>

The dark elves in the house are KOS to everyone.  They are also all level 55+, and are highly dangerous.  If you give the <SPAN class="item">Sealed Box</SPAN> to any of them, General V`ghera will immediately spawn inside the house (and he will probably kill you).  General V`ghera is a level 63 shadow knight, casts several dangerous spells, hits for over 200, and has a 500 damage lifetap proc, as well as a huge harmtouch.  He also has around 32,000 hit points.<BR><BR>

As a result, the best way to kill him is to, before spawning him, first clear out most of the house so that there is only one dark elf left.  BE SURE your pullers leave ONE of the dark elves behind, otherwise you will not be able to turn in your Sealed Box to spawn the General!  There is debate over whether <SPAN class="npc">Coercer Q`ioul</SPAN> or <SPAN class="npc">Brigadier G`tav</SPAN> is the best choice, but Mizchif of Fennin Ro pointed out the following (copied from an old, long-since deleted post on <A href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse" target="_top">The Safehouse</A>):<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="npctalk">The one major disagreement I have with that guide, having watched it both ways in the last two weeks, is that I agree with the poster above that you're far better off to leave the Brigadier as the last named DE in the cabin, NOT the Coercer.<BR><BR>
(1) From where the Brigadier stands, you'll be out of the General's line of sight when he spawns and hence will have time to re-hide.<BR><BR>
(2) If you leave the Coercer up, you have to pull her out of the cabin to do the turn-in, or the General WILL see you when he spawns and you're dead for a fight you'd much rather be present at. The debuff pull/wait for her to rebuff on the way back routine is just way too cute and complicated, IMHO<BR><BR>
(3) Plus there's the risk of aggro from the Coercer turning to buff her pet at the wrong moment, or the pet aggroing on you<BR><BR>
(4) Plus, as pointed out above, you will want to kill the Coercer for her robe drops, and it's bad manners to not leave at least one named DE up in case someone else is doing a raid within the next 8 hours<BR><BR>
(5) Plus the Coercer is an easier kill than the Brigadier (chanter vs warrior)<BR><BR>
(6) Plus the Coercer will buff the General if she gets the chance, while the Brigadier doesn't buff. </SPAN><BR><BR>
</DIV>

I agree with everything there EXCEPT point 4: When we did my General raid, the Brigadier himself dropped a Kedge robe when he was killed, and the Coercer did not.  Most raids will probably kill off the final DE once the last rogue has gotten his General's Pouch, so for the purpose of getting the robe, it doesn't matter which one you save for last.  However, the safety and reliability issues for using Brigadier G`tav vs. using the Coercer are all valid, and as such, the Brigadier is probably a better choice.<BR><BR>

The exact method for spawning the General goes like this: sneakhide behind the Dark Elf you're handing the box to.  Break hide (BUT DO NOT BREAK SNEAK!).  Hand the box to the DE.  Hide again.  THEN hit TRADE.  This will cause the General to spawn, but he'll remain safely unaware of your presence.  Thanks to Myce Elffe of Saryrn.<BR><BR>

You will need a force of around 30 people to kill the General safely.  It should be a good mix of tanks, nukers, healers, etc.  This force should begin assembling at the Highpass Hold zone border area (in Kithicor) at around midnight game time.  The reason for this is so that by the time it is 8 am in game, all of the wandering undead in Kithicor will have despawned, and your rangers will be able to start individually pulling the dark elves from the house, to your waiting raid party, who will dispatch them.  The rangers, if they are high enough level, can actually start doing this before the undead despawn, since they can simply bring the undead with them (none of the wandering undead in Kithicor are particularly powerful, and are no threat to a large party of level 50+ people).<BR><BR>

Once the DE house is cleared (EXCEPT for Brigadier G`tav, or whichever DE you choose to leave behind), everyone in the party should move to the road north of the DE house, at approximately +1100, +2600.  Be sure that they do not run near the DE house on their way there.  The party should then buff up and get ready to fight.<BR><BR>

(From this point, I will refer to the Brigadier as the last DE, even though you may use someone else.)<BR><BR>

At this point, only Brigadier G`tav should be inside the house.  The rogue who has the Sealed Box should sneak-hide, move into the house, stand BEHIND the Brigadier, and give him the box.  Due to the Brigadier's positioning, and where General V`ghera spawns (he always spawns IN the house, regardless of the location of the dark elf you hand the box to), the rogue SHOULD have time to re-hide before the General notices him.  At this point, the waiting ranger can solo-pull the General over to the raid party, while the rogue sneaks away from the house, and goes to join the party.<BR><BR>

<B>WARNING:</B> If any roaming mobs aggro you while you are attempting to hand in the Sealed Box to the Coercer or Brigadier or whoever, you may very well lose it -- if you hand an item to an aggroed mob, it will poof.  So make sure there are no mobs nearby (use F9 if necessary to get a look at the surrounding area) when handing in the box.<BR><BR>

Once the General is dead, loot the <SPAN class="item">General's Pouch</SPAN> off his corpse.  This pouch, like <SPAN class="item">Stanos' Pouch</SPAN>, is NOT a container, so you may put it safely inside a backpack.  The General will RARELY also drop the <SPAN class="item">Cazic Quill</SPAN>.  If he does, congratulations!  You are DONE WITH THE QUEST -- you should now have the <SPAN class="item">General's Pouch</SPAN>, the <SPAN class="item">Cazic Quill</SPAN>, and the <SPAN class="item">Jagged Diamond Dagger</SPAN> to give to <SPAN class="npc">Stanos</SPAN> (see step 10, below).  However the reported drop rate for the Quill is roughly 1 in 10, so don't expect him to drop it very often.  (If he does not drop the Quill, refer to the "Cazic Quill Subquest" section below for details on the alternate method of obtaining the Quill.)<BR><BR>

A common practice is for several rogues to have a "General party", which basically means that they all turn in their Sealed Boxes one at a time, causing multiple General V`gheras to spawn.  Once the first general is dead, the next rogue moves to the house again, hands in HIS box to Brigadier G`tav, the ranger pulls V`ghera again, and you kill him again.  Repeat this process until all rogues present have their Pouches.  (Note that if you take a long while, the nightly undead may start spawning, so your group will have to keep an eye on them -- a common practice is to have the enchanters keep the undead mezzed during the General fight, so that the undead can be picked off afterward.)<BR><BR>

If the Brigadier aggroes on someone, you will not be able to give him the Sealed Box until he loses aggro.  The usual method is to have an enchanter charm him so that he is aggroed on nobody except the enchanter, and then to mez and mem blur him over and over until it takes, and he forgets what he's doing.  If you kill him, then no other rogues get to turn in their boxes until the dark elves start respawning (8 or 24 hours, depending on who you believe)!  However once all the rogues are done with their boxes, you may freely kill him, for there is a chance that the Brigadier will drop the Robe of the Kedge (see the "Cazic Quill" subquest, summarized at top and detailed below)!<BR><BR>

If, as described in step 9 above, <SPAN class="npc">General V`ghera</SPAN> does not drop the <SPAN class="item">Cazic Quill</SPAN>, then you will need to do a separate sub-quest to acquire the Cazic Quill.<BR><BR>

In the <SPAN class="zone">Western Plains of Karana</SPAN> there is (sometimes) a Barbarian named <SPAN class="npc">Vilnius the Small</SPAN>.  If you give him the <SPAN class="item">Robe of the Kedge</SPAN>, the <SPAN class="item">Robe of the Ishva</SPAN>, the <SPAN class="item">Robe of the Oracle</SPAN>, and the <SPAN class="item">Shining Metallic Robes</SPAN>, he will give you the Cazic Quill.<BR><BR>

<A name="oracle"></A><SPAN class="secthead">1. Get the Robe of the Oracle<BR>(Oracle of K'Arnon - Ocean of Tears)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Ocean of Tears is only accessible by either taking the boat from <SPAN class="zone">East Freeport</SPAN>, or the <SPAN class="zone">Butcherblock Mountains</SPAN>.  The Freeport boat passes right by where the Oracle stands, so it's much easier to start from that side of the ocean.  The Oracle is standing on the north side of the goblin island in the Ocean of Tears, and he is located at approximate coordinates (-500, -8800).  If you go to the dock on the Sisters Island, the Oracle's island is visible across the channel (the location of the Oracle is circled in red):<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Kill the Oracle</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Oracle is a level 40 wizard, who is guarded by the <SPAN class="npc">Guardian of K'Arnon</SPAN>, a level 40 (paladin? warrior?).  Any 50+ group will not have any problem killing the Oracle; I myself did it with one 51 rogue (me), one 58 enchanter, and the 60 druid that the enchanter was botting.  The enchanter mezzed the Guardian, then chain-stunned the Oracle while the druid nuked and dotted, and I backstabbed.  As soon as I'd looted the Robe of the Oracle from the Oracle's corpse, the druid ported us out.<BR><BR>

The other method to get a Robe of the Oracle is to buy one from another player.  The Robe usually sells for well under 1,000 platinum (these days you can probably find them for 100-200pp in the Bazaar).  Killing the Oracle is so trivial that it's usually not worth spending the time and money trying to find someone who is selling the robe.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Ghoul Arch Magus lives in the Ruins of Old Guk (aka Lower Guk), which is only accessible from <SPAN class="zone">Guk</SPAN> (aka Upper Guk), which itself is only accessible from <SPAN class="zone">Innothule Swamp</SPAN>, south of the <SPAN class="zone">Southern Desert of Ro</SPAN> and east of <SPAN class="zone">the Feerrott</SPAN>.  The GAM himself is in the north wing of the "dead side" of Lower Guk.  As his location is well-known and usually camped, I won't bother with a map.  There are plenty of other sources for that (say, <A href="http://www.eqatlas.com" target="_top">EQ Atlas</A>).<BR><BR>

This is the room the GAM spawns in.  The GAM is the rear spawn, near the back of the room.<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/lguk_room.jpg" ALT="Ghoul Arch Magus's room"><BR>

[TODO: Decent Picture of Ghoul Arch Magus]<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting the Robe</SPAN><BR><BR>

The GAM is an uncommon spawn, and he drops the SMR as his rare drop, so it may take several hours of camping to get an SMR.  Take a full group down there, and kill your way to his room.  Camp in or near his room until he drops your SMR.  The GAM himself is a wizard, and casts some dangerous spells, but he is not particularly difficult to kill.<BR><BR>

The other method to get Shining Metallic Robes is to buy one from another player.  The SMR's price varies widely from server to server; <A href="http://www.eqprices.com" target="_top">EQ Prices</A> says that the SMR's average price is around 4,900pp, although I've heard price ranges from 1,000pp to 10,000pp.  This is, in general, a much simpler method than trying to get the robe yourself.<BR><BR>

<A name="ishva"></A><SPAN class="secthead">3. Get the Robe of the Ishva<BR>(Ishva Mal - Splitpaw Lair, or Coercer Q`ioul - Kithicor Forest)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kill the <SPAN class="npc">Ishva Mal</SPAN> in <SPAN class="zone">Splitpaw Lair</SPAN>, and loot the <SPAN class="item">Robe of the Ishva</SPAN> off his body; or, kill <SPAN class="npc">Coercer Q`ioul</SPAN> in <SPAN class="zone">Kithicor Forest</SPAN>, and loot the Robe of the Ishva off her body; or, buy the Robe from another player.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="minorhead">The Ishva Mal Method</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Splitpaw Lair is located roughly in the center of the <SPAN class="zone">Southern Plains of Karana</SPAN>.  The Ishva Mal's room is inside Splitpaw, through an underwater passage partway through the dungeon:<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/splitpaw_map.gif" ALT="Splitpaw map"><BR>

The pool of water on the map above is seen in the picture below:<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/splitpaw_water.jpg" ALT="Splitpaw water room"><BR>

The underwater passage entrance is highlighted by the red circle.  You have to go straight down into the water a little ways to enter the passage.<BR><BR>

Go through the passage, then swim upward and you'll be in a small cave.  A passage to the north leads to a few small storage rooms; the room way in the back corner is the Ishva Mal's room:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/splitpaw_room.jpg" ALT="Ishva Mal's room">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/ishva_mal.jpg" ALT="The Ishva Mal"></DIV><BR>

In the left picture, you can see two gnolls.  The one circled in red is the placeholder for the Ishva Mal, shown at right.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Killing the Ishva Mal</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Ishva Mal is a level 45 caster (not sure what kind), but he's pretty easy to kill.  I did it with the same group of 51 rogue, 58 enchanter, and botted 60 druid, with no problems whatsoever.  He is an uncommon to rare spawn, and drops the Robe of the Ishva fairly often (as far as I know -- I got my robe on his first kill).  Not a big deal.<BR><BR>

Since gnolls don't have robe textures, it's not possible to tell whether the Ishva Mal has the robe or not without killing him.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="minorhead">The Coercer Method</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

See "Getting There" in the main quest step 9, above.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Killing the Coercer</SPAN><BR><BR>

If your goal is to kill only the Coercer, then your best bet is to find a 60 ranger who knows how to solo-pull her.  Set up a well-balanced party of 6-12 people at the <SPAN class="zone">Rivervale zone</SPAN> line in Kithicor during the game day (8am - 7pm game time), and have the 60 ranger pull the Coercer solo to your group.  MAKE SURE you dispel her repeatedly, otherwise she will be hasted and buffed and will be harder to kill.  Then, kill her, and she will always drop the Robe of the Ishva.  Sometimes, too, she will drop the <SPAN class="item">Robe of the Kedge</SPAN> (see below).<BR><BR>

It was originally thought that if the Coercer appears to be wearing a green robe with brown trim, then she has only the Robe of the Kedge, and if she appears to be wearing a blue robe with purple trim, then she definitely has the Robe of the Ishva, and POSSIBLY the Robe of the Kedge.  However, Fastan of Terris Thule sends that his guild once killed the Coercer when she was wearing the green robe, but she dropped only the Ishva robe.  This may have been a fluke; can anyone else confirm this happening?  I guess the upshot is, kill the Coercer as often as possible, regardless of what she's wearing.<BR><BR>

The Coercer has a spawn time of 1 real-time day, along with all the other static dark elves in the house.<BR><BR>

Instead of going to Splitpaw or Kithicor, of course, you can simply buy a Robe of the Ishva from another player.  I don't know how much they sell for but it isn't a huge amount.<BR><BR>

<A name="kedge"></A><SPAN class="secthead">4. Get the Robe of the Kedge<BR>(Phinigel Autropos - Kedge Keep, or dark elves - Kithicor Forest)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kill <SPAN class="npc">Phinigel Autropos</SPAN> in <SPAN class="zone">Kedge Keep</SPAN>, and loot the <SPAN class="item">Robe of the Kedge</SPAN> off his body; or, kill all of the dark elves in the house (see main quest step 9, above) in <SPAN class="zone">Kithicor Forest</SPAN>, until one of them drops the Robe of the Kedge.  The RotK is NODROP so you cannot buy one from another player, although you CAN multiquest with the RotK, but ALL players involved in the multiquesting MUST be at least level 50, otherwise the robes will poof when they are handed in.  Thanks (and heartfelt sorrow) to James Delaney for pointing that out.  (I did the multiquest method myself; a 60 gnome magician handed in his Kedge robe, and then *after* he finished handing it in, I handed in the rest of the robes, and it worked -- I got the Cazic Quill from Vilnius.)<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="minorhead">The Fish Method</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kedge Keep is located at the bottom of the lake in <SPAN class="zone">Dagnor's Cauldron</SPAN>.  The entry coordinates are approximately (-1000, -1000), at literally the bottom of the lake.  Right around there are a lot of broken pillars, etc., which mark the entrance to the zone.  The below picture was taken facing north, into the Kedge Keep zone border:<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/kedgezone.jpg" ALT="Kedge Keep zone entrance"><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Killing Phinigel</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kedge Keep is entirely underwater, so you will need to have some method of extended underwater breathing for you and your entire party.  The best method is to acquire items with a permanent effect of <SPAN class="spell">Enduring Breath</SPAN> for everyone, though this can be difficult (although less so lately, with the proliferation of Enduring Breath items since the Luclin expansion).  There are many such items but three of the most common are the <SPAN class="item">Fishbone Earring</SPAN> (rare drop off a 5-hour spawn named <SPAN class="npc">Hadden</SPAN> in <SPAN class="zone">Qeynos Hills</SPAN>), some kind of quest necklace that you get from hunting in <SPAN class="zone">The Grey</SPAN>, and the <SPAN class="item">Lodizal Shell Shield</SPAN> (acquired by killing <SPAN class="npc">Lodizal</SPAN>, in <SPAN class="zone">Iceclad Ocean</SPAN>, for his shell and turning it in, along with 1,000pp, to an Othmir in Cobalt Scar).<BR><BR>

Another method is to bring along a magician who can summon dozens of waterstones for everyone.  A waterstone is a nonstackable, single-use item that has one charge of Enduring Breath, which lasts roughly 36 minutes.  You can also have Enduring Breath cast on you by some classes, including enchanters, but if it starts to run out and they're LD or otherwise occupied, it could be bad news for you.<BR><BR>

Unless you have Enduring Breath items for everyone in your party, bring along a magician to summon waterstones.<BR><BR>

You'll need a party of 12 people level 55+ to safely kill Phinigel, or a larger party of 50+.  It's been done with as few as 6 people but it's highly dangerous if you don't know exactly what you're doing.  Phinigel is deep within Kedge Keep, at the bottom of a large vertical room.  The usual method is to have a monk feign-pull his guardians (<SPAN class="npc">swirlspine guardians</SPAN>) up to the party, kill them all, and then kill Phinigel once his guards are all dead.  Phinigel drops several items needed for several epic quests, including the Robe of the Kedge, but he drops any of them rarely, so do not expect him to drop your robe the first time.  There are other, better guides to dealing with Phinigel, so I will not go into any more detail here; your best bet is to go along on Kedge raids until you get your robe.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="minorhead">The dark elf Method</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

See "Getting There" in the main quest step 9, above.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Killing the dark elves</SPAN><BR><BR>

You'll need a pair of high-level rangers to safely solo pull the dark elves out of the house.  Refer to step 9 in the main quest above for details on how to set up for killing the dark elves.  Clearing the dark elf house will result in a Kedge robe about one time in three, according to what I've read, and the robe can drop off ANY of the dark elves.  (I've personally seen it drop from <SPAN class="npc">Brigadier G`tav</SPAN>).<BR><BR>

Since the RotK is NODROP, you cannot buy one from another player, but you CAN have them multiquest it with you (but all players involved in the multiquesting need to be level 50 or above, or the robes will POOF when you hand them in!).<BR><BR>

<A name="vilnius"></A><SPAN class="secthead">5. Turn in the Robes<BR>(Vilnius the Small - Western Plains of Karana)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Hand in the four robes (Oracle, SMR, Ishva, Kedge) to <SPAN class="npc">Vilnius the Small</SPAN> in <SPAN class="zone">West Karana</SPAN>, in exchange for the <SPAN class="item">Cazic Quill</SPAN>.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Vilnius the Small, a barbarian male, is found at approximate coordinates (+150, -6700), at the top of a hill just east of a bandit camp on the west end of the mountain range in WK.  The bandit camp, which is just west (and downhill) from Vilnius' spawn point, is shown in the picture below (the view is from Vilnius' spawn point):<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/wk_camp.jpg" ALT="West Karana bandit camp"><BR>

From the camp, looking east (uphill), Vilnius' spawn point can be seen here, circled in red:<BR><BR>

<IMG class="a" SRC="rb/wk_spawn.jpg" ALT="Vilnius' spawn point"><BR>

Vilnius' placeholder, <SPAN class="npc">a brigand</SPAN>, and Vilnius himself, are shown below:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/a_brigand.jpg" ALT="a brigand">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/vilnius.jpg" ALT="Vilnius the Small"></DIV><BR>

The brigand, as well as all the bandits, are on the KaranaBandits faction, but Vilnius is indifferent to all.<BR><BR>

However, Vilnius is not there all the time; he has a placeholder (the aforementioned brigand) who despawns around 9 or 10pm game time each day.  Once the brigand despawns, Vilnius will spawn at 11pm game time (and will despawn at around 8am game time).  If the brigand is up, you don't need to kill him; just wait until he despawns.<BR><BR>

The <SPAN class="npc">bandits</SPAN> in the camp are around level 9-12, so they aren't exactly a threat, although they could make things inconvenient should they decide to attack while you are trying to hand items in to Vilnius.  If the brigand is not spawned during the day, then you may need to start killing bandits to get him to spawn, but this is unconfirmed (every time I've stopped by his spot, either Vilnius or the brigand were up).  There are also numerous wandering mobs in this zone, from bandits to animals to giants.  Make sure nothing is wandering around near you when you turn in the robes to Vilnius.<BR><BR>

Kalok Sundancer of Bristlebane tells me that the only time you need to kill any of the bandits is if the brigand does NOT spawn up on top of the hill, where I've marked him.  If he's in the bandit camp, or does not spawn at all, then basically you need to kill everything in sight (including the brigand, if he spawns in the camp).  This will reset the spawn and after a bit, everything should be back to normal.  It may be necessary to kill the various other groups of bandits that spawn in the hills; there are several of them scattered about.  This should not normally be a problem, and presumably after the servers go down for a patch or maintenance, everything should spawn normally.<BR><BR>

According to Fluxus of Tarew Marr, Vilnius may not always spawn normally.  He sat through seven game-days waiting for the Barbarian to show up, and when Vilnius finally did spawn, he spawned at 1am game-time.  However, Fluxus said he killed two of the placeholder spawns.  That may have messed things up; my advice is to leave the placeholder alone, unless he's not in his normal spot.<BR><BR>

Hand the four robes (<SPAN class="item">Robe of the Oracle</SPAN>, <SPAN class="item">Robe of the Kedge</SPAN>, <SPAN class="item">Robe of the Ishva</SPAN>, <SPAN class="item">Shining Metallic Robes</SPAN>) in to Vilnius, and he says the following:<BR>

<DIV class="conv"><BR>
Vilnius the Small looks at you impatiently, expecting more. <BR>
Vilnius the Small looks at you impatiently, expecting more. <BR>

<SPAN class="npctalk">Vilnius the Small says 'You do good work, Soandso .  Here is another trinket for your trouble, you should be able to make use of it.  Malta still hasn't made it back yet, and I have one more order to fill, if you're willing.  This one should be easy.  My sword collector has decided he wants rapiers now, of all things.  He has asked for an Eyerazzia, a Martune Rapier, a Burning Rapier, and a well balanced rapier. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="expgain">You gain experience!!</SPAN><BR><BR>
You receive 31 gold from Vilnius the Small.<BR>
You receive 1 platinum from Vilnius the Small.<BR><BR>
</DIV>

Vilnius then gives you the <SPAN class="item">Cazic Quill</SPAN>.<BR><BR>

When I handed in my robes, I had a friend who had a Kedge robe hand his in first, and once he had completed the trade, I immediately handed in the other three robes (SMR, Ishva, Oracle).  Vilnius gave me the Cazic Quill, so this shows that the CQ CAN be multiquested as of October 2001.  Again, be careful; only players level 50+ should be involved with multiquesting, as anyone below 50 will have the robes POOF when they are handed in!<BR><BR>

<A name="gimpy"></A><DIV class="bighead">WHY THE QUEST IS GIMPY</DIV><BR><BR>

Anyone familiar with any of the other epic weapon quests will probably be surprised that the Ragebringer quest is so simple.  You have to kill all of 1 difficult mob (the General), and a handful of single-group mobs (Renux, the Coercer, the Ishva Mal, the Oracle of K'Arnon, the Ghoul Arch Magus), pickpocket two items, and run around a lot.<BR><BR>

Originally, the Ragebringer quest was far more involved.  You had to do the following (assuming you didn't know any spoilers about the quest):<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Lendel and Gaffin Deeppockets, the Halfling rogue guildmaster and his brother, will occasionally have a conversation where they mention Stanos.  The idea was that you'd overhear the conversation, and ask Lendel about Stanos.  He'd tell you about Stanos, and then suggest you go find him in the Karanas.  I think the idea there is to ask people in the Karanas about Stanos, and eventually find Vilnius.
<LI>Vilnius gives you a task to find Malka Rale in the Qeynos Aqueduct System.
<LI>Go to the QAS and talk to Malka.  She gives you Stanos' Pouch.
<LI>You give Stanos' Pouch to Vilnius.  He tells you that he needs you to do something for him: collect four swords - Painbringer (rare drop from Kobold Champion in Sol B), Fleshripper (rare drop from Kobold King in Sol B), a Mithril Two-Handed Sword (rare drop from the froglok king in Lower Guk), and a Gigantic Zweihander (Karg Icebear in Everfrost).  Turn in the swords to Vilnius, and he gives you the Jagged Diamond Dagger as payment.
<LI>Vilnius then asks another task of you: collect four robes (the four mentioned above).  For these, he gives you the Cazic Quill, another dagger.
<LI>He then asks one last task: collect four rapiers - a Martune Rapier (rare drop from Scorn Banshees in the Plane of Hate), an Eyerazzia (uncommon drop from Scarelings in the Plane of Fear), a Well-Balanced Rapier (purchasable from the Shady Swashbuckler in East Commonlands), and the Burning Rapier, which itself involves a long quest that will take at least 6-7 hours to do.  For the rapiers, he gives you back Stanos' Pouch, and tells you to take it to Anson McBale in Highpass.
<LI>Give the pouch to Anson, and Stanos shows up.  Talk to Stanos and he gives you the quest to recover the stained parchment pieces from Founy and Tani.
<LI>Get the parchment pieces, give them to Stanos, and go through the translation rigmarole above, kill Renux, get the Sealed Box, and kill the General for his Pouch.  At this point, you'd have the Jagged Diamond Dagger, the Cazic Quill, and the General's Pouch, and trade them in to Stanos for Ragebringer.
</OL>

The quest was gimped in the following ways:<BR>

<OL>
<LI>You don't need to interact with the Deeppockets at all.
<LI>Renux, a mob you are REQUIRED to kill to complete the quest, ALWAYS drops the Jagged Diamond Dagger.  As a result, you do not need to collect the four swords for Vilnius.
<LI>Stanos can be spawned by saying to Anson, "I need to see Stanos", which means that not only do you not have to collect the four rapiers, you don't even need to see Malka Rale.  Hell, you don't need Stanos' Pouch AT ALL.
<LI>General V`ghera, up until spring of 2001, used to *ALWAYS* drop a Cazic Quill, which meant that you didn't have to collect the robes, either!  Now, he only drops it rarely (about 1 in 10 is the commonly-tossed around figure), so if you're lucky you won't need to collect the robes, but most people do.
<LI>Even if you do need to get the robes, the ones you need are all tradeable (which means you can just BUY them, instead of having to bother camping for them) except for the Kedge robe, but that hardly matters, because you can multiquest the Kedge Robe.
<LI>The Robe of the Kedge was originally only available from Phinigel, but they made that robe (AND the Ishva Robe) drop from the Coercer in Kithicor, so you don't even need to bother with Splitpaw or Kedge Keep.
</OL>

Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but Ragebringer is by far the most common epic weapon because the quest was gimped so heavily.  Verant will never change it back to full-strength, however, because so many rogues who haven't completed the quest would bitch insanely about the facts that 1) it's been this way for over two years, and 2) it's unfair that a whole bunch of people got to do the easy version just because they were able to do it first.<BR><BR>
