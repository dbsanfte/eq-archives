			<br><br>

			My favorite films of all time are the Star Wars movies.  (Oh, that's original.)  I don't rank the five, because there's really no reason to; they all complement each other.   It's one long story; it wouldn't have been a great series if there'd only been one great film in it.  (Okay, you pinheads, I like <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> the most.  Sheesh.  Yeah, Jar-Jar sucks, woo, can we move on now?)<br><br>

			(Keep in mind that the following "favorite films" are the ones I enjoy the most, not the ones I think are the greatest in terms of cinematic achievement.)<br><br>

			My favorite film of 2002 was, apparently, <B>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</B>, although in retrospect, a lot of the changes from the book lessened the film.  Nonetheless, it was still quite an achievement.  Up near the top was <B>Secretary</B>, a wonderful indie starring my former elementary-school classmate, <A href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Gyllenhaal,+Maggie">Maggie Gyllenhaal</A>.  Some other recommendations include <B>Gangs of New York</B>, <B>Adaptation</B>, <B>Minority Report</B>, and <B>8 Mile</B> in the Big Obvious Prestige Pics category; <B>The Transporter</B> and <B>The Bourne Identity</B> in the Mindless Action Flick category; and <B>Reign of Fire</B> and <B>Equilibrium</B> in the Christian Bale Is An Action Hero category.<P>

			My favorite film of 2001 was, surprise, <i>not</i> <b>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</b>.  I would mark it my second favorite.  The film I enjoyed the most, all year, was <b>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</b>.  I'm not going to justify it; I liked it, and if you think I suck for liking it, well then you can go <tt>[CENSORED BY ORDER OF THE UNITED NATIONS]</tt> a pack of goats.  Other films I liked: <b>Snatch</b>, <b>The Dish</b>, <b>Memento</b>, <b>Sexy Beast</b>, <b>Ocean's 11</b>, and <b>The Royal Tenenbaums</b>.<br><br>

			My favorite film of 2000 was <b>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</b>, followed closely by <b>Chicken Run</b>.  Otherwise, it was a pretty lousy year; other films I liked included <b>Almost Famous</b>, <b>X-Men</b>, <b>Bring It On</b> (yay cheerleader movies!), and even though it makes me a complete sellout, I enjoyed watching <b>The Grinch</b>, although in retrospect it was a commercialized bag of ass that, by being a huge overmarketed spectacle, completely missed the point of the original story.<br><br>

			My favorite film of 1999 was <b>South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut</b>.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone are the coolest people who ever lived, and those who voted for Phil Collins to win the Best Song Oscar that year should die a horrible flaming death involving livestock and, preferably, a colostomy bag.  Now, <b>South Park</b> is the movie I had the most fun watching, but if you want my opinion on the BEST movie (and I can tell you're dying to find out), that would be <b>American Beauty</b>, winner of five Academy Awards (Cinematography, Original Screenplay, Actor, Director, Picture).  Some other excellent films in 1999: <b>Being John Malkovich</b>, <b>Toy Story 2</b>, <b>Three Kings</b>, <b>Dogma</b>, <b>Election</b>, <b>Run Lola Run</b>, <b>Fight Club</b>, and, yes, <b>Galaxy Quest.</b><br><br>

			My favorite film of 1998 was <b>Shakespeare in Love</b>, a wonderful (fictional) period piece about Shakespeare himself.  (And, lo and behold, it won a bunch of Oscars.)  My runner-up was <b>Zero Effect</b>, written and directed by my fellow high school alumnus Jake Kasdan, son of noted Hollywood screenwriter and director Lawrence Kasdan.  I <i>did</i> like <b>Saving Private Ryan</b> quite a lot, but I didn't think it was especially groundbreaking.  It was an excellent war movie, but it trod entirely familiar ground.  Also, <b>Clay Pigeons</b> was a lot of fun, as was <b>Rush Hour</b>, effectively reviving the buddy-action-comedy genre.  (Cough, hack, gasp.)<br><br>

			My favorite film of 1997 was <b>L.A. Confidential</b>.  Indeed, it's my favorite film of the entire 1990s.  It's a 50's-era L.A. crime drama, starring Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, and Russell Crowe.  A classic of modern American cinema, nominated for 9 Academy Awards, the best noir since <b>Chinatown</b>, etc.  It won two Oscars: Best Adapted Screenplay (Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson) and Best Supporting Actress (Kim Basinger).  Unfortunately, <b>Titanic</b> won best picture.  What a crying shame.
			<br><br>

			My favorite film of 1996 was <b>Primal Fear</b>, starring Richard Gere and Edward Norton.  It had the best ending of any film all year.  All right, all right, any film that <i>I</i> saw all year.  And mind you, I'm the kind of person who deliberately does NOT try to figure out the ending to a movie, and therefore I tend to enjoy movies more than people who boast, "Oh yeah, I figured it out in the first ten minutes."  (You know who you are :)<br><br>
			<img src="images/usual.jpg" style="float: right" alt="The Usual Suspects' lineup shot.  That's me on the left, heavily disguised as Kevin Pollak." width="337" height="226">

			My favorite film of 1995 was <b>The Usual Suspects</b>.  If you haven't seen it, do so.  The ending of <b>The Usual Suspects</b> is truly classic. It was nominated for two Oscars and won both of them. Kevin Spacey won Best Supporting Actor as cripple "Verbal" Kint, and Christopher McQuarrie won for Best Original Screenplay.<br><br>

			My favorite film of 1994 was <b>Shallow Grave</b>, starring future Obi-Wan Kenobi Ewan MacGregor. A very suspenseful, very well-made Scottish thriller. Worth seeing at any price.<br><br>

			Before 1994, I was too young to have seen enough movies (not to mention remember them all and understand them all) to have any further favorites.  I can tell you're absolutely broken up that the list ends here.  (Sob, wail, moan.)<br><br>

			Other favorite films of mine:<br><br>

			Since I was born: <b>Aliens</b>, <b>The Hunt for Red October</b>, <b>The Princess Bride</b>, <b>Se7en</b>, <b>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</b>, <b>Trading Places</b>, <b>Tron</b>, <b>True Romance</b>, <b>WarGames</b>.<br><br>

			Before I was born: <b>The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)</b>, <B>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</B>, <b>Casablanca</b>, <b>Chinatown</b>, <b>The Court Jester</b>, <b>Double Indemnity</b>, <b>Only Angels Have Wings</b>, <b>Patton</b>, <b>Rebecca</b>, <b>Singin' in the Rain</b>, <b>The Sting</b>, <b>Trouble in Paradise</b>.<br><br>

			I have also unilaterally determined that World War II commando movies are the greatest genre of all time (i.e. <b>Where Eagles Dare</b>, <b>Operation Crossbow</b>, <b>The Guns of Navarone</b>, <b>The Great Escape</b>, etc.)  Generally, I don't find actual war movies all that interesting (<b>Patton</b> being a notable exception).<br><br>

			If you managed to get this far (good job!) you'll be either bemused or frightened to learn that I've seen all 73 of the movies that won the Best Picture Oscar.<br><br>

			Books and other delusions.</span>
			<br><br>

			Naturally, I have all of the <i>Star Wars</i> novels, although they aren't exactly great literature.  (Among the Star Wars books, the Thrawn Trilogy books -- <i>Heir to the Empire</i>, <i>Dark Force Rising</i>, and <i>The Last Command</i> -- are my favorites.  However, Aaron Allston's <i>Wraith Squadron</i> series of novels are not only immensely entertaining, but hysterically funny -- I've rarely laughed so much reading a novel.)  So here's my favorite books and plays, in approximate order, Star Wars excluded.<br><br>

			My favorite single novel is Greg Egan's <I>Diaspora</I>.  He may not be predicting the real future, but I sure hope he is.  Other recommendable books of Egan's include <I>Quarantine</I> and <I>Distress</I>.  Egan's books focus heavily on nanotech and quantum physics; more technically-inclined readers will probably appreciate them, and those who dislike intricate descriptions of fictional quantum theories will probably not.<P>
			
			Also highly recommended are <I>Snow Crash</I>, <i>The Diamond Age</i>, and <I>Cryptonomicon</I>, by Neal Stephenson.  Sort of neo-cyberpunk, but with more of a social conscience.  Stephenson is a very fluid writer, and his words draw me in.<P>

			An excellent series for the hard SF fan is the Galactic Milieu series by Julian May.  This is actually two series; the Saga of Pliocene Exile and the Galactic Milieu Trilogy.  The Saga consists of four books: <i>The Many-Colored Land</i>, <i>The Golden Torc</i>, <i>The Nonborn King</i>, and <i>The Adversary</i>.  There is a two-part book called <i>Intervention</i> (which originally was released as one novel, but later released as two: <i>The Surveillance</i> and <i>The Metaconcert</i>), which gives background into the Milieu trilogy; and then the Galactic Milieu Trilogy itself, consisting of <i>Jack the Bodiless</i>, <i>Diamond Mask</i>, and <i>Magnificat</i>.  The Saga of Pliocene Exile is widely considered one of the best SF series ever written, and the Galactic Milieu less so.  Personally, I preferred the Milieu trilogy, but what the hell do I know?<P>

			Two more high recommendations in SF: Anything and everything by Lois McMaster Bujold, most notably the Miles Vorkosigan series of books.  I think the best way to start is by reading <I>The Warrior's Apprentice</I>, but really, all of Miles' adventures are highly entertaining.  The second recommendation is <I>A Deepness in the Sky</I> by Vernor Vinge, a book which gave me some comprehension of the vastness of reality.<P>

			In the realm of accessible mathematics is a book called <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach</i>, which (when it's all boiled down) is about a dozen different topics, intertwining math, music, art, computer science, genetics, strange loops, and neurobiology, among others.  It's intensely interesting (it won the Pulitzer Prize for its author, Douglas R. Hofstadter, in 1979), and I recommend it for anyone with half a brain.

			They add up to about 6,200 pages so far.  They rival Tolkien for depth, breadth, and sheer enjoyment.  I recommend them to anyone who enjoys fantasy in any capacity.  (Among them, my favorite is the first book.) Go <a href="http://www.linuxmafia.com/jordan/" target="_top">here</a> for more Wheel of Time miscellany.<br><br>
			
			Speaking of Tolkien, if you haven't read <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, you're out of your mind.  For those interested in the history of Middle-Earth, <i>The Silmarillion</i> is fascinating.<br><br>

			Here are the rest of my favorites, in no particular order.

			<ul>
			<li><i>Catch-22</i>, by Joseph Heller.  Surrealism in World War II.
			<li>"Arcadia," by Tom Stoppard.  He also wrote "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead" and "Hapgood," among others.
			<li><i>Einstein's Universe</i>, by Nigel Calder.  It explains Einstein's theories of special and general relativity in a way that even a braindead chimp could understand, while managing to not be pedantic or condescending.  (The book, not the chimp.)
			<li>"The Glass Menagerie," by Tennesee Williams.  Heartbreaking.
			<li><i>Hyperion</i>, by Dan Simmons.  This is easily one of the best hard SF novels I've ever read, and one of the most emotionally involving.  It's really one big long story broken into two books -- the second is <I>The Fall of Hyperion</I>.
			<li><i>Neuromancer</i>, by William Gibson.  Enough said.
			<li><i>The Prince</i>, by Niccolo Machiavelli.  You'll never look at politicians the same way again, if you could actually stand to look at them in the first place.
			<li><i>The Demolished Man</i> and <i>The Stars My Destination</i>, by Alfred Bester. Two classics of science fiction literature.
			<li>Anything by Tom Clancy, specifically <i>The Cardinal of the Kremlin</i>, <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>, and <i>The Sum of All Fears</i>.  All his stuff is good (as in, readable and entertaining, if clichéd and schlocky), but those three especially.
			<li>And, of course, the <i>Principia Discordia</i>, by Malaclypse the Elder.  If you don't know what it is, you probably aren't cleared for it.  Speaking of which, you should also read everything Robert Anton Wilson ever wrote, including the <i>Illuminatus!</i> trilogy, the <i>Schrodinger's Cat</i> trilogy, and, well, everything else.  <i>Foucault's Pendulum</i> by Umberto Eco, too.
			</ul>

			Someone once suggested that I take some biz/econ classes (or, as fellow Discordian <tt>[CLASSIFIED BY ORDER OF GORDON MATTHEW SUMNER]</tt> likes to call them, "Communist lies"), and I almost did, until I realized that our economy is a circular entity, based on the idea that the government can create money guaranteed by other money they've created.  This is why they can keep increasing ATM fees without ever providing any additional services.  It also explains General Relativity, but not very well.<br><br>

			<br><br>

			I watch a lot more TV than I used to, which was back when I watched a lot less TV than I used to before that.  The only three shows I watch are <b>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</b>, <b>Angel</b>, and the <B>Futurama</B> reruns on Cartoon Network (I usually forget to watch the new episodes, or what's left of them).  Unlike all the other melodramas on the WB and UPN, <B>Buffy</B> and <B>Angel</B> actually involve more than people having emotional and relationship problems.  Instead, they involve people having emotional and relationship problems and <b>SAVING THE WORLD FROM UNSPEAKABLE HORROR</b>.  <B>Buffy</B>'s going off the air at the end of this season, which is probably a good thing, as it's been slowly decaying for the last two seasons.<P>

			<a name="music"></a><span class="mediahead">Parte the Fourthe.<br>
			Musicians and such.</span>
			<br><br>

			Hey, what favorites list wouldn't be complete without my favorite musicians?  (By the way, congratulations on getting this far.  You must really be interested in me to read all this... or you're stalking me.  Either way, let's do lunch!)  My favorite artist is <b><a href="http://www.satriani.com" target="_top">Joe Satriani</a></b>, a guy you've never heard of who can do things with guitars you swore were impossible (and are actually illegal in several Eastern European countries).  Most critics rank him, as a guitar player, just below Hendrix and Clapton.  Personally, I like him better than either of them, but hey, there's no accounting for taste.  So what kind of music does he play?  Well, if you held a gun to my head and forced me to categorize it, I'd say, "Please don't kill me!  Please!  I have a wife and will someday have kids!"  After I stopped crying like a little girl, I'd probably say it was instrumental rock; most of the songs have no lyrics.  It varies from straight-ahead guitar rock to <i>very</i> odd experimental pieces that nonetheless still carry a good melody.  His softer tracks are some of the most emotional music I've ever heard.  For a general introduction to Satriani, the best album to get is <b>The Extremist (1992)</b>, which contains a good sampling of harder rock as well as slower pieces.  His latest album, <b>Strange Beautiful Music</b>, was released on 2002 July 25.<br><br>
			<a href="http://www.satriani.com" target="_top"><img src="images/sbm.jpg" style="float: right" width="166" height="166" alt="Strange Beautiful Music album cover"></a>

			On the other end of the music spectrum, I've got more mainstream tastes... listed below, in no particular order:<P>

			Red Hot Chili Peppers <b>Big Bad Voodoo Daddy</b> Stone Temple Pilots <b>Dave Matthews Band</b> Smashing Pumpkins  <b>Nine Inch Nails</b> John Williams  <b>Jimi Hendrix</b> Foo Fighters  <b>Steely Dan</b> Metallica  <b>Soundgarden</b> Aerosmith  <b>The Doors</b> Green Day  <b>Filter</b> Pearl Jam  <b>Elastica</b> Nirvana <b>Offspring</b> System of a Down <b>Blink-182</b><br><br>

			And I think Radiohead are the most overrated band in history.  Ha!  Put that in your pipe and smoke it!  Send flames about Radiohead to <a href="mailto:president@whitehouse.gov">radiohead@waggoner.com</a>.<br><br>

			I also enjoy many other different kinds of music, though if it can be classified as some primary subgenre of Rock 'n' Roll, it's more likely to be my taste.  The above bands/artists are my favorite individual groups (i.e. bands that have a lot of music that I like), but I'm also very fond of some jazz, a dash of blues, some swing, lots of big band, some golden oldies (50's stuff), some classic rock (60's and 70's), and even a little bit of 80's music (which is, unfortunately, its own genre). At this point I can't stand R&amp;B, most country, any rap after 1996 (except Busta Rhymes and, not at all surprisingly, Eminem), sitar music, or funeral dirges, except for Mozart's "Requiem for a Heavyweight."  Classical is, of course, one of my favorite categories, even though "classical" music as thought of by your typical slack-jawed yokel really reaches across several categories, which I am not quite clever enough to be able to remember, although I can tell Bach from Sousa.  My favorite <i>single</i> piece of classical music is Mozart's "Overture to the Marriage of Figaro," which is played prominently at the beginning of <b>Trading Places</b>, which is (even way down here at the bottom of the page) one of my favorite movies.
