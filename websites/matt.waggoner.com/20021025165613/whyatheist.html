			<span class="h2b">Why I'm an atheist</span><br><br>

			So, where to begin.  Perhaps first it might be wise to explain what an atheist is.  Or, more accurately, what I think an atheist is.  (This is long, but I promise, it's worth it!  Really!)<br><br>

			Simply put, an atheist is someone who does not believe in the existence of any gods.  This is not a perfectly accurate definition, however; it is the same that saying a Christian is someone who believes that Christ is the messiah.  Just as there are different kinds of Christians (Lutherans, Baptists, Episcopalians; Irish Catholics, Greek Orthodox, etc.), there are different kinds of atheists, although since there is no atheist "church," the differences are much more fluid and less categorizable than with Christianity.  Ultimately, there are two main categories of atheist.<br><br>

			One kind of atheist is the kind who actively believes that there are NOT any gods.  If you were to tell an atheist of this kind that God exists, they might say, "You are wrong."  These are typically known as "strong atheists" (which does not imply that they are mentally or physically stronger than other kinds of atheists; the word "strong" simply implies a more active form of belief).  A way to paraphrase this belief is that there CANNOT be any gods.<br><br>

			Another kind of atheist is the kind who simply lacks a belief in any gods.  If you were to tell an atheist of this kind that God exists, they might say, "You're free to believe that, but I see no reason to."  These are known as "weak atheists," since it is a more passive mode of belief.  Weak atheists lack a belief in gods the same way they lack a belief in invisible pink unicorns -- it's not that they specifically avoid believing in traditional religious deities, it's that they simply lack a belief in anything supernatural.<br><br>

			Granted, these are probably overly broad definitions, and you will find that there are atheists along a spectrum between these two types, and even atheists who don't fall on that spectrum at all.  But, typically, most atheists fall into or near one of these two categories.  (The word I use to describe someone who is NOT an atheist is "theist".  This does not include agnostics; the use of that word is covered <a href="agnostic.html">here</a>.)<br><br>

			I am a weak atheist.  The reason why I'm a weak atheist and not a strong atheist is really a matter of semantics.  Particularly, I think that it's a bit absurd to claim that something cannot exist, unless there is proof that it cannot exist.  I think that, by definition, gods COULD exist, but I have no reason to believe that they do.<br><br>

			No, I don't worship Satan.  I don't even believe he exists.  I don't kill babies, practice cannibalism, or support polygamy.  I'm a relatively average guy who just happens to not believe in gods.<br><br>

			But the real question is, why am I an atheist at all?  Why am I not a theist?  (Or an agnostic, for that matter?)<br><br>

			Growing up, my family was fairly non-religious.  I have no siblings, and my parents are still married after (as of now) 27 years.  My mother had grown up in a vaguely Jewish cultural mindset, except they celebrated Christmas and never actually went to services.  Her family moved all over the country when she was a child, and they never were part of any particular community until they settled in Salinas, CA when she was about ten years old.  My mom has mostly vague religious feelings -- she really would LIKE there to be justice in the afterlife, for all the bad people who do bad things.  My dad, on the other hand, grew up Baptist, going to church every Sunday for sixteen years.  Then he decided he'd had just about enough of that, and stopped going.  The idea of being religious is essentially boring to him; there's way too much other stuff to be having fun with.  Movies, books, TV, theater, history, culture, food -- you name it.  He's interested in religion in an intellectual sense, but as far as I've ever been able to tell, is not the least bit religious himself.  Whether he's an atheist or not is beside the point -- it's not important to him to categorize himself that way.  His mother is more or less the archetypical little old church lady who bakes pies, and is herself very strongly religious -- but she is also a very nonaggressive person, and doesn't proselytize.<br><br>

			So I grew up, in Los Angeles, with the generic American cultural idea of God.  Grandma never sermonized to me, and very occasionally I found myself attending Easter services with her or otherwise being exposed to religion.  But my parents never made any effort to inculcate me with any particularly <i>religious</i> values, and I grew up more or less believing that there <i>was</i> a God of some kind.  That is, when I thought about it; for the most part, the idea of God didn't come into my mind very much.<br><br>

			When I was thirteen, I was sitting in school one day between classes.  I had recently been mulling over the idea of God; it occurred to me that even with what Grandma had told me, and various sundry encounters with religion, the idea of God seemed somehow strange.  So as I sat in school, I pondered: is there a God?  After a relatively few minutes, I came to the conclusion that there wasn't any reason to believe in God (or, for that matter, any other gods).  Sure, there COULD be gods, but there wasn't really any reason to think so.  Content with my reasoning, I realized that I was an atheist, and it was good.  I went on my merry way.<br><br>

			That's why I am an atheist: There doesn't seem like any good reason to believe anything else.<br><br>
