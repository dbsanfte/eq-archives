THEY MAY TAKE A LONG TIME TO LOAD ON SLOW CONNECTIONS.</B>  And no, I will not reduce the size or number of graphics.  These are ULTIMATE, dammit!</SPAN><BR>However, each epic guide has a version with no images available, so if all you want is the text, they will load much faster.<BR>

			<SPAN class="secthead">GENERAL UPDATES</SPAN><BR><BR>

			This section is only for updates about the overall site.  For individual Guide updates, please check each Guide page.  As a result, this section is going to be pretty short, so don't go thinking that the site's not being updated. :)<BR><BR>

			<SPAN class="update">January 23rd, 2003 - Attack of the Name Highlights</SPAN> - I've totally revamped both guides.  I went through every entry and edited old text, but the more visible change is the fact that NPC names, zone names, item names, and spell names are highlighted in various colors, to make them easier to spot in each entry.  Not every instance is highlighted; usually only the first instance of each name.<BR>
			<SPAN class="update">January 12th, 2003 - Attack of the New Models</SPAN> - I finally got around to updating the Rogue guide with screenshots for all the NPCs that had gotten new models with the Luclin expansion.  I also redid the actual RB wielding/closeup screenshots.  I'll get to the Mage guide next.<BR>
			<SPAN class="update">July 11th, 2002 - Attack of the Credit Whores</SPAN> - I decided that in order to bring myself fame and fortune, I'm renaming the guides to include my main character's name: Rohane Fadesteel.  I play on Test Server.  So come find me and give me your accolades!  Mwa ha ha!<BR>
			<SPAN class="update">July 10th, 2002 - Attack of the Standards</SPAN> - I've finished updating the guides to be compliant with the HTML 4.01 and CSS2 standards.  Oh, that reminds me: Microsoft sucks.<BR>
		
			<BR>Updates to individual guides are listed on each guide page.<BR><BR>

			I hate sounding like a lawyer, but... This guide is Copyright &copy; 2001-2003 <A href="mailto:matt@waggoner.com">Matt Waggoner</A>.  All rights reserved.  The content and format of this page is owned by me, except for content owned by Sony Online Entertainment.  You may use portions of this page as allowed by fair use guidelines, but I do request the following:

			<UL>
			<LI>Please don't host entire copies of this page (or even large parts) on your own web server.  I don't mind if you download copies for personal use, or even host a copy on your personal web server for your own access, but please don't make copies like this available to the public.  The reason is that when I update this page, I can't trust that other people will quickly update their copies, which means that the web will contain multiple, conflicting copies of the Guide, which is bad.
			<LI>If you do want to use any of the images or text from this page according to fair use guidelines, please do so, but please credit the source (this page) and include a hyperlink to this page with the copied content.  It is not strictly necessary, but please do ask me before doing this, as I would like to keep track of who is using what.
			</UL>

			<SPAN class="secthead">ADMINISTRIVIA</SPAN><BR><BR>

			If you have ANY QUESTIONS about the guides; any questions about details not included in the guides; any suggestions for the guides; or any information to be included in the guides; please e-mail Matt Waggoner, the administrator, at <A href="mailto:matt@waggoner.com">matt@waggoner.com</A> with your questions or information.  Things to remember:

			<UL>
			<LI>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY WHICH GUIDE YOU ARE CONTRIBUTING TO!  I don't want to have to make assumptions about what quest you're talking about.
			<LI>BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE WITH ALL DATA.  I will do my best to include it and keep the guides up-to-date, but doing so is difficult if the data I receive aren't unambiguous, clear, and most of all, ACCURATE.
			</UL>

			<SPAN class="secthead">SCREENSHOTS</SPAN><BR><BR>

			If you do send screenshots, please send YOUR OWN.  I could go download screenshots from Illia's Everquest Beastiary all day long, but that would be rude. :)<BR><BR>

			Oh yeah... special thanks to <A href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com" target="_top">Illia's Everquest Beastiary</A> for offering up any pics I want to use to fill out the Guide ;)<BR><BR>

			If you have nice, clean screenshots of the mobs involved in the quest, they would be most appreciated.  I prefer that screenshots be fullscreen, with no HUD (i.e. hit F10 until all your little floating windows go away), with the mob centered and well-lit, and ideally with their name displayed (if you target the mob before taking the picture, the flashing white/blue name often will stand out better against certain backgrounds).  Daytime shots are preferable when possible.  Please send me the ORIGINAL .BMP FILE THAT EVERQUEST CREATES -- PKZIP it up if you can.  I'll do the editing, cropping, and JPEG conversion myself :) Send them to <A href="mailto:matt@waggoner.com">matt@waggoner.com</A>.<BR><BR>

			All screenshots not attributed to someone else, were therefore taken by me.<BR><BR>
