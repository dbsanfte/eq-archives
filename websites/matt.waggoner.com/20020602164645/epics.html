If you have ANY QUESTIONS about the guides; any questions about details not included in the guides; any suggestions for the guides; or any information to be included in the guides; please e-mail Matt Waggoner, the administrator, at <A HREF="mailto:matt@waggoner.com">matt@waggoner.com</A> with your questions or information.  Things to remember:

<UL>
<LI>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY WHICH GUIDE YOU ARE CONTRIBUTING TO!  I don't want to have to make assumptions about what quest you're talking about.
<LI>BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE WITH ALL DATA.  I will do my best to include it and keep the guides up-to-date, but doing so is difficult if the data I receive aren't unambiguous, clear, and most of all, ACCURATE.
</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="secthead">SCREENSHOTS</SPAN><BR><BR>

If you do send screenshots, please send YOUR OWN.  I could go download screenshots from Illia's Everquest Beastiary all day long, but that would be rude. :)<BR><BR>

Oh yeah... special thanks to <A HREF="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com">Illia's Everquest Beastiary</A> for offering up any pics I want to use to fill out the Guide ;)<BR><BR>

If you have nice, clean screenshots of the mobs involved in the quest, they would be most appreciated.  I prefer that screenshots be fullscreen, with no HUD (i.e. hit F10 until all your little floating windows go away), with the mob centered and well-lit, and ideally with their name displayed (if you target the mob before taking the picture, the flashing white/blue name often will stand out better against certain backgrounds).  Daytime shots are preferable when possible.  Please send me the ORIGINAL .BMP FILE THAT EVERQUEST CREATES -- PKZIP it up if you can.  I'll do the editing, cropping, and JPEG conversion myself :) Send them to <A HREF="mailto:matt@waggoner.com">matt@waggoner.com</A>.<BR><BR>

All screenshots not attributed to someone else, were taken by ME.<BR><BR>
