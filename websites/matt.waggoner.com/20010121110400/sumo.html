<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" size="+2">All About Sumo</FONT>
<P> 

So what's the deal with sumo, you ask?  Well, ever since I started learning about Japan's official national sport, I've been enthralled - it's great fun watching these huge guys smack into each other.
<P>

The basic rules of sumo are simple: Get the other guy to touch any part of his body except his feet to the ground, or get any part of him (including his feet) outside the 14-foot diameter circular ring.  (Yes, "any part" includes his hair.)
<P>

I won't go into massive detail about the sport here; there are other, better resources for learning about sumo.  The best, if you can find it (search in public libraries) is a book called <I>Grand Sumo</I>, which explains positively everything you ever could want to know about the sport.
<P>

Some beginner information, though: Don't call them sumo wrestlers.  Sumo's not much like anything resembling &quot;wrestling,&quot; at least not Greco-Roman-style wrestling, or WWF wrestling, or any of that nonsense.  Many modern martial arts are based on sumo, including judo and a few others (judo is the most closely related; others have diverged over the centuries).  You should call them <B>rikishi</B> or <B>sumotori</B>, both of which refer to the men who fight in sumo.  
<P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" size="+2">Rankings</FONT>
<P>

There are six fighting divisions within sumo; where a rikishi is located within them is based solely on past performance.  They are as follows, from the highest to the lowest:

<UL>
<LI><B>Makuuchi</B> or <B>makunouchi</B>
<LI><B>Joryu</B>
<LI><B>Makushita</B>
<LI><B>Sandanme</B>
<LI><B>Jonidan</B>
<LI><B>Jonokuchi</B>
</UL>

Only the top two divisions (makuuchi and joryu; rikishi in these divisions are known as <B>sekitori</B>) are salaried; in other words, when you are makushita or below, you earn no money from sumo.  (Rikishi at these low levels are taken care of, however; more on that later.)  Makuuchi and joryu would be equivalent to major league baseball; the lower divisions would be minor league (triple-A, double-A, etc.).
<P>

Except for makuuchi, within each division a rikishi is ranked with that division's name, and a number representing where in that division he stands; for example, Juryo-4 (the lower the number, the higher the rank, so Juryo-1 is higher than Juryo-4).  The makuuchi division, on the other hand, has five separate rankings, from highest to the lowest:

<UL>
<LI>Yokozuna
<LI>Ozeki
<LI>Sekiwake
<LI>Komusubi
<LI>Maegashira (with a number, from 1-16, added on the end)
</UL>

In addition, every wrestler, regardless of rank or division, is either ranked as East or West.  Being ranked East is considered slightly more prestigious than being West; they can be considered &quot;half-steps&quot; between ranks.  For example, a Maegashira-5E would be considered ranked above a Maegashira-5W, but below a Maegashira-4W.
<P>

Yokozuna are the grand champions of sumo, who have shown themselves to be exceptional fighters, with great skill and fighting spirit.  Only about one in 400 rikishi becomes yokozuna.  Just below them are the ozeki, who can be considered champions.  They have not yet proven themselves to be among the greatest fighters, but they are still very skilled.  The ranks of sekiwake and komusubi are prestigious as well, and are considered stepping stones to the higher ranks.  Even being a maegashira brings honor, since the lowliest Maegashira-16W is still light-years beyond anyone in the makushita or lower divisions.
<P>

Advancement within the rankings depends solely on your record in the previous tournament; if you had a winning record (more wins than losses) in your last tournament, you will certainly be promoted; with a losing record (fewer wins than losses), you will certainly be demoted.  More on this after tournaments are explained.
<P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" size="+2">Tournaments</FONT>
<P>

Sumo tournaments, called <B>basho</B>, take place six times per year:

<UL>
<LI>January - Hatsu Basho
<LI>March - Haru Basho
<LI>May - Natsu Basho
<LI>July - Nagoya Basho
<LI>September - Aki Basho
<LI>November - Kyushu Basho
</UL>

The January, May, and September basho are in Tokyo, at the Kokugikan, a large arena.  The other three basho are in other cities: Osaka, Nagoya, and Kyushu, in that order.  Otherwise, all the basho are the same.
<P>

Rikishi in the makuuchi and joryu divisions each fight 15 bouts per tournament, one bout per day; as such, each tournament lasts 15 days.  Rikishi in the lower divisions each fight 7 bouts.  A winning record, or <B>kachikoshi</B>, means 8-7 or better for sekitori and 4-3 or better for the lower divisions.  A losing record, or <B>makekoshi</B>, means 7-8 or worse for sekitori and 3-4 or worse for lower divisions.  
<P>

Now you have enough information to be able to watch a basho and tell what's going on; it helps of course if you speak Japanese or at least can see sumo; unfortunately, the basho are rarely televised outside of Asia.  Channel 62 (KIOS, or something like that) is broadcasting it here in Los Angeles; check your local stations for other markets.  There is also a wonderful magazine, called <I>Sumo World</I>, which comes out twelve times a year - once just before each basho, in a full-color magazine style, and then once again after each basho, in a shorter pamphlet form, to update subscribers on the results of the just-finished basho.  Sumo World can be found on the web at <A HREF="http://iac.co.jp/~sumowrld/">http://iac.co.jp/~sumowrld/</A>.
<P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" size="+2">More!  I want more!</FONT>
<P>

All right, you asked for it.  Forthwith, a whole bunch of random details in a fairly random order.
<P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" size="+2">Rankings, part deux</FONT>
<P>

There are altogether about 800 rikishi in sumo at any given time.  The makuuchi division consists of, at most, 40 rikishi (28-32 maegashira, 2-3 komusubi, 2-3 sekiwake, 2-3 ozeki, 2-3 yokozuna).  These numbers are not hard and fast; there have been as many as five yokozuna at once, and back in mid-1992, when the great <B>Chiyonofuji</B> retired, there were no yokozuna at all.
<P>

Lower divisions have different numbers, though they are usually fixed at some value or another.  Juryo has 13 ranks (for a total of 26 rikishi; remember, there's an East and West sub-ranking in each numerical rank).  The lower divisions have varying numbers, from 40 to nearly 300.
<P>

The ozeki and yokozuna ranks work differently from all other ranks.  Normally, after each basho, your rank is reevaluated by the ranking committee of the Sumo Association.  If you had a winning record, you rise in the ranks; if you had a losing record, you fall.  The number of wins or losses determines how far you move; in makuuchi, for example, if you had an 8-7 record in one basho, you would probably be promoted one or two places.  With a 12-3 record, you would be promoted at least 7 or 8 places.  To become an ozeki, you have to have shown a consistent level of performance, and had kachikoshi for at least two basho in a row.  Consversely, to be demoted from ozeki, you have to have had makekoshi for two basho in a row.  (However, if you make kachikoshi in the following basho, you will be promoted back to ozeki.)
<P>

Yokozuna, on the other hand, can never be demoted.  If a yokozuna starts performing badly for a period of time, he is expected to retire, so as to save face.  To become a yokozuna, you (generally) must have <B>yusho</B> (victory in the makuuchi basho) twice in a row as an ozeki, and an overall record for the last three basho of about 36-9.  You must also have displayed a strong fighting spirit, and possess some manner of dignity and other intangibles.  Then you can be promoted to yokozuna.  There have been only about seventy yokozuna in the history of modern sumo, which goes back about three hundred years.  (Sumo has only really been formalized recently, in this century; the rank of yokozuna was only made official back in the 1870s, and the six-basho-a-year system was started in 1954.  Before that, there were only a couple of tournaments a year during the 1930's, and then four basho a year until 1954.)
<P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua" size="+2">The Fight</FONT>
<P>

So how does a sumo match work, you ask?  When do they charge at each other?  The answer is, when they're ready.  Each match works as follows: the two rikishi, one of whom starts on the east side of the ring and one of whom starts on the west (this is not dependent on their rankings), climb into the ring.  Each moves to the north side of the ring, which is called the <B>dohyo</B>, and performs a small entering ceremony, which involves raising one leg high into the air and stamping it on the ground.  This is symbolic of driving evil spirits from the dohyo.
<P>

Then each washes his hands with some water from a bucket; the water is provided by either the last victor from that side, or if the last rikishi who fought on that side lost, then the water is provided by the rikishi who is scheduled to fight next on that side.  For the last match of the day, if the previous rikishi lost (and thus there is no next rikishi), someone who did not lose that day is picked randomly.  (Losing is considered unlucky, so you don't want to have your water given to you by someone who's unlucky for that day.)  After that, the rikishi take some salt from a bucket and toss it into the ring.  Then they enter and move to the center of the ring, where there are two white lines painted about three feet apart.  The rikishi must stay behind their line until the initial charge.
<P>

But that may not happen right away, and in fact, almost never does.  In the makuuchi division, rikishi have up to four minutes to prepare themselves for battle.  This usually involves crouching at the line, looking into the other rikishi's eyes, and seeing whether or not he looks ready.  If not, both rikishi typically stand back up and return to their corners for the water and salt again.  This will happen anywhere between five and fifteen times before the fight starts.  (Most matches, especially in makuuchi, always go to the full amount of time allotted.)
<P>

Once the time runs out, or before that if the rikishi both feel that they're ready, they charge.  The initial clash is called the <B>tachi-ai</B>, and is considered by some the most important part of the match - if you can gain the edge here, you have a much better chance of winning the match.
<P>

Sometimes one rikishi will begin the charge before the other is ready; this is called a false start, or <I>matta</I>, and rikishi are usually fined a certain amount of money every time they do this (50,000 yen for juryo, 100,000 yen for makuuchi).  It's so expensive for sekitori to do this that it seldom happens - only a couple of times per day, sometimes less, will there be a false start in the makuuchi division.  (Occasionally it happens more often.)  There is another form of false start, in which one or both of the rikishi fail to touch both fists to the dohyo surface before charging.  Even though both of them will be ready to fight, the referee (<B>gyoji</B>) or one of the judges (<B>shimpan</B>) may call for a restart.  There is no monetary penalty associated with this.
<P>

The lower divisions, which are not salaried (although they do receive some money for winning the yusho in their division), have much less time to warm up, since there are so many of them.  Typically it's less than a minute for the lowest divisions, and two or three as you move up.  Because time is so short, false starts are rare - usually when you start, it's because your time has run out, so you'd <I>better</I> be ready.
<P>

Once the rikishi have clashed, there are two styles of fighting: thrusting-and-slapping, and grappling.  The thrusting-and-slapping style involves open-handed pushing against the other rikishi's chest and face, trying to propel them out of the ring.  This is typically the style of the stronger, larger rikishi; smaller fighters typically try to go with grappling, which involves holding onto the other rikishi's belt (called a <B>mawashi</B>) or torso, and trying to drive him out of the ring.  Because rikishi are typically so large, they are also fairly inflexible, so once a rikishi has a hold on another's belt, it's difficult to break out.
<P>

At this point, there are 73 ways that one rikishi or the other can win the match.  70 of these are called <B>kimarite</B>, which are recognized as official methods for winning a match.  Two of the other ways are when one of the rikishi accidentally causes himself to lose (for example, when propelling the opponent out of the ring, the rikishi might accidentally step outside before the other one falls).  The final way is <B>fusensho</B>, which is when a rikishi does not show up for his scheduled bout (possibly because of injury and a withdrawal from the tournament).
<P>

The kimarite are not divided into groups, as such.  There are several distinct types, though; <B>dashi</B> (being forced out of the ring), <B>toshi</B> (being pushed down inside the ring), <B>nage</B> (throws), and others.  Only about twenty of the kimarite are common at all; the rest are seen rarely.  Some will only be seen once every several years!
<P>

The two most common kimarite are <B>yorikiri</B> (frontal force out, when one rikishi has the other by the mawashi and drives him out, step by step, of the ring) and <B>oshidashi</B> (frontal push out, when one rikishi pushes the other rikishi out of the ring, without breaking contact, but not using the belt; this is in contrast to <B>tsukidashi</B>, frontal thrust out, where the rikishi repeatedly slaps and pushes the other rikishi out, breaking contact after each impact).  There are other common kimarite, but they are too numerous to detail here.
<P>

As far as fighting rules go, they are simple.  Anything is allowed except for the following:

<UL>
<LI>Closed-fist punching (slapping is allowed)
<LI>Attacking the groin
<LI>Attacking the eyes
<LI>Grabbing the other rikishi's <B>mage</B> (hair or topknot)
<LI>Kicking (tripping is allowed)
</UL>

Beyond that, just about anything goes.

<LI><B>mawashi</B> - The belt that rikishi wear.  It is usually many yards long, and made of folded cloth or silk.
<LI><B>oicho-mage</B> - The stylish topknot that rikishi in the makuuchi and joryu divisions wear.  A rikishi's hair must be fairly long to be put into this elaborate style which was the standard hairstyle in old Imperial Japan.  In the eighteenth century Japan was &quot;modernized&quot; by its government, and these days the vast majority of Japanese men have very short hair.  New rikishi rarely have long enough hair to wear a mage (young up-and-comer Miyabiyama rose so fast, he spent more than a year in makuuchi before his hair was long enough for oicho-mage!); some of the older rikishi, who have started losing their hair (like Kotoinazuma, who at 37 was one of the oldest active rikishi (he has since retired)), have very minimal mage.  The mage is created by specially trained hairstylists who have been taught the rather arcane art of making mage (there is very little call for it outside of sumo and film; some actors need them for period pieces).  They use special combs and a hair oil called <B>bintsuke</B> to get the rikishi's hair to stay in place.  During most sumo matches, a rikishi's mage will come undone or at least loosen up a bit, which looks a bit silly when they bow at the end of the match, as their hair often flops around.  (Some rikishi, like Takanohana, rarely have their hair mussed; others, like Toki, almost invariably end up with their mage in disarray.)
