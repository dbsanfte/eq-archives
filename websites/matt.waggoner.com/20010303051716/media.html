			<P>

			My favorite films of all time are the Star Wars movies.  (Oh, that's original.)  I don't rank the four, because there's really no reason to; they all complement each other. It wouldn't have been a great series if there'd only been one great film in it.  (Okay, you pinheads, I like <I>The Empire Strikes Back</I> the most.  Sheesh.)
			<P>

			(Keep in mind that the following "favorite films" are the ones I enjoy the most, not the ones I think are the greatest in terms of cinematic achievement.)
			<P>

			My favorite films of 2000 (note that I saw a measly 47 movies in 2000, compared to my 1999 record of 80): <B>Chicken Run</B>; <B>Almost Famous</B>; <B>X-Men</B>; and <B>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</B>.  <B>CTHD</B> got an Oscar nom for Best Picture; I sure as hell hope it wins.
			<P>

			My favorite film of 1999, was <A HREF="http://www.southparkmovie.com"><B>South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut</B></A>.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone are the cooles people who ever lived.  (Phil Collins, while a decent artist and a nice guy, can go to hell.)  Now, <B>South Park</B> is the movie I had the most fun watching, but if you want my opinion on the BEST movie (and I can tell you're dying to find out), that would be <B>American Beauty</B>, winner of five Academy Awards (Cinematography, Original Screenplay, Actor, Director, Picture).  <FONT SIZE="-1">(Some other excellent films in 1999: <B>Being John Malkovich</B>, <B>Toy Story 2</B>, <B>Three Kings</B>, <B>Dogma</B>, <B>Election</B>, <B>Run Lola Run</B>, <B>Fight Club</B>, and, yes, <B>Galaxy Quest.</B>)</FONT>
			<P>

			My favorite film of 1998, in other words, the one I enjoyed the most, was <B>Shakespeare in Love</B>, a wonderful period piece about Shakespeare himself.  (And, lo and behold, it won a bunch of Oscars.)  My runner-up was <B>Zero Effect</B>, written and directed by my fellow Windward High School alumnus Jake Kasdan, son of noted Hollywood screenwriter and director Lawrence Kasdan.  The best way to describe it is comedy noir, I guess.  I <I>did</I> like <B>Saving Private Ryan</B> quite a lot, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I did <B>Zero Effect</B>.  Also, <B>Clay Pigeons</B> was a lot of fun, as was <B>Rush Hour</B>, effectively reviving the buddy-action-comedy genre.  (Cough, hack, gasp.)
			<P>

			My favorite film of 1997 was <B>L.A. Confidential</B>.  It's probably my favorite film of the entire 90's.  It's a 50's-era L.A. crime drama, starring Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, and Russell Crowe, among others.  A classic of modern American cinema.  It's the best noir film since <B>Chinatown</B>.  It's the movie <B>Mulholland Falls</B> wanted to be, and was nominated for 9 Academy Awards.  It won two: Best Adapted Screenplay (Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson) and Best Supporting Actress (Kim Basinger).  Unfortunately, <B>Titanic</B> won best picture.  What a crying shame.
			<P>

			My favorite film of 1996 was <B>Primal Fear</B>, starring Richard Gere and Edward Norton.  It had the best ending of any film all year.  All right, all right, any film that <I>I</I> saw all year.  And mind you, I'm the kind of person who deliberately does NOT try to figure out the ending to a movie, and therefore I tend to enjoy movies more than people who boast, "Oh yeah, I figured it out in the first ten minutes."  (You know who you are :)
			<P>
			<IMG ALIGN="right" src="images/usual.jpg" ALT="The Usual Suspects lineup shot.  That's me on the left." WIDTH="337" HEIGHT="226">

			My favorite film of 1995 was <B>The Usual Suspects</B>.  If you haven't seen it, do so.  The ending of <B>The Usual Suspects</B> is truly classic. It was nominated for two Oscars and won both of them. Kevin Spacey won Best Supporting Actor as cripple "Verbal" Kint, and Christopher McQuarrie won for Best Original Screenplay.
			<P>

			My favorite film of 1994 was <B>Shallow Grave</B>, starring future Obi-Wan Kenobi Ewan MacGregor. A very suspenseful, very well-made Scottish thriller. Worth seeing at any price.
			<P>

			Before 1994, I was too young to have seen enough movies (not to mention remember them all and understand them all) to have any further favorites.  I know you're absolutely broken up that the list ends here.  (Sob, wail, moan.)
			<P>

			Here's the rest of my favorite contemporary films, at least, those that have come out since I was born, in roughly alphabetical order.  These are the movies that, if I see that it's on, I will drop everything else I am doing and watch the movie.

			<UL>
			<LI><B>Aliens</B>

			<LI><B>Trading Places</B>
			<LI><B>Tron</B>
			<LI><B>True Romance</B>
			<LI><B>WarGames</B>
			</UL>

			Here's a list of my favorite older films, or those that came out before I was born.  Again, in roughly alpha order.

			<UL>
			<LI><B>The Adventures of Robin Hood (Errol Flynn et. al. -- HA ha ha!)</B>
			<LI><B>Casablanca</B>
			<LI><B>Chinatown</B>

			<LI><B>Rebecca</B>
			<LI><B>Singin' in the Rain</B>
			<LI><B>The Sting</B>
			<LI><B>Trouble in Paradise</B>
			</UL>

			I have also unilaterally determined that World War II commando movies are the greatest genre of all time (i.e. <B>Where Eagles Dare</B>, <B>Operation Crossbow</B>, <B>The Guns of Navarone</B>, and even <B>The Great Escape</B> sort of qualifies, etc.).

			This section is a list of actors that I think are cool for various reasons.  Usually it's 'cause they played some stupendous badass character in a movie.  The idea is to list actors who aren't incredibly popular or well-known, so you aren't going to see Michael Madsen or Cary Grant on the list.  This also isn't a list of my favorite actors, otherwise there'd be a big "Kevin Spacey" and nothing else.

			<UL>
			<LI><B>J.E. Freeman</B> - Eddie Dane in <B>Miller's Crossing</B>; Dr. Wren in <B>Alien Resurrection</B>.  The Dane is such a badass in Miller's Crossing that you can't help but like him, even if he is a jerk.
			<LI><B>Clancy Brown</B> - Sgt. Zim in <B>Starship Troopers</B>; Ellis West on "ER".  Sgt. Zim makes R. Lee Ermey look like Mr. Rogers.
			<LI><B>Michael Wincott</B> - Guy of Gisborne in <B>Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</B>; Top Dollar in <B>The Crow</B>.  He's usually a bad guy, and he positively reeks of evil.
			<LI><B>R. Lee Ermey</B> - A former real-life drill instructor, he's played them in a couple of movies (such as <B>Full Metal Jacket</B>) and, well, other characters in other movies.  He's a Badass, with a capital B.
			<LI><B>Vin Diesel</B> - A newcomer, recently seen in <B>Boiler Room</B> and <B>Pitch Black</B> (which opened on the same day).  He's big, buff, and badass.  Riddick (his character in <B>Pitch Black</B>) really knows how to rip shit up.

			Books and other delusions.</FONT>
			<P>

			I also love to read.  Naturally, I have all of the <I>Star Wars</I> novels, although they aren't exactly great literature.  So here's my favorite books and plays, in approximate order, Star Wars excluded.  (Among the Star Wars books, the Thrawn Trilogy books - <I>Heir to the Empire</I>, <I>Dark Force Rising</I>, and <I>The Last Command</I> - are my favorites.  However, Aaron Allston's <I>Wraith Squadron</I> series of novels are not only immensely entertaining, but hysterically funny -- I've never laughed so much reading a novel, let alone three.)<P>

			My favorite single book is <I>Snow Crash</I> by Neal Stephenson.  It's kind of a less depressing, surrealist extension of the things William Gibson wrote about in <I>Neuromancer</I> and his other cyberpunk novels.  It's also a lot more fun to read.  Also, if you get a chance, read <I>The Diamond Age</I>, also by Neal Stephenson.  It's not quite as good, but it's very VERY creative and very well-written.  I also just finished Stephenson's <I>Cryptonomicon</I>, which is not quite as consistently enjoyable as <I>Snow Crash</I> was the first time I read it, but it is nonetheless a great read.
			<P>

			Another strong series I can recommend (even though I've only read the first of them) is the <I>Dark Tower</I> series by Stephen King.  Everyone who's never read him will probably assume that all his books are horror.  Well, they aren't.  The first book in this series, called <I>The Gunslinger</I>, is much closer to fantasy ("reality-fantasy," I suppose) than anything else.  And King is such a facile writer that you get lost in the work almost immediately.  I highly recommend it.  Aw, hell, read everything he ever wrote.
			<P>

			Another good one is a book called <I>Gödel, Escher, Bach</I>, which (when it's all boiled down) is about number theory, but it intertwines the subjects of math, music, art, computer science, genetics, strange loops, and neurobiology, among others.  It's intensely interesting (it won the Pulitzer Prize for its author, Douglas R. Hofstadter, in 1979).  I recommend it for anyone with a mind for that sort of thing.

			They add up to about 6,200 pages of small print reading.  They rival Tolkien for depth, breadth, and sheer enjoyment.  I recommend them to anyone who enjoys fantasy in any capacity.  (Among them, my favorite is the first book.) Go <A HREF="http://www.linuxmafia.com/jordan/">here</A> for more Wheel of Time miscellany.<P>
			
			Speaking of Tolkien, director Peter Jackson is currently filming the Lord of the Rings trilogy as live-action films.  The first one (<B>The Fellowship of the Ring</B>) is set for release around Christmas 2001, followed by <B>The Two Towers</B> at Christmas 2002 and <B>The Return of the King</B> at Christmas 2003.  Should be interesting at least.  Hey, if you haven't read <I>The Hobbit</I> and <I>Lord of the Rings</I> to begin with, you're freaking insane.<P>

			Here are the rest of my favorites, in no particular order.

			<UL>
			<LI><I>Catch-22</I>, by Joseph Heller.  If you haven't read this book, READ IT NOW!  It's one of the funniest, most bizarre things I've ever read.  It's also, apparently, the only good book Heller ever wrote.
			<LI>"Arcadia," by Tom Stoppard.  This guy is a friggin' genius.  He also wrote "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead" and "Hapgood," among others.
			<LI><I>Einstein's Universe</I>, by Nigel Calder.  The only book I've ever seen that's able to explain Einstein's theories of special and general relativity in a way that even a braindead chimp could understand.
			<LI>"The Glass Menagerie," by Tennesee Williams.  Heartbreaking.
			<LI><I>Hyperion</I>, by Dan Simmons.  This is easily one of the best hard SF novels I've ever read, and one of the most emotionally involving, too.  Don't miss the sequel/conclusion, <I>The Fall of Hyperion</I>.  It's really one big long story, actually.
			<LI><I>Neuromancer</I>, by William Gibson.  Enough said.
			<LI><I>The Prince</I>, by Niccolo Machiavelli.  You'll never look at politicians the same way again.
			<LI><I>The Demolished Man</I> and <I>The Stars My Destination</I>, by Alfred Bester. Two classics of science fiction literature; if you've never read these, then you're missing a lot.
			<LI>Anything by Tom Clancy, specifically <I>The Cardinal of the Kremlin</I>, <I>The Hunt for Red October</I>, and <I>The Sum of All Fears</I>.  All his stuff is good, but those three especially.
			<LI>And, of course, the <I>Principia Discordia</I>, by Malaclypse the Elder.  If you don't know what it is, you probably aren't cleared for it.  Speaking of which, you should also read everything Robert Anton Wilson ever wrote, including the <I>Illuminatus!</I> trilogy, the <I>Schrodinger's Cat</I> trilogy, and, well, everything else.  <I>Foucault's Pendulum</I> by Umberto Eco, too.  Same vein.
			</UL>

			<P>
			Someone once suggested that I take some biz/econ classes (or, as fellow Discordian <PRE>[expletive deleted]</PRE> likes to call them, "Communist lies"), and I almost did, until I realized that our economy is a circular entity, based on the idea that the government can create money guaranteed by other money they've created.  This is why they can keep increasing ATM fees without ever providing any additional services.  It also explains General Relativity, but not very well.

			Television: The Temple of the Cathode Ray.</FONT>
			<P>

			I watch a lot more TV than I used to, which was back when I watched a lot less TV than I used to.  The only two shows I watch any more <B>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</B> and <B>Angel</B>.  (And, when it's on, <A HREF="sumo.html">sumo</A>.)  Buffy at least has excellent writing; it's a crime it hasn't won an Emmy or three yet.  Angel is quite possibly the moodiest show on television, but the atmosphere it sets is really... I don't even know of a word to describe it.  Creepy yet fulfilling.  And unlike all the other (melo)dramas on the WB, they actually involve more than people having emotional and relationship problems: they involve people having emotional and relationship problems and <B>KILLING VAMPIRES</B>.  And, until the untimely death of the tall bald one, I watched <B>Siskel & Ebert</B> regularly (as <A HREF="http://www.theonion.com">The Onion</A> proclaimed... "EBERT VICTORIOUS").

			<A NAME="music"></A><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Book Antiqua">Parte the Fourthe.<BR>
			Musicians and such.</FONT>
			<P>

			Hey, what favorites list wouldn't be complete without my favorite musicians?  (By the way, congratulations on getting this far.  You must really be interested in me to read all this... or you're stalking me.  Either way, let's do lunch!)  My number one favorite artist of all time is <B><A HREF="http://www.satriani.com">Joe Satriani</A></B>, a guy you've never heard of who can do things with guitars you swore were impossible (and are illegal in several Eastern European countries).  Most critics rank him, as a guitar player, just below Hendrix and Clapton.  Personally, I like him better than either of them, but hey, there's no accounting for taste.  So what kind of music does he play?  Rock and roll!  It varies from straight-ahead guitar rock to <I>very</I> odd experimental pieces that nonetheless still manage to carry a good melody.  His softer tracks are some of the most emotional music I've ever heard.  For a general introduction to Satriani, the best album to get is <B>The Extremist (1992)</B>, which contains a good sampling of harder rock as well as slower pieces.<P>
			<A HREF="http://www.satriani.com"><IMG ALIGN="right" src="images/engines.jpg" BORDER="0" ALT="Surfing With The Alien album cover" WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="166"></A>

			On the other end of the music spectrum, I've got more mainstream tastes... listed below (if the names aren't shaped like a tornado, then your browser is too narrow, and therefore you suck).  In no particular order:
			<P>

			<IMG SRC="images/x.png" height="1" width="100" ALT="pixel"><B>Red Hot Chili Peppers </B> Big Bad Voodoo Daddy<BR>
			<IMG SRC="images/x.png" height="1" width="117" ALT="pixel">Stone Temple Pilots <B> Dave Matthews Band</B><BR>

			<IMG SRC="images/x.png" height="1" width="122" ALT="pixel">Nirvana <B> Offspring</B><P>

			I also enjoy many other different kinds of music, though if it can be classified as some primary subgenre of Rock 'n' Roll, it's more likely to be my taste.  The above bands/artists are my favorite individual groups (i.e. bands that have a LOT of music that I like), but I'm also very fond of some jazz, a dash of blues, some swing, lots of big band ("Benny Goodman, you're my hero"), some golden oldies (50's stuff), some classic rock (60's and 70's), and even a little bit of 80's music (which is, unfortunately, its own genre). At this point I can't stand R&amp;B, most country, any rap after 1996 (except Busta Rhymes and, not at all surprisingly, Eminem), sitar music, or funeral dirges, except for Mozart's "Requiem for a Heavyweight."  Classical is, of course, one of my favorite categories, even though "classical" music as thought of by your typical slack-jawed yokel really reaches across several categories, which I am not quite clever enough to be able to remember, although I can tell Bach from Sousa.  My favorite <I>single</I> piece of classical music is Mozart's "Overture to the Marriage of Figaro," which is played prominently at the beginning of <B>Trading Places</B>, which is (even way down here at the bottom of the page) one of my favorite movies.
