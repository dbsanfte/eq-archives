<span class="secthead">NOTES</span><br><br>

<span class="subhead">The Planes</span><br><br>

This isn't self-evident since some people simply don't know about it.  The Planes of Sky and Hate are not connected to any other zone through normal means; you cannot zone into them the same way you zone from Freeport to East Commonlands.  There is only one way to get to the Planes: the level 46 wizard spells "Alter Plane: Hate" and "Alter Plane: Sky".  These spells teleport the wizard and his group to the port-in house in the Plane of Hate, or the first island in the Plane of Sky.  Note that it uses up a reagant (a "Fulligrans Soulstone of Innoruuk" for Hate, and a "Cloudy Stone of Veeshan" for Sky) which each cost 125pp.<br><br>

<span class="subhead">Other Notes</span><br><br>

Some of the other epic quests (Cleric and Monk, for example) require you to do things in a certain order.  You must get item A, give it to mob B, which will cause mob C to spawn, who you kill for item D, and so on.  The magician epic has items that can all be acquired in ANY ORDER.  The only time that "order" matters is, as noted above, when you turn in the Element of Wind items, because this causes the Master of Elements to spawn.  (There are one or two instances with the Power of the Orb sub-sub-quest where you are "supposed" to talk to someone who gives you an item to give to someone else, but, these SHOULD BE optional.  Do them anyway!  It's epic, man!)<br><br>

Also, in the cases of items from the Plane of Hate and Plane of Sky, you need to be level 46 to even be teleported into those zones.  For your own safety, we recommend that you are at least level 47, and preferably 49 (as our level 49 pets are MUCH more powerful than our level 44 pets), before you enter the planes.<br><br>

As a result of this, it is impossible to complete the quest before level 46 (and since the result is a level 46 spell, even if you somehow managed to get it before you were level 46, you could not scribe the spell or summon the Orb anyway).  You can talk to most (if not all) of the quest NPCs, and turn in any items you DO acquire for the appropriate reward, but since you have to be 46 to use the spell (and you have to be 46 to go to Hate and Sky to get their corresponding items), there is little point in worrying about it until you are level 46.<br><br>

<span class="subhead">Some Terminology</span><br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>always drop</b> - This refers to items that will always drop when you kill the mob.  There are possibly some cases where the drop rate might be high but not 100%, but when I mark something as "always drop", it means that every time I've killed the mob, it's dropped the item.  More to the point, there are no recorded instances of the mob NOT dropping the item.  This doesn't mean that it won't happen, just that no one's yet seen it happen.
<li><b>common drop</b> - At least 20% of the time.  While one in five may not seem all that common, since most of the mobs here are rapid spawns, you'll end up with the item in short order assuming you camp the mob for a little while.
<li><b>semi-rare drop</b> - 10-20% of the time.
<li><b>rare drop</b> - 5-10% of the time.
<li><b>very rare drop</b> - less than 5% of the time.
</ul>

Keep in mind that these are GUIDELINES; since we don't have enough data to be positive about them, the terms are assigned to tbe best of our ability.<br><br>

<span class="subhead">Spawn Times</span><br><br>

All spawn times are in REAL TIME, NOT GAME TIME.  E.g., a spawn time of "1 day" means 1 regular real life Earth day, not one day in Norrath (which is 72 minutes in real life).<br><br>

<hr><br>

<a name="intro"></a><div class="bighead">- INTRODUCTION -</div><br><br>

The Magician epic quest reward is a level 46 spell, Summon Orb.  Once you receive the reward, you scribe the spell, which you then may use to SUMMON your epic weapon, the Orb of Mastery.  The nice side effect of this is that when you die, you may SUMMON ANOTHER EPIC WEAPON BEFORE YOU RETRIEVE YOUR CORPSE!  Plus, it doesn't require any reagents like malachite to summon, so you essentially get a free pet for 500 mana (not to mention a kickass primary slot weapon).<br><br>

<div class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Principia Soulmage of The Tribunal</div><br>

Here is a picture of Toulari Teufelhunden of Brell Serilis wielding the orb:<br><br>

<br>

The Orb's effect, Manifest Elements, is a right-clickable summon of a huge pet that has the appearance of an air pet (but it is NOT an air pet!).  The casting time is 18 seconds (according to one source; can anyone verify this, preferably WITH A STOPWATCH?).  The orb does NOT disappear when you summon the epic pet with it.  Reports indicate that the Orb does NOT act as a focus item for your pets, and since the other pets have differing resistances that can be greater than the epic pet's, there is still an occasional reason to use them.<br><br>

The epic pet looks like this:<br><br>

<br>
<div class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Vreminsk Valkyre of Innoruuk</div><br>

According to Chris Babb, the epic pet always hits for max 67, is always level 49, has a DD attack for 160 damage and a 6 second stun, has 2500hp and a 50 point damage shield.  If anyone else can confirm these numbers, that would be great.<br><br>

<br>

<a name="rundown"></a><div class="bighead">- QUEST RUNDOWN -</div><br><br>

To get the Orb of Mastery (or really, the Summon Orb spell), you turn in the four Elements to the Master of Elements in the Plane of Sky.  Each of the four Elements (Wind, Water, Earth, Fire) is itself a sub-quest, where you must turn in three or four items to an NPC, who will reward you with the corresponding element.  (Earth and Fire each require four items; Wind and Water each require three items, for 14 items total.)  All but three of the 14 items are simple drops from mobs; some high-level and rare, some lower-level and common.  Two of the 14 items are your lower-level focus items from the Temple of Solusek Ro.  The last item, the Power of the Orb, is an item for the Element of Fire sub-quest.  The Power of the Orb itself requires 3 sub-items to be traded in; each of those 3 sub-items needs either 3 or 4 items.  A tree diagram looks like this:<br><br>

The symbol preceding each item indicates whether or not:<br>
* = a level 60 magician could (probably) do it solo<br>
+ = it will require multiple people to get (i.e. not even a level 60 mage could safely do it solo)<br>

Do not confuse the "<b>POWER</b> of Water", "<b>POWER</b> of Earth", etc. with the "<b>ELEMENT</b> of Water", "<b>ELEMENT</b> of Earth", etc.  The "Power of" items are for the "Power of the Elements" sub-sub-quest of the Power of the Orb sub-quest, and the "Element of" items are the four items you turn in to the Master of Elements to GET YOUR EPIC QUEST REWARD.<br><br>

<b>A WARNING: DO NOT COMPLETE THE ELEMENT OF WIND QUEST UNTIL LAST OR YOU WILL POP THE MASTER OF THE ELEMENTS AND HE WILL DEPOP BEFORE YOU GET THE OTHER ELEMENTS DONE.</b>  This means that you should have completed and acquired the Element of Fire, Element of Earth, and Element of Water, BEFORE you go to the Plane of Sky and turn in your items for the Element of Wind.<br><br>

However, Dohpaz Xorbelbeeb of Prexus says that if you go to Kihun Solstin and say, "I want to see the master" and the Master of Elements will spawn.  Graccil Baldinghead of Tribunal confirms this to be true, as do several other people.<br><br>

<hr><br>

<a name="detail"></a><div class="bighead">- DETAILED STEPS -</div><br><br>

<a name="summonorb"></a><span class="secthead">Summon Orb (The Orb of Mastery)<br>(Plane of Sky: "Master of Elements", quest)</span><br><br>

Turn in the following four items:

<ul>
<li><a href="#elementoffire">Element of Fire</a>
<li><a href="#elementofearth">Element of Earth</a>
<li><a href="#elementofwater">Element of Water</a>
<li><a href="#elementofwind">Element of Wind</a>
</ul>

to the Master of Elements, a named air elemental in the Plane of Sky.  Each of the four Elements is a quest all its own, and they are detailed below.<br><br>

The Master of Elements spawns when you give Kihun Solstin, who is also in the Plane of Sky, the three items he needs in order to give you the Element of Wind, so be sure to turn in the items to Kihun Solstin LAST, when you are ready to complete the quest.  (Or, as is noted above, you can say to Kihun, "I want to see the master", and the Master of Elements will then spawn.)<br><br>

When you talk to the Master, the following conversation ensues (thanks to Balasarius NoxDominus of The Seventh Hammer for the text):<br><br>

<div class="conv">
You say, 'Hail, Master of Elements'<br><br>
<span class="npctalk">Master of Elements says 'I... am... the... Master... of... Elements.. Elements... Forgive... me. I am... unaccustomed.. to.. speaking.. this.. mortal... tongue.  Might.. you... be... the... One? </span><br><br>
You say, 'I am the One'<br><br>
<span class="npctalk">Master of Elements says 'Trilith... Magi'kot.. knelt.. before.. the.. orb.. in.. his.. his.. last.. few.. moments... of.. mortal.. life. He... too... believed.. that.. he.. had.. the.. power.. and.. balance.. needed.. to.. grasp... control.. of.. the.. elements.  He.. was.... flawed.  Coming.. to... me... is.. a.. matter.. of.. no.. small.. import.  Only.. only... one.. who.. is.. of.. balance.. and.. power... power.. may.. control.. the.. Orb.. of... Mastery.  Give.... give.. me.. the.. Elements.. you.. have... gathered.. and.. I.. shall.. see.. if.. you.. are.. ready.. ready.. to control.. the... Elements.. of... life.. life.. life. </span><br><br>
</div>

Hand the four Elements to the Master, and he says the following:<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="npctalk">Master of Elements says 'You... are.. balanced... and.. powerful.. for.. a.. mortal... Soandso ..... Soandso .  More.. so.. than.... Magi'kot.  But.... you.. are.. not.. yet.. ready.. to.. transcend.. transcend... this.. mortal.. coil.  Take.. take.. seize.. this.. Orb... for.. you.. are.. worthy.. of.. reward.. and.. with... the.. aid.. of... the... balance.. balance.. contained.. within.. the.. Orb.. you.. may.. yet.. reach.. the... ultimate... Mastery. </span><br><br>
</div>

At this point, he hands you the Summon: Orb of Mastery spell scroll.  Memorize it immediately, and then force a save to your character by trading 1 copper to someone, or camping out quickly, or gating!<br><br>

Once you memorize the spell, you can use it to summon the Orb of Mastery:<br><br>

<a name="elementoffire"></a><span class="secthead">Element of Fire<br>(Skyfire Mountains: Jennus Lyklobar, quest)</span><br><br>

<table class="npc"><tr><td></td></tr></table><br>

Jennus Lyklobar is a male gnome magician wandering the edge of the Skyfire Mountains.  I found him near coordinates (+1800, +5000), on the wall, walking north, but I've also seen him scaling the slopes of the mountain behind the entrance to Veeshan's Peak.  He wears a magenta-colored robe.<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Jennus Lyklobar'</span><br><br>
<span class="npctalk">Jennus Lyklobar says 'Hello and well met, Soandso ! A [race] like you is rare here..  Do you come seeking what I possess?  Fire, fire, fire and fire is mine!  I surround myself with fire, I bathe in fire, I consume fire, I am the Master of Fire!  Hahahaha, but I digress.  Have you come for the element of Fire, seeking to fall to the same fate as Trilith Magi'kot?</span><br><br>
<span class="pctalk">You say, 'I have come for the element of fire'</span><br><br>
<span class="npctalk">Jennus Lyklobar says 'The Element of Fire I can provide you, but you must prove you are able to contain its power.  Bring me the Torch of the Elements now kept by a doomed lord of merchants, the burning embers from a notable member of wurmkind who can be found a short journey from here and a blazing wand, which you  should be familiar with.  And you must surrender the tome Rykas gave you.  But I think you would be happier if you stayed with me and learned more of the beauty of the one true element, FIRE!  FIRE!  Hahahahahahah!</span><br>
</div><br>

Turn in the following four items to Jennus Lyklobar, and he will reward you with the Element of Fire:<br><br>

<ol>
<li>Torch of the Elements
<li>Blazing Wand
<li>Power of the Orb
<li>Burning Embers
</ol>

Once you turn in the four items, Jennus says (thanks to Senrye Talbanath of Drinal for the text):<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="npctalk">Jennus Lyklobar says 'I see that you are well versed in the ways of Fire.  Indeed, if you are as adept in the other, lesser elements, you may just sieze the Orb of Mastery after all, and avoid Magi'kot's fate.  Take this element, and guard  it well, for more trials are to come, I assure you.  Succeed and you shall  be remembered always!  Oh, and Soandso ?  Watch out for the puddles!  HAHAHAHAHAHA!</span><br><br>
<span class="expgain">You gain experience!!</span><br>
</div><br>

At this point he gives you the Element of Fire:<br><br>

<br>

<br>

<a name="torch"></a><span class="minorhead">+ Torch of the Elements<br>(City of Mist: "Neh`Ashiir", rare drop)</span><br>
<br>

<br>
<div class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Varia Darselai of The Tribunal</div><br>

Note that, according to various in-game story elements, Neh`Ashiir is supposed to be FEMALE, but the model used was that of a ghostly Iksar MALE.  As a result, "he" and "she" are used interchangeably here (mostly "he").  If anyone can get me a new screenshot of Neh`Ashiir now that the new character models have been added due to Luclin, that would be spiffy (assuming his/her model has changed).<br><br>

You need a rogue with a Pick Lock skill of 200 to get through a door in the rear of the City of Mist that leads to Neh'Ashiir's area, so don't forget to bring one.<br><br>

Uzz of Bristlebane sends the following info:<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="npctalk">I have seen Neh`Ashiir on lvl 55 and he is a Enchanter his PH is a Black Reaver that spawns in the top hut.  When the Reaver is killed another mob spawns in his place and it can be Neh`Ashiir or another Black Reaver if a Reaver then you need to kill him again until you get Neh`Ashiir to spawn.  Black Reaver can be up to lvl 52 and is totaly MR, FR and others i think too.</span><br><br>
</div>

Jeff (no surname? no game name? tsk tsk ;)) sends the following info:<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="npctalk">He spawns in the final hut in the Sky area of City of Mist.  I've killed him 6 times, no Torch so far.  I hear people have to kill him up to 10 to 15 times to get it.  His spawn time, along with all hte other Reaver-related mobs, is a few hours.  I don't know exactly how many, but it's too long to stay and wait for another with a full group without them getting too antsy to leave.<br><br>

He's harder than Lord Ghiosk, but a LOT easier than Rak'Ashiir, thank goodness.<br><br>

I took him out with 2 groups, levels 53-60, with no shaman or chanter to slow.  I think if I had just one group 55-60 with a shaman or enchanter I could have done it with that.  I never saw him cast any spells, but since we killed him very quickly, we could have missed his spells entirely.<br><br>

A tactic for killing him a lot that a good friend of mine told me (thanks Zandar!) is to bind on a safe spot on the Sky ramp, and then whenever you're ready to take him on, get a bunch of folks, get a CoH anchor, and gate and CoH them all up directly to him.  It makes it a LOT easier if you don't have to kill everything in the zone to get to him every time (which is what you have to do otherwise).</span><br><br>
</div>

According to Lzoril Oneiros of Tallon Zek, Neh`Ashiir can spawn after any black reaver kill in the upper house, so there isn't really a "spawn time" involved.<br><br>

Undertow is located in the Temple of Prexus inside Kedge Keep, which is north of Estrella's lair.  The Temple itself consists of two sections: the pews and the chapel.  The pews are the first part you will see, when you enter from the south.  The chapel is at the north end of the Temple, and rises high into the ceiling.  Undertow lives at the very very top of the chapel, so when you fight him, you may want to pull him down into the Chapel area to keep him from getting pushed into a wall and poofing.<br><br>

The Burning Embers are a confirmed drop off Nezekezena, Gylton (again confirmed by Zephermen Furycaster of Rodcet Nife), and now (thanks to Orko Soulblighter) Phurzikon, another named wurm in Burning Wood.<br><br>

Reports indicate that if you go to Nezekezena's spawn location (about (-450, -2550) in Burning Wood) and kill everything in sight, eventually Nez or his (her?) placeholders will start spawning with a cycle time of 90 seconds.  People have evidenced acquiring Burning Embers at a rate of 1 or 2 in a few hours' time with this method.  Phurzikon and Nezekezna both spawn on this spot, and they are both strong; sometimes Nez or Phurz will spawn two times in a row, so your group had better be strong enough to take them.<br><br>

Nezekezena, if not killed when she spawns, will wander sometimes along the east and south walls of the zone, so if you can't find her near her spawn, look there.  A tracker would definitely help.<br><br>

Phurzikon apparently spawns on the same spawn point as Nezekezena.<br><br>

Thanks to Kelston Bernstar for contributing info about Nezekezena and Phurzikon.<br><br>

Marthisdil of Prexus confirms that *BOTH* Nezekezena AND Phurzikon can drop the Burning Embers, and have, as of 2001-04-25.<br><br>

Kindir tells me that Nezekezena and Phurzikon also have another place where they can spawn in Burning Wood: At (+2450, +600).  It's the same deal as the other spawn point; 80-90 second spawn time with placeholders.  Zacatac of Bristlebane confirms this; he says that the actual loc is (+2700, +1000), but the info is otherwise correct.<br><br>

Apparently Gylton, another named wurm in the Burning Wood, can also drop the Burning Embers.  Barbel Tchitchaah of Karana says (edited for clarity :) ):<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="npctalk">About Gylton's spawn: I'm not sure of the exact loc.  This named wurm wanders near the Skyfire zone.  Once you kill him, either he spawns again or Entalon spawns (5 minutes after), and when you kill Entalon, either Entalon or Gylon spawns again.  I've never had many difficulties finding him, just kill a few mobs near Skyfire (just after the ruins, before the way to zone), and eventually you'll see him.  Of course, a tracker would be a great help.  Gylton hit for around 145-155 max, isn't always the same level.  I saw him be level 45, but lower sometimes too.  He's a warrior type wurm (huge hit range, very low aggro range, Ring of Scale faction), and I don't feel he's harder than a standard wurm of the same level.  About soloing him at level 49, I would say yes, you basically would use the same level spells I use when I see him: Earth pet to tank and root, Shock of Swords of course (never never never use fire based DDs, they will resist fire too much to be effective), but also the level 49 conjuration-based Rain of Swords, Gylton and wurms in general have low resists against it, so it's actually mana effective and a good way to kill him fast with SoS between waves (editor's note: Verant is considering fixing the rain spells so that one of the waves is not eaten up by your pet, so this may become an even more efficient spell!).  Just make sure you are at full mana and use a SoW potion before fighting and nuke all you can, you'll be fine :) If you got a druid to track, you can switch to snare kiting also, but beware of adds in this zone.  Make Gylton follow you near the Skyfire zone, because fighting in the forest can be very dangerous.</span><br><br>
</div>

Note that Gylton has been spotted as far east as (+3440, -2468).<br><br>

Jeremy Champlin, who plays on Bristlebane, however, has said that no mage he knows of has gotten the Burning Embers off Gylton; you're probably better off focusing on Nezekezena.<br><br>

<a name="powerorb"></a><span class="minorhead">* Power of the Orb<br>(Lake Rathe: "Rykas", quest)</span><br><br>

<table class="npc"><tr><td></td></tr></table><br>

Rykas can be found in Lake Rathetear, on the rocks at approximately (+950, -650).  He is a gnome wearing a bright yellow robe.  As far as I know, he never moves from his spawn area, and he's pretty much always there.  I showed up to find him in the middle of the game day (around 2pm game time) and he was sitting there with his earth pet.<br><br>

Note that Rykas, lately, has been found other places in the zone.  Apparently if you aggro him, he'll follow you until he kills you, or you leave the zone or lose aggro -- and he WON'T wander back to his spawn point!  He's been sighted by me at the South Karana zone, the Rathe Mountains zone, and a few other random spots besides his spawn point.  It's unknown whether you can deal with him, quest-wise, if he's not at his spawn point, but I assume you can.  If you feel up to it, have someone kite him back to his spawn point, or kill him so he respawns, and you can deal with him there.<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Rykas'</span><br><br>
<span class="npctalk">Rykas says 'Greetings Soandso , I am Rykas, chronicler of knowledge.  I have journeyed all throughout the lands of Norrath, and I have learned many tales of adventure from people I have encountered during my travels.  I have learned of legends known and unknown to most mortals. Are you in search of knowledge?</span><br><br>
<span class="pctalk">You say, 'I am in search of knowledge'</span><br><br>
<span class="npctalk">Rykas says 'A small task is needed if you wish to learn more.  Do you wish to learn the tale of Magi'kot? </span><br><br>
<span class="pctalk">You say, 'I wish to learn more'</span><br><br>
<span class="npctalk">Rykas says 'If you seek to learn the tale of Trilith Magi'kot, your journey shall begin in the Commonlands.  Search for Jahsohn Ak'sot and give him this token.  He will share some of the knowledge I have bestowed upon him, and point you further down your path to Mastery.  Bring me the Words of Mastery,  Power of the Elements, and the Words of Magi'kot....Then you shall learn more about the power of the orb.</span><br>
</div><br>

Rykas then gives you the Token of Mastery:<br><br>

<br>

Take the Token of Mastery to Jahsohn Aksot in the West Commonlands and give it to him (see the <a href="#magikotwords">Words of Magi'kot</a> entry below).<br><br>

At this point, acquire:

<li><a href="#wordsofmastery">Words of Magi'kot</a>
<li><a href="#powerelements">Power of the Elements</a>
<li><a href="#magikotwords">Words of Mastery</a>
</ul>

and give them to Rykas.  The order in which you give them does not matter; I gave them to him all at once, and it worked perfectly.  Upon doing so, he said:<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="npctalk">Rykas says 'I see that you have completed the quest I laid before you.  That speaks well of your dedication, yet you do not realize your journey has just begun. Study this tome.</span><br><br>
<span class="expgain">You gain experience!!</span><br>
</div><br>

Rykas then rewards you with the Power of the Orb, a scroll that you can read.  Immediately after he gave me the Power of the Orb, he despawned, and then he INSTANTLY respawned about 10 feet away.  This probably has something to do with game mechanics, and it doesn't affect the quest at all.<br><br>

<br>

If you read the book, the pages appear thus:<br><br>

<br>

The text reads:<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="expgain">
An elementalist's power comes from the Orb of Mastery.  The Elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water are contained within the orb.  The Master of Elements holds the Orb.<br><br>

Trilith Magi'kot presented himself to the Master of Elements and the Orb of Mastery.  The power of elements brought agony to his mind and body.  Magi'kot was not of Balance.<br><br>
Fire burned his eyes unto blindness, Wind put his mind into a spin, Earth entered his body and aged him like the mountains, and finally, Water washed his memories of mortal life away.<br><br>

Jahsohn Aksot is a human mage who is found wandering in the West Commonlands.  He is near the Kithicor zone border, either wandering along the road that leads south from the Kithicor border, or a little ways east, wandering through the trees.  If he has summoned a pet (he does not always do this) you can use Sense Summoned to find him.  Otherwise, bring a tracker, or just wander around until you see him.  He is wearing a bright blue robe.<br><br>

<a name="page1"></a><span class="smhead">* Torn Page of Magi'kot 1 (Kithicor Forest: "dread wolf", "dreaded wolf", "enraged dread wolf", always drop)</span><br><br>

<br>

Reports indicate that any of the dread wolves ("dread wolf", "dreaded wolf", "enraged dread wolf") in Kithicor at night, will drop this item.  Be careful; even a level 46 mage with his strongest pet can be overrun in seconds by himself.  You can probably do this part solo at 49 without too much difficulty, but for safety's sake, TAKE A GROUP WITH YOU ANYWAY.  I got my page 1 off an "enraged dread wolf", which was easy to kill once I was able to engage it near the West Commonlands zone border, without fear of random zombie troopers showing up to ruin my day.  Or rather, night.  I had the help of two warriors, a cleric, and a wizard, and we dispatched the enraged dread wolf easily.  Then a zombie trooper showed up, and my pet soloed it while the others took on a dread wolf that came out of nowhere!  Both the enraged dread wolf and the dread wolf dropped the Torn Page of Magi'kot 1.<br><br>

Senrye Talbanath of Drinal tells me that she and some friends went to Kithicor to get the Torn Page of Magi'kot 1.  They killed 5 dread wolves and 1 dreaded wolf, and none of them dropped the page; they also killed two enraged dread wolves, and both times the page dropped.  This may have been random chance, or it may be indicative of a change in the drop rates.  In either event, it's probably still more efficient to kill whatever wolves come your way.<br><br>

At level 39 I was on a guild raid into Unrest.  Nearly every mob in the zone conned blue to me, with the exception of some Festering Hags, and these puppies.  Get a group of high 30s/low 40s together, and you can clear out the entire Unrest basement single-handedly.  Of the handful of Tentacle Terrors we killed, at least 2 and maybe 3 of them dropped the page.  These nasties are usually found in the last room in the basement, where Garanel Rucksif (the ghost dwarf) spawns.  They aren't all that hard to kill, but you'll want a group, because TTs are casters, either shadow knight or necromancer class (though they didn't have any pets, and they didn't harm touch that I could tell).  They cast lifetap- and disease-based spells.<br><br>

Also please note that there are tentacle terrors in Najena, but the Najena TTs are much lower level AND THEY DO NOT DROP the Torn Page of Magi'kot 2.<br><br>

Somebody Who Didn't Bother To Leave His Name told me that "a dark terror", in the Unrest basement, can also drop the Torn Page 2.<br><br>

I spent about half of level 42 in the Frenzy camp in Lower Guk.  This was a good level to be there; most mobs conned low blue to even (a handful of yellows); the groups' members ranged anywhere from 38 to 52.  I was there for exp and loot, since I wasn't really aware of the fact that the page dropped from bloodthirsty ghouls (and, as it turns out, the Frenzied Ghoul itself can also drop the page).  If you are in this camp for even a couple of hours, you will with certainty see bloodthirsty ghouls, and probably at least one frenzied ghoul, and about one out of four of the BTs dropped page 3.  (I saw about four pages while I was there, not including the one that a party member looted accidentally 'cause he didn't know what it was.)  BTG's are strong warriors, but a normal Frenzy group can take them easily.  If you're building a party to go down there (and for some reason it's not already camped), BRING AN ENCHANTER.  The best room to camp in is the rectanguler anteroom just outside of the frenzied ghoul's room, since only a couple of weaker frogloks actually spawn in that room; you can actively pull from the surrounding rooms into it safely.<br><br>

Walnan tends to wander along the path from the Butcherblock docks, to near Kaladim.  When I found her, she was standing behind a tree just upslope of the road near the last dwarf guard hut before you reach Kaladim.  However she can be in the area north of the road near the docks.  Your best bet is to cast Sense Summoned in this area, which will hopefully lead you to Walnan's pet.  However, she does not always summon one, so you might need to find 20+ druid, 35+ bard, or ranger to track her for you.  Walnan is a female High Elf wearing a purple robe.<br><br>

<a name="powerearth"></a><span class="smhead">* Power of Earth<br>(Lesser Faydark: "a faerie guard", rare drop (?))</span><br><br>

<br>

If you've killed faerie guards for your Robe of the Elements quest, well, you know how they go.  I got lucky; some guildmates and I were in Lesser Faydark helping a druid guildmate camp Brownie Scouts for an epic quest item.  During a break in the spawns, I SoW-ran with my air pet over to the faerie village, and pulled the faerie guard who spawns east of the village (behind a tree).  One Shock of Swords, and two seconds being beat on by my pet, and the faerie dropped dead.  I guess I was lucky because she dropped both the Power of Earth (a black ball, looks like a black pearl or a Glowing Black Stone) and the Twice-Woven Cloak (for the RotE quest), so I was able to go complete the RotE yet again.<br><br>

Faerie guards are easy if they're green to you, since they will only come one at a time when you pull them.  They are typical warrior mobs, nothing out of the ordinary for their level (max 24).  Don't confuse them with Fairy Guards, who are not the same mob (I don't know whether they drop the same loot).<br><br>

Faeries have the Faerie faction, though as far as I know only faeries are sensitive to this faction, so once you kill a few faerie guards, you will be KOS to the faeries and will not be able to travel safely through their village.  However there don't appear to be any other places in Norrath where this faction comes into play.<br><br>

Two separate sources have stated that they camped the Faerie village, killing more or less everything in sight, upwards of 8 hours before getting their Power of Earth.  Damn, I'm lucky.<br><br>

(The "undead sprite guards" that were part of the LFay invasion earlier this year, apparently no longer exist -- so I'm removing the information about them.  Thanks to Arasmour Painecaster of Karana.)<br><br>

<a name="powerfire"></a><span class="smhead">* Power of Fire<br>(Sol A: "blazing elemental" rare drop, "lava elemental", common drop?)</span><br><br>

<br>

Boring but easy camp if you have your 39 pets or better, and even at 34 you SHOULD be able to do this solo although it will be more work.  I personally had to camp for about 3.5 hours to get the Power of Fire; lucky for me, it was 4 am and I was going to give up for the night after one last spawn, and lucky me, it had the Power of Fire.<br><br>

The Blazing Elementals spawn in the north part of Sol A, in a pit that has two false ceilings (rather, false floors in two other rooms) and a ramp that leads into another room where nothing spawns.  (If you have the EQ Atlas map of Sol A (http://www.eqatlas.com/solusekseyemap.html), the Blazing Elementals pit is marked at spot 3, and the unoccupied room is the small, perfectly square room just southwest of the "3".<br><br>

At first I camped in that room, waiting for the Blazing Elementals to spawn (they are on roughly a 19-minute spawn timer) and meanwhile pulling some of the surrounding goblins just to pass the time.  I even tried clearing out the entire circular area surrounding these rooms (everything north of -200 on the map), but that was too much effort.  I finally figured out that the simplest way to do it, was to sit in the Blazing Elemental pit ITSELF, and wait for the BEs to spawn.  They would immediately aggro on me, and my fire pet (sitting there waiting with me) would beat them to dust in a few seconds.  One of the reasons I did this was because I could simply sit there meditating, and I'd read a book, so I wasn't bored.  (Even killing green goblins over and over got tedious.)  The mobs would spawn, I'd move away a few steps, and my Jobaner would kill them.  The other reason was, given enough time, Blazing Elementals will cast a fire shield on themselves JUST LIKE YOUR FIRE PET, and their shield is JUST AS STRONG.  My level 38 fire pet (from my 44 spell) nearly died the first time it fought a Blazing Elemental, because of the fire shield it had (my pet hit so much it was beating ITSELF to death).  So I had to quickly sit, memorize Nullify Magic, and dispel the BE's fire shield.  Sure I probably could have just nuked it, but...<br><br>

If you sit in the BE pit itself, the BEs will aggro on you before they can shield themselves, and your pet will have absolutely no trouble disposing of them.  The BEs are level 25.  The only other threat is the Reckless Efreeti, who is level 28 and spawns near the back of the pit.  He is more or less a level 28 generic warrior mob, easily disposed of by my pet.  I only saw him once, near the end of my camp, and he had no fire shield, nor did he cast any spells.  My pet wiped him out in no time, solo.  He dropped the Platinum Armband.<br><br>

The upshot of all this is, the BE camp is boring as hell, yes, but the best solution is, sit in the BE pit with your fire pet guarding you, and get a good book and dig in.  I've heard stories of anywhere from a 20 minute camp to a 20 HOUR camp before getting the Power of Fire (which has the graphic of a red gem, just like a Ruby), but it's probably on average about a 4-5 hour camp.  Just stick with it and you'll get it.<br><br>

It is commonly considered as true that the lava elemental in the rear of Sol A (behind the gnome castle) drops the Power of Fire as its common loot, but I have not personally confirmed this.  If you are camping the blazing elementals, and want to deal with running over to see if the lava elemental has popped, feel free to do so.  Also, Dark Elf magicians or people who have bad faction with the gnomes in Sol A will have a difficult time doing this, which is probably why the Power of Fire drops off the BEs.<br><br>

Sumoner Deltorros of Bristlebane says that the Power of Fire is at best an uncommon drop off the lava elemental; at least, the PoF does NOT drop every time you kill the lava elemental.<br><br>

Bahmut Illuminarie of Ayonae Ro says that he killed the lava elemental 9 times before the Power of Fire dropped.<br><br>

Arasmour Painecaster of Karana says that the easiest way to camp the lava elemental is to kill the roamer in that room -- the static spawns are not PHes for the lava elemental.  If you are high enough level you should be able to solo the roamer without getting any adds from the static spawns.<br><br>

<a name="powerwater"></a><span class="smhead">* Power of Water<br>(Kaesora: "enraged ravener", "famished ravener", "hungered ravener", "ravener", common drop on all four mobs)</span><br><br>

<br>

Any of the various raveners in this zone can drop the Power of Water.  I got lucky.  I went to Kaesora by myself; there were one or two other people in the zone.  I levitated down the eastern drop from the entry room, summoned a pet, went linkdead, came back, summoned another pet, and was almost immediately attacked by a famished ravener.  My earth pet rooted it and I nuked it half to death; my pet finished it off.  The ravener dropped the Power of Water, and I immediately gated out.<br><br>

Kaesora is a dangerous dungeon, even at high levels, to visit yourself.  (I was foolish to do so; take a group with you!)  Raveners are found all over the dungeon, but they are not very common mobs; they are found mostly in the upper levels to the east of the entry room, and sometimes down in the Five Towers area where Xalgoz lives.  Raveners will drop the power of water rather frequently; one good night's session camping the dungeon for exp will almost certainly get you a Power of Water.<br><br>

<br>

Gypsy Dancers themselves are only level 25-26, but the room they primarily spawn in (the ballroom in Mistmoore) also contains lots of higher level mobs, usually in the low 30s.  If you have a group of 30+ people and can safely handle one mob at a time (either because you have a monk to pull or an enchanter to mez), then breaking in and camping the ballroom should be not too difficult.<br><br>

Note that Gypsy Musicians and Gypsy Ambassadors do NOT drop the Power of Wind.  ONLY Gypsy Dancers.<br><br>

Icemagi Vizax of Tarew Marr says that the gypsy dancers drop the Power of Wind *every time*.<br><br>

<a name="wordsofmastery"></a><span class="subhead">Words of Mastery<br>(Najena: Akksstaff, quest)</span><br><br>

<table class="npc"><tr><td></td></tr></table><br>

Akksstaff wanders in random places in Najena.  When I found him, he was literally standing at the zone border to the Lavastorm Mountains.  Reports have him in almost any spot in Najena; inside various rooms, in the dungeon cell with Linara Parlone, in the goblin caverns, etc.  He is a male Dark Elf wearing a hideous brownish-green robe.<br><br>

Kelston Bernstar reports that Akksstaff's spawn point is in the hallway that leads to Rathyl's and Linara's cells, and he will eventually wander.  Akksstaff can have a spawn time of (apparently) anywhere from a couple of hours up to THREE DAYS.  So don't kill him!  Akksstaff has also been seen spawning in Najena's room itself!<br><br>

For my part, I was in Lavastorm on my way to Nagafen's Lair, and I shouted, "Anyone heading to Najena, if you see Akksstaff, it's worth 20 platinum pieces."  A few minutes later, someone sent me a tell that Akksstaff was standing at the zone, so I rushed over there, talked with Akksstaff (below) and gave the lucky player his 20pp.<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Akksstaff'</span><br><br>

<span class="pctalk">You say, 'magi'</span><br><br>
<span class="npctalk">Akksstaff says 'Ah, that I can help you with.  Magi'kot was a powerful elementalist, able to control the power of the elements which surrounded him.  He was not able to fully master the elements when I was learning from him, but soon after my departure I heard rumours that he was going after the Orb of Mastery.  At the time, I did not feel he was ready to harness all the elements, but Magi'kot listened to no one.  He was in search of power beyond any held by a mortal.  Do you wish to hear more?</span><br><br>

When you're in your 20s, Najena is a good place to go for loot and exp.  It's a "doable" dungeon, meaning a single group of mid-to-high 20s (or even low 30s) can crawl through the dungeon, clearing it out room by room.  A single crawl, even if you kill every mob in the dungeon, is not likely to net you all four pages; I spent a good 5-6 hours there both at levels 40 and 46, killing literally every mob in the dungeon, before I gathered all four Pages.  Keep at it, and you'll get it.  Note that the Pages can drop off both the goblin magicians found in the northern caverns, as well as the Dark Elf magicians, and even a few of the named mobs in the zone.  I personally looted the Wind page off of Rathyl.  (Ualdail of Fennin Ro confirms that he looted the Water page off of Rathyl incarnate, who can spawn right after you kill Rathyl.)<br><br>

If you're higher level like I am (45+), it's relatively trivial to solo literally the entire zone.  Just run about killing everything you see, and eventually you'll get all the Pages.  You can even go to Najena's room, since the new spell Summon Companion allows us to pull our pet out of the pool near Najena's room once we're done killing her and her friends.<br><br>

The spawn time in this zone is around 18 minutes, and it will take about that long to hit all of the other spawns you need to hit.  These are:<br><br>

<ol>
<li>BoneCracker and the necromancers in his room (you only really need to hit this once, for the key that BoneCracker drops), plus the Ogre Captain (again, only once, for the key he drops).
<li>Trazdon and the magician[s] in his room.  (I don't know whether Trazdon is capable of dropping the Pages, because I only killed him once and he didn't drop them that time, so it's hard to tell.  But the magicians certainly do drop the pages, so it's worth a trip.)
<li>The magician at the front gate of the castle area (where the entry caverns end).
<li>The magician in the room behind her.
<li>The two magicians in the Crystal Room.
<li>The two necromancers and Drelzna (or her PH, another Necro) in Drelzna's room.  (As necromancers do not drop the pages, this is not strictly a necessary trip, though Drelzna does drop the key to Najena's room.  <b>Fun Fact:</b> Did you know that Drelzna used to drop Journeyman's Boots as her rare drop?)
<li>The three magicians in the antechamber outside Rathyl's room.
<li>Rathyl or his placeholder (a magician or various elementals) in Rathyl's room (and Rathyl reincarnate, if it spawns).
<li>The three goblin camps in the north caves.  One is in a cul-de-sac to the west; the other two are in rooms to the east and north.
</ol>

If you hit these spots in this order, you will sooner or later get all the Pages.  Be wary of other people camping the dungeon for exp and loot; don't run over their camps.  But do shout to the zone that you're looking for the Pages, and if people could please not loot them and tell you, that would be nice.  A friendly group of low-20's adventurers were camping Trazdon's room when one of the magicians there dropped the Water Page (the last one I needed); I gave one of them the 12 platinum I had earned in the 2 hours I spent trying to get the Water Page, and she was ecstatically thankful.<br><br>

You will need some keys to get around the dungeon.  The best order for this, is thus: Go to BoneCracker's room and kill him.  He will drop the "Dull Bone Key" (DBK).  Then go to the nearby Ogre Captain, and kill him, for he drops the "Shiny Metal Key" (SMK).  The SMK opens the cell outside Rathyl's room; the DBK opens Rathyl's room itself.  Kill Rathyl or his placeholders until Rathyl drops the "Bloodstained Key" (BSK) (this key is NORENT so if you go linkdead or camp, you will need to get it again).  The BSK opens the door to Drelzna's room.  Drelzna drops the "Golden Crescent Key" (GCK), but this only leads to Najena's room, and you don't really need to go there, so just stick the GCK in a bag and forget about it unless you really feel like killing Najena.  The GCK is also NORENT.  (The DBK and SMK are NOT NORENT, you can hang onto them forever, and probably should if you have to camp this place more than once.)<br><br>

Virtually nothing in this dungeon has more than 600 hit points or hits for more than 50 damage (except the Widowmistress, a high-30s dark elven rogue who is *incredibly* fast and *incredibly* dangerous, and spawns in the northwest corner of the dungeon, beyond all the goblin camps).  The magicians and necromancers will all have pets and will cast their appropriate class spells, but otherwise are trivial to kill at high level.  They can be difficult at lower levels, however (fighting 3 necros solo at 39 can get you killed if you aren't careful).  The named mobs are, as expected, somewhat more difficult, but not much.<br><br>

A quick summary of which pages dropped of what mobs in Najena, although I don't know whether there's any relationship between them:<br>

<ul>
<li>Water dropped off a magician in Trazdon's room.
<li>Wind dropped off Rathyl.
<li>Earth dropped off a magician in the main castle area, although I also saw several pages of Earth drop off the goblin magicians in the north caves.
<li>Fire dropped off a goblin magician in the north caves.  I believe I also saw fire drop off one of the dark elf magicians, but I saw it drop off the goblins at least 3 times.
</ul>

Nerobus of Tunare confirms that the Earth page can drop off the Dark Elf magicians, and I think it's reasonable to assume that any of the four pages can drop off any of the magicians, fire goblins, rathyl, etc. in Najena.<br><br>

The pages no longer drop in Cazic-Thule; the zone was revamped in early 2002 and is now a 50+ zone.  The mobs that used to be in CT are now outside, in the Feerrott, although Nerobus of Tunare says that the alligators no longer seem to drop the pages.  So, you probably have to go to Najena to get them, now.<br><br>

Kelston Bernstar tells me that he has never heard of the pages dropping off Trazdon or "a necromancer", but I still keep them in the list on the off chance that they have the pages in their loot table as a rare drop.<br><br>

Sumoner Deltorros of Bristlebane says that he looted the Torn Page of Mastery: Wind off of a darkboned skeleton.  Darkbone skeletons, in my experience, only spawn in the front area of Najena, before you enter the keep proper.<br><br>

Trezark S'Dious of Vazaelle confirms that darkboned skeletons can indeed drop the Torn Pages, albeit rarely.  He also says that since Najena is a magician, she MAY drop the pages, but he's never heard of it happening.  He also says that he once found a page on "Rathyl reincarnate", so killing Rathyl is worth the effort (as I said, I got my Wind page off Rathyl himself, and killing "Rathyl reincarnate" gives you a second shot at getting a page).<br><br>

Eliadan Starforge of Tunare also confirms that the darkboned skeletons can drop the Pages.  He got one off one of the darkbones in the room full of skeletons near Rathyl's room.<br><br>

Deke Everburn of Ayonae Ro says that the necromancer who guards the portal to the Plane of Fear, Cyndreela, can ALSO drop the Pages!  This seems incredibly unlikely.  Can someone confirm this, preferably with a screenshot of the item on her corpse?<br><br>

Tiblner is known to wander along the Firiona Vie cliffs, east of the city.  I have personally seen him standing at the north end of the bridge leading out of the Firiona Vie city area, but usually he wanders along the cliffs with his earth pet.  The last time I saw him, he was wandering at about (-2000, -900), a little ways north of the edge of the cliffs, walking east.  He is a male High Elf and wears a brown robe.  Characters who have bad faction with Firiona Vie factions need to be careful as there are numerous mobs (pilgrims and others) who wander the cliffs -- not to mention the regular aggressive mobs like drolvargs, drachnids, leeches, etc.<br><br>

<a name="shovel"></a><span class="minorhead">* Shovel of Ponz<br>(Temple of Solusek Ro: "Vira", quest)</span><br><br>

<br>

One of our focus item quests from the Temple of Solusek Ro.  Acquire:

<ol>
<li>a shovel from magicians in Najena or Alligators in Cazic-Thule;
<li>the toes of a hill giant from hill giants, or (more easily) vendors near hill giant areas;
<li>a gargoyle eye (from gargoyles or, again, vendors near places where people hunt gargoyles, like Mistmoore and the Ocean of Tears); and
<li>a ruby (there are now vendors in North Freeport who sell regular rubies).
</ol>

None of these four items are NODROP, although the Shovel of Ponz IS NODROP.<br><br>

<br>

Turn them in to Vira in the Temple of Solusek Ro to get the Shovel of Ponz.  Vira is upstairs, on the left side of the balcony surrounding the main hall (as you face the dais).<br><br>

You need good faction with the Temple of Solusek Ro to do this quest.  The simplest way to do this is to kill Shadowed Men.  Another way is to turn in Dervish Cutthroat rings to Ortallius in the Southern Desert of Ro.  A third way is to find Ssynthi, the renegade Shadowed Man (he is aligned with the Temple) in Mistmoore, and give him the flower found on the tomb inside the building he hides behind.  The fastest way is probably to kill Shadowed Men, since at 45+ you can easily pull them solo and kill them quickly.<br><br>

One of our focus item quests from the Temple of Solusek Ro.  Acquire:

<ol>
<li>a broom from magicians in Najena or Alligators in Cazic-Thule;
<li>the toes of a cyclops from cyclops, or (more easily) vendors near cyclops areas;
<li>a griffon feather (from griffons or, again, vendors near places where people hunt griffons, specifically North Karana); and
<li>a star ruby (gem vendors; the nearest one to the temple is in Freeport (or possibly Neriak, for people with the appropriate faction).  NOT a ruby, a star ruby; they are DIFFERENT GEMS.  Star rubies are much less expensive).
</ol>

None of these four items are NODROP, although the Broom of Trilon IS NODROP.<br><br>

Turn them in to Vira to get the Broom of Trilon.  (See the "Shovel of Ponz" sub-quest above for information on Vira and the Temple of Solusek Ro.)<br><br>

<div class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of <a href="http://www.magecompendium.com">The Mage Compendium</a></div><br>

<span class="smhead">UPDATE:</span> The Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth <b>*** NO LONGER DROPS OFF INNORUUK ***!</b>  It now drops off a new mob in the Plane of Hate, a mini-boss named Magi P`tasa.  We need details such as his HP, how much he hits for, and so on.  In other words, all the stuff that would go in the fields below.<br><br>

In a patch in January 2002, Verant said that they upped the drop rate for the Earth staff.  What that rate is, is unknown, but if they changed the rate enough to bother mentioning it, then it's probably a significant increase.<br><br>

Thanks to Bahmut Illuminarie of Ayonae Ro for some basic info about Magi P`tasa.<br><br>

Arkahn Tyr'Zhal of Ayonae Ro sent me the following info:<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="npctalk">Magi, like all mini bosses, is a semi-rare spawn with a placeholder on a 72 hour timer + or - 12 hours (60-84 hour spawn).  He spawns in 10 different spots:<br> 
2 in rev house<br>
2 on top floor in maestro's house<br>
2 with ashenbone drakes on first floor<br>
2 in inny's old lair<br>
2 on second floor of second floor church.<br><br> 

This explains why he can spawn a ton in a few hours, or can sometimes never spawn even if hate is cleared completely.  He is NOT always up after patches... but he has a very good chance of being up because he has about a 30% chance of spawning in 10 spots, but sometimes the spots could all be filled with phs (has happened before).  He has 32k hp, hits for max of 200-240 (depending on level of the spawn &gt;&gt; 54-56 &lt;&lt;, and he CAN be slowed, malosini'd and debuffed in many other ways.  He can be taken out with one full group if you are good and have a 60 shaman.<br><br>

Drop rates are as follows:<br>
30% chance of dropping the staff<br>
30% chance of dropping apothic robe<br>
40% chance of dropping apothic sleeves, pants, or crown<br>
50% chance of dropping apothic bracer, gloves, or boots<br><br>

so far he is known to drop up to 3 armor pieces at a time<br><br>

none of this info except spawn spots has been "verified" yet but i have done a lot of research about the magi :)<br><br></span>
</div>

An interesting note is that the "Ghoul Arch Magus" (or is it "Ghoul Archmagus"?) in Lower Guk used to be called the "Ghoul Arch Magi", until someone pointed out that "Magi" is the plural of "Magus".  I wonder of they'll fix Magi P`tasa to be "Magus P`tasa".  You can see him wielding the Earth Staff in the picture below.<br><br>

<a name="underfoot"></a><span class="minorhead">* Dirt of Underfoot<br>(Burning Wood: "Slixin Klex", rare drop)</span><br><br>

<br>
<div class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of <a href="http://www.magecompendium.com">The Mage Compendium</a></div><br>

Klex is a level 50 Iksar Skeleton warrior.  He has 11,000 hit points and hits for a max of 137 damage.  He is not particularly fast, he just takes a while to kill.  The easiest way to kill him is to partner with either a necromancer or a druid, and either fear-kite or regular kite.  Kiting with a druid is a little harder, because Klex will sometimes aggro on your pet instead of the druid (you should turn your pet's taunting off, to keep Klex following the druid around while your pet gets hundreds of free attacks from behind).  When Klex kills your pet, summon another one, cast your best Burnout spell on the pet, and send it after Klex.  If you're with a necro and the necro can constantly keep Klex feared, then you'll have an easy time; the downside is, Klex will probably wander past many other wandering mobs, who will aggro and attack you.  With a druid, you can have the druid run in a circle centered on you (meditating while your pet attacks Klex), so you don't have to go anywhere near mobs that spawn.  In either case, pull Klex out of the crater he spawns in (the glowing meteor crater in Burning Wood), or you'll end up dealing with a lot of wandering hornets.  The drop was common for a while, but appears to be rare now.  Expect to kill Klex a number of times.<br><br>

In a nutshell: Pull Klex out of the crater, to the south, where there is a large flat area with almost no wandering mobs.  Kite him there, or kill him outright if you have the proper group for it.<br><br>

Kelston Bernstar tells me that he killed Slixin Klex 11 times in a row recently, and the Dirt did not drop.  Apparently the Dirt has been nerfed back to its original extremely-rare drop state, instead of its relatively common state.  Sigh.  Another easy mob we have to kill over and over...<br><br>

Chard of Bertoxxulous tells me that it's possible to solo Slixin as a mage.  Basically you need to chaincast your pets, damage shield them, and have as much +INT and +mana gear as possible, so that you can survive.  Slixin has low magic resists and so an earth pet can keep him rooted while you med nearby.  Chard says it took him about 6 pets to kill Slixin.<br><br>

Phinigel is in the very bottom of this dungeon; you'll need a group just to get to him, and two 55+ groups to take him out safely (you're better off with 3 groups).  Kedge raids by high-level guilds usually end up clearing the zone anyway, so go on enough of these and Phinigel is your bitch.

<a name="rain"></a><span class="minorhead">* Rain of Karana<br>(East Karana: "Tarbul Earthstrider", always drop)</span><br><br>

<br>

Tarbul Earthstrider is a named Hill Giant found in the Eastern Planes of Karana.  He roams the large rocky hill in the southern half of EK.  He's a very common spawn; when we arrived to hunt him down, he was already wandering about.  We killed him easily (we were there for another purpose, so we had 2 groups of people together; several warriors, druids, rangers, a cleric, and me, a mage), and he dropped the Rain of Karana.  15 minutes later, he was running around again!<br><br>

He was level 48 both times we saw him, and took a lot of punishment, but he went down no problem.  Both times he dropped the Rain of Karana, so it probably will drop every time you kill him.<br><br>

Nintalten Legbiter adds, "Trabul [sic] Earthstrider is a piece of cake with a lvl 49 Earth pet and a lvl 44 cleric.  That's how I did it :)"  Apparently if your level 49 earth pet beats on Tarbul, and you have a cleric cast Complete Heal on your pet every so often, Tarbul will go down fairly quickly.  You'd probably want to fire shield and burnout your pet, to speed things up.<br><br>

According to Slaariel of Ayonae Ro, Tarbul apparently *does* have a placeholder: "a rogue lion".  Apparently Tarbul is the spawn at least 95% of the time, so I guess Tarbul is really the placeholder for the rogue lion :).<br><br>

HOWEVER, Theisovian Qithetal of Luclin tells me that the spawn rates have reversed -- Tarbul is apparently now about a 5% spawn, and the rogue lion is the 95% spawn.  This makes Tarbul more difficult, although it's not like any of the mobs on the hill are dangerous to a magician of epic-seeking level.  Remember that, like other hill giants in EK, Tarbul can get stuck underneath the hill.  If this happens, petition a guide and have them kill the offending giant (they may need to use their /find command several times to pick out which giant it is).  Can anyone confirm the reversal of spawn rates?<br><br>

When I went to take this screenshot, I was level 49.  I was also invisible and TARBUL WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE THROUGH INVIS.  I don't know if this will hold true at lower levels, but it did today!  I didn't stand there gawking at him, incidentally; I took the screenshot and then left, so even though he CONNED indifferent while I was invisible, I didn't test it by waiting for him to aggro.<br><br>

<a name="tears"></a><span class="minorhead">+ Tears of Erollisi<br>(Overthere: "Captain Rottgrime", always drop)</span><br><br>

<br>

I joined up with a group of people from various guilds who had banded together to get the good Captain dead, dead, dead, dead.  In fact, they got him four times, and the fourth time, the Tears of Erollisi went to me.  Killing the Captain isn't hard, you just need lots of tanks and clerics.  Casters who have pets can help, but I don't think any other spells will be useful against him.<br><br>

Pulling him from the outpost in the Overthere is difficult; the two times I was present, a dragoon was pulled along with him.  He is usually standing near the southeast corner of the Outpost, along with six undead marines, who are level 50.  You'll probably want a monk to feign pull the Captain, and it will be much easier to do at night when the dragoons are out on patrol (fewer things to aggro).  I don't know the exact method that was used however.<br><br>

You will take a Venril Sathir faction hit for killing Rottgrime; apparently it's a pretty sizable one, so be careful if you're used to being able to travel there (evil races and classes, for example).<br><br>

The following is the body of a post that came from a Monk message board, but the person who sent it to me (Kelston Bernstar of Requiem on The Tribunal) says he doesn't remember who posted it.<br><br>

<div class="conv">
<span class="npctalk">"Ok, most will never need to know this, but if one person finds it useful, it's not a waste of time.<br><br>

Part of the insanely hard magician epic quest involves killing Captain Rottgrime in the outpost in Overthere. He is a level 55 skeleton, and doesn't seem to be too tough to kill.<br><br>
 
The trick is pulling him. Capt. Rottgrime is surrounded by 6 or 8 skeletons, all blue to me at 52 (someone said lvl 50, but I'm not sure). Besides that, there is a damn hard 55 or so Golems guarding both side entrances, and 4 gargoyles, level 50-53 or so guarding the main entrance. And still, you have about 4 roaming DE goons, as well as General D'Veers who's tough as nails and a necro. Add to this the fact that most are KOS in the outpost, and it's not a pretty sight.<br><br>
 
The pull is actually not that hard. First off, you're probably going to want someone who is not KOS to pull him...Agnostic monks work nicely. My faction in the outpost was kindly, so I can roam freely. You need at least one other non kos person to help, and they dont' necessarily have to have FD. We had a troll warrior.<br><br>
 
Have your groups set up camp on the northwest wall, very near the outpost.  Very few roamers, and no goons seem to come up that way. We had 2 groups: 2 clerics, 2 magicians, 1 monk, 1 warrior, 2 necros, 1 druid, 1 shaman (turned out to be overkill), and an enchanter showed up a bit later.<br><br>
 
Get in to the outpost, and target rottgrime..stand as far back while still in shuriken range as possible. A great thing to have here is one of those nice snaring nets from Crystal Caverns. Have your lookout watch the golem on the far east side of the outpost, and when he is at his point closest to water, either cast snare net or chuck a shuriken at the captain, turn, and run like hell. If you happen to get stunned, use stone stance. Then run outside the outpost, well outside the gates, then FD. Those things hit hard, but never took more than a bubble or so, even with about 10 on my tail. Have your lookout/tagger run up to Rottgrim and start hailing him. 99% of the time, this will stop him, while everyone else walks back. Either /q to clear aggro, or have your mage CoTH you back, then run back up to capt, or have lookout pull him the rest of the way.<br><br>
 
Bang snap pow, easy kill, happy mage. We did it twice, 0 deaths. Faction is rough though...I went from kindly to indifferent in 4 kills (2 capt, 2 goons). And on that note, for some reason a goon always managed to find us and show up with the captain...not a big deal, except for the additional faction hit. The only other advice I can give is to know where the goons are; they leave the outpost at midnight and usually come back or despawn at 10am if memory serves. Try to time it when they are furthest away.<br><br>
 
I wrote this for one reason: I asked 3 people about pulling this, and they either said it was impossible to split all those guys, or said to have a cleric with a click stick handy. There are other tactics; some have bards kiting the stuff around and a tagger to pull rottgrime, etc..but this was so clean and fast, seems like a waste of time any other way."<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Crown of Elemental Mastery
<li>Elemental Binder
<li>Pegasus Feather Cloak
</ul>
<br><br>

...and he will reward you with the Element of Wind.<br><br>

Kihun is located in the Sky quest room, beneath the first island.  There is a teleporter on the island which will take you down into the quest room.  Remember that you will need a wizard to teleport you to the Plane of Sky, and the spell component they will need to cast the spell costs around 250 platinum, so it's not something any wizard can necessarily just do on a whim.<br><br>

When you talk to Kihun, the following conversation ensues (thanks to Balasarius NoxDominus of The Seventh Hammer for the text):<br><br>

<div class="conv">
You say, 'Hail, Kihun Solstin' <br><br>
<span class="npctalk">Kihun Solstin says 'So, you have made it this far.  I am Kihun Solstin, the Master of Wind.  I control the unfettered Element like none other.

When you hand in the three items he wants, he says the following:<br><br>

<div class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of <a href="http://www.magecompendium.com">The Mage Compendium</a></div><br>

This is a picture of the building on the 7th isle in the Plane of Sky.  You can probably make out a few of the drakes flying around above the island.  There are N kinds of mobs here: greater sphinxes, heartsbane drakes, fatestealer, windrider drakes, and undine spirits.  All of them have a chance of dropping a Crown of Elemental mastery, although the sphinxes and windrider drakes have the greatest chance.  Clearing the 7th isle will typically net 0-3 crowns, but it's random.<br><br>

<br>

The mobs on the 7th isle range from 55-60 or so.  The greater sphinxes will DEATHTOUCH every 45 seconds, so you're going to need a major raid party to even GET to the 7th isle, let alone clear it and get crowns.  The crowns, however, are NOT NODROP, which means that you can pray and hope that someone will have one for sale.  I wouldn't bet on it, though; people don't go to Sky much except to GET epic components for those who attend the raids, so it's unlikely that there'd be one just sitting around.<br><br>

<a name="binder"></a><span class="minorhead">* Elemental Binder<br>(The Hole: "an elemental warrior", common drop)</span><br><br>

<br>

Elemental warriors are found right at the zone entrance to the Hole.  If you go in with a group, you can hunt these guys fairly safely for a couple of hours and you're likely to get an Elemental Binder.  Binders are also NODROP and sell for 500-2000pp, depending on the server.  I got mine for 400pp from some druid who didn't know what it was.<br><br>

Quillmane is a rare spawn, but he can spawn anywhere in the zone.  Most commonly he is found in the interior of the zone, away from the zone walls, but he can be out there, too.  He wanders almost constantly, and is killed almost instantly by any who see him (because the cloak you need for the quest is All/All and has unlimited charges of Levitate...).  This sucks, but it means it takes some real effort to get the cloak.<br><br>

Because Quillmane spawns randomly and wanders, the best way to get the cloak is to go to South Karanas with as many high level rangers and druids as you can gather.  More than 5 would be overkill, since you want to be grouped with them all.  Basically, what you should do is summon your pet of choice, get a SoW, and then run around the zone killing anything that wanders.  Static spawns like the Aviaks at their tower or the Tesch Mas Gnolls outside splitpaw, need not be killed (Quillmane doesn't spawn there, and there will always be people camping the Aviaks and Gnolls anyway).  Anything else that wanders -- centaurs, wolves, lions, elephants, aviaks, gnolls, treants (although there is a faction issue there) -- is fair game.  You want five trackers with you because they can always home in on a mob and kill it, and they can do this constantly -- the instant something shows up on tracking, they will go after it and kill it.  And the reason you want to be grouped is, if someone in your group does see Quillmane and kills him, then you will be able to get to the corpse and loot it before it opens up and some ninjalooter steals your cloak!<br><br>

Even one high-level tracker with you can make this an easy enough camp.  (To put it another way, one tracker tracking and killing mobs, and Quillmane when he pops, is better than wandering about hoping to encounter Quillmane by yourself!)  If you have even one or two ranger or druid friends who can help, then your life will become immeasurably easier.<br><br>

Nevertheless, even with your entire guild scouring the zone for Quillmane, expect to spend at least several hours on getting the cloak.  If you're doing it solo, then may Mithaniel Marr protect your soul...<br><br>

<span class="npctalk">I have been working on the spawn cycles of Quillimane In South Karana lately and would like to share with my fellow EQ'ers what I have noted.   Quillimane seems to actually have placeholders as do most "named" mobs in everquest.  And in all actualality she seems to be the less rare of some of the "named" mobs.  Now it does appear there are atleast 2 different spawn cycles of the "named" mobs here.  Playing a tracker for 58 levels gives you a little insight into how this can work.  The following are are in Quillimanes spawn cycle,  any named gnoll, ie, shaman ren'rex, high shaman grisok,phido and lenrel do not kill brother drash, he is NOT in the cycle.  I am going to set up 3 spawn points the first spawn point 1 would be just south of the hermit, spawn point 2 will be north of the shadow men and finally spawn point 3 is west of paw, its very difficult to pin point any of these spawn points because as soon as anything spawns it starts moving immeidately.  I have been able to get Quillimane to spawn by running between these points and killing the "Named" spawns as they pop.  However Quillimane seems to only spawn at spawn point 1 from my experience, where she then starts moving towards paw where she is normally spotted and killed. I have killer her now maybe 15-20 times and have gotten the cloak once, sorry I am not a mage, however I am a druid who always runs out of batwings and loves the free wingless levitate effect.  There also seems to be many many named mobs in the zone which I am not totally sure if they are in on the cycle or not, seeing as I have my cloak I havent had time to research it anymore.  These named spawns would be cracktusk, grizzlenot, gnawfang, a rabid gnool,  mroon, some named druids and a barb that can drop a nice weight reduction bag.  I am not totally sure if any of these named ones are in the spawn cycle due to most of them being very rare,  I just stick to killing named gnolls and Quillimane will pop.  Good luck to everyone that needs this item, it is very rare and very nice for everyone to use.</span><br><br>
