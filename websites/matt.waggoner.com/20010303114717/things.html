			Restaurants, Food, & Good Eatin'.</FONT>
			<P>

			Herein I list all the best restaurants I've ever been to, as usual in no particular order.  Those on the list qualify not only for great food, but also for atmosphere and other factors.  (This list contains only restaurants that I have been to at least three times; otherwise it would be a much longer list.  But I won't vouch for places -- even Le Cirque -- if I've only been there once.)

			<LI><B>Asuka</B> (Westwood).  Sushi!  A combination sushi bar/restaurant, it's a lot of fun and really good food at a not-hideous price.  Okay, so it's a little more expensive than average, but the food is a LOT better than average, which justifies it.  If you can, sit with Yasu, a rather comedic sushi chef.
			<LI><B>Dan Tana's</B> (West Hollywood).  Incredibly good steak, plus some of the best Italian food this side of the Pyrenees.  There's a not-on-the-menu dish called Potatoes Beckerman that are right on par with Peter Luger's potatoes.  The staff is terrific and very efficient.  It's extremely small and extremely dark, but it's got a great atmosphere (80% nitrogen, 20% oxygen).
			<LI><B>Joe's</B> (Santa Monica).  We went there for Thanksgiving in 1997, and let me tell you, it was worth every penny.  My meal consisted of porcini mushroom ravioli, which was wonderful, followed by a great cream soup of some kind.  The entrée was roast beef and mashed potatoes, but as far as meat and potatoes goes, this is pretty much as good as it gets.  Dinner is somewhat expensive (we're talking $20-$30 per person, which is more than McDonald's, but isn't quite like buying, say, a car), but I've been told that lunch goes for around $10 per person, and it's just as good.
			<LI><B>Peter Luger's</B> (Brooklyn).  The best steak IN-THE-WORLD.  Period.  As well as an awesome sautéed potato dish and some creamed spinach that's good enough to kill for.
			<LI><B>Ruth's Chris Steak House</B> (Beverly Hills).  Okay, so for years I thought I didn't like the place, but that was just because I was a kid - kids hate dark, expensive restaurants.  However, now that I'm all grown up (DON'T SAY IT!), I have repealed my former judgment in favor of the Potatoes Lyonnaise.  (Not to mention the steak, slobber drool slurp.)
			<LI><B>Yujean Kang's</B> (Pasadena).  The best Chinese food I've had, and yes, I've been to China (Canton, specifically -- where do you think Cantonese cuisine comes from?).  Everything is just damn good, every time we go there, and we've been there at least a dozen times.
			</UL>

			Incidentally, if you consider yourself even a minor gourmet, you need a copy of the <I>2001 Zagat Survey of Los Angeles & So. California Restaurants</I>.  This book has it all.  (Granted, you might want a different version if you live in, say, New York, or somewhere else with enough good restaurants to merit the Zagats' effort. Those of you in the flyover zone (i.e. everything between the West Coast and the East Coast), you're SOL.)

			I'm heavily into computing; as I said earlier, my major at UCLA was Computer Science before they taped a degree to my back and threw me off campus.  Here's a few statements I'd like to make:<P>
			<UL>
			<LI><A HREF="http://www.kmfms.com">Fuck Microsoft.</A>
			<LI>Fuck Apple. (No link, just fuck them in general.)
			<LI><A HREF="http://www.2600.com">Fuck the MPAA.</A>
			<LI><A HREF="http://modernhumorist.com/mh/0004/propaganda/mp3.cfm">Fuck the RIAA.</A>
			</UL>

			If you have any sense at all, you are learning how to use Linux, [and | or] have it installed on your home machine.  What's that, you say?  What's Linux, you say?  It's what Windows would be like if Windows never crashed, only faster.  There's too many links to go into so I'll just say go <A HREF="http://www.linux.com">here</A>.  Also check out the <A HREF="advocacy.html">advocacy page</A> for more info on Free Software, Open Source, and why Microsoft needs to go fuck themselves.<P>

			I just (December '99) got a new Dell Dimension XPS T500 (P3-500/128MB/20GB).  Spiff-tastic.  I've also got my old Dell Dimension P200 (64MB/8.0GB, overclocked from 166 -- gee whiz, am I a genius or what?), called Goliath.  My first computer was an IBM PCJr. from, like 1986; in 1991 I got my first real computer, a solid old 386/16 called Gandhi that eventually caught on fire; whatever happened to non-violent protest?  Then I moved up to a 486DX2/66 called Crystal (December '93) that I gave to my mom, and I got Goliath in December '96.  I am fluent in PHP, HTML, C, C++, JavaScript, ASP/VBScript, and know some BASIC, some Java, a teensy bit of MIPS assembly, and am NOT learning Perl as you read this.  I do all my coding in gvim, a GUI vi editor (that's right, I use vi.  Go to hell, emacs scum!).
			<P>

			Careerwise, I'm working for a company called Neopets.com.  Basically it's a virtual pet site for 13-year olds.  Woo.
