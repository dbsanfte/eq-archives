<SPAN class="secthead">NOTES</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">The Planes</SPAN><BR><BR>

This isn't self-evident since some people simply don't know about it.  The Planes of Sky and Hate are not connected to any other zone through normal means; you cannot zone into them the same way you zone from Freeport to East Commonlands.  There is only one way to get to the Planes: the level 46 wizard spells <SPAN class="spell">Alter Plane: Hate</SPAN> and <SPAN class="spell">Alter Plane: Sky</SPAN>.  These spells teleport the wizard and his group to the port-in house in the Plane of Hate, or the first island in the Plane of Sky.  Note that each casting of either spell uses up a reagant (a <SPAN class="item">Fulligrans Soulstone of Innoruuk</SPAN> for Hate, which can be bought at a merchant in the cleric guild in Neriak, and a <SPAN class="item">Cloudy Stone of Veeshan</SPAN> for Sky) which be purchased on the third floor of the Erudin library (and also, as I understand, in the Plane of Knowledge, though I'm not sure where).  The Sky stone costs 125pp; the Hate stone was lowered to 55pp.<BR><BR>

Wizards can teleport into either plane from any other zone in the game, as far as I know (although South Ro is the usual starting point, since it's safe for anyone over level 30 and has both wizard and druid ports in close proximity).<BR><BR>

Also note that the Plane of Sky and the Plane of Air are two different planes.  Plane of Air is a zone in Planes of Power, is very high-level, and has absolutely nothing to do with this quest.  The Plane of Sky is the one you're interested in.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Other Notes</SPAN><BR><BR>

Some of the other epic quests (Cleric and Monk, for example) require you to do things in a certain order.  You must get item A, give it to mob B, which will cause mob C to spawn, who you kill for item D, and so on.  The magician epic has items that can all be acquired in ANY ORDER.  The only time that "order" matters is, as noted above, when you turn in the items to get the <SPAN class="item">Element of Wind</SPAN>, because this causes the <SPAN class="npc">Master of Elements</SPAN> to spawn.  (There are one or two instances with the <SPAN class="item">Power of the Orb</SPAN> sub-sub-quest where you are "supposed" to talk to someone who gives you an item to give to someone else, but, these SHOULD BE optional.  Do them anyway!  It's epic, man!)<BR><BR>

Also, in the cases of items from the <SPAN class="zone">Plane of Hate</SPAN> and <SPAN class="zone">Plane of Sky</SPAN>, you need to be level 46 to even be teleported into those zones.  For your own safety, I recommend that you are at least level 47, and preferably 49 (as our level 49 pets are MUCH more powerful than our level 44 pets), before you enter the planes.<BR><BR>

As a result of this, it is impossible<SUP>1</SUP> to complete the quest before level 46 (and since the result is a level 46 spell, even if you somehow managed to get it before you were level 46, you could not scribe the spell or summon the Orb anyway).  You can talk to most (if not all) of the quest NPCs, and turn in any items you DO acquire for the appropriate reward, but since you have to be 46 to use the spell (and you have to be 46 to go to Hate and Sky to get their corresponding items), there is little point in worrying about it until you are level 46.<BR><BR>

(<SUP>1</SUP> Except that it's possible to multiquest some parts of the epic, but we <B>REALLY</B> don't recommend it.)<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Some Terminology</SPAN><BR>

<UL>
<LI><B>always drop</B> - This refers to items that will always drop when you kill the mob.  There are possibly some cases where the drop rate might be high but not 100%, but when I mark something as "always drop", it means that every time I've killed the mob, it's dropped the item.  More to the point, there are no recorded instances of the mob NOT dropping the item.  This doesn't mean that it won't happen, just that no one's yet seen it happen.
<LI><B>common drop</B> - At least 20% of the time.  While one in five may not seem all that common, since most of the mobs here are rapid spawns, you'll end up with the item in short order assuming you camp the mob for a little while.
<LI><B>semi-rare drop</B> - 10-20% of the time.
<LI><B>rare drop</B> - 5-10% of the time.
<LI><B>very rare drop</B> - less than 5% of the time.
</UL>

Keep in mind that these are GUIDELINES; since we don't have enough data to be positive about them, the terms are assigned to tbe best of our ability.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="subhead">Spawn Times</SPAN><BR><BR>

All spawn times are in REAL TIME, NOT GAME TIME.  E.g., a spawn time of "1 day" means 1 regular real life Earth day, not one day in Norrath (which is 72 minutes in real life).<BR><BR>

<HR><BR>

<A name="intro"></A><DIV class="bighead">- INTRODUCTION -</DIV><BR><BR>

The Magician epic quest reward is a level 46 spell, <SPAN class="item">Spell: Summon Orb</SPAN>.  Once you receive the reward, you scribe the spell (<SPAN class="spell">Summon Orb</SPAN>), which you then may use to SUMMON your epic weapon, the <SPAN class="item">Orb of Mastery</SPAN>.  The nice side effect of this is that when you die, you may SUMMON ANOTHER EPIC WEAPON BEFORE YOU RETRIEVE YOUR CORPSE!  Plus, it doesn't require any reagents like malachite to summon, so you essentially get a free pet for 500 mana (not to mention a kickass primary slot weapon).<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="if">Type:</SPAN> 1H Blunt<BR>
<SPAN class="if">Damage/Delay:</SPAN> 20/30<BR>

Here is a close-up of the Orb itself:<BR><BR>

<BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Principia Soulmage of The Tribunal</DIV><BR>

Here is a picture of Toulari Teufelhunden of Brell Serilis wielding the Orb:<BR><BR>

<BR>

The Orb's effect, <SPAN class="spell">Manifest Elements</SPAN>, is a right-clickable summon of a huge pet that has the appearance of an air pet (but it is NOT an air pet!).  The Orb does NOT disappear when you summon the epic pet with it.  Reports indicate that the Orb does NOT act as a focus item for your pets, and since the other pets have differing resistances that can be greater than the epic pet's, there is still an occasional reason to use them; but for the most part, the epic pet outclasses all other mage pets.  This may not be true with the Planes of Power pets; if anyone has info on this, please let me know.<BR><BR>

Xalmat of Brell Serilis says that the casting time on <SPAN class="spell">Manifest Elements</SPAN> is 20 seconds, and you can't use it until you're level 50 (even though you can get the spell at 46, and summon the Orb, you can't actually get your epic pet until level 50).  He also says that because of the epic pet's level, it has trouble landing spells on level 61+ mobs, which are quite common in certain Planes of Power and Luclin zones.  He also says that the <SPAN class="item">Gloves of Dark Summoning</SPAN> act as a focus item for the epic pet, raising its level, melee damage, and DS strength, as long as you're wearing them when you summon it.  They drop in Vex Thal.<BR><BR>

Xalmat also sends a bunch of info on the PoP pets.  You can draw your own conclusions about how they compare to the epic pet:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="npctalk">
All Mage PoP pets are level 60. Gloves of Dark Summoning focus the PoP pets, which drop in Vex Thal.<P>

Ward of Xegony (61 air) has 3600 hp, regens approx 96hp/tic, quads for 83, procs the air elemental stun every 12 seconds, enrages at 10% health for 10 seconds. Due to its level it can land its proc on most PoP mobs. In straight out melee it outdamages epic and regens faster, but include procs and epic DS and epic wins. In many situations it tanks just as well or better than epic due to its high damage midigation.<P>

Servant of Marr (62 water) has about 3600 hp as well, regens slightly faster than Ward, quads for 81, procs water elemental DD, backstabs for 241, enrages at 10% health for 10 seconds, and CAN assassinate mobs that are level 46 or below. In backstab position it dramatically outdamages epic (including procs), but cannot tank at all.<P>

Child of Ro (63 fire) is a junk pet. It's the same as all the other 51+ fire pets.<P>

Rathe's Son (65 earth) has 4800 hp, regens 96hp/tic, quads for 79, procs an 18-second lure-based root every 12 seconds, enrages at 10% health. Unsure how it compares to epic pet in a straight out tank situation though.
</SPAN></DIV>

Eandori of Solusek Ro claims that the Servant of Marr (the 62 water pet), when procs are included, has about the same damage output as the epic, rather than doing more damage.<BR><BR>

Black Dragon says that the 63 fire pet can cast Ice Comet (1120 cold-based Wizard DD) and can also snare; give him some mana regen and he'll have some serious damage output.<BR><BR>

The epic pet looks like this:<BR><BR>

<BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Vreminsk Valkyre of Innoruuk</DIV><BR>

The epic pet has the following stats and abilities:

<UL>
<LI>hits for 81 max
<LI>kicks for 35 max
<LI>bashes for 28 max
<LI>is level 49
<LI>has an instant-cast 160 (I've also heard 84?) damage DD + 6 second (max) stun, based on magic resist
<LI>has a 142 (I've also heard 143) DD proc which goes off quite often, and is based on cold resist
<LI>has about 4300hp with a 40 hp/sec regen
<LI>has a 50 point damage shield
</UL>

Gloves of Dark Summoning will focus the Epic Pet and slightly increase its damage output, including the DDs.<BR><BR>

<A name="rundown"></A><DIV class="bighead">- QUEST RUNDOWN -</DIV><BR><BR>

To get the <SPAN class="item">Orb of Mastery</SPAN> (or rather the item, <SPAN class="item">Spell: Summon Orb</SPAN> that you scribe into the spell <SPAN class="spell">Summon Orb</SPAN> that lets you summon the Orb), you turn in four Elements to the <SPAN class="npc">Master of Elements</SPAN> in the <SPAN class="zone">Plane of Sky</SPAN>.  Each of the four Elements (<SPAN class="item">Element of Fire</SPAN>, <SPAN class="item">Element of Earth</SPAN>, <SPAN class="item">Element of Water</SPAN>, <SPAN class="item">Element of Wind</SPAN>) is itself a sub-quest, where you must turn in three or four items to an NPC, who will reward you with the corresponding element.  (Earth and Fire each require four items; Wind and Water each require three items, for 14 items total.)  11 of those 14 items are simple drops from mobs; some high-level and rare, some lower-level and common.  Two of the 14 items are your lower-level focus items from the <SPAN class="zone">Temple of Solusek Ro</SPAN> quests.  The last item, the <SPAN class="item">Power of the Orb</SPAN>, is an item for the <SPAN class="item">Element of Fire</SPAN> sub-quest.  The <SPAN class="item">Power of the Orb</SPAN> itself requires 3 sub-items to be traded in; each of those 3 sub-items needs either 3 or 4 items.  A tree diagram looks like this:<BR><BR>

(The symbol preceding each item indicates whether or not:<BR>
* = a level 60 magician could (probably) do it solo<BR>
+ = it will require multiple people to get (i.e. not even a level 60 mage could safely do it solo)<BR><BR>

Note that I am limiting the above to level 60, not level 65, because only the Ruins of Kunark expansion is required to get the epic; not everyone will have the Planes of Power expansion and be able to get to level 65.)<BR><BR>

Do not confuse the "<B>POWER</B> of Water", "<B>POWER</B> of Earth", etc. with the "<B>ELEMENT</B> of Water", "<B>ELEMENT</B> of Earth", etc.  The "Power of" items are for the <SPAN class="item">Power of the Elements</SPAN> sub-sub-quest of the <SPAN class="item">Power of the Orb</SPAN> sub-quest, and the "Element of" items are the four items you turn in to the <SPAN class="npc">Master of Elements</SPAN> to actually get your epic quest reward.<BR><BR>

When you turn in the three items to receive the <SPAN class="item">Element of Wind</SPAN>, the <SPAN class="npc">Master of Elements</SPAN> will spawn.  He will despawn after a time, but that's okay; Dohpaz Xorbelbeeb of Prexus says that if you go to <SPAN class="npc">Kihun Solstin</SPAN> in the <SPAN class="zone">Plane of Sky</SPAN> and say, "I want to see the master", then the <SPAN class="npc">Master of Elements</SPAN> will spawn.  Graccil Baldinghead of Tribunal confirms this to be true, as do several other people.<BR><BR>

<HR><BR>

<A name="summonorb"></A><SPAN class="secthead">Summon Orb (The Orb of Mastery)<BR>(<B>Plane of Sky</B>: "Master of Elements", quest)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Varia Darselai of The Tribunal</DIV><BR>

Turn in the following four items:

<UL>
<LI><A href="#elementoffire">Element of Fire</A>
<LI><A href="#elementofearth">Element of Earth</A>
<LI><A href="#elementofwater">Element of Water</A>
<LI><A href="#elementofwind">Element of Wind</A>
</UL>

to the <SPAN class="npc">Master of Elements</SPAN>, a named air elemental in the <SPAN class="zone">Plane of Sky</SPAN>.  Each of the four Elements is a quest all its own, and they are detailed below.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Kihun Solstin</SPAN>, who is also in the Plane of Sky, gives you the <SPAN class="item">Element of Wind</SPAN> when you hand him the appropriate items.  When he does this, the Master of Elements will also spawn, so it's probably best to turn in the items to Kihun once you've already gotten the other three Elements (Fire, Earth, and Water) and are ready to complete the quest.  (Or, as is noted above, you can say to Kihun, "I want to see the master", and the Master of Elements will then spawn.)<BR><BR>

When you talk to the Master, the following conversation ensues (thanks to Balasarius NoxDominus of The Seventh Hammer for the text):<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Master of Elements'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Master of Elements says 'I... am... the... Master... of... Elements.. Elements... Forgive... me. I am... unaccustomed.. to.. speaking.. this.. mortal... tongue.  Might.. you... be... the... One? </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'I am the One'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Master of Elements says 'Trilith... Magi'kot.. knelt.. before.. the.. orb.. in.. his.. his.. last.. few.. moments... of.. mortal.. life. He... too... believed.. that.. he.. had.. the.. power.. and.. balance.. needed.. to.. grasp... control.. of.. the.. elements.  He.. was.... flawed.  Coming.. to... me... is.. a.. matter.. of.. no.. small.. import.  Only.. only... one.. who.. is.. of.. balance.. and.. power... power.. may.. control.. the.. Orb.. of... Mastery.  Give.... give.. me.. the.. Elements.. you.. have... gathered.. and.. I.. shall.. see.. if.. you.. are.. ready.. ready.. to control.. the... Elements.. of... life.. life.. life. </SPAN><BR><BR>
</DIV>

However, according to Larry Thiel, this has changed.  Now you need to say, "This mortal is the one," to get the proper text, instead of "I am the one."  It is unknown whether you need to say the text in the first place, although it seems unlikely, since you don't have to do so for most other quests (usually when you do need to, that's because doing so causes the NPC to despawn and respawn in a different form, but that does not seem to happen here.)  Nonetheless, there's no harm in trying, so I would advise saying both, "I am the one," AND "This mortal is the one," before handing in the items.<BR><BR>

Majax of Solusek Ro says that if you say, "I am the one" <B>without</B> targeting the Master, he will respond as before.  Weird, that.<P>

Hand the four Elements to the Master, and he says the following:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="npctalk">Master of Elements says 'You... are.. balanced... and.. powerful.. for.. a.. mortal... Soandso ..... Soandso .  More.. so.. than.... Magi'kot.  But.... you.. are.. not.. yet.. ready.. to.. transcend.. transcend... this.. mortal.. coil.  Take.. take.. seize.. this.. Orb... for.. you.. are.. worthy.. of.. reward.. and.. with... the.. aid.. of... the... balance.. balance.. contained.. within.. the.. Orb.. you.. may.. yet.. reach.. the... ultimate... Mastery. </SPAN><BR><BR>
</DIV>

At this point, he hands you the <SPAN class="item">Spell: Summon Orb</SPAN> spell scroll.  Memorize it immediately, and then force a save to your character by trading 1 copper to someone, or camping out quickly, or gating!<BR><BR>

According to Anna Dantuono, you don't need to do any of this -- the Master is currently bugged and will not respond to any text except a hail.  She says she got a GM to watch her hand in the items, just in case they poofed, but she got her epic just fine without saying anything more than hello to the Master of Elements.<BR><BR>

Once you memorize the spell, you can use it to summon the <SPAN class="item">Orb of Mastery</SPAN>:<BR><BR>

<BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Varia Darselai of The Tribunal</DIV><BR>

Note that, according to various in-game story elements, <SPAN class="npc">Neh`Ashiir</SPAN> is supposed to be FEMALE, but the model used was that of a ghostly Iksar MALE.  As a result, "he" and "she" are used interchangeably here (mostly "he").  The <SPAN class="item">Torch of the Elements</SPAN> is supposedly a 1 in 10 drop, although some reports put it as low as 1 in 4.<BR><BR>

You need a rogue with a Pick Lock skill of 200 to get through a door in the rear of the <SPAN class="zone">City of Mist</SPAN> that leads to Neh'Ashiir's area, so don't forget to bring one.  As far as I know, Neh`Ashiir spawns in the last floating house above City of Mist.  Once you get past the locked door, you have to travel all the way back down the length of the city wall, then up a translucent ramp into the floating houses.  From there, make your way along the walkways and through the houses until you get to the final one -- this is where Neh spawns.<BR><BR>

Uzz of Bristlebane sends the following info:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="npctalk">I have seen Neh`Ashiir on lvl 55 and he is a Enchanter his PH is a Black Reaver that spawns in the top hut.  When the Reaver is killed another mob spawns in his place and it can be Neh`Ashiir or another Black Reaver if a Reaver then you need to kill him again until you get Neh`Ashiir to spawn.  Black Reaver can be up to lvl 52 and is totaly MR, FR and others i think too.</SPAN><BR><BR>
</DIV>

Jeff (no surname? no game name? tsk tsk ;)) sends the following info:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="npctalk">He spawns in the final hut in the Sky area of City of Mist.  I've killed him 6 times, no Torch so far.  I hear people have to kill him up to 10 to 15 times to get it.  His spawn time, along with all hte other Reaver-related mobs, is a few hours.  I don't know exactly how many, but it's too long to stay and wait for another with a full group without them getting too antsy to leave.<BR><BR>

He's harder than Lord Ghiosk, but a LOT easier than Rak'Ashiir, thank goodness.<BR><BR>

I took him out with 2 groups, levels 53-60, with no shaman or chanter to slow.  I think if I had just one group 55-60 with a shaman or enchanter I could have done it with that.  I never saw him cast any spells, but since we killed him very quickly, we could have missed his spells entirely.<BR><BR>

A tactic for killing him a lot that a good friend of mine told me (thanks Zandar!) is to bind on a safe spot on the Sky ramp, and then whenever you're ready to take him on, get a bunch of folks, get a CoH anchor, and gate and CoH them all up directly to him.  It makes it a LOT easier if you don't have to kill everything in the zone to get to him every time (which is what you have to do otherwise).</SPAN><BR><BR>
</DIV>

According to Lzoril Oneiros of Tallon Zek, Neh`Ashiir can spawn after any black reaver kill in the upper house, so there isn't really a "spawn time" involved.  According to Xalmat of Brell Serilis, the Black Reaver PH for Neh is on a 2-hour timer.<BR><BR>

Thanks to Armalite of Erollisi Marr for providing incontrovertible evidence that Neh`Ashiir is an enchanter -- a screenshot of Neh`Ashiir trying to mez him with Dazzle ;)<BR><BR>

Despite his Enchanter nature, Neh`Ashiir can also cast Complete Heal on himself.  So be wary.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Undertow</SPAN> is located in <SPAN class="zone">Kedge Keep</SPAN>, in the Temple of Prexus which is itself north of Estrella's lair.  The Temple itself consists of two sections: the pews and the chapel.  The pews are the first part you will see, when you enter from the south.  The chapel is at the north end of the Temple, and rises high into the ceiling.  Undertow lives at the very very top of the chapel, so when you fight him, you may want to pull him down into the Chapel area to keep him from getting pushed into a wall and poofing.<BR><BR>

Aside from that, he's nothing special -- just a level 49 wizard.  The <SPAN class="item">Blazing Wand</SPAN> is a semi-rare to common drop.<BR><BR>

<BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Varia Darselai of The Tribunal</DIV><BR>

The <SPAN class="item">Burning Embers</SPAN> are a confirmed drop off <SPAN class="npc">Nezekezena</SPAN>, <SPAN class="npc">Gylton</SPAN> (again confirmed by Zephermen Furycaster of Rodcet Nife), and now (thanks to Orko Soulblighter) <SPAN class="npc">Phurzikon</SPAN>, another named wurm in the <SPAN class="zone">Burning Wood</SPAN>.<BR><BR>

Reports indicate that if you go to Nezekezena's spawn location (about (-450, -2550) in Burning Wood) and kill everything in sight, eventually Nez or his (her?) placeholders will start spawning with a cycle time of 90 seconds.  People have evidenced acquiring Burning Embers at a rate of 1 or 2 in a few hours' time with this method.  Phurzikon and Nezekezena both spawn on this spot, and they are both strong; sometimes Nez or Phurz will spawn two times in a row, so your group had better be strong enough to take them.<BR><BR>

Nezekezena, if not killed when she spawns, will wander sometimes along the east and south walls of the zone, so if you can't find her near her spawn, look there.  A tracker would definitely help.<BR><BR>

Phurzikon apparently spawns on the same spawn point as Nezekezena.<BR><BR>

Thanks to Kelston Bernstar for contributing info about Nezekezena and Phurzikon.<BR><BR>

Marthisdil of Prexus confirms that *BOTH* Nezekezena AND Phurzikon can drop the Burning Embers, and have, as of 2001-04-25.<BR><BR>

Kindir tells me that Nezekezena and Phurzikon also have another place where they can spawn in Burning Wood: At (+2450, +600).  It's the same deal as the other spawn point; 80-90 second spawn time with placeholders.  Zacatac of Bristlebane confirms this; he says that the actual loc is (+2700, +1000), but the info is otherwise correct.<BR><BR>

Barbel Tchitchaah of Karana says (edited for clarity :) ):<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="npctalk">About Gylton's spawn: I'm not sure of the exact loc.  This named wurm wanders near the Skyfire zone.  Once you kill him, either he spawns again or Entalon spawns (5 minutes after), and when you kill Entalon, either Entalon or Gylon spawns again.  I've never had many difficulties finding him, just kill a few mobs near Skyfire (just after the ruins, before the way to zone), and eventually you'll see him.  Of course, a tracker would be a great help.  Gylton hit for around 145-155 max, isn't always the same level.  I saw him be level 45, but lower sometimes too.  He's a warrior type wurm (huge hit range, very low aggro range, Ring of Scale faction), and I don't feel he's harder than a standard wurm of the same level.  About soloing him at level 49, I would say yes, you basically would use the same level spells I use when I see him: Earth pet to tank and root, Shock of Swords of course (never never never use fire based DDs, they will resist fire too much to be effective), but also the level 49 conjuration-based Rain of Swords, Gylton and wurms in general have low resists against it, so it's actually mana effective and a good way to kill him fast with SoS between waves (editor's note: Verant is considering fixing the rain spells so that one of the waves is not eaten up by your pet, so this may become an even more efficient spell!).  Just make sure you are at full mana and use a SoW potion before fighting and nuke all you can, you'll be fine :) If you got a druid to track, you can switch to snare kiting also, but beware of adds in this zone.  Make Gylton follow you near the Skyfire zone, because fighting in the forest can be very dangerous.</SPAN><BR><BR>
</DIV>

Note that Gylton has been spotted as far east as (+3440, -2468).  Goen of Antonius Bayle says that he saw <SPAN class="npc">Entalon</SPAN> spawn at exactly (+3130, +2354).  Entalon himself doesn't drop the Embers (as far as is known), but he may be a placeholder for Gylton.<BR><BR>

Jeremy Champlin of Bristlebane, however, has said that no mage he knows of has gotten the Burning Embers off Gylton; you're probably better off focusing on Nezekezena.<BR><BR>

<A name="powerorb"></A><SPAN class="minorhead">* Power of the Orb<BR>(<B>Lake Rathetear</B>: "Rykas", quest)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<TABLE class="npc"><TR><TD></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Rykas</SPAN> can be found in <SPAN class="zone">Lake Rathetear</SPAN>, on the rocks at approximately (+950, -650).  He is a gnome wearing a bright yellow robe.  As far as I know, he never moves from his spawn area, and he's pretty much always there.  I showed up to find him in the middle of the game day (around 2pm game time) and he was sitting there with his earth pet.<BR><BR>

Note that Rykas, several times, has been found other places in the zone.  Apparently if you aggro him, he'll follow you until he kills you, or you leave the zone or lose aggro -- and he WON'T wander back to his spawn point!  He's been sighted at the<SPAN class="zone"> South Karana</SPAN> zoneline, the <SPAN class="zone">Rathe Mountains</SPAN> zoneline, and a few other random spots besides his spawn point.  It's unknown whether you can deal with him, quest-wise, if he's not at his spawn point, but I assume you can.  If you feel up to it, have someone kite him back to his spawn point, or kill him so he respawns, and you can deal with him there.<BR><BR>

Ungnown Mydgit of Drinal says that Rykas probably won't talk to you unless you're level 49+.  At the very least, a level 44 magician was told to "go fishing" instead of being given the actual quest text.  If anyone can nail down the exact level, that would be great.<BR><BR>

Zaldipus of Brell Serilis claims that Rykas gave him the token at level 46.  Danedori of Kane Bayle says that Rykas gave him the token at 47.<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Rykas'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Rykas says 'Greetings Soandso , I am Rykas, chronicler of knowledge.

<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'I am in search of knowledge'</SPAN><BR><BR>

He will share some of the knowledge I have bestowed upon him, and point you further down your path to Mastery.  Bring me the Words of Mastery,  Power of the Elements, and the Words of Magi'kot....Then you shall learn more about the power of the orb.</SPAN><BR>
</DIV><BR>

Rykas then gives you the <SPAN class="item">Token of Mastery</SPAN>:<BR><BR>

<BR>

Take the Token of Mastery to <SPAN class="npc">Jahsohn Aksot</SPAN> in the <SPAN class="zone">West Commonlands</SPAN> and give it to him (see the <A href="#magikotwords">Words of Magi'kot</A> entry below).<BR><BR>

and give them to Rykas all at once.  Upon doing so, he says:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="npctalk">Rykas says 'I see that you have completed the quest I laid before you.  That speaks well of your dedication, yet you do not realize your journey has just begun. Study this tome.</SPAN><BR><BR>

</DIV><BR>

Rykas then rewards you with the <SPAN class="item">Power of the Orb</SPAN>, a scroll that you can read.  Immediately after he gave me the Power of the Orb, he despawned, and then he INSTANTLY respawned about 10 feet away.  This probably has something to do with game mechanics, and it doesn't affect the quest at all.<BR><BR>

<BR>

If you read the Power of the Orb, the pages appear thus:<BR><BR>

<BR>
<BR>

The text reads:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="expgain">
An elementalist's power comes from the Orb of Mastery.  The Elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water are contained within the orb.  The Master of Elements holds the Orb.<BR><BR>

Trilith Magi'kot presented himself to the Master of Elements and the Orb of Mastery.  The power of elements brought agony to his mind and body.  Magi'kot was not of Balance.<BR><BR>
Fire burned his eyes unto blindness, Wind put his mind into a spin, Earth entered his body and aged him like the mountains, and finally, Water washed his memories of mortal life away.<BR><BR>

</DIV><BR>

The Master of Fire is the aforementioned <SPAN class="npc">Jennus Lyklobar</SPAN>, found in the <SPAN class="zone">Skyfire Mountains</SPAN>.  I don't know what happens if you give Jennus the Power of the Orb like the text suggests, but I wouldn't advise trying it, and it's not necessary to complete the quest.<BR><BR>

</DIV><BR>

(Danedori of Kane Bayle says that at level 47, the phrase "Rykas gave it to me" did not work with Jahsohn, but "Rykas sent me" did.<BR><BR>)

<BR>

<A name="page1"></A><SPAN class="smhead">* Torn Page of Magi'kot pg. 1 (Kithicor Forest: "dread wolf", "dreaded wolf", "enraged dread wolf", always drop)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>

Any of the dread wolves (<SPAN class="npc">dread wolf</SPAN>, <SPAN class="npc">dreaded wolf</SPAN>, <SPAN class="npc">enraged dread wolf</SPAN>) that spawn in <SPAN class="zone">Kithicor Forest</SPAN> at night will drop this item.  Be careful; even a level 46 mage with his strongest pet can be overrun in seconds by himself.  You can probably do this part solo at 49 without too much difficulty, but for safety's sake, TAKE A GROUP WITH YOU ANYWAY.  I got my <SPAN class="item">Torn Page of Magi`kot pg. 1</SPAN> off an "enraged dread wolf", which was easy to kill once I was able to engage it near the West Commonlands zone border, without fear of random zombie troopers showing up to ruin my day.  Or rather, night.  I had the help of two warriors, a cleric, and a wizard, and we dispatched the enraged dread wolf easily.  Then a zombie trooper showed up, and my pet soloed it while the others took on a dread wolf that came out of nowhere!  Both the enraged dread wolf and the dread wolf dropped the Torn Page of Magi'kot 1.<BR><BR>

Senrye Talbanath of Drinal tells me that she and some friends went to Kithicor to get the Torn Page of Magi'kot 1.  They killed 5 dread wolves and 1 dreaded wolf, and none of them dropped the page; they also killed two enraged dread wolves, and both times the page dropped.  This may have been random chance, or it may be indicative of a change in the drop rates.  In either event, it's probably still more efficient to kill whatever wolves come your way.<BR><BR>

Itchyban of Veeshan says that he killed 2 dreaded wolves, 1 dread wolf, and 1 enraged dread wolf, and only the enraged dropped the Page.  It's looking more likely that the drop rates have changed on the wolves, but I'd still make sure to kill every wolf I could, just in case.<BR><BR>

<A name="page2"></A><SPAN class="smhead">* Torn Page of Magi'kot pg. 2 (Unrest: "a tentacle terror", always drop)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>

At level 39 I was on a guild raid into <SPAN class="zone">The Estate of Unrest</SPAN>.  Nearly every mob in the zone conned blue to me, with the exception of some <SPAN class="npc">Festering Hags</SPAN>, and these puppies.  Get a group of high 30s/low 40s together, and you can clear out the entire Unrest basement single-handedly.  Of the handful of <SPAN class="npc">tentacle terrors</SPAN> we killed, at least 2 and maybe 3 of them dropped the page.  These nasties are usually found in the last room in the basement, where <SPAN class="npc">Garanel Rucksif</SPAN> (the ghost dwarf) spawns.  They aren't all that hard to kill, but you'll want a group, because TTs are casters, either shadow knight or necromancer class (though they didn't have any pets, and they didn't harm touch that I could tell).  They cast lifetap- and disease-based spells.<BR><BR>

Also please note that there are tentacle terrors in <SPAN class="zone">Najena</SPAN>, but the Najena TTs are much lower level AND THEY DO NOT DROP the <SPAN class="item">Torn Page of Magi'kot pg. 2</SPAN>.<BR><BR>

Somebody Who Didn't Bother To Leave His Name told me that <SPAN class="npc">a dark terror</SPAN>, in the Unrest basement, can also drop the Torn Page 2.  Confirmed by Chabasrn Shadowflare of the Nameless.<BR><BR>

<A name="page3"></A><SPAN class="smhead">* Torn Page of Magi'kot pg. 3<BR>(<B>Lower Guk</B>: "a bloodthirsty ghoul", "a frenzied ghoul", always drop)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>

I spent about half of level 42 in the Frenzy camp in the <SPAN class="zone">Ruins of Old Guk</SPAN> (aka Lower Guk).  This was a good level to be there; most mobs conned low blue to even (with a handful of yellows); the groups' members ranged anywhere from 38 to 52.  I was there for exp and loot, since I wasn't really aware of the fact that the <SPAN class="item">Torn Page of Magi'kot pg. 3</SPAN> dropped from <SPAN class="npc">bloodthirsty ghouls</SPAN> (and, as it turns out, the <SPAN class="npc">frenzied ghoul</SPAN> itself can also drop the page).  If you are in this camp for even a couple of hours, you will with certainty see bloodthirsty ghouls, and probably at least one frenzied ghoul, and about one out of four of the BTs dropped page 3.  (I saw about four pages while I was there, not including the one that a party member looted accidentally because he didn't know what it was.)  BTG's are strong warriors, but a normal frenzy group can take them easily.  If you're building a party to go down there (and for some reason it's not already camped), BRING AN ENCHANTER.  The best room to camp in is the rectanguler anteroom just outside of the frenzied ghoul's room, since only a couple of weaker frogloks actually spawn in that room; you can actively pull from the surrounding rooms into it safely.<BR><BR>

<A name="powerelements"></A><SPAN class="subhead">+ Power of the Elements<BR>(<B>Butcherblock Mountains</B>: Walnan, quest)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<TABLE class="npc"><TR><TD></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Walnan</SPAN> tends to wander along the path from the docks in the <SPAN class="zone">Butcherblock Mountains</SPAN>, to near the <SPAN class="zone">South Kaladim</SPAN> entrance.  When I found her, she was standing behind a tree just upslope of the road near the last dwarf guard hut before you reach Kaladim.  However she can also be in the area north of the road near the docks.  Your best bet is to cast Sense Summoned in this area, which will hopefully lead you to Walnan's pet.  However, she does not always summon one, so you might need to find a tracking class to hunt her down.  Walnan is a female High Elf wearing a purple robe.<BR><BR>

Xalmat of Brell Serilis thinks that Walnan no longer summons a pet, nor is she always spawned.  This makes her harder to find, if so, but she should presumably still roam the same general area, between Kaladim and the docks.<BR><BR>

Sandainae of Druzzil Ro claims that Walnan has a fixed spawn point, at (+3100, +2420).<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Walnan'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Walnan says 'Hallo Soandso ! I am Walnan, elementalist,  summoner, wanderer, and sometimes teacher.  Might you be a elementalist in search of the truth? </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'I am in search of the truth.'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Walnan says 'The truth is something not all people can handle or understand.  If the truth of the elements is what you seek then the Power of the Elements shall reveal all.  Have you come to learn of Magi'kot? </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'I have come to learn of magi'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Walnan says 'Magi'kot was the most powerful elementalist of his age.  He may have been the most powerful mortal mage of all time, such was his mastery.  He wished to obtain infinite knowledge and wisdom in order to further expand the arcane art of Summoning.  Do you know what became of Magi'kot? </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'No.'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Walnan says 'Only a few elementalists and followers outside our circle know what truly happened to Magi'kot.  Even now, many are fearful to speak of his name.  If you truly wish to continue, here is what you must do.  Gather the Power of the Earth, warded by a fae creature.  Then seek the Power of Fire, held by an elemental.  Next you will need the Power of Wind, held by a twirling and prancing wanderer who has been corrupted.  Finally, the Power of Water, held by a ravenous beast who is the minion of a fallen Sarnak.  Bring them all to me, and I shall give you the Power of the Elements. </SPAN><BR>
</DIV><BR>

At this point, gather the following four Powers (described below) and give them to Walnan:

<UL>
<LI><A href="#powerfire">Power of Fire</A>
<LI><A href="#powerearth">Power of Earth</A>
<LI><A href="#powerwater">Power of Water</A>
<LI><A href="#powerwind">Power of Wind</A>
</UL>

Give her all four at once; the order does not matter.<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="npctalk">Walnan says 'Wait, Soandso , are you not forgetting something? </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Walnan says 'Wait, Soandso , are you not forgetting something? </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Walnan says 'Wait, Soandso , are you not forgetting something? </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Walnan says 'The arcane art of Summoning is derived from the power of the elements which surround us.  Continue your journey across the Ocean of Tears.  In a dark fortress, you should find Akksstaf lurking about.  Be wary, but tell him that you seek Magi'kot.  Hurry now Soandso , you do not wish to miss the ship! </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="expgain">You gain experience!!</SPAN><BR>
</DIV><BR>

Walnan then rewards you with the <SPAN class="item">Power of the Elements</SPAN>.<BR><BR>

<A name="powerearth"></A><SPAN class="smhead">* Power of Earth<BR>(<B>Lesser Faydark</B>: "a faerie guard", rare drop (?))</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>

If you've killed <SPAN class="npc">faerie guard</SPAN>s for your Robe of the Elements quest, well, you know how they go.  I got lucky; some guildmates and I were in the <SPAN class="zone">Lesser Faydark</SPAN> helping a druid guildmate camp Brownie Scouts for an epic quest item.  During a break in the spawns, I SoW-ran with my air pet over to the faerie village, and pulled the faerie guard who spawns east of the village (behind a tree).  One Shock of Swords, and two seconds being beat on by my pet, and the faerie dropped dead.  I guess I was lucky because she dropped both the <SPAN class="item">Power of Earth</SPAN> (a black ball, looks like a black pearl or a Glowing Black Stone) and the <SPAN class="item">Twice-Woven Cloak</SPAN> (for the RotE quest), so I was able to go complete the RotE yet again.<BR><BR>

Faerie guards are easy if they're green to you, since they will only come one at a time when you pull them.  They are typical warrior mobs, nothing out of the ordinary for their level (max 24).  Don't confuse them with Fairy Guards, who are not the same mob (I don't know whether they drop the same loot).<BR><BR>

Faeries have the Faerie faction, though as far as I know only faeries are sensitive to this faction, so once you kill a few faerie guards, you will be KOS to the faeries and will not be able to travel safely through their village.  However there don't appear to be any other places in Norrath where this faction comes into play.<BR><BR>

Two separate sources have stated that they camped the Faerie village, killing more or less everything in sight, upwards of 8 hours before getting their Power of Earth.  Damn, I'm lucky.<BR><BR>

However, others have said that the Power of Earth is now a common or uncommon drop, rather than rare.<BR><BR>

(The "undead sprite guards", who were part of the LFay invasion some time ago, apparently no longer exist -- so I've removed the information about them.  Thanks to Arasmour Painecaster of Karana.)<BR><BR>

Itchyban of Veeshan says that he killed 9 faerie guards, and got one drop of the Power of Earth.<BR><BR>

<A name="powerfire"></A><SPAN class="smhead">* Power of Fire<BR>(<B>Solusek's Eye</B>: "blazing elemental" rare drop, "lava elemental", common drop?)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>

This is a boring but easy camp if you have your level 39 pets or better, and even at 34 you SHOULD be able to do this solo although it will be more work.  I personally had to camp for about 3.5 hours to get the <SPAN class="item">Power of Fire</SPAN>; lucky for me, it was 4 am and I was going to give up for the night after one last spawn, and lo, it had the Power of Fire.  The longest report I've gotten was a 20-hour camp, but the average seems to be 3-5 hours.  Merhlyn of Brell Serilis reports a 5 hour 20 minute camp.<BR><BR>

The <SPAN class="npc">blazing elemental</SPAN>s spawn in the north part of <SPAN class="zone">Solusek's Eye</SPAN> (aka Sol A), in a pit that has two false ceilings (which are actually false floors in two other rooms, above the pit) and a ramp that leads into another room where nothing spawns.  (If you have the <A href="http://www.eqatlas.com/solusekseyemap.html">EQ Atlas map of Sol A</A>), the blazing elementals' pit is marked at spot 3, and the unoccupied room is the small, perfectly square room just southwest of the "3".)<BR><BR>

The simplest way to camp the blazing elementals is to sit in the pit itself, and wait for them to spawn.  If you have your pet parked down there with you, then as soon as the BEs spawn, they will aggro on you, and your pet will beat them to death.  It was a boring 19 minutes between each spawn, but I had several books to read. ;)  Sitting in the pit is preferable to camping from the room above because if they aggro as soon as they spawn, they won't have time to cast their damage shield on themselves.  That DS is just as strong as your fire pet's, and can be very dangerous.<BR><BR>

The only other threat is the Reckless Efreeti, who is level 28 and spawns near the back of the pit.  He is more or less a level 28 generic warrior mob, easily disposed of by a 39 pet.  I only saw him once, near the end of my camp, and he had no fire shield, nor did he cast any spells.  My pet wiped him out in no time, solo.  He dropped the Platinum Armband.<BR><BR>

The <SPAN class="npc">lava elemental</SPAN> in the rear of Sol A (behind the gnome castle) also rarely drops the Power of Fire.  If you are camping the blazing elementals, and want to deal with running over to see if the lava elemental has popped, feel free to do so.  Dark Elf magicians or people who have bad faction with the gnomes in Sol A will have to deal with getting past the gnomes, however.  The lava elemental is somewhat tougher than the blazing elemental.<BR><BR>

The lava elemental's placeholder is a wandering gnome; bjstout says that the other gnomes in the area will assist the wandering gnome if you attack it, but only if you're level 50 or below.  At level 51 or above, they won't assist, and the placeholder has a 20 minute spawn time.  He also said he's killed the lava elemental 6 times so far, and gotten no Power of Fire drops.<BR><BR>

Sumoner Deltorros of Bristlebane says that the Power of Fire is at best an uncommon drop off the lava elemental.  At the very least, the PoF does NOT always drop from it.<BR><BR>

Bahmut Illuminarie of Ayonae Ro says that he killed the lava elemental 9 times before the Power of Fire dropped.<BR><BR>

Arasmour Painecaster of Karana says that the easiest way to camp the lava elemental is to kill the roamer in that room -- the static spawns are not PHes for the lava elemental.  If you are high enough level you should be able to solo the roamer without getting any adds from the static spawns.<BR><BR>

Itchyban of Veeshan says that he killed 83 blazing elementals before he got the Power of Fire.  (At two spawns every 19 minutes, that's about 13 hours.  Ouch.)  He also says that his level 49 fire pet would aggro the various miners and clockwork gnomes in the lava elemental's spawn area, and they managed to kill him once (he was level 51).  He killed the lava elemental twice, but got no drops.<BR><BR>

<BR>

Any of the various <SPAN class="npc">ravener</SPAN>s in <SPAN class="zone">Kaesora</SPAN> can drop the <SPAN class="item">Power of Water</SPAN>.  I got lucky.  I went to Kaesora by myself; there were one or two other people in the zone.  I levitated down the eastern drop from the entry room, summoned a pet, went linkdead, came back, summoned another pet, and was almost immediately attacked by a famished ravener.  My earth pet rooted it and I nuked it half to death; my pet finished it off.  The ravener dropped the Power of Water, and I immediately gated out.<BR><BR>

Kaesora is a dangerous dungeon, even at higher levels, to visit yourself.  It's easy to get swarmed.  (I was foolish to do so; take a group with you!)  Raveners are found all over the dungeon, but they are not very common mobs; they are found mostly in the upper levels to the east of the entry room, and sometimes down in the Five Towers area where Xalgoz lives.  Raveners will drop the power of water rather frequently; one good night's session camping the dungeon for exp will almost certainly get you a Power of Water, if not several.<BR><BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Gypsy dancer</SPAN>s themselves are only level 25-26, but the room they primarily spawn in (the ballroom in <SPAN class="zone">Castle Mistmoore</SPAN>) also contains lots of higher level mobs, usually in the low 30s.  If you have a group of 30+ people and can safely handle one mob at a time (either because you have a monk to pull or an enchanter to mez), then breaking in and camping the ballroom should be not too difficult.<BR><BR>

<A name="wordsofmastery"></A><SPAN class="subhead">* Words of Mastery<BR>(<B>Najena</B>: Akksstaff, quest)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<TABLE class="npc"><TR><TD></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Akksstaff</SPAN> wanders in random places in <SPAN class="zone">Najena</SPAN>.  When I found him, he was literally standing at the zone border to the <SPAN class="zone">Lavastorm Mountains</SPAN>.  Reports have him in almost any spot in Najena; inside various rooms, in the dungeon cell with Linara Parlone, in the goblin caverns, etc.  He is a male Dark Elf wearing a hideous brownish-green robe.<BR><BR>

Kelston Bernstar reports that Akksstaff's spawn point is in the hallway that leads to Rathyl's and Linara's cells, and he will eventually wander.  Akksstaff can have a spawn time of (apparently) anywhere from a couple of hours up to THREE DAYS.  So don't kill him!  Akksstaff has also been seen spawning in Najena's room itself!<BR><BR>

For my part, I was in Lavastorm on my way to Nagafen's Lair, and I shouted, "Anyone heading to Najena, if you see Akksstaff, it's worth 20 platinum pieces."  A few minutes later, someone sent me a tell that Akksstaff was standing at the zone, so I rushed over there, talked with Akksstaff (below) and gave the lucky player his 20pp.<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Akksstaff'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Akksstaff says 'What do you want?! Foolish High Elf, I am in no mood to treat with beggars.  I have half a mind to turn Jobober here loose on you!  Well, don't keep me waiting, state your business or be off with you!</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN class="npctalk">Akksstaff says 'Ah, that I can help you with.  Magi'kot was a powerful elementalist, able to control the power of the elements which surrounded him.  He was not able to fully master the elements when I was learning from him, but soon after my departure I heard rumours that he was going after the Orb of Mastery.  At the time, I did not feel he was ready to harness all the elements, but Magi'kot listened to no one.  He was in search of power beyond any held by a mortal.  Do you wish to hear more?</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'I wish to hear more'</SPAN><BR><BR>

</SPAN>

<DIV class="center">
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
</DIV><BR>

When you're in your 20s, <SPAN class="zone">Najena</SPAN> is a good place to go for loot and exp.  It's a "doable" dungeon, meaning a single group of mid-to-high 20s (or even low 30s) can crawl through the dungeon, clearing it out room by room.  A single crawl, even if you kill every mob in the dungeon, is not likely to net you all four pages; I spent a good 5-6 hours there both at levels 40 and 46, killing literally every mob in the dungeon, before I gathered all four pages.  Keep at it, and you'll get it.  Note that the pages can drop off both the <SPAN class="npc">goblin magician</SPAN>s found in the northern caverns, as well as the Dark Elf <SPAN class="npc">magicians</SPAN>, and even a few of the named mobs in the zone.  I personally looted the Wind page off of <SPAN class="npc">Rathyl</SPAN>.  (Ualdail of Fennin Ro confirms that he looted the Water page off of <SPAN class="npc">Rathyl incarnate</SPAN>, who can spawn right after you kill Rathyl.)<BR><BR>

If you're higher level (45+), it's fairly trivial to solo literally the entire zone.  Just run about killing everything you see, and eventually you'll get all the Pages.  You can even go to <SPAN class="npc">Najena</SPAN>'s room, since the new spell Summon Companion allows a mage to pull her pet out of the pool near Najena's room once she's done killing Najena and her friends.<BR><BR>

The spawn time in this zone is around 18 minutes, and it will take about that long to hit all of the other spawns you need to hit.  These are:

<OL>
<LI><SPAN class="npc">BoneCracker</SPAN> and the <SPAN class="npc">necromancer</SPAN>s in his room (you only really need to hit this once, for the key that BoneCracker drops), plus the <SPAN class="npc">Ogre Captain</SPAN> (again, only once, for the key he drops).
<LI><SPAN class="npc">Trazdon</SPAN> and the <SPAN class="npc">magician</SPAN>s in his room.  (I don't know whether Trazdon is capable of dropping the Pages, because I only killed him once and he didn't drop them that time, so it's hard to tell.  But the magicians in his room certainly do drop the pages, so it's worth a trip.)
<LI>The magician at the front gate of the castle area (where the entry caverns end).
<LI>The magician in the room behind her.
<LI>The two magicians in the Crystal Room.
<LI>The two necromancers and <SPAN class="npc">Drelzna</SPAN> (or her PH, another necro) in Drelzna's room.  (As necromancers do not drop the pages, this is not strictly a necessary trip, though Drelzna does drop the key to Najena's room.  <B>Fun Fact:</B> Did you know that Drelzna used to drop Journeyman's Boots as her rare drop?)
<LI>The three magicians in the antechamber outside Rathyl's room.
<LI>Rathyl or his placeholder (a magician or various elementals) in Rathyl's room (and Rathyl incarnate, if it spawns).
<LI>All the goblins at the three goblin camps in the north caves.  One is in a cul-de-sac to the west; the other two are in rooms to the east and north.
</OL>

If you hit these spots in this order, you will sooner or later get all the Pages.  Be wary of other people camping the dungeon for exp and loot; don't run over their camps.  But do shout to the zone that you're looking for the Pages, and if people could please not loot them and tell you, that would be nice.  A friendly group of low-20's adventurers were camping Trazdon's room when one of the magicians there dropped the Water Page (the last one I needed); I gave one of them the 12 platinum I had earned in the 2 hours I spent trying to get the Water Page, and she was ecstatically thankful.  (This is back in the day when 12pp was worth something to a low-level adventurer.)<BR><BR>

You will need some keys to get around the dungeon.  The best order for this, is thus: Go to BoneCracker's room and kill him.  He will drop the <SPAN class="item">Dull Bone Key</SPAN> (DBK).  Then go to the nearby Ogre Captain, and kill him, for he drops the <SPAN class="item">Shiny Metal Key</SPAN> (SMK).  The SMK opens the cell outside Rathyl's room; the DBK opens Rathyl's room itself.  Kill Rathyl or his placeholders until Rathyl drops the <SPAN class="item">Bloodstained Key</SPAN> (BSK) (this key is NORENT so if you go linkdead for too long, or camp, you will need to get it again).  The BSK opens the door to Drelzna's room.  Drelzna drops the <SPAN class="item">Golden Crescent Key</SPAN> (GCK), but this only leads to Najena's room, and you don't really need to go there, so just stick the GCK in a bag and forget about it unless you really feel like killing Najena.  (Two magicians spawn in Najena's room, and Najena's placeholder is also a magician, so if you want to bother going in there, you can kill the three of them and hope to get some pages.)  The GCK is also NORENT.  (The DBK and SMK are NOT NORENT, you can hang onto them forever, and probably should if you have to camp this place more than once.)<BR><BR>

Virtually nothing in this dungeon has more than 600 hit points or hits for more than 50 damage (except the <SPAN class="npc">Widowmistress</SPAN>, a high-30s dark elven rogue who is <B>incredibly</B> fast and <B>incredibly</B> dangerous, and spawns in the northwest corner of the dungeon, beyond all the goblin camps).  The magicians and necromancers will all have pets and will cast their appropriate class spells, but otherwise are trivial to kill at high level.  They can be difficult at lower levels, however (fighting 3 necros solo at 39 can get you killed if you aren't careful).  The named mobs are, as expected, somewhat more difficult, but not much.<BR><BR>

A quick summary of which pages dropped off which mobs in Najena, although I don't know whether there's any relationship between them:<BR>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN class="item">Torn Page of Mastery Water</SPAN> dropped off a magician in Trazdon's room.
<LI><SPAN class="item">Torn Page of Mastery Wind</SPAN> dropped off Rathyl.
<LI><SPAN class="item">Torn Page of Mastery Earth</SPAN> dropped off a magician in the main castle area, although I also saw several pages of Earth drop off the goblin magicians in the north caves.
<LI><SPAN class="item">Torn Page of Mastery Fire</SPAN> dropped off a goblin magician in the north caves.  I believe I also saw Fire drop off one of the dark elf magicians, but I saw it drop off the goblins at least 3 times.
</UL>

Nerobus of Tunare confirms that the Earth page can drop off the Dark Elf magicians, and I think it's reasonable to assume that any of the four pages can drop off any of the magicians, fire goblins, rathyl, etc. in Najena.<BR><BR>

The pages no longer drop in Cazic-Thule; the zone was revamped in early 2002 and is now a 50+ zone.  The mobs that used to be in CT are now outside, in the Feerrott, and Fablan of Drinal confirms that the alligators in the Feerrott do indeed drop the pages, albeit very rarely -- he says he got 1 Water and 1 Wind page from about 40 alligators.  Note that <SPAN class="npc">a swamp alligator</SPAN> is a lower-level mob that does not drop the pages; the ones you want are called <SPAN class="npc">an alligator</SPAN>.<BR><BR>

Kelston Bernstar tells me that he has never heard of the pages dropping off Trazdon or "a necromancer", but I still keep them in the list on the off chance that they have the pages in their loot table as a rare drop.<BR><BR>

Sumoner Deltorros of Bristlebane says that he looted the Torn Page of Mastery: Wind off of a <SPAN class="npc">darkboned skeleton</SPAN>.  Darkbone skeletons, in my experience, only spawn in the front area of Najena, before you enter the keep proper.<BR><BR>

Trezark S'Dious of Vazaelle confirms that darkboned skeletons can indeed drop the Torn Pages, albeit rarely.  He also says that since Najena is a magician, she MAY drop the pages, but he's never heard of it happening.  He also says that he once found a page on Rathyl reincarnate, so killing Rathyl is worth the effort (as I said, I got my Wind page off Rathyl himself, and killing Rathyl reincarnate gives you a second shot at getting a page).<BR><BR>

Eliadan Starforge of Tunare also confirms that the darkboned skeletons can drop the Pages.  He got one off one of the darkbones in the room full of skeletons near Rathyl's room.<BR><BR>

Deke Everburn of Ayonae Ro says that the necromancer who guards the portal to the <SPAN class="zone">Plane of Fear</SPAN>, <SPAN class="npc">Cyndreela</SPAN>, can ALSO drop the Pages!  This seems incredibly unlikely.  Can someone confirm this, preferably with a screenshot of the item on her corpse?<BR><BR>

Xalmat of Brell Serilis adds that one of the Pages dropped off a female High Elf in the jail area.  He guesses that the pages can drop from any mob in the zone, but this isn't confirmed.<BR><BR>

Greymora of Zebuxoruk confirms Xalmat; the skeletons in the zone all seem to drop the Torn Pages as well.  Probably almost any mob in the zone can drop the pages.<BR><BR>

<A name="elementofearth"></A><SPAN class="secthead">Element of Earth<BR>(<B>Firiona Vie</B>: "Tiblner Milnik", quest)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<TABLE class="npc"><TR><TD></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Tiblner Milnik</SPAN> is known to wander along the <SPAN class="zone">Firiona Vie</SPAN> cliffs, east of the city.  I have personally seen him standing at the north end of the bridge leading out of the Firiona Vie city area, but usually he wanders along the cliffs with his earth pet.  The last time I saw him, he was wandering at about (-2000, -900), a little ways north of the edge of the cliffs, walking east.  He is a male High Elf and wears a brown robe.  Characters who have bad faction with Firiona Vie factions need to be careful as there are numerous mobs (pilgrims and others) who wander the cliffs -- not to mention the regular aggressive mobs like drolvargs, drachnids, leeches, etc.<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Tiblner Milnik'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Tiblner Milnik says 'Huh?  What?  Oh, you speak so fast, it took me a moment.   I have become used to the slow and stately conversation the Earth holds, where a thought can span aeons.  I am the Master of Earth, you know.  Though I'm usually too humble to say this, that makes me the most powerful mortal in Norrath, as everyone knows that Earth is the only REAL Element, all else must give way before its power.  Water is absorbed by it, Air is ignored by it, and Fire is contained in it.   But you know all these things, I am sure.  Are you interested in obtaining the Element of Earth?  I know Magi'kot was, but we know what happened to him, don't we?</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="pctalk">You say, 'I am interested in obtaining the element of earth'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="npctalk">Tiblner Milnik says 'Combining the following items can bring the Element of Earth together.  Obtain the Staff of Elemental Mastery:Earth, held by the minions of the Prince of Hate, The Dirt of Underfoot found on Slix something or the other, and of course, I shall need the Broom of Trilon and the Shovel of Ponz.  Bring all these things, and I shall show you what a true Master of Earth can do, and gift you with the Element of Earth.</SPAN><BR>
</DIV><BR>

At this point, turn in the following four items to Tiblner:

<UL>
<LI><A href="#shovel">Shovel of Ponz</A>
<LI><A href="#broom">Broom of Trilon</A>
<LI><A href="#earthstaff">Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth</A>
<LI><A href="#underfoot">Dirt of Underfoot</A>

And he will respond thusly:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="npctalk">Tiblner Milnik says 'Take this Element and keep it with you.  I wish you the best in your journey, but I must ask you to leave me now, this frantic pace you set makes me nervous.</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN class="expgain">You gain party experience!!</SPAN><BR>
</DIV><BR>

(Thanks to Senrye Talbanath of Drinal for the text.)<BR><BR>

Tiblner then gives you the <SPAN class="item">Element of Earth</SPAN>.<BR><BR>

<A name="shovel"></A><SPAN class="minorhead">* Shovel of Ponz<BR>(<B>Temple of Solusek Ro</B>: "Vira", quest)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>

The <SPAN class="item">Shovel of Ponz</SPAN> is the reward for completing one of the magician focus item quests from the <SPAN class="zone">Temple of Solusek Ro</SPAN>.  Acquire:

<UL>
<LI><SPAN class="item">a shovel</SPAN> dropped by <SPAN class="npc">magician</SPAN>s in <SPAN class="zone">Najena</SPAN> or <SPAN class="npc">an alligator</SPAN> in <SPAN class="zone">the Feerrott</SPAN>;
<LI><SPAN class="item">hill giant toes</SPAN> dropped by <SPAN class="npc">hill giants</SPAN>, or (more easily) vendors near hill giant areas (people often sell the toes to merchants; try <SPAN class="zone">Rathe Mountains</SPAN>, where people are constantly hunting hill giants);
<LI>a <SPAN class="item">gargoyle eye</SPAN> (from <SPAN class="npc">gargoyle</SPAN>s or, again, vendors near places where people hunt gargoyles, like <SPAN class="zone">Castle Mistmoore</SPAN> and the <SPAN class="zone">Ocean of Tears</SPAN>); and
<LI>a <SPAN class="item">ruby</SPAN> (virtually every city has jewel vendors that sell rubies).
</UL>

None of these four items are NODROP, although the Shovel of Ponz itself IS NODROP.<BR><BR>

<BR>

Turn them in to <SPAN class="npc">Vira</SPAN> in the Temple of Solusek Ro to get the Shovel of Ponz.  Vira is upstairs, on the left side of the balcony surrounding the main hall (as you face the dais).<BR><BR>

You need good faction with the Temple of Solusek Ro to do this quest.  The simplest way to do this is to kill <SPAN class="npc">Shadowed Men</SPAN>.  Another way is to turn in <SPAN class="item">Dervish Cutthroat rings</SPAN> to <SPAN class="npc">Ortallius</SPAN> in the <SPAN class="zone">Southern Desert of Ro</SPAN>.  A third way is to find <SPAN class="npc">Ssynthi</SPAN>, the renegade Shadowed Man (he is aligned with the Temple) in Mistmoore, and give him the flower found on the tomb inside the building he hides behind.  The fastest way is probably to kill Shadowed Men, since at 45+ you can easily pull them solo and kill them quickly.  As far as I know, most players will already have good enough faction with the Temple's residents to begin with, but in case you need to up it or fix it, this is how.<BR><BR>

<A name="broom"></A><SPAN class="minorhead">* Broom of Trilon<BR>(<B>Temple of Solusek Ro</B>: "Vira", quest)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>

Another of the magician focus item quests from the <SPAN class="zone">Temple of Solusek Ro</SPAN>.  All information about this quest is identical to the <SPAN class="item">Shovel of Ponz</SPAN> quest, above, except for the items you turn in to <SPAN class="npc">Vira</SPAN>.

<UL>
<LI><SPAN class="item">a broom</SPAN>, dropped by <SPAN class="npc">magician</SPAN>s in <SPAN class="zone">Najena</SPAN> or <SPAN class="npc">an alligator</SPAN> in <SPAN class="zone">the Feerrott</SPAN>;
<LI><SPAN class="item">cyclops toes</SPAN>, dropped by <SPAN class="npc">a cyclops</SPAN>, or (more easily) vendors near cyclops areas (e.g. <SPAN class="zone">Southern Plains of Karana</SPAN>);
<LI><SPAN class="item">a griffon feather</SPAN>, dropped by <SPAN class="npc">griffon</SPAN>s or, again, vendors near places where people hunt griffons (e.g. <SPAN class="zone">Northern Plains of Karana</SPAN>); and
<LI><SPAN class="item">a star ruby</SPAN> (virtually every city has jewel vendors that sell star rubies.  Note that star rubies are NOT the same as rubies; star rubies are considerably cheaper).
</UL>

None of these four items are NODROP, although the <SPAN class="item">Broom of Trilon</SPAN> IS NODROP.<BR><BR>

Turn them in to Vira to get the Broom of Trilon.<BR><BR>

<A name="earthstaff"></A><SPAN class="minorhead">+ Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth<BR>(<B>Plane of Hate</B>: "Magi P`tasa", uncommon to rare drop)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of <A href="http://www.magecompendium.com" target="_top">The Mage Compendium</A></DIV><BR>

<SPAN class="smhead">IMPORTANT UPDATE:</SPAN> The <SPAN class="item">Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth</SPAN> <B>*** NO LONGER DROPS OFF <SPAN class="npc">INNORUUK</SPAN> ***!</B>  It now drops off one of the mini-bosses in the <SPAN class="zone">Plane of Hate</SPAN>, a Dark Elf named <SPAN class="npc">Magi P`tasa</SPAN>.  This change was made in late 2001.<BR><BR>

In May of 2003, the Plane of Hate was completely revamped.  The layout is totally different, the spawns are all different, everything's different.  Magi P`tasa, who drops the Earth Staff, now spawns in a house just south of the zone-in point.  He's got a PH (male Forsaken Revenant).  And the Earth Staff can now drop off both P`tasa himself, as well as the Forsaken Revenants, so it's a slightly more common drop.  The respawn time on the revenants is now 30 minutes, so a single high-level group can easily hold that camp.  (Thanks Xalmat of Brell Serilis.)  (Fun Fact: I was a Guide for about six months on Brell Serilis... a Troll bard named Tovarax Two Tone.)<BR><BR>

Rich Satterwhite adds that Magi P`tasa will not be shown wielding the staff in his character model, even if he has it on him.  So now the only way to tell if he has the staff is to kill him.<BR><BR>

(Some irrelevant pedantry: The <SPAN class="npc">Ghoul Arch Magus</SPAN> (or is it <SPAN class="npc">Ghoul Archmagus</SPAN>?) in <SPAN class="zone">Lower Guk</SPAN> used to be called the <SPAN class="npc">Ghoul Arch Magi</SPAN>, until someone pointed out that "Magi" is the plural of "Magus".  I wonder of they'll fix Magi P`tasa to be "Magus P`tasa".)<BR><BR>

<BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of <A href="http://www.magecompendium.com" target="_top">The Mage Compendium</A></DIV><BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Slixin Klex</SPAN> is an undead level 50 Iksar warrior who spawns in the meteor crater in the <SPAN class="zone">Burning Wood</SPAN>.  He rarely drops the <SPAN class="item">Dirt of Underfoot</SPAN>, so you'll probably have to kill him numerous times to get it.<BR><BR>

There's numerous ways to kill him.  It's possible for a properly-leveled magician to solo Klex; basically you recast your pet every time it dies, and then damage shield it.  Klex has low resists so your earth pet can keep him rooted while you meditate nearby.  Having as much +INT and +mana gear as possible makes this easier, for obvious reasons, as do the caster focus items introduced since the Luclin expansion.<BR><BR>

It's also possible to kite Klex, if you have a druid or necromancer helping you.  In any event, you'll want to pull Klex out of his crater, onto the flat area to the south.  Fighting him in the crater is inadvisable, due to the large number of hornets who wander the area.  The area to the south is usually free of mobs.<BR><BR>

<TABLE class="npc"><TR><TD></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Jinalis Andir</SPAN> can be found in <SPAN class="zone">Dagnor's Cauldron</SPAN>.

She is an Erudite female wearing a blue robe.<BR><BR>

According to Harryy of The Tribunal, it's possible to multiquest this.  He claims he did it with a friend.  The friend had the Water Staff, and Harryy had the Rain and Tears.  The friend first handed the Water Staff to Jinalis, and hit trade.  Then Harryy handed the Rain and Tears to Jinalis, and received the Element of Water.  I wouldn't advise multiquesting at any stage along the way, but this is at least one confirmation that it's possible.  (This was done back in early June of 2003, so there's no guarantee it's still possible.)<BR><BR>

In any event, once you turn in the items, Jinalis then gives you the Element of Water.<BR><BR>

<A name="waterstaff"></A><SPAN class="minorhead">+ Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water<BR>(<B>Kedge Keep</B>: "Phinigel Autropos", very (?) rare drop)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of <A href="http://www.magecompendium.com" target="_top">The Mage Compendium</A></DIV><BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Phinigel Autropos</SPAN> is in the very bottom of <SPAN class="zone">Kedge Keep</SPAN>, but you don't necessarily need to clear mobs to get to him.  Chard of Bertoxxulous tells me that a magician can easily invis himself and swim to the entrance of Phinny's room, and nothing will aggro (I haven't tested this myself).  From there, if he's 55+, he can simply use <SPAN class="spell">Call of the Hero</SPAN> to summon his raid party down to him.  A similar method can work for <SPAN class="npc">Undertow</SPAN> but I'm not sure where you'd COH to -- maybe the small square room just south of the chapel where Undertow lives.<BR><BR>

As far as fighting the boss fish himself, I have no idea how difficult it is, as I've never personally fought him, but he's routinely killed by 1-2 high-level groups, so I gather he's not all that bad, assuming you get him alone.  His guardians will cast <SPAN class="spell">Complete Healing</SPAN> a lot, and can ruin your day.  When I was a Guide on Brell Serilis, I once watched a 3-group raid of 55+ characters get wiped out because their puller accidentally brought 3 <SPAN class="npc">Swirlspine Guardians</SPAN> to play at once.<BR><BR>

Chard also suggests that if you like, you can park a level 1 ranger in the entrance to Kedge, and a measly level 1 ranger with minimal Tracking can cover the entire zone, and tell if Phinny is up.  The only problem is keeping him breathing underwater, but if you can find an excess <SPAN class="spell">Enduring Breath</SPAN> item (and they've proliferated a lot since the old days), you can equip him and leave him there.<BR><BR>

The <SPAN class="item">Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water</SPAN> is itself a very rare drop.  Expect to kill Phinigel multiple times before seeing the Staff.  Phinigel also drops a number of epic pieces for other classes' epic quests, so you probably won't have much trouble finding people who want to kill him.<BR><BR>

<A name="rain"></A><SPAN class="minorhead">* Rain of Karana<BR>(<B>East Karana</B>: "Tarbul Earthstrider", always drop)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Tarbul Earthstrider</SPAN> is a named hill giant found in the <SPAN class="zone">Eastern Plains of Karana</SPAN>.  He roams the large rocky hill in the southern half of EK.  He's a very rare spawn, and has a placeholder called <SPAN class="npc">a rogue lion</SPAN>.  The approximate spawn rate for Tarbul is 1 in 20, with the rogue lion spawning the other 95% of the time.  You may have to spend quite some time camping the hill before you see Tarbul.  Apparently, though, Tarbul drops the <SPAN class="item">Rain of Karana</SPAN> every time he dies.  (Thanks to Theisovian Qithetal of Ayonae Ro and Prymas Magnate of Luclin for the info on Tarbul's spawn rate; the rates used to be reversed, with Tarbul spawning 95% of the time, and the rogue lion only spawning 5% of the time).  The rogue lion is very low level, and is trivial to kill.  You might want to bring a tracker along to speed up finding it when it spawns.<BR><BR>

Nintalten Legbiter adds, "Trabul [sic] Earthstrider is a piece of cake with a lvl 49 Earth pet and a lvl 44 cleric.  That's how I did it :)"  Apparently if your level 49 earth pet beats on Tarbul, and you have a cleric cast <SPAN class="spell">Complete Heal</SPAN> on your pet every so often, Tarbul will go down fairly quickly.  Any 55+ magician with decent equipment should be able to solo Tarbul; you might need to chain-cast your pets to do it, depending on what spells and gear you have.<BR><BR>

Note that sometimes, Tarbul and the other hill giants that spawn on the hill can get stuck beneath the world.  If you think this is happening, petition a Guide and they should be able to come and kill off the offending giant.  Also, if you're a tailor (or know one), you can pass the time by hunting the spiders which infest the hill.  They drop a fair number of spider silks.<BR><BR>

According to Gerboli of Povar, Tarbul and the rogue lion both appear to be on a six-minute recycle timer.<BR><BR>

When I went to take the below screenshot, I was level 49.  I was also invisible and TARBUL WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE THROUGH INVIS.  I don't know if this will hold true at lower levels, but it did then!  I didn't stand there gawking at him; I just took the screenshot and then left, so even though he CONNED indifferent while I was invisible, I didn't test it by waiting for him to aggro.<BR><BR>

<A name="tears"></A><SPAN class="minorhead">+ Tears of Erollisi<BR>(<B>The Overthere</B>: "Captain Rottgrime", always drop)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>

I joined up with a group of people from various guilds who had banded together in <SPAN class="zone">the Overthere</SPAN> to get <SPAN class="npc">Captain Rottgrime</SPAN> dead, dead, dead, dead.  In fact, they got him four times, and the fourth time, the <SPAN class="item">Tears of Erollisi</SPAN> went to me.  Killing the Captain isn't hard, you just need lots of tanks and clerics.  Casters who have pets can help, but I don't think any other spells will be useful against him.<BR><BR>

These days, players are so much more powerful that Rottgrime is fairly insignificant.  One report showed a 63 ranger, 54 mage and 49 cleric taking on Rottgrime.  Just remember that there's a whole group of undead Iksar guarding him, so be careful not to pull them all.  Your local monks should have some idea how to bring Rottgrime out alone.<BR><BR>

Rottgrime is usually standing near the southeast corner of the Outpost, within the walls, along with six undead marines, who are each level 50.  There are many ways to pull him, and given the ever-changing nature of pulling technology, I'll only list some basic methods.<BR><BR>

You will take a HUGE Venril Sathir faction hit for killing Rottgrime, so be careful if you're used to being able to travel safely through the Outpost (most evil races, for example).  It only takes four faction hits from him to go from Indifferent to Threatening in the Outpost (and to the rest of the Venril Sathir faction.)<BR><BR>

<A name="crown"></A><SPAN class="minorhead">+ Crown of Elemental Mastery<BR>(<B>Plane of Sky</B>: any island 7 mob, semi-rare or rare drop)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of <A href="http://www.magecompendium.com" target="_top">The Mage Compendium</A></DIV><BR>

This is a picture of the building on the 7th isle in the <SPAN class="zone">Plane of Sky</SPAN>.  You can probably make out a few of the drakes flying around above the island.  There are several kinds of mobs here: <SPAN class="npc">greater sphinxes</SPAN>, <SPAN class="npc">heartsbane drakes</SPAN>, <SPAN class="npc">fatestealer drakes</SPAN>, <SPAN class="npc">windrider drakes</SPAN>, and <SPAN class="npc">undine spirits</SPAN>.  According to Roshale of Xegony, the greater sphinxes have never been known to drop the <SPAN class="item">Crown of Elemental Mastery</SPAN>; it's always the drakes that drop it.  Oriestes of Xegony also says that the sphinxes have never dropped the crown, even when cleared out four days in a row.<BR><BR>

However, Xalmat of Brell Serilis says that he's seen every mob on the 7th isle drop the crown, except for the Sister of the Spire (but he says he's only killed her once).  He reconfirms that on another recent raid, two sphinxes each dropped a crown.<BR><BR>

Omanii Darkeyes of Antonius Bayle says that on a recent raid to the 7th isle, two crowns dropped: one from a drake, and another from a greater sphinx.  Vondo Starsight of Terris-Thule also says that a crown dropped from a greater sphinx on a recent Sky run.<BR><BR>

<BR>

The mobs on the 7th isle range from 55-60 or so.  The greater sphinxes will DEATHTOUCH every 45 seconds, so you're going to need a major raid party to even GET to the 7th isle, let alone clear it and get crowns.  The crowns, however, are NOT NODROP, which means that you can pray and hope that someone will have one for sale.  I wouldn't bet on it, though; people don't go to Sky much except to GET epic components for those who attend the raids, so it's unlikely that there'd be one just sitting around.<BR><BR>

Clearing the 7th isle will typically net between zero and three Crowns.<BR><BR>

<A name="binder"></A><SPAN class="minorhead">* Elemental Binder<BR>(<B>The Hole</B>: "an elemental warrior", common drop)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Elemental warriors</SPAN> are found right in the entrance hall of <SPAN class="zone">the Hole</SPAN>.  If you go in with a group, you can hunt these guys fairly safely for a couple of hours and you're likely to get an <SPAN class="item">Elemental Binder</SPAN> fairly soon.  These days, there are more Elemental Binders on a given server than there are epic-capable magicians, so you're likely to find them for dirt cheap in the Bazaar.  (Back in my day, the Binder cost 500-2000pp!)<BR><BR>

There's two ways to get into the Hole.  One is to have a high-level rogue pick the lock (the "lock" is actually a boulder in a pool in Paineel).  The other is to have good faction with the Paineel residents, and you can get a key there.  The easiest way to get your faction up with Paineel is to kill kobolds in the Warrens.  Since the Warrens is a low-level zone, a high-level mage can slaughter kobolds nonstop there.  Itchyban of Veeshan says he was killing 300-400 kobolds per hour, and it took about 1,300 kobold kills to get his Paineel faction to amiable (he's a High Elf worshipping Mithaniel Marr), so that he could get a key.<BR><BR>

There's actually a third way into the Hole: Jump into the huge pit at the entrance to Paineel.  This is inadvisable, however, since when you zone into the Hole this way, all levitation effects are stripped (so you will fall to your death), and even if you somehow manage to survive the fall, Master Yael may be waiting at the bottom -- and he deathtouches every 30 seconds.  I'd advise taking the front door.<BR><BR>

<A name="pegasus"></A><SPAN class="minorhead">* Pegasus Feather Cloak<BR>(<B>South Karana</B>: Quillmane, very rare drop)</SPAN><BR><BR>

<BR>
<DIV class="imgcred">Picture courtesy of <A href="http://www.magecompendium.com" target="_top">The Mage Compendium</A></DIV><BR>

<SPAN class="npc">Quillmane</SPAN> is a rare spawn, but he can spawn almost anywhere in the <SPAN class="zone">Southern Plains of Karana</SPAN>.  Most commonly he is found in the interior of the zone, away from the zone walls, but he can be out there, too.  He wanders almost constantly, and is killed almost instantly by any who see him (because the cloak you need for the quest is All/All and has unlimited charges of Levitate...).  This sucks, and it means it takes some real effort to get the <SPAN class="item">Pegasus Feather Cloak</SPAN>.<BR><BR>

Because Quillmane spawns randomly and wanders, the best way to get the cloak is to go to South Karanas with as many high level rangers and druids as you can gather.  More than 5 would be overkill, since you want to be grouped with them all.  Basically, what you should do is summon your pet of choice, get a SoW, and then run around the zone killing anything that wanders.  Static spawns like the Aviaks at their tower or the Tesch Mas Gnolls outside splitpaw, need not be killed (Quillmane doesn't spawn there, and there will always be people camping the Aviaks and Gnolls anyway).  Anything else that wanders -- centaurs, wolves, lions, elephants, aviaks, gnolls, treants (although there is a faction issue there) -- is fair game.  You want five trackers with you because they can always home in on a mob and kill it, and they can do this constantly -- the instant something shows up on tracking, they will go after it and kill it.  And the reason you want to be grouped is, if someone in your group does see Quillmane and kills him, then you will be able to get to the corpse and loot it before it opens up and some ninjalooter steals your cloak!<BR><BR>

Even one high-level tracker with you can make this an easy enough camp.  (To put it another way, one tracker tracking and killing mobs, and Quillmane when he pops, is better than wandering about hoping to encounter Quillmane by yourself!)  If you have even one or two ranger or druid friends who can help, then your life will become immeasurably easier.<BR><BR>

Nevertheless, even with your entire guild scouring the zone for Quillmane, expect to spend at least several hours on getting the cloak.  If you're doing it solo, then may Mithaniel Marr protect your sanity...<BR><BR>

James Whitehead sent the following email -- I haven't tested this theory myself but it sounds plausible:<BR><BR>

<DIV class="conv">
<SPAN class="npctalk">I have been working on the spawn cycles of Quillimane In South Karana lately and would like to share with my fellow EQ'ers what I have noted.   Quillimane seems to actually have placeholders as do most "named" mobs in everquest.  And in all actualality she seems to be the less rare of some of the "named" mobs.  Now it does appear there are atleast 2 different spawn cycles of the "named" mobs here.  Playing a tracker for 58 levels gives you a little insight into how this can work.  The following are are in Quillimanes spawn cycle,  any named gnoll, ie, shaman ren'rex, high shaman grisok,phido and lenrel do not kill brother drash, he is NOT in the cycle.  I am going to set up 3 spawn points the first spawn point 1 would be just south of the hermit, spawn point 2 will be north of the shadow men and finally spawn point 3 is west of paw, its very difficult to pin point any of these spawn points because as soon as anything spawns it starts moving immeidately.  I have been able to get Quillimane to spawn by running between these points and killing the "Named" spawns as they pop.  However Quillimane seems to only spawn at spawn point 1 from my experience, where she then starts moving towards paw where she is normally spotted and killed. I have killer her now maybe 15-20 times and have gotten the cloak once, sorry I am not a mage, however I am a druid who always runs out of batwings and loves the free wingless levitate effect.  There also seems to be many many named mobs in the zone which I am not totally sure if they are in on the cycle or not, seeing as I have my cloak I havent had time to research it anymore.  These named spawns would be cracktusk, grizzlenot, gnawfang, a rabid gnool,  mroon, some named druids and a barb that can drop a nice weight reduction bag.  I am not totally sure if any of these named ones are in the spawn cycle due to most of them being very rare,  I just stick to killing named gnolls and Quillimane will pop.  Good luck to everyone that needs this item, it is very rare and very nice for everyone to use.</SPAN><BR><BR>
</DIV>

Claryn Starcaster of Fennin Ro tells us that she used a mass-pull method to get Quillmane to spawn several times.  This involved having several AE casters in the group, and a couple of bards to run around and pull everything in SK that moves.  Static mobs (treehouse Aviaks, spire gnolls, etc.) were ignored, and she says they got two cloaks in three hours (and presumably several more Quillmane spawns that were not cloaks).  As always, having more people to help seems to make it easier -- just commit mass genocide, and you'll get your cloak in no time, apparently. :)<BR><BR>

Qaedain of Bertoxxulous devised an elaborate method for finding Quillmane.  He believes that killing the Tesch Mah gnolls that spawn outside Splitpaw causes six Escaped Splitpaw Gnolls to spawn.  Killing those results in certain semi-rare spawns to appear: High Shaman Phido, Shaman Ren'Rex, Shaman Grisok, An Undead Cyclops, A Cyclops, and Ghranex.  Killing those mobs (the "third tier") can trigger Quillmane, Gnashmaw, Grizzleknot, and Cracktusk.<BR><BR>

The upshot is that killing everything in the zone as often and rapidly as possible is probably the best way to ensure that Quillmane shows up.  You can focus on the mobs in the cycles above, but they have long respawn times and can appear all over the zone.<BR><BR>
