			<P>

			Today I ventured into Crushbone for the first time.  I have spent much time at the orc encampment to the north of Kelethin, rooting out and killing whatever orcs I could, but even that foul place still resides within the Greater Faydark.  The home of Clan Crushbone, though, is through a tunnel, separated entirely from the friendly pines of the forest.<P>

			Rusharack and I first approached the path to Crushbone apprehensively; it is up on the side of a hill, above a handful of orc tents.  There were four orcs guarding the entrance, two just inside the corridor and two further out, pacing back and forth.  We crouched behind a fallen log.<P>

			"I don't think we can take all four of them," Rusharack said.  "Not even with your pet."<P>

			I looked down at the small earth elemental that hovered at my side.  It was intent on the orcs before us, but I knew that Rusharack was right.  We would not be able to kill all four orcs.  "Well, my pet can almost certainly root and distract one.  Maybe even two.  But..."<P>

			"But what?" said an unfamiliar voice behind me.  Rusharack and I whirled, to find a petite wood elf, clad in green and brown, standing behind us.  "You don't think the <I>three</I> of us could kill those orcs?"<P>

			Rusharack glanced at me, raising an eyebrow.  "Are you offering to help?" he said.  She laughed.  "Of course.  I hate those orcs as much as you do.  They didn't invade <I>your</I> home, after all."<P>

			Rusharack shrugged.  "Still, those are big orcs.  What do you propose we do?"<P>

			The elf began waving her hands, and a blue flame issued forth.  A moment later, I felt... something... inhabit my body.  It was like a force, or a spirit.  My legs, especially, felt stronger.  "Run," the elf said.  "See how fast you move."<P>

			I commanded my pet to sit down, then turned and darted off into the forest.  And dart I did!  I was moving twice as fast as I could normally, speeding past trees, up and down the hills of the forest.  After a minute, I returned to the log.  "What manner of spell is this?" I asked.  "And who are you?"<P>

			"You have been infused with the Spirit of Wolf," she said, waving her hands again, and I saw the glow surround Rusharack, and then my pet.  The animate lump of dirt looked confused, but not upset.  "And with all of us, we can easily outrun those orcs.  And my name is Paksenarion.  I am a druid of the Faydark."<P>

			I nodded back.  "I am Teramenor, a magician, and this is Rusharack, a paladin of Brell Serilis."<P>

			Rusharack grunted.  "I'd rather kill the orcs than run from them."<P>

			The elf nodded.  "And we shall kill them.  We'll use Teramenor's pet to distract one of them -- and I will call the trees of the forest to trip up the beasts with their roots."<P>

			This druid certainly seemed to be versatile -- I hoped she would be able to keep the orcs distracted enough.  "All right then.  How shall we begin?"<P>

			"I know a way!" Rusharack shouted, and leapt over the log, charging at the orcs.  "Die, fiends!"<P>

			I groaned, and leapt over the log after the dwarf, commanding my pet to follow me.  Rusharack took a few perfunctory swings at the orcs, and they began chasing him back toward us.  I pointed at one of them.  "Kill it, Ganer!"  My pet waved his hands and the orc I had pointed at suddenly sank, ankle-deep, into the soil.  Its momentum pitched it forward, but it pulled itself upright and growled, unable to move.  Ganer leapt forward and swung with packed fists of dirt and stone.<P>

			Meanwhile, Rusharack was running in circles, taunting the two orcs following him, and easily keeping ahead.  I wondered where the last one went, when a shadow at my side compelled me to duck and run.  I felt the wind of the sword as it passed through where my head had been, and dashed off, running up the hillside faster than the orcs had run down it.<P>

			My assailant charged up at me, but not before I could chant words of summoning.  A cloud of daggers materalized with a red flash, and whirled about the orc, cutting it numerous times before dispelling.  The orc shrieked and fell to the ground, and rolled back down toward the rest of the melee.<P>

			I looked over at my pet; it was bashing and punching as hard as ever, though quite a bit of it had been chipped away by the orc with his axe.  The orc had almost worked his feet out of the ground, but then Ganer waved his hands again and the orc sunk even deeper, and let out another aggrieved shout.<P>

			Down at the base of the hill, Paksenarion stood still, watching.  The orc I had knocked over had stood up, but was somewhat dazed and unable to focus.  Suddenly, Rusharack ran past him, and the orc barely jumped aside to avoid being knocked over.  The other two orcs were heading straight at him.  Then Paksenarion moved her hands, and thousands of tiny ice pebbles shot out of the Faydark's mist, pelting all three orcs mercilessly.  Rusharack turned and leapt back at them, neatly beheading the first one, and easily dispatching the other two as they lay moaning on the ground.<P>

			Suddenly I sensed something was wrong.  I spun around to see my pet, now just a few clumps of dirt strung together by weeds, dissolve into dust as the orc's axe slashed into it.  The gray-skinned beast was badly bruised and bleeding, but still able to fight.  It was also pulling its feet from the ground.  As it broke free and ran at me, axe high -- Rusharack and Paksenarion were too far to do anything about it -- I chanted words of evocation, and a split-second before it could swing at me, a huge bolt of flame darted from my hands, exploding in the orc's face.  But too close to mine, also, as I was burned and flung backward by the burst.  The orc fell down, its face aflame, and died, but I felt not much better as I rolled to the bottom of the hill.  I felt something cover my face -- I assume it was one of my friends, damping flames -- and then my health improved immeasurably as Paksenarion stepped back and cast a healing spell of some kind.  My wounds vanished, although I still felt a little groggy.<P>

			Rusharack helped me up and I hobbled over to the log, and slumped against it.  "Well," he said, "that was a nice start.  Now let's get into Crushbone and see what there is to kill!"  No doubt he missed the scowl on my face as he started up the hill toward the orcs' home...<P>
