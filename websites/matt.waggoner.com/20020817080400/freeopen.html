			<b>What's the deal with this Free Open Source Software Linux thing?</b><br><br>

			A large number of people have, in the past decade, taken to the idea that it is a good thing if software is distributed along with its source code, and can be freely redistributed to other people, as long as the source code is included.<br><br>

			This makes the software "free" in two senses: "free" as in "costs no money," and "free" as in "you are free to do whatever you want with this software."<br><br>

			<b>Wait wait, what?  Free software?  You mean like freeware?  Freeware sucks!</b><br><br>

			No, not like freeware.  Freeware is simply software that costs no money; but it is rarely (if ever) also free as in free speech.  Free Software is software, such as the Apache web server, that anyone can take, modify, distribute, and sell for money (or even give away for no money if they feel like it).<br><br>

			<b>I don't get it.  How can you afford to give away software?  Ford doesn't give away cars!</b><br><br>

			The difference between Ford and, for example, the Apache web server software, is that the Apache costs virtually nothing to duplicate -- once you have a copy of Apache, you can make as many copies as you want by, well, copying the files on your computer.  And because the people who created Apache did so using a Free Software license (specifically, the GNU General Public License, or GPL), anyone who wants to can take the Apache software, modify the source code, and distribute that modified version -- they may even sell their modified version of Apache for money (any price they feel like charging!), as long as they follow the terms of the GNU General Public License.<br><br>

			<b>No, that can't be right.  Apache must be a piece of crap.</b><br><br>

			Actually, Apache is one of the fastest, most stable web servers in existence.  It and its variants also run nearly 60% of all websites (<a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">visit Netcraft's Web Server Survey for details</a>).<br><br>

			<b>I still don't understand.  If Apache really is as good as you claim, then how did the people who wrote it afford all the time and money it must have cost to put it together?</b><br><br>

			Apache was developed by numerous people -- and still is being improved and developed -- mostly in their spare time.  Visit <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache's website</a> for more details on this particular piece of software.<br><br>

			The point is, no one paid for it.  The people who wrote Apache did so because they wanted a stable, modifiable, fast, free web server, and went ahead and made one.<br><br>

			<b>No way.</b><br><br>

			Way.<br><br>

			<b>I still don't get it!  How is it possible for something as complex as a web server able to be put together by college students and other people working in their spare time?!  Don't you need a company with professional programmers to do something like that?</b><br><br>

			The method by which software like Apache and Linux are developed is something called <b>Open Source</b>.  This is not the same thing as Free Software; they are related but separate.  Open Source is the idea that you make the source code of your software available to the public --<br><br>

			<b>Say what?  If you give everyone the source code they can just steal the software without paying for it!</b><br><br>

			Like I said before, they aren't charging for the software, so it doesn't matter if people "steal" (or more accurately, copy) the source code.  They WANT the source code to be available to anyone who wants to look at it!<br><br>

			<b>Why?</b><br><br>

			Because if you only have the 10 programmers at your company look at a piece of software, then you are limited by the abilities of those 10 people.  If you make the source code available to anyone to use, then you suddenly have hundreds or thousands of people looking at the source code, for one reason or another.  And because they want the software to improve as much as the main developers do, they'll be sure to point out a bug they found, or even submit patch code themselves so you don't have to take the time.<br><br>

			<b>Well that sounds like a good thing.  I guess.  But wait, how can thousands of people possibly coordinate to write a piece of software?  Won't there be conflicts?</b><br><br>

			There would be, if thousands of people were allowed to directly modify the source code to a project; however no Open Source (OS) or Free Software (FS) project actually works like this.  Almost all projects have a small core of developers who are the main programmers for the project -- they do most of the primary code, as well as decide which of the submitted patches get used.<br><br>

			<b>So how is it "open" or "free" if only a small group of people actually get to work on the code?</b><br><br>

			This is a very common question about OS and FS, and is often used by opponents of OS/FS (or people who just don't get it yet) to try to denigrate the abilities of this development method.  So here's an explanation.<br><br>

			Let's take an example; the one I like to use is the OS/FS project <a href="http://www.freeamp.org">Freeamp</a>, which is a music player.  (It's kind of like Winamp, except Winamp is owned by AOL and is neither Free nor Open.  It's free in the beer sense -- you can download it for no charge; but it's not free in the freedom sense, meaning that you can't modify the source code or redistribute it to others.)  Freeamp only has a handful of developers who are allowed to commit changes to the source tree.  So the question is, how is that free or open?  Well, Freeamp's source code is freely available to the public, in its entirety.  ANYONE is allowed to download an entire copy of the source code and do with it what they want.  Which means that if I don't like the direction Freeamp is going, I can go download the source tree, change all the instances of "Freeamp" to, say, "MattAmp", and start my own project.  Because of the license Freeamp is developed under (the aforementioned GPL), I am allowed to do this.  I am allowed to modify the Freeamp source, distribute the modified source, and so on.<br><br>

			<b>Let me see if I've got this straight.  Even though only a small number of people can actually make changes to a particular project, the openness/freeness comes from the fact that anyone is allowed to take all the work that's been done so far, and start their own project?</b><br><br>

			Exactly.<br><br>

			<b>What's the difference between Free Software and Open Source?</b><br><br>

			This question requires a little bit of background.  In 1984, Richard M. Stallman founded the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>.  The goal of the FSF was to create an entirely Free operating system called GNU.  You can find out more about this at the FSF page; I won't try to repeat it all.<br><br>

			The upshot was, Stallman created the GNU General Public License (GPL), and all of the FSF's software was released under the GPL.  The FSF went about creating all manner of common Unix-like utilities; "ls" and "ps" and "top" and just about every Unix utility program you can think of -- almost everything necessary to have a full, Unix-like operating system.<br><br>

			The GPL basically says the following.  If you release a piece of software under the GPL, it means that if you release compiled binaries of the software (a regular compiled .exe program, for example), you must ALSO make available the source code to everyone to whom you made available the binaries.  It also says that any code derived from GPL code, also falls under the GPL.  (If you write a piece of code completely from scratch, and use it with a GPL'd program (or use a GPL'd program to compile it), it does NOT "convert" to the GPL.)  There's some more details but that's the gist of it; again, go to the FSF's web page for the full scoop.<br><br>

			As time went on, people who were not interested in making software for the sake of money (students, professors, and these days a lot of regular working folks) began developing more and more software under the GPL and similar Free Software licenses.  In 1991 a project began, started by a Finnish college student named Linus Torvalds.  The project: Linux.<br><br>

			<b>Are you getting to the difference between Free Software and Open Source or is this a history lesson?</b><br><br>

			I'm getting there, but I can't explain the difference without providing some background.<br><br>

			As the 1990s wore on, Linux became closer and closer to a real operating system.  Eventually, by 1993 or so, you could actually use it for some decent tasks.  By the new millennium, it was nearly as full-featured an operating system as any other.  The entire Linux kernel and almost every program that comes with a Linux distribution, was released under the GPL.<br><br>

			Open Source, as a movement, was something (theoretically) invented in 1998, not by anyone in particular, although Eric S. Raymond (ESR) is often credited with being one of the founders of the movement.<br><br>

			Now to explain the difference.<br><br>

			<b>Yay!</b><br><br>

			<b>Free Software</b> is the idea that users of software should have the power to modify software to suit their needs; to make the software work for THEM instead of the software being controlled by a company whose best interests are making money, and not whether or not you have the software you need.<br><br>

			<b>Open Source</b> is really the method behind many Free Software projects.  The idea is that the source code is open and available to the public, DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.  This means that anyone can contribute, bugs can be found quicker, and development is spread over hundreds or thousands of people instead of just a handful.  An Open Source project does not have to be Free Software, but it's effectively impossible to have a Free Software project that isn't Open Source.<br><br>

			FS and OS have, in my opinion, more or less merged in the last couple of years.  RMS is against non-Free software because without the GPL's main restriction (that you must redistribute modified source if you distribute a binary), things like the BSD license can occur.  (The BSD license is different from the GPL in that the BSD license does NOT require you to distribute the source code to the software if you modify it.  You can take a BSD-license program, take a bunch of the source code, and use it in your closed-source program, then sell the program, and you are NOT required by the license to release the source code to your program.  The problem is that you are able to take from the community without giving anything back.)  However, FS and OS have, like many phrases in the English language before them, both become corrupted.  OS never had One True Meaning; it was more of a collective phrase to refer to the FS/OS phenomenon in the late '90s.  FS, on the other hand, is something strongly defined by RMS.<br><br>

			The vast majority of OS projects out there are under the GPL.  Personal issues with the GPL cause some people to use other licenses like the BSD license, but if you're interested in your software being as open and reliable as possible, the GPL is the way to go.<br><br>
			
			There's also a major schism between those who favor the BSD license and those who favor the GPL.  The BSD side says that the GPL restricts the rights of software developers because it requires them to distribute the source code.  The GPL side says, that's exactly the point!  Users are more important than developers; users need more of the power when it comes to who can do what with software.<br><br>

			<b>Whew... okay... I think I'm finally getting this.  What other advantages does OS/FS have over, say... well what's the opposite of OS/FS?</b><br><br>

			The opposite of Open Source would be, not surprisingly, Closed Source.  There's no good opposite of "Free" unfortunately, so the opposite of Free Software is usually called Non-Free Software.  But for our purposes, we can just call it Closed Source (CS).<br><br>

			CS software is stuff like Windows, Microsoft Office, Photoshop, Mac OS, Oracle, almost all games, and the majority of programs that have been historically available.  All of this software has been developed by companies that were doing it for money, not because they wanted that software so they could use it, or because of any attempts to make the world a better place.  CS software's source code is NOT available to the public; the only way to ever see it is to either be a programmer for the company, or to buy a license to see the source code (usually for thousands of dollars, if not millions in some cases).<br><br>

			<b>So what's wrong with that?  Those companies do pretty well.</b><br><br>

			The problem with CS software is that because the source code is not available, then if you discover a bug in the program, there is usually nothing you can do about it.  You are forced to wait until the vendor releases a bug fix for that bug.  Commercial vendors, on average, do not have a particularly good track record when it comes to fixing bugs.  Microsoft deliberately leaves a certain amount of bugs in their software as a business practice; every so often they release a Service Pack for their various large pieces of software (Windows NT, BackOffice, etc.), that will fix a number of bugs but usually introduce many more.<br><br>

			Essentially, CS software is good for the companies that write it, but is bad for users.  FS is good for users, but more or less goes against the main tenet of CS software companies, as they have no control over how users use it.<br><br>

			In an open source environment, you HAVE THE SOURCE CODE.  If you find a bug, you can fix it yourself; or if you aren't a programmer, odds are, someone else will already have fixed it, and submitted a patch back to the developers, who will then include that patch into the source tree.  OS projects tend to fix bugs far faster than CS projects, because patches can be applied to the software you have, and it is not in an OS project's interest to keep you locked-in to their software by constantly forcing upgrades.  Because of this, OS projects tend to be more stable than CS projects.<br><br>

			There's practical issues as well.  I can't go more than a week without having to reboot my Windows 98 box at home because it has memory leaks, becomes unstable, and eventually starts going insane (yeah, I know Win2K and WinXP are more stable, but I'm not contributing any more money to Microsoft, nor am I interested in using their crappy software any more than necessary). By contrast, my Linux box at work has not been rebooted in 81 days as of this writing, and that number would have been over 350 if we hadn't had a power outage 81 days ago.<br><br>
