						<span class="msieDoesntConformToStandards">Before we begin, I want to mention something.  If this text appears the same as the below text that begins "Matt is a graduate..." and you are using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, then you are probably using version 6, in which they FINALLY fixed a bug that has existed since version 3, that prevented tables from inheriting the default font size of the main document.  IE 5.5 still had this bug, so if this text is smaller than the "Matt is a graduate..." text, then you are probably using IE 5.5 or earlier.  I'd tell you to upgrade to 6.0, but Microsoft is evil -- so go get <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_top">Mozilla</a> instead.</span><br><br>

						Matt is a graduate of UCLA's School of Engineering and Appliances -- erm, Applied Sciences, with a degree in Computer Science.  That's right, it's a Bachelor of Science degree, which I will not abbreviate here.  Matt has already made billions of dollars selling people things they don't need. His interests include skydiving, extreme fencing, corporate takeovers, and world domination. He is a card-carrying member of the DNRC (in which he is the Minister of Pants) as well as Mensa's Secret Society of Inner Circle Weirdos, the Nobel Prize Committee, and the Imperial Naval Academy.  Matt also makes extensive use of the Orbital Mind-Control Lasers, and is also the Archbishop of Boelter Hall.  Matt is currently planning a subversive, hostile takeover of the Los Angeles municipal government.  You will know he has succeeded when you realize, one day, that <i>nothing has changed...</i><br><br>

						Matt also ran a single-line bulletin board system called The Death Star, which was active for five years before he shut it down on its fifth birthday, April 29, 1997.  It was one of the oldest single-line BBSes in Los Angeles before its demise.  Ah, those were the days... if you were formerly a member of TDS, feel free to drop me an email to reminisce about old mimes.  Er, times.<br>
