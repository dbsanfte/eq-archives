			<span class="h2b">What does "agnostic" mean?</span><br><br>

			In about 1870, British scientist Thomas H. Huxley coined the word "agnostic".  It was formed from the prefix "a-" meaning "not" or "without" (as in atypical, amoral, asymmetrical, etc.) and "gnosis", a Greek word meaning "knowledge," or more specifically "higher, esoteric knowledge of spiritual things."  Huxley believed that it was wrong to claim to have knowledge you could not possibly have.  Knowledge of the spiritual (or supernatural), such as knowledge about gods, falls into this category.  So originally, an agnostic was someone who believed that it <i>cannot be known</i> whether there are gods.<br><br>

			This is separate from an actual belief in gods.  It is possible for someone to be both atheist and agnostic, or both theist and agnostic.  It is possible to have faith in the existence of gods, but to also believe that you cannot know whether gods exist.  I use "know" here to mean the same thing as, "I know that I'm reading this," or "I know I am made of atoms," or "I know the sun shines."<br><br>

			More recently the word has come to be commonly used to define someone who is merely unsure about <i>whether they believe in gods</i>.  A modern "agnostic" does not necessarily have an opinion on whether it can be <i>known</i> that there are gods.<br><br>

			I am agnostic in the original sense; since gods are, by definition, supernatural, and since the supernatural is, by definition, that which lies outside the natural realm.  Since the only tools at our disposal are those in the natural realm, if there is a supernatural realm, we would by defintion be unable to detect it.<br><br>
