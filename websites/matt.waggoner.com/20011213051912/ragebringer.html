<SPAN CLASS="secthead">NOTES</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">The Planes</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Plane of Hate is not connected to any other zone through normal means; you cannot zone into Hate the same way you zone from West Freeport to East Commonlands.  There is only one way to get to the Plane of Hate: the level 46 wizard spell "Alter Plane: Hate".  This spell teleports the wizard and his group to the port-in house in the Plane of Hate.  Note that it uses up a reagant ("a Fulligrans Soulstone") which cost over 200pp each.<BR><BR>

Also, note that you <B>MUST BE LEVEL 46 OR HIGHER TO BE TELEPORTED INTO THE PLANE OF HATE!</B>  For this reason it is not recommended that you visit Hate until you are at least level 47, since if you lose your level and drop to 45 while you are in Hate, you may not be able to get back there to recover your corpse.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Other Notes</SPAN><BR><BR>

Most NPCs in the quest will not speak to you if you are level 49 or below.  You may still acquire some of the components for the quest, but wait on handing them in until you are level 50 or higher.<BR><BR>

To get Ragebringer, you must turn in the "Cazic Quill", the "Jagged Diamond Dagger", and the "General's Pouch" to Stanos Herkanor in Highpass Hold.  Acquiring each of these three items requires a great deal of work (though not nearly so much as the other epic quests!).<BR><BR>

</OL>

<A NAME="detail"></A><SPAN CLASS="bighead">- DETAILED STEPS -</SPAN><BR><BR>

<A NAME="founy"></A><SPAN CLASS="secthead">1. Pickpocket the Stained Parchment Top<BR>(North Kaladim - Founy Jestands)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to the Dwarven city of Kaladim, and head into its northern section.  There, locate Founy Jestands outside the bank and pickpocket the "Stained Parchment Bottom" from him.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kaladim is located on the north wall of the Butcherblock Mountains, which are located on the western end of the continent of Faydwer.  A great statue of a dwarven king stands astride the city gates, which lead to South Kaladim.  Once inside the city, head north through the entry gate, then turn left and head past some shop buildings.  Stay to the right wall, and you will find a zone connection to North Kaladim.  Once you zone in, head along the passage a short ways until you see the following room:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/north_kaladim.jpg" ALT="North Kaladim">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/founy_jestands.jpg" ALT="Founy Jestands"></SPAN><BR>

Founy should always be standing there unless he has recently been killed.  (Even if he is trained to another part of the zone, he will walk back to his normal spot immediately.)<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Pickpocketing the Parchment</SPAN><BR><BR>

Founy despawns and respawns every game day at 10 am game time.  He does NOT always spawn with the "Stained Parchment Top", so you may have to wait, or come back for another visit later.  The simplest way to get the parchment piece from him is to pickpocket it, so you should definitely max your pickpocket skill to 200 before attempting to steal the piece.<BR><BR>

Killing Founy is another option, but he hits for around 140 and probably backstabs for a lot more -- additionally, many other dwarves in the area will aggro if you attack him, so it can be quite a task to kill him.  You're probably better off just pickpocketing him.  (If you are level 53 or higher, and he aggroes on you, you can activate one of your defensive disciplines, like Counterattack or Nimble, to defend yourself while you flee the short distance to the zone line.)<BR><BR>

As Kaladim is full of dwarves, any players who are KOS in Kaladim will need to use SH to get to Founy.  Once you are near him, stand behind him and pickpocket him until you are convinced he does not have the piece (how many attempts you make before you are "convinced" is up to you -- in my opinion, if he doesn't have it after 20 attempts, I'd give up and come back later), or until you pickpocket the piece from him.<BR><BR>

It took me 2 trips to Kaladim to get the Stained Parchment Top from Founy.  My pickpocket skill was 200 before I attempted to PP him, and he never aggroed on me.<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/siam_item_spt.jpg" ALT="Item: Stained Parchment Top"><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Siamese of Rodcet Nife</SPAN><BR>

Founy has other dialogue, but this is the only relevant bit:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="conv">
<SPAN CLASS="pctalk">You say, 'What note?'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">Founy Jestands says 'I don't know what you're talking about, if you know what I mean.'  Founy fingers his belt pouch.  'You should leave now, if you know what's good for you.  Don't make me sic the crew on you.</SPAN><BR>
</SPAN><BR>

<BR>

<A NAME="tani"></A><SPAN CLASS="secthead">2. Pickpocket the Stained Parchment Bottom<BR>(Neriak Third Gate - Tani N`mar)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to the Dark Elf city of Neriak, and head into its deepest region, the Third Gate.  There, locate Tani N`mar at the rogue guild and pickpocket the "Stained Parchment Bottom" from him.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Neriak is located in the very northeast corner of Nektulos Forest, itself north of East Commonlands on the east side of the continent of Antonica.  Neriak is divided into three sub-zones: you must travel through the Neriak Foreign Quarter and then the Neriak Commons to reach the Neriak Third Gate.  To get to the rogue guild, enter N3G and head past the cleric guild and pool of water, down to the main part of the city.  Angle right as you go through the main gate, and you will see the rogue guild.  Enter the rogue guild from the front door, turn right at the bottom of the entry stairs, and then turn right again and follow the path until you see Tani:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/neriak3g.jpg" ALT="Neriak Rogue Guild">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/tani_nmar.jpg" ALT="Tani N`mar"></SPAN><BR>

Dark Elves are somewhat less friendly than Dwarves, so unless you are yourself a Dark Elf, getting to Tani may be difficult.  The easiest way is to get the "Mask of Deception" from the Ghoul Assassin in Lower Guk, which has a right-click effect of "Illusion: Dark Elf" and lets you pass as a Dark Elf in their home city.  However, if you cannot acquire a Mask of Deception, or have ruined your faction with one of the Dark Elf factions to the point where you cannot pass through the city safely, you will need to use SH to make your way to Tani.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Pickpocketing the Parchment</SPAN><BR><BR>

Once you are there, simply pickpocket Tani (read the guidelines above in the Founy section for details) until you get the Stained Parchment Bottom.  Again, it may take several trips, so stop by whenever you are in the area.  It personally took me 4 trips to get the parchment.<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/siam_item_spb.jpg" ALT="Item: Stained Parchment Bottom"><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Siamese of Rodcet Nife</SPAN><BR>

Tani says a few things, but the relevant text is:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="conv">
<SPAN CLASS="pctalk">You say, 'What note?'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">Tani N`Mar says 'Oh, you want that piece of paper Stanos was so hot after?'  He taps his belt pouch.  'Well, it's mine now, though it looks like ogre scratch to me. You're not getting it, Stanos is not getting it, and Hanns is not getting it.  It is MINE!  Now, Soandso , scamper off like the dog you are, before I decide I need more practice with these short swords!'</SPAN><BR>
</SPAN><BR>

<BR>

<A NAME="hate"></A><SPAN CLASS="secthead">3. Get the Book of Souls<BR>(Plane of Hate)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to the otherworldly Plane of Hate, and find the Book of Souls on the Maestro of Rancor's nightstand.  Steal it, and return to Norrath.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Book of Souls is simply sitting on a table in the Plane of Hate.  It has a spawn time of 10 hours, so if someone has recently, erm, "acquired" it, you may need to wait a while.  Waiting while in the Plane of Hate is not really very safe, as there are a large number of wandering monsters that are very powerful and can even see through your SH ability.  The safest way to get to the Book is to travel to Hate with a normal raid party, wait until the raid clears the Maestro's building and kills the Maestro (assuming he's up), and then run upstairs and go get the book.  Just click on it to pick it up.<BR><BR>

The book can be seen in the following picture, on the table on the right side:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/hate_room.jpg" ALT="Maestro's bedroom">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/hate_book.jpg" ALT="Book of Souls on the table"></SPAN><BR>

This is the southwest corner of the second floor of the Maestro's building.  This picture is facing southwest.<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/ever_item_bos.jpg" ALT="Item: Book of Souls"><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="imgcred">Picture courtesy of Evertorrn Darkheart of Veeshan</SPAN><BR>

<BR>

<A NAME="combine"></A><SPAN CLASS="secthead">4. Combine the Parchments<BR>(Highpass Hold - Stanos Herkanor)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to Highpass Hold, halfway between the cities of Freeport and Qeynos on the continent of Antonica, and locate Stanos Herkanor.  Give him the "Stained Parchment Top" and "Stained Parchment Bottom", and he will give you the "Combined Parchment".<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Highpass Hold is accessible from Kithicor Forest in the east, and the Eastern Plains of Karana in the west.  Roughly in the center of the zone is a hidden smuggler's camp; find your way to the Tiger's Roar inn and bar, and outside you will see this:<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/hhp_secret.jpg" ALT="Highpass secret passage"><BR>

Circled in red is the location of the secret underwater passage (it's very short, there's no breathing problems) to the smuggler's camp.  Swim through it, and follow the path, and you will come to the following area:<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" CLASS="a" SRC="rb/hhp_camp.jpg" ALT="Highpass smuggler's camp"><BR>

On the left is the path leading back to the underwater area, and to the right is the small cavern where Stanos is located.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Spawning Stanos</SPAN><BR><BR>

However, it's not that simple.  Normally, Stanos never spawns -- you must deal with Anson McBale to get him to spawn.  Anson is located in the same room that Stanos spawns in:<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/anson_mcbale.jpg" ALT="Anson McBale"><BR>

But again, it's not that simple.  Anson himself is not always up: he has a placeholder, confusingly enough called "a smuggler", just like all the other "a smuggler" NPCs in the camp (there are around a dozen).  Anson's placeholder will be standing exactly where Anson is in that picture, and he will con blue to anyone around level 50.  The other smuggler, standing behind him, will con green (you can see this irrelevant smuggler in the picture above).<BR><BR>

A level 60 warrior with epic weapons and gear from the Temple of Veeshan cannot reasonably solo Anson's placeholder, though said 60 warrior and a 51 rogue can kill him fairly easily.  The simplest method is to have the level 60 warrior pull the placeholder into the yard outside Anson's room, and run across the yard to the ramp that leads up to a ledge overlooking High Keep.  The placeholder CAN get stuck in pathing in the yard, so make sure he follows you all the way across.  Once he does, jump down off the ledge, run to the High Keep entrance, and wait.  The smuggler will eventually path to there, and you can fight him and kill him.  The High Keep guards will not assist the smuggler, nor will they assist you, so it's a straight fight.  (If your faction with High Keep guards is bad, however, they may attack you on general principle, so you'll need to pull the smuggler to somewhere else.  Keep in mind that there are other blue smugglers in the area, and fighting them all can be difficult, not to mention the fact that you lose faction with Anson for killing them!  This is the reason you want a level 60 to pull the smuggler; if you aggro all the blue smugglers, you have to fight all of them.  You could bring an enchanter, too...)  The Anson spawn has an 18 minute spawn time, and you may need to kill the smuggler multiple times to get Anson to spawn.<BR><BR>

Once you have Anson spawned, there are two ways to get Stanos to spawn.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Method One</SPAN><BR><BR>

The first method is to walk up to Anson and have the following short conversation:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="conv">
<SPAN CLASS="pctalk">You say, 'I need to see Stanos'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">Anson McBale says 'This better be important. </SPAN><BR>
</SPAN><BR>

This will cause Stanos to spawn immedately.  I don't know what the minimum faction is for this to work, but I do know that if you are indifferent or better to Anson, Stanos will spawn.  Anson, Stanos, and all the other smugglers are on the CarsonMcCabe faction, and the easiest way to raise that faction is to kill the orcs and gnolls that live in Highpass, and turn in their scalps to Captain Ashlan and Captain Orben, respectively.  You can also kill the pickclaw goblins that live in High Keep's basement, and turn in their left ears (4 at a time, I believe) to Captan Bosec in High Keep.<BR><BR>

Chaid of Drinal says that, as an agnostic Dwarven rogue, he was able to use the above phrase to spawn Stanos when Anson conned DUBIOUS to Chaid.  Assuming this is true, then unless you're KOS to Anson, there is no reason to get the pouch from Malka (Method Two, below).<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Method Two</SPAN><BR><BR>

The second method to get Stanos to spawn can be done regardless of your faction (well, unless you're KOS, then it's a bit difficult obviously), but is more work.  Travel to the Qeynos Aqueduct System beneath the city of Qeynos, and find Malka Rale.  She will give you "Stanos's Pouch", which you can then give to Anson, causing Stanos to spawn.  BE CAREFUL DOING THIS!  If you are standing on Stanos's spawn point when you give the pouch to Anson, Stanos will not spawn, so you should stand behind Anson, preferably on the table in the corner, when you hand him the pouch.<BR><BR>

To get to Malka Rale's room, enter the QAS from the secret entrance outside the gates of Qeynos.  Once you zone into the QAS, follow the path shown on the map below:<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/qcat_map.gif" ALT="Qeynos Aqueducts Map"><BR>

The gray sections of the map lead off to other, irrelevant areas.<BR><BR>

Malka's room looks like this:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/qcat_room.jpg" ALT="Malka's room">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/malka_rale.jpg" ALT="Malka Rale"></SPAN><BR>

In the left picture above, we see the room where Malka spawns.  Highlighted is her placeholder, "a courier".  DO NOT KILL THE COURIER!  He will despawn around 9pm game time, and Malka will spawn at 10pm game time, every game day (Malka despawns around 7am).  Once Malka spawns, have the following conversation:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="conv">
<SPAN CLASS="pctalk">You say, 'Hail, Malka Rale'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">Malka Rale says 'Whew!  I thought you were one of Hanns' goons.  These sewers are a mess, you never know what is going to turn up next.  I really wish I could get out of here. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="pctalk">You say, 'I will help'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">Malka Rale says 'Ok!  I am trusting you.  Take this pouch to Vilnius in West Karana. Last word I had from him, he was hanging out near one of the bandit camps.  Be careful, since he does not know you.  Just give him the pouch, and tell him I was.. delayed. &lt;grin&gt;  While you are doing that, I will be thinking of a way to get out of this slimehole.  With any luck, the Circle will learn the pouch is out of Qeynos, and will assume I got away.  That means they won't be looking for me here. </SPAN><BR>
</SPAN><BR>

Malka then gives you an item called "Stanos' Pouch", which can be placed inside of other containers (i.e. it is not itself a container).  It appears to have a right-click effect of "Summon: Throwing Daggers", but it has 0 charges and cannot be recharged.<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/item_sp.jpg" ALT="Item: Stanos' Pouch"><BR>

Give this pouch to Anson McBale to make Stanos spawn.  BE CAREFUL DOING THIS!  If you are standing on Stanos' spawn point when you hand in the pouch, Stanos will immediately despawn!  You should stand on the table behind Anson when you give him Stanos' Pouch.<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/stanos.jpg" ALT="Stanos Herkanor"><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Talking to Stanos</SPAN><BR><BR>

In either event, once Stanos spawns, you can have the following conversation:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="conv">

<SPAN CLASS="pctalk">You say, 'Tell me your story'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">Stanos Herkanor says 'Johann Krieghor was the leader of the Circle and I was his second-in-command.  He made a dark bargain  with a  Teir'dal General.  The Circle was to assassinate Joren,  the high elf ambassador to Qeynos.  Had the plot worked, it would have weakened the alliance between high elves and humans, and possibly  caused a war between the two powers.  In either case, the Teir'Dal would have profited greatly by this event, and all others would have suffered.  I could not stand by and let this happen, but Johann would not be deterred, for the Teir'Dal had promised him much.  I had no choice but to kill Johann and the Teir'Dal agent.  I made it look like they offed each other, and then I hid the tools. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="pctalk">You say, 'What tools?'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">Stanos Herkanor says 'To allow the assassin to slay a prince, and fight his way back out, a fell blade was crafted.  It was small enough to conceal under a garment and yet large enough to strike a mortal blow through armor.  Aided by vile Teir'Dal enchantments, it is much more fearsome than it appears.  I would glady rid myself of it, but I fear I can not until I clear my name with Hanns. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="pctalk">You say, 'I will clear your name'</SPAN><BR><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">Stanos Herkanor says 'I need proof that what I say about Johann is truth, so that Hanns may forgive me.   YOU can gather that proof for me.  First, travel to Kaladim and Neriak, and there, upon the persons of the rogue guildmasters, you should find that which I seek, two parts of a document I recovered from the dead agent.  I entrusted one to Founy, but that trust is gone, and Founy would betray me to Hanns were I to attempt to reclaim it.  Tani N'mar has the other, which he should not possess, and keeps it only to spite me, not knowing its real import.  Steal them both, and bring them back to me.  And don't let anyone follow you!

Lake Rathetear is located south of the Southern Plains of Karana, and west of Rathe Mountains.  Once you are in the zone, head to the northeast island which is located approximately at (+2600, -500).  On the island is a large tower, inside of which you will find Eldreth:<BR><BR>

Give him the "Combined Parchment", 100 platinum pieces, and 2 bottles of milk.  (Do NOT stack the bottles of milk together; make sure they are SEPARATE when you hand them in.  It is not known whether this matters, but no one has volunteered to test it so far.)  Eldreth says the following:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Steamfont Mountains are accessible from Lesser Faydark in the west, and lead to the gnomish city of Ak'anon at the south end of the zone.  Druids of an appropriate level may also teleport to Steamfont.<BR><BR>

Yendar roams the zone, though his usual path seems to be from the entrance to the minotaur caves in the northeast, southwest past the windmills, and all the way down toward the druid portal ring.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/yendar.jpg" ALT="Yendar Starpyre">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/tobon.jpg" ALT="Tobon Starpyre"></SPAN><BR>

If Yendar is not up, you can go to Tobon Starpyre (pictured above right) in the Library Mechanimagica (AKA the mage/wizard/enchanter guild) in Ak'anon and say to him, "Who is Yendar?"  This will cause Yendar to spawn out in Steamfont, however reports vary on whether or not you can do this immediately after Yendar despawns or if you have to wait a while, or whether it actually works at all (no one has yet verified it).  Tobon replies:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">Tobon Starpyre says 'Oh, he is my older brother.  Used to be the leader of the Eldritch Collective.  Then he founded the Observers, a pretty good piece of work.  Went off his rocker a long while back, though.  Became obsessed with Innoruuk and the Teir'dal.  Stays away for days at a time, nobody knows where he has been.  Mother still worries about him, asked me to keep an eye on him. But he is a grown gnome, and with his mastery of the art, has little to fear in this world or others.  But if you are seeking him, I would look outside Ak'Anon, in the Steamfonts.  That is where he makes his home these days. </SPAN><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

See section 6 above for information on finding Yendar.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">The Final Translation</SPAN><BR><BR>

Give the "Tattered Parchment" and "Book of Souls" to Yendar.  He will say:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="conv">
<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">Yendar Starpyre says 'My, this is quite a large list!  Yes, I can use the names and dates recorded here to help me understand the script.  It should be a simple matter now.  A moment, please.  Aha, yes, there we go.  Traslated as best I can!   I do hope you're not involved in what is described here, as it is quite fiendish.  Oi!  You, woman!  Give that back!  Soandso , that woman there took your letter!  I think I should leave you to discuss it with her.  Best of luck! </SPAN><BR>
</SPAN><BR>

At this point, a human female named Renux Herkanor will be standing very nearby.  You need to kill Renux.<BR><BR>

This is not a simple matter; Renux is a level 50 rogue who wields a weapon called Trochilic's Skean.  It is a dagger that procs Clockwork Poison, a stun/DoT that is very deadly.  There are two ways to kill Renux:<BR><BR>

<OL>
<LI>Bring 25 people and mob her.  She'll die relatively easily, but you may take a few casualties.
<LI>Bring a group consisting of yourself (the rogue), a druid, an enchanter, a warrior, a cleric, and another person (preferably another rogue).  The druid will snare Renux, and kite her in large circles around the zone.  The druid should KEEP snaring her, to make sure that Renux's aggro stays on the druid (whom she cannot reach) instead of on the others.  The enchanter should Tash Renux, the rogues and warriors should beat her down, the cleric should keep everyone alive (in case Renux does get off a few hits), and the druid should... well... keep snaring and DoTing Renux.  Renux appears to have somewhere upwards of 20,000 hit points, so she can take several minutes to kill with this method, but as long as you all start at full mana, you should be fine.
</OL>

There are certainly other methods of killing her, but these are relatively simple.  I know of one rogue who did this step with only himself (52 rogue), a 58 enchanter, and a 60 ranger.  The enchanter chain-tashed Renux while the ranger snared her; then the ranger and rogue beat Renux to death while she chased the enchanter (the Tashan line of spells have a pretty large amount of aggro, and cast very quickly).<BR><BR>

Renux gives the following faction hits: -CircleOfUnseenHands, -CorruptQeynosGuards, -KaneBayle, +MerchantsofQeynos, +GuardsofQeynos.  Once Renux is killed, she says:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="conv">
<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">Renux Herkanor says '&lt;gasp&gt; Tell Hanns I tried, and will love him always.  Tell Father I will save a seat in Hell for him! </SPAN><BR>
</SPAN><BR>

This means, in case you care, that Renux is Stanos' daughter.  (Interestingly, Renux can also be found at the rogue guild in Qeynos, along with the aforementioned Hanns.)<BR><BR>

Loot the "Translated Parchment" from Renux's corpse:<BR><BR>

We are ready for you to move into the next phase of the plan.<BR><BR>
I have read your thoughts on the <I>x'kanta</I> Johann, and his chosen tool, Stanos.  Johann is a willing pawn, and will serve us well, for greed is yet another facet of Innoruuk's power.<BR><BR>
Stanos should also work out well, he is quite formidable, though I understand he does not yet know he has been chosen to actually carry out the task.  Watch him well when the time comes, but I agree with your judgment.<BR><BR>
Joren will be in Qeynos the entire month, so you have ample time to <I>s'ktkar</I> your task.  Enclosed are the tools you will give to the Human <I>x'kanta</I>.<BR><BR>
The blade is a gift from Innoruuk himself, forged in his temple and imbued with rage.  Be sure to recover it after the mission is complete, it is much too powerful to leave in the hands of those we intend to <I>il'kaash</I> in the future.  Combined with Stanos' skill, Joren and his guards should fall easily.<BR><BR>
The Guise has been handcrafted my our Master Coercer and should allow the wearer to pass undetected as Koada'dal, thus allowing the assassin to gain entry into the Ambassador's quarters.  Luckily, it shall be a human transforming himself into that <I>zm'rina</I> form.<BR><BR>
Be sure to eliminate all the human <I>x'kanda</I> you have recruited, and have no fear of the repercussions, for the Circle of Unseen Hands is no threat to us here in Neriak.<BR><BR>

<LI>The text above is a character-for-character copy of the words in the screenshots.
<LI>The italicized words are presumably Tier'dal (Dark Elf) language words that Yendar was not able to translate.  Note that your language skill is irrelevant when it comes to reading this document.
<LI>The word "my" in paragraph 6 is a typo and probably was supposed to be "by".

Renux will also drop a piercing weapon called the "Jagged Diamond Dagger," which you should also loot -- it's one of the items you will need to turn in to Stanos in order to get Ragebringer!  Renux also drops two pieces of Ravenscale armor (if you're lucky, she'll drop the RS Mask, which has a permanent effect of See Invisible -- very useful) and, as mentioned before, Trochilic's Skean.  The Skean is a good weapon, but it is NODROP -- personally, I let one of my party members (the warrior) have it, to thank her for helping.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="vghera"></A><SPAN CLASS="secthead">9. Kill General V`ghera<BR>(Kithicor Forest - General V`ghera and his aides)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Travel to Kithicor Forest.  Find the house full of evil Dark Elves, and give one of them the "Sealed Box".  General V`ghera will spawn.  Kill him and take his pouch.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kithicor Forest is directly adjacent to Highpass Hold.  It is also west of West Commonlands, and south of the halfling city of Rivervale.  The house full of Dark Elves is located on the east side of a small hill, at coordinates (+800, +2400).<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/kith_house.jpg" ALT="Dark Elf house"><BR>

The house, looking through the front door.  Outside you can see some low-level ghouls and skeletons guarding the place.  This shot was taking during the day.  At night, there are also higher-level undead (35+) guarding the house.<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/kith_house_int.jpg" ALT="Dark Elf house closeup"><BR>

Note that the mobs named "Tasi V`ghera" and "Ioltos V`ghera" are NOT GENERAL V`GHERA!!!  They merely have the same surname -- probably his siblings or cousins or something.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Spawning the General</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Dark Elves in the house are KOS to everyone.  They are also all level 55+, and are highly dangerous.  If you give the "Sealed Box" to any of them, General V`ghera will immediately spawn inside the house (and he will probably kill you).  General V`ghera is level 63, casts several dangerous spells, and hits for over 200 damage.  He also has around 30,000 hit points.<BR><BR>

As a result, the best way to kill him is to first clear out the house so that there is only one DE left.  A pair of level 60 rangers are best for this, since they can manage to pull, one at a time, the inhabitants of the house.  BE SURE they leave ONE of the Dark Elves behind, otherwise you will not be able to turn in your Sealed Box to spawn the General!  There is debate over whether Coercer Q`ioul or Brigadier G`tav is the best choice, but Mizchif of Fennin Ro pointed out the following (copied from a post on <A HREF="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.showMessage?topicID=11827.topic">The Safehouse</A>):<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="conv">
<SPAN CLASS="npctalk">The one major disagreement I have with that guide, having watched it both ways in the last two weeks, is that I agree with the poster above that you're far better off to leave the Brigadier as the last named DE in the cabin, NOT the Coercer.<BR><BR>
(1) From where the Brigadier stands, you'll be out of the General's line of sight when he spawns and hence will have time to re-hide.<BR><BR>
(2) If you leave the Coercer up, you have to pull her out of the cabin to do the turn-in, or the General WILL see you when he spawns and you're dead for a fight you'd much rather be present at. The debuff pull/wait for her to rebuff on the way back routine is just way too cute and complicated, IMHO<BR><BR>
(3) Plus there's the risk of aggro from the Coercer turning to buff her pet at the wrong moment, or the pet aggroing on you<BR><BR>
(4) Plus, as pointed out above, you will want to kill the Coercer for her robe drops, and it's bad manners to not leave at least one named DE up in case someone else is doing a raid within the next 8 hours<BR><BR>
(5) Plus the Coercer is an easier kill than the Brigadier (chanter vs warrior)<BR><BR>
(6) Plus the Coercer will buff the General if she gets the chance, while the Brigadier doesn't buff. </SPAN><BR><BR>
</SPAN>

I agree with everything there EXCEPT point 4: When we did my General raid, the Brigadier himself dropped a Kedge robe when he was killed, and the Coercer did not.  Most raids will probably kill off the final DE once the last rogue has gotten his General's Pouch, so for the purpose of getting the robe, it doesn't matter which one you save for last.  However, the safety and reliability issues for using Brigadier G`tav vs. using the Coercer are all valid, and as such, the Brigadier is probably a better choice.<BR><BR>

You will need a force of around 30 people to kill the General safely.  It should be a good mix of tanks, nukers, healers, etc.  This force should begin assembling at the Highpass Hold zone border area (in Kithicor) at around midnight game time.  The reason for this is so that by the time it is 8 am in game, all of the wandering undead in Kithicor will have despawned, and your rangers will be able to start individually pulling the Dark Elves from the house, to your waiting raid party, who will dispatch them.  The rangers, if they are high enough level, can actually start doing this before the undead despawn, since they can simply bring the undead with them (none of the wandering undead in Kithicor are particularly powerful, and are no threat to a large party of level 50+ people).<BR><BR>

Once the DE house is cleared (EXCEPT for Brigadier G`tav, or whichever DE you choose to leave behind), everyone in the party should move to the road north of the DE house, at approximately +1100, +2600.  Be sure that they do not run near the DE house on their way there.  The party should then buff up and get ready to fight.<BR><BR>

(From this point, I will refer to the Brigadier as the last DE, even though you may use someone else.)<BR><BR>

At this point, only Brigadier G`tav should be inside the house.  The rogue who has the Sealed Box should sneakhide, move into the house, stand BEHIND the Brigadier, and give him the box.  Due to the Brigadier's positioning, and where General V`ghera spawns (he always spawns IN the house, regardless of the location of the Dark Elf you hand the box to), the rogue SHOULD have time to re-hide before the General notices him.  At this point, the waiting ranger can solo-pull the General over to the raid party, while the rogue sneaks away from the house, and goes to join the party.<BR><BR>

Once the General is dead, loot the "General's Pouch" off his corpse.  This pouch, like Stanos' Pouch, is NOT a container, so you may put it safely inside a backpack.  The General will RARELY also drop the "Cazic Quill".  If he does, congratulations!  You are DONE WITH THE QUEST -- you should now have the General's Pouch, the Cazic Quill, and the Jagged Diamond Dagger to give to Stanos (see step 10, below).  However the reported drop rate for the Quill is roughly 1 in 10, so don't expect him to drop it very often.  (If he does not drop the Quill, refer to the "Cazic Quill Subquest" section below for details on the alternate method of obtaining the Quill.)<BR><BR>

A common practice is for several rogues to have a "General party", which basically means that they all turn in their Sealed Boxes one at a time, causing multiple General V`gheras to spawn.  Once the first general is dead, the next rogue moves to the house again, hands in HIS box to Brigadier G`tav, the ranger pulls V`ghera again, and you kill him again.  Repeat this process until all rogues present have their Pouches.  (Note that if you take a long while, the nightly undead may start spawning, so your group will have to keep an eye on them -- a common practice is to have the enchanters keep the undead mezzed during the General fight, so that the undead can be picked off afterward.)<BR><BR>

If the Brigadier aggroes on someone, you will not be able to give him the Sealed Box until he loses aggro.  The usual method is to have an enchanter charm him so that he is aggroed on nobody except the enchanter, and then to mez and mem blur him over and over until it takes, and he forgets what he's doing.  If you kill him, then no other rogues get to turn in their boxes until the Dark Elves start respawning (8 hours)!  However once all the rogues are done with their boxes, you may freely kill him, for there is a change that the Brigadier will drop the Robe of the Kedge (see the "Cazic Quill" subquest, summarized at top and detailed below)!<BR><BR>

<A NAME="cazic"></A><SPAN CLASS="bighead">- CAZIC QUILL SUB-QUEST -</SPAN><BR><BR>

If, as described in step 9 above, General V`ghera does not drop the Cazic Quill, then you will need to do a separate sub-quest to acquire the Cazic Quill.<BR><BR>

In the Western Plains of Karana there is (sometimes) a Barbarian named Vilnius the Small.  If you give him the "Robe of the Kedge", the "Robe of the Ishva", the "Robe of the Oracle", and the "Shining Metallic Robes", he will give you the "Cazic Quill".<BR><BR>

<BR>

<A NAME="oracle"></A><SPAN CLASS="secthead">1. Get the Robe of the Oracle<BR>(Oracle of K'Arnon - Ocean of Tears)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kill the Oracle of K'Arnon in the Ocean of Tears, and loot the Robe of the Oracle off his body; or, purchase the RotO from another player.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Ocean of Tears is only accessible by either taking the boat from East Freeport, or the Butcherblock Mountains.  The Freeport boat passes right by where the Oracle stands, so it's much easier to start from that side of the ocean.  The Oracle is standing on the north side of the goblin island in the Ocean of Tears, and he is located at approximate coordinates (-500, -8800).  If you go to the dock on the Sisters Island, the Oracle's island is visible across the channel (the location of the Oracle is circled in red):<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/oot_island.jpg" ALT="Oracle's island"><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Kill the Oracle</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Oracle is a level 40 wizard, who is guarded by the Guardian of K'Arnon, a level 40 (paladin? warrior?).  Any 50+ group will not have any problem killing the Oracle; I myself did it with one 51 rogue (me), one 58 enchanter, and the 60 druid that the enchanter was botting.  The enchanter mezzed the Guardian, then chain-stunned the Oracle while the druid nuked and dotted, and I backstabbed.  As soon as I'd looted the Robe of the Oracle from the Oracle's corpse, the druid ported us out.<BR><BR>

The other method to get a Robe of the Oracle is to buy one from another player.  The Robe usually sells for under 1,000 platinum.  Killing the Oracle is so trivial that it's usually not worth spending the time and money trying to find someone who is selling a RotO.<BR><BR>

Kill the Ghoul Arch Magus in Lower Guk, and loot the Shining Metallic Robes off his body; or, purchase the SMR from another player.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Ghoul Arch Magus lives in Lower Guk, which is only accessible from Upper Guk, which itself is only accessible from Innothule Swamp, south of the Deserts of Ro and east of the Feerrott.  The GAM himself is in the north wing of the "dead side" of Lower Guk.  As his location is well-known and usually camped, I won't bother with a map.  There are plenty of other sources for that (say, <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com">EQ Atlas</A>).<BR><BR>

This is the room the GAM spawns in.  I'm not sure which of the two frogs is his placeholder but I believe it's the rear one.<BR><BR>

[TODO: Picture of Ghoul Arch Magus]<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting the Robe</SPAN><BR><BR>

The GAM is an uncommon spawn, and he drops the SMR as his rare drop, so it may take several hours of camping to get an SMR.  Take a full group down there, and kill your way to his room.  Camp in or near his room until he drops your SMR.  The GAM himself is a magician, and casts some dangerous spells, but he is not particularly difficult to kill.<BR><BR>

The other method to get Shining Metallic Robes is to buy one from another player.  The Robe usually sells for under 1,000 platinum.  This is, in general, a much simpler method than trying to get the robe yourself.<BR><BR>

<BR>

<A NAME="ishva"></A><SPAN CLASS="secthead">3. Get the Robe of the Ishva<BR>(Ishva Mal - Splitpaw Lair, or Coercer Q`ioul - Kithicor Forest)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kill the Ishva Mal in Splitpaw Lair, and loot the Robe of the Ishva off his body; or, kill Coercer Q`ioul in Kithicor forest, and loot the Robe of the Ishva off her body; or, buy the RotI from another player.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="minorhead">The Ishva Mal Method</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Splitpaw Lair is located roughly in the center of the Southern Plains of Karana.  The Ishva Mal's room is inside Splitpaw, through an underwater passage partway through the dungeon:<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/splitpaw_map.gif" ALT="Splitpaw map"><BR>

The pool of water on the map above is seen in the picture below:<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/splitpaw_water.jpg" ALT="Splitpaw water room"><BR>

The underwater passage entrance is highlighted by the red circle.  You have to go straight down into the water a little ways to enter the passage.<BR><BR>

Go through the passage, then swim upward and you'll be in a small cave.  A passage to the north leads to a few small storage rooms; the room way in the back corner is the Ishva Mal's room:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/splitpaw_room.jpg" ALT="Ishva Mal's room">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/ishva_mal.jpg" ALT="The Ishva Mal"></SPAN><BR>

In the left picture, you can see two gnolls.  The one circled in red is the placeholder for the Ishva Mal, shown at right.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Killing the Ishva Mal</SPAN><BR><BR>

The Ishva Mal is a level 45 caster (not sure what kind), but he's pretty easy to kill.  I did it with the same group of 51 rogue, 58 enchanter, and 60 druid, with no problems whatsoever.  He is an uncommon to rare spawn, and drops the Robe of the Ishva fairly often (as far as I know -- I got my robe on his first kill).  Not a big deal.<BR><BR>

Since gnolls don't have robe textures, it's not possible to tell whether the Ishva Mal has the robe or not without killing him.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="minorhead">The Coercer Method</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

See "Getting There" in the main quest step 9, above.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Killing the Coercer</SPAN><BR><BR>

If your goal is to kill only the coercer, then your best bet is to find a 60 ranger who knows how to solo-pull her.  Set up a well-balanced party of 6-12 people at the Rivervale zone line in Kithicor during the game day (8am - 7pm game time), and have the 60 ranger pull the Coercer solo to your group.  MAKE SURE you dispel her repeatedly, otherwise she will be hasted and buffed and will be harder to kill.  Then, kill her, and she will always drop the Robe of the Ishva.  Sometimes, too, she will drop the Robe of the Kedge (see below).<BR><BR>

Apparently, if she appears to be wearing a green robe, then she has only the Robe of the Kedge in her possession.  If she appears to be wearing a blue robe, then she definitely has the Robe of the Ishva, and MAY also have the Robe of the Kedge.  As a result, kill her as often as possible.  She has a spawn time of 1 real-time day.<BR><BR>

Instead of going to Splitpaw or Kithicor, of course, you can simply buy a Robe of the Ishva from another player.  I don't know how much they sell for but it isn't a huge amount.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="kedge"></A><SPAN CLASS="secthead">4. Get the Robe of the Kedge<BR>(Phinigel Autropos - Kedge Keep, or Dark Elves - Kithicor Forest)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kill Phinigel Autropos in Kedge Keep, and loot the Robe of the Kedge off his body; or, kill all of the Dark Elves in the house (see main quest step 9, above) in Kithicor Forest, until one of them drops the Robe of the Kedge.  The RotK is NODROP so you cannot buy one from another player, although you CAN multiquest with the RotK.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="minorhead">The Fish Method</SPAN><BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kedge Keep is located at the bottom of the lake in Dagnor's Cauldron.  The entry coordinates are approximately (-1000, -1000), at literally the bottom of the lake.  Right around there are a lot of broken pillars, etc., which mark the entrance to the zone.  The below picture was taken facing north, into the Kedge Keep zone border:<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/kedgezone.jpg" ALT="Kedge Keep zone entrance"><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Killing Phinigel</SPAN><BR><BR>

Kedge Keep is entirely underwater, so you will need to have some method of extended underwater breathing for you and your entire party.  The absolute best method is to acquire Fishbone Earrings for everyone, since they have a permanent effect of Enduring Breath, allowing you permanent water breathing.  That's difficult, though, as the Fishbone Earrings are a rare drop off a 5-hour spawn named Hadden in Qeynos Hills.  A simpler method is to bring along a magician who can summon dozens of waterstones for everyone.  A waterstone is a nonstackable, single-use item that has one charge of Enduring Breath, which lasts roughly 36 minutes.  You can also have Enduring Breath cast on you by some classes, including enchanters, but if it starts to run out and they're LD or otherwise occupied...<BR><BR>

All told, the magician method is probably the best, since getting everyone Fishbone Earrings is unlikely.<BR><BR>

You'll need a party of 12 people level 55+ to safely kill Phinigel, or a larger party of 50+.  It's been done with as few as 6 people but it's highly dangerous if you don't know exactly what you're doing.  Phinigel is deep within Kedge Keep, at the bottom of a large vertical room.  The usual method is to have a monk feign-pull his guardians (swirlspine seahorses) up to the party, kill them all, and then kill Phinigel once his guards are all dead.  Phinigel drops several items needed for several epic quests, including the Robe of the Kedge, but he drops any of them rarely, so do not expect him to drop your robe the first time.  There are other, better guides to dealing with Phinigel, so I will not go into any more detail here; your best bet is to go along on Kedge raids until you get your robe.<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/phinigel_autropos.jpg" ALT="Phinigel Autropos"><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

See "Getting There" in the main quest step 9, above.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Killing the Dark Elves</SPAN><BR><BR>

You'll need a pair of high-level rangers to safely solo pull the Dark Elves out of the house.  Refer to step 9 in the main quest above for details on how to set up for killing the Dark Elves.  Clearing the Dark Elf house will result in a Kedge robe about one time in three, according to what I've read, and the robe can drop off ANY of the Dark Elves.<BR><BR>

Since the RotK is NODROP, you cannot buy one from another player, but you CAN have them multiquest it with you.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="vilnius"></A><SPAN CLASS="secthead">5. Turn in the Robes<BR>(Vilnius the Small - Western Plains of Karana)</SPAN><BR><BR>

Hand in the four robes (Oracle, SMR, Ishva, Kedge) to Vilnius the Small, in exchange for the Cazic Quill.<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="subhead">Getting There</SPAN><BR><BR>

Vilnius the Small, a barbarian male, is found at approximate coordinates (+150, -6700), at the top of a hill just east of a bandit camp on the west end of the mountain range in WK.  The bandit camp, which is just west (and downhill) from Vilnius' spawn point, is shown in the picture below (the view is from Vilnius' spawn point):<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/wk_camp.jpg" ALT="West Karana bandit camp"><BR>

From the camp, looking east (uphill), Vilnius' spawn point can be seen here, circled in red:<BR><BR>

<IMG CLASS="a" SRC="rb/wk_spawn.jpg" ALT="Vilnius' spawn point"><BR>

Vilnius' placeholder, "a brigand", and Vilnius himself, are shown below:<BR><BR>

<SPAN CLASS="imgpair"><IMG SRC="rb/a_brigand.jpg" ALT="a brigand">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="rb/vilnius.jpg" ALT="Vilnius the Small"></SPAN><BR>

The brigand, as well as all the bandits, are on the KaranaBandits faction, but Vilnius is indifferent to all.<BR><BR>

However, Vilnius is not there all the time; he has a placeholder (the aforementioned "a brigand") who despawns around 9 or 10pm game time each day.  Once the brigand despawns, Vilnius will spawn at 11pm game time (and will despawn at around 8am game time).  If the brigand is up, you don't need to kill him; just wait until he despawns.<BR><BR>

The bandits in the camp are around level 9-12, so they aren't exactly a threat, although they could make things inconvenient should they decide to attack while you are trying to hand items in to Vilnius.  If the brigand is not spawned during the day, then you may need to start killing bandits to get him to spawn, but this is unconfirmed (every time I've stopped by his spot, either Vilnius or the brigand were up).<BR><BR>

Hand the four robes in to Vilnius, and he says the following:<BR>

<SPAN CLASS="conv"><BR>

<A NAME="gimpy"></A><SPAN CLASS="bighead">WHY THE QUEST IS GIMPY</SPAN><BR><BR>

Anyone familiar with any of the other epic weapon quests will probably be surprised that the Ragebringer quest is so simple.  You have to kill all of 1 difficult mob (the General), and a handful of single-group mobs (Renux, the Coercer, the Ishva Mal, the Oracle of K'Arnon, the Ghoul Arch Magus), pickpocket two items, and run around a lot.<BR><BR>

Originally, the Ragebringer quest was far more involved.  You had to do the following (assuming you didn't know any spoilers about the quest):<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Find Vilnius in WK and talk to him.  He gave you a task to find Malka Rale in the Qeynos Aqueduct System.
<LI>Go to the QAS and talk to Malka.  She gives you Stanos' Pouch.
<LI>You give Stanos' Pouch to Vilnius.  He tells you that he needs you to do something for him: collect four swords - Painbringer (rare drop from Kobold Champion in Sol B), Fleshripper (rare drop from Kobold King in Sol B), a Mithril Two-Handed Sword (rare drop from the froglok king in Lower Guk), and a Gigantic Zweihander (Karg Icebear in Everfrost).  Turn in the swords to Vilnius, and he gives you the Jagged Diamond Dagger as payment.
<LI>Vilnius then asks another task of you: collect four robes (the four mentioned above).  For these, he gives you the Cazic Quill, another dagger.
<LI>He then asks one last task: collect four rapiers - a Martune Rapier (rare drop from Scorn Banshees in the Plane of Hate), an Eyerazzia (uncommon drop from Scarelings in the Plane of Fear), a Well-Balanced Rapier (purchasable from the Shady Swashbuckler in East Commonlands), and the Burning Rapier, which itself involves a long quest that will take at least 6-7 hours to do.  For the rapiers, he gives you back Stanos' Pouch, and tells you to take it to Anson McBale in Highpass.
<LI>Give the pouch to Anson, and Stanos shows up.  Talk to Stanos and he gives you the quest to recover the stained parchment pieces from Founy and Tani.
<LI>Get the parchment pieces, give them to Stanos, and go through the translation rigmarole above, kill Renux, get the Sealed Box, kill the General for his Pouch, at which point you have the Jagged Diamond Dagger, the Cazic Quill, and the General's Pouch, and Stanos gives you Ragebringer.
</OL>

The quest was gimped in the following ways:<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Renux, a mob you are REQUIRED to kill to complete the quest, ALWAYS drops the Jagged Diamond Dagger.  As a result, you do not need to collect the four swords.
<LI>Stanos can be spawned by saying to Anson, "I need to see Stanos", which means that not only do you not have to collect the four rapiers, you don't even need to see Malka Rale.  Hell, you don't need Stanos' Pouch AT ALL.
<LI>General V`ghera, up until spring of 2001, used to *ALWAYS* drop a Cazic Quill, which meant that you didn't have to collect the robes, either!  Now, he only drops it rarely (about 1 in 10 is the commonly-tossed around figure), so if you're lucky you won't need to collect the robes, but most people do.
<LI>Even if you do need to get the robes, the ones you need are all tradeable (which means you can just BUY them, instead of having to bother camping for them) except for the Kedge robe, but that hardly matters, because you can multiquest the Kedge Robe.
</OL>

Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but Ragebringer is by far the most common epic weapon because the quest was gimped so heavily.  Verant can never change it back to full-strength, however, because so many rogues who haven't completed the quest would bitch insanely about the facts that 1) it's been this way for over a year, and 2) it's unfair that a whole bunch of people got to do the easy version just because they were able to do it first.<BR><BR>
