			Having no doubt read <a href="whyatheist.html">why I'm an atheist</a>, you probably have some questions.  Or maybe you don't, and you're some kind of masochist who likes reading my insane ramblings.  Well, that's okay too!  So, here's some questions and answers that may or may not be interesting, informative, insightful, funny, overrated, underrated, or redundant.<br><br>

			<b>Aren't you afraid of going to Hell?</b><br><br>

			Why should I be?  I consider Hell to be as fictional as God, Satan, Heaven, Odin, Zeus, Vishnu, and so on.  Why would I be afraid of something I don't have any reason to think exists?<br><br>

			<b>If you don't believe in God, how do you think all this *got* here?</b><br><br>

			I don't know.  It's not particularly important to me that I know.  Sure, it would be nice to find out, but am I going to let my life hinge on it?  No.  There's no reason to.<br><br>

			<b>So what happens to us after we die?</b><br><br>

			As far as I can tell, our bodies start decomposing, like any other dead organic matter.<br><br>

			<b>What about your soul?  What happens to your soul after you die?</b><br><br>

			The soul falls into the category of "fictional things I don't believe exist."  Nothing "happens" to your soul because there isn't any "soul" for anything to happen to.<br><br>

			<b>So what about your consciousness?  What happens to that after you die?</b><br><br>

			As near as I can tell, consciousness is simply an emergent property of the brain's biochemistry and electrical activity.  If the activity stops, the consciousness is essentially gone.  What does it feel like?  Nothing -- you are essentially frozen in time at that point.  Granted this is entirely speculative but it follows logically.  If your brain and its electrical activity were recreated identically somehow, thousands of years after you died, you would wake up and feel like no time at all had passed.  Essentially, there is no reason to think that consciousness stems from some supernatural process or force.<br><br>

			<b>If you just accept Jesus into your heart, you'll believe!</b><br><br>

			This can be paraphrased as, "If you honestly believe that there is a God and that accepting Jesus will result in a happy afterlife, then you'll come to believe that there is a God and that accepting Jesus into your heart will result in a happy afterlife."  It's circular.  What this means is that, in order to believe, I need to believe.  You can't get there from here.<br><br>

			<b>What about morals?  If you don't accept God's morality, what's keeping you from raping and murdering?</b><br><br>

			My own sense of morals and ethics.  Not coincidentally, there is a lot in common between my morals and "Christian" morals.  I generally believe that it's wrong to harm others, that (generally) every person deserves freedom, that everyone should be given fair treatment, and so on.  A flip side to this argument is to say, "If God is the only thing keeping Christians from raping and murdering, doesn't that make them pretty lousy people?"  Now don't get me wrong, I don't honestly believe that many, let alone most, Christians would start raping and murdering if you proved God didn't exist.<br><br>
			
			But the point of the argument is the idea that atheists don't have morals, because they don't believe in God.  It implies that Christians only have morals because they fear God's reprisal, and would otherwise be raping and murdering.  Both statements are patently false.<br><br>

			<b>Well, if you believe in God and are wrong, you lose nothing, but if you disbelieve and are wrong, you spend eternity in Hell.  So why not believe?</b><br><br>

			This is a form of Pascal's Wager, a hypothesis proposed by mathematician Blaise Pascal in the mid-1600s.  It is unfortunately flawed in several ways.<br><br>

			First of all, which god?  What happens if I believe in the <i>wrong</i> god?  Isn't the actual god going to be pretty annoyed that I was worshipping someone else?  It seems that most gods would be less annoyed if I worshipped no god, rather than the wrong one.<br><br>

			Second, almost every God that has ever been proposed is either omniscient (i.e. knows everything), or close to it.  Would the real God (if there was one) accept my faith if it were based on such a mercenary idea, and not because I honestly thought it was the right thing to believe?<br><br>

			Third, any god who would create me and endow me with the ability to reason, and then punish me eternally for using that ability, isn't a god worth worshipping.<br><br>

			Even if it were proved that God exists, I would not worship him (unless forced to).  Worship is beneath my dignity as a free human.<br><br>

			<b>I've felt God, God's presence, God's love, God's will, etc.</b><br><br>

			Well, whatever it is you felt, presumably it was experienced through one or more of your five senses.  The way I view such claims is this: We know for a fact that people exaggerate, misinterpret, hallucinate, and lie about things -- we do <i>not</i> know for a fact that God exists.  Based on what evidence we have, which is more likely: that people claiming God spoke to them are misguided, or that God actually spoke to them?<br><br>

			<b>You keep talking about evidence.  You can't prove God exists!  It's about faith, not evidence.</b><br><br>

			You're right -- and this is why I don't believe in God.  I see no reason to believe in conjectural ideas that cannot be proved.  If you tell me I should believe in God, I will say there is no evidence.  If you tell me I should believe that invisible pink unicorns control my destiny, I will say that there is no evidence.  These two ideas are <i>identical</i> as far as I'm concerned -- they are equally unsupported, and unsupportable.<br><br>

			<b>Do you believe in love?  You can't prove love exists.</b><br><br>

			Yes, I can.  One definition of love is a set of biochemical states in the human body.  I can go into a lab, examine a human in love, and see that their body is in those states.<br><br>

			A more common definition of love is the expression of affection by action or words.  If I say I love someone, and do things that are traditionally interpreted as loving, that is <i>by definition</i> evidence of love's existence.<br><br>

			<b>Some people worship material objects, like money, the same way that theists worship God.  Therefore everyone believes in some kind of God, because everyone has something that they consider exceedingly important.</b><br><br>

			Not even remotely.  The definition of God is not "something very important," even if God <i>is</i> a very important thing to some people.  The most common definition of God is as an all-powerful, all-knowing supernatural being who created the universe.  It has so far been found impossible to prove that anything defined as such actually exists.  The most important things in my life are my wife, my family, and my friends.  All of those things can be proven to exist.  Even people who worship money aren't the same as theists, because <i>you can prove that money exists</i>.  I also doubt the contention that anyone worships money in the <i>same way</i> that theists worship gods.  Treating a material object as important above all else does not give it the same meaning as worshiping a deity.<br><br>
