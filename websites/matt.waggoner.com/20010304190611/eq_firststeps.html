			Today I ventured out of Felwithe for the first time, into the Greater Faydark.  My father had always forbade me from going there.  He told me it was too dangerous for a youth such as myself.  But I am of age now, and eager to explore, and practice my magics.<P>
			I trod down the narrow path toward the front gate, and there saw the two guards who protected the entrance to the city.  They looked at me with what seemed to be mild disdain, though I thought I detected a hint of protectiveness in their looks.  They are, after all, High Elves like myself.  But no matter; I would take care of myself.  I strode into the open area fronting upon the gate, drew the rusty dagger my guildmaster had given me, and looked around for something to hunt.<P>
			I spied a bat flitting through the air near a stand of trees, and decided that this would be my first target.  As stealthily as I could, I padded over to where it flew, steeled myself, and leapt at it with my dagger.  The first lunge scored a rent along one of its wings, but the beast wheeled in the air and dove at me, slashing at my head with sharp claws I hadn't noticed before.  Luckily I dodged enough that its foot brushed against my ear, but before I could spin and strike again, the bat came back around and dove to one side, striking my arm and tearing a bloody gash.  I grunted and leapt back, and as I switched the dagger to my better hand, began chanting a rhythm I would come to know very well in the following days.<P>
			As I spoke, the bat turned to attack again, but just before it hit, I completed my spell and a ball of fire bloomed all around the bat, scorching its skin, hair, and eyes.  The bat shrieked and turned aside, flapping awkwardly through the air.  I ran after it, stabbing with my dagger at its behind, until I scored a lethal blow on its underbelly and it flopped to the ground, dead.<P>
			I sat, breathing hard, and tended to my wound.  It wasn't too deep, but it was long, and very bloody.  I took a flask of water and washed the wound, then clamped one hand over it.  Some blood trickled out between my fingers while I tried to figure out what to do.<P>
			As I sat, I suddenly heard the sound of wind and chimes behind me.  I turned to look, and saw a dwarf, waving his hands and talking quietly.  Blue sparks and flames spun from his fingers, and instantly the pain in my arm stopped.  I removed my hand to see healthy, closed flesh, without sign of a scar.  Only some dried blood remained around where the wound had been.  My mouth dropped open and the dwarf laughed heartily, his bushy blond moustache bobbing.<P>
			"Thank you," I said, unable to come up with a quip like I'd so often heard in the adventure stories I'd read as a child.<P>
			"Not at all," the dwarf said.  "My name is Rusharack.  I am a Paladin, from the dwarven city of Kaladim, in the Butcherblock Mountains."<P>
			I stood and bowed before him.  Well, above him.  "I am Teramenor, of, um, Felwithe."  I gestured at the gates a short distance off.  "I am a magician, or at least, I'm trying to be."<P>
			"Well, Teramenor, you seem to still have much to learn about the Faydark.  I myself am still quite new here, but unless learning comes quick, death takes its place.  Come, we can hunt together and I shall perhaps teach you a thing or two."  I nodded in gratitude, and we set off deeper into the forest.<P>
