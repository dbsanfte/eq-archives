									"He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement, or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property."<BR>

									Matt is a graduate of UCLA's School of Engineering and Appliances, that is, Applied Sciences, with a degree in Computer Science.  That's right, it's a Bachelor of Science degree.  (Figure it out.)  Matt has already made billions of dollars selling people things they don't need. His interests include skydiving, extreme fencing, corporate takeovers, and world domination. He is a card-carrying member of the DNRC (in which he is the Minister of Pants) as well as Mensa's Secret Society of Inner Circle Weirdos, the Nobel Prize Committee, and the Imperial Naval Academy.  Matt also makes extensive use of the Orbital Mind-Control Lasers, and is also the Archbishop of Boelter Hall.  Matt is currently planning a subversive, hostile takeover of the Los Angeles municipal government.  You will know he has succeeded when you realize, one day, that <I>nothing has changed...</I>
									<P>

									Matt also ran a single-line bulletin board system called The Death Star, which was active for five years before he shut it down on its fifth birthday, April 29, 1997.  It was one of the oldest single-line BBSes in Los Angeles before its demise.  Ah, those were the days... if you were formerly a member of TDS, feel free to drop me an email to reminisce about old mimes.  Er, times.
