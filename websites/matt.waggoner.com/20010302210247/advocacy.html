						Check out the <A HREF="http://www.skepdic.com">Skeptic's Dictionary</A>.  This is a great site that debunks all manner of supernatural, superstitious, paranormal, pseudoscientific nonsense.  A great reference, and almost every entry has links to at least a couple of other sites that further debunk such nonsense.<P>
						On a related topic, check out <A HREF="http://www.csicop.org">CSICOP</A>, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.  Basically they're a group of guys who go around debunking the aforementioned nonsense -- psychics, UFO sightings, and so on and so forth.  If you like using your brain and would like to do it more often, go visit this site.<P>
						For those of you sick of all this creationist bullshit, check out <A HREF="http://www.talkorigins.org">the official talk.origins website</A>.  talk.origins is a Usenet newsgroup that discusses, scientific-like, the origins of biological life, the universe, and everything.  (Mostly life.)  They've got lots of great material about evolution, including a nice big section on how to counter creationist nonsense.  A definite must-read for anyone who thinks the Kansas State Board of Education needs a collective mental enema.<P>
						Also check out <A HREF="http://www.infidels.org">The Secular Web</A>, another good reference (especially the <A HREF="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/">Nontheism</A> library entry on the left).  This is clearly more for atheists, secular humanists and the like than the previous links.  Yes, I'm an atheist.  Odds are, if you have a problem with that, then you don't know what an atheist really is.

						<UL>
						<LI><A HREF="http://www.fsf.org">The Free Software Foundation</A>, started by Richard M. Stallman (RMS, as he is known in the community).  The source of the GNU General Public License, by which any software you write should be licensed.
						<LI><A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr">Eric S. Raymond's home page</A>.  Don't let the creepy picture fool you: ESR is a major advocate of free/open-source software, and has written several wonderful articles all about them.  He also maintains the <A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon">Jargon File</A>, and if you are a Studly Geek Programmer like me you will read it all the way through.  Huzzah!
						<LI><A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</A>.  If you aren't visiting this site daily, you're missing out on some great stuff.
						<LI>Read my <A HREF="freeopen.html">Introduction to Free and Open Software</A> (under construction).

						<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">This site contains no GIF images.  Why?  Keep reading...</FONT><P>

						The LZW compression algorithm used in GIF images is currently covered under a patent owned by Unisys.  Unisys is being unpleasant with regard to this patent, so I (and others; click on the banner above for <B>LOTS MORE INFORMATION!</B>) encourage you to use something besides GIFs for your website.<P>

						As an alternative, you can use <B>PNG</B> images -- Portable Network Graphics.  A PNG (pronounced "ping") is like a GIF, with the following advantages:
						<UL>
						<LI>PNGs are smaller than equivalent GIFs;
						<LI>GIF only supports palette-indexed color (meaning 256 colors max); PNG supports true color (24-bit) as well as indexed color, and a bunch of other formats, too;
						<LI>Both major browsers -- Netscape and IE -- now support PNG and will display them properly.  Some older image editing programs won't recognize PNG (even though the format itself is around 5 years old), so you'll need to use something like <A HREF="http://www.jasc.com">Paint Shop Pro 5.0</A> (<A HREF="psp5work.htm">see here for a workaround for PSP 5's 60-day limit</A>) but every modern graphics program will support PNGs;
						<LI>PNGs support adaptive variable transparency, meaning that they can automatically be blended in with the background (by a web browser that properly supports it).  This is a good thing.
						<LI>Most importantly, <B>PNGs are completely free</B> (as in speech AND beer).  They are not covered by any patents, meaning you are free to use the PNG format for any purpose you desire.
						</UL>
						For more information, check out the official PNG homepage at <A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png">http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png</A>.  For more info on why you shouldn't use GIFs, go <A HREF="http://burnallgifs.org">here</A>.  There's also an explanation of the problem on the <A HREF="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</A> site; just click on the GNU head and then the link that says "No gifs due to patent problems" several lines down.<P>
						(Unfortunately, if you are viewing this in Netscape, transparency may not work with PNGs.  This is Netscape's fault.  Such are the slings and arrows we suffer to avoid stupid patent bullshit.)
