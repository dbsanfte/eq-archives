					So after spending hours and hours surfing this useless website, you may have found yourself wondering, "Say!  I could use a hot dog right about now."  Shortly after that, you might find yourself saying, "Say!  I wonder what Matt's religious beliefs are?"<br><br>

					Well, it wouldn't be the weirdest thing that ever happened, but it would be close.  I'm an atheist.  <b>"OH NO!!!"</b> the more religious-minded among you might think to yourselves.  "NOT AN ATHEIST!!!"  Yep, I'm an atheist.  I do not have any belief in anything supernatural, including but not limited to God, Satan, angels, miracles, ghosts, Odin, Zeus, Vishnu, invisible pink unicorns, and so on.  Essentially, all these things are equivalent to me -- fictional, made-up entities that people invent for various purposes.<br><br>

					The aforementioned religious-minded of you are probably choking on bile at this point, wondering how I could be saying such awful things about your particular deity (if I missed your deity, I apologize; send me an email and I'll include him/her/it/them in the list above).<br><br>

					But enough of my inane prattling!  Below are a list of links to sub-pages I've written, covering a variety of religious topics.  Maybe by reading them, you can understand more about me and maybe find out WHY I'm an atheist, what an atheist really is, and that I'm not such a bad guy after all.<br><br>
