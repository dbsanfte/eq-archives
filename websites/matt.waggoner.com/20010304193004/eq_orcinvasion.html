<P>
			I looked up into the trees, my mouth hanging open.  Above me I saw what must surely be one of the wonders of the modern world: the wood elf city of Kelethin, hanging suspended from the trunks of the enormous firs of the Greater Faydark.<P>
			"Quite a sight, eh?" Rusharack said, peering upward.  "Not that I've ever felt comfortable so far off the ground..."<P>
			The height didn't bother me.  I'd spent enough time on the high ramparts of Felwithe, looking into the Faydark beyond, that I had no particular fear of heights.  Stable ones, at least.  "Well, let's see what there is to see."<P>
			We wandered through the mist, looking for a way up to the city.  A complex set of platforms, ramps, and bridges spiderwebbed their way through the trees, and at last we came to a small ramp guarded by two wood elves in heavy armor.<P>
			"Halt," said one, holding out a hand.  He seemed apprehensive about, but not threatened by, our appearance.  I noticed that his other hand rested on the hilt of his sword, but looked ready to draw it at a moment's notice.<P>
			"Hail," I said.  "We are two travelers, seeking to explore Kelethin.  I am Teramenor of Felwithe, and this is Rusharack of Kaladim."  The dwarf grunted at the guards.<P>
			Apparently we didn't seem like giant bats in disguise.  "Go on, then."  I looked at the ramp; it only rose a few feet off the ground before stopping in mid-air.  At the top was a lever of some kind, sticking out of the ramp.  I strode up and, bracing myself to be catapulted upward, pulled the lever.<P>
			Finding myself not airborne, I looked up to find the source of the quiet clicking and rumbling.  A lift, suspended at the end of a long metal arm, was descending toward us.  The arm ended in a ring surrounding the smooth base of a tree, and I could sense the magical energy driving the device.<P>
			The lift came to a stop just in front of us.  Rusharack looked at me and shrugged, and we stepped onto it.  I reached back and pushed the lever again, and nearly lost my balance as the lift jerked upward.  It rose smoothly to the platform above, and stopped at the edge.  Rusharack leapt onto the larger platform and moved toward the center, clearly not happy about the fact that there were no railings at the edge.  I moved more casually but was still wary of the potential for a fall that would no doubt kill me.<P>
			The platform we were on was as big as some of the houses in Felwithe; a few wood elves stood about, talking quietly, or walking from one place to another.  I saw someone who looked like a merchant standing a few feet away, transacting some business with another wood elf.  The merchant glanced at me over the other's shoulder, but then went back to her business.<P>
			I went over to where Rusharack stood, next to where the trunk of the great tree came through the platform.  "Where shall we go?" I asked.<P>
			"Back down, preferably," he said.  I grinned at him.  "All right, all right, let's explore."<P>
			One long wooden ramp lead up to another, higher platform, and two rope-railed hanging bridges connected this platform with others.  We moved to the next one, and the next, taking in the sights.  There were inns, merchants, blacksmiths; guards walked to and fro, giving us the once-over every time we passed them, but never saying anything.  Wood elves of all kinds passed us, most with a smile and a nod, some less friendly.<P>
			Eventually we found ourselves in front of the Bank of Kelethin.  I was curious to see how it compared to the bank in Felwithe, so I went inside.  A guard stood in the front room, carefully eyeing everyone who entered.  Through a narrow door, in the back room, was the banker himself.<P>
			"Greetings," he said, as we neared.  Rusharack glanced sideways at him, keeping one eye on a shady-looking elf standing near the front door.  "I am Willaen.  What can I do for you?"<P>
			I smiled.  "Greetings.  My name is Teramenor.  I'm just looking around, really, with my friend Rusharack here."<P>
			The banker nodded thoughtfully.  "I see.  Well, should you need to deposit or withdraw any funds or items, I can certainly accomodate you.  In fact -- Teramenor, was it? -- I believe you have a few gold pieces already in your account."<P>
			I blinked.  "What?  How could I?  I've never been here."<P>
			The banker laughed.  "Ah, you are not aware of how the banks in Norrath work, eh?  We are all magically connected; what you deposit at one bank can be withdrawn at any other.  And according to my records," he said, consulting a large bound tome on the counter, "Five gold pieces were deposited in your account by... hmm."<P>
			"What?"<P>
			"Well, usually the depositor is recorded, but there is only an empty space here."  He turned the tome around to show me.  At the top of the page was my name, "Teramenor of Felwithe".  Below it was a single entry in a chart of lines, indicating a five gold piece deposit by an unknown party.<P>
			"This book itself is magical," the banker said.  "All I need do is think of a person's name and it shows me their account information.  Very convenient.  Would you like to withdraw your gold?"<P>
			I shrugged.  "Sure, I guess.  What am I going to do with all that gold?"<P>
			The banker laughed again, his voice light.  "My friend, you surely must be new to the ways of the world.  Five gold pieces is a pittance compared to what can be gained.  Although it is more than enough to get you started on the path of adventure.  I recommend you seek out some of the merchants here in Kelethin; they will gladly sell you food, armor, weapons, or whatever else you need.  Five gold pieces is not much, but it is not nothing."<P>
			I nodded.  "Then I'll take the gold."  Willaen nodded and knelt down under the counter.  I couldn't see what he did, but a few seconds later he stood up and handed me five shiny gold coins.  They clinked in his hand.<P>
			"Be not too wary of the money, friend, for more can always be gained.  But spend it wisely, and your life will be easier, I promise.  Now take care!"<P>
			<CENTER><HR WIDTH="150"></CENTER>
<P>
			I stepped outside, the gold coins still in my hand.  Rusharack stood on his tiptoes and peered at them.  "That's a good few hours' work of hunting," he said.  "In Kaladim, the merchants will pay well for all sorts of debris... bat wings, bone chips, rat ears."  He shuddered.  "Quite disgusting, but they'll buy almost unlimited amounts of them.  I can't imagine what they do with all that."<P>
			"I don't know either," I said, "but if we can clean the forests of these creatures, and make money doing it, then I can hardly complain."  Rusharack nodded in agreement.<P>
			"So what do you--"  I jerked back as something hot and orange flew past my face, landing with a dull THOK in the wooden door of the bank.  I bumped into Rusharack and fell to the ground, but the dwarf already had his sword out and kept his balance.  I looked over the edge of the platform, and saw dull greenish shapes moving on the ground below, fifty or sixty feet down.  I couldn't really make them out... they almost looked like what I had heard described as--<P>
			"ORCS!" someone shouted.  I turned to see several wood elves rushing to the edge of the platform, all carrying large bows and quivers of arrows.  One of them stopped to pull the burning arrow that had almost hit me from the door, stamping it to ash on the platform.  A few more seconds, I realized, and it would have caught the wood on fire.<P>
			The elves were raining arrows into the darkness below, and some shouts and muffled screams were heard as the orcs received the arrows.  The sounds were low, and growling, like animals.  More flaming arrows arced up toward the city; some fell short, some overshot, but many, too many, seemed to land on the wooden deck.  For lack of anything better to do, I ran about stamping them out as I could.  One nicked my side, and scorched the skin a little, but I put the wound out of my head as I tried to prevent fire after fire.  Rusharack, his sword useless up here, did the same.<P>
			As I leapt into the air to yank a burning shaft from the central trunk, I noticed an orc climbing up over the edge of the platform.  It had a rusty-looking hatchet in one hand and was clawing its way up with the other.  I didn't have time to figure out how it had gotten there, for instinct grabbed me: I chanted the words of burning, and the orc's hand caught flame in a tiny explosion.  It shrieked and let go to try and smother the flames, realizing too late that it would need at least one hand to hold on.  It disappeared from sight and I heard a thump from the ground below a moment later.<P>
			Other parts of the city had been less well-defended; I saw, down a wooden ramp on the next platform, several orcs advancing slowly, on the lookout for elves.  I shouted to the wood elves who were still loosing arrows from the edge, but only one of them looked at me.  I pointed down the ramp, and the elf craned his neck to see.  He then shouted something that I realized was in Elvish, not common.  I could understand it, of course, but Rusharack looked lost.  I translated.<P>
			"He's warning them of the orcs.  They're speaking in Elvish so the orcs don't know what they're saying... I guess."  Rusharack and I ran over to the top of the ramp; he held his sword up, ready to meet the orcs.  Three wood elves appeared next to us and loosed three arrows, two of them hitting orcs square.  The beasts screamed in pain and fell off the ramp, tumbling to the forest floor below.  The third arrow hit an orc in the arm, and it too screamed, but advanced even faster.  I chanted the words again, and a ball of flame leapt from my fingers, singeing the orc's dirty, matted hair.  But the orc didn't slow, and three more came behind it.<P>
			Rusharack leapt into the air, slashing downward with his sword.  One of the orcs tried to club him out of the air, but missed, his weapon smashing into the side of the ramp and shaking it.  The dwarf landed atop the orcs, collapsing most of them in a smelly, grunting heap; then Rusharack rolled off of them and down the ramp, to their rear.  I began chanting again, but different words this time; green flashes radiated from my hands, and the one standing orc recoiled slightly; when the flashes soldified into a dagger in my hand, the orc grinned and leapt at me.<P>
			I deliberately fell backward.  The orc had failed to account for the upward slope and distance of the ramp, and his own sword stopped short of my chest.  I rolled aside as the orc scrabbled to stand, then hurled the dagger at him.  It caught him in the face, slashing a wound on his cheek.  He grunted and reeled back, and I began chanting once more.  The fire exploded to his left side, and he moved to the right to avoid it.  Unfortunately for him, he was already at the edge of the ramp, and cartwheeled in the air as he fell to the ground below.<P>
			I saw Rusharack at the bottom of the ramp, hacking at the remaining orcs.  The wood elves had nocked and fired again, downing one orc and injuring another.  The third fell as Rusharack took a mighty swing and lopped off its head.<P>
			The last orc lay moaning on the ramp, and Rusharack leaped to kill it, but one of the wood elves beside me shouted, "Wait!  We can interrogate him."  He gestured and the other two elves leapt down and grabbed the wounded orc, dragging him up the ramp.<P>
			Rusharack leaned on his sword, its point grinding into the ramp.  "Are you okay?" I asked.<P>
			He nodded.  "Yes, took a few hits, but nothing serious.  Let's find an inn and rest."<P>
