If you do send screenshots, please send YOUR OWN.  I could go download screenshots from Illia's Everquest Beastiary all day long, but that would be rude. :)<BR><BR>

Oh yeah... special thanks to <A HREF="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com">Illia's Everquest Beastiary</A> for offering up any pics I want to use to fill out the Guide ;)<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B>THINGS THE GUIDE NEEDS:</B></FONT> If you have nice, clean screenshots of the mobs involved in the quest, they would be most appreciated.  I prefer that screenshots be fullscreen, with no HUD (i.e. hit F10 until all your little floating windows go away), with the mob centered and well-lit, and ideally with their name displayed (if you target the mob before taking the picture, the flashing white/blue name often will stand out better against certain backgrounds).  Daytime shots are preferable when possible.  Please send me the ORIGINAL .BMP FILE THAT EVERQUEST CREATES -- PKZIP it up if you can.  I'll do the editing and cropping myself :) Send them to <A HREF="mailto:zulu_bravo@hotmail.com">zulu_bravo@hotmail.com</A>.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>INTRODUCTION</B></FONT><BR><BR>

The Magician epic quest reward is a level 46 spell, Summon Orb.  Once you receive the reward, you scribe the spell, which you then may use to SUMMON your epic weapon, the Orb of Mastery.  The nice side effect of this is that when you die, you may SUMMON ANOTHER EPIC WEAPON BEFORE YOU RETRIEVE YOUR CORPSE!  Plus, it doesn't require any reagents like malachite to summon, so you essentially get a free pet for 500 mana (not to mention a kickass primary slot weapon).<BR><BR>

Here is a picture of Toulari Teufelhunden of Brell Serilis wielding the orb:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/toulari_wielding.jpg"><BR><BR>

The Manifest Elements effect is a right-clickable summon of a huge pet that has the appearance of an air pet (but it is NOT an air pet!).  The casting time is 18 seconds according to one source; can anyone verify this, preferably WITH A STOPWATCH?  I also need to know whether the Orb vanishes once you cast the pet, since its single charge is gone; I'm under the impression that it doesn't, but I'd like a firsthand account.  I *ALSO* need to know whether the Orb acts as a focus item for any other pets, and whether there'd be any reason to ever use any of your other pets once you have the Orb.  The pet looks like this:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/vreminsk_pet.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Picture courtesy of Vreminsk Valkyre of Innoruuk</FONT><BR><BR>

According to Chris Babb, the epic pet always hits for max 67, is always level 48, has a DD attack for 160 damage and a 6 second stun, has 2500hp and a 50 point damage shield.  If anyone else can confirm these numbers, that would be great.<BR><BR>

To get the Orb of Mastery (or really, the Summon Orb spell), you turn in the four Elements to the Master of Elements in the Plane of Sky.  Each of the four Elements (Wind, Water, Earth, Fire) is itself a sub-quest, where you must turn in three or four items to an NPC, who will reward you with the corresponding element.  (Earth and Fire each require four items; Air and Water each require three items.)  All but three of the 14 items are simple drops from mobs; some high-level and rare, some lower-level and common.  Two of the 14 items are your lower-level focus items from the Temple of Solusek Ro.  The last item, the Power of the Orb, is an item for the Element of Fire sub-quest.  The Power of the Orb itself requires 3 sub-items to be traded in; each of those 3 sub-items needs either 3 or 4 items.  A tree diagram looks like this:<BR><BR>

The symbol preceding each item indicates whether or not:<BR>
* = you can (probably) do it solo<BR>
&amp; = it will require multiple people to get (i.e. not even a level 60 mage could safely do it solo)<BR>

Do not confuse the Power of Water, Power of Earth, etc. with the Element of Water, Element of Earth, etc.  The "Power of" items are for the "Power of the Elements" sub-sub-quest of the Power of the Orb sub-quest, and the "Element of" items are the four items you turn in to the Master of Elements to GET YOUR EPIC QUEST REWARD.<BR><BR>

<B>A WARNING: DO NOT COMPLETE THE ELEMENT OF WIND QUEST UNTIL LAST OR YOU WILL POP THE MASTER OF THE ELEMENTS AND HE WILL DEPOP BEFORE YOU GET THE OTHER ELEMENTS DONE.</B>  This means that you should have completed and acquired the Element of Fire, Element of Earth, and Element of Water, BEFORE you go to the Plane of Sky and turn in your items for the Element of Wind.<BR><BR>

However, Dohpaz Xorbelbeeb of Prexus says that if you go to Kihun Solstin and say, "I want to see the master" and the Master of Elements will spawn.  Graccil Baldinghead of Tribunal confirms this to be true, as do several other people.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="red"><B>SOME NOTES ABOUT THE PLANES</B></FONT><BR><BR>

This isn't self-evident since some people simply don't know about it.  The Planes of Sky and Hate are not connected to any other zone through normal means; you cannot zone into them the same way you zone from Freeport to East Commonlands.  There is only one way to get to the Planes: the level 46 wizard spells "Alter Plane: Hate" and "Alter Plane: Sky".  These spells teleport the wizard and his group to the port-in house in the Plane of Hate, or the first island in the Plane of Sky.  Note that it uses up a reagant ("a Fulligrans Soulstone" for Hate, and "a Cloudy Stone of Veeshan" for Sky) which each cost over 200pp.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="red"><B>OTHER NOTES</B></FONT><BR><BR>

Some of the other epic quests (Cleric and Monk, for example) require you to do things in a certain order.  You must get item A, give it to mob B, which will cause mob C to spawn, who you kill for item D, and so on.  The magician epic has items that can all be acquired in ANY ORDER.  The only time that "order" matters is, as noted above, when you turn in the Element of Wind items, because this causes the Master of Elements to spawn.  (There are one or two instances with the Power of the Orb sub-sub-quest where you are "supposed" to talk to someone who gives you an item to give to someone else, but, these SHOULD BE optional.  Do them anyway!  It's epic, man!)<BR><BR>

Also, in the cases of items from the Plane of Hate and Plane of Sky, you need to be level 46 to even be teleported into those zones.  For your own safety, we recommend that you are at least level 47, and preferably 49 (as our level 49 pets are MUCH more powerful than our level 44 pets), before you enter the planes.<BR><BR>

As a result of this, it is impossible to complete the quest before level 46 (and since the result is a level 46 spell, even if you somehow managed to get it before you were level 46, you could not scribe the spell or summon the Orb anyway).  You can talk to most (if not all) of the quest NPCs, and turn in any items you DO acquire for the appropriate reward, but since you have to be 46 to use the spell (and you have to be 46 to go to Hate and Sky to get their corresponding items), there is little point in worrying about it until you are level 46.<BR><BR>

Some terminology:<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ffff80">always drop</FONT></B> - This refers to items that will always drop when you kill the mob.  There are possibly some cases where the drop rate might be high but not 100%, but when I mark something as "always drop", it means that every time I've killed the mob, it's dropped the item.  More to the point, there are no recorded instances of the mob NOT dropping the item.  This doesn't mean that it won't happen, just that no one's yet seen it happen.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ffff80">common drop</FONT></B> - At least 20% of the time.  While one in five may not seem all that common (some "common drops" are 100% of the time!), since most of the mobs here are rapid spawns, you'll end up with the item in short order assuming you camp the mob for a little while.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ffff80">semi-rare drop</FONT></B> - 10-20% of the time.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ffff80">rare drop</FONT></B> - 5-10% of the time.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ffff80">very rare drop</FONT></B> - less than 5% of the time.<BR>
<BR>

Keep in mind that these are GUIDELINES; since we don't have enough data to be positive about them, the terms are assigned to tbe best of our ability.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="spawntimes"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+1">A NOTE ABOUT SPAWN TIMES</FONT></B><BR><BR>

All spawn times are in REAL TIME, NOT GAME TIME.  E.g., a spawn time of "1 day" means 1 regular real life Earth day, not one day in Norrath (which is 72 minutes in real life).<BR><BR>

Okay.  Here's the quest itself!<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/vd_master_of_elements.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Picture courtesy of Varia Darselai of The Tribunal</FONT><BR><BR>

Turn in the following four items:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#elementoffire">Element of Fire</A>
<LI><A HREF="#elementofearth">Element of Earth</A>
<LI><A HREF="#elementofwater">Element of Water</A>
<LI><A HREF="#elementofwind">Element of Wind</A>
</UL>

to the Master of Elements, a named air elemental in the Plane of Sky.  Each of the four Elements is a quest all its own, and they are detailed below.<BR><BR>

The Master of Elements spawns when you give Kihun Solstin, who is also in the Plane of Sky, the three items he needs in order to give you the Element of Wind, so be sure to turn in the items to Kihun Solstin LAST, when you are ready to complete the quest.<BR><BR>

Give the four Elements to the Master of Elements, which will then give you the Summon Orb spell.  The spell, when cast, summons the Orb of Mastery:<BR><BR>

Jennus Lyklobar is a male gnome magician wandering the edge of the Skyfire Mountains.  I found him near coordinates (+1800, +5000), on the wall, walking north.  He wears a magenta-colored robe.<BR><BR>

No info yet, although Uzz of Bristlebane sends the following info:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff">I have seen Neh'Ashiir on lvl 55 and he is a Enchanter his PH is a Black Reaver that spawns in the top hut.  When the Reaver is killed another mob spawns in his place and it can be Neh'Ashiir or another Black Reaver if a Reaver then you need to kill him again until you get Neh'Ashiir to spawn.  Black Reaver can be up to lvl 52 and is totaly MR, FR and others i think too.</FONT><BR><BR>

Jeff (no surname? no game name? tsk tsk ;)) sends the following info:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff">He spawns in the final hut in the Sky area of City of Mist.  I've killed him 6 times, no Torch so far.  I hear people have to kill him up to 10 to 15 times to get it.  His spawn time, along with all hte other Reaver-related mobs, is a few hours.  I don't know exactly how many, but it's too long to stay and wait for another with a full group without them getting too antsy to leave.<BR><BR>

He's harder than Lord Ghiosk, but a LOT easier than Rak'Ashiir, thank goodness.<BR><BR>

I took him out with 2 groups, levels 53-60, with no shaman or chanter to slow.  I think if I had just one group 55-60 with a shaman or enchanter I could have done it with that.  I never saw him cast any spells, but since we killed him very quickly, we could have missed his spells entirely.<BR><BR>

A tactic for killing him a lot that a good friend of mine told me (thanks Zandar!) is to bind on a safe spot on the Sky ramp, and then whenever you're ready to take him on, get a bunch of folks, get a CoH anchor, and gate and CoH them all up directly to him.  It makes it a LOT easier if you don't have to kill everything in the zone to get to him every time (which is what you have to do otherwise).</FONT><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/vd_burning_embers.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Picture courtesy of Varia Darselai of The Tribunal</FONT><BR><BR>

The Burning Embers are a confirmed drop off Nezekezena, Gylton (again confirmed by Zephermen Furycaster of Rodcet Nife), and now (thanks to Orko Soulblighter) Phurzikon, another named wurm in Burning Wood.<BR><BR>

Reports indicate that if you go to Nezekezena's spawn location (about (-450, -2550) in Burning Wood) and kill everything in sight, eventually Nez or his (her?) placeholders will start spawning with a cycle time of 90 seconds.  People have evidenced acquiring Burning Embers at a rate of 1 or 2 in a few hours' time with this method.  Phurzikon and Nezekezna both spawn on this spot, and they are both strong; sometimes Nez or Phurz will spawn two times in a row, so your group had better be strong enough to take them.<BR><BR>

Nezekezena, if not killed when she spawns, will wander sometimes along the east and south walls of the zone, so if you can't find her near her spawn, look there.  A tracker would definitely help.<BR><BR>

Phurzikon apparently spawns on the same spawn point as Nezekezena.<BR><BR>

Thanks to Kelston Bernstar for contributing info about Nezekezena and Phurzikon.<BR><BR>

Marthisdil of Prexus confirms that *BOTH* Nezekezena AND Phurzikon can drop the Burning Embers, and have, as of 2001-04-25.<BR><BR>

Kindir tells me that Nezekezena and Phurzikon also have another place where they can spawn in Burning Wood: At (+2450, +600).  It's the same deal as the other spawn point; 80-90 second spawn time with placeholders.  Zacatac of Bristlebane confirms this; she (?) says that the actual loc is (+2700, +1000), but the info is otherwise correct.<BR><BR>

Apparently Gylton, another named wurm in the Burning Wood, can also drop the Burning Embers.  Barbel Tchitchaah of Karana says (edited for clarity :) ):<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff">About Gylton's spawn: I'm not sure of the exact loc.  This named wurm wanders near the Skyfire zone.  Once you kill him, either he spawns again or Entalon spawns (5 minutes after), and when you kill Entalon, either Entalon or Gylon spawns again.  I've never had many difficulties finding him, just kill a few mobs near Skyfire (just after the ruins, before the way to zone), and eventually you'll see him.  Of course, a tracker would be a great help.  Gylton hit for around 145-155 max, isn't always the same level.  I saw him be level 45, but lower sometimes too.  He's a warrior type wurm (huge hit range, very low aggro range, Ring of Scale faction), and I don't feel he's harder than a standard wurm of the same level.  About soloing him at level 49, I would say yes, you basically would use the same level spells I use when I see him: Earth pet to tank and root, Shock of Swords of course (never never never use fire based DDs, they will resist fire too much to be effective), but also the level 49 conjuration-based Rain of Swords, Gylton and wurms in general have low resists against it, so it's actually mana effective and a good way to kill him fast with SoS between waves (editor's note: Verant is considering fixing the rain spells so that one of the waves is not eaten up by your pet, so this may become an even more efficient spell!).  Just make sure you are at full mana and use a SoW potion before fighting and nuke all you can, you'll be fine :) If you got a druid to track, you can switch to snare kiting also, but beware of adds in this zone.  Make Gylton follow you near the Skyfire zone, because fighting in the forest can be very dangerous.</FONT><BR><BR>

Note that Gylton has been spotted as far east as (+3440, -2468).<BR><BR>

Jeremy Champlin, who plays on Bristlebane, however, has said that no mage he knows of has gotten the Burning Embers off Gylton; you're probably better off focusing on Nezekezena.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/rykas.jpg"><BR><BR>

Rykas can be found in Lake Rathetear, on the rocks at approximately (+950, -650).  He is a gnome wearing a bright yellow robe.  As far as I know, he never moves from his spawn area, and he's pretty much always there.  I showed up to find him in the middle of the game day (around 2pm game time) and he was sitting there with his earth pet.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#aaaaaa">You say, 'hail Rykas'</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff">Rykas says 'Greetings Soandso , I am Rykas, chronicler of knowledge.

Rykas then gives you the Token of Mastery:<BR><BR>

Take the Token of Mastery to Jahsohn Aksot in the West Commonlands and give it to him (see the <A HREF="#magikotwords">Words of Magi'kot</A> entry below).<BR><BR>

Rykas then rewards you with the Power of the Orb, a scroll that you can read.  Immediately after he gave me the Power of the Orb, he despawned, and then he INSTANTLY respawned about 10 feet away.  This probably has something to do with game mechanics, and it doesn't affect the quest at all.<BR><BR>

Jahsohn Aksot is a human mage who is found wandering in the West Commonlands.  He is near the Kithicor zone border, either wandering along the road that leads south from the Kithicor border, or a little ways east, wandering through the trees.  If he has summoned a pet (he does not always do this) you can use Sense Summoned to find him.  Otherwise, bring a tracker, or just wander around until you see him.  He is wearing a bright blue robe.<BR>

<A NAME="page1"></A><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#ffff80"><B>* Torn Page of Magi'kot 1 (Kithicor Forest: "dread wolf", "dreaded wolf", "enraged dread wolf", always drop)</B></FONT><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/torn_magikot_1.jpg"><BR><BR>

Reports indicate that any of the dread wolves ("dread wolf", "dreaded wolf", "enraged dread wolf") in Kithicor at night, will drop this item.  Be careful; even a level 46 mage with his strongest pet can be overrun in seconds by himself.  You can probably do this part solo at 49 without too much difficulty, but for safety's sake, TAKE A GROUP WITH YOU ANYWAY.  I got my page 1 off an "enraged dread wolf", which was easy to kill once I was able to engage it near the West Commonlands zone border, without fear of random zombie troopers showing up to ruin my day.  Or rather, night.  I had the help of two warriors, a cleric, and a wizard, and we dispatched the enraged dread wolf easily.  Then a zombie trooper showed up, and my pet soloed it while the others took on a dread wolf that came out of nowhere!  Both the enraged dread wolf and the dread wolf dropped the Torn Page of Magi'kot 1.<BR><BR>

Senrye Talbanath of Drinal tells me that she and some friends went to Kithicor to get the Torn Page of Magi'kot 1.  They killed 5 dread wolves and 1 dreaded wolf, and none of them dropped the page; they also killed two enraged dread wolves, and both times the page dropped.  This may have been random chance, or it may be indicative of a change in the drop rates.  In either event, it's probably still more efficient to kill whatever wolves come your way.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/torn_magikot_2.jpg"><BR><BR>

At level 39 I was on a guild raid into Unrest.  Nearly every mob in the zone conned blue to me, with the exception of some Festering Hags, and these puppies.  Get a group of high 30s/low 40s together, and you can clear out the entire Unrest basement single-handedly.  Of the handful of Tentacle Terrors we killed, at least 2 and maybe 3 of them dropped the page.  These nasties are usually found in the last room in the basement, where Garanel Rucksif (the ghost dwarf) spawns.  They aren't all that hard to kill, but you'll want a group, because TTs are casters, either shadow knight or necromancer class (though they didn't have any pets, and they didn't harm touch that I could tell).  They cast lifetap- and disease-based spells.<BR><BR>

Also please note that there are tentacle terrors in Najena, but the Najena TTs are much lower level AND THEY DO NOT DROP the Torn Page of Magi'kot 2.<BR><BR>

Somebody Who Didn't Bother To Leave His Name told me that "a dark terror", in the Unrest basement, can also drop the Torn Page 2.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/torn_magikot_3.jpg"><BR><BR>

I spent about half of level 42 in the Frenzy camp in Lower Guk.  This was a good level to be there; most mobs conned low blue to even (a handful of yellows); the groups' members ranged anywhere from 38 to 52.  I was there for exp and loot, since I wasn't really aware of the fact that the page dropped from bloodthirsty ghouls (and, as it turns out, the Frenzied Ghoul itself can also drop the page).  If you are in this camp for even a couple of hours, you will with certainty see bloodthirsty ghouls, and probably at least one frenzied ghoul, and about one out of four of the BTs dropped page 3.  (I saw about four pages while I was there, not including the one that a party member looted accidentally 'cause he didn't know what it was.)  BTG's are strong warriors, but a normal Frenzy group can take them easily.  If you're building a party to go down there (and for some reason it's not already camped), BRING AN ENCHANTER.  The best room to camp in is the rectanguler anteroom just outside of the frenzied ghoul's room, since only a couple of weaker frogloks actually spawn in that room; you can actively pull from the surrounding rooms into it safely.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/walnan.jpg"><BR><BR>

Walnan tends to wander along the path from the Butcherblock docks, to near Kaladim.  When I found her, she was standing behind a tree just upslope of the road near the last dwarf guard hut before you reach Kaladim.  However she can be in the area north of the road near the docks.  Your best bet is to cast Sense Summoned in this area, which will hopefully lead you to Walnan's pet.  Or, find a druid or ranger to track her for you.  Walnan is a female High Elf wearing a purple robe.<BR>

<A NAME="powerearth"></A><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#ffff80"><B>* Power of Earth (Lesser Faydark: "a faerie guard", rare drop (?))</B></FONT><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/power_of_earth.jpg"><BR><BR>

If you've killed faerie guards for your Robe of the Elements quest, well, you know how they go.  I got lucky; some guildmates and I were in Lesser Faydark helping a druid guildmate camp Brownie Scouts for an epic quest item.  During a break in the spawns, I SoW-ran with my air pet over to the faerie village, and pulled the faerie guard who spawns east of the village (behind a tree).  One Shock of Swords, and two seconds being beat on by my pet, and the faerie dropped dead.  I guess I was lucky because she dropped both the Power of Earth (a black ball, looks like a black pearl or a Glowing Black Stone) and the Twice-Woven Cloak (for the RotE quest), so I was able to go complete the RotE yet again.<BR><BR>

Faerie guards are easy if they're green to you, since they will only come one at a time when you pull them.  They are typical warrior mobs, nothing out of the ordinary for their level (max 24).  Don't confuse them with Fairy Guards, who are not the same mob (I don't know whether they drop the same loot).<BR><BR>

Faeries have the Faerie faction, though as far as I know only faeries are sensitive to this faction, so once you kill a few faerie guards, you will be KOS to the faeries and will not be able to travel safely through their village.  However there don't appear to be any other places in Norrath where this faction comes into play.<BR><BR>

Two separate sources have stated that they camped the Faerie village, killing more or less everything in sight, upwards of 8 hours before getting their Power of Earth.  Damn, I'm lucky.<BR><BR>

<B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#ff0000">*** UPDATE ***</FONT> Due to changes in Lesser Faydark, apparently the Power of Earth now ALSO drops off a mob called "an undead sprite guard".  One source says she killed 15 of them and got 2 Powers of Earth, so either she's lucky or the drop rate increased.  However, the Power of Earth STILL drops off faerie guards.</B><BR><BR>

<A NAME="powerfire"></A><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#ffff80"><B>* Power of Fire (Sol A: "blazing elemental" rare drop, "lava elemental", common drop?)</B></FONT><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/power_of_fire.jpg"><BR><BR>

Boring but easy camp if you have your 39 pets or better, and even at 34 you SHOULD be able to do this solo although it will be more work.  I personally had to camp for about 3.5 hours to get the Power of Fire; lucky for me, it was 4 am and I was going to give up for the night after one last spawn, and lucky me, it had the Power of Fire.<BR><BR>

The Blazing Elementals spawn in the north part of Sol A, in a pit that has two false ceilings (rather, false floors in two other rooms) and a ramp that leads into another room where nothing spawns.  (If you have the EQ Atlas map of Sol A (http://www.eqatlas.com/solusekseyemap.html), the Blazing Elementals pit is marked at spot 3, and the unoccupied room is the small, perfectly square room just southwest of the "3".<BR><BR>

At first I camped in that room, waiting for the Blazing Elementals to spawn (they are on roughly a 19-minute spawn timer) and meanwhile pulling some of the surrounding goblins just to pass the time.  I even tried clearing out the entire circular area surrounding these rooms (everything north of -200 on the map), but that was too much effort.  I finally figured out that the simplest way to do it, was to sit in the Blazing Elemental pit ITSELF, and wait for the BEs to spawn.  They would immediately aggro on me, and my fire pet (sitting there waiting with me) would beat them to dust in a few seconds.  One of the reasons I did this was because I could simply sit there meditating, and I'd read a book, so I wasn't bored.  (Even killing green goblins over and over got tedious.)  The mobs would spawn, I'd move away a few steps, and my Jobaner would kill them.  The other reason was, given enough time, Blazing Elementals will cast a fire shield on themselves JUST LIKE YOUR FIRE PET, and their shield is JUST AS STRONG.  My level 38 fire pet (from my 44 spell) nearly died the first time it fought a Blazing Elemental, because of the fire shield it had (my pet hit so much it was beating ITSELF to death).  So I had to quickly sit, memorize Nullify Magic, and dispel the BE's fire shield.  Sure I probably could have just nuked it, but...<BR><BR>

If you sit in the BE pit itself, the BEs will aggro on you before they can shield themselves, and your pet will have absolutely no trouble disposing of them.  The BEs are level 25.  The only other threat is the Reckless Efreeti, who is level 28 and spawns near the back of the pit.  He is more or less a level 28 generic warrior mob, easily disposed of by my pet.  I only saw him once, near the end of my camp, and he had no fire shield, nor did he cast any spells.  My pet wiped him out in no time, solo.  He dropped the Platinum Armband.<BR><BR>

The upshot of all this is, the BE camp is boring as hell, yes, but the best solution is, sit in the BE pit with your fire pet guarding you, and get a good book and dig in.  I've heard stories of anywhere from a 20 minute camp to a 20 HOUR camp before getting the Power of Fire (which has the graphic of a red gem, just like a Ruby), but it's probably on average about a 4-5 hour camp.  Just stick with it and you'll get it.<BR><BR>

It is commonly considered as true that the lava elemental in the rear of Sol A (behind the gnome castle) drops the Power of Fire as its common loot, but I have not personally confirmed this.  If you are camping the blazing elementals, and want to deal with running over to see if the lava elemental has popped, feel free to do so.  Also, Dark Elf magicians or people who have bad faction with the gnomes in Sol A will have a difficult time doing this, which is probably why the Power of Fire drops off the BEs.<BR><BR>

Sumoner Deltorros of Bristlebane says that the Power of Fire is at best an uncommon drop off the lava elemental; at least, the PoF does NOT drop every time you kill the lava elemental.<BR><BR>

Bahmut Illuminarie of Ayonae Ro says that he killed the lava elemental 9 times before the Power of Fire dropped.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/power_of_water.jpg"><BR><BR>

Any of the various raveners in this zone can drop the Power of Water.  I got lucky.  I went to Kaesora by myself; there were one or two other people in the zone.  I levitated down the eastern drop from the entry room, summoned a pet, went linkdead, came back, summoned another pet, and was almost immediately attacked by a famished ravener.  My earth pet rooted it and I nuked it half to death; my pet finished it off.  The ravener dropped the Power of Water, and I immediately gated out.<BR><BR>

Kaesora is a dangerous dungeon, even at high levels, to visit yourself.  (I was foolish to do so; take a group with you!)  Raveners are found all over the dungeon, but they are not very common mobs; they are found mostly in the upper levels to the east of the entry room, and sometimes down in the Five Towers area where Xalgoz lives.  Raveners will drop the power of water rather frequently; one good night's session camping the dungeon for exp will almost certainly get you a Power of Water.<BR><BR>

Gypsy Dancers themselves are only level 25-26, but the room they primarily spawn in (the ballroom in Mistmoore) also contains lots of higher level mobs, usually in the low 30s.  If you have a group of 30+ people and can safely handle one mob at a time (either because you have a monk to pull or an enchanter to mez), then breaking in and camping the ballroom should be not too difficult.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/akksstaff.jpg"><BR><BR>

Akksstaff wanders in random places in Najena.  When I found him, he was literally standing at the zone border to the Lavastorm Mountains.  Reports have him in almost any spot in Najena; inside various rooms, in the dungeon cell with Linara Parlone, in the goblin caverns, etc.  He is a male Dark Elf wearing a hideous brownish-green robe.<BR><BR>

Kelston Bernstar reports that Akksstaff's spawn point is in the hallway that leads to Rathyl's and Linara's cells, and he will eventually wander.  Akksstaff can have a spawn time of (apparently) anywhere from a couple of hours up to THREE DAYS.  So don't kill him!  Akksstaff has also been seen spawning in Najena's room itself!<BR><BR>

For my part, I was in Lavastorm on my way to Nagafen's Lair, and I shouted, "Anyone heading to Najena, if you see Akksstaff, it's worth 20 platinum pieces."  A few minutes later, someone sent me a tell that Akksstaff was standing at the zone, so I rushed over there, talked with Akksstaff (below) and gave the lucky player his 20pp.<BR><BR>

When you're in your 20s, Najena is a good place to go for loot and exp.  It's a "doable" dungeon, meaning a single group of mid-to-high 20s (or even low 30s) can crawl through the dungeon, clearing it out room by room.  A single crawl, even if you kill every mob in the dungeon, is not likely to net you all four pages; I spent a good 5-6 hours there both at levels 40 and 46, killing literally every mob in the dungeon, before I gathered all four Pages.  Keep at it, and you'll get it.  Note that the Pages can drop off both the goblin magicians found in the northern caverns, as well as the Dark Elf magicians, and even a few of the named mobs in the zone.  I personally looted the Wind page off of Rathyl.  (Paul White confirms that he looted the Water page off of Rathyl incarnate, who can spawn right after you kill Rathyl.)<BR><BR>

If you're higher level like I am (45+), it's relatively trivial to solo literally the entire zone.  Just run about killing everything you see, and eventually you'll get all the Pages.  You can even go to Najena's room, since the new spell Summon Companion allows us to pull our pet out of the pool near Najena's room once we're done killing her and her friends.<BR><BR>

The spawn time in this zone is around 18 minutes, and it will take about that long to hit all of the other spawns you need to hit.  These are:<BR><BR>

1. BoneCracker and the necromancers in his room (you only really need to hit this once, for the key that BoneCracker drops), plus the Ogre Captain (again, only once, for the key he drops).<BR>
2. Trazdon and the magician[s] in his room.  (I don't know whether Trazdon is capable of dropping the Pages, because I only killed him once and he didn't drop them that time, so it's hard to tell.  But the magicians certainly do drop the pages, so it's worth a trip.)<BR>
3. The magician at the front gate of the castle area (where the entry caverns end).<BR>
4. The magician in the room behind her.<BR>
5. The two magicians in the Crystal Room.<BR>
6. The two necromancers and Drelzna (or her PH, another Necro) in Drelzna's room.  (As necromancers do not drop the pages, this is not strictly a necessary trip, though Drelzna does drop the key to Najena's room.  <B>Fun Fact:</B> Did you know that Drelzna used to drop Journeyman's Boots as her rare drop?)<BR>
7. The three magicians in the antechamber outside Rathyl's room.<BR>
8. Rathyl or his placeholder (a magician or various elementals) in Rathyl's room (and Rathyl reincarnate, if it spawns).<BR>
9. The three goblin camps in the north caves.  One is in a cul-de-sac to the west; the other two are in rooms to the east and north.<BR><BR>

If you hit these spots in this order, you will sooner or later get all the Pages.  Be wary of other people camping the dungeon for exp and loot; don't run over their camps.  But do shout to the zone that you're looking for the Pages, and if people could please not loot them and tell you, that would be nice.  A friendly group of low-20's adventurers were camping Trazdon's room when one of the magicians there dropped the Water Page (the last one I needed); I gave one of them the 12 platinum I had earned in the 2 hours I spent trying to get the Water Page, and she was ecstatically thankful.<BR><BR>

You will need some keys to get around the dungeon.  The best order for this, is thus: Go to BoneCracker's room and kill him.  He will drop the "Dull Bone Key" (DBK).  Then go to the nearby Ogre Captain, and kill him, for he drops the "Shiny Metal Key" (SMK).  The SMK opens the cell outside Rathyl's room; the DBK opens Rathyl's room itself.  Kill Rathyl or his placeholders until Rathyl drops the "Bloodstained Key" (BSK) (this key is NORENT so if you go linkdead or camp, you will need to get it again).  The BSK opens the door to Drelzna's room.  Drelzna drops the "Golden Crescent Key" (GCK), but this only leads to Najena's room, and you don't really need to go there, so just stick the GCK in a bag and forget about it unless you really feel like killing Najena.  The GCK is also NORENT.  (The DBK and SMK are NOT NORENT, you can hang onto them forever, and probably should if you have to camp this place more than once.)<BR><BR>

Virtually nothing in this dungeon has more than 600 hit points or hits for more than 50 damage (except the Widowmistress, a high-30s dark elven rogue who is *incredibly* fast and *incredibly* dangerous, and spawns in the northwest corner of the dungeon, beyond all the goblin camps).  The magicians and necromancers will all have pets and will cast their appropriate class spells, but otherwise are trivial to kill at high level.  They can be difficult at lower levels, however (fighting 3 necros solo at 39 can get you killed if you aren't careful).  The named mobs are, as expected, somewhat more difficult, but not much.<BR><BR>

A quick summary of which pages dropped of what mobs in Najena, although I don't know whether there's any relationship between them:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Water dropped off a magician in Trazdon's room.
<LI>Wind dropped off Rathyl.
<LI>Earth dropped off a magician in the main castle area, although I also saw several pages of Earth drop off the goblin magicians in the north caves.
<LI>Fire dropped off a goblin magician in the north caves.  I believe I also saw fire drop off one of the dark elf magicians, but I saw it drop off the goblins at least 3 times.
</UL>

Lynn Lively (and many others) tells me that, apparently, the Pages can all be found on the alligators in the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule (a dungeon on the south wall of the Feerrott).  The alligators have historically had the same loot table as the dark elf magicians in Najena, so this is understandable.  Whether there are any other mobs in Cazic Thule that have the Pages is unknown, but unlikely (your best bet for the Pages is still Najena).  Neranek of Cazic Thule confirms this, and said that of 4 alligators he fought near where the Avatar of Fear spawns in the back of the temple, 3 of them dropped pages.  This could have been a fluke, or it could be that those alligators have a high drop rate on the Pages.<BR><BR>

Kelston Bernstar tells me that he has never heard of the pages dropping off Trazdon or "a necromancer", but I still keep them in the list on the off chance that they have the pages in their loot table as a rare drop.<BR><BR>

Sumoner Deltorros of Bristlebane says that he looted the Torn Page of Mastery: Wind off of a darkbone skeleton.  Darkbone skeletons, in my experience, only spawn in the front area of Najena, before you enter the keep proper.<BR><BR>

Trezark S'Dious of Vazaelle confirms that darkbone skeletons can indeed drop the Torn Pages, albeit rarely.  He also says that since Najena is a magician, she MAY drop the pages, but he's never heard of it happening.  He also says that he once found a page on "Rathyl reincarnate", so killing Rathyl is worth the effort (as I said, I got my Wind page off Rathyl himself, and killing "Rathyl reincarnate" gives you a second shot at getting a page).<BR><BR>

Eliadan Starforge of Tunare also confirms that the darkbone skeletons can drop the Pages.  He got one off one of the darkbones in the room full of skeletons near Rathyl's room.<BR><BR>

Deke Everburn of Ayonae Ro says that the necromancer who guards the portal to the Plane of Fear, Cyndreela, can ALSO drop the Pages!  Can someone confirm this?<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/tiblner_milnik.jpg"><BR><BR>

No info yet, although Tiblner is known to wander along the Firiona Vie cliffs, east of the city.  I have personally seen him standing at the north end of the bridge leading out of the Firiona Vie city area, but usually he wanders along the cliffs with his earth pet.  The last time I saw him, he was wandering at about (-2000, -900), a little ways north of the edge of the cliffs, walking east.  He is a male High Elf and wears a brown robe.  Characters who have bad faction with Firiona Vie factions need to be careful as there are numerous mobs (pilgrims and others) who wander the cliffs -- not to mention the regular aggressive mobs like drolvargs, drachnids, leeches, etc.<BR><BR>

<B><FONT COLOR="red">UPDATE:</B></FONT> The Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth <B>*** NO LONGER DROPS OFF INNORUUK ***!</B>  It now drops off a new mob in the Plane of Hate, a mini-boss named Magi P'tasa.  We need details such as his HP, how much he hits for, and so on.  In other words, all the stuff that would go in the fields below.<BR><BR>

Thanks to Bahmut Illuminarie of Ayonae Ro for some basic info about Magi P'tasa.<BR><BR>

Arkahn Tyr'Zhal of Ayonae Ro sent me the following info:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff">
Magi, like all mini bosses, is a semi-rare spawn with a placeholder on a 72 hour timer + or - 12 hours (60-84 hour spawn).  He spawns in 10 different spots:<BR> 
2 in rev house<BR>
2 on top floor in maestro's house<BR>
2 with ashenbone drakes on first floor<BR>
2 in inny's old lair<BR>
2 on second floor of second floor church.<BR><BR> 

This explains why he can spawn a ton in a few hours, or can sometimes never spawn even if hate is cleared completely.  He is NOT always up after patches... but he has a very good chance of being up because he has about a 30% chance of spawning in 10 spots, but sometimes the spots could all be filled with phs (has happened before).  He has 32k hp, hits for max of 200-240 (depending on level of the spawn &gt;&gt; 54-56 &lt;&lt;, and he CAN be slowed, malosini'd and debuffed in many other ways.  He can be taken out with one full group if you are good and have a 60 shaman.<BR><BR>

Drop rates are as follows:<BR>
30% chance of dropping the staff<BR>
30% chance of dropping apothic robe<BR>
40% chance of dropping apothic sleeves, pants, or crown<BR>
50% chance of dropping apothic bracer, gloves, or boots<BR><BR>

so far he is known to drop up to 3 armor pieces at a time<BR><BR>

none of this info except spawn spots has been "verified" yet but i have done a lot of research about the magi :)<BR><BR></FONT>

An interesting note is that the "Ghoul Arch Magus" (or is it "Ghoul Archmage"?) in Lower Guk used to be called the "Ghoul Arch Magi", until someone pointed out that "Magi" is the plural of "Magus".  I wonder of they'll fix Magi P'tasa to be "Magus P'tasa".<BR><BR>

Klex is a level 50 Iksar Skeleton warrior.  He has 11,000 hit points and hits for a max of 137 damage.  He is not particularly fast, he just takes a while to kill.  The easiest way to kill him is to partner with either a necromancer or a druid, and either fear-kite or regular kite.  Kiting with a druid is a little harder, because Klex will sometimes aggro on your pet instead of the druid (you should turn your pet's taunting off, to keep Klex following the druid around while your pet gets hundreds of free attacks from behind).  When Klex kills your pet, summon another one, cast your best Burnout spell on the pet, and send it after Klex.  If you're with a necro and the necro can constantly keep Klex feared, then you'll have an easy time; the downside is, Klex will probably wander past many other wandering mobs, who will aggro and attack you.  With a druid, you can have the druid run in a circle centered on you (meditating while your pet attacks Klex), so you don't have to go anywhere near mobs that spawn.  In either case, pull Klex out of the crater he spawns in (the glowing meteor crater in Burning Wood), or you'll end up dealing with a lot of wandering hornets.  The drop was common for a while, but appears to be rare now.  Expect to kill Klex a number of times.<BR><BR>

In a nutshell: Pull Klex out of the crater, to the south, where there is a large flat area with almost no wandering mobs.  Kite him there, or kill him outright if you have the proper group for it.<BR><BR>

Kelston Bernstar tells me that he killed Slixin Klex 11 times in a row recently, and the Dirt did not drop.  Apparently the Dirt has been nerfed back to its original extremely-rare drop state, instead of its relatively common state.  Sigh.  Another easy mob we have to kill over and over...<BR><BR>

<A NAME="rain"></A><FONT SIZE="+0" COLOR="#ffff80"><B>* Rain of Karana (East Karana: "Tarbul Earthstrider", always drop)</B></FONT><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/rain_of_karana.jpg"><BR><BR>

Tarbul Earthstrider is a named Hill Giant found in the Eastern Planes of Karana.  He roams the large rocky hill in the southern half of EK.  He's a very common spawn; when we arrived to hunt him down, he was already wandering about.  We killed him easily (we were there for another purpose, so we had 2 groups of people together; several warriors, druids, rangers, a cleric, and me, a mage), and he dropped the Rain of Karana.  15 minutes later, he was running around again!<BR><BR>

He was level 48 both times we saw him, and took a lot of punishment, but he went down no problem.  Both times he dropped the Rain of Karana, so it probably will drop every time you kill him.<BR><BR>

Nintalten Legbiter adds, "Trabul [sic] Earthstrider is a piece of cake with a lvl 49 Earth pet and a lvl 44 cleric.  That's how I did it :)"  Apparently if your level 49 earth pet beats on Tarbul, and you have a cleric cast Complete Heal on your pet every so often, Tarbul will go down fairly quickly.  You'd probably want to fire shield and burnout your pet, to speed things up.<BR><BR>

According to Slaariel of Ayonae Ro, Tarbul apparently *does* have a placeholder: "a rogue lion".  Apparently Tarbul is the spawn at least 95% of the time, so I guess Tarbul is really the placeholder for the rogue lion :).<BR><BR>

When I went to take this screenshot, I was level 49.  I was also invisible and TARBUL WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE THROUGH INVIS.  I don't know if this will hold true at lower levels, but it did today!  I didn't stand there gawking at him, incidentally; I took the screenshot and then left, so even though he CONNED indifferent while I was invisible, I didn't test it by waiting for him to aggro.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="tears"></A><FONT SIZE="+0" COLOR="#ffff80"><B>&amp; Tears of Erollisi (Overthere: "Captain Rottgrime", always drop)</B></FONT><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="orb/tears.jpg"><BR><BR>

I joined up with a group of people from various guilds who had banded together to get the good Captain dead, dead, dead, dead.  In fact, they got him four times, and the fourth time, the Tears of Erollisi went to me.  Killing the Captain isn't hard, you just need lots of tanks and clerics.  Casters who have pets can help, but I don't think any other spells will be useful against him.<BR><BR>

Pulling him from the outpost in the Overthere is difficult; the two times I was present, a dragoon was pulled along with him.  He is usually standing near the southeast corner of the Outpost, along with six undead marines, who are level 50.  You'll probably want a monk to feign pull the Captain, and it will be much easier to do at night when the dragoons are out on patrol (fewer things to aggro).  I don't know the exact method that was used however.<BR><BR>

You will take a Venril Sathir faction hit for killing Rottgrime; apparently it's a pretty sizable one, so be careful if you're used to being able to travel there (evil races and classes, for example).<BR><BR>

The following is the body of a post that came from a Monk message board, but the person who sent it to me (Kelston Bernstar of Requiem on The Tribunal) says he doesn't remember who posted it.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff">"Ok, most will never need to know this, but if one person finds it useful, it's not a waste of time.<BR><BR>

Part of the insanely hard magician epic quest involves killing Captain Rottgrime in the outpost in Overthere. He is a level 55 skeleton, and doesn't seem to be too tough to kill.<BR><BR>
 
The trick is pulling him. Capt. Rottgrime is surrounded by 6 or 8 skeletons, all blue to me at 52 (someone said lvl 50, but I'm not sure). Besides that, there is a damn hard 55 or so Golems guarding both side entrances, and 4 gargoyles, level 50-53 or so guarding the main entrance. And still, you have about 4 roaming DE goons, as well as General D'Veers who's tough as nails and a necro. Add to this the fact that most are KOS in the outpost, and it's not a pretty sight.<BR><BR>
 
The pull is actually not that hard. First off, you're probably going to want someone who is not KOS to pull him...Agnostic monks work nicely. My faction in the outpost was kindly, so I can roam freely. You need at least one other non kos person to help, and they dont' necessarily have to have FD. We had a troll warrior.<BR><BR>
 
Have your groups set up camp on the northwest wall, very near the outpost.  Very few roamers, and no goons seem to come up that way. We had 2 groups: 2 clerics, 2 magicians, 1 monk, 1 warrior, 2 necros, 1 druid, 1 shaman (turned out to be overkill), and an enchanter showed up a bit later.<BR><BR>
 
Get in to the outpost, and target rottgrime..stand as far back while still in shuriken range as possible. A great thing to have here is one of those nice snaring nets from Crystal Caverns. Have your lookout watch the golem on the far east side of the outpost, and when he is at his point closest to water, either cast snare net or chuck a shuriken at the captain, turn, and run like hell. If you happen to get stunned, use stone stance. Then run outside the outpost, well outside the gates, then FD. Those things hit hard, but never took more than a bubble or so, even with about 10 on my tail. Have your lookout/tagger run up to Rottgrim and start hailing him. 99% of the time, this will stop him, while everyone else walks back. Either /q to clear aggro, or have your mage CoTH you back, then run back up to capt, or have lookout pull him the rest of the way.<BR><BR>
 
Bang snap pow, easy kill, happy mage. We did it twice, 0 deaths. Faction is rough though...I went from kindly to indifferent in 4 kills (2 capt, 2 goons). And on that note, for some reason a goon always managed to find us and show up with the captain...not a big deal, except for the additional faction hit. The only other advice I can give is to know where the goons are; they leave the outpost at midnight and usually come back or despawn at 10am if memory serves. Try to time it when they are furthest away.<BR><BR>
 
I wrote this for one reason: I asked 3 people about pulling this, and they either said it was impossible to split all those guys, or said to have a cleric with a click stick handy. There are other tactics; some have bards kiting the stuff around and a tagger to pull rottgrime, etc..but this was so clean and fast, seems like a waste of time any other way."<BR><BR>

No info yet, though instead of bothering with a trip to the Hole, I bought mine off a kindly druid for 400pp.  Maybe it wasn't worth the money (it weighs 8 pounds so it's not really usable in normal circumstances), but considering that everyone else I saw selling them was going for atwo to three thousand platinum, it wasn't a bad deal.  Plus, I had the money to spare :)<BR><BR>

<A NAME="pegasus"></A><FONT SIZE="+0" COLOR="#ffff80"><B>* Pegasus Feather Cloak (South Karana: Quillmane, very rare drop)</B></FONT><BR><BR>

Quillmane is a rare spawn, but he can spawn anywhere in the zone.  Most commonly he is found in the interior of the zone, away from the zone walls, but he can be out there, too.  He wanders almost constantly, and is killed almost instantly by any who see him (because the cloak you need for the quest is All/All and has unlimited charges of Levitate...).  This sucks, but it means it takes some real effort to get the cloak.<BR><BR>

Because Quillmane spawns randomly and wanders, the best way to get the cloak is to go to South Karanas with as many high level rangers and druids as you can gather.  More than 5 would be overkill, since you want to be grouped with them all.  Basically, what you should do is summon your pet of choice, get a SoW, and then run around the zone killing anything that wanders.  Static spawns like the Aviaks at their tower or the Tesch Mas Gnolls outside splitpaw, need not be killed (Quillmane doesn't spawn there, and there will always be people camping the Aviaks and Gnolls anyway).  Anything else that wanders -- centaurs, wolves, lions, elephants, aviaks, gnolls, treants (although there is a faction issue there) -- is fair game.  You want five trackers with you because they can always home in on a mob and kill it, and they can do this constantly -- the instant something shows up on tracking, they will go after it and kill it.  And the reason you want to be grouped is, if someone in your group does see Quillmane and kills him, then you will be able to get to the corpse and loot it before it opens up and some ninjalooter steals your cloak!<BR><BR>

Even one high-level tracker with you can make this an easy enough camp.  (To put it another way, one tracker tracking and killing mobs, and Quillmane when he pops, is better than wandering about hoping to encounter Quillmane by yourself!)  If you have even one or two ranger or druid friends who can help, then your life will become immeasurably easier.<BR><BR>

Nevertheless, even with your entire guild scouring the zone for Quillmane, expect to spend at least several hours on getting the cloak.  If you're doing it solo, then may Mithaniel Marr protect your soul...<BR><BR>

James Whitehead sent the following email -- I haven't tested this theory myself but it sounds plausible:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#aaaaff">I have been working on the spawn cycles of Quillimane In South Karana lately and would like to share with my fellow EQ'ers what I have noted.   Quillimane seems to actually have placeholders as do most "named" mobs in everquest.  And in all actualality she seems to be the less rare of some of the "named" mobs.  Now it does appear there are atleast 2 different spawn cycles of the "named" mobs here.  Playing a tracker for 58 levels gives you a little insight into how this can work.  The following are are in Quillimanes spawn cycle,  any named gnoll, ie, shaman ren'rex, high shaman grisok,phido and lenrel do not kill brother drash, he is NOT in the cycle.  I am going to set up 3 spawn points the first spawn point 1 would be just south of the hermit, spawn point 2 will be north of the shadow men and finally spawn point 3 is west of paw, its very difficult to pin point any of these spawn points because as soon as anything spawns it starts moving immeidately.  I have been able to get Quillimane to spawn by running between these points and killing the "Named" spawns as they pop.  However Quillimane seems to only spawn at spawn point 1 from my experience, where she then starts moving towards paw where she is normally spotted and killed. I have killer her now maybe 15-20 times and have gotten the cloak once, sorry I am not a mage, however I am a druid who always runs out of batwings and loves the free wingless levitate effect.  There also seems to be many many named mobs in the zone which I am not totally sure if they are in on the cycle or not, seeing as I have my cloak I havent had time to research it anymore.  These named spawns would be cracktusk, grizzlenot, gnawfang, a rabid gnool,  mroon, some named druids and a barb that can drop a nice weight reduction bag.  I am not totally sure if any of these named ones are in the spawn cycle due to most of them being very rare,  I just stick to killing named gnolls and Quillimane will pop.  Good luck to everyone that needs this item, it is very rare and very nice for everyone to use.</FONT><BR><BR>
