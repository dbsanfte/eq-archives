						Check out the <a href="http://www.skepdic.com" target="_top">Skeptic's Dictionary</a>.  This is a great site that debunks all manner of supernatural, superstitious, paranormal, pseudoscientific nonsense.  A great reference, and almost every entry has links to at least a couple of other sites that further debunk such nonsense.<br><br>
						On a related topic, check out <a href="http://www.csicop.org" target="_top">CSICOP</a>, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.  Basically they're a group of guys who go around debunking the aforementioned nonsense -- psychics, UFO sightings, and so on and so forth.  If you like using your brain and would like to do it more often, go visit this site.<br><br>
						For those of you sick of all this creationist bullshit, check out <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org" target="_top">the official talk.origins website</a>.  talk.origins is a Usenet newsgroup that discusses, scientific-like, the origins of biological life, the universe, and everything.  (Mostly life.)  They've got lots of great material about evolution, including a nice big section on how to counter creationist nonsense.  A definite must-read for anyone who thinks the Kansas State Board of Education needs a collective mental enema.<br><br>
						Also check out <a href="http://www.infidels.org" target="_top">The Secular Web</a>, another good reference (especially the <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/" target="_top">Nontheism</a> library entry on the left).  This is clearly more for atheists, secular humanists and the like than the previous links.  Yes, I'm an atheist.  Odds are, if you have a problem with that, then you don't know what an atheist really is.<br><br>
						And hey, check out the <a href="religion.html">Religion Page</a> on this site, while you're at it.  You might learn a thing or two about me.  Or maybe not.

						<span class="h1b">SUPPORT FREE SOFTWARE!</span> (That's free as in "free speech," not "free beer.")  Here are some links where you can find out about free software and its bastard cousin, open-source software:
						<ul>
						<li>Read my <a href="freeopen.html">Introduction to Free and Open Software</a> (under perpetual revision).
						<li><a href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_top">The Free Software Foundation</a>, started by Richard M. Stallman (RMS, as he is known in the community).  The source of the GNU General Public License, by which any software you write should be licensed.
						<li><a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr" target="_top">Eric S. Raymond's home page</a>.  Don't let the creepy picture fool you: ESR is a major advocate of free/open-source software, and has written several wonderful articles all about them.  He also maintains the <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon" target="_top">Jargon File</a>, and if you are a Studly Geek Programmer like me you will read it all the way through.  Huzzah!
						<li><a href="http://www.slashdot.org" target="_top">Slashdot</a>.  If you aren't visiting this site daily, you're missing out on some great stuff.
						</ul>

						<span class="h1b">This site contains no GIF images.  Why?  Keep reading...</span><br><br>

						The LZW compression algorithm used in GIF images is currently covered under a patent owned by Unisys.  Unisys is being unpleasant with regard to this patent, so I (and others; click on the banner above for <b>LOTS MORE INFORMATION!</b>) encourage you to use something besides GIFs for your website.<br><br>

						As an alternative, you can use <b>PNG</b> images -- Portable Network Graphics.  A PNG (pronounced "ping") is like a GIF, with the following advantages:

						<ul>
						<li>PNGs are smaller than equivalent GIFs.
						<li>GIF only supports palette-indexed color (meaning 256 colors maximum per image); PNG supports true color (24-bit, meaning 16 million colors per image) as well as indexed color, and a bunch of other formats, too.
						<li>The major browsers -- Mozilla, Netscape and IE -- support PNG properly.  Some older image editing programs won't recognize PNG (even though the format itself is several years old), but every modern graphics program will support PNGs.
						<li>PNGs support adaptive variable transparency, meaning that they can automatically be blended in with the background (by a web browser that properly supports it).  This is a good thing.
						<li>Most importantly, <b>PNGs are completely free</b> (as in speech AND beer).  The PNG standard is not covered by any patents, meaning you are free to use the PNG format for any purpose you desire without having to get anyone's permission or pay anyone any money.
						</ul>
						
						For more information, check out the official PNG homepage at <a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png" target="_top">http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png</a>.  For more info on why you shouldn't use GIFs, go <a href="http://burnallgifs.org" target="_top">here</a>.  There's also an explanation of the problem on the <a href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_top">Free Software Foundation</a> site; just click on the GNU head and then the link that says "No gifs due to patent problems" several lines down.<br><br>
						(Unfortunately, if you are viewing this in Netscape, transparency may not work with PNGs.  This is Netscape's fault.  Such are the slings and arrows we suffer to avoid stupid patent bullshit.)
