<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="ARIAL,VERDANA,HELVETICA">Classes</FONT><P>
The classes available vary with the race chosen. Not all classes are available to every race. Changing the class chosen changes the base attributes of the character. It is important that you look at race and class combinations prior to selecting a race or a class. If you have your heart set on being a bard, you are limited to what races you can choose from. The following section lists which classes are available for each race.
<P>
For more detailed information on classes, including starting equipment, skills, and spells, see Chapter 8 - Advanced Classes. Following is a brief description of each of the classes.
<P>
<B>Bard</B><BR>
The bard's relies on his ability to play songs. The songs are actually spells of a sort, and their magical affects last as long as the bard continues to sing and play the correct instrument. Bards have some of the same skills as a warrior and thief, but their main focus is always their art. So, they will always be considered the jack of all trades.
<P>
<B>Cleric</B><BR>
The Cleric is a holy man endowed by his patron deity with the power to heal, and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath of his deity to smite his foes. Prayer is how the cleric gains his ability.
<P>
<B>Druid</B><BR>
A druid is at home in the outdoors and is a friend to all animals. Because of this, no animal will ever attack him unless first attacked by the druid. Druids are spellcasters who focus on all things natural, letting them call upon nature for aid. They share some woodland skills with their ranger brothers.
<P>
<B>Enchanter</B><BR>
An enchanter's spells are crafted to enchant people, places, and things. This art lets him charm beings and make them fight for their new master or magically enhance the capabilities of a weapon. Bards also have some skill in offensive spells, but are not as skilled as wizards.
<P>
<B>Magician</B><BR>
Magicians wield the power to call forth everything from a loaf of bread to a huge fire elemental to fight for them. While not as adept at offensive spells as wizards, magicians still wield considerable power in this area as well.
<P>
<B>Monk</B><BR>
Monks are dedicated to the pursuit of shaping their bodies into a pure weapon, and because of this, they shun nearly all weapons and most forms of armor. They are very religious as well, and the gods are known to bless them, not by prayers and spells, but by magically enhancing their attacks.
<P>
<B>Necromancer</B><BR>
These are the dark brotherhood of the arcane arts, dabbling in death. Thoroughly evil spiritually, they can animate dead bodies and skeletons to do their bidding. In addition, they have spells that leach life from their victims.
