So you think the gnoll pups are an easy kill? Look out for big brother just over the hill. Here's Ca'arn's story.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="ARIAL,VERDANA,HELVETICA">
<B>ANECDOTE<BR>
My cleric had just attained level 3, and I was just leaving Qeynos after training at the guild hall. I had earned enough money to purchase a cloth cloak and rusty sword. Feeling full of myself, I decided to venture farther north out of Qeynos into Qeynos Hills.

As I entered the zone, I cautiously examined my surroundings, looking for signs of a monster that would have me for lunch. I was following the path north a ways when I spied a gnoll pup. Having slain the pups just outside Qeynos, I knew I could handle the situation. I approached the pup with sword drawn and ready to show the world my character's prowess. I battled the pup for a short time, and when it became apparent to the pup that he was going to die, he turned tail and fled up the hill.

I taunted the fleeing pup and gave pursuit with the intent of an easy victory. As I caught the pup at the crest of the hill, I froze in my place. For this scared gnoll pup was not simply fleeing my blade, but he was drawing me toward his big brother, a gnoll scout. As I stood there, both the scout and the pup turned back on me. The proud grin on my face quickly turned to a look of panic as I was quickly dispatched by the more powerful gnoll scout.

The moral of the story is, "Don't get too arrogant when in combat. If your prey flees from you, give chase with care. While you may think it is running, it may be retreating to gather reinforcements."</B></FONT>

<P>
As funny as this story sounds, nearly every player in EverQuest has experienced this scenario. Norrath is a large environment with complex racial tensions, so as a new player, give yourself some time to adjust. Aside from the intelligence of the monsters relying on more of their kind to help in a fight, there are more straightforward ways of dying. Before we delve into preventative measures, we'll explore the various ways you can die at the hands of guards or NPCs. What follows are some rules to increase your life expectancy. Read on, and don't say we didn't warn you!
