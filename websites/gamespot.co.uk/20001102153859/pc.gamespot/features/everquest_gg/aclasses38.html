<B>Creating a Character</B><BR>
Rogues can be of a several races, including human, halfling, half-elf, barbarian, dark elf, dwarf, gnome, or wood elf. Your race decision should be based on how you wish to role play your character, since a master thief can be developed from any of the available races. Agility and dexterity are important for any rogue, so when adding stat points, distribute most of them there. The remaining should be used to mold your character into the person you wish to role play. Will you be a brutish thug or a sweet-tongued con artist?
<P>
Human rogues begin in either Freeport or Qeynos. Half elves can start in Freeport, Qeynos, Felwithe, or Kelethin. All other races start only in their races' home city.
<P>
When you arrive in Norrath, all you will have is a dagger, some food, some water, a Tome of Discord, and an introductory letter to your guild master from your Uncle Lenny. The Tome of Discord, if read and brought to the Priest of Discord, shows you the way of chaos and lets you kill (and be killed by) other players. Even if you plan on following this path, bank the tome for now and get some experience first.
<P>
<B>Getting Started</B><BR>
Your first quest will be to find your guild, which is not as easy as it may sound. Rogues do, after all, practice their skills far from the eyes of city guards. Your uncle gave you the letter of introduction, but his directions to the guild were somewhat vague. Look for it in the seedier side of town and don't be surprised if the entrance is hidden behind a false wall or in a dark corner. Your guild master will greet you after you show him the letter and offer to train you in a variety of skills. These practice sessions are precious, however, and you should save them for a while.
<P>
Initially, practice sessions should only be used to acquire the fundamentals of a skill. After you know the basic skill, you can increase the it by using it rather than waste practice sessions at your guild. You will find that skills fall into two categories: those that advance easily when used (like combat skills) and those that are difficult or expensive to develop (like trades skills and several rogue skills). Make sure you have learned sneak and set it up as a hotkey. Sneak is your first rogue skill, and it will come in handy later, so hit the hotkey all the time, and you will get better at it. Piercing is the only viable rogue melee skill because you must have a piercing weapon for back stabbing, and that is your premier skill.
<P>
It's a good idea to find the bank about now. After all, you will soon be making some deposits and even perhaps a few withdrawals. It will, of course, be on the opposite side of town from your guild. Now that you see where your coins will be stored, you are acutely aware that you have none.

<P>So, unsheath your dagger and head for the gates. It's time to hone your combat skills and earn a few coppers in the process.
