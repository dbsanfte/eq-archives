<B>Adventure</B><P>
Participate and adventure with a player guild or in groups. Role-playing is the most fun when you have an audience. Get involved in quests, not just the old dungeon run for gold. Explore. Role-playing should build a story with many small chapters. The game is a quest, filled with smaller quests and adventures. Give your character some time to grow and join with others in the adventure - don't just chat about where the monsters are. Go get drunk one night, go get gold another, go vanquish evil, and then rest a while in the tavern. Make some clothes for the needy or out-wit the greedy. Build chapters in your character's life. When you do this, you are helping build the environment for everyone! Remember, you are not alone. The more you get into it, the more you drag others into it. The whole world of Norrath benefits.

<P>
<B>Guilds</B>
<P>
What would a game set in a fantasy setting be without guilds? Thankfully, you won't have to find out. There are two types of guilds in Norrath: professional guilds and player guilds.
<P>
Professional guilds are guilds built within the framework of EverQuest and are run by NPCs. You will be eligible for a professional guild based upon the class selection you made, and the purpose of a guild is to help you learn new skills and spells in the hope that you will bring honor to the name of the guild. All professional guilds have at least one guild hall, though each city may not have all professional guilds. Rest assured, the city in which you begin EverQuest will have a guild hall for your profession. See Chapter 4 - Off to See the Wizard for help getting started with your professional guild.
<P>
Player guilds are simply guilds of actual players, created and run by players. Being in a player guild is one of the most rewarding (or possibly worst) experiences you could have in a game like EverQuest. Player guilds are not for everyone, so do your homework. Player guilds will often help your rate of advancement because of the support, help, and teamwork they bring. There are a slew of player guilds out there, of which the Burning Heart is one. Some are role-playing guilds (such as the Burning Heart). Others are devoted more to the power gamer, and there are guilds based on races or professions. The possibilities are endless with player guilds. The official <a href="http://www.everquest.com">EverQuest web site</a> contains a list of all registered guilds and is a great place to begin your search for a guild.
<P>
In the following chapter, we delve into the all-important aspect of character creation. You have lots of choices ahead of you, and we recommend reading the entire chapter before choosing your path.
