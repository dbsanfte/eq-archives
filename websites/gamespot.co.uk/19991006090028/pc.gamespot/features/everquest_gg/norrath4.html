Time passed, and the volatile humans fought and bickered with each other. Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures as well as descriptions of ancient abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and the mystic arts. And when that discontent minority of leaders heard all of this, it became both jealous and determined.
<P>
A small, frail man of great intellect called Erud led this group, and he formed the malcontents into a council. The council members quickly became irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small network of spies behind, the remainder of Erud's followers fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west and landed on the barren coast of the island of Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited and quite appealing to the council and its people. They quickly built a city of their own, dissimilar in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost entirely a towering castle. It was called Erudin, and within it, the scribes and scholars, who called themselves high men, gathered and analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and examined other artifacts brought to them by their spies. Thus, the first human mages since the Combine Empire were born - wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and knowledge.
<P>
It came to pass some years later that a small group of Erudites discovered the lost art of necromancy. They were branded heretics, and great conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one very significant difference - they did not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives were lost by the hundreds, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin to hide and regroup in the southern regions of Odus. In one final battle, great mystic energies were released, and an immense hole leading to unknown depths beneath the earth was created. Into the sides of this chasm, the heretics built their own city, which they called Paineel. And while both sides still seethed with anger and hatred toward one another, their fear of what the last battle had wrought has kept any further conflict at bay.
<P>
It is in this age you find yourself, an age filled with wonder. The elder races have begun to reclaim their former glory. The younger races have matured, and an active economy stretches across Odus, Antonica, and Faydwer. And while conflict and battle is hardly rare, it has also been centuries since open war has plagued the lands. A myriad of alliances and factions exist, friend and foe plot and scheme, and the world of Norrath is ripe for action.
