<P>s you probably know, EverQuest is a multiplayer gaming environment played over the Internet. Most of the people you encounter in the game are real people sitting at their computers just like you. It also means that unlike many other games you've played, EverQuest has no set ending or linear plot. The world in which EverQuest is played is called Norrath. Norrath has an extensive history of racial tensions, warring factions, and numerous deities, which provide a backdrop to whatever role you may wish to play.
<P>
When you participate in EverQuest, you start by creating a character that you will play through the course of the game. You will role-play this character, and this character will be your on-line representation. As you play the game, your character will advance in level, which in turn lets you improve your various skills. Norrath is a persistent world; when you log out of the game, the world moves on. Other players remain, and events may occur while you are away.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="ARIAL,VERDANA,HELVETICA">   <LI><B> Game basics
   <LI> Character building and advancement tips
   <LI> Survival techniques
   <LI> Detailed creature descriptions
   <LI> Exacting spell, weapon, and armor tables
   <LI> Maps of the zones and cities of Norrath
   <LI> Valuable web site information</B></FONT>
</UL>

<P>
Norrath is a big world, and after a few moments in the game, you will begin to sense the reality that Norrath possesses. Each city, forest, and desert has its own design and feel. You will meet monsters who will attack you on sight. You'll explore dark forests and evil strongholds. You can train in mundane arts such as jewel craft, tailoring, or even brewing. You can live the life of a merchant, selling your wares to other travelers, or you can seek to be the greatest champion of the land. Norrath is full of opportunities, and the choice is yours as to where your name will be written in the histories of the land.
<P>
The world of Norrath comprises many zones. These zones are merely smaller, interlinked pieces of the full map. The zones are used to break the world into smaller pieces to reduce lag and improve game performance. You will see the term zone often in this guide and in-game. For example, the city of Qeynos is divided into two zones: North Qeynos and South Qeynos. When you walk to the northern limit of South Qeynos, your character will enter the zone of North Qeynos. Included in Appendix A - Finding Your Way are maps that indicate how each zone connects.
<P>
It is important to remember that in a game such as EverQuest, each player is the star of his or her own story. Where a single-player game has a lone protagonist, in EverQuest, thousands of heroes or heroines are present all at once. Some may choose to play alone, while others may find a player guild with which they will adventure. It doesn't matter how you play the game. Do not be afraid to experiment with your character - be it a holy paladin or an evil shadow knight. The world has ample room for any role you choose to play.
<P>
So cinch up your pack and cloak, arm yourself with the weapon of your choice, and prepare to enter a brave new world.

<P>
When you use this guide, please understand that we have done our best to provide a comprehensive look into EverQuest. The guide is meant to be an aide to players new to the world and a reference for even the most experienced adventurers. The guide focuses on role-playing and enjoying the game as its creators intended. It does not contain spoilers or cheats. Understand as well that EverQuest is constantly changing. While some information contained in this guide may quickly become outdated, we are confident that the bulk of the guide will remain helpful throughout your long-term journey through Norrath.
<P>
This guide is divided into two sections. The first focuses on characterization and acquainting you with the game. The second turns to survival and character advancement. In part one, Getting Started, you will learn how to build a character by familiarizing yourself with the races, classes, and statistics you have to choose from. You will also learn how to customize the game interface using hot keys and how to travel in the realm of Norrath.
<P>
In part two, The World of Norrath, you will learn about specific aspects of the realm, including survival techniques, advanced classes, monsters you're likely to encounter, weaponry, and spells. Maps of the zones, cities of Norrath, and valuable web site information are included in the appendices.
