<p>   This is the quest for the Paladin Sword Soulfire.  I have included the details
of the beginning part that anyone can do, but left out the names of the final
people you need to kill.  Be aware that you cannot complete this quest and get Soulfire unless you have a party of adventurers well into their 40's.  After
completing the messenger quest, you take the Zimel's Blades price list back to Kalatrina Plossen in the Hall of Truth.  She then transcribes a little of the
note, and determines that it seems to be some sort of price list.  She then sends you to speak with Rashinda (last name of
Elore) at the Freeport Office of the People, but tells you to report back to her what Rashinda tells you
has happened to Zimel's Blades.  Once at the Office of the People, Rashinda will spill her guts if she is asked, "Have you heard of Zimel's
Blades?".  She then goes in to detail about the owner being [Ariska Zimel], and that Zimel's
Blades was condemned after Zimel's disappearance.  Zimel's Blades was a weapons shop in East Freeport which was condemned by the city.  She
mentions that Groflah Steadirt bought most of the scraps that were left of Zimel's Blades.  Obviously the next question is
to ask Rashinda about Ariska Zimel (a simple "Who was Ariska Zimel?" suffices).  She then goes in to the
fact that Ariska Zimel was an extraordinary blacksmith who also was a great adventurer.  She says that he and Groflah Steadirt
were best friends and adventured together until each of them settled in Freeport.  She then
mentions Zimel's disappearance again, and says that you should go speak to
Groflah, because he could give you more information about Zimel then she can.  Somewhere in this mess of conversation, after she mentions
Zimel, and you ask her about him, she mentions Steadirt again.  This is the time to ask
her about Groflah Steadirt, and again, a simple "Who is Groflah Steadirt?&quot; will suffice. Okay, so now that you have all of this information, you're
supposed to return to Kalatrina Plossen at the Hall of Truth and tell her that
&quot;Zimel's Blades was condemed".  Where upon she wonders why Lucan would visit a
condemned building.  She figures he must be searching for something, and mentions that when she last visited the local
forge (must be Groflah's, but she doesn't say that) she heard rumors of Lucan searching for a sword
named Soulfire.  She then says if that is true, then you must find it first, as no more power must go Lucan's way.  She then say's "Seek this
sword out." Don't give her the price list, because she won't give it back and you need it
to continue.  The purpose of the price list is to get Groflah to open up to you, instead of telling you that he's never heard of Zimel's Blades and to go
away, because he's busy and can't speak there.  His response after receiving the price list is, and I quote:  " Where did you find
this?  This was the main price list of Zimel's Blades, but it should be all burnt up.  I was at Zimel's
right after the fire and I did not see it hanging where it should have been. The entire inside was gutted and.... Wait.... The sequence of the
dots!!! Hmmm.  I cannot talk with you here.  Meet me at the Seafarers by the docks
at night.  Give me the note when next we meet."  End quote.  To get Groflah to talk you have to be in a certain tavern in East Freeport around 5 or 6am.
He will appear and wag his tongue freely (presumably from the liquor).  He'll tell you about Tumpy Tonics (apparently all
dwarves are lushes) and will talk about Zimel, relating the story about what it was that Zimel found, why
he disappeared and who the culprit is.  You must then talk to the beggar Tykar Renlin, who shows up at the Seafarer's roost. You need
to give him 4 droms champagnes, one at a time, to get him to talk.   He will talk to you
and give you a blanket.  It turns out that Zimel is being held prisoner down below the arena (I think it may be cell block number 4).  When you talk to
Zimel, he says something that ends with "bog n goo".  When you give him edible goo (from cooking), he then says " bog
n goo.  Blanket too!"  What you need to do is give him edible goo, bog juice, and the blanket.  Bog juice can
be made by a brewer.  After giving him the bog juice and goo, you will receive a banker's key "H.K. 102" for High Keep. You need to
give this to the bank clerk in highhold and she will give you a note to deliver to Brother
Hayle in Splitpaw.  He will tell you the items you need to collect to get
soulfire:  The Hilt of Soulfire, the Brilliant Sword of Faith, <a href="test_of_truth.htm"> Your Testimony</a>
and the letter you received from the bank clerk.  The hilt and sword are obtained from killing high level NPC's (who shall
remain nameless here, but Hayle gives you the clues you need to track them down), and the testimony
is obtained through <a href="test_of_truth.htm">a side quest</a>.</p>
