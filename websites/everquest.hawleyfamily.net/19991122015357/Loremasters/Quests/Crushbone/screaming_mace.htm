<p>This entire quest takes place inside of Crushbone. First thing that you need to do is go see the dwarven smith. He is located in the small building
that is near the mine area. Inside this building is a jailor who you will have to kill.
Then you will see two dwarven smiths and an elven priest. Talk to the middle dwarven
smith (actually you can talk to either smith but I always spoke to the one in the middle, so for safety purposes speak to him). Tell him that you are here to set him free and he will begin rambling about how he wants his
freedom but the taskmaster scares them. Then ask him about the king or emporer and he will speak of the high quality ringmail
that is worn by this beast.</p>
<p>There are several parts of this quest but you really only need to concentrate on the final
two (bracer of battle and dwarven ringmail). Each piece that you find can either be kept or turned in for the item that it
returns depending on your class, race, and needs.</p>
<p>The first Orc that you might want to worry about is the Taskmaster. He hangs out to the right of the castle near the slaves. He
occasionally carries some magic +2 AC earrings. You can either wear these
earrings or you can return them to the dwarven smith. If you return them to him he will give you a blade mold
which can be used for blacksmithing.</p>
<p>The second Orc in this quest is the Instructor/Trainer. This is a large orc who can be found training other orcs on top of the large hill in the middle<br>
of the zone. He is known to carry a shiny brass shield. You can elect to keep this
shield (a wise choice or a poor choice depending on your class) or you can turn it in to the dwarven smith in exchange for a sludge mold.</p>
<p>The third item that you will need is the one that will be the most dangerous. You now need to kill the Emporer/King and hope that he is
wearing the dwarven ringmail tunic. You can turn this item in to the dwarven smith as with the items above. This time he will give you a dwarven mace. Not a bad weapon, however it's just a stepping
stone. The smith will also send you to go speaking to the elven priest standing in the next stall. The priest can enchant this mace for
you (and turn it into the screaming mace) but first you need to do something for
him. He wants you to kill the Warlord and bring proof of his death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fourth item that you need is the hardest one to get. You need to find the Warlord. He can be seen patrolling the area
around the castle from time to time. If you are lucky he will be carrying a bracer of battle. This is a fine piece of
armor for this level, however it can also be turned in. This time you will turn the bracer into the elven priest rather than the dwarven
smith. The priest will give you a prayer cloth in return for the bracer.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Many players get to this step and think, what? What did I do wrong. Well it is important to NOT give the priest the mace at the same time as the
bracer of battle. You need to give him the bracer alone first. Then after he hands
you the prayer cloth you can give him the mace. When he asks, "do you have something else for me?" then you can hand over the prayer cloth and voila you get one shiny screaming mace.</p>
