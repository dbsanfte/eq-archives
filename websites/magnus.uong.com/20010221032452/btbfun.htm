<p align="center">I think it was the summer of 1996 when I had
the extreme misfortune of buying Beyond the Beyond. BtB is one of
those games that is so bad, you play it for hours and just shake
your head silently at how bad it is. You hold on to a belief that
nothing could be so bad all the way through, it has to get better.
The game never got better and, after two weeks of playing, I
completed BtB and felt like less of a person for it. </p>

<p align="center">I don't really remember much about the story
since I've done my best to forget everything about the game
including the title, but I'm pretty sure it had something to do
with a kid who used a big sword and saved the world by collecting
8 magic things and beating some bad guy in a dark cape at the end.
Along the way, you met new people who would join your adventure.
Oooh like one of them was a really big dude who carried an axe.
Another was a babe in revealing armor and a loin cloth, who had
big boobs and knew lots of magic. Really original stuff. And if
that weren't enough, the game also featured &quot;full 360 degree
combat&quot; according to the back of the box. What this
translated to is really unconvincing two dimensional sprites and
a rotating landscape. It looks as cheesy as it sounds.</p>

<p align="center">For years now, I've thought that the only use
I'd ever find for the game ever again would be as a bookend for
my other Playstation games. I just hope it breaks their fall
should some set of circumstances cause them to jump off their
shelf. Such situations do occur when you have a cat, as I do,
that is more hyperactive than a room full of three year olds on
Koolaid and Barney videos. Enough about cats and Koolaid though,
I finally had a good time PLAYING BtB! (Cue the sinister BtB bad
guy music.)</p>

        you had asked me what you should do at this screen, I
        would have told you to turn the power off and snap the CD

        enjoy this game. It's so simple, I can't believe it took
        me more than four years to figure it out. What is the
        secret that breathes life back into one of the worst
        games ever made?<p>Name yourself &quot;mydick&quot;.</p>

<p align="center">The melding of a bad script and a clever,
albeit juvenile, name never produced such fantastic results as in
Beyond the Beyond. The simple name change transforms the game.
The story transforms from boring as an english teacher to
engaging, seductive, racy, and hilarious. The plot transforms to
one of child abuse, bisexual orgies, and cross dressing. So
drastic is the change, so much better does this make the game, I
am convinced the programmers intended the game to be this way all
along! I've thought of submitting the name change as a trick to
various gaming magazines. To garner support from the four people
that actually visit this site, I've included some screenshots of
the first few scenes of the new and vastly improved BtB.</p>
