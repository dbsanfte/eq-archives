<P>Hail friendly dewds,</P>     
<P>     If you've read part one, you know all about my old physics
professor. He's Japanese and has loads of trouble with the word 'earth'.
Whenever he says it, it sounds like he's saying 'ass'.</P>
<P>     The man is absolutely brilliant, but English is a mouthful for him.
(Pun intended.) I had a lot of trouble understanding him and I didn't
particularly care for his teaching style so I delayed taking my last
required physics class for two quarters in an attempt to avoid him. My
new professor is much better in my opinion. Anyway, she had to go out of
town this past week and guess who she got to fill in for her. That's
right! Mr. Peace on 'Ass' himself. </P>
<P>     I was bummed. However, I did get to hear some more funny stuff and
heard a new mispronounced word from him. To the non physics people out
there, a Joule is a unit of energy. Mr. 'Ass' pronounces it 'jew'.</P>
<P>      The class was on electrostatic potential and dog gone it,
gravitation was used as a comparison. (i.e. Lots more about the earth)
Here are the top ten things heard during my last physics class. (Note:
No offense is meant towards any particular group, ethnic or otherwise.)</P>

<P>10. The lines of force always go into the center of the 'ass'.</P>

<P>9. Does anyone know why we don't use 'jews' to measure electricity?</P>

<P>8. However, the moon does not fall into the 'ass'.</P>

<P>7. Because gravity is attractive only, forces never come out of the
'ass'.</P>

<P>6. Picture 'ass' on blanket, that is how gravity works.</P>

<P>5. What would happen to the blanket if we add another 'ass'?</P>

<P>4. When the 'ass' is gone, the blanket is flat.</P>

<P>3. How many 'jews' does it take to keep the moon circling 'ass'?</P>

<P>2. I will draw the 'ass' on the board. *draws ass on board*</P>

<P>1. My 'ass' isn't very round, is it?</P>

<P>     The last physics top ten was an instant classic. Think this one
will be too?</P>
