<P>Hail and high water,</P>

<P>     For some reason or another, Origin has started advertising for UO
again on webpages. The funny thing is, they seem to pop up on all the
EverQuest sights. Well, it's too much for me to figure out. Anyway, if
you've not seen them, they're animated gifs where the first frame shows
a photo a real person and gives their job description. Then, the next
frame shows their paper doll and tells what EXCITING adventures they
have in UO. There are about 3 or 4 different varieties. I happen to have
the top ten ads that didn't make it.</P>
