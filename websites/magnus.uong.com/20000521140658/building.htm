had just been gated off of Ocllo to Trinsic with instructions to
seek out the 'Statics' web site. He had just minimized his
playing window, and......</font></p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;uhm static.cling.org? uuhhhh&quot;, you mumble. The
realization hits you slowly that you don't remember the URL that
Magnus gave you. Perhaps you should have planted it a little more
firmly than you did. It kind of reminds you of taking a test at
school. Maybe you can find Magnus and get him to tell it to you
again.</p>

<p>As you return to the world of Britannia, with another ALT TAB,
you notice that you are standing next to the Trinsic bank. A
single naked wizard named Macro Polo stands beside you. He casts
the flamestrike spell, aims it at himself, and then chants,
&quot;Ommmmmm&quot;. Beside the mage is a man in a white robe
with white hair trimmed short. His name is Gangstah Bob and he
has opened the wizard's bag and is helping himself to the wizard's
supply of reagents. </p>

<p>&quot;vendor buy bank guards for my loot!11&quot;, you macro.
The guard, WhackaJack teleports in and kills Gangstah Bob in one
swipe. To your great surprise, the ghost of Bob immediately
rematerializes into a new living body. Bob isn't very happy.
&quot;WTF DID U DO TAHT 4?/&quot;, he demands. A bit shocked, you
manage to answer, &quot;bcuz im teh avatart...im sposed 2 do good
deeds&quot; The anger quickly leaves Bob's face as he replies,
&quot;really? so ur going 2 kill the 8 pks of virtue??&quot; You
say, &quot;yeh but i dont kno nething about fighting...magnus was
sposed 2 trane me but he kiked me off his island&quot;</p>

<p>Bob looks unhappy again and says, &quot;yeh tahe mangus guy is
a reel drok...ill trane u if u wnat&quot; You reply, &quot;kewl
thx&quot; Bob smiles and informs you that there is one matter
that needs to be taken care of. &quot;thsi is jsut my thieve
character...my house is jsust outsied of twon..u wnat 2 meet me
ther and ill log thsi guy out?// my other char is named
Sperminator&quot; </p>

<p>You nod and walk to the outskirts of town. Here, in amongst 45
houses, All-Names finally shows the name Sperminator (keeper of
the hoes, PMP) (order) inside a two-story house. The sign on the
house reads, &quot;WU TANG 4EVAH&quot;. Sperminator sees you and
opens the door. As you enter, you remark, &quot;niec sign...wahts
a wu tang?&quot; Sperminator answers, &quot;i dnot kno..i just
heard soem guys sayign it at school and thougt it was kewl...i
thik its a orange drink..neway lets get u traned&quot;</p>

<p>Sperminator hands you a set of plate armor and a kryss with a
maker's marks that say, &quot;crafted by DARTH MAUL&quot;. He
also hands you a heavy crossbow that was &quot;crafted by Sir
Chopsalot&quot;. You thank him and he starts giving you
instructions. &quot;k...teh first thing u need 2 do is get
uoxtreem and ez marcos...tehn il teach u how 2 macro and use
fastwlak when ur ready...u can go after teh pks...k?&quot; You
nod.</p>

<p>The next three days are a blur for you. You spar all day with
Sperminator's pet polar bear 'a'. At night. you practice Arms
Lore, while you tame a rabbit over and over and try to snoop
Sperminator's pack. In no time at all, you are stronger than the
smell of rotting garbage and faster than a speeding Origin
programmer, yet your intelligence remains nice and low. </p>

<p>Sperminator is pleased and begins to teach you the basics of
recalling and healing. He finally says, &quot;WetCondom i haev
taught u all u needd...now go 4th a whippeth soem ass&quot; You
laugh, &quot;LOL&quot; He echoes, &quot;hehehe&quot; and says,
&quot;heer i want u 2 have this&quot; He reaches into a bookshelf
and pulls out a box. He reaches in the box and pulls out an
armoire. He reaches in the armoire and pulls out a small pouch.
He tosses the pouch to you. In the pouch is a full set of bone
armor, a bright green cloak, thigh boots, an exceptional heavy
crossbow and enough bolts to supply a small PK guild. </p>

<p>Again you thank Sperminator who tells you, &quot;i jsut wnat 2
kno taht they are going 2 be used againts those basterd pks&quot;
You ask, &quot;k..but how do i kno wher teh 8 pks are?&quot;
&quot;i think birtish knos...ask him&quot;, he says. You answer,
&quot;k thx 4 everything.&quot; Sperminator says, &quot;np&quot;
and with that, you locate your Britain rune and read the scroll
to recall.</p>

<hr>

<p>Join me next time when WetCondom starts administering unholy
ass whippings on the 8 pks of virtue.</p>
