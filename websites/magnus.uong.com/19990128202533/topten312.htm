<P>My my my,(Semi-roleplayin' time)</P>

<P>What is this newsgroup coming to? Magnus here, wishing he had a kill
file feature to get rid of the lawsuit posts. I also see today where a
PKer wrote a Top Ten List. We can't have that. =) I figured I better
jump in with my own. This one is about PKers oddly enough. (Dread Lady
Compassion and Dread Lord Remy Martin, I highly respect the two of you
and in no way mean this as attack on you. This also applies to any Pkers
out there who make honest efforts to make their choice of game playing
at least a little bit of fun for the rest of us.) I'm targeting KeWl
dEwDs today. This list will be kinda like Interview with the PKers.</P>

<P>10. Motivations</P>
<P>Magnus: I'm here today interviewing a group of PKers in Ultima On-Line.
We are here today to find out their thoughts on some issues. Say "Hi" to
the newsgroup guys.</P>
<P>ord LongDong: Heya</P>
<P>Lord IWannaBangYa: sup ddudes</P>
<P>Lady ChEaPsLuT: hiya guys</P>
<P>Magnus: I guess the question everyone wants to know the answer to is,
What drives you to kill other players?</P>
<P>Lord LongDong: Wel tha;s easy man Excitement</P>
<P>Magnus: You like the thrill of fighting intelligent opponents?</P>
<P>Lady ChEaPsLuT: Yeh that's it</P>
<P>Magnus: You three have often been seen ganging up on one player to kill
them, is that what you call exciting?</P>
<P>Lord IWannaBangYa: well yeah dude - like if we fouht one of one it would
be like dangerus or something</P>
<P>Lord LongDong: yeh we ain;t stupid we don't wanna die man</P>

<P>9. Reasons</P>
</P>Magnus: OK, we've identified that you as players like the 'excitement'
of killing other players, what about your characters? Why would they be
out killing people?</P>
<P>Lady ChEaPsLuT: Well it;s like this see</P>
<P>Lady ChEaPsLuT: Lord Btirtish is a tireant   we are like rebels  see?</P>
<P>Magnus: Not really. What is it you don't like about Lord British?</P>
<P>Lord LongDong: He's a lamer   just like the people we kill   se they
work for 5 hours to make some gold and then we can take it away in 5
seconds</P>
<P>Magnus: So if Lord British killed his subjects and took their stuff
stuff, that would make him a better leader in your eyes? </P>
<P>Lord IWannaBangYa: yeh  thats why we fight</P>

<P>8.  Future plans</P>
<P>Magnus: Have you got any plans for the future?</P>
<P>Lady ChEaPsLuT: yeh   my mom says dinners almost redy and then i gotta
take abath</P>

characters?</P>
<P>Lord LongDong: Yeah   we all have great lords  and yeah dude like becuz
we are really smart</P>
<P>Magnus: I see. But wouldn't you consider your other characters lamers
because they work for what they get?</P>
<P>Lord IWannaBangYa: no they aren't lamers   like a great lord is supposed
to be good right and do good things right?</P>
<P>Magnus: That's what I've been led to believe.</P>
<P>Lord IWannaBangYa: well they are good  see they hide in our castle until
our dread lords come home and go to slee[p </P>
</P>Lord IWannaBangYa: its like this, the dread lords leave all the stuff</P>
<P>they steel from peple in treasur chests and then go to sleep</P>
<P>Lord IWannaBangYa: then the great lords come out of hiding and steal all
the stuff from the dread lords and use it for their advetures</P>
<P>Magnus: And you boys play both the Dread Lords and the Great Lords?</P>
<P>Lord LongDong: Yeh  hehe its way kewl    you get good stuff for nothing</P>

opponents on the battleground?</P>

be a part or your idiotic ramblings and delusions of granduer or your
mindless displays of bloodshed that you thinly disguise with a creed
that sounds suspiciously as if you invented it on the spot for this interview.   </P>
