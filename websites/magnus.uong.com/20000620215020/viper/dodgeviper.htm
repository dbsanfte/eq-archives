<p align="center">I want a Viper. No, that's not right, I need a
Viper. It's beyond a simple wish. I have to have one. I have
Viper plastic and metal model kit cars. I have Viper Hot Wheels.
I will buy a 20 pack of Matchbox cars if it has one Viper in it.
When I start a new game of Gran Turismo, the first car I go for
is the Viper. Steppenwolf's song, 'Magic Carpet Ride' is now the
Dodge Viper theme song. When I hear it on the radio, it takes me
away to the magical happy place where I too own a Viper.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="GTviper.jpg" width="336" height="169"></p>

<p align="center">The fact that the car I drive now is a Dodge
Shadow doesn't help things very much. I've tried pretending that
my little red 4 cylinder turbo is a 450hp, V-10, blue and
white striped monster. The fantasy usually ends when I lose a
drag race to a kid on a moped delivering newspapers. I was pretty insulted because he kept on throwing papers to his customers while we raced.  So, later, I
took masking tape, wrote the word 'Viper' on it and placed it
over the 'Shadow' name plate on the back to intimidate those
nasty moped drivers. No one but my 4 year old cousin was fooled.
Of course, he eats things he finds between the sofa cushions and
the only thing he's ever driven is his Power Wheels Bigfoot. I am
proud to report that my car smoked his Bigfoot's ass. He might have won, though if
he hadn't been trying to run over his neighbor's cat. He also laughed
at me when I tried to collect on the bet we'd made. He told me
that he didn't have $80,000 and that I was a &quot;stupid fart
head&quot;. I don't care who you are, there's no arguing with logic like that, so later, we made a double or nothing bet on a game of
Pokemon Snap and he kicked my ass and broke even.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="viper13.jpg" width="480" height="179"></p>

<p align="center">So anyway, I've come to the conclusion that a
Dodge Shadow is no substitue for a Dodge Viper. </p>

<p align="center">Right now, Vipers are just slightly out of my
price range along with every other car that's not at least 10
years old. Part-time jobs that you put up with while you're in
college just were never meant to give people the means to buy $75,000
sports cars. Also, once I make it through the hell that is an
engineering degree, I'm thinking that the first $75,000 I earn
should probably go towards something I can live in. And don't
think that I've not tried to figure out a way to put my bed into
the trunk of a Viper. </p>
