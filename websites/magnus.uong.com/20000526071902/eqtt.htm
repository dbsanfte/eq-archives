<p align="center">It seems that this picture of my EverQuest
character inspired one of the viewers of my page to draw a
picture of my character and send it to me. I have to say, this
guy is a fantastic artist and is very good at what he does. I am
honored to have had my picture drawn by him. To look at this work
of art, click <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/rayvie1.jpg">here.</a>
