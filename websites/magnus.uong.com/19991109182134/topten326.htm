<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Top Ten List 3/26</H1>
<P>Hola mis amigos, (semi-roleplayin' time)</P>
<P>Time for yet another attempt at humor by that black plate wearin'
Magnus. This week's list is the top ten experiences, in UO, I've had
with dummies. (A.K.A. idiots, morons, jerks, ....)</P>

<P>10. In the dungeon - Part A</P>
<P>Magnus is walking through the first level of Covetous.</P>
<P>You see: The Dishonorable New Guy</P>
<P>You see: The Great Lord Slaya</P>
<P>You see: The Great Lord KiLLa</P>
<P>   .</P>
<P>   .</P>
<P>   .</P>
<P>You see: Slaya attacking New Guy</P>
<P>You see: KiLLA attacking New Guy</P>
<P>Magnus: In Vas Mani</P>
<P>Magnus: New Guy, run these people are noto killers.</P>
<P>New Guy: I know. It's cuz I'm dishonorable.</P>
<P>Magnus: Exactly, RUN!</P>
<P>New Guy: Slaya and KiLLA, I'm not really dishonorable, I just accidently
clicked on my friend while fighting today.</P>
<P>You see: Slaya attacking New Guy</P>
<P>You see: KiLLA attacking New Guy</P>
<P>Magnus: In Vas Mani</P>
<P>Magnus: RUN NEW GUY!!!</P>
<P>New Guy: I told you guys that I am not really dishonorable, it was a
mistake.</P>
<P>Magnus: They don't care! RUN!</P>
<P>You see: Slaya attacking New Guy</P>
<P>You see: KiLLA attacking New Guy</P>
<P>New Guy: But I want them to believe me...</P>
<P>You see: This is pointless</P>
<P>*Magnus leaves New Guy to his fate*</P>

<P>New Guy was a newbie, but that only excuses so much. After the
second heal, he should have caught on. </P>
<P>Note to newbies: Trying to reason with a Noto PKer is like discussing
politics with your grandparents. They don't care what you have to say
about the subject, and are not likely to change their opinions if they
did. You are better off arguing with the television.
Note to noto killers: I know this will probably fall on deaf ears but I
have an experience to share. When I first met my oft mentioned friend
Exodus, he was a Dark Lord. He told me that he had killed two good NPCs.
I believed him and helped him however I could and once helped him carry
1000 GP to the bank. In return, I could not have asked for a better
playing companion. </P>

<P>9. In the dungeons - Part B</P>
<P>*Magnus is again in Covetous*</P>
<P>You see: Average Jerk</P>
<P>You see a slime attacking Average Jerk</P>
<P>Average Jerk: THIS ONE IS MINE!!!! EVERYBODY CLEAR OUT! I NEED
EXPERIENCE!</P>
<P>Magnus: Whatever you say.</P>
<P>You see: a slimy corpse</P>
<P>(soon after)</P>
<P>You see: Average Jerk</P>
<P>You see: a gazer</P>
<P>You see: a gazer attacking Average Jerk</P>
<P>Average Jerk: HEAL ME!! HEAL ME!!   SOMEBODY RA ME!!!!! NOW!!!!!</P>
<P>Magnus: Nah, you said you needed the experience. I wouldn't want to take
away from your *experience* of the game. Besides, your death will be an
experience I'd like to see.</P>

<P>Is it just me, or are these guys right up there on the annoyance scale
with KeWL DOODS and Noto PKers?</P>

<P>8. ICQ</P>
<P>You have a new fwd message from Paranoid.</P>
<P>Paranoid: As you know, ICQ is overcrowded. Anyone who does not forward
this message, will have their account terminated, their house burned
down, their family killed, their bank accounts zeroed out, Elvis' face
will be tatooed on their buttocks, their head will be shaved, and they
will be forced to make workout videos with that Richard Simmons. I
looked on the web page and this time it's not a hoax. </P>

<P>I hope I'm not the only one who ignores these. =-)  Anyone up for
Sweatin' to the Oldies:Part 14?</P>

<P>7. Interfering with my Semi-roleplayin'</P>
<P>Exodus and Magnus are doing a little crowd entertainment</P>
<P>Magnus puts on his best dress and a pair of boots</P>
<P>Exodus has on a pair of knee pants with no shirt and no shoes</P>
<P>You see: Exodus</P>
<P>You see: Ol' Yeller</P>
<P>You see: a crowd of folks</P>
<P>You see: Clueless</P>
<P>Exodus: Maw!  What's wrong with Yeller?</P>
<P>Magnus: I'm sorry son, he's sick. We'll have to shoot him.</P>
<P>Magnus: Corp Por</P>
<P>Exodus: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!</P>
<P>You are attacking Ol' Yeller!</P>
<P>You see: a dog corpse</P>
<P>*the crowd goes wild*</P>
<P>Clueless: Why the *&%$ did you E-bolt the dog? You coulda killed him
with halberd and saved regs. And what's everybody laughin' at? He just
killed a dog. WTF is so funny about that?</P>

<P>6. A few questions from me</P>
<P>No dialogue for this one. Who are these people that build their house
right in front of a cave, blocking the entrance except for a tiny space
on either side? Who were all those people that thought fire was cool
back when they didn't burn out? (I went into Lord British's throne room
one evening and every tile in there had a fire burning on it.) What
about the tower roofs? (I've seen a tower that had every tile on the top
covered with a useless scrap of cloth.) Are there any motivations behind
things like this? If anyone knows, e-mail me and please let me in on the
secret.</P>

<P>5. In the dungeons - Part C</P>
<P>Has anyone else ever bumped into one of those guys in the dungeon, who
keeps accusing everyone of looting whenever he kills a slime or mongbat? </P>

<P>4. Internet lingo</P>
<P>I don't really mind most of it. It's often times alot easier that typing
a complete sentence or full words. The cases that bother me are the
extreme cases, the times when you often must stop and ask the person WTF
they just said. =^)  Here's how it can be playing with them.</P>
<P>(Translation in parentheses)</p>
<P>NetSurfer: LOL, K ICQ going OTD brb (Ha ha ha, OK I've got an ICQ
message, I'm going out to my desktop. I'll be right back.)
NetSurfer:Back, ready - o wait a sec GGP (Alright, I'm back and I'm
ready. Can you wait just a second? Nature calls.)</p>

<P>3. Character Names</P>
<P>Where would my top ten list be without some of those goofy names in it?</P>
<P>Examples:</P>
<P>Jack Schitt</P>
<P>FarTKnockA</P>
<P>ComeOnIWannaLayYa</P>
<P>I saw this guild title last week - Head Cheap Slut (Must be a coveted
postion)</P>
<P>WarSlut</P>
<P>LongDong</P>
<P>SukMiDik</P>
<P>YerMom</P>
<P>Fu Q </P>

<P>2. Vendors</P>
<P>Is it just Catskills or do the player vendors (the ones that actually
sell items) have really, really overpriced stuff? How many mandrake does
this guy sell at 15 GP a piece? Why does he think someone would want to
pay 2000 GP for a viking sword of ruin? I saw a plate helmet of
hardening on a vendor for 6000 GP. Sheesh. This one leads into the next
one.</P>

<P>1. Why, oh why do we have to put up with that guy at the bank who Spams
advertisement for *one* magic item, or a set of bone gloves, scribing
circles 1-2, gating to Nu'Jelm, asking for a rune to the Chaos shrine,
Richard Simmons tapes for sale, free oil changes at Express Lube....    
Please: Stop this now, don't SPAM unless you have something
that people might really want. And if you do it often, please consider a
vendor, you might get 500 GP for that Create Food Scroll you've been
saving.  ;)</P>


<P>Another week, another list. Thanks again for taking the time to read.
Hope ya enjoyed it. </P>

<P>OK OK   here's one more I just thought up. I'll number it 0.</P>

<P>0. Typing corrections</P>
<P>If you type a word and get a couple of letters mixed up, most of us are
smart enough to figure out what you mean. </P>
<P>Perfectionist: Jsut kiddnig. See ouy laetr.</P>
<P>Perfectionist: Just kididng. See you latre</P>
<P>Perfectionist: Just kigding. Ese uyo alter</P>
<P>Perfectionist: Ujst Kidding. See you later.</P>
<P>Perfectionist: Jsut</P>
<P>Perfectionist: Just!  </P>

<P>Ok tha's all for now.  =^)</P>
<P>htat's </P>
<P>that's!!!   hehe</P>

newsgroup, or at least Court Jester.</P>
