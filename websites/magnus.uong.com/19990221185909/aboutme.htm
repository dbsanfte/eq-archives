<P> My real name is Cory Nabors. I am a Junior at the University 
of Alabama at Birmingham majoring in Electrical Engineering. When I'm not at school, you can find me
working in a small department store in the town I live in. I also like playing Ultima and writing posts 
for R.G.C.U.O. but you knew that. </P>
<P>My other hobbies include console video games and I've been working on 
restoring a 1982 Chevrolet Camaro. (Sure it's not antique but with the condition this car was in when I 
bought it, you'd have thought it was.) Here's what it looks like after about a year and a half of work.</P>

<P>I've also written a web page or two. Anyone remember the X-Men Sounds 
Page? Want to know anything else? If so, you're too nosy! =^) Nah, I'll
answer any questions ya got.</P>
