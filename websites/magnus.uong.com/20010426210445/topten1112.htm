<p>Newsgroupies of the world,</P>

<P>     Imagine my horror when I it was pointed out to me by a friend that
my top ten lists are not year 1999 compatible. When I started these
lists early this year, I had no idea that I would still be doing them by
the end of the year. Because of this, I didn't include a year on the
date.</P>
<P>     I have a crack team of Ultima programmers working to correct this
but I fear it may be too late. They are pretty good but they keep
insisting that I move the flour bags trapping them in my house during
the day. One even threatened to call a GM. Should this problem not be
resolved by Jan. 01, 1999, prepare yourselves for the worst. Planes will
fall out of the sky! Ships will sink in mid-ocean!  Nuclear weapons will
launch themselves! Crispex will get soggy in milk! Somebody will
discover how many licks it *really* takes to get to the Tootsie Roll
Pop! Sprite will the discover the contradictory nature of their commericials! Bill
Clinton will say 'oral sex' on TV! APOCALYPSE IS HERE! (Along with Azz
Kicka, dEaThDeaLeR, and let's not forget 'of Death'.)</P>
<P>     What was I doing? Oh yes! A top ten list. Here it is. I apologize
because it's another letter from Origin form, but they're sooooo easy
for me to do.</P>
<P>__________________________________________________________________________</P>

<P>Hail homeowners!,</P>

<P>     We recently posted proposed changes to the housing system and asked
for input from players. The data we recieved proved to be invaluable in
winning a bet against Richard Garriot about the true state of Ultima
Online. We appreciate your valuable insight. (and that 5 year
subscription to Playboy payed for by LB himself is not too bad either.)
Anyway, here are the real housing changes that we will be implementing
soon. Our current time table is being used for a dart board in DD's
office but we assure you, we are working as quickly as possible to get
it back from him.</P>

<P>10. After months of tedious research, we have discovered that the all
the houses are coming from players. We will start by removing all the
players from the shards and see if this alleviates the problem.  Update:
Catskills was the first shard to undergo this player expelling process.
You may have logged in during this testing phase and noticed all your
characters deleted. This however was only temporary, because, to our
dismay, after four hours with no players, the houses remained. More
testing is being planned.</P>

<P>9. We've received literally thousands of complaints about the removal of
tents. Apparently, this issue needs some clearing up. Through intensive
guessing, we found that 6 to 10 chests could be put into the place of a
single tent. We are still planning to remove the tents, but we will not
remove the chests inside. Chest deeds can be bought anyplace tent deeds
are sold for about 25 gold. There is no limit on how many chests one
person can own. We expect the chests to very popular with players.</P>

<P>8. On a related note, we were also motivated to remove the tents because
it's been suggested by Magnus that the large number of tents were the
source of the camping skill problems we've been experiencing. He also
suggested we do this top ten list.</P>

<P>7. Specific changes for houses:</P>
<P>  - Houses will be getting smaller - the floor will be a 2 X 2 area</P>
<P>  - Items will no longer be allowed in houses, all items will drop by
the door step.</P>
<P>  - Houses will require maintenence (This can be paid for in gold, raw
materials, or links and passwords for hot adult web sites.)</P>
<P>  - We are implementing a limit of one house per shard. The lucky
houseowner on each shard will be determined by a game of You Don't Know Jack.</P>

<P>6. Trapped monsters and NPCs will soon cook, clean, and mow the grass.</P>

<P>5. While carrying a house deed, a flag will appear over your head
advertising the fact. One can also expect to flash bright green, emit
sounds like a harpy, and become drunk.</P>

<P>4. The decay rate of houses has been increased to assure that unused
houses will be gone as quickly as possible. The new time is now 6
seconds. If the front door of a house is not used within this time, the
house will explode killing everyone on every shard.</P>

<P>3. Houses will soon be bankable. (Only if the holds are empty.)</P>

<P>2. House defense methods:</P>
<P> - In the event of a house break in, the homeowner will simply hit a
button on his paperdoll and everyone on the shard will instantly die</P>
<P> - Should the owner not be logged in when the break in occurs, the house
will polymorph itself into a giant Gene Simmons head (your choice
of with or without makeup) and spit the burglars out on its giant
tongue, all while singing, "I wanna rock and roll all night!
Yeeeeeaaaaaaaah!!!!"</P>
<P>- No Trespassing signs will become available in the provisioners' shops.</P>

<P>1. To curb some possible imbalances, we are introducing several new
criminal offenses.</P>
<P>  -  Placing a house will flag you as a criminal.</P>
<P>  -  Saying the word 'house' will flag you as a criminal.</P>
<P>  -  Being on the same screen as a house will flag you a criminal.</P>
<P>  -  Disagreeing with these housing changes will flag you as a criminal.</P>


<P>     Hopefully, these changes will restore Britannia to it's former
houseless glory. If not, we'll just ban anyone caught buying a house.</P>
<P>     Please, feel free to send us any thoughts or comments you might have on
this issue. We don't read it, but there's a guy that works in testing
who really loves to get e-mail and we forward it all to him. You should
see his face light up when he hears those magic words: You've got mail!</P>

<P>Regards,</P>

<P>      I want to warn you now that the top ten lists may be a little
scarce over the next few weeks. Final exams are coming up and depending
on time, I might have to study instead of posting to RGCUO. You don't
have to say it, I know. One of these days I'll get my priorities
straight and post first, then study, but who knows when that will be?</P>
