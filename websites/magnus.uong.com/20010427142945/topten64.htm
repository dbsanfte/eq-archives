<H1 align="center">Top Ten 6\4</H1>
<P>Friends, Brittannians, Newsgroupers,</P>

<P>Lend me your eyes. I came. I saw. I made them laugh. (Practicing being a
monarch) Time once again for the new top ten list.  As you know by now,
it has been decided that I shall take the throne of the Catskills Shard.
Do I get an invulnerability tag too? Probably not, but it didn't do Lord
British a whole lot of good did it? But I digress! My first order of
business as king shall be an overhaul of the current virtue system. Here
they are, the ten new virtues and what actions are expected for aspiring
Avatars. (I want these to be easy so any average UO gamer can reach
Avatarhood. Can never have too many Avatars ya know!)</P>

<P>10. Honor - Being worthy of respect or fame</P>
<P>The Avatar must obtain honor to gain the respect of all Britannia.This
will be accomplished by killing rats or dastardly newbies and getting a
really kewl shield.  - New symbol - A wooden shield being crushed by an
order and chaos shield</P>

<P>9. Honesty - Being truthful in word and deed</P>
<P>An Avatar never lies, unless he knows that no one in the game will find
out about it. Things that may always be lied about  in Ultima On-Line:</P>

<P>The amount of money in your bank account</P>

<P>Your magery skill</P>

<P>The skills of your other characters</P>

<P>The amount of lag you are or are not experiencing</P>

<P>The Halberd of Vanquishing and 1000 of each reagent that you lost during
the last break in bug (notice that everyone always has at least 30-50K
in reagents in their home?)</P>

<P>(Others will be added) - New Symbol - a halberd radiating sparks</P>

<P>8. Humility - Humbleness</P>
<P>Each Avatar must spend at least 6 hours of play time standing around the
bank or Britain in a death robe, telling passersby that they were PKed
and begging for reagents/gates/runes/gold/armor/weapons/black dye/etc.
(This list is writing itself!) - New Symbol - A dead, naked body with an
orc helm on</P>

<P>7. Valor - Bravery in the face of danger</P>
<P>An Avatar must be brave. To advance in this virtue, players must wait at
least 5 seconds upon sight of a murderer to hit their recall macro.
(This minimum may be lowered depending of how things work out. As a
matter of fact, we may just dump this virtue altogether.) - New symbol -
An F1 key</P>

<P>6. Spirituality - The quality of being spiritual (WTF??) </P>
<P>OK, since I have no clue how being spiritual is supposed to help you
advance in the game, (unless they mean getting yourself killed so you
can use a break in bug) I'm going to change the meaning of this one.
Spirituality will now mean being good with Spirit Speak. Avatars must
macro spirit speak for at least two consecutive nights. - New Symbol -
An F10 key with tape over the top</P>

<P>5. Justice - Conformity to truth, fact, or reason</P>
<P>And all this time I thought Justice was that really nice NGI member who
sometimes writes top ten lists. This is another virtue that may have to be dropped
because too many UO players don't even know the meaning of the words
truth, fact, or reason. Case in point, that guy that thinks because he
happened to be on the same screen as you when you slayed an ettin, he
deserves some of the loot. Or, the people that think posting bugs will
make them get fixed faster. Or, the PKers that think because they
roleplay, they shouldn't be killed. (Want me to keep going?) Or, those
people that tame 30 - 40 animals and leave them right on the edge of the
guard zone. (I can stop anytime.) Or, that person who types in all caps
"MOVE!!!" anytime someone gets lagged in a doorway. (Really, anytime
now.) Or, all those people who thought the Hekawi tribe was serious.
(Please stop me.) Or.....OK that's enough. - New symbol - A big question
mark</P>
  
<P>4. Compassion - Sympathy to other's distress (also a certain dread lady)</P>
<P>This virtue can be achieved very simply. Bards, practice your music away
from banks. Alchemists, practice your skill away from the bank.
Escorters, buy your reagents before you have twenty followers. Thieves,
leave the bank and go hang yourselves. - New symbol - A lute busted over a bard's head</P>

<P>3. Sacrifice - Putting another's needs and wants above your own</P>
<P>To advance here, you must do just that. When you go to a mage shop and
see 334 mandrake root for sale, leave 3 or 4 for the next person. Don't
take 50 - 60 escortees at one time, limit yourself to 30. Trap monsters
in your house so they don't do damage and hurt other players. When you
loot a fallen players' body, leave the kindling and sleeping roll so
they can log out. Take that heavy crossbow of force and use it for a
month or two before putting it on your vendor. You have to make sure it
is quality merchandise. Make the sacrifice! - New Symbol - one shining
black pearl priced at 15 GP</P>

<P>2. A new virtue - Humor</P>
<P>Avatars must be required to write a top ten list pertaining to anything
Ultima-related. The king must audibly laugh at no fewer than 4 items. -
New Symbol - My very own black plate helmet</P>

<P>1. The tenth and final virtue - KeWlNesS</P>
<P>An Avatar should be KeWl. He/she should have a name with AlTeRnAtInG
CaPs. He/she should always be on the lookout for new bugs. He/she needs
to have a full set of 'true black' clothing. He/she must abbreviate
every possible thing they type and use lots and lots of internet lingo.
New Symbol - The words 'A true black cloak'</P>

<P>Now, look inside your soul and ask yourself, "Do I have what it takes to
become the 5,820,275th one to master the ten vurtues?" The answer may
surprise you.</P>
<P>Alright, give it to me straight. How does my new virtue system look?
Will I make a good king? Aspiring minds want to know! ;)</P>

<P>-Lord Magnus (Ocllo,Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Master Tank Mage who says, "It's good to be the king!"</P>
