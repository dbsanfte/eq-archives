<p>Hail fellow UO players,</P>

<p>Are you tired of those in game events? You know how it is:
Trinsic/Britain is under attack and you hoof it over there only to find
that they've pumped up the spawn in that area and there are 50 people
standing around waiting for the next troll/ogre/evil mage/orc to appear. 
How about a player event that is sure to please all? </P>

<P><CENTER>COMING SOON!</CENTER></P>
<P><CENTER>The Ultima Carnival</CENTER></P>

<P>Yes! That's right! You can come and meet and talk with your favorite
newsgroup personalities. There's lots to do!</P>

<P>The Dread Lady Compassion will be running a kissing/killing booth. 500
for a smooch, 1000 for a knife in your gut.</P>

<P>The Dread Lord Remy Martin's prized heater will be on display.</P>

<P>Dennis Heffernan/Venture will be in our dunking booth. 1000 a throw.</P>

<P>Jag and Bunboy will be there for anyone who hasn't gotten enough of the
lawsuit already.</P>

<P>Cyclone's story hour will be a sure favorite. Get your seats early.</P>

<P>Cyclone has also told me that he plans to give out free "Legs Lore"
seminars.</P>

<P>Magnus will perform a stand up comedy routine/magic show. Features REAL magic.</P>

<P>Lemur Dragon will be giving a lecture on his favorite animal.</P>

<P>I don't get E-mail so don't send it will be there telling everyone that
he doesn't get E-mail so don't send it.</P>

<P>We'll have a special Tomb set up for unregistered voters.</P>

<P>we also have word that a special secret guest will be there but i don;t
know who it is maybe someone knows if they find out don't tell because
it wouldn't be a secret then and that wouldn't be any fun now would it
(I really have too much fun this poster, don't I?)</P>

<P>Rumor has it that BON3DOOD and pLaTeDeWd will make an appearance.</P> 

<P>There will be many games and contests, musical chairs, the 500 stacks of
hide dash, a pizza eating contest and a cake walk just to name a few!</P>

<P>I hope to see each and everyone of you there! Time/Date/Place/Shard to
be announced soon! All proceeds will benefit COAL (Coalition of Attack
Lemurs) and the ATM (Association of Tank Mages). Please come out to
benefit these worthy causes.</P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo, Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Adept Tank Mage who has been told that he looks like a
young, skinny P.T. Barnum.</P>
