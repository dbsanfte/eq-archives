<P>I'm wondering what it is like to play this game called EverQuest.
It looks like it must be fun. So many people tell of fantastic sights
and sounds. I can't play though. Everything I do to play is thwarted.
I've had the game for four days now and I've not been able to connect to
a game server yet. I feel like I'm six years old again with a fever
staring out the window at all the other kids playing.</P>
<P>Monday after coming in from work, I had a message on my machine
telling me that the game was in. Oh goody! I was so excited that I
jumped back into the car and forgot that I had to go to the bathroom. So
25 minutes later when I got to the mall, I was in need of relief. Well that was one
problem solved easily enough.</P>
<P>I went to the computer store and picked up my copy. I opened up the
front of the blue box. Wow! A fight scene with scantily clad women all
of whom have to be at least a D cup. This is gonna be fun. I rushed home
even though I knew the servers wouldn't be up until the following day. </P>
<P>Like the virtuous person that I am, I waited and installed the game
Tuesday evening. I tried to run it. All that happened were illegal
operation errors and black screens. If I wanted black screens, PaintShop
Pro would have done that for me. I would also have my choise of red, blue, green, etc.</P>
<P>After bugging my friend for two hours
Wednesday night, he got to the bottom of the problem. My processor was
one that was incompatible. Oh well, I needed to upgrade anyway. I didn't
really plan on doing it so soon and was short of cash but I was able to
borrow the money.</P>
<P>I made a trip to the computer store Thursday night and headed to
the upgrade desk. I was stuck in line for thirty minutes behind a man
who was obviously in a computer store for the first time in his life. He
was dressed in khaki shorts and sandals. I think his legs were shaved too. (I was in line a looooong time.)
He was completely blown away by
the fact that he could buy a laptop computer and access the internet
from ANYWHERE in the world that he could hook his modem into. Well he
was amazed when he found out what a modem was and what it did.</P>
<P>     At first, I stood there patiently. I'm a patient person. I did,
after all, play Ultima Online right after it was released. So I stood
there. I stood there even though this guy should have gone to the 'New
Computer' desk. I didn't think that was too much to ask. He was,after all, trying to buy a new computer. The upgrade desk is
for people seeking 'upgrades'. The word 'upgrade' implies that one
already has a system which they are uhm 'upgrading'. </P>
<P>Then I did that thing
where you shift your weight from one foot to the other. It's the
universal sign that you're getting tired of waiting. The lone guy
working at the desk sensed this and started trying to wrap up the
conversation with the newbie.</P>
<P>     To make a long story short, (too late) he finally was sent to the
other side of the store to bug someone else. I asked the upgrade man
what kind of processors they had and he told me they didn't stock any.
*Sigh* A little more talking on my part and I was rewarded with him
bringing a Pentium from the back. I paid my money and came home.</P>
<P>     The installation of the new chip was easy. Only four hours and I
was up and running again. (Four hours because I kept dropping screws and
my cat would bat them under the bookshelf.) I proceeded to the EverQuest
icon and cautiously double clicked.</P>
<P>     I connected to the patch server as before. Some files were
downloaded correctly, others denied me permission. *Sigh* At the end of
patching, I was rewarded with an error screen telling me that I have a
problem. "Duh really?" I thought that an uninstallation and reinstall
might get me further. It did.</P>
<P>     This time around, I got all the patches. I started the registration
process. Please select credit card. Visa, MasterCard, American Express.
Where's Discover card? Oh **&%. I'm not a violent person. I don't lose
control of my temper. However, I was about to control my temper right
into my monitor. I thought, "Wait, Mom's got a MasterCard. She won't
mind." She didn't and I was able to register.</P>
<P>     I got even farther. A server list! My hands were sweating with
anticipation. My quest was nearing its completion. I'm sure that the arm
pits of my shirt had huge circles of sweat. I was nearing my grail! I
clicked the server that several of my friends are on and before I could
make it to the Play EverQuest button, it said it was down. I picked
another one. I clicked the button. Nothing happened. I picked the PvP server. At this point,
if I'd gotten the Entering Britannia screen and had some guy tell me it was EQ, I proabably would have
been so happy that I would have lost control of my bodily functions.</P>
<P>     That didn't happen. I went to the chat. Surprisingly that worked with no trouble. There
was a message saying they were having problems. "Well Sony, Welcome to
the club!"</P>
<P>     A friend told me that was happening to everyone. I breathed a sigh
of relief. Maybe, it's not me this time. Maybe I'll be able to play. I
woke up early this morning. (I'm off from work for quite a few days
now.) I tried to connect. I had the same problem as the night before.
Then just as a superstitious precaution, I ran scandisk. It found an
error with DriveSpace. It said the free space on the drive was
displaying incorrectly. It corrected the problem and my shown free space
went from 250 megs to 70 megs. </P>
<P>     I uninstalled UO and just for good measure, uninstalled and
reinstalled EverQuest. I got the patch again. Now I can't connect to the
chat server. And now, I conclude and you think, 'Finally!'</P>
<P>     I sit here looking at this blue box with gold letters on the back
that proclaim, "You're in our world now!" Hahahahah! The box art is very
nice but I'm sure that I could get some nice scans off the internet for
free later on. What I really want is to play. Have I offended some
EverQuest god and messed up my faction with Sony? I have a Playstation
and a Sony stereo if that might help. Do I need to burn my Nintendo 64
along with my copy of Ultima Online? Do I need to sell myself of the street
 or cut the letters S O N Y into my arm with a razor blade? Well, I will do it. (All except the part about the N64, I just love mine.)</P>
<P>     I feel confident that some day I will get to play. I hope that day
is close. Is there anyone who can shed any light on what I may be doing
wrong, or just send me some sympathy, or tell me what this game is like.
Thanks for taking the time to share my pain.</P>
