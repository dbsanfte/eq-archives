<P>Good day to ya all,</P>

<P>The list this time needs a little bit of setting up. It was inspired by
an earlier post about light bulb jokes. My list includes the Top Ten
responses from posters on this newsgroup to the question: "Why did the
chicken cross the road?" The names are left out to protect the innocent
and the guilty. My own comments are denoted by dashes.</P>

<P>10. "The issue of said chicken crossing said road is entirely Origin's
fault. The lawsuit I've filed against Origin will stop this road
crossing once and for all. Origin must not be allowed to get away with
it. So if you dickheads won't join me, that's fine F$%CKWITS."</P>

<P>-I've always wondered, are the words dickhead and f&$ckwit legal terms?</P>
<P>By the way, I looked at some old posts and these two gems did come from the poster I originally suspected. I was not mistaken as I had thought. </P>

<P>9. "The answer depends. If the chicken is a mage, he should not be
allowed to wear armor because it's tradition and thus crossing the road
would be too dangerous. However, if the chicken is an archer, he should
be allowed to wear any kind of armor and would be able to cross the road
easily."</P>

<P>8. "U GuyZ AlWays Whine AbOuT chiCkeNs CroSSinG the RoAd. If U dOn'T
LiKe It, JuSt QuIT!!!!!"</P>

<P>7. "i think that chickens shouldn't cross the road in the first place i
mean if a car came by they could get really hurt and killed too trucks
do the same thing too i know because i live near a farm and i see lots
of chickens get hit and i know it really hurts them cause they scream
really loud and i hear it all the way behind my house and sometimes i'm
like what happened and then i see that a chicken is hurt or dead well
that's my opinion so there i'm going to play my thieve character now"    </P>

<P>6. "Aahhh. A chicken! What a GRAND AND GLORIOUS NIGHT OF HUNTING! The
bards of Britannia will sing praises to me."</P>
 
<P>-  We love ya Cyclone!</P>

<P>5. "WHAT SHARD IS THE CHICKEN ON?????"</P>

<P>4. "F*&K the chicken! OSI is a bunch of F*&KHEADS. F*&K YOU! F*&K YO
MOMMA! I'm so F*&King PISSED."</P>

<P>-This one could actually apply to a lot of folks. Especially a certain newcomer.</P>

<P>3. "Corp Por Corp Por Corp Por..........     What chicken?"</P>

<P>2. "The chicken crossing the road is an issue that we've been working on
for the past few months. Our research indicates that the chicken is not
actually crossing the road and that all the UO gamers are
hallucinating."    </P>

<P>1. "Hmm Why did the chicken cross the road? I bet I could write a Top
Ten List about it."</P>

<P>-Wonder who this could be.</P>

<P>And another one finished. Thanks again for reading. If anyone would like
to follow up with possible names it would be very helpful. I wouldn't
suggest that someone do something like that but I would have a ball
seeing it. </P>

list half as much as I enjoyed writing it, well then I enjoyed it twice
as much as you did."</P>
