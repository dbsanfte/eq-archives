<p align="left"><font size="3">Last time, WetCondom had just been
trained in all things PvP by Sperminator. He is now on a trip to
see British and learn more of his quest to rid Britannia of the 8
PKs of Virtue.</font></p>

<hr>

<p>You appear in Britain in an unfamiliar location. It kind of
looks like a tavern but no one is inside. &quot;WTF?&quot; you
say aloud. &quot;y wood sperminator makr a ruen here?&quot; You're
just going to have to walk it. Remembering that Britain is huge
and takes up four pages in your strategy guide, you decide to ask
someone the way to British's castle. </p>

<p>The first person you encounter is walking into the tavern as
you're walking out. His name is &quot;Titus Bloodforge&quot;. He
appears to be dressed as a blacksmith, with his apron and gloves.
From your training by Sperminator, you recognize him immediately
as an RPer, but decide to try to talk to him anyway.</p>

<p>&quot;uhm sup thou&quot;, you say. Titus replies, &quot;I am
faring well in endeavors today and thee?&quot; You say, &quot;i
art in searcheth of birtish...im his avatar&quot;. Titus groans
and says, &quot;OOC: Damn not again!&quot; He regains his
roleplaying composure and says, &quot;British's castle is to the
north. Though, I'd advise that you relenquish your quest.&quot;
&quot;y?//&quot;, you ask. He continues, &quot;Oh, foul times are
here indeed! Fighting the PK scum will not help matters! Oh, foul
times are here indeed! I have prayed for many moons to the gods
Raph and Sunsword for a PK switch but my prayers are unanswered.
Wilt thou pray with me as well? Send thy prayers to sunsword@ultimaoffline.com.&quot;
You say, &quot;taht soudns boring..i wnat 2 fite tehm&quot;</p>

<p>He *shakes his head* and *walks away muttering to himself*.
&quot;another lamer&quot;, you think and head north. You pass
several more people on the way to the castle. One of them, named
colonblast, tries to snoop in your pack. You yell, &quot;GRAUDS!&quot;
but nothing happens. You tell the theif, &quot;u beeter stop...im
teh avartar&quot; as continues snooping. &quot;yeh rite&quot;, he
says and takes your all your gold and begins running away. &quot;GRAUDS!&quot;
you repeat. Again nothing.</p>

<p>You try to rally support from the crowd but no one believe you're
the avatar. They either recall or tell you that you're 'gay'.
Frustrated, you continue to British's castle. </p>

<p>Upon arriving and entering the throne room, you're shocked to
see British standing in the middle of the room in nothing but his
socks and boxer shorts doing the Macarena. There is no music to
be heard except that which British sings himself. He begins his
final spin and sees you. With a look of extreme shock, he
disappers behind a curtain and quickly steps back out with a robe
on. The robe has a silver penis embroidered on the back of it.</p>

<p>He says with his face blood red, &quot;well wetcondom waht can
i do 4 u?&quot; You answer, &quot;well thers 2 things....im ready
to fite teh 8pks but i dont kno wher 2 start&quot; He smiles and
says, &quot;teh tiem has some tehn...i sahll tell u moer about ur
quest&quot;</p>

<p>British begins, &quot;teh world is in crisis....ppl r leeving
every day 4 palces liek everquest, asherons call, and soem place
called parappah teh rapper...with every person taht leeves..the
amoutn of 'monthly fees' goes dwon&quot; You interrupt, &quot;monthly
fees?&quot; British says, &quot;yeh..monthly fees hold teh world
2gether...without tehm all taht u see will simply cease 2 exist....taht
is y ur mission is so improtatn...an ancient magazine found in
teh great bathroom of teh now dead wizard mondain tells of teh
tiems we live in now...it tells of teh 'kewlio' spell and teh
effeects it wood haev...it tells of teh overrunning of teh wprld
by pks...it tells of 'bugs' and 'patches ' fallinf from teh sky....it
even tells of ppl leeving britannia 2 get away from it and teh
end of teh world....but there is hope....mondain left instruction
2 stop teh spell..he left 8 'kewl' reagents with 8 of his most
trusted pks....wehn these regs are gathered 2gether its is
possible 2 cast a powerful spell...teh spell is called 'UOTWO'
and it is sposed 2 bring teh monthly fees back 2 teh realm&quot;</p>

<p>You take in this new information and say, &quot;k but who and
wher r teh pks?&quot; British smiles, &quot;as u kno ther are 8
of tehm....ther naems are 'minerz suk' the miner PK......'KrimKillah'
the noto-pk....'FuzzyBallz' teh tamer pk.....'MERLIN' the mage pk.....

cheater....u will haev 2 kill each of tehm and taek the 'kewl'
reg taht each carries....bring each one 2 me...and pray 'UOTWO'

<p>You say, &quot;k wher r tehy?&quot; British frowns, &quot;we
dont kno...tehy move aroudn a recall alot....tehy may find u....u
may find tehm,...good lcuk 2 u&quot;. &quot;k thx&quot;, you say
and turn to leave. British stops you and says, &quot;wait...u sed
u had 2 problems...waht was teh other?//&quot; Suddenly
remembering, you say, &quot;o yeh...no one believe taht im teh
avatar...cna u make an announcemint or sumthing?&quot; British
says, &quot;well i wood but my cellular wall is broken rite now..i
will give u this though.&quot; He reaches under the cushion he's
sitting on and pulls out a true black jester tunic. &quot;with
thsi..teh ppl will kno u r teh avatar&quot;, he finishes. </p>

<p>You pull the jester tunic over your head and say, &quot;kewl
thx..&quot; and head out to the city of Britain, eager to kill
the 8 PKs so that you can see the kick ass ending that this game
is sure to have!</p>

<p>Meanwhile............</p>

<p>The scene shifts to a tower halfway across the world. There
are 8 men standing on top of it, each has a red name. They are
listening to a com crystal. &quot;and the leeder of the pks 'l33t
h4ck4h' the cheater....u will haev 2 kill each of tehm and taek
the 'kewl' reg taht each carries....bring each one 2 me...and
pray 'UOTWO' works&quot;, the crystal says. l33t h4ck4h stands.
He is dressed in full bone and carries a heavy crossbow with the
words &quot;one hit ur ded&quot; scratched on them. He says,
&quot;so wetcondom knos who we r now...we cant allow teh avatar 2
suceed....we msut keep teh 8 kewl regz 4 ourselves so taht wehn
mondain resses, he can recast teh &quot;Nostat Loss&quot; spell
and remove all our suffering...Therin Darkheart u must go and
stop thsi avatar....bring me his head...go now&quot; Therin
stands and says, &quot;Yes my liege, it will be to my greatest
pleasure to see the blood of this young welp stain the hem of my
tunic! Oh prithee, gods be with ye WetCondom. May your soul be
prepared because your life shall surely...&quot; &quot;GO ON U
LAMER!&quot;, screams l33t h4ck4h. &quot;Yes sir&quot;, says
Therin, who quickly recalls away. </p>

<p>l33t h4ck4h turns and looks at the remaining PKs. &quot;wetcondom
we will OWN UR ASS!&quot;, he says and laughs in the most evil
way that you can possibly imagine. &quot;Muahahahahahahahahah&quot;,
the others join in.</p>

<hr>

<p>What shall happen to WetCondom? Will he overcome the PKs? Will
he fail to save the world? Will he give up and go play Quake? Who
knows?</p>
