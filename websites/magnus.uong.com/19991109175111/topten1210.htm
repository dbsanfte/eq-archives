<P>Hello out there,</P>

<P>     Wait a sec, you're not out there, you're in here, or something. Oh
well, I have a new top ten list ready. You wanna hear it or should I
wait until next week to post it? Hmmmmmmm, ok. Here goes. The background
to this one: DD has been kidnapped by KeWLiOs. The KeWLiOs try to keep
up the appearence that everything is normal, but they want to make their
own changes to the game. Here's a letter from the development team
written by the anonymous DooDz. (Raph, I hope you enjoy this one too,
this is no way to be taken as a slam on you. And, you aren't getting
snubbed this time, you're the star! ;) )</P>
