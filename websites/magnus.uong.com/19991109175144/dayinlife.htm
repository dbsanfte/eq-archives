</HEAD>

<P>I wake to find myself once again standing by the lake in Halas and
not sitting as when I went to sleep. I am thinking that I must be sleep
walking but since I'm always in the same spot, perhaps it is sleep
standing. No matter though, as long as I don't wake up in the bottom of
the well, I suppose there is no harm. </P>

<P>I feel hungry so I sit and memorize the Summon Food and Summon
Water spell. After several minutes of casting, I have a stack of black
bread and a stack of brown water. One would think that if the art of
creating food were mastered, creating *good* food wouldn't be that much
more of a step. I would love to create a MacMammoth double goat
cheeseburger from time to time but bread and dirty water is all I get.
As a matter of fact, that's all I ever eat anymore. To quote a great man
from the past, Dundee I believe, "You can live on it, but it taste like
shit." No worrying about that though either. I could be fishing and be
spilling nonexistant beer.</P>

<P>Having prepared food for my trip, I jump into the icy water and
swim to the other side. I emerge with my boots making that squishing wet
sound and my leather armor glistening with moisture. I guess it's a good
thing I don't wear anything under my kilt of I'd have a really bad rash
by now. That reminds me, a tip for you young barbarians, ALWAYS cross
your legs when you sit down. It will save you and others around you much
embarrassment later on.  </P>

<P>I walk through the narrow cave passage that leads to EverFrost
peaks. As I round the second corner, I stop for a few minutes to ponder
a phrase I heard once in my youth. "LOADING PLEASE WAIT" I still can not
get any meaning from it, but I often reflect upon it when travelling
through narrow passages.</P>

<P>I step out of the cave and take a look around. There's snow, rocks,
and the occasional body. I see nearly naked barbarians whacking on
wolves with sticks and cheap swords. Well at least everything is normal
here today.</P>

<P>EverFrost peaks is always abuzz with activity. The air is alive
with shouts of "Help!", "where r u?", and "anyone seen Karg?" One can
hear Ice Goblin whelps taunt their foes, "It's level 1 to 6 characters
like you who have ruined your own lands, you'll not ruin mine!" The
gnoll pups are talkative as well, "In the way of my father, I shall die
to newbies and respawn in 15 minutes!" Perhaps the most disturbing are
the occasional sex crazed lunatics that shout, "Has anyone seen my
body?" or "Can someone here bind me? Will pay well!"</P>

<P>I ignore most of this now as it's the norm in EverFrost. Today I'm
hunting lions in the Karanas. I pass through Blackburrow to Qeynos hills
stopping only to consider "LOADING. PLEASE WAIT." twice. Here I am
confronted with more activity. I emerge from the tunnel from BlackBurrow
and am immediately confronted with 5 simulatneous telepathic messages.
"can u woolf me plz?", "i need to get binded in qeynos", "do u have
SoW", "selling pathcwork?", and "This is Dundee. Stop using my lines in
your stories." I ignore all of them and head to the Karanas.</P>

<P>I try to leave this area as quickly as possible. I can not help but
stop and watch as a rabid grizzly bear attacked a poor young elf who
takes up arms against him. A passing druid, a self appointed protecter
of nature, zaps the elf with a lightning bolt and proceeds on as if
nothing had happened.</P>

<P>After witnessing that, I make a bee line for the Karanas. I see a
lion and quickly dispatch him. As I am sitting upon my ass, pondering
the nature of the universe, I hear someone shout "HILL GIANT!" I barely
have time to look up from my spell book before I feel a heavy hand come
down on my head. I fall over and catch a glimpse of a 12 foot tall being
in a true black cape. He walks over to my unconscious body and says,
"LOL i roked ur noobie azz..guess waht mangus im taht reeper frum UO
that killed u befor... i got eq now and i can move!!1111,...come back
later wehn u dont suk so muhc". Then he does crotch chops and gives me
instructions to "SUK IT". He attacks me once more and I am dead and then
reborn in Halas. </P>

<P>I think, "Wow! That was a lot of fun. It makes things so much more
unboring! I think I'll go back to sleep." And I do just that.</P>
