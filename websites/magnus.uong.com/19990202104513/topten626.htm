<H1 align="center">Top Ten 6\26</H1>
<P>I return!,</P>

<P>I just spent this past week out of town helping in the remodeling
efforts of a store. For four days, I was away from my home, my computer,
Ultima On-Line, R.G.C.U.O., and the NGI. Did anybody miss me? While I
was away, I had little time to consider all things Ultima, but I manage
to get a top ten list squeezed out just in time for this week. I really,
really missed my Ultima On-Line time. I started pretending I was playing
Ultima while I was at work. My bosses on the other hand, must not know
too much about Ultima because I got a lot of odd stares and was not
asked to some back next week and help finish the store.
Yaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!!!!!! (That's 10 exclamation points! OK eleven now.)
Here they are, the top ten things heard from me over the past week.</P>

<P>10. While constructing a wall: I'm afraid all this carpentry is going to
lower my intelligence. </P>
 
<P>9. Driving to our destination, stuck in traffic: It's all the damn
houses that are causing this lag!</P>

<P>8. To the regional manager (third highest position in company): So
you're like a GM, right? Do you know Lord British and Blackthorn?</P>

<P>7. At hotel the first night: KeWl! I get to log off in an inn!</P>

<P>6. To my district manager: We've got to get back tomorrow! My house is
going to disappear!</P>

<P>5. After standing still for 15 minutes,</P>
<P>District Manager: What the *&^% are you doing?</P>
<P>Magnus: I am too fatigued to move.</P>
<P>District Manager: What the hell?</P>
<P>Magnus: I'm carrying a lot of shelves and I have a bunch of tools in my
pockets, I think I'm overloaded.</P>
<P>District Manager: So take your shoes off and come on!</P>

<P>4. I always wear the same clothes everyday! Unless someone kills me and
takes them of course. In that case, I have to go buy new ones. </P>

<P>3. u lamerz are spending money on food?! DD told us that it only helps
your life to regenerate faster...god u r a bunch of morons</P>

<P>2. Regional Manager: Uhm, I think you need to put your name tag on.</P>
<P>Magnus: Nah, people can just hit allnames if they want to know who I am.</P>
<P>Regional Manager: PUT THE $%^%ING NAME TAG ON NOW!</P>
<P>Magnus: Oh, that's how it's gonna be huh? Let's rumble! I have 91 magery
fat boy!</P>

<P>Magnus: Uhm, you better be glad I'm out of reagents.</P>
<P>*Regional Manager walks away shaking head.*</P>

<P>1. *Magnus walks to the front counter, grumbling.*</P>
<P>Magnus: Do you have my name tag?</P>
<P>Clerk: Yes, it's that last one over there. The only one not taken.</P>
<P>Magnus: That's not my name.</P>
<P>Clerk: Well, what's your name sir?</P>
<P>Magnus: Magnus, Master Tank Mage  -M-A-G-N-U-S-</P>
<P>Clerk: Magnus, that's an interesting name. Where are you from?</P>
<P>Magnus: I hail from the city of Ocllo on the island of Ocllo.</P>
<P>Clerk: Ocllo? I've never heard of that city before where is it?</P>
<P>Magnus: You just sail east from Trinsic. You can't miss it. Of course, I
usually use my magic to get there.</P>
<P>Clerk: Oh I see, you're from California. (It's a joke folks.)</P>

<P>Thanks for readin'. Did I lose my sense of humor while I was gone? If I
did, I'm getting back in the car tonight and going back to get it. </P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo,Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Master Tank Mage who was surprised that nobody he met
this week knows where Ocllo is</P>
