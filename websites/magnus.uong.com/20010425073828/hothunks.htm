<P>That's right girls! Do like big strong men? We at Playgirl magazine
have just what you're looking for! This month we feature the hunks of
Ultima Online. We are focusing on the big sweaty craftsmen.</P>
<P>We have one whole issue jam packed with revealing photos of
carpenters, bowyers, lumberjacks, and (We didn't forget your favorites
girls!) the miners. These bad boys of the crafts take it all off this
month! </P>
<P>These guys aren't wimpy newbies we're talking about either. They're
all 100% established mules. These guys are buff. Chopping trees and
digging for ore gives a boy 100 strength in no time. These boys are
ready to show off just for YOU!</P>
<P>Take a look this month and get special savings on black pearl
cream. It gives you the studded leather line you've always wanted! Also
be sure to check out the insert on flirting with Mr. Right using just
emoting! You'll snare that guy in no time flat! And our on going monthly
editorial, "What is it that men really want?" This month we talk about
reagents and how to get them in bulk.</P>
<P>That's not all! We've saved the best for last! As always we've
picked the most gorgeous guy to be our centerfold. This month you can
check out the world famous miner, "NOZE PICKA" as he shows off his brand
new 'pickaxe of power'! Check it out girls!!!!!</P>
