<P>Salutations,</P>

<P>Hey, hey what time is it???? Right! Clear out your house again because
of another break in bug!! Yaaay!! </P>
<P>*Magnus steps up on soapbox*</P>
<P>Aren't cheaters the scum of the earth? I just read a post from GM Ed
that the new reputation is having to be postponed because of this bug.
=-( To all the Origin folks, I know there's been a lot of critism
lately, but I have to say great job on the lag, and I am very pleased to
see Boomer, DD and GM Ed posting here again regularly to keep us up to
date. I just wish there weren't all these cheaters and hackers trying to
tear the game apart and waste your resources.</P>
<P>*Magnus gets off the box* </P>
<P>How about a top ten list about all the people out there who have to
resort to programming bugs to obtain virtual wealth, skills, or status?
It won't help the problem, but maybe it'll help you feel better. =-)
(Steve, your post about the purple moustache inspired this.) Without
further ado, the top ten signs that your neighbor (in UO) is a bug
exploiter. </P>

<P>10.They painted their house that "Shadowlord" black color.
I hope I'm not the only one that thinks that color black is about the
dumbest thing for people to fall in love with. I saw someone with a
copletely black outfit. On their paper doll, they looked like a floating
head and hands. Kinda like a bad Wes Craven movie. Is there even such a
thing as a good Wes Craven movie?</P>

<P>9. They built their house on a server line and continually cross it
while shooting a rabbit with a three day old heavy cross bow while
bowing, logging out, eating a piece of bread, casting telekinesis
(there's got to be a use for it), macroing begging, and saying "Vendor
buy me a bank guard!". If you see them the next day with a purple
moustache, you'll know for sure. ;) If not, they were just practicing a
new dance called the 'Lagarena'. (Give Steve the credit for this one.)</P>

<P>8. They buy their house, then to keep other exploiters from getting in,
they block their front door with three castles.
I've actually heard people bragging about owning three castles by
themselves. I don't know why one person needs three castles but, more importantly, how
would one person afford it?</P>
<P>a) They're a duper</P>
<P>b) They bought up a lot of stock in archery companies back before
Christmas at dirt cheap prices and now are collecting on that.</P>

<P>7. Their name is Neil Diamond. </P>
<P>I don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said, but I'm
gonna try. ;) What a pathetic individual that person is! Risking one's job
for advancement in a video game is not on my list of top ten smart
things to do to get ahead in the world. Do you put something like that on your
resume? I don't know exactly what the punishment was, but I hear it
involved this lowlife, Judge Judy, and a locked room with a baseball bat
suspended from a chain inside. Can you confirm this Boomer?</P>

<P>6. GMs are constantly asking you if they can set up a stakeout at your
house.</P>
<P>GM BugSmasha: Can we set up a sting op. in your house?</P>
<P>You: What's in it for me?</P>
<P>GM BugSmasha: Hmmm, well we'll get rid of the cheater.</P>
<P>You: How about a free month of UO?</P>
<P>GM BugSmasha: There's nothing I can do.</P>
<P>You: What? </P>
<P>GM BugSmasha: Sorry, hit the wrong macro key.</P>
<P>GM BugSmasha: I meant to say that, Lord British is in need of a new
Ferarri and needs all the $10 a month's he can get.</P>
<P>You: OK how about replacing the stuff I lost during the last bug?</P>
<P>GM BugSmasha: GMs are not allowed to replace lost items.</P>
<P>You: OK forget it then.</P>
<P>GM BugSmasha: Pleeeeeaaaase, I'll make ya a heavy crossbow of
vanquishing.</P>
<P>Oh there's so many places I could go with this but I'll stop here cuz
there's five more to go. =-)</P>

<P>5. The sign on their castle/keep/tower says, "What happened to
www.bugzuptheass.com?"</P>
<P>Wasn't that just the greatest episode of BON3DOOD and pLaTeDewd?</P>

<P>u c bon3dood attcking u!!1   (hahahhahahahhahah)</P>

<P>platdweed is atactking u!    (hehehehhehehehehe)</P>

<P>crop por                     (Stop it guys, my sides are hurting!)</P>

<P>4. They have a vendor with 10 Indestructable Surpassingly Accurate
Halberds of Vanquishing and Daemon's Breath with 999 charges for sale.
I could be wrongly accusing somebody here, do you think they found them
all? =-)</P>
<P>I honestly saw a vendor with 7 Indestructable Heavy Crossbows of Force
for sale. I IDed them and every one checked out. Kinda makes me think of
Diablo. </P>
<P>"I need a king's sword of haste"</P>
<P>"I'll dupe you a grandfather"</P>
<P>"Can someone make me a godly plate of the whale?"</P>
<P>"No, but I have an obsidian ring of the Zodiac."</P>

<P>3. They accidently drop a stack of 100000 pearl.</P>
<P>a) They're dupers</P>
<P>b) Your neighbor is Bill Gates and he wants to control the world's pearl
supply</P>
<P>c) We have a good idea who's buying out the mage shops now</P>

<P>2. Everytime they walk onto your screen, your client crashes.</P>
<P>Players that are so pathetic at the game that they resort to something
like this just to hurt other players are disgusting. These people are
even worse than Neil Diamond. They are the ones who would cheat in
solitaire and think they've really done something.</P>
<P>"Heheh, hey man! I just got this awesome cheat for MineSweeper!"</P>
<P>"No way! I just found this awesome hacking program for Sensible Soccer."</P>

<P>1. You see your neighbor posting to RGCUO with subject headings like:</P>
<P>I WILL TRADE UNPOSTED BUGS!</P>
<P>BE A GOD IN UO!</P>
<P>I hate UO and I'm going to ruin it for everyone else</P>
<P>I'm too pathetic to play the game without cheating</P>

<P>What do these children grow up to become? Tax dodging parasites? Job
Hoppers? Programmers for Microsoft? (I didn't say that!)</P>

<P>Well, well, well, I did it. Another week, another list. How'd I do? Do I
get to keep hanging around here some more?</P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo,Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Adept Tank Mage who thinks bugzuptheass would be
extremely uncomfortable</P>
