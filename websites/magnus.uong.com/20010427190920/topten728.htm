<P>Alas RCGUOers,</P>

<P>'Tis a sad day indeed. Cyclone's departure from this newsgroup is indeed
bad news. I dedicate this top ten to Cyclone. Thanks for all the laughs
buddy.</P>
<P>________________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>Dear UO customers,</P>

<P>     We realize that many of you are eagerly awaiting the new housing
changes, just as we are eagerly awaiting the release of the Jerry
Springer video. However, there have been substantial setbacks which have
caused the housing changes to be delayed.</P>
<P>     The recent crashes on the Catskills shard were our primary concern.
After weeks of testing, we finally discovered the problem. The janitor
in the building needed a place to plug in his vaccuum cleaner and was
unplugging the server each evening when he cleaned. We have bought him
some extension cords and hope this clears up the problem. Of course this
means we are going to have to go up on the price of The Second Age to cover
this unexpected expense.</P>
<P>     The second delay was of course the 'break-up' of the Spice Girls.
DD has been crying non-stop mumbling something about the Beatles and the
end of an epoch and Boomer refuses to come out of his office. Instead,
he's been sitting inside singing "I'll tell you what I want, what I
really, really want." over and over again and eating nothing but
fudgesicles. We will keep you posted on this developing situation.</P>
<P>     In happier news, we now have a list of new changes you can expect
to see once the new housing system goes in. For some odd reason, we
could think of no greater, nor fewer than ten to list. Here they are, in
random order....... </P>
   
<P>10. Once weather patterns are introduced, expect to see air conditioners
sticking out of windows and central heat and air units behind houses.
These will be installed by fat NPCs, named Leroy, whose buttcracks will
show.</P>

<P>9. Lawn furniture is going to be introduced. The following items will
become available. (Please visualize these in the game as you read. =) )</P>
<P>Pink flamingos</P>
<P>Bird baths (Great for archers gathering feathers!)</P>
<P>Wooden cutout of an old woman's butt bending over a flower bed</P>
<P>Tires cut in half with flowers growing out of them</P>
<P>Concrete frogs sitting on a bench with an umbrella</P>
<P>A little jockey holding a latern</P>
<P>Yard signs that say, "Forget the dog, beware of owner." (At least until
we get around to the pet attack revision. Dogs will become very
competitive.)</P>

<P>Since we at OSI are concerned primarily with keeping UO realistic, all
lawn ornaments are 100% stealable.</P>

<P>8. Tents will become house trailers. This means that the player that
owns the 'tent/trailer' will be able to move it to new locations.</P>

<P>7. Owners of houses are responsible for the maintenance of the property
for 4 tiles around the house on all sides. They will be required to wear
khaki shorts, white undershirts, and sandles with dark socks as they
perform such chores as mowing the grass, edging the side of the house,
and trimming any trees that may be in their responsibility. For
homeowners who do not keep their property well maintained, the guards
will have their own brand of punishment prepared. "Thou shalt regret
thine nasty yard, swine!"</P>
 
<P>6. For all the owners of smithies out there, you'll now be able to slap
a grill over that forge and have a barbeque. We know that you've been
dying to use all those ribs you've been saving and now your wait will
pay off. This is a change that we know will have a deep impact on the
game so we will soon have a BBQ FAQ in place on our website.</P>

<P>5. New house construction will now take up to three months Ultima time.
It will also require the hiring of several NPCs who do nothing but stand
around and supervise while other hired NPCs take coffee breaks. There
will still be other hired NPCs whose only function is to stare at the
blueprints for hours at a time and say, "Hmmmmm" a lot. But that's not
all, there will be hired NPCs to do all of the following homebuilding
tasks....</P>
<P>-Make huge mudholes in your front yard</P>
<P>-Tell you that the house is going to cost much more than the original
estimate</P>
<P>-Drive that really cool thing with the rollers</P>
<P>-Walk around the construction site with a hammer and one nail in his
mouth</P>

<P>4. The brass signs on the houses will all be replaced by satellite
dishes.</P>

<P>3. There will be new door to door salesmen NPCs who will try and
convince you to buy magazines, girl scout cookies, cookbooks, and Avon
products. These NPCs will use the same program algorithms as the beggar
NPCs. We may even allow them to keep the 'telepathy' feature that
beggars have enjoyed so long.</P>

<P>2. Homeowners will be entitled to special savings! For instance, vinyl
siding from Sears installed for free! Low interest rate mortgages! (Dan
Marino said so!) Tillers from Troy Built! and much much more! </P>

<P>1. Naming a house "Love Shack", "Sex Mansion", or any other variant will
flag the owner as a criminal. (Yes, "The White House" is considered a
variant of "Sex Mansion", sorry Bill.)  Other criminal names: "cOOl
crib", "House of Pain", "Home of Da Boyz", "Go Away", and "My House".</P>

<P>     We hope to publish the patch to the test center next week, We will
then take the test center offline and ask you to test it. Then, we'll go
to the video store and get a copy of Spice World and give it to DD. If
it cheers him up, the housing revision will be ready by spring of 99. If
DD doesn't cheer up, uhm... Well nevermind about that. </P>

<P>-Regards,</P>
<P>OSI staff</P>

<P>I close another. One more down, who knows how many more I may crank out?
Until next time, I remain...</P>
