<P>We last left the avatar, WetCondom, accepting Lord British' offer of
an order shield in exchange for defeating the eight pks of virtue. We
now rejoin them in Lord British' throne room.</P>

<P>________________________________________________________________________</P>



<P>     "u will?//", Lord British asks with a look of sheer disbelief on
his face. "yes", you reply. "well u r the 1st to say taht tehy would",
British tells you. "kewl", you reply. </P>

<P>     British's face changes from a look of shocked happiness to one of a
stern seriousness. "u will need help", he says. "u need soemone who knos
much about tihs land..someoen to helpo u kil teh 8 GM pks", he
continues. You ask, "y dont u help me?" British squirms in his seat and
replies, "uhm..u know hwo i said i was pked once??/ well teh lamers
looted me and tihs is teh lsat set of tihs kewl palte taht i have...if i</P>

<P>get pked again ill lose it.." "o i c  taht sux", you answer.</P>

<P>     "no WetCondom, i can not afrod to lose tihs palte or id help u, u
need soemone else...MAGNUS!!!", he shouts and claps his hands. "MAGNUS
weher r u??//", he yells again. </P>

<P>    The air crackles, and a magical sound cuts through the air. In the
middle of the throne room appears a man dressed in black plate armor
with a long dark grey cape. It is Magnus, the tank mage. "whoa cool!",
WetCondom is impressed. </P>

<P>     Lord British turns to Magnus and says, "as prat of ur punishment 4
trying to taek my throne u will be WetCondoms guide on his quest...u
will help him and teach him 2 be a warrior" Magnus takes off his plate
helmet just to make sure that British sees him rolling his eyes. Magnus'
steel grey hair hangs down on his shoulders.</P>

<P>     "dont u dare emote rolling ur eyes at me buster!", British fumes,
"ill personally throw u into teh dungeon myslef!!111" Magnus laughs and
says, "Oh, you will not." He adds, "You're too scared of getting
PKed at the dungeons." This angers British even more and he says, "ok
tehn u lamer...ill decay one of ur houses." British sticks out his
tongue at Magnus for added effect. "Go ahead," Magnus says, "I'll have
it replaced by evening." "well ill make sure its the one by the bnak in
ocllo..and u kno once its gone u cant build there anymore...hehheheheh",
British cackles.</P>

<P>     "You do that and I'll make sure that everyone knows about your
'relationship' with Blackthorn.", Magnus replies. "waht do u meen?//
balckthron is my closest colleege", British asks. "Let's just say I have
a screenshot of you 'putting a little order into his chaos' during one
of your late night fireside 'debates'.", Magnus says, "If anything
happens to my house in Ocllo, all of Britannia gets to see you teaching
Blackthorn new uses for halberds." The color in British's face drains
and all he can say is "k". </P>

<P>     British regains his composure as best as he can and says, "magnus
plz do tihs, ill let u meditate with palte on" Magnus grins, "You have a
deal." British smiles once again and says, "WetCondom, now i ask u to go
forth into teh lands of brtannia with magnus as ur guide and conquer teh
evil in our lands..." British continues, "i see big things headed ur
way"</P>
<P>     At this remark, you burst into uncontrollable laughter. Magnus
stares at you and British's only remark is, "WFT//" Giving it your best
effort, you manage to say say, "heehehe my naem is condom hehe and u
said u see big things headed to me hehehe  u get it???" It's too much
for British. British howls with laughter and remarks, "ROFL!!!" This
continues for about five minutes as you and British laugh and make more
jokes concerning anatomy and the remarkable likeness on the order shield
to that member.</P>
<P>     Magnus stands behind you and begins pacing. He finally says, "Look
Ricky, I've got things to do. Hurry it up will you?" British turns from
his joking, stands up and says, "i told u my naem is lord birtish!!! and
u better not call me taht other naem anymo..". Magnus interrupts him,
"You know Ricky, you look cute with pink panties on your head." British
sits back down and clears his throat.</P>
<P>     He says, "liek i was saying..magnus will be ur guide,..he knos
much" and turning to Magnus, "magnus..i know u will hlep him anyway u
can...remembre i am stil ur king..and ill be keeping tabs on u with the
com crystal in ur pack magnus". Magnus rolls his eyes again and says,
"Whatever. Come on TrojanMan, let's get out of this hell hole of a city.
Vas Rel Por". A blue moongate appears from Magnus' hands and he
instructs you to walk through.</P>
<P>     You walk through the gate and suddenly, you're in a little town
with much smaller buildings than the ones in Britain. Magnus steps out
from the gate and dispels it with another magic spell. The air is fresh
and there are actually birds singing here.</P>
<P>     "wher r we?", you inquire. "This is Ocllo, one of the last few
places that the Kewlio doesn't fully control yet.", Magnus grumbles. You
walk a ways down the street and past a large mage shop. You walk a
little further and reach the bank. Magnus turns around suddenly and
says, "According to the rules, I have to tell you the history of the
world now and why your quest is so important. It's part of some kind of
'single player RPG' tradition that the saviour of the world
has to be told the entire history of the planet within 2 hours of his
arrival." You don't understand but you say, "k"</P>
<P>     Magnus begins, "The current state of this world is somewhat of a
mistake. The old wizard Mondain had ..." You interrupt, "i knoe
mundane!! we used to pk on atl" Magnus glares at you but proceeds,
"Ahem, Mondain had the world of Sosaria bound in his power with the gem
of immortality. He held absolute power until a traveller from the stars
defeated him and smashed the gem into thousands of fragments. Each of
these fragments contained a perfect likeness of Sosaria. This is the
nature of our world. There are thousands of Sosarias scattered across a
castle floor somewhere just waiting to be swept up by some fat maid and
thrown into the trash can. This was one of the last legacies of Mondain.
The other one was a secret spell he'd been perfecting. It would summon
forth the foulest evils imaginable. He called it Kewlio. This world is
overrun with his Kewlio spell. British seems to have gotten the thought
somewhere in his head that by defeating eight 'pkers of virtue' that something
will happen. By the way, the only reason he calls them 'pks of virtue' is
because each one lives close to a shrine of the virtues." Magnus stops
and looks at you. You look back at him. He says, "Well?" You reply, "well
waht?//" He answers, "Do you have any questions?"</P>
<P>     You say, "yeh...can i have ur balck plate plz..its kewl" Magnus
sighs and says, "Damn, it's going to be a long day."</P>
