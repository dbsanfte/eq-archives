<P>Sup dewds and dewdettes?,</P>

<P>As most of you know, the NGI pirates have been meeting nightly for
hunting expeditions. During one of the past few evenings, Geryn showed
me a small trick to get NPCs to say some funny stuff. You take a book
and change the name of the title. Then you give the book to the NPC and
they will say something like "Thou art giving me -book title-". You all
know that when you show me something like that I'm going to have fun
with it. So, at the suggestion of Geryn, here are the top ten things
heard from NPCs that particular evening. (Not all of these were written
by me.)</P>

<P>10. "Thou art giving me a wedgie? Thank thee but I do not need this."</P>

<P>9. "Thou art giving me a booger? Tis kind of thee but I don't want it."</P>

<P>8. "Thou art giving me a Spice Girls CD? I am not interested in this."</P>
<P>(I'll second that!)</P>

<P>7. "Thou art giving me 10000000000000000 gold? I have no use for this."</P>

<P>6. "Thou art giving me a spanking? Tis kind of thee but no."</P>

<P>5. "Thou art giving me one of Magnus' top ten lists. I do not want
this."   (Gee, thanks.)</P>

<P>4. "Thou art giving me a queasy feeling in my stomach."</P>

<P>3. "Thou art giving me some wild and crazy ideas about goats!!!"</P>

<P>2. "Thou art giving me pictures of Geryn in the nude? I do not want
this."</P>

<P>1. "Thou art giving me underwear from K-Mart? K-Mart sucks."</P>


<P>Call this one a mini top ten, written on a whim. I have one question
though for the newsgroup. Why hasn't Cyclone made any of the NGI pirate
meetings? I'm sure we two could have a laugh or two. </P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo,Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Adept Tank Mage who tried and tried and tried to give
away that 1000000000 gold</P>
