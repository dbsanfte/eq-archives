<P>Last night, Exodus and I were sitting in his tower reflecting upon
the all the good times in UO. We talked for a long time and then watched
as a grey wolf walked by. I jumped out of my chair and ran for the door.
'HEZ GREY!!1111', I yelled. Exodus, right behind me, said, "KEWL..LEZ
ROK HIM!"</P>
<P> We ran out of the tower. I went into war mode with my GM made
katana wearing my GM made shadow plate and attacked. Exodus cast reative
armor on me and fired two ebolts in rapid sucession at the wolf. The
battle, from "HEZ GREY!" to dead wolf, was less than 30 seconds.</P>
<P>Exodus walked over to the wolf and said, "U NOOBIE LAMER...U SUK".
I also walked over and said, "yeh..try not to suk so much when u come
back again...were bored". We walked back into the tower.</P>
<P>Then I realized it. Exodus and I are turning into dewds. We have a
tower full of loot that we'll never use. We have a room with runes to
anywhere we could ever want to recall. We've each got triple GM mages.
(Well Exodus does anyway, I'm within a point of having one.) He's got a
GM smith, I have a master smith. In short, we've got everything. I made
a comment about this to Exodus and he said, "Well, when in Rome..." </P>
<P>We talked more. What if there was a dewd inside everyone just
waiting to get out? What if embracing our inner dewd and accepting it
for what it is would bring true nirvana? (Not that fake Cobain stuff) We
should explore our dewdishness and not be ashamed or afraid. We should
embrace, not mock the concept of RooLing. We should learn to properly
conjugate the verb 'to rok'. We should always be on guard against the
dewds worst fear, 'sukin'.</P>
<P>We agreed that it was a noble goal, and one that we should persue
that very evening. Well, it sounded like a way to kill a few hours
anyway. How to accomplish such a feat? Could it be done? Was it
feasible? Was there any place we could get a true black dye tub?</P>
<P>Then Exodus was struck with an idea. Bank thieves. Neither of us in
our entire UO careers has ever played a white haired, white robed, fast
fingered, wacky caps thiefii bankis. (commonly known as 'bnak theeves')
A more brilliant idea there never was! Truly wonderful suggestion I
thought! And if I don't drop the Yoda school of sentence structure right
now, I might grow big ears and turn green.</P>
<P>We decided to go to the kewlest place we could think of. We wanted
to soak up as much of the kewl kulture as we possibly could. What better
place than the Britain bank? It was decided and thus was born my bank
thief, 'PooPeR SNooPeR' and Exodus' bank thief, 'EQ IZ DoWN'. </P>
<P>We appeared in Britain in our new form. I quickly sensed something
was wrong. Where were the white robes? I had assumed that a white death
robe was starting equipment when someone created a character with 50
stealing and 50 snooping. In character, I said, "thsi suz..wher r our
white robez?//" EQ IZ DoWN replied, "u dumazz...u haev 2 die b4 u get 1"
So to defend my honor, I shouted, "fuk u" and attacked him. EQ IZ DoWN
shouted, "guards bank vendor buy recsu recdu i will take thee
destination i ban thee". Sadly, PooPeR SNooPeR was slain by the gaurds.
EQ IZ DoWN laughed, "yeh tahts how u get a robe" and then "hehehe OOOoo
OOOoo OO OOo". Then, EQ IZ DoWN attacked the innkeeper who was standing
nearby and he joined me in death.</P> 
<P>We found our way to the healers and were brought back to life. And
what sight should meet my eyes? There were the two of us, with short
white hair and white robes. We looked like the real thing. It was so
beautiful, I almost cried then and there. I shared these feelings with
EQ IZ DoWN and was promptly told that I 'suked'. </P>
<P>Remembering to fear suking, I changed the subject. "lets go get sum
loot" I said. EQ IZ DoWN replied with a simple, "k". We began the
journey to the bank and discussed strategy at length.</P>

<P>PooPeR SNooPeR: we sould try 2 belnd in</P>
<P>EQ IZ DoWN: yeh jsut act naturla</P>
<P>PooPeR SNoopeR: k</P>

<P>I walked over to a crowd of people and tried to pretend I was
banking. I started typing, "vendor buy the bank some guards for my loot"
but before I could finish, everyone around me cleared the area. They
must have known I wasn't genuine because I didn't have my 'vendor
buy...' macroed. I finished typing and went around looking for more
victims. I found another group, walked over to them, and pressed enter.
My bank box appeared and I quickly closed it. "Ha, they're completely
unsuspecting!", I thought. EQ IZ DoWN was already at work. He was
chasing some guy named RoTo RooTeR around the bank. I was so proud when
I saw my screen fill up with "You see EQ IZ DoWN peeking into 's pack."</P>
<P>I remembered my task and brought up the paper doll of the still
unsuspecting player beside me. Freddy Krooger was his name. I double
clicked his pouch and to my surprise, it opened on the first try. I
waited, he said nothing. I opened my skill window and clicked
'Stealing'. The highlight cursor appeared and I was asked what item I
wanted to steal. I decided to try for the magic sword. I got a message
that I couldn't steal from him unless I joined a thieves guild. "WTF?",
sayeth I.</P>
<P>I decided to help EQ IZ DoWN chase RoTo RooTeR. By this time, the
crowd was wise to us and many yelled, "there newbies..jsut ingore
tehm..they cant steel from u". Major bummer! No one ran anymore. We
couldn't steal. Was there no outlet for our kewlishness? I tried a new
tactic. I walked up behind a Mr. IP Freely and said, "gimme ur gold or i
get my pk and rok u". He replied, "Kal Ort Por" and disappeared. I tried
again on a fellow named SEPHIROTH. "ur gold or ur life", I said. He
said, "my life". So I went into war mode and attacked. I was whacked
again by the guards and this time instarezzed. "u cheeter..ur afraid to
taek me one on one!!!!!!!!" He attacked me and killed me with one hit.
This time I ran to the healers and came back. </P>
<P>When I got back, I found that EQ IZ DoWN was doing better. He had
figured out how to get loot! "waht u do is wait 4 tehm 2 lay sumthingon
teh ground..tehn u pick it up", he whispered. I nodded and we went on
our crime spree. Not even the guards were wise to our tactics this time.
We stole items off the ground for almost an hour without anyone
suspecting us. </P>
<P>At the end of the evening, we sorted our loot: seven empty bags, a
magic gnarled staff, six 'a scrolls', two magic rings, an orc helm, and
an empty bottle to be exact. We laughed at the lamers who'd lost such
valuable loot. EQ IZ DoWN banked the valuables under advice from me.</P>
<P>We promptly told everyone around the bank that we were, in fact, da
bomb. We told them that we had single handedly had stolen everything
that was layed of the ground that evening. We said that if they felt
like quitting the game right then and there, we'd not blame them a bit.
As a matter of fact, they should have probably just gone ahead and
turned over all their house keys because we would have those in time as
well.</P>
<P>What's more important is that we felt the free flow of dewdishness.
We wallowed in it. We allowed ourselves to be covered with it and became
one with our inner dewds. It was self actualization. It was peak
experience. It was enlightenment. It was peace and harmony with nature.
It was some other psychology term that I have since forgotten. </P>
<P>So, a warning to you all: Avoid the Britain bank at all costs! PooPeR
SNooPeR and EQ IZ DoWN are ruthless. We have only seen the top of this
iceberg known as dewdishness and we intend to explore it fully. DA
BIRTAIN BNAK IS NEVR GONNA BE TEH SAME AGAINN!!!!!!!!!!!</P>
