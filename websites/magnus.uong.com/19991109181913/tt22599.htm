<P>Greetings,</P>

<P>     Why are college professors the absolute worst people in the world
as far as time management goes? It never fails, they start the quarter
off with grand intentions and by midterm time, they're weeks behind.
What's worse, they try and catch up in the last two weeks of the term.
(That's where I find myself now.) So, anyway, I have to become an expert
in time management because my professors aren't. Sorry about the ranting
but it's been a long busy week and next week's gonna be even busier. Oh
yeah, I better get a top ten in before somebody assigns something else.</P>
<P>_______________________________________________________________</P>
<P>     It's been a great year so far for us here at RUIN. (The Really
Useless Infomercials Network) We've had our staff of crack heads, uhm
crackhead staff, uhm crack team working on putting together our 1999
collection of Ultima Online products for you. Here's our top ten best
ads so far this year.</P>

have to be alone at this time. We know suicide can be a scary thing and
a big decision. You don't have to face things along. Call the suicide
help line at 1-800-KAA-BOOM and we'll send one of our agents out to meet
you with a trapped box. Our employees will hold your things while you
make sure that nasty blue pk scum gets the murder count he so sorely
deserves. For a small additional cost, we'll send a mage who will gate
you to a healer where you can carry out your suicide privately. Make the
call today, suicide's never an easy choice. Let us help you with your
next suicide.</P>

<P>6. Friends, I'm here to tell you about an exciting investment move that
economic advisers have identified as a good risk. As you know, the mana
drain spell has just gotten a huge push and manadrain uses the reagents
pearl, mandrake root, and spider silk. We see a huge shortage of
spidersilk in the near future and with just a 1000 gold investement in
the spidersilk industry, you could stand to earn 3000 gold! Imagine the
possibilites! The last time there was this much of a predicted shortage,
1000 gold returned 7000 gold! *Announcer begins reading at feverish
pace* Of course, past performance is not indicative of future results
but we included it just to make you send us some money you greedy
bastards. People can and do lose money. Like this time probably because
our guild really needs a new tower. *Announcer slows down again* Just
ask for IcEd T at the Britain bank and present him with your investment.</P>

<P>5. *Lovely violin music plays*</P>

duck with a practice sword.*</P>
<P>WELL THIS ISN'T THAT PLACE! SPEND A FUN FILLED WEEKEND ON THE ABYSS

<P>3. Better Homes and Addons has just finished with the article that's
sure to be the talk of 1999! One hundred and one floor plans for house
add ons! Would you believe that two training dummies, a forge, an anvil,
a loom, and a spinning wheel will fit into a house? Well they will! Our
article will show you dozens of ideas for increasing the utility for
house while maintaining the all important stack of bags in the corner
with all your loot. See our article in February's issue. (It's the one
with Papa Chop the nudist carpenter on the cover and the centerfold.)</P>

<P>2. At U S U K, we don't make the kryss, we make it faster. We don't make
the crossbow, we make it deadlier. We don't make the heater shield, we
make it stronger. We don't make the pig, we make it flamestrike. We
don't make the coconut, we make it funnier. We don't make the dungeon,
we make it fishable. At U S U K, we don't make a lot of the products that you use,
we make a lot of those products better. U S U K.</P>
