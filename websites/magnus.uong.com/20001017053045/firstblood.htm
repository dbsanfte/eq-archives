color="#FF0000" size="5">First Blood</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">WetCondom has just learned of the
imporatance of his mission and also the names of his foes.
Wearing the 'Trueblack Jester Tunic of the Avatar'©, WetCondom
again walks the streets of Britain, searching for clues from the
peasants that may lead him to a confrontation with the PKs.</font></p>

<hr>

<p align="left"><font size="3">You walk through Britain much more
sure of yourself now that you wear the symbol of the avatar. The
jester tunic fits surprisingly well over your bone armor and even
allows you enough flexibility to fire a crossbow. (The latter
fact being discovered as a bird paused on a window sill shortly
before becoming feathers for new avatar arrows.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">As you walk past the residential
section of Britain, (Yeah, I didn't know there was one either.) a
peasant woman, dressed in a revealing one piece leather teddy and
thigh high boots steps out from her front door and runs in your
direction. You notice that she has blue hair. &quot;Oh praise
Garriot! The avatar has returned!&quot; she says. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">You're shocked at such a reaction
from a member of the female sex and ask the only question that
you can think of, &quot;hey r u a girl in reel life?//&quot; She
answers, &quot;no i wuz jsut rping cuz thye told me i have 2...im
sposed 2 give u a quest 2 complete and tehn give u info on wher
teh first pk is but i reelly gotta clean my room and macro some
resist so i dont haev time..wood u mind if i jsut told u wher teh
pk is and skip all taht other siht?//&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Having been in the same situation
as the peasant before you, and wanting to speed through this game
as quickly as possible, you happily agree. &quot;kewl...i owe u
one&quot;, says the woman. &quot;k....teh leader of teh 8 pks has
sent Therin Darkheart after u...therins favorite place 2 try and
pk is on teh road not far from Britain...im not sposed 2 tell u
thsi so keep this next part between u and me..k?&quot;, she asks.
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">You nod and she continues, &quot;Therin
is teh weakest of teh pks mainly cuz he tries 2 rp wehn he fights...anyone
could beat him without truble.&quot; &quot;if hes so week how did
become one of teh 8 pks of virtue///&quot; you inquire. The
peasant lady replies, &quot;i think hes teh little borther of one
of teh leed designers or sumthing....i think l33t h4ck4h jsut
sent him cuz hes tired of all the rp bs...beware tho...teh other
pks r tougher...and thats all i have 2 say about that&quot; And
without another word, she recalls away.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Excited about this new information,
you head for the city limits and begin searching for the first of
the 8 pks. After a few minutes walking down a deserted road, a
man steps in front of your path. He is dressed in green clothing
and on his head is a feathered cap. He holds a dagger in his
right hand. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The man speaks, &quot;By the 'Trueblack
Jester Tunic of the Avatar'© that thou dost wear, I doth
conclude that thou art the Avatar of my most hated enemy Lord
British. Therefore, thou art the one that I have instructions to
slay. My master shall be plea....&quot; You interrupt, &quot;r u
therin darkheart?&quot; He replies, &quot;Aye, I see that thou
hast heard of me. Prithee I hope thou hast also of the notoriety
which I have gained by being a skilled assassin!&quot; You say,
&quot;no actualy i herd taht u suk LOL&quot; Therin retorts,
&quot;Indeed, I have sucked the life from many unsuspecting
victims.&quot; At this comment, you laugh, &quot;hahah ur a dum
ass 2&quot; Therin's face *flushes red*. He holds the dagger high
in one hand and shouts, &quot;Oh thou hast insulted me now, no
one doth insult me and not pay the penalty. Thou shalt feel the
cold steel of my dagger!&quot; This brings a burst of
uncontrollable burst of laughter from you, &quot;LOL....WTF?? a
dagger..ur lame&quot; Therin, even more angry with *fire flashing
in his eyes*, says, &quot;Thou dost doubt my skill? When we doth
clash, thou shalt be the one to fall. I shall spit on thy corpse
and throw it to the wolves. &quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Therin continues his tirade and
you quickly grow bored of it. You pull out your trusty
exceptional heavy crossbow and aim it at Therin. You squeeze the
trigger and watch the arrow fly straight into his chest. He
staggers a bit and continues talking, &quot;Hah! Dost thou think
that I shall be stopped so easily? Nay, there is still fight
within me...&quot;, he continues as you pull up his health bar
and see no blue on it at all. One more arrow should do it. You
ready your crossbow as Therin continues, &quot;....Ah, you fear
my resolve, eh? Thou dids't not expect my constitution to be so
strong eh? Feelings of doubt are permeating thy..&quot; *THUNK*
Another arrow pierces Therin and he slumps over dead.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">&quot;kick ass&quot;, you say and
go over to loot Therin for the sacred 'kewl' reagent that he
carries. Among his possessions, he has only a few things. A
feathered hat, some clothes, his 'infamous' dagger, some kindling,
a bedroll, a loaf of bread, and a bottle of ale. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">You're not sure which is the kewl
reagent, so you take all his belongings and leave him lying naked
on the side of the road. You find a vendor selling a rune to
British's castle and recall into the throne room. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">This time, British is pacing with
a comm crystal in his hand. &quot;look thorny...im really sorry i
missed ur birthday....but its been busy heer thsi week and i jsut
4got&quot; The comm crystal replies, the person on the other end
of it is obviously crying, &quot;*SNIFF* u always 4get....maybe
thsi whole relationship is a bad idea&quot; British interrupts,
&quot;dont day taht thorny...u kno i dont want taht....besides i
still have 2 give u ur gift...ill tell u waht it is since i
missed ur birthday&quot; The comm crystal answers, &quot;*sniff*
k *sniff*&quot;. British replies, &quot;its the star trek chess
set u haev been wanting..the special limited edition nude version&quot;
The voice coming from the comm crystal now sounds excited, &quot;Ooooooh
u didnt!!!...jsut waht i wanted.....british u r teh gratest.&quot;
British smiles and turns and suddenly sees you, &quot;thorny i
gotta go...wetcondom's heer&quot; The comm crystal says, &quot;waht
are u...&quot; but British quickly turns it off. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">He walks over to you and says,
&quot;sup wetcondom&quot;. You say proudly, &quot;i haev killed
teh first pk...heer was waht he had&quot; and you lay his
possessions on a nearby table. British quickly picks the
feathered cap and says, &quot;thsi is it....ive never seen one of
these before...congrats WC....u rool!11...lste hope the other pks
fall as quickly&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Meanwhile..... (cue sinister music
with lots of drums and bass)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The scene shifts again to the
tower. l33t h4ck4h is on the roof sparring with a trapped polar
bear. Suddenly, minerz suk bursts up the stairs. &quot;l33t!
Therin got his ass roked and british has teh fethered hat...waht
r we gonna do?&quot; l33t turns and says, &quot;so teh rper is
ded huh?//...now i see that thsi wetcondom lamer is serious....minerz
suk...i want u 2 go and face him....bring me his head&quot;
minerz suk looks nervously at his leader and says, &quot;but l33t..u
kno i cant fight someone whos not mining and overloaded with ore
and has no weapon skills and is not expecting me and and and and
i cant kill the avatar!1111&quot; l33t says, &quot;well tehn u
haev a choice....u fite teh avatar or u fight me....i jsut
sparred my str up to 650....LOL&quot; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">minerz suk swallows hard and
recalls away.</font></p>

WetCondom. It might be finished before UO2 gets here.</p>
