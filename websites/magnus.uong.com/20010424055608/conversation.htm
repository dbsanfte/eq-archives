<H1 align="center">A Funny Conversation</H1>
<P>Exodus and I were checking out the vendors north of Vesper when a
player ran up to us dressed in long pants, a fancy shirt, and an orc
helm. (Newbie look) The following conversation took place. (This isn't a
journal excerpt, it's from memory.)</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Magnus: Exodus, this vendor has hair dye.</P>
<P>*Newbie guy runs over to Exodus*</P>
<P>Newbie: exodus!!</P>
<P>Exodus: yah?</P>
<P>Newbie: do</P>
<P>Newbie: u</P>
<P>Newbie: know</P>
<P>Newbie: where</P>
<P>Newbie: i can<P>
<P>Newbie: get a</P>
<P>Newbie: kick ass</P>
<P>Newbie: xbow</P>
<P>Newbie: ?</P>
<P>Exodus: nope, try asking at the bank</P>
<P>Newbie: magnus!</P>
<P>Magnus: yes?</P>
<P>Newbie: do</P>
<P>Newbie: u</P>
<P>Newbie: know</P>
<P>Newbie: where</P>
<P>Newbie: i can</P>
<P>Newbie: get a</P>
<P>Newbie: kick ass</P>
<P>Newbie: xbow</P>
<P>Newbie: ?</P>
<P>Magnus: No</P>
<P>Magnus: try</P>
<P>Magnus: asking</P>
<P>Magnus: at</P>
<P>Magnus: the</P>
<P>Magnus: bank</P>
<P>Exodus: heh</P>
<P>Newbie: fuk u!</P>
<P>*Newbie runs off*</P>
<P>*Exodus and Magnus chuckle and continue to shop*</P>
<P>A few minutes later, newbie comes back with 'back up'. His buddy that
he's brought back has a bone tunic, no pants, and a practice longsword.
I'll call him BUDDY. A quick check with anatomy and evaluating
intelligence showed them both to be newbie characters.</P>

<P>Newbie: u think ur so hot...say something now asshole!</P>
<P>Magnus: Like what?</P>
<P>Newbie: liek how its gonna feel when we kick ur tank mage asses (We have
tank mage in our guild titles.)</P>
<P>Newbie: WTF is a tank mage anyway???</P>
<P>Exodus: I'm not a mage. (It's an inside joke. Someone SPAMS him for a
gate, reagent handouts, he tells them he's not a mage and summons a
daemon.)</P>
<P>BUDDY: what???</P>
<P>Exodus: It's true. I only have 3.6 magery.</P>
<P>Newbie: why does ur title say tank mage?</P>
<P>Magnus: That's just to scare people. I'm really a grandmaster herder and
a master chef.</P>
<P>Exodus: And I'm a grandmaster beggar. Watch this.</P>
<P>Exodus: Spare some platemail friend?</P>
<P>Newbie: so you guys don't fight?</P>
<P>Magnus: Heavens no! I spend so much time baking that I don't have time
to fight. I make so much money at it, that I've got five castles, each
one dedicated to a major food group.</P>
<P>Exodus: Yes, and I also have several castles. I keep mine filled with
llamas.</P>
<P>BUDDY: cool! can we see them?</P>
<P>Magnus: Oh, I'm afraid not. My houses are a mess. There's flour all over
the place.</P>
<P>Exodus: And you wouldn't believe the smell that 40 trapped llamas can
produce!</P>

<P>At this point, I'm getting lots of ICQ messages from Exodus about how
funny this is and other things we can tell them. Someone else walks up
(Kewl Guy) and starts watching our conversation.</P>

<P>Magnus: Exodus. We must take our leave. I have a cake in the oven which
I must attend to.</P>
<P>*We walk off the screen and each of us summons a daemon and walk back
with the daemons following us*</P>
<P>Newbie: u liars! u r mages!</P>
<P>Magnus: No! We bought these from a vendor up the street. They were only
5 gold apiece!</P>
<P>BUDDY: Whoa! let's go check it out!</P>
<P>*Newbie and BUDDY run off leaving Magnus, Exodus, and Kewl Guy*</P>
<P>Kewl Guy: u guys r rad! can i join ur guild?</P>
<P>Magnus: Hmmm, we're pretty strict. Can you swim?</P>
<P>Kewl Guy: yes</P>
<P>Magnus: Ok, swim across the river here and back.</P>
<P>Exodus: Don't forget Magnus, he has to do it with a ham under each
armpit.</P>
<P>Exodus: In Mani Ylem</P>
<P>Magnus: In Mani Ylem</P>
<P>*Kewl Guy picks up ham*</P>
<P>Kewl Guy: u guys suk!</P> 
<P>*Kewl Guy runs off*</P>
 
<P>Newbies are pretty fun aren't they?</P>

<P>Semi-roleplayin' Grandmaster Tank Mage - Master Deciever of Newbies
(Only in non-harmful ways, I assure you.)</P>
