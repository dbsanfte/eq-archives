<P>Sup and well met!,</P>

<P>Well, I've got one final exam down, two to go. Forgive me, if the list
uh.. sucks this evening. I've been macroing calulus and I'm afraid my
top ten skill may have gone down. I haven't done a 'top ten things that
bug me' lately so here goes.</P>

<P>10. *Magnus is walking through the Brittanian wilderness*</P>
<P>You see: A brick house (reminds me of a song)</P>
<P>You see: An orc</P>
<P>You see: An ogre</P>
<P>You see: An ettin</P>
<P>You see: A blood elemental</P>
<P>You see: A water elemental</P>
<P>You see: An orc mage</P>
<P>You see: A troll </P>
<P>.</P>
<p>.</P>
<P>.</P>
<P>You see: A brass sign - "Kewl guy's personal dungeon"</P>

<P>It seems the rumor was untrue. There was not one new dungeon planned,
but hundreds. They have yet to name them all but here are some of the
considered names: Stupidity, Greed, KeWLnEsS, Spawn Killer,....
Suggestions are welcome.</P>

<P>9. *Magnus and Exodus hide themselves close to Covetous*</P>
<P>*Two dread lords walk up*</P>
<P>You see: The Dread Lord Jakof</P>
<P>You see: The Dread Lord Fukof (Russian players maybe?)</P>
<P>Jakof: i jsut love pvp - its challnging</P>
<P>Fukof: yeh - nothing like a good challenge</P>
<P>You see: Newbie</P>
<P>Jakof: Corp Por</P>
<P>Fukof: taste the wrath of the chaos god fukof and his Xbow of force</P>
<P>You see: a corpse of Newbie</P>
<P>Exodus: NOW! (Exodus is a master tank mage and the proud owner of a
halberd of nuclear destruction.)</P>
<P>Magnus: Die murderers! (Magnus is a master tank mage and posseses the
useful ability to fire at least four energy bolts before
stopping to wait on mana.)</P>
<P>Fukof: Kal Ort Por</P>
<P>Jakof: Kal Ort Por</P>

<P>They wanted a challenging fight and there Exodus and I were to oblige
them and they turn it down. They seemed perfectly happy as long as it
was just wooden shields and practice weapons they had to worry about. </P>

<P>8. Speaking of anti-pk groups, I have a gripe with those too. My friends
with whom I've been going along with are very experienced at player
versus player combat and have given me a lot of useful tips but....</P>
<P>Have you ever been PK hunting with a 'mob'? </P>
<P>*Magnus is standing at Vesper Bank*</P>
<P>You see: The Great Lord Newbie Killer (Order Guard)</P>
<P>You see: The Great Lord Rat Killer (Chaos Guard)</P>
<P>You see: Lady drool </P>
<P>You see: The Noble Lady warslut</P>
<P>You see: MegaDeth (In 'deth' robe)</P>
<P>MegaDeth: PK'S AT X ROADS</P>
<P>drool: let's get em</P>
<P>All: OK </P>
<P>Rat Killer: i have ruin (What's the problem with 'ruin' and 'rune'?)</P>
<P>Rat Killer: but we;ll have to walk a little </P>
<P>*Rat Killer drops ruin*  ;)</P>
<P>All: Kal Ort Por</P>
<P>You see: a deer</P>
<P>You see: Rat Killer attacking a deer</P>
<P>You see: drool attacking a deer</P>
<P>You see: Newbie Killer attacking Rat Killer</P>
<P>Rat Killer: WTF?? don;t attack me shithead</P>
<P>Newbie Killer: we are at war - die chaos scum! (an attempt to roleplay?)</P>
<P>Rat Killer: that's it *&^%er  i;m going to get my pk char. </P>
<P>drool: who took leather?</P>
<P>warslut: you bastards looted my kill!</P>
<P>You see: Someone got an 'F' in kindergarten for Paying Attention</P>

<P>What we have here are four serious cases of ASDD (Attention Span Deficit
Disorder). Sometimes the stupidity rampant in Ultima On-Line washes over
me like a deluge and it takes everything in me to keep from uttering the
phrase, "this sux"</P> 

<P>7. SpoiledBrat: u guys know where i can find out the dupe bug</P>
<P>Magnus: Sure, what you do is press that help button and call a GM for a
Bug Report. When the GM shows up, tell him you need the dupe bug and
he'll give you the Bug Report with all the known bugs on it.</P>

<P>6. One thing I've noticed is that role-playing completely blows people's
minds. Take my pirate character for instance.</P>
<P>pOwErBoMb: hey long john!</P>
<P>Long John Magnus: Arr, what ye want?</P>
<P>pOwErBoMb: what moongate is this</P>
<P>Long John Magnus: This be the town o' Skara Brae, not a bad place fer a
pirate.</P>
<P>pOwErBoMb: cool! r u a pirate</P>
<P>pOwErBoMb: ? (As if I could not have figured out that the above
statement was a question.)</P>
<P>Long John Magnus: Aye matey! Are ye a pirate too?</A>
<P>pOwErBoMb: nope   why r u here</P>
<P>Long John Magnus: When me mates show up, we set sail.</P>
<P>pOwErBoMb: r u part of a quest</P>
<P>Long John Magnus: Aye lad, there's buried gold out there and we aim ta
lay claim to it.</P>
<P>pOwErBoMb: do u work for OSI?</P>
<P>Long John Magnus: Who's OSI? I work no one but myself.</P>
<P>pOwErBoMb: OSI is the company that made the game dumbass! god! u r a
moron</P>
<P>Long John Magnus: If ye cherish yer ears, ye'd shut yer trap!</P>
<P>pOwErBoMb: u suck!</P>

<P>Sigh.... To quote Scar from the Lion King, "I'm surrounded by idiots!"</P>

<P>5. While I am on the subject of idiots, I saw a vendor last week with 10
individual keys in his pack. *Each* one was labled, "This is my house
key, buy it if you can! Hehehehehhehehe! Cost: 1000" I first thought,
"Who's gonna fall for this?", but I saw someone at the bank a day or two
later complaining that they bought a blank key off of a vendor for 1000
GP. I guess that proves that after they get through scraping the bottom
of the barrel for brains, they apparently can lift up the barrel and
find a few more underneath.</P>

<P>4. How about another list of those odd names?</P>
<P>DonkeyShlong (Hmm, an odd obsession. What would Freud say about this? Probably that the guy wants to sleep with his mom, knowing Freud.)</P>
<P>AzzKickA     (Scary! He's gonna kick my azz.)</P>
<P>Testacles    (Not only offensive but spelled incorrectly also. I may be
mistaken though, the name could be Greek.  test-a-cleez?) </P>
<P>Corp Por</P>      
<P>doodoo       (Yes, I really saw this. =^o)</P>
<P>MaRiLyN MaNsOn (Not only an annoying 'music' group. A dread lord too!)</P>

<P>3. Hawkwind: Hail Magnus!</P>
<P>Magnus: Hail!</P>
<P>Hawkwind: Do you think you might be able to help me?</P>
<P>Magnus: If you are not here to beg for items, I might assist you. </P>
<P>Hawkwind: Oh no! Due to the recent number of breakins, I need a way to
deter thieves. Could you cast Magic Trap on this box.</P>
<P>Magnus: Sure, hand it over. </P>
<P>*Magnus smiles*</P>
<P>Magnus: Now, I know and you know magic trap does minimal damage at best.
We also know that magic trap is only a third level spell and most
citizens have enough skill in magery to cast third circle magic. Also
given the fact that magic trap is illegal and calls the guards, I'd say
you just lost a box and whatever's in it. Have a nice day. </P>
<P>Hawkwind: you rat bastard! suk my dick!</P>

<P>Yet another example of someone so pathetic that they resort to (what I
would call) a programming flaw to take other people's items.</P>

<P>2. You are already casting a spell!</P>
<P>You are already casting a spell!</P>
<P>You are already casting a spell!</P>
<P>You are already casting a spell!</P>
<P>You are already casting a spell!</P>

<P>I really hate the spell bug, but I can't think of anything funny to say
about it. Can I still put it here? </P>

<P>1. See if you can guess who this is.</P>
<P>I GRANDMASTER PK HUNTER!!! </P>
<P>STAT LOSS FOR PKERS IS UNLOGICAL!!</P>
<P>i've killed over 180 dreads</P>
<P>i'm posting the breakin bug so origin will fix it faster</P>

<P>Yes, that's right! He's the same poster who came up with the brilliant
idea that if you write long and thought out posts, you are a nerd. He
has also been known to say that we shouldn't use the stuff he writes to
argue against him. (Innocent by reason of stupidity?) I guess we are
supposed to use a farmer's almanac or a cookbook to argue against him. (You're wrong because Betty Crocker says so!)
But that's not all! He also tells me that I am a retard and often claims to be my
father. Such insight and mastery of the text medium, all rolled into
one! </P>


<P>How'd I do this week? If I'm lucky, I'll get as many responses as
Cyclone did for his GOLD BUG thread. There, I mentioned you Cyclone. =-)</P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo,Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Master Tank Mage who now returns to real life =(</P>
