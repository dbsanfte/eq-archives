<P>Hello friends,</P>

<P>     I stand here (ok, I'm sitting sue me! Kidding Jag.) with another
top ten list for your scrutiny. Here it is UNCENSORED, UNEDITED,
UNSPELLCHECKED!!!! Oh yeah, the subject. Origin has just finished with
the housing and weapons patches and the reputation patch has been in
place for some time now. The next major project? Make every possible
effort to satisfy the KeWLiOz a.k.a. PrOjEkT PiMpIn' PaTcH!!!111111111</P>

<P>Dear Customers,</P>

<P>     We feel it is time to reach out to a group of players that has long
been neglected by our development team. The self named kewl DooDz of
Ultima. This group of players has had to adapt after we fixed bug after
bug. They were torn as we fixed methods of blue PKing. (Don't worry,
we'll leave some in.) They have to download a new copy of UOE every
other month for pete's sake! This group of players has suffered
mightily! We now have plans to right some of the wrongs we have commited
against the doodz. We now have planned more sweeping changes to Ultima
Online that will make it once again a place where keWL dOOdZ can thrive
like cockroaches. This is PrOjEkT PiMpIn' PaTcH!!!!!111111</P>

<P>10. Saying 'vendor buy bank guards' will transfer the shopkeeper's
inventory into your bank box. The speaker will also be given guard
powers for 10 minutes afterwards.</P>

<P>9. Skill changes</P>
<P>As was suggested by Silencer of rec.games.computer.ultima.online pimping
will become a true skill. With a mini patch coming soon 'bitches' will
be going into the game. Pimps in UO will be able to gather bitches just
as a herder might gather sheep. In order to pimp a 'bitch' open your
skill menu and choose Pimping. A targetting cursor will appear and you
will then target the bitch you wish to pimp. If your pimping skill is
high enough, the bitch is pimped and will then respond to the following
commands.</P>

<P>'Follow me'</P>
<P>'Suck it'</P>
<P>'Pay up'</P>
<P>'Lay down'</P>
<P>'Stay'</P>

<P>Pimps will also be able to take pimped bitches and remove their clothes
using the bitch's paper doll.</P>
<P>Grandmaster pimps will be able to get all the bitches they want and will
be given large necklaces and rings with dollar signs on them. As a
special bonus, grandmaster pimps will be able to remove the bra and
panties from the paper dolls of pimped bitches as well! KeWL DOodS
strain your imaginations no longer!</P>

<P>'Bitches' are rated on 'bitchiness'. The bitchier the bitch, the higher
your pimping skill must be to successfully pimp. Only by pimping
bitchier bitches can you gain skill.</P>

<P>8. Clothing changes</P>

<P>-The underwear on the characters is being replaced with boxer shorts.</P>

<P>-Fancy pants will become very baggy and will sag somewhere between the
knees and the top of the boxers.</P>

<P>We are working deals with some companies to get famous logos on the
armor and clothes. In works are...</P>

<P>-A whole line of Tommy Gear fancy shirts</P>
<P>-Reebok Leather boots</P>
<P>-Plate Armor decorated with Nike swooshes</P>
<P>-Stone Cold T shirts!!!</P>

<P>Note: All name brand clothing will cost at least as much as a small ship
deed. Anyone not wearing the name brand clothing will be opening
themselves up for insults, and taunts from NPCs.</P>

<P>7. Cartographers will soon be able to craft their own spawn points.
These spawn points will produce any type of monster in the game. They
can be place in houses and turned on and off at whim. The monsters will
carry loot just like the real dungeon monsters.</P>

<P>6. Language server </P>
<P>We are adding dewdish to the language server so dooDZ can understand
what the NPCs and other players are saying. For instance:</P>

<P>-"Thou art a ruffian." will become "ur a punk ass bitch!" (Too many
doodz thought ruffian was a brand of condem and took the remark as a
compliment.)</P>

<P>-"Greetings friend! How are you faring in your endeavors today?" becomes
'sup dude?'</P>

<P>-"Kal Ort Por" becomes "ha! u didnt pk me today!"</P>

<P>-"I shall rip thee from the navel to the chops and have thy head as a
trophy!" becomes "ill rok ur ass and collect the bounty".</P>

<P>-"Guards! Help! A thief!" becomes "vendor buy bank guards".</P>

<P>-"Hello vendor. I'd like to purchase some items from you." becomes
"vendor buy bank guards".</P>

<P>-"I'd like to deposit this in the bank." becomes "vendor buy bank
guards".</P>

<P>-"I believe I shall tempt my fate and test my blade in one of the
mysterious dungeons of our land." becomes "ltes get some fethers from
harpies in covetus got ruin?"</P>

<P>-"Ha! Tis but a scratch. You do not wield thy weapon well!" becomes
"hehe ur swords suck!"</P>

<P>-"Oh Tis a foul day indeed!" becomes "thsi lag bites".</P>

<P>-"There's nothing I can do." becomes "ur fuked dude".</P>

<P>-"Greetings traveller. Hand over your valuables now or I shall remove
them from your fallen corpse." becomes  "Corp Por".</P>

<P>5. We're giving away true black dye tubs for Christmas!</P>

<P>4. The combat system is getting a new addition.</P>
<P>To complement the new pimping skill and all the doodz out there who
think they are drug lords, the new combat skill will be gunmanship.
Gunmaking will be introduced and it will be similar to bowyering. There
will be three categories of guns: pistols, shotguns, and rifles  Since
we are concerned with realism, guns will do damage comparable to real
guns. Expect to be able to do up to 500 points of damage with a GM made
exceptional sniper rifles. A double barrled saw off shot gun of
vanquishing will kill a blood elemental in one shot. This change should
help all the dOODZ out there who have to use crates and blade spirits
daemons and dragons.</P>

<P>3. For all the players out there who think they are drug lords, now they
really can be. The reagents are going to become drugs and therefore be
illegal in certain cities. Guards will kill anyone caught with them. All
the fields in the game will now sprout reagents/drugs.</P>

<P>2. Running around town saying "Destination" will now raise karma.</P>

<P>1. To further the involvment of doodz in the quests and storylines of
Ultima, we are adding doodz only quest nights. Some upcoming dood
quests....</P>

<P>-"theres a quake tournament in britsihs castle...all dooodz invited!"</P>

<P>-"LB needs the URLs of bug sites! he's giving free gold to first 500 who
tell him one!"</P>

<P>-"newbies invading covetous! hurry tank thieves!"</P>

<P>-"bigg ass reagent spawn in vesper mage shop! hurry for best selection
and deals!"</P>

<P>-"stone cold is on tv now! log out and watch it!"</p>

<P>     Also, since the last group to try and end the world was the FoA
(Basically RPers) the next group to be featured in our story will be a
group of doodz. They will be called the Asskickas Of Legend or AOL for
short. Their goal is to crash the servers as often as possible.</P>

<P>We will be adding these changes in over the next few weeks. DooDz
everywhere rejoice!</P>

<P>Regards,</P>
<P>OSI Development Team</P>

<P>     I can safely say that this is the last top ten of 1998. I hope you
enjoyed this one as well as all of the ones from this past year. When I
did the first back in February, I thought that would be the only one. I
had no idea I'd be doing them this long. I wonder if I'll be doing them
this time next year. Only time will tell.</P>
<P>Happy New Year everybody!</P>

year 2000 compliant</P>
