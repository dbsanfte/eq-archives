<P>Hail to theez,</P>

<P>    Well, I will admit that I spent a lot of time sitting not doing
anything but waiting to play EQ this weekend. So here's a top ten list
of things that I did while waiting.</P>

<P>10. Clicked that useless middle button on my 3 button mouse as fast as I
could.</P>

<P>9. Found out what day my birthday will fall on in 3000.</P>

<P>8. Tried to connect and talked to the monitor. "Oh come on!"</P>

<P>7. Finally got in, then the phone rang. Ignored it.</P>

<P>6. Defragged my hard drive 11 times.</P>

<P>5. Downloaded the Vanilla Ice vs. Hanson theme for Microsoft Plus!</P>

<P>4. Picked the lint out of my pockets and dropped it on the back of my
sleeping cat.</P>

<P>3. Played UO and pretended it was 3d.</P>

<P>2. Practiced my signature.</P>

<P>1. Checked out elf girl some more.</P>

<P>     Oh well, tomorrow is another day. Maybe then, we'll get to play.</P>
