<P>If you are eating or drinking, stop immediately. I am *extremely*
proud of this post. Historically, when I am this proud of something, I
get E-mail about owing people money for new monitors and keyboards that
are soaked with various beverages. You've been warned.</P>

<P>Twas The Night Before Christmas: UO Style</P>

<P>'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house</P>
<P>Not a keyboard was clicking, not even a mouse;</P>
<P>The regs were all placed behind the walls with care,</P>
<P>In hopes that no one would think to look over there; </P>

<P>The kewl doodz were nestled all snug in their beds,</P>
<P>While in the land of Brittannia they macroed their reds;</P>
<P>I was checking my box for my new black plate,</P>
<P>I'd just logged in, although it was late.</P>

<P>When from in front of my house there came such a noise,</P>
<P>I tracked and saw that it was Big Dick and his boyz.</P>
<P>To the front of the house I ran to the door,</P>
<P>Checked it three times and put flour bags on the floor. </P>

<P>You see, Dick and his boyz were well known to me,</P>
<P>They stole and they looted and used UOE.</P>
<P>They PKed and swore and insulted poor saps,</P>
<P>They duped and they cheated and used wAcKy CaPs, </P>

<P>Suddenly I saw them, their walk was so quick,</P>
<P>I knew in a moment it must be Big Dick.</P>
<P>Using fastwalk features they flew on the screen,</P>
<P>They saw me there waiting and converged on the scene;</P>

<P>"i think thsi guy needs his ass roked</P> 
<P>we'll get past the door even tho its locked</P>
<P>to the back of the house thers no GMs to call!</P>
<P>now watch carefuly there'll be no more wall" </P>

<P>I watched in horror as they walked to the back,</P>
<P>I began placing all my treasure chests in my pack,</P>
<P>In vain it was as I struggled alone,</P>
<P>I could only pick up and hold 300 stone.</P>

<P>And then, with a gasp, I now became scared</P>
<P>What now was mine was soon to be theirs.</P>
<P>As I stood there alone to face my fate,</P>
<P>Dick stepped through the wall and said, 'ur 2 late'. </P>

<P>He was dressed all in bone, from his foot to his head,</P>
<P>He laughed when he saw me, "hehe ur dead!";</P>
<P>His bone outfit was trimmed with true black,</P>
<P>I stood overloaded as he began snooping my pack. </P>

<P>His eyes -- They were beady. His hair was bright pink.</P>
<P>I stood there helpless, too frightened to think.</P>
<P>His buddies were dressed exactly the same,</P>
<P>They peeked into boxes and made fun of my name;</P> 

<P>The guild title 'pimp' they proudly displayed,</P>
<P>'Please make them leave', I solemnly prayed;</P>
<P>They searched the whole house, they checked every box,</P>
<P>They cursed when they saw that all had locks. </P>
                                                                     
<P>Dick calmly said 'dont worry i stole his key',</P>
<P>'now breakinup boxes will be easy 4 me';</P>
<P>I smiled when I saw that the first on his list,</P>
<P>Was a box set to explode by my GM alchemist; </P>

<P>He said not a thing, but went straight to his chore,</P>
<P>He broke the trapped box and fell dead on the floor,</p>
<P>I laughed when I saw it and said, 'What a shame!',</P>
<P>Da Boyz were not happy and said, 'that wuz lame'; </P>

<P>They sprang to his corpse, and all began looting,</P>
<P>I pulled out my crossbow and then started shooting</P>
<P>And I said as I killed them with my weapon of force,</P>
<P>"This crossbow's a blast! It's prepatch of course!"</P>
