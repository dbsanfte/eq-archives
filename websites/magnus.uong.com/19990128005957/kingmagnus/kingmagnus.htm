<Center><P>On this day, with the aid of numerous NGI members, I took the throne of the Catskills shard.
British had not been seen in months and the people were asking for a new king. Who better than I? Well, that was Dundee's reasoning anyway.</P><IMG SRC="kingmag1.jpg">
<P>To make the event seem as 'official' as possible, many NGI members dressed as town criers and announced that a new king had been named.</P><IMG SRC="kingmag4.jpg">
<P>The event gathered a lot of people. A counselor and seer showed up, many debates raged, as well as a challenge to a duel for the throne of Britannia.</P>

<IMG SRC="kingmag5.jpg"><P>I was even showered with gifts.</P>
<P>Of course, with as many people gathered in one place as we had managed, there are bound to be a few morons in the crowd. I dealt with snoopers, thieves, and spammers. Beware, the following pictures contain INTENSE stupidity.</P>

<P>My thanks to all the nice people who showed up and especially all the NGI members who helped make this event great.</P></CENTER>
