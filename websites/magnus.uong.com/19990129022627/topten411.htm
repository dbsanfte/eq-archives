<P>Hail DeWdZ, (what time is it???)</P>

<P>The first newsgroup meeting was a big success. It was silly and we
didn't really get anything accomplished but I think we all had a good
time. That's what counts!! It was suggested to me that I write a top ten
list about tonight's party, soooooooooo here goes. Here are the top ten
things that happened at the party.</P>

<P>10. Straka and The Lord kRAD kept attacking the pirate who decided to
stand in the middle of the gathering and say, "I'm sorry I do not
understand thee." Of course, we were in the guard zone so they were
killed every attempt they made.</P>

<P>9. When they did attack, they insta rezzed and accused everyone of
looting them. Everyone started arguing over Straka's PhAt ReGZ! (not
ReAgS!!!)</P>

<P>8. Someone with a jester tunic got guard killed and items were taken out
and thrown back in the corpse. This caused the effect that makes the
item fly all the way to the top of the screen. Someone then accused God
of looting.</P>

<P>7. Lady Compassion was there. I met her at the Ironwood Inn and she
insisted that she be presentable before we went to Ocllo. We went to the
tailor shop and she bought some clothes. Then, (this is the best part)
we went out of the guard zone, *I* got to help her lower her notoriety
down to Dark Lady! *sigh* =^)</P>

<P>6. Lemure is quite a macro bard. He had a few songs prepared. Of course
he told us he was not a good poet and asked all of us to come up with a
word that rhymed with Venture.</P>

<P>5. I met and talked with Dennis Heffernan. He's a pretty nice guy in
person. I told him that my posts were all in fun and we did an emote
handshake. I also told him that I will continue to post jokes about him.
He said that was fine with him. You're a good sport Dennis. Maybe you
should write a top ten list about me some time, ya know, to get even.
=-)</P>

<P>4. the very special guest that everyone thought was coming didn't we all
sat and wondered when he would be there but everytime i gated back to
the inn he wasn't there i wonder where he went i think everyone was
upset because he didn't show they all wanted to see how he communicates
in ultima i guess    (I just can not resist the temptation to do that!)</P>

<P>3. I was surprised at the number of people that quoted items from my
previous top ten lists. Heck, some of you know them better than I do.
You guys must really like 'em. Thank you to everyone who complimented me
on the lists. (and the folks that told me my armor was kEwL)</P>

<P>2. I summoned a daemon named Fluffy at the request of a few people. </P>

<P>1. 90% of the people that came got drunk. Everytime we'd line up for a
picture, you'd see synchronized *hic*ing.</P>

<P>All in all, it was a great night. Thanks to everyone who came. Heck, my
mom even made an appearance. I wish I could remember all the names of
everyone who showed up, but everytime I hit all names, I couldn't see
anything but writing and corpses of Straka. Hopefully, the next meeting
will be a little more organized. =-)</P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo,Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Adept Tank Mage who thinks Ocllo has never had that
many newbies in it before.</P>
