<p>I was taking some time to browse through some bookshelves in
Vesper and I ran across this book. As far as I know the book is
still there if you want to check it out. It's in the reagent shop
just north of the bank. (Catskills shard)</p>

<p align="center">There's an ICQ number listed. Hmmm....</p>
