<P>Hail and wassup,</P>

<P>     It's been a few weeks now for me in EverQuest and I finally feel
that 'maybe' my newbieness is wearing off a bit. I feel qualified now to
write a post concerning signs that one is still a newbie. (ie Call other
people newbies) Here are the top ten signs you know you are still a
newbie in EverQuest.</P>

<P>10. You've not gotten to play yet because Killer666, Butthead,
Sexygoat69, Midol, Bitchinbarbie, and Everbreast all fail the name
filter.</P>

<P>9. You've been killed more by your guildmaster a la auto attack than by
all monsters in the game.</P>

<P>8. You regularly use the /shout channel for one or more of the
following:</P>
<P>Help!</P>
<P>age/sex/loc?<?P>
<P>LEVEL 2 BABY!!!</P>
<P>SOMEBODY GIVE ME FOOD!</P>
<P>Anyone got an extra weapon?</P>

<P>7. The most often seen phrase on your screen is one of the following.</P>
<P>You have been slain by a bat!</P>
<P>Returning to home point please wait.</P>
<P>Bullsheeyot has challenged you to a duel!</P>
<P>I will give you 1 copper per snake fang.</P>
<P>Try attacking something other than yourself. It's more productive.</P>

<P>6. Someone tells a joke and you say 'Hail Hail' rather than 'hehe'.</P>

<P>5. You've been killed in the last 48 hours because you were looking at
the sky.</P>

<P>4. Directions to town given in the /shout channel include your corpses
as landmarks.</P>

<P>3. You're still set on saving up for plate rather than getting leather
armor first.</P>

<P>2. You're on the lookout for the city of Freepot.</P>

<P>1. You think auctions for binding have something to do with wierd
cybersex. </P>

<P>     Hope you enjoyed.</P>
