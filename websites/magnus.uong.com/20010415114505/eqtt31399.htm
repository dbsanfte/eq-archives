</HEAD>
<P>Greetings newsgroupies,</P>

<P>     Thanks for all the warm welcomes I've recieved. I forgot to mention
that I've been writing top ten lists in the UO newsgroup for over a year
now. I hope to continue the tradition here. So, here's my very first EQ
top ten. The top ten reasons I'm buying EQ. (I must apologize if you're
expecting UO bashing, I only do that in the UO newsgroup.)</P>

<P>10. All the cheaters in Solitaire are driving me away.</P>

<P>9. I've finally given up all hope for a sequel to Sensible Soccer.</P>

<P>8. There's no PK switch in Quake.</P>

<P>7. I figure there's a better chance of meeting Lara Croft in EverQuest
than in MineSweeper.</P>

<P>6. Sewer Shark is never gonna go online. (Did Sega finally die?)</P>

<P>5. Pong has just lost its appeal after all these years.</P>

<P>4. EverQuest babes are hotter than the ones in UO.</P>

<P>3. I want to see if my old video card will start smoking before it dies.</P>

<P>2. After 57 sequels, the MegaMan series is getting a tad repetitive.</P>

<P>1. I played UO for a year and a half, but not once did I ever inhale.</P>

<P>     Could this be the start of something big? Time will tell.</P>
