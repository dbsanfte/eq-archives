<P>Well, I can't get into play so I'm gonna post. The box art for
this game has really caught my attention. It could be because of the obvious but
I'm going to pretend that it's not. What about an analysis? (Warning,
I'm only doing this because I am bored and dont have a clue where I'm
going with this.)</P>
<P>     On the cover, we have elf girl. She looks happy. Why shouldn't she
be? She gets to be the cover girl. Looking into the background, you see
snow covered mountains with the snow going all the way down to the
ground. I guess that means it's cold. Elf girl has got to be freezing! Wait!
She's got a jacket on. She should be alright. That 3d bit they did was a nice touch. I'm sure
the words 'target audience' were never mentioned by the marketing
department.</P>
<P>     We move to the inside cover and we have dome head. He's trying to
get covergirl off the cover and into the ass kicking that looks like is
about to happen. Looks like they need some need some help because their
pet dragon has just learned how to sit and he's not going anywhere.</P>
<P>     Next we have the half elf girl. She has a very young looking face.
I suppose that explains why she's only a B or C cup. (Target audience
could NOT have been a factor in this picture I tell you!) Anyway, she's
a musician. She's kind of hanging back probably because there's nothing
to provoke on to the two giant mean green things.</P>
<P>     Move your eyes up. Good, that's her head, now a little farther. To
the right we have the knight in shining armor. Mr. Knight works in a
hospital as evidenced by his tunic. He's pointing and swearing at big
green ears. He's prbably pissed bacause big green ears put those big
wings on his hat. I could be wrong though. He could be telling the big
guy that his pants split when he bent over to pick up those skeleton
people. </P>
<P>     Big green ears is expelling some kind of blue gas and it's not
agreeing with the skeleton people. Do skeletons have lungs to be
affected by poison gas? Apparently so. Big green ears is obviously
worried that he looks too much like Yoda (Only much much taller) and his
taking his frustrations out on the skeletons.</P>
<P>     Now we have the dwarves. They look like a father and son don't
they? Father tells son, "go git my shotgun". The son looks very pissed.
It's probably because he doesn't have any shoes or rmor. I wouldn't
pissed though. Worry is the first emotion I would think of when facing
a 12 foot tall mace wielding unjolly green giant. But that's just me.</P>
<P>     A little farther to the right and we have the white haired dark elf. She
really reminds me of Storm from the X-Men. Oh well, her pose looks like
she's saying, "Bring it on bitch!" They really are trying to draw out
the dewds aren't they?</P>
<P>    Facing off against Storm is ButtGirl the barbarian. Here we have
another pissed individual. (Is anyone happy in this game?) I think she's
mad because her leather armor is giving her a rash. The dark elf
probably made some comment about her hair not having body and then she
said something about dark elf's premature gray and well here they go. </P>
<P>     As for our pissed off ogre friend (or is he a troll?) the only
thing I can say is that his loin cloth looks awfully small for a
creature that size. It seems to be adequately performing it's job though. Now we know why he's
pissed.</P>
<P>     On to archer boy! He's reluctant to fire because arrows are
expensive. That's not even mentioning the fact that all that little arrow's
gonna do is make the big green guy notice him and right now green guy
hates the short people.</P>
<P>     And finally, we have the catapult people who look like they're
playing the piano. That brings us to the end. I hope you enjoyed this
guided tour.</P>
