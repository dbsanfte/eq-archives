<P>Hail,</P>

<P>     I just saw the repost from Davian about the alchemy changes. I've
already replied to that message with my thoughts on the gender swap
potion. I can't help it. I keep thinking up goofy stuff to say about
them. So, here's the top ten uses for the new gender swap potions.</P>

<P>10. Let the ladies avoid that 'time of the month'. </P>

<P>9. Let men avoid that time of the month too.</P>

<P>8. Let the kewl doodz know what it's like to kiss a girl. (Even if it is
their buddies.)</P>

<P>7. What better disguise to sneak into the ladies locker room?</P>

<P>6. Buy one get one free! (It's gotta be this way for obvious reasons.)</P>

<P>5. Gives an easy explaination to girlfriend\boyfriend as to whose
underwear that is.</P>

<P>4. CK 1 should start selling like crazy!</P>

<P>3. Spike the punch with it at the senior prom. Prom night was never so memorable!</P>

<P>2. Makes cloning yourself a lot easier.</P>

<P>1. Drink only half for interesting combinations!</P>

<P>Couldn't resist. =p</P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo,Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Grandmaster Tank Mage who could probably think up ten
more rather easily</P>
