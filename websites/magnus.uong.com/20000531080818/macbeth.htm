<H1 align="center">Macbeth: UO style</H1>
<P> I must say this post was inspired by the post retelling Lord of the
Rings in Ultima style. It got me to thinking about some Shakespearean
plays I've read and Macbeth seemed perfect for retelling. Even the names
are changed.  Before you is Act II Scene iii of the play just before
the murder of the King is being discovered. For more fun, get a copy of
the play and read it at the same time as this.</P>

<P>Cast:</P>
<P>MacDeth - general in the army - would do anything to be the king, even
turn pk</P>
<P>BANQUO - general in army - friend of MacDeth</P>
<P>Bitch o' Deth - MacDeth's wife</P>
<P>MacDuff Daddy - scottish noble - also an anti pker</P>
<P>Lummox - another noble</P>
<P>Dunkin - ded  king dude - probably an rper</P>
<P>Malcolm - son of ded king dude - definitely an rper</P>
<P>Donalbain - another son of ded king dude - another fukin' rper</P>

<P>The scene opens with morning approaching at Castle MacDeth. MacDuff
Daddy and Lummox have been chatting with the gate keeper about getting
drunk and trying to screw bitches.</P>

most may claim this argument for ours?</P>
<P>Donalbain: (whispering back): What should be spoken here, where our
fate, his in an auger hole, may ruch and sieze us? Let's away, our tears
are not yet brewed. (Bascially, they're gonna recall away because they
don't believe MacDeth's weak ass story and are afraid he'll try to PK
them next so he can be king.)</P>

<P>BANQUO: lets find somebody that know forensic eval and see what happened
