<H1 align="center">The Lake Superior Bear Parade</H1>
<P>On this night, a few of the NGI <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/bears/bear2.jpg">members</A> marched around Britannia with several tame bears following closely.
The night started in <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/bears/bear1.jpg">Skara Brae</A> where we planned our attack. In the mean time, I goofed around, got guard killed
and, cut up my own corpse. I took this <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/bears/bear4.jpg">shot</A> which I think is kinda funny. We decided Vesper would be the best place to start.
Off to the <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/bears/bear5.jpg">moongate</A>. After quite some time figuring out the moongates, many bad 'bear jokes', and six or seven bears popping out of one moongate
and taking off at full speed to the east, we all wound up at the right moongate all together. We crossed the <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/bears/bear6.jpg">bridge</A> into Vesper.
We were not greeted heartily. At the bank, we were blamed for all the lag on the entire server. We decided to try the <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/bears/bear7.jpg">Vesper Armory</A>,
but not before doing a <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/bears/bear3.jpg">bear pile</A> on Dundee. At the armory, we were cursed again. So, we decided to head to Covetous. On the way, I had my bears, Tank Mage and SemiRoleplayer attack an NPC beggar that we came across. He thought it was so funny that he made his 
own <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/bears/bear8.jpg">bear joke.</A> We arrived at <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/bears/bear9.jpg">Covetous</a> where I chased many a PKer off with my newbie dagger. I ended the night in <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/bears/bear10.jpg"> grand fashion</A>, the victim of a noto PKer.</P>
