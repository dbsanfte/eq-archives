<P>Throw yo hands in the air!,</P>

<P>     I have to say that I have really missed posting here. When I made
my decision to come back this morning, I got straight to work on a top
ten list for you. Here are the top ten new goals I have. (I'm rusty and
may take a little while to get warmed back up.)</P>

<P>10. Take a character named Bill Clinton and parade through Britain in my
underwear with tamed animals: a rabbit named LuvBunny, a goat named
Hillary, a chicken named Chik, and a kitty cat named Monica. All the
while chanting, "I did not have sexual relations with that woman!" and
run around the new lands mounting all the new animals. (Clinton jokes
haven't been banned from this group yet, have they?)</P>

<P>9. Fish the piece of potato chip out of my keyboard that I just dropped.</P>

<P>8. Create some celebrity characters:</P>
<P>Shirley MacLaine - Grandmaster Medium</P>
<P>Billy Graham - Grandmaster Beggar</P>
<P>Bill Clinton - Neophyte Evaluating Intelligence</P>
<P>Jerry Springer - Grandmaster in all combat skills</P>

<P>7. Become an ostrich farmer and sing Bolivian folks songs all day.</P>

<P>6. Make as many jokes as possible about kEwL dOOdz staring at the boobs
on the snake monsters and spider monsters.</P>

<P>a) "Heheh  BooBz RooL!"</P>
<P>b) There are many many one handed typing jokes I'm sure.</P>

<P>5. Make as many jokes as possible about OSI programmers staring at the
boobs on the snake monsters and spider monsters. </P>

<P>Let's think about this for a minute folks. Why do the snakes and spiders
have breasts? Snakes are reptiles. Spiders are arachnids. Reptiles don't
have mammary glands. Arachnids don't have mammary glands. If they did,
they'd be mammals. I can only think of a few reasons why the snakes and
spiders would have boobs. </P>

<P>a) The words target audience come to mind. </P>
<P>b) Overworked programmers who don't get out much</P>
<P>c) 13 year old programmers who don't get out much</P>
<P>d) Silicone implants</P>

<P>Dundee, do you know if UOTopless will be expanded to cover the new snake
and spider bosoms or does it only work with true mammals?</P>

<P>4. Play a round of croquet with the new Cyclops tribes. (I swear that
hammer looks like a mallet.)</P>

<P>3. Learn to speak Orcish and hang out with those wierdos in real life
who learn to speak Klingon.</P>

<P>2. Roleplay a Stonecold character on Lake Superior. I aspire to become
the very first PK grandmaster wrestler and that's the bottom line! Or
something like that.</P>

<P>1. Constantly do my ASCII drawings in the new chat rooms.</P>
<P>Here's one:</P>
<P>(___}___) (_______}_______)  Two plumbers at work.</P>


<P>     My return top ten is finished and now I return to the game and set
out to conquer these noble goals. </P>

<P>-Magnus (Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Grandmaster Tank Mage who thinks the Stonecold idea is
pretty original</P>
