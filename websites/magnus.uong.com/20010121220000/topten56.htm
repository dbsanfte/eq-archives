<P>Hey there,</P>

<P>I typed my subject heading in all CAPS to pay tribute to Cyclone. I also
just looked up the word dingleberry in the online dictionary and could
not believe that it was listed. =^o Anyway, here's the newest top ten.</P>
<P>________________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>Hello RCGUOers,</P>

<P>My name is Wallace. I used to be the blacksmith around Ocllo. Ever since
the NPC wipe however, I have become a beggar around the Empath Abbey. We
NPCs will no longer be mistreated by OSI! We have compiled a list of
complaints. (There are 10 here because Magnus helped us write them.)</P>

<P>10. We can't walk around outside our shops anymore.</P>
<P>All I heard for months was players complaining that we were never in our
shops blah blah blah. When a guy works 23 hours a day, can't he get a
cigarette break every now and then. I had been trying to get the
atttention of that cute tailor in the shop across the street but every
time I'd get over there and start to make conversation some player would
run up to me and say, "Vendor buy me a bank guard!" and make me respawn
in my shop. Do you know how frustrating that is? And now, post NPC wipe,
I have no idea where my Eileen is. If anyone knows, please come and find
me at Empath Abbey. If you tell me where she is, I'll let you know where
a skinning knife of vanquishing can be found.</P>

<P>9. Players get to use our equipment for free. </P>
<P>Back when I was a blacksmith, people with names like, "DOOM's smith"
would come up and use my forge or anvil. I wouldn't mind it if they
asked but no, they just barge right up, shove me out of the way. and
then start to make platemail gorgets or chainmail coifs. Then, here's
the good part, they expect ME to buy their crap off of them. How is that
supposed to work? But what choice do I have? It's no use fighting with
them. OSI cares nothing for its employess, the NPCs I mean. I refused to
buy anything from anybody and just wandered for about an hour. Somebody
called a GM and the GM forced me to stand in front of my forge, then
trapped me in with anvils. I was so pissed. I tried to call another GM
to tell him I was stuck but I didn't have a HELP button.</P>

<P>8. The female guards have some complaints.</P>
<P>Here's what one of them has to say:</P>
<P>"My name is Rose and I am a guard in the service of Lord British. I am
currently looking into a sexual discrimination lawsuit against the king. 
Look at those outfits he forces us to wear! Even the Hooter
girls get shoes! What do we get? Funny tan lines and rashes due to the
leather. Just the other day, I was out patrolling and stepped on a rock
and cut my foot pretty badly. But did I have time to see about it? NO!
There was some guy with short grey hair at the Bank of Britain stealing
from people and it's somehow always during my shift. I killed that
lowlife 14 times before he moved on to another town. And Lord British
tells us we don't need prisons. *sigh*"</P>

<P>7. Beggar complaints</P>
<P>Since I've been a beggar for the last two days, I've seen that it is not
an easy life. Sure players give you money, but most only do it for the
notoriety benefits. So the Dastardly BustaRhymes comes and gives me one
GP every 15 minutes. Big whoopie! That's only 96 gold a day, if I got
money like that all the time. I used to make that for one shield. We
demand that Origin increase the minimum amount that a donation must be
before they award a notoriety point. I have to spend my time finding out
where all sorts of magical items are so I can pass the information along
to donaters. I don't have time to make my own money. The Great Lord
NotoHunta really needs to know that a substanial helmet may be nearby.
He may need it when he fights all those dishonorable newbies.</P>

<P>6. The monsters speak out</P>
<P>Here's an excerpt from an essay written by Ogopug, an orc:</P>
<P>"The humies do nothing but complain. They have no reason to be upset. We
are the victims here. Everytime OSI tries to swing the advantage in our
direction, they bitch and complain until they get things changed back.
What's worse is some of them have taken up the practice of trapping us
in houses. As if killing us weren't enough, they now pin us behind
tables and insult us to make us attack them. After a few arrows, they
stop and we are nursed back to health to have it done all over again.
THIS IS SADISTIC! I urge all the monsters of Sosaria to the following course of
action.
Leave everything of value in the monster banks. There is one located in
the bottom level of every dungeon. Players kill us for our loot. Simply
remove the loot and they will turn towards killing each other. If that
were to happen, we monsters could get on with our roleplaying and not
have to worry about getting Corp Pored everytime we try to take a walk
through the woods."</P>

<P>5. Choas and Order guards</P>
<P>Here's what Olaf the Chaos Guard has to say:</P>
<P>"These shields are damned expensive! Anytime a player loses one, we're
supposed to just give them another one whenever they feel like popping
back into the castle. Anytime we guards ask for a raise, British and
Blackthorne always have the same old lie prepared. "It's not in the
budget at this time." Yeah right! How about doing away with the f$#*ing
free shields and maybe then we could get a raise. We should start
charging players for the shields. 1000 GP a piece sounds fair to me. I
suggested this to British and he said something about sacrifice and
compassion. F&%$ing &^%$head!"</P>

<P>4. The butchers' guild</P>
<P>"Hello, my name is Edward. I am a butcher in title. However, no one ever
buys anything from my shop. Every once in awhile someone comes by and
wants me to buy 100 ribs from them. My question is, "With what?" I've
never sold a thing related to butchering. One time an Order guard and a
Choas guard came into my shop. I was surprised and humbled by their
appearance. THey each bought a skinning knife and began fighting with
them *inside* my shop. I ran and called a guard but he said that Lord
British has said it was OK for them to fight anywhere. I had to leave my
shop for the rest of the day. While I was out, I applied for a job in a
mage shop but never heard anything back. I've recently had to take up
drug trafficking to survive. I run a secret ring between Britain,
Vesper, and Trinsic. It's much more profitable that butchering ever was.
I now own 50,000 of those Rolexes that players received as Christmas
presents."</P>

<P>3. NPCs around the Skara Brae moongate</P>
<P>"My name is Holt and I have a story about two of your fellow NGI
members. The other night, Long John Magnus and Geryn the Pirate thought
it would be funny to annoy me. They each took a book and changed the
title of it. They then tried to give the book to me. I am a fighter by
trade and have no use for books. I refused their offer each time. I told
the I had no use for "a good spanking". They took the book back and
renamed it in the hopes that it might be more appealing. This time I
told them that I didn't want "a copy of Ultima On-Line". They still did
not stop. I had to refuse books named, "big wet kiss", "1,000,000,000
gold" and "a funky beat". When will they learn that I do not want
books?"</P>

<P>2. Ancient Wyrms, Blood Elementals, Poison Elementals, Drakes, Dragons</P>
<P>These creatures' spokeswyrm says:</P>
<P>"this game sux....ther r no challenges...the ancient wyrms try to kill
each other cuz humans r 2 stoopid and dumb...we are forced to fight ech
other for something 2 do...when somebody does come to fight us they hide
behind a rock and blade spirit us....OSI fix this now!"</P>

<P>1. The lovable UO bugs</P>
<P>"I am Clifford, the house break-in bug. Why is everyone against us? We
have feelings too! This newsgroup is just full of people who won't stop
until we are removed from UO completely. What are we supposed to do?
Where will we go? Wait a minute! Here's an ad for Everquest. I'll bet
Sony would let us stay with them for awhile. And here's another, Windows
98! Oh my, there's room for all of us! We outta here!!!"</P>

<P>These are our complaints. Remember, we may only have artificial
intelligence but that's better than what a lot of you out there have.</P>

<P>-Wallace  (NPC Beggar)</P>
<P>________________________________________________________________________</P>

<P>How about that? That's two lists in two days. What more could you want?
Well, I mean what more could you want that I could possibly give you?
The answer is no by the way. </P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo,Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Adept Tank Mage who says, "Hug an NPC today"</P>
