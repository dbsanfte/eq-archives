<P>Hail groupies,</P>
<P>     I've thought that the Ultima Online game engine would make a
fantastic single player RPG. Since we've seen what the Origin writers
are coming up with lately, (See FoA quest and the UO demo. Well, on second thought,
don't see the FoA quest or that demo.) I decided
that someone else should write the story for it. Then I thought, maybe I
could do it. Hmmmmm.... Well, I tried anyway. Here's what I came up
with. (I borrowed heavily from Ultima IV.)</P>

<P>Ultima: Offline</P>
<P>______________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>     You arrive home after a hard day and sit down in your favorite
chair. It's been a tough day in the 8th grade and you had to stay late
because Mrs. Evans saw you throw pizza at lunch and she gave you
detention. Well, you'll get even with her another day. Time to play some
Ultima Online! </P>
<P>You switch on the computer and suddenly, you are overcome
with drowsiness. Your mind drifts farther and farther and soon you have
the sensation of flight. You know it's not due to any drugs because you
really don't do them even though your PK character's guild title is
DRUGLORD. This must be a dream. Your dream continues until suddenly, you
awaken. </P>
<P>    As you look around, you see that you are seated under a tree, facing
a blue tent decorated with stars. There's a naked man in the distance
killing birds with a dagger. Still a little groggy from the sleep (and
fearing the guy with the dagger), you get up and stumble towards the
tent. </P>
<P>    You approach the tent and enter to find an old man with a crystal
ball. He looks and you and says, "Praise Koster! He has arrived!"
Surprised, you say, "WTF  r u tlaking about??//" "Why, you're the
avatar, the one who will remove the evil from our land! What is your
name?" </P>

<P>Prompt: By what name do you wish to be called?</P>

<P>     "WetCondom, what an interesting name!", says the old man. "I shall
have to remember that name for when my daughter has her son." He
continues, "WetCondom, you must now choose your path, I shall now ask
you questions and your responses shall determine your destiny." You
reply, "k".</P>
<P>     "You are entrusted to deliver and uncounted purs" he begins. "waht
deos encrusted meen?", you ask. "The word is 'enTRUSTed' and it means
that trust was placed upon your shoulders to deliver an uncounted
purse." he replies. "a purse! i aint carying a dman purse!!111" you
insist. The old man man, turning red, says, "OK, a bag of gold! GOLD
THAT WAS NOT COUNTED! YOU WERE TRUSTED TO DELIVER IT AND A BEGGAR
APPROACHES YOU!" You say, "k dude settle down". Calming down, he
continues, "Do you honestly deliver all the gold or show compassion and
give the beggar a coin knowing that it won't be missed?"</P>
<P>     You stare into space for several seconds and say, "i would taek the
gold 4 myslef and go party!" The old man sighs and says, "Screw it! If
anybody asks, I told you that you were a tank mage! NOW GET OUT OF HERE
AND SEEK LORD BRITISH." "im american dumass", you answer. The old man
grumbles, "I swear to Raph, where does British get the idea that this
numbskull is going to save the world? Oh yeah, meet the avatar, blah
blah blah, good for my rep, blah blah, get his autograph for my kids,
blah blah, do the mysterious old man seer bit. Well screw British! I'm
going to Everquest! Kal Ort Por" The old man disappers from sight.</P>
<P>      "waht a lamer", you think to yourself. As you leave the tent, you
realize that you're in Britannia. This isn't far from Yew. "taht birtish
guy prolly lives in brit" you think to yourself and head down the road
marked 'Britain'. As you walk, the naked guy who was killing birds runs
past you and says, "move it newbie!" and continues running. "fuk u!" you
shout at the man who is now out of hearing range.</P>
<P>     More walking confirms confirms your theory about being in
Britannia. You pass another naked man, this one chopping trees for wood,
making bookshelves from the wood and then smashing the shelves with his
axe. You travel a little farther down the road and you see a man wearing
human bones and a skull on his head. He is saying, 'destination' over
and over again. Following the bone man are several people who keep
shouting that they wish to go to a dungeon. They reach a spot in the
woods and the bone man opens their packs and takes their gold. They
don't try to stop him, they simply call for guards who are too far to
hear them.</P>
<P>     A little further down the road and you see a huge castle on the
horizon. As you walk towards it, you come upon a crossroads. Britain,
Trinsic, and Yew read the blood covered signs. There are dead men
everywhere and three plate clad archers on horses as black as night. As
a veteran of Ultima Online, you know well the penalties to those unlucky
'newbies' who loot the fallen corpses. </P>
<P>     You rush past the crossroads and into the city of Britain. The bank
first greets you with a gigantic crowd of people walking around it.
There are mages who are calling down lightning bolts from the sky upon
themselves. After a few strikes, the begin to chant. *BOING* Most are naked. </P>
<P>     There are others as well. Merchants have gathered in this public
area and are peddling their wares. "SAHDOW IGNETS 4 SELL!!!"  "SCRIBNG
1st THRU 4TH!!!!" "RED PALTE 20K!11" You push your way through the crowd
and arrive at the large castle.</P>
<P>     You walk across the drawbridge and into the castle and realize that
it's almost completely empty inside. Further into the castle and you see
a throne shaped like a 'U' and a man seated on it with a symbol on his chest that looks like a
severed penis. "thsi guy msut be kewl", you think.</P>
<P>     "welcome WetCondom!", he says, "ive waited long 4 ur arrival" "who
r u?", you ask. "i am lord britsh im king of thsi world", he answers.
You joke, "i guess taht menas u RooL, huh?" "LOl", British laughs.
"Hehe", you laugh too. British says, "i need u to saev thsi world from
evil...there r pks everywhere...hell tehy even killed me one day and im
supposed to be invuln" You agree with a nod and a "k". "WetCondom, u
must kill the eight pks of virtue and ill give u avatarhood anmd one of
my dick shields, k?"</P>
<P>"ok kewl", you answer and thus begins you quest!</P>
<P>_________________________________________________________________</P>
