<p align="left"><font size="3">Previously, on the WetCondom
Channel: Lord British has been put in touch with his feminine
side by MERLIN. WetCondom is pissed and Magnus is hysterical. </font></p>

<hr>

<p>Lord British's Castle:<br>
Magnus has just ducked a flower pot and is standing back up. He
says, &quot;But seriously though, why didn't you tell WC to try
looking around the shrines?&quot; British is still fuming, &quot;waht
teh hell good would taht do?&quot; Magnus says, &quot;Uhm, didn't
you call them the '8 pks of virtue'? You told me one time that
you called them that because they lived near the shrines of the
virtues. Therefore, I would think that there would be a good
chance that their house might be located next to a shrine.
Therefore, you might want to relay that information to the dim
witted avatar you just sent off.&quot; British says through
clenched, pearly white teeth, &quot;i jsut made taht up bcuz i
liek 2 call stuff 'of teh virtues' and it soudns good...i dont
kno wher teh hell they live&quot; Magnus says, &quot;Great, well
in that case, you should probably get used to those two boobs of
virtue you're wearing up front there.&quot; He ducks a shoe.</p>

<p>Scene shifts back to the avatar:<br>
You ride through the streets of Trinsic on your horse 'a' making
your way to the bank. You think to yourself, &quot;surely if
neone has seen MERLIN..theyd be at teh bank.....MERLIN, im gonna
be on ur ass like my mom on a buffet...im gonna whip ur ass
harder than my dad whips mine....u will BEG 4 mercy!11&quot;.</p>

<p>You arrive at the bank to a somewhat peculiar scene. There are
all the normal things you see at a bank, the people conducting
their business on the roof, the corpses of thieves, the guy
walking around with 10 chickens ( drumstick, a, b, c,
deeelishous, urgay, mcnugget, osi fuckin sux, a chicken, and
pimpinchik ) following him. What catches your eye though is the
man dressed in earth tones who's shouting, &quot;Selling bread,
fish, and pastries!&quot; </p>

<p>You ride over to him and leap off of a's back. An
uncontrollable rage builds up in you and you can't shake the
feeling from deep within your being that this man before is the
sole cause of it. (Author's note: WetCondom is a child, with the
IQ of Steve from Blues Clues.) You grab the man by the throat and
scream, &quot;who r u?/// ur a spy,,,,arnt u!&quot; The man in
your grip shoots back, &quot;hey fuk u avatar boy...thsi is my rp
mule .. u want me 2 get my 7x gm and rok ur ass right off teh
shard?&quot; You fire back, &quot;dont lie!111....ur the one who
turned bristh into a girl!!111&quot;</p>

<p>The small crowd that has gathered gasps at your words. Someone
says, &quot;brtish has been turned into a gril??/&quot; You
release the man's throat and turn around to face the crowd.
&quot;yeh&quot;, you say, &quot;someone put a gender swpa potion
into his fod..im looking 4 teh guy taht did it&quot; LoLs and
'hehe's begin throughout the crowd and someone suggests &quot;LSTE
GO SEE HIM/HER!&quot; and in a matter of 10 seconds, and two
dozen recalls, you are left alone at the bank.</p>

<p>Realizing your mistake, you walk slowly back to your horse
with your head hung low. From down the street, a man with white
hair and a white robe runs you way. It's your old friend
Sperminator's thief mule, Gangstah Bob. He's out of breath but he
manages to say, &quot;dood...i found MERLINS house...i marked a
rune...here&quot; and he hands you a rune with &quot;MERLIN aka
faggot bitch's house&quot; scratched on the back. You start to
ask, &quot;how did u.. &quot; but he interrupts, &quot;sorry
dood,,,campngi a decaying house with sperminator...gotta run&quot;
He steps into the inn and instalogs.</p>

<p>You recall from the rune and are suddenly standing in a
clearing. Well, it used to be a clearing. Actually, there are 7
houses jammed in the space where one or two should be. They are
mere inches apart. There are signs taped the front of several of
them that say &quot;This house is in an illegal location, if it
is not re-deeded by Jan. 1, 1999, it will be deleted. Signed, GM
Darwin.&quot; One of the houses has a nameplate that reads,
&quot;MERLIN'S SPERM BANK...CUM ON IN..... B====D&quot; (That's
an ASCII drawing of a penis for those of you who've never used
IRC.)</p>

<p>This must be the place! All names shows no one inside. Circle
of transparency, which lets you look through walls, shows a mess
of a house inside. There are stacks of boxes and bags. Piles of
reagents litter the floor. In the corner, there is a table with a
bottle sitting on it. The bottle it labeled, 'gender swap
antidote'. Aha! You quickly hit your hide macro and you and your
horse vanish into thin air. You begin the wait for your foe.</p>

<p>After three hours of waiting, and watching your old Pokemon
videos, the air crackles, and MERLIN appears next to you, wearing
nothing but what appears to be a cloth diaper. You lunge from
your hiding place, spurring 'a' on, shouting your battle cry,
&quot;DIE FAG!!!!&quot; Your crossbow is cocked and ready to fire
as you take aim at the naked mage. MERLIN is startled but he
cooly runs to his door and in one motion, unlocks it, opens it,
walks through it, and recloses it. Your arrow hits the door.</p>

<p>For the next several minutes, you stand outside and scream
taunts to MERLIN. Nothing works and finally, All names no longer
shows his name inside. With a final curse, you locate your rune
to British's castle and recall.</p>

<p>The throne room is packed! There are dozens and dozens of
people gawking at the transformed king crouched behind the throne.
British is shouting 'I ban thee!&quot; over and over and one by
one the people are disappearing. However, there are so many that
it's taking quite a long time to clear the room. </p>

<p>There's one group of men dressed in drag quoting scenes from
'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'. However, they cleverly replace
Dr. Franknfurter's name with British. Others are less
imaginiative, (read: they're brainless morons) and simply spam
&quot;TEH KING IS A PUSSY!11&quot; or &quot;BRITSH R U A REEL
GIRL?//WILL U MARRY ME?&quot; over and over.</p>

<p>After 15 minutes or so, British has the room cleared. Magnus
is still leaning against the wall just shaking his head. British
stands up, rather red faced, and says, &quot;i sure hope u haev
good news&quot; You reply, &quot;weel i found merlins house and
he has teh antidote..but when i tried 2 pk him...he ran in his
house and loked teh door&quot; British sighs, &quot;damn i gotta
get taht antidote..hmmm&quot; Out of habit, he reaches up to
scratch his beard and pokes himself with his fingernails. </p>

<p>Suddenly, the air crackles and a figure appears in the center
of the room. It is a short, chubby man, dressed only in a large T-shirt
that says, &quot;KAOS RULEZ&quot; in white letters. It's Lord
Blackthorn, British's 'closest' adviser and chess opponent.
Blackthorn is frowning.</p>

<p>&quot;magnus.. is british ok?&quot; asks Blackthorn. Magnus
says, &quot;Believe the hype, British is one Y chromosome short
of a man now.&quot; Blackthorn replies, &quot;magnus u r not
funny..neway i heard alredy...british waht r we gonna do?///&quot;
British stares at the floor, &quot;we kno who did it it was
MERLIN teh pk...my new avatar, wetcondom foudn his house but cnat
get in 2 pk him&quot; </p>

<p>Magnus says, &quot;I have an idea, but I have conditions also.&quot;
British doesn't even look up, &quot;name them&quot; Magnus says,
&quot;First, I want Ocllo.&quot; British says, &quot;waht?!?!&quot;
Magnus continues, &quot;I want the whole island as my private
resort. And, oh yeah, I want you to triple my skill cap.&quot;
British jumps up and says, &quot;NO WAY..U CNAT EXPECT ME 2 GIVE
U A WHOLE ISLAND OR TRIPLE UR SKILL CAP 4GET IT!&quot; Magnus
cooly says, &quot;Alrighty then, I figure you have about 27 days,
15 hours until your 'monthly friend' comes to visit you.&quot; He
pauses for a second and then continues, &quot;If ya change your
mind before then, give a ring, I'll be at my house. Kal Ort P...&quot;
British runs over to him and grabs his arm, &quot;STOP! OK OK U
CAN HAVE IT JUST GET THAT ANTIDOTE&quot; Magnus grins, &quot;I
knew you'd see things my way. I'll have you back to normal by the
end of the day. C'mon Trojan Man, we've got work to do.&quot;</p>

<p>You follow Magnus out of the throne room and hear Blackthorn
say to British, &quot;y didn u just tell me?/ u have a new avatar
and got turned into a girl and didnt tell me? y not?&quot; That's
all you hear as Magnus grabs your horse's reins and leads you out
the door saying, &quot;Let's leave these two alone for a bit.
Watching them fight is funny, but watching them make up will turn
your stomach inside out.&quot;</p>

<p>You and Magnus walk into the court yard of the castle.
Suddenly, Magnus turns and faces you. He says, &quot;Now look,
just because we're working together on this doesn't mean we're
'budz' now. Just do what I tell you to and we'll get this taken
care of.&quot; You ask, &quot;wahts ur plan?&quot; Magnus says,
&quot;To use my head to get us inside.&quot; You say, &quot;ur
not gonna head butt teh door r u?&quot; Magnus rolls his eyes and
says, &quot;I'm not going to even grant that comment
acknowledgement, here's what you need to know. I'm going to turn
you invisible. You recall and then wait for MERLIN to let me in.
When he opens the door and I'm inside, rush the door and we will
both take him out. MERLIN's one of those new mages that doesn't
wear plate like me. He'll die easily with an up close fight.&quot;
You ask, &quot;y is he going 2 let u in?&quot; Magnus says,
&quot;Because I have a charming personality.&quot; </p>

<p>With that, he casts his invisible spell and you and 'a' vanish.
You drop your rune to MERLIN's house and recall. A minute later,
a wisp named Magnus appears. He floats back and forth and says,
&quot;VgX NyN WeT CoN DoM SuX&quot; Suddenly, you hear the door
open and MERLIN steps out. (He is like most villains and talks
out loud to himself for purposes of revealing his thoughts,
feelings, and evil plans to the hidden good guys eavesdropping
nearby.) </p>

<p>MERLIN says out loud to nobody, &quot;alright! a wisp....ever
since teh gms deelted my orc mage...i have gotten any resist....thsi
is jsut waht i need!11&quot; He attacks Magnus who follows him to
the front steps. &quot;YgX Mn LoL UrD Ed&quot;, Magnus the wisp
says. MERLIN opens the door to allow Magnus inside and steps in.
That's your signal and you rush in. MERLIN gasps and begins to
shout, &quot;vendor buy bank guards before i say recsu recdu i
ban thee&quot;, but Magnus dispels his wisp illusion and cups a
hand over MERLIN's mouth. </p>

<p>The fight is over quickly. A couple of arrows and an energy
bolt from Magnus send MERLIN to his death. Magnus says, &quot;Now,
hurry and loot him before he logs in a mule character.&quot; You
rifle through MERLIN's backpack looking for the kewl reg and find
a reagent called 'WeeD'. Magnus says, &quot;That's it. I've got
the antidote for British, let's go back to the castle.&quot;
Before he does anything else though, he places a business card on
the table where the antidote was. The card reads, &quot;Real
Mages Wear Plate.&quot;</p>

<p>Magnus creates a moongate and you and your horse step through
it. Magnus follows. You appear in the throne room and find
British sitting alone. The king looks up, and asks, &quot;did u
get it?&quot; Magnus smiles and says, &quot;Yep, just sign that
deed to Ocllo over to me and you can have it.&quot; British
grimaces but grabs a pen and pulls a piece of paper from
underneath the cushion on the throne. He seems to have a hard
time writing with his long fingernails but manages to scrawl out,
&quot;SOLD 2 MAGNUS FOR ONE GOLD PIECE: ISLAND OF OCLLO.....LORD
BRITISH&quot; Magnus takes the paper, nods and hands the antidote
over to British.</p>

<p>British runs behind his curtain and gulps down the potion.
Within seconds, he steps out from behind the curtain in his old
form. &quot;im back 2 normal!111 thx u magnus&quot; Magnus
smiles, &quot;Did you check to make sure <em>everything</em> was
back?&quot; British gasps and runs back behind the curtain. In a
couple of seconds, you hear him give a sigh of relief and shout,
&quot;yeh everythings back 2 normal&quot;</p>

<p>He emerges from the curtain once again and says, &quot;now did
u get teh kewl reg wetcondom?&quot; You nod and hand over the
WeeD. British is overjoyed and says, &quot;u kno taht only leeves
5 moer..ur almost half way ther&quot; </p>

<p>He turns his attention to Magnus, &quot;how did u get inside
MERLIN's house?//&quot; Magnus says, &quot;It was easy, I
polymorphed into a wisp and he let me in the door so he could
work on his magic resistance.&quot; British laughs, &quot;i never
thought i would say thsi, but tahts brilliant! how did u kno taht
would work?//&quot; Magnus says, &quot;It was easy, I just read
the strategy guide for the game. I'm headed back to my island,
we'll discuss the skill cap later. By the way, where did
Blackthorn run off to?&quot; British says, &quot;oh he's taking a
shower&quot; Magnus' only answer is to recall away, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>British looks at you and smiles, &quot;dood...ther will be a
celebration 2nite!!1&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the tower of the PKs:<br>
The PKs are having a meeting. Three of the eight chairs are
vacant and l33t h4ck4h is speaking. &quot;thsi avatar is
becomeing a bother....we cnat let him have nemore of teh kewl
