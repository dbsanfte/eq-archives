<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Top Ten List No. 1</H1>
<P>I've been playing Uo for about 3 months now and I keep running up on
things that really annoy me. I'm, of course, talking about phrases on
the screen that make me want to hit my head repeatedly on my desk. (So
far I have restrained myself) Nonetheless, I figured there wasn't enough
venting on this newsgroup (wink) and have compiled these things into a
top ten list. (So it's not a Devid Letterman intro., sue me)</P>

<P>10. *Sir Iggy continues grinding*</P>
<P>    *Sir Iggy continues grinding*</P>
<P>    *Sir Iggy continues grinding*</P>
<P>    *Sir Iggy continues grinding*</P>
<P>    After about 10 minutes of this, I get the picture. Hey! What if
all skills used emoting?</P>
<P> *Magnus hides himself well*</P>
<P> *Magnus continues hiding*   uuuh   maybe not  =-\</P>

<P>9. You hear lovely music and forget to continue battling.
   ATTENTION OSI!!! Please put in some new songs!! Matchbox 20
would be nice. Maybe the provisioners could start selling
walkmans.</P>

<P>8. IMANEWBIE: Magnus!</P>
<P>   Magnus: Yes?</P>
<P>   IMANEWBIE: I was just PKed. Can you spare some weapons and armor?</P>
<P>   Magnus: Sure, and here's all my reagents and the key to my house
and    my new ship deed. Have fun with them!</P>
<P>   (Maybe Origin should put a little bit more info. in the user
manual, like: don't bother other players too much - don't attack orc
mages on your first day - don't try to ask dread lords the way to
the nearest bank - don't eat the yellow snow ....)</P>

<P>7. You have left the protection of Lord British's guards.</P>
<P>   You see: an ettin</P>
<P>   Magnus: Corp Por</P>
<P>   Magnus: Corp Por</P>
<P>   Magnus: Vas Flam</P>
<P>   You see: an ettin corpse</P>
<P>   You see: magic plate mail</P>
<P>   What item would you like to identify and appraise?</P>
<P>   Magnus: It appears to be Indestructable Platemail of
Invulnerabilty    and Magic Reflection with 100 charges.</P>
<P>   Magnus: YES!!!!!!</P>
<P>   System: Servers going down in 25 minutes</P>
<P>   Magnus: NO!!!!!!!</P>
    
<P>Is there anyway they could back up before they take the servers   
offline?</P>

<P>6. *Magnus is alone in the third level of any dungeon*</P>
<P>   You see: Lord JackMeOff</P>
<P>   You see: Lord Terminator</P>
<P>   You see: Lord SukMiDik</P>
<P>   You see: Lord TeenBastard</P>
<P>   You see: Lord KickYerAss</P>
<P>   You see: you should stayed in town tonight</P>
<P>   Lord JackMeOff: Corp Por</P>
<P>   Lord Terminator: Corp Por</P>
<P>   Lord SukMiDik: Corp Por</P>
<P>   Lord TeenBastard: Corp Por</P>
<P>   Lord KickYerAss: Corp Por</P>
<P>   *Magnus thinks to himself: Good thing OSI fixed it so recall
doesn't work in this level of the dungeon. These guys might have
gotten away. *<P>

<P>5. *Magnus is walking around Britannia*</P>
<P>   Cheapo: Magnus!</P>
<P>   Magnus: Yes?</P>
<P>   Cheapo: Where did you get that cool lookin' black plate from?</P>
<P>   Magnus: I buy pieces of it from all over the world.</P>
<P>   Cheapo: Cool! Would you be willing to sel it?</P>
<P>   Magnus: Sure. 2000 GP (It cost me 1500, I figure that's fair)</P>
<P>   Cheapo: HAHA! Are you crazy? I only have 800. Take it or leave it.</P>
<P>   (At this point I have two options)</P>
<P>   a) Out of town - Blade Spirits</P>
<P>   b) In town - Summons as many animals as I can and have them all      
follow cheapo</P>
<P>   a and b) Magnus: Yes Cheapo. I am crazy.</P>

<P>4. *Bob Vila the carpenter is walking in the woods lumberjacking and    
making furniture*</P>
<P>   What would you like to use this smoothing plane on?</P>
<P>   You cannot create that there. "Uh, why not?"</P>

<P>    Why do we have to have a flat piece of ground to make an item?
You can't even drop things in you happen to get overloaded on a
hill. Why is such valuable space going to waste. Houses could be
built there. Hills and mountainsides have high property values.
That would mean more taxes for Lord British. That would mean
more of the things Lord British provides us with. Like those totally
cool books about politics and uuuh guards! Yes more guards is what
the game needs. Put in so many guards, that you can't walk more than
one screen without seeing one. Finally a solution to PKing. A
solution to newbies getting killed by tough monsters. A solution to
all those powerful mages running around killing all, grabbing loot
then recalling off. I HAVE FOUND THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION.(sorry must
be the caffiene talking .. er typing)</P>

<P>3.  *Magnus is in Vesper*</P>
<P>    LazyOne: Magnus. Can you gate?</P>
<P>    Magnus: Yes.</P>
<P>    LazyOne: Would you gate me to Minoc?</P>
<P>    Magnus: It's a short walk.</P>
<P>    LazyOne: I know but I'm scared of PKs. I'll pay you.</P>
<P>    Magnus (ever the capitalist): How much?</P>
<P>    LazyOne: 15 GP</P>
<P>    *An evil smile crosses Magnus' face*</P>
<P>    Magnus: Sure. I'll do it.</P>
<P>    You see: A recall rune for Hythloth: Daemon Room</P>
<P>    Magnus: Vas Rel Por</P>
<P>    LazyOne: Goodbye kind sir!</P>
<P>    *Magnus thinks to himself: "I'm such an ass, but what the hell,     
he doesn't have to worry about the PKs."*</P>
   

<P>    Disclaimer: The preceding scene never happened to me but
wouldn't it be funny if it did?</P>
    
<P>2.  NPC Gustave: Magnus! Coulds't thou aid me? I am in need of . 
hath one I hear. Mayhap I could give thee .</P>
    
<P>Just what is the problem with this? Why has this never been fixed. 
Apparently, Gustave is shy about what he wants and is
whispering. What could be so embarrasing?  A blow up doll? A salad
shooter? A Spice Girls CD? A Hanson poster? Maybe the Power Rangers movie.
I guess we'll never know.</P>
<P>    Magnus: Hi Gustave. Try therapy.</P>

<P>1. *Magnus gets home after a long day's work*</P>
<P>   *Magnus turns on his computer and loads Ultima On-Line*</P>
<P>   *Attention Mages: Despite all our efforts to make magic useless,   
PKers are still using magic to kill their victims. Origin will not   
tolerate this. Anyone caught using magic from this point on will have   
their account permanently banned. We hope this helps all the archers   
and fighters out there*</P>
    
<P>    OK OK, before the flames start flying at me. I'm a mage and I'm    
somewhat (OK a lot) biased in this area. I don't want magic damage    
raised against players, but at least let me kill an orc without    
using all my mana. I've had to take up swordsmanship to survive. In    
a week and a half my swordsmanship has passed my magery. =-( </P>


<P>Please note that most of the above situations were and will remain
fictitious. I do not delight in the torment of newbies. (Except in
newsgroups) I do not PK because someone bruises my feelings, even though
psychologists say the worst damage you can do to a person is hurt their
feelings (Can't we all just get along?). =-) Thanks for reading this
far. (Oh who am I kidding? I'm the only person who's going to read this
far.) </P>
