<P>This is part three of the Ultima Offline saga. We last left WetCondom
and Magnus in Ocllo, with WetCondom asking for Magnus' black plate.</P>

<P>_______________________________________________________________________</P>

<P>     "Let me rephrase the question", Magnus says. "Do you have any
intelligent questions for me?" he asks. You think for several seconds
and reply, "i dont gues so" Magnus says, "Good, now I guess we should
get started with your training. The first thing that you need is a
simple quest so that I can ascertain your abilities."</P>

<P>     An evil smile crosses the tank mage's face and he says, "Find me a
polar bear that is not trapped in a house and that is not named Coke or
Cola." You reply with a "k" and turn to head out to the woods. Magnus
grabs your shirt collar and says, "Nah, I don't want you wandering my
island looking for something that doesn't exist. Just go to the
blacksmith store and buy a weapon and a shield. I'll be waiting here."</P>

<P>     You walk down the street and you see the city docks in the
distance. There's a man standing there with a box. He's dumping the
contents of the box into the water. You decide to investigate. As you
near the man, you see that his box is full of all kinds of boots, shoes
and sandals. </P>

<P>     "sup", you say to him. "Hail WetCondom! What an honor to meet thee
in person." "how do u kno my naem?" you ask. The man scratches his head
and says, "I don't know, you just looked like a WetCondom to me." You
ask, "wahts' ur naem?/" The man replies, "My name's Spawn. I will be in
charge of all the resources that you'll need for your quest. You just
caught me restocking the bay here for fishermen. As a matter of fact,
I've got to hurry and drop some tresure maps in the water off the cost
of Jhelom in just a few minutes. It was nice talking to you." With that,
the man vanishes.</P>

<P>     You find the blacksmith shop to do as Magnus instructed. "i need a
weapon and a shield", you say to the smith. "Certainly! Please take
whatever you want for free! It's not everyday that the great WetCondom
stops by!" the blacksmith says. You choose the heavy crossbow and the
heater shield and make your way back to the bank where Magnus is
waiting.</P>

<P>     Magnus has found a chair somewhere and is listening to a com
crystal when you get back. The voice coming through it is that of Lord
British. "She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the
rain. She'll make you live a crazy life and she'll take away your
paaaain. Like a bul....", the crystal sings. Magnus turns the crystal
off when he sees you and muses, "That com crystal I hid in British's
bathroom is the most fun I've had in this game yet." He says, "So sultan
of safe sex, what did you get?" You show him the crossbow and the shield
and he shakes his head. </P>

<P>     Magnus, talking to no one in particular, asks "Is it possible that
his brain supports his body?" Then, to you, he says, "Ditch the shield."</P>

<P>     You put the shield in your pack and equip the crossbow. Magnus
summons a daemon and names it Fluffy. He tells you, "Ok, lesson one.
Attack it." You do as you're told and are killed with the first swing of
Fluffy's sword. Magnus laughs and says, "Lesson one is 'Newbies can't
kill daemons.'" At this remark, the com crystal in Magnus' pack begins
to play a tune that sounds a lot like the theme from Cheers. Magnus
grabs the crystal and says, "What Rick?" Lord British's voice comes from
the crystal. It says, "taht wasnt funny...dnot do taht again or u will
be sorry" "I'm already sorry," Magnus says, "Sorry that I haven't said
anything about Blackthorn's dog collar gorget yet." The crystal goes
silent and Magnus laughs again and puts it back into his pack.</P>

<P>     With a wave of his hands and the chanting of magic words, you are
returned to life. Magnus then says, "Seek out
http://ultimaoffline.statics.com You'll find all that is required there
to become a warrior. If British can give out URLs in talking wall
speeches, I can too."  You say, "u meen u arent gonna trane me?" Magnus
says, "Nope, I don't think we'd survive it. Just remember that web page
address and you'll be fine and oh yeah, don't ever come back to this
island."</P>

<P>     He summons another gate and tells you to go through it. You emerge
in Trinsic with the URL planted firmly in your memory. Even, as you hit
ALT TAB to minimize your active window, dreams of becoming a great
warrior race through your mind. Your palms sweat with anticipation as
you type the web address into your browser...</P>

<P>Hopefully episode four will be ready before the next Star Wars movie, but I wouldn't count on it.</P>

<P>-Magnus</P>
<P>Trying to figure out how to work BON3DOOD and pLaTeDeWd into this</P>

<P> P.S. I got ZERO responses to this story in the newsgroup. Verily, doth it suck?</P>
