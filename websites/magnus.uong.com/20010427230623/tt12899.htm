<P>Yo ho ho,</P>

<P>     Ok, I admit it. The last top ten on the vendor changes sucked. I
was in a hurry, see, and I didn't want to go any longer without writing
one, see, and .... oh nevermind. I'm just thankful, that's right
_thankful_ that I even get to post at all.</P>
<P>     Hmm, oh well. Here's a new newscast done in top ten form in the key
of C minor.</P>

<P>________________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>Good Evening Britannia!</P>

<P>      WNPK news reporting. We bring you all the news that is news and
some of the news that is old and some of the news that is kind of old
but you haven't heard about it yet so it really is new to you and some
of the news that is new but everyone knew it already so it isn't really
news now is it? Here's what's new.</P>

<P>10. Hundreds of furniture stores are closing their doors forever this
week. These closings were brought on after almost two months of certain
strange phenomenon occurring in the woods. It seems that pieces of
furniture are appearing in the woods by the hundreds. Rather than buy
furniture from a dealer, Britannians simply walk into the woods and
carry home what they need. We tried to interview Chop Suey the nudist
carpenter and perhaps get to the bottom of this mystery. However, upon
seeing our crew he fled into deep into the forests and has not been seen
since.</P>

<P>9. There's an orcish bake sale tomorrow at the Yew Orc fort. The new
line of 'orc muffins' and 'orc cakes' has become so popular that they
will start selling them to hungry folks.</P>

<P>8. Healers made a giant leap forward in the fight against the disease
kewlio d. They believe they have found a link between long term exposure
to true black dye and the symptoms of kewlio d. As you may know, kewlio
d is a killer disease that affects close to 75% of Britannians. Symptoms
of this disease include jumbled speech, hallucinations about
prostitution, and an insatiable desire for 'phat regz'. Also, more tests
are being done to correlate bone armor exposure to the dreaded disease.
This research may very well lead to prevention programs for kewlio d.</P>

<P>7. TuPaC, [thug immortal, HO][order] will be giving an 8 hour 'macro one
for the stats' concert tomorrow night at the Britain bank. Get your
seats early!</P>

<P>6. There are now reports coming in of deranged murdering tailors
blocking the entrance to Covetous chanting something about moving cloth.
We've got a reporter on location to report live on this situation.
Baxter Green are you there?</P>

<P>Baxter Green: I'm here WNPK. Sir, can you tell me why you tailors are
here?</P>

<P>TayloR: sup Baxter G! i wanna give a shout out to the SEX guild u doods
rule</P>

<P>Baxter Green: Why are all these tailors here?</P>

<P>TayloR: cuz since tailoring is so easy now we cant sell anything cuz
every1 is making shirts now...we r going to pk anybody that comes along</P>

<P>Baxter Green: And there you have it, Baxter Green reporting.</P>

<P>*You see TayloR attacking Baxter Green*</P>
<P>*You see J Crew attacking Baxter Green*</P>
<P>*You see Cloth Barn attacking Baxter Green*</P>
<P>*You see The Famous Janey attacking Baxter Green*</P>

<P>5. There is still no clear leader in the order vs. chaos war. Members of
the order guild 'Crack Smokin' Knights' imposed economic sanctions on
the chaos guilds today. The Crack Smokin' Knights apparently organized
and bought out all the reagents from the mage shops and sold
approximately 10,000 fancy shirts to the tailors. The chaos guild 'Hoes
with Bows' responded by calling the order guilds, 'a bunch of sucky ass
pussies'. They then went on a killing spree with their PK characters to
get much needed supplies. </P>

<P>4. Join WinterFest 99 at the Paladins' Hall in Trinsic tomorrow! All
sorts of games and activities are planned.</P>

<P>-A map stacking contest</P>
<P>-1000 gold prize for most creative 'vendor buy bank guards' macro</P>

<P>3. UO's Greatest Hits, Numero Tres will soon be on store shelves. This
edition contains such smash hits as...</P>

<P>And oh so many more.</P>

<P>2. It was confirmed today by the Britannian Institute of Gameparks that
the grey wolf is now extinct. BooB, [I love tits, HEL] was a poacher of
this animal. We had an exclusive interview with him.</P>

<P>WNPK: BooB, what are your motives behind this poaching?</P>
<P>BooB: WTF is a motive?///</P>
<P>WNPK: Uhm, why did you feel it neccessary to kill grey wolves?</P>
<P>BooB: oh thats easy...if ur grey ur dead...it used to rhyme but then the
lame ass rep patch went in and nobodies red now</P>

<P>1. Lord British has changed the name of his castle to 'blackthorn is
gay'. This move comes just two days after Blackthorn renamed his castle,
'birtish uses UOE'.</P>

<P>     Thanks for watching. Join us again in another month or two and by
then this will be old and something else will be new and where there's
new stuff, there's WNPK news. *Funky music plays* Good night everybody!</P>
