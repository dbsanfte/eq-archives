<P>'Lo folks,</P>

<P>     I read the article this morning about the name Zog Cabal being a
Zionist movement thingie. If you haven't read it, Origin is pulling the changing
the name Zog Cabal. It will never be mentioned again by OSI in the game. I
decided to do a top ten list of ways that the Zog Cabal can be written
out of the plot.</P>

<P>10. The Zog Cabal, after their failed Armageddon spell, realize that
only by enlisting the aid of Mondain can they complete their quest to
destroy Britannia. By using a secret time travel spell (a.k.a. timewarp
from hell) they manage to save the wizard from death and bring him
forward to our future. Mondain makes his decree to the Britannian
populace:</P>

<P>Mondain: I once held this world in the palm of my hand! Surrender now
and there will be no bloodshed! I warn you, I am not one to be trifled
with.</P>
<P>MaZtA of DiZaStA: fuk u assholle</P>
<P>You see MaZtA of DiZaStA attacking Mondain with a heavy crossbow of
thermonuclear annihilation. (prepatch of course)</P>
<P>Papa John: look at that wicked staff he;s holding!!! i bet this is a
quest!</P>
<P>Papa John: Corp Por</P>
<P>TwIsTeD: yeh and all them others in the zog cabal have kewl plate - ltes
rok em!</P>
<P>TwIsTeD: Vas Corp Por</P>
<P>TwIsTeD: Flam Sanct (Ingredients for the Energy Vortex 2000)</P>
<P>TwIsTeD: choke on that u bastards! </P>
<P>Mondain: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!</P>
<P>MaZtA of DiZaStA: hehe u suk the big one!</P>
<P>You see: a corpse of Mondain</P>
<P>You see: corpses of all the Zog Cabal</P>

<P>9. Have the town criers announce, "The members of the Zog Cabal were
caught using UOExtreme. They are hereby banned from all in game
functions."</P>

<P>8. Little Zog Jr. has a talk with his dad and makes him understand that
he would much rather have a copy of Quake for his birthday than the
destruction of Britannia.</P>

<P>7. Lord British makes an actual appearance to talk to the unwashed
masses and the Zog Cabal appears and tries the Armageddon spell again.
However, this time they target the one man that binds Britannia
together, Lord British (And if you believe that, what game have you been
playing?). It's not a pretty picture. First all of the items he has in
his bank box decay. Then his clothes decay. Then, the organs in his body
are treated like items and they decay too. Lord British dies (again) and
the people are so overjoyed that the Zog Cabal are made rulers of the
world. At which point, no one ever sees them again except through annual
speeches made through talking walls.</P>

<P>6. Or...</P>
<P>The Zog Cabal, knowing that Magnus once took the throne of Britannia,
seek his destruction. They target the Armageddon spell on him but forget
to use a magic arrow to take down his spell reflect. The Zog Cabal die a
brutal death and Magnus gets a set of runes to the roof of every
building in Britain.</P>

<P>5. The Zog Cabal, and their Armageddon spell are revealed to be those
two lovable lab mice Pinky and the Brain on yet another attempt to take
over the world. They are promptly put back in their cages and the
storyline is dropped.</P>

<P>4. A GM tells Zog that his name is offensive and that he must change it.
After a heated discussion with the GM, Zog's character is deleted and he
is forced to start a new one with a new name. Of course, everyone knows
that KeWL KaBaL is really him and since his 50 points in lumberjacking
and carpentry aren't enough to stand up to attacks, newbie swordsmen
take turns PKing him.</P>

<P>3. The members of the Zog Cabal stumble upon a dead newbie tailor and
take his belongings (a little cloth and sewing kit). In only a few
hours, all the members have discovered the joys of sewing and spend the
rest of their existence making body sashes.</P>

<P>2. The Zog Cabal finds our humble little newsgroup and posts something
like this:</P>
<P>"uo fukin sux.....i tried to take over ur pathetci little world but
could i do that????// hell no! dman fukin gms keep screwin me over....
they dont keep LB from doign whatever the hell he wants!!!111.....i have
had it with this piece of trash called uo!!!!!!111...im so fukin

the gms would of let me rOOl ur little world.....whining bitch ass
lamurs.....u all suk.....im quitting uo and going to everquest....c u
around lamUrs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</P>

<P>1. Lord British trains his guards in the tactics used by tank thieves.
He sends in a squad of his best men to fight the Zog Cabal head on. Here
we see Edward the Guard, Thomas the Guard, Aurora the Guard, and Wilson
the Guard (Wilson's new to the guard business). They are now encountering
 Zog, the leader of Zog Cabal.</P>

<P>Zog: Ahhh, Lord British's personal goons.</P>
<P>Edward: Come quietly, or we shall use force!</P>
<P>Zog: No, I shall not go anywhere with thee!</P>
<P>Thomas: OK, now men!</P>
<P>You see Edward attempting to steal a rune to kewl magic weapon vendor
from Zog.</P>
<P>You see Thomas attempting to steal a revealing photo of Lord British
from Zog.</P>
<P>You see Aurora attempting to steal a winning Dr. Pepper lid from Zog.</P>
<P>Zog: Guards!</P>
<P>Wilson: Thou shall regret thine actions swine!</P>
<P>Wilson: Thou shall regret thine actions swine!</P>
<P>Wilson: Thou shall regret thine actions swine!</P>
<P>You see: a corpse of Edward</P>
<P>You see: a corpse of Thomas</P>
<P>You see: a corpse of Aurora</P>
<P>Wilson: oops</P>

<P>After said encounter, the members of the Zog Cabal laugh themselves into
a coma. Of course, British covers up the truth and reports that his
highly trained, elite force of guards have destroyed the threat.</P>
<P>________________________________________________________________________</P>

<P>     So, would ya want me writing the new storylines for UO? </P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo,Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Master Tank Mage who completely understands why Zog
Cabal wants to see Britannia destroyed</P>
