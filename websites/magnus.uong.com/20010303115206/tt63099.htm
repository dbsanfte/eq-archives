<P>Newsgroupers the world over!,</P>

<P>We interrupt this newsfeed to bring you an important newscast. This is
WOOC reporting. Your personal out of character news. Here are the top
ten news stories this evening.</P>

<P>10. A recent report by the Healers of Grace (HOG) announced that
prolonged exposure to Spirit of Wolf results in accelerated hair growth
in the ears and nose, uncontrollable urge to howl at the moon and play
cheesy first person shooting arcade games from the eighties, and total
loss of the parts of the brain that control language. </P>
<P>*cut scene: a wizard in a strait jacket*</P>
<P>Wizard: neone wolf me plz?</P>

<P>9. The top intellects in the ogre community recently discovered after
months of research that Qeynos spelled backwards is SonyEQ. They're still not sure what this means but they're working on it as we speak. </P>

<P>8. Allegations of cheating have already been made against the druid
Sugahray after he won his ninth strait Run Against Rabies marathon
victory today. It's long been thought that the druid was usuing magical
means to get from Freeport to Qeynos and today's record time of 4
minutes makes that seem very likely the case in some people's minds. An
investigation is planned. </P>
<P>Sugahray: i just zone really fast </P>

<P>7. Two aviak music acts are giving back to the community this week. This
weekend only, for a small donation to the Aviak Chick Fund, you can
watch the Byrds, and Sheryl Crow perform live at the Arena. The funds
from their concert will go towards water slides and jet skis for the
Lake Rathetear Home for Orphaned Chicks.</P>

<P>6. In other entertainment news, EverQuest's Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 will
soon be shipping to local merchants. On this must have CD for
collector's you'll find....</P>
<P>"What Would U Pay?" by Eight Platinum Band</P>
<P>"EQ Topless" by Barenaked Woodelves</P>
<P>"neone c my bdoy?" by bloo swade newb</P>
<P>"Shaman Shakedown" by The Association of Sherman Shamans</P>
<P>"age/sex/loc?" by OOC: 14/M</P>
<P>And many, many more!</P>

<P>5. Here's Windblown with tonight's weather report.</P>
<P>Windblown: If you got rain yesterday, you got it today and you'll get it
tomorrow. There's a 90% chance of thunderstorms occuring lagging your
system at a critical moment. There's a 75% chance that your thought the
storms were 'kinda kewl' the first time you saw them. There's a 70%
chance that you don't think they're so great anymore. And there's a 100%
chance that Brad McQuaid will disagree with all this.</P>

<P>4. There's a new faction in Norrath this week. The RP Nazi group, as
named by Driakos, has established itself within the faction system.
Offenses that will lower your faction with the RP Nazis, include but sure as hell aren't limited to:</P>
<P>-powergaming</P>
<P>-telling Spice Girl jokes (discovered by Driakos)</P>
<P>-not using thee or thou at least once per sentence</P>
<P>-shouting 'BOAT!' every forty five seconds in Halas</P>
<P>-emoting ": digs in ear with giant snake fang and wipes on robe"</P>
<P>-using the words 'experience' or 'points'</P>
<P>-auctioning 'selling those steel ball thingies that clack together and
sit on people's desks!'</P>
<P>-anything else the RP Nazis deem offensive or in direct contribution to
the ruination of their online roleplaying environment</P>

<P>3. A new enchanter spell has been discovered. Illusion: Hill Giant. Have
fun all you responsible enchanters out there!</P>

<P>2. A bug was discovered with the recent roleplaying switch that was
added a few weeks ago. It seems some players have found a means to turn
on the switches of other players. We go live to Soultrain the bard.
Soultrain was one of the first victims of this bug. Soultrain, please
tell our viewers about it.</P>
<P>Soultrain: verily thsi doth sukest mightly..shuldst i e'er find wherfore
art thou taht dids't this to me,,,i shalt adminster a most unholy ass
whipping 'pon there person...i cnat even utter my old mantra 'WTF'
without the aid of the magical 'OOC'....such completeness of sentince
structurs also taxeth my abilites...VERANT THOU MATRIARCHIAL FORNICATING
CHILDREN OF UNMARRIED FEMALE DOGS, AMEND THY CODE NOW OR I SHALT
DEPARTETH FROM THSI LAND AND INTO TEH LAND OF BETA FOR AC VERILY!</P>

<P>1. A barbarian has been taken into custody by police this week for
assault. Ravynn the shaman was arrested in EverFrost peaks this morning.</P>
<P>Ravynn maintains his innocence.</P>
<P>*Scene shifts to a barbarian behind bars with a polar bear hat on. A
Nike Swoosh decorates one side of his head gear.*</P>
<P>Reporter: Mr. Ravynn, what happened yesterday afternoon?</P>
<P>Ravynn: That warrior asked, "can u cast spit of wolf on me" so I
summoned my best lupine loogie and ....er.... cast it at him.</P>


<P>That's all the news for this evening. This has been a service of WOOC
news. We're the only news cast that claims to be out of character. Good
night everyone!</P>
