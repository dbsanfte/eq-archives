<H1 align="center">Verily, I doth suck</H1>
<P>I suck. In fact, I suck more than terms can give thee out. On a
scale of 1 to 10, (10 being the suckiest), I would score a 54. I
transcend suckiness. I surpass it and make it an art form. I suck soooo
bad....</P>

<P>Crowd of Britannians: How bad dost thou suck?</P>

<P>     I suck more than the entire staff of interns at the White House.</P>
     
<P>     How did I come to terms with my legendary suckiness? It happened
this afternoon. However, before I begin I must explain something.</P>
<P>     In early December, I became extremely bored with the combat aspects
of Ultima (monster and PvP) and decided to try other things. You may be
surprised, but there are actually quite a few things besides combat to
UO. I know I was. Since early December, I have chopped, carpentered,
bowyered, begged, mined, dined, smithed, alchemied, and forensic
evaluated. That's not important though. What's important is that I did
everything to avoid combat of any type.</P>
<P>     The old saying was never truer, "You don't use it, you lose it." I
found that out this afternoon. I had decided to give Lake Superior a
second shot and started happily killing deer with my newbie guy. </P>

<P>Magnus: These deer are tougher than I remember.</P>
<P>Magnus: I'm low on life, I should run I guess.</P>
<P>Magnus: That's odd. I seemed to be lagged.</P>
<P>'Connection Lost'</P>
<P>'Reconnecting'</P>
<P>Welcome to Ultima Online.</P>
<P>You are dead.</P>
<P>a hind: u suk, i pked ur newbie ass!111 LOL</P>

<P>     So, I was killed by a deer! Big deal! That deer was probably a
cheating SPAM crasher. I'll just go somewhere else and kill deer. Oh
yes! I've only been to the new lands five or six times since I upgraded.
Why don't I go there?</P>
<P>     I decided to try an entrance I'd never been through before. The Yew
prison sounds good. 'recsu' Nice looking lighthouse! I walk to the door
and step out. Mean looking wyvern! 'You are dead.'</P>

<P>Wyvern: hahahahahah you must suck or something</P>

<P>     So, I got killed by a wyvern! Big deal! I'm just using a newbie
character with 45 strength! If I had my grandmaster mage on Catskills
and a few crates, I'd show that wyvern a thing or two! Well, I suppose
getting ressurected would be the smartest thing to do.</P>
<P>     Have I ever mentioned that I HATE the geography in the new lands? I
know the breaks make the land area seem bigger but the ups and downs and
rivers and cliffs and brambles make it awfully hard to walk. Enough
ranting, I'm in Papua and I am brought back to life. Time to rok some
deer ass!</P>
<P>     Thirty minutes later, all is well. I've been killing deer and I've
even worked up to mongbats. Leather lingerie for everyone! As a matter
of fact, I'm sorry that I didn't name myself 'Leatherhead' or
'DeerSlaya' or 'UnderwearPimp'.</P>
<P>     It didn't last. I hear a harpy screech. I see a harpy. See harpy
attack Magnus. See Magnus run! Run Magnus, run! Run, run, run Magnus!
See harpy Magnus? See three brambles next to cliff? See Magnus foolishly
think cliff wall is climbable. Magnus is trapped! See Magnus go 'OoOo OO
OoOOooOo'. Harpy says, "See? Magnus sucks." </P>
<P>     So I got killed by a harpy? Big deal! I'm still a newbie! I was
trapped! A lot of those cliff walls look like slopes you can walk up!
And that annoying Dick and Jane narration that was going on was
distracting me!</P>
<P>     I ran to Papua. (Again!) I ressurected. (Again!) I said, "Ok, I'm
going to get Big Daddy Magnus and we'll see what happens in round two." I
log off from Lake Superior and log on to Catskills. A few preparations
and Magnus the lazy, overweight town mage is back to the old Magnus.
He's now Magnus, slayer of wisps, kicker of ettin, troll, orc, gargoyle
ass. Feeling like a real tank mage now, I recall to the Moonglow mage
shop.</P>
<P>     I want to comment on something here. Who thought it was a good idea
to put a teleporter in the mage shop? Couldn't it have been into a place
where people don't normally go? (Like a butcher shop or a produce
store?) I'm in the crowded mage shop. I have to weave my way through
people in bone armor screaming, "vendor buy bank guards" and NPCs who
block the one tile wide aisle three deep. </P>
<P>     "Owen move", I say. "I don't understand." Owen says. </P>
<P>Magnus: Owen move.</P>
<P>Owen: To think that I met thee and talked with thee! I shall have tale
to tell my children!</P>
<P>Magnus: Want those kids to be orphaned?</P>
<P>Owen: I don't understand thee.</P>
<P>Magnus: Look pal! You aren't as untouchable as you'd like to think.
Would you understand a deadly poisoned dagger?</P>
<P>Owen: Thou makest no sense.</P>
<P>*Magnus looks at full stamina*</P>
<P>Being perfectly well rested, you shove Owen out of the way.</P>
<P>Magnus: Hah! On to Jay!</P>
<P>Magnus: Jay move.</P>
<P>Jay: Eh? I don't understand.</P>
<P>Magnus: The same goes for you tough guy.</P>
<P>Jay: Thou art truely wonderful but thy words go over my head.</P>
<P>*Full stamina again*</P>
<P>Being perfectly well rested, you shove Jay out of the way.</P>
<P>Magnus: Haha! Only one more left. What's her name so I can ask her to
move?</P>
<P>You see: Araelintiasestellomentosthefreshmaker the mage</P>
<P>Magnus: *sigh* *Waits for stamina rather than trying to respell that*</P>
<P>* Shoves the final mage out of the way *</P>
<P>Magnus: I am free! Woohooo! Onto Papua.</P>
<P>You see: Wuzzup, [bitch beeter, PoT][chaos] run into the mage shop.<p>
<P>* Magnus thinks, "Let's see how Mr. Kewlio here fares with getting
through the NPC blockage."*</P>
<P>Wuzzup: Rel Por *Wuzzup appears on other side*</P>
<P>Magnus: Doh!</P>
<P>     So, the kewlio did it faster than I did! Big deal! I talked with
the NPCs and created atmosphere! I uhm.. forgot about teleport, ok?</P>
<P>     No more worrying about that though. I was through the NPC picket
line and I was going to kill some monsters. "Recsu" and I was off to
Papua. Strolling through the woods, I encountered ettins and trolls. I
actually did some killing for a change. One time, I finished off a troll
and saw a reaper. "Easy pickins'", quoth the Magnus. So, it was with 40
hitpoints left that I tackled the reaper.</P>
<P>     "Corp Por", I chanted and the little wiggly line slammed into the
tree. The tree responded with a fireball. Since when do reapers shoot
fireballs? Oh well, no biggie, it was just a fireball. I fired another
energy bolt. The reaper said, "Oh, ya like energy bolts huh? Well,
here's two right back at ya!" I said, "Ooo OOOooO oOoOoO". (It really
sounded better in my head.) The reaper replied with, "Bwahahahahah  I
can't even move and I whipped your sorry ass. You must really suck."</P>
<P>     So I was killed by a reaper! Big deal! Wait a minute. Did I just
say I was killed by a reaper? With my Grandmaster Tank Mage character? I
must suck. Well, I guess I'll take another run to Papua and see if I can
get back before my stuff decays.</P>
<P>     Three screens from my body, I saw a player named Godzilla. Oh well,
no hope of getting anything back, I guess. I deserved to lose it all
anyway. After all, now I officially suck.</P>
<P>     My sucky ghost ran back to Papua and was ressurected by the healer.
The healer, surprised to see me again, said, "Damn boy, what are you, a
bank thief?" I didn't even respond. I couldn't think of anything to say
back that wouldn't suck. </P>
<P>     I started back towards where my body was. I was hoping I might get
the sew kit or an empty bottle back. I passed a wisp who offered, "Vg
Nxy Vyg Mn". "Shut up! I was killed by a reaper and I'm not in the
mood." I interrupted. The wisp laughed, "Hahahah a reaper? What kind of
a tank mage are you? You must suck big time!"</P>
<P>     I got back to the spot where my body lay, and I found it
undisturbed. I certainly didn't deserve that little bit of luck. I
gathered my equipment and recalled to the teleporter, went through it, and walked to the
Moonglow bank. </P>
<P>     Well, I suck but at least I got all my stuff back. I started
sorting through the ettin and troll loot. Hmm, lots of purple potions.
It seems that wierd lag is starting again. There's another purple
potion. More lag. Another purple potion.</P>
<P>"You should throw it now!"</P>
<P>Magnus: NO I DIDN'T DOUBLE CLICK IT!</P>
<P>"3"</P>
<P>"2"</P>
<P>"1"</P>
<P>*You are attacking BOOGERKING*</P>
<P>*You are attacking The KotexKid*</P>
<P>BOOGERKING: vendor buy a bank guard!</P>
<P>Gavin: Thou shall regret thine actions swine!</P>
<P>"You are dead."</P>
