<p align="left">Last year's installment of the WetCondom saga
pitted the Avatar WetCondom against the mage pk MERLIN. l33t h4ck4h,
the leader of the 8 pks, has sent SupahDupe, the dungeon blocker,
and FuzzyBallz, the tamer to dispatch WetCondom. Has l33t h4ck4h
finally had enough? Is this a brilliant plan to put an end to WC,
once and for all or is it something far more sinister? Like, a
thinly veiled attempt by myself to end the story faster.</p>

<hr>

<p>The celebration at British's castle lasted well into the night.
The king had too much to drink as usual and spent the better part
of the evening singing karaoke versions of his favorite B52s
songs. Most of the guests agreed that the highlight of the night
was when Blackthorn took a bathroom break and forgot to turn his
com crystal off. You missed most of this since you are several
years away from drinking age and have a strict curfew of 9PM. </p>

<p>When you wake the next day, you head to British's castle to
find out what do next. You discover British sleeping in the floor
in front of his throne. His legs are resting in the seat of the
throne and he is wearing boxer shorts and tube socks. A second
pair of boxer shorts from an unknown source are on his head. </p>

<p>British jumps when you wake him and wipes his eyes as he pulls
the shorts from his head, offering no explanationexcept, &quot;WC..u
missed one hell of a party last nite&quot; You reply, &quot;doh...well
neway waht do i do now?/&quot; British frowns, &quot;well, is
ther any word of pks thsi morning??&quot; You shake your head and
British continues, &quot;damn. if we had one of those strat
guides like mangus does we could beat thsoe pks easy.&quot;
&quot;y dont we ask magnus 4 his?&quot;, you ask. British quickly
says, &quot;no..that asshole has alredy tkaen enough from me...we
cant ask him&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;who else would have one?&quot; British sighs, &quot;i
dunno...wait! designer dragon!! he helped build the world,, he
cna probably help!&quot; You say, &quot;doesnt he work 4 someoen
else now?&quot; &quot;doesnt matter...were close friends...he'll
help u&quot; &quot;but wher is he?&quot;, you ask. &quot;destard...tahts
wher all the dragons are&quot; You nod as you locate your rune to
Destard and recall.</p>

<p>You appear near a cave entrance marked with a wooden sign that
reads, &quot;Herein lies the dungeon Destard. Since OSI nerfed
Blade Spirits, mortal danger lies within. Thou should'st not
enter for death awaits you with big nasty pointy teeth.&quot;*
You ignore the sign and guide your horse into the cave.</p>

<p>* I feel lots better now that the necessary Monty Python
reference has been made.</p>

<p>Upon entering, you are greeted with the sight of 5 dragons
seated around a television. From the sounds that you catch
between roaring laughs, it appears that they're watching &quot;America's
Funniest Home Videos&quot;. Every time Bob Saget tells a &quot;joke&quot;,
the dragons immediately echo it 9 or 10 times, laugh
hysterically, and pretend to kick each other in the crotch. You
sneak around behind them and continue making your way through the
cave.</p>

<p>Finally, at the back of the cave, a sign outside of a small
chamber reads, &quot;Designer Dragon, 'I don't gots to show you
any steenkin' patches!'&quot; You enter to see a dragon sitting
at a computer. He turns when he sees you. &quot;And who are you?&quot;
he asks. &quot;im teh avatar, wetcondom, brtish sent me 2 ask u 4
help&quot; The dragon asks, &quot;What do you want from me?&quot;
You reply, &quot;all i need is a strategy guide 4 thsi game&quot;
He laughs, &quot;Is that all? Well here it is.&quot; He moves
several Star Wars novels aside and hands you a dusty book that
reads, &quot;Ye Olde Tome o' Strategy&quot; Designer Dragon
continues, &quot;Normally, I'd make you do a quest or something
that would teach you the benefits of online communities, but I'm
kind of busy right now with a new project.&quot; He continues,
&quot;and, oh yeah, I ripped the last few pages out so it
wouldn't be too easy for you.&quot; You thank him and recall back
to British's castle.</p>

<p>British has dressed and is enjoying his breakfast of Spaghetti
O's covered in mustard. His mouth is surrounded by a circle of
orange sauce. When you appear, he looks up and inquires about the
book. You wave it and he takes it from you. He begins reading
aloud, with the sauce drying on his face. &quot;after thou hast
returned 'ye olde tome o' strategy' to lord british, thou shalt
recieve a call on thy com crystal. it shalt be a call from thy
old friend sperminator.&quot; The com crystal in your pack begins
ringing.</p>

<p>Sperminator's voice sounds desperate. &quot;wetcondom!! u have
2 hurry...pks at covtous!!!&quot; Before you can answer, the
crystal goes silent. &quot;waht does teh guide say about teh
fite?&quot; you ask. British continues reading, &quot;thou
shouldst head to covetous but beware, l33t h4ck4h has sent
SupahDupe <em>and </em>FuzzyBallz to stop thee. individually,
these pks art easy to kill. SupahDupe is a dungeon blocking PK
and FuzzyBallz hath a tamed nitemare. to win this fight, you must
scare SupahDupe away and then turn FuzzyBallz greatest weapon
against him. you will lose a friend, but gain a new one.&quot;
You ask, &quot;tahts all it says?&quot; British says, &quot;yeah,
teh next page says 'wait six months for the next story to be
written'.&quot; You say, &quot;dman i hate strat guides taht dont
tell u how 2 win/!&quot; </p>

<p>British agrees, &quot;Yeh well we haev 2 think, waht r dungeon
blocking pks afraid of?&quot; You think for a little while and
suddenly shout, &quot;ANTI-PKS!&quot; British startles, spilling
his bowl of pasta but takes no notice. He says, &quot;wetcondom!
tahts brilliant heer is the strat guide back..u kno waht 2 do now&quot;
He places the strategy guide, which is now covered in orange and
yellow fingerprints, in your hands. You recall to Covetous to
begin the showdown.</p>

<p>Appearing at some distance from the dungeon Covetous, you
dismount your horse 'a' and begin running to the entrance on foot.
Just as the book said, SupahDupe is waiting there with a fresh
bolt in his crossbow. He starts to take aim at you, but you
shout, &quot;ANTI PKS ARE COMING!!!!&quot; Through years of
conditioning, SupahDupe hits his recall macro without thinking
and vanishes. </p>

<p>A man on a horse steps out from the dungeon to see what all
the fuss is about. He is FuzzyBallz, and he is riding a horse
that is nearly as dark as the Tru Black Jester Tunic of the
Avatar(TM) that you yourself wear.FuzzyBallz looks around for his
friend but finds only you. He snarls, &quot;DIE U FAG!&quot; and
then screams, &quot;ALL KILL!&quot; The nite mare that he rides
bucks and shoots a flame at you that knocks you to the ground.
You stand up, burned all over and check your health bar. It's
down to 10%. You quickly swallow a heal potion and begin running
for your horse.</p>

<p>Just as you are nearing 'a', the nite mare runs past you and
steps between you and your horse. FuzzyBallz again shouts, &quot;ALL
KILL&quot; but the black horse ignores him. It seems his nite
mare is more interested in your horse 'a'. He tries to walk over
to her but FuzzyBallz reins him hard and hit him on the head all
the while screaming, &quot;ALL KILL&quot;. The nite mare finally
has enough and bucks the pk off his back. You stand motionless.
The nite mare begins muzzling 'a' as FuzzyBallz screams at him.
Finally, FuzzyBallz, in a fit of anger, shoots an energy bolt at
'a' that kills her in one hit. The nite mare turns, anger
flashing in his eyes. He unleashes a swarm of fire that engulfs
FuzzyBallz and leaves him as a smoking corpse on the ground.</p>

<p>You rush to your fallen horse and begin swearing. &quot;taht
damned pk killed my fukin horse...l33t h4ck4h THIS IS PERSONAL
NOW BITCH!&quot; The nite mare walks next to you and begins
nudging you with his nose. You get up and he allows you to pet
his nose. &quot;well, wahts ur name?&quot; you say as you hit All-names.
Before you stands, woopass, the nite mare and you see the words
above his head, &quot;woopass seems to accept you as master.&quot;
It's hard to hide your surprise and happiness and you shout
&quot;hell yeah! a nite mare!&quot; </p>

<p>You climb into woopass's saddle and say &quot;woopass kill&quot;.
The targetting cursor appears and you wait. It's not a long wait
and SupahDupe appears with a crackle. Before he can even say
&quot;WTF?&quot;, he recieves the same treatment as his friend
and is soon dead and smoking on the ground next to him. You jump
down and find the kewl reg from each of the pk's packs. A 'can o'
woop ass' from FuzzyBallz and 'dOOped gold' from SupahDupe. Back
to Lord British's castle you go, this time atop woopass.</p>

<p>British complements your new horse and takes the kewl regz
from you. He grins, &quot;tahts 5 down, ur almost ther!&quot; You
smile, &quot;yeh now all we haev 2 do is wait 6 months 4 teh next
story&quot;</p>

<p>The scene shifts to the PK Palace, where l33t h4ck4h is
addressing his remaining men. &quot;we haev 2 stop this avatar
now! if he gets all these regz that fool birtish will be able 2
cast teh UOTWO spell and u kno waht that means? it means a damn
pk switch..teh good news is taht they r useless 2 him until he
gets all 8.,.teh bad news is, he has our only nite mare&quot;
KrimKillah, the notopk stands. He says, &quot;l33t, i have a plan...all
we gotta do is trick him into going grey in a crowded area and
well have all teh help we need killing him&quot; l33t says,
&quot;how do u plan 2 do that?&quot; KrimKillah answers, &quot;tahts
