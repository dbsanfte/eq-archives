<H1 align="center">Too Much EQ</H1>     
</HEAD>

<P>Today started the first day of the new spring quarter for me. All
during spring break I had EQ on my mind most of the time. Its results
were painfully obvious today as I re-entered society. Let me describe
today's events.</P>
<P>     When I got up this morning, I put on my kilt and my bear hat. I
opened my backpack and threw some muffins and some beer in there for
later. Then I began the twenty mile run to the campus. It was more
tiring than usual and surprisingly I didn't get attacked by any gnoll
pups and spiders. There was a mean looking garbage man but I have my PvP
switch off and wasn't worried. </P>
<P>     I got to the school and remembered that I needed to see if the
bookstore had a book that I needed. I ran at a full sprint through the
book store. People were really staring. I think they were looking at the
blue paint smeared on my chest that said, "Big Sexy". They didn't have the book I needed so I
shouted through the zone, "DOES NEONE HAVE THE EE300 BOOK 4 SALE??//" 
No one answered me. They just backed away.</P>
<P>     So I ran back across the book store to the desk. I accidently went
too far and wound up climbing up on the counter. No biggie, I just looked
down and asked the lady if they had the book for EE 300. She seemed
shocked but she didn't say anything about me standing on the table. I
don't know if it was the club I was holding or the fact that she could
see up my kilt. They didn't have the book in yet but it was going to
cost about 1000 platinum. "since i cant rok noobie lamers nemore guess ill have to 
kill sum more spiders", I told her. She said, "Uhm yeah."</P>
<P>     I realized that I would have to just go to class without the book.
I sprinted out of the bookstore and out across the parking lot. The
street was really full of people trying to PK other people with cars. I
remembered that my switch was still off so I bravely stepped out into
the busy street. I think they're must be some kind of bug because those
PKs came awfully close to hitting me. I'm sure they could have gotten me
if they wanted to.</P>
<P>     Anyway, as I was running across the campus, I passed the tennis
courts and saw some elvin women playing tennis. They had to be elves
because they had on really short shorts and bikini tops. I stopped and
stared. One saw me and walked over and asked me what the hell I was
doing. "Why aren't your ears pointed, are you a half elf?", I asked. "What?", she 
said as I stared at her chest. I walked around behind her and looked her up and down.
"What the hell are you doing!" she shouted. "im jsut checkin out ur equipment", I said.
She said, "You are one sick bastard." and slapped me. I was surprised. I
must have turned my PK switch on by mistake. I'm still only a
level three barbarian, so I ran. </P>
<P>     Anyway, I found the classroom that I was supposed to be in. There
were chairs everywhere! WTF? I can't sit in chairs. I found a spot and
crossed my legs and sat in the floor. Then, I couldn't see so I climbed
up onto one of the tables and sat down. </P>
<P>     The professor walked in and looked at me for a long time. I said,
"WTF R U staring at??" He said, "Nothing, nothing at all." He started
his lecture and all was going well until I got really hungry. Then I
remembered the beer and muffins. I opened my back pack and started
eating. The professor looked at me again. "im hungry", I explained. He
just shook his head and continued.</P>
<P>     The class went on without much excitement. I practiced sense
direction while I was sitting there. I would try to guess which way I
was facing. I got tired of facing east, so I turned and faced south. The
girl sitting in the chair next to where I was looked worried. I
told her that this class was boring and I was using the time to work on
some skills. I thought I'd made sure that I'd TOLD her so no one else
would hear it. I must have messed up because everyone turned and looked
at me again. The professor told me to get out or he was calling the
univeristy police. "r tehy liek teh grauds??" I asked.</P>
<P>     Then, he started walking towards me with a yardstick. I remembered
the incident with the PK elves at the tennis courts and thought surely
this old guy was a level 20 or better. I ran out of the classroom and
onto the street. Hmm, maybe I can find something to do. I found a statue
not far from the tennis courts. I climbed up on it and watched the PK
elves some more. Then, a guy in a uniform with a badge asked me to come
down. I did and he threw me into a car and now I'm trapped inside a tiny
room with bars. Do GMs handle this kind of thing?</P>
