<P>1. *Magnus is standing around a popular bank*</P>
<P>   *Magnus gets caught in the grip of awful lag*</P>
<P>   *Magnus sits idly at computer*</P>
<P>   *Magnus gets a magazine*</P>
<P>   *Magnus reads for awhile*</P>
<P>   *The lag passes, the screen lights up with dialogue*</P>
<P>   IMMATURE:LAG!!!</P>
<P>   INAHURRY:LAAAAAAAAAAAAAG!!!!</P>
<P>   INAHURRY:LAAAAAAAAAAAAAG!!!!</P>

<P>   SlowPoke:Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggggggggggggggggggggg!!!!</P>
<P>   DeAtHdEaLeR:LAAAAAAGGG!!! %#$^ OSI!</P>
   
<P>Now, I'm no expert in the programming of on-line games (probably not even journeyman) but it seems that
maybe the word "lag" causes quite a bit of the dreaded phenomenon.
People we know what's affecting us, we wanted to keep it a secret from
the newbies and make them think it was a slowmotion feature. Thanks for
ruining my fun!</P>

<P>2. NewGuy: Magnus!</P>
<P>   Magnus: Yes?</P>
<P>   NewGuy: How do I make money?</P>
<P>   Magnus: Well you have to have a marketable skill.</P>
<P>   NewGuy: Like what?</P>
<P>   Magnus: Well Carpentry and Tailoring are pretty profitable.</P>
<P>   NewGuy: Cool what do I do?</P>
<P>   Magnus: You mean besides leaving me alone?</P>
<P>   NewGuy: Huh?</P>
<P>   NewGuy: Look, I just wanna learn how to play this game.</P>
<P>   Magnus: Then go buy a $%^* strategy guide. Or better yet call a GM and
tell him you need some help. Tell him that you're stuck. He shouldn't
take too long to get here. He'll help you out.</P>
 
<P>Does anyone else feel my pain? Should I consider gating him to the
Daemon's Tailor Shop in Hythloth?</P>

<P>3.  Not really a gripe so much as a question. OK, the ritual for
summoning something now takes as long as getting your order filled at
Hardee's but why is Create Food unaffected? Where are all those summoned
hams coming from? I always imagine a honey baked ham store somewhere
that's being driven out of business because their merchandise keeps
disappearing.</P>

<P>4. *Magnus recalls into the Ocllo bank*</P>
<P>   You see: no bankers</P>
<P>   IMMaTuRe: Bank</P>
<P>   IMMaTuRe: Bank</P>
<P>   IMMaTuRe: BANK!!! (As if CAPITAL LETTERS WILL SOMEHOW HELP!!!)</P>
<P>   IMMaTuRe: BANK DAMMIT!! (Now he's swearing. They'll know he's pissed and do something about it now)</P>
<P>   IMMaTuRe: Dammit, what's wrong?</P>
<P>I'm going to go out on a limb here but I'm guessing that IMMaTuRe hasn't
quite grasped certain concepts, ideas, and general perceptions that the
rest of us refer to as common sense. Please don't think that I am
defending the NPC bankers though. One day at work, I decided to to
pretend I was an NPC. I wandered aimlessly around the store that I work
in and ignored anyone who didn't call me by name or call me vendor. I
also wandered out in the parking lot some and almost got home before I
respawned back in the store. Strangely enough, my boss said nothing to
me about it.</P>

<P>5. Another question. Just what do the beggars do with the money we give
them? I have a working theory. It's Alcohol! Who else could be buying
the stuff from the inns? Every once in a while I take a bag full of the
finest ales and wines to the inn to sell and the innkeeper is always
more than happy to buy from me. I guess the beggars keep him in business
since people seem to stay at his inn for free. So give to beggars if you
want to continue logging out safely. (It makes more sense than the
beggar's guild)</P>

<P>6. *Magnus is walking through a busy dungeon*</P>
<P>   You see: DeadGuy (who is dead of course ;-\)</P>
<P>   You see: Jack Schitt</P>
<P>   You see: As Shole</P>
<P>   Dead Guy: OooO OOoo OoooO OOoo</P> 
<P>   Jack Schit: HAA HAA !! What a moron! OOooO oOoO o</P>
<P>   As Shole: Yeah what a idiot! Oooo OooO</P>
<P>   Magnus: One sec DeadGuy, I'll activate spirit speak.</P>
<P>   You make contact with the netherworld. </P>
<P>   Magnus: Ok DeadGuy, what happened? </P>
<P>   DeadGuy: There are about 20 PKers up ahead in the third level.</P>
<P>   Really strong ones.</P>
<P>   Magnus: I'm sorry to hear that.</P>
<P>   Jack Schit: HAHAHHA  OOooOO OOOooO OOO </P>
<P>   As Shole: OOoo OO OOoo Ooo </P>
<P>   As Shole: Wait a minute. Who are you talking to Magnus?</P>
<P>   Magnus: I am talking to the ghost you are mocking.</P>
<P>   DeadGuy: Those bastards.</P>
<P>   Jack Schit: You mean you understand him?</P>
<P>   Magnus: Yes, that's usually a requirement when one is conversing with another person.</P>
<P>   As Shole: Well what's he say?</P>
<P>   DeadGuy: Tell them to $@#$ off. (Can't blame the guy for being ill, but watch what happens next)</P>
<P>   Magnus: He said that he was carrying a lot of loot out of the 3rd   
level and got lagged and was killed by a scorpion. He wants one of us   
to get his stuff for him.</P>
<P>   DeadGuy: HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA!!!!!</P>
<P>   As Shole: What's he say now?</P>
<P>   Magnus: He says you can have all the gold he was carrying if you
go and get it. It was almost 2 K he says.</P>
<P>   DeadGuy: ROFLMAO (which for those of you who don't know, Rolling
on the floor laughing my ass off)</P>
<P>   As Shole: Kewl! Let's go check it out!</P>
<P>   Jack Schit: I'll go, but I want half of the money.</P>
<P>   As Shole: You coming Magnus?</P>
<P>   Magnus: Nah. You guys go ahead. I'm gonna try to res this guy!</P>
<P>   DeadGuy: Magnus you are too cool.</P>
<P>   As Shole: What's he say now?</P>
<P>   Magnus: He said good luck and we'll see you in a few minutes.</P>
 
<P>I don't know what happened to poor Jack Schit and As Shole because I
gated DeadGuy to a healer and followed to chat for a few minutes.
Whatever fate befell them, I feel almost sure it took them the better
part of a day to figure out how 20 dreadlords beat them to the loot.</P>
  
<P>7. *Magnus is in Cove looking for an escort quest or two*</P>
<P>   You see: Rich Hog</P>
<P>   You see: NPC FOLLOWER 1</P>
<P>   You see: NPC FOLLOWER 2</P>
<P>   You see: NPC FOLLOWER 3</P>
<P>   You see: NPC FOLLOWER 4</P>
<P>          .</P>
<P>          .</P>
<P>          .</P>
<P>   You see: NPC FOLLOWER 392</P>
<P>   You see: It's time to look in another city</P>
 
<P>I enjoy escort quests. They are a good way to make some quick money
if you can gate and have a large selection of town runes, but I've never
taken more than 4 or 5 at one time. There comes a time to stop and be a
little more considerate of the people around you. For instance: Don't
run around the entire perimeter of Skara Brae saying, "I will take
thee." every few steps and then after you've got your congregation
gathered, realize that *gasp* you're out of black pearl. Then it becomes
a matter of trying to navigate 20 - 30 NPCs into and out of the Magic
shop. The Out part is considerably more difficult as NPCs are pretty
stupid when it comes to following and tend to get stuck on small pieces
of furniture, which shops seem to have in abundance.</P>

<P>8. You see: Newbie</P>
<P>   You see: NoToKiLLa</P>
<P>   Newbie: Magnus! Be careful! That guy attacked and killed me for no   
reason. </P>
<P>   NoToKiLLa: So what? You were grey. Why not kill you? It's
perfectly legal in the game.</P>
<P>   Magnus: It may be legal NoTo but it's not very considerate.</P>
<P>   NoToKiLLa: I don't care. Grey = Dead in my book.</P>
<P>   Magnus: Is that so? Well guess what. I have a surprise.</P>
<P>  NoToKiLLa: You won't attack me you'll lose note.</P>
<P>   Magnus: In Jux Hur Ylem</P>
<P>   Magnus: No I won't attack you but this blade spirit will and
without those none too good, nasty, noto side effects that you fear
so much. (notice my alliteration? NoToKiLLa didn't)</P>
<P>   You see: A corpse of NoToKiLLa</P>

<P>Alas, it was a justifiable homicide. I should have just taken the noto
hit and Meteor Swarmed the guy, but I enjoy high notoriety. I know that
there are abuses with the current system, but I also know that I got
mine fair and square. Just before NoTo died he said he'd be glad for the
new system. It would stop people like me who PK good characters and get
away with it. I dunno, can't see if I'm in the wrong in this case.
Whatchoo guys think?</P>

<P>9. OK Time for a little self embarrassment. With as much as I talk about
newbies, I was once one myself. One fine day, I killed a troll. (Note:
This was long before the patch that made armor absorb much less damage
and a select few orcs were armed with fireball machineguns) Anyway, I
had killed a troll and I was proud. One thing kept bothering me though.
What in the world was I supposed to do with all this liquor. Then it
strikes me, maybe a tavern. I try the closest one I find to no avail.
Well, I have a seat at one of the benches and start sorting my loot.
Hmm. A purple potion. I wonder what this does. Well, you can probably
figure out what happened next. I learned a valuable lesson that day.
TAVERN OWNERS DON'T BUY LIQUOR!!! Wait a minute. I mean, purple potions
equate to death. It has pshchologically scarred me. Even to this day, if
a monster corpse has a purple potion on it, I leave all the stuff and
have an uncontrollable urge to scream, "OooOO OOOOoOoO"</P>

<P>10. This is one that never fails. For some reason, trying to organize
anything on UO is about as close to impossible as trying to get Hanson
music banned from the radio. (I did get a group of 10 guys in black
plate to all line up one time and use Ctrl B to do a wave, but that's
for another post.) I try to set up a trip to Hythloth with a few
friends. Not too hard you think. Well it usually goes something like
this.</P>
 
<P>Magnus: You guys ready?</p>
<P>Friend 1: Yup</P>
<P>Friend 2: You betcha</P>
<P>Friend 3: wait ICQ</P>
<P>Magnus: OK we'll wait</P>
<P>-A few minutes pass-</P>
<P>Friend 3: back</P>
<P>Friend 2: Wait you guys, I'm almost outta moss, I'll be right back.</P>
<P>Friend 3: OK </P>
<P>-10 minutes later-</P>
<P>Friend 2: Wow, bloodmoss is hard to get.</P>
<P>Magnus: Are we ready to go yet? (Getting agitated)</P>
<P>Friend 1: wait a sec, let me check my regs</P>
<P>Friend 1: Oh #$%^, I'm almost out of silk. I won't be but a sec.</P>
<P>Magnus: DOES ANYONE ELSE NEED TO BUY REGS??? (almost cursing at this
point)</P>
<P>Friend 2: No   settle down Mags</P>
<P>Friend 3: No I'm fine</P>
<P>Magnus: I'm sorry, I'm just tired of waiting for everyone to do their
errands and then everyone runs out of reagents.</P> 
<P>Friend 1: OK back    let's go</P>
<P>*Friend 1 drops rune*</P>
<P>Magnus: Kal Ort Por</P>
<P>More reagents are needed for this spell.</P>
<P>Magnus: Guys, I gotta go. The Weather Channel says there's a
thunderstorm headed my way.</P>
<P></P> 
<P>And so I close another list. I know they are labled wrong but I made
these up as I went along and I didn't know if I could come up with 10
more. Look me up on Catskills and give me an LOL. It's what I live for.</P>

<P>-Magnus (Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Adept Tank Mage and gal darn tired of "Non-Origin
related problems"</P>
