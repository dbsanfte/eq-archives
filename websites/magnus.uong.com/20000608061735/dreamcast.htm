<p align="center"><font size="6">The Dreamcast</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ah, Sega. It's with mixed feelings
that I reflect upon my experiences with Sega products. There's
the sheer joy I had from playing Lunars 1 and 2 on my Sega CD (a
Sega CD exclusive until just recently) or just the sheer fun of
Sega Rally and Virtua Fighter 2 on the Saturn. Then, there's
mydisappoinment in the company. There's the lack of North
American support for the Saturn. Then, there's the 32x, Sega's
little engine that could, but didn't. Sega had a pretty poor plan
going for quite some time with a strategy: 'if you can't beat 'em
with better games, release a new system'. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Just a little bit of history to
explain why I was hesitant about the purchase of a Dreamcast. I
hate being burned over and over by the same company. Anyway, I
did my homework on this one. I checked several sites, making sure
to avoid the magazines with 'Sega' in the title. What I saw
surprised me. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Quite honestly, I expected the
games to be pretty to look at but trash in the area of gameplay
and fun (as many launch titles are, regardless of the system).
When I saw several titles recieving scores of high 8s and 9s from
magazines whose opinions I highly respect, I began to change my
opinion. Maybe Sega's done an about face. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">One game in particular did it for
me. Sega can thank Namco for selling one Dreamcast to yours truly.
The game: Soul Calibur. The pictures of the game are amazing but
when I actually played a demo in a store, the Dreamcast was sold.
About a week ago, I bought mine along with a copy of Soul Calibur,
WWF Attitude (I'll admit to liking prowrestling.), and a magazine
with a demo disc enclosed. Included with the Dreamcast was
another demo disc and a web browser disc for surfing the internet
on your television.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">First of all, the internet access
thingie. If you're reading this, don't throw away your computer
just yet. The interface is clunky. A television screen just can't
compete with even a mediocre SVGA monitor and if you haven't
shelled out for the Dreamcast keyboard, you're in for a
frustrating time as you 'type' on a cartoon keyboard with the
Dreamcast controller.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Speaking of controllers, aren't
they important too? Though I've never been a big fan of Sega
controllers in general, I gotta say the Dreamcast controllers are
surprisingly good. They have two ports for accessories such as
memory cards or rumble packs. Since the slots for these are on
the top, the cord sticks out of the controller from the bottom.
This seems like it would be a problem but Sega saw fit to add a
notch on the bottom of the controller to hold the cord out of the
way. It's not pretty but it works. There are two analog 'triggers'
on the underside of the controller that I particularly like. The
analog stick is nothing special but it does the job well. The
other buttons are laid in the tried and true patterns that
Playstation of Super Nintendo controllers use. My only gripe with
controller in general is the digital control pad. Its edges are
very square in that they have sharp points on the corners. My
thumbs wind up hurting after only a few minutes of using it. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Now for the games. On the demo
discs I have, not too much really stands out. The two F1 racing
games, look great but just don't do it for me in the playability
department. Toy Commander looks like a good rental. Power Stone,
Sega Bass Fishing, and Dynamite Cop are along the 'not bad but
not good enough to buy' games. House of the Dead 2 is a boring
shooter that's frustrating as hell without a gun. The NFL2K
movies just make me want the game even more (All the stores are
sold out around here). Ready2Rumble Boxing will be one that I'll
probably buy. The Virtua Fighter 3 demo stinks. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The demo of Sonic Adventure was
quite a surprise. I played, and enjoyed Sonic the Hedgehog 1, and
Sonic CD (mainly the fantastic soundtrack on the CD version).
After buying Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles and being extremely
disappointed with both of them, I vowed to never buy another
Sonic game again. I feel that if you've played one you've played
'em all. (Please, no hate mail from Sonic fans.) Sonic Adventure
finally seems like something new to the series. Yes, it's still
fly through the level in a set path with hidden stuff scattered
throughout, but the element of real 3d seems to really add
something to it and refresh the series.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">On to the full version games I've
got. WWF Attitude is hard to reccommend to someone who doesn't
like the 'sport'. If you're a fan, you'll get a kick out of it.
The gameplay's not great but not horrible. The ring entrances are
a lot of fun and there's enough hidden stuff and customizations
to keep things interesting. A decent game overall.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Then, there's Soul Calibur. I have
not been as amazed by a game's graphics since I picked up Donkey
Kong country a few years back. The game is gorgeous. The edges of
the characters are smooth curves rather than blocky polygons. The
character's clothing actually looks like something that they're
wearing rather than part of their skin. I can't possibly heap
enough praises on the graphics in this game.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">However, a game that looks good
but has no playability is just a nice looking piece of crap.
Fortunately, Soul Calibur is chock full of solid game play. The
number of moves is astounding. The combos are intuitive and
customizable, not just memorizations a la Mortal Kombat 3. The
fights are also just fun to watch. I had a friend over who is far
more skilled than I and I've never enjoyed getting my ass kicked
so much.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">There are extras. In true Namco
fashion, you unlock characters as you beat the game. There's a
mission mode where you unlock even more extras. There are new
costumes for the characters, an exhibition mode where you watch
the characters strut their stuff in a martial arts demonstration,
and an art gallery with 338 pictures to look at. The mission mode
has you fighting in several situations usually with handicaps.
The challenges are tough but not frustrating. That's a hard line
to stay on but when done, it makes for a very addictive
experience as you just have to try 'one more time' to succeed and
that one more time turns into three more hours of gaming. It
takes a very good game to keep me up until 3AM and Soul Calibur
has done it to me a number of times this week. Sega, you have a
friend in Namco, keep it that way.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">So, do I recommend it? It's a
definite maybe. If you can afford multiple game systems, I'd say
go for it. However, if you've got to pick one system and go with
it, I'd say wait for the Playstation 2 or the Nintendo Dolphin.
Sony has shown they've got what it takes to get the big name
developers to support their hardware and Nintendo's own games (Mario,
Zelda, Metroid, Donkey Kong, Starfox) make their systems worth
buying. </font></p>
