<P>Hola compadres,</P>

<P>     After fighting with my newsreader for a short time, I'm back to
bring another top ten list to the newgroup. Did I miss anything while I
was gone? </P>
<P>     I see the hot topic of this week is the housing patch. (Gosh, and
you all thought it was that impeachment thingie, huh?) Sorry Bill, but
we UO loyalists are more concerned with house security than your
thriving cigar business. (This has got me thinking though, what could we
impeach British for?) OK, I'm rambling again. I know I've done two top
ten lists on the housing patch already, but darn it, I'm gonna do
another one. </P>

<P>________________________________________________________________________</P>

<P>Dear UO players,</P>

<P>     Today we are publishing the third phase of the housing patch. We
have also been working extensively on our website to insure that it
takes no less than ten minutes to fully load. (We're in a competition
with that UOAddicted guy for longest load time!) On the next web page
update, we'll have a WAV file of Wierd Al's Christmas at Ground Zero for
the background music, lots of animated GIFs and other bandwidth hogs. Oh
yeah, that housing thing! Here's the list of changes we managed to
snatch off DD's desk while he was having some Christmas cheer with old
Ricky G.</P>

<P>10. The Claim heirarchy has been restructured somewhat. Here's the new
order from lowest to highest.</P>
<P>---5. Master key holder/Placer</P>
<P>---4. Neil Diamond</P>
<P>---3. StoneCold</P>
<P>---2. Anyone possessing an article of true black clothing</P>
<P>---1. Grandmaster Campers (WE FINALLY MADE THIS SKILL USEFUL!! ON TO
FORENSIC EVAL!!)</P>

<P>9. In order to combat mules, we are deleting any character with the
following names: Taylor, Vendor Sell, Woody, Ima Chopper, My Miner Guy,
MONEY MAN, Ingot Head =) , My PvP Guy, KAIN (and the derivatives
thereof), Rand Al'Thor, Merlin, Big Sexy, and MaStA GrInDa.</P>

<P>8. The new houses can be dyed, banked, stolen, stabled, crafted, eaten,
ground, shaked, baked, burned, turned, and duped. (And it's shaken, not
shaked.)</P>

<P>7. Once, we get the bugs out of the code, bugs will be going into
houses. Homeowners will have to worry about termites, roaches, fireants,
moths, and wasps.</P>

<P>6. The hack that allowed houses to be placed upside down is fixed. This
craze should die just like true black did.</P>

<P>5. True black will be back! Along with true blue, true red, true green,
and other true colors (Reminds me of a song. As a matter of fact the
girl that sang it had funky colored hair like some UO folks.) If we'd
known you people liked these simple colors so much, we'd have just made
the damn game for GameBoy and let you play with others through your link
cables.</P>

<P>4. To eliminate mules from the game, we are taking out all the horses.</P>

<P>3. With our survey we gave last week, we found several players willing
to play Santa Claus characters. They will be allowed free access to any
home and an invulnerability tag. We believe this will not be abused in
the spirit of Christmas. On a side note: If you were one of the lucky
players to get a Santa Claus character, the character MUST be named
Santa Claus. We've had some complaints on names. The following are
UNACCEPTABLE!</P>
<P>SATAN CLAWS</P>
<P>Stone Cold Claus</P>
<P>OSI FUKIN SUX CLAUS</P>
<P>5 4 /\/ + 4   < |_ 4  |_| 5</P>   
<P>SNOT CLAUS</P>

<P>2. Any house that's not been claimed will be deleted and replaced with a
castle.</P>

<P>1. Houses will require maintenence of logs, metal, true black dye tubs
and counselor robes. Any house not maintained will go wild and need to
be retamed. Only grandmaster tamers named DRAGONMAZTA will be able to
tame a wild house. ( Oh give me a home, where the two stories roam!) </P>

<P>     The next six weeks should be interesting to say the least! </P>

<P>     If I don't get another list done this week, I wish all of you a
very happy holiday season. If I do get another list, well, I'll say it
again then.</P>
