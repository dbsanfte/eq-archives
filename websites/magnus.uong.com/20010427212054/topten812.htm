<P>     I managed to attend the Lord British speech at the 'wall' the other
night. I think watching the crowd gathered around was more interesting
than the speech itself. In an effort to up my post count, here's the top
ten things heard at the wall speech, Moonglow, Catskills shard.</P>

there'd be lots!</P>
