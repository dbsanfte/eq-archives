<H1 align="center">Top Ten 8/27</H1>
<P>Hey yo yo yo!,</P>

<P>     I just referred to my calendar and it's been almost a week and a
half since I posted a top ten list. I'm long overdue for one. Here goes.
(Geryn gets the credit for inspiring this one.) </p>
<P>     What follows is a "practical" guide to the "wildlife" of
"Britannia". (Dontcha just love it when people go overboard with
"quotation marks".)</P>
<P>________________________________________________________________________</P>

<P>     In an effort to educate the masses, we here at the Britannian
Institute of Gameparks (B.I.G.) have compiled this list. As you know, we
are Notorious at B.I.G. for bringing you many useful services. Our
services include lag charts, spawn maps, and several polls regarding the
gender of characters versus the gender of the players who control them. </P>
<P>     We are constantly striving to being you up to date information you
can use so, without further ado, we now present 'A Practical Guide to
Britannia's Wildlife'.</P>

<P>10. Binomial Nomenclature (BN): Causi Lagius  </P>
<P>Common names (CNs): hoarders, powergamers, etc....</P>

<P>Members of this species show a great proclivity to gather things.
Whether those things be reagents, armor, weapons, castles, or nude
Richard Simmons' videos, these creatures want them, and in large
quantities. However, they are not to be confused with the more agressive
Causi Crashius or Common Tilde Spammer. We've made great efforts to
study the latter of the two but all attempts have been thwarted as our
field agents always mysteriously lose connection when approaching said
animals. </P>

<P>9. BN: Escortius Mucho</P>
<P>CN: 'I will take thee's, escorters, etc.....</P>

<P>Interesting in this case is the form of 'mind control' that these
creatures exibit. They can be identified by proficiency in magic (namely
the gate spell) and the crowd of 10 + other animals following them.
It's  not known whether hypnosis or pheremones keep the folowers in line
but they tend to follow the leader everywhere. Extremely social, these
creatures are rarely seen alone.    </P>

<P>8. BN: Homo Sapien-Ignoramus</P>
<P>CN: k3wL dOOdz</P>

<P>By no means rare and even less shy, we perhaps know the most about these
particular inhabitants of Britannia. They are located in virtually every
area of the world. One may think of them as the insects of Britannia.
Known k3wL dOOd traits...</P>
<P>-tendency to tame pets and name them 'a'</P>
<P>-intentional or unintentional mispelling of words or improper use of
capitalization (e.g. AzzKicka, PiMpDaDDy, StONe CoLd (Lake Superior
shard mainly), SwEaTy NuTz, etc...)</P>
<P>-they use the phrase 'hehe' excessively (mating call?)</P>
<P>-'i rox', 'u sux', and 'phat regz' are also common calls </P>

<P>7. BN: Hominid Grovelki</P>
<P>CN: Bank Beggar</P>

<P>Somewhat parasitic in nature, these creatures rely on others for
survival. Their main identifying characteristics are....</P>
<P>-the unmistakable cries, 'I was Pked' and 'gimme stuff' (easily
recognizable even by beginners)</P>
<P>-they are often adorned in plain white 'death robes' but can sometimes
be seen in full sets of bone ar even plate armor</P>

<P>Should you see one of these creatures, do not be tempted to offer them
advice concerning more legitimate ways to obtain gold. Most are not
interested and will revert to an infantile and at times undecipherable
retort. </P>

<P>6. BN: Hackini Scumo</P>
<P>CN: Bug Abuser, Exploiter, UO Extreme Users</P>

<P>These cretins, er creatures are not capable of surviving in the world of
Britannia without the aid of unfair advantages. They will stop at
nothing to obtain unlimited wealth or power. After they've obtained
these 'powers' they often wreak havoc around Britannia. Most can be
considered mentally unstable. Use extreme prejudice when dealing with
them.</P>

<P>5. BN: Thiefii Bankis</P>
<P>CN: Bank Thieves, Leeches, White Crested Cocks, etc....</P>

<P>Found only in areas around banks and healer shops, these parasites are
rather malicious. They are easily spotted as nearly 95% of this species
has short white hair and wears a white robe. Females of this species are
*extremly* rare. With such a high ratio of males to females, it believed
they do not reproduce sexually. Judging from the fact that they nearly
all look alike, it is believed that they reproduce in a similar manner
to earthworms. When their bodies are cut up, each piece is thought to
grow into another whole new creature. </P>
<P>Their attack consists of chasing a a victim down while looking into
their belongings. They make their move and steal from their intended
victim who is often powerless to stop them. The guards of Britannia dole
out death but many instantly spring back to life to grab their prize.
More common is to attack in groups. Showing a fledging form of
'intelligence' they work as a team. One takes the role of stealing and
the brunt of the guards' attack while the other quickly grabs the stolen
items. When their work is finsished, they share the spoils of victory.</P>

<P>4. BN: Thiefii Tankis</P>
<P>CN: Tank Thief, Spineless Blue Killers, etc...</P>

<P>These creatures have little in common with their cousins, the bank
thieves. Much stronger, with a thick armored shell, they can be
extremely deadly. They lack the identifying markings of bank thieves and
come with all different colors of hair. They attempt to steal from a
victim but their intent is the death of their victim, unlike bank
thieves. Also, they are never found in towns and are more frequent in
dungeons. Use extreme caution if approached by one of these dreaded
beings.</P>

<P>3. BN: Gameio Masterosi</P>
<P>CN: GM, red rober, Red Devils, etc...</P>

<P>These mystical creatures are very rare. The are easily distinguished by
their bright red plummage and their undeniable call, "There's nothing I
can do." It's not known if they have a function in UO, other than
weddings but they are under intense investigation by our staff. When we
know, you'll know.</P>

<P>2. BN: Ruleri Britannia</P>
<P>CN: Lord British, the Head Honcho, the Big Cheese, Mr. Wall, etc...</P>

<P>All sightings of Lord British have found to be rumors or hoaxes. This
creature does not exist.</P>

<P>1. BN: Tankus Magi</P>
<P>CN: Tank Mage, Magnus Followers, etc...</P>

<P>A truly majestic creature! They show an extreme profieciency in magic
plus a hard outer shell. The more experienced ones can easily be spotted
by their full black, silver, gold, or bronze colored armor. If seen,
shower them with attention and gifts.</P>

<P>We hope you enjoyed our Britannian nature tour.</P>

<P>Well, that wasn't so bad was it? Attention all! I need YOUR ideas. I've
been running low on them lately. If you've got a topic for a top ten, do
not hesitate to send it my way. Thanks and hope ya enjoyed this one.</P>
