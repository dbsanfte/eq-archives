<P>Good evening world,</P>

<P>UOL news reporting. We bring all the latest breaking news from around
Britannia to you in 30 minutes. If it's news, it's here. </P>

<P>10. There was another round of bloodshed today at the entrance to the
dungeon known as Covetous. Five murders took place there this afternoon. 
The killers were apparently only interested in taking the Nike leather
boots from their victims, as that was all that disturbed. The king has
his team of Grandmaster Forensic Evaluators on the case and have issued
the following statement: If you know the whereabouts of PimpDaddyHO or
his accomplice, BitchSlap, remove their head and turn it into a guard to
claim the bounty of 200 gold. </P>

<P>9. The National Foundation for Children was dissolved today, as the head
of the organization realized that children do not exist.Apparently, the
numerous sitings of children were rumors and hoaxes. The now famous
blurry screen shot of a 'child' turned out to be mage morphed into an
orc. UOL news tried to reach Santa Claus to see what this would mean for
his business, but 1643 people all claming to be Santa Claus called back.</P>

<P>8. There's a skirmish today as members of GreenPeace successly shut down
all lumberjacking around the city of Yew. One GreenPeace member had this
to say, "Some of these trees are as old as the server. They provide
oxygen to the entire world." When questioned as to why Britannians
needed oxygen, they had no comment.</P>

<P>7. The very first elections will be taking place soon. Among the most
watched, is the run off for the mayor position of the city of Trinsic.
The candidates are BustYo Mouth and Toilet Duck. Their running mates are
KickYo Ass and Mr Clean, respectively. </P>

<P>6. Their first public debate took place last night and was heated to say
the least. </P>
<P>Journalist(J): Mr. Mouth, why do you feel you are the best man for the
office of mayor.</P>
<P>BustYo Mouth(BYM): tha's easy   i have a halberd of vanq and ill kill ne
1 who doesnt vote 4 me</P>
<P>J: and your answer to that Mr Duck.</P>
<P>Toilet Duck(TD): i have a heavy crossbow of power that says vote for me,
besides bustyo mouth sux</P>
<P>BYM: screw you asshole u suk!!!!</P>
<P>TD: NO YOU DO!</P>
<P>BYM: BRING IT ON BIG MAN!</P>
<P>TD: ALRIGHT!</P>
<P>*Toilet Duck goes into war mode*</P>
<P>BYM: Vendor buy me some bank guards!!</P>
<P>TD: HAHA! WHAT A WUSS! U THINK I AM THAT DUMB? GOD U R A MORON!</P>
<P>BYM: Step out of town and say that!</P>

<P>5. In other news, deer hunters are having a hard time coping with the
new one day-one deer rule. Nearly every hunter interviewed complained
that this new restriction has hurt their leather armor businesses. One
hunter even claimed to have killed up to 40 deer in a day using only his
trusty axe and says that one deer a day just isn't enough to keep his
gold supply up. Park Rangers have been placed in certain woodland areas
that deer frequent but many of them have turned up missing. The king has
sent a team of Grandmaster Trackers out looking for them. </P>

<P>4. Dozens at the bank of Britain were stunned as a portal opened and out
stepped the mage StoneCold being followed by a crowd of close to 20
scantily clad, bald headed, women. One of these women immediately
thanked StoneCold for his 'services' and promptly handed him 300 gold.
The others seemed to be in a trance like state following StoneCold
everywhere he went. Guards are looking into the matter to see if any
laws were broken. Should their investigations find StoneCold to be a
criminal, he will be told that he shalt regret his actions, called a
swine, and killed. Unless, of course he happens to be outside of town
limits when the investigation concludes.</P>

<P>3. A bag containing 100,000 gold was accidently dropped at the bank of
Britain yesterday by IGotAWoody the lumberjack. He is offering a
lifetime supply of kindling as a reward for its return.</P>

<P>2. In the small town of Serpent's Hold a little girl with cancer has
asked that her name live on in a stupid, annoying chain letter passed
around the internet. Wait a minute, we just reported that children don't
exist. Who's writing this garbage? </P>

<P>1. And here's BlowMe with your weather forecast.</P>
<P>"Well, this forecast was a tough call. Tomorrow, I believe there will be
an hour of light followed by an hour of darkness. Have those nightsight
potions and spells handy! Thursday there will be an hour of light
followed by an hour of darkness. On the five day forecast, you can see
that there will be an hour of light and an hour of darkness everyday on
through your weekend. Your forecast trend for next week shows an hour of
light and an hour of darkness for each day next week. Remember though
that weather patterns are unpredictable and El Nino is now part of the
picture. Of course, El Nino means that when we goof up a forecast, we
have an excuse. It's worked so well, that next year we'll invent La
Nina, followed by El Perro, El Gato, La Cucaracha, and El Taco Bell.
We'll fine tune the forecast for next week as time progresses." </P>
