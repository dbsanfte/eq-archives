        <td valign="top">Over the past couple of years the &quot;music
        game&quot; genre has been introduced and expanded. These
        are usually games where the control pad acts as a musical
        instrument as you play your way through the game. They
        don't require much in the way of musical knowledge though.
        They're usually just really advanced versions of the old
        Simon hand held games as you press buttons in the order
        called to you to play a song. That's a good thing for me
        since I have zero musical talent and the rhythm of a, um
        well, of a skinny white college student.<p>Enter, Lammy
        from Um Jammer Lammy. She's a lamb and she plays guitar
        in a band called Milkcan. I bought this game roughly a
        month ago on a whim. Since then, the little lamb pictured
        to the left has played her way into my heart, because her
        game is one the most addictive I've ever played. The
        addiction factor is right up there with Tetris, laser
        light pens, painkillers, Rice Krispy Treats, pornography,
        and those damned Hanson fan fiction sites. Add to that
        the fact that Lammy is cute as a button and you have no
        reason left not to own this game. </p>
        <p>She plays a wicked electric guitar too.</p>

        <td align="right" valign="top">I'm one of those wierd
        people that reads the instruction booklet before they
        start playing a new game. After looking through the first
        couple of pages about the girl band named Milkcan and
        rolling my eyes a few times, I thought for sure I'd just
        wasted my money. I just knew I should have bought Super
        Mega Ultra Power Duper Street Fighter EX 3.1415 squared:
        Turbo Cool Edition. Either that or Mega Man XYZ 14. Oh
        well, I'd already opened it by then and couldn't take it
        back. <p>I was expecting a wierd cross between one of
        those lame Nickolodeon cartoons and <a
        href="http://live.altavista.com/scripts/editorial.dll?fromspage=hb/tab1_homepage.htm&amp;categoryid=&amp;only=y&amp;efi=938&amp;ei=1807126&amp;ern=y">Britney
        Spears</a>. And the two things that make Britney Spears
        appealing to me would most certainly not be included. I
        was bummed. I prepared myself for songs about butterflies
        and cute guys and other stuff that teeny bopper girlie
        bands like to sing about.</p>

        <td valign="top">I will say now that it defies all logic,
        rational or otherwise, that a game centered around the
        lead guitarist of an all-girl band can be this bad ass.
        It really should be illegal to make a cool game about a
        girl band. It makes it really hard on me for one thing.
        Do you know how embarrasing it is to admit that your new
        favorite game is one in which you control a female lamb?
        Pretty damn embarrassing.<p>What I'm getting at is, most
        of the really kick ass games out there have gritty
        storylines, and swearing, and soldiers who blow things
        up, and heroes that don't shave. If women are characters
        in one of these games, they're always nearly naked and
        have breasts that are bigger than their heads.</p>
        <p>These are games that you proudly stand up and announce
        that you love. That is, if you aren't already ashamed of
        spending more money on video games than dates at age 21,
        and I'm not.</p>

    <tr>
        <td align="right" valign="top">Um Jammer Lammy has none
        of that macho stuff. The storyline is as wacky as they
        come. The only thing even resembling a fight comes in the
        opening cinema when a bully tries to steal Lammy's lunch
        and she beats him up with the power of her guitar riffs.
        Don't roll your eyes, I already told you it was silly.<p>There
        is only one soldier and he's a senile old man. He's also
        the only human in the whole game and it appears that he
        does, in fact, shave. He doesn't swear, but he does
        scream and head bang.</p>
        <p>Lammy's no Lara Croft either. As you can see from the
        picture on the right, she's about as flat chested as you
        can possibly get. She's practically two dimensional, as a
        matter of fact.</p>

        <td valign="top">So what is it about the game that makes
        it such a blast to play? It could be the original
        characters. To the left, that's Chop Chop Master Onion.
        He's a rapping, kung fu sensei with an onion for a head.
        I thought that was pretty original.<p>It could be that I
        love the game because I've always had a desire to play
        lead guitar for a rock band in front of millions of
        screaming fans. Worry not though, my aforementioned
        rhythm problem prevents this dream from ever becoming
        reality. As a matter of fact, the only time I've ever
        &quot;played&quot; an electric guitar, there was only one
        screaming person and it was my friend's mom. She said
        something like, &quot;You'd better cut the damn volume
        down or I'll make you boys take that outside!&quot; Um
        Jammer Lammy may be the closest I ever get to my fantasy.</p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td align="right" valign="top">Maybe the reason I love
        the game so much is the fact that Lammy and I share the
        same hairstyle and wardrobe. I always sport the eternally
        messed up hair and if you ever see me wearing something
        other than a t-shirt, blue jeans, and sneakers, I'm
        probably at a funeral and you can be sure there's a
        change of clothes waiting in my car. When it's time for
        my funeral, jeans and a t-shirt are what I wanna go in.
        Either that, or my Ernest P. Warrel mask.<p>Whatever the
        reason is, Um Jammer Lammy like, um jams! The music is so
        catchy, I've been singing the songs for days now. The
        game has recieved the first, &quot;Damn, you mean it's
        dark outside already? How long have I been playing?&quot;
        award I've given this year. It's been responsible for
        making me nearly late to class twice. &quot;Yeah Dr.
        Anderson, I'm sorry I disturbed your class, I was really
        rocking with my lady Lammy.&quot;</p>
        <p>But, with this page, I am now over the embarrassment
        that loving this game initially brought. I know that
        there exist men who can look <a
        href="http://www.seanbaby.com/readers/readercomics.htm">badass
        in a Power Puff Girls t-shirt</a>. So too, I shall look
        bad ass once my Um Jammer Lammy t-shirt arrives. Allowing
        5 to 7 days for delivery and I am only one business week
        away from announcing to the world, &quot;I love Um Jammer
        Lammy and I am badass!&quot; Oh what a great day that
        will be.God, I'm such a geek.</p>

        <td valign="top">So, anyway, the one thing that Lammy
        does not have as far as I can tell is an internet fanboy
        page. If you've never used the internet to search for
        information on a video game, let me explain to you what a
        fanboy page is. Some games are just so totally, and
        awesomely cool that they inspire young men (little boys)
        and young women (little boys) all over the world to fire
        up the AOL HOMEPAGE MAKER, collect pictures from other
        internet sites, type up the game's manual along with
        their review of it, and post their tribute to said game
        for all to see. They register it with every search engine
        you can possibly think of and then folks like you and me
        stumble across these masterpieces such as <a
        href="http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/garage/3496">Cloud46's
        FF7 page</a> or <a
        href="http://home.earthlink.net/~brasmussen/sonic/title.html">The
        Sonic Shrine</a>. And believe me, I don't care who you
        are, or what game you just programmed, it isn't worth
        shit until <a href="mailto:LimpBizkit42@hotmail.com">LimpBizkit42@hotmail.com</a>
        makes a fan site and calls it a shrine. And now, the true
        purpose of all this rambling reveals itself! I am writing
        this to move Um Jammer Lammy from the status of great
        game to that of classic game. Without further adieu (sp?)
        I proudly present to you, quite possibly, the only, and
        therefore, the best, Um Jammer Lammy fansite.</td>
