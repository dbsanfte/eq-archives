<H1 align="center">The Baxter Green Incident</H1>     
<CENTER><IMG SRC="baxg.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>Background: A relative newcomer to RGCUO, Janey, noted that one of the
tailors (Baxter) in Skara Brae on the Lake Superior shard sold a particular
shade of green that no other tailor had. She wanted to give this color a 
J. Crewish name, so the green became known as Baxter green. However, Baxter
would not sell bolts of green to the masses and only sold 10 folded pieces at
a time. Other newsgroup readers, Dundee and Driakos, began hinting that
Baxter's death would be coming soon. Thus was born my character, Baxter
Green. Baxter Green's mission: To protect Baxter or at least buy up as much
of the green cloth as possible before he died. (I just couldn't stay out of 
something this much fun.) In these pictures, you see me praising the virutes
of Baxter green.</P>

<CENTER>The following is the post I made to RGCUO as Baxter Green.</CENTER>
<p>__________________________________________________________________________</P>
 
<P>Last night, the Skara Brae healers officially pronounced Baxter the
tailor dead at 7:00 PM, CST. Autopsy reports show that he died to a
poisoning attack. Witnesses told that the guilty party was none other
than Driakos.</P>

<P>I discovered the grim scene last night just after it occured. I was
probably the biggest fan of Baxter's lovely shade of green. It is, after
all, my namesake. I'd heard rumors that Dundee had been plotting the
death of Baxter and I was determined to stay with Baxter and keep him
safe.</P> 
<P>When I arrived at the Skara Brae tailor shop, Shade was there along
with Driakos. Baxter was missing. "Where is Baxter?" I asked. Driakos
laughed in a most evil way and said, "You are too late, it is already
done." Shade quickly excused herself and left.</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="baxg4.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>What followed was a heated exchange of words between myself and
Driakos. Baxter's green cloth was my sense of purpose. It gave my life
meaning and now Driakos had taken that away from me. I threatened suicide.
</P>

<P>Driakos explained that he knew a side of Baxter that no one else
did. A side that refused to buy fancy shirts when he didn't feel like
it. A side that enjoyed tormenting tailors by wandering out of his shop
while their bags were full and they were too encumbered to walk. A side
that loved a certain fish maybe just a little too much. (Among his
possessions an old smelly fish was found.) A side that, as bad as it
pains me, was a pimp.</P>
<P>"Lies!", I shouted. Dundee had been mysteriously absent all
evening. I quickly deduced that Dundee had ordered this killing and
vowed that I would extract my revenge. </P>

<P>In a fit of rage, I ran out the front door being chased by Driakos. 
I must have tripped and fallen because when the world went black for 
several minutes. </P>
<P>When I regained conciousness, I returned to the tailor shop and
once again confronted Driakos. He assured me that he acted alone. He
began to tell me even more things about Baxter's secret life. Then, he
tried to get me to meet the new tailor that was replacing Baxter. It was too
much for me. Phoebe was the new tailor's name.</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="baxg16.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>"She sells a lovely shade of red", Driakos said, It was more than I could
take. I ran out into the street and found a guard. "Vendor buy bank guards!"
I shouted. "Here is Baxter's murderer!" The guard shrugged and said, "I'm
sorry. Thy meaning escapes me." "Baxter is DEAD!", I screamed. "Bring his
killer to justice now!" The guard frowned at me and said, "Thou had best 
step back." </P>
<P>Driakos laughed and told me that all the guards knew of Baxter's evil
ways but they could not do anything about it because he would go out of 
town to commit his criminal acts and wait two mintues before returning. </P>
<P>Slowly, I accepted it. I gathered up Baxter's belongings, a red
shirt and the fish. I looked into my pack at the green cloth I'd bought
only that afternoon from Baxter. Driakos suggested we dispose of the
fish and I gave it to him. "That fish symbolizes the evil of Baxter's
life, while this green cloth gives us all but a glimpse of what we might
achieve one day", I declared. I promptly thanked Driakos.</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="baxg17.jpg"><IMG SRC="baxg15.jpg"></center>
<P>I shall keep the last of the Baxter Green cloth in hopes that one
day the world shall understand. Baxter tasted the power of this green
and it drove him to criminal acts. When the world is ready, I shall
reintroduce it to Baxter Green.</P>
