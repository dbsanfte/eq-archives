<P>Not even 24 hours into my new life in UO and the game's already causing
me troubles. As I ran my errands this morning, I began to slip back into
my old UO habits. Let me tell you a bit about it. </P>

<P>I had an appoinment today with my academic advisor. I was to set up a
tentative schedule for the next three quarters of school. I walked in to
his office 45 minutes late and greeted him, "Hail a bald academic
advisor". He looked a little surprised. Realizing my mistake I said, "Oh
sorry, wrong game." I explained that my recall runes were all gone and I
wasn't used to walking around and that's the reason I was late. He
wasn't amused but we began the planning.</P>

<P>"What courses would you like to take?" asked the advisor. "vendor train
magery" I said. "What?", he replied. I tried something else. "uhm vendor
train lumberjacking" The advisor answered, "Look this is an engineering
school not a trade school. If you want to cut trees, this probably isn't
the place for you." "look asswiep jsut tell me waht skills u trane" I
blurted. </P>

<P>He pointed me the class schedule with listings of all the courses
offered this quarter. I was really pissed at this point so I thumbed
through the schedule and quickly made my selections, "vendor train
mechanics of solids....vendor train thermodynamics...vendor train circuits" The advisor said, "Fine, that's all I need
from you, goodbye!"</P>

<P>I stood up and waved my arms and said, "Kal Ort Por". Another stare from
the advisor was directed at me. Then I remembered that I had no recall
runes and walked out of his office, a little embarrassed. </P>

<P>I got over it quickly though and headed for the store. I'm going on a
trip this weekend and I needed to pick up a few things. After an hour or
two of practicing my wrestling on the blow up punching doll in the toy
department, I was approached by a store employee. She said, "Is there
anything I can help you with?" </P>

<P>Remembering that I still had things to do I said, "Yes, vendor buy bank
guards" I said. She said, "uh what does that mean?" I said, "oh i
see..ur not a npc r u?" She replied, "No, I don't guess I am." I said,
"kewl ur cute...r u a reel girl?" I think that angered her a little as
she emoted *Huffing* and said, "Yes, I am!" I tried to explain, "well
there are a lot of wierdos out ther who pretend to be girls"</P>

<P>"That's nice", she said, "Was there anything in the store that you
wanted to buy?" I asked her where they kept their fans. She said, "I'll
send someone to get one and they'll meet you at the front." </P>

<P>"k", I responded as she led me to the front. She emoted *grimacing* all
the way to the front. I tried to lighten the mood by telling a joke. "u
know..if i was really kewl, i would have asked for phat phanz" I said.
She was not amused and left as soon as she'd shown me to the register. </P>

<P>My phan (hehehhe) was brought to me and I was in line behind a man who
struck up a conversation with me. "Hello there, do you do much fishing?"
he asked. I said, "yeh i did for awhile but wehn i got my str up i quit"
He said, "Uh huh, well, uhm I'm going on a big fishing trip this
weekend. They say the fish are really biting.", he continued. I said,
"taht sux" Puzzled, the man asked, "Why does that suck?" I figured this
guy to be a newb so I thought I'd help him out, "bcuz fish arent worth
anything..u haebv to get really good and opull up tresure maps and siht
liek that for it 2 be worth it...and taht taeks forevr".  "Well, it was
very nice talking to you." said the man.</P>

<P>I finally made it to the cashier. "do I haev to say 'vendor buy' to
you"I queried (running out of synonyms =p). She said, "Not unless you
want to." "thx", I replied. She checked me out and I headed for the
door.</P>

<P>At the door, there was a little old man with short white hair. He looked
like an employee but I wasn't fooled. As I walked by him he said, "Just
a second sir, I need to check your receipt." I yelled back over my
shoulder, "yeh rite..do u think i dum?" He walked up behind me and put
his hand on my fan. My suspicions confirmed, I yelled, "THEEF VENDOR BUY
BANK GUARDS" and pulled out my newbie dagger. The guards showed up and,
to my astonishment, took me to jail! </P>

<P>They said I had one telephone call and I used it to post this message.
Can someone tell me WTF is going on?</P>
