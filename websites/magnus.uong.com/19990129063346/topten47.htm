<P>Sup Dewds?,</P>

<P>Time for yet another installment of the Ultima On-Line Top Ten List.
(© 1998, Tank Mage Productions) Today, I want to address the new
notoriety system and the top ten things, *I* would like to see
implemented along with it. Hope you enjoy.</P>

<P>10. We need a third scale on the system for morons and idiots, we'll
call it IQ. Ultima Players need to know when they've happened upon a
dummy and will know to avoid this person at all costs. No positive
scale, only negative. What actions will lower IQ?</P>

<P>- Giving your character a name like XXXX--DeAtHbRiNgEr--XXXX will
automatically lower your IQ to the minimum</P>
<P>(I've posted many times about this but I still fail to understand the
motive. I've narrowed it down though to a few possibilities. a. an
immature person who thinks it looks kEwL  b. a sticky shift key  c. the
absurd thought that a name alone will be enough to scare someone)</P>

<P>- Lighting every pile of $%^&ing kindling you come across</P>
<P>(Fire is nice. It allows us to cook and to log out in the woods. But
beyond that, there ain't much use for it. It's just 2 - 3 frames of ugly
animation.) </P>

<P>- Trapping a monster in a house</P>
<P>(Are these people just really lonely for friends? Do orcs and ettins
make good dinner companions? Enquiring minds want to know.)</P>

<P>-The list goes on and on and on and on....</P>

<P>The titles for the new IQ scale are...</P>

<P>- -1....0   None</P>
<P>- -10..-2   The slow</P>
<P>- -20..-11  The dimwit</P>
<P>- -30..-21  The mentally deficient</P>
<P>- -40..-31  The hopelessly stupid</P>
<P>- -50..-41  The legally braindead</P>

<P>9. I would like to see the recent newcomer to this newsgroup, YourMOMMA,
permanently flagged as a criminal/aggressor so that anyone in this
newsgroup may attack him at will. </P>

<P>8. After the new system is introduced, hopefully someone will write a
new FAQ to replace that god-awful thing that Bob Hanson calls an FAQ. 
"Ok, suppose Bob the innocent and Jane the innocent are friends. Jack
the innocent and Jim the innocent are also friends. Now Bob is fighting
an ettin while Jane watches. Along come Jack and Jim who have been on an
all night drinking binge. Jack starts to yell obscenities to Jane while
Jim steals from the ettin. Jane slaps Jack and Jim slaps Jane. Bob,
insulted at the mistreatment of Jane trips up both Jack and Jim and
spits on them. Jane then steals the Ettin loot back from Jim. Jim gets
confused and kills his friend Jack. Bob kills Jim. Jane kills Bob for
using violent means to resolve a conflict. What is the result? The
answer is obviously found by using the quadratic equation and finding the third partial derivative of the obtained roots of the functions.</P>
                             

<P>7. Maybe someone could explain exactly what necromancy is. I always
thought it was running around in public scantily clothed.
If that's the case, several miners are already practicing it. </P>

<P>6. How about mandatory uniforms/outfits for murderers? I think it should
be set up similar to the Chaos/Order guards. When a player reaches
murderer status, they should be forced to choose between a Barney or a
LambChop outfit. Once the choice is made, the murderer will then be
forced to download several Megs of sound files. When they commit further
crimes, Barney or LambChop will remind them to "Play nice", "Get along
with others", or "chopping up human remains isn't nice boys and girls."</P>

<P>5. On the other hand, give those who reach the highest reputation/fame
possible some REAL benefits. For instance, higher server priority (i.e.
less lag), or maybe one of those one-hit wonder halberds that the guards
carry.</P>

<P>4. What about a roleplaying scale to match the new IQ scale. A 100 point
based system with titles would include,</P>

<P> 90..100  Dennis Heffernan approved</P>

<P> 80..89   the great roleplayer</P>

<P> 70..79   the good roleplayer</P>

<P> 60..69   the roleplayer</P>
 
<P> 50..59   the semi-roleplayer   (dat's me!)</P>

<P> 40..49   the player</P>
 
<P> 30..39   the gamer</P>

<P> 20..29   the powergamer</P>

<P> 10..19   KeWlDeWd</P>
 
<P> 0...9    Oh let's face it, is there anything worse than a KeWlDeWd?</P>
<P>Wait a minute I know.</P>

<P> 0...9   Noto Killer</P>

<P>We are going to let Dennis decide what actions lower roleplaying points. </P>
<P>- doing anything when PKers are present besides run</P>
<P>- killing another player for any reason</P>
<P>- using ICQ</P>
<P>- transfering items between players</P>
<P>- being an 8th circle mage who loves to wear plate armor (my own  
personal claim to 'Dennis scale' shame)</P>

<P>3. Players who can not complete a single sentence or phrase without
interjecting one of those choice four letter words should be permanently
flagged as criminals. This will include newsgroup posts. </P>

<P>2. Anyone wearing bone armor should have their criminal flag turned on.</P>
<P>Isn't bone armor just about the ugliest stuff you've ever seen? Besides
that, it's free, it's easier to find than those '50 free hours' America
On-Line disks, and it is nearly as good as regular plate mail. </P>

<P>1. I would like to see the new notoriety system alleviate the PK
problem, end noto killing once and for all, make a person's title a much
more accurate gauge of their past actions, and cure a lot of other long
standing problems that have been plauging the game. Like the other
suggestions, they're possible but they aren't likely.</P>

<P>Well that's the close of another list. Be back here next week, same Mag
time, same Mag newgroup for the next... (nah, not even I can get that
corny)</P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo, Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Adept Tank Mage who says, "Remember boys and girls,
walking through town in just your underwear isn't polite."</P>
