<p><font size="3">Where have I been? Working on senior design for
my elec. engineering degree, that's where. After almost 5 months
of working on this project, I finally get finished with it
tomorrow. Today though, I have updates. New in the EQ Picture
Gallery, I've finished </font><a

<p><font size="3">I picked up my copy of Scars of Velious
yesterday. Given the fact that it was Saturday, the store was
just a bit crowded. I stood in line and studied the box and came
up with </font><a href="http://magnus.uong.com/velious.jpg"><font

<p align="left"><font size="3">And now something totally
unexpected, an update to the </font><a

Picture Gallery</font></a><font size="3">. Here's </font><a

<p align="left"><font size="3">Yahoo Fantasy Football update. My
fantasy team, the Ocllo Tank Mages continue to stun and amaze
fans. They are in the midst of a 1 - 8 season and are ranked 10th
out of 10 teams in the league. My new team motto, We make being
last look easy.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">I'll apologize for the lack of
updates again. I just filed for my degree last week and that
means I have 10 months until graduation. Ten busy, work my ass
off months. After that I'll get my degree and the &quot;best
years of my life&quot; will be over and I'll be damned glad. If I
had to put up with any more of the best years of my life, I'd
probably go postal.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Oh yeah, get ready for a special
EQ surprise in a few weeks.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5">Sep. 24, 2000</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Yes, it's been over a month since I updated.
Since then, a lot's happened. I've completed my set of </font><a
href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~yobby/"><font size="3">Cyclone</font></a><font
size="3"> pictures. With much coaxing, he has sent me the final
two. They're on the </font><a
href="http://magnus.uong.com/submissions.htm"><font size="3">Submissions
Page</font></a><font size="3">.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">My meetings at EverQuest Anonymous didn't go
well and I'm playing that damned game again. And, yet again, I'm
close to having a new set of screenshots ready. Another month or
two and they'll be ready to go.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Speaking of Cyclone and online games, I've
started my second season of Yahoo! Fantasy football. My team, the
Ocllo Tank Mages e-bolted their way to 7th place in last year's 8
team league. This year, they've started off strong, only losing 2
of their first 3 games! To learn more about the league, and see
rare pictures of all the coaches, check out </font><a
href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~yobby/"><font size="3">Cyclone's
page</font></a><font size="3"> and click the Stooge Football
League link.</font></p>

<p>And uhm, oh yeah, added a letter from one of the original
authors of the <a

<p><font size="3">Three weeks ago, someone at the </font><a
href="http://www.viperclub.org/"><font size="3">Viper Club of
America</font></a><font size="3"> posted a link to my </font><a
href="http://magnus.uong.com/viper/dodgeviper.htm"><font size="3">Viper
page</font></a><font size="3">. The next morning, I had two dozen
messages from Viper owners wishing me the best of luck, offers
for rides (not test drives mind you), not to mention tons of new
pictures. I think this one's my favorite.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Wow, Diablo 2 is a lot of fun. So much fun, in
fact, that it's caused me to cancel the old EverQuest account.
That means no more long evenings spent watching a little orange

stuff. Look for a new WetCondom story soon.</font></p>
