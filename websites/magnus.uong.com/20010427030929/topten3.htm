<P>Hail Fellow Britannians, (I'm semi-roleplayin' right now)</P>

<P>It's time for another installment of the UO Top 10 List. Before I begin
I wanted to express my opinon over a post that I read on this newsgroup.
The post concerned a newbie who was given a purple potion and told it
was a strength enhancing drink. I became very angry after I read the
article. WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT???? Or at the very least get to see
it. That's got to be the best one I've read on this newsgroup so far.
Anyway, my Top Ten List this time is titled, "Did ya ever notice?" </P>

<P>10. Did ya ever notice that newbies really love those wooden shields?</P>

<P>I went on a hunt for some vile murderers in the dungeon Covetous with 
two of my buds. (A GM swordsman, and GM Warrior) Along the way every
newbie in the place stopped us and asked us what we were doing. When
they heard the news, they all wanted to come. *Magnus rolls eyes* Since
the PKers were on the 3rd level, we passed lots of newbies. By the time
we got the last mountain pass we had enough wooden shield holders
gathered together to make someone from Green Peace have a stroke. 
Attention Spotted Owls: Look for a new place to live now! (All of these
guys had on regular shirts and pants too.) Do I really need to continue
with this story? Needless to say, the newbies were just cannon fodder. I
mean I could have cast a gate back to my home island of Ocllo but I
don't want 30 newbies running around the island bothering folks. Uhh  I
got off my own subject. Sorry, it won't happen again.</P>

<P>9. Did ya ever notice how much fun Polymorph can be?</P>

<P>Some of my recipes for fun:</P>
<P>Find the first NPC wanting an escort and say "I will take thee." 
Polymorph into a chicken. Run around the bank in Vesper spamming, "PET
HUMANS FOR SALE! GET 'EM HERE!"</P>

<P>Find a place where brand new characters are created. Stand just off
screen and polymorph into something big and mean looking. My personal
fave is the daemon. Hide. When new character walks by,</P>
<P>a) chase them</P>
<P>b) discuss the Britannian news of the day with them</P>
<P>c) invite them to Hythloth</P>
<P>d) give them a wooden shield</P>
<P>e) Tell them you have looked deep into their souls and they are the THE
chosen one. THE Avatar. THE one who MUST master the 8 virtues and save
our world from utter destruction. Send them off on a quest to recover
the eight sacred "_____" Insert magical item here (Pieces of Triforce,
crystals, dragon armor, gym socks, America On-Line disks - wait a minute, those are pretty easy to find) Be creative
and come up with a good story. (I've played so many single player RPGs,
I'm pretty good at being convincing.)</P>

<P>Polymorph into a human.(that's right a human) This is kinda odd (You
become very pale white with no hair) Walk around a big bank and Spam "I
was attacked by vampires. Can anyone spare weapons, regs, armor,
house/boat keys, house deeds, account names and passwords?"</P>

<P>8. Did ya ever notice that there isn't very much demand for forensic
evaluation?</P>

<P>Has anybody ever seen anyone boasting of being a GM in this? Apparently
no one wants to roleplay episodes of Murder She Wrote. Of course the UO
version would be: PK She Wrote.</P>

<P>7. Did ya ever notice that all the REALLY wierd posts come from people
on the Catskills server?</P>

<P>I don't think there is any need to comment here.</P>

<P>6. Did ya ever notice that Mage Merchants often have only 3 Nightshade
left?</P>

<P>EXCUSE ME! Whoever bought out the Mage, you couldn't afford 9 more GP
and finish off the job? This NPC Mage wants to charge me 6 apiece now
because he thinks Nightshade is a hot new item. Must be that wacky
energy bolt spell.</P>

<P>5. Did ya ever notice that you can blame anything on lag and get away
with it?</P>

<P>Wife/Mother on your back wanting you to take out the trash/do the
dishes/clean your room/etc......</P>
<P>Magnus: Sorry guys, I can't go to the dungeon tonight, my lag is too
bad.</P>

<P>Didn't assist your buddy when he was attacked simultaneously by 4
ettins, 2 giant spiders, a scorpion and a partridge in a pear tree
because you were working on IDing that new magic platemail.</P>
<P>Magnus: I'm sorry about that. I got lagged and dropped. When I got back
in you were dead. Hey wanna guess what kind of plate mail this is?</P>

<P>A guy in a deathrobe comes up and wants you to take on 7 to 10 dread
lords by yourself, because he sees you kill a Giant Rat with an energy
bolt.</P>
<P>Res Erect: Magnus! There are a bunch of PKers up ahead can you take em
out and get my stuff back?</P>
<P>Magnus: Just how many is a bunch?</P>
<P>Res Erect: About 6 or 7. GM Archers</P>
<P>Magnus: You obviously have this latest patch confused with another one.</P>
<P>Res Erect: Huh?</P>
<P>Magnus: I can't do it. Lag is horrible tonight. Otherwise I'd be glad to
run in there and take 'em all out. They fixed recall ya know. Those guys
couldn't get away if they wanted to.</P>

<P>4. Did ya ever notice that REALITY SUCKS sometimes?</P>

I've heard over and over that "Lots of PKers make the game more realistic."  Video games are supposed
to be an escape from reality. If I wanted to see murder, I could tune
into the evening news any day of the week. Before the flames fly, I DO NOT WANT
TO GET RID OF PKing. I do think that PKing has its place. If handled
responsibly, the threat of being PKed is *almost* fun. However, as it
is, it's just plain annoying to have to worry about getting pelted with
arrows fired by the Ass siblings (Lord KickYer,Lord Bad, and Lady Kiss
My) every time I step into a dungeon. (My god, what awful wording of a
sentence!) My high school english teacher would be turning over in her
grave. (That is if she were dead.) </P>

<P>3. Did ya ever notice that these lists really start to suck close to the
end?</P>  

<P>I apologize for this mess. I am VERY tired. It's the lag. Ooops  not in
UO. If you are really, really upset about the poor quality of this list,
you can E-Mail my Physics professor and flame him for giving me 15 pages
of problems. Oldfart@uab.edu</P>

<P>2. For my fellow mages:</P>
<P>Did you ever notice that cooking goes up REALLY fast?</P>

<P>I've never cooked a thing. Honest. My cooking skill is over 40. Nope,
not even the atrophy bug could take care of it. C is also early in the
alphabet. Cooking skill is unconquerable. Forget the fact that Create
Food makes cooking useless to me, who would want to eat cooked Ettin
Ribs? Or Rat Ribs? Mmmm. Reminds me of my Junior High days. Does anyone
know why lunchroom ladies use icecream scoops to serve everything by the
way?</P>

<P>1. Did ya ever notice that Ultima On-Line is a really fun game if you
give it a chance?</P>

<P>Barring the occasional run in with an idiot or two and lag, Ultima
On-Line is THE most enjoyable gaming experience I've ever had and I've
been playing video and computer games for about 14 years now. (Wow! That
makes me sound old.) Sure Ultima has got its problems, what software
doesn't? My point is, Ultima On-Line is here for our enjoyment. Let's
have a little fun with it. OK?</P>

<P>-Magnus (Catskills, Ocllo)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Adept Tank Mage who thinks it's better to be pissed off
than pissed on.</P>
