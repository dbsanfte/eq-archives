<P>It was a warm morning on the island of Ocllo. The birds were
singing and the shopkeepers were readying their stores for the day's
business. The town had been peaceful since the last of the monsters on
the island had been exterminated. The whole town had a cheerful feeling
this morning.</P>
<P>However, in a small house on the outskirts of town, things were far
from cheery. For this house belonged to a mage named Magnus. Magnus
awoke and expelled a long sigh. He stared at the ceiling of his house
and slowly began to get his feet. As he got to his feet, he looked
around the room and saw his small chest at the foot of his bed. He
thought to himself, "Today's the day. Might as well get it over with."</P>
<P>Magnus, quite frankly, was a worried man. For the last two weeks,
his magic had seemed to have lost most of its effectiveness. He first
noticed the change as he tried to battle an orc. He had called fire and
lightning on the creature and the orc seemed strangely unaffected. He
called more and more lightning until the orc stopped and fell. Magnus'
heart was racing. What was wrong with him? He had never had so much
trouble with orcs before. Perhaps this one was just particularly
resistant to magic.</P> 
<P>Subsequent battles proved that notion to be false. Time after time
Magnus would often have flee from battles because he could not inflict
any noticable damage on monsters. He became very fearful of his future.
What does a mage do when magic has betrayed him? He sought to avoid the
question by escorting nobles and lesser mages to various cities around
Brittania through the use of his gate spell.</P>
<P>Such escorts did not satisfy Magnus for long. He was a battle
hardened mage and was always happiest while he was battling some two
headed ettin or undead skeleton. He resolved to try combat once more.
This time, he took a weapon with him, just in case he should need it. It
turned out he did. It seemed his magic was as weak as the day he got his
first spell book. He relied on the axe much more than he would have
liked to have admitted but at least he was battling monsters.</P>
<P>These thoughts raced through Magnus' mind as he opened the chest at
the foot of his bed. With a stern look on his face, he reached in the
chest and pulled out a set of black plate armor. The armor had been a
gift from a swordsman that Magnus had aided some time ago in a battle.
The fighter had been so grateful for the help, that he gave Magnus the
armor he was carrying. Now Magnus frowned at the armor. He despised
armor but now it seemed he had no choice. The armor was badly in need of
repairs and Magnus was in no hurry to put it on, so he bagged it up and
headed for the town blacksmith.</P>
<P>Walking through Ocllo, Magnus was greeted with many smiles. He had
been one of the foremost adventurers who helped rid the island of
monsters and was somewhat of a local hero. Magnus tried to return the
smiles but in the end gave over to his brooding. He arrived at the
blacksmith shop and asked, "How much will it be for you to repair this
armor for me, Wallace?" Wallace replied, "Why Lord Magnus, what do ya be
needin' plate armor for?" Magnus answered, "It's for a friend." Wallace
replied, "Ah is that so? Well, 'tis an honor to have ya in my shop. I'll
fix for ya free o' charge." Magnus said, "Thank you sir."</P>
<P>The blacksmith was good to his word and Magnus was soon taking his
newly repaired armor back to his house. He went inside and began to
gather a few items. He planned to go hunting once more to see once and
for all if he could still cut it as a mage. He reached in his armoire
and puled out his axe. He despised it. He new that it was the only thing
that had kept him battling creatures over the past few days.</P>
<P>It was not so much that Magnus hated physical combat as much as the 
fact that he loved magic. Magic had been his life since he was old
enough to read. He loved hearing stories of powerful wizards going to
deep into the dungeons of Britannia unarmed and unafraid. The thought of
losing his proficiency in the magical arts and being reduced to relying
on an axe for survival made him sick to his stomach. Nevertheless, he
took the axe and put it in his pack.</P>
<P>"Now for the armor.", he thought. He dressed and looked in his
small mirror when he was finished. The dark knight glaring back at him
reminded him of his darkened mood.</P>
<P>Magnus located his rune for the stables where his horse, Steel, was
kept and recalled there. Ahh, recall. This was one spell that did not
fail him. He quickly took care of business with the stable master and
then climbed on his horse. A quick peek in his backpack and he found his
rune to a house he shared with his friend north of Minoc. The house was
close to an area where many monsters roamed and would be the perfect
spot for testing his magic one last time. Another recall, and Magnus and
Steel were sitting in front of the large two story house.</P>
<P>In front of the house, atop his own horse, Fire, sat Magnus' friend
Exodus. Exodus was just beginning his training as a mage and become
Magnus' pupil and friend. They had battled together for many months and
each man trusted the other with his life.</P>
<P>Exodus smiled when he saw his friend and said, "Good morning
Magnus. What's with the armor?" Magnus admitted the truth to Exodus
about his magic and that armor was a nessesity now. Exodus was very
sympathetic. Exodus said, "Well friend, whatever happens, remember, you
look great in that armor. You should be able to scare the monsters and
not have to worry with magic at all." The humor was enough to lighten
even Magnus' dark mood and he finally allowed a smile to cross his face.</P> 
<P>"Shall we be off?", asked Exodus, to which Magnus nodded. They rode
to the area of the forest where monsters were most frequent and came
across many newcomers to the Minoc area. One group of at least a dozen
had taken on a single ettin and had dragged it to the ground and almost
killed it. Another group of six or more had an orc mage surrounded. The
two rode and rode and did not see any more creatures. Exodus said, "What
did I tell you Magnus? That look you've got going has scared all the
evil creatures away." Magnus smiled again and said, "Since there are no
monsters to slay, perhaps a little magic practice will help."</P>
<P>The two mages sat and practiced a good many of their spells. As is
often the case, many who were unfamiliar with the ways of magic, stopped
to watch the show. They were impressed with the display and often could
not restrain themselves from audible "ooohs" and even applause.</P>
<P>Magnus and Exodus practiced until they depleted their magical
energies. They then stopped to chat with their "audience" answering
questions of all sorts about the arcane art.<p>
<P>All of a sudden, two archers jumped from behind some nearby trees
and began firing arrows into the crowd. Immediately, two people screamed
and fell dead to the ground, their spirits moaning loudly.</P>
<P>Exodus looked to Magnus. Magnus said, "We must fall back. We have
no hope against them with no mana." Magnus and Exodus turned their
horses and began to ride full speed out of the woods. The whole while
Magnus' mind was moving as fast as his horse. He couldn't believe he was
running away again. He was furious with his decision but reminded
himself that even the most powerful mage must flee when faced with
impossible odds. He continued to dwell on this thought until he saw the
edge of the woods and burst into daylight.</P>
<P>He turned and said, "That was close Ex...." Exodus was nowhere to
be seen. He waited for fifteen full minutes and still no sight of his
friend. He feared the worst and began searching for a solution. Not long
after, his solution came walking up. A group of five warriors on a
hunting trip was walking his was into the woods. Upon meeting him they
stopped and said, "Good morning. How goes the hunting today?" Magnus
replied, "Not good at all. There are some murderers in these woods
today. I fear they may have killed my friend." The leader of the hunters
said, "Did you see what they looked like?" Magnus described the two
archers and the hunters replied, almost in unision, "They are wanted
men. There are bounties on their heads." The leader again spoke up and
said, "Sir, will you lead us to these men so we may dispatch justice on
them." Magnus was more than happy to oblige and lead the group into the
woods.</P>
<P>On the way he passed the body of Exodus and the corpse of Exodus's
horse, Fire. His fear for his friend melted away, leaving only a burning
rage. He quickened his horse.</P>
<P>He led the group to the edge of the woods and there they found the
two archers who had joined with four other archers. The other four were
also known murderers.</P>
<P>Upon seeing the six archers, the five members of Magnus' party
turned and ran. Magnus sat stunned at the desertion until an arrow
striking his platemail brought him to his senses. His eyes red with fury
turned to the one who shot the arrow. Magnus instinctivley chanted the
words to the Heal spell and quickly pulled his spell book from his pack.</P>
<P>He turned the pages quickly to the seventh circle spells. He
located the Flamestrike spell and began chanting the ancient words of
power.</P> 
<P>In his voice, all his hate, rage, and despair from the past few
weeks came out. All this he channeled with magical energy  into a single
burst of fire. The effect was surprising.</P> 
<P>A huge column of flame, six feet high, shot from Magnus' hand and
headed straight for the archer who had fired first. The archer
immediatley became engulfed in flames and began running wildly around
for a few seconds until he dropped dead to the ground. The other archers
stared in amazement at the smoking pile of bones that was once their
friend. However, the spell had been costly for Magnus. He had completely
drained his mana and could not even Recall to escape. Escape though, was
the farthest thing from Magnus' mind. He pulled out his axe and charged
the group of archers swing wildly totally consumed with fury.</P>
<P>Alas, five against one is never a fair fight and Magnus soon joined
the archer he had killed. His had just suffered a viloent death, but his
mind was strangely at peace. He slowly rose and began the walk to town
to find a healer.</P> 
<P>He sorted his thoughts and reflected on what had just happened. He
had focused his power and had killed a powerful warrior with a single
spell. He had also charged into a physical conflict, knowing very well
what the results would be and he had enjoyed it. Suddenly, he realized
that perhaps he might have to work a little harder with his magic but it
was not a lost cause and he would actually enjoy any close up battles he
might get involved in.</P>
<P>Magnus found a healer who quickly restored his life. Magnus thanked
him and continued quickly towards Minoc. He had been careful with his
gold and had also left some reagents in the bank.</P> 
<P>To his surprise, Exodus was there. Exodus was upset but not overly
angry. He was more concerned about his horse than anything else. When
Magnus told him what had happened he said, "I'm sorry Magnus. What are
you going to do now?"</P> 
<P>Magnus said, "Well I've got to get some gold and reagents out of
the bank first," Exodus replied, "Don't be a fool Magnus. A second death
will prove nothing." Magnus said, " Don't worry. I'm not going after
them. I've got to go get myself another set of black plate. I'm turning
over a new leaf. I enjoyed that fight. But don't think I'm giving up
magic. I saw a glimpse of my full potential today and I liked it."</P>

<P>And so was born, Magnus the Adept Tank Mage.</P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo, Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Adept Tank Mage who had to tear himself away from the
lag free Catskills server to write this.</P>
