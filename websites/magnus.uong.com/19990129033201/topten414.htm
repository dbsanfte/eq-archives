<P>Hey!,</P>

<P>this is KiLLeR....magnus told me that if I didn't noto pk neone for a
week, i could get to write the list this week.....so i didn;'t kill no
one..(at least magnus didn't find out about any of em)....so here it
is....the top ten things that bug me about uo</P>

<P>10. dastardlies and dishonorab;es</P>
<P>everytime i see one i just gotta whack em, their usually like WTF?...i
say your evil dude, and now your dead..you wuss</P>

<P>9. PKers</P>
<P>i hate pkers...its like u have to play the game their way when they are
around..u can run like i do or fight them...if you fight them u might
die and lose your gear....its too tough to make any money or stuff cuz
when someone kills u they take it all away, OSI FIX THIS NOW YOU
BASTARDS!</P>

crap....its a game lamerz...if u want to hear talking like that go see a
shakespear play or something...i heard taming of the lambs is pretty
good...theers this guy and he eats people..thats kewl</P>

<P>6. like when im in a dungeun and i get the last hit on a harpy the loot
should be mine...it dont matter if some lame mage got it all the way
down to the last hit...who ever kills it gets the loot.....so i run over
and grab the stuff but this lamer already has it and wants to offer me
half...im like hell no i want all of it...and their like no just
half...so i say forget it if you wernt blue i'd rock u...these idiots
just piss me off and they have titles like honorable and noble...yeah
right</P>

<P>5. OSI said the bugs to break in houses were not spoiltz and then they
go and stop em from working...WTF??? that was a main source of my
money...i could get lots of regs and other loot and i didn;t have to
work hard for it</P>

<P>4. the new vendor change suks the big one....somebody bought my key and
stole everything in my house...these people don't care about anybody
elses feelings...they are just playing the game for themselves</P>

<P>3. i just gotta say somethign else about magnus and cyclone....these two
are the biggest geeks in this whole mewsgroup....they aint even
funny...they should go make their own newsgroup like</P>

<P>2. these losers that are always asking how do i do this or how do i do
that in the newsgroup....thats not what this group is for....its for
talking about all the reds we rock or complaining about pkers or
complaining about how we can;t log in.....now get it right dammit!</P>

<P>1. i hate those dumbasses who think they are better than everybody else
are always slamming people when they posts...you assholes are morons
