<p>Hail UOers,</P>

<P>     I hear rumors that Sosaria has been destroyed by some kind of a
source code error. Well, that may be the 'official' report for what
happened, but I happen to have the top ten real reasons why Sosaria was
destroyed.</P>

<P>10. Lord British forgot to mail the check for the power bill.</P>

<P>9. The Avatar gave up on trying to save the world and went to play
Quake.</P>

<P>8. This is a player event. The FOA returned and succeeded.</P>

<P>7. The servers were taken down while Gladys the cleaning lady plugs in
her vacuum cleaner. They'll be back up shortly.</P>

<P>6. GM Ironwill decided that he hates ALL the servers and took
appropriate action.</P>

<P>5. Richard Garriot is using OSI's internet connection to play EverQuest.</P>

<P>4. Ultima Online just can't function without trade window exploits.</P>

<P>3. 'To better serve our customers, the new server hours are as follows,
1PM to 5:30 PM Mon thru Wed, in the months with 'r' in them.'</P>

<P>2. Raph tripped over an extension cord while carrying a stack of pizzas.
(Hope he's ok.)</P>

<P>1. 'By keeping the servers offline all the time, we have effectively
wiped out lag, rampant PKing, and disconnects.'</P>

<P>     I'm sounding bitter this evening, no?</P>

Sosaria was destroyed</P>
