<P>Hello all, (it's semi-roleplayin' time again)</P<
<P>I just have to share an experience that I had this morning. (This
may get really long) As always, a little explanation is in order. From
my top ten list about PKs I got a few e-mails telling me that I had no
clue what I was talking about. I admit I don't 'hang out' with PKers
very often but I thought I pretty much had it figured what a good
portion of them were like. Perhaps I was wrong. Anyway, in an effort to
see once and for all the truth, I decided to devote this morning to
learning more about the dreaded lords and ladies of Britannia. This post
is about that experience. (Note: nothing here is made up) This may not
be my funniest post but it has a very happy ending. =^)</P>
<P>I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to go about it, so I created a
character on a shard I don't normally play on. I named him KiLLeR so I
could blend in with them if I so chose. (Kinda like that movie 'Gorillas
in the Mist') Well, the first thing I needed to do was find a specimen
of the not so rare species and I would improvise from there.</P>
<P>The first dread lord I came upon was Lord tHe pLaGuE. He was
attacking a poor guy on horseback with magic. Instincts kicked in and I
ran to the aid of the horseman. If you can picture it, I am in newbie
clothes with a wooden shield plus a practice sword and I began to attack
him.(My character was 15 minutes old.) To my surprise, I caused him to
lose concentration on 6 energy bolt spells and bought the horseman a
precious chance to heal. The dread lord ran and blasted me with an
explosion. Aha! I had been wise and started with 50 magic resist. I
continued my chase. Eventually I lay dead, the result of no healing
ability. I had succeeded in tipping the scales of the battle in favor of
the horseman as he chased the magician off into the woods. I insta-resed
and reflected on the previous events. Note to self: Specimens are often
jumpy when confronted with more than one victim/attacker. They will
often display their yellow abdomen when fleeing. I must be careful not
to frighten them in the future.</P>
<P>The next encounter came soon after. I resumed my walk and was soon
greeted by an arrow in the face. Ah another subject for examination,
dread lord Ardon. This one was not alone, however. He had a magician
friend, lord LooseCannon. I turned and fought the archer until I
screamed and fell dead again. Since this character was new, all the
items I had been carrying stayed with me. I paused before hitting the
instant resurrection button. Perhaps, I should trail them as a ghost and
see just what it is they do. Good idea. I watched as they looked and my
body and one laughed. The other said, "damn, he ain't got shit." The
other said, "Yeh but he was a brave one though   didn't run" These two
dreads were joined by another player, whose name escapes me. This one of
blue notoriety. As I followed, (invisible of course) their plan became
obvious. The two dreads did all the killing, while the blue did the
looting and anything else he could to stop feeling victims. Note to
self: Despite the horrid grammer, foul language, and oft seen spelling
error, the two subjects do show some strategy to their work.</P> 
<P>I followed these three for an almost two hours. One victim, named
Friendly oddly enough,after being attacked asked to fight one on one.
His cry was ignored as the archer continued firing and the mage rained
down lighting and energy bolts. I said nothing to each victim as they
ran off to find the aid of a healer. Note to self: These three never
attacked any group larger than one. They never showed any mercy
whatsoever. They even attacked a some guy mining in his underwear.</P> 
<P>After awhile they had cleared out the area and decided to run back
to their home to drop off their loot and take a quick breather. I
followed their every step. Once they got home, they realized someone had
gotten a key, broken into one of their two houses and stolen some of
their 'hard earned' stuff. The were very angry. They swore and cursed at
anyone who would sink so low as to steal from someone else. They
promised each other that they would call a GM. A smile crossed my face.
Note to self: These three show very immature behavior when faced with
loss of property but seem to ignore the fact that their chosen existence
comes from preying on those weaker and taking their belongings. After
seeing the actions of the blue character, I am considering him a part of
the breed as well.</P>
<P>They all decided that they would feel better if they 'whacked some
more folks' and since only one house had been looted, they still had a
sizeable dump of property. They continued their reign of terror.</P>
<P>After awhile, it was obvious they had scared off all
the people. Suddenly an ettin ran out of the woods and attacked. What
followed was the most uncoordinated attack I have ever seen. The archer
ran, trying desperately to hit the ettin, the mage couldn't keep up
because he was frozen every time he tried to cast a spell and the blue
guy could only get a swing in with his sword every once in awhile. After
5 or 6 minutes, the ettin fell. Note to self: The constant battles with
human opponents who more often flee rather than fight seem to make this
bunch unused to the battles with monsters. (As an adept mage on another
server, I often battle ettins alone with little trouble.)</P>     
<P>As they sorted the ettin loot, they planned their next move. The
orc fort at Cove, perhaps? That suggestion was put down quickly with a
statement from the mage. "We can go but be ready to haul ass outta there
at any second" The orcs in the fort, who are not in the least hesitant
to attack, were the problem. They decided to try Covetous. Note to self:
The three openly admit their trouble with monsters to each other and give each other reassurance.
Kinda like a peer group!</P> 
<P>The four of us arrived at the entrance to Covetous. (I still had
not revealed myself to them.) At the entrance, we were greeted by no
fewer than 11 dread lords and ladies. (It was hard to get an exact count
because groups of them were chasing down victims constantly.) So many
subjects for examination. I lost my three 'friends' in the sea of red
names. Oh well, plenty more to watch. Among these new dreads were: (and
I wrote these down to make sure I didn't forget) Lord spit, Lord snot
(brothers I guess), Lord DaHuNtA, Lord Stuart Smalley (of Saturday Night
Live fame- I guess those motivational programs get to you after awhile),
and Lord w.A.r. Several of these were members of a guild that had
something to do the with nWo. I stayed and watched the scenes unfold. I
often followed large groups of 5 or 6 as they chased down single
players. When the victim did get away, unfailingly profanity ensued.
This continued for almost an hour.</P> 
<P>One of the members of this large party of self-proclaimed
'bad-asses' decided it was time to storm the dungeon. They swept
through  the first level quickly. Wooden shields fell everywhere. A team
of looters followed on their heels. I watched as a group of three
attacked one person named Jeremiah. He had been cornered by half a dozen
giant rats and was desperately trying to teleport into an area where he
could run. The three archers made short work of him and began to fight
off the rats. Just as the other dreads, these three also seemed to have
problems fighting creatures that attacked back and for once outnumbered
them. Note to self: It seems this trouble fighting monsters may be a
widespread side-effect of player killing.</P>
<P>Soon panic swept through the ranks of the dreads. The word 'antis'
was mentioned. Some of the braver ones rushed to the entrance to take on
this threat. Others recalled away. The five or six that stayed and
fought were all killed by a force of 15 Great Lords. The Lords had also
brought along some friendly dreads to dispense the blue looters.</P>
<P>There were many, many ghosts. However, it had been over three hours
since I had been killed, and there were so many dead people, I was not
noticed. I slipped out the front and waited to see if my 'friends' from
before might emerge. All I saw were the ghosts of other dreads
complaining about having to walk all the way to the Chaos shrine and
cursing the 'antis'. I decided to walk back to the homes of my previous
sujects.</P>
<P>When I got there, I was greeted with a shock. There were the ghosts
of the two dreads I had followed earlier and three blue players. They
were in the house that had not been looted. I walked through the door.
They were talking about how they were glad they had not been at Covetous
when the antis swept through. I decided to make my prescence known. I
materialized and to my great surprise, one person said, "KiLLa, I can't
resurrect yet or spirit speak so you'll have to find a healer." It
seemed they had accepted me into their tribe. An idea sprang to mind.</P>
<P>After 15 minutes or so, I found a healer and returned. The two
dreads had gone to get resurrected and only two players were left there.
One whom I had not seen yet and the other was the blue who had been
helping the two dreads earlier. I decided to test my new found
acceptantce into the group. I had been watching for so long, I  had
picked up some of their phrases. I said, "Wher r the ohter guys?"</P>
<P>They told me that they had gone to get ressurected. They asked me
if I was a friend of their dread lord partners. I told them I was with
the nWo when the 'antis' swept through and was killed for looting. I
asked if I could stay in their house for a few minutes. They agreed and
we all went inside. (Note: This was the house that had not been looted)
I walked in, grabbed the armoire in the corner and ran out before the
door closed. The blue player was furious. He attacked me immediatly and
went to dishonorable. I headed for the woods. I have been playing this
game for almost 5 months now and have built up two advanced level
characters (Master Swordsman and an Adept Mage). When you are a newbie, you
spend lots of time running through the woods. All of it came back to me
as I zig zagged my way through the woods and easily left the the two
behind. Note to self: A player's skill and thinking, rather than a
character's skills still count for a lot.</P> 
<P>I reached Minoc and went for the back. I opened the armoire and to
my dismay, there was nothing inside. Oh well. I dumped all my stuff in
the bank except for my book and headed back. When I returned, I was
called all sorts of foul names. I was told that PKers and thieves had
honor but I had neither. I questioned them about this. I asked about
groups of three hunting down one person and asked if this was honor. I
asked if a blue character, who loots the bodies that the dread lords
kill and helps them by preventing the victim's escape was honor. Their
only answer to me was, (I am paraphrasing them)"Because you stole from
us without killing, you are a homosexual. You also have sexual relations
with your mother because of this.(Their dialogue was a tad more
colorful)  (???? Very strange ????) I told them that I had taken it upon
myself to find out what kind of stuff PKers were really made of and I
had found exactly what I had expected. They vehemently denied my
accusations. (Odd I thought, since I told them I had followed them for
over an hour.) I then asked about real life professions. One would not
speak, the other said he worked in customer tech support, was a Computer
Science and Philosophy major. (Dennis was that you?  Nah  just kidding.
=^)  ) Anyway, they eventually resorted to attacking me. I did not fight
back and insta resed again. They thought that was hilarious. I had
ruined my character. I didn't tell them that I wasn't on my home shard
and that I was using a throw-away character. I decided to leave them
with a little comfort. After a few more attempts to get into their house
when they opened the door, I stood right in the doorway and logged off.</P> 
<P>A little later, I logged back in and they were gone. I took the
book from my pack and wrote, "Dear sirs, Thank you so much for letting
me follow you around today. I had a lovely time. That armoire will
really go nicely in my house near Vesper. I really, really appreciate
your kindness. I think I will be hanging out around here a lot in the
near future, so ya never know when I'll turn up on your door step, hint
hint. Thanks again.   - Your pal,  KiLLeR"  I dropped the book in front
of the house, walked back in front of the door and hid, I logged out
again. Maybe, I'll visit them again. Maybe not. Perhaps, they'll spend a
few days looking for my house (that doesn't exist) around Vesper. Maybe,
they'll be *very* careful opening their door from now on. PKs may often
get the upper hand in the PvP part of the game, mind games are where I 
excell. Tee hee</P>   
<P>What's been the point of all this? Well, a few things that I can think of.
I've been told that most PKers do have honor. The ones I've run
into have not possessed this trait. I am sure that they exist but do not
make up a majority of PKs. I have learned that I was wrong about the age
of PKers. The discussions I saw placed most of them in their early 20s,
not the 13 - 15 I was expecting. PKs often do speak in a similar manner
to BON3DOOD and pLaTeDeWd. As I said before, I made none of this up. I
do not mean to say that the group I saw today was representative of the
entire group, but groups like this are by no means rare.</P> 
<P>Now I say to you, this may be perhaps a little bit of a solution to the PK
problem. On this, my first attempt, I really messed with one small group
of PKers, with a newbie character mind you. I might add that I had
a blast doing it too. Perhaps, if more people used similar methods, it
might drive some of them crazy enough to stop. Again, the resident dread
lords and ladies in this newsgroup are not included in my conclusions.
>From what I have read from them, they are mature, honorable, and try to
make their choice of gameplay enjoyable for all. Thanks for reading and
please give me your comments.</P>
