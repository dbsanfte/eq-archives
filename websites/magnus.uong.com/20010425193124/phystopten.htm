<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Physics Top Ten List</H1>
<P>OK, the servers aren't working. I'm trying to put off doing a lab
report. It's the perfect time to tell a story.</P>

<P>My physics professor is from Japan. He's an absolute genius when it
comes to physics, calculus, and chemistry. Don't believe me? Just ask
him. (He's very proud of his degree.) Anyway, English gives him lots of
trouble. *His* English gives me lots of trouble. (I know, I'm rambling.)
So the point is, whenever he says the word, "earth" it sounds just like
he is saying, "ass". Last week we covered gravitation which has a lot to
do with the earth. I've never heard so many late teenagers/early 20s
people giggle so much in my life. Of course, I was giggling too.
So, here are the top ten things heard during that lecture.</P>

<P>10. The mass of the "ass" is very large.</P>

<P>9. The "ass" does not look so big if you stand on the moon.</P>

<P>8. The center of the "ass" is what is important. It is all we will
consider in equations.</P>

<P>7. Does anyone know why the moon not hit "ass"?</P>

<P>6. A person is very small compared to the "ass".</P>

<P>5. With a big "ass" you can get a big moon. =-) (I swear I'm not making
these up.)</P>

<P>4. When you jump, "ass" pull you down.</P>

<P>3. "Ass" pulls everything towards it.</P>

<P>2. You know the "ass" is spinning.</P>

<P>1. So far we can not drill very far into the crust of the "ass".</P>

<P>I'm laughing just typing these out. I feel really bad if you were eating
while you read this. You're guaranteed to laugh your "earth" off.</P.
