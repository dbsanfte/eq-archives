<P>Dewds and dewdettes,</P>

<P>     I continue to enjoy my return the Ultima. As a matter of fact, I
have come up with a new idea for a top ten list. I'm kinda writing it as
I go, so uhm read on, if you dare.</P>

<P>________________________________________________________________________</P>

<P>Inhabitants of Britannia,</P>

<P>     As you know, the world of Britannia is a constantly changing place.
For instance one day, you might log in and see pigs flamestriking
people. The developers and programmers are busy making these changes on
a weekly basis (Giggles). Here we list the changes that are coming soon.
Unfortunatly, our programmer in charge of the web page was cursed by
Magnus and seems to be stuck on the number ten. So, here are the top ten
new changes to Ultima Online. Some of these are long-term and some are
shorter-term; you'll usually be able to tell which is which by the
amount of detail given. Ok, we're kidding. Even we don't have an idea
when these will be finished.</P>

<P>10. The *Player continues grinding.* for alchemy will be removed. It
will be replaced by *Players stirs madly and quotes scenes from
Southpark.* or *Player stirs until arm gets sore, switches arms and
continues with the stirring*. Alchemy will then start raising strength.</P>

<P>9. We've noticed that some of the skills aren't being used as much as
we'd planned so we've listed some new skill revamps to make them more
popular.</P>

<P>- Forensic Evaluation will allow the user to sentence murderers to life
in UO jail. (Must be master level or higher.)</P>

<P>- Forensic Evaluation will display scenes from Murder She Wrote on 
everyone's screen within 3 screens when used by a grandmaster now</P>

<P>- Bodies will now take 15 real days to decay so that Forensic Eval. can
be macroed</P>

<P>- Evaluating Intelligence will now give the IQ of the player instead of
the character. We may let it kill the target as well.</P>

<P>- Begging will now result in magic weapons and armor being given to the
user</P>

<P>- When Begging is used on a player, that player's bank box will be deleted 
if they do not donate something to the poor</P>

<P>- Camping will no longer be offered as a skill choice for new
characters. All characters will start with 100 camping.</P>

<P>- Herding will soon allow you to direct large groups of animals,
monsters, NPCs and even other players.</P>

<P>- Fishing will allow the player to snatch the items out of the holds of
other players ships.</P>

<P>- Cartography will kill everyone in the area of which a map is made.</P>

<P>8. On the other hand, some skills are just too popular. Here are the
proposed changes.</P>

<P>- All spells are being disabled except for telekinesis.</P>

<P>- Archery of any type will now consume gold and reagents from the
archer's bank box.</P>

<P>- Hiding will result in immediate banning. This was done to curb certain
features of UO Extreme.</P>

<P>- Tracking will now display an alphabetized list of everything on the
shard, including animals, monsters, NPCs, players, rocks, trees,
flowers, no-draws, vendors, arrows, flour bags, and death robes.</P>

<P>- Tactics will start at zero for everyone and never increase.</P>

<P>- Mining and blacksmithing will lower strength.</P>

<P>7. Player owned houses will have the doors replaced with blank walls.
This should stop most of the current house break ins. When a player
wishes to enter their home, they must contact a GM and show proof of
ownership of the house.</P>

<P>6. New items will be craftable and will be allowed to be placed in
player houses.</P>

<P>- Coconuts         - Lava lamps              - Cellular phones</P>
<P>- Juke boxes       - Personal computers      - College degrees</P>
<P>- NPC bankers      - Lord British statues    - Spark plugs</P>
<P>- Bird baths       - GMs                     - Plastic bags</P>
<P>- Toilets          - Cassette Tapes          - Gumball machines</P>

<P>Placement of these items is permanent. Calling a GM to move these items
will result in immediate banning.</P>

<P>5. Crosswalks and sidewalks will be added to the towns. Players not
using the crosswalks to cross the streets will now be flagged as
criminal for jaywalking.</P>

<P>4. Tailoring and carpentry will now work like blacksmithing. In that,
they will both soon require ingots, hammers, and forges. They will also
make you work your ass off for hours for tiny skills gains. However,
once your skill is sufficient, as a tailor, you will be able to craft
exceptional clothing. Once weather is introduced, exceptional clothing
will keep you much warmer. Exceptional furniture will last 2 days before
it decays.</P>

<P>3. We're still working on that much talked about weapons revision. The
nerf weapons will be a thing of the past. As a matter of fact, all
weapons will be a thing of the past.</P>

<P>2. Due to the large number of complaints about bestiality in our game we
recieved when we annouced llamas would be mountable, we are taking out
llamas, horses, ostards, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, and any other
creature we deem to be offensive.</P>

<P>1. UO's Greatest Hits was so popular, we are releasing the second album
in the series soon. It's called UO Greatest Hits ToOooOOOO, On this
compilation you'll hear..</P>

<P>- "WTF does that mean?" by Kewlio and the Gang</P>

<P>- "Say the words I want to hear. (Recdu and Recsu)" by Second Agers</P>

<P>- "Insta Rez Blues" by the Bank Thief Krew</P>

<P>- "My Heart is in Vesper (cuz I wuz PKed)" by Kal Ort P...</P>

<P>- "I would lag 5000 miles" by 9600 Bauds</P>

<P>- "lte;s rok thees lmaurs!!!11" by the Ston3Cold Choir</P>
