<P>Hail friends(time for some more semi-roleplayin'),</P>

<P>I want to say first of all, "Thanks" to everyone who has tracked me
down on Catskills to tell me how much they enjoy my lists. There have
been about 6 people now to do this. </P>
<P>As for the list today, I need to make a small explanation. I am not
usually an Origin basher. However, last week's message about recall
destroying runes to decrease the number of items in the game and hence
decrease lag convinced me that they need a little ribbing about now.
This list is the top ten new ideas that Origin has to reduce the
'non-existant' server lag. =^)</P>

<P>10. Talking</P>
<P>We at Origin have identified player dialogue is a contributing factor to
lag. We want to eventually do away with all player text within the game.
We encourage all players to download ICQ and use for all conversations.
Instead of a person's name showing when you bring up their paperdoll,
their ICQ number will be displayed. We realize that such a drastic
change will be hard for many people so we are planning on phasing it out
slowly over time. Our method will be similar to the method used to
control talking in many elementary school lunchrooms. In the next patch,
there will a new graphic for a traffic light. This traffic light will
display on every character's screen all the time. When talking is below
acceptable level, the light will be green. As talking nears the
established level, the light will turn yellow. If talking goes above the
preset level, the loght will turn red and all players will be required to say nothing for 5 minutes.
Anyone violating this will be put in 'time out' by a GM.</P>

<P>9. Recall</P>
<P>Even though most people feel there is nothing wrong with recall as it
is, we wanna change it. The leading idea now is to make recall hurt
notoriety. Why would this be considered evil? Because Dennis Heffernan
says it is. We of course want players to choose to walk. We want to
implement features that will make the walk more enjoyable. Some
examples: </P>
<P>-Historical markers (Lord British took a leak on this tree, etc.)</P>

<P>-Cheap souvenir shops ('My son went to Britain and all I got was this
lousy T-shirt' type items should be very popular) </P>

<P>-Sno Cone stands (We believe we can combine the mortar sprite and the
sulphurous ash sprite to make a believable sno cone)</P>

<P>8. A bus system</P>
<P>With recall restricted, some players may not have the time to devote to
the game to progress very far. We will institute a mass transit system.
Players will be able to check the bus schedules on the message boards
and we will place bus stops in various locations around the world. Bob
Hanson is maintaining an FAQ but his FAQs are hard to follow so we
aren't even linking to it. </P>

<P>7. Magic</P>
<P>It occured to us that the thousands and thousands of reagents were a
major source of the items in the world. We are proposing a new magic
system. In addition to the original 8 types reagents, there will be 8
more kinds. Every spell will use at least one of each of these 16
reagents. Our hope is that mages will become so pissed off and confused
that they take up archery and quit buying reagents altogether. The new
reagents will use existing game sprites.</P>

<P>-Super Sulfur - hide sprite colored yellow</P>

<P>-Styx - kindling sprite</P>

<P>-Mystic bottle of power - wine and liquor sprite</P>

<P>-Useless scrap of cloth - useless scrap of cloth sprite</P>

<P>-Quills of Force - feather sprite</P>

<P>-Liquid Energy - ink well sprite </P>

<P>-Focal Crystals - diamond sprite</P>

<P>-Krystals - fish steak (yeah we're talking about the little square
hamburgers)</P>

<P>6. NPC shops</P>
<P>We have identified another major cause of lag. All the transactions
between the players and the NPCs really slow down the servers. What we
plan is to have the NPC shops close during peak times. This should cut
down on requests to the server. It will also get more people out of
towns during peak hours and spread the load more evenly on the servers.</P>

<P>5. NPC shopkeepers</P>
<P>This next measure is being considered because of the same reasons as the
previous. Player transactions cause server lag. We will quadruple NPC
walking speed and disable the various vender, shopkeeper, ... keywords.
In their place, the player wishing to purchase something must type the
following, " 'NPC name' I would like to buy/sell  x# 'item name' ".
Again, we hope that this makes purchases from NPCs difficult and tedious
forcing players to rely on other players more. </P>

<P>4. PvP switch</P>
<P>We aren't really sure how this will affect lag, but Dennis Heffernan
assures us that this is the answer to all our problems. </P>

<P>3. Archery</P>
<P>We decided that all the feathers and shafts were also adding to the item
count so fletchery has been disabled. The only sources for arrows will
be, provisioner shops and monster carcasses. (This is an idea that I,
personally, kinda like.)</P>

<P>2. Treasure and loot</P>
<P>To further decrease the item count, monster carcasses will no longer
have gold or magic armor. These items are lowering the availability of
bread, alcoholic beverages, bread, backpacks, cheese, torches, and no
draws.</P>

<P>1. Death</P>
<P>Good news! We are removing the weight and item limits on bank accounts.
In their place, we are instituting a new policy on death. Two or three
people have complained that death means nothing to most players. Stat
losses are unpopular so, we have a new system in mind. When a character
dies, they may either choose to play as a ghost or delete all the
characters on their account and start again. This will stop hoarding and
also stop abuses of this policy with 'mule characters'.</P>


<P>As always, we at Origin care what you think about. If you have any other
suggestions that would decrease lag, please post them here on this
newsgroup.</P>

<P>-UO team</P>


<P>Well, another finished. Thanks for taking the time to read. Sorry
Origin, you asked for it this time.</P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo, Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Adept Tank Mage who is worried that some of the
previously mentioned ideas might be seriously considered.</P>
