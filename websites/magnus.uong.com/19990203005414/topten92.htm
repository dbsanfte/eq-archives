<H1 align="center">Top Ten 9/2</H1>
<P>Hail and wassup,</P>

<P>     Before I get started today, I want to say congratualtions to Dundee
and Shade on their wedding. Now all you have to do is find a house you
can live in together and hoard for retirement.</P>
<P>     This week's top ten list is the top ten remakes of movies done
using Ultima Online. Obviously, UO is quite different from the real
world of Hollywood, so a few things will need to be changed. </P>
<P>________________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>10. The Craft  </P>
<P>Three teenage girls are trying to desperately to unlock the secrets of
necromancy. These three girls, Pimp Slap, Bitch Slap, and Cheek Slap
discover one day that they need a fourth girl to complete their cirle
and open the gateway to necromancy. When a new girl, Knee Slap moves
into town, they know that they've found their fourth member. After a
ritual involving a lot of slapping, they are gifted with the power of
Necromancy. They then spend their time gathering body parts of bank
thieves and reanimating them to do their work for them. It doesn't take
long until their army of white haired zombies ammasses a fortune for the
girls and they retire to private castles. All is well until the GMs ban
them for exploiting the necromancy spell.</P>

<P>9. Scream</P>
<P>A small village near Covetous is thrown into panic after a string of
murders is committed and the guards are left baffled. One group of
friends decides to pretend that they are in a computer game filled with
psychotic killers who slay anything that moves only to discover that
they are in a computer game filled with psychotic killers that slay
anything that moves. All the friends are PKed and in a surprise ending,
the killer is discovered to be a mule character for one of the friends.</P>

<P>8. Dead Man Walking</P>
<P>The story of the murderer, BigPoppaPimp, who has been bountied for well
over 200 murders. After being denied help from the GMs on removing his
murder count, the hardened PKer learns forgiveness and comes to terms
with stat loss through very emotional discussions with a counselor who
befriends him. </P>

<P>7. Liar Liar</P>
<P>Wacky fun and laughs a plenty ensue when Mr. PeAnUt, the KeWL DooD, is
forced to tell the truth for 24 hours of UO gaming time. You'll laugh
until you cry as he calls a GM to report a vendor functioning improperly
and winds up confessing to the GM that he dupes, uses UO Extreme, hacked
his stats, and thinks that GMs are sissy boy, pimple faced, college
geeks. You'll see Mr. PeAnUt PKed, stolen from, and thrown in UO jail
all because of his 'curse' to constantly tell the truth. </P>

<P>6. Independence Day</P>
<P>A large group of alien invaders has their sites set on Britannia. These
invaders have another thing coming! Within 5 minutes of their attack on
the capital, Britain, a mass of players have gathered with their
superpowered bows and hacked stats. The aliens are not only defeated,
they are crushed. They are insulted. Their ghosts are trapped with flour
bags. The players who stopped the invasion quickly complain that the
game offers no challenges and that Origin's quests suck.</P>

<P>5. Back to the Future</P>
<P>I. Doctor Emmit Brownnose has discovered the secrets of timewarps. In a
huge mix up, his assistant, Marty MyFlyIsOpen, gets sent back to the
beta test. Marty's not too bright and quickly tells everyone how to
induce timewarps and use them to dupe and alter stats and other such
things. UO degrades to a state of superhuman characters battling out
unwinnable wars with godlike weapons of mass desctruction. Cats and dogs
are slaughtered mercilessly and other such things that give off major
bad vibes.</P>

<P>II. Doctor Brownnose attempts to set things right. He tries to timewarp
back to the instant before Marty makes the first historic timewarp but
miscalculates and winds up timewarping all the way back to the original
Ultima. To get back to the present, he must complete each Ultima game to
move to the next. He does well until he reaches Ultima IV and finally
goes insane trying to figure out what to do next.</P>

<P>III. Marty is captured by the GMs and banned for exploiting timewarps.
He soon gets another account and goes right back to timewarping. By this
time, the timeline is so broken that Origin pulls the plug on Ultima
On-Line and introduces Pong Online (PO). After awhile, Marty forms a
gang, Da PO Boyz, and sets about destroying everyone's fun in Pong
OnLine.</P>

<P>4. Man in the Iron Mask</P>
<P>The people of Britannia are unhappy with Lord British. He's never been
seen and only responds to them through talking walls. A small group of
archers (There aren't any muskets in UO! =p ), Azz Hoes, Pot Hoes,
Erectus, and CART MANion =p discover that the king has a twin brother by the
name of English. Lord English has been imprisoned in UO jail with an
iron mask locked on his head for six years. They free him and start
their revolution to replace the king. After making their way to Castle
British, they find the castle deserted. After finding a diary, the truth
is discovered. Lord British and Lord English are the same person. He was
brainwashed by members of the %$& Cabal. (Whoops, looks like my language
filter is on.) They told him his name was English and locked him in the
dungeon. To keep the people satisfied, they've kept up the charade of
British with talking wall speeches and the institution of Order and
Chaos guards. Blackthorn was found to be working with the %$& Cabal and
goes missing rather quickly. British is replaced to his throne and
returns peace to his land. (Yeah right! That's just about as believable
as the ending to the real movie isn't it?)</P>

<P>3. Small Soldiers</P>
<P>This 'movie' was such a sucky piece of trash (Not to mention a waste of 
film, seven dollars, and two hours of my life that I could have used to do
something more entertaining to do like get consumed by fireants) that even UO
KeWL DooDz didn't like it. No remake scheduled.</P>

<P>2. Braveheart</P>
<P>The citizens of Ocllo revolt against the cruel rule of the king of
Britain. However, they lack a millitary leader. That is, until William
Wallace steps up to take charge of the Ocllo armies. Problems soon arise
when it's discovered that every person who even claims to have Scottish
origins on the server has a character named William Wallace and all the
Wallaces fight amongst themselves while their armies are crushed.</P>

<P>1. Titanic</P>
<P>The story of a young couple, Jack Off and Ruby Palms, who meet on the
maiden voyage of the 'THE TITANIC'. The couple soon fall madly in love
with one another. In a extremely steamy scene, the boat hits a patch of
turbulent water and a client bug allows Jack and Ruby to see each other
with no clothes on! Or is it see only themselves with no clothes on? Oh,
What the heck, it's steamy!!!! The love that these two find is not meant
to be, as a server crash and a time warp from hell, prevent the boat
trip from ever happening. </P>

<P>I apologize if this makes you look at movies differently from now on. I
know I have been. =) Thanks for readin' and I hope you enjoyed.</P>
