<P>     I started my second trip wandering the new lands and was once again
amazed at the sheer amount of wide open areas with no other people in
sight. The deer were plenty and soon I was into my regular routine of
making leather bustiers. As I was sewing and hunting, my mind wandered.
Why does Britannia need so much female leather wear? By my best guess,
I'd say the population is about 80% male. Are there secret underground
guilds of females buying them? Are the few females *that* busy? Do
armorers live kinky secret lives? Ah well, thoughts for another day.</P>
<P>     My wanderings soon took me close to civilization. Just as sailors
on a ship can tell that they are close to land by observations of the
environment, I too could tell I was nearing a
town. I began to pass creature after creature standing motionless. All
of  them appeared to  be called 'a' or 'b'. "Ah, this should be a
gathering of kewlios or whatever the current name is for them.", I
thought. Soon I came across empty bottles, arrows that missed their
marks, and discarded ore and then my suspicions were confirmed. I had
stumbled upon the town of Delucia.</P>
<P>     This, once quaint, little village was bustling with activity. I
quickly located the bank. There were guild fights taking place. Bank
thieves were making their rounds and there was a bard who insisted on
playing his lute over and over and over. I wandered from the bank and
found two gardens filled with rocks. A sign over it said something about
a messed up spawn of cotton. I came across another field with what
appeared to be 20 to 30 bird corpses, a warrior on horse back with a
halberd,  and a stack of raw ribs as tall as a man. I watched for a few
minutes as he would kill each little bird as soon as it appeared and
quickly pluck it for its feathers. He saw me watching and said, "heh, i
made over 2k fethers in les than an hour". I nodded and smiled and
slowly walked away.</P>
<P>     I pressed on. Soon I encountered a man fighting a cow with a bow
and no arrows. As I passed, I offered advice. "Good sir, arrows might
aid your struggle against this beast." He said, " hehe i know...just
gaining archery... r u a mage?". I, not so humbly, replied, "Yes, I am a
grandmaster of magery." The archer seemed excited and said, "kewl!!!
will u heal me??? plz". I smiled and aided the young man with wave of my
hands and chanting the words: In Vas Mani. To which, the arhcer replied,
"thx dude".</P>
<P>     I finished my exploration of the town and mused on what a shock the
inhabitants must have faced when meeting the race of humans known as
kewlios. Most probably responded in anger and
disgust judging from the rude replies I recieved from shopkeepers and
peasants. I can not say that I blame them in the least. I remember how I
felt when the village that I call home (Ocllo) was invaded by these
kewlios. It was enough to drive me to live far from civilization for
many months. I have since returned to small town of Ocllo that I love so
much, but alas, I am straying from the topic at hand.</P>
<P>     I returned to the bank to deposit some of my possesions and as I
rustled through my bags, I caught sight of a man wearing clothes as
black as night standing in one place, yelling, "NE1 HAVE A MAGIC WEPAON
4 SALE??//". I did not have one, so I kept silent. Again the man in
black screamed, "NE1 HAVE A MAGIC WEPAON 4 SALE??//". Over and over he
screamed this. I did my best to ignore him but he ran over behind me and
screamed over and over his request. I turned and said, " No sir. I do
not!" His only acknowledgement was to run away and bother someone else.
I closed my backpack and bid farewell to this little village that I knew
would soon rival Britain itself in terms of degree of kewlness.</P>
<P>     As I placed more distance between myself and the kapital of kewl, I
encountered a large and ancient looking temple. I gazed in wonder but
was interrupted buy a ghoul, a skeletal warrior, a skeletal mage, and
giant serpent. I did my best to escape but became trapped in a corner.
As I considered my options, a man in platemail by the name of KAIN
stepped into view. "Help has arrived", I thought as KAIN chanted the
words: Corp Por. Help had indeed arrived but not for me. KAIN's energy bolt
sucked up my last remaining life energy and I fell dead at
the feet of the monsters. I watched in spirit form as KAIN firefielded
the creatures that had attacked me. He said, "magnus if ur still here,
thx for the black palte1!!!"</P>
<P>     With a heavy sigh, I turned and headed back for Delucia where I
could be brought back to life. Once revived, I made my way to the bank
clad in only a death robe. When I approached the bank, anyone I walked
close to, slammed their bank boxes shut and ran around to the other side
of the building. "Now they think I am a kewl dood!", I thought.</P>
<P>     It was about to get much worse. I had inadvertantly carried all my
runes for this new land with me when I left town the last time. I was in
Delucia with only a vague idea of which direction Papua and the portal
that had brought me to this land were. I also realized I had no spare
clothes or armor to put on. The realization hit me that I would most
likely have to walk back blindly with no armor to Papua and I expelled
another sigh.</P>
<P>     I took the death robe off, hoping that people would mistake me for
a miner rather than a bank thief. I might not have armor, but I would
have my dignity. Oh well, a brisk run through the woods in my underwear
might be a nice change of pace. I was kidding myself and I knew it. The
only way I could fathom running through the woods wearing only a small
piece of cloth only slightly better than a loincloth would be if I were
in pursuit of a fair maiden in a leather bustier or some other similar
situation. I headed for the woods.</P>
<P>     Five splinters, seven cuts, three bruises and a snake bite later, I
managed to somehow stumble into Papua. I made my way for the teleporter
that had brought me to this place and quickly transported back to the
lands of Britannia. I will venture into the new world again, but the
next time, I shall be prepared for these heathens that mankind has named
kewlios! I would swear upon my magic sword, except that KAIN now owns
it. Hmm, I swear upon my underwear that the kewlios shall not prevail
again!</P>
