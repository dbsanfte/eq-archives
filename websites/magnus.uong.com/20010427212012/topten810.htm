<H1 align="center">Top Ten 8/10</H1>
<P>Ladies and gentlemen,</P>

<P>     As we near the one year anniversary of the public release of Ultima
Online, we here at RUIN (Really Useless Infomercials Network) have been
reflecting on the past year. Here, we bring you the top ten best
infomercials for Ultima Online products from the past year. These are
the best of the best advertising scams... er scheming advertisements...
uhm roll the clip.</P>

<P>10. "Do you appreciate quality in clothing? If so, then you'll be pleased
to hear that a new clothing outlet is opening in Vesper right next to
the tailor shop. We have thousands of tailor mules all named Tommy
Hilfiger and Calvin Klein all busy making clothing for you! What would
you pay for such obvious high quality clothes? 6000 gold for a pair of
jeans? Maybe 2500 for a shirt? Not at all! We've slashed prices and this
week you pay only 5995 gold for jeans and 2495 gold for shirts!"</P>
  
<P>9.  "Tired of endless house break in bugs? Rigged Security Systems has
the answer for you! Just send us a copy of your house key along with
compass coordinates and we'll make sure no 'illegal breakins' result in
the loss of your hard earned items!" </P>

<P>8.  "Do you want to make more money? Sure! We all do. Well, now's the
time to get the training you'll need you'll need for tomorrow's jobs. NPC 
career services has the training you want! For 324 gold we can teach thee
all we know of these high demand job skills, tailoring, lumberjacking, 
carpentry, and NPC escorting, or get your guild membership. As always, for
less, we shall teach thee less."</P>

<P>7.  "Has this ever happened to you?</P>

<P>PaTHeTiC:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</P>

<P>PaTHeTiC:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</P>
<P>PaTHeTiC: hahahahaha</P>
<P>Connection Lost</P>
<P>Reconnecting</P>
<P>You are dead.</P>

<P>If you answered, "Hell yes!" then our new SPAM filter is for you. What
does SPAM stand for? We don't know, but we can tell you how our filter
works. Whenever a load of tildes hits your filter, a signal is sent to
the UO servers and offending spammer is permanently polymorphed into the
Taco Bell chihuahua (Yes, I had to look it up. Get over it!) and
everything they say will be translated to one of two phrases, 'Yo quiero
Taco bell!' or 'Viva gorditas!'. Get your SPAM filter today!"</P>

<P>6.  "I guarantee that in 24 hours, you too can be a millionaire just
like me! Learn each and every gold dupe bug that's out there. These
methods are all perfectly legal*. They will absolutely never result in a
ban!** There are absolutely no risks to using any of our methods!***
Here are some testimonies from satisfied customers!</P>

<P>Cheeta: I love this money making method! Screw tailoring! Screw dungeon
crawling! This is the only way to go!</P>

<P>$eXXXy: I started out with 100 gold and a newbie dagger and now I have 5
castles next to every server line! This is as good as it gets!"</P>

<P>What more do you need? Load up ICQ and send us your offer of magic
weapons or armor. We don't need anymore gold because of obvious reasons.
Do it now!"</P>

<P>If not used during GM hours</P>
<P>** If not used during GM hours</P>
<P>*** If not used during GM hours</P>

<P>5.  "Call now and get your very own copy of UO Extreme. We've come up
with this client side hack that gives the user blatant and extremely
unfair advantages over players who choose not to use it. Not only that,
we've also learned how to manipulate the data stream from the UO servers
to give our customers added bonuses! What would you pay for this? IT'S
FREE! You can trust us that no data from your client is being sent to
us. Honest.  Scout's honor. Oh what the hell! Send us your account name
and password now or we hack the Department of Defense and launch the
nukes!!"</P>

<P>4. "BlueKillaz R Us still has a few Energy Vortex 2000 models left in
stock! The recent repuation patch has cut into our sales of these fine
weapons of mass destruction as blue PKers have found all new ways to
harrass and kill. Our loss is your gain! For all the true murderers out
there, grab two or three of these babies and watch your victims fall at
your feet.*"</P>

<P>*BlueKillaz R Us never assumes any responsibilty for loss of life whether those
lives be the intended victim or the caster himself. </P>

<P>3. "Now you can hear the music of Ultima OnLine anywhere you go! Get
UO's greatest hits on LP album or 8 track! On this fine collection of
music you'll hear such hits as....</P>

<P>'The Britain MIDI' by MC British</P>

<P>'The Mean Streets of Ocllo' by The Guild BrothaZ</P>

<P>'Thunk! Now you dead!' by Heavy XB and the Archer Posse</P>

<P>'Alchemy Grind' by Mortar Man featuring Bottle Boy </P>

<P>'The Bank Thief Boogie' by the White Head Five</P>

<P>'Back in True Black' by the KeWL KReW</P>

<P>'Are You Jimmy Ray?' by Jimmy Ray (We know. This song has nothing to do
with UO but we think it's a damn good song. 'Who wants to know? Who
wants to know?') </P>

<P>'Ode to Wooden Shields (Furniture sucks!)' by the Carpenters</P>

<P>'I was PKed' by WTF</P>

<P>And many, many, many more.....(OK there's two more, but you've gotta buy
the album to hear them.)"</P>

<P>2.  "Fresh from our labs, we bring you WD 666. This stuff is WD 40 from
hell! It will automatically upgrade any magic weapon to a
Indestructable, Supremely Accurate XXX of Vanquishing. Use it on
everything! One bottle last up to TWO applications! It normally sells
for as much as 200000 a bottle* but we have a special deal for you! Buy
one bottle now and get a second free! Now even we're not stupid enough
to think you'd go for this, so we're throwing in WD 666 for armor! It
does the same thing for armor that WD 666 for weapons does for weapons.
Are you convinced yet? Probably not because we're about to offer you
more! Call in the next 15 minutes and get a free autographed copy of
Janet Reno's Playboy issue! Want more? Too bad!"</P>

<P>* Hahah You looked at the disclaimer! You actually believed that?  </P>

<P>1.  "Tired of archery being the end all of combat skills? Don't wanna
become an archer yourself? Friends, I've got the answer for you! A
potato gun! Get your very own potato gun and start fighting back!
Archers brag about putting a bolt into an a concrete block. That's
nothing compared to the raw power of the potato gun. Lab tests have
proven that potato guns can shoot a frozen potato THROUGH two car doors and the driver inside!
All you need is a pipe, a purple potion and a potato and BOOM! Goodbye
archer! Hello mashed potatos!"</P>
