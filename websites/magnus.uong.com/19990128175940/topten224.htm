<P>Howdy parters, (Semi-roleplayin' time)</P>

<P>It's that time again. Time to bore you silly with my whining comments
and complaints about the game that we all know and love. Some may find
it hard to believe, but I'm running out of things to gripe about.
Consequently, this post is the Top Ten things to do in town now that the
wilds of Britannia have been tamed. </P>

<P>10. Hang around the bank and wait for a thief. 
Once he comes and starts his thang, summon as many creatures as you can.</P>
<P>Name them all IMATHIEF</P>
<P>Magnus: IMATHIEF follow</P>
<P>Click he/she that dost offend and sit back and ROFLYAO.</P>

<P>9. Have conversations with the NPCs.</P>
<P>*Magnus is walking through Vesper*</P>
<P>You see: Aurora the Guard (Who is wearing a leather bikini- you gotta
love those OSI programmers!)</P>
<P>Magnus: {As Butthead}  Uuuuhhh  Hey Baby.</P>
<P>Aurora: Prithee, be quiet! Mine head hurts. </P>
<P>Magnus: Hehe hehehe hehhehe   hehehe  she said.. hehehe  she said 'head'.</P>
<P>Aurora: If I were to tell thee to go away do not take it amiss.</P>
<P>Magnus: So.. what'cha think about you and me?</P>
<P>Aurora: Mi'lord I do not understand thee.</P>
<P>Magnus: Ya' know. A date. </P>
<P>Aurora: Thou makest no sense.</P>
<P>Magnus: Look darlin' if money's the issue, I'm loaded. I makest lots of
cents.</P>

<P>Ah I could go on all day. (and usually do) It only takes about 10
minutes of doing this and I get a crowd gathered watching me. Sometimes
I even pass the plate helmet for gold coins. I've lost quite a few
helmets though. Darn newbies!</P>

<P>8. Come up with creative emotings (emotions?)</P>
<P>*Magnus starts to make armpit noises* </P>
<P>*Magnus relieves himself on a nearby tree*</P>
<P>*Magnus stares at Aurora*</P>
<P>*Magnus continues hiding* (Ooops, I think I did this one before)</P>
<P>*MaGnUS' ShIfT KeY sTiCkS*</P>
<P>*Magnus eats a large wheel of cheese*
*Magnus gets a very uncomfortable look on his face*
Magnus: If anybody yells Vas Flam yer toast!(Hey! I'm in college,
whatcha expect from me?)</P>
<P>*Magnus grinds an alchemist into the ground*</P>
<P>*Magnus laaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggssss!!!*</P>

<P>7. Polymorph = pure fun</P>
<P>Turn into a chicken.</P>
<P>Cast a gate spell.</P>
<P>Magnus: The chickens of Britannia have something to say!</P>
<P>Magnus: No longer will we suffer under the cruelty of newbies.</P>
<P>Magnus: We have discovered the ways of magic.</P>
<P>Magnus: BEWARE OF THE DREADED CHICK MAGES!!! </P>
<P>(Remember how surprised you were the first time you ran into an orc
mage? Hehe   'Nuff said.)</P>

<P>Tame three or four dogs.</P>
<P>Polymorph into a dog.</P>
<P>Run around the city saying, "Butt Sniffers at Deciet. I'm rounding up a
lynch mob."</P>
<P>or..."I'm a newbie, where's the best place to find trees?"</p>
<P>or..."It's BACON!!!!!!"</p.
<P>or...Just go about your normal buying and selling as if nothing strange
at all is going on. Eventually someone will say something. Deny it!</P>

<P>6. Stand in any crowded place and type the words to Hanson songs. This
drives people crazy! It works better than the Enticement skill. I've
actually had people attack me in town to get me to stop. Sometimes they
offer you a 'gift' to get you to stop. So far, I've gotten 6 sets of
full plate armor, 4000GP in reagents, a few dozen halberds, 10000 sets
of Bone Armor, 900 torches, and enough liquor to intoxicate the entire
population of China. Thanx Hanson. U ROOL! (I don't believe I just typed
that!)</P>

<P>5. Advertise worthless items for outrageous prices.</P>
<P>Magnus: KINDLING FOR SALE!!   100 GP apiece.</P>
<P>Magnus: Full spellbook and reagents for sale. 10 GP for the set ;-)</P>
<P>Magnus: Wand of Harming for sale! 0 charges - Make me an offer.</P>
<P>Magnus: Fur for sale. Makes a great rug. 1000 GP.</P>
<P>Magnus: Livers, heads, arms, and legs for sale. Makes great jerky!</P>

<P>4. Tell a newbie that he can practice his stealing skill on you in town.
(OK so this one is not as good as the purple potion = strength potion) </P>

<P>3. Type everything in 'Pig Latin'</P>
<P>Agnusmay: Ellohay oblenay easantpay. Ovelyay ayday, isay itay otnay?</P>
<P>(Magnus: Hello noble peasant. Lovely day, is it not?)</P>
<P>I've tried this many times and I remained stunned at how few people
realize what I'm doing. Responses include:</p>
<P>"Sorry dude. I don't speak German."</P>
<P>The ever classic, "WTF???"</P>
<P>"Yeah Dude, whatever you say!"  </P>

<P>2. Set up kindling in a 6 pointed star.</P>
<P>Get naked.</P>
<P>Light up! </P>
<P>Stand in the center and when people ask you what you are doing, have one
of the following responses ready.</P>
<P>"I'm in a guild, composed of Grandmaster Campers. We have angered the
OSI gods and are no longer allowed to use campfires. We must appease the
gods."</P>

<P>"Shhhhhh, I'm duping kindling! Don't tell OSI!!"</P>

<P>"This is the ritual for summoning a GM. Didn't you know?"</P>

<P>"What does it look like I'm doing? I'm logging out! Ya mind?"</P>

<P>"HAHAHHAHAH!!   You mean you REALLY don't know?"</P>

<P>1. WARNING! This one is very immature of me but I'm trying to finish the
list and I'm tired. If 'potty humor' offends you, skip to the end. </P>

<P>Create a new character.</P>
<P>Name him " I farted."</P>
<P>This creates funny scenes inside NPC shops when you walk in and 3 NPCs
simultaneously say, "I farted! Coulds't though aid me?"
Note: Becomes better once you reach Lordship - (don't tell me, that one
was really, really bad and should be ashamed of myself)</P>


<P>Well, time to wrap up another list and catch some sleep tonight. Hope
you enjoyed this one too. Thanks for readin'.</P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo, Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Adept Tank Mage who is hummimg MMMBop even as he
sleeps.</P>
