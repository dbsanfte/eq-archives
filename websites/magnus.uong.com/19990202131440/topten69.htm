<P>Welcome friends,</P>

<P>Gather round and ye shall hear a tale full of great sound and fury,
signifying nothing. That's right! Another episode of the Jerry Springer
show! Well, I see the newsgroup has been a little crowded as far as top
ten lists go but I figure there's room for one more. Clear the road, cuz
Magnus is comin' through! I saw a post last week about character aging
and death. I'm not really a supporter of the idea but it got me thinking
about what would happen in Ultima if this were really the case. *deep
breath* Here goes. </P>
<P>------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>Dear UO players,</P>

<P>As you know by now, we at Origin will soon be instituting a new
character aging system. Under this system, characters will grow old and
eventually die. Accompanying this change, there will be several other
new changes to reflect this. </P>

<P>10. Several new items will be craftable</P>
<P>Tailors can now make adult diapers (Want different brands? It Depends on time. That was bad.) and polyester pants</P>
<P>Carpenters can now craft wooden dentures and walking canes</P>
<P>Tinkers can now make eyeglasses and hearing aids</P>
<P>Alchemists can now create bottles of Rogaine and Metamucil</P>

<P>9. Since Buccaneers' Den is so quiet and peaceful, the entire island is
being converted into a nursing home. The bath will be converted into a
health spa. The Bloody Scab healer is being renamed to The Replacement
Hip. The Violente Woodworks will be changed to a Cracker Barrel
restaurant and sell only breakfast and rocking chairs. </P>

<P>8. There will be BINGO nights once a week at the taverns. Prizes will
include kindling, body sashes and orc helms. </P>

<P>7. War axes, (the ones that look like golf clubs) will now be golf
clubs. They will now cost 6 times as much. Once we find an open area
with no houses, we will build golf courses. Of course, given the fact
that there are very few open areas left, we may just see what we can do
with the dungeons. Plans right now include taking all the monsters out
of Covetous, turning the flametraps into water traps, adding a few
windmills and renaming the place Magic Mountain.  We hope to convert the
other dungeons. Each one will have a theme. Other plans:</P>
<P>Water elementals will be reprogrammed to fetch lost balls for players.</P>
<P>Get a hole-in-one and win a free true black fancy shirt with Magic
Mountain on the front</P>
<P>A new plaid coloring for golf clothes</P>

<P>6. Look for buried 'treasure' with the new metal detectors, available at
the provisioner shops.</P>

<P>5. Between the hours of 7 AM and 7 PM bards may practice their music
anywhere. Noise ordinances will be going into place that prohibit the
playing of loud music and or talking between 7PM and 7AM. Only
whispering is allowed. Fines will be imposed for those who break the new
noise code. </P>

<P>4. A social security system will be put into place. When a character is
young, Lord British's guards will take 10% of everything a character
earns. Once a character reaches a certain age, they are eligible for the
social security system. The player recieves half of what they put in and
Lord British takes the rest. </P>

<P>3. New NPC dialouge</P>
<P>What dost thou want, grandpa</P>
<P>Since thou art over the age of 65, I shall give thee a senior citizen's
discount.</P>
<P>Just hand over all your gold sir. I'll handle it for you.</P>
<P>I'm sorry ma'am. We sold out of hair coloring this morning.</P>

<P>2. Be on the lookout for the new Dr. Kervorkian NPCs!</P>

<p>1. A new life insurance system will be introduced. We don't have an FAQ,
for it but you can be sure, you'd be just as baffled after we told you
about it as you would have been had we told you nothing. Thus, we
decided to save time and not write one. If you simply must be baffled,
we suggest reading the United States Tax Code from start to finish.
Either that, or you can try to explain to a five year old that the moon
is *not* following your car. One or the other should suffice.</P>

<p>Regards, OSI Staff</P>
