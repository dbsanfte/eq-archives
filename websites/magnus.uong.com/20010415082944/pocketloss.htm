<P>I read this newsgroup often and see many complaints regarding
pocket loss while playing EverQuest. In my entire month and a half of
play, I'd not experienced the loss of a single pocket (Until today that
is.) so I decided to do a little experimenting to see if I could help my
fellow player. </P>
<P>The first thing on my mind was to find out what kind of pockets are
and are not vulnerable. I started out by playing wearing an outfit with
as many pockets as I could. I put on carpenter pants, a pocket t-shirt
and a denim jacket with at least half a dozen pockets. After six hours
of play, I recounted and all the pockets were there. I thought more.</P>
<P>What if I filled them up? I spent the next half hour filling
pockets with pencils, Pixy Stix, Slim Jims (Oooooh yeeeeah), sour
straws, and small animals. </P>
<P>I sat down again and after I got over the initial pain of being
jabbed in the thigh with six pencils simultaneously, ( I probably should not have sharpened them, in retrospect.) I loaded
EverQuest again, this time during prime time. It was really laggy but
when I finished playing, I recounted and the number of pockets remained
the same. </P>
<P>By this time, I was getting pretty hungry so I went to my freezer
and pulled out a Hot Pocket's philly cheese pocket. After heating it,
and sitting it at my computer desk, I loaded EverQuest and went to get
something to drink. When I returned, I was at the character select
screen and my cat ran out of the room really fast. My HotPocket was
gone! It was lost! Oh I cursed! EverQuest had lost my dinner! </P>
<P>I was about to write a nasty email to Sony demanding the return of
not only my lost pocket but everyone else's too. Then, I realized that
was not the way to get results. Instead, I've decided to bring my plight
here. Friends, newsgroupies, and hungry players around the world, we
must not stand for this! Boycott Sony until they find and return the
lost Hot Pockets to their rightful owners! This is beyond poor customer
support! This is sadistic! Hot Pockets are like gifts from heaven and
Sony should be punished for losing them!</P>
<P>This invariably leads us to other conclusions. We know that pocket
loss is occuring and Sony is turning a blind eye. I believe I have
proved that cloth pockets are safe but there are other pockets that I
can not test because I do not have access to them. For instance, are
marsupials safe while EverQuest is being played? Is there anyone with a
pet <A HREF="http://www.akfkoala.gil.com.au/koala.html">koala</A>, or opossum that can check and see if they're alright. We can
not let this continue!</P>
