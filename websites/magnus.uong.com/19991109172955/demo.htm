<P>It finally happened. I finally got tired of the endless carpentry.
By endless, I mean chopping wood, building furniture, destroying the
furniture because it's about as worthless as a free Compuserve trial, and
repeating. I decided to try out the UO demo that came packaged with the
Second Age CD. I've always wanted to see what UO was like without the
dewds and the lag.</P>
<P>     I installed and ran it. After a few minutes, I appeared in the
Ocllo inn. I was named Avatar, Neophyte warrior. My strength was 24, my
intelligence 21 and my dexterity 21. (A real killing machine!)</P>
<P>     There was a wisp floating behind me and he\she\it welcomed me to
the demo and informed me that it was to be my guide. KeWL my own pet
wisp. "'Wisp attack' 'Wisp report' 'Wisp British' 'Wisp Blackthorn'" I
said. "If you need assistance, just ask me for 'help'" said the wisp.</P>
<P>     I took a step or two and the wisp gave me intructions on door
opening. It was rather pleased with me because I mastered the door
opening skill extremely rapidly. Apparently, being a master door opener
is grounds for something a little more challenging. "Seek the bulletin
board at the tarvern.", I was told. I seeked and I found.</P>
<P>     The bulletin board had one message. "A dragon in the woods is
terrifying the good people of Ocllo. All our efforts to slay the beast
have been unsuccessful, as our swords simply bounce off of his thick
hide. We need someone to step forward and save us all!" I had a sneaking
suspicion that I was to be that someone.</P>
<P>     I took a couple of steps and the wispy one said, "That dragon
sounds like bad news." (No shit Sherlock.) He followed up with, "There
is a sage in this town who may be to tell you a way to stop it." "Whoa
whoa whoa, hold up! I just got door opening down and now I have to kill
a dragon?!?! What kind of a screwed up demo is this?", I blurted. "If
you need assistance, just ask me for 'help'" said the wisp.</P>
<P>     I looked in my pack and saw that all I had in the way of weaponry
was a dagger and a practice longsword. For armor, it was a wooden
shield. "Well, let's hope this sage has a stat increase bug up his
sleeve or Avatar the wonder newbie is gonna be dragon poop tomorrow
afternoon." I located the sage's house and walked inside. Upon
questioning about the dragon, the sage answered, "I can help you. Bring
me a smith's hammer and I shall make a sword that can kill the beast!"
So all this time, this sage was sitting here letting the dragon kill
people at will because he wouldn't get off his lazy ass and walk to the
blacksmith shop? Wait till the good folks of Ocllo (make that the
terrified good folks of Ocllo) get a load of this.</P>
<P>     I went to the blacksmith shop and got the hammer. "Hmm, I wonder if
the guards work in this demo" I thought. *You are attacking Herman!*
"Thou shalt regret thine actions swine!" *Thwack* I'm not dead. "Thou
shalt regret thine actions swine!" *Thwack* I'm still not dead. *Thwack*
*Thwack* *Thwack* Still going. I was invincible! I could rule the world!
I could venture into the most dangerous dungeons without a care! Wait a
sec, I'm stuck on an island. Oh well, at least I can taunt a guard for
once. "Neener neener neener!" was my witty taunt. The guard gave up and
recalled away.</P>
<P>     Back at the sage's house, I handed over the hammer. Then the s.o.b.
wanted my practice sword. I gave it to him and he struck it with the
hammer. The metal shattered away leaving a green glass sword. "This
glass sword will cut through the toughest hide (and still be sharp
enough to slice and dice tomatoes) but beware (there's always a beware)
this sword is fragile and will break after the first time you use it.
"So basically, I'm gonna try and kill this dragon with a broken practice
sword right?" I asked. No answer.</P>
<P>     "Well, let's go rock some dragon ass" I told my wisp friend but he
said I wasn't ready yet. I needed to be able to track the dragon and the
only person who could teach me that skill was the ranger who hangs out
in the library all day. (I thought rangers preferred the forest. Oh yeah
the forests have that slight dragon problem.)</P>
<P>     "Why can't we just wander into the woods until we find the dragon
or he finds us? Ocllo isn't that big.", I said. Quoth the wisp, "If you
need assistance, just ask me for 'help'". *Grumble grumble* I found the
mighty ranger of the library and asked for his aid. He offered to train
me for free! What a swell guy! As an added bonus, he trained me all the
way up to 95 skill level. So now I am Avatar, Master Ranger.</P>
<P>     I tried my new superhuman powers of tracking and it came to little
surprise that I could apparently track any creature on the entire
island. I checked the monsters and sure enough, there was a dragon out
there somewhere. I headed for him, glass sword in one hand, wooden
shield in the other.</P>
<P>     I walked and walked and walked. All of a sudden I heard the dragon
scream/roar and saw a fireball fly at me. I still lived! I couldn't help
taunting again, "Neener neener neener!" I went into war mode and
attacked the dragon. A swing! A miss! A swing! A miss! I checked my
swordsmanship. 2.4 and rising fast! I finally connected and the dragon
fell over. (I think he was just pretending for the demo.) The wisp then
told me about the most important skill of all in Ultima: Looting
corpses!</P>
<P>     Imagine the surprise of the players who log into a real UO server
after experiencing this demo. True to the old rule, this demo is nothing
like the finished product. I thought I'd write my own little demo story
that would introduce a player to how Ultima will really be if they
decide to subscribe to the service.</P>

<P>Magnus' Ultima Online Demo </P>
<P>Vers. 1.0.0</P>

<P>     The player appears in Britain, not with a name like Avatar but
something more kewl, like DrAgOnSKuLL. His attributes will be something
useful like 45/10/10. To aid DrAgOnSKuLL, we have not a wisp but a
tailor mule named MoneyMan. MoneyMan will first show DrAgOnSKuLL how to
macro snooping to raise his dex. Then he'll instruct him to walk to the
bank and check out the bounty board.</P>
<P>     The bank will not be decorated with flowers and an ornate
fireplace. Instead the player will see scattered white haired corpses of
Massengil and ButtPlunger the bank thieves. NPCs dressed in bone armor
and true black robes will be standing around the outside of the bank
saying, "vendor buy bank guards" and "vendor guard my bank buy".</P>
<P>     The bounty board will look like one in game. "Cookie Monster hath
killed too many...." "LeGoMaNiAc must be brought to justice!" etc. At
the bottom of the board will be a player written message. (Ok, we have
to get a little unrealistic there.)</P>
<P>     "my naem is merlin and i am a mage,,,the vednors wont respawn and i
cant get gm mage without regs...bring me regs and i;; give u soemthing
good" MoneyMan tells you that StoneCold might be able to assist you and
that he may be found on the roof of the Empath Abbey.</P>
<P>     After many trials and tribulations, DrAgOnSKuLL finds StoneCold and
asks about the regs. StoneCold tells him, "OSI fuked up the last patch
and vendors dont restock...just loot a house or something" </P>
<P>     It just so happens that MoneyMan knows where a house it. "look for
a house blocking the entrance to destard" The player hoofs it over to
Destard and finds, "Rand Al'Thor's Sex House".</P>
<P>     MoneyMan then instructs him on doorstep hiding and rushing. Rand
Al'Thor returns home and opens his door while DrAgOnSKuLL runs in.
MoneyMan tilde spams him and causes him to lose connection while
DrAgOnSKuLL steals his keys. DrAgOnSKuLL and MoneyMan loot the house and
rummage through the bags of clothes and clothes and torches and gems and
bags of bags and then, in a bag in a pack in a pouch in a chest in a
crate in a small box in a bookshelf in an armoire in a pear tree they
find a little green sack.</P>
<P>     Upon opening the sack, their prayers are answered. There are 2000
of each reg! Now to find Merlin, but how? MoneyMan tells DrAgOnSKuLL to
ask at the Britain bank. "NE1 KNOW WHERE MERLIN LIVES?" screams
DrAgOnSKuLL over and over and over at the bank. Finally, CrUnChBeRRieZ
the archer answers him. "he lives at brit xroads in large forge".</P>
<P>     MoneyMan and DrAgOnSKuLL venture to the crossroads and finally find
Merlin's abode. The sign hanging on it says, "MeRLiN's CrAcK HoUsE". The
door opens and Merlin steps outside. "u have regs?", he says. "yeh i
do..where's reward?" asks DrAgOnSKuLL. "right here" say Merlin and
MoneyMan in unison.</P>

<P>"Corp Por" they utter.</P>

<P>*Merlin is attacking you!*</P>
<P>*MoneyMan is attacking you!*</P>

<P>You are dead. Thanks for playing the UO demo. We hope to see you online
very soon!</P>
