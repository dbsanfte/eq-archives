</HEAD>
<P>All this past quarter, I've been attending classes and playing
EverQuest. Many of my friends say I'm taking the game way too seriously. I don't think this is the case. I really think they're just jealous of the towel with the Scotch tape design that I've been wearing for a kilt.</P>

<P>It's always something with my friends. They tell me over and over that I really should stop playing EverQuest for a while and study for my exams. "WTF?", I ask them. "i can jstu cast spirit of teh engeneer on myslef..u must b newbies" This usually shuts them up. I guess I showed them. </P>
                    
<P>Things have been going really well for me since I got EverQuest. I look at life in a completely different way now. For instance, I just got my spirit of the
wolf spell and I've not been late to a single class all quarter. My friends assure me that my car would be faster, but they just want to see me come to class late. I just leave at 5 in the morning when the undead stuff stops spawning and head to school. And it works! That's right, I'm usually sitting by the door six hours before the class starts. I use the time to meditate and regain hit points from all the dogs that attack me on the way.</P>

<P>My summon food spells have also been a huge money saver. Who needs a Big Mac and fries when black bread and brown water fills you up for the
same amount of time? Of course, all the black bread has caused me to have to spend a lot of time meditating in the bathroom. That may be the only downside of the spells.</P>
    
<P>What's more, my social life has improved greatly since I got EQ. I just
apply what I've learned of socialization in the game to real life 
situations. For instance, if I see a pretty female human, I now say, "wow ur cute". This goes over wonderfully well. I usually follow up with the standard questions: " r u a reel girl?" and "do u mind if i look at ur equipment?" </P>

<P>I have to be honest here. Many times, the other player turns red and walks away. Other times, especially if they are with a human male, I get challenged to a duel. However, one time I went through the preceding questions and I was invited to the girl's residence. She must have had EQ Topless installed because she showed me some new texture maps that I'd never seen before! Oh it was loads of fun, I can assure you.</P>

<P>One of my professor's complained about the rat livers I was carrying in my pack. I said, "look dumass..therye venom sacs not rat livers" He told me that he didn't care what they were and to throw them away. He just wanted to get them after I left and sell them for himself. </P>

<P>I feel like EverQuest has enhanced my life but everyone I meet thinks
otherwise. I think they just want me to stop so they can have my polar bear hat. I know it! Can anyone give me some advice as to how to get my friends to quit bugging me? I tried dueling them but they ran away and I don't see them much anymore. They say I'm too serious about EQ, are they right?</P>
