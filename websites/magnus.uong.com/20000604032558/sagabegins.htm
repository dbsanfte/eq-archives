<P>Episode One: The PK Menace</P>

<P>The kewlio guild PimpZ in Space Suits (PISS) has set up a blockade
around the small RP community of Noboots. PISS is rumored to be a PK
guild. While the development team endlessly debates the PK issue, the
leader of the ATM guild sends two tank mages, disguised as RPing
ambassadors to Noboots to personally resolve the dispute.</P>

<P>The two tank mages, Hi On Gin and Only One Cahoney, recall to the
outskirts of Noboots to meet with the leaders of PISS. They are led to a
small house where unbeknowst to them, they are grey to the owners of the
house. The leaders of PISS, suspect them to be tank mages rather than
RPers, have a poison elemental gated into the house. </P>

Noboots.</P>
