<H1 align="center">Top Ten 7/7/99</H1>
<P>Greetings groupies of the games,</P>

<P>     I would imagine most of the people reading this have been to at
least one children's section of a software store and looked at the
titles they have. Kinda scary aren't they? Here are the top ten
children's software packages that you'll never see. This one was
partially inspired by a list of children's books that I saw a few weeks
back.</P>

<P>10. Quake: The Kindergarten Years</P>
<P>Quake's back and cuter than ever. In this action packed sequal to Quake
III, little tikes can get in on the action too. Levels include a
playground, a bathroom, a bedroom and the inside of mom's minivan. Blast
your way through 10 levels of whining, crying, and sharing! All new
weapons include rubber dart guns, boogers, spitballs, and rocks! A blast
for your preschooler, it teaches while they have fun. Kids learn the
proper way to use handguns and how effectively operate in combat
situations.</P>

<P>9. Barney's Drug Adventure</P>
<P>Your children are in for a real treat in Barney's Drug Adventure.
They'll follow Barney as he explores Dope Land in search of his lost
drugs. Dope Land is a fun filled world filled with swirling colors and
Pink Floyd music. Kids will be learn all about marajuana, amyls,
cocaine, LSD, crack, and ether. But beware, the evil Narcotics officers
are hot on Barney's trail and aim to stop his fun filled romp through
this hazy world. With your child's help, Barney can finish his trip in
peace. Software also includes online registration and adds buyer's
signature to a petition to legalize marajuana. Narrated by Hunter S.
Thompson. First 10,000 copies sold include free rolling papers and crack
pipes.</P>

<P>8. Tomb Raider IV: Raiders of the Late Night Fridge</P>
<P>Lara's back and bigger than ever, literally. If you've played any of the
other Tomb Raiders, you've spent hours staring at Lara's tiny butt. That
small gluteus maximus is now 4 feet wide! It seems Lara has been taking
it a little too easy since her last adventure and has packed on the
pounds. It's up to you to help her navigate through level after level,
through indoor swimming pools, gyms, and tennis courts in a quest for
her lost figure. With your help, she may just win the battle of the
bulge. Cameo appearance by Richard Simmons.</P>

<P>7. Thomas the Tank Engine meets Stan the School Bus</P>
<P>It's a messy situation on the tracks, when Stan the School Bus decides
that he can beat Thomas across the tracks. Through storytelling and
graphic photos of real train accidents, kids learn the dangers of
crossing train tracks.</P>

<P>6. The Great Sesame Street Murder Mystery</P>
<P>Whodunit? That's what all the muppets would like to know. Elmo's body
was found late last night and now the hunt begins. Search for clues on
Sesame street and put them together to find the real killer. Was it Big
Bird, Ernie, or Grover? That's up to you to decide in this game that's
sure to occupy you for hours. (Bert is Evil by the way.) </P>

<P>5. National Geographic Presents: Naked Tribeswomen from Around the World</P>
<P>You're not dumb. You know that little Jr. is only interested in National
Geographic magazine because of the occasional nude photographs we
publish. In NGP:NTFATW, we've got all the nude pictures in one place!
Hours of fun for any boy!</P>

<P>4. Mike Tyson Teaches Vocabulary</P>
<P>Want to make sure that your little boy or girl knows how to say lots of
big words even if they don't know what those words mean? In this game,
kids learn 'big words' or they get their ears bitten. Consumer Reports
calls the game a complete waste of money but that's ludicrous. It's just
ludicrous. Ludicrous is one of the many three syllable words that your
children will learn to pronounce. As we said before, they won't have the
slightest what the words actually mean but at least they can 'work them
in' and pretend that they're smart. In the end, looking smart is all
that matters. right?</P>

<P>3. Marylin Manson in "Being Different is OK"</P>
<P>Do I really need to write anything here?</P>

<P>2. The Adventures of Condom Man and Diaphragm Dog</P>
<P>It was a hot, steamy night when this dynamic duo met...</P>

<P>1. Barbie Fashion Designer: Maternity Edition</P>
<P>Kids can now immerse themselves in the role of maternity clothing
designer! It seems Barbie and Ken have been spending a little too much
time together and now Barbie has a bun in the oven. Barbie has a problem
though. What to wear? This is where your kids come in. Children can
choose from several hot maternity fashions. Game includes the new
Maternity Barbie doll. Turn her upside down under a faucet and watch her
stomach swell. In a matter of minutes, she'll look nine months pregnant.
To deliver the baby, just squeeze her stomach and out pops Ken Jr.
Warning: Maternity Barbie should not be aimed at children or pets.</P>

<P>     I am a truly sick individual.</P>
