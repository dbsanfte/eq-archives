<P>Hail to theeZ,</P>

<P>     I was asked last week to write a top ten list pertaining to
mining\blacksmithing. It just so happens that I've been working on a
blacksmith for about a month and a half now and have a pretty good feel
for it. So, here's the top ten reasons to create your very own
miner\blacksmith. (I'm warning you now, this list is against my better
judgement. I don't do well when a topic is presented to me.)</P>


<P>10. Become a miner! (Ok, why?) See the world! (In black and white.) Meet
interesting people! (FuQiN HoEZ and TROJAN MAN) Experience new cultures!
(thsi sux!1 he olny has 10 ignots)</P>

<P>9. Making GM magery was just waaay too easy. (And Origin, it's not! So
don't get any ideas.)</P>

<P>8. There's just something zen like about watching the same mining
animations over and over for hours at a time. Besides, that last object
macro key looks alot better with a hole worn into it.</P>

<P>7. Trade window exploits! There's nothing I love more than paynig 1500
gold for 2 ingots. It's makes me appreciate them more.</P>

<P>6. Losing 2 hours of mining work to SalaD ShooTeR and his guild, Killer
Kucumbers makes the game much more fun and exciting and nonboring!</P>

<P>5. Just be thankful, that's right _thankful_ that you can even mine at
all.</P>

<P>4. You thought all the people in Covetous screaming 'MINE! MINE!' were
just singing the praises of this skill. (Hey! I'm trying to get through.
They can't all be funny can they?)</P>

<P>3. You read on the update page that your mining skill will soon affect
the success of your animal lore skill which will affect the success of
your alchemy skill which will affect the success of your meditation
skill which will delete any tank mage characters on your shard.</P>

<P>2. Those kewl 3d pictures that hidden in the moutains. No really! You
have to cross your eyes and move your face back and forth till you see
them? I can't be the only one that's seen them! </P>

<P>1. You don't think exceptional platemail crafted by Hammer, minerguy, XX
Chaos XX, a pimp, nine inch nails, IRONMAN, or StoneCold is kewl.</P>

<P>     To the hardcore miners out there, I feel your pain. Keep up the
good fight! Leave the amatuer miners to SPAM at the bank, "25 SHADOW
INGETS 4 SELL!!"</P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo,Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Grandmaster Tank Mage who didn't feel like paying 5000
for 25 shadow ingots</P>
