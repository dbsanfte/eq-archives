<P>Welcome to The Magnus Files. Here you will find pictures and writing that are sure to give you a chuckle
about that game that occupies so much of our time. Please leave all seriousness, beverages, cigarettes, shoes, purses, wallets,
chihuahuas, cats, and motor oil at the door. Consider this your only warning.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="center">About the Page</H2>
<P>This page is the result of lots and lots of Pepsi®. Without it, I might not even be alive. I would also like the thank Taco Bell for all the semi-mexican food. You guys are the best!</P>
<P>If you have a question, compliment, search warrant, suggestion, idea for world peace, good recipe for cheese dip, theory on why Hanson is so @#$% popular, or anything else, use the above link to send me what's on your mind. I just love getting lots of E-Mail. 
Well, unless it's trying to get me to buy a Pamela Anderson/Tommy Lee honeymoon video. So if you aren't trying to sell me something, mail early and mail often!</P>  
<P><Font size=2>Legal Issues: In other words, the stuff that I put in really small letters to hurt your eyes. All material on this site, unless otherwise indicated is written by me. Just thought you'd like to know that. What else do you say in these disclaimer thingies? Oh yeah, I know. No virtual animals were hurt in the making of this page. My cat did get in front of me while I was typing and knocked my Pepsi off my desk. I don't think it hurt him but I thought it might be wise to include it here. Steve also told me that while creating the DNS for my site, he ran over his cat's tail with his chair. If you have cats present while viewing this page, please have them leave the room. Other things? OK Price plus tax, tag, title, and fees. First month's payment due at signing. Offer ends soon.</P>
