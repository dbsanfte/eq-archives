<P>Aloha kahunas,</P>

<P>     I spent an hour or two tonight with the new ranger guild that's
formed on Catskills. What a fun time! I first went to the meeting in
tank mage attire and then switched to my 'powergamed player with the
practice weapon of death'! I got to see Greywind, Gresh, and several
other newgroupies who were under assumed names and stuff like that.</P>
<P>     Anyway, on to the subject of top tens. I have a doozy of a top ten
working in my head but I just have not been able to finish it. You
people have been waiting patiently while I've been working through my
Zelda complex, so I'm going to give you a top ten right now. The
subject, uhm there is no subject. As a matter of fact, this is going to
be the most off topic top ten list I've done since the Physics top ten.
These are random observations, comments, and questions about UO, life,
the universe, and cheeze whiz.</P>

<P>10. We now have the Skara Brae Rangers and the Empath Abbey Rangers. I
want to name the next group of rangers, the Power Rangers! The bad guys
will think we're kewl like them and we could use it as a running joke
for lots of gags. We could use it to divide into teams. Red rangers,
yellow rangers, blue rangers, etc. Then we could all talk in *extremely*
corny dialogue and use the same plots over and over and over and over
and over and at the end of each battle, we'd all learn a very important
lesson. More corny dialogue and roll the credits.</P>

<P>9. Where do dumb people come from?</P>
<P>I was busy working at my job as stockman in a small store when I noticed
a woman staring at the spray paint section and scratching her head. I
continued working and saw that she was still there after about 15
minutes. I finally went over and asked her if she needed any help and
she said, "Yes! How do I tell what's the color of the spray paint in the
cans?" (All the different color caps didn't clue her in.) How does a
person grow up in the nineties without knowing how to tell what color
spray paint is by looking at the cap?</P>

<P>8. My name tag at work was wearing out and fading so I told the manager
I was going to need a new one but I wanted a new name on it. I wanted a
UO inspired name tag. She laughed and said, "OK, what's your new name
going to be?"</P>
<P>Me: AzzKicka</P>
<P>Mgr: Uhm, no</P>
<P>Me: How about Goat Rapist?</P>
<P>Mgr: No</P>
<P>Me: Stone Cold?</P>
<P>Mgr: No</P>
<P>Me: Chef Boyardee?</P>
<P>Mgr: Haha no</P>
<P>Me: Hmmm those are the best names I know. Why don't you just put my real
name with alternating capitals?</P>

<P>7. Why is it that when a friend calls you at work, they always ask, "So,
what are you doing?" I'M AT WORK! WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING? Somebody
asked me that today. I told them I was brushing up on my wheelchair
basketball and earning a merit badge for tying a sheepshank knot. </P>

<P>6. Why does Cheez Whiz taste so nasty? Being in college, I am somewhat
of a junkfood expert. You'd think Cheez Whiz would be one of the big
boys when it comes to junk food but it scores a gigantic thumbs down
with me. My favorite junk food combo? Nacho cheese Bugles and that
cheese that squirts out of the can. Isn't that stuff great? Whoever
invented cheese that squirts out of a can should be awarded a Nobel
Peace prize. (Him and the guy who invented WD40) Oh squeezey cheeze we
hail thee!</P>

<P>5. I give up Paula, where HAVE all the cowboys gone?</P>

<P>4. I thought I'd seen the end of this a few months ago but the
phenomenon is back. What is up with all the bearded female mages? Create
Hair spell? And many many other jokes not nearly as tasteful as that one
but definitely much funnier. I will refrain.</P>
<P>As our KeWLiO friends would say:</P>
<P>PH34R teh B34RD!!</P>

<P>3. Since you've been playing UO, have you had urges to go out and buy
ginseng, garlic, or maybe even some nightshade? Or is it just me?</P>

<P>2. Aren't incorrectly spelled guild titles one of the funniest things
you can see? There is a guild of 'knites' running around Catskills. The
the head of this guild calls himself the 'apocalips knite'. I've also
seen lots of 'inforsers' running around. Military titles can be funny
too. I've seen 'captins', a 'kernel'(He didn't get any of my popcorn
jokes.), and an 'admirable'.</P>

<P>1. You know you are spending too much time on the internet if you check
your E-mail and have no messages and then immediately check it again.
Let's have a show of hands out there. *Magnus raises hand*</P>

<P>     So, do you like this random, meandering style of top ten list? It
was kinda fun. I hope to have a completely UO related one in a few days.</P>

ten craving for a day or two</P>
