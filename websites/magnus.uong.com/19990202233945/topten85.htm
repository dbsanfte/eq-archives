<P>Hail friends,</P>

<P>    Now that we are under the influence of the "Armageddon" patch, I'm
going to crank out an impromptu top ten list. OSI just keeps on coming
up with material for me. Here they are, the top ten things good about
the new patch.</P>

<P>10. No carving from corpses. This is the first step in the archery
revisions. No feathers = no arrows. This also makes cooking a much more
important skill since ribs won't be so widely available.</P>

<P>9. Healing is back and it's here to stay! Healers all up in da house
now, biatch!</P>

<P>8. Item decay.  DD says there are too many items. They are getting rid
of all items! Too many houses? They are taking care of that too. PKers
using vendors for key storage? Well, they've got that covered as well.
And you thought they didn't test this thing! Oh ye of little faith.
Who's laughing now?</P>

<P>7. Skill decay.  We've been seeing increasing complaints about the
difficulty of raising skill points. Well, with stats in the single
digits and teens, you should see your skills rocketing up again!</P>

<P>6. Hey! Count your blessings. Lumberjacking still works! I know this one
for sure, I tried it.</P>

<P>5. Who needs the spell bug fixed or the house break in bugs fixed when
begging is working correctly again?</P>

<P>4. If half the players quit, there'll be less lag and more resources for
those players that stick around.</P>

<P>3. Work continues apace on the creature behavior upgrade! What's gonna
happen in that patch? Will we have slimes running around in death robes
robbing folks at the bank? Will 'I will take thee' spammers be permantly
polymorphed into pigs? Will horses ride people? Will killing cows ever
stop hurting karma?(Damn Chik Filet hackers!) Will GMs appear as sloths
to the players? Will chickens lay coconuts? (Might bring Cyclone back.)</P>

<P>2. No houses = no house breakins</P>

<P>1. UO Extreme doesn't work anymore. Of course, nothing else does either
but why quibble over details?</P>

<P>I apologize for the lack of real humor here but I'm more than a little
frustrated this evening. Until next time, I remain...</P>
