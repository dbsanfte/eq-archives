<H1 align="center">The Hekawi Tribe</H1>
<P>The members of NGI decided to have a meeting where everyone showed up as a KeWLdOOD PKer.
After the first gathering, everyone in attendence had so much fun that they decided to do another.
Led by Gresh and his guild, the second meeting of the Hekawi tribe had to be one of the best nights
I've ever spent on Ultima.</P>
<P>The members gathered behind the Empath Abbey. I came to the party as <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi1.jpg">MaStA MaG</A>.
 Our leader, played by Gresh, was <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi2.jpg">Chief G</A>. The first thing on the agenda was standing
in <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi3.jpg">line</A> to join the guild. Gresh told us we then had to die. I think he was trying to trick us 
out of our death robes.</P>
<P>We were gated to Deceit island and lined up again. In this <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi4.jpg"> shot</A> you can get an idea of just how many 
of us there were. The first target was the ShadowClan Orks. After a top ten list from yours truly and a gate, we headed for the <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi5.jpg"> fort</A>.
The battle that ensued was excellent.</P>
<P>The Hekawi <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi6.jpg">attacked</A> fiercly. We almost <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi7.jpg">broke</A> into the fort, but the orks 
<A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi8.jpg">dispatched</A>us quickly. No matter, in a matter of seconds we found their permanent <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi9.jpg">evil healer</A> and planned the second onslaught.</P>
<P>The plan was to rush them again. I sounded the order to <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi10.jpg">attack</A> and we faced to orks again. We were more successful this time. I got <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi11.jpg">inside</A>
for almost ten seconds before <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi12.jpg"> succumbing</A> to the hail of arrows and taunts. No matter, in a matter of seconds we found their permanent <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi9.jpg">evil healer</A> and planned the next onslaught.</P>
<P>The plan this time was to try <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi14.jpg"> diplomacy.</A> It didn't <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi15.jpg">work</a>.</P>
<P>I missed the trip to Covetous, I was talking to a <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi17.jpg"> healer.</A></P>
<P>Back to <a href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi20.jpg">Deceit island</a>, and the next adventure. We attempted to rob the <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi16.jpg">Vesper Bank</a>. It didn't last long. The bank had increased security. A guard <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi18.jpg">whacked</a> us all. I issued a
 <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi19.jpg">warning</A> to onlookers before we left.</P>
<P>For the final phase, we were gated to the <A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi21.jpg">Chaos Shrine</a> where a funny battle of sorts took place. The group became spread out as many members headed for Wind. There was a real PKer at the shrine wearing a red robe just like the ones we had at the Vesper bank robbery. He seemed to think it was funny killing 
newly ressurected people. I got there and he chased me. I'm not too bad at running if I do say so myself and let the guy chase me. He was a Grandmaster warrior chasing me, an apprentice beggar. He was so pitiful, I had time to type full sentence taunts at him while running. No time for screen shots though I am afraid. I ran figure eights around trees. One time he chased me around a 
dead body for for 4 or 5 minutes. In thirty minutes, he only managed to kill me 3 or 4 times. (I stuck aroiund the Chaos Shrine taunting him, trying to get him to chase me. It worked very well!) PuNkUrDEAD, (another tribe member) showed up with tame wolves. We managed to kill the guy and I took his red robe and wore it. He got really mad then and called me really bad names. 
<A href="http://magnus.uong.com/hekawi/hekawi22.jpg">Here</A> is his picture if you'd like to look him up on Catskills some time, also notice me wearin his robe. ;^) </P>
<P>And that was the end of the evening for me.</P>
