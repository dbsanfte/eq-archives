<P>Wuzzup,</P>

<P>     Here they are, the top ten new changes coming soon to player run
vendors.</P>

<P>10. A new skill called vending will be introduced. A grandmaster vendor
will get an invulnerable tag and a set of clothes that don't match.
After awarded these powers, the real fun begins. You get to stand around
perfectly still until a player walks up to buy something. Sound boring
to you? Well, you could be out mining. Besides, no one ever says, 'miner
buy bank guards' do they?</P>

<P>9. Vendors without the following items will be deleted.</P>
<P>-Platemail legs crafted by ANVIL MAN</P>
<P>-Platemail gorget crafted by Thor's Smith</P>
<P>-Chainmail tunic crafted by (Insert any RP name here) Ironforge</P>
<P>-Heavy Crossbow crafted by Woodchuck</P>
<P>-Bow crafted by BigWoody</P>
<P>-Fancy shirt crafted by FUBU</P>
<P>-Fancy skirt crafted by HELL'S KNIGHT OF DEATH</P>

<P>8. There will soon be vendors named 'a' appearing all over Britannia.</P>

<P>7. Vendors that don't sell the merchandise given to them by their
employers within 30 UO days will randomly have 'blue light specials' and
charge half the price of an NPC shop for your goods.</P>

<P>6. Vendors will gain AI! They will talk about their employer while
he/she is not present, gossip with the other vendors, argue with
customers, go on strike occasionally, and take cigarette breaks.</P>

<P>5. Vendors who have been employed a very long time will be prone to
nervous breakdowns during which they start attacking anyone that walks
by with a deadly poisoned katana crafted by BaLLz OF STeeL.</P>

<P>4. To make player run vendors more realistic, they will wander into the
wilderness until they gather at the entrance to Covetous and PK anybody
that comes along.</P>

<P>3. Any vendor facing north will be turned into an escort NPC and ask to
be taken to the 'projects' in Nu'Jelm. Once delivered, they will hand
over all their merchandise to the escorter as a reward.</P>

<P>2. Vendor deeds will soon weigh 1000 stone and look just like a pile of
gold.</P>

<P>1. At the request of Magnus, you will have the option to create a Tank
Vendor. You then choose the color, gold, bronze, silver, black, or blue.</P>

<P>     Good night everybody.</P>
