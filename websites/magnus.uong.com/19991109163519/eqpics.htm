<P>It seems that this picture of my EverQuest character inspired one of the viewers of my page to draw a picture of my character and send it to me. I have to say, this guy is a fantastic artist and is very good at what he does. I am honored to have had my picture drawn by him. To look at this work of art, click <A HREF="http://magnus.uong.com/rayvie1.jpg">here.</a> The artist is known only as Reilly.
