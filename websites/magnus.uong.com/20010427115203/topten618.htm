<P>Salutations,</P>

<P>Time for another top ten list. I spent all evening last night waiting
for a murder to clear so I could return to town and even though I had
company, it still got a little boring. I made the best of it and wrote a
top ten list whilst I did wait. (Don't worry Boomer. ;) Here they are,
the top ten observations and questions about the new reputation system.</P>


<P>10. The guild wars still have my head spinning. My first experience with
them went like this. I was sitting in my house next to the Ocllo bank.
About a dozen members of the notorious SUN guild ran by. All the members
of SUN wear yellow robes. Soon, 8 or 9 yellow robes ran by (with SUN
members inside) in the opostie direction being chased by a new
conglomerate guild called Azure who, oddly enough, wear blue clothing.
I'll first say that I despise SUN and everything they stand for. (They
used to be an EVer guild.) I'm not in Azure but I decided to lend my
efforts to their cause. SUN kept running to obscure areas and hiding. I
took a robe that I had and dyed it SUN yellow. I found a few members of
Azure and told them I would help. They hid. I found some SUN members who
were taking a breather and quickly spammed some of the guys needed help
and I'd take them. I led them into the little trap. \=-) Heck, I even
ICDed Gresh so he could bring a few of his guild's thieves to make SUN's
battle all the more difficult.  </P>

<P>9. The cows of Britannia are carrying around signs that say "Eat mor
chikin". Apparently, some Chik-Filet employees hacked Origin's servers
and made killing cows hurt karma.</P>

<P>8. It seems the new titles are giving some people a little trouble. Come
on Origin! You know you've got to keep the words under three syllables
for the general UO populace to understand them. I can't count how many
times I've seen, "WTF? commendable what the hell does that mean?", "is
despicable good or bad" (Geeze just ask Daffy Duck), or "hehe cool im
ignoble/infamous and i didn't even try to be good". I suggest a revision
of the title system. A few suggestions.</P>
<P>The good\The bad(the ugly? couldn't resist) - gotta keep it simple for
some folks</P> 
<P>The k3wl\The lam3r</P>

<P>7. With all the recent talk of karma, I've been expecting to see some
Hindu or Buddhist guilds forming. OK, bad joke time. I saw a bumper
sticker that said, "My karma ran over my dogma."</P>

<P>6. You stole my fame!</P>
<P>No I didn't it was mine!</P>
<P>Yes you did, I was here first!</P>
<P>Doesn't matter, I did the most work!</P>

<P>Another day in Shame or a Jackson family reunion. (I'm talking about
*Michael Jackson* now Mr. Al Gore, not *Michael Jordan*. There's a huge
difference in the two.)</P>

<P>5. As Boomer said, there are quite a few new guilds forming. The new
guilds are being very creative with respect to their initialing. A few
examples. </P>
<P>FuQ    NWO    PIG (at war with BBQ I'm sure) </P>
<P>SoL    BBQ    HO (I think this is a farmer's guild.)</P>
<P>rAd    PP (I think they wear yellow like SUN.)     </P>
<P>WAR    ATM (Association of Tank Mages)</P>

<P>4. Since I've now had first hand experience with the murderer status, I
have a few questions about it.</P>
<P>Does lag time count towards the eight hours?</P>
<P>Can I get off in six hours on good behavior?</P>
<P>If I can prove that I was abused as a Novice Tank Mage, can I get my
murders cleared?</P>
<P>If I explain to folks that my murderer status is a bug, will they still
attack me?</P>
<P>Is there any way, I could get some hours of community service? (Picking
up trash maybe? I'd even wear stripey clothes.)</P>
<P>My murder status finally decayed late last night, do I have to see a
parole officer now?</P>
<P>Will this affect my future career opportunities?</P>
<P>Can I get on the Jerry Springer show?</P>

<P>3. The old noto PKers are just as pathetic as ever.</P>
<P>I was in Moonglow, close to the cemetary with my archer character and
see four dead bodies. Six tank mages standing around and a walrus and
polar bear are guarding the gate. You know me, always suspicious, I
figured Criminal Flag PKers (CFPKs). After playing dumb and talking with
them for awhile I found out the real story. You see, the polar bear and
the walrus walked through someone's gate and ended up in the Moonglow
cemetary. They were so pissed that they started wasting anyone and
everyone who came to the graveyard. They declared that the grave yard
was theirs and started guarding the gate. The six tank mages had been
called by the ghosts of the dead bodies and were waiting around to see
if the animals really were attacking. They wanted me to test it out.
They told me not to worry, they would protect me. And to think I doubted them!</P>

<P>2. All the 'reformed' PKers running around are pretty easy to spot.</P>
<P>The Prominent DoPeHeAd - That's not too smart is it?</P>
<P>The Admirable Sweaty Nuts (Maybe admirable is going a little too far.)</P>
<P>The Reputable MaStA of DiZaStA</P>
<P>The Noble Crack Dealer</P>
<P>The Ignoble of the Abyss</P>
<P>The Rude of Death (Doesn't quite have the same ring as Dread Lord.)</P>
<P>The Proper Butt Fuk (If you're gonna do something, do it properly.)</P>

<P>1. We can finally have safe conversations with those old PKers. </P>
<P>kRad: hehe i sure am gonna miss mining</P>
<P>Magnus: You can still mine. Get some shovles and go to Minoc.</P>
<P>kRad: no u moron - i maen whaking a miner and tkaing his ignots</P>
<P>Magnus: That's pretty pathetic don't you think?</P>
<P>kRad: i thik you suk</P>
<P>Magnus: I think you're dodging the question.</P>
<P>kRad: u must be an old man who likes frech whores (I still haven't
figured this one out yet.)</P>
<P>Magnus: Uhm, ok. How old are you anyway? 13 or 14 years old? (Mental age
folks.)</P>
<P>kRad: u cocksucker</P>
<P>Magnus: Now, now play nice. I'll have to put you in time out if you keep
calling people names.</P>
<P>kRad: u bastard - if it werent for the rep patch - u would be dead
heheheheh</P>
<P>Magnus: If it weren't for your spinal chord, you'd be brain dead. (Now that's good insulting there.)
'hehehehehe'</P>
<P>kRad: WTF? god u r such a moron!!!! (I got 4, count 'em 4 exclamation
points out of him. I don't guess he got my joke.)</P>
<P>Magnus: You already called me a moron, come on try again. Be original.
Surely in all your months of PKing you learned to insult better than
that.</P>
<P>kRad: u suk!!</P>
<P>Magnus: Look at your journal. You'll see all the things you've already
called me. It gets really boring seeing the same taunts over and over.</P>
<P>kRad: Kal Ort Por </P>
<P>Magnus: hehe that wuz k3wL  </P>
