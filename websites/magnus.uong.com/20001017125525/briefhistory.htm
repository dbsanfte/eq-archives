<p align="center"><font size="5">A Brief History of My Life</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">I've been playing video games for
a long time. How long you may ask? I can remember a time when the
number of MegaMan games was less than two, or even less than one
for that matter. I have <em>saved</em> money to buy Atari 2600
games. I have dragged my mother into my room to take a picture of
my high score in Pitfall so I could get an 'Official Pitfall
Harry Jungle Explorer Club' Patch*. I know that the little guy in
Pitfall is named Harry. I know that Mario used to date a girl
named Daisy before that bitch princess showed up. I used to read
advertisements for Atari 2600 tennis games that proclaimed &quot;Tennis
so real, the ball has a SHADOW!&quot;</font></p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><font size="3">* The picture of the
        television screen was far too blurry and did not show the
        score at all. I was emotionally crushed. Maybe someone in
        charge of the Official Pitfall Harry Jungle Explorer Club
        will read this and make me an honorary member. </font><p><font
        size="3">I don't feel like blowing out the inside of an
        Atari cartridge for 15 minutes so I can play it without
        that BRRRZMZMZMM sound that the TV makes when you try to
        stick something in the Atari that doesn't belong, like
        half a can of Mt. Dew. I don't think it's worth all that
        just so I can get a screen shot that 3 people will spend
        2 seconds looking at. So, to the right is a picture of my
        highest score in Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Sure, it's not
        Pitfall, but one BILLION points beats the shit out of any
        score I ever got in in Pitfall. And ABBA never showed up
        at my house and got the fourth best score on Pitfall
        either. It's also got Wolverine in it and I'm pretty sure
        he could kick Pitfall Harry's ass any day of the week.</font></p>

        games. Oh my God, have I read about games. I own more
        pounds of magazines than I do pounds of automobile.
        They're not even good magazines either! It's not like
        boxes and boxes of Playboys that retain their value over
        time, these are Nintendo Power, and Sega Visions, and
        GamePro, etc. The content of these magazines is
        questionable at best but the Fan Mail sections are *almost*

        size="3">the stupidest thing I've ever read</font></a><font
        size="3">.</font><p><font size="3">For instance, to the
        left is Steve Bell, the greatest gamer that ever lived.
        His tips for Zelda were to &quot;collect all the hearts
        and weapons you can find&quot;. And to think that I'd
        been leaving them on the ground for years! If my brother
        hadn't told me his tip for the game: &quot;You're not
        supposed to run into the damned monsters.&quot;, I might
        still be trying to figure out why the game was so
        ridiculously easy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">When I read this letter from Steve
        again yesterday, I got excited. If that's all it takes to
        get published in a magazine, I could send in my Pitfall
        tips (Don't fall into holes. Collect all the treasure you
        find and timing is everything! Don't use a polaroid
        camera to take a picture of a television screen.) to an
        Atari magazine and plug my web site at the same time. But
        alas, no one publishes an Atari magazine any more. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Does any one have Steve Bell's e-mail
        address? He's the only one who would understand where I'm
        coming from here.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Of course, the people that wrote
these magazines were often just as clueless as the people that
read them. One issue of Nintendo Power announced that PCs don't
yet match the &quot;graphic power&quot; that the Nintendo 64
posesses. And just to be fair, one issue of Sega Visions claimed
that just because the Genesis version of Street Fighter 2 took up
24 megs of space on the cartridge compared the Super Nintendo
versions' 20 megs, the Genesis version was superior. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The magazines, although aimed at
the 13 and under crowd, printed articles that listed specs such
as internal bus speeds, the size of the cache dedicated to
textures, and the CD data transfer rate. That's all great
information if you're programming a new game for the system, or
modding your Saturn to illegally play Karaoke CDs, but for nearly
all of the Sega Visions readership, they could have listed the
specifications of a curling iron and no one would have been the
wiser. </font></p>

        <td valign="top">The advertisements in these magazines
        were no better. They were totally unrealistic as is the
        one to the right. I mean, what kid has wicker furniture
        in his bed room? Besides that, suppose you could actually
        find a beret that would fit a nine year old, would you
        let anyone you know go out of the house dressed like the
        Big Game Hunter over there? I don't know if it's the hole
        in the knee of his jeans or that semi-dangerous looking
        Nintendo Zapper he's holding in his one gloved hand, but
        something about this kids' outfit says &quot;Beat me up,
        mercilessly.&quot;<p>Sunsoft apparently felt differently
        and included this at the bottom of the advertisement.

<p>I had a point in mind when I started this but I've rapidly
gotten away from it. The point is/was I've spent countless hours
(years) reading about and playing games but almost no time
talking about them. I don't mean talking as in writing long and
boring articles and posting them on an <a
href="http://magnus.uong.com/">inane website</a>. I mean actually
speaking about video games with people I see everyday. Sure there
were the ever present Nintendo vs. Sega &quot;debates&quot; in
the lunchroom when I was in middle school and they usually ended
in fist fights or &quot;Yo momma&quot; jokes or even crusty
cremed potatoes in the shape of a scoop of icecream being flung
across the room. But as far as video games entering my normal day
to day conversation, it just doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Video games are a hobby much like golf, fishing, or building
those tiny ass boats inside bottles. People won't hesitate for an
instant to tell you, in great detail, about the big fish they
almost caught last weekend or the score of the baseball game they
watched, or how many rolls of pennies they stuffed down a
stipper's G-string but when I've just spent a weekend playing
video games and someone asks me at work what I did over the
weekend, my reply is almost always, &quot;Oh not much.&quot;
Wanna know why? Because I sound like a psychotic geek when I talk
about video games. </p>

<p>Try these suggestions or just say them out loud as you read
and you'll understand how ridiculous it sounds. The next time
someone asks you what you did last weekend, tell them, &quot;Well,
I managed to get my dark elf necromancer up to level 44 and buy
his new spells. I've got a really awesome pet skeleton now and
this other spell lets me turn into a skeleton. It's a lot of fun
standing around as a skeleton and it makes my mana come back
faster!&quot; Most people just back away with that look in their
eyes that says, &quot;He's gonna snap one of these days and I
hope I'm not around when he does.&quot; </p>

<p>Describe <a
href="http://score.sega.com/games/sc5/sc5_main.html">Space
Channel 5</a> to someone who doesn't play video games. &quot;Well
you play as Ulala. She's a news reporter from the future with
purple hair and a plastic orange skirt. You have to save the
hostages from the aliens by out dancing them. Left...up....left...CHU
CHU CHU hahahahahahah&quot; If the person you're talking to
doesn't say, &quot;Oooooooookay&quot; then I'd look out for men
in white coats.</p>

<p>Call a department store that sells video games. Store clerk's
comments in red. &quot;Do you sell Seaman?&quot; <font
color="#FF0000">&quot;Very funny. If you call here again, we'll
trace the number.&quot;</font> &quot;Not semen, SEA..........MAN,
it's a Dreamcast game!&quot; <font color="#FF0000">&quot;No, I
don't SEE MAN! I don't think you see either!&quot; </font><font
color="#000000">And, since Abbot and Costello are dead, I'll stop
there.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">My best internet tips: Use a mouse.
Click all the blue letters you see. Do your best and timing is
everything!</font></p>
