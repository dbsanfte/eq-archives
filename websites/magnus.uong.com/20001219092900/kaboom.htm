<p align="left">Before I begin, I must ask all reading this to
observe a moment of silence for one of the greatest games ever
made. Out of the hundreds and hundreds of video games I've played
in my life, I can count on one hand those that are on the same
level as Kaboom. This article took me three days to complete
because I started playing Kaboom in order to get screenshots and
spent 2 and a half days playing it. So, with that said, begin the
moment of silence now, and no cheating. I'll know.</p>

<p align="left">Ok, now that the necessary repects have been
paid, I'll move on. It was during the retelling of the <a
href="http://magnus.uong.com/briefhistory.htm">history of my life</a>
that I began to get all nostalgic. I dragged out the old Atari,
blew out the Kaboom cartridge, found my paddle controllers and
played until the wee hours of the morning. The game is still that
damn good.</p>

        <td valign="top"><p align="left">Kaboom is a simple thing.
        If you can sit upright for fifteen minutes and keep from
        drooling on yourself, you can play Kaboom. I bought the
        game at a garage sale for one dollar. It came with no
        instructions but I was able to figure it out.</p>
        <p align="left">The guy at the top is the villain. His
        sole purpose in this game is to move back and forth and
        drop bombs in short rounds. The hero (that's you) moves
        the wheel on the paddle controller back and forth and
        tries to catch the bombs on yellow tires. As you catch
        more bombs, this guy goes faster and drops more bombs per
        round. If you miss a bomb, you lose a tire. The game
        keeps going on like this until you lose all your tires or
        the end of time, whichever comes first.</p>

        Freddy Krueger looking guy is the only villain you ever
        see. Usually, his expression is an icy frown but when he
        eventually wears you down, he allows himself a smile for
        a job well done. The bastard. What motivates him? Does he
        hate the Activision logo at the bottom? Has he got
        something against yellow tires? Who cares? </p>

<p>These days, classic games mean easy money for game companies.
They can take an old idea, make it into a bad 3d game, market it
to kids who think an Atari 2600 is for playing 8 tracks and
whamo, instant cash. There have been dozens and dozens of remakes
of old classics. Games like Frogger, PacMan, and even Pong have
been given face lifts and sold to young kids looking for awesome
graphics and old kids looking to relive their first childhood.
And while I pray that Kaboom is never re-released as a STUNNING 3D
GRAPHICAL ADVENTURE!, I can't help but wonder what Kaboom would
be like if some of the major game companies today got their hands
on it. Below are some of my ideas about what they'd come up with.</p>
