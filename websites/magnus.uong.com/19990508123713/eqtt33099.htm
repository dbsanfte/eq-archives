<P>Sup and all that,</P>

<P>    For some reason, I can't connect tonight. Que sera sera. It gives me
a chance to type this up. The top ten things I like doing in EverQuest.</P>


<P>10. Watching woodelves take one step too many and get a quick trip to
the ground. Good thing elves stay away from alcohol.</P>

<P>9. Running around as a dwarf shouting, "De plane boss, de plane!"</P>

<P>8. Roleplaying my dEwD female Woodelf, BonaBich. "ever kwest sux..u cnat
wack lmrs!11"</P>

<P>7. Jumping on all the beds.</P>

<P>6. Watching a barbarian in his skirt running from 12 goblins. (I don't
know why I find it so funny watching people run from monsters in this
game.)</P>

<P>5. In a wierd sort of way, I like to watch the kewlioz fight over the
/ooc channel.</P>
<P>Fuzzybut says out of character: stupid fuking lag!111</P>
<P>Uradumas says out of character: shtu up EQ roks!!!1</P>
<P>Fuzzybut says out of character: u queer fag!11</P>
<P>Uradumas says out of character: ur mom</P>
<P>Fuzzybut says out of character: im pvp+ turn urs on an meet me out of
twon</P>

<P>It kind of reminds me of a kindergarten playground except these guys are
less mature than the 5 year olds.</P>

<P>4. Doing /who commands.</P>
<P>/who Stonecold all</P>
<P>/who Randalthor all</P>
<P>/who Seckzy all</P>
<P>/who Gandalf all</P>
<P>/who Merlin all</P>
<P>/who Soneesux all</P>

<P>3. That's a really nice load screen they picked isn't it?</P>

<P>2. Cheking the newsgroup and finding 1000 new posts in 4 hours. All
threads having one of the following topics.</P>

<P>Why EverQuest sucks.</P>
<P>Why EverQuest doesn't suck.</P>
<P>Why people who say EverQuest sucks suck.</P>
<P>Why people who say EverQuest doesn't suck suck.</P>
<P>Why people who say people who say EverQuest sucks suck suck even more. etc.</P>

<P>1. Standing outside of Mac's Kilts in barbarian land shouting, "IF IT'S
NOT SCOTTISH, IT'S CRAP!"</P>

<P>     I also like like calling barbarians 'barbies' but a top eleven list
doesn't have the same ring to it.</P>

<P>-Magnus</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Aspiring Sherman Shaman who is on a sacred quest to
jump on all the beds of Norrath</P>
