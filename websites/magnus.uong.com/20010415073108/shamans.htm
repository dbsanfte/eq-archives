<P>There's something special about playing a shaman. You aren't
terribly good at anything, but there are few areas that you can't at
least be decently effective in. They're the 'wild card' characters.
Shamans are among the few mages that can wear armor and fight when
needed. Shamans possess a few nice spells that can be used offensively
in combat. Shamans can heal, bind affinity, and buff up warriors with
dozens of spells. </P>
<P> Then, there's spirit of the wolf. This spell is also known as "Run
like Hell spell", "Spirit of the Cable Modem", and "Train maker". Oh how
I love and loathe this spell. I love it for its obvious benefits to
myself and to my friends. I loathe it because after I get half a dozen
messages in one evening: Dilweade tells you "hey dood can u wolf me?/
plz" I have to go anonymous. Then, there's the guys that stand at the
entrance of Blackburrow and ask for spirit of the wolf from anything
that walks by with a bear on his head and a stick in his hand.</P>
<P>So, it's become my habit to lie profusely. "No, I can't afford that
spell yet." "What's SoW? Some kind of pig?" "no mana dood gota run..."
"Go bug a druid, they can cast it too ya know." All of which usally
garner the response, "k thx neway".</P> 
<P>I consider myself to be an intelligent person. So I reasoned, huge
demand plus comparitively low supply equals a business opportunity. I
tried to take advantage of the situation. I found a crowded zone and
shouted, "Will wolf for food." (Trying to be humorous.) After being
mobbed by 7 level 1-3 characters offering me muffins, I re-shouted,
"Will wolf for money." Three people in 30 minutes were willing to pay
for the benefits. Four, I suppose, if you count the guy who wanted to
pay me for the Spirit of the Wolf spell, if and only if, I would throw
in free buffs, 3 waters, and 3 breads. I said, "Do you want fries with
that?" He said nothing for a long time, then ran off.</P>
<P>So, I can't sell it and don't feel like giving it away. (I sound
like some old washed up prositute.) What to do? I seriously believe I
will start a shaman support club. The Association of Sherman Shamans
(ASS) we shall be called. Members of ASS will be given ASS patches for
their armor and an official ASS hat. We will have ASS meetings and
discuss shaman concerns. We will give out bumper stickers that say: </P>

<P>"My child is an honor shaman at ASS elementary"</P>
<P>"HELL NO, WE WON'T WOLF!"</P>
<P>"Get off your ass and give to ASS"</P>
<P>"Shamans are people too"</P>
<P>"Have you hugged a shaman today?" </P>
<P>"I give to my local ASS" </P>
<P>"Shamans: The other white mage"</P>

<P>Wilt thous offer me any of thine support, uhm verily?</P>
