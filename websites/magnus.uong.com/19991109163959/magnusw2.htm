<P>Magnus looked out over the ocean at the large island looming before
him. He shivered not only from the chill in the air but also from the
anticipation of what was sure to be a great adventure.</P>
<P>He turned to his friend Exodus, who was sitting in the back of the
small boat and said, "How long has it been since you were last here?"
Exodus replied, "It was been almost a month now. I meant to bring you
here sooner. The dungeon Deceit is a great place to test your mettle in
combat." "Good. It has been a while since I have ventured into a dungeon
and I long for the thrill of fighting." said Magnus.</P>
<P>The boat neared the shore and the tillerman skillfully turned the
boat and brought it to rest beside the shore. Magnus hopped over to the
land. Exodus turned the the tillerman and said, "Take the ship back to
Ocllo. We will use our magic to return." Exodus jumped to the land and
the tillerman swung the boat back around facing open water and began his
trip back.</P>
<P>The two men began the walk to the entrance of the dungeon. On their
way, they passed a mage who was summoning a fire elemental. Magnus
stopped and watched. Thus far, he had only cast 7th circle magic. He
longed for the day when he would be the one calling forth creatures of
immense power. "Ah well," he thought, "that is an issue for another
day."</P>
<P>After a short time, they reached the mouth of the dungeon. It was a
gaping hole in the side of the mountain. Magnus and Exodus cast their
night sight spells and walked through the entrance.</P>
<P>Almost immediatly, they were confronted with a fight. Two giant
rats ran from the far corners of the room headed straight for them.
Exodus donned his shield and readied his mace for the attack. Magnus
began preparing an energy bolt spell. Two quick hits from Exodus' mace
and the first rat was dead. Magnus' spell flung the other rat back
across the room leaving it too hurt to move. He ran over to it and gave
it a hit with his axe.</P>
<P>The two joked about the difficulty of this first battle and then
ventured further into the labyrinth. Exodus told Magnus, "There is a
room just ahead that is often populated with Water Elementals." Magnus
knew that water elementals were no joking matter and prepared himself.
Exodus said, "I will attack and draw their fire, you keep me alive and
aid with your magic." Magnus nodded.</P>
<P>They reached a large door. Exodus said, "This is the place." He
pushed open the door. There was a large elemental just inside. Exodus
attacked. Magnus healed his friend and blasted the elemental with an
energy bolt. The creature screamed and vanished leaving behind a pile of
gold and a bag. Magnus said, "We will divide the earnings in a safer
location." "Agreed", Exodus said and scooped up the gold and bag and
placed them into his own pack.</P>
<P>They walked across the room and suddenly another elemental appeared
behind them. Exodus spun around and began smashing the creature. Magnus
aided with heals. The creature began showing signs of weakening and
Exodus asked Magnus to finish it off. Magnus chanted the words:Vas Flam
and watched the fire fly from his hand. This creature vanished as the
other one had done.</P> 
<P>Suddenly, from the corner of the room, a young archer ran out from
a dark corner and in one motion scooped up the gold and the bag laying
on the floor. Exodus ran after him but the archer was much faster and
left him behind.</P>
<P>Exodus said, "If he turns up again, I will kill him myself." Magnus
replied, "Relax, we came down here to battle monsters, not other
humans.  Besides, I'm sure he didn't get that much." Exodus agreed and
they continued their trip into the dungeon.</P> 
<P>After an hour or two and many battles, the two began the walk back
to the surface. They came across two men in a bitter argument. One of
the men was in a long black cloak the other was the archer that had
stolen from Exodus and Magnus. From the crowd that was gathering Magnus
learned that the man in the black cloak was named Logan and the archer
was Findog. The argument escalated to violence as Findog grabbed his
crossbow and fired at Logan. Logan turned and ducked into and narrow
passageway. Findog persued.</P> 
<P>Exodus said, "I bet Findog stole something from Logan. Let's help
him out." Magnus and Exodus ran through the narrow hallway that led into
a large room with an old table and chairs set up. There they found
Findog standing in the center of the room shouting, "Where are you
hiding? You coward! No one steals from me and lives!" Logan replied, the
echo of the room disguising his location, "I stole from you because you
took the gold from a monster that I had slain. The gold is rightfully
mine." Findog screamed, "You lie! You are a thief!" Magnus said, "You
are a thief too Findog. I have witnessed it. I believe Logan. Now cease
your attack now and leave." Findog turned and glared. He replied through 
gritted teeth, "I will not cease until I have my gold back."</P>
<P>A shadow moved in a corner and Findog spotted it. He took aim and
fired. Logan made a dash for the hallway as Magnus healed him.
Logan blurted as he ran by, "Thank you my friend, I shall not forget
your kindness."</P>
<P>Findog resumed his pursuit. Magnus said, "Exodus, slow Findog down." 
Exodus began to try to block the hallway with his body but the agile
archer easily evaded his attempts. Magnus casually pulled out his spell
book and opened it. He walked into the hallway and chanted the words: In
Sanct Ylem and a wall of stone a foot thick appeared at the end of the
hallway completely blocking it just after Logan slipped out.</P> 
<P>Findog, who was running at full speed did not even have time to
raise his arms before running face first into the magic wall. He fell to
the ground and shook his head. As he got up, blood was streaming from
his nose. He said to Magnus, "Old man, this was not your fight. This is
your last chance to back off or I will kill you." Magnus coldly replied,
"I do NOT accept threats from vermin such as yourself. Now I say to you,
leave this place now, or I you shall be the one to lose his life today."
 Findog laughed and said,"Empty threats old man! I've seen the extent of your 
magic power and you do not impress me sorcerer." Magnus replied, "The
'extent' of my power has been enough to knock you off your feet once. I
do hope that blood doesn't stain your lovely shirt."</P>
<P>The insult was too much for Findog, who cocked his crossbow and
fired at Magnus. Magnus returned fire with an Energy bolt that threw
Findog into the magical wall once again. Just as Magnus was going to
finsh him, a giant rat appeared and began biting at Magnus' leg. He knew
that his plate armor was enough to stop it but he could not maintain the
concentration to cast another Energy bolt.</P>  
<P>Findog took advantage of the situation and quickly healed himself.
He resumed fire until Magnus was the one needing healing. Luckily,
Exodus was there to aid his friend and healed Magnus. He quickly
dispatched the rat also. With no further distractions, Magnus fired two
quick energy bolts and watched the archer fall dead. Findog's spirit ran
away without a word. Exodus ran over to his body and said, "What shall
we do with his things?" "Take them. He should know what it means to be
stolen from." replied Magnus.</P>
<P>Exodus took all of Findog's possessions and said, "Well friend,
feel up to a few more fights?" Magnus said, "Let's go home, I've had my
fill of rats today."</P>

Findog's dialogue for story purposes.)</P>
