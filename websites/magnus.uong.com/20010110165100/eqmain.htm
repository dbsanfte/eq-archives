The game has been compared to crack by many people. It's a pretty
good comparison. While you're playing, you're perfectly content
and when you're not playing, all you think about is getting home
to play some more. But one day, you realize that it's Monday
morning, you've been playing all weekend without stopping and,
and you smell bad. Oh yeah, and get used to seeing the picture
below. It took me a long time to make it and I'm rather proud of
it.</p>
