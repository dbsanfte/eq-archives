            Youth Philanthropy Worldwide's programs help young people recognize 
            that they can make a difference. We provide a meaningful introduction 
            to important issues in international philanthropy and get young people 
            thinking about how they can make a difference by supporting local 
            leaders and community based initiatives in a spirit of mutual respect 
            and learning. </font></td>

              one group we were arguing about whether to give it money because 
              if the group got caught doing this illegal process [teaching girls 
              in Afghanistan], the teachers might be put to death and the money 
              would be taken, which would be risking our money. But we decided 
              that these people were rising their lives for girls to learn, so 
              we could risk the money."<BR>

            Workshops</a></strong> - Our first workshop explores women's rights 
            issues across the developing world. <br>
            The heart of the workshop is the grantmaking exercise. Working with 
            a hypothetical budget, participants play the role of grantmakers and 
            review proposals from real community-based organizations in the developing 
            world. The funding requests reflect the wide diversity of women's 
            rights concerns around the world: from a night school for domestic 
            workers in Mali to a street theatre group educating Pakistani women 
            about their rights. </font></td>
