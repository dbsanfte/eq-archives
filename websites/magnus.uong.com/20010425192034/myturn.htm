<P>A blue moongate appeared in front of the small house next to the
Ocllo bank. A tall, hairy man with a polar bear on his head stepped out
and quickly transformed into the short, hairy tank mage named Magnus.
Magnus dug around in his pack and found his house key. With a quick
motion, he unlocked, opened, and relocked his door. </P>
<P>He entered and shut it very fast via his last object macro and only
then did he take time to look around the place. No stealthers trying tp
get in today. Magnus walked over to his writing desk.</P>
<P>The desk was piled almost to the ceiling with papers both blank and
full. There were stories, top ten lists, and pictures. There were also
unfinished stories, and unused ideas. He chuckled as he read over
unnused ideas. There was a story about two kewl dood NPCs named Hyman
and Gaylord that never quite panned out. There was an unfinished story about an avatar to Britannia
named WetCondom. In which Magnus planned to have them meet Designer
Dragon in an anticlimactic scene in which Designer Dragon would exclaim,
"Patches? I ain't got no patches. I don't have to show you any steenkin'
patches!" All the stories would likely never be finished.</P>
<P>Magnus had made this trip before but this time was different. This
time was the last time. He'd grown tired of Britannia. It had been a
nice place to visit but he didn't want to spend the rest of his
existance there. He'd made many dear friends there and had many
adventures but it was time for him to move on. Now he felt compelled to
write one more thing as a way of creating closure to his time in this
world.</P>
<P>He leaned back in his chair and thought. He could copy sit com
writers and make the last episode one in which everyone has memories of
all the good times and bad times they've had. He could use really cheesy
special effects and not have to come up with any new ideas or jokes! He
could retell the Destard fishing trip. People would laugh just as much
when he retold of Baxter Green teaching the Skara Brae rangers about
Q-tip bombs as they had the first time. Then there were all the times he and Exodus would run
around Vesper yelling, "PKS IN MAGINCIA!" or run around the Britain bank
naked screaming, "LORD BRITISH STOLE OUR CLOTHES!" "Nah, that's been
done to death," he thought. </P>
<P>Maybe he could write a 'final episode' in which everyone has their
problems solved. Magnus would finally get to wear his black plate mail
and meditate. Icelady would get her own personal shard, pk switch, and
newsgroup where everyone would agree with her. The Skara Brae rangers
would win their war and kewlioz would be banished forever. Cyclone would
get his coconuts. Venture would finally beat that chicken in chess.
Again Magnus killed the idea. Rec.games.computer.ultima.online.icelady
just doesn't have the same ring to it.</P>
<P>Then, he got a an idea. He quickly began writing on a fresh sheet
of paper. When he was finished, he placed it on the table and set to
work. He gathered up everything of value and handed it through his
window to the banker. (He'd always loved that feature of his Ocllo bank
house.) For the rest of the boxes, he carefully trapped them with
explosive potions. "Whomever loots this fallen house is going to have to
go through a lot of trouble for these three empty bottles", he mused.</P>
<P>With the house empty, save for the trapped chests, he picked up
the note and stepped outside. He stepped over to the bulletin board at
the bank where "PhunkMasta hath killed too many" was prominently
displayed. Magnus pinned the note up and with a last long look around,
summoned a moongate and left Britannia for the last time. </P>
<P>"Dear friends, My time in Britannia has come to an end. There are
so many people I'd like to thank for making my time in Britannia so much
fun. Raph, I didn't always agree with your ideas and implementations but
you did a hell of a good job keeping things fun. Dundee, thanks for
making me king =). Janey, thanks for breathing new life back into the
game and making Monroe and Baxter the most cared about NPCs of all time.
Ingothead, thanks for always having a kind word for me. Gresh, thanks
for all the hard work and time you put into making sure other people
have a good time. My best friend Exodus, thanks for sticking with me
through it all. To Venture, thanks for opening me up to new ideas about
the game. To all the kewlioz, thanks for giving me plenty of comic
material. To Driakos, thanks for being the funniest person in this
newsgroup. To bizbee and Alex Mars, thanks for taking out the trash and
not flaming me. To all the rest, thank you for laughing, sympathizing,
agreeing, debating, and reading for the past year and a half. It's been
a really fun time for me.</P>
