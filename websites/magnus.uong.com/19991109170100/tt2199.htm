<P>Hail travellers,</P>
<P><Semi-roleplayin'></P>
<P>    Upon last eve, mine friend Exodus and I did partake in training
excercises to prepare ourselves for coming battles. When once he did
have me at his mercy, he did recite a line from a past hero that did
bring a smile to mine face and provoked me to thoughts of mirth and
merriment. Here before you are the results thoughts.
</Semi-roleplayin'></P>
<P>     Translation: Exodus and I were sparring and he got me down to 10
hit points. He recited a line from a movie in UO style and inspired this
top ten list. Here are the top ten lines from action move heroes done in
UO style. (The line Exodus came up with is number one.)</P>

<P>10. Wesley Snipes: "Ever play roulette? Always bet on true black."
That's not too good but, get the idea now?</P>

<P>9. Old Arnold Schwarzeneggar: "At Arnold's gym, ve vill take your girlie
man flabby arms and turn them into bulging mounds of muscle. Vith our
arms lore macro gym, you'll be at 100 strength in no time. Ve vill pump
YOU up."</P>

<P>8. Arnold (Terminator): "Kal Ort Por ~~~~~~~~~~~~ I'll be back."</P>

<P>7. Bruce Willis: "Vas Corp Por mother fucker!"</P>

<P>6. Keanu Reaves: "Pop quiz, lamer. You're a PK and there's an anti who's a GM archer with
100 dex and a heavy crossbow of power pointed at your head. What do you
do?"</P>

<P>5. Danny Glover: "My dex is too low for this shit!"</P>

<P>4. Christopher Lambert: "There can be only one secure chest in this
house."  (Wooooo! That was bad!)</P>

<P>3. John Wayne: "I'm not gonna PK ya mister. Like hell I'm not!" (I can't
help it, I love The Duke.)</P>

<P>2. James Earl Jones: (As Darth Vader) "luuuke im ur father...join teh
dark side or the emporer wil maek me pk u!!11"</P>

<P>1. This was Exodus' doing. He had me down very low on life and said the
following. </P>
<P>Clint Eastwood: "I know what you're thinking. Did he fire 4 energy bolts
or 5? To tell you the truth in all this excitement, I've lost track myself. 
Do I have mana left for one more shot? But being that I'm a Grandmaster Tank Mage, 
and fire the most powerful energy bolts possible, I guess that means you have to 
ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, DO YA PUNK?"</P>

<P>     I literally almost fell out of my chair laughing when he did this.
It was sooooo funny.</P>

<P>-Magnus (Ocllo,Catskills)</P>
<P>Semi-roleplayin' Grandmaster Tank Mage who felt lucky and afterwards
said, "OoOOoO OOOooOOoO"</P>
