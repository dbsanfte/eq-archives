<h1 align="center">Magnus' Guide to Roleplaying</h1>

<p>This guide is meant as a companion guide to Mushashi's Guide
to Ultima Online writing. (found at <a
href="http://mu.ranter.net">Musashi's Page </a>) Its intent is to
help the masses be more like, or at least understand the typical
roleplayer in Ultima Online. The latter may be nigh impossible
but we're being optimistic today.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF40">-What is roleplaying?</font></p>

<p>That's a question that has as many answers as Richard Garriot
has sports cars. Generally, roleplaying is pretending to be
something you're not. Whether you decide to play an intellengent,
witty, brave, or a well respected character, the choice is always
up to you. </p>

<p><font color="#00FF40">-Why roleplay?</font></p>

<p>Roleplaying adds a whole new element of the game that you may
never knew existed before! When you roleplay, you'll suddenly
find your mind turning and thinking as you try to come up with
rational &quot;RP explanations&quot; for ICQ (telepathy), mules (weakminded
brothers and sisters in your care), and your secret PK character
(evil twin). It's a whole new experience!</p>

<p><font color="#00FF40">-How do I get started?</font></p>

<p>The most important thing that you need is a name. There are
several options in this case. Perhaps the novice roleplayer will
want to start simply. You can take a character from a well known
piece of fiction and roleplay as the character. For example, you
decide to name your character Stone Cold. You make wrestling his
primary skill and say &quot;Hell yeah!&quot; (Capitalization and
punctuation not required.) a lot. This is all there is to
roleplaying! </p>

<p>A more advanced option is to make up your own name. This
usually involves throwing letters together in a way that looks
medieval or magical. A good tactic is to use a lot of AE and AEI
combinations in your name. Examples: Kaeriae, Ryaeinaie,
Fraeittraein, etc.</p>

<p>Another common practice is to overuse apostrophe marks. Use
them whereever and whenever. They will give your name a much more
unique look and let everyone around you know that YOU are a true
roleplayer.</p>

<p>If you're really creative, you might decide to give your
character a last name. This is really only for veteran
roleplayers as last names are generally a sign of a hard core
rper. (Unless of course, the last name you choose is Knocka,
Pimpstah, or Dawg.) </p>

<p>Should you choose to use a last name, the good news is, they
are remarkably easy to make. Use the following table to make your
name. Just pick a prefix from the first list and combine it with
a suffix from the second list and voila, you have a last name fit
for the best of the RPers.</p>

<p>This list will get you started. However, care must be taken
when using this list. For instance, the name 'Brokenwind' is
possible from the combinations in this table. I can not stress
enough that humor has no place in roleplaying! </p>

<p><font color="#00FF40">-Ok, I have a name, now what?</font></p>

<p>You should probably work on a background story now. Mushashi
has covered the background story in his writing guide but if your
not the writing type, here are a few simple rules to remember
about your character's background.</p>

<p>-You are an orphan. (Everyone is.)</p>

<p>-You must have a hometown. It doesn't matter if your character
lives in a house blocking the entrance to Destard, pick a town
that you like and call that your hometown. </p>

<p>-You have a feeling that there is something special* about
yourself.</p>

<p>*Special meaning spoken of in prophecy, savior of the world,
etc.</p>

<p>-When in doubt, resort to being the strong silent type.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF40">-Ok, got the background, what do I do
when I play?</font></p>

<p>Roleplaying requires that you learn to use bad olde english.
This isn't as hard as it sounds if you just follow a few rules.
Use 'thee' and 'thou' a lot unless you're pretending that you're
Scottish or Irish and then you can just use 'ye'. Put a 'th' or 'eth'
on the end or every verb and that's all there is to it. When you
get practice, you can start working in words like 'forsooth', 'partake',
and 'verily'. The best part is, you don't even have to use them
correctly in the context of a sentence! Just use them and you'll
look like you know what you're talking about!</p>

<p>Now that you're speaking like a native, there are a few things
you must do playwise. First of all, you must give up your 'vendor
buy the bank guards' macro. You may, however, macro each command
to a seperate key in a badly composed sentence. (Remember the
rules from above.)</p>

<p>Emote! Emote! Emote! This is a subtlety that passes so many
players by. Other players want to see *stares with a piercing
stare that sends shivers up your spine*, or *stands quietly with
hands in pockets*, or even *laughs in a most evil way*. If you do
nothing more than set up a macro that emotes *clears throat* and
*nods in agreement*, you'll earn the respect of many a player!
Again, no humorous emotings allowed. Examples of emotings to
avoid: *Relieves himself on a nearby tree*, *Fiddles with nipple
rings*, *Hums Nirvana songs*, *Does the Macarena*, and *Lights a
fart*.</p>

<p>You may not run, unless you are sure that no one else can see
you! You may not macro either unless no one can see you. </p>

<p><font color="#00FF40">-This is all great, can I roleplay an
evil person?</font></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF40">-Aw, come on, please.</font></p>

<p>no u lameass kewl dood, go play quake</p>

<p><font color="#00FF40">-What do I do once I become an
established roleplayer?</font></p>

<p>You'll find roleplaying fantastically useful should you write
of your adventures in Ultima Online. I've found that it's most
handy when writing the first paragraph on an essay on creating
the perfect carpenter mule on the UO Stratics web page. You'll
soon find many more uses for your new skill!</p>
