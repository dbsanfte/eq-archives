<P>It seems that this picture of my EverQuest character inspired one of the viewers of my page to draw a picture of my character and send it to me. I have to say, this guy is a fantastic artist and is very good at what he does. I am honored to have had my picture drawn by him. To look at this work of art, click <A HREF="http://magnus.uong.com/rayvie1.jpg">here.</a> The artist is known only as Reilly. To see more of his video game art, follow <A HREF="http://www.pacificnet.net/~yobby"> this link.</A>

<P>I have canceled my EverQuest account due to lack of interest in the game. I'll leave the section up though as an archive for people who might come to this page looking for EverQuest stuff.</P></CENTER>
