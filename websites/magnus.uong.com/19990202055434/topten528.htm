<P>Please think about that for a minute. Do we really want Ultima On-Line
players 'teaching' a fledging form of a real artificial intelligence?
It wouldn;t be long before you started noticing the NPCs saying different things. 
I happen to have 10!!!</P>

more in 15 minutes..in the mean time go get me some black platemail"</P>

<P>2. NPC Fur Traders - "heh i upped the price on hides to 15 a piece - u
