<P>Yo!,</P>
<P>Well, I am now a week and a half away from finals and all my professors
are trying to cram in as much as they can. Needless to say, I've been
spending a lot of time around the university campus not playing Ultima
and not posting to R.C.G.U.O. I am actually having withdrawal symptoms.
I keep confusing reality with my on-line gaming time. It just so happens
I have a list of the top ten signs that you may have been away from
Ultima On-Line too long. (These will have a college "flavor" to them.)</P>

<P>10. You try to teleport across busy streets. </P>
<P>I was standing on a corner saying, "Rel Por" over and over. One of my
friends saw me and told me I was going crazy. I asked, "How do YOU plan
on crossing the street?" He said he was going to walk. This particular
street, one has only about a 30% chance of crossing with all of one's
body parts or life in tact. I say who's the crazy one here?</P>

<P>9. I had three classes and a lab scheduled for one day, so I had to
carry a lot of books to school. My friends were puzzled when I took off
my shoes and left them on a corner. I told them that with the shoes I
was overweight and too fatigued to move. Some people just don't get it.</P>

<P>8. They told me to go and get my shoes and come on. Reluctantly, I put
them back on and told them I was just going to have to do it the hard
way. I threw my backpack on the ground and walked in front of it. Then,
I picked it up, turned around and threw it down again. I walked in front
of it again and repeated the process. My friends walked slowly behind me
not saying anything. Some people just don't get it.</P>

<P>7. After the previous incident, I decided my strength was too low. I
looked around for a provisioner shop and could not find one anywhere. I
asked a man working at a restaurant, "Tyrone, where is an axe?" He told
me to try a hardware store. I said, "Tyrone, where is the hardware
store?" He said, "*&%$ I don't know, are going to order or not?" I left
and located a hardware store and bought an axe. Then I went around the
campus and practiced my lumberjacking. I think I should have found a
real lumberjack and bought some training because I wasn't very good at
it. After trying 15 or 20 whacks, I was surprised when the trees fell. Not
as surprised though as the owners of the cars that the trees fell on. I
tried to explain that it must be a bug and they should call a GM but
they seemed more willing to shout profanity at me. I ran.</P>

<P>6. Since lumberjacking was a bust and I still needed more strength, I
went back to the hardware store and bought a shovel and a pickaxe. I
then practiced mining in front of the administrative office. After about
three hours, I had found no ore and had dug all the grass out of the
front lawn of the building and decided to try the back. As I was walking
around, I met the head of the groundsman staff. As he rounded the
front corner of the building, he made a noise. I can't even imitate it
in real life so I won't even attempt in a text medium. I ran again.</P>

<P>5. Feeling hungry, I looked in my backpack only to discover I had no
gold on me. I went to the bank and got the neccessary funds. I tried to
leave my axe, shovel and pickaxe at the bank but they insisted that I
take them. I didn't need them anymore so I walked out to my car and
threw them in the back. On my way home, I saw a dead squirrel in the
road and slammed on the brakes. I popped my trunk and got the shovel and
axes out. I layed them carefully on the squirrel body and drove away.
People stared at me the whole time. I tried to explain that when the body decayed, the other items would too.
They kept staring. Some people just don't get it.</P>

<P>4. I gave one of my friends a ride home. He stepped out of my car and
said, "Thanks". I said, "NP". He stopped and looked at me. "What?" I
said, "NP as in No Problem. I was too tired to say the whole thing." He
hasn't asked to ride with me again since.</P>

<P>3. I went to my Psychology professor and asked if it could be arranged
for me to get an automatic 'A' in the course. She said, "Absolutely
not!" She was however curious as to why I had such a strange request. I
tried as best I could to explain to her that psychology wasn't all that
important to my chosen profession, electrical engineer. I further
explained that every time I studied for my pychology exams, useful
skills, like calculus and physics, kept dropping. I told her that it
takes way to long for psychology skills to atrophy and thought I might
just avoid getting them in the first place. She made me volunteer to
undergo therapy at the end of this quarter.</P>

<P>2. As most college students do, I found myself low on gold. I decided I
would just quit eating to save resources. It's been a 6 days now and I
haven't eaten a thing. I've saved lots of money, but I feel weak and
disoriented all the time. I must have been poisoned by something. I've
got to be on the lookout for an orange potion. It doesn't really matter
though. If I die, the campus is surrounded by healers (hospitals). I can
just go get ressurected there.</P>

<P>1. I was sitting in class and looking through my backpack when I
realized my weapon was missing. I became very troubled and worried. It
was a long way home. One of the teaching assistants noticed my troubled
look and asked if there was a problem. I told her that I couldn't find
my weapon. She looked surprised and said, "You shouldn't bring weapons
in the building anyway." I said, "Oh, it wasn't really dangerous, just a
dagger. I need it in case I get ambushed by a snake or a cat on the way
home. Also, if I see a dog or bird corpse on the way home, I can't skin
it or get the ribs." She called the university police and had me taken
to jail.</P>


<P>Chalk up another one for Magnus. I think I'm getting close to 15 top ten
lists. Whew! I better get busy on my physics. The professor discussed
the different types of waves in an "ass"-quake today and I can't wait to
see the pictures that the book has.</P>
