<P>Sup thees and thous and thises and thats,</P>

<P>     I'm now knee deep in finals week again and finally got a nice
little day and a half break. I'd had the idea for this list in my head
for awhile (Thanks Puck.) but I got stuck in a boring lecture Monday and
suddenly all sorts of ideas for it came to me.</P>
<P>     The subject: Ultima Online becomes University Online. Here's a an
update letter from the design team.</P>
<P>________________________________________________________________________</P>
<P>Dear students and alumni,</P>

<P>     We are pleased now to inform you of the new college patch we're
working on. Ultima Online will soon be known as University Online. We're
working very hard to ensure that the transition goes as smoothly as
possible. Among other things, players will soon be required to attend
classes to raise skills. The following are the top ten major changes to
the game of Ultima Online.</P>

<P>10. Backpacks will become visible on the backs of characters in the over world at all times. They
will get heavier the farther you walk. You will be able to set them down
but should your pack get lost or stolen, a new one will cost you 1000
gold plus the cost of new books. (See pricing of books farther down.)
What's more, your skills will not increase while you don't have a back
pack.</P>

<P>9. Pricing changes</P>
<P>     The most notable of the changes are the price differences you will
see in books. Books are going to be more expensive than houses. They
will be lootable and stealable. Expect to see clothing and food prices
shoot up as well. </P>
<P>     We expect all players to very poor after one quarter of the new
changes. Those who aren't will be taxed heavily into submission.</P>

<P>8. Animal taming is going away. Why? All animals on a college campus are
tame. (I really don't understand why this is. I've been sitting at a
table outside and had birds land on it. Squirrels don't run when you
walk past them. Can anyone explain it?)</P>

<P>7. Skill changes</P>
<P>     We're leaving in most of the old skills. We're just changing how
they work. Here are some preliminary changes.</P>

<P>Cooking: Players will learn exciting new combinations of bread, ham,
cheese, ramen noodles, peanut butter and jelly. The possibilities are great. (Players
with high statistics skills can tell exactly how many combinations)
You'll never get bored.</P> 

<P>Scribing: This skill will become note taking. To use, target the board
with the notes and then your notebook. If successful, you will take the
notes and be able to use your study skill on them later. If not
successful you will fall asleep and snore.</P>

<P>Stealth: Will be used for getting out of boring classes unnoticed.</P>

<P>Snooping: This allows a player to see what answers the person next to
them obtained.</P>

<P>Magery: Magic will allow the player a *small* chance to pass a test
without studying or coming to class. At zero skill, your chance of
sucess is zero. A grandmaster can pass as much as 50% of the time. </P>

<P>Evaluating Intelligence: Allows the player to guess how stupid their
professor is to 'student tricks'. Student tricks include using larger
fonts for long papers, wider margins for long papers, etc.</P>

<P>BSing: This is extremely useful for essay tests. A player using this
skill will be able to pass an essay test of which he knows nothing about
the subject. The success is based of your evaluating intelligence skill.
The quality is based on your BSing skill.</P>

<P>6. Ugly sculptures will be placed around Britannia. These are works of
ART. Any disrespectul remarks about them will result in the offender
being branded a cretin or Neanderthal. </P>

<P>5. All the poor college students will be forced to buy tired old horses
that don't always get you to class. They will take twice as much food as
a new horse and go twice as slow. Expect exhaust leaks. (Provided the
flatulation jokes don't get to be too much.) Students must park their
horses in a seperate lot from the intructors' lot. However, the
instructors' lots are always right beside the classroom buildings and 
students will have to walk by the instructors' brand new nitemares. Once
in class, the intructors will tell the students that the college years
are the best years of their lives and then go on to complain about
having no money. (Been wanting to get that one off my chest for awhile.
=p)</P>

<P>4. NPC changes</P>
<P>      Most NPCs will soon become professors of various types. They will
form new guilds called departments. The new departments are as follows.</P>

<P>English dept. - Most NPCs in this guild will have a superiority complex.
They will think because they have big beards and wire rim glasses and
know all the ins and outs of grammar that they are philosophers of some
sort. They give extremely boring lectures about such topics as 'proper
verb usage', 'the difference between lie and lay', and the infamous
'didn't you people learn anything in high school?' lecture.</P>

<P>Technology dept. - These NPCs are easily distinguished by the pale white
shirts and polyester pants they wear. Most will have pocket protectors
and thick plastic frame glasses. When entering a conversation, they will
insist on discussing their field of expertise no matter what the
conversation is. In class, they will try and persaude you to spend your
Friday evenings helping them code new operating systems.</P>

<P>Math and physics dept. - This is an evil NPC guild. NPCs from this group
will attack on sight with tests and quizzes of GPA vanquishing. Also
among their arsenal of weaponry are the 'differential equations', the
mighty 'triple integral of power (and work 0ccasionally)', and the
terrifying weapon of destruction known only as 'quantum mechanics'.</P>

<P>3. There will be 'rich kid' NPCs in the classes as well. They will ride
nitemares like the instructors. Their entire dialogue will be complaints
. While you're struggling with a job and trying to keep your GPA up to
keep your scholarship, they will gripe about how they don't have enough
time to fit in two different intramural sports, how they're having a bad
hair day, how much they hate the color of the brand new horse their
daddy bought them, and how they can't stand taking English 101 for the
7th time. We were considering letting players play them but real people
aren't really like that, are they? (Heh, there's something else off my
chest. I'm feeling much better now.)  </P>

<P>2. The skill system will work a little differently soon. The new steps
are freshman, sophmore, junior, and senior.</P>

<P>Freshman: Has shown interest in the school and knows how to get to the
campus. That's about it.</P>

<P>Sophmore: Has made it through the first year and is beginning to learn
the subtleties of all night studying and coffee chugging.</P>

<P>Junior: Has survived two years and is a master of most of the student
techniques. A few things like 'instructor butt kissing' have not quite
been learned yet but they are soon to come. </P>

<P>Senior: Has made it through three years and talks of nothing but
'getting out'. They know practically all of the student tricks,
including the aforementioned 'butt kissing'. </P>

<P>Grad Student: Dorky guys they use to teach the classes that none of the
regular staff wants.</P>

<P>1. We've saved the most special NPC intructor for last! This
instructor's title is simply, "from the sixties". They have it in their
head that they were part of some kind of drug culture because they once
sniffed some glue. They love telling students how much better college
students were in the sixties. Sometimes, they wear tie dyed t-shirts
with love beads. They constantly harp on the virtues of using chemical
means to expand one's mind.</P>


<P>     We know you're looking forward to these changes as much as we are.
Hey, it's the best years of your life!</P>
