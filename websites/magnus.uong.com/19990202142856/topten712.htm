<P>Alas! It has been too long.<\P>

<P>My two week sabbaticle from UO is over and I'm back to playing
regularly. I discovered that Ultima On-line is kinda like an addiction.
When you try and quit for awhile, you start thinking about it a lot.
Here's the top ten signs that told me maybe UO has messed with my mind.</P>

<P>10. I described the plot of "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's
Court" as the story of a man that falls asleep under a tree, wakes up in
Britannia and convinces the people he meets there that he is a GM by
predicting the daily server crash.(Yes, lame, but I'm trying to start
slow.)<p>

<P>9. I got more than a few strange looks when I'd walk into a store and
yell, "VENDOR BUY THE BANK GUARDS!"</P>

<P>8. I actually bought Quake 2. If you think it's difficult to roleplay in
Ultima On-Line, give it a try in Quake. Quakers don't like roleplaying.
(even semi-roleplayin')</P>
<P>*Magnus is walking though some place that looks like the Borg ship*</P>
<P>*Magnus meets Masta Blasta*</P>
<P>Magnus: Hello good sir! I am a visitor to this world and I seem to be
lost on this "ship" of sorts. Could you direct me to the nearest exit?</P>
<P>Masta Blasta: no</P>
<P>*Magnus eats Masta Blasta's rocket*</P>
<P>Magnus: The nearest bathroom would do just as nicely.</P>
<P>Masta Blasta: WTF R U talking about?</P>
<P>*Magnus sees the pretty lights of Masta Blasta's BFG*</P>
<P>Magnus: You speak strangely and attack without provocation. Are you
under the influence of drugs?</P>
<P>Masta Blasta: die *&^%er!!!!</P>
<P>*Magnus didn't see Masta Blasta's grenade*</P>
<P>Magnus: But sir, I have no quarrel with you. I only wish to find a way
out.</P>
<P>*Magnus is vaporized, paralyzed, liquified, pastuerized, polarized,
neutralized, slapped on the thighs,...*</P>
<P>Masta Blasta: hehehehehe u looz3r  (An oft heard phrase when playing
Quake, as opposed to "Corp Por" in UO.)</P>

<P>7. I thought Master Mage\Grandmaster Warrior would be good things to put
on my resume.  </P>

<P>6. I woke up one night with some logs and a saw next to my bed. It seems
I had been macroing carpentry in my sleep.</P>

<P>5. I caught myself telling stories about the good ol' days of UO when..</P>
<P>-lumberjacks could chop any tree they could see (Go Go Gadget Arms?)</P>
<P>-I've already stated that I don't like archery very much, so remember </P>
<P>when it took 50 arrows to kill a dog, if you managed to find a bird your
reward was 6-9 feathers, and a grandmaster archer was considered a waste
of a character. (My how things change.)</P>
<P>-THERE IS NO SERVER SIDE LAG!!!</P>
<P>-Let's not forget the reign of tailors, when skull caps were as valuable
as crack cocaine.</P>

<P>4. The masking tape I put on my monitor to cover up the Ultima On-Line
Shortcut Icon was getting really annoying.</P>

<P>3. I learned that contrary to what Ultima On-Line would have you
believe, cats and dogs, when skinned, do not produce the same size ribs. 
Don't ask.</P>

<P>2. I was standing on a street corner complaining about not being able to
find reagents and a guy told me he had some. He sold me a little bag
with some greenish gold stuff in it. Maybe it's ground up nightshade. </P>

<P>1. I went to the mall to buy some new pants and a shirt. After my
purchase was made, I stripped down to my underwear in the middle of the
store, and then put the new ones on. I walked over the to cashier who
seemed quite shocked. I asked her if she wanted to buy my old clothes.</P>
<P>Cashier: Hell no! Why would I want to buy your clothes? What are you on?</P>
<P>Magnus: You are a tailor, you can resell them.</P>
<P>Cashier: I don't care if you think you're God's gift to women, I'm not
buying them!</P>
<P>Magnus: OK, fine I'll give them to you.</P>
<P>Cashier: Thou art giving me cloth? I hear the exit may be found nearby!
Perhaps none have looked to the north. NOW GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE!  </P>

<P>Hmm, another one down. I think I need to macro my top ten skill a
little. Methinks I'm losing my touch. Thanks for readin', anyway. See
you next time. </P>

<P>Semi-roleplayin' Master Tank Mage who wonders why ground up nightshade
is so expensive</P>
