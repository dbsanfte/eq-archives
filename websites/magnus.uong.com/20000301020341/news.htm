<p><font size="3">Wow, two updates in two days. What's the world
coming to? Not really an update today in the strictest sense of
the word I suppose. Cyclone sent me another of his brilliant
EverQuest series paintings to display in the </font><a
href="http://magnus.uong.com/submissions.htm"><font size="3">Submissions
section</font></a><font size="3">. It lies there now.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The new WetCondom story has been
posted. It is titled </font><a
href="http://magnus.uong.com/aminerprob.htm"><font size="3">A
Miner Problem</font></a><font size="3">.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Two new </font><a
href="http://magnus.uong.com/submissions.htm"><font size="3">submissions</font></a><font
size="3"> have been added. One is from me and it's a drawing of
your hero and mine, the loveable and huggable WetCondom. (Action
figures coming soon!) The other is from Lord Polish. It's a
moving portrayal of a boy and his handgun.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">I put a link to the </font><a
href="http://magnus.uong.com/videogames.htm"><font size="3">Video
Games</font></a><font size="3"> section on the main page. Duh,
right? There's a Gran Turismo 2 advertisement there as well. I'm
planning on having the next WetCondom story by this weekend.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">A new cable modem sits a top my
desk. I've had it a week now and already don't see how I ever did
without it. I also have my TV card working again as evidenced by
the lovely shot of PaRappa you see above. With this new card, I'm
gonna try to get the video games section going soon.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">With the new cable modem comes new
ideas. I'm gonna try a </font><a
href="http://magnus.uong.com/submissions.htm"><font size="3">submissions
page</font></a><font size="3"> for folks to send in their
drawings or doctored screenshots. With the new modem, it won't
take me 6 days to check my email.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">There's a web site that I recently
visited that I've just gotta pass along. It's </font><a
href="http://www.seanbaby.com"><font size="3">Seanbaby.com</font></a><font
size="3"> and it's quite possibly the funniest web site in
existence. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">I wasn't doing anything too important other
than procrastinating over some homework so I changed the look of
the main page. Cool, eh?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">After a month of computer crashes, boot sector
viruses, the loss of an 8 gig hard drive, the loss of three years
worth of downloaded files, 60 hour work weeks, and more email
saying, &quot;dood when is teh next wetcondom story coming?//&quot;
than I care to remember, I have finally updated my crappy web
page with a WetCondom story. Does everyone like the direction the
story's going?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Since my computer's been going down more often
than a White House intern lately, I've gotten back into my
Playstation, N64, and Dreamcast games big time. Lunar: Silver
Star Story Complete and Final Fantasy Anthology have taken the
most of what free time I've had over the past few weeks. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Also, I've got a few ideas for the console
section, such as best and worst games of the 90s, a rant on game
magazines, a rant on game FAQs written by 14 year olds and a
couple of other things. I really plan on trying to inject some
humor into all of it. Is the console section worth keeping? I
really want to know how many people that come to this site play
video games regularly and would even understand video game humor.
(Just imagine reading this site if you'd never played Ultima
Online or EverQuest.) Take a second and let me know. </font><a
