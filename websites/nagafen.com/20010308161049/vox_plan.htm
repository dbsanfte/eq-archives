          <p><b><u><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Setup</font></u></b></p>
          <ol>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The meeting place will be at the
              King Camp spot marked on the <a href="permmap.htm" target="_self">Vox
              Map.</a></font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">During the formation of parties we
              will be clearing the King Camp spot as well as the Ice Giant
              Diplomat, and the two giants that spawn behind him.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once groups are formed, a warrior
              buffed with high magic resistance, and Spirit of The Wolf (SOW),
              will begin pulling all of the giants, Icy terrors, etc. between
              the King Camp and Vox's Lair. We will pull through two cycles of
              spawns to spread out the respawn rate.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once the giant respawn rate is
              under control, a Monk with SOW and magic resistance buffs and a
              warrior with SOW and magic resistance buffs will move up to the
              Monk FD spot (see <a href="http://www.everquester.com/Tactics/voxmap.htm" target="_self">Vox
              Map</a>).</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Warrior should back up a few
              paces from the Monk FD Spot in the direction of the King Camp and
              wait there.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The Monk will proceed to Nagafen's
              lair, open the rock/door, and step inside. This should Agro all of
              the mobs within. This will usually &quot;agro&quot; Lady Vox as
              well.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The monk will then race down to the
              ramp to the Monk FD spot and feign death.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The warrior will wait until Vox is
              not in sight (if she was pulled), then move up to where the monk
              is feigned dead. He will allow whatever mobs are present
              (Hopefully the Priest of Nagafen, but not always) to
              &quot;agro&quot; on him, then pull them to the King Camp Spot.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The parties waiting at the King
              Camp Spot will kill whatever mobs were pulled. During this battle
              the monk should remain Feigned Dead.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">All party members in the Monk's
              group and the Warrior's group should camp out. The monk should
              camp using the &quot;/quit&quot; command. The reason for this is
              that it is highly likely that Vox will be agro on the Monk and/or
              Warrior. And person who casts healing, buffs, etc, on the warrior
              on monk will inherit this agro. If the parties do not camp out, it
              is likely that Vox will appear at the diplomat doors (or if she
              has somehow taken damage) begin summoning party members to her
              lair.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Steps 4-10 should be repeated until
              all of the mobs in Vox's lair have been pulled and killed. It is
              necessary to do these as quickly as possible.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">All of the parties will proceed to
              the Staging Spot (see <a href="http://www.everquester.com/Tactics/voxmap.htm" target="_self">Vox
              Map</a>). They will have 5 minutes to buff before the charge on
              Vox.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">After all parties are prepared, the
              person staging the Vox raid should begin a 30 second countdown to
              charging Vox.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Groups 1, 2, the Pets Group, and
              the Nuke Group should charge the lair.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">20 seconds later Groups 3, 4, and
              any remaining groups (besides CR Group) should charge the lair.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Vox must die on this initial
              charge. Unlike Nagafen, the assault cannot be done in waves. This
              is due to the fact that Vox heals herself much more quickly than
              Nagafen. It is also due to the fact that corpse recovery, while
              Vox is injured, is almost impossible.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once Vox is dead, the group leader
              of the killing group should loot the corpse. Once the Vox corpse
              is looted, all parties must immediately retreat to the the King
              Camp Spot to avoid respawn. There will not be time for mana
              recovery or resurrections within Vox's Lair. Corpses of slain
              comrades must be dragged back to the King Camp Spot for
              resurrection.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Loot will be announced and
              distributed per the <a href="voxlootlist.htm" target="_self">Loot
              List.</a></font></li>
          </ol>
          <p><b><u><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Corpse Recovery</font></u></b></p>
          <ol>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the event of a failed raid,
              corpse recovery must wait until Vox has regained 95% of her
              health.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once Vox has regained this health
              she will begin running willy-nilly between her lair and the
              diplomat doors (just before the King Camp Spot). While Vox it
              going nutty, the CR group should make dashes into her lair to
              retrieve and drag corpses out.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If there are any monks, necro's
              etc. that Vox is still aggressive on, they should feign death and
              remain so throughout the recovery. If a bard is in their group,
              they should disband to avoid Vox going Agro on the bard (due to
              Bardsong).</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The remainder of the Non-CR groups
              should camp out and log back in, to reset the dragon's agro.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once all corpses are recovered and
              resurrected, the raid can begin anew.</font></li>
          </ol>
          <p><u><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Things Not To Do On A Vox Raid</font></b></u></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Never use any offensive AE (area
              effect) songs, weapons, or spells, during, before, or after the
              attack. There are numerous mobs that dwell beneath Vox's lair
              (level 50+ polar bears come to mind) that will be pulled if
              offensive AE is used.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Do not evac. Either camp out, or
              die and let the CR team take over. All evac spots are too far from
              Permafrost for the groups to come back together within a
              reasonable time frame. In the event of crash, your party's
              halfling can be used as a flotation device.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Do not wander in the area between
              the King Camp and Vox's lair. There are many pitfalls in this area
              that lead to underground caves chock-full of level 50 monsters
              ready and willing to eat you.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Do not fight Vox anywhere but in
              her lair. Fighting Vox in any other location will usually result
              in her corpse going &quot;poof&quot; (thus no loot).</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Do not complain if you die multiple
              times, this aggravates others and lowers the morale of all groups.
              You knew what you were signing up for, so take it in-stride.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><b><u><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Notes</font></u></b></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Dragon Fear spell is the biggest
              inhibitor to a successful dragon raid. Due to this, only level 50
              players will be in the first 4 groups, and level 49+ players in
              the remaining groups. These players have the highest chance to
              resist the Dragon Fear based on their level, thus it is logical
              that they should be the ones in the raid.</font></li>
