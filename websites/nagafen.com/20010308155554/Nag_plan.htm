              die and let the CR team take over.&nbsp;</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Arial">Do not complain if you die multiple
              times, this aggravates others and lowers the morale of all groups.
              You knew what you were signing up for, so take it in-stride.</font></li>

            <li><font size="-1" face="Arial">Dragon Fear spell is the biggest
              inhibitor to a successful dragon raid. Due to this, only level 50
              players will be in the first 4 groups, and level 49+ players in
              the remaining groups. These players have the highest chance to
              resist the Dragon Fear based on their level, thus it is logical
              that they should be the ones in the raid.</font></li>
