          <p align="left"><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Well, now that the
          dicussion is academic, allow me to address the exclusivity remarks.<br>
          <br>
          Everquest is a game designed around &quot;exclusive and inclusive
          groups&quot;. That is, to perform a task, you must select specific
          people from a group of people, include them in a party, then apply
          them to the situation. Use too few or too many and you spoil the task.
          This is what the game designers intended. Grouping and guild formation
          are a core game mechanic.<br>
          <br>
          As a newbie, to survive in Everquest, you quickly learn that finding 5
          other compatriots is much easier than working your way to the top
          alone. Now let's treat the &quot;guild&quot; as an individual for a
          second. As a &quot;guild&quot;, Bozo decides that it is too difficult
          for him to work his way to the top alone. Therefore Bozo contacts his
          buddies, Schleppo and Tanko. He proposes they work together to achieve
          the things that are near impossible to do as an individual(guild). You
          see, Bozo trusts Schleppo and Tanko, as they don't tend to get
          everyone killed, unlike others such as Necro and Wizzo. Guilds coming
          together to achieve a task is simply a larger scale version of 2 or 3
          newbies grouping together to take down dervish cutthroats.<br>
          <br>
          No one is preventing other guilds from forming aliiances and doing the
          exact same thing. It is not our fault that we can organize. We should
          not be penalized or chastised for it.<br>
          <br>
          I am sometimes criticized by my allies for making plans and maps
          available to the public. I have stated before, and firmly believe that
          everyone has the right to be able to do Dragons, Planes, and other
          large scale tasks. In the past, I have organized raids for both
          Dragons and Planes that were &quot;open to one and all&quot;. These
          type of events are very dificult to manage and organize, draining huge
          amounts of energy and effort. That is why they are not the
          &quot;norm&quot;, but rather the exception. It is much easier to
          accomplish these tasks with a known ally who you have come trust and
          rely upon.<br>
          <br>
          This point completely disregards tactical considerations. From a
          tactical point of view, you want to accomplish the task efficiently as
          possible, with as little deaths as possible. You want loot to be
          predetermined to avoid conflict. You want a plan. You want a map. You
          want veteran participants. You want an efficient group structure that
          flows down from a central organizer. This means you bring along only
          people that you can trust to operate under these conditions. You bring
          your guild, and your experienced allies.<br>
          <br>
          Our raids are successful largely because of group layout. We have the
          guild-specific organizers from each guild all in the same group. We
          have the groups diversified so that communication travels efficiently
          from the event-organizer to the guild-specific organizers to the
          individuals in other groups. Such communication is not possible in
          &quot;non-Triad&quot; events. The degree to which communication
          suffers in these non-Triad events can be measured in corpses.<br>
          <br>
          I hope this provides some justification for the Triad's existence, and
          explanation on why people may be excluded from events for &quot;no
          good reason&quot;.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The establishment of the Triad is

          an amazing step for the Rathe Community as a whole. It is an

          accomplishment that will always be remembered and will stand out among

          all of EQ for a very long time. The Triad puts the Rathe server and

          the guilds involved easily near the top of the spectrum in relation to

          accomplishments and ability.<br>

          <br>

          I wish to commend everyone within the three guilds. Despite a few odd

          bumps in the road, we have easily held together. This is an alliance

          that hopefully will withstand the test of time. Given time, as well,

          it will grow even stronger and smoother as we perfect a number of the

          processes involved. We must realize that we are still in our infancy,

          with challenges to meet and overcome around every corner. The good

          will and understanding of the individuals within the three guilds will

          go a long way towards easily handling those challenges. Not to mention

          patience =)<br>

          <br>

          Let me share with you my feelings on the Triad and what it is and

          stands for. I do not view the Triad as a means to an end (defeating

          dragons, gods, etc). I view it as more of the ability to reach out

          beyond our respective guilds and embrace others, those members in the

          guilds that make up the Triad. It is no coincidence at all that CIW,

          KEG and MFH have joined together, we are the three most accomplished

          and most capable guilds on the Rathe. We also know that each guild (CIW,

          KEG, MFH) consists of very fine people, each and every one.<br>

          <br>

          Too long has a rift been in place between many individuals that had

          prevented this from happening, but hopefully that rift is steadily

          being pulled back together. We all know our histories as individuals

          and the history of the guilds involved with the Triad. Through working

          together, we have the opportunity and skill to accomplish anything we

          wish to. And through the goodwill of everyone involved, we have the

          chance to create a bond that will be quite timeless.<br>

          <br>

          I have dedicated myself to the Triad and to doing whatever is

          necessary to further its growth. I am very proud of what we have

          accomplished and I am sure will be proud of whatever we accomplish in

          the time to come.<br>

          <br>

          I want to thank everyone for their patience during the birth of the

          Triad and for the coming months. I am certain that with a little work,

          a little stress and a good bit of friendship, the Triad will become

          quite timeless.<br>

          <br>

          Just had to say it =)<br>
