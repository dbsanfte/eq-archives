          <p><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="-1">Disclaimer</font></b><font size="-1">:
          This is a proven strategy if executed properly. Special thanks to BotS
          guild on the Rathe for discovering the north wall camp spot. Here is
          what you must be prepared for in order for it to be successful:</font></font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">You will die at least once during
              initial setup.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Be prepared to die about 4 times
              throughout the course of the evening. If this price is too high to
              pay, please notify me and you will be removed from the Fear raid.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Have a newbie character ready.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Know who your group leader is, so
              that you can send them tells as to when it is safe to
              log-in/zone/etc. during initial setup.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Be on time. The raid starts at
              3pm EST. If you are late, you will miss the opportunity to run to
              camp, die, and be resurrected. If you are late, your next
              opportunity to log in will probably be much later, when the area
              around the portal is cleared.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b><u>The Plan</u></b></font></p>
          <ol>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The CR (corpse recovery) group
              will be logged into Fear and camped at the North wall Camp (1390,
              500) prior to Fear spawning. After camping, they will be
              reentering the game as newbie characters until it is time to log
              in and start resurrecting.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At 9pm EST we will start sending
              in people one at a time. You will be fully buffed. You will have
              invisible or superior camouflage, see invisible, resist magic,
              dead-man floating, and spirit of the wolf, in addition to any
              health buffs available.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Upon zoning in, you will
              immediately run Northwest toward the Tentacle Terrors. Then run
              due north towards the wall of fire along the path shown on this <a href="images/maps/fearsnag2.jpg" target="_self">map</a>.
              Do not run blindly. If you see a spinechill spider or shiverback,
              try to steer clear of it. They can see invisible. You probably
              wont see Scarelings, but they will see you, so be prepared for a
              quick death.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If you fail to reach the camp
              spot, we will recover your corpse once that area is secure.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once you reach the camp, let
              whatever mobs are on you (80% chance for rookies to be spotted
              :&gt;) kill you. That's right, die there.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If by some stroke of luck nothing
              saw you. Camp out. Log in as newbie.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Send your group leader (or
              Shomari .. aka Snaggle, if group leader is unavailable) a message
              that you are &quot;in&quot;. At this point we will send in the
              next victim.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once everyone is in and safely
              dead, we will begin ressing the Scout group and the Mez group. Any
              members of these groups whose bodies are currently irrecoverable
              will be temporarily replaced by members of other groups.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The initial three groups will
              clear a relative safe spot around the camp. We will then start
              dragging corpses that didn't make it close enough in for rezzes.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">We will rezz the remaining
              groups. During this time we will try to minimize fighting due to
              the threat of packet loss and linkdeath.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once all groups are in we will
              begin to pull from the west, then make our way south.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once the zone is clear, we will
              clear the temple and make it safe to zone out.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If Cazic Thule has spawned, we
              will attempt to kill him after we clear the temple.</font></li>
          </ol>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><u><b>Contingencies</b></u></font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If Cazic Thule and Draco have
              spawned the zone will be much more dangerous. To take down the
              Dracolich, we may reorganize groups to mirror dragon-raid type
              groups.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If everyone dies horribly due to
              someone training while CR is being performed. We will take the
              remaining groups and fall on the backup plan.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b><u>The Backup Plan</u></b></font></p>
          <ol>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Zone in invisible with three
              groups in rapid succession and secure the West Wall Camp.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Once camp is secured bring in
              additional groups (if any).</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Kill any roamers first then work
              our way north then east. This plan is our traditional Fear plan,
              and usually involves much death and evacing. Eventually, it does
              work. But it hurts like hell.</font></li>
          </ol>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b><u>Guidelines</u></b></font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Assist Snaggle. Make a button
              that types /assist Snaggle. Use this button whenever a pull is
              incoming. Once the target is dead, wait until Snaggle (that's me)
              engages the next target then mash your &quot;Assist Snaggle
              Button.&quot; As the night progresses you may be changing your
              button to &quot;Assist Yukitaro&quot;, or &quot;Assist Vardamin&quot;,
              etc.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In the case of a pull with
              multiple mobs that are mesmerized, do not engage the mesmerized
              mob until the tanks have all taunted it at least twice (ideally
              three times). This keeps our enchanters/bards from dying.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If you find yourself in the
              position of being swarmed by mobs away from the group, die there.
              Do not pull a train into the group. There will be one official
              puller at all times. Anyone else who pulls, be prepared to die.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The group leader will be
              responsible for looting. Do not loot a mob in the midst of battle.
              Wait for the battle to cease so that your group leader may loot.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Do not, under any circumstance,
              ask a GM to respawn the zone. Doing so is bad. Very, very bad.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Do not invite GMs or Guides along
              to watch us. Although we love them dearly, they have been known to
              aggravate mobs and train parties in Fear. Furthermore, they
              usually observe our tactics, then report them to the development
              team. The development team likes to tweak things with the next
              patch to make them much harder. You are in OUR zone now. Grah!</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana">There will be a pop quiz in the
              morning. This is not an open book quiz and grades will not be
              curved. Study your Fear Guidelines.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b><u>Loot</u></b></font></p>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Loot will be distributed in the
          following order:</font></p>
          <ol>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><i>By need</i> - Determined by
              guildmasters/guild officers.</font>
            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><i>By mutual decision or random
              number among applicable classes</i> - It will be decided who gets
              the item based on class need, then by random number.</font></li>
          </ol>
          <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If the majority of people object to
          this method, we will fall back on distributing loot by random number.</font></p>
