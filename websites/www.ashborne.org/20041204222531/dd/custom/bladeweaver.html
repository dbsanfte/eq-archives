<td><center><font size=+1><B><i>Bladeweaver</i></B></font></center>A glint of metal, a spurt of blood, and the haze of death are all that the foolish enemy sees of the bladeweaver. Some whisper that they are god touched, most scoff that they are mad. Most blademasters prefer quick powerful strikes to the clunky alternative of a melee brawl, but once engaged they will fight with a ferocity and speed that puts fear into the hearts of even the most battle-hardened foe.<BR>To the Bladeweaver his weapon is an extension of himself, a piece of his arm, his friend throughout the long campaign. Through intense focus and a higly disciplined mind, over time the Bladeweaver is able to focus his Ki to enhance not only his own body but his weapon, performing feats which might otherwise seem impossible. <BR>
The two-weapon fighting style is prevalent among the bladeweavers. Many bladeweavers are seen as masters of this style, effortlessly weaving their twin blades in a style which will put the average fighter to shame. Though double weapons are occasionally used by some bladeweavers, such bladeweavers are looked down upon by "true" 
bladeweavers.<br>
When the Bladeweaver class is selected, a specific bladed weapon is chosen, and the class special abilities apply only to that weapon.</td></tr></table> That does not mean, if you choose longsword, that you must constantly use the same longsword you have when selecting the class, but you must use A masterwork equivalent.<BR>
Most Bladeweavers are Fighters, though many rangers are drawn to the more martial skills of the class. Occasionally Rogues and Ex-Paladins are drawn to this class, though the harsh demands of training often turn away those who are not truly willing to devote themselves to it. Monk and Bard bladeweavers are not unheard of, but are indeed rare. <BR>
NPC bladeweavers are often higly valued servants of a kingdom, or special members of an organized military band. Many times the bladeweaver functions as a scout or leader for an elite group in an organized army. Though they are able to function alone, they prefer to work in groups to avoid ending up in a situation where they can be swarmed by simple numbers. Many are shunned even in large groups, the eccentric practices and disciplines of the class tend to make those who are unfamiliar with them uncomfortable. Evil Bladeweavers will often be found in environments prepared to suit their abilities, many high steep cliffs, trees, and areas to allow skirmish fighting. They may even hold sway over a local village or town, intimidating the populace and using the rooftops of the city as the infinite ambush sites they are designed to be.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Class Features:</B>
<BR>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: Bladeweavers are proficient with all bladed weapons(Simple to Exotic). Abilities below marked with an asterix(*) are lost if the bladeweaver wears medium or heavy armor, or carries a heavy load.
<BR><BR>
<B>Oath Of the Blade(Ex):</B> Upon selection of the bladeweaver class the character selects a bladed weapon which he has weapon focus in. The character gains the benefits of Weapon Finesse for that weapon, as well as Weapon Specialization, even if the character might not normally be eligible for such feats. These bonuses are considered Oath bonuses, and function as Virtual feats.  If the oath is broken, the Oath benefits are lost.  The character swears an oath to forswear the use of Blunt weapons. Because of their oath bladeweavers also suffer a -2 penalty when using piercing weapons. Any Bladeweaver who violates this oath loses the benefits of the Bladeweaver class, until they are able to atone for their actions(as through use of the atone spell).
<br><b>Ritual of the Blade(Ex):</b> The intense focus and discipline required by the Bladeweaver is embodied and enhanced by this daily ritual.  See the ritual below for details.
<BR><B>*Acrobatics(Su):</B> A 1st-level bladeweaver gains a +10 competence bonus on Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks. At 5th level, this bonus increases to +20, and at 10th level it is +30.
<BR><B>*Leaps and Bounds(Ex):</B> A bladewaver's jumping distance (vertical or horizontal) is not limited according to his height.
<BR><B>*Quick Step(Su):</B> A bladeweaver moves faster than normal. A Small bladeweaver moves more slowly than a Medium-size bladeweaver, while a ratling moves faster, as shown on the table above.  This is an Inherent bonus.
<BR><B>*Acrobatic Attack(Ex):</B> At 2nd level, if the bladeweaver attacks by jumping at least 5 feet toward his opponent, jumping down at least 5 feet onto his opponent or swinging on a rope or similar object into his opponent, he gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls. The bladeweaver must make a jump check; if the result is less than 5 feet, he cannot use this ability on that attack . If the result is greater than the distance between the bladeweaver and the opponent, the bladeweaver can limit the distance to that between himself and the opponent as a free action.  This action is considered to be a charge action, and may not be made in addition to a charge.
<BR><B><I>Ki</I>Blade 1(Sp):</B> At 3rd level, once per day a bladeweaver can temporarily focus his ki through his blades to achieve a specific effect. The effect lasts for 1 minute/level, and the bladeweaver can create the effect once per day.  The effect goes onto both of his blades, simultaneously. At 3rd level, the bladeweaver can choose to add any +1 equivalent effect he knows to his blades.  At 3rd and each consecutive level of Bladeweaver, the Bladeweaver selects 2 abilities which he is capable of creating though this ability.  A bladeweaver can use this ability even if he is wearing medium or heavy armor.
<BR><B><I>Ki</I>Blade 2(Sp):</B> At 6th level, twice per day a bladeweaver can choose to add any +2 equivalent effect he knows to his blade. Alternatively, he can add previous <i>Ki</i>Blade abilities to his blade up to +2, though he may not use more than one effect at any given time.
<BR><B><I>Ki</I>Blade 3(Sp):</B> At 9th level, 3 times/day a bladeweaver can choose any +4 equivalent effect he knows to add to his blade. Alternatively, he can add previous <i>Ki</i>Blade abilities to his blade up to +4, though he may not use more than one effect at any given time.
<BR><B>*Absolute Ambidexterity(Ex):</B> Beginning at 10th level, the bladeweaver's attack penalties for fighting with two weapons lessen by 2. Thus, if he fights with a light weapon in his off hand, he suffers no penalties on his attack rolls for fighting with two weapons. (If the off-hand weapon is not light, he suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls with both his primary hand and his offhand.)
<BR><B><I>Ki</I> Critical(Ex):</B> Gain the Superior Critical Feat for free.  Double your weapon of choice's threat range for critical hits. This bonus is applied last, after any multipliers, such as those given by the Improved Critical feat or by keen weapons.
<br><b><i>New effect:</i></b> Passage(+3) - Once per day, a Passage weapon can slice a portal through the astral plane.  This works as the <i>plane shift</i> spell, but creates a portal that remains open for 1d4 rounds then closes.  Any creature can pass through the portal, in either direction, while it is open, but once it is closed it cannot be opened again.

<B><font size=+2>Bladeweaver Rituals:</font></B>
<BR><BR><B><I>Ritual of the Blade:</I>
<BR>Level: True Ritual - Bwv1
<BR>Components: V,S,M
<BR>Members Required: 1
<BR>Proxy: No
<BR>Time to perform: 1 hour
<BR>Range: Personal
<BR>Target: Bladeweaver
<BR>Duration: 24 hours
<BR>Saving Throw: None
<BR>Spell Resistance: No</B>
<BR><BR><B>Description:</B>The bladeweaver's focus with the blade and his skill with acrobatics requires an intense amount of constant practice. The smooth weave of his twin sword fighting style ties in 
well with his acrobatic maneuvers, but only when precision is maintained. The true bladeweaver will perform this ritual every day. Many purist bladeweavers insist that this ritual must be performed naked, with allowances for modesty only if privacy is unavailable, though the practice is not common.
<BR><BR><B>Ritual effect:</B>This ritual has no effect when performed.  It is a mandatory part of every Bladeweaver's day, similar to spell preparation for arcane casters.  If a bladeweaver goes a week without performing this ritual, he takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls or skill checks which would normally be enhanced by this class.  If a bladeweaver goes for a month without performing this ritual, his penalties are increased until he has performed this ritual, by 1 point for every day over 30.
<BR><BR><B>Material Component:</B> Bladeweaver Weapons (not consumed, must be using those weapons to recieve bonuses mentioned here)<BR><B>EXP cost:</B> 50 xp only if bladeweaver is performing this ritual after having abstained for longer than a month.
<BR><center><img src="images/Bw3.jpg"></center>
<BR><BR><BR>
<BR><B><I>Ritual of the Body:</I>
<BR>Level: True Ritual - Bwv2
<BR>Components: V,S,M,XP
<BR>Members Required: 1
<BR>Proxy: No
<BR>Time to perform: 12 hours, uninterrupted
<BR>Range: Personal
<BR>Target: Bladeweaver
<BR>Duration: Instantaneous
<BR>Saving Throw: None
<BR>Spell Resistance: No</B>
<BR><BR><B>Description:</B>Veteran of 1000 combats, having seen more battle than many can imagine, the bladeweaver has taken pain even as 
he dishes it out. The ritual of the body is a form of ritual scarring intended to show his lack of fear of these wounds, and that the mind is but a tool containing the powerful will within.
<BR><BR><B>Ritual effect:</B>This ritual involves a ritual scarring and bloodletting which is both painful and occasionally dangerous. Because of that, the bladeweaver gains a DR of 1/- which allows him to ignore the minor wounds which battle sometimes brings.
<BR>Upon Completion of this ritual the bladeweaver suffers 6d10 damage, and must make a fortitude save dc 10 or pass out from the sheer pain of the ritual. This ritual may be performed 3 times over the course of a bladeweaver's progression, once at level 2, once at level 6, and once at level 10.
<BR>Special: Any bladeweaver who bares the scars from this ritual gains a +1 check on intimidate and bluff checks made to frighten. The majority of the wounds are on the torso, and are not visible in a suit of armor. This effect does not increase with consecutive rituals.
<BR><BR><B>Material Component:</B> Steel weapon, Dwarven steel weapon, 
Adamantine weapon, Mithril weapon, and a magic weapon of some sort(not 
consumed). 500gp in healing materials(consumed). 500gp in herbs(consumed).
<BR><B>EXP cost:</B> 500 xp
<BR><BR>
<B><I>Ritual of the Mind:</I>
<BR>Level: True Ritual - Bwv4
<BR>Components: M
<BR>Members Required: 1
<BR>Proxy: No
<BR>Time to perform: 12 hours, uninterrupted (or 3 days of study broken up)
<BR>Range: Personal
<BR>Target: Bladeweaver
<BR>Duration: Instantaneous
<BR>Saving Throw: None
<BR>Spell Resistance: No</B>
<BR><BR><B>Description:</B> A magical weapon forms a pattern, imprinted upon a blade for the ages by its creator, usually at great personal cost.  Through this ritual, the Bladeweaver studies the pattern imprinted upon a magical blade so that he may create it through the use of his <i>Ki</i> Blade ability.
<BR><BR><B>Ritual effect:</B> This ritual allows the Bladeweaver to learn new magical effects for his <I>Ki</i> Blade effect.  Through either 12 hours of uninterrupted study, or a total of 72 hours of study broken up into various sessions, the Bladeweaver learns the pattern of a specific magical effect, and is capable of re-creating it.
<BR><BR><B>Material Components:</B> A magical weapon with the effect to be learned.
<BR><BR>
<B><I>Ritual of the Soul:</I>
<BR>Level: True Ritual - Bwv6
<BR>Components: V,S,M,XP
<BR>Members Required: 1
<BR>Proxy: No
<BR>Time to perform: 24 hours, uninterrupted
<BR>Range: Personal(must have blade in hands)
<BR>Target: Bladeweaver's Weapon
<BR>Duration: Instantaneous
<BR>Saving Throw: None
<BR>Spell Resistance: No</B>
<BR><BR><B>Description:</B>Every blade with a trace of magic has an ego 
within it, a primal sense of intelligence. Through an intense focus this ritual awakens that ego, imparting a familiarity between the bladeweaver and his blade, and the desire to remain in his possession.<BR><BR><B>Ritual effect:</B>The awakened ego of the Bladeweaver's Weapon gains an affinity for its owner. Should another character ever pick up the blade they must make an Ego check with the Ego being two times the bladeweavers level when this ritual is performed. If the weapon becomes dominant it will insist on returning to the bladeweaver who performed the ritual. If the weapon was taken by someone who killed the bladeweaver that performed the ritual, the blade will attempt to force its possessor into combat, and force its possessor to surrender. <BR>Should this ritual be performed on an item with an existing Ego, there is a 50% chance that this ritual will assert permanent dominance for the bladeweaver. This chance drops 5% for every point of ego over 20. Success should be determined secretly by the DM and disclosed only if he chooses.
<BR>Upon completion of this ritual the character takes 1d10 hp damage, and suffers from the effect of exhaustion(-1 on all rolls/ac/etc) until he has fully rested.
<BR><BR><B>Material Components:</B> 100gp/point of awakened ego(2 x bladeweavers level)
<BR><B>EXP cost:</B> 10 xp
<BR><BR>
<B><I>Ritual of the Heart:</I>
<BR>Level: True Ritual - 
Bwv10
<BR>Components: V,S,M,XP
<BR>Members Required: 3
<BR>Proxy: yes(divine spellcaster, arcane spellcaster)
<BR>Time to perform: 1 week
<BR>Range: Personal
<BR>Target: Bladeweaver's Signet
<BR>Duration: Instantaneous
<BR>Saving Throw: None
<BR>Spell Resistance: No</B>
<BR><BR><B>Description:</B>The signature of the bladeweaver, the ritual of the Heart must be performed at the earliest possible time upon reaching level 10 of the bladeweaver class. This ritual, which must be augmented by at least 2 other people, is a rare and beautiful thing, one of the few remembered rituals which creates a minor artifact.
<BR><BR><B>Ritual effect:</B>This ritual will create the Minor Artifact 
Bladeweaver's Essence. However, Little is known of the true purpose behind the ritual. At the DM's discretion the artifact may have a special purpose, with the ego to insure its special purpose is completed and special purpose powers at the DMs discretion. Each ritual of the heart is different, some clerics who have assisted the ritual insist on seeing a divine being, some wizards insist they saw a bit of the weave of magic pulse into the ring, while others claim it simply popped into existence.(in other words: DM have fun!) This ritual may only be performed once, any attempts to perform this ritual multiple times can be extremely damaging to all participants and may earn them the ire of a divine entity.
<BR><BR><B>Material Components:</B> Signet Ring of masterwork quality(preferably of a superior metal)
<BR><B>EXP cost:</B> base cost is 4,000xp split any way among the 3 involved, though each player must take at least 200xp penalty. Due to the unsure nature of the ritual this cost may be lowered, or increased, depending on the results(Dm Discretion)
<BR><center><img src="images/Bw4.jpg"></center><br>
<B>Custom Bladeweaver items:</B>
<BR>Bladed Arrows - Identical to standard arrows but with a different 
arrowhead which functions as a slashing weapon. Custom work, occasionally engraved with the mark of the bladeweaver. 20 arrows - 3gp. Engraved - 6gp
<BR><BR>Bladeweaver's Essence<BR>This minor artifact can only be created through a ritual known among the bladeweavers as the Ritual of the Heart. Though each essence is different, there are some abilities which are the same regardless of the bladeweaver. Each Bladeweaver's Essence functions as though it had the following abilities: Feather Fall, Greater Acrobatics(+15 Insight), Greater Climbing(+15 Competence), Sustenance, and Uncanny Dodge. In addition to those abilities the DM selects 2d3 of the following abilities: Mind Shielding, Regeneration, Protection +5, Improved Evasion, Improved Mettle, Dexterity +6(enhancement), Improved Initiative, or an extra attack every round at highest bonus as if using a <i>speed</i> weapon. The DM may also choose to have this item be created with a special purpose, and any special purpose powers he chooses.
<BR>The Bladeweaver's Essence is a trademark of the 10th level bladeweaver, and is an incredibly coveted item, both by fighters who wish to have its benefits and by wizards who wish to learn how such artifacts may be created for themselves. Many bladeweaver's have fallen 
for their possession of this artifact, only to dissapoint their killer, as their essence leaves this plane so too does their essence leave their ring. Because of this odd property of the ring some whisper that it is the same as a Lich's Phylactery. Due to this many bladeweavers are feared as evil, though any who make such comparisons in the presence of a bladeweaver will quickly find themselves apologizing.
