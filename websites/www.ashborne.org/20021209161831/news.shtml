We found the IV up, so ran over to take him out.  Snakeyes won the ranger sword, Lindara won the FT mask, and some spells dropped.  Then we ran over to THO, cleared that out as well.  Flaak got himself a rogue poker, Kirasha and Obmi both won earrings, and more spells dropped, though none of the Wizard spells which ONLY drop from THO.  <b>Working as intended!</b>  Later we headed out to PoStorms, killed some giants there.  Was a particularly fun fight against the Giant boss, fighting the 20 or so zombies after he died was more amusing than anything Ive done in a while.  Latryzia won a Ring, Cantatus got a Spectral, and some people got medallions.<br><br>This update is mainly here because I upgraded the news updater, a real news updater will put up an interesting story with links later.</FONT></FONT><br></td></tr>
