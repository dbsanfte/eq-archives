We've killed all our rotation targets and landed a few FFA's here and there but the big news is that we dropped THO and started NToV!<p>THO is an interesting fight, glad we're getting to do some different stuff. He gave up a couple nice items and some great spells.<p><b>THO</b><p><i>Sonson</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics17/horns_chaos.jpg><p><i>Rassilon</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics17/scepter_channeled_lightning.jpg><p>Nice job gang, wish I coulda been there! =)<p><b>NToV</b><br>Excellent turnout last night gang. We did great. Pretty sure that losing our focus is the only thing we have to fear here. Long as we stay tuned in on what we're doing, all these dragons will die.<p>Last night we dropped Aary, Feshlek and Dagarn along with associated guards and flurries. Loot was pretty nice and here are the winners and their spoils!<p>Aary's Guard dropped this for <i>Ketocon!</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/shield_dragonkind.JPG><p><b>Aary gave up these goodies!</b><p><i>Grugin</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/katana_pain.jpg><p><i>Merrika</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/circlet_of_summer.JPG><p><i>Miana</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/mask_of_fall.JPG><p><b>The Flurries gave up some decent stuff too.</b><p><i>Viruk</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/shield_of_fury.JPG><p><i>Evemystery and Cloauk</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/ring_of_superiority.jpg><p><i>Khabul</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/shield_protector.jpg><p><i>Tinner</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/runed_fang_necklace.jpg><p><b>Fesh had these trinkets.</b><p><i>Lariny</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/staff_silent_star.JPG><p><i>Tinomen</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/amuletofstorm.JPG><p><b>Dagarn had a few more toys before the night was up.</b><p><i>Felinea</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/ancient_wurm_hide_greaves.GIF><p><i>Muntho</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/ancientwurmhiderobe.jpg><p><i>Khabul</i><br><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics16/belt_destroyer.JPG><p>Congratulate the winners next time you see them! <p>Let's keep up the work and finish up our turn in here. Couple more "difficult" (read: requires attention) fights left. Great start everyone!

Please register an account that actually reflects who you are, there are no global Vbulletin accounts so there is no reason why the admins should have to figure out who H4l7ma34 is.  Be patient on access for the next few days, Erath and I will be adding as fast as we can, but we need to give access to the entire alliance.<p>Have fun with the new features!

Our lil Gren hit the big Six Ooo!<p>Tuesday we killed Velk for fun. Not positive on drops but here is my best guess on what dropped and who got it.<p><img src=http://207.211.22.69/eq/new/equipment/ss/ss/velketorsspellbook.jpg><p><img src=http://207.211.22.69/eq/new/equipment/ss/ss/crystalrodofconfusion.jpg><p><img src=http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/crystalcrownofconfusion.gif><p>Kirasha<br><img src=http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/snowstormmask.jpg><p>Sevitor of Luclin also died Tuesday afternoon.

She finished her Epic tonight! Grats Jan!<p>Jannelle<p><img src=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/images/eqitems/earthcaller.jpg><p>Other drops included lots of misc armor and some folks actually needed it. =) I didn't get the full list but here are some of the notables.<p>Braeryan<br><img src=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/Ethereal%20Mist%20Chestplate.gif><p>and<p><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/darkbrood_mask.jpg ><p>Snuphy<p><img src=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/brewersmeshcloak.jpg><p>Tinner<p><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/earring_bashing.jpg><p>All for now, more to come as we continue to romp about like puppies on acid!

Will be nice to start killing these dragons. Dontcha just love flurry birds? Ranger's best friend...<p>Sunday night, we went up to PoF and killed the big ugly. Grats out to Belhothar on his new robe, Ventrue and Fumdar on their brains(I don't even need to comment do I?) and Chiasma on his collar.<p>Believe this is that fastest we've killed him as well, seemed like only a few minutes past Hal's Defensive disc and he was dead. Think we had more LD's than deaths too. Anyway, nice job on Thuley.<p>Gren got the big SIX O tonight! Aego plz, thx. Another Grats out to Gello. Gello also scored up an Ancient Aego scroll! This spell is a group version with more HPS/AC and only burns two peris! Go Clerics!

There are still a few things to be ironed out, so sit back, relax and enjoy whislt they we press your shirts.<p>Lately we've been busy lil beavers chewing on many new mobs and working on much new fun. All the changes to our targets should prove to be exciting as we work out the strats and put the teams together to kill them again.<p>With the switchover to the new site, I'd like to ask if there are any suggestions on what folks would like to see here. I'm not making any promises but I will see what I can do if there are some good ideas.<p>Substantive news should follow soon!<br>
