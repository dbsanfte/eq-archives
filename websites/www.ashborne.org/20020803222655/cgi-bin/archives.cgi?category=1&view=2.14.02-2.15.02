There are still a few things to be ironed out, so sit back, relax and enjoy whislt they we press your shirts.<p>Lately we've been busy lil beavers chewing on many new mobs and working on much new fun. All the changes to our targets should prove to be exciting as we work out the strats and put the teams together to kill them again.<p>With the switchover to the new site, I'd like to ask if there are any suggestions on what folks would like to see here. I'm not making any promises but I will see what I can do if there are some good ideas.<p>Substantive news should follow soon!<br>
