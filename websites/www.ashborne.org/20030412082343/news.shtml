The alliance made a concerted effort to camp the Bertox trigger and after a number of attempts, our hard work paid off.  Our first few attempts were mostly to learn the cycle and by our third attempt we had a solid strategy down for defeating big ugly.  On the third attempt we made it to Bertox himself but he whooped us badly.

<tr><td><B><A NAME="1044994574"><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="4" FACE="arial">Lots and Lots and Lots.......</b><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="2" FACE="arial"> - <A HREF="mailto:wth5@georgetown.edu">Belhothar</A> @ 12:16 pm PST<br>We had a very big weekend, accomplishing many different alliance firsts. In fact, I would go so far as to say that this was one of the most successful few days that we've had in quite a long time. From this two questions obviously come up: 1) Belhothar, you slacker, why didnt you update the page immediately after these monumental triumphs, and 2) WTH are my nice shiney pictures (cause you know warriors cant read)!?!? Well, the answers are simple: 1) I sadly have a real life that occasionally stops me from living in Norrath, sad as it may be, and 2) we changed the boards that host us (or some techno jargon that I, being a computer moron, dont understand) and so the place where pictures used to go isnt there anymore. Hopefully this will be remedied soon, and I can put the nice big pictures in for the more linguistically challenged.<br><br>So late thursday and running into friday morning we were chilling (literally) out in Kael, cause, like, we could, hoping that we'd finally get a shot against the ever elusive Avatar of War. As with most things, we'd fought the idol a few times, but those few times were far in the past, back when we were lucky to have a buffed tank break 7k (6.8ish being the order of the day) and no one was lvl 65 or had all our new fancy stuffs. So we were pretty confident that when the showdown occurred we'd come out on top. Tormax and the Statue both popped at basically the same time, we mowed down KT, and then moved over to the statue. We had one of those "interesting" pulls that occasionally happen, so had about 3-4 adds come along with the statue, scrapped the idea of fighting him unslowed (ok, we're wussies, but where's the fun in wiping? honestly, who throws their shoe, honestly?) and we destroyed him and his friends with no deaths (wow, we're pretty sweet aint we, hehe). Loot was beyond terrible (hammer and 2 reavers). <br><br>We moved over to a convenient corner and pulled the idol. Dropped him with 0 deaths. Wow, 1.2k extra hps, 5 more lvls and a truckload of new AAs sure do make things nice. We pulled the AoW, lost one tank at about 20%, 2 or 3 more people durring the cross over (sue us, it was the first time trying him) and then got a nice corpse. Sadly, my connection died about 4% before the AoW, so even if I could upload a picture I'm not sure I could give you a corpse shot. But hey, everyone's seen 'em so its nothing new...... just woulda been nice to see us near one..... well, should be more in the near future!<br>Loot:<br>Blade of Carnage: Nyle<br>Ring of Destruction: Dizank<br>Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask: Msvindar<br>War Bow of Rallos Zek: Aleytus<br><br>So, cool, one more notch in our belt (or BKK, where ever you keep track)<br><br>Next day rolls around and Ssra dumps or something, anyhoo, the Rhags are up and we're going there. #1 and #2 are such jokes that 3 dead men and their grandparents coulda killed them while walking up hill in the snow to school (both ways mind you). We've done em before, their loot is borring, they get this many sentences and less if I could figure out a way to do it. the Arch Lich however, was a new friend, we'd never seen him, and we wanted our first visit to be memorable. We knew he rampaged, so we set up, killed his guards, sent in the meatshiel...er.... valiant warriors, and proceeded to beat him down like none other. I guess I have read to many posts or something, but I sure was expecting him to be rampaging a whole heck of a lot more than he did. Pretty sure we did it with 0 deaths, not to shabby for a first try.<br>Loot was:<br>Keen Edged Cleaver: Heebbon<br>Platinum Mesh Guard: Jannelle<br>Pristine Jade Idol: Kinster<br><br>Ok, woot, we killed stuff... Then the next day rolls around, Ssra's repoping again (either this is the least stable zone ever, or we got dam lucky). So, like the dutiful <insert herd animal here> that we are, we headed over again. Finished up some Emp keys while we were there, then headed over to Xerkizh the Creator (if he created them, couldnt he have come up with a better name for himself...). We actually had more trouble with this fight than with the Arch Lich, prolly cause we did it with fewer, and cause it was so annoyingly long. In the end though, our first visit to this guy also resulted in one extremely dead snake.<br>Loot:<br>Dagger of Entrapment: Reprobus<br>Hammer of the Ironfrost: Arkand<br>Singed Petrified Leaf: Javonthalas<br><br>While we were kicking the crap (does anything in Norrath have bodily functions, and if so, why is there no remnants of it anywhere?) outta the Creator the High Priest popped. I envy no one trying to explain this fight to people who have never done it before. Much kudos to everyone from those explaining to those actually pulling it off. It basically took us about 3-4 hours to nail everything down, and there was much hair lost/grayed by the end of it, but the payoff was there! On our second ever attempt on the big grand po-ba of snakey religiocity (and crowd control seminar 101 thru 666) we our 4th alliance first corpse shot of the weekend. Like big grats 'n everything to all of us, we, like, rule 'n stuffs.<br>Loot:<br>Blackout: Kenamen<br>Ivory Crystal Greaves: Doser<br>Belt of Mystical Protection: Acana<br><br>Now, the day would have seriously been the crowning achievement of personal firsts if we had managed to also drop the Cursed cycle that was sitting down there in the basement. Thanks to awesome (read as buggy) coding, we actually got the loot dropping versions of the first two mobs (who had been killed earlier) to spawn for us. Now this was both a blessing and a curse. A blessing, cause we got 6 nice items. A curse because while figuring out the Exiled's stuffs and dealing with Cursed strats, the big boy despawned on us. Yes, this is no fun, yes despawns have happened to us in the past, yes no one wanted this to happen. But seriously folks, was still a pretty sweet weekend when you come right down to it.<br>Loot from Cursed cycle:<br>Corrupted Skull Earring: Devaryen<br>Black Runed Talisman: Barmek<br>Rancorous Skull of (holy cow buy a new name) Szaldrezh: Doser (who somehow did not have a pal/sk one hander by this point /boggle)<br>Braided Strand of Corrupted Mana: Aleytus<br>Geomantic Focus: Kirasha<br>Shroud of Unholiness: Cantatus<br><br>In other news, we cleared out NToV, Yelinak, Zland (pretty sure), Sev (thanks no green scale /rude) and maybe some other things.<br><br>Overall a great weekend, and if your lucky, I might add in some pictures to go with the truly world class verbiage that you have just been privileged to read.<br><br>Until then, I'm Belhothar Ulthuran and that's news to me</FONT></FONT><br></td></tr>

No matter how badly we screw up an encounter the first two times, no matter how far out of reach something seems, if we get it a third time, it dies. Fortunately for us, this was the third time we were attempting the Carprin cycle in the Crypt of Decay.<br><br>(ok, rant here for a second: what's with the names in PoP? did they just add extra letters where they don't seem to make sense? SaryRn, should just be Saryn. It sounds nicer, rolls off the tounge/keyboard easier, and people are just more comfortable with it... so it might infringe on some copyright laws, Sony's big enough to deal with it. The second is Carprin. Yes, again, there are two "r"s in there. Why I ask you? doesnt Caprin sound nicer? Heck, even other major guilds have his name listed as that. I'd fought him twice and still had the wrong name! Ok, well, I could be a moron, but I can't complain about ring events in the Plane of Earth, of fps in Water, so I have to pick my battles!)<br><br>Anyhoo, continuing our story, we'd tried Carprin twice before. Once, with a scratched together crew of 24ish after our first Grummus kill. We got him to about 20% on the first pull, he warped onto us no less, when we lost the only warrior we had left. We figured, "ok, everyone zone out and we'll give him another shot." No go, since 20 people suddenly clicking the exit in CoD managed to crash the zone, fun huh? So second time was a few days ago. We killed Carprin, but due to mismanaging the encounter not only did we make it a lot harder on ourselves (thnx 4x as many hps!) but when he died there was no Avhi to reward us for our efforts.<br><br>So anyway, no picture here cause honestly he aint worth it, we're fighting Carprin, doing it right way, kill him, and much to our delight trackers and eye wielders alike rejoice at seeing: <br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/avhi.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/avhi.jpg" border="0"><br>ok, so this picture was taken a little after that, but it sure does give a nice view of what a mob sees shortly before he dies. As anyone with an internet connection, a pulse, and any real interest in learning the encounter could find out (aka, I'm not giving away any 1337 b3t4 inf0z here) its possible for this fight to get badly out of hand very, very fast. We knew this, we said it over and over again, everyone knew how to not screw it up. What did we do? well.....<br><img width=800 height=600 src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/avhiscrewup.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/avhiscrewup.jpg" border="0"><br>needless to say 200+ skeletons will ruin anyones day (or night in this case, more to come later) quite fast. They did, and we died, heh, what's new. Learning new encounters is fun! (/em watches xp fall and fall and fall and fall....)<br><br>So with a few fresh faces, and a few people lost to the evil mob that is sleep, we again stressed what to do, and what not to do. Read Gello's quote for a good sum up of our second Avhi fight:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/avhidead.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/avhidead.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Ok, so Avhi's the technical one, Carprin's the warm up semi Aary guy of the whole cycle, so why the heck did they throw in the Bishop? Now, I know you read on other news pages about how mobs just fell over dead (ok, he's undead so he'd have to fall over dead again.... wont go there) but even with the room and his "guards" repoping right as we engaged him, I was able to throw maybe 3 nukes on him before he died. Guess I shouldn't complain, here's a corpse shot, cause, like, that's my job 'n stuffs.<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/bishopdead.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/bishopdead.jpg" border="0"><br><br>once he dies these guys spawn pretty close behind you, would have been interesting if some of us were just a tad bit further back:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/codhighpriest.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/codhighpriest.jpg" border="0"><br><br>The High Priest is technically the final mob in the cycle, but seriously, its his guards that are beasts. Considering it was about 2-3 in the morning when we pulled them, and we were at about 40 people, I was pleasantly surprised when we managed to kill both of them on their first pull. Sadly, I died to both (big arse lifetaps hurt, lots) and my email's dead so I dont have any corpse pics... anyway when they both die the High Priest becomes targetable. Doing what any sensible people would do, we threw A_Sonson at it, look at the pictures to see what happened:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/sonosnandultor.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/sonosnandultor.jpg" border="0"><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/deadsonsontoultor.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/deadsonsontoultor.jpg" border="0"><br>and for all of you that wondered, thats where all the Sonson's_Corpse_13710937461niner (did I hear a niner in there) come from.<br><br>Ok, it really did serve a purpose, and we are eternally thankful that Sonson shows up to litter Norrath with her corpses on a nightly basis. So we buffed, talked strat for oh, about 2 seconds, charged, and laughed all the way to the flags<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/ultordead.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/ultordead.jpg" border="0"><br><br>sadly, due to technical foulups (read hitting the "h" key twice) we only got 34 people flagged, but we'll be back, and then, Bertoxx will be ours (I'm already salivating over his loot... droooooool).<br><br>Oh, yeah, loot.... well, it was decent, I guess for us it was an upgrade, but frankly, I didnt get to sleep till 4am last night and by the end I lost track of who had won what. Plus there's enough images in this update already, and do you really want me to crash the boards again? heheheheheh so yeah, people won stuff, if someone cares I'll put it up, but really the "ph47 l3w7z" from all this is the flags and the shots at Bert (where's Ernie? (bonus points to anyone who knows where Sesame St. got those names))<br><br>To sum up, I'm Belhothar Ulthuran, and that's news to me!</FONT></FONT><br></td></tr>
