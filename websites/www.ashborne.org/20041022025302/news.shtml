<tr><td><B><A NAME="1060043805"><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="4" FACE="arial">Sol Ro, Seru & Stuff</b><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="2" FACE="arial"> - <A HREF="mailto:wth5@georgetown.edu">Belhothar</A> @ 4:36 pm PST<br>Lemme preface this (as I am wont to do) by saying that for a really long time know I've had an awesome idea for how to do the update for when we first killed seru. News junkies like myself no doubt remember the furor (pun intended) that FoH's serverwide first killing of Seru caused. I've always been rather partial to FoH's accomplishments, and when they update their news it's generally a fun read. So, partly in parody, partly in homage, I had planned to basically copy Furor's "I threw some really rediculous numbers at my clerics, and they threw some equally rediculous numbers back at me"... yadda yadda yaddda. Then I had it all planned out to que forward to where we are today and make a self depricating comment to the affect of: 'oh well, only 15 months late! ;)'<br><br>BUT (and it's a big butt)<br><br>due to my sorry attempts at actually having a real life, I personally was unable to attend the Seru kill, my own fault, whatcha gonna do. However, I DID ask many times for people to take frikken screenshots and send them in. However, in a lament that is all too frequent on news boards everywhere, my so called friends, decided to not send them in. So, instead of the update of a lifetime, yer all stuck reading just some mindless ramblings.... maybe that'll teach ya all!!<br><br>Loot was pretty sweet:<br>Grumblenuts: Sleeves<br>Samathrace: Ring<br>Gertrude: Veil<br>Ancient Concussion: Muntho<br><br>So, like, we'll be back, and maybe I'll have a picture for you all next time.<br><br>But first lets back up to saturday, and the real impetus for this update. AA killed SolRo baby! Pretty dern sweet, eh? Ok, so it's a forgone conclusion that once you kill RZ you'll be able to kill that wimp that so many delusional wizards follow instead of the true god Karana... but hey, it still opens up Fire and gives pretty schweet lewtz, so let me be happy in my feigned ignorance.<br><br>Some pictures for the drooling masses who can't read (did you know that the average news paper is written to a 6th grade reading level, as that's all the general public can comprehend? And that even the more *until recently* high brow publications are only published to an 8th grade reading level?..... maybe there are more of you droolers out there than I give credit too)<br><br>Here's the two faced sunofabiotch standing around, waiting for us to kill him:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solroalive.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solroalive.jpg" border="0"><br><br>after one of our more interesting starts to an encounter, we regrouped, tried again, and figured out that we should put our super-duper-triple-uber midget tank on him. Kinster, we salute you. If you look closely you can just pick him out below SolRo's staff<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solrofight.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solrofight.jpg" border="0"><br><br>A truly uneventful fight lead to the following, oh, so pretty picture:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solrodead.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solrodead.jpg" border="0"><br><br>It's oh-so sweet because that nice lil orb went to nice lil me! mwahahahahaha<br>if you hadnt figured it out, loot was:<br>Orb- Belhothar<br>Cloak- Delluna<br><br>oh, and I'll do a little public service announcement here. If in the future you kill solro for your first time, dont worry about hopping in the lava, just hail the projection and you get flagged. No reason for people to stress about it, and it's not like this is a 1337 s7|247 that I'm giving away, just trying to be nice.<br><br>So, anyhoo, all fire flagged I did this:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/infire.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/infire.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Always fun to go into new zones, and fire sure looks like it holds a lot of promise. (of course 7 EP guilds on one server... ugh, but then, why just go to negative stuffs, lets be positive! or so I'm told)<br><br>Anyway, because I'd rather be playing than typing, here's one last gem for you all. A little bit of evidence as to why druids are as screwed up as they are:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/potpic.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/potpic.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Until next time, thats the News from Norrath. I'm Belhothar Ulthuran and that's news to me!</FONT></FONT><br></td></tr>
