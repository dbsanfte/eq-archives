<tr><td><B><A NAME="1043455454"><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="4" FACE="arial">Velious Revival!</b><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="2" FACE="arial"> - <A HREF="mailto:wth5@georgetown.edu">Belhothar</A> @ 4:44 pm PST<br>These past few days we've been working on some cutting edge stuff! Things never before seen to the vast majority of the entire Alliance! These events are so new, that I'm afraid people wont believe we are actually this far along! So, without further ado I give you..........: THE COLDAIN RING WAR!!!!!!!<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/ringwarfight.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/ringwarfight.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Yes, this harrowing event was enthusiastically engaged and, straight up destroyed by the combined forces of the Ashborne Alliance, and what ever random folks were in the zone xping at the time. Such a victory will go down in the annals of EQ lore, right up there with the first Rallos, Fennin, Emperor and Seru kills. A triumphant victory shot can be seen both here:  <br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/narandi1.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/narandi1.jpg" border="0"><br>(note Sonson's tell)<br>and here<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/narandi2.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/narandi2.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Ok, returning to reality now. Basically, we've just never gotten around to doing this fight, largely because of faction issues. I guess it just seemed like the thing to do on a day when there wasn't anything else up. It's possible that when the ring first existed a loss was concievable, but honestly, now.... well, free 10th rings for all!!!<br><br>Other loot did drop, but I dont know who got what, or where to find pics of loot this old. Good job all on the fight though.<br><br>In more interesting news, we got our 3rd shot at Tunare last night. (I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Clearing that stupid, <explitive deleted>, <explitive deleted> plane has GOT to be the single most borring thing one can do. At least the payoff is worth it in the end.) Continuing the news, and not my personal ranting, after only 5 hours of clearing we were presented with this:<br><br> <img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tunare1.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tunare1.jpg" border="0"><br><br>which we promptly turned into this:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tunare2.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tunare2.jpg" border="0"><br><br>the loot was:<br><br>Wystler with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/naturesmelody.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/naturesmelody.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Kinster with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/girdleoflivingthorns.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/girdleoflivingthorns.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Nasham with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/fistofnature.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/fistofnature.jpg" border="0"><br><br>and Tkiami with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/goldenleafearring.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/goldenleafearring.jpg" border="0"><br><br>So, basically that's what we've been doing. Those of you with a perceptive eye might have noticed that these pics are all in jpeg, so you can quit complaining about that, and just send them to me now without fear of impossible download times.<br><br>Until next time, I'm Belhothar Ulthuran and that's news to me!</FONT></FONT><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><B><A NAME="1042700161"><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="4" FACE="arial">Terris Dead</b><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="2" FACE="arial"> - <A HREF="mailto:wth5@georgetown.edu">Belhothar</A> @ 10:56 pm PST<br>Ok, so here's the updated story, with lots of pictures and shiney things for you people who dont appreciate simplicity.<br><br>Terris has been a monkey in our wrench for some time now, defeating our early probing attempts at her. Admittedly we knew some of them were suicide runs, but still, no one likes dying. Ditching our normal psychizophrenic focus and actually getting several groups flagged through the hedge we were bound and determined to down the evil mouthless woman. (guys, think about this one for a sec, a woman with no mouth can't complain, or tell you to get off the sofa and stop watching football, eating pizza and drinking beer, and instead take her to the opera...... maybe we should have left her up on principle! heh)<br><br>Now that I've managed to piss off all the women who read this (your sense of humor is your friend ;p), lets continue. As we were missing a few key people at the time we moved on Terris it took us a while to get in towards her. As time dragged on and on we realized that our first try would have to be a success because we weren't getting another one. Looking down the long end of the barrel we were prepared to kick some deity arse!<br><br>We knew in a general way what was supposed to happen, and even had plans laid out for dealing with it. However, our exploratory forces had never really made it until the final phase, so we weren't 100% sure of how to go about things. After a short but vicious fight we were rewarded with the following:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/deadterris.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/deadterris.bmp" border="0"><br><br>And there was much rejoicing!<br><br>She was kind enough to give us:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/carvedbonering.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/carvedbonering.bmp" border="0"><br>which went to Braeryan<br><br>and a (say this name 10-times-fast-item):<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/knucklebonebeadedveil.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/knucklebonebeadedveil.bmp" border="0"><br>which went to Kirasha<br><br>Many got flagged, some (sadly myself included) did not. But dont distress (as those of you who read my initial posting might have) for the evil mouthless one shall die to our hands again, and then the flagging will flow like... well.... something that flows.<br><br>Afterwards, people went into torment, and had some fun, here are some pictures for those of you who havnt seen the zone before (and also cause I want to clog up your bandwith downloading this entire update):<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tormentfight1.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tormentfight1.bmp" border="0"><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tormentfight2.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tormentfight2.bmp" border="0"><br><br>In other news, earlier in the day our 52 and under crowd managed to drop Lady Vox. We got a scale from it, so the bards will be happy with that one.<br><br>Additionally we managed to find and kill Grummus a few days ago as well. No corpse shot, because, well, I have my reasons, and I assure you they are sinister. Loot was:<br>Dingdin with<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/chunkofdecayingcloth.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/chunkofdecayingcloth.bmp" border="0"><br>and Delluna with<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/puscoveredbeetlecarapace.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/puscoveredbeetlecarapace.bmp" border="0"><br><br>Now, it could just be me, but decaying cloth, and a pus covered beetle shell dont seem like things I'd want anywhere near my body, but these two seemed excited. Just dont tell them how bad they smell now!<br><br>Umm, that's all the big news, now that I'm finally getting some funny pictures, here's a nice little quotes section:<br>for as many rangers as we have in the alliance, you'd think we have a higher opinion of them<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/cheaprangers.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/cheaprangers.bmp" border="0"><br>fortunately for them, they have an iksar cleric on their side:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/saverangers.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/saverangers.bmp" border="0"><br>of course, there are also the times we make fun of them mercilessly<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/kaabobquote.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/kaabobquote.bmp" border="0"><br>and finally for those of you who for whatever reason are interested in joining our wonderful alliance, here is some of the leadership you can expect:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/kilravquote.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/kilravquote.bmp" border="0"><br>me losing my temper:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/assclowns.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/assclowns.bmp" border="0"><br>and then a classic for all of you old timers:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/vyktorquote.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/vyktorquote.bmp" border="0"><br><br>There's the pretty update that I promised. Keep the pics coming to me so that more staggering works of heartbreaking genius can be posted here! Finally, I'm Belhothar Ulthuran and that's news to me!</FONT></FONT><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><B><A NAME="1042233652"><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="4" FACE="arial">Glyphed and Exiled</b><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="2" FACE="arial"> - <A HREF="mailto:wth5@georgetown.edu">Belhothar</A> @ 1:20 pm PST<br>We knew that with the patch ending so late this would be one of our best opportunities to see some mobs that we never have before. So planning ahead we managed to get the basement cycle in ssra all to ourselves. First thing we saw once we killed all the triggers was this guy: <br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/glyphedfight.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/glyphedfight.bmp" border="0"><br><br>Now we knew he was a gimp, but anyway, about 1 minute later we had this situation present itself: <br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/deadglyphed.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/deadglyphed.bmp" border="0"><br><br>Knowing that despawning was a potential problem we dealt with loot surprisingly quickly (see end) and pulled this next chap: <br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/exiledfight.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/exiledfight.bmp" border="0"><br><br>Again, he was about on par with your average xp mob in difficulty, but whatcha gonna do. Well, we did this: <br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/deadexiled.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/deadexiled.bmp" border="0"><br><br>It's too bad that these guys are so hard to find up, cause the fights themselves are actually rather enjoyable, and the loot is not too shabby, as the following shows:<br><br>Jorgurdar got:<br><br><img src="http://www.ashborne.org/images/taintedscalebelt.bmp" alt="http://www.ashborne.org/images/taintedscalebelt.bmp" border="0"><br><br>Finnan got: <br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jadeskullring.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jadeskullring.bmp" border="0"><br><br>Beatdrop got: <br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/corruptedskullearring.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/corruptedskullearring.bmp" border="0"><br><br>Archemil got: <br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/scorchedsilverpauldrons.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/scorchedsilverpauldrons.bmp" border="0"><br><br>Both Aella and Tkiami nabbed: <br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/hammerofthesun.bmp" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/hammerofthesun.bmp" border="0"><br><br>Not the best of the loot tables, but certainly not the worst. All in all it was time well spent. Sadly, our first attempt at the Cursed did not go so well. We were hurt by lacking a few key classes, but still made a noteworthy first try. Next time we see him(hopefully that occurs within the next millenium) he dies. Now, we could have gotten him on the respawn, but between GM's repoping the zone for... "questionable"..... reasons, and Verant's inability to have a stable first try at a patch, we were forced to wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait for the trigger mobs to come back up. Eventually we were defeated by the most sinsiter of foes: sleep.<br><br>Thats the story on a good fight.

(yeah! yeah!)<br><br>Also, people are deciding we like killing vindi again. past few days have seen him go down pretty fast (hmm.... Black Knight references prolly work here better dont they.....). Anyway, notable loot has been Silani and Peligro both getting: <br><img src="http://www.ashborne.org/images/vindibp.bmp" alt="http://www.ashborne.org/images/vindibp.bmp" border="0"><br><br>Well, there's the news.
