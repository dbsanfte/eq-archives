<tr><td><B><A NAME="1060043805"><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="4" FACE="arial">Sol Ro, Seru & Stuff</b><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="2" FACE="arial"> - <A HREF="mailto:wth5@georgetown.edu">Belhothar</A> @ 4:36 pm PST<br>Lemme preface this (as I am wont to do) by saying that for a really long time know I've had an awesome idea for how to do the update for when we first killed seru. News junkies like myself no doubt remember the furor (pun intended) that FoH's serverwide first killing of Seru caused. I've always been rather partial to FoH's accomplishments, and when they update their news it's generally a fun read. So, partly in parody, partly in homage, I had planned to basically copy Furor's "I threw some really rediculous numbers at my clerics, and they threw some equally rediculous numbers back at me"... yadda yadda yaddda. Then I had it all planned out to que forward to where we are today and make a self depricating comment to the affect of: 'oh well, only 15 months late! ;)'<br><br>BUT (and it's a big butt)<br><br>due to my sorry attempts at actually having a real life, I personally was unable to attend the Seru kill, my own fault, whatcha gonna do. However, I DID ask many times for people to take frikken screenshots and send them in. However, in a lament that is all too frequent on news boards everywhere, my so called friends, decided to not send them in. So, instead of the update of a lifetime, yer all stuck reading just some mindless ramblings.... maybe that'll teach ya all!!<br><br>Loot was pretty sweet:<br>Grumblenuts: Sleeves<br>Samathrace: Ring<br>Gertrude: Veil<br>Ancient Concussion: Muntho<br><br>So, like, we'll be back, and maybe I'll have a picture for you all next time.<br><br>But first lets back up to saturday, and the real impetus for this update. AA killed SolRo baby! Pretty dern sweet, eh? Ok, so it's a forgone conclusion that once you kill RZ you'll be able to kill that wimp that so many delusional wizards follow instead of the true god Karana... but hey, it still opens up Fire and gives pretty schweet lewtz, so let me be happy in my feigned ignorance.<br><br>Some pictures for the drooling masses who can't read (did you know that the average news paper is written to a 6th grade reading level, as that's all the general public can comprehend? And that even the more *until recently* high brow publications are only published to an 8th grade reading level?..... maybe there are more of you droolers out there than I give credit too)<br><br>Here's the two faced sunofabiotch standing around, waiting for us to kill him:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solroalive.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solroalive.jpg" border="0"><br><br>after one of our more interesting starts to an encounter, we regrouped, tried again, and figured out that we should put our super-duper-triple-uber midget tank on him. Kinster, we salute you. If you look closely you can just pick him out below SolRo's staff<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solrofight.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solrofight.jpg" border="0"><br><br>A truly uneventful fight lead to the following, oh, so pretty picture:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solrodead.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/solrodead.jpg" border="0"><br><br>It's oh-so sweet because that nice lil orb went to nice lil me! mwahahahahaha<br>if you hadnt figured it out, loot was:<br>Orb- Belhothar<br>Cloak- Delluna<br><br>oh, and I'll do a little public service announcement here. If in the future you kill solro for your first time, dont worry about hopping in the lava, just hail the projection and you get flagged. No reason for people to stress about it, and it's not like this is a 1337 s7|247 that I'm giving away, just trying to be nice.<br><br>So, anyhoo, all fire flagged I did this:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/infire.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/infire.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Always fun to go into new zones, and fire sure looks like it holds a lot of promise. (of course 7 EP guilds on one server... ugh, but then, why just go to negative stuffs, lets be positive! or so I'm told)<br><br>Anyway, because I'd rather be playing than typing, here's one last gem for you all. A little bit of evidence as to why druids are as screwed up as they are:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/potpic.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/potpic.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Until next time, thats the News from Norrath.

I guess I owe all our loyal readers (they're out there, I'm sure) an explanation. Basically, it's I have a life (/shudder) and it took over for a while. Between school ending, a job starting, and no internet connection at my new house, it was pretty darn challenging to actually get all the pieces in once place to do an update. Add to that the fact that these slackers really didnt do a whole lot in my absence, and you get a news page thats frighteningly devoid of any updates. But, well, we're back in the swing of things, and my job is winding down, so maybe I can get back to updating this on a more regular basis.<br><br>continuing on with the EQ related matter....<br><br>We killed RZ. yes, yes we did, it's on the bkk, you can see it for yourselves (in fact, thats prolly how you got to this page, so you prolly did see it for yourself). As of now, the official score card reads: AA:2, RZ: sheer PWNAGE. Ya, he killed us a lot. I mean a ton, and honestly, most of those times were our own faults, but hey, in the end we can present to the world our own personal screenshot of RZ's corpse:<br><br>{insert own personal screenshot of RZ's corpse whenever someone sends it to me here}<br><br>Not content with just killing him once (and plus the flagging was predictably messy the first time) we present you with an exclusive, never before seen, SECOND screenshot of RZ's corpse.<br><br>{insert what will probably be the exact same picture of RZ, whenever someone sends it to me}<br><br>So, yap, the big boy do be down, and I can invision a steady supply of RZ corpses to follow. Loot has been especially good. So far it's been:<br>Blade of War 3x: Acana, Kinster, Nyle<br>Grimfaced Visor: Dball<br><br>(I'll put in pics for the loot whenever I get mob ones, it's just annoying to do, and I wanna actually get in game ;p)<br><br>Wanting to be the first AA person to get into an EP, I hurried off after getting flagged, finished up my hailings (thanks for useless lore that I've seen already for the past, what now, 6 months? if we all know Dro is just gonna make us forget quarm, at a certain point, why have flag mobs keep repeating the same lore over and over and over and over again?) and then scurried over to air to present you with this:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/zoneair.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/zoneair.jpg" border="0"><br><br>yep, sure many other people have done it, but you all gotta admit there's a certain special rush from doing it yourself. I'm pretty sure Gello'dar holds the distinction of being the first to die in the EPs, water to be specific. Of course, I shouldnt laugh, since I followed quickly after him (I was actuallying /rofl-ing over his corpse, when the same mobs killed me. sad, so sad).<br><br>Here are a few anonymous pictures of EP fights, they're pretty cool, with, what are at least at first glance, interesting mechanics to them:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/peregrinring.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/peregrinring.jpg" border="0"><br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/airfight.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/airfight.jpg" border="0"><br><br>yap, cool lookin mobs in general, and the zones are nice too. maybe its just me, but I also really like the music in earth , and air's is at least subtle enough that you dont have to turn it off to retain your sanity.<br><br>Last night there was a minor air romp, sadly there was a wipe pretty early (aka 12:45 am) and I had to wake up in like 5 hours for work, so I dont have pics or really any details from it, but loot was dern spiffy with:<br>Symbol of the Swirling Maelstrongx2-Kellmourn, Nasham<br>Sparkling Shortsword - Dball<br>Exquisite Leather Cap - Giovannii<br>Scintillating Feather Mask - Javonthalas<br>(again, loot pics when I get mob pics)<br><br>so, it seems that there really are mobs up in the planes, a nice touch. <br><br>Not sure if it's because it's friday, or that I havnt gotten nearly enough sleep lately, or what, but I'm really just not feeling witty at the moment, so gonna rap this up pretty fast (although I want to say I've got a rather clever allusion [one or two l's on that one?] for the next update), so, um, ya, that's it for me.<br><br>That's the news from Norrath, until next time, I'm Belhothar Ulthuran, and that's news to me!</FONT></FONT><br></td></tr>

Then WTF were we doing up two nights in a row in SolRo's tower till 5am and 6:30 respectively? I dunno, but dam the loot was good! Oh, wait, no it wasnt! Go to VT, loot there is amazing! I'm serious, GEAR UP IN VT FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN! PoP fights are just too hard!<br><br>So, one would think that after about 4 years of the game being up the servers would be more stable than these past few days would indicate. Basically was 3 patches in 3 days, and we took advantage of it! I'm pretty sure it has gone: Marr + Solro on tuesday, Zeks + Solro on wednesday, Zeks + Agnarr + Solro on thursday.... weren't we the ones complaining no one left anything up in PoP just a little bit ago?<br><br>So for tuesday, here are some pics. Mainly, I just want to back up my previous assertion that Marr is, in fact a hippy:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/hippymarr.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/hippymarr.jpg" border="0"><br><br>See, in that pic Marr's so high that he's literally swimming in the clouds. You'd have to be a hippy to get that high! We had a few problems MTing him to start, got our act together, kept Kinster alive long enough so that when he turned and killed 20+ ppl on enrage (gg on agro! /em wtb taunting weapons for our warriors, seriously, its a testament to their abilities that we kill anything!) we were still able to salvage it and get that lovely Gello'Dar killshot from the previous update.<br><br>Loot was Snakeyes with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/marrbow.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/marrbow.jpg" border="0"><br><br>and Kellmourn with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/marrbelt.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/marrbelt.jpg" border="0"><br><br>That finished up a fair amount of flags, and so we hopped over to Solro and waxed Jiva, and um, I forget what else, coulda just been jiva, anyway SolRo's getting its own section later.<br><br>Flash forward to the next day, servers went down or something, I forget what, so we're like, ok, lets kill stuff again! Marr was being engaged, too bad, though I wont cry at losing him, he's tough, and there's easier loot out there. The easiest being the two baby zeks. We dropped Vallon, wiped to tallon (stupid impossible to manage agro fight. Then we managed to go afk for 2 hours while rallying for Agnarr. He's been a punk for us, and we've never made it past the second mini in his cycle due mainly to just bad luck, and, of course, the occasional (read 2-3 per attempt) bonehead moves. So, we had a lot of people from Tallon who were hungry for revenge, and we threw them at the encounter. MASSIVELY screwed up on the second mini, again, tried valiantly for 10-15 mins to pull a win out of our corpses, but in the end couldnt do it. We figured out what we needed to do fortunately, and knew we could do it the next day. We then moved on to SolRo for a loooooooong night. Got Jiva again, then Rizlona at 4:50, 10 mins before the servers went down. Loot from that day was: <br><br>Braeryan + Noyes with this from Vallon:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/vallonbelt.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/vallonbelt.jpg" border="0"><br><br>There was, about a year or so ago, an update on the Legacy of Steel website that really rang true for me over the past two days. In it, Tigole talked about going from the "week of suck" to the "night of own." Well, since we lost to tallon, agnarr, and my rizlona earring poofed cause of the server going down, I was, despite a pretty good day, identifying rather heavily with the "week of suck" analogy, and will therefore label wednesday, april 30 the "Night of Suck". Fortunately, we followed it up with thursday, may 1 the "Night of PWN!"<br><br>Started out on the baby zeks, doing Vallon with like 30 people and feeling very zergish while doing it. Not that free loot aint fun, and I realize this isnt the place for a Furor-esque "Tune the PoFire/Water mini's now!" rant, but seriously. If they paid attention, 6 people could kill Vallon. But who am I to complain.<br><br>Loot was Diashan with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/vallonneck.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/vallonneck.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Braeryan as the only non-bot cleric with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/furioushammerofzek.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/furioushammerofzek.jpg" border="0"><br><br>moved over to Tallon, for whom I wanted to use the "dingdin holds agro" strat, but was overruled. We just killed him more slowly, but also more surely, and he fell for us this time, revenging last nights patheticness.<br><br>Loot was Elvon with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tallonbow.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tallonbow.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Guinness with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tallonfist.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tallonfist.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Then, since Marr was again engaged, but Agnarr was left up, we moved on over to him. This time, we basically tucked our.... "egos"...... between our legs, and did the second mini relatively flawlessly. We checked out Agnarr's room (bind sight r teh wIn!) figured out what was going to happen, then ported up. Oh, wait, no we didnt! cause the port up required a different mechanic than the other ones, so the flawless entry and kill we were going for was fubar'd. Even losing our first 2 MTs basically immediately, we got our fecal matter together, and beat the stormlord's rear parts back into oblivion. Some pretty pictures for the reading challenged:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrfight.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrfight.jpg" border="0"><br><br>cant say this quickly turned into the following pick, but slow and steady wins the race, right?<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrdead.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrdead.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Karana then gave flags for everyone! no pic, cause he looks just like agnarr, and there's enough bandwith in this update anyway. (oh, and anyone remember my "too many 'r's in PoP name rant? well agnaRR.. 2 of em. not needed..... a SOE dev have a girl/boy friend who's name is roryrney rocright? seriously, 'r' fetish or something)<br><br>Loot was Strongboww with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrbow.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrbow.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Gingerkin with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrorb.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrorb.jpg" border="0"><br><br>so, like, sweet! one more mob (albiet the hard one) till elemental planes!<br><br>Then, back to our favorite "we must farm as much as possible till other people can get in" zone: Tower of Sol Ro. Started out on Protector of Dresolik, sorry, no pics, but dam, they stuff enough mobs between you and him? Prot's loot was 'eh' and kinda sorta had to be forced onto people, thats not to say they didnt love it and we're all thrilled to death (prot more than others) that it dropped, but, seriously, better loot plzkkthnx next time:<br><br>Xeliar got:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/protdagger.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/protdagger.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Celestialis got:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/protsphere.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/protsphere.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Then, starting at 4:30 am (wtf were we thinking? ok, well, we wanted more ph47z 13|/\|7z I guess) we went over to Jiva. Here's what we had to fight through:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivatower.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivatower.jpg" border="0"><br><br>well, we did, and killed him. commentary to come after the picture:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivadead.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivadead.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Now, if you look carefully you can see that sonson and jiva are engaged in a rather akward position. Basically, I think sonson was paying Jiva back for stiffing (ouch, bad pun) felinea on not dropping a bo staff. But I guess it's all up to artistic interpretation.<br><br>Net Jiva loot after 3 killings has been Blumpkin, Kinster, Latryzia with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivaring.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivaring.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Galestorm, Sonson with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivastaff.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivastaff.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Nyle with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivasword.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivasword.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Then, with the sun rising, we went to sleep (good god man, could they keep us up any longer? ;p) Ummm... dont have pics of the Riz loot from wednesday, one because Snake's sweet shoulders are tough to find a pic of, and 2 because my <insert massive stream of explitives> poofed and wont be returned /sigh, so I'm not gonna salt my wound by showing you how cool I COULD HAVE BEEN. Pretty sure that brings the rest of the world up to date on what we've been doing. We're happy, and I'll end with a all time great movie quote: "I love winning man! I love it! You hear what I'm saying? It's like better than losing?!" bonus points to anyone who PMs me, posts, or in any way shows they know where that came from. I'll be outta game for about a month, so updates might be sporadic.<br><br>Until next time, thats the News from Norrath (did I steal NfN from valoran? dont remember), I'm Belhothar Ulthuran, and that's news to me!</FONT></FONT><br></td></tr>
