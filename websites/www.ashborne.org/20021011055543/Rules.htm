<font size="3"><strong>Rule 1)</strong> We rule, we know we rule, end of story.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Rule 2)</strong> Play your main character.&nbsp;
Alternates are great but we are all here to contribute to our family here and Alts don't
help the guild much.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Rule 3)</strong> Invitations will be handled by
guild officers.&nbsp; If you have someone you want to sponsor for membership post their
names under the membership forum and have them contact Vyktor in game.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Rule 4)</strong> No member will ever exploit or use
a bug in the game for their own advantage.&nbsp; Anyone who does so will not only be
/guildremove'd but will be reported by all members of the guild.</font></p>
