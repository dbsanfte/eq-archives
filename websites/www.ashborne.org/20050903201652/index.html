The Ashborne Alliance is a long-gone concept, but the domain will be here for a while.  The forums remain for those of the Ashborne Alliance community who still visit them, and I will keep them up as long as there is a desire.  The rest of the site I havent completely decided what to do with yet.  It's entirely possible that I will turn it into a blog site or a place to store various things I have written, in addition to other things of interest.  This means that most of you will want to change your bookmarks to point directly to the forums.

For the time being, here is a link to the forums:
