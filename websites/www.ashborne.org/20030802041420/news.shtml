I guess I owe all our loyal readers (they're out there, I'm sure) an explanation. Basically, it's I have a life (/shudder) and it took over for a while. Between school ending, a job starting, and no internet connection at my new house, it was pretty darn challenging to actually get all the pieces in once place to do an update. Add to that the fact that these slackers really didnt do a whole lot in my absence, and you get a news page thats frighteningly devoid of any updates. But, well, we're back in the swing of things, and my job is winding down, so maybe I can get back to updating this on a more regular basis.<br><br>continuing on with the EQ related matter....<br><br>We killed RZ. yes, yes we did, it's on the bkk, you can see it for yourselves (in fact, thats prolly how you got to this page, so you prolly did see it for yourself). As of now, the official score card reads: AA:2, RZ: sheer PWNAGE. Ya, he killed us a lot. I mean a ton, and honestly, most of those times were our own faults, but hey, in the end we can present to the world our own personal screenshot of RZ's corpse:<br><br>{insert own personal screenshot of RZ's corpse whenever someone sends it to me here}<br><br>Not content with just killing him once (and plus the flagging was predictably messy the first time) we present you with an exclusive, never before seen, SECOND screenshot of RZ's corpse.<br><br>{insert what will probably be the exact same picture of RZ, whenever someone sends it to me}<br><br>So, yap, the big boy do be down, and I can invision a steady supply of RZ corpses to follow. Loot has been especially good. So far it's been:<br>Blade of War 3x: Acana, Kinster, Nyle<br>Grimfaced Visor: Dball<br><br>(I'll put in pics for the loot whenever I get mob ones, it's just annoying to do, and I wanna actually get in game ;p)<br><br>Wanting to be the first AA person to get into an EP, I hurried off after getting flagged, finished up my hailings (thanks for useless lore that I've seen already for the past, what now, 6 months? if we all know Dro is just gonna make us forget quarm, at a certain point, why have flag mobs keep repeating the same lore over and over and over and over again?) and then scurried over to air to present you with this:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/zoneair.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/zoneair.jpg" border="0"><br><br>yep, sure many other people have done it, but you all gotta admit there's a certain special rush from doing it yourself. I'm pretty sure Gello'dar holds the distinction of being the first to die in the EPs, water to be specific. Of course, I shouldnt laugh, since I followed quickly after him (I was actuallying /rofl-ing over his corpse, when the same mobs killed me. sad, so sad).<br><br>Here are a few anonymous pictures of EP fights, they're pretty cool, with, what are at least at first glance, interesting mechanics to them:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/peregrinring.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/peregrinring.jpg" border="0"><br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/airfight.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/airfight.jpg" border="0"><br><br>yap, cool lookin mobs in general, and the zones are nice too. maybe its just me, but I also really like the music in earth , and air's is at least subtle enough that you dont have to turn it off to retain your sanity.<br><br>Last night there was a minor air romp, sadly there was a wipe pretty early (aka 12:45 am) and I had to wake up in like 5 hours for work, so I dont have pics or really any details from it, but loot was dern spiffy with:<br>Symbol of the Swirling Maelstrongx2-Kellmourn, Nasham<br>Sparkling Shortsword - Dball<br>Exquisite Leather Cap - Giovannii<br>Scintillating Feather Mask - Javonthalas<br>(again, loot pics when I get mob pics)<br><br>so, it seems that there really are mobs up in the planes, a nice touch. <br><br>Not sure if it's because it's friday, or that I havnt gotten nearly enough sleep lately, or what, but I'm really just not feeling witty at the moment, so gonna rap this up pretty fast (although I want to say I've got a rather clever allusion [one or two l's on that one?] for the next update), so, um, ya, that's it for me.<br><br>That's the news from Norrath, until next time, I'm Belhothar Ulthuran, and that's news to me!</FONT></FONT><br></td></tr>

Then WTF were we doing up two nights in a row in SolRo's tower till 5am and 6:30 respectively? I dunno, but dam the loot was good! Oh, wait, no it wasnt! Go to VT, loot there is amazing! I'm serious, GEAR UP IN VT FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN! PoP fights are just too hard!<br><br>So, one would think that after about 4 years of the game being up the servers would be more stable than these past few days would indicate. Basically was 3 patches in 3 days, and we took advantage of it! I'm pretty sure it has gone: Marr + Solro on tuesday, Zeks + Solro on wednesday, Zeks + Agnarr + Solro on thursday.... weren't we the ones complaining no one left anything up in PoP just a little bit ago?<br><br>So for tuesday, here are some pics. Mainly, I just want to back up my previous assertion that Marr is, in fact a hippy:<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/hippymarr.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/hippymarr.jpg" border="0"><br><br>See, in that pic Marr's so high that he's literally swimming in the clouds. You'd have to be a hippy to get that high! We had a few problems MTing him to start, got our act together, kept Kinster alive long enough so that when he turned and killed 20+ ppl on enrage (gg on agro! /em wtb taunting weapons for our warriors, seriously, its a testament to their abilities that we kill anything!) we were still able to salvage it and get that lovely Gello'Dar killshot from the previous update.<br><br>Loot was Snakeyes with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/marrbow.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/marrbow.jpg" border="0"><br><br>and Kellmourn with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/marrbelt.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/marrbelt.jpg" border="0"><br><br>That finished up a fair amount of flags, and so we hopped over to Solro and waxed Jiva, and um, I forget what else, coulda just been jiva, anyway SolRo's getting its own section later.<br><br>Flash forward to the next day, servers went down or something, I forget what, so we're like, ok, lets kill stuff again! Marr was being engaged, too bad, though I wont cry at losing him, he's tough, and there's easier loot out there. The easiest being the two baby zeks. We dropped Vallon, wiped to tallon (stupid impossible to manage agro fight. Then we managed to go afk for 2 hours while rallying for Agnarr. He's been a punk for us, and we've never made it past the second mini in his cycle due mainly to just bad luck, and, of course, the occasional (read 2-3 per attempt) bonehead moves. So, we had a lot of people from Tallon who were hungry for revenge, and we threw them at the encounter. MASSIVELY screwed up on the second mini, again, tried valiantly for 10-15 mins to pull a win out of our corpses, but in the end couldnt do it. We figured out what we needed to do fortunately, and knew we could do it the next day. We then moved on to SolRo for a loooooooong night. Got Jiva again, then Rizlona at 4:50, 10 mins before the servers went down. Loot from that day was: <br><br>Braeryan + Noyes with this from Vallon:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/vallonbelt.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/vallonbelt.jpg" border="0"><br><br>There was, about a year or so ago, an update on the Legacy of Steel website that really rang true for me over the past two days. In it, Tigole talked about going from the "week of suck" to the "night of own." Well, since we lost to tallon, agnarr, and my rizlona earring poofed cause of the server going down, I was, despite a pretty good day, identifying rather heavily with the "week of suck" analogy, and will therefore label wednesday, april 30 the "Night of Suck". Fortunately, we followed it up with thursday, may 1 the "Night of PWN!"<br><br>Started out on the baby zeks, doing Vallon with like 30 people and feeling very zergish while doing it. Not that free loot aint fun, and I realize this isnt the place for a Furor-esque "Tune the PoFire/Water mini's now!" rant, but seriously. If they paid attention, 6 people could kill Vallon. But who am I to complain.<br><br>Loot was Diashan with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/vallonneck.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/vallonneck.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Braeryan as the only non-bot cleric with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/furioushammerofzek.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/furioushammerofzek.jpg" border="0"><br><br>moved over to Tallon, for whom I wanted to use the "dingdin holds agro" strat, but was overruled. We just killed him more slowly, but also more surely, and he fell for us this time, revenging last nights patheticness.<br><br>Loot was Elvon with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tallonbow.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tallonbow.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Guinness with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tallonfist.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tallonfist.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Then, since Marr was again engaged, but Agnarr was left up, we moved on over to him. This time, we basically tucked our.... "egos"...... between our legs, and did the second mini relatively flawlessly. We checked out Agnarr's room (bind sight r teh wIn!) figured out what was going to happen, then ported up. Oh, wait, no we didnt! cause the port up required a different mechanic than the other ones, so the flawless entry and kill we were going for was fubar'd. Even losing our first 2 MTs basically immediately, we got our fecal matter together, and beat the stormlord's rear parts back into oblivion. Some pretty pictures for the reading challenged:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrfight.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrfight.jpg" border="0"><br><br>cant say this quickly turned into the following pick, but slow and steady wins the race, right?<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrdead.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrdead.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Karana then gave flags for everyone! no pic, cause he looks just like agnarr, and there's enough bandwith in this update anyway. (oh, and anyone remember my "too many 'r's in PoP name rant? well agnaRR.. 2 of em. not needed..... a SOE dev have a girl/boy friend who's name is roryrney rocright? seriously, 'r' fetish or something)<br><br>Loot was Strongboww with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrbow.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrbow.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Gingerkin with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrorb.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/agnarrorb.jpg" border="0"><br><br>so, like, sweet! one more mob (albiet the hard one) till elemental planes!<br><br>Then, back to our favorite "we must farm as much as possible till other people can get in" zone: Tower of Sol Ro. Started out on Protector of Dresolik, sorry, no pics, but dam, they stuff enough mobs between you and him? Prot's loot was 'eh' and kinda sorta had to be forced onto people, thats not to say they didnt love it and we're all thrilled to death (prot more than others) that it dropped, but, seriously, better loot plzkkthnx next time:<br><br>Xeliar got:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/protdagger.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/protdagger.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Celestialis got:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/protsphere.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/protsphere.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Then, starting at 4:30 am (wtf were we thinking? ok, well, we wanted more ph47z 13|/\|7z I guess) we went over to Jiva. Here's what we had to fight through:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivatower.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivatower.jpg" border="0"><br><br>well, we did, and killed him. commentary to come after the picture:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivadead.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivadead.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Now, if you look carefully you can see that sonson and jiva are engaged in a rather akward position. Basically, I think sonson was paying Jiva back for stiffing (ouch, bad pun) felinea on not dropping a bo staff. But I guess it's all up to artistic interpretation.<br><br>Net Jiva loot after 3 killings has been Blumpkin, Kinster, Latryzia with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivaring.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivaring.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Galestorm, Sonson with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivastaff.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivastaff.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Nyle with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivasword.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/jivasword.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Then, with the sun rising, we went to sleep (good god man, could they keep us up any longer? ;p) Ummm... dont have pics of the Riz loot from wednesday, one because Snake's sweet shoulders are tough to find a pic of, and 2 because my <insert massive stream of explitives> poofed and wont be returned /sigh, so I'm not gonna salt my wound by showing you how cool I COULD HAVE BEEN. Pretty sure that brings the rest of the world up to date on what we've been doing. We're happy, and I'll end with a all time great movie quote: "I love winning man! I love it! You hear what I'm saying? It's like better than losing?!" bonus points to anyone who PMs me, posts, or in any way shows they know where that came from. I'll be outta game for about a month, so updates might be sporadic.<br><br>Until next time, thats the News from Norrath (did I steal NfN from valoran? dont remember), I'm Belhothar Ulthuran, and that's news to me!</FONT></FONT><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><B><A NAME="1050434715"><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="4" FACE="arial">Marr is TOAST!!! OOOOHHHHHH YEEEEAAAHHHH!!!!</b><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="2" FACE="arial"> - <A HREF="mailto:wth5@georgetown.edu">Belhothar</A> @ 11:25 am PST<br>First things first: Lord Mithaniel Marr, Grand Poo-Bah of Paladins, Chief God of Froggies, Macho Man Randy Savage Look Alike, and general all around Slim Jim, has been killed by the Ashborne Alliance! Two words: OOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH YEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!<br><br>so now to the explainations, intrigues, and fun things to read.<br><br>So we've been on a pretty serious roll recently, killing lots of mobs. Even if some of those mobs are from one or even two expansions ago (Tunare, Shei) the loot is still pretty dern good, and worth the time to go kill these guys (ok, no one LIKES clearing PoG, but honestly, everyone can at some point remember when the loot, and the utility it brings to your guild/alliance really WAS worth the time and annoyance of that pita of a zone). <br><br>At the same time, we've been doing pretty decently in PoP as well. As the past two updates show, we've killd Rydda'Dar, and Bertoxxulous (ref. previous discussion on majorly annoying spelling of names in PoP). Since then we've also managed to drop the free bags of loot that are the lower Zeks (Tallon and Vallon). I dont know about anyone else, but when I see these guys I'm always reminded of old, cheesy Kung Fu movies, where the voice overs are just sooo out of whack with the actors, and some rediculous stunts. Of course, some of the bad guys in those movies could actually put up a fight, unlike these two (oh, wait.... NM!! these two are BEASTS!!! dont bother going after them unless you have 80+ in your raid force!). Seriously though, Vallon was such a joke that we were actually doing CR while he was engaged, started wiping for real, and decided to just turn the 14ish people left against him, while he was at about 40%, and he died. It was just funny. We woulda killed him flawlessly in our most recent attempt, but for a variety of circumstances (all of which I can explain btw) I managed to die to him, ruining our perfect run, sue me.<br><br>Ok, so basically what I'm getting at is that we had actually managed to accumulate all the flags we'd need so that Marr was the last thing standing between us and Sol Ro's Tower, where the women are made of fire, and the loot rains, like, well, umm, something good! Of course, it was not this easy cause VI/SOE (or whatever they are these days) in their wisdom has made Marr respawn 7 days to the INSTANT after he was last killed. This obviously makes it very easy to control one spawn and keep all of Sol Tower to ones selves. Now I'm not gonna point fingers, or even say that I wouldnt do the same if given the opportunity (a free uncontested zone would be fun!) but lets just say we were getting pretty annoyed at having 0 chance at killing Marr.<br><br>Moving right along..... the most recent patch has royally fubar'd lots of the game (check out www.fohguild.org for a truly enjoyable rant about this aspect) and so the servers are coming down a lot to try and fix things. Much to our delight, this ment that when the servers came back up durring the late afternoon yesterday, we had the opportunity to surmount the last hurdle in our path. So, we started gathering, and other guilds were extremely gracious (no tounge in cheek here, 100% thankful to other folks for not being a pain) and when we had enough numbers they bowed out. <br><br>Knowing that numbers make life easier, and that we could use all 72 flags that would come from Marr's pp (thats planar projection for all you lollards out there), we actually accumulated over 80 people on line at one point. So we buffed up (thnx finally being able to mgb it all, soooo nice) and started clearing in. Someone somewhere had said that his big froggie was a beast, so I relayed the idea, we were ready, he was a wansy. That was basically the story of the initial clearing intowards Marr, although dont worry, we definitely managed to die enough to slow it down.<br><br>We finally get into Marr's room talk about how we want to fight him, figure things out, try to move to a better spot and subsequently get trained by about 10+ mobs... it was short, it was brutal, we all died. Now, you might have read on other guilds news pages about how HUGE a pita it is to CR in HoHb. All I can say is that you cant really appreciate the magnitude of the problem until you do it. There are mobs literally sitting in the middle of the graveyard, making rezing a very delicate process which, of course, we managed to screw up. Basically CR took roughly 2 hours, and it was getting pretty late by the time we were fully rebuffed. <br><br>Fortunately, re-clearing was a cakewalk, since we didnt have the (very) mini-bosses to kill, and in pretty much no time we were back in Marr's room. Like I'd said, we knew the 'how' of killing him, so it was just putting that 'how' into practice. Considering its basically on SH about how to deal with him, all I'll say is that it would make a NToV raid leader turn in their grave, see pic. Amazingly, we killed him with very few deaths (MT, me riding the agro limit (or so I'll say) fell after 1st MT... very few others) and we killed him on the first ever actual pull, pretty nifty, huh? ;)<br><br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/deadmarr2.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/deadmarr2.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Now, you might have gotten the wrong impression from Acana's news post about the Bert kill, and her saying that it was the first decent melee loot that we'd seen in all of PoP. Well, that might very well be true (I only pretend to be an expert on melee items ;p), but I can without a doubt say that PoP has been EXTREMELY stingy to our int casters. To the point that many of us had not looted a single piece of PoP loot beyond single group encounters. So we were all joking about the.... 'stuff'.... he was going to drop. Needless to say, it was our jaws that dropped when loot was announced as:<br><br>2x Gemstone Choker (which must be a recent addition, cause for the life of me I cant find a linkable screenshot anywhere!!!)<br>stats are:<br>Neck 15ac 10sta 20int/agi 85hp 135mana 15FR/CR/MR FT4<br>needless to say a VERY nice item. Grats Muntho and Belhothar (ie. me, woot!) on these two beauties!<br><br>wow, this is long, and so was last night, so keep going!<br><br>So now that Marr was down we figured it might not be a terrible idea to add a few more flags needed to acces Sol Ro's Tower. Tallon was up, and at an ungodly hour of the night we headed over there... He managed to die at about 3:30.<br><br>**edit**<br>took out picture to make reading easier, you've all seen him dead anyway<br>**edit**<br><br>Loot was:<br>knok with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tallon'swarcharm.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/tallon'swarcharm.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Belazae with:<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/visorofendlesssight.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/visorofendlesssight.jpg" border="0"><br><br>At which point everyone was falling over dead tired, swearing that they were all going to sleep, when Tirrm said something to the effect of, "dont hate me, but: Vallon Zek." At this point, some people went to sleep (curse you!). Others of us decided, 'screw it, we aint gettin no sleep anyway, lets kill ourselves another god!' So we obediently headed over to VZ, and beat the high-holy-heck outta him! We laughed, we cried, it was better than Cats.<br>Loot was:<br><br>Dingdin (I think there are like 2 AA pallies without this thing after only 3 killings)<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/resplendentwarmaul.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/resplendentwarmaul.jpg" border="0"><br><br>Gello (which if you know him, really is a perfect match ;p)<br><img src="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/furioushammerofzek.jpg" alt="Http://www.ashborne.org/images/furioushammerofzek.jpg" border="0"><br><br>So, to sum up, it was a crazy day, night, and early morning of killing, which came to an end at 5am est... no one got any sleep last night, but I bet they'd all say it was worth it! Sol Ro's Tower here we come!<br><br>Keeping this in for historical accuracy, but I have recieved enough pictures to make it worth while, have fun with the pretty colors! (One last note, I wasnt able to get screenshots of most of the fights, and didnt feel like only putting them in for the Zek's loot, but when someone sends it to me I can add in da pwetty pictures for all you reading impared tanks out there)<br><br>Thats the news from Norrath, I'm Belhothar Ulthuran, and that's news to me! </FONT></FONT><br></td></tr>
