It is not part of my memory nor is it part of who I am. World Trade Center II is how I will always remember the endless glass building that towered over the nocturnal city and reached far into the sky. <br><br>*****<br>It’s hard not to feel used and dispensed of so quickly. I had waited 19 years for my first kiss and my first boyfriend had made me regret every moment. Not because he cheated on me; No, that would have made things easier for me. I would call him an asshole and move on. I wept at our parting for all the true emotions that he had evoked within me and how deeply he had tunneled into my heart. And while I grieved inside quietly, he quickly replaced me with one girl after another. The same lips that had once told me why he was so enamored by me now criticized every word that traveled through the phone lines. And just as quickly as I had fallen for him, he stopped falling for me. <br>	I can’t help but question the validity of our relationship. Was it built solely on sand? Perhaps it was. The shambles that lay in front of me cannot be pieced back together into what once was for I do not know what form it had previously taken. Glass shards with jagged edges are spread across the path in front of me as I place my foot one in front of another, slowly making my way through. Just as I turn my back to look at the clear pieces glinting behind me, I continue with a false sense of security only to feel the sharp edges of those small pieces that can barely be seen but manage to sink even deeper into your skin. <br><br>*****<br>My uncle bled to death on the floor of a 7 11. Long Island, New York: conventional suburbia. The residents like to think they’re “New Yorkers” but personally, I believe that is a term limited to those who reside in the five boroughs. Maybe he was just another Asian man in America trying to make enough money to support his family regardless of what the job entailed but his death was not one of most men his age. <br>7 11. I wonder if people would read his profession and consider it to be a demeaning job. An occupation of high school drop outs perhaps. And in a way, it best shows the extent to which our family had suffered financially and to an even greater extent the love my uncle had for his wife and two children. <br>He didn’t officially die in the 7 11 but in all honesty, that is where his life ended. For a week, he laid in the hospital bed, breathing through a tube with every minute of his life depending on an electronic device that made his body twitch every few moments giving my heart a jump each time in false hope.<br>My aunt clung to him as they wheeled his body out one last time before he would save four lives in sacrificing his own. Sacrifice: it was what he did best and yet I wonder if it is a sacrifice he made. He was given no choice when a young intoxicated twenty four year old kid decided to attack him inside the convenience store. My aunt made the sacrifice in signing the papers but even she had no choice when the doctors told her there was no brain activity and they would have to pull the plug. My cousins had no choice in any of these matters; they watched with tears in their eyes and their lives in shambles. But I would like to think he did make the choice. His organs saved more lives because we knew that was what he wanted. It was his spirit that sacrificed every last ounce of his body on earth.<br>My parents, my sister, my two cousins, my aunt and I make up the family. There are seven of us now: an odd number. <br>	<br>*****<br>Blocks away from Stuyvesant high school, the seven buildings which made up the world trade center were a ten minute walking distance away, or one stop in the 1/9 train if it was a cold day. The 1/9 would stop under the two main twin towers which housed the food as well as shopping area, near the newly built Sephora and across from the not so new Gap. <br>	The E train station was near the street entrance as well as Tower 5, surrounded by food establishments such as Sbarro’s and Mrs. Fields. On opposite right hand corner from the E train station entrance, the tiny Ben and Jerry’s stand tempted all those who entered the glass revolving doors into Tower Two, stock brokers in navy suits, red ties and leather brief cases as well as tourists wearing light blue jeans and Hard Rock Café t-shirts with cameras hanging from their shoulders. The tourists, most who mistakenly went to the security desk on the right side, would be told to go up the middle escalator which was meant for those who wanted to climb to the top of these gigantic buildings and look down upon the city. Those who worked in the building would swipe the security pass, greet the security guard if they were courteous enough, and walk into either of two sets of elevator, depending on which floor they wanted to go. <br>On the 73rd floor, I rarely noticed the amazing view unless it was an especially foggy day that clung to the windows and darkened the floor. The brokers in the cubicles switched around and rarely would the same faces be seen for more than a year or two. Interns could work from desks in empty cubicles until a new occupant moved in. From these cubicles the center offices were eyed, and from within those walls the window offices were dreamed about. I hadn’t even dreamed of working in such a well known establishment, starting as free labor before moving up and being paid for my time. <br><br><br>*****<br>	After my uncles wake I went back into my mother’s bedroom to the broken entertainment center from our old apartment in Ridgewood which now holds old keepsakes with too much memorial value to discard. I sat cross legged on the wooden floor next to the cabinet on the bottom left hand corner. I opened the right hand panel with its broken hinge that caused it to pop out and hang slightly less than 90 degrees off the one good hinge. I opened the left hand panel and looked in front of me at the assortment of photo albums that were crammed into this tiny corner. <br>	My mother had divided them up into names, primarily my sister and myself, and dates which made it easier to sort through. I looked for old photographs of my uncle from my childhood, since this was when I remembered him the most vividly. Yet there were no pictures as I scoured through four books, both my sister and my own. Instead I settled for five pictures from my childhood in order to remember those moments and perhaps have a better memory of my uncle from my youth. Although from different parts of the brown photo album, I realized upon returning to campus, that four out of five of the pictures were from 1988. Perhaps 1988 was such a monumental year that I couldn’t even encase it into my childhood mind and realize its significance. Or perhaps it was just a year of many pictures.<br>The only picture which isn’t from that particular year is an old picture taken before a time stamp was available on a camera, with the year hand written on the back of the photo in black ink. In this 1985 photo, my sister, five years old when this moment was captured, is curled into a ball with her knees to her chest and her two feet flat on the couch as she leans against my mothers red sweater into her chest. My mother hugs her, cupping her first born with her right arm and holding her up with her left hand as her left arm crosses her body and leads the picture viewers’ eyes to notice the dark blue jeans that hug her slim legs as she crosses her legs, left over right. <br>My mothers puffy blow dried, volumized and permed 80’s hair cut contrasts my sisters straight black bowl cut hair but the similarities in their almond eyes, small nose and thin lips are unmistakable. My sister smiles as the rosy color in her cheek bones are defined as the corners of her lips emphasize the roundness of her cheeks. My mother, with the similar round cheeks, smiles causing her eyes to become slightly smaller, her eye makeup more evident and her white teeth showing the pinkness of her lips.<br>My mother’s beauty is unmistakable as is her love for fashion which seems to be a passion left behind in this decade. My sister now towers three inches over my mother, no longer able to be tucked into my mother’s side. My mother has traded in her fluffy hair style for a sleek short highlighted haircut and her trendy blue jeans for clothes which can be worn to work and shoes which will not hurt her feet as she stands for twelve hours at work. Fewer pictures are now taken and those pictures in which her children are captured, she is no longer present, neither in front of nor behind the camera. <br>*****<br><br>September 11, 2001 is a fuzzy memory for it is harder to deal with picturing memories of tragedies which will inevitably haunt us. I can only remember clips, snippets, and moments. The weeks that followed are a blur and there is no timeline in which I can accurately label the moments I spent coping with this event. <br>At 9:00 am I laid on top of a bed at Health Services as a nurse used a small butterfly needle to collect an additional vial of blood after an unsuccessful attempt the previous Friday. On route back to my dorm I stopped by for a quick breakfast at Schneider, where I heard part of a conversation concerning a bombing at the World Trade Center which seemed ridiculous. I came concluded it must be concerning the bombing from the previous decade and quickly pushed the thought out of my mind. <br>As I climbed the hill toward the back entrance of Tower Court and headed back to my dorm, Claflin, my phone rang and the caller id surprised me since most of my friends were at school or at work. I picked up the phone and could barely make out my friends voice as he shouted at the other end and I tried to make out what he was saying in such desperation. After what seemed to only be a moment, we were disconnected for the last time. <br>I walked into my dorm, after having given up on the redial button, to find “Class canceled. WTC being attacked!” written on the chalk board. I couldn’t help but think it was a joke until I walked into the living room only to see Tower One collapse on the 13” television screen. I could not get in touch with my friends inside any of the seven buildings, friends in local colleges, friends from high school, my parents or my cousins. It would be hours or days before I could talk to everyone and by then, hope faded as days passed and nothing was known. I called a hotline to give off names of those I had worked with as well as speaking with parents who were distraught and relying on their faith. On the news, I could see the streets through which I had walked daily and could even make out the intersection I crossed on the way to school. There were also shots of former classmates and teachers running away near the Hudson River, next to which I had run with the track team only months before. And in every shot of the soot covered streets with zero visibility, I hoped perhaps I would see someone and know they were safe. <br>	For a moment the city which never sleeps was silent. The buttress which had supported me during my difficulties in high school had fallen and a place closer to me than my three bedroom apartment disappeared. At that same moment the world glued their eyes to their television sets as the Tower Two came tumbling down; it brought my life with it. <br>	<br>*****<br>    I did not attend the funeral 10 am on October 28, 2002. As my family said their farewells at a cemetery in Farmingdale, NY, I was on Wellesley’s campus attending Biology 109 in room 327 of the monstrous building known as the science center. Ironically the PowerPoint presentations displayed pictures discussing the topic of the day: the human brain. I called my sisters cell phone as I descended the stairs of the science center, looking at the dreary campus in front of me on this cold October day. As I heard her voicemail pop up without a single ring, I pictured my entire family in front of a grave almost as though it was a scene from a movie. I couldn’t help but remember all the funerals I had missed after September 11 despite the phone calls, invitations and opportunities to recite a few choice words at a memory of a person I once knew. <br>The last funeral I had attended was in 6th grade after returning from a trip with my best friend to her grandparents’ home in the Hamptons. A van filled with college aged Sunday school teachers were involved in a tragic accident in which two church members passed away. My sister, who was teaching summer school at the time, had been pressured by my mother to get on the bus the previous Friday and in a strange twist of luck managed to convince my mother otherwise. I had known the others in the van, some who had previously taught me, and their pictures were spread across the Metro section of the New York Times as they sat in the funeral looking upon the lifeless bodies of their peers. The article inaccurately reported the event with the truth construed and theories written as facts. As I sat in the back of my Korean Catholic church and cried in front of God, I told myself I would never attend another funeral again and to this day, that was my last recollection of a funeral. <br>God never gave me a choice when it came to death but I get to choose how I remember the dead. My last memory of my uncle will not be his body descending into his grave but rather I will have no last memory. I will remember my second father for all the fear he instilled in me and still hold admiration for the strongest man I had ever known. Antoine de Saint-Exupery said “When the body sinks into death, the essence of man is revealed. Man is a knot, a web, a mesh into which relationships are tied. Only those relationships matter. The body is an old crock that nobody will miss. I have never known a man to think of himself when dying. Never.” <br><br><br>*****<br>	If our memories of that which no longer exist fades and disappears, does it still exist? Suppose the last person to remember, happened to forget, does it still exist if there is no memory of it?<br>My life has balled up and tossed in the air while I try to catch it but not knowing where it would fall and bounce. What if it fell into the street and was run over by a car? How resilient would it prove to be? Would it ever bounce back?<br>When we look at a mirror, we have to face our physical selves but it is in the absence of noise that we are forced to take a hard, cold and honest look within ourselves. I crave for something in life, and I don’t know what it is yet. The thing is that no one can tell me who I am nor can they tell me who I will become. There are no answers to these questions; just hopes, aspirations, reactions and choices. <br><br><br><br>*****<br>	My uncle remained anonymous on the short article displayed in the Newsday newspaper October 15, 2002. His life was nameless and the incident but a small part of a publication that changes daily. September 11, 2001 has become a number “9-11.” The names are all but forgotten, the event used for political and military purposes more than humanitarian and the building but a symbol of a greatness that once was. My first newspaper article of significance, from the summer of 6th grade, has faded in memory and remains a black and white picture with untrustworthy words pointing the finger of guilt at the driver who never fell asleep at the wheel but never woke from his hospital bed. <br>	In my mind, I can remember these things; cut out pieces of the past that are glued onto my life. There are so many stories within our lives, so many significant moments that last only a second in the hour of our lives but leave an imprint for a lifetime. Perhaps I won’t remember every detail of what has happened and one day, I will forget memories without even realizing they have vanished. But in the end, they will all be a part of who I have become. I will carry on the stories, and the words of the so called objective viewers will not be the last. The past will continue with me and it will be written with my future.  		</p></font></font><a name="newsitem1040036948,35712,"></a><br><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#4681BD" weight="bold">.::.</font></b><br><small><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0F7B66">Monday, December 16, 2002</font></small><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">	After my uncles wake I went back into my mother’s bedroom to the broken entertainment center from our old apartment in Ridgewood which now holds old keepsakes with too much memorial value to discard.
