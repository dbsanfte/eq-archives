<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">Those of us fortunate enough to have competed in front of tens, hundreds or possibly thousands of supporting fans know there is nothing quite like it. There will never be anything like a last second game winning shot, nor the adrenaline of a bitter playoff battle. And while the game of basketball exists in pick-up games on private courts, it will never come close to playing against the best there are, amongst your most ardent supporters and greatest detractors. Michael Jordan's itch and eventualy return to the NBA was understandable if not predictable. Not one of us, who loves the game of basketball at any level would begrudge the chance to have a single shot or just one more chance at playing in the NBA. Why should he?</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
People asked last year "why come back?", "Why jeopardize an ending that at the very least was storybook and a career, legendary?" Today during a meaningless lopsided defeat, as fans chanted "We want Mike, We Want Mike!" and as irrelevant free throws drew ovations we understood why. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
We are left in the wake of his final game with uncounted memories, glimpses of the outstanding physical feats humans are capable of. If the most outstanding of such framed images came with Michael in a Bulls uniform, then these last two seasons sprinkled amongst our collection the greatness of human will. We remember his sick game against the jazz, the endless elevation of the game winning shot against the Cavaliers and the confused shrug against Portland. Forever replayed in our minds and in video will be the acrobatic layup against the Lakers and the double clutch foul line dunk at All-Star Weekend. Now we will remember a 39 year old's two handed block against his former team, and how even at forty, forty points did not seem a daunting task.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Last time it ended with a game winning shot and an NBA Championship. Last time we hoped it would not be the end. Last time with arm extended in an unforgettable pose Michael Jordan seemingly said thank you and goodbye to us.  </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
This time there were no finals, no playoffs and only the 82 regular season games. This time we knew exactly when the era would ultimately end. This time around there was no glory or championship and yet this time it ended in the way it should have. This time, the league, the players and we the fans finally got to say thank you, and farewell to him.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

<br><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#4681BD" weight="bold">.:Protests and Freedom of Speech:.</font></b><br>
<small><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0F7B66">Wednesday, April 02 2003</font></small><br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">As a result of current events, protests and freedom of speech have undoubteldy become one of the major discussions in our lives. Protests, criticisms and general intelligent opinions regarding our nation and its interaction with the world as well as domestic issues are important to our society. However, it seems that in our modern society many people simply do not understand the principles involved in our right to exercise free speech. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<i>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</i></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
This entire rant is a consequence of a Columbia Professor, who obviously does not realize the implications of exercizing his right to run his mouth. For those of you fans who are less informed, Professor De Genova, an anthropology Professor speaking at a Anti-war Teach In held by other professors at our school said: "I wish for a million Mogadishus."  and also to ask for an Iraqi victory.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Mogadishu refers to the US involvement in Somalia in which 18 US Soldiers died. What De Genova seems to forget is that over 1000 Somalis were killed in the short conflict, and while the incident with US Soldiers being dragged around Mogadishu was horrifying, the thought of death tolls on both sides could or SHOULD be multiplied in this conflict is evidence of how clueless this man really is. In short his speech was found reprehensible by a large portion of the public (the story was run accross a slew of national media organizations) and even by members of the teach in. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Let's follow his logic for a moment, our involvement in the war in Iraq is regrettable as we are sending countless young Americans to risk death for a cause that is neither theirs nor necessarily righteous. In order to resolve this situation, he hopes for the death of a large proportion of these young soldiers, as if that would somehow equalize the morality of this war. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Another consequence of his remarks has been an outlash including death threats to him and indirectly the anthropology department. What was more shocking was that today as I walked accross campus, students were protesting to these threat by organizing a sit down on the steps. A sign read "We are students from Prof. De Genovas class and we usually have class at this time but because of death threats in reaction to his comments during the Teach In, he was forced to cancel class."  Who or what are you exactly protesting against here? What is this a demonstration of? Solidarity? That could be the case if half the students didn't gag themselves with American flags. What has the government done to Prof. De Genova? Nothing! The school? Nothing. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
WHERE IN FACT IN THIS ENTIRE INCIDENT HAS A PERSONS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT BEEN STEPPED ON? ACTUALLY, WHERE ALONG THE CHAIN OF EVENTS HAS ANYTHING REMOTELY REPRESENTED BY THE AMERICAN FLAG DONE ANYTHING OF PSYCHOLOGICAL, POLITICAL OR BODILY HARM TO THE PROFESSOR OR THOSE WHO AGREE WITH HIM? <b>NO WHERE!</b>(Unless you count the fact that some crazy people out there decided to send him death threats, which is akin to saying that we should protest america b/c there are some stupid and violent people in the nation.) As this is the case, take those flags out of your mouth and substitute it with your dirty rain trodden shoes.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<BR>Truth is, the only real reactions from Columbia's community was an outcry of disgust with his comments. Even the school president found his remarks appalling. If this is what these students are demonstrating against, I would sincerely hope they realize that they are angry that President Bollinger and other faculty members are simply exercising their 1st amendment rights to tell De Genova what a flaming retard he was. The reality is that what comes out of your mouth has consequences. As a member of a community, an academic and intellectual community, you have the undocumented responsibility of realizing you do in some ways represent that community regardless of whether you want to or not.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The idea that what one says should not have any effect on how other people react is a sheer sign of mental incapacity. The whole reason we have freedom of speech is that speech is in and of itself a powerful motivator for education and a force for change/reaction. As a result, STUPID COMMENTS can often lead to NEGATIVE REACTIONS. It would be as naive to assume that I could run around Chinatown or Harlem and shout racial epithepts without having some fear of retaliation.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
In the end, De Genova keeps his job, there is no reaction from the government, but rightly so there is reaction from the local and national community. That is of course what the purpose of speech is! That students or this professor find it shocking that such reprehensible comments could agitate people to wish bodily harm when he wishes for the death of countless US and Iraqi lives, is an example of how students here at Columbia while academically gifted, may need some lessons in common sense.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Oh and in another note, he appears to have this historic problem with running his mouth to stir up controversy.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<i>"The heritage of the victims of the Holocaust belongs to the Palestinian people. The state of Israel has no legitimate claim to the heritage of the Holocaust. The heritage of the oppressed belongs to the oppressed--not the oppressor."</i></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Yeah... real sweet there.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Oh and to De Genova, and his fans out there... Here's something I learned sometime during 1986 when I was reading See Spot Run in my kindergarten class. I believe many of you may have skipped that lecture.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
"Think before you speak."<BR>(It might just make the reaction you recieve a little less surprising to you)<BR></p></font></font>

<br><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#4681BD" weight="bold">.:War:.</font></b><br>
<small><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0F7B66">Friday, March 21 2003</font></small><br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">Returned from a tropical paradise to the twenty-four seven coverage of conflict in Iraq. It's a strange contrast of two different worlds, New York and its all present security concerns with the warm blue relaxation of Hawaiian waters. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
In any case, we are once again at war. Many that I know feel discomforted, unsafe and worried about the current situation in our nation, fearful that we have subjected ourselves to inevitable retaliation and danger. As strange as it may be, I feel neither more insecure or nor worired than I was before I left. Perhaps it is a result of not really having any sort of substantial opinion on the matter of this conflict, either one side or another. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
At this point, I find myself uncomfortable with the war, simply in principle. Conflicts and death are sad in their conceptualization alone and it is here that I find certainty in my opinions on war. Battles are not something to be entered into lightly and our hope is of course always to find an alternative solution. War is sad because it is sometimes necessary.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
In another point, we hear constantly from opponents of the administration about this "unjust war." The concept of a JUST war to me seems to be one that we have entered into far too late. The only justification that appears universally appropriate for massive conflict is a preceding collosal loss of life and threat to global security. Our last "justified" conflicts were World War I and World War II in which our nations entry into battle was preceeded by millions of casualties and the destruction of entire nations. All Too little, All Too late. A generation devastated and years later ethnicities nearly wiped out. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Must we wait for horrifying consequences before action can be taken? We speak of diplomacy and yet we are constantly reminded of lessons we learned half a century ago, where diplomacy failed. No, we can never be certain that the terrible predictions we make today are assured to invoke themselves in the years to come. However, if given the chance to prevent the worst of our fears from occuring by fighting pre-emptive and currently unjustified battles now, should we? <BR></p></font></font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">Elizabeth Smart was found today, when CNN.com sent me the breaking news e-mail I was to say shocked and surprised. It really is a wonderful thing. I mean, it's not often, in fact downright rare where missing people are found, especially young girls in this day and age.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
One thought that keeps resurfacing in my head about the entire incident is this man Ricci that they had suspected and eventually charged with burglary. At this point it seems sort of evident that he didn't take a major role in the kidnapping and yet for much of duration of the search the focus remained on him. In fact the media and much of the population wanted to believe that he was the guilty party. I've always wondered how many people the nation brands as killers and criminals are really innocent. I read an article earlier today about a man on death row that has been there for 22 years and the victim's family is absolutely positive he's the suspect. He could very well be, but what if he isn't? I suppose I am the defense attorney's witness, since I seem to always have a high degree of doubt in these matters. Victims of crimes are of course sad, but I find myself saddened by victims of society. Oh , and Ricci.... he died in prison of a brain hemmorage serving a sentence for burglary.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
In other news, I dunno why but I Feel really dazed and just downright confused lately. I dunno, I feel alone and yet Im not really alone or lonely at all. I dunno whats up.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
