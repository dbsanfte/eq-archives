Productivity is therefore determined quite easily. If we hire too many workers such that we do not have enough resources for them all be worthwhile, this dropping of marginal productivity per worker is noticed. Manangement of the industry therefore has incentive to regulate.<br><br>Agriculturaly production however experiences extreme time lapses between work put in now, and output recovered. Between planting and harvesting , months pass. Thus the marginal productivity of workers is extremely hard to measure in any accurate sense. Furthermore this traditional economy limits its production in terms of LAND capital rather than raw input resources. Increasing the mass of land on which a particular farm occupies is much more difficult than finding a larger supply of coal, iron or steel. With such a cap on productive capital, the amount of work necessary on any given day and certainly through each season is therefore limited. What additional workers therefore bring is not necessarily added productivity in terms of output later on, but decreased work for each individual NOW. This is important, if we consider leisure as something of value. Using the notion of "A dollar now is worth more than a dollar later" and placing a value on leisure in comparison to the present value of future output, the incentive for added workers on a particular farm, even if marginal and average output drops is shown. In fact if we begin to calculate leisure as an item of value and output in terms of present value we could theoretically place an INCREASE in the "Value" per worker.<br><br>The lack of strict work hours for agricultural sectors also increases this incentive. Short of factories running out of inputs, workers maintain precise hours daily regardless of how much the factory as a whole has produced in that day. This does not necessarily hold true for agriculture. Furthermore, management in the modern sector does not participate directly in labor whereas "management" in traditional environments often do. This is yet more incentive for owners of farms to take on more workers since it reduces their own labor.<br><br><b>Legacy of Colonialism: Africa vs. Asia</b><br><br>One thing of note that has come to mind is the different development paths the nations in east asian and those of the african continent have undertaken in the past century. Much has been said about the legacy of colonialism in depressing development potential in nations by wreaking havoc on the ability of nations to produce industries.<br><br>The issue here of course is why some asian nations have managed to develop rather quickly in the past two decades while many african nations still face problems of widespread poverty. While Asian nations were not fully colonized in the same sense, they suffered many of the same situations that Africa had. Why then the disparity in results in the past twenty years? <br><br>It may very well be that this small difference in not being fully subordinate to Western powers altered the course of their history. One of the main differences between Asian Nations and African nations is the definition of national borders. The borders in Asian nations are for a very large part established ethnically, as a major result of hundred of years of cultural segregation. Koreans are Koreans, Chinese (even while the many internal segregations do exist) consider themselves to large extent Chinese and so forth. Meanwhile in Africa, national boundaries are not largely ethnic and invidiuals feel much more attachment to their tribal identities than they do national identity. What this creates is two extremely different attitudes in regards to national development. For many asian nations, matters of development are extreme issues of pride, an Us against Them mentality. In China, Korea and Japan(a little further back) the big push towards development was an issue of making the nation, i.e. the greater cause, better. <br><br>National Causes became an individual's cause because they had both ethnic and national incentives to see such steps succeed. The legacy of colonialism in holding back certain nations in Africa was the establishment of arbitrary borders..<br><br>I could be wrong of course... Since this is economics and rarely are people right.<br><br><br><br></p></font></font><a name="newsitem1034670502,31241,"></a><br><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#4681BD" weight="bold">.:A Chance Encounter:.</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">I remember the day I met Dominic... I was sitting on top of a barrel, and next to me perched on top of a small wooden crate was my brother. If you saw the two of us, you certainly wouldn't know we were brothers of course, a small aged gnome and a blue colored elf. Strange family, I agree.<br><br>In any case, during our hunting of druids (Thats what brothers do on friday evenings you know...) was when this large barbarian clad in a mixture of blue steel and leather, a laughable sight, comes wandering into the narrow tunnel where we sat. He had come seeking us, seeking our approval of all things. He wanted to join our select crew of druid hunters and mischief makers. I think he had received a referral from another barbarian one equally as fashionably challenged.<br><br>Out of pity, or perhaps in a rush to continue poaching hapless half-elven and human druidesses, we accepted him into our soon to be elite clique. Thus a friendship began, endured and survived, even if the barbarian often found himself in perilous situations... (Getting himself knocked out by a naked ogre with daggers for instance) And here we are today.<br><br></p></font></font><a name="newsitem1034636486,50412,"></a><br><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#4681BD" weight="bold">.:Voices:.</font></b><br><small><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0F7B66">Monday, October 14, 2002</font></small><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">The message board is finally up.

I remember hating it, it was unbearable. I reflect upon all that now and I realize how happy I am that my mother made we go through all that.<br><br>In the last week or so Ive found a resurgent desire to pick up all those things. Ive begun to study chinese on my own, mainly as a way to learn the many chinese songs that my cousins and friends enjoy singing when we go karaoke. Then there is the piano, I havent played for over 5 years now and yet when I look at sheet music I can still make out the notes. That surprises me. The last two nights, I have found myself playing with this synth I have at home and really enjoying it. I think I'll pick up the piano again. <br><br>How things change in you in a matter of years huh?<br><br></p></font></font><a name="newsitem1033775486,54145,"></a><br><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#4681BD" weight="bold">.:Update2!

I neglected one little thing, one of my bosses wants to email me about coming in more during next week because I wasnt able to complete all the assignments given me today.<br><br>This made me realize all of one thing. I dont wanna graduate. I dont wanna go into the work force and I certainly dont ever wanna have to do IT for the rest of my life. Maybe I'll go the route of a writer, a starving one. This type of evening defintely gives one time to think. In the past week I've applied to 20 jobs, and there are a whole list more than I plan on applying to. All the jobs are in the financial industry, something akin to what I am currenly doing/not doing right now. Frankly, this stuff is not what dreams are made of. Not even close. Maybe a dull boring day dream, but thats about it. As I sit here ranting non-stop about my day , I wonder if this a sign of things to come. If it is some signal then the day would describe my future as such: Dull, Depressing and Lonely...<br><br>What a way to live huh?.<br><br><br>To all a good night!<br><br>- 1 Irritated Jon</p></font></font><a name="newsitem1033767119,87248,"></a><br><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#4681BD" weight="bold">.:Update:: Info Tech Sucks!:.</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">Yup Thats right...

While we should enjoy these intermitent changes of measure and mode, I find myself glad to know that there will be sunny symphonies ahead.<br><br></p></font></font><a name="newsitem1033024721,69527,"></a><br><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#4681BD" weight="bold">.:Equal and Opposite:.</font></b><br><small><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0F7B66">Thursday, September 26, 2002</font></small><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">Strange that there exist things in the world that can cause great misery and unimagined happiness on a consistent basis.</p></font></font><a name="newsitem1033009082,87926,"></a><br><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#4681BD" weight="bold">.:&#25105;&#30693;&#36947;&#20320;&#24456;&#38627;&#36942; &#34081;&#20381;&#26519;/ I know you're feeling blue - Jolin Tsai:.</font></b><br><small><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0F7B66">Wednesday, September 25, 2002</font></small><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">&#25105;&#30693;&#36947;&#20320;&#24456;&#38627;&#36942; <br>&#24859;&#19968;&#20491;&#20154; &#38656;&#35201;&#32227;&#20221; <br>&#20320;&#20309;&#33510;&#35731;&#33258;&#24049; &#36234;&#38519;&#36234;&#28145; <br>&#21029;&#20667;&#24471;&#29992;&#20320;&#30340;&#22825;&#30495; &#21435;&#30896;&#35320;&#19981;&#23433;&#30340;&#38728;&#39746; <br>&#27599;&#19968;&#22825;&#21482;&#33021;&#30196;&#30196;&#30340;&#31561; &#24859;&#19968;&#20491;&#20154; <br>&#21029;&#22826;&#35469;&#30495; &#20320;&#21463;&#20663;&#30340;&#30524;&#31070; &#20196;&#20154;&#24515;&#30140; <br>&#27794;&#26377;&#19968;&#20491;&#20154; &#38750;&#35201;&#21478;&#19968;&#20491;&#20154; &#25165;&#33021;&#36942;&#19968;&#29983; <br>&#20320;&#21448;&#20309;&#33510;&#36924;&#33258;&#24049; &#38754;&#23565;&#20663;&#30165; <br>&#25105;&#30693;&#36947;&#20320;&#24456;&#38627;&#36942; <br>&#24863;&#24773;&#30340;&#20184;&#20986; &#19981;&#26159;&#30495;&#24515;&#23601;&#26371;&#26377;&#32080;&#26524; <br>&#21029;&#21839;&#24590;&#40636;&#20570; &#24859;&#25165;&#33021;&#38263;&#20037; <br>&#36889;&#36947;&#29702; &#26377;&#19968;&#22825;&#20320;&#26371;&#25026; <br>&#25105;&#30693;&#36947;&#20320;&#24456;&#38627;&#36942; <br>&#26152;&#22825;&#26159;&#25088;&#20154; &#20170;&#22825;&#35498;&#20998;&#25163;&#23601;&#20998;&#25163; <br>&#21029;&#21839;&#20320;&#30340;&#30171; &#35201;&#24590;&#40636;&#35299;&#33067; <br>&#22810;&#24773;&#30340;&#20154;&#35387;&#23450; &#20663;&#24471;&#27604;&#36611;&#20037; <br>&#24859;&#33509;&#35722;&#25104;&#20102;&#21050; &#24605;&#24565;&#20063;&#25104;&#20102;&#30196; <br>&#20063;&#35377;&#24515;&#30862;&#26159;&#24859;&#24773;&#26368;&#32654;&#30340;&#27171;&#23376;<br></p></font></font><a name="newsitem1032987285,79732,"></a><br><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#4681BD" weight="bold">.:Soul-Searching:.</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">I went to search for my soul today; to try and understand my heart.

We drive along a scrambled highway of feelings and emotions, trying with all our will to find destinations that will somehow fulfill us in our lives. How such fulfillment comes, perhaps in terms of love, or in terms of our futures and maybe through a simple feeling of comfort is for each of us to understand. <br><br>And yet as each of us makes this journey, we seemingly travel in a careless fashion, so concerned with reaching the places we want to go that we inevitably crash into those around us. Venturing forth to find what it is that will bring us joy... How often do we hurt those around us? How often do we make ourselves miserable in the process of our own search? It comes to me as a cosmic irony that in seeking bliss we must cause much sorrow.<br><br>This exposition has less to do with me than the events revolving around certain friends of mine. For those of you that would be concerned with me, I am in cruise control and perfectly fine with the direction Im headed. <br><br>I should only hope that all of us find the places where we should end up.</p></font></font><a name="newsitem1032837736,23196,"></a><br><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#4681BD" weight="bold">.:&#22823;&#21733;/Big Brother:.</font></b><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome &#21555;&#36842; (DI/MIKE/DIO) to U-Cubed.

The long forgotten sight of parallel steel caravans darting through the city's subterranean tunnels wisking passengers into their days, confronted me on this Friday morning. Destinations which had once been missing again reappeared along my travels. Rector Street and finally South Ferry. One stop was still missing, the place where calamity had struck one year ago... <br><br>Simple yellow signs with simple messages: "The 2 and 3 are now express" and "The 1 and 9 now make local stops" touched a bit of my heart.

The argument in the past was that all peoples regardless of origin, upon arriving into this nation would eventually "melt" into society. They would become indiscernible from the rest of American Society. Over the last 2 centuries this theory was validated in part through the immigration of Western and partially Eastern European peoples. The argument goes that for these peoples melting was a possibility because they LOOK American. Irish, Italian and so forth... They melt.<br><br>In the past few days Ive been giving consideration as to whether a melting pot is what we want. Let's face it, the minorities of today's america, the asian immigrigrants of the past 40 years, the Latin American individuals and even African Americans will never quite MELT. Perhaps what we should seek rather is to make this Nation a Mosaic. Stare closely and you see the parts, but unless you're trying to break everything up, all you see is the fully blended picture.
