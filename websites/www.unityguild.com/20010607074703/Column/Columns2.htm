This morning I woke up with the feelin of "where am I?"  Realizin that my entire neck and back were cramped up, it was my first long and peaceful night of sleep that I finally have gotten since Korean Night 2001 here at Binghamton.  The modern dance that I took over after the previous supervisor left wasn't as bad as thought.  We had 4 days to prepare, and I forced to breakdance with my sprained ankle and the sickenin cold that I caught. All in all, we had fun though.  Why is KASA (Korean American Student Association) here so clickish? I feel like I'm back in Great Neck, back home where all these clickish rich brats have nothin better to do with their lives.  Most of the modern dance guys were my friends before I joined the KASA executive board.  I felt like they were treatin us differently and lookin down on us .. but after gettin to meet all those modern dance girls (who outnumbered us 3:1) it was fun.  The after-party sucked .. I think people here really don't know how to organize and throw scenes at clubs here at Bing.<br>    I missed a test that week (which is aiite I suppose because I get to drop one) and I missed a problem set (which is ok also because I get to drop one).  I also didn't go to class that entire week and slept like 2 hours a day.  After Korean Night, I had 2 more tests coming up, not to mention this one disel computer science lab that was due.  After that week was over, I went home for my easter/passover break and hung out with some fellow Unity/STD members for some well deserved serious relaxation.<br>    Like the idiot I am, when I went to church on Sunday to chill with some of my church friends that I rarely see these days, we of course go to a freakin PC bong and play CS for freakin 3 hours straight like the loserz we are.  What a real plain and borin weekend for me but its all good cause I got to sleep a little.<br>    Finally I go back up to school and tell myself that I'm goin to quit smokin and start goin to all my classes and be the good scholar boy that I waz last semester.  That didn't work, I missed like 2 classes that week and I freakin left my sneakers at home.  I had to freakin go to Wallmart and buy $15 sneakers so I wouldn't fail my advance basketball class.  NEVER by sneakers that are that cheap.  I think I sprained my other ankle because there was this two objects in the shoe that kept pokin and pushin on my ankle.  Of course this meant that I was goin back home this weekend once again.  I met up with Damon and he had to go see his girl Lisa (whos sick) so I told him that we'd go back home but I need to come up Saturday.  He said that he had a bio test comin up and he said it was all good.<br>    I met up with Rich most of the rest of that week.  This isn't a good thing because everytime I'm with Rich, we always say we're gonna do somethin academic (study, homework, etc..) but we always end up gettin a bunch of food, cookin .. then chillin like the lazy people we are.  Its all good though because we always invite mad people and corrupt them too.  It was fun though, I think I could use a break anyways.<br>    Friday was interesting.  KASA eBoard had this constitution revision.  It was at my place.  The DDR padz that I borrowed from Fay made things fun at one point too.  KASA eBoard is like 8 girls and 5 guys so you can imagine why people wanted to try it.  Of course, with all the practice that I've had before-hand, made everyone think of me as the herb who has nothin better to do than play this game.  Well, it was a long 6 hours before we finally finished.  But it was fun.  I brought a lot of food and drinks to keep us happy, and we seemed to have just as much fun jokin around as well as gettin down to business.  They were completely messy. (BASTARDS!!) I figured girls were more messy than the guys anyways so it wasn't unexpected.  After we were done, we all headed over Rich's place for this Korean Night cast/KASA sleep-over thing .. I told Bernice (vice-president) so thats what you call it now these days.  I cleaned up, still found Damon in my room .. playin CS for 8 hours straight.  Nancy (treasurer) tryin to get in and play and Sharon (secretary) just sittin there.  Elin (President) was still here and I found that pretty interestin.  We really didn't get along at all in the beginning.  She's your typical "Great Neck Girl" but it seeems recently that we've connected in our own way.  She stayed an extra 30 mins after everyone else left and we just talked while I was cleanin up.  I told Damon that I was gonna go to the party and that if he wanted to come, to just come .. if not just wait and play CS, take food .. do whatever.  I wanted to hangout first before we went down to the city because it was like 12 am and it wasn't like I was gonna go hangout at 3 am.  He decided to stay and I went to Rich's.<br>    Umm, it was fun .. KASA eBoard is very entertaining drunk.  I had a few interestin, in-depth talks with Jason, Bernice, Emily, and Danny.  They played that stupid 1-10 game and everyone got wasted.  I saw Diana Joo there from Great Neck which was very strange cause she really didn't go out in High School and I met a Jewish major Korean girl.  All in all it was fun and I left Rich's place at 5:30 am.<br>    I come back to my place to see Damon asleep in my bed, I wake him up and tell him to sleep in the car as I drove back home.  It was pretty funny.  This kid was so tired that he fell asleep like 3 times in the middle of our conversations.  I didn't sleep either that night and I got us back to the city in 3 hours.  As I drop Damon off at his girl's place, my car has some problems.  The brake is messed up.  I pop my baby into neutral and push it to the Getty station 6 blocks away.  Freakin I'm gonna kill Monroe, the brakes that they said they took care of, wasn't taken care of.  They messed up and put in the wrong screw and thats the reason why there was a leak in my break fluid.  BASTARDS, when I get back to Bing, I'm gonna kill them.  Anyways, I ended up stayin at Lisa's place with Damon.  She's real smart for a chinese girl *duck*.  She has like 3 web pages up of her own, there really good.  She knows JAVA and HTML for a senior in High School.  She goes to Sty (#1 high school).  Anyways, I end up fallin asleep for an hour on her couch and we wake up to go play ultimate.  Oh yea, I had fun.  Anyways, I picked up my sneakers and we left for Bing at 6:00 pm.  My new record time back to Bing 2 hrs 30 mins.  I got back at 8:30 pm, enough time to go out.  Damon was sleepin the entire time and I felt better since he was gonna be able to study tonight.  I went out to this really whack Bing party and came back at 2 am to go to this Astronomy thing for extra credit in my Astronomy class.  Of course I was drunk and it made everythin so much more interestin.  Anyways, I passed out at like 3 and I woke up just now, writin this and gettin ready to go to the church.</p></font></font>
