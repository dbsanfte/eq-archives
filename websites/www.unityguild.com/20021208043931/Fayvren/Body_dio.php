Loud, full of people talking and music playing. Oh, and some people will smoke up the room to further handicap our vision and health.  The songs never really match with the music videos. However, we all seem to be okay with them.  We cannot move freely because there are people sitting all over the room. People ended up either hyper, drunk, crazy, and tired as they sing one song after another. At the end, we all gotta pay. Sometimes we pay fairly, sometimes we pay more than we suppose to, and if someone pukes, we know we are going to PAY.<br><br>So what song are you going to key-in next?</p></font></font><a name="newsitem1037637213,60559,"></a><br><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000EE">300?! </font><br><small><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000EE">Monday, November 18, 2002</font></small><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#000000">300<br><br>That is a number of perfection<br>That is a number one can brag about for years<br>That is a number we want to reach<br><br>300<br><br>There are many ways you can get there<br>There are many ways you can also fall just short of there<br>There are many regrets and feelings of wholeness around there<br><br>300<br><br>You need to be consistant<br>You need to be patient<br>You need to be humble<br><br>300<br><br>So who's gonna get there first?<br>So who's gonna be close to there first?<br>So who's gonna constantly within reach of there first?<br><br>300<br><br>It is equal to 12 Xs<br>It is equal to 12 perfect throws<br>It is equal to 12 consistant moves<br><br>300<br><br>are you there?<br></p></font></font><a name="newsitem1037166965,44449,"></a><br><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000EE">MR.
