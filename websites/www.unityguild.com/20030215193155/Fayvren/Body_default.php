<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">Ever feel like you could stare or try at something and it wouldn't come to you? This is how I feel about organized basketball at the moment. Something just not clicking. Feeling lost. Not a good feeling at all. Actually I think its a matter of confidence, when I play with people I know, I seem to know what to do and how to do it. But then the pressure of people I dont know and expectations at practice seems to get to me. Its quite sad, this rarely happens elsewhere, cept maybe at work. Need to fix this fast cuz its frustrating me to no end this evening. </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">This week I started playing with the scout/practice team for the girls basketball team at Columbia. I must say, this has been the best workout I've recieved in a looooooooong time. Chasing some of the point/shooting guards around the court is extremely tiring. It doesn't help that Blye gave me the King Kong of Charlie Horses the other day, making me not quite so limber. In any case, being beaten up by girls on a daily basis isn't all that bad. Managed to learn a lot, having had NO organized basketball experience up till this point. Meeting new people is also fun too. So as of now, Tuesdays through Thursday involves much banging and physical play with sweaty females... @.@</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">Where to begin? </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
I apologize for the lack of updates, it's been a long 2.5 weeks. First there was the matter of spending all the final hours of winter break in joyous celebration. (i.e. spending hours watching strange movies at Esthers house till 7am for an entire week) The end of vacation culminated in an evening of overindulging in alcoholic beverages... Mike's Birthday. 15 Shots in 40 minutes... It was quite a stupifying achievement to be honest. They could make a movie of it. Zero to Gone in 40 minutes. Apparently members of the inner circle wish to make this a new tradition for birthdays. At this rate, this tradition will either die, or one of us will attempting to follow suit. Im betting on the latter.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Moving back into school wasn't such a horrible transition. I had expected dreading being back but as of late being at the dorm, on campus hasn't been all bad. With the exception of being Xed-over 5-6 times on thursday while playing basketball and essentially embarrassed in front of alot of people, the week has gone pretty well. At this point I dont actually have any classes I am signed up for on tuesdays and thursdays, and my schedule on M-W is pretty light. I do wonder if I am slacking this way, but then again, I don't wanna stress too much when finals come around. Imagine the years of my life I am preserving in this fashion. Stress during finals weeks must be the cause of loss for many person-years of lifetime accross the nation. It cannot be good.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The new plan for my self edification is to randomly pick and choose people to follow into class and see if I can learn anything interesting. I figure, I am more inclined to actually learn and attend classes where I dont have to do work. It will keep things refreshing and new. Strange huh? When I dont need to go to class I want to, and when I have to, well I sleep and play basketball. Freedom is a wonderful thing.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
In other news, Katie came down to stay. She got to meet all my crazy friends and family. A little karaoke, some of the met, some shopping and just all around fun. Superbowl sunday coming up too! This means Popeyes Chicken and Cajun rice at Mike and Willy's. I entered into a superbowl pool at work too. Oakland 4's and Tampa Bay 6's.... Hopefully the result of the game will be this: Oakland 14 Tampa Bay 6 in the first quarter! Then the defensive coordinators take over keeping the score 14 - 6 the rest of the game! </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
When I get a chance tomorrow I'll fix up some of the missing photo albums, finish up my grad school apps and then work on the website hopefully. I am also determined to learn some korean, japanese and some other weird and not necessarily applicable skill sets. </p></font></font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">When snowboarding:</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Make sure to stay either on the toe or heel edge of the board at all times. This prevents you from hitting a bump and doing a bad martial arts fall impression.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Always keep your weight on the lead foot/leg, so as to free your rear leg for ruddering as well as keeping a forward center of balance.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
What not to do:</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Do not catch the wrong edge of the snowboard in a pile of snow, subsequently leading to a catapult like motion forcing your face to meet ice/snow and then slide on said face for 10 feet. Results in red face with lots of lost skin.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Do not make a sharp turn and hit a mound of ice, especially in areas where the trail is particularly narrow. Could end in snowboarded falling off teh trail into the thick underbrush nearby and being punctured by branches in the back of the knee. Quite painful.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
