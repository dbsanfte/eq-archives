            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The lean 
              youth leaned upon the old oak tree. An unremarkable young man of 
              light figure topped by untamed short black hair, few would notice 
              his presence in a crowd. Standing upon the grassy knoll, the world 
              he knew was sprawled accross the quaint countryside below. His eyes 
              glazed over at the thought of his long time home here in the Vale. 
              The smell of grass, freshly moistened by the morning dew, brought 
              a flood of memories of the years gone by. Thoughts of childhood 
              games, evenings spent with friends and youthful adventures floated 
              into mind. Nostalgia crept in as his mind raced on its own imagining 
              the many hours his younger self had spent in the very same spot. 
              As he let his weight fall upon the tree, he smiled at the thought 
              of this oak tree, a familiar if not silent friend of his past.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;FAY!&quot; 
              a familiar cry came, breaking through this momentary reflection. 
              &quot;Come down already, we cant very well have a farewell feast 
              without the person we're saying goodbye to, now can we?&quot; Turning, 
              the young man saw the comforting figure of his old friend Sam. If 
              there was anyone in the Vale that he could trust, Sam was that person. 
              With a quiet nod, Jonthys or &quot;Fay&quot; as he was called by 
              those closest to him, began walking towards his own goodbye.</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The decision 
              had been made seven days ago. Months earlier the spellweavers had 
              come calling, their presence quite unusual this far out into the 
              countryside. In the empire of Nyrwind the spellweavers were masters 
              of their surroundings, often discovering early in their life an 
              ability for the extraordinary. Members were far and few between, 
              individually picked up from their lives and trained to manipulate 
              the worlds natural forces. Certainly none had ever previously arisen 
              from this small village, and in all likelihood another would not 
              for ages to come. That he was chosen, Fay realized, was a gift of 
              unlimited opportunity, a chance that few in the world would ever 
              see. Yet, as the days turned into weeks and soon into month, the 
              choice still stood before him and he was reluctant to choose his 
              fate. Often his thoughts found themselves resting upon his mother 
              Shylah, who with his father's passing two winters past, would be 
              left alone should he leave. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Spellweavers 
              were mentored and trained at the Academy, whose location was remote 
              even to the capital cities, and much further from the Vale. Training 
              took the years of dedication from which there was no leave. The 
              thought of the miles and years it would take from him and the world 
              of his youth made the decision difficult. The moments he would lose 
              and the events he would miss haunted him over the weeks, but eventually 
              he found his resolve. Assuring Fay that he would have no need to 
              worry over her wellfare, Shylah counselled her son. &quot;You cannot 
              allow yourself to sacrifice this occasion on my behalf. Your thoughtfulness 
              while considerate is misplaced, your future is at stake. If there 
              is any greatness in you then this is the chance for you to find 
              it, and perhaps in the end you might bring wonderful things to our 
              world.&quot; It was thus that the fate of the young man came to 
              be. </font></p>
