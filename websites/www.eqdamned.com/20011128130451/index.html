You have found your way to the home of the Damned.  We are a family that travel the worlds of 
Norrath, killing and pillaging along the way.  We have gathered the best fighters and casters
 thoughout the land to come together and set off on new adventures.  When we are not in this 
 sanctuary, we can be found on the Cazic Thule server of Everquest.

<!---<h1 align="center"><font color="ffff00">ANNOUNCEMENT!!! Building Alliances</font></h1><p align="center" width="70%"><font color="0080ff">I would like to bring to everyone's attention that I am working on building relations with another guild named <a href="http://members.home.net/charvard/KOELHOME.htm"><b><i>Knights of Eternal Light</i></b></a>.  I would like everyone to take time to say hello and try to group with them as often as possible.  I have been very impressed with this guild and the organization that they displayed on the multi-guild hunt that I attended.  There were three groups around level 30 and was pulled off very well.  So please help me out here.</font></p>--->
