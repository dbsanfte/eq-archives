During one stormy night Caeddar Tal`Silvanthae was born to just such a family of gatherers. He grew up happy and content until one dark evening, at a young age of 50 seasons, a horde of orcs raided his family's encampment while they were a distance outside the safe borders of Kelethin. Before his eyes his family was brutally slaughtered while the orcs showed no remorse. At damn the next day Caeddar tracked down the leader of the horde and beheaded him viscously, which he presented to the Ranger Guildmaster. Upon seeing the determination and vengeance in Caeddar's silver eyes the Guildmaster took it on himself to train the youth, forging him as a smith forges tempered steel. 
After a time Caeddar proved himself again and again to be a capable Ranger, and thus the Guildmaster set him upon a task of exploring the strange lands of Norrath past the borders of the Elven Island of Faydwer. During one of his explorations into the doomed City of Mist in the lands of Kunark, Caeddar came upon a band of adventurers led by the Rogue Cudget Shadowswift. So impressed was he with this battle worn band, and the apparent family values that they held, that he agreed to follow them for a time. 
To this day, Caeddar has been a member of this band known as the Outcast Adventurers and not an orc remains alive who has the misfortune of crossing his path.
