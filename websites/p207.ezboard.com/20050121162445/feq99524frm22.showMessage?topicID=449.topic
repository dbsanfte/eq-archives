<br>
WASHINGTON - Rebuffing Bush administration claims, the independent commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks said Wednesday no evidence exists that al-Qaida had strong ties to Saddam Hussein (news - web sites). In hair-raising detail, the commission said the terror network had envisioned a much larger attack and is working hard to strike again. <br>

  Sept. 11 Panel: Iraq Rebuffed Bin Laden <br>
(AP Video) <br>
 <br>
   <br>
<br>
Although Osama bin Laden (news - web sites) asked for help from Iraq (news - web sites) in the mid-1990s, Saddam's government never responded, according to a report by the commission staff based on interviews with government intelligence and law enforcement officials. The report asserted &quot;no credible evidence&quot; has emerged that Iraq was involved in the Sept. 11 strikes. <br>
<br>
<br>
Al-Qaida is actively trying to replicate the destruction of that day, the report said, though the terrorist network has been weakened by losing its sanctuary in Afghanistan (news - web sites) and many leaders to U.S. strikes and arrests. The terror organization also is trying to obtain a nuclear weapon and is &quot;extremely interested&quot; in chemical, radiological and biological attacks, including the use of anthrax, it said. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The trend toward attacks intended to cause ever-higher casualties will continue,&quot; the report said. <br>
<br>
<br>
The commission staff said that Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed initially outlined an attack involving 10 aircraft targeting both U.S. coasts. Mohammed proposed that he pilot one of the planes, kill all the male passengers, land the plane at a U.S. airport and make a &quot;speech denouncing U.S. policies in the Middle East before releasing all the women and children,&quot; the report said. <br>
<br>
<br>
Bin Laden rejected that plan as too complex, deciding instead on four aircraft piloted by handpicked suicide operatives. The report said the targets were chosen based on symbolism: the Pentagon (news - web sites), which represented the U.S. military; the World Trade Center, a symbol of American economic strength; the Capitol, the perceived source of U.S. support for Israel, and the White House. Training for the attacks began in 1999. <br>
<br>
<br>
The attacks were planned for as early as May 2001, but they were pushed back to September, partly because al-Qaida sought to strike when Congress would be at the Capitol. A second wave of hijackings never materialized because Mohammed was too busy planning the Sept. 11 attacks, according to the report. <br>
<br>
<br>
Under questioning, John Pistole, the FBI (news - web sites)'s top counterterrorism official, told the commission that the government &quot;has probably prevented a few aviation attacks&quot; in the United States since Sept. 11 but that some operatives in those plots are still at large. <br>
<br>
<br>
The findings were released as the commission began its final two days of hearings on the terror attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. The second day will focus on the Federal Aviation Administration (news - web sites) and U.S. air defenses. The commission's final report is due July 26. <br>
<br>
<br>
The first day lacked the electricity of past sessions featuring appearances by National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice (news - web sites), CIA (news - web sites) Director George Tenet, Attorney General John Ashcroft (news - web sites) and other top officials. Like previous hearings, the audience included family members of people killed in the attacks, many bearing photographs of lost loved ones. <br>
<br>
<br>
Commission member Bob Kerrey, a former Democratic senator from Nebraska, expressed exasperation that the government did not act with greater urgency against bin Laden, given what was known about al-Qaida before 2001. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe that we missed a tremendous opportunity very early in this game to inform the Congress, inform the American people who bin Laden was, what he was doing, what he had done and as a consequence I think we simply didn't rally until it was too late,&quot; Kerrey said. <br>
<br>
<br>
The conclusions that al-Qaida and Iraq had no cooperative relationship run counter to repeated assertions by President Bush (news - web sites), Vice President Dick Cheney (news - web sites) and other administration officials. The claims that bin Laden and Saddam were in league were central to the administration's justification for going to war in Iraq. <br>
<br>
<br>
As recently as Monday, Cheney said in a speech that the Iraqi president &quot;had long-established ties with al-Qaida.&quot; And last fall he cited what he called a credible but unconfirmed intelligence report that Mohamed Atta, ringleader of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers, met in Prague, Czech Republic, with a senior Iraqi intelligence official before the attacks. <br>
<br>
<br>
The commission concluded no such meeting occurred. <br>
<br>
<br>
Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry (news - web sites) said the report's findings were evidence the &quot;administration misled America and the administration reached too far.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;They did not tell the truth to Americans about what was happening or their own intentions.&quot; he said on Detroit radio station WDET. <br>
<br>
   <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Secretary of State Colin Powell (news - web sites), asked about the commission report, said the administration stands by its assertions that there were links between al-Qaida and Iraq. <br>
<br>
&quot;I think we have said, and it is clear, that there is a connection, and we have seen these connections between al-Qaida and the regime of Saddam Hussein and we stick with that,&quot; Powell said in an interview on the al-Jazeera television network. &quot;We have not said it was related to 9/11.&quot; <br>
<br>
The White House also released an Oct. 7, 2002, letter from the CIA to then-Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Bob Graham, D-Fla., citing &quot;solid reporting&quot; of an Iraq-al-Qaida relationship &quot;going back a decade&quot; and credible reports that al-Qaida sought contacts in Iraq who might help them acquire the capability to use weapons of mass destruction. <br>
<br>
&quot;Credible information indicates that Iraq and al-Qaida have discussed safe haven and reciprocal non-aggression,&quot; says the CIA letter, released by Cheney's office. The letter said much of the information came from detainees, including some of high rank. <br>
<br>
The commission report said that bin Laden, then in Sudan, met with an Iraqi intelligence officer in 1994 to request space for al-Qaida training camps and assistance in obtaining weapons, &quot;but Iraq apparently never responded.&quot; The meeting occurred even though bin Laden opposed Saddam's secular government and had sponsored anti-Saddam operatives in Iraq's Kurdish region. <br>
<br>
The camps that were established in Afghanistan after bin Laden moved there in 1996 produced as many as 20,000 al-Qaida operatives and encouraged trainees to &quot;think creatively about ways to commit mass murder,&quot; the report said. <br>
<br>
Some of the ideas included taking over a missile launcher and forcing Russians to fire a nuclear device at the United States, mounting mustard gas or cyanide attacks against Jewish areas in Iran, releasing poison gas into a building ventilation system — and &quot;last, but not least, hijacking an aircraft and crashing it into an airport or nearby city.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Sept. 11 plot gradually evolved from Mohammed's original vision but was hardly a seamless operation, the commission report said. Mohammed, who is in U.S. custody at an undisclosed overseas location, wanted up to 26 operatives for the four-plane plot, but at least 10 were prevented from entering the United States because of visa problems, family objections and other reasons. <br>
<br>
There was disagreement between Mohammed, bin Laden and Atta about whether the Capitol or White House should be targeted, a question the report says apparently never was resolved. Bin Laden also had to overcome objections to attacking the United States from Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader who was under pressure from his Pakistani supporters to contain al-Qaida. <br>
<br>
Omar, like bin Laden, has eluded U.S. capture since the attacks. <br>
