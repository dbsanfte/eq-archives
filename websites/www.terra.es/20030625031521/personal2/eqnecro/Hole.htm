             <P><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#0066FF"><b><u>The hole</u></b></font></P> 
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">The hole is high
             level dungeon situated off paineel newbie hunting zone. The
             entrance is blocked by a big rock, and the key can be purchased at
             paineel vendors (the one in front of the bank) for 100 pp.
             Alternatively, you can duck thru the small hole between the rocks,
             pressing continiously the 'd'&nbsp; key. Anyway, I recomend you to
             buy the key.</font></P> 
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">There is something
             very special about this dungeon. It has not been dessigned, either
             on porpouse or not, like any other high level dungeon in the game :
             It ain't got '<i>rooms</i>' to camp, it's empty most of the times,
             people don't gather at the zone in entrance looking for pick up
             groups, etc. In my opinion, the main factor to explain The Hole's
             lack of adventurers is that it's frigging apart from the rest of
             the world and you <b>must</b> have a gater/evac'er in your party.
             In the other hand, Verant has implanted a 25% exp bonus here trying
             to atract player to the Hole. All this characteristics have made
             the Hole the perfect raiding dungeon where guilds come and practice
             their organization, team work, etc.</font></P> 
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">Ok now, there are
             two hot exp spots in the Hole :</font></P> 
             <blockquote>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000"><b>The entrance
                  :</b> Just right after zoning in, you will see a corridor
                  which leads to the depths of the dungeons. By the side, there
                  are 6 elementals spawning points guarding the way. This
                  elemental start turning green at lvl 55, so they are around
                  level 40 (my guess). They hit for 100 and don't have many HPs.
                  They drop fast indeed, so the exp is very good (top that off
                  with the 25% exp bonus and you got a serious exp boosting
                  oportunity).</font></p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">In my opinion,
                there is no need of a full length party at the entrance. Grab a
                3 or 4&nbsp; members party (heavy melee prefered, supported by a
                healer and a snarer) and pull away those elementals (blue points
                in the <b><u><a href="HoleMap.htm" target="_blank">map</a></u></b>) and also from the corridor. Whatch out
                for the <i>Rock Golem</i> though. He is lvl 52-54, hits for 140
                and has got tons of HPs.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">This spot is very
                good for a small exp party due to the closeness of the spawns,
                the 25% exp bonus and the zoning line border is just 30 feet
                away.</font></p>
              </blockquote>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000"><b>The
                  courtyard : </b>If you got a balanced full party, you might
                  want to jump off the cliff down to the courtyard. Please, note
                  that once you do the jump down (yellow arrow on the <b><u><a href="HoleMap.htm" target="_blank">map</a></u></b>)
                  there is <b>no way back</b> unless you raid thru the whole
                  dungeon. Of course you can't do that with one group, so make
                  sure you bring a teleporter along so he can port the melees
                  back out.</font></p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">The mobs here are
                bit tougher, and an enchanter is a <b>must</b>. There are plenty
                of roamers in the courtyard, and chances to have few adds on the
                pull are high. You better have an experienced puller too, or
                else the whole group will be in deep....</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">I assure you that
                as long as you control the situation, you'll have non stop
                pulling and exp will indeed fly upwards.</font></p>
              </blockquote>
             </blockquote>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">What about loot? the
             main armour set you can loot in the Hole is the <i>Loam encrusted
             armour</i>. It's got few nices pieces that can sell for good cash.
             Of course, I don't think you would get them if you camp the
             entrance, but you might have a chance at the courtyard.</font></p>
