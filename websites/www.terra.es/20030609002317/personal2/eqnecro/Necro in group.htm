             level dungeon group</b></font></u>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi there.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Throughtout this web I have
             constantly repeated that the necro s usual way of hunting is the
             outdoors soloing <a href="strategies.htm"><b>Darkness-Fear combo</b></a><b>.
             </b>Indeed, this is what we do the best, and no class (not
             even mages or druids) can match us necros.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most likely, this is exactly what
             you have been doing for the past 50 levels. Zones like Oasis, Lake
             of ill Omen, South Karanas, Overthere or DreadLands have been
             witness of your excellencies as an experienced soloer. Besides, you
             have leveled up fairly easily and fast and you have found little or
             no need to get into any group so far. Unfortunatelly, those days
             have come to an end&nbsp; <b>: ( </b></font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As I mentioned in the <a href="Level%2050%20to%2060.htm"><b>level
             50 to 60 section</b></a>, you can still find some spots to solo
             post 50, specially at your early 50s. But this doesnt mean that its
             the right choice. Exp bar wont move as it used to, and we all know
             that outdoors loot always sucked. This is why i advice you to
             change your way of thinking and start thinking about the other part
             of tha game : the group hunting.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In my opinion, to hunt in group is
             not as rewarding as to solo. The feeling of beating the crap out of
             an even conning mob by yourself is only comparable to the feeling
             you get when emerging victorious in a duel to death. When you are
             in a group, the satisfaction comes when you work as a perfect
             killing machine with no downtimes and no deaths rather than the
             personal pride on your own powers. The necro is not the leader of
             the group. Enchanters, clerics or tanks are. Therefore, dont expect
             to awe your team mates or even yourself with your devastating DoTs
             and pet. Actually, a necro s duty in a group is quite &quot;dark&quot;,
             working always behind the shadows and doing the dirty job&nbsp; <b>:
             )</b></font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ok now, as I have mentioned several
             times, necromancers have one of the widest range of possibilities
             among all the casters. We can perform many things, yet no one is
             our speciallity (apart of soloing, of course) : we can inflict
             damage, but nor as fast as mages or wizzies; we can do some crowd
             control, but not as efficiently as enchanters; we can do assist
             healing, but not like druids or shammies. So, what the fuck can I
             do in a group ?? </font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Everything is going to depend on
             what group are you in, which classes your group has got and which
             are missing. As i said before, since the necro is not the group s
             showman, he has got the posibility (and the obligation) to adjust
             his role to the group s needs.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, Im gonna decribe some of the
             different alternatives you might face while getting into a group,
             and what should you be doing if you are in such : <b>1. <a href="#. Mana Battery role">Mana battery</a>,

             <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ok now, lets say you
             got into a group with too much of nuke power and lacking of a
             proper tank. The biggest concern of the group will be to kill the
             mob fast enough because the tank wont handle to much mambo fight
             without burning down the cleric s mana. For example, such a group
             could formed by :</font></p>

             <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"> Most likely, the
             group will finish the mob pretty quickly because of its high and
             fast damage hability. So, in order to avoid long downtimes, we will
             become the rest of the other casters s mana battery&nbsp; <b>:

             alternatively one each (to not overtaunt the mob) while the Tank and the pets try to keep up with the damage taken. In this case,
             the nukers will burn lots of mana fast, and you have to supply them
             back with that mana or prepare for long medding downtimes. Also,
             you might have to dump some mana on the cleric, but since combats
             will be fast (not many complete healing performed) and there is -or
             should be- a shamman/druid healing assisting, cleric s mana should

             resists even once, you will NOT have time to recast it before the
             other one brakes free. Lets do the maths : 2.6 + 6.5 + 2.6 = 11.7
             secs since you first cast ST on the first mob till you ST the
             second one. Since ST has a max duration of 18 secs, we are ok so
             far. But lets imagine the mob have resisted ST and you have got to
             wait 6.5 + 2.6 secs to recast it. That comes up to : 11.7 + 6.5 +
             2.6 = 20.8 secs, which is more than 18 secs. So, by the time you
             are ready to reapply ST on the mob that initially resisted ST, the
             other one has been freed of ST s mez effect, hence jumping on you
             right away. </font></p>
             <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">So how can we safely
             control 2 mobs? We will have to use a ST - PE - Pet combination. Im
             going to describe what should you do in case you party is camping a
             room and the puller brings along three mobs on his tail :</font></p>

              <table border="1" bgcolor="#220000" cellspacing="1">
                <tr>
                  <td width="100%"><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ok,
                    wait till the tank and the rest of the group stick to one
                    very mob (/assist tank applies here). Then ST another one
                    and send pet to the third one (with the pet s taunt <i>on</i>).
                    Try to tell your group to step aside out of those two mobs s
                    melee reach (couple of meters will be enough) pulling the
                    creature they are fighting along with them to a corner of
                    the room. Reapply ST on the first mob and PE it straight
                    away. The second one must be hitting your pet hard (prolly
                    pet s health is 50% by now). Ok, here it comes the tricky
                    part : ST that second mob and right afterwards hit the
                    &quot;/pet back off &quot; hotkey. If you get him to back
                    off without hitting the monster (and therefore braking the
                    ST), then you ll be doing ok. Now PE that second mob while
                    he is STed and park the pet aside to recover HPs (or send
                    him to the mob the tank is fighting against).</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If the group has
                    done what you told them (to drive their mob and themselves
                    out of the other two s -the ones you are dealing with- melee
                    reach), now you have 2 mobs rooted, your pet parked aside,
                    and the group finishing off their prey. Your only duty now
                    is to recast PE every 20 secs on each of those two creatures.
                    If the room is pretty narrow and they cant get away from the
                    mob s reach, keep them STed alternatively recasting it on
                    each of them. But ALWAYS have them PEed because if ST fails
                    they will jump on you, and then your pet on them, and that ll be
                    the end of the group. </font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">So basically, <b>PE
                    the mobs you want to control and chain cast ST on them</b>,
                    renewing PE every 30 secs more less for sefaty porpouses.
                    Both PE and ST burn little mana, so dont worry about
                    overcasting it.</font></p>

             <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course, if you are
             doing the chanter s job, you WONT be able to cast even one single
             DoT on the mob the group is with because of the ST s short duration.
             Anyway, the crowd control duty is the MOST important role in a

              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>What about your pet
              ? </b>If you see that your pet is actually difficulting your job
              because he keeps jumping on STed mobs, do NOT hesitate to type /pet
              get lost. An uncontrolled pet might easily kill the whole group
              !!&nbsp; Anyway, the pet is not that important for a crowd
              controller (how many high level enchanters do you see with their
              pets hanging around?). So, if you are able to keep your pet under
              control, let him be. If you dont, sacrifice him without a second
              thought.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;<b>Tip : </b>If
              you are hunting in dungeons with lots of undead like Karnor or
              Howling Stones, it might be more proffitable for you to not have
              any pet summoned in order to charm an undead creature. This will
              ease you mass control duties. Taking the same example as exposed
              above, lets say the puller brings a three mobs train, and one of
              those is undead. Well, just charm it and sick it to another one
              while the group deals with the third one. Recast undead charm
              every 20 secs and watch how they anul each other&nbsp; <b>:
              )&nbsp; </b>Of course, you have previously PE them both before the
              charming in case the charm gets resisted. I assure you will get
              nice praises from your group mates since its a very espectacular
              way to reduce a train down.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Tip 2 : </b>If any
              of the mobs is a caster, PE wont stop him from casting away his
              DDs on you (and then having your pet on him). If this is the case,
              PE him, destroy pet, and keep him STed at EVERY moment. Actually,
              the best thing you can do is to tell your group to ALWAYS kill
              first the casters, leaving the non casters under your good mezzing
              skills.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Tip 3 :</b> If the
              room is large enough (ie. Cheff room in Sebilis), you might want
              to park a mob aside using <i>Paralizing Earth</i>. PE lasts over 1
              minute, giving the group some time to deal with the rest of the
              mobs.</font></p>

             <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, I would like to
             warn you to not venture deep inside any dungeon without a propper
             enchanter. In spite of the fact that you do can mass control, ST
             has a too short duration to be feasible in nasty spots. So chose an
             easy room to camp and you ll do just fine.</font></p>
