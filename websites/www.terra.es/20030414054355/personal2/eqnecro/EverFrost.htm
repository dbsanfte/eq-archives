             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Right behind the
             newbie zone BlackBurrow, a vast and frozen land can be found. Its
             Ever Frost Peaks.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">This zone is mostly
             a high teens zone, where mamuts and orcs gave me a nice exp loooong
             ago&nbsp;<b> : )</b>.&nbsp; Anyway, we havent come here in a turism
             trip, have we? Ok then, leave the photo camera and the hawaiian
             design T-shirt aside and mem your spells up.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">We will be headed
             towards the east wall of the zone. Exact loc is +1900, -6200&nbsp;
             -take a look to the <b><a href="EverFrostMap.htm" target="_blank">map</a> </b>if you get lost-. Watch out for the
             barbarian NPCs, they scowl at you and they are <b>damn</b> tough. I
             was once hanging around there doing some buttscratching when I was
             lvl 52, and I decided to drop even more my Halas faction just for
             the hell of it. So I walked up there and pulled a barbarian guard.
             Well, he resisted my darkness, so I sent pet to him, and he
             resisted my darkness again. Hhmmm... a chilling nervousness ran
             thru me when the third cast got resisted. My pet was getting beaten
             badly so I decided to fear the bastard. Guess what? Exactly, got
             resisted. I Feigned Death right afterwards just to realize that
             they are almost 100% magic resistant. Same applies for the lvl 30
             named polar bear (<i>Iceberg</i>). So <i>Gather Shadows</i>
             yourself all the way till your destination.&nbsp;</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Now, we will be
             looking for some Ice Giants hunting. They are somewhere between lvl
             40 to 45, have around 5000 hp and hit for 110, so nothing really
             that you havent seen before. There are three spawns, all of them by
             the Permafrost zone entrance -check <b><a href="EverFrostMap.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>-.&nbsp;</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">You can make awesome
             exp in this zone if you get the twin spawn at the fortress
             entrance. Spawning time is 6 mins, so its fast indeed. I know of
             one necro friend of mine who made his way from 50 to 53 in 10 days
             !! no bullshitting here. Unfortunately, they are camped almost
             every second day. There is a third spawn inside the corridor too
             (blue crossed on <b><a href="EverFrostMap.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>).</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">I would recomend you
             to not let your pet to get kill, as opossed as what I told you in
             the <b><a href="BWpost50.htm">Burning Woods</a></b> zone section.
             Why? Cose you have to wait anyway 6 mins for the Giant to respawn,
             meaning no non-stop pulling here, so try at least to get full exp
             from each kill. In order to do 51%+ of the damage, and considering
             they have around 5000 hp, <i>Cascading Darkness, Splurt and Bond of
             Death</i> should be enough. Leave the rest for the pet while you
             sit down regenerating mana up with <i>Lich. </i>This specially if
             you got the twin spawn, and hence you dont want to burn too much
             mana.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Lets say you got the
             twin spawn (red crosses on <b><a href="EverFrostMap.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>). Dont worry to have them
             both aggroed on you cuz they are far enough to not to. Also, when
             you fear them off, they will tend to run thru the entrance towards
             the open fields, so no train risk at all.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">What about loot ?
             Giants in antonica have always been known for their excellent cash
             loot. Well, the Ice Giants top them all !! Up to 40 pp
             cash !!&nbsp; The only thing is that you ll be soon overloaded with
             coppers, silvers and golds. But dont worry, they is always a <i>banker</i>
             around (read a newbie who will run to Halas bank for a proffit).</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Im telling you, if
             you manage to get the twin spawn for your own, exp will definitely
             fly, and your platinum resources too. If, alternatively, only one
             spawn of all them three is available, Id rather be looking for a TP
             anywhere close to <b><a href="BWpost50.htm">Burning Woods</a></b>.</font></p>
