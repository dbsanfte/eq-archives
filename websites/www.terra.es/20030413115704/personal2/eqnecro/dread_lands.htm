      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">The Dread Lands zone is another huge high
      level outdoors zone of the newly discovered Kunark.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">The hunting thru lvls 39 - 44&nbsp; in
      Dread Lands will be most similar to Lake of ill Omen (lvl 20 to 25) and to
      the Overthere (lvl 34 to 39) expiriences : One certain spot where you
      should have you pet to guard, and a pulling area where you will pick up
      blue conning mobs from. Also, same <a href="strategies.htm"><b>Darkness -
      Fear technique</b></a> applies here. As you see, you will not face anything
      that you havent already mastered&nbsp; <b>: )</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">In Dread Lands, there are two hot spots
      where you can hunt fairly safe. Such areas are marked on the map with a
      blue coloured square ( see <b><a href="Dread%20lands%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>
      of Dread Lands). The red arrows mean that you should pull the mobs towards
      one very spot (where your pet faithfully waits for you).&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">Either the snowy area and the Karnor castle
      whereabouts should both be fine for your needs. The icy area will most
      likely be absolutely deserted and uncamped, so there is plenty of preys
      around there. So dont be fool and dont combat and fear the mobs as
      soon as you spot them. Drive them up the hill so no other monster will
      jump on you while fighting another, ok?.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">In the other hand, the Karnor
      castle s
      backgrounds are indeed camped by players in their 40s. If you preffer to
      team up, you will easily find a gang there, but if you would rather stick to
      your own and you get into problems you can always&nbsp; /yell out and
      somebody will help you promptly. Besides, SOWs and clarities are very easy
      to get here, and that is another bonus to count with, aint it?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF8000">So thats it. If you hunted in the
      Overthere zone few levels ago and you enjoyed it, then Dread Lands should
      be your next destiantion.</font>
