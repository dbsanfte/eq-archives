             <u><b><font face="Arial" color="#0066FF" size="4">The Ocean of
             Tears</font></b></u>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">The OoT is the see
             between Antonica and Faydwer, and the boat can be taken both at
             East Freeport docks or at Butcher Block Mountains. This time, you
             will be headed towards the seafury cyclops isle (see <b><a href="gargoyles_isle_map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>
             if needed).</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">The seafury cyclops
             are lvl 40ish and they are somewhere around 5000 HP, but they hit
             amazinly gently <b>: )</b>&nbsp; They max their blows for 76, which
             is what you were used to 10 levels ago !! Only concern here is a
             45ish named cyclop, Quag, who hits for 130. So, dont mess with him
             and hunting here will be a piece of cake.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Since the isle is
             quite small and quite packed with plenty of clops, I would tell you
             to get into a non-full group, maybe 2 or 3 of you will be enough. <a href="strategies.htm"><b>Darkness-Fear</b></a>
             gets a bit train-risky because there is not much space to perform
             your deathly combo. Best guys to team up with are ubdoubtly mages
             with their root-casting earth pet. So grab couple of friends an
             sail off to this island. I am sure exp will boost upwards. If you
             cannnot find any mage up to hunt seafuries, shop around for root
             casters such a wizzies and druids (and yourself among them). Root
             is very important because Fear gets way too risky here, so actually
             <b><a href="strategies.htm#4. Root - DoT combo">root-dot</a></b> is the only feasible technique here. You can try to the
             druid kitting along the sea side, but I personally believe that <b><a href="strategies.htm#4. Root - DoT combo">root-dot</a></b> is better. And <b>always</b> pull towards the beach, or
             I assure you that a second clop will join in.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">What about the loot?
             Up to 6 pp in cash and also some jewels that you can sell to
             vendors for good money.&nbsp;</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Most important of
             all is that after Kunark expansion was released, high level players
             have fleed over there, hence leaving this lovely area mostly
             uncamped. This means that if you are in a well balanced group with
             an experienced puller, you will never lack of preys to pull.</font> </TD>
