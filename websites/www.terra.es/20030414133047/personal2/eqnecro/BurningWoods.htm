             <font face="Arial" size="4" color="#0066FF">BurningWood</font>
             </u></b>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">This is anothere
             large high level outdoors zone in Kunark.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">There are several
             creatures you could hunt in your high 40s here, but I would advice
             you to go to the Forest Giants hut (check <b><a href="BurningWood%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a>
             </b>for the location) since this zone is heavily forested and hilly
             making visibility indeed limited, being the Giants outpost just a
             bit more open and hence less risky.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">These giants are
             similar to the ones you were hunting in <b><a href="frontier_mountains.htm">Frontier
             Mountains</a> </b>at your early 30s, just far tougher. There are
             four kinds of Giants in BurningWood: Arbor (lvl 30-35), Verdant
             (lvl35-40), Ancient (lvl 40-46) and the named Giant (lvl 44-47).
             The first two are easy to solo and I dont think your spells will
             get much resisted. The ancient may also be taken down by a high 40s
             necro, but it will burn most of your mana bar and might not be
             worthy. The named one is a bad ass : do not attempt to solo him
             because he has got loads of HP and max his blows up to 139 !!</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Also, few
             dragon-alike wurms, hornets and undead apes are roaming up and down
             thru the zone. I soloed my first wurm at level 47, and I was sooo
             close to kiss the dirt that my blood still chills when I remember
             that fight. They are not actually very dificult, nor they got high
             Magic Resistance, but they are well over 5000/6000 HP, and you can
             easily run out of mana in the middle of the combat. My advice it to
             leave alone both apes and wurms. Also, you will find some sarnaks
             and high level skelletons you can pull too, but ensure before
             pulling away that there is no other mob by, specially the apes
             since they tend to spawn within the same area.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">At Giants,
             everything is reasonably safe. You will be pulling the giants off
             the gate or even from inside the hut and deal with them few hundred
             feet away (check red coloured squares in the <b><a href="BurningWood%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>).
             As long as you stick to Arbors and Verdants, or Ancients once you
             have hit lvl 49, you will be fine. Of course if you decide to group
             up, pull everything around ( wurms, ancients and apes included ).</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">The loot is great
             here. They oftenly drop items worth up to 50 pp at vendors (axes,
             tunics, swords, gems, etc.). Only concern is that the closest
             vendor is in The Overthere zone, and their prices sucks. My tip is
             : Once you have looted several of these items and you are getting
             badly encumbered, ask to any wizard or druid hunting at that moment
             at Giants to TP you to Commonlands or Oasis where you will
             definately get much more money from the vendors. If you spend few
             levels hunting here, you will be few thousand plats richer, and
             thats always nice, isnt it?</font></p>
