             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Ok now, ButcherBlock
             is mainly the dwarves newbie zone. But since we necros are baddies,
             lets kick some dwarven asses&nbsp; <b>: )&nbsp; </b></font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">Like in any other
             newbie zone, there are several guards spread all over the zone. I
             have pointed out&nbsp; their posting cottages on the <b><a href="ButcherBlock%20Mt%20map.htm" target="_blank">map</a></b>.
             Some of those guards are low level who will con green for you. Some
             others are level 45 (the ones by Kaladim gates) and they are tough
             fellows. But there are some lvl 40 ones who spawn by two of them.
             That will be the target you are aimming to. I do not remember which
             of the guard spawns are actually the lvl 40 ones, so you will have
             to check that out by yourself <b> : )</b></font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">First of all, I
             would advice you to bring over a small party with you. Maybe three
             of you would be perfect. Why? Because these guys spawn by couples,
             and because they have a very high Magic Resistance. Main issue is
             that you would indeed have some problems to brake up the spawn if
             either Darkness or Fear are resisted, and that will most likely
             happend. Lets face it : you cannot handle two of these guards at
             once. That being said, and considering you are a cautious
             fella&nbsp; <b>: )</b>&nbsp; and will bring some guildmates along
             with you, read on.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">These guys havent
             got many HP ( about 3250 ) so they should not get you into any
             problems. Once you have broken the spawn, your group will run the spawn
             easily. In order to brake the spawn, get some distance and Fear one
             guard away, sick pet to the second one and <b><a href="strategies.htm">Darkness-Fear-Dot</a></b>
             him. Even DD him with lvl 44 ignite bones spells (check <b><a href="spells_list.htm">spells
             list</a></b> if needed) because sooner or later the Fear effects
             will wear off of the first guard and he will madly head his ass
             towards your very face !!&nbsp; Always keep an eye up on the first
             guard and be ready to recast Fear on him in case it wears off
             before you take the other one down. Once the spawn is broken, just
             use your timing sense so they wont spawn together again. If by any
             chance you are in a 6 guys full group, you might want to try to run
             2 spawns : killing the 2 guards in one certain hut, and afterwards
             running upon the next hut on the road to reapply the process. If
             your group is good enough, this can be <b>very</b> exp beneficial</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">And thats it. An
             easy way to level from lvl 45 up to 50 without taking a big risk
             (again, if you are in a small party).
             They drop 22 plats worth at vendors axes, but apart from that loot
             is not anything to dream of. And of course, no need to say that you
             will be as popular in Kaladim as Slodovan Milosevik in a NATO
             congress. But since you were already KoS there, who the hell cares.</font> </TD>
