			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Well, in my humble opinion, this is
				the most fun part of the game. Being able to size up your skills and powers
				with your same is an amazing experience, and you won&acute;t find that exciment
				( and nervousness) anywhere else in Norrath but when dueling. Also,
				you&acute;ll make mistakes that you wouldn&acute;t otherwise make in a mob
				fighting, and in a PvP, those mistakes mean most likely death.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">First of all, these PvP guide has been
				dessign on blue servers dueling enviorment rather than in actual PvP servers.
				In those ones, rules are compleatly different and some other tactics could
				apply.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The most important thing in duels is
				to keep in mind who are you about to fight against. <B><I> Every class needs a
				different combat strategy</I></B>, and you gotta adapt yourself (due to your
				wide spells range) to the enemy&acute;s class fighting way. Each class has got
				some weakpoints, and you must be smart enough to exploit them to the
				end.</FONT></P> 
			 <P>I<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">n the <B><A HREF="equipment.htm"
				TARGET="principal">equipment section</A></B> I stated that your main equipment
				issue would be to reach 200 Intelligence. Well, that&acute;s not 100% accurate
				when talking about dueling a spells caster class. Then, <B><I> magic resistance
				bonus items should be what you&acute;re looking for</I></B>. Heat and cold
				items too. Poison and Disease are important while dueling a Shaman or another
				necro.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Of course, no need to say that you
				should <B><I> cast everysingle buff and shielding spell you&acute;ve
				got</I></B> in your spell book on you. Also arm and buff your pet up, and med
				up both mana and HP till full.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">In spite of the fact that your pet is
				one of your main weapons in any monster-hunting, they won&acute;t be so crucial
				when dueling. Remember that your adversary is no brainless mob, and therefore
				he won&acute;t waste his time and HP dealing with your pet but you !!&nbsp; So
				<B><I> don&acute;t rely too much on your pet</I></B> and just consider him as
				one of your DoTs. And don&acute;t worry if the guy fights him and kills him.
				Believe me, that would be the best that could happen : a moron wasting his HP
				or mana against your pet. So, don&acute;t heal the pet and don&acute;t
				recast&nbsp; if he dies either unless you are full mana and you
             are hidden somewhere -pet summoning casting lasts over 10 seconds-.</FONT></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">I have tested all out DoT lines in

             fighters equal in level. The bigger is the level gap between both,
             the tougher to resist the spells :</font></P>

             <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is very important that before
             accepting the duel you try to lurk close to the guy and take a
             quick look to his gear. <b>Try to guess roughly his resist figures</b>
             (is he wearing blue diamond and diamond gear? is he wearing a
             specific item with high resist boost? etc). Now, <b>chose your DoTs
             depending on his gear</b> since necros got a wide range of
             possibilities. If you see that he is wearing a hell of a bunch of
             resist gear, then your only weapons should be lifetaps and pet. If
             you see that his resist figures are crap, always chose dissease and
             poison lines because they can't be dispelled.</font></p>

             <blockquote>
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>Tip :</B> As a necro, <B><I> you
				  need plenty of space to perform your powers</I></B>, no matter if hunting or
				  dueling, so only accept duels in open-field non-KoS zones. You&acute;ve been
				  warned. Main reason for this is because Shadow Step&nbsp; is one of our mayor PvP
                spells -specially against melee classes-, and it&acute;s only useful outdoors.</FONT></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>Tip 2 :</B> Before starting a
				  duel, <B><I>when you cast your buffs, don&acute;t cast the best ones at the
				  beginning</I></B>. Cast two or three shit ones (like grim aura, deadeye, etc.)
				  and then cast your valuable buffs (shieldskins, mayorshielding, spirit
				  armour,etc.). Once done this, cancel the shit ones (click on their symbols).
				  Hence you&acute;ll have few empty slots up at the top of your screen. What for?
				  Because in those empty slots where be placed your adversary&acute;s nasty
				  permanent spells (DoTs, root, blind, snare, etc) and since Cancel Magic spell
				  dispells one by one the spells from the top to the bottom, you won&acute;t need
				  to cancel all your lovely buffs in order to get rid of his DoTs.
                <b> This is very important</b>, it can safe your life when dueling against casters !!</FONT></P> 
                <P><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Tip 3 : </b>Against classes
                that have cancel magic spell, and specially at high levels when
                you can not start the duel with ST (above lvl 40-45 ST starts
                getting resisted very oftenly), I would recommend you to buff up
                your oponent before landing your lure DoTs with 2 fast buffs -<i>Impart
                Strengh</i> and <i>Spirit Armour</i> are perfect-. Why? Because
                if your oponent is smart, he will clean up the first two buff
                slots, being able to dispell your DoTs afterwards. If,
                alternatively, you refill those two slots with some silly buffs,
                the DoTs will placed at the bottom of his buff window, so he
                won't be able to dispell them unless he fully dispells himself.
                This is usefull only if you expect a long duel, like for example
                against druids and shamans.</font></P> 
              <P><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, try to focus on poison and
              disease based DoTs because those cannot be dispelled (only class
              that can is a shaman or also if you have shaman made potions).
              Unfortunatelly, poison and disease DoTs are easily resisted </font><b><font face="Arial" size="3">:(</font></b></P> 
				<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>Tip 4 :</B> Beware of tricky
				  players when dueling within zones with ponds, lakes, rivers or seaside. Why?
				  Because there is a bug (or I believe it to be a bug) about not being able to
				  cast on players underwater if you are outside, and viceversa. And this applies
				  even if only your feet are in the water. With this, they would step outside the
				  water, cast the hell on you and step back in afterwards when it&acute;s your
				  turn to cast away. No damage will be taken. If you notice any adversary playing
				  this game, shout it out loud and make him feel ashame of
				  himself.</FONT></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tip 5 : </b>Mostly,
                you ll see that I advice to open up the fights with Screaming
                Terror -check <b><a href="spells_list.htm">spells list</a></b>-
                hoping to <i>mezmerize </i>your oponent for a short lenght of
                time and therefore gaining few seconds to load DoTs on him.
                Well, this is only possible under two circunstances :</font></P>
                <ul>
                  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Your oponent is blue conning
                    or even white conning, never higher.</font></li>
                  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Your oponent s magic
                    resistance aint very high.</font></li>
                  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Neither of you are over level
                    40. Over lvl 40 the chances of <i>Screaming Terror, RooT,
                    Fear, Stun</i> etc are senssibly reduced.</font></li>
                </ul>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tip 6 : </b>Against pet
                classes, you <b>never</b> fight the pet. Never load DoTs and
                waste mana on them. Just <i>root</i> them aside or <i>fear</i>
                them away, but do not try to kill them. If the master dies, so
                the pet does, so keep focus'd on the master.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><a name="Tip 7">Tip 7</a> :</b>
              Remember that ST is mezmerize spell, meaning that it will brake
              off as soon as the target is inflicted any kind of damage. So,
              when you start up with ST, load first the longest casting DoT <b>without</b>
              initial DD damage (for example the <i>heat blood</i> series). Once
              landed, you got 6 seconds to land a second fast casting DoT (DoT's damage
              starts to deal damage away the tick after it lands, and 1 tick in
              EQ is 6 seconds). So, in those 6 seconds after landing the first
              DoT, you land your second DoT. By the time you land it, ST should
              be about to brake off due to the first's DoT damage tick. Having
              done this, the duel really starts having your oponent double
              dotted, and that might give you an edge.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tip 8 :</b> Once you have landed
              ST, you might want to <i>Root</i> the guy (specially if he is a
              melee) and load up not only 2 DoTs, but all of them.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tip 9 :</b> There is this
                lovely item called <i>Circlet of Shadows</i> (right click
                instant invisivility, drops in <i>Temple of Droga</i>). When you
                invis yourself in PvP, you will get removed from your
                adversary's target window unless he has got a <i>see invis</i>
                buff on or wearing a see invis effect item. This is specially
                usefull against casters, because you can cast on him, shadow
                step and invis up, not allowing him to cast back on you. They
                will have to re click on you, otherwise they will recieve the
                mesage &quot;you need to have a target in order to cast this
                spell&quot;. This is extremly useful against a wizard or another
                necro in a toe-to-toe nuking battle once your pet has been
                killed (invis poofs it) : Lifetap - <i>CoS</i> (he loses you as
                target and his casting drops down, he needs to re click on you
                wasting time) - lifetap - <i>CoS</i> - etc. By the way, this
                item has been nerfed lately, it is no longer instant but rather
                got a 5 secs casting time which makes it rather useless&nbsp; </font><b><font face="Arial" size="3">:
                (</font></b></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Tip 10 : </b>Never waste your
                time using our fire, dissease and poison debuffer (<i>Scent</i>
                spell line). It is useless indeed. It is poison based but it
                gets MORE resisted than the poison DoTs itself LMAO. So, if you
                cannot land the dissease/poison DoT itself, you won't land the
                debuffer either. Utterly and completly useless.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Tip 11 : </b><i>Shadow Step</i>
                is your main weapon againts casters. Please note that SS cannot
                positionate you at any higher Z axis figure than your original
                point. This means that, in order to teleport you farther away,
                you should run to a high spot (top of a hill for example) before
                casting SS.</font></p>

				called Shadow Step (check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm"
				TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for more info) which is a random

			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Don&acute;t accept the duel being any
				close to the adversary. Get plenty of space between you two. If the guy

				confused for few secs trying to spot you out. Now cast quickly the lvl 24 spell
				Screaming terror (check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm" TARGET="principal">spells
				list</A></B> for more info). Its a fast 2.5 secs casting spell, so you&acute;ll
				be able to cast it before the guy reaches up to you. It&acute;s a brief, short
				version of the enchanter&acute;s spell mesmerize. It makes the target to stand
				still for 10-15 secs without any control of himself (he won&acute;t cast, move
				or attack). In those 10-15 seconds, your job is to cast your
             best two DoTs on him (read <a href="#Tip 7"><b>Tip 7</b></a> above
             please). Afterwards, send pet on him and run away. Just run in circles untill the DoTs wear off. Some other
				necros would try to Fear the guy away, but in my own experience Fear gets
				resisted much more often when dueling than in normal combats, I
             am not sure why.
				Once the DoTs effect has worn off, wait for him to get close to you and cast
				once more Shadow Step. Again, he&acute;ll be desorientated and you will have

				smart ass and therefore you win!! If, by fluke, the guy finds your lair, Shadow
				Step and run the hell far away (with the lad chasing you several yards behind).
				Say you get to the other corner of the zone. Just shadow step again and gate

			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If during the duel, he gets on you

				and away from you, and you&acute;ll win. Don&acute;t cast DD spells or lifetaps
				(this only if really needed) since tank classes have loads of HP and
				you&acute;ll need your whole mana bar in order to cast DoTs (more mana

				important not to let them hit you, &acute;cause they grease their weapons with

				shapeless bloody pulp on the floor.&nbsp;</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok now, stop it, don&acute;t bray

				(healing, cancel magic). So I&acute;m affraid we&acute;ll have to be quite
				agressive this time. Let&acute;s just hope he hasn&acute;t got a high Magic

				DoTs, forget about minor ones. Now, in order to have him away of Cancelling our
				DoTs, cast fear and lets hope it holds on him. Ok now, if it does stick to him,
				you&acute;ve got about 10 secs to deal large amount of damage :&nbsp; cast
				Shock of Poison (lvl 24 spell, check <B><A HREF="spells_list.htm"
				TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for more info) the hell away few times.
				Then, stand still and reapply Fear even if it hasnt woren off. And again DD him few times, recast Fear, and again burn all
				your mana on him. I know this is not the way a necro should play since our DD
				are not very mana efficient, but there&acute;s no other way to fight this guy.
				He has got just too many HP (considering several healings,
             cancel magic and Lay on Hands). <b>
				Actually, if you let him use his healing skills, it&acute;s like if you had to
				take down three times his whole HP bar, and you just haven&acute;t got that much of
				mana.</b></FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">In the other hand, let&acute;s say he
				got free of our Screaming Terror and Fear spells and he&acute;s on us.
             Like any other tank class, he needs to mellee in
				order to win. So, once more, if he has rooted or blind us, Shadow Step will be
				our best deffence (shadow step macro'd in a hot key of course).</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Let&acute;s say you have done a good
				job and you eventually inflict lots of damage to him, but, in the last moment
				he resorts to Lay on Hands and gets his HPs bar back to full. Of course, after
				such a combat you&acute;ll be low on mana. Well, don&acute;t worry, use the
				previous explained tacnic to Gate to a hidden spot (see <I><B><A
				HREF="#1. Dueling a warrior-rogue">how to duel a warrior-monk-rogue
				section</A></B></I> above). Then med up HP and mana, and of course let him do
				the same. Then, let&acute;s start the combat again, only difference is that now
				he won&acute;t be able to use LoH because it can be used only once every 70
				minutes.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The main issue while fighting paladins
				would be to have them under the effects of Fear so
				they can&acute;t use Cancel Magic nor healing spells, and meanwhile let DoTs
				run thru them and blast them down very quickly. Another tip is to have all your
				spells macroed in hot-buttons, so if they happen to blind us, we&acute;ll know
				which keyboard to hit for the beloved Shadow Step and Gate spells.</FONT></P>

             <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Shadow knights are and hybrid class, a
				cross between a necro and a warrior. They usually have our same spells, just 2
				circles later (at lvl 29 they get most of our lvl 20 spells including pet).
				This makes them, in my opinion, absolutly useless casters. Only thing that can
				irritate you is the Fear spell, but do not worry much about their pet (yours
				will destroy his very quickly) or attacking spells (they will fight you with
				Heat blood when you&acute;ve got boil blood, or even venom of the snake.
				Anyway, have Cancel Magic ready against his minor DoTs) or even their Shadow
				Step ( we are no mellee class, so no need for us to get toe to toe with them).
				So, this leads us to a mellee class with <i>fear</i>, <i>cancel
             magic, lifetaps</i> and <i>Harm Touch</i>.</FONT></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">The main problem with Shadow Knights
             is the fucking <i>Harm Touch</i>. It does indeed get nasty. Just
             for your information, a lvl 60 SK's Harm Touch deals 1000 hp
             instant damage, and if they decide to proc an offensive discipline,
             it climbs up to 1500 hp !! As you can see, one of those shots will
             painfully halve your health.&nbsp;</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">So, what would a smart SK do? he
             would fear your pet away, mess around with you for a while in
             melee, maybe some minor DoTs, maybe some lifetaps here and there,
             etc. And whenever you let your health bellow half... BANG!!... a
             freaking <i>Harm</i> &quot;torpedo&quot; <i>Touch</i> on your butt
             killing you right in the spot. Trust me on this one: <b>You never
             let your health drop under 60% against a SK because that is
             exactlly what he will be waiting for.</b></font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">IMO, the best way to beat a SK is
             kitting them with Shadow Step and with fast casting lifetaps.
             Dispell your self which ever minor DoTs they land on you (mainly
             the darkness and heat DoTs), and try to land a poison/dissease DoT
             yourself. Your pet will tear his apart very fast so he will also
             have to waste few secs fearing it away. Also, you must keep cancell
             magic ready to dispell your pet in case the SK fears him (which he
             will) because you will need him as damage source or else you will
             run out of mana eventually.</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Remember, the main point is to keep
             your life always over 60% due to <i>Harm Touch</i>, so it might be
             a good idea to lifetap dot him too. Even if he dispells himself,
             you still get healed up.&nbsp;</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>My main concern while dueling a
             SK pre 49</b> (<i>Lich</i> and <i>Bond of Death </i>are 49 spells
             and they plain rule) <b>is that you might run out of mana before
             the SK bites the dust</b>. Lets not forget that a SK has got a
             bunch of HP and he self heals himself with lifetaps too. It's
             pretty much the same than fighting a Pally, despite SK are rather
             more offensive and Pally more deffensive. Of course, you will have
             your highest Lich line spell up all the time. As I said, you will
             indeed need extra mana for this fight.</font></P>

				and will run away willing you to follow them, hence having your ass far away
				from your pet-bodyguard. Or, alternatively, they&acute;ll snare you down and
				run away with your pet on them to kill him easily away from his master. Do not
				play the druid&acute;s game, don&acute;t chase them. But if he does get to SoW
				himself away with your pet on his back, just dispell snare with Cancel Magic
				and run in the oposite direction !!. Have your pet in the target screen (hit F1
				button twice) and whenever the pet dies, sit down, memorice pet spell and
				recast a new one. Cast your highest HP-to-mana transfer spell ( check the <B><A
				HREF="spells_list.htm" TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for mor info),
				sit down, re-memorize your previous spell and wait till full mana. By the time

             there, and run back to you. With this, when his root brakes free,

             his buffs. Also call your pet off if he is pulling him away from
             you as above mentioned. Once you have dispelled his buffs, dispell

             still and watch what he does. He will probably root/snare your pet.

             of him again. Keep on doing this dance (he roots/snares pet and you

             a nasty effect : right click mana free <i>Drones of Doom</i>, a
             lure (hardly resistable) magic based 340 hp DoT in 60 secs. I know
             that 340 hp doesnt sound much for a post lvl 50 player, but the
             main issue is that it is mana free!! Remember that I said that a
             necro Vs. druid duel is all about mana managment? well, this item
             could unbalance the whole thing!!.</font></p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Probably you will have to take a
             more offensive role since they will be mana free inflicting you
             damage and that would mean than in the long term you might be OOM
             yourself from just cancelling magic the <i>Drones of Doom</i> DoT.
             You will have to relly on your pet more in order to inflict damage,
             and in order to waste his mana too forcing him to chain cast root
             on your pet. Please note that druid's root is the best root in game
             because it also inflicts some damage on your pet (it's root + minor
             DD), so eventually you will have to recast a new pet (lvl 49 pet is
             the best because its got lots of HP plus its mana cheap).&nbsp;</font></p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This fight will take ages, and due
             to that DoT you will be burning lots of mana yourself (dispelling <i>Root</i>
             off your pet, dispelling item DoT from yourself, recasting new
             pets, and lifetapping back the health lost to <i>Lich</i>), while
             the druid would only have to waste his mana rooting pet (<i>root</i>
             is mana cheap spell by the way). It is really difficult to know
             whether Lich will regen your mana fast enough to keep up with this
             mana burning, but I can assure you that a druid with this <i>Elder
             Spiritist's Vambraces </i>is indeed quite an adversary.</font></p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Anyway, don't go mad and don't try
             to kill him fast with offensive spells because his healing spells
             are way more mana efficient than your lifetaps (he will dispell non
             poison/dissease DoTs and poison/dissease DoTs themselves will get
             resisted depending on druid's gear).</font></p>

				Terror, 2 DoTs (Poison and Disease
             prefered. This will be enough to kill
				them), and your highest lifetap. An experienced
				wizzie would cast stun first on us, and then deal with the pet later. But, if
				your pet has been fully buffed and armed up, he&acute;s got the chance to keep

				you see that something like that is going on, just run to the farthest corner
				and wait for them to seek you, and belive me they will if you have DoTed them.</FONT></P>

             (which he most likely will) since all of enchanter's spells are

             probably win :</font></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Before accepting a duel with an
				enchanter, you better know him as a honourable adversary. I mean, enchanters
				with charm spell can really do evil PvP duels. I&acute;ve seen enchanters
				charming the other guy as a pet, casting levitate on themselves, and walk you
				to the middle of any lake for a &acute;swim&acute;. Of course, they
				didn&acute;t cast levitate on you so you drown. Or even worse, to a lava pit,
				where you won&acute;t ever be able to recover your toasted corpse back !! Or
				what about having you to jump off a cliff? Also, they can charm your butt and
				have it to punch that bulky grimmy-looking red conning guard. All these ways of
				dueling are extremly evil since you&acute;ll definately lose exp, and since no
				server-wide message will be typed proclaming the enchanter of any duel. If you
				ever are target of any of these shits, petition it straight away. Do not let it
				go. If many people report this unfair duels, Verant will undoubtly nerfed down
				Charm spell in duels (they have already done so in PvP servers, pretty much
				like our Fear spell), and that&acute;s the way it should be. </FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok now, let&acute;s consider the
				enchanter is a fair player. Still they are the toughest PvP class in game in my
				opinion. They&acute;ve got mesmerize, stun, manatap spells (same as our lifetap
				spells, but mana tapping), powerfull DD spells, Fear, blind, Nullify Magic,
				pet, Charm, buffs, Magic Resistance debuffer, etc.</FONT></P> 
             <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">First of all, it&acute;s most
				important when dueling to enchanters to have a high Magic Resistance bonus gear
				because of their Magic Resistance debuffer Tashani spell, and hence you
				won&acute;t resist any of their spells.&nbsp;Also, it would be
             usefull if you <i>Cancel Magic</i> them because they buff
             themselves with Magic Resist buff (not good because our ST and Fear
             spells are magic based) and Rune (damage absorb spell, like our
             shieldskin spells).</FONT></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Let me explain how enchanters
             duel</b>. Most of the enchanters follow the same pattern while
             openning up duels : they stun you, they mezmerice your pet and then
             they mezmerice you afterwards, they slow your pet (he will hit much slowlier),
             they mana sieve you (spell that &quot;steals&quot; your mana), they
             remezmerice you and your pet, they keep lowering your mana, they
             eventually summon a pet, buff him up with haste and they send it to
             you finishing you off with few nukes (dont understimate enchanter's
             nukes, they are not bad at all).</font></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">We have only one very way to win
				enchanters in duels : Fear spell. I know I have told you that is far too often
				resisted, but believe me, no other way around against this fellows. Now, the
				first seconds of the duel will determine the winner, no doubt about that.
				It&acute;s important to know the different ways enchanters open up the duel :
				a) with Tashani debuffer. b) casting the 2.5 secs long casting mesmerize spell
				on you. c) stun
				spell (takes only 1 secs to be cast away and stuns you for fews
				secs).</FONT></P>

				  that second they waste casting Tashani, is your only chance to hold your Scream
				  Terror on them. ST lasts only about 15 secs, so cast the highest Fear spell you
				  have to prolong their lack of control on themselves. Now, cast your 2 highest
				  DoTs (the quickest to perform their total damage. Lvl 34 spell Venom of the
				  snake is perfect bacause it cannot be dispelled) and chain cast Shock of Poison till you kill him. Trick is to

                enchanters). Pray
				  you are quicker, or you&acute;ll be in deep shit. They&acute;ll probably suck

				by step, and between steps hit the screaming terror button. Once you have
				landed it on him, you&acute;ve got few seconds to cast Fear till it holds, and

             <P><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Shamans are one of toughest
             classes to duel as a necro</b>. They got problems against some
             classes that a necro should never lose againt, but they are
             extremly well equipped against us. You might be now scratching your
             head asking why. The reasson is that <b>our DoTs are virtually
             useless against them</b>: they got dissease and poison resist
             buffs, and on top of all they got cancel magic, cure disease and
             cure poison. This means that no matter what DoT we land on them
             (either magic, heat, poison or dissease based DoTs), he will be
             able to dispell them for dirt cheap mana as long as he keeps his
             head cool and thinks clear. Due to this, if you are about to duel
             an experienced shaman, dont even bother to mem your DoTs because
             you will burn your whole mana bar wihtout making a dent on his
             health bar.</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Also, shamans got our very same
             poison and disease DoTs (some say that necromancer class
             &quot;borrowed&quot; them from shamans), and some powerful cold
             based nukes too. Since poison and disease are easier to resist that
             cold, I would advice you to try to raise up your PR and DR when
             fighting a shamy. Check out the chart above listed and you will see
             that with as little as 70 PR-DR you should almost be inmune to his
             posison and dissease DoTs considering equal lvl. But beware!!
             Shaman's <i>malise</i> spell series decrease all resistance a nice
             deal and it is lure (very tough to resist), so you will definitelly
             need more that 70 RD-PR. Anyway, if he casts <i>malise</i> on you,
             cancel it off with <i>cancel magic</i> right away (remember to
             leave first few buff slots open). If you are in your pre 50 lvls
             and therefor you dont have a healthy wallet try to gather up few
             cheapo items with DR-PR boost like stein of moggok (DR+25), green
             silken drape (PR+15), etc, or if you are in your post 50s you
             should already have a full set of blue diamond jewelery set.</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Since you cannot use your DoTs to
             beat him, and since you will run oom before killing a shammy with
             lifetaps (always remember that in PvP heals are more mana efficient
             than lifetaps), <b>you will have to rely on your pet as damage
             dealing source</b>. The shaman will of course root it aside and <i>Cancel
             Magic</i> will become your best friend. Also you will have to take
             care of his pet if he summons one.</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Ok, the duel starts!! Send your pet
             against his pet. ST the shaman and Fear him right away. If those
             spells get resisted he probably have buffed himself with <i>resist
             magic</i>. If this happens you might be in trouble because shamans
             are the king of buffs, and if he isn't stupid I bet he would first
             buff himself with a bunch of silly buffs (increase STR, increase
             AGI, etc) and then the good buffs afterwards. This means it would
             take you ages to get to the useful buffs and thats not good. My
             advice if he resists ST and fear couple of times is not to try
             anymore and do the following:</font></P>

             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">High
             level shamans are indeed one of the toughest adversaries for a necro. They
             have problems against high magic resistant melees because they can't <i>Shadow
             Step</i>, and if the tank has got <i>J Boots</i>, their <i>SoW</i>
             becomes almost useless.&nbsp;</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Why is it that shamans are so tough
             at high levels?&nbsp; mostly because they all got a lovely bracer called
             <i>
             Jaudiced bone bracer</i> (AC14, effect: unlimited mana free right
             click 260 cold based DD, 8 secs casting time,
             dropped in <i>Sebilis</i>). So what do they do? They root your pet with
             Paralizing Earth and wait for you to DoT em. Then they would dispell and heal
             themselves,
             renewing Paralizing Earth on your pet every while. Eventually the
             both of you run OOM (you landing DoTs / lifetapping on him and he
             dispelling and healing himself). Once this has happend, they root
             your pet one last time and nuke you down to death with the mana
             free bracer's nuke.&nbsp;</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Basically, in my opinion, <b> the only
             way to beat a high lvl shaman is to have awesome saves vs poison, disease</b> and cold. And I really mean awesome.
             Poison and dissease are easy to beef over 100 each, so no problem
             there, but the bloody bracer's nuke is another story. Even with 150
             CR you will not resist it.
             Sorry, but thats the cold truth (hehe speaking about cold).&nbsp;Anyway,
             the main resists you should look at are PR and DR undoubtly.</font></P> 
             <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But lets say you do have enough Sv
             cold, poison and disease gear to resist his spells. Do not bother
             no cast any of your DoTs on him, he will dispell em all. Your main
             weapon will be your pet, so save up&nbsp; your mana for <i>Anul
             magic</i> on your pet once the shamy has landed <i>paralizing earth</i>
             on him or even
             to recast pet if he dies.&nbsp;Be smart, <b>don't burn your mana</b>
             and do what I said <b><a href="#Fear shaman's pet.">few lines above</a></b>:
             fear his pet off, let your own pet deal the damage for you, and
             have <i> Cancel Magic</i> handy to dispell your pet or you (he might click
             his epic on you, which effect is our <i>splurt</i> DoT with just
             another cheesy name).</font></p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The shamy will try to cast his
             highest <i> malosi</i> (debuffer) spell on you. At high levels thats
             -45 to
             all saves !! Of course, you'll have your first few slots on the
             buffs screen empty to dispell whatever he lands on you promptly.</font></p>
             <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I dont know, but even if you get to
             resist his spells and his bracer's nuke, I'd still say the shaman
             is one of the toughest adversary a necro could face. It will all
             depend on whether you can keep your pet on the shaman chain <i>Cancel

			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Fool players would state that a cleric
				would never be a good PvP class. Smart ones would give it a second thought
				before accepting the duel against a cleric, specially us necros due to the
				cleric&acute;s spells vs undead (either fear or DD vs undead) that can push our
				pet out of the game inmideately.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The reason many people say clerics are
				weak duelers is because their offensive spells aren&acute;t that powefull.
             So
				where&acute;s the catch? They have <i> stun</i> spell and blind spell (both very quick
				casting spells, 1.5 secs). On top of that they&acute;ve got root, loads of
				deffensive buffs (like for example our Harmshield, check <B><A
				HREF="spells_list.htm" TARGET="principal">spells list</A></B> for more info)
				and specially healing spells that heal their health bar up for large amounts of
				HPs. I remember first time I dueled a cleric : I would keep renewing on him my
				very painful heavy mana DoTs, and he would keep dispelling and healing himself
				up. Eventually I run out of mana and he took me down in melee
				combat!!!</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">They will probably open up the battle
				with the fast casting stun spell, then either root or fear the pet off, then
				walk into melee distance (where they would beat us everyday), then back off for
				a sec and re-stun, followed by a quick healing, and back again into melee after
				renewing root on pet. Also, they would try to blind us just in case we have
				been foolish enough not to have set up your spells macroed in hot buttons. And
				from time to time, cast a reasonably harmful DD spell.</FONT></P> 
             <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Since <i> Screaming Terror</i> takes slightly
				longer to cast than stun, again I&acute;d advice you to <i> Shadow Step</i> first
				willing to both confuse the cleric and wasting some of his time trying to spot
				you out. Of course, if after casting SS you&acute;re still inside the casting
				distance range, hit hard the <i> Screaming Terror</i> spell button, followed by
             <i> Fear</i>
				till it holds on him. Then send pet on him (or cast <i>Cancel
             Magic</i> on him if he was rooted aside) and chain cast <i>Fear</i>
             on the cleric every 10 secs, letting the pet deal the damage. If
             for some reasson Fear won't hold on him, follow the <b><a href="#Fear shaman's pet.">same
             tactic</a></b> as againt the shaman: chain <i>Cancel Magic</i> on
             your pet.</FONT></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Remember, the trick against all
             these healing classes (cleric, druid, shaman and Paladin) is mana
             managment because, once again, heals are more mana efficient than
             offensive spells when it comes to PvP.</font></P> 
             <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Not as hard as enchanters are, but
				still a cleric can be a tough fellow. Don't burn your mana, play
             with your pet and everything will be all right.</FONT></P>

             <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Ok, bards got their song one by one
             each level. This means that the bard that you are fighting might
             not have all the songs that I name here. But, for the sake of
             argument, I will assume that he is has got them all ok? Anyway, my
             advice is to check a bard's song list at any bard website (<b><a href="http://www.eqdiva.com" target="_blank">www.eqdiva.com</a></b>
             for example) and make a list in advance of whatever songs that mate
             of yours that is itching you the wrong way has got before proposing him
             the /duel.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
			 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Anyway, since bards are a very
             versatile class, they can adopt many startegies. I will assume the
             bard knows what he is doing, so the way a good PvP bard should and
             would fight is as follows (I got a post 55 bard myself, I know what I'm talking
             about here):</font></P>
			 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">Your first disadventage you got
             against a bard is that they don't use mana, meaning that they could
             keep it up for hours while you cannot (you just don't have that
             much of mana, dont you?). The second disadventage is that they
             regen HP faster than you regen mana. Your thrid disadventage is
             that if the bard so wishes, you could never touch him due to his
             level 5 <i>Selo's Accelerando</i> speed song (faster than SoW). The
             forth disadventage is that your pet is useless in this fight.</font></P>
			 
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2">A PvP experienced bard would
             always boost up his dissease and poison resists, and he would have
             cancel magic ready for you magic and heat DoTs. This pretty much
             screws you all the way (like against shamans) because your DoTs are
             indeed useless against them. But now here comes the best part !! <b>there
             is this bug in EQ's PvP system which makes your pet poof away if
             the bard charms it and dispells it afterwards.</b> When a charmed
             pet regains control of itself, it kinda gets fucked up and just
             poofs!! This also works with any kind of charm in PvP, even our
             undead charm (try it if you duel a necro). Soooo, DoTs are useless
             and so is pet. Hhmmmm..... ain't looking good, does it?</font></P>
			 
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2">That is right folks. If you face a
             non talented bard your would have no problems killing him (he will
             try to snare-fear you, keep your pet mezzed, dotting you while
             running around, blah
             blah, piece of cake), but if the guy is literate, you cannot kill
             him in outdoors zones. I repeat, <b>you <u> cannot</u> kill a bard in an
             outdoors duel</b>. Why? Very simple. This is how good bards duel : <b>They
             purely exhaust your mana pool</b>; First they of course poof your
             pet off with the <i> charm</i> + <i> cancel magic</i> trick. Then they dispell some
             of your DoTs -lure ones-, they resist some others -poison, disease-, they do some melee damage, they
             maybe even land few DoTs and DDs on you, etc etc etc. Meanwhile,
             you will be forced to do the typical Shadow Step + lifetap melee
             kitting in order to heal yourself and to deal some damage. Ok, so
             far so good, but....</font></P>
			 
             <P><font face="Arial" size="2">But..... whenever their health is
             dropping down, they will fire up <i>Selo's</i> speed song, get the
             hell out of casting range and start singing HP regen song (or chain
             click on <i>Singing Steel BP</i> if they got it, which regens
             100ish hp every 6 secs). Of
             course you cannot run after him because he is like three times
             faster than you, so you can only stare at him escaping away, sit your
             butt down and med some mana up with <i>Lich</i>. But remember when I said that they
             regen HP much faster than you regen mana even with your highest <i>Lich</i>
             spell up? well, they bloody do I'm afraid. By the time you regen
             one bub and a half of mana, he will be full of health and will
             trigger his tracking window up. Guess who will be the target? Bingo!!
             your sorry ass. So, he is full HP again, you are now petless and

                  that I said run away. Don't stay hidden cuz he'll get to you
                  within seconds due to their tracking and archery skills. The

                  they?). When you notice that he is far away healing up, cast
                  call of bones, lich or whatever you got and sit down to med.

             records, the highest dmg critic score with <i>true shot</i> disc I

             don't even need to chase you around. They would root your pet,
             activate the disc, and nuke you down from distance.</font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF8000" size="2">If you notice that
             he has proc'd it up (and believe your health bar <b>will </b>notice
             it), <i>Shadow Step</i> the hell away and run (SoW potions are a <b>must</b>)
             to the other very corner of the zone. <b>The disc lasts for 2
             minutes</b>, so basically your only way of survival is to keep
             yourself out of arrow range. <i>Shadow Step</i> and <i>SoW</i>
             potions will be your best friends. Remember not to stand still once
             you have lost sight of him, he will track you down. Just keep

				about to fight your brother-in-believes, aren&acute;t you? I can&acute;t really
				give you any advice when dueling a nec because your adversary will already know
				all your tricks. Only thing I&acute;ll tell you is to open up with Screaming
				Terror. Not all necros use this lovely spell while dueling. This is because they don&acute;t
				know how to duel with their own character. Land ST on him, ST or
             <i>fear</i>
             his pet, call your pet back with /pet back off, load one DoT on the
             other necro, send pet to your
             adversary with /pet attack, and chain cast the
				highest lifetap you&acute;ve got on your spell book.&nbsp;</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Most of the times, while dueling
				another necro, pets nullify each other and everything turns out a lifetapping
				battle between the masters. If you have DoTed him in advance, that extra damage
				will lift you as the winner. If in the middle of the battle you see that you
				are loosing while lifetapping, cast a Harmshield, wait for him to cast few
				times on you (burning valuable mana) and cancel the invulnerability (left click
				on the symbol) just right afterwards his spell has harmlessly landed on you,
				and straight away lifetap him back.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Not really much else to say. You know
				how a necro works, just figure out the way to anull him. But you&acute;ll see
				by yourself how everything will eventually turn into a non-stop lifetapping
             each other. In
				this chaos, if you have ST and DoTed him before, you shouldn&acute;t
             lose this
				duel mate.</FONT></P> 
			 <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If, in the other hand, he has cast
				nasty DoTs on you and there&acute;s no way you can keep on with the battle,
				Shadow Step away, Cancel Magic the magic based DoTs. Then Lifetap some
				low level zone inhabitants to regen some HP back and med with
             Lich (or whatever version you got) till he finds you out.</FONT></P>

             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">High level necro duels mainly depend
             on lifetaps and pet control.&nbsp;</font></P> 
             <P><font size="2" face="Arial">At the beginning of the fight both
             of you will try to anul each other's pet with ST or <i>fear</i> (ST
             is better IMO; for some reason fear wears off just too quickly).
             So, before accepting the duel, have his pet targeted and start off
             ST'ing it. He has probably done the same to yours, so you have to
             really fast double hit F1 button (targets your pet) and cast <i>anul
             magic</i> on him. Your pet will jump on your adversary who will ST
             it once again (probably eating up some beating in the proccess).
             Don't hesitaste one second and re-<i>anull magic</i> your pet and
             re-apply ST on the other guy's pet. The idea is chain dispelling ST
             (or <i>fear</i> or <i>root</i> or whatever) off your pet and
             renewing ST on his pet every 2 dispells. Doing this he will little
             by little eat up some damage from your pet and you will keep his
             pet off of your butt. Once his health is, let's say, half down,
             re-ST one last time his pet and chain cast your highest lifetap (<i>touch
             of night</i> better than <i>deflux</i> in a one to one lifetapping
             battle) on him.&nbsp;</font></P>
