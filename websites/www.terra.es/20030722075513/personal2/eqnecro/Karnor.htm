             <P><font face="Arial" size="2">Karnor's Castle -<i>KC</i> from now
             on- is settled in the eastern part of the vast DreadLands (check <b><a href="Dread%20lands%20map.htm">DreadLands
             map</a></b> if needed).</font></P> <P><font face="Arial" size="2">KC
             is, toghether with <i>Old Sebilis</i>, the most popular post 50
             dungeon in game, specially for player in the low 50s range. Once
             you hit 56 or higher, some of its inhabitants (lower level dogs and
             some undeads) will turn green so either you venture deeper inside
             the dungeon or you might want to move your headquarters to Sebilis.</font></P> <P><font face="Arial" size="2">So,
             what about KC? This dungeon is one of the wildest zones around,
             with plenty of furious doggies traing the hell outta people. In a
             way, this place reminds me of <b><a href="blackburrow.htm">BlackBurrow</a></b>
             : outdoors dungeon, similar canine mobs and a central train
             station&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>: )&nbsp; </b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">And
             the loot? well, being honest there are not many necro orientated
             items in this dungeon. Most of 'em are melee gear (<i>Jade Mace</i>,
             <i>Cobalt</i>, <i>Mrylokar</i>, <i>Blood Ember</i> and <i>Deepwater</i>
             armour pieces, <i>Noctavigant blade</i>...)&nbsp; and wis casters
             gear (<i>Donals</i>, <i>Jaudiced bone</i> and <i>Elder Spirit</i>
             armour pieces, <i>Springwood club</i>...). The only necro armour
             set is the <i>Flyed Skin</i> armour, but you probably have better
             stuff by the time you can hunt here.</font></P> <P><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway,
             the main reasson to group up in KC is to build up some social
             faction with your server's high level guys comunity in case you
             hadnt been grouping much pre 50, like me. Why do I say this?
             Because post 54 soloing in dead, and you will most likely level up
             those post 55 levels in Old Sebilis, and if you dont build up a
             nice reputation with the rest of the players you will have a hard
             time trying to find group. So my advice is to come here moreless
             oftenly to group and let yourself pratice your <b><a href="Necro%20in%20group.htm">skills
             in a high level group</a></b>. That being said, if what you really
             want is <b>fast</b> exp, go solo in <b><a href="BWpost50.htm">Burning
             Wood</a></b>, or at least I'd personally leveled up quite fast in
             there.</font></P> <P><font face="Arial" size="2">KC follows the
             same structure like many other dungeons : Find a balanced group, <i>/shout</i>
             for a camp check, see what rooms are open, and camp them for both
             exp and loot with the tank pulling the whereabouts. KC has got lots
             of &quot;rooms&quot; to camp, each of them with a certain type of
             mobs and loot. You will find this information in the <b><a href="KarnorMap.htm" target="_blank">KC
             map</a></b>.</font></P> <P><font face="Arial" size="2">Overall, I'd
             say hunting in KC is pretty safe because <i>SoW</i> and <i>J.Boots</i>
             can be cast here (remember, it's an open dungeon), so basically if
             you see yourself in deep poo, just hit the <i>HarmShield</i> hotkey
             (check <b><a href="spells_list.htm">spells list</a></b> if needed)
             and run to zone as fast as your <i>SoW</i>'d feet alow you. When I
             say that KC is safe, I mean that you are not supossed to die here
             as oftenly as you would in, say, Lguk or Sebilis where the exit is
             miles away and without any <i>SoW</i> or <i>J.Boots</i>. But in no
             way in hell I'm qualifying this zone as cake : trains are <b>nasty</b>
             here, and you and your party will probably have to zone over to
             DreadLands ( &quot; <i>/shout Train to zone !!</i> &quot; hotkey
             applies here ) quite oftenly.</font></P> <P><font face="Arial" size="2">Sometimes,
             if you are bored of grouping or if you can't find any, you might
             want to try to solo here. Even though it is not exp feasible (you
             will not get even half exp than in a group), I find indoor soloing
             extremely funny&nbsp; </font><b><font face="Arial" size="3">: )</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;
             You got two ways to solo in KC :</font></P>

                solo (mainly because, as I said, with SoW up is fairly safe as
                long as you pull your preys to a quite spot). Procedure in the
                following order : Paralizing Earth, few DoTs, Dooming Darkness
                (for safety reassons), renew PE, sit down and lich. Reapply
                spells as needed.&nbsp;</font></P> <P><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>2.&nbsp;
                Undead charming</b> solo : Charm an undead ( <i>Thrall of bones</i>
                spell, check <b><a href="spells_list.htm">spells list</a></b> if
                needed) and toss it to another mob. If you see that your new pet
                is winning the battle, don't do anything apart from rooting the
                other mob and renewing the charm every while (our charm spells
                dont last long, or at least in my personal experience). If,
                alternatively, our pet is dropping fast, land one or two fast
                DoTs on the mob. The point of this technique is to let your
                charmed pet kill the mob while leaving him very hurt himself.
                Now, you just FD (to brake charm), stand up, root and land <i>Splurt</i>.
                That should be enough to kill him. Basically, you got two kills
                with very little mana. You can find plenty of undeads to charm
                in both courtyards and upstairs in the towers -see <b><a href="KarnorMap.htm" target="_blank">KC
                map</a></b> to locate it-.</font></P>
