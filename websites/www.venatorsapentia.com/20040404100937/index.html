So, because I'm too lazy to fix some issues I'm having with uploading my screenshots, my updates take forever.  A lot of the pictures on the page are broken because of a "hosting mishap" that I will hopefully get corrected soon.<BR><BR>

Anyway, to get the people who are keeping track up to date on where we are:  We killed Quarm.  That was two weeks ago.  Last week, we plowed throguh time and even the "walling" issues did not stop us from killing everything up to Quarm.  Quarm, however, decided he liked to warp all over the place and did not allow us to kill his four headedness.  So, we'll just have to wait until next week.
<BR><BR>
On a monk note, we finally got a Staff of Transcendence and a Ton Po's mystical Pouch.  Grats to Yonyac (SoA) and Piouss (IS) on the Staff and Pouch respectively.  I was glad to see that Time decided to finally give up some monk loot! ;)
<BR><BR>
Lopeclaw had a field day of looting and I can't even keep track on what all he got.  I know that if I hadn't looted a few items I would have more ELP than him...but alas, I decided to loot into negative figures again.
<BR><BR>
As you can see, since I do not have any pictures to pad this update with, I decided to ramble on.  You can blame this on my ISP for ganking my webhosting or you can blame SOE for bringing the servers down for all of this drivel.
<BR><BR>
I'll end one of the worst updates in the history of Venator Sapentia on this positive note:
<BR><BR>
Welcome Galolron and Qaiadil to the VS family! Our first new members in a very long time. :)
<BR><BR>
p.s. For the VSers that have had some real life hard times lately, all of our hearts go out to you.

So, we went to time and killed all of the following:<br>
<br>
Terris Thule<br>
Saryrn<br>
Vallon Zek<br>
Tallon Zek<br>
Rallos Zek<br>
Bertoxxulous<br>
Cazic Thule<br>
Innoruuk<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it was really late at night (or early in the morning) or there would have been a "Quarm" on the bottom of that list.  Getting him to 17% on the first try is not a bad effort at all.<br>
<br>
Who is the next to die?  This guy:<br>
<br>

<br><br>
If you are into seeing corpses of gods, here are some links for you to follow (I know, some are missing!):<br>
<br>
<a href=http://s95392880.onlinehome.us/html/images/everquest/bertdead.JPG>Bert Dead - yes, it is just a foot!</a>
<br>
<a href=http://s95392880.onlinehome.us/html/images/everquest/ctdead.JPG>Cazic's corpse</a>
<br>
<a href=http://s95392880.onlinehome.us/html/images/everquest/saryrndead.JPG>Saryrn Dead</a>
<br>
<a href=http://s95392880.onlinehome.us/html/images/everquest/vzdead.JPG>Vallon Zek napping</a>
<br><br>
Enjoy!<br>
<br><br>
p.s. Cazic and Rallos hate our monks.
<BR><BR>
p.p.s. Adus, the Bert corpse screenshot > Inny Corpse screenshot ;)

So I'm not slacking this time.  Here is a quick update for everyone who is interested!
<BR><BR>
Time was our night tonight.  And we started off with a less than auspicious beginning - as you can see from the following quote! <BR>
<BR>
<img src=http://www.stoutner.com/tribal/pics/malte.JPG>
<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, we moved past that.  What did we do?  We just killed TZ in time.<BR>
<BR>
<img height=600 width=800 src=http://www.stoutner.com/tribal/pics/tzdead.JPG>
<BR>
No loot links, just because.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, yeah - and this is special:
*edit*Janya didn't think that Janet Jackson's boob was special, sorry.

Ok, so I've slacked lately.  I haven't updated the main page in a few weeks, so I'll update everyone and maybe toss in a few pictures.  We fairly easily move through phase 1-3 now and we're trying for the Phase 4 Gods: Terris Thule, Saryrn, Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek.
<BR><BR>
Last week, we decided that we may as well give Saryrn a try right off the bat. 
<BR><BR>
edit:pictures coming soon, when I can actually upload them
<BR><BR>
The first round, we didn't quite know what to expect.  After dying, and regrouping, we killed the freaky leather clad S&M chick.
<BR><BR>
<img  height=600 width=800 src=http://www.stoutner.com/tribal/pics/saryrndead.JPG>
<BR><BR>
So she died, we rejoiced...necros had fun with the corpse, which they always do.
<BR><BR>
Regroup!  Lets try her lesbian lover now, TT!  That sounded like a good idea, everyone was up for that!
<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
Well, she had her way with us.  Evidently she was mad that her "lifemate" was taken out earlier.  We were tired, we slept. You been here all night, you go home now!
<BR><BR>
Fast forward to this week.  Well, we run through phase one, kill Saryrn again on Friday night...and decide to save her lover for Valentines day.
<BR><BR>
She was depressed that she didn't have her lover and eventually she fell dead.
<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
without further adieu, here are the loots.  No pictures this time, because I'm lazy.  You can look them up <a href=http://www.darkwind-guild.com/SoL/index%20Pop.htm>here</a>.
<BR><BR>
