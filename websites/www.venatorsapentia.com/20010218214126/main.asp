	     You might have noticed the link to <a href="http://www.migliosoft.com" target="_top">Miglio Soft</a> below the scroll bar to the left.  I was trying to think of a way to thank my good friend Miglio for teaching me the ins and outs of ASP and Database programing when I remembered that he sells some software that he wrote on his web site.  You all will be happy to know that this site has gotten kinda popular and is receiving just over 1000 hits a day.  As a thanks to Miglio I have decided to let him advertise his Screen Saver software here.  I use it at work and at home and like it alot.  I won't go into details on the software since you can read for yourself.
		 <br><br>
		 This is not a precursor to a ton of advertising.  This was just me showing my thanks to a friend.  You'll be happy to know that in trade for this Miglio and I have worked out a deal to set up an items database that will be intergrated into the members list.  I don't think everyone realizes the time that he has dedicated to fixing my mistakes and writing alot of code along the way.  I'm slowly catching on so he won't have to fix my mistakes for ever, but I still wanted everyone to know how much he has done for us.  So please check out his site and software.  Thanks.
		 <br><br>
		 I have some more graphical changes coming in the next couple of days as well.  I've just about got the site to the point were we can start expanding the features rather than make it look good.  I know that is doesn't look quite right in Netscape but I am working on it.  I have kind of slacked of on the Netscape thing because less than 10% of the users that come across the site use Netscape.  I'll get it worked out soon though.

<font color="#00ff00">1.</font><font color="#DAD8B1">The problem with the Twinks section of the members list has been fixed.  Thanks to Craz for pointing it out.  Trade Skills are still broken.</font><br><br> 

<font color="#00ff00">2.</font><font color="#DAD8B1"> Next on the list is to redo the Navbar to make it load faster.  I have noticed that it takes a little to long to load the images even thou they are small.  I figure that I will spice up the Navbar while I am at it, so stay tuned for some graphical changes.</font><br><br> 

<font color="#00ff00">3.</font><font color="#DAD8B1"> The "Hand Me Down" section is going slower that I thought.  It is being written in JavaScript since a lot of it's features are based upon events happening upon clicking on an item.  I don't know JavaScript very well so I am turning to my friend Miglio once again for help.  I really think you guys are going to like it once it is done thou.</font><br><br> 

<font color="#00ff00">4.</font><font color="#DAD8B1"> I put the link to Alchemy back.  I took it down and sure enough people started asking about components needed to make potions.  If anyone has a problem with it I'll take it down again.</font><br><br>  

<font color="#00ff00">5.</font><font color="#DAD8B1"> Coming soon to an Admin near you!!!!  Soon Xando, Ayd, and Norly will have Admin access to add, delete, and modify peeps on the members list.</font><br><br> 

<font color="#00ff00">6.</font><font color="#DAD8B1"> As per request, a screenshots section for raid pictures has been put on the list of things to do.  It's on the back burner right now but I will get to it as soon as possible.</font><br><br> 
 
<font color="#DAD8B1"> 
Again, many thanks, and please, please keep those profiles updated!<br><br>

   Due to popular demand, there are now more stats that you can list for your character.  Hitpoints, AC, and all resists are now listed as part of your profile.  Please stop by and update your profile when you get a chance.<br><br>
   I removed the Trade Skill link on every ones profile until the bugs are worked out.  There was a glitch that was preventing users from updating their Trade Skills.  The problem should be fixed soon.<br><br>
   Also being worked on is the new &quot;Hand Me Down&quot; section that will allow users to list unwanted/needed equipment that they are willing to give to other guild members.  Keep alook out for it in the near future.

   <font color="#00ff00" face="times new roman" size="4">Patch Message for 12/08/00</font><br><br>
   <font face="times new roman" color="#DAD8B1" size="3"> 
   We appreciate everyone's continued patience over the past couple of days, and are happy to see that the problems that have been experienced are relatively minor compared to those of the past. Tonight's patch is expected to be the last one we'll have to do for a while, so we hope to have you enjoying Velious over the weekend non-stop.
<br><br>
Today's patch corrects the following issues:
<br><br>
-The user interface problems that occurred as of last night have been addressed, such as window positioning and transparency. Also addressed were problems with targeting, enabling and disabling windows, and switching to and from resolutions above 1280x1024.<br> 
-Corrected a problem that would cause some Voodoo card users to lock up when killing giants.<br> 
-Added messages for some new skills that some NPCs have (e.g. Rampage, and Flurry). <br>
-Fixed items and item drops in a number of zones. <br>
Enjoy your weekend!<br><br>

- The EverQuest Team
