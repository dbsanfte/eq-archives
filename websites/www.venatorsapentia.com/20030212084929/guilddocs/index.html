					Venator Sapentia Everquest Guild Constitution<BR>
					<BR>
					RATIFIED 2/9/2001<BR>
					<BR>
					Purpose<BR>
					<BR>
				</B>
				<!--- </font> --->
				Venator Sapentia (VS) was founded by a small group of friends with a common 
				interest in Everquest. Our mission is to have fun and kick ass. Venator 
				Sapentia, roughly translated, means Seeker of Wisdom.<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>Officers<BR>
					<BR>
				</B><U>Restrictions for Officers<BR>
					<BR>
				</U>No member may hold more than one office.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				Officers must remain active in the game. If no member can recall seeing the 
				President in game within the past 90 days, (determined by polling on the 
				message board) it is considered an automatic resignation and the Vice President 
				succeeds him. Other officers who become inactive are replaced by the President 
				as needed.<BR>
				<BR>
				<U>President and Vice President<BR>
					<BR>
				</U>The President and Vice President are elected once a year by majority vote. 
				(See the section on Election of Officers.) The Vice President will take the 
				role of the President while he is temporarily absent and succeed him if he is 
				permanently removed from his post or becomes inactive. If the office of Vice 
				President becomes vacant, the President will appoint a new Vice President 
				immediately.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				The President will appoint all other officers at the start of his term, and 
				appoint a replacement should any post become vacant. All appointed officers 
				serve at the will of the President, and the President can demand the 
				resignation of appointed officers at any time.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<U>Headmaster<BR>
					<BR>
				</U>The President appoints the Headmaster to run the guild's recruiting program 
				and to prepare candidates for their induction. The Headmaster judges the 
				outcome of all membership elections. This is probably at once the most onerous 
				and rewarding officer post in the VS guild. The future of the organization lies 
				with the Headmaster. He must be willing to devote a significant amount of his 
				time to his duties.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<U>Herald<BR>
					<BR>
				</U>The herald is appointed by the President and is responsible for maintaining 
				the Venator Sapentia discussion boards and for running elections. He also 
				provides technical assistance to other officers and members as needed.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<U>Webmaster<BR>
					<BR>
				</U>The Webmaster maintains the Venator Sapentia web site. He also provides 
				technical assistance to other officers and members as needed. The webmaster 
				will provide an area of the web site to record the current membership roster.<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>Election of Officers<BR>
					<BR>
				</B>Officers will be elected once a year, starting on the first Saturday in 
				January.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				On the first Saturday in January, the Herald will start a thread on the private 
				message board for the nomination of President.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				Members then have one week to post nominations for President to the election 
				thread, and may not withdraw a nomination once posted. Members cannot nominate 
				themselves. Nominees who accept their nomination before the week has elapsed 
				become candidates for the office. Candidates must name their vice president 
				when they accept their nomination.<BR>
				<BR>
				On the second Saturday in January, the Herald will hold an election for 
				declared candidates for one week. The Herald will use a poll-type message board 
				thread for officer elections. On the third Saturday in January the candidate 
				with the most votes will take office. In the event of a tie, the Herald may 
				extend or rerun the election at his option.<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>Membership<BR>
					<BR>
				</B>Candidates for membership must be nominated by a current member of Venator 
				Sapentia by creating a nomination thread on the Venator Sapentia membership 
				board naming the candidate. <I>This thread must be a normal message thread and not 
					an anonymous poll thread.</I>
				<BR>
				<BR>
				To vote, members must post Aye or Nay to the voting thread, along with their 
				experience with the nominee. Members must have some experience with the nominee 
				before voting.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				If a member wants to vote anonymously, they can discuss their vote in private 
				with the Headmaster. If the Headmaster decides the vote is valid, he will post 
				a vote to the voting thread on behalf of the member without revealing the 
				member's identity or reasons.<BR>
				<BR>
				To be accepted, the candidate must receive at least 10 Aye votes and no Nay 
				votes within 28 days. After 28 days if there are fewer than 10 votes the 
				election ends and the candidate is not accepted.<BR>
				<BR>
				The candidate can be accepted after only 14 days if the candidate receives at 
				least 20 Aye votes and no Nay votes. As soon as these conditions are met, the 
				election is closed and posting a Nay vote has no effect. This provision allows 
				candidates who are already well known to be guilded quickly. However, all 
				membership elections must last at least 14 days.<BR>
				<BR>
				Members can change their vote up until the election end. Thus, ongoing debate 
				may affect the results of the election. Note that if a candidate is accepted 
				before the full 28 days have elapsed because there are at least 20 Aye votes, 
				the election is closed and changing a vote has no effect.<BR>
				<BR>
				The nominator can withdraw their nomination before the election ends. This ends 
				the election and the nominee is not guided.<BR>
				<BR>
				If a membership election fails for any reason, the candidate may be nominated 
				again after 90 days from the end of the election.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				The Headmaster will determine the outcome of all membership elections, and will 
				decide if votes are valid. Nay votes based on a lack of time with the nominee 
				will not be counted. The Headmaster will only count votes that are 
				unequivocally Aye or Nay. Abstain or "maybe" votes will not be counted.<BR>
				<BR>
				The Headmaster will exclude votes if the voter does not describe a relevant 
				experience with the candidate that is the basis of their decision. In other 
				words, members must explain their votes. Voters who know the candidate well 
				need only describe this in general rather than provide an account of recent 
				groups, etc. The Headmaster will use the following guidelines for determining 
				what is relevant experience:<BR>
				<BR>
				<UL>
					<LI>
						Friendship with the nominee.</LI><LI>Grouping with the nominee within the past 
						year.</LI><LI>Participating in a raid or other large event with the nominee 
						within the past year.</LI><LI>Any significant negative experience with the 
						candidate, regardless of how long ago it occurred.
					</LI>
				</UL>
				No person can become a member of VS without a successful membership election. 
				Any member who transfers a guilded account to another person must remove all 
				guild tags from characters on the account.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				However, a member who is actively playing may extend temporary membership to a 
				spouse or loved one who shares their account(s). If the member stops playing or 
				transfers their account(s), the temporary membership is automatically revoked 
				and the guild tag must be removed. However, there is nothing to prevent 
				temporary members from seeking full membership.<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>Discipline and Decision Making<BR>
					<BR>
				</B>A member of VS can be removed from the guild by a 2/3 majority vote of all 
				active members. Any member can initiate such an election, but it is a measure 
				of last resort and all members are encouraged to seek reconciliation first. 
				Members can also voluntarily resign from VS by declaring their resignation on 
				the private board. Any member losing VS membership will be removed from the web 
				site and private boards and will no longer participate in elections.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				For all other matters not otherwise covered by this constitution, the guild 
				president has broad powers to act as he sees fit.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				However, VS is a democracy and any majority vote of all active members is 
				considered a binding decision and becomes law. (Except for decisions to remove 
				a member, which require a 2/3 majority.)<BR>
				<BR>
				For example: any decision of the President can be overturned by a majority vote 
				of all active members. The President can also be removed from office by a 
				majority vote of all active members.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				When determining the total count of active members for the above elections, the 
				Herald will use the list of members posted on VenatorSapentia.com but exclude 
				those members who have not been seen in game or on the boards within the past 
				90 days, <I>unless </I>those members vote <I>and </I>notify the Herald that 
				they voted.<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>Adoption of this Constitution<BR>
					<BR>
				</B>This constitution has taken effect as ratified by a majority of VS members 
				listed on VenatorSapentia.com as of 2/6/2001.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				The following officers were elected in October, 2001 by a call for election by the VS Membership.
				Officers will be as follows until the January, 2003 elections:<BR>
				<BR>
				Xaev: President<BR>
				<BR>
				Xandelwyn: Vice-President<BR>
				<BR>
				To Be Apointed: Headmaster<BR>
				<BR>
				To Be Apointed: Herald<BR>
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>Changes to this Constitution<BR>
					<BR>
				</B>The constitution may be changed by a majority vote of active VS membership 
				as described in the above section entitled "Discipline and Decision Making."<BR>
