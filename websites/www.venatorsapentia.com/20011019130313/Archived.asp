<font face='verdana' size='2pt'>These are some of the details recently released regarding character advancement
with Shadows of Luclin:
  <p>
The alternative advancement system will allow
anyone who has purchased and installed Shadows of Luclin to further customize
their high level (51+) characters. Customized features may include things such
as minor permanent statistic and resistance boosts, unique skills based on your
class or archetype (fighter, magic user, priest), and general skills available
to everyone. These skills may include anything from an enhanced metabolism, to
improvements in skills already available to your class. You may also find some
unique skills not yet available to anyone. Some enhancements may add a title to
your character based on what choices you have made in enhancing your character;
these titles will be visible to other players.</p>
  <P>
In order to
attain these skills, you will be able to toggle your experience into the
alternative advancement pool. When you do this, your experience will be
allocated to this pool in lieu of your “leveling” experience bar. Once a
certain amount of experience has entered the alternative advancement pool, you
will receive training points that may be allocated to acquiring your
enhancements. When you acquire the proper amount of training points, you will
have the option of choosing which enhancement you wish to gain, although some
enhancements may have pre-requisites that will need to be obtained before you
are able to acquire it.</p><P>
Players will have
the option of toggling between the normal experience pool to gain levels, or
back to the alternative enhancement pool to gain enhancements whenever they wish
(although this may require you to zone after you have toggled your switch).
Switching between the two pools will not cause you to lose experience in the
other. Experience loss due to death suffered by the character will be taken from
the “Leveling” experience pool, it will not impact your alternative
advancement pool. </p><P>
The alternative
advancement system will allow for a variety of enhancements to choose from for
each class. Those who chose to enhance their character with this system may find
a higher level of individuality in their character.</p>

          <tr><td align="left" valign="top" width="400"><br>
<font face='verdana' size='2pt'><p>Sony Online Entertainment Inc., (SOE) announced today
  that <i>EverQuest®: The Shadows of Luclin™</i> will launch with an
  additional CD-ROM featuring a complete upgrade to all textures throughout the
  original world of Norrath and all previous expansions.</p>
  <p>“We are pleased to make this surprise announcement,”
  said Brad McQuaid, Chief Creative Officer & Vice President, Sony Online
  Entertainment. “<i>EverQuest</i> players will be amazed at the clarity the
  texture upgrade provides and we feel the gameplay experience will be richly
  enhanced.”</p>
  <p>When <i>EverQuest</i> originally shipped in 1999, the
  development team utilized 32 x 32 low-resolution pixels because of graphics
  technology at the time. With the advent of superior graphic cards, the
  upgraded texture resolution featured in <i>EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin</i>
  will be 256 x 256 pixels and occasionally as large as 512 x 512 pixels. 
  This vast improvement in quality will make Norrath appear more vibrant
  and detailed than ever before.</p>
  <p>“We have gone through the entire game and applied the
  new higher resolution textures by hand,” said Scott McDaniel, <i>EverQuest </i>Art
  Lead, Sony Online Entertainment. “The sheer size of <i>EverQuest </i>has
  made this upgrade quite a project.  To
  see the old zones in high resolution is really exciting for the entire
  team.”</p>
  <p><i>EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin</i> features over 24
  new zones, rideable mounts, all new character models, new facial animations,
  and over 120 new spells and will be available on retail shelves in December
  2001. For more information visit the official <i>Shadows of Luclin</i> website
  at <a href="http://www.everquest.com/luclin" target="_blank">www.everquest.com/luclin</a>.</p>

<p class='boldheader'>CHAT LOG POSTED</p><font face='verdana' size='2pt'><p>EQ Stratics have released their Chat Log from the HoC chat earlier this week, here are some highlights:</p> <ul>   <li>Familiars will follow the Wizards around. They do     not attack, and can recieve no commands other then /pet get lost. They will     zone with the Wizards, and be there waiting for them when they log in (they     do not stay in the world when the wizard is gone though)... They will grant     added resistances to the Wizard, as well as some other benefits that will     aid in casting efficiency, as well their mana pool, and mana regen. That     being said, they currently have not gone through final balancing and are     still very much in the process of being worked on.<br>      <li>We're definitely planning to make some accomodation     for people with existing characters to choose a face they like when the new     character models become available.<br>      </li>   <li>Chardok was a dungeon that wasn't seeing as much use     as we'd like. People would go there to raid the Royals for epic pieces, and     occasionally you'd see a group camping the zone in, but overall it just     wasn't getting many people coming in. I've always been impressed with the     architecture of the zone, and it seemed like a perfect zone to get a bit of     a revamp.<br>      <br>     The amount of roaming mobs has come down quite a bit, things still roam but     they don't wander from the very back of the dungeon to the front. You'll     find a higher amount of named mobs in the zone, some very interesting new     treasures dropping, some quests and conveniences for people with good Sarnak     faction, as well as a lot of fun encounters there<br>      <br>     Another guy on the team, Azaliil, has worked in some incredible story     elements and flavor that really make the zone stand out. It's been very well     received on test server, and I think people will be really pleased when they     get a chance to adventure in new Chardok.<br>      </li>   <li>Some of the things that are being considered [for the SoL Bard songs] are     area (not group) resistance songs, and haste songs that will exceed the     normal haste cap. Going beyond the current haste cap will only be possible     using one of these bard songs.</li> </ul> <p>You can read the full log with many more interesting facts <a href='http://eq.stratics.com' target='_blank'>here</a>.</font></p> 	</font>

<ul>
  <li>We have removed the changes to bard song stacking that were made with the
    recent emergency patch. We will be reviewing those changes for possible
    update in a future patch.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Item Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Shaman Epic effect has been returned to its previous effect (and it
    should conflict with fewer Damage over Time spells, as was the intention for
    the change made last patch).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Quest Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ivory Sky Diamond is now dropping as it should.</li>
  <li>Fixed an error in a Stonebrunt quest where an NPC was handing out the
    wrong reward.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Miscellaneous</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added some code that might fix a bug with female hair and Erudite hoods
    that caused them to fail to appear sometimes when a helmet was removed. This
    would cause some characters to look as though the back of their head was
    missing at times.</li>
  <li>Mouselook will now work a little differently when in the first two
    third-person camera modes (overhead and chase). They will work similarly to
    first-person mouselook (i.e. your character's heading will change when you
    move the mouse left or right, the left and right movement keys will cause
    your player to strafe, and the camera angle will pitch up or down when you
    move the mouse forward or back). These changes should make those first two
    third-person camera modes more useful.</li>

Sorry about the down-time of the Website and Message Boards.  The ISP's POP which this circuit terminates at just happens to be in the Heart of NYC, right around the corrner where Tuesdays attack took place.  Unfortunately this means that they have been without power ever since Tuesday afternoon and have had to rely on Backup Generators.  The generators however were never meant to run for 3+ days straight and have subsequently burned up and need replaced.<br><br>
I am being told that they will be installing new generators ASAP, and hopefully this news bit won't be too stale by the time you all can read it.

This tidbit was found <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000308.html">here</a>.<br><br>

<B>Just wondering if the change to the Shaman Epic effect was intentional.  Just to clarify.  Curse of the spirits used to be a clickable dot that had some stacking issues with other dots.  The patch message said that it was modified so that the stacking issues were less of a problem.  However now it seem to be a heal over time instead of dot, is this intentional or an accident?<P>Thank<BR>Colal</B><P>That was an accident.<P>We'll get it fixed with the next patch.  I'm sorry for the mistake.  In the mean time it's probably more useful on your allies than on your enemies.  :) <P>Alan<BR></FONT><BR></FONT>

Note: I just read that this is a confirmed bug, they have it fixed, but no word on when they will patch for it.  Also it will only work on the Shaman, a mob, in a Duel or on a PVP server.  So it's quite useless to L60 Shaman with Topor.  I also have not heard if it actually does heal a mob or not.

<ul>
  <li>Changed all enchanter mesmerization spells so that they overwrite Screaming Terror</li>
  <li>Changed Shaman epic effect (Curse of the Spirits) so that it would not conflict with certain Damage over Time spells.</li>
  <li>The Emissary of Thule Necromancer pet is now immune to fear</li>
  <li>Beneficial buffs that don't have an ability drain component on them can now be clicked off.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Miscellaneous Updates</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The server selection screen now only gives information on whether or not a server is up instead of providing player counts.  In addition, the "count" option on the /who command has been restricted to internal personnel.  Servers on the server selection screen are still ordered from least-populated to most populated in order to assist players in choosing the least populated server.</li>
  <li>Harla Dar has been repaired (this happened sometime earlier than today, but we wanted you to know).</li>
  <li>Reactivated broken zone line between Qeynos to the Sewers.  A dead halfling was stuck in the drainpipe and has been removed.</li>
  <li>Fixed a long-standing bug that was causing Feign Death to fail when several characters were on the NPC's hate list along with the character using Feign Death.  We'd like to extend much thanks to the monk community who helped us track this one down.  Also fixed a problem with the monk's 'Block' skill which inadvertantly was recapped at a lower than normal skill level in recent months.  Kudos to "Faned" of the "Monkly Business" bulletin board who brow-beat Gordon with the facts until he gave in and looked at the code :)</li>
  <li>As announced earlier this week, the Belt of the Cenobite was made useable by some inappropriate classes/races in the last patch.  This has been corrected.</li>
  <li>Several quest components in zones with the Trivial Loot Code will now be lootable regardless of level.</li>

 A big Congratz out to Vandeg on a text book take down of the Chardok Royal's.  We would have owned them all again if it hadn't been for the great server outage of Xegony.
 <br>
 Thank you to everyone who showed up to help make this happen, Undaunted, MoD, and everyone else!
 <br><br>
 And a big Congratz out to Wildwood who sucessfully completed his 7th Coldain Shawl this evening!

*** New Free Zone - Stonebrunt Mountains ***
<br><br>
That's what this patch is all about.  We're adding the Stonebrunt Mountains.  You will need to choose the Optional Patch to download the files you will need to be able to enter the zone.

From the press release:

"Located on the small continent of Odus, the Stonebrunt Mountains are rich with vegetation and distinctive hills that give way to the towering Mount Klaw; the largest mountain in Odus and home to the Kerran village of Kejeka.  The zone of Stonebrunt is designed to be a mid-level, outdoor zone similar in scope and scale to the Lake of Ill Omen on Kunark, which has proven to be a very popular zone in EverQuest."

<p>*** Patch Message *** <br><br>

** Zone Changes ** <br><br>

- Runnyeye has been changed. Something is up in Goblin land... <br><br>

** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes ** <br><br>

- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code. For the most part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to stack that were never intended to stack. <br>
- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds. <br>
- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of Cazic Thule can scribe it. <br>
- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been changed to be more appropriate. <br><br>

** Features and Interface Changes ** <br><br>

- The variable %t will now work with /assist. So you can use /assist %t if you wish. Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist without the %t.<br> 
- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs. <br>
- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to user color 15 (same as other skill messages). The success message was already set to user color 15.<br> 
- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does. It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server. The new ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list (_<#>.ini). The first time a character is created or loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character. <br>
- The Alt key now works in several new situations. It will now show item names when in the trade window. Because the trade items of the local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade item names. <br>
- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank. <br>
- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode. <br>
- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they don't show up otherwise).<br> 
- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any player that is on your /ignore list. Some players were using this to annoy players that had ignored them. <br>
- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to annoy people that had ignored them). <br>
- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the members of your guild in your zone. You can also specify a guild name, such as /who "Irontoe Brigade". <br>
- /safelock command added. /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface (mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash commands) with the password that you supply to the command. You must use this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the interface. Passwords are NOT case-sensitive. So to lock your interface, you would type /safelock password. You would do the same to unlock it. <br><br>

REMEMBER: If you forget what password you typed, you will need to reboot your machine. <br><br>

** Item Changes ** <br><br>

- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.<br> 
- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now. <br>
- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of your waist.<br> 
- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop. They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. <br>
- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable. There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so we had to disable that for these items. <br>
- Sewing Kits: No existing sewing kits are being changed with this patch. But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different. Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots. Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit. <br>
- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray. <br><br>

** Other Stuff ** <br><br>

- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level bard title. :) <br>
- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with that of his counterparts in Velious. This is not the sort of thing that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest. We're announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion. <br><br>

<p>Congrats to Xec for being the first Necro in the guild to get his duck.  Craz is also nearing completion of his epic quest. All Craz needs to complete his Epic are some gloves that use to drop off CT, however should now drop off one of the demigods. The Fear trip scheduled for Wen has been canceled.  We'll get there as soon as possible for Craz.</p>
