Vex Thal cleared over and over. There are so many amazing things we get to see every week. Well okay, so many completely redundant Robes and 4Arms we get to see every week. Guess what, Eoms? <br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/dammanhatesyou.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
<br>
At least one good thing from all this, the free buffet from the 5 various summoning items we have!<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/foodstaff.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
<br>

My love for black bread aside, thoughts of EverQuest's future surface more and more with the release of Planes Of Power drawing ever closer. Many important discussions of things we'ed like to see, or what we think would improve the game overall have been brought up. <br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/monkey.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
<br>
Naturally, I have to bring up the amazing inconsistancies with the new druid heal versus the new shaman heal. Guess what, druid 75% heal?<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/dammanhatesyou2.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
<br>

Also need to mention the suicide inducing stat buffs that no shaman ***EVER*** cast, the watered down Focus buff compared to the beefy PotG and Aego versions, and the fact POP will further decrease the potency of Shaman.<br><br>

Kinda scary when ghosts from the past come back, isn't it! btw, Chaca is still looking for his cash. At any rate, this past week hasn't seen anything too exciting outside of the usual Vex Thal hyjinks!<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/rangerorgy.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
So all my talk of cyber last week has whipped our rangers into a cyberific orgy fest (no pants) one that the forces of nature can barely withstand.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/skanda3.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
But I dont want to try and convince you rangers are drug users who get the munchies or anything... <br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/statixpizza2.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
Well I guess that isn't accurate, what with all the *herbs* they can forage. However, they aren't all bad.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/skanda2.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
Our rangers are also getting malicious in recruiting for their expKS groups.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/izzindie.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br> In the news are reports on our new POP spells. Clerics are excited about the new heal spells.<br><br><img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/dietele.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>

In all reality, clerics really do need something to offset the new found bloodlust of combat and slip back into healing.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/clericsad.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
I tried convince them otherwise but was met with some pretty stiff opposition when I suggested it.
<br><br>

Maybe I'm asking too much, or maybe I'm asking for heals to actually save my life.<br><BR>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/healbug.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
At least warrior taunt works. Here, let's watch a warrior use his magical AE taunt to keep the mobs off me.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/adantetaunt.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
Good thing I'm a shaman! You know, a powerful priestly class valued for their offensive capabilities and a solid repertoire of healing and other clerical type spells! <br><BR>

Best part of Vex Thall though, everything but the entry n00b Xakras are dropping these left and right.

<font face='verdana' size='2pt'Bug Fixes<BR><BR>
Klaget's been hard at work trying to figure out why I, Damman, surveyor of all I can see, couldn't upload for these wonderful updates. Finally my quest is completed, and I thought I'd share with you my journey to this update.<br>
<br>
The day began as any other ordinary day would, I log in, check a few spawns, swim through the lag infested molasses that is now Sanctus Seru and I thought to myself, I've heard this before, but what is this thing called Cyber? I didn't know much about it earlier, and I had come to a conclusion. I would find this mysterious Cyber no matter the cost.<br>
<br>
My first step in this mystery was to discover what this so called Cyber really was. I turned to my trusted bard. Knowing them to be jacks of all trades,  <br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/happygaypride.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt="">
<br>perhaps he knew, but he was very distracted with... something... under his desk. I didn't know what at the time, but I had my suspicions.<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/aaldainjaw1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Still completely baffled, I sought the council of the oldest living creature in existance, Norl.
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/norlsday.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Much like every worthless old person, he rambled on for good 3 or 4 hours before I was able to escape, continuing on my journey. <br>
<br>
The next day, I found myself no closer to knowing anything about this Cyber. I asked if anyone would explain who or what Cyber was to me.<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/warzrazor1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt="">
<br><br>
Perhaps just a hint?<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/gathuadaptable.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Thus, the revelation. It was indeed something sexual. In the interest of science, I simply had to know what this mystery would reveal. I turned to my friends to see what they knew of it, trying to grasp any straws I could.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/guiporn.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
<br>
Sadly, I accidentally said sex in guild chat, and this went on for several days. However, hope was not completely gone. A shadowy figure stepped forth from his bazaar merchant stall, and whispered some advise to catch this tiger by it's tail. Playing it cool, and lots of cool music.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/coolfonz1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
I had the music down, sure, no problem. Still, I knew there was one critical step missing. To find Cyber, I needed something to lure it in.<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/aeryfantasy1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Well, maybe I didn't afterall. Back to the music! I decided to find the best sexually explicit music I could to lure a Cyber into my trap. <br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/barkinwonka.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Sadly, that got my no where, as I learned this song only motivated the *real world* sexual fantasies. <br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/brydenswife1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
Now I knew I was close. This alleged Cyber was for online only. There had to be a way I could capture it. <br>
<br>
The next day I knew. I journeyed far and wide to find the choicest seat, a throne of Cyber, if you will. Others knowing what I was doing stared on in revered awe.<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/deedlikeu.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Perched from atop my seat I began playing the coolest music known to man, ever.<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/hasselhoff1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Oh, they flocked towards me left and right. At first, it was just a small amount, a piece here, a piece there.<br><img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/kenliehug.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Being more proactive I hummed louder, until finally, amidst the chaos of internet~<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/kalacyber.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>

Success was mine, and I come forth knowing maybe too much of this online web of intrigue we call, Cyber.<br><br>

<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/zweilube.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
<br>
<br>
Tomorrow, with a little rest, and maybe a bucket of ice, I'll share with you our phat lewtz.

Out of the Blue my ISP has decided to move my Circuit to a New POP.  On the good side it's a bit closer and less loaded so latency should go down. But it also means that they are giving me a new set of IP address's.  Hopefully the transition will go smoothly.  However it may take a few hours for DNS changes to propigate, causing some people to not be able to obtain access to the boards or website.

The mighty patch message:<br><br>

<font face='verdana' size='2pt'Bug Fixes<BR><BR>

Fixed a bug that allowed items to be placed in the wrong equipment slots <br>
Fixed a problem that some folks had with polygons and clipping using the Matrox Parhelia card 
Spells<BR>

Changed Luclin port spells to be usable from anywhere <BR>
Added new Druid and Wizard transportation spells for locations in Luclin (Not that we care about druid ports, limey asslings) <br><br>
Items
<BR>
Removed the cap for items that granted bonus mana<br> 
Bricks of Black Acrylia are now stackable <br>
Plains Pebbles are now stackable <br>
Casserole Dish Sketches are now stackable <br>
Yttrium Sleeves and Leggings now have a plate armor appearance. They are also no drop <br>
(Like anyone gives a rat's ass)<BR><BR>
New User Interface<BR>

New Interface Window: The Compass! Press Alt-D to activate it. The higher your Sense Heading skill is, the more responsive and accurate the compass is <br>
Fixed the fatigue percentage Label to show 100% when you are not fatigued at all <br>
Clicking to add new items to a stack in your inventory will now stack those items into the inventory rather than onto the cursor (FINALLY!!!)<br>
Fixed a bug that was causing some people to lose items when looting too quickly. <br>
Tracking window no longer shifts to the top every time an NPC dies <br>
Training window no longer only shows the first digit of the amount needed to pay for training <br>
Fixed the bug that was causing left clicking during mouselook to target <br>
The 'hits mode' menu and filtering for it is done, including the options for normal, abbreviated and number/miss only for the six main melee filters <br>
UI Skin Creators: We added the following EQType labels: <br><br>

71 = Current AA pts available to spend<br> 

72 = Current exp % being assigned to AA <br>

73 = Last Name of the player<BR><BR> 
  
Alternate Skin Users: You may need to return to the default interface until the skin that you are using has been updated to work with the latest client. The addition of the new Compass window as well as some other changes may cause problems with skins for older patches of EverQuest. If you experience odd interface behavior or crashes, please try /LOADSKIN DEFAULT to return to the default skin. (WAY TO FUCK UP EVERYONE'S GOD DAMN UI, VERANT.)<BR><BR>
Bazaar<br>

The Bazaar Search Window is resizable (added in an earlier patch) <br>
PCs can't beg or pickpocket from NPC's and PC's in the bazaar (added in an earlier patch) <br>
The Trader drop down box is now sorted alphabetically <BR><BR>
Alternate Advancement<BR>

Priests and intelligence casters now have the Combat Stability and Natural Durability Alternate Advancement abilities in their Archetype (BOOYAH)<BR><BR>
Miscellaneous<BR>

Reduced the faction hit for the final turn in on the Wizard Epic quest <BR>
Implemented key rings. Certain keys will be placed on your key ring when you use them (like clicking on the appropriate doors or locks). The keyring is a part of the character, not a space in inventory. To find out what keys you have just type /key and the game will give you a list (VERY BROKEN!!!)<BR>
Moved the safe point in Marus Seru to a somewhat safer spot. <BR> </font>
<br> Well since I don't care about the crappy loot that dropped, I won't bother to post. Though it was nice, it was mostly VT and a couple EMP kills.<br>

Last few days have found VS in the daily grind that is Luclin endgames. VT put up suk quality loot, but several mysteries were revealed!
<br><br>Why do Thalls blind in the first place?

<br> 

The most pressing mystery though is where our puller went! Xaev has been M.I.A. for a few weeks now, and we all sit around wondering what he's doing. Abduction? No. Institutionalized? Possibly. Having sex with his pets? You guessed it!
<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/xaevsdog.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt="">
<br><br>
The second mystery is how we really view the Druid community. Who better to turn to than a Druid?
<br><br>

<br><br>
Finally, we all spend a lot of time in the new Bazaar. With all these new trader modes and /bazaar mode searching, is it possible to to find out the *worst* possible thing to buy? No. Sadly, I had to turn to Buysell to find this flea market gem.<br><br>

Also, we were able to /plow through another 8th shawl quest for Oreh's Cleric, and lamented on our combined uselessness in tailoring. Moosius was also promoting Neero's next party.<br><br>

A few new spells/skills have shown up on test. Most of them are in the spell database just like the Paladin Lay Hands.  These could possibly be skills that could be gained by the new advancement mechanisim in SoL.<br>
I would just like to remind everyone that these are things on TEST and does not necessarily mean that they will or are meant to go live.  I just thought it interesting enough to share.

Mark Jacobs from Mythic Entertainment made a statement regarding the next 3 months of Dark Age of Camelot:<br><br>

<font face="verdana" size="2" color="#ffffff">Folks, 
<br><br>
First, I want to thank all of you who have bought and are playing our game. You are part of the most successful launch in MMORPG history. The copies have flown off the shelves, our servers are stable and we are running 24x7 except for patching and a couple of hours on day one. For those of you who can’t get a copy, I have good news for you as well which I will address below. No matter whether you are a player or, we hope, soon to be a player, things are just going to get better and better. The point of this letter is to let the community know just how much better they are going to get in the next few months. As I’ve said before, it is our goal to make DAoC the premier MMORPG in the industry. When competing against the excellent other games in our industry you do not get there by resting on your laurels or by losing focus. We will do nether and here are a few things that we will be in place in DAoC before the end of the year.<br><br>

1) Working with our friends at VU, an additional 75K copies of the game have been shipped. This should help take care of some of the demand for DAoC. More copies will be manufactured after that so the shortage of DAoC on the shelves will soon end. We have already arranged for enough servers and bandwidth to handle the additional demand.<br>
2) We will make major changes to the various interfaces that are part of DAoC. In the most general of terms, we will be adding improvements to chat, appeal, quest journal and advice. We will also be adding an auction channel and a compass to the game. <br>
3) We will be adding at least two more sever types. While I won’t go into details in this letter, these are types that the player community has been asking us for and I think will bring a smile to many faces. <br>
4) We will be taking care of some issues such as grouping across zones, lag in the big cities and some networking issues such as when you go link-dead in the game. We are also further reducing the amount of bandwidth the game consumes.<br> 
5) We will be adding a fuller implementation of horses and transportation modes in the game.<br> 
6) We will be adding a housing system (in stages) to the game.<br>
7) We will make improvements to things such as the water, lava and snow events in the game.<br> 
8) We will add commands such as tracking, climbing, etc.<br>
9) We will be adding shapeshifting to the game.<br> 
10) We will be adding more intricacies to the PvP system within the game. Look for things such as slopes and fatigue, falling damage, alliances and more.<br>
11) We will be adding ladders to the game.<br> 
12) We will be adding a lot of new content to the game including new spells and spell lines, quests and fighting areas. 
<br><br>
This is just some of the things we have planned to add over the next three months. It is not an exhaustive list and it does not reflect the usual bug fixes, tweaking, etc. of the classes. Do not get upset if you don’t see something that you expected or wanted, this is just a list of some of the things we are doing. So please, no new topics such as "I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT MYTHIC IS WORKING ON LAVA WHEN THEY SHOULD BE FIXING XXX." This is only a partial list and as our beta testers can tell you, we are quite capable of multi-tasking around here. There is a lot more coming…

  BRAD MCQUAID LEAVES SONY, OCTOBER 12, 2001<br><br>
	
	<tr>
	  <td width='100%'><font face='verdana' size='2pt'>SAN DIEGO, CA - October 12, 2001- Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), announced today that Brad McQuaid, one of the original creators of EverQuest, will be leaving the company after five years of service. Mr. McQuaid was instrumental in the launch and success of the world’s largest subscription-based online game and was a key spokesman in the online community that nurtured EverQuest’s growth.

<p>“After five years of building the EverQuest franchise for Sony Online Entertainment, it’s time for me to explore other opportunities in the creative development of massively multiplayer games,” said Brad McQuaid. “I wish SOE the greatest success with all future releases and I have the greatest confidence in the ability of the development staff that we’ve assembled over the past few years to continue expanding the EverQuest experience.”

<p>“Brad’s contribution to gaming philosophy that evolved into EverQuest has been recognized throughout the gaming world as one of the premier accomplishments of the past decade in the business,” states John Smedley, Chief Operating Officer, Sony Online Entertainment.  “It’s been a pleasure working with Brad for the past few years as a colleague and a friend and I’m certain that he will continue to contribute innovative and exciting game technology in the future.”

<p>“Brad’s passion for excellence in all things EverQuest has made a material impact in the success of this groundbreaking title,” said Kelly Flock, President, Sony Online Entertainment.  “I know he will continue to be a force in this emerging market and all of us at Sony Online Entertainment look forward to the possibility of working with him again in the future.”

<p>John Smedley, Chief Operating Officer and a partner in the conception and production of EverQuest, will assume Brad McQuaid’s responsibilities.

<font face='verdana' size='2pt'>These are some of the details recently released regarding character advancement
with Shadows of Luclin:
  <p>
The alternative advancement system will allow
anyone who has purchased and installed Shadows of Luclin to further customize
their high level (51+) characters. Customized features may include things such
as minor permanent statistic and resistance boosts, unique skills based on your
class or archetype (fighter, magic user, priest), and general skills available
to everyone. These skills may include anything from an enhanced metabolism, to
improvements in skills already available to your class. You may also find some
unique skills not yet available to anyone. Some enhancements may add a title to
your character based on what choices you have made in enhancing your character;
these titles will be visible to other players.</p>
  <P>
In order to
attain these skills, you will be able to toggle your experience into the
alternative advancement pool. When you do this, your experience will be
allocated to this pool in lieu of your “leveling” experience bar. Once a
certain amount of experience has entered the alternative advancement pool, you
will receive training points that may be allocated to acquiring your
enhancements. When you acquire the proper amount of training points, you will
have the option of choosing which enhancement you wish to gain, although some
enhancements may have pre-requisites that will need to be obtained before you
are able to acquire it.</p><P>
Players will have
the option of toggling between the normal experience pool to gain levels, or
back to the alternative enhancement pool to gain enhancements whenever they wish
(although this may require you to zone after you have toggled your switch).
Switching between the two pools will not cause you to lose experience in the
other. Experience loss due to death suffered by the character will be taken from
the “Leveling” experience pool, it will not impact your alternative
advancement pool. </p><P>
The alternative
advancement system will allow for a variety of enhancements to choose from for
each class. Those who chose to enhance their character with this system may find
a higher level of individuality in their character.</p>

          <tr><td align="left" valign="top" width="400"><br>
<font face='verdana' size='2pt'><p>Sony Online Entertainment Inc., (SOE) announced today
  that <i>EverQuest®: The Shadows of Luclin™</i> will launch with an
  additional CD-ROM featuring a complete upgrade to all textures throughout the
  original world of Norrath and all previous expansions.</p>
  <p>“We are pleased to make this surprise announcement,”
  said Brad McQuaid, Chief Creative Officer & Vice President, Sony Online
  Entertainment. “<i>EverQuest</i> players will be amazed at the clarity the
  texture upgrade provides and we feel the gameplay experience will be richly
  enhanced.”</p>
  <p>When <i>EverQuest</i> originally shipped in 1999, the
  development team utilized 32 x 32 low-resolution pixels because of graphics
  technology at the time. With the advent of superior graphic cards, the
  upgraded texture resolution featured in <i>EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin</i>
  will be 256 x 256 pixels and occasionally as large as 512 x 512 pixels. 
  This vast improvement in quality will make Norrath appear more vibrant
  and detailed than ever before.</p>
  <p>“We have gone through the entire game and applied the
  new higher resolution textures by hand,” said Scott McDaniel, <i>EverQuest </i>Art
  Lead, Sony Online Entertainment. “The sheer size of <i>EverQuest </i>has
  made this upgrade quite a project.  To
  see the old zones in high resolution is really exciting for the entire
  team.”</p>
  <p><i>EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin</i> features over 24
  new zones, rideable mounts, all new character models, new facial animations,
  and over 120 new spells and will be available on retail shelves in December
  2001. For more information visit the official <i>Shadows of Luclin</i> website
  at <a href="http://www.everquest.com/luclin" target="_blank">www.everquest.com/luclin</a>.</p>

<p class='boldheader'>CHAT LOG POSTED</p><font face='verdana' size='2pt'><p>EQ Stratics have released their Chat Log from the HoC chat earlier this week, here are some highlights:</p> <ul>   <li>Familiars will follow the Wizards around. They do     not attack, and can recieve no commands other then /pet get lost. They will     zone with the Wizards, and be there waiting for them when they log in (they     do not stay in the world when the wizard is gone though)... They will grant     added resistances to the Wizard, as well as some other benefits that will     aid in casting efficiency, as well their mana pool, and mana regen. That     being said, they currently have not gone through final balancing and are     still very much in the process of being worked on.<br>      <li>We're definitely planning to make some accomodation     for people with existing characters to choose a face they like when the new     character models become available.<br>      </li>   <li>Chardok was a dungeon that wasn't seeing as much use     as we'd like. People would go there to raid the Royals for epic pieces, and     occasionally you'd see a group camping the zone in, but overall it just     wasn't getting many people coming in. I've always been impressed with the     architecture of the zone, and it seemed like a perfect zone to get a bit of     a revamp.<br>      <br>     The amount of roaming mobs has come down quite a bit, things still roam but     they don't wander from the very back of the dungeon to the front. You'll     find a higher amount of named mobs in the zone, some very interesting new     treasures dropping, some quests and conveniences for people with good Sarnak     faction, as well as a lot of fun encounters there<br>      <br>     Another guy on the team, Azaliil, has worked in some incredible story     elements and flavor that really make the zone stand out. It's been very well     received on test server, and I think people will be really pleased when they     get a chance to adventure in new Chardok.<br>      </li>   <li>Some of the things that are being considered [for the SoL Bard songs] are     area (not group) resistance songs, and haste songs that will exceed the     normal haste cap. Going beyond the current haste cap will only be possible     using one of these bard songs.</li> </ul> <p>You can read the full log with many more interesting facts <a href='http://eq.stratics.com' target='_blank'>here</a>.</font></p> 	</font>

<p><b>Item Changes</b></p>

  <li>Fixed an error in a Stonebrunt quest where an NPC was handing out the

</ul>
<p><b>Miscellaneous</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added some code that might fix a bug with female hair and Erudite hoods
    that caused them to fail to appear sometimes when a helmet was removed. This
    would cause some characters to look as though the back of their head was
    missing at times.</li>
  <li>Mouselook will now work a little differently when in the first two
    third-person camera modes (overhead and chase). They will work similarly to
    first-person mouselook (i.e. your character's heading will change when you
    move the mouse left or right, the left and right movement keys will cause
    your player to strafe, and the camera angle will pitch up or down when you
    move the mouse forward or back). These changes should make those first two
    third-person camera modes more useful.</li>

Sorry about the down-time of the Website and Message Boards.  The ISP's POP which this circuit terminates at just happens to be in the Heart of NYC, right around the corrner where Tuesdays attack took place.  Unfortunately this means that they have been without power ever since Tuesday afternoon and have had to rely on Backup Generators.  The generators however were never meant to run for 3+ days straight and have subsequently burned up and need replaced.<br><br>
I am being told that they will be installing new generators ASAP, and hopefully this news bit won't be too stale by the time you all can read it.

This tidbit was found <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000308.html">here</a>.<br><br>

<B>Just wondering if the change to the Shaman Epic effect was intentional.  Just to clarify.  Curse of the spirits used to be a clickable dot that had some stacking issues with other dots.  The patch message said that it was modified so that the stacking issues were less of a problem.  However now it seem to be a heal over time instead of dot, is this intentional or an accident?<P>Thank<BR>Colal</B><P>That was an accident.<P>We'll get it fixed with the next patch.  I'm sorry for the mistake.  In the mean time it's probably more useful on your allies than on your enemies.  :) <P>Alan<BR></FONT><BR></FONT>

Note: I just read that this is a confirmed bug, they have it fixed, but no word on when they will patch for it.  Also it will only work on the Shaman, a mob, in a Duel or on a PVP server.  So it's quite useless to L60 Shaman with Topor.  I also have not heard if it actually does heal a mob or not.

	<tr>
	  <td width='100%'><font face='verdana' size='2pt'><p><b>Spell Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Changed all enchanter mesmerization spells so that they overwrite Screaming Terror</li>
  <li>Changed Shaman epic effect (Curse of the Spirits) so that it would not conflict with certain Damage over Time spells.</li>
  <li>The Emissary of Thule Necromancer pet is now immune to fear</li>
  <li>Beneficial buffs that don't have an ability drain component on them can now be clicked off.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Miscellaneous Updates</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The server selection screen now only gives information on whether or not a server is up instead of providing player counts.  In addition, the "count" option on the /who command has been restricted to internal personnel.  Servers on the server selection screen are still ordered from least-populated to most populated in order to assist players in choosing the least populated server.</li>
  <li>Harla Dar has been repaired (this happened sometime earlier than today, but we wanted you to know).</li>
  <li>Reactivated broken zone line between Qeynos to the Sewers.  A dead halfling was stuck in the drainpipe and has been removed.</li>
  <li>Fixed a long-standing bug that was causing Feign Death to fail when several characters were on the NPC's hate list along with the character using Feign Death.  We'd like to extend much thanks to the monk community who helped us track this one down.  Also fixed a problem with the monk's 'Block' skill which inadvertantly was recapped at a lower than normal skill level in recent months.  Kudos to "Faned" of the "Monkly Business" bulletin board who brow-beat Gordon with the facts until he gave in and looked at the code :)</li>
  <li>As announced earlier this week, the Belt of the Cenobite was made useable by some inappropriate classes/races in the last patch.  This has been corrected.</li>
  <li>Several quest components in zones with the Trivial Loot Code will now be lootable regardless of level.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Norrathian News</b></p>
<p>Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers.  Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their hometowns.</p>
<p><b>Announcing Test of Tactics III</b></p>
<p>Yes you heard right, Test of Tactics will be making its return to the lands of Norrath in October and November. This event will present teams of 18 members in a battle to the death. Only the strong of body and mind will survive and come out of the arena victorious. For more information on the event and sign up for please look on Harpy's Head Tavern at

*** New Free Zone - Stonebrunt Mountains ***
<br><br>
That's what this patch is all about.  We're adding the Stonebrunt Mountains.  You will need to choose the Optional Patch to download the files you will need to be able to enter the zone.

From the press release:

"Located on the small continent of Odus, the Stonebrunt Mountains are rich with vegetation and distinctive hills that give way to the towering Mount Klaw; the largest mountain in Odus and home to the Kerran village of Kejeka.  The zone of Stonebrunt is designed to be a mid-level, outdoor zone similar in scope and scale to the Lake of Ill Omen on Kunark, which has proven to be a very popular zone in EverQuest."

<p>*** Patch Message *** <br><br>

** Zone Changes ** <br><br>

- Runnyeye has been changed. Something is up in Goblin land... <br><br>

** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes ** <br><br>

- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code. For the most part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to stack that were never intended to stack. <br>
- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds. <br>
- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of Cazic Thule can scribe it. <br>
- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been changed to be more appropriate. <br><br>

** Features and Interface Changes ** <br><br>

- The variable %t will now work with /assist. So you can use /assist %t if you wish. Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist without the %t.<br> 
- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs. <br>
- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to user color 15 (same as other skill messages). The success message was already set to user color 15.<br> 
- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does. It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server. The new ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list (_<#>.ini). The first time a character is created or loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character. <br>
- The Alt key now works in several new situations. It will now show item names when in the trade window. Because the trade items of the local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade item names. <br>
- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank. <br>
- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode. <br>
- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they don't show up otherwise).<br> 
- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any player that is on your /ignore list. Some players were using this to annoy players that had ignored them. <br>
- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to annoy people that had ignored them). <br>
- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the members of your guild in your zone. You can also specify a guild name, such as /who "Irontoe Brigade". <br>
- /safelock command added. /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface (mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash commands) with the password that you supply to the command. You must use this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the interface. Passwords are NOT case-sensitive. So to lock your interface, you would type /safelock password. You would do the same to unlock it. <br><br>

REMEMBER: If you forget what password you typed, you will need to reboot your machine. <br><br>

** Item Changes ** <br><br>

- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.<br> 
- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now. <br>
- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of your waist.<br> 
- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop. They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. <br>
- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable. There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so we had to disable that for these items. <br>
- Sewing Kits: No existing sewing kits are being changed with this patch. But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different. Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots. Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit. <br>
- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray. <br><br>

** Other Stuff ** <br><br>

- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level bard title. :) <br>
- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with that of his counterparts in Velious. This is not the sort of thing that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest. We're announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion. <br><br>
