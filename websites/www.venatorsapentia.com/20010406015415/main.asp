   Absor made some explanations regarding the recent change to the zone line of the Temple of Veeshan zone. Due to the harvesting of the zone line the drops at the entrance were decreased, but to counter this the drops further inside were increased. Absor encouraged people to try out the change, stating that the ratio of drops is about the same.

	     You might have noticed the link to <a href="http://www.migliosoft.com" target="_top">Miglio Soft</a> below the scroll bar to the left.  I was trying to think of a way to thank my good friend Miglio for teaching me the ins and outs of ASP and Database programing when I remembered that he sells some software that he wrote on his web site.  You all will be happy to know that this site has gotten kinda popular and is receiving just over 1000 hits a day.  As a thanks to Miglio I have decided to let him advertise his Screen Saver software here.  I use it at work and at home and like it alot.  I won't go into details on the software since you can read for yourself.
		 <br><br>
		 This is not a precursor to a ton of advertising.  This was just me showing my thanks to a friend.  You'll be happy to know that in trade for this Miglio and I have worked out a deal to set up an items database that will be intergrated into the members list.  I don't think everyone realizes the time that he has dedicated to fixing my mistakes and writing alot of code along the way.  I'm slowly catching on so he won't have to fix my mistakes for ever, but I still wanted everyone to know how much he has done for us.  So please check out his site and software.  Thanks.
		 <br><br>
		 I have some more graphical changes coming in the next couple of days as well.  I've just about got the site to the point were we can start expanding the features rather than make it look good.  I know that is doesn't look quite right in Netscape but I am working on it.  I have kind of slacked of on the Netscape thing because less than 10% of the users that come across the site use Netscape.  I'll get it worked out soon though.
