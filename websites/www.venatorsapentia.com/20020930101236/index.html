Kinda scary when ghosts from the past come back, isn't it! btw, Chaca is still looking for his cash. At any rate, this past week hasn't seen anything too exciting outside of the usual Vex Thal hyjinks!<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/rangerorgy.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
So all my talk of cyber last week has whipped our rangers into a cyberific orgy fest (no pants) one that the forces of nature can barely withstand.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/skanda3.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
But I dont want to try and convince you rangers are drug users who get the munchies or anything... <br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/statixpizza2.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
Well I guess that isn't accurate, what with all the *herbs* they can forage. However, they aren't all bad.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/skanda2.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
Our rangers are also getting malicious in recruiting for their expKS groups.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/izzindie.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br> In the news are reports on our new POP spells. Clerics are excited about the new heal spells.<br><br><img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/dietele.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/xaevretort.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/litodie.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
In all reality, clerics really do need something to offset the new found bloodlust of combat and slip back into healing.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/clericsad.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
I tried convince them otherwise but was met with some pretty stiff opposition when I suggested it.
<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/diedamman.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
Maybe I'm asking too much, or maybe I'm asking for heals to actually save my life.<br><BR>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/healbug.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
At least warrior taunt works. Here, let's watch a warrior use his magical AE taunt to keep the mobs off me.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/adantetaunt.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
Good thing I'm a shaman! You know, a powerful priestly class valued for their offensive capabilities and a solid repertoire of healing and other clerical type spells! <br><BR>

It's the satisfied customers that make my job worthwhile, sorta.<BR><BR>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/alcmenedrool.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
Best part of Vex Thall though, everything but the entry n00b Xakras are dropping these left and right.
<br><br><img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/100ring.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
Maybe next patch they'll put some HP on it or something, as it is now mine is just rotting in bank till then~

btw.

Klaget's been hard at work trying to figure out why I, Damman, surveyor of all I can see, couldn't upload for these wonderful updates. Finally my quest is completed, and I thought I'd share with you my journey to this update.<br>
<br>
The day began as any other ordinary day would, I log in, check a few spawns, swim through the lag infested molasses that is now Sanctus Seru and I thought to myself, I've heard this before, but what is this thing called Cyber? I didn't know much about it earlier, and I had come to a conclusion. I would find this mysterious Cyber no matter the cost.<br>
<br>
My first step in this mystery was to discover what this so called Cyber really was. I turned to my trusted bard. Knowing them to be jacks of all trades,  <br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/happygaypride.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt="">
<br>perhaps he knew, but he was very distracted with... something... under his desk. I didn't know what at the time, but I had my suspicions.<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/aaldainjaw1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Still completely baffled, I sought the council of the oldest living creature in existance, Norl.
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/norlsday.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Much like every worthless old person, he rambled on for good 3 or 4 hours before I was able to escape, continuing on my journey. <br>
<br>
The next day, I found myself no closer to knowing anything about this Cyber. I asked if anyone would explain who or what Cyber was to me.<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/warzrazor1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt="">
<br><br>
Perhaps just a hint?<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/gathuadaptable.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Thus, the revelation. It was indeed something sexual. In the interest of science, I simply had to know what this mystery would reveal. I turned to my friends to see what they knew of it, trying to grasp any straws I could.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/guiporn.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
<br>
Sadly, I accidentally said sex in guild chat, and this went on for several days. However, hope was not completely gone. A shadowy figure stepped forth from his bazaar merchant stall, and whispered some advise to catch this tiger by it's tail. Playing it cool, and lots of cool music.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/coolfonz1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
I had the music down, sure, no problem. Still, I knew there was one critical step missing. To find Cyber, I needed something to lure it in.<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/aeryfantasy1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Well, maybe I didn't afterall. Back to the music! I decided to find the best sexually explicit music I could to lure a Cyber into my trap. <br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/barkinwonka.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Sadly, that got my no where, as I learned this song only motivated the *real world* sexual fantasies. <br><br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/brydenswife1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>
Now I knew I was close. This alleged Cyber was for online only. There had to be a way I could capture it. <br>
<br>
The next day I knew. I journeyed far and wide to find the choicest seat, a throne of Cyber, if you will. Others knowing what I was doing stared on in revered awe.<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/deedlikeu.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Perched from atop my seat I began playing the coolest music known to man, ever.<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/hasselhoff1.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Oh, they flocked towards me left and right. At first, it was just a small amount, a piece here, a piece there.<br><img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/kenliehug.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
Being more proactive I hummed louder, until finally, amidst the chaos of internet~<br>
<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/kalacyber.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br><br>

Success was mine, and I come forth knowing maybe too much of this online web of intrigue we call, Cyber.<br><br>

<img src="http://www.venatorsapentia.com/newsfiles/zweilube.jpg" border="0" align="center" alt=""><br>
<br>
<br>
Tomorrow, with a little rest, and maybe a bucket of ice, I'll share with you our phat lewtz.
