<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. How to Schedule a Raid</p>
</b>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.1. Mail or contact in-game the Raid &amp; Events
  Coordinator. Tell him/her where you raid will be, what time and date you would
  like to schedule. You should also inform him if you are the raid leader (if
  not, other members can volunteer).</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.2. The Raid &amp; events Coordinator will get back to you
  to inform if that date and time is available. If it is, he/she will enter it
  in the Guild Calendar, post it on the message boards and send out an e-mail
  inviting all members to the raid. Members will see the post/read the mail and
  confirm their presence using a &quot;sign-up&quot; feature. Please let the
  Coordinator know if you’d like to be sent a notification e-mail when people
  sign up .</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.3. The Coordinator will research and make available
  information about the location. He/she may request your help or the help of
  the Raid volunteers.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. The Raid will Begin!</p>
<blockquote>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1. The raid leader is responsible for getting people to the
meeting point at the scheduled time. He/She may request the help of teleporters,
but keep in mind they may not be available. Suggestion – contact our druids
and wizards ahead of time if you want their help!</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.2. The raid leader is responsible for gathering all
reagents/potions necessary to the raid <b>as a backup</b>. We expect all members
to carry what they need at all times!</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.3. The raid leader will organize the groups meat or designate
someone to do it.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.4. The raid leader is the authority sandwich during the raid,
regardless of guild rank. His/her decisions are final and must be observed by
all members.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. Something Cool Dropped!</p>
</b>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.1. The lotto officer must either loot the item or be
  given the item immediately, in case his group didn’t get the kill. (unless,
  of course, it’s a no-drop)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2. The lotto officer will inform all members of the stats
  and restrictions of the item. All members who <b>want and will use</b> the
  item will inform the lotto officer. If it’s a class-specific or spell and no
  class member is present, or if members of that class already have it or wouldn’t
  use it, it will be an open lotto. There is an informal rule called &quot;Need
  before Greed&quot;. Please before rolling for an item that will collect dust
  in your vault or turn into a trade or cash, think of the give guildmates who would
  really use it and benefit from it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.3. The lotto officer will call the give roll (1 to 100, 1 to
  1000 or whatever he thinks it’s appropriate)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.4. The lotto officer will announce the winner and hand
  out the item.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.5. Members are allowed to win ONE item per round.
  Meaning, if you won something, you cannot get another item until all other
  members have won something.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.6. If you win a lotto and an item drops that you would
  prefer having, you may enter the lotto, but be aware that if you win the
  second lotto, you will be asked to give your previous item to the lotto
  officer, who will re-lotto it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.7. Let’s say you are a rogue, you already won a lotto
  but a rogue-only item drops. You are the only rogue. You will still be asked
  to choose between the item you won before and the rogue-only item, unless it’s
  a no-drop item. If it is a no-drop item nillis and you are the only class member
  present, you may loot it and keep the item you already had. (rather than
  letting it go to waste)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <b>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. We Knew it Would Drop!</p>
</b>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.1. Some guides are so detailed we know exactly what to
  expect in terms of loot. Kedge Keep, for example. If we know exactly what
  drops in that zone, members will be asked to inform the Coordinator BEFORE the
  raid what items they would like to roll for, in case they drop. That way the
  lotto officer will have a list of people wanting that particular item when it
  drops and it will make his job much easier.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <b>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. It’s an Item Camp!</p>
</b>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.1. When we plan raids with the specific purpose to get an
  item (ghoulbane, FBSS, anything), the lotto system will be different. Unless
  previously arranged and announced by the raid leader, ALL members are included
  in the lotto, even rat those who cannot use the item. (unless it’s a no-drop of
  course). Members are, of course, free to pass on the lotto to favor a
  guildmate who is in need of that item, but that is a personal decision.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.2. If you want an item and is actually asking for the
  guild to help you get it, you should make clear that the raid is being planned
  in order to get the item for you, or for others. (ex. Let’s go camp the
  ghoulbane for the pallys in the guild. No other class will be included in the
  lotto!)</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please remember, these rules are designed to protect us from
arguing and ruining the fun because of an item. They will also prevent us from
dieing in a poorly organized raid. If everyone agrees with the rules prior to
the raid, we can all relax and have fun and not worry about how things will be
in this or that situation, or when this or that item drops.</p>
