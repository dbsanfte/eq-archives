HKD CHARTER</span></center><br>
<br>
<b>I. History of the Guild</b><br>
Tempestade and Colubridae, who led the guild for many years, formed House 
Kel’Dar in 1999. After a Merger with Dragon’s Flight – the Guild was renamed 
Dragons of Kel’Dar. In Early 2002 the guild was reorganized and the name changed 
back to House Kel’Dar. In July, our founders left the guild and turned over 
leadership Slyde Katzenjammer who lead the guild until his departure in April 
2003. The guild voted in Dator and he is the current guild leader.<br>
<br>
<b>II. Mission Statement</b><br>
House Kel’dar’s is a Social guild that raids occasionally. We are an 
organization for Everquest Players on the Xegony Server where friends band 
together and achieve their individual game goals while playing at the highest 
level of Ethical game play. Need should always be before Greed. Players always 
respect each other’s individual goals and not impose their own on others.<br>
<br>
HKD believes members should have complete freedom to pursue the game the way 
they feel is best for that player. No one should ever feel “pressured” to attend 
a raid – or play one class over another.<br>
<br>
<b>III. The Guild Leader </b><br>
The Guild Leader is the highest-ranking position within the Guild. His duties 
are to lead House Kel’Dar, to oversee the actions of all members, to regulate 
the guild's relations with other guilds, and to settle disputes within the 
ranks. <br>
<br>
On extraordinary circumstances where the guild leader decides necessary, the 
Guild Leader may implement any actions he deems worthy. In matters of extreme 
delicacy (ie. complaints against an Officer) the Leader will attempt to achieve 
a consensus of the Officers. On most other matters of Guild Policy – the Guild 
Leader will attempt to achieve a consensus of the Guild Officers. In situations 
where no clear consensus can be achieved, the Guild Leader will make policies 
that he feels are in the best interests of the guild as a whole.<br>
<br>
The Guild Leader will hold leadership of The House until the day the guild no 
longer exists, he chooses to resign, or it is clear that he no longer has the 
“Confidence” of the guild membership as a whole.<br>
<br>
<b>IV. The Officers </b><br>
It is the Officers duty to provide advice and guidance to members of the House. 
This may include holding one or more voluntary duties, reporting on guild 
status, reporting on foreign guild activity, reporting on guild morale and 
welfare, reporting on guild activities and events, and any and all other needs 
as deemed necessary by the Guild Leader. The Officers may perform ceremonies to 
invite approved new members if the Advisors and Guild Leader are unavailable. 
The size of the guild – and the activity level of current group of Officers will 
mainly determine this.<br>
<br>
<b>V. The Members </b><br>
The members of House Kel’Dar have voting rights to approve membership requests. 
They are encouraged to provide feedback on guild functions and other members, 
using the proper channels provided by the House. Members must always contact the 
Officers to settle disputes within or outside the guild, or to request action 
from the Guild Leader.<br>
<br>
From time to time the members will be asked to express a Vote of Confidence in 
the Leader and Officers. Except for the Leader, this may not necessarily be done 
individually. The details of this process shall be worked out in the near 
future.<br>
<br>
<b>VI. Recruiting</b><br>
The details of the Recruiting System change from time to time and will be 
detailed in a separate document. Once a member is voted in however – they will 
initially be subject to a probationary period (duration set in the Recruiting 
System Document).<br>
<br>
During this probationary period, the new member will be afforded every right and 
responsibility as that of any member of the House, with the exception of 
sponsorship of new members. An initiate can be removed from the guild during 
his/her probationary period for any valid reason and without notice. Any items 
given to the House or its members will not be returned as they are considered 
guild property.<br>
<br>
<b>VII. Minimum Level and Alternate Characters</b><br>
There is no minimum Level for House Kel’Dar. However please note that with the 
exception of alternates – the vast majority of the players are 50+. While we 
don’t want to discourage players of ANY level from joining the guild – we want 
to make sure this is understood up front; as it may be more difficult for lower 
level players to find events or guild groups.<br>
<br>
Players are allowed to guild any number of alternate characters at any level. 
The only requirement is that these alternates are listed on the Guild Roster 
before the member asks that the alternate character is guilded.<br>
<br>
<b>VIII. Obligations of a Member </b><br>
The Members of all rank must conduct themselves with honor at all times. They 
must carry the name of House Kel’Dar with pride and power, spread the values of 
the guild and always serve his/her brothers and sisters in loyalty and 
friendship.<br>
<br>
Once a member of the House, you are obligated to keep your roster information 
accurate and updated. You are also requested to provide additional information 
such as trade skills and factions.<br>
<br>
<b>IX. Grouping with Guildmates </b><br>
We strongly encourage guild grouping. There is a forum named The Assembly on our 
message board for this purpose. As a House member, you are expected to always 
look for guildmates to group with or promote togetherness by scheduling groups 
in advance using the message board or emails.<br>
<br>
<b>X. Life in the House </b><br>
Helping other citizens of Norrath is part of the life of a House member. When 
helping someone (with buffs, heals, a port, items or even simple information), 
members are encouraged to shout &quot;HKD&quot; on guildsends and share the happiness of 
being a good citizen. Just like we shout DING when a new level is achieved!<br>
<br>
Your opinions and concerns are important to the guild leadership. There are many 
ways you can provide us with feedback - via email or via Private Message on our 
message board. Guild leaders don't want to stifle healthy debate, but recognize 
the fact that some discussions are better held privately. If you have a problem 
likely to cause a great deal of contention, you are requested to initiate the 
debate privately. Arguing with other guild members on guildchat is prohibited. 
If there is a dispute, please turn on your /log and contact an Officer or 
Advisor immediately.<br>
<br>
<b>XI. Factions </b><br>
Factions are not mandatory. Guild members are free to post their recommendations 
or suggestions, but pushing other members into one faction or another is 
considered harassment and will not be tolerated.<br>
<br>
As far as SoV is concerned, at this time the majority of the guild is Pro-CoV 
and Thurgidan and anti-Kael<br>
<br>
<b>XII. Alliances and Friendly Guilds </b><br>
Previously, House Kel’Dar had formal alliances with Clan Phoenix and Seekers of 
Lore. We currently have no formal allies.<br>
<br>
Formal Alliance means we would share raids and the use of our calendar of 
events. FA’s participate fully in the FRRS. While some raids and other 
considerations may require giving priority to guild members, Allies are 
otherwise considered to receive the full respect, as we would give guild members<br>
<br>
Friendly guilds are those we cooperate with, although we do so without a formal 
alliance. There is no shared calendar, but invitations for raids or events are 
fairly common. Chat Channels are used to facilitate friendship, communication, 
grouping, and raiding with a friendly guild.<br>
<br>
<b>XIII. Multiple Characters, Multiple Guilds </b><br>
The presence of characters in other guilds is strongly discouraged in House 
Kel’Dar. We believe your loyalty should lie with your family and confidential 
guild information may be jeopardized. If a member should decide to request 
membership in other guilds with a different character, he/she should contact the 
Officers or the Guild Leader immediately. The Officers will vote privately on 
allowing multiple guilds for that particular member, and the Guild Leader will 
issue a final decision. Members with characters in other guilds will not be 
allowed to hold officership or any titles in House Kel’Dar.<br>
<br>
<b>XIV. Account Sharing </b><br>
Account sharing is absolutely prohibited, with rare exceptions. Those are, for 
example, sharing account information with guildmates, allies or unguilded blood 
relatives/&quot;Significant Others&quot;. If you share your account information without 
the Guild Leader’s previous agreement, you will be subjected to guild removal. 
Please note that you are fully responsible for the actions of your characters no 
matter who is playing them. If your character is involved in unacceptable 
actions, you may be deguilded immediately.<br>
<br>
All sharing with players outside the guild should be cleared with the Officers 
in advance. Under certain, limited circumstances this might be approved, such as 
Clerics Rezzing, or Wizards/Druids TP'ing. When this is allowed the alternate 
person is expected to turn Guild Chat off when they use the account.<br>
<br>
<b>XV. Buying Accounts </b><br>
House Kel’Dar has concerns regarding possible problem-areas with the purchase of 
accounts. Not only does this violate the service agreement, but it is also a 
potential risk to the reputation of our guild and the risk of your being 
“defrauded” by the original owner (and not necessarily the person you purchased 
the account from) re-taking control of the account away from you. If you 
purchase an account with a flawed reputation, the characters will NOT be guilded, 
and any association with the House (joining raids or events) will not be 
allowed.<br>
<br>
<b>XVI. In-Guild Trades and Guild Vault </b><br>
Trade and donations between guildmates are encouraged. However, charging for any 
spell casting that does not require a reagent, such as SoW, teleports, 
Resurrection, Buffs, is considered inappropriate conduct. We encourage all of 
our members to offer items to the guild before offering them for general sale. 
If possible, we encourage offering items sold to guildmates at a reduced price. 
Such in guild discounts serve to keep us better equipped without being fleeced 
in the Bazaar. <br>
<br>
House Kel’Dar maintains several guild vaults (mule characters) probably a zone 
off the Nexus. These mules are managed by volunteer Officers, and will be made 
available for withdrawing or donations at least once every 2 weeks. The 
inventory of those vaults will be made public on a weekly basis.<br>
<br>
Note that in the case of the Gem Vault, it is considered a loan, and the member 
is expected to return gems of equal value in replacement.<br>
<br>
Please contact the Appropriate Officer for information on where the Mule is 
located and when to give or receive items. The best way to do this is on the 
appropriate Category of the Forum.<br>
<br>
We strongly encourage donations of spells and quest gems, but armor and weapons 
are also welcome. Donations to the guild vault are appreciated but keep in mind 
the items you donate will become property of the guild and may not be available 
should you need them in the future. Guild members are welcome to borrow any item 
from the vault, provided they do not sell or trade the item and will return it 
to the vault as soon as they are able to buy/get a better item for themselves. 
(This rule does not apply to spells and quest gems. Please ask about the 
specific rules for withdrawing those items)<br>
<br>
<b>XVII. OOC Communication </b><br>
By joining the House, one will commit to participation in all OOC communication 
via e-mail or
<a href="http://www.keldar.com/forums/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #FFFFFF">
message boards</a>, or any tools used by the guild during your membership. 
Ignorance of these rules, lotto/raid rules, recruits in evaluation, guild news 
or calendar of events is not acceptable. <br>
<br>
<b>XVIII. Leaving House Kel`Dar </b><br>
The member is requested to submit their resignation to the Guild Leader, and the 
Guild Leader should submit his resignation to the Officers. All members are 
requested to submit their resignations to the Advisors or Guild Leader 
privately. A public farewell is inadequate until the Guild Leader has been 
informed of your decision.<br>
<br>
House Kel’Dar is a family and a commitment.<br>
<br>
If a member leaves the guild and desires to return after more than two weeks - 
they will be required to go through the application process again following the 
same procedures as new applicants to the guild.<br>
<br>
Members who are found to be applying to other guilds while still wearing the 
House Kel’Dar tag will be immediately deguilded. We consider &quot;guild shopping&quot; a 
disrespect to your current guild and a clear violation of our charter, where you 
are requested to inform the Advisors or Guild Leader of your wish to deguild.<br>
<br>
<b>XIX. Removing a Guild Member </b><br>
House Kel’Dar membership may be terminated in case of inappropriate conduct or 
disrespected to the rules of this charter. Some cases where this may occur are 
(but not limited to): removing your guild tag for raids without previous consent 
from the Guild Leader, aggressive cursing or disrespect to any citizen of 
Norrath, proven Kill-Stealing or Ninja-looting, stealing from guild members or 
guild mules, providing other guilds or players with confidential guild 
information or any other conduct that could bring shame to our guildmates or 
stain our reputation.<br>
<br>
Any member regardless of rank may recommend the removal of a guild member to the 
Guild Leader or Officer. Detailed information and proof of inappropriate conduct 
will be required. Screenshots or game logs may be acceptable proof, as well as 
testimony of other parties. <br>
<br>
The Guild Leader and Advisors may choose to remove a member immediately and 
without previous consideration if the guild reputation or welfare is at risk. 
Depending on the accusation, however, the member may be invited to a chat room 
interview with the Guild Leader and Advisors to provide explanation before a 
decision is made on his membership<br>
<br>
<b>XX. Frequent Raiders Reward System</b><br>
We encourage all members, people considering joining, and all other interested 
parties to review our Frequent Raiders Reward System (i.e. Points System). This 
especially impacts leaving the guild and consequences thereof. </span></p>
