                <b>Growing Pains</b><br />
                Well, we've had our share of growing pains lately, and had a few outages but I think they've been fixed for the most part and everything seems to be running smoothly once again, and very fast :).  Please, if anyone has any problems whatsoever, do not hesitate to contact us.  We're almost always available to help.<br/>
                <br/><b>Advertising Brochure</b><br />
                A very good friend of mine has just finished our advertising brochure and you can view it by clicking <a href="wbs.pdf" target="_new">here</a>.  Any comments are appreciated.<br /><br />

                Everything has been installed although we may be moving some things around over the next several
                days.  Please email me or call me with questions and I'll be stopping around to everyone's house
                over the next several days to ensure a smooth transition.  You really shouldn't even have to change
                anything as the switch over should be transparent to you.<br><br>

                I'd like to give a big thanks to Tom Allshouse, Eric Jackson, and Frank over at amerinex.net for putting
                up with me over the last several days, it's been a trying experience but all is good.
