                So what is WBS Wireless?
                </div>
                <div class="newsbody">
                A good summary is a community of internet users that finally got tired of horrible access to the internet that decided to take matters into their own hands.  It started as an idea, and then some help from the NOVA Wireless group.  What WBS Wireless is from a technical point of view is a wireless access point to the internet.  It's built on a 802.11b Wireless LAN that itself is connected via a T-1 to the internet.<br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="newstitle">
                What Services do you Provide?
                </div>
                <div class="newsbody">
                Enough of the soap box, why should someone use WBS Wireless for their internet?<br /><br />
                1) <b>High speed</b>.  In fact, the speed of our line can go as high as 1.544Mbps in both directions (upload and download), and your connection to our server (including the email) can run upwards of 6Mbps and it shouldn't ever cost you more then $50.00/month.  We're trying to get the price as low as $40.00/month, maybe even less.<br /><br />
                2) <b>Static IP or dynamic IP addresses</b>.  We'll give you either a static IP address or a dynamic IP address.  The benefits of dynamic IP addresses is that you're protected from many hackers.  Static IP addresses give you the capability to provide web services directly to the internet and have a domain name setup that people can use to reach your computer.<br /><br />
                3) <b>No limitations on your bandwidth usage</b>.  We do ask that you don't use our service to spam people.  Should you choose that route, then be prepared to have any charges we encur passed directly onto you.<br /><br />
                4) <b>Unlimited number of email addresses</b> so long as those people reside within your residence (and even those rules are flexible).  Just let us know why you need the addresses and you'll more then likely get them.<br /><br />
                5) <b>100MB of disk space</b> to use as you wish and that disk space is directly accessible via a Windows share.  Just drag and drop your files onto your private disk space and you're done.<br /><br />
                6) <b>Web server space</b> that is linked to your 100MB of space so you can create your own web site.  Want to run an online store?  Go right ahead and you can bet Adelphia won't give you the help we will<br /><br />
                7) <b>Apache Tomcat</b>.  If you know what this means, then you'll love it.  If you don't know what Tomcat is, essentially it's server side Java that allows users to create complex web applications and install them on our server.<br /><br />
                8) <b>No wires</b> (other then a USB cable from the network adapter to your machine).<br /><br />
                9) <b>Connect your home LAN to the internet</b>.  We'll explain how to hook your entire home LAN to our service and what's involved.  There is no extra charge for this beyond what the hardware costs, you will still pay the same low price.  We only ask that you keep the access to within your home.<br /><br />
                10) <b>Handy Technical Support</b>.  Assuming it's before 10PM, just send me an ICQ, an email, or stop by.  I'm pretty flexible about what I'll help you with.  If there's a problem, then I'll post something on our web site as soon as the problem is detected.  More then likely the connection between WBS Wireless and you is ok, so even if the internet connection goes down, you should still be able to access our web site to see if a problem has been reported and what the status is.<br /><br />
                11) We're your neighbors and we've been doing this for a LONG time, probably more then most of the people that work at Adelphia or any other service provider.  Dave is a Software Engineer by trade, and Saqib is a Network Engineer.  Both of us are very professional and pride ourselves on excellence in what we do.  To us, you're a friend and a neighbor, not just a customer.  We have to live near you, so you can bet we want you to be happy.  If there's ever a problem, please do not hesitate to ask us and we'll do our best to remedy the situation.<br /><br />
                12) Wireless is powerful and convenient, and you can bet the "big boys" are afraid of this.  There have been many recent articles describing the massive rush to provide wireless internet access to end users and you can bet that wired providers are worried about it.  There is also a large "grass-roots" movement and cottage industry doing exactly what we're doing, and people simply love the freedom that wireless provides to them.<br />
