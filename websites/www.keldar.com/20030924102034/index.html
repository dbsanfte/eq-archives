		With the addition of a new customer, I'm at a point where we can have our first price reduction (Woot)!  I'll be letting you each know which month your decrease will occur, but everyone will have received it by your September payment (that's for the month of October for those of you keeping track).  I'd like to thank all of you for sticking with WBS Wireless and I hope everything's been running smoothly.  If anyone's interested, in the last year (since we recently celebrated our first year) we've experienced less then about 6 hours of down time.  That's a 99.8% uptime :).  Thanks again to everyone.

		Well, after building that Excel spreadsheet, a friend of mine showed me a fantastic site <a href="http://www.dvdprofiler.com">DVD Profiler</a>.  Just download their free application and enter in the UPCs of all your DVDs.  It then builds a comprehensive catalog of your collection including artwork and information about the movies.  Anyhow, I re-entered my collection and you can view it online <a href="http://www.dvdprofiler.com/mycollection.asp?alias=S_q_u_i_d">HERE</a>.  I highly recommend this site to help track your DVDs.  There's even a way to track who a particular DVD is loaned to :P.

		The new UPS is now installed and should suffice for keeping the entire system up for a reasonable period of time during a power outage.  Everything critical to the system remaining up is now on these new UPSes including the wireless amplifier.  For those of you who are not on our physical power grid, you should still be able to surf if our area loses power.  Sorry for any interruptions last night.  Of course if you share the same physical power circuit as me, I can't help you unless you want to invest in a UPS for your systems as well.  <a class="menubar" href="mailto:dbixler@wbs-wireless.com?subject=How do I get a UPS?">Email me</a> for details :).<br/><br/>
		<b>FAQ Page in the Works</b><br/>
		We've really been getting a lot of requests lately for service (10 requests in the last 4 days).  Some are close and some are fairly distant.  Some of the questions involove the antenna needed to get service.  I'm working on a "FAQ" page and hope to have that ready soon.  This FAQ will cover such things as: "Can I get your service where I am," "What kind of antenna do I need," and "What kind of networking equipment do I need."  With any luck, I can have the beginnings of a FAQ page up tomorrow.  Hopefully this will help people to understand how we work :).  However, we can't cover all the questions so keep the emails coming if you need help :).

                <b>New Developments</b><br />
                Things have been running very well as of late.  Next week, WBS Wireless will be mentioned in an article in the Washington Post about internet service providers in Loudoun County, VA.  Also, we're going to be doing some long distance testing with some folks over in Ashburn Village (about 1.5 miles).  We're going to be establishing a long distance connection to offer service to several people.  If you live in the central to western edge of Ashburn Village, it should soon be possible to get high-speed wireless internet service through WBS Wireless.  Stay tuned for information about this new development.
