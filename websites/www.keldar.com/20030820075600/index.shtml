		Apparently, some company called www.fastmail.fm has decided to use my email server to forward out over 100,000 SPAM messages.  I'm currently dealing with this security hole and will be investigating this for the next few days.  My appologies to anyone whom has received email relayed by my server that was sent out by these jerks.

		The new UPS is now installed and should suffice for keeping the entire system up for a reasonable period of time during a power outage.  Everything critical to the system remaining up is now on these new UPSes including the wireless amplifier.  For those of you who are not on our physical power grid, you should still be able to surf if our area loses power.  Sorry for any interruptions last night.  Of course if you share the same physical power circuit as me, I can't help you unless you want to invest in a UPS for your systems as well.  <a class="menubar" href="mailto:dbixler@wbs-wireless.com?subject=How do I get a UPS?">Email me</a> for details :).<br/><br/>
		<b>FAQ Page in the Works</b><br/>
		We've really been getting a lot of requests lately for service (10 requests in the last 4 days).  Some are close and some are fairly distant.  Some of the questions involove the antenna needed to get service.  I'm working on a "FAQ" page and hope to have that ready soon.  This FAQ will cover such things as: "Can I get your service where I am," "What kind of antenna do I need," and "What kind of networking equipment do I need."  With any luck, I can have the beginnings of a FAQ page up tomorrow.  Hopefully this will help people to understand how we work :).  However, we can't cover all the questions so keep the emails coming if you need help :).

                The network will be coming down for about 10 minutes tonight around 11PM EST to install a new UPS on the Cisco router, wireless routers, and wired switches to ensure that the system will stay up better in the event of a power outage.  Sorry for any problems.

                Had to upgrade our Cisco router to better support IPSec and Tunneling so people can get into work VIA their VPNs.  Sorry for the inconvenience, but it only too about 15 minutes.  Now people who want to use a VPN to get to their offices should have no problems.  Cheers :)!

                <b>New Developments</b><br />
                Things have been running very well as of late.  Next week, WBS Wireless will be mentioned in an article in the Washington Post about internet service providers in Loudoun County, VA.  Also, we're going to be doing some long distance testing with some folks over in Ashburn Village (about 1.5 miles).  We're going to be establishing a long distance connection to offer service to several people.  If you live in the central to western edge of Ashburn Village, it should soon be possible to get high-speed wireless internet service through WBS Wireless.  Stay tuned for information about this new development.
