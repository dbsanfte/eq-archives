<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">By decree of the members present at the formation of
the guild known as Dragons of Kel`Dar we acknowledge our government herewith and
declare ourselves unified with all the powers and judgment of formal assembly.
Recognition of name shall be observed herewith as Dragons of Kel`Dar.<br>
<br>
<br>
We of Dragons of Kel`Dar bind ourselves together in friendship and camaraderie
for the purpose of adventure and fun. We stake our claim to the principles of
honor and valor. We abide by the law set forth in the Writ of Dragons of Kel`Dar
and honor our leaders with our duty. We shun spoilers of fun. We do not propose
war with any other. We will defend our members and the honor of Dragons of
Kel`Dar at all costs. We will uphold the virtues of the Guild's way in all
things.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Charge of Dragons of Kel`Dar describes and ordains the individual duties
of each rank and office within the Guild of Dragons of Kel`Dar.<br>
</b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4">The Guild Leader</font></b></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The Guild Leader is the highest-ranking position
within the Guild. His/her duties are to lead Dragons of Kel`Dar with honor and
valor, to oversee the actions of all members, to uphold the Writ of The Dragons
of Kel`Dar, to regulate the guild's relations with foreign guilds, and to settle
disputes within the ranks. The Leader may implement any actions they deem
worthy. The Leader may perform promotion and induction ceremonies. Upon the
advice of the Council of Justice of Dragons of Kel`Dar, the Leader may implement
his/her recommendation for action against a member. The Leader has the right to
veto any action of the other members with the exception of a decision by
majority of the Council of Justice. The members of the guild agree to abide by
the leader decisions or decree.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The guild leader is elected by popular vote of all
members in the guild, with the exception of those in probation. Every </font><font FACE="Verdana Ref" COLOR="#0000ff">(4)</font><font FACE="Verdana Ref">
months, on the First of the month, a popular election shall be held to confirm
or replace the Guild Leader.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref" size="4"><b>The Council of Justice</b></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The Council of Justice has 3 members with distinct
roles but still acting as unity to make decisions concerning the guild.
Councilors are elected by popular vote and confirmed or replaced, individually
or completely, every </font><font FACE="Verdana Ref" COLOR="#0000ff">4</font><font FACE="Verdana Ref">
months, on the First day of the month. Councilors must be Officers before they
can ascend to the Council of Justice.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The roles performed by the Council of Justice are
recruitment, liaison with the Xegony Alliance and coordination of raids and
events. In order to fulfill these roles, Councilors can request the assistance
of volunteers (Officers or Members).</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The Council of Justice or the Councilors
individually hold the leadership of Dragons of Kel`Dar in the absence of the
Guild Leader. Their decisions must always come from consensus, and their
discussions are private unless they choose to make them public. Even by
consensus, the Councilors cannot invite new members who have not been previously
approved by the Guild Leader and/or by popular vote. The Council of Justice can
veto a decision made by the Guild Leader if they reach unanimity in that
decision.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The Councilors may rotate in their duties or perform
more than one role.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">A Councilor can be dismissed by the Guild Leader or
the remaining Councilors in case of inappropriate conduct or lack of
interest/dedication in performing his/her role as a councilor.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref"><font size="4"><b>The Officers</b></font><br>
<br>
It is the Officers duty to provide advice to the Council of Justice upon their
request. This may include holding one or more voluntary duties, assisting
councilors with duties, reporting on guild status, reporting on foreign guild
activity, reporting on guild morale and welfare, reporting on guild activities
and events, and any and all other needs as deemed necessary by the council. The
Officers may perform ceremonies to invite new members if the councilors and
Leader are unavailable.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b>The Members</b></font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The members of Dragons of Kel`Dar have voting rights
to confirm/replace the Guild Leader and Council of Justice, as well as the
removal or invitation of a guild member. They must go to the Council of Justice
to request assistance or provide feedback on guild rules and structure.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref"><br>
<font size="4"><b>Recruitment</b></font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">All members are encouraged to recruit. Members
should refer applicants to the recruitment officer. The officer will inform the
interested party of our theme and what we represent and contact a Class Officer.
A Class Officer is a high level member of that particular class who will
evaluate the recruit in his/her knowledge and character. If a potential
candidate has a continued interest in membership they should be supplied with a
copy of our charter, review it and fill out the application. After evaluation of
the Recruitment Officer and Class Officer, all members will be encouraged to
vote. During the recruitment process, the recruit’s name and information will
be made available so members can talk to him before casting their votes. At
least one member of Dragons of Kel`Dar must support all applications with
letters of recommendation, either at the beginning or at the end of the
application process. The Council of Justice or the Guild Leader can veto the
membership of a recruit approved by popular vote with a valid reason.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Verdana Ref">Should the recruit be elected to
become a member, he will serve Dragons of Kel`Dar on a probationary period to be
determined by the Leader or Council on a case by case basis but no less than 1
week. During this probationary period, the new member will be afforded every
right and responsibility as that of any member of Dragons of Kel`Dar, except
voting rights. An initiate can be removed from the guild during his/her
probationary period for any reason and without advanced notice. Any items given
to Dragons of Kel`Dar or its members will not be returned as they are considered
guild property.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b>Our Moral Standards</b></font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The Members of all rank must conduct themselves with
honor at all times. They must carry the name of Dragons of Kel`Dar with pride
and power, spread the values of the guild and always serve his/her brothers and
sisters in loyalty and friendship.<br>
<br>
Marriages will be observed and respected by all of Dragons of Kel`Dar in and
outside of our ranks. Marriages of a character between more than two persons
will not be recognized. Marriages between a member and a non-member and between
different races are allowed. Marriage does not require a formal ceremony. If
persons wish to make known their marriage in order to have it acknowledged and
recognized by Dragons of Kel`Dar, said persons should inform the Council of
their status. All members will recognize divorce. It is the responsibility of
the divorcees to inform the Council of their status if they wish to make known
their separation.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><b>Multiple Characters, Multiple Guilds</b></font></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The presence of other characters in other guilds is
strongly discouraged in Dragons of Kel`Dar. We believe your loyalty should lie
with your family and confidential guild information may be jeopardized. If a
member should decide to request membership in other guilds with a different
character, he/she should contact the Council or the Leader immediately.
Councilors and/or Leader will vote privately on allowing multiple guilds for
that particular member.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">Members with characters in other guilds will not be
accepted into the Council of Justice but may hold officership in Dragons of
Kel`Dar, at the discretion of Council and Leader.</font></p>
<font FACE="Verdana Ref" SIZE="2"></font>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref" size="4"><b>Promotion of a Member</b></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">Officer status will be granted to members of Dragons
of Kel`Dar by decision of the Council of Justice and/or the Guild Leader.
Promotions are based on dedication and services to the guild, time in the guild,
advancement of your character and relationship with the other guild members.</font></p>
<font FACE="Verdana Ref" SIZE="2"></font>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref" size="4"><b>Guild Meetings</b></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">Dragons of Kel`Dar members are requested to join
monthly guild meetings, usually held at the Lake Rathe Arena or East Commonlands
Tunnel. During the meeting, the Guild Leader and Councilors will have an agenda
of topics to be discussed, and will request participation of all members. Duels,
off topic comments and unrelated emotes are considered inappropriate behavior
and a member may be requested to leave the meeting.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The Councilors or Guild Leader may call additional
meetings to address emergency issues.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The Council of Justice will meet with the Guild
Leader bi-weekly in chat room. Officers and volunteers may be invited to attend
some or part of these meetings.</font></p>
<font FACE="Verdana Ref" SIZE="2"></font>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref" size="4"><b>In-Guild Trades</b></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">Trade and donations between guildmates is
encouraged. However, charging for any spell casting that does not require a
reagent, such as SoW, teleports, Resurrection, Buffs, is considered
inappropriate conduct.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">Dragons of Kel`Dar maintains a guild vault (mule
characters) usually around the East Commonlands tunnel. Donations to the guild
vault are appreciated but keep in mind the items you donate will become property
of the guild and may not be available should you need them in the future. Guild
members are welcome to borrow any item from the vault, provided they do not sell
or trade the item and will return it to the vault as soon as they are able to
buy/get a better item for themselves.</font></p>
<font FACE="Verdana Ref" SIZE="2"></font>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref" size="4"><b>OOC Communication</b></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">By joining Dragons of Kel`Dar, one will commit to
participation in all OCC communication via e-mail or message board, or any tools
used by the guild during your membership. Ignorance of these rules, lotto/raid
rules, recruits in evaluation or calendar of events is not acceptable.</font></p>
<font FACE="Verdana Ref" SIZE="2"></font>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref" size="4"><b>Leaving Dragons of Kel`Dar</b></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref"><br>
The Councilors are requested to submit their resignation to the Guild Leader,
and the Guild Leader should submit his/her resignation to the Council of Justice
either in person or via email. All members are requested to submit their
resignations to the Council or Leader privately. After a brief interview, that
member will be encouraged to share his/her decision with the whole guild.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">Dragons of Kel`Dar is a family and a commitment.
Should a member choose to leave and later decide to return, it will be up to the
Guild Leader and/or Council of Justice to restore or not his membership. A
probationary period may apply.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">Members who leave the guild and return will not have
membership restored more than twice. After that, he/she will be subject to the
normal recruitment process. If this member chooses to leave once again, a future
application for membership will not be accepted.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">Officers and Councilors who leave the guild twice
will also lose their officership.</font></p>
<font FACE="Verdana Ref" SIZE="2"></font>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref" size="4"><b>Removing a Guild Member</b></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">Dragons of Kel`Dar membership may be terminated in
case of inappropriate conduct or disrespected to the rules of this charter. Some
cases where this may occur are (but not limited to): aggressive cursing or
disrespect to any citizen of Norrath, proven Kill-Stealing or Ninja-looting,
stealing from guild members or guild mules, providing other guilds or players
with confidential guild information or any other conduct that could bring shame
to our guildmates or stain our reputation.<br>
<br>
Any member regardless of rank may recommend the removal of a guild member to
Council or Leader. Detailed information and proof of inappropriate conduct will
be required. Screenshots or game logs may be acceptable proof, as well as
testimony of other parties.</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Verdana Ref">The Council of Justice and/or Guild Leader may
choose to remove a member immediately and without previous consideration if the
guild reputation or welfare is at risk. Depending on the accusation, however,
the member may be invited to a chat room interview with Councilors and/or Leader
to provide explanation before a decision is made on his membership.</font></p>
