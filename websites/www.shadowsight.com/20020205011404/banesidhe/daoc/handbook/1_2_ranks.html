    <td><p>Dark Age of Camelot has 9 fully customizable ranks in the guild. 9 is the lowest and 1 is the highest. The Guildmaster is Rank 0, and the only thing that can be customized for Rank 0 is the Title.</p>

<p>Upcoming abilities will be whether a person can deposit to the guild bank and withdraw from the guild bank, and more may be in the works.</p>
