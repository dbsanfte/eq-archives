		<br><p>Looking back<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Looking back from 50+ seasons of wandering first Norrath and then Luclin I wonder how I survived all that these two planets have offered me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 I have been told that I was born in Qeynos Hills, and grew up in Surefall Glade. The Glade was my world for my formative years. The trees and the bears were my friends, my special companions and my soul mates as a child. Unlike many other children of Surefall I could walk amongst the bears freely, tending to their hurts, and playing with the bear cubs. The bear mothers never hurt me, sometimes even giving me a small area of their wondrously lush fur to snuggle against when I was tired.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 My father had the healing touch, being blessed by Karana and my mother was just that, a wondrous lady that had a inner strength and hardness that rivaled any steel that I had ever seen. Both watched closely as I developed into a nature tenderer and one that loved nature in all its flavors. It was only natural that upon attaining my 7th season I would be apprenticed to the Druid of the Grove. I tearfully left my family, not knowing what was to become of me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 The Great Druid, as I called him then and still do, was kind, generous and stern all in one package. The chores he made me do, all day every day...just to set the discipline in this young sapling that would pay very high dividends in the future.  He taught me much of Karana that my father could not know.  He taught me of Karana’s blessings and power. The power behind the idea, harnessing the natural elements and the power of the storms that Karana controls.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Once I became of age where he could not, or would not teach me any more I was given a weapon, a tunic, a letter of introduction and told to seek out the high priest of Karana in the Glade.  Once I had introduced myself and was inducted into the order, I was considered an adult and was expected to spread the word of Karana and HIS works throughout Norrath.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The journey is not ended...yet<br><br>
