If you need a reasy, consider that older browsers contain SERIOUS security issues that allow nefarious web developers to take complete control of your Hard Drive, including the ability to delete and format the whole thing.  You don't believe me?  Go look up anything regarding Netscape Navigator 2.0.</p>
	<p>The 2 major browsers are Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.  Do a search for one of those names, you'll find out where to download them.</p>
