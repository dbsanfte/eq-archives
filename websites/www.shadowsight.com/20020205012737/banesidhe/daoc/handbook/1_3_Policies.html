	<td class="header">Recruiting Policy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><p>Recruiting is a very important part of a guild.  Without it we stagnate and wither, too much too fast and we get so large that the guild self-destructs.</p><br><br>

<p class="navyBold">Everyone Can Recruit</p>
<p>Recruiting does not mean having the ability to invite people.  Everyone in the guild can spread the word about the guild to other players... groupmates, friends, whoever.  Look for people that you enjoy spending time with, talking to, and hunting with.  We want people that we can trust, and people with a good fun loving sense of humor.<br><br>
All you have to do is talk to them about the guild, tell them what it's like to be in the guild.  Mention the website and forums, give them the website address.  Offer to answer their questions, or give them the name of an officer that they can ask questions of.<br><br>
When you have someone ready to join the guild, just get in touch with an officer and set up a time to have the invite done.</p><br><br>

<tr>
	<td>Dark Age of Camelot will be implementing a system in which Guild Dues are automatically deducted from Members pockets and placed in the Guild Vault.  This is not currently possible, and so there are no Guild Dues at this time.  In the future, there will be guild dues, but they will not be painful.  Dues will be used to finance guild events.

<tr class="header">
	<td class="header">Guild Vault</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>There will be a Guild Vault implemented in the future.  For now, the Guild Vault is a Mule character jointly controlled by Faran and Altaria.  Everyone can put items into the Vault, and full ranked Members may take items out of the Vault.  Items from the Vault are for USE only - they are not to be sold.  You may use them until you no longer need them, and then you must return them to the Vault.  If an item has been in the Vault for a long time with no one asking for it, the item may be sold by the guild and the proceeds placed in the guild treasury.
