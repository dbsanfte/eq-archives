<p>No, this is the section for the people who think in terms of "one for all and all for one!"</p>
<p>And that's the biggest reward right there...</p>

<p>An entire guild to help you in life.  There will be regularly scheduled events where the Guild helps classes to gain their class-specific armor.  We will work together to benefit all of us.</p>

<p>We are a family.  If we act as a group of individuals each using the others for our own benefit we will all lose.  If we work together to help all of us, we all win.</p>

<p>Do you really need more than that?</p>
