		<br><p>I began life as one of those happy, flighty Wood Elves that seem so popular in the excuses for literature the Humans have. The happy, dancing, singing trees and chirping flowers type of elf.<br>
<br>
My parents raised me in Kelethin. Life was simple and my parents were good people. Not extraordinary, not bad. I typically ran wild through the forests until I got hungry, then I would return to our hut in the trees and tell them of my discoveries.<br>
<br>
I spent a good deal of time tagging along with my older cousin, Krystaria as she followed her father's footsteps in the warrior's way. She taught me how to kill Orcs and why we should do such a thing. She also hunted for the pelts of wolves for her High Elf Brother whom I had but rarely seen. I never felt right hunting wolves... they always seemed too friendly to me, and never attacked me. So I left them alone.<br>
<br>
One day Krystaria's brother came home to the Faydark. Krystaria and I met him at the Felwithe gates. He had been living amongst humans in Freeport for months, and his eyes were tired. Not tired physically, but tired in soul. Crystasius explained that he was weary of his existence and wished simply to pass on what he had gained in this life. For some reason, he chose to pass on his equipment to me instead of Krystaria.<br>
<br>
I suddenly found myself possesing better equipment than my friends, and I discovered that it was much easier to make my way through life with both the equipment and knowledge Crystasius had given me in his journal.<br>
<br>
It was around that time that my parents choose to leave on a pilgrimage to the new continent of Kunark. Father spoke of having seen Firona Vai during the Battle of Bloody Kithicor, and he and mother both went to do what they could to help find the lost princess.<br>
<br>
My parents and Crystasius both spoke of far away places, and I was now determined to see those places and more. Having grown up amongst nature, and raised in the worship of Tunare, I followed the path of the Druid.<br>
<br>
One day while hunting on the Orc Hill near Kelethin, I encountered a Cleric of Tunare. I could tell that she had enough power to destroy me with ease, and yet she sat amongst all of the young elves at the Orc Hill, healing us and casting defensive magics upon us. Several times that night I perished and was given another chance by the grace of Tunare. Each time, the Cleric was abashed and apologized profusely for letting me die. Despite those deaths and her sorrow for them, I gained much experience that night, and my childhood was made much easier for her help. I was touched by her caring and open heart, and by her concern for myself and the other young ones on the Orc Hill. I swore never to forget her, and I etched her name into my soul that I may find her again at a later date. To this day she and I have been in frequent contact, though I have only seen her thrice since that day on the orc hill. Her kindness opened me to new understanding of Tunare's ways, and prepared me for the next great step in my life.<br>
I someday hope to reach her level of knowledge and adventure with her as an equal. I will never forget you, Illyanae.<br>
<br>
I then met up with two other young druids who also became my steadfast friends. We adventured together for many nights, from Crushbone to the Sisters camp in Lesser Faydark. We grew up together, we laughed together, we got drunk together, and we died together a few times. One night when we got drunk I wound up in a short lived relationship with a Druid named Gamena... it ended painfully, but she and I have since become friends. That same night, my two new friends also found a passion for one another that still runs strong to this day. Seeing the two of them still fills me with hope and the joy of life. Deckar and Midnightever - I eagerly await the time when we can all sit around in treeform drinking again. No chainsaws for the reunion, OK Deck?<br>
<br>
Shortly after my fateful night on the Orc Hill, I heard a shout from across the Greater Faydark. Some Cleric of Tunare named Frolic was giving a sermon on the love of Tunare outside the Church of Felwithe. Curious to see what a Koada'Dal Cleric might believe of the Great Mother, I chose to attend. She spoke on Tunare's love and how it extends even to our twisted brethren the Teir'Dal. When her sermon was done, Frolic extended to me an offer to join her guild and become a Child of Tunare. I accepted.<br>
<br>
A week afterward, I met Frolic again, in the city of Freeport where she taught me the language of the fairies. Thanks to the ministrations of Starlett, our entire party was quite drunk. Though I may try to romanticize it, there is no denying what really happened that night. In the middle of the street, next to the militia house of Freeport, Frolic and I... well... *blush* engaged in Carnal Knowledge of one another.<br>
<br>
A few scant weeks after that, Child of Tunare was rent by discord as the Chief Officer, Levinwith, and many officers and members left the guild. New to the Guild and unsure of what happened, I stayed to help Frolic rebuild. She granted me the position of Officer and placed me in charge of her SpiritWeb guild hall.<br>
<br>
In time, Frolic and I grew closer and I was promoted to the position of Chief Officer. Child of Tunare grew in size, and many new members became my close friends. The love between Frolic and myself grew, and finally I asked her hand in marriage. She accepted, and we all got drunk again.<br>
<br>
All seemed well, the future bright. Then disaster struck all. Frolic made an announcement to the guild that I and many of the officers under me disagreed with. War began within the ranks of officers and many chose to leave the guild. I was hurt and betrayed by how Frolic was treating me during this time, and I finally made the hardest decision of my life. I chose to leave Child of Tunare.<br>
<br>
It was Frolic's turn to feel betrayed and hurt. She offered to hand over guild leadership to me, but I refused. I had not the heart to fix what was wrong with the Guild, and the Dream I had followed through Frolic was dead. So I chose to leave... and so did Frolic. With a last cry to the guild, she severed the bond of the guild and destroyed Child of Tunare. Summoned all her energy, Frolic then obliterated herself and shall never again return to Norrath.<br>
<br>
I drifted. Lost and alone, again. The guild I had cared for and worked for was gone. Some few members of Child of Tunare remembered me and concerned themselves to ask what happened. A few of those offered their continued support and alligience to me. The scattered Officers of Child of Tunare banded together to create a new home for ourselves.<br>
<br>
After many days and many prayers to the Immortals of Norrath, we were prepared to start the new Guild.<br>
<br>
And so, 2 nights ago was born the Bane Sidhe. We rise from the ashes of death, all changed by our run through the fire and our ressurection. The Dream that inspired Child of Tunare is dead, and I will not follow it any longer.<br>
<br>
I have a past, filled both with shining moments and blinding flashes of pain. I have lost all I cared for and in some ways I dread the future.<br>
<br>
The ShadowSight that was is dead... I am merely the burnt out spirit of him. My former existence is gone, and I will scream my pain for long years to come.<br>
<br>
Unlike the Clerics of Tunare who see life as light and beauty, I am no stranger to the dark and evil side of life. In Nature there must be balance... both sorrow and joy, pain and happiness, life and death, good and evil. All exist within us all. When I have attempted to deny parts of that it caused pain and suffering to all around me. It shall not happen that way again. <br>

<br>
Being a Tale of the Retirement of ShadowSight:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A tired looking Fier’Dal sits on a bench by the fire, slowly sipping a glass of spiced Elven wine. Long curls of a fragrant tobbacco smoke writhe around him, frequently replenished from his pipe. He stares into the fire, his feet stretched out before him, a soft, wistful smile upon his face.<br>
<br>
Almost engulfed by a large, plush chair next to the bench, a dwarf with flame red hair sits, watching the elf. Like most good Dwarves, this one clutches a tankard of foaming ale in one hand, and a pipe is clenched in his teeth.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf lets out a long sigh, and settles back on the bench, his feet thrust out to the warmth of the fire. Outside, lightning flashes and with a peal of thunder the rain begins beating on the roof.<br>
<br>
“It’s been a long, good run, my friend,” ShadowSight says. The Dwarf grunts in reply, eyes glittering darkly. “You don’t approve, do you?” ShadowSight asks.<br>
<br>
“Of course I don’t, ye fool! I dinnae ken ye Elves most o’ the time, and yer one o’ the weirdest I’ve met so far. Why ye want to give it up now I don’t understand, and yer bloody right I don’t approve of it!” the Dwarf replies emphatically.<br>
<br>
“I’m tired, Stoutheart. I used to know my place in the world, I used to have a fire to achieve my dreams and goals. But my place in the world has changed, and my dreams and goals are no longer as important as once they were.<br>
<br>
“Times have changes since I began my Journey, and though I have tried my hardest, I have not been able to keep up with the times.<br>
<br>
“I’ve come as far as I care to go… and now it is time for me to pass on what I have achieved.<br>
<br>
“Like Crystasius, the wizard who helped me get started and who has rarely been seen since his retirement… it’s my time to retire now.”<br>
<br>
ShadowSight takes another drink of his wine, another drag from his pipe. He looks at his dwarven companion curiously, and smiles.<br>
<br>
“You’ve come far since I found you, runt.”<br>
<br>
“Aye – call me runt again and ye’ll find out just how far I ‘ave come.”<br>
<br>
“Fyndhorn has done as I have asked? Guided you and helped you in your quests? Taken care of you and made sure no harm befalls you?”<br>
<br>
“Aye, lad. He’s been a wonderful babysitter, though sometimes I think he tires of his role nearly as much as you do.”<br>
<br>
“His time will come soon, never fear. You are almost ready, aren’t you? Soon you will surpass my abilities as a healer, and then what I have will be yours.”<br>
<br>
“Soon, Lad. Too soon, if’n ye ask me – but ye never have asked me anything, not since day one. Why you devoted yer time to one such as myself, I don’t know. All I know is that it has never been my place to question you or what you choose to do. Be that to yourself or to me.”<br>
<br>
“And have I been so harsh on you, my friend? Has your life been as cruel as all that?”<br>
<br>
“We dwarves are the children of Brell, ShadowSight. Made from the earth of Norrath itself, and our smiths are some of the greatest in the world. We live life surrounded by hard rock and harder metal – and forging is a harsh and grueling task. I grew up thinking that made us hard, and tough.<br>
<br>
“Until I met you.<br>
<br>
“For being a wee pansy wood elf, ye taught me a thing or two about being tough. For what could be tougher than learning the love of Tunare from a druid… and realizing that yer silly little loves have softened a heart I long thought cold and hard as rock.<br>
<br>
“I’ve known from the day you found me what I was being groomed for. At first it was a wonderful chance at a better life, and ye know how I leapt at it. Ye were a tough task master, always keeping at me with one of your friends or cronies, yer lectures, yer teachings. Who could have imagined that I’d come to love ye?<br>
<br>
“Aye – my existance has been a rough and cruel thing, lad. Knowing what’s ahead and knowing that the only thing I can do to repay ye is to do as ye wish. I dinnae want ye to go.”<br>
<br>
ShadowSight’s smile deepens, even as tears glitter in his eyes.<br>
<br>
“I’ll never truly be gone, my friend. You know that better than any. Even when you were out with Fyndhorn, you knew I was right there with you in spirit if not in flesh.”<br>
<br>
“Aye… but ‘tis not the same as it will be when you finally do go!”<br>
<br>
“I know. But it must be done. I’m much more happy to see you and your work in Norrath than I am running around in Norrath myself anylonger.<br>
<br>
“When you’re ready for it, I will pass on all the equipment I have that you may find useful. Some of it you have borrowed for your training, but soon it will be truly yours… and then… then…”<br>
<br>
“Ye cannae even say it, can ye?”<br>
<br>
ShadowSight turns his head and blinks tears from his eyes. His jaw clenches and his hand trembles. Eyes closed, he draws himself together, visibly seeming to focus on one thing.<br>
<br>
“It’s not easy to do this, runt. You’ll understand soon enough. Yes, I can say it, though doing so pains me. When you are ready and I have passed on my equipment to you, I will also pass onto you the leadership of Bane Sidhe.<br>
<br>
“Don’t get cocky in that role, runt – I’m not leaving their ranks, merely stepping down. As you will be out and about more than I, it is more appropriate that you lead them in my stead.”<br>
<br>
“Ye think this is something I want, you tall pale freak?” Tears are flowing into the dwarf’s beard, but he seems not to notice. “These people don’t even know me, and yer thrusting me in front of them as leader. How do ye expect them to react? How do ye think *I’m* going to be accepted?”<br>
<br>
ShadowSight laughs, tears fading to joy and banishing the gloomy mood that has permeated the room.<br>
<br>
“Stoutheart… runt… I’ve known these people for a long, long time. I can assure you that they are good people and that they’ll accept you. Knowing that I’m with you in spirit at all times and that I’m still around if things shoud require my attention, I think that the two of you will adapt just fine.<br>
<br>
“Now, finish your Ale, finish your pipe, and go say hello to the guild. You’ll all get to know each other better soon enough!”<br>
<br>
The two fall silent, drinking their drinks and smoking their pipes. Slowly, chatter begins to fill in the room as the members of Bane Sidhe return in the late day rain to get drunk and talk about their day.<br>
<br>
All of the members eventually fall silent, noticing the new dwarf in the tavern sitting with ShadowSight. A somewhat uneasy feeling is in the air… a feeling of a passing, of something ending that has been around for a long, long time.<br>
<br>
And yet, there is also a joyous feeling in the air. One of… rebirth. <br><br>
