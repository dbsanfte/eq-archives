<tr>
	<td><br><p>Just to clear one thing up immediately.  Number 2 is the most important item I can stress.  I want our guild to be known across Norrath as people who can be trusted.  If someone wants to do an item swap from one character to another, and they ask you to help, you are expected to perform the swap with no difficulties.  Even if they're swapping a full suit of Cobalt Armor and a full suit of Elder Spiritist Armor.</p>
<p>Please note that Item swaps are just an example - when you give someone your word, you KEEP it.  If a group mate goes LD, you hold their spot for awhile.  If a group mate needs to log for a short time and asks you to hold a spot for them, and you give you word to - KEEP it.  You'll be surprised at how many people will really appreciate this common courtesy.</p>
<p>It also makes for great roleplaying - "I give you my word of Honor..." has started god knows how many adventures!</p>
