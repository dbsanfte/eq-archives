		<br><p> Searing pain rose with the effort of moving a single muscle...every part of his body seemed to be afire...the frail human lay quietly gathering his wits about him...<br>
<br>
Opening his eyes, he saw nothing but the tops of trees, waving gently above him...the muted light revealed that it was nearly noon...he attempted to clear his mind...what had happened to him...he remembered...remembered....a castle, an island floating in the sky, clouds below, a thin, delicate bridge...an arrow flitting through the quiet air...and nothing...nothing more...<br>
<br>
Even that much effort was too taxing...he faded into darkness...<br>
<br>
Near sunset, Oomba and Roamer decided to look for a likely camp. A grove of beech, just turning a light yellow tint, attracted his attention. A stream drifted nearby. An ideal spot to spend the night, these Stonebrunt Mountains were full of delightful corners...<br>
<br>
Roamer began to whine, clearly uneasy...this was enough to set the troll's hackles on edge...sniffing the air carefully, he caught it as well...the scent of kobolds...<br>
<br>
As they drew nearer the grove they began to notice tracks as well...the tracks of several, gradually converging...clearly demonstrating the pack hunting methods of the grubby puppies...the tracks directed Oomba to the center of the grove.<br>
<br>
And there they found the body of the human...a victim of the kobolds?...but wait, though grievously wounded, this creature bore no marks of kobold teeth, or even weapon...this poor soul was massively bruised, but no kobold existed who could wield a weapon large enough to inflict this damage...Oomba circled the grove, examining the ground carefully...odder still, though the kobold tracks gave clear indication of their actions, no mark of human foot could be found anywhere...how did this creature come to this point, did he fly...almost involuntarily, the thought drew Oomba's eyes upward...and there it became evident...huge branches torn from the trunk...in truth the creature had flown, or at least fallen to his death in this silent spot...<br>
<br>
This explained why the kobolds had not marked him, no carrion eaters there...they had however, stripped the corpse of anything of value, leaving only a single item, a blighted bracer, useless to a kobold, for there were no necromancers among them...<br>
<br>
Necromancer!! Of course...that meant this human was a necromancer...and that meant...it was just possible...that the human was not truely dead!! Oomba had heard it said that even the necros that one met walking down the path could appear to be dead, even as they moved...perhaps this creature is merely feigning death...<br>
<br>
Full darkness had fallen, and despite the lingering scent of kobolds, this spot appeared as good a place to camp as any...the pair decided to settle down and wait to see what developed...<br>
<br>
True enough, near the break of dawn, wolf and troll were startled from their shallow slumber by a groan from this corpse of a human...he was not fully dead, though he appeared not far from it...Oomba settled down near the fire and began emptying his pack of pottables...work enough here for a dozen shammies and a cleric or two, I would think, muttered the troll...<br>
<br>
It took, in fact, three full days...medding, brewing, casting...before the human was restored in health and strength...and by that time, one remaining oddity became clear...<br>
<br>
This human necromancer remembered nothing of his life before his strange fall...as Oomba, himself, had never been there, they were not even able to reconstruct the shadow memories of those last few moments as a glimpse of the Plane of Air...though he had a full book of spells, demonstrating a highly developed skill, and though he had the power to cast all of the spells, this human was clearly devoid of any recollection of how or when to use them...even worse, he could not even remember his name...<br>
<br>
Oomba solved this problem for the time being...since I found you dead, your name shall be Death...I will call you Thaanatos, a word for death in one of the languages the ancestors recall from ages past...and since you currently have nothing but your honor, your second name shall grant you the highest of honors...though you are too young to be king...therefore you shall be a prince...Basileus, in the same language...Thaanatos Basileus...the Prince of Death...<br>
<br>
Thus the human, paupered in all but spirit, set forth to regain all that he had lost...wealth, equipment, skill....and, perhaps, memory...<br><br>
