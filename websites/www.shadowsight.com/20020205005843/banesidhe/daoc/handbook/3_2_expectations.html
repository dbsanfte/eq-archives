<p class="navyBold"><a name="website">Website Requirement</a></p>
<p>You will be expected to know the material on the website.  Not knowing this material may eventually get you kicked out of the guild.  It's also a really really good way to get on the Eldest's bad side.</p>
<p>You will also be expected to participate in our forums.  When we plan raids or events that are sensitive to the number of people that can attend, you MUST sign up for it on the forums or you <b>WILL NOT BE GOING</b>.</p>
<p>Please keep the Out of Character posts to the OOC boards, and please RP as much as possible on the boards.</p>
<p>This is also the major form of debate and communication within the guild.  When we're in game, let's play and have fun.  Out of game, let's use the boards to clear things up ASAP.  (this may include accusations and defenses of various crimes against the guild).</p>
<p>Also note that just reading the boards is great - but we have no way of knowing if you are or aren't.  If you want the Guild to recognize you, if you want to be noticed... you had best start posting on the forums.</p><br><br>

<p class="navyBold">Participation Requirement</p>
<p>Members are expected to participate in this guild.  That means talking in guild chat, participating at in game events, posting to the forums, and generally being an active, visible member of the guild.  We are a family, and we are friends.  As such, it is expected that members will help each other out.  This doesn't mean that you spend 100% of your time helping out members, or that you spend 100% of your time getting help.  Simply bear in mind that together we can become so much more than we are individually, and that we all need help from time to time.  The person you help today will be there helping you tomorrow. </p><br><br>

<p class="navyBold">Loyalty and Obedience</p>
<p>We expect members to be loyal to the guild, your guildmates, and the Officers.  There is a set system of Ranks in this guild - those with the ability to lead will advance to leadership positions.  If someone higher than you in rank gives you a direct order, be so good as to follow it.</p>
<p>It is the Officer's duty to see to it that orders are not counter-productive.  For example, ordering a level 15 character to storm Midgard is unrealistic, and no one would expect that character to obey such a ridiculous order.</p>
<p>However, in times of War (RvR), individuals and squads may be asked to participate in highly dangerous or even suicidal missions.  This is where you will have a chance to prove your loyalty and nobility, by possibly laying down your life for the guild and the Realm.</p><br><br>


<p class="navyBold">Roleplaying Expectations</p>
<p>As we do play on a Roleplaying Server, we obviously feel that it is an important part of the game that we should all try to follow as much as possible.  Of course, there are some aspects of the game that can't be roleplayed out, and time when there's no time to come up with a roleplay explanation for something.<br><br>

Guild Chat should be a health mix of Roleplaying and Out of Character communication.  Excessive RP can bog things down to the point of ludicracy, excessive OOC destroys the feel and fun of the game.  Things in Guild Chat tend to switch back and forth very fast, and Bansee somehow always winds up with a peculiar blend of RP and OOC... roll with it and have fun.<br><br>

All we ask is that you try.  Do your best, and stick with it as best you can.  If you ever need help with it (What do I do in this situation? Who am I?  How can I say this in a RP way?), never be afraid to ask for help or advice.  If we all roleplay together, it gets easier for all of us - especially since we know it will be accepted within the Realm.</p>


<p class="navyBold">Respect your Guildmates</p>
<p>No one is saying that you have to like every single person in the guild... in any large organization an expectation like that is unrealistic. However, you do have to respect your guildmates.  You may not like them, but don't run around talking trash about them - to your friends, your groupmates, or to the rest of the guild.  People play the game differently, as well - please respect their playing style and don't criticise them for how they choose to play.</p>
