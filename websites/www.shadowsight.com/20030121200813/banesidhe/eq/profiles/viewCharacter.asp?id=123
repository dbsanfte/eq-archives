		<br><p>Arro was born in Kelethin of Arroflyte Trueshot, Ranger of the 15th season and Quendi Trueshot, Ranger of the 13th season. He has an older sister, Acorncupcake, and a younger sister, Wisperingwind. Long before reaching his first season of manhood, Arro's life was forever changed when his propensity for wandering where he did not belong landed him in Crushbone and both parents were killed saving his life. He was raised by his Uncle Maesyn Trueshot, and spent his entire life living for nothing but duty and honor in an attempt to atone for the deaths of his parents.<br>
<br>
The second chapter of his life began when he met and fell in love with Alurea Moira, who taught him to smile.<br><br>
