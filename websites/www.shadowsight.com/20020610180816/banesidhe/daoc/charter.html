<p>Bane Sidhe is an honorable guild, and it's members are expected to be trustworthy and faithful.  Creating a reputation like that amongst our fellow Hibernians is the responsibility of every member.  It is a way of life, not something that can be turned on and off to suit the whims of an individual.  Those with honor deserve to be treated as equals... those without aren't worthy of being noticed.</p>

<br>

<p>We are a friendly and helpful guild - it is expected that a Banshee will render aid to those in need.  If someone needs help, do your best to help them.  This does not mean let yourself get taken advantage of.  Beggars would find life much more pleasant and enjoyable if they actually worked, rather than sitting around bemoaning their fate.  However, for a person over run with monsters that needs an extra hand, or perhaps even a ressurection - do what you can to assist them.  Consider the cost to yourself, be it a few moments of time and consider the reward... a true smile and having brightened someone's day.<br>
This goes double for helping guildmates.  Even if it takes you out of your way, remember that we depend on each other and count on each other.  If we always are there for each other, the world becomes a much safer place for all of us.</p>

<br>

<p>We are Family here.  This means that we may not always like one another and we may not get along all the time... but we must always respect one another.  Treat your guildmates respectfully, and solve your differences in tells.  Do not have a throw down in front of the entire guild, please... the  Officers aren't supposed to be baby sitters.</p>
