<p>What does Membership in Bane Sidhe mean?  What do you want to do?  Where will you go? How will you live? </p>
<p>Membership in Bane Sidhe focuses on one primary thing - the Guild. It is <i>	Gestalt</i> theory - the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  Putting together a bunch of random people may create a more powerful force than just each of those people alone.  Putting together a bunch of people where everyone works together for the benefit of everyone will be more powerful than several groups of the other bunches.</p><br><br>

<p>You need to be willing to put others before yourself, realizing that in helping them you are helping yourself.  You need to be concerned with being a part of something greater than just yourself, and you need to be constantly aware that every action, every word, every breath of yours will also reflect on the Guild.</p>

<p>Individually we may become powerful.  Together we will become unstoppable.</p><br><td>
