<p class="navyBold">Profile Requirement</p>
<p>We require all members to have a profile online.  For now, that means posting to the Introductions Forum with your character's information and life story.  In the future, there will be a way to submit a profile via the website.  The Guild will be notified when this system is complete.</p>
<p>If you are in the guild and do not have a profile online, I highly suggest that you get one in as soon as possible.  Because if you're not listed on the website you're not in the guild.  Get the point?</p><br><br>
	
	
<p class="navyBold"><a name="website">Website Requirement</a></p>
<p>You will be expected to know the material on the website.  Not knowing this material may eventually get you kicked out of the guild.  It's also a really really good way to get on the Eldest's bad side.</p>
<p>You will also be expected to participate in our forums.  When we plan raids or events, you MUST sign up for it on the forums or you <b>WILL NOT BE GOING</b>.</p>
<p>Please keep the Out of Character posts to the OOC boards, and please RP as much as possible on the boards.</p>
<p>This is also the major form of debate and communication within the guild.  When we're in game, let's play and have fun.  Out of game, let's use the boards to clear things up ASAP.  (this may include accusations and defenses of various crimes against the guild).</p>
<p>Also note that just reading the boards is great - but we have no way of knowing if you are or aren't.  If you want the Council to recognize you, if you want to be noticed... you had best start posting on the forums.</p><br><br>

<p class="navyBold">Participation Requirement</p>
<p>Members are expected to participate in this guild.  That means talking in guild chat, participating at in game events, posting to the forums, and generally being an active, visible member of the guild.  We are a family, and we are friends.  As such, it is expected that members will help each other out.  This doesn't mean that you spend 100% of your time helping out members, or that you spend 100% of your time getting help.  Simply bear in mind that together we can become so much more than we are individually, and that we all need help from time to time.  The person you help today will be there helping you tomorrow. </p><br><br>

<p class="navyBold">Loyalty and Obedience</p>
<p>We expect members to be loyal to the guild, their guildmates, the officers, and the Councillors.  There is a set system of Ranks in this guild - those with the ability to lead will advance to leadership positions.  If someone higher than you in rank gives you a direct order, be so good as to follow it.</p>
<p>It is the Officer's duty to see to it that orders are not counter-productive.  For example, ordering a lvl 35 Wizard to Kill Nagafen single-handedly is only going to get that wizard killed.  No one would expect the wizard to follow that order, either.</p>
<p>However, in a time of War, individuals and squads may be asked to participate in highly dangerous or even suicidal missions.  This is where you will have a chance to prove your loyalty and nobility, by possibly laying down your life for the guild.</p><br><br>


<p class="navyBold">Roleplaying Expectations</p>
<p>It would warm our hearts to see this entire guild roleplaying every minute they can.  Be it in Norrath or the Forums, it would be a pleasure to see.  Roleplaying is hard in Norrath, I know - too many people see it as almost a "crime" against the game.  Remember that EQ is supposed to be an MMORPG - a Massively Multi-player Online ROLE PLAYING Game.  It's not a crime - it's part of the bloody <i>point!</i>  Some people have never roleplayed before - some have.  Some are good, some are bad, and some think that they alone have the right to judge the quality of everyone's roleplaying.</p>
<p>All we ask is that you try.  Do your best, and stick with it as best you can.  If you ever need help with it (What do I do in this situation? Who am I?), never be afraid to ask for help or advice.  If we all roleplay together, it gets easier for all of us - especially since we know it will be accepted within the guild.</p>
