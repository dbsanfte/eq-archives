<p>Twas the night before Christmas<br>
in the City of Trees.<br>
And I thought to myself,<br>
"I need a hit of that Breeze."</p>

<p>It was rainy in Kelethin<br>
the platforms were slick.<br>
So I pulled on my cloak<br>
and went to find that Caster chick.</p>

<p>I strutted up to a High Elf<br>
and casually said "Whassup?"<br>
She turned and she whispered,<br>
"Can I hook you up?"</p>

<p>I slipped here five gold<br>
(not all things are free)<br>
She casted her spell.<br>
"Ah, sweet Clarity!"</p>

<p>With senses renewed,<br>
I needed drinkin' time<br>
so I went to the bar<br>
and I ordered Elf Wine</p>

<p>After 10 drinks or so<br>
the bartender said "Out!"<br>
Then I left, mighty angry,<br>
with a screm and a shout.</p>

<p>"My life is worthless!"<br>
"This town really blows!"<br>
So I went to the Fletcher,<br>
and I bought me a bow.</p>

<p>I readied an arrow,<br>
and I aimed at my head.<br>
I shot-Missed completely!<br>
though, the Fletcher was dead.</p>

<p>Then a guard entered.<br>
He put a sword to my chest.<br>
He shouted, "What happened here?"<br>
So I had to confess.</p>

<p>"It was a Dark Elf!,<br>
umm Drizzt is his son!<br>
Zaknaifien-he did it!"<br>
and then off I did run.</p>

<p>I ran to the lift.<br>
Trees were all I could see.<br>
I jumped to my death.<br>
Wrong-I landed on a newbie.</p>

<p>He was crushed flat,<br>
but I was okay.<br>
So I decided to leave suicide,<br>
for yet another day.</p>

<p>I went back to my hut,<br>
and I turned off the light.<br>
Well, Merry Christmas to all,<br>
and to all a good night.</p>

Every Elf Down in Elf-ville<br>
Liked Velious a lot...But the Gnome,<br>
Who lived just North of Elf-ville,<br>
Did not...<br>
The Gnome hated the velious release date!<br>
Oh but there was so much more then the date to hate...<br>
No one quite knows why the Gnome hated it.<br>
Could it be the lack of warm places to sit?<br>
But I think that the most likely reason of all<br>
May have been that his heart was three sizes too small.<br>
But what ever reason<br>
The Gnome hated this season.<br>
The people in Velious getting the phat lewt.<br>
The icy air making the elf women so cute.<br>
"And they're getting new spells!" he snarled with a sneer.<br>
"Tomorrow is Velious! It's practically here!"<br>
Then he growled, with his Gnome fingers nervously drumming,<br>
"I MUST find a way to keep Velious from coming!"<br>
For, in Velious, he knew......All the Elf girls and boys<br>
Would wake up bright and early. Open the mailbox and get the loot!<br>
And then! Oh, then they would loot! Oh, the loot! Loot! Loot! Loot!<br>
That's one thing he hated! The LOOT! LOOT! LOOT! LOOT!<br>
The bards would sing! And they'd sing!<br>
AND they'd SING! SING! SING! SING!<br>
And the more the Grinch thought of the Bard-Velious-Sing<br>
The more the Gnome thought, "I must stop this whole thing!"<br>
"Why for fifty-three levels I've put up with it now!<br>
"I MUST stop Velious from coming!<br>
...But HOW?"<br>
Then he got an idea!<br>
An awful idea!<br>
THE GNOME<br>
GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!<br>
"I know just what to do!" The Gnome Laughed in his throat.<br>
And he made a quick FedEx hat and a coat.<br>
And he chuckled, and clucked, "What a great Gnomey hex!<br>
"With this coat and this hat, I'll look just like FedEx!"<br>
"All I need is a truck..."<br>
The Gnome looked around.<br>
But since FedEx trucks are scarce, there was none to be found.<br>
Did that stop the old Gnome...?<br>
No! The Gnome simply said,<br>
"If I can't find a truck, I'll make one instead!"<br>
So he got his tinker kit. Then he took some red thread<br>
And he made a big sign, that simply said,<br>
FedEx Express Delivery.<br>
THEN<br>
He loaded some bags<br>
And some old empty sacks<br>
On a ramshakle truck<br>
And he set off following the FedEx truck's tracks!<br>
All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.<br>
All the Elves were all dreaming sweet dreams without care<br>
When he came to the first house in the square.<br>
"This is stop number one," The old Gnome FedEx man hissed<br>
And he went to the front door, empty bags in his fist.<br>
Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,<br>
Around the whole yard, and he took the present!<br>
And he stuffed it in his bag. Then the Gnome, very quietly too,<br>
I might add, took the Velious box, and gave a great "WHEW".<br>
Then<br>
He did the same thing<br>
To the other Elves' abodes<br>
Leaving nothing<br>
Besides a young toad.<br>
It was quarter past dawn...<br>
All the Elves, still a-bed<br>
All the Elves, still a-snooze<br>
When he packed up his truck,<br>
Packed it up with their Velious! The box! The wrappings!<br>
The Cds! And the free toy offers! The maunal! The trappings!<br>
Three tousand feet up! Up the side of Mount Delown,<br>
He rode to the tiptop to dump it down!<br>
"Pooh-pooh to the Elves!" he was gnome-ish-ly humming.<br>
"They're finding out now that no Velious is coming!<br>
"They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!<br>
"Their mouths will hang open a minute or two<br>
"Then all the Elves down in Elf-ville will all cry BOO-HOO!"<br>
"That's a loot," grinned the Gnome,<br>
"That I simply must get!"<br>
So he paused. And the Gnome put his hand to his hearing kit.<br>
And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.<br>
It started in low. Then it started to grow...<br>
But the sound wasn't sad!<br>
Why, this sound sounded merry!<br>
It couldn't be so!<br>
But it WAS merry! VERY!<br>
He stared down at Elf-ville!<br>
The Gnome popped his eyes!<br>
Then he shook!<br>
What he saw was a shocking surprise!<br>
Every Elf down in Elf-ville, the tall and the small,<br>
Was looting! Without any Velious at all!<br>
He HADN'T stopped Velious from coming!<br>
IT CAME!<br>
Somehow or other, it came just the same!<br>
And the Gnome, with his gnome-feet ice-cold in the snow,<br>
Stood puzzling and puzzling: "How could it be so?<br>
"It came without boxes! It came without wrappings!<br>
"It came without packages, boxes or plastic trappings!"<br>
And he puzzled three hours, `till his puzzler was sore.<br>
Then the Gnome thought of something he hadn't before!<br>
"Maybe Velious," he thought, "wasn't made for loot to sell in an E-Store...<br>
"Maybe Velious...perhaps...means a little bit more!"<br>
And what happened then...?<br>
Well...in Elf-ville they say<br>
That the Gnome's small heart<br>
Grew three sizes that day!<br>
And the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight,<br>
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light<br>
And he brought back the game! And the free toy offers!<br>
And he...<br>
...HE HIMSELF...!<br>
The Gnome was the first to port and loot Earring of the Foffers!<br>
