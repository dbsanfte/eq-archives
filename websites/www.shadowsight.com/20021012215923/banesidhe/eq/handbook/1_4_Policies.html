<tr>
	<td><p>Recruiting is a very important part of a guild.  Without it we stagnate and wither, too much and we get so large the guild self-destructs.  With that in mind, the Guild Council has outline a specific Proceedure to follow for recruiting new members into the Guild.</p><br><br>

<p class="navyBold">Level Requirement</p>
<p>We require all members to be level 15 in order to recieve an invitation to join the Guild.</p><br><br>

<p class="navyBold">Profile Requirement</p>
<p>A Recruit must Post an Introduction on the Introductions Forum of the Forums before an invitiation will be extended.  This Introduciton should contain at least a rudimentary life story, as well as: Character Name, Level, Class, Race, and whether this character is your primary character or an Alternate.</p><br><br>

<p class="navyBold">Participation Requirement</p>
<p>Members are expected to spend some time reading and posting to the Guild Forums.  The Forums are our main form of inter-Guild Communication.  It is where we plan raids and events, discuss the direction and future of the guild (ie - where do YOU want to go with this guild?), and basically keep in touch in all things.  The Forums are also where we get to know each other and keep in touch with fellow Guild Members.  For various reasons (level differences, time zone differences, whatever) we cannot always meet each other online.  The Forums allow us to meet the guild mates we don't get to see in game.<br><br>
You are not expected to post like a madman - but please try to read the Forums every few days and post occasionally.  Our Forums can get pretty busy, and reading them ever few days will keep you up to date, as well as make the time you spend on the forums less time consuming.  Think of it as 5-10 minutes of reading every day, or 1.5 hours + if you only read them once a week.  Easier to spend the 5-10 min a day rather than sit down and spend over an hour in front of them!
  </p><br><br>


<p class="navyBold"><a name="website" class="navyBold">Website Requirement</a></p>
<p>You will be expected to know the material on the website.  Not knowing this material may eventually get you kicked out of the guild.  It's also a really really good way to get on the Eldest's bad side from the beginning.<br><br>
Material on the website can change without notice.  Typically changes will be announced, but it is still the member's responsibility to keep up with the changes.</p><br><br>

<p class="navyBold">How to get into Bane Sidhe</p>
<p>This has been greatly simplified from our old system.  A new recruit must post to the website for one (1) week.  One of those posts must be an Introduction.  The Recruit must also attend at least one (1) Guild Event.  By Event, I mean just that - EVENT.  This does not mean Raid.  Events are Guild get togethers - could be a party for the heck of it, could be a buff night, could be an open PvP night in the Lake Rathe Arena, or could be a raid.  We usually have at least 2 Events per month, so if you're posting for a week, you shouldn't have long to wait to be able to attend an Event.<br>
<br>
1 Week of Posting + 1 Event = 1 Guild Invite.<br>
<br>

<p class="navyBold">Getting Alts into the Guild</p>
<p>Bane Side welcomes the alts of our members, and we love having them in the guild.  The only requirement for getting an Alt in the guild is that they have to be level 15, same as any invite. Simply talk to a Councillor in game to get the invite done.<br><br>

This rule has occasionally been suspended for special circumstances, so if you have a good reason why your alt should be let into the guild under the level limit, feel free to bring it up to a Councillor.  Also note that Guild Banks are not bound by this level limit since they serve the guild, not the player.  So you may occasionally see a few folks under level 15 in the guild, but it should be pretty rare.</p><br><br>

<p class="navyBold">Quest Requirement</p>
<p>When a recruit is accepted into the guild, it is up to the recruit to schedule a time and place to meet a Council Member for the invite.  It is the recruit's responsibility to make it to a place convienient for the Council Member.  It is not the burden of the Council member to meet the recruit.</p>
<p>The why of this is simple.  If a recruit doesn't care enough to go out of their way to get into the guild, they don't care enough to be in the Guild.  Keep in mind that the Council Members are not going to be unreasonable.  A level 15 Recruit won't be asked to get to a zone that is way to high for them.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
	<td><br><p>Members will be expected to pay dues to the Guild to help finance the guild's operations.  Dues are to be paid to any Council Member, or to one of the Guild Authorized Bank Character.</p>
	<p>The bank will hold not only the guild's money, but also the treasury of equipment.  Should you outgrow a piece of equipment that you would like passed on to the Guild, the bank is who you give it to.</p>
	<p>The Guild funds are currently an open topic.  Ways of using them include the financing of Guild Hosted Events such as Tournaments, Olympics, etc.  It may be used to fund guild raids (such as the expensive plane raids).  It may also be used for rewards to guild members, used by the Services Division for filling item requests.  For members in good standing, loans may or may not be available (to start with loan requests will be handled on a case by case basis).</p><br><br>

	<p>Below are the rules regarding Dues and the Chart showing how much you owe each month, based off your level.</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>Dues are Paid every real life month, on the first of the month.</li>
	<li>Members can make payments for multiple months in advance.</li>
	<li>Dues are to be paid to a council member or authorized bank character.</li>
	<li>Dues are calculated on your MAIN character in our guild only.  Alternate characters do not pay dues.  Members may specify their Main, but this must be backed up in game.  Saying your lvl 15 character is your main when all you ever play is your lvl 50 character is not going to be accepted for long.</li>
	<li>Members must pay dues by the 15th of the month or will be considered overdue. Overdue Members are prevented from attending Guild Events such as Raids, gift exchanges, etc.</li>
	<li>Missing 2 months in a row is grounds for removal from the guild.</li>
	<li>Members can make arrangements regarding dues and the payment of either on the forums, via email to a council member, or in game. Ex: if they will not be playing for 2 months, they let us know. They become TempInactive for 2 months and are not charged dues during that time. Or, if a member is on vacation for 2 weeks and will not be on on the first of the month, they can make arrangements to pay in advance or when they return.  Dues are not meant to be a very big hassle.  If you think you might have a problem making payment, <b>TALK TO US!</b>  We can work something out.</li>
</ul>
