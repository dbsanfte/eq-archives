So I created a Cleric named Stoutheart, and he is now my main character.  As such, I have passed Leadership of the guild from ShadowSight to Stoutheart, since you'll see a lot more of Stout than you will of Shadow.<br>

ShadowSight is still around and always will be, and is of course available to help out when needed, and he is of course still in the guild.  :)

<br>
<blockquote>
	The guild is a living entity and must be able to change to fit where it has grown to, and with that in mind, the Council has made some changes to the Guild Organization.  As announced in the Guild Meeting last night, here are the changes:<br>
<br>
<b>Council Changes</b><br>
The Council has been reduced from 11 members down to 7.  The four Councillors leaving the Council are now Officers, and are still valued for their help and participation in the guild.  The four who have left the Council are: Rythin, Mytheon, Flaash, and Tyberion.<br>
(note that when the time comes for the Council to increase, candidates will be drawn from the Officer Pool.)<br>
<br>
<b>Division Changes</b><br>
The Divisions have been condensed into 2 Divisions:  <br>
<u>Administration</u>, a combination of the old Administration and Services Divisions.<br>
<u>Strategic</u>, a combination of the Military and Political Divisions.<br>
<br>
Members no longer are required to hold membership in a specific division.  Rather, we like to see you participate in all division's as you can.<br>
<br>
<b>Promotions</b><br>
The following members have been promoted to Members in Good Standing:<br>
<ul type="disc"><br>
   <li>Mikil<br>
   <li>Midious<br>
   <li>Longbow (LUG)<br>
   <li>Hradlorin<br>
   <li>Faeeldor<br>
   <li>Brynd<br>
   <li>ShadowSeeker<br>
   <li>Keleios<br>

<br>
If a $ icon appears next to you name, it means you still owe dues for March.  Leave your mouse over this icon for a moment to see how much you owe.  As dues are paid up, I will keep the roster updated.<br>
<br>
Sunidai has done an amazing job of keeping track of this guild, folks.  Buy her a drink the next time you see her, because she's earned it!
