		<br><p> Another tear ran down the silken cheek of the high elf?almost an unbelievable contrast with the plate armor and razor sharp weapons she wore?yet, made believable by the unparallel grief evident upon her face.<br>
<br>
Firiona Vie turned away from the image clear in the Far Sight Crystal, an image of a troll and a wolf stalking prey in thick forest?an image of HER troll?her singularly loveable diversion from all that seemed determined to drive her into unbearable?.what?....no other way to describe it?.responsibility?.RESPONSIBILITY!!!! Would she never be free of that burden?! Would that accursed scroll never be found?<br>
<br>
Damn that Aki?Bar?.his infernal puzzling, his incessant successes in finding new possibilities?.none of his meddling had succeeded in the past?.Kunark, Velious, Luclin?.each had been promised as the end of her search?.yet each had come up short.<br>
<br>
And now, his latest discovery! Using the technology uncovered on Luclin he had managed to open new pathways?.planes unexplored, not even numbered as of yet?would there ever be an end?<br>
<br>
No, she knew now, in her heart that neither could she abandon her search, nor could she succeed in her lifetime, long though it might be. Be it fatalism, prescience?whatever, she knew in her heart of hearts that she would never return from this new search?the journey was simply too far, the changes necessary to complete for her ever to return to her love, this simple troll who knew how to touch her Elvin heart.<br>
<br>
And thus her grief?<br>
<br>
And her quandary! Firiona knew that her Oomba would never accept a final separation. He would follow her! He must not!! His power was not yet enough to join her in the Planes of Power. It would mean his end, and that she could not bear, not that on top of all else!<br>
<br>
She had found the solution; or rather Aki?Bar had found it?in the magick of the Planes of Power. Blast his infernal archanery! Who would have imagined such an act, who would perform such an act?.who would submit to such an act?.only one who felt she had no choice?<br>
<br>
For nearly a year, Firiona had eased her soul with stolen moments with her troll?moments made possible by assuming the form of a troll?ah, Feariona. Who else but Aki?Bar would have imagined that it would be possible to split Firiona and her troll image into two separate creatures! Who else would have found the means to accomplish the mad task?<br>
<br>
But it had to be done. Unless her troll was unaware of her leaving, he would never cease his search for her?.a search that could only end in his death. It needed to be done, done seamlessly, undetectably, permanently?her troll must never know what she had done?in his eyes would always be the form of his beloved Feariona?only she would know that the troll that he shared his life with was something else, something which would always trouble Firiona?s memory with visions of un-experienced recollections?troubler?Firiona would know her as Trobla, even though Oomba would always call her Feariona, remain unchanged his beloved Troll Momma?.and she would never again share her cherished moments with her troll?those would now be the property of her Trobla?<br>
<br>
She turned again to the Far Sight Crystal?.Oomba turned and looked back over his shoulder??Hurry up, Fear! Roamer says there are goblins over this hill!??the form of a female troll moved into the sphere of vision on the crystal surface, a smile of fierce bliss upon her face?<br>
<br>
Another tear ran down the silken cheek of the high elf?she waved her hand over the crystal and the vision faded from view?.forever?.<br><br>
