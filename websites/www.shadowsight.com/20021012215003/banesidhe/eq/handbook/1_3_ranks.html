</tr>
<tr>
    <td><p>Currently, the guild has 4 Ranks.  They are in order of Lowest to Highest:</p>

<blockquote>
	X.  Inactive<br>
	0.  Initiate<br>
	1.  Member<br>
	2.  Advisor<br>
	3.  Councillor<br>
	3b. Elder<br>
	3a. Eldest<br>
</blockquote>
</p>

<br><br>

<p><b><u>Level X: Inactive</u></b></p>
<p>The rank for people who are on extended leaves of abscense, military, vacation, hospital, whatever. Also, if a guildee stops playing for an extended period of time with no warning we can place them on Inactive until they come back (if they ever do). Inactive members do not pay dues during their abscense, but will resume dues and their previous rank when they return.</p>

<br><br>


<p><b><u>Level 0: Initiate</u></b></p>
<p>An Initiate is a new member to the guild. Lasts for 30 days, and during that 30 days they are on close watch. They might screw up and be talked to (with improvement following or they will be removed), or big screw ups might get them removed right away. Initiates cannot have any Alts put into the guild, they must earn full membership before they can put alts in. Likewise, Initiates do not pay dues for their first month with the guild. For the duration of their Probation, Initiates will have the Board Title under their name of "Initiate". Access to the various banks of Bane Sidhe may be restricted during the initiate period.  <b>Initiates are expected to KNOW THE INFORMATION ON THE HANDBOOK, AND THE INFORMATION IN THE GUILD RECORDS FORUM!!!</b></p>

<br><br>


<p><b><u>Level 1: Guild Member</u></b></p>
<p>Full guild membership in Bane Sidhe.  These members have proven themselves to be Banshee material and are granted full rank and privledges within the guild.  Members are welcome to place as many Alts in the guild as they would like so long as the Alts meet the lvl 15 requirement.  Members keep up on the Message Boards, follow the charter, and act in a manner to bring respect and honor to Bane Sidhe at all times.  Infractions against the guild or actions that disgrace the guild may result in being guild removed without a talking to... Members are expected to be above that.  It is expected that Members will respect those with seniority over them and those that put in great effort into the guild, but these are not a fully defined rank.</p>

<br><br>


<p><b><u>Level 2: Advisor</u></b></p>
<p>An Advisor is a member of the guild that has access to the Council Chambers for purposes of giving aditional voices/opinions on issues discussed. They do NOT have a vote on any form of Council Business, nor do they hold Officer Rank in game. They are still required to pay monthly Guild Dues. In regards to the Brotherhood, Advisors do NOT have access to the BH Officers Forums, but are known to the BH as Sr. Members of Bane Sidhe, and maybe contacted in lieu of a Councillor if no Councillor is online. (In otherwords, they have much of the responsibility but non of the privledges of being a Councillor... kinda makes ya wonder how we tricked 'em into it, doesn't it? Ah well... it was their idea for the most part...)<br><br>

Advisors are primarily Councillors that have stepped down from the Council, and should a spot in the Council open up, an Advisor may step back into the seat.  They are appointed on a case-by-case basis, but their numbers will be kept small.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b><u>Level 3: Council Member</u></b></p>
<p>This is the highest level of membership and is the only position that has a vote on guild policies and can GUILDINVITE a new recruit.</p>

<p>This is the highest level of example for the guild. You ALWAYS help when someone ALLIED to us is in need, and you do whatever is neccessary to establish the GUILD Name as a positive role model for all of Norrath.</p>

<p>You have been given the highest honor that we can bestow upon you and your participation is not only vital to the survival of our causes, but REQUIRED.</p>

<p>Councillors have access to the Brotherhood Officers forums, and participate in the discussions there that help to shape the Brotherhood.</p>

<br><hr>
<i>The Following 2 Ranks are Ranks held by Individuals, and are defined here to help people understand the guild structure.  They hold no more power than a Councillor, and as such are listed as a subset of the Councillor Rank.</i>
<hr><br>


<p><b><u>Level 3b: Elder</u></b></p>
<p>The Elder is the second in command of the guild.  They fill in for the Eldest as needed, and are the next in line to become Eldest should the current Eldest step down or be removed.  They hold no more importance than any other Council Member, but generally get charged with more work either in or out of game to help the guild.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b><u>Level 3a: Eldest</u></b></p>
<p>This person holds the rank of Guild Leader in game.  They are the leader of the guild and the council.  On the Council they hold ho more importance than any other Councillor, but they put in lots of work to the guild either in or out of game, or more often both.  This person is generally responsible for running the main guild Gem and Coin bank.</p>

<br><br>




<hr>

<p class="navyBold">How the Ranks Work:</p>
<p>While in Bane Sidhe, you are expected to listen to and respect each guild member.  If someone of higher rank than you offers you advice or a suggestion about how to do something (or how to/how not to behave) it is strongly reccommended that you listen to them respectfully.  Doing so might just save you from getting kicked out of the guild later.</p>

<br><br>

<p>In Bane Sidhe, the only Officers in game are the Council Members.</p>

<p>Should the time come when a councilmember needs to be replaced, Advisors will have first shot at stepping up to fill the vacancy.  Should no Advisor be interested in doing that, nominations will be held within the Guild Hall for the Guild to Elect who they want as the new Councillor.  The top few candidates following the Guild Election will then be examined and voted on by the Council, and the new Councillor will be promoted.</p>

<br><br>

<p>If you want the ability to invite and remove people in a guild, you're chances will be better in other Guilds.  These positions open up slowly in Bane Sidhe, and they take a lot of work both to earn and to maintain.  If you want a position of Responsibility, Authority, and Respect - Talk to a Council Member.</p>

<br><br>

<p>The Elder position opens up even more rarely than Councillor positions.  Filling this position is usually a combination of Appointment by the Eldest and approval by the Council.</p>

<br><br>

<p>The position of Eldest, when it opens up, is filled by the current Elder.</p>

<hr>

<p class="navyBold">Increaseing the Size of the Council</p>
<p>First, the Council must remain an odd number at all times.</p>
<p>Second, we will maintain a ratio of 10 (or less) Members for every 1 Council Member.</p>
<p>While it is certainly a possibility that we will one day grow large enough to increase the size of the Council, it is not our goal to grow as huge as we can until we fall apart.  Our membership will grow as we become capable of handling growth.</p>
<p>In other words - don't expect the size of the council to increase fast - which means a long time before a seat opens up on it.</p>

<p>When it comes time to increase the Council, the pool of people available to the position will come first from the Advisors, and will then go to a Guild Election followed by a Council Election.</p>

    <td class="header">Promotions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><p>There is no "set" criteria for promotions within the guild.  The process for getting promoted is simply to catch the eye of the Council and Guild.  When a Council seat opens up, it is both the Guild and Council that will be voting on who takes the seat, so if you want the position you'll have to work for it.</p>

<p>That being said, how do you get noticed?  Easy - impress us.  Be the epitome of a good guild member.  Let's see you participating in game, in guild chat, on the Forums, on raids, in hunting parties.  We like to hear from non-Guild players "hey, so-and-so is in your guild!  They really helped me a lot last week!"  We like hearing from guild mates "Wow, So-and-so is awesome.  They're always there helping anyone in the guild who needs it and I've loved the raids they've put together."</p>

<p>There is no insult in being passed over for a promotion.  It doesn't mean that we hate you.  If you're in the guild, it's pretty safe to assume that we DO like you and we DO like having you with us.</p>

<p>Members earn respect within the guild by doing what you always do to earn respect.  People who work hard for the guild will be recognized not only by the Council, but also by the rest of the Guild.  ANY Guild Member can lead a raid to ANY zone.  You don't have to be an officer to do so, you don't have to be in the guild for months before you can lead a raid.  If you want to do it, DO IT!</p>

<p>The ultimate rank in the guild is Council Member - which is not all fun and games.  It involves a lot of time, work, and caring about the guild.  If you are serious about wanting to make it onto the Council you will have to work hard for a long time.  Many members have worked hard for a month or so, many have been exemplary when a Council Seat was open.  That is not enough to cut it as a Councillor.  You have to work for it all the time, and really rise up in the guild as a respected friend and leader to have a serious shot at the Council.  This final Rank does not mean you get an easy ride... it just means more work and time spent working for the guild, and it can mean having to do some very hard things for the good of the guild.</p>
