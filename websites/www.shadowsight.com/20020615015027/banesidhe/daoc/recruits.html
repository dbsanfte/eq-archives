    <td><p>This is a section to provide our new recruits and those who are interested in joining Bane Sidhe an overview of what we're about, what to expect, and how to get into the guild.</p>

<p class="navyBold">What is Bane Sidhe?</p>
<p>First... let's cover pronunciation and meaning.  Bane Sidhe is pronounced "Banshee," and is Gaelic for the spirits/faeries called Banshees.  A more correct spelling of the term is "Bean Sidhe", but for asthetic purposes, we used the spelling "Bane Sidhe" when we originally formed.  Literally translated it means "Fairy Woman" or "Woman of the Good Folk," though we certainly aren't all women in the guild.  A Banshee in Irish folklore is a female Sidhe who has attached herself to one of the great, noble families.  This Banshee so loved the mortals of her family, that she would wail inconsolibly when a family member was going to die.  Only the family and those close to the doomed could hear her, the dying person could not.  Contrary to popular belief, the Wail of Banshee does not cause death, it only heralds death.<br><br>

Many tales and myths connect the Banshees to the Morrigan and the Fates.  To the Scots, a Bansee was the Washer Woman at the Ford, fortelling great hero's of their doom, and great druids of a geis.<br><br>

In all legends, the Banshee is a spirit or faerie that so loved live she opted to stay behind when the Sidhe left earth for Arcadia, and so loves life that she mourns deeply and greatly, when a mortal that she watches over is dying.</p>

<p>In legend, the faerie court was factioned into two opposing Courts - the Seelie (good) and the Unseelie (evil).  Banshees were not a part of the Court of Arcadia, having opted to remain on Earth - hence, Banshees are neither good nor evil.  DAoC in Hibernia represents the Seelie Court as the NPCs that "lead" Hibernia.  The Unseelie factions are the Siabra.  Again, Banshees are not a part of either faction, being concerned with neither one's goals or beliefs.</p>

<p>Contrary to many people's belief, Bane Sidhe is NOT short for Bane of the Sidhe, which would mean Fairy Killers.  Linguistically, to mean that we would have to be named Sidhebane... so if someone happens to call you a murderer, killer, etc. it is because they are likely under this misconception.</p>

<hr>

<p>Bane Sidhe is an online Role Playing Guild that exists in both EverQuest and Dark Age of Camelot.  We believe in honor, honesty, trust, and companionship.  We are a guild of friends, and in many ways we are like a family.  This does not mean that you have to like every single person in the guild, but we do want to make sure everyone can at least get along and have fun together.  There is no expectation that you take any guild relations outside of the game, though many of our members have found steadfast friends through the guild.</p>

<p>We believe that the worlds we inhabit are games, and that you should have fun while playing.  We are not a guild of powergamers, we are not loot happy, we are not huge raiders.  We do what we want to so long as we're having fun. </p>

<p>This is not to say that we don't take the game or the guild lightly - indeed, we're rather serious about it when it is warranted.  Our members are very dedicated to the guild, and as such we all work hard to avoid any problems within the guild.  When everyone cares about the guild as a whole and their fellow members, this is very easy to do.</p>

<p>In EQ, Bane Sidhe exists on Fennin Ro.  In DAoC, our main chapter is in Hibernia on Percival.  We have recently begun exploring Midgard on Nimue, and will play Albion on the third roleplaying Server.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="navyBold">What should you expect?</p>
<p>This is covered more thoroughly within the Guild Handbook, so this is just a brief overview.</p>
<p>What you can expect from the guild is a lot of fun.  We like to laugh and we do it a lot - we enjoy the game for what it is, a game.  On the Forums, we tell stories, we share jokes, we communicate as an online community.  Some of the events in the forums have brought tears to peoples faces... but I think that over all they bring laughter.  In game, we enjoy grouping together, raiding together, and holding fun events that leave us refreshed and happy.  You can expect little to no whining or begging from other guild members, and you can enjoy a guild that is relatively free of internal politics that plague and destroy many other guilds.</p>

<br><br>

<p>What the guild expects from you is participation.  We expect you to talk to us in Guild Chat, we expect you to read and post to the Forums, and we expect your participation at guild activities in game.  I know that many people have a problem with the Forums participation requirement.  It's really not that bad!  A few minutes a day and you will have gotten to know your guildmates better, learned something new, had a laugh or two, and gotten current on what events are up coming.  We don't expect you to post massive amounts, but we do like to see you posting if only because we know that you're around keeping up with us.  As a sub part of this participation, you are expected to know the contents of the website, specifically the Charter and the Handbook.</p>

<p>Members are expected to not whine and beg of the guild for anything.  We certainly are glad to help each other out, but making a nuisance of asking for it is a sure way to remove yourself from the guild.  Feel free to ask anyone in the guild for help - but be prepared to co-operate with them on how they can help you, and if they say "No" you just accept it and go on.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you are being asked to help a guildmate, we do expect you to help them.  Not necessarily everytime, certainly not to the expense of of your enjoyment of the game.  Comprimise with the member needing help if you can, help if you can.  Sometimes we just can't help everyone out for whatever reason - but please don't make it a habit.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="navyBold">So how do I sign up?</p>
<p>If Bane Sidhe sounds like a guild you are interested in being a part of, great!  For DAoC, we have a much more relaxed policy on how to join the guild than we do in EQ.  Much of this has to do with it being a newer game, and a lot of it has to do with being on a roleplaying server.  For now, if you are interested in the guild, just let us know that you have read up on the site (ideally by posting an introduction on the forums) and getting in touch with an officer for an invite.<br><br>

The first 2 weeks in the guild are an Initiate period.  Initiates cannot speak on Alliance Chat and are not able to wear the guild emblem.  During these 2 weeks, if there's any sort of problems and it's just not working out in some ways, you may leave (or be asked to leave) the guild with no hard feelings.
</p>

<br><br>
<p class="navyBold">Thanks for your time!</p>
<p>Thanks for considering Bane Sidhe as a possible guild for you!  We love getting new members, and we look forward to seeing you around the world!  Safe Journey!
