<p class="TopicHead">Policy and Changes Affecting the Guild</p>

<p>Any Council member can request a Council meeting to discuss a new policy or change to the guild.  They can also just post their proposed changes in the Council Chambers Forum.</p>

<p>Excepting major decisions defined below, a 4-3 majority vote will see the Policy passes and implemented.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="TopicHead">Guild Leader Only Commands</p>
<p>The office of the Guild Leader, as implemented by Verant Interactive has commands that are unique to that office.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this guild, the office of the Leader exists to enact the will of the council. Should the council elect to go to war, the Guild Leader must enact the war.</p>

<p>Same will apply to the promotion and demotion of officers.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="TopicHead">Increasing the number of Council Seats</p>
<p>The Council must always remain an odd number.  Ratio of Council Members to Members should remain at 1-10 or less.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="TopicHead">Election of a Council Member</p>
<p>Should one of the Council Members chose to leave the guild or the game, it would be common courtesy for them to notify us of this decision. If/When a seat opens up, nominations for a replacement may be made by anyone in the guild.</p>
<p>The person nominated should be an Officer, and has the option to decline the nomination.</p>
<p>There may be a maximum of four nominations for the seat.  The four candidates will be interviewed by the remaining Council, and the Council will vote on the four nominees.  To win the election, the nominee must recieve 5-2 vote in their favor.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="TopicHead">Removal of a Council Member</p>
<p>In the case of a Council member not performing their duties as appointed, the Council may hold a vote to remove a Council Member.  The member up for removal will not be voting in this case, and the vote must be 5-1 in favor of removing the Council Member for it to pass.</p>
<p>A removed Council Member is only demoted one level, down to Guild Officer (if they choose to stay with the Guild).  They are still a part of the Guild and should still be treated with the respect their work earns them.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="TopicHead">Election of the Guild Leader</p>
<p>Should The leader leave or quit, it is their responsibility to ensure that leadership has been passed on before leaving. In normal circumstances, the Elder will assume the mantle of leadership.</p>

<p>However, there should be a way for the council to call a vote of No Confidence in the current Leader. With a greater majority of council votes, 5-1, the leader will be replaced.</p>

<p>When the office of Guild Leader becomes open, the only available candidates are the current Council Members who have been in office for longer than 1 month (so that a new member has had time to get accustomed to the running of the guild). These council members are voted on by the guild as a whole, with the Council Members not participating in the voting.</p>

<p>The Leader must then pass off Guild Leadership to the duely elected replacement.</p>

<p>Depending on circumstances, the Leader being replaced may be reduced to simply being a Council member, may be reduced to a Guild Member, or may be removed from the guild. The level of punishment should be decided during the initial vote of No Confidence.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="TopicHead">The Council</p>
<p>The Council as a whole may help determine the focus of the Divisions. However, the day-to-day operations of each divison lies fully in the lap of the Councilmembers in charge of it. Only in circumstances where they cannot handle the situation without the full support of the council should matters be brought to the council's attention.</p>

<p>The Council are there to help run the guild.  They are there to provide direction and "official word" when neccesary.  If you have a problem with another member, or with something in the guild in general, the Council is where you should take it.  If someone has questions about our guild that you can't answer, pass them on to a Councillor.  Likewise if someone outside the guild needs to talk to an officer of Bane Sidhe about a problem with one of our member, to the Council it goes.</p>

<p>In the case of a Guild Member feeling that the Council Member is not performing their duties as appropriate, they may present their cause and reasoning to another Council Member.  Proposing it publicly will be considered Fomenting Discord and will not be looked upon favorably.  Using the proper channels allows for situations to be cleared up quickly and effectively, rather than starting a civil war within the guild.  If there is no Councillor online that you feel comfortable talking to about the situation, ask on the boards for one that you will talk to to email you.  If there is no Councillor that you feel comfortable talking to, bring it up with an Officer - failing that, bring it up with a Member in Good Standing.  Failing that, please bring it up with anyone who you feel comfortable with and have them pass it along on your behalf - the important thing is to communicate with us on any problems you may have so that we can address them.</p>
