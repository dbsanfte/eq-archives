		<br><p> This troll, he be born in Grobb. He be raised lonely, for him momma, him pappa, they be killed by Terrorantula while on journey to Oasis. All him brudders and sisters from same litter of troll pups, de be killed by frogloks when he little.<br>
<br>
Dis lonely orphan he fall into bad company. When him five he join guild, Servants of Darkness. Dem bad guild, dey no play game, dey no talk, dey never around. From time Oomba seven till him fifteen he see no one ever.<br>
<br>
One day when Oomba was nine, he sit down to meditate. Him meditate hard. De fleas on his head, dey burst into flames, he meditate so hard. He finally figure out some new spells. He learn to bind, he learn to SoW. Oomba decided it was time to see da world.<br>
<br>
Oomba, he like to travel. First he go to Freeport and peek at da guards from under the dock. He travel to Neriak and look at funny little dark guys. Dey sell strange food, give Oomba tummy ache. Den Oomba discover Lavastorm. Oomba love Lavastorm. He kill many flying rocks, and funny red birds. He only run from fire imps, dey is bad guys. Oomba pick up many heavy bricks dat others too weak to carry, and he get shinnies. He sell them in Neriak. Oomba get much money, buy much new equipment.<br>
<br>
Oomba hunt Najeena, Oomba stick his nose into Solesek's Eye, him die there one time, cause him not run too fast like monster who kill him. Oomba also hunt Feerot, Frontier Mountain, Lake Rathe, and South Karana, but him KOS to everything except the grass there.<br>
<br>
When Oomba turn 16, he hear about new land over ocean, so Oomba he ride boat to Overthere. He see Lake of Ill Omen, he see Frontier Mountains, he see Warsilk's Woods. Oomba no like Warsilk's Woods. He die to giant who sit on his bind spot. Giant, he kill Oomba seven times before Oomba, he get smart and turn off him computer thingie what has the little keys that troll fingers no fit on good. Den Oomba, he not 16 no more, he barely 15 then.<br>
<br>
Oomba, he no like new land. Never no one under 20 to make group with, never nothing level 15 he can kill alone, so Oomba he go back to Oasis.<br>
<br>
One day Oomba wake up and he find curse is lifted. Evil guild, Servants of Darkness go away, is guild no more and Oomba is free. Dat same day he fight in Oasis in group and man he say, "Oomba, you funny troll, you should be in our guild." So we go to West Commons and now Oomba has friends.<br>
<br>
Oomba be good Bane Sidhe. You need sow, you see Oomba, he give you sow. Oomba also very good at one thing. Oomba, because he travel, because he go places he should not go, he die many times. Oomba, if he not die so many times he not be 17, he be 25. Oomba, he get his corpse from many strange places. Oomba he get corpse from Najeena, he get corpse from Gukk, he get corpse from Solesek, he get corpse from lava pit. Oomba also get corpse from under Ocean of Tears, from Minotaur Cave in Steamfont, from house in Unrest, from shrine in Beholder's Maze, from ice orcs in Everfrost. If dere be one thing Oomba knows, it be how to get corpse.<br>
<br>
So you die and you say, "Now how am I going to get THAT corpse back?" You call Oomba, he know many tricks to get back corpse. And if you young feller and go somewhere new, need to find way, you tell Oomba, he have many maps, he know many loc-s of strange and wonderful things, cause Oomba, he like to go see...him die, it okay, so long as he has seen...<br>
<br>
