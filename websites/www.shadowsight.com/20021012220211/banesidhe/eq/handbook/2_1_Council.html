You want to know who they are and what they do I suppose?  The young are ever curious.</p><br>

<p class="navyBold">Purpose of the Council</p>
<p>The Council exists as the ruling body of the guild.  Only they have the power to invite people into our Guild, and only they can expell someone from the Guild.  They are the ones who determine the guilds policies.  They are Judge, Jury, and Executioner.</p>
<p>The Council is made up of Seven members.  It must remain an odd number so that in voting there can never be an even deadlock.  In all votes, majority rules.</p>
<p>Members to Council is a ratio that must never be greater than 10 to 1.  Should a we reach a point where there are more than 10 members for every Council member, the size of the Council will be increased.</p>
<br><br>
<p class="navyBold">Members of the Council</p>
<p>Who are the Council members that lead this guild?  They are the Elders of the guild.  They banded together to plan and form this guild, and they are the heart and soul of it.</p>
