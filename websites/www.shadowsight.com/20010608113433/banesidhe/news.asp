If a $ icon appears next to you name, it means you still owe dues for March.  Leave your mouse over this icon for a moment to see how much you owe.  As dues are paid up, I will keep the roster updated.<br>
<br>
Sunidai has done an amazing job of keeping track of this guild, folks.  Buy her a drink the next time you see her, because she's earned it!
