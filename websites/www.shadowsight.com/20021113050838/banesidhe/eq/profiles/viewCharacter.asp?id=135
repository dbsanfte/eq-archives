		<br><p>*Sighs and orders a tankard of ale from the barkeep.*<br>
My life story is a hard one for me to bare....<br>
Takes a deep breath and starts her story.<br>
I grew up with two older brothers, who were always seeking out trouble. Tossing stones near the lift guards to make them think it was an intruder, sneaking behind Orc Pawns and placing bulls-eyes on their backs...if you can think of it, they did it. I was always tagging along behind them, because I loved traveling around Faydwer seeing all the sights. Time came for the three of us to learn the ways of battle and train under our parents. My brothers decided to train in the ways of a Warrior, following in the footsteps of my father...so I naturally started to train under my mother, in the arts of a Ranger. <br>
*Pauses and sighs deeply...continues on with her story.*<br>
One day, in the warmer part of the year, my two brothers and I were out training in Ak'Anon with a few of our Gnome friends. It was a very fun time for us, the sun was shinning down on us and there was a light breeze in the air. Then the sun started to dim, as we looked up we saw massive dark clouds hovering overhead. I told my brothers that it was time for us to say our goodbyes to our friends and be off, but they chuckled and said to me "Nay, dear sister. We will be fine."<br>
*Shakes her head.*<br>
Their words still echo in my ears when I dream at night.... As the rain began to fall on the land, we heard yelling from over a ridge near us....in some strange language. Our Gnome friend ran for their caves as fast as a wolves, but my brothers and I stood there not knowing what was about to happen. We turned around, there behind us, was a horrid looking creature. It towered over the three of us carrying a huge Axe in one hand. We froze in our spots, petrified. I opened my mouth to try and yell for help, but nothing came out. It glared down at my brothers and snorted at them, raising it's Axe to strike. Seeing this, they turned on their heels and began to run to the Gnome's cave. In one mighty swing the monster hit both of my brother, knocking them to the ground. Finally my yell emitted from my mouth as my brothers' lifeless bodies laid in front of it. I began to back peddle away from the enormous beast. It slowly turned around, turning it's attention to it's next victim. I turned around and ran as fast as my little elven feet could carry me. With the monster hot on my heels, I ran for home. If only I could get to the path in the mountain, for I knew that the hideous creature was far too big to fit through the opening. I tired quickly from the long run, but made it to the path. As I started walking into the path the beast rammed itself into the opening to get me, the shock of the impact made me fall to the ground. The monster reached in the opening with it's Axe and swung. I managed to get to my feet, but the Axe found it's mark as it hit my shoulder. The force of the blow pushed me the rest of the way through the cave, out of the monsters reach. Much after that is very foggy, as I must have past out from the pain. I remember waking up in my bed with my mother sitting next to me. I smiled to her and thought it was nothing but a bad dream, till I moved and felt the pain in my shoulder. My mother look at me and a tear ran down her face. She told me that a man had brought me back and if it wasn't for him that I would have joined my brothers on the ill-fated day. After healing for a while I began to roam around Norrath, fighting and learning the ways of the Ranger. So that one day I will find that creature and seek my revenge on it, so that my brothers' souls can finally rest in peace.<br>
*Downs her ale in one gulp, slamming the tankard on the bar top.*<br>
Soon, my brothers.....soon.<br>
