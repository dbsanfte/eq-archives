		<br><p>I be Stoutheart - now gimme an Ale!<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Well, I?m a finished with me Ale now? so I suppose it?s story time.<br>
<br>
Truth, there?s not much to tell.<br>
<br>
My parents were fairly poor Dwarves, my Father in the Stormguard, my mother a tavern wench. We got by, but life was nothing extravagant. I spent my child hood running through the mines with the miners guild, and suppose I had started to become something of an undesireable in town.<br>
<br>
One day, this Feir?Dal is sitting down to dinner with Mumsy and Poppa. Judging from his attire, I figured he?s a Druid. Turns out I?m right, and he?s talking to Mumsy and Poppa about taking me under his wing or something or other.<br>
<br>
Well, my parents were awfully impressed with him, and basically signed me away into this... this... ELF?S control!<br>
<br>
<br>
I spent the next several years learning to be a healer. Apparantly this elf was dissapointed in his ability to heal, and saw the need for more healers in Norrath. He taught me as best he could in the ways that he knew, but a Dwarf is NOT cut out to be a druid. I learned something of his interpertation of the Mother-of-All, and a bit o? the love of Tunare. Finally this Elf apprenticed me to the Clerics of Underfoot and I began to learn how to be a priest o? Brell.<br>
<br>
When my novitiate was finished and I was turned loose in the world, my patron set me loose with some nice gear and a bodyguard. Fyndhorn took me across the face of Norrath, guiding my adventures and keeping me safe.<br>
<br>
Well? the time has come when I be almost ready to surpass my patron at healing. Soon I will master the ability of Superior Healing, and then I fear my patron will retire.<br>
<br>
ShadowSight is a good patron, and I know he?ll never be far from me. It is his wish that I should take over leading this guild of his, the Bane Sidhe. I cannot refuse my patrons request, though I tell ye that I take on his challenge with a wary spirit.<br>
<br>
I?m not much like ShadowSight? I drink a bit more, I?m a dwarf, and I?m a priest o? Brell. I don?t tolerate much nonsense in conversation, though I can certainly spout it off at times.<br>
<br>
I also laugh more?n he does.<br>
<br>
I dinnae know what it is about him? and most elves, truth be told. They?re usually so serious it scares me. Of course, who can understand the ways of the tall folk? They?re all weird, and elves be the freakiest of all?<br>
<br>
Ah well... times a-fleeting. I have to get going if I?m to master my new healing ability tonight.<br>
<br>
Don?t hate me cause I?m short, stumpy, drunk, and have a beard. If you were perfect, I wouldn?t hate you.<br>
<br>
Now ? gimme another ale, you tall freak behind the bar ? it?s drinkin? time!!!!<br><br>
