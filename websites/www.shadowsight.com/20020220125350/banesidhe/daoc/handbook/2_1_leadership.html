    <td>
<p><b>Eldest</b><br>
The guild is modeled after a somewhat Feudal System.  All power for decisions comes from the Eldest, who's word is law within the guild.  Advised by the Elder and the Council of Lords, the Eldest has final word on all policy decisions, alliances, disciplinary actions, and rewards.  The Eldest's job is to make the guild a fun and fair place, where we can all have fun.  Obviously, this means taking a keen interest in what the members of the Guild want, so if you have suggestions or ideas, please let the Eldest know!</p>
<br>

<p><b>Elder</b><br>
Immediately below the Eldest is the Elder, who has nearly the same power and authority as the Eldest, and should be treated as respectfully.  When the Eldest is not around, the Elder's word should be considered as final as the Eldest's.  Can act more or less independently of the Eldest to give two major people working for the same goal.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Lords</b><br>
Below the Elder is the Council of Lords.  Lords have the trust to act independently for the good of the guild, and serve as Advisors to the Elder and Eldest.  May act as immediate arbitor of problems online, with the Lord's decision being considered a temporary answer until it can be ratified by the Elder or Eldest.<br>
Lords may have a specific task that they focus on for the guild, such as planning events, or being the head of Recruiting.  In these areas, Lords are allowed to act more or less autonomously of the Eldest, so long as the focus and drive of the Lord's works is within a scope already approved by the Eldest.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Registrar</b><br>
This is a person only slightly less powerful than a Lord, who's main duties to the guild is maintaining administrative duties of Rank.  They can promote and demote members, as well as invite new members into the guild.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Officers</b><br>
Officers are minor versions of the Registrar.  Can handle the promotion and demotion of members of the guild, but cannot invite or remove people.  They can speak on and answer Officer Chat, and in times of war (RvR) will act within the guild as Military Officers.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Elite</b><br>
Elite Banshees are simply the higher level members of the guild - being level 45+ or having a tradeskill of 700+.  They have the ability to speak to Officer Chat as a form of getting help from a higher ranking member, but hold no privledges of Rank themselves.  This Rank functions as a goal, and a sign of respect to those who have dedicated themselves to representing the guild at the higher end of the game (crafting and leveling).</p>
<br>

<p><b>Knight</b><br>
The Knights are Banshees of level 35+, who have worked hard to reach their level, which benefits the guild in regular hunting and in RvR.  They hold no privledges of rank, but are to be commended for their work in leveling.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Craftsman</b><br>
Craftsmen are Banshees who have a skill of 500+ in their primary tradeskill.  This takes a lot of time and dedication, and helps give the guild a strong basis of crafters to help keep the guild equipped for only the cost of Materials.  They hold no privledges of rank, but are to be commended for their work in crafting.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Members</b><br>
Members are those who have fulfilled their Initiate period and are full fledged Banshees.  They hold no privledges of Rank, but are due the respect and consideration of a Guildmate.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Initiates</b><br>
Initiates are newly invited people who are still learning the ways of the guild.  They may not yet wear our Emblem, nor may they hear or speak on Alliance chat.  The Initiate period lasts 2 weeks, at which point it is up to the Initiate to meet with an Officer or higher to be promoted to full Member.  Initiates are expected to listen to Members, but do not have to follow a Members Orders.  Initiates deserve the respect and consideration of a Guildmate.</p><br>
