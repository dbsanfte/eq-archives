    <td><br><br><p>Welcome to Bane Sidhe!</p>
	<p>Perhaps you are wondering, "what is this group of insane people all about?", yes?  Well, sit ye back and let me tell you a bit about us.</p>
	
	<p>First let's work on the name o' the Guild.  Yer probably sitting there saying "Bain Side" or "Bain sid-he" or something close to that, aren't ya?  That does not be how to pronounce our name.  'Tis quite simple, really:  Banshee.  Aye, like the spirit of mourning and the so-called "harbinger of death."  The way we spell the name be the way the ancient, almost mythical Celtic Tribe spelled it.  If'n someone e'er asks ya "WTF is your guild name" just tell them "Banshee" and make 'em think for themselves for a change.</p>

<br>

<p>Why do we have this name, you ask?  Well now, you can make your own decisions on that one.  Or you can research our history and guess at it yerself.  To me, we are all Banshees in one form or another.  We manifest a physical body and clothe it with armor and weapons and head out to seek our fortune in Norrath.  When we are damaged too much, our physical form gives up on us and we return to the Affinity point which we are bound to, once again in a naked physical form.  We trot off to the location of our last form and get all of our stuff back and continue on our merry way.  Sort of like a spirit might do, wouldn't you say?  Now stop asking questions so I can explain the guild to you a bit more.</p>

<p class="navyBold">A Brief Guild History</p>
<p>Where did we come from?  That be a longer telling than I have time for, so I'll keep it short as I can.  Most of our council members and a good portion of our starting members came from a guild called "Child of Tunare."</p>
<p>Sadly, Child of Tunare was racked by internal problems and strife and eventually a disagreement between the Guild Mistress and the officer staff rent the guild apart.  The Guildmistress disbanded the guild and committed suicide.  Saddened and changed by these events the officers of Child of Tunare banded together and formed Bane Sidhe.</p>
<p>The spirit of Child of Tunare is carried on by the new guild, Sword of Tunare.  We, Bane Sidhe, are <b>not</b> Child of Tunare reborn.</p>
