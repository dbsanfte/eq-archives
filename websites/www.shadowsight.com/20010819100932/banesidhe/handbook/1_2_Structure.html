    <td><p>Bane Sidhe is lead by a Council of 7.  These 7 Council Members are responsible for determining and enforcing the policies of the guild.  Two Council Members are the nominal "heads" of each of the 2 Divisions.  The 5th Council Member is a Wanderer, filling in where needed.  The last 2 positions are those of Elder and Eldest, the leaders of the Council.  The Elder is the second in command of the guild.  The Eldest is the leader of the guild.</p>

<p>We have two divisions, each division serving several areas.

<p><b>Administration and Support-</b> This is the division of the guild that keeps track of what's going on in the guild and provides for the guild.  They are our Reporters, our Historians, and our Researchers.  They also serve as the Zone Explorers and Guides, they are the folks who help set up raids for the benefit of our members.  If you have questions or need help with something in game, this is the place to come.</p>


<p><b>Strategic-</b> Pretty simple.  These are the men and women who defend the guild and are on the front lines of the battles in Guild wars.  <i>All</i> members of Bane Sidhe will take place in Guild Wars however - not just the military section of the Strategic Division.  Also within the Strategic Division is the Guild Relations, or political aspect of the guild.  These are the people who research other guild for potential allies, who set up and maintain the alliances we have, and are the official points of contact for our allied guilds.</p>
