    <td><p>This is a section to provide our new recruits and those who are interested in joining Bane Sidhe an overview of what we're about, what to expect, and how to get into the guild.</p>

<p class="navyBold">What is Bane Sidhe?</p>
<p>First... let's cover pronunciation.  Bane Sidhe is pronounced "Banshee," and is Gaelic for the spirits called Banshees.  Hence, Bane Sidhe Members are often referred to as Banshees, and we use the lost spirit/spirit of mourning/spirit of warning as a motif in much of our guild roleplaying.</p>

<p>Bane Sidhe is a Guild on Fennin Ro that believes in honor, honesty, trust, and companionship.  We are a guild of friends, and in many ways we are like a family.  This does not mean that you have to like every single person in the guild, but we do want to make sure everyone can at least get along and have fun together.  There is no expectation that you take any guild relations outside of EQ, though many of our members have found steadfast friends through the guild.</p>

<p>We believe that EverQuest is a game, and that you should have fun while playing it.  We are not a guild of powergamers, we are not loot happy, we are not huge raiders.  We do what we want to so long as we're having fun.  We have raids, yes, but we also have just for fun events, like Buff the Newbie Nights, or drunken brawling in an Arena.  There's a lot to be said for just sitting around hanging out in Norrath.</p>

<p>This is not to say that we don't take the game or the guild lightly - indeed, we're rather serious about it when it is warranted.  Our members are very dedicated to the guild, and as such we all work hard to avoid any problems within the guild.  When everyone cares about the guild as a whole and their fellow members, this is very easy to do.</p>

<br><br>


<p class="navyBold">What should you expect?</p>
<p>This is covered more thoroughly within the Guild Handbook, so this is just a brief overview.</p>
<p>What you can expect from the guild is a lot of fun.  We like to laugh and we do it a lot - we enjoy the game for what it is, a game.  On the Forums, we tell stories, we share jokes, we communicate as an online community.  Some of the events in the forums have brought tears to peoples faces... but I think that over all they bring laughter.  In game, we enjoy grouping together, raiding together, and holding fun events that leave us refreshed and happy.  You can expect no whining or begging from other guild members, and you can enjoy a guild that is relatively free of internal politics that plague and destroy many other guilds.</p>

<br><br>

<p>What the guild expects from you is participation.  We expect you to talk to us in Guild Chat, we expect you to read and post to the Forums, and we expect your participation at guild activities in game.  I know that many people have a problem with the Forums participation requirement.  It's really not that bad!  A few minutes a day and you will have gotten to know your guildmates better, learned something new, had a laugh or two, and gotten current on what raids and events are up coming.  We don't expect you to post massive amounts, but we do like to see you posting if only because we know that you're around keeping up with us.  As a sub part of this participation, you are expected to know the contents of the website, specifically the Charter and the Handbook.</p>

<p>Members are expected to not whine and beg of the guild for anything.  This can run from items, money, and powerleveling to ports and rezzes.  We certainly are glad to help each other out, but making a nuisance of asking for it is a sure way to remove yourself from the guild.  Feel free to ask anyone in the guild for help - but be prepared to co-operate with them on how they can help you, and if they say "No" just accept it and go on.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you are being asked to help a guildmate, we do expect you to help them.  Not necessarily everytime, certainly not to the expense of of your enjoyment of the game.  Comprimise with the member needing help if you can, help if you can.  If you can't, well, sometimes we just can't - but please don't make it a habit.</p>

<p>We also have Guild Dues that are due on a monthly basis, based off of your level.  This money is used to finance guild raids, awards for contests, and just about anything that we can think of that requires money - new ideas are always welcome!</p>

<br><br>

<p class="navyBold">So how do I sign up?</p>
<p>If Bane Sidhe sounds like a guild you are interested in being a part of, great!  We're pretty easy to get in to, but bear in mind that our requirements exist as they are to help ensure that we get members who are a good fit for the guild... and who the guild is a good fit for.</p>
<b>Requirements to Join:</b>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Must be a minimum level of 15
	<li>Must participate actively on our Forums for 1 week (7 days)  Start by posting an introduction <a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/fbanesidhefrm4">here</a> and then check out the other forums!
	<li>Must attend one guild Event in game
</ul>
<p>Note that by Event, we mean Event, not necessarily raid.  Though a raid is a Guild Event and does qualify for this, so does a Buff Night or Fishing Contest.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="navyBold">Thanks for your time!</p>
<p>Thanks for considering Bane Sidhe as a possible guild for you!  We love getting new members, and we look forward to seeing you around Norrath.  Safe Journey!
