	<td><br><p>Just to clear one thing up immediately.  Number 2 is the most important item I can stress.  I want our guild to be known across Norrath as people who can be trusted.  If someone wants to do an item swap from one character to another, and they ask you to help, you are expected to perform the swap with no difficulties.  Even if they're swapping a full suit of Cobalt Armor and a full suit of Elder Spiritist Armor.</p>
<p>Please note that Item swaps are just an example - when you give someone your word, you KEEP it.  If a group mate goes LD, you hold their spot for awhile.  If a group mate needs to log for a short time and asks you to hold a spot for them, and you give you word to - KEEP it.  You'll be surprised at how many people will really appreciate this common courtesy.</p>
<p>It also makes for great roleplaying - "I give you my word of Honor..." has started god knows how many adventures!</p><br><br>

</tr>
<tr>
	<td><br><p>As time has gone on, it seems that people are having a harder and harder time of comprehending or supporting what this means.  For some, it can't be this nebulous idea and way of life, they demand rules.  When problems have arisen, they don't understand how this charter can cover it since there are no specific "rules" laid out.</p>

<p>This Addendum is being added on to try and help these people.</p>

<p><b><i>GOLDEN RULE: No list of rules can cover 100% of every possible situation, and hence any situation (Covered here OR NOT) may be handled on a case by case basis!!!!!</i></b></p>

<p>
<ol start="1"">
	<li>Be yourself and have fun!  We're not looking for clones who are all the same, though some people will claim that these "rules" ask for just that.  Ironically, they are the same people that are asking for the "rules" to be laid out for them in the first place.  We have many diverse people and personalities in the guild, and we follow these rules without being clones.  If following these rules will make EQ not fun for you, or if following these rules will require you to change who you are - Bane Sidhe is most definitely NOT the guild for you.<br><br>

	<li>Do unto Others as you would have Others do unto you.  An it harm none, do what thou wilt.  Whatever you send out, be it good or evil comes back to you threefold.  Karma.  If ever you needed a living example that these rules WORK, EQ is the place to find that out.<br><br>

	<li>Do not be a Rule Lord.  See the Golden Rule.  Don't run around thumping people with this list of rules.<br><br>

	<li>Follow the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp">EverQuest Code of Conduct and Play Nice Policies</a>.  This is not just a guild rule, this is something you agree to every time you log in to EverQuest (EULA Item 6).  There are those out there that will break these rules as often as they can just because they are there.  These rules are really quite simple.  They are be nice and be honorable.  You'll note that those are in our Charter.<br><br>

	<ul type="disc">
		<li>If people are committing offenses against you in game and you desire to retailliate against them, you <b>will</b> use the proper channels: <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/features/report.jsp">/report and /petition</a> (also see <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3429">this article regarding the use of /report</a>).  The Guild will help you in this.  We will talk to GMs for or with you.  We will take it up with the offender's guild.  We will do everything in our power to stop them, or to make life uncomfortable for them - <b>within the rules.</b><br><br>

		<li>If someone commits and offense against you you will <b>never</b> break these rules in retailiation.  Do you really want to stoop to their level to fight a fight of their choosing?  Or would you rather use your head and get them banned from EQ entirely?<br><br>
	</ul>

	<li>Respect and Honor your Guildmates.  If something you do or say is offensive to others in the guild, respect them enough to stop and Apologize if you offend them.<br><br>

	<li>The guild tags you wear carry our reputation, your actions affect our reputation, be they actions in Group, Zone Wide Communication, World Wide Communication, Tells, Trades, Emotes, whatever.<br><br>

	<ul type="disc">
		<li>Do not be offensive in Zone Wide Communication (shout, ooc, auction).  This includes use of language and attitude.  Do not argue with people, do not rant and rave about whatever it is.  Take it to tells, solve it privately and politely.<br><br>

		<li>Do not be offensive in World Wide Communication (Bazaar, any other Global Chat Channel).  This includes use of language and attitude.  Do not argue with people, do not rant and rave about whatever it is.  Take it to tells, solve it privately and politely.<br><br>

		<li>Be a good group mate.  Don't loot everything.  If things go wrong, don't throw blame around, simply pick up, CR, and try to work through it so that it doesn't happen again.  Try to give warning before you have to leave a group.<br><br>

		<li>Do not Trade Scam <b>anyone ever for any reason</b>.<br><br>
	</ul>

	<li>Respect the Council.  When they talk to you about a problem, do not get offended.  Do not get defensive and attack them.  They work hard to keep this guild a fun and happy place for all of our members, and by talking to you they are trying to keep it that way.  Listen to them.  If they bring up a problem or a concern with your actions or behavior, listen to them and try to avoid it happening again.  Yes, you can give your side of the story, but try to do so in as non-offensive as a way possible.   <i>Remember that if they're talking to you about a violation of this Charter, they could just remove you from the guild rather than trying to work things out.  We care enough to work with you - be so kind as to reciprocate that and work with us <b>politely and friendly</b>.</i><br><br>

	<li>Respect and Honor our Allies and Brothers.  Infractions against them will be taken more seriously than infractions against Bane Sidhe.<br><br>

	<li>Watch the language in guild chat.  Excessive cussing, foul, and abusive language will not be tolerated.  While many Banshees are adults, we are open to children and this should be taken into consideration at all times.<br><br>

	<li>Loot is an important part of EQ.  Do not make yourself look greedy by wanting everything that drops for you or an alt or a friend or whatever.  Remember that we work together to help ALL of the Guild (and Allies and the Brotherhood).  Be happy when one of your friends in those 3 categories gets loot.<br><br>

	<li>If you ask for help and are told no by a guild mate, do not make a pest out of yourself over the issue.<br><br>

	<li>When you do ask for help from a guild mate, try to keep it reasonable, and listen to those more experienced than you on what is reasonable and what is not.<br><br>
