    <td><p>Bane Sidhe is lead by a Council of 7.  These 7 Council Members are responsible for determining and enforcing the policies of the guild.  Two positions within the Council are those of Elder and Eldest, the leaders of the Council.  The Elder is the second in command of the guild.  The Eldest is the leader of the guild.</p>

<p>Bane Sidhe is a very open structured guild.  We have a simple system of ranks that allows us great flexibility.  There's no structure to limit or shape what members can do, nothing to hold you back from becomming whatever you want to be within the guild.  ANY Guild Member can lead raids to ANY zone that they wish.  Guild Members can be trusted with running some guild banks.</p>

<p>Remember that there are more ways to grow with Bane Sidhe than just by playing.  The Message Boards are a vital part of the community of Bane Sidhe, and they exist completely outside of EQ.  Level, class, playing times, whatever have no bearing on the Boards, and you can become an important and well respected guild member there - without ever stepping foot in Norrath if you so desire.</p>
