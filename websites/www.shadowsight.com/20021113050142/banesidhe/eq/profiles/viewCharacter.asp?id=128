		<br><p>I was born to a very loving family in the great city of Felwithe. We lived in a section of town that only merchants lived at. Both my parents were devoted to making me very happy. I was the only child after several attempts at childbirth. My parents spent all their time possible with me. Until the time came and I started to have trouble with other children. They would make fun of me because of my one blue eye and one green eye. So instead of being friends with other elf children I created my own friends. Some were made of water others of air. My parents became frightened and didn't approve of my so-called friends. They used to forbid me to play with them. I tried as much as my parents tried to hide the fact that I was different than the other merchant children. It didn't work especially when the children started calling me names and throwing sticks at me <br>
That is the day that my life changed completely. One of the elf boys was being extra mean to me that day and I couldn't control my temper so I wished him away or hurt real bad. What is a child of my tender years to know that wishes like that sometimes come true? One of my friends that my parents didn't approve off started to hurt the elf boy. I tried to stop him but I had no control on him. That is the day that my parents sent me away to a master magician to learn the art of magic. It is also the saddest day when I was separated from those that I loved.<br>
At first it wasn't so bad and then the old magician started to get mean and never speak to me with a kind word. I think he was a little bitter. I stayed for several years trying to learn how to control my temper and what I found out then to be my pets and not friends. I worked hard and he was never happy. My parents never came to see me either. So one day I packed my things and ran away to go find my parents. When I arrived home, they were gone. I asked around if anybody had seen them and was told that they had been gone for years. It seems that a group of merchants got together to go on a new venture. Some new land was found and they wanted to be the first to arrive and see what could be sold. Yet nobody had heard from any of those that went. Nobody knew what had happened or if they still lived. So I have no home and will not have one until I have located my parents. I will travel all the known lands and then those that are uncharted until I find those that I love.<br><br>
