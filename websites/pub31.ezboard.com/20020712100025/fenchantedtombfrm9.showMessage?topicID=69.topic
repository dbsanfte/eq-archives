We pulled a Verdant Giant and as we were starting the fight I got hit a few times real fast for 300 - 500 points of damage. I Died before i knew what hit me. I looked up and seen &quot;you have been slain by Xibliat Fer&quot; .As I did a who earlier I remember seeing alot of Enchanted Tomb members there. so I did a /who all &quot;Enchanted Tomb&quot;. I see Bigscat is in burning woods. As I have met Bigscat a few times doing Andromita Psychicstorm's Chanter epic mob in Iksar city and a time or two with PotB raids and epic stuff. I thought I'd send a tell asking him if the people there was doing a cleric epic or running around for the mage epic pieces there. I got no reply. After a few mins I did a /who all Bigscat. He was no longer on. No biggie, look at list again and see who else is there. So I send a tell to Xilunder or something like that. No reply back. After a few more minutes I send a tell to Candyrose. Once again no reply. A Druid in zone my Druid friend remembered the name of and was talking to said he asked in zone and he got nothing in reply from no one. I am started to get a bit heated now. Dieing in level 52 and losing 3 blues tends to sit a bit wrong with me, when it is caused by an epic mob that is triggered. I send Candyrose another tell as she being, the only cleric in zone, you can see and being in Enchanted Tomb. I ask if she was doing Celric epic and if so could we get a rez since Xibliat plowed through us. A minute later she replies finally &quot;Sorry raiding&quot;. Ok by now I have finally made it back to BW nekid and out of food and water. My Druid Friend has sent a few tells and the other druid in zone has tried to contact someone in the guild and really no one has gotten no where. Two minutes has passed since I sent last tell to Candyrose. So I do a /who in zone and no Enchanted Tomb Guildies in zone any more. Zone is down to 16 people now. Now I am really pissed. As I have sent tells and people in the zone knew we were looking for help with getting our corpses back and rezzed if posssible. So I send a tell to Candyrose stating &quot;Thanks for helping. Lets me know what kind of people Enchanted Tomb have in their guild and what Kind of Guild Enchanted Tomb is really like. /bow&quot; (words to that effect, forget the exact words, I was friggin pissed by now. A simple we can't help would have sufficed, but to not do anything and lie about it all, bah worthless!). Nothing in return, like I expected any after what just happened. By this time My Druid friend has talked to someone named Wor or somethng like that. He said send Vian a tell and he will help. Well she does but Vian says talk to Wor and was a bit of a snob about it. So after a bit of Doing on my friends part she gets a hold of Landie. Landie gets Vian and Essej (I think is how his name was spelled). By now I have done looted most my gear and sitting invised near our corpses. Landie and company show up. Vian Rezzes me and says sorry that we got killed by Xibliat. I said it would not have been so bad if the people we talked to would have shown concern about what happenend. He then stated something bout they thought they got everyone settled before the guild left the zone. BS! Candyrose for sure knew we were asking for help. She was getting ready to leave the zone when she told me &quot;sorry raiding&quot;. She wasn't raiding it was over by then and everyone was getting ready to get ported out. I can hold nothing against anyone here but Candyrose and Vian. Cause Candyrose for sure knew, I told her. Vian knew cause he had done talked to my friend. So telling me the guild thought everything was settled was a bit big headed on your parts. Like you think your better than anyone else and helping other people that has been hurt by the actions from the guild or guild members are of no consiquence to you. It is my firm belief that ones actions in one thing denote ones actions in all things. To me Candyrose and Vian have both done a great injustice to your guild, they have shown that they have no honor and care only for themselves.<br>
<br>
I cant hold nothing against Bigscat. he was logging. Nor Xilunder (Sorry if I got your name wrong), he was probably fighting or Essej as he had done nothing but healed us after we finally got help. Thanks Essej! and also thanks to Vian for rezzing us!<br>
<br>
To Landie, Thank you! You at least showed you have Honor and care about how your guild looks to others.<br>
<br>
The only reason I posted this is because of they way I felt Vian had been by saying they thought everything was ok when the Guild left the zone. It was said a bit pompously and was a lie, someone knew and chose do nothing about it. <br>
<br>
Now for just something I would like to express about my beliefs. While this is just a game, there are real people behind the characters you see. How you treat them reflects on you personally and your guild. It also puts your karma on the wind, and what you put out always returns home.<br>
<br>
Respectfully and Sincerely, <p>"I want to Kill! I want to see blood, guts, gore, and veins in my teeth. I want to Kill!"

The rezz got takin care of and if we didn't care we wouldn't have came all the way back from Bazaar to do the rezz.  Sorry you have trouble contacting someone but usualy thats what happens when you try talking to our guild leader in the middle of something like that.  We know Vian is busy in tells and leading things so we tend to let the officers take care of things like this and thats what I did.  You all got your rezz's so everyone be happy.<br>

Like vian said, EQ doesnt revolve around only you.. the guild has its own schedule to stick to..  Sry for the inconvenience, but there really isnt anything here suggesting that anyone here is stupid enough to eat squirrel turds, or likes leaving people dead... these people are great, they have helped numerous people, even outside the guild.. a couple days ago, about 12 of em showed up to help kill faydedar for my brother.. he isn't even in ET, but because they are so great, they came anyway..  This guild, and everyone in it is great,  because a raid was going on, things cant happen right when you want them to.. Im sorry for your 4% exp loss, but it will take no time at all to get back..But rippin on the guildies and their personalities isnt the best way to go about it..<br>

<br>
Candyrose can't speak english, must be very hard for her to get anything done in the game as most people speak english.<br>
I never sent any tell at all to you, my friend did. Now if War was really gonna drag us to zone why was we not told to consent him? If you were gonna rez us at zone. Then why did you leave the zone before you done what you said you would? All BS to me. Are you following me? That is what I have a problem with not your guild. When I sent Candy that tell about your guild I was very pissed by then, when myself and my friend have sent various tells to people and people in the zone who were near us sent ooc's and shouts and none of us got much of anything in return. It took almost an hour to get anything done.<br>
<br>
You dont see much of a problem? How would you like to be sitting in zone for bout a minute then get you and your freind plowed over by an epic mob that someone let loose and no one said they were doing so? Then be told we will get on it then everyone leave zone before they do what they say? I am not trying to argue, I am just trying to get the man to see the point. By his own admission he said he would get us dragged and rezzed, yet he left the zone before doing so. Yes we got rezzed later but it took us over 20mins after everyone left zone to do so. I myself would never do anything like that if I accidently put someone out. I would stay there till it was handled. The people involved would know that I at least stood up for than just my guild and friends.<br>
<br>
If I have pissed anyone off about my comment about your Guild I humbly offer my sincerest apologizies. It is not your guild I was pissed at but rather they way things where handled. It could have been done in a more respectful manner. <p>"I want to Kill! I want to see blood, guts, gore, and veins in my teeth. I want to Kill!"

Candy is a great person even though she cannot speak but a very very few words of english.  She knows her role and does it very very well, even though she doesnt understand much of what we say, so leave her alone bud.  Talking bad about a person as great as Candy will get you nowhere with me or anyone else here.<br>
<br>
I was not in the zone, but I know how this guild does things.  They are very busy with the raid and are very focused on what they are doing.  They cannot always send tells to every person they get a tell from.  Do you not raid much?  You for sure have to know about buff duty and raid control.  Its called tell hell in less words.  I know they always /shout /ooc whats about to be done.  And you had to see it if your chat channels were turned on.  So if they weren't on, dont blame us, if you didnt see them, dont blame us they put em out there so people wouldnt die.  Also, epic mobs go super agro on anyone sitting down in their agro radius, which is pretty damn big.  If you were sitting down then I can see how you got ninja agro'd like that.<br>
<br>
I'm very sorry you were killed by the big arse elemental, but I'm also very glad you got your epic rez.  That is very important, and at lvl 52 your not going to have any trouble getting it back.  Now if you were at lvl 59 in complete hell of all hell levels, I'd be a bit more upset.  Anyway, I'm sorry it happend, but you got rez'd, what more is there to talk about?  Why is there the need for this thread at all?  To bish and complain about 4% exp loss in lvl 52?  Go fly a kite man, 4% at 52 is NOTHING.  Sorry for not responding to your tells the very instant you sent them, and if they were not to your liking, but its all over now, so go get a massage or something and relax.<br>
<br>
My guild went back to the zone to rez you, after they already left.  If they did not care they wouldnt of helped you out at all.  So drop it.<br>

And some of those people hardly speak english or dont speak it at all. Heck, there are guilds out there consisting mostly of people that speak Japanese or korean or whatever, so that they can play EQ and still interact with people. From the little I know of Candy, she is a nice person, and @#%$ hot!! Please step out of your little plastic bubble and understand this concept (the whole english thing, not the whole she's hot thing).<br>
