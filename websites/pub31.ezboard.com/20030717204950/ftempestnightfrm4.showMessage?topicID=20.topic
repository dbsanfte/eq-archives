TESHIA'S GUIDE TO KEEP DOOR REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE <br>
================================================== <br>
<br>
BEFORE WE START, LET'S TALK ABOUT WOOD <br>
<br>
Stacks of wood come in a stacks of 20 from the vendor when you buy them. I'll use 20 as a standard in this FAQ, but it is possible to stack wood in your inventory to a maximum of 100 per stack. Because wood weighs so much, it's a bad idea to do this. The reason is, if you want to give extra wood to people, you want to make sure they can carry it first. If they can't afford to hold 100 wood (25 pounds) then you're in trouble. Wood can be stacked, but it cannot be un-stacked. <br>
<br>
HOW TO DO IT <br>
<br>
You need to be a woodworker. I'm not sure how high, but you need to be one. 500 is recommended though. A 500 woodworker can perform actions that are connected to level 8 doors (the highest) but with some difficulty. You also need wood - lots of it. The command to repair is &quot;/repair&quot; with the door targetted. For upgrade it's &quot;/upgrade&quot;. <br>
<br>
I NEED WOOD, FAST. WHERE IS IT? <br>
<br>
You can buy wood in Camelot, but the ideal place to buy wood is probably either Cornwall Station or Caer Benowyc (our siege fort in Hadrian's Wall). These two locations have the higher grade woods which include: Runewood, Stonewood, and Ebonwood. Camelot, Cornwall, and Benowyc all sell the other types, which are: Rowan (crap), Elm, Oak, Ironwood, and Heartwood. For this reason, amongst others, you really don't want Benowyc to fall into enemy hands. It's the closest wood supply you have to the rest of your keeps. This is where everybody will go to get wood to repair/upgrade doors during attacks. You cannot buy wood at any of the other forts in the Albion frontier. They sell either poisons or arrows, but wood only can come from Benowyc. <br>
<br>
WEIGHT VS COST <br>
<br>
Wood is expensive, but more importantly, heavier than a fat assed troll on an eating binge. A stack of 20 wood (any type) weighs 5 pounds. A couple stacks of wood on a person easily will bring you over weight. For example, I have a weight limit of 88 and with my armor, I'm at 29/88. That means I can carry 12 piles of 20 wood before I'm at 88/88. This isn't a lot of wood for high level repair/upgrade, which is why you want to consider cost. The more expensive the wood, the more units you get out of it, meaning the more effect is has on a door. If you bring 12 stacks of 20 Rowan wood, for example, you'll get a door upgraded to level 2 maybe, but that's it. Not every effective. If you bring 12 stacks of 20 Ebonwood, you can upgrade a door to level 5 and still have some left over. The price difference is large though. If you're short on people to carry the wood, go with price, but if not, go for Heartwood every time. Heartwood is probably the best all around wood to buy and strikes a good balance between the high grade and low grade woods. For high level work (doors 5 and up), stick with Ebonwood. <br>
<br>
WOOD COST AND HOW MANY &quot;UNITS&quot; IT IS <br>
<br>
The prices on wood per stack of 20: <br>
- Rowan (cheap, but crap) (Benowyc / Cornwall / Camelot) <br>
- Elm (cheap) (Benowyc / Cornwall / Camelot) <br>
- Oak (0.5 gold) (Benowyc / Cornwall / Camelot) <br>
- Ironwood (1.5 gold) (Benowyc / Cornwall / Camelot) <br>
- Heartwood (4.3 gold) (Benowyc / Cornwall / Camelot) <br>
- Runewood (8 gold) (Benowyc and Cornwall only) <br>
- Stonewood (12 gold) (Benowyc and Cornwall only) <br>
- Ebonwood (19 gold) (Benowyc and Cornwall only) <br>
When you &quot;/upgrade&quot; on a door, it'll tell you how much wood units you need (&quot;/repair&quot; does not do this), assuming you have no wood on you. Otherwise, it will use the wood for your command if you have enough. A wood &quot;unit&quot; is a unit of measurement specific to upgrading and repairing. 20 wood units are NOT 20 pieces of wood. It's much more complex than that. Different types of wood represent different units of wood. Here's a list breaking down wood vs. unit amounts: <br>
- Rowan (20 wood (1 stack) = 20 units) (1 x 20 wood = unit amount) <br>
- Elm (20 wood (1 stack) = 80 units) (4 x 20 wood = unit amount) <br>
- Oak (20 wood (1 stack) = 160 units) (8 x 20 wood = unit amount) <br>
- Ironwood (20 wood (1 stack) = 320 units) (16 x 20 wood = unit amount) <br>
- Heartwood (20 wood (1 stack) = 640 units) (32 x 20 wood = unit amount) <br>
- Runewood (20 wood (1 stack) = 810 units) (48 x 20 wood = unit amount) <br>
- Stonewood (20 wood (1 stack) = 1200 units) (60 x 20 wood = unit amount) <br>
- Ebonwood (20 wood (1 stack) = 1600 units) (80 x 20 wood = unit amount) <br>
So as you can see, there's a multiplier involved with wood and how many units it produces. They generally go 1, 4, 8, 16, and then 32 at Heartwood and then they stop doubling when you get to Runewood. This is because Runewood and the woods above it were introduced in a patch that added wood types and they decided to change the multipliers before they got too high. For this reason, Heartwood is the best all around wood to buy. Either Heartwood, Runewood, or Ebonwood if you've got boatloads of cash to throw around. <br>
<br>
REPAIRING <br>
<br>
Repairing can be done by walking up to a door, targeting it, and typing &quot;/repair&quot;. You need to have wood on you to repair it. The higher the level of the door, the higher your fletching skill needs to be. If you get failures, keep trying, you might pull it off eventually, you won't waste any of the wood. If the door is at full health, it won't let you repair it. If it isn't, it'll restore about 15% of the door health every time you do it. Repair isn't expensive at the lower levels but it is later on. Here are the costs of one /repair per level of door, including aproximate amounts in stacks of average types of wood used (average being heartwood or ebonwood, in my opinion). When talking about stacks in the list below, I'm referring to a stack of 20 pieces of wood. I could be wrong on some of the math for pieces of wood per repair on the first few door levels - it's hard to work out or tell accurately unless you do it. <br>
- Level 1 door (aprox. 15 units) (1 heartwood piece / 1 ebonwood piece) <br>
- Level 2 door (aprox. 80 units) (3 heartwood pieces / 2 ebonwood pieces) <br>
- Level 3 door (440 units) (14 heartwood pieces / 6 ebonwood pieces) <br>
- Level 4 door (1760 units) (110 heartwood pieces / 22 ebonwood pieces) <br>
- Level 5 door (5280 units) (9 heartwood stacks / 4 ebonwood stacks) <br>
- Level 6 door (14080 units) (22 heartwood stacks / 9 ebonwood stacks) <br>
- Level 7 door (26400 units) (42 heartwood stacks / 17 ebonwood stacks) <br>
- Level 8 door (39600 units) (62 heartwood stacks / 25 ebonwood stacks) <br>
As you can see, it only costs a few gold to repair a level 3 door once, but it costs a hell of a lot more to repair a high level door, so don't even bother doing that. You reasoning for upgrading to high level doors is to give your realm time to respond to an attack on your keep. Hopefully it will give you the time you need to get to that keep and rescue it. <br>
<br>
REPAIRING DURING RAIDS <br>
<br>
If the door being attacked is outside and it's being attacked, stand outside, flat against the wall to either side of the door to perform your repair. However, if you are a stealth class, keep in mind that this WILL bring you out of stealth. If you're repairing the one inside, again, don't stand at the door. Stand off to the side, just around the corner of the door. This way, archers can't target you from outside very easily and you might avoid AE better. If the attackers are using ballistas, you might be screwed. They have a nasty AE when they hit the doors that tends to injure people trying to repair the doors. Keep in mind that if you are stealthed, &quot;/repair&quot; will bring you out of stealth! This makes repairing doors on the outside of a keep while they're being attacked, VERY dangerous. This is also why you generally only upgrade the outer doors to keeps. Inner doors left at level 1 can be repaired quite quickly with little risk and at a very cheap cost. <br>
<br>
UPGRADING <br>
<br>
To upgrade a door, first, stand by it and type &quot;/upgrade&quot;. That will tell you what level the door is currently at. Then choose your upgrade accordingly. You cannot downgrade doors, only improve them. Generally speaking, you want to only upgrade the outer doors of keeps. The reason why is explained above at the end of the section on &quot;repairing during raids&quot;. Generally speaking, it is cheapest to upgrade in stages (ie. 1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc. rather than 1 to 8 ) . However, the wood is very heavy. If you have a lot of money and people with you, you can do this with something high level, like ebonwood. There are different pricing schemes for upgrading doors for each level of door type. I'll list the level you're upgrading to, it's cost in units, then in square brackets, the aproximate amounts in stacks of 20 it will take to perform this upgrade for Heartwood / Runewood / Stonewood / Ebonwood. <br>

The higher your woodworking skill, the better your chance at performing high level door upgrades. My woodworking skill is somewhere just over 500 and I can upgrade doors to level 8, but it usually takes several attempts before it works. You should also know that upgrading doors does not bring them to full health. If you have a full health door that's level 2 and you upgrade it to level 4, it will appear to have been damaged and will have something like 90% of it's actual life. As the upgrades increase, the damage appears to get worse. A door upgraded from level 1 to level 7 appears to have 70% of it's health. The natural regeneration on doors is quite slow, but it's the best way to let these doors get back to full health. Repairing them up to full would cost almost as much as it did to upgrade the door in the first place. If you must upgrade the inner door of your keep, go low, something around level 4, but no higher. It will cost too much to repair if you go too high. <br>
<br>
COST EFFECTIVE UPGRADES VS WEIGHT EFFECTIVE UPGRADES <br>
<br>
Upgrading a level 1 door to level 8, in [ Heartwood / Ebonwood ] prices out in gold as follows: Level 2 [1.5/2.7], Level 3 [6/11], Level 4 [18/32], Level 5 [48/84], Level 6 [87/156], Level 7 [133/235], Level 8 [200/366]. This is assuming you do a direct upgrade and do not stagger your upgrades. Upgrading in one fell swoop from level 1 to level 8 is NOT the most cost effective way to upgrade. A direct upgrade from 1 to 8 costs anywhere between 200 to 366 gold if you're using Heartwood through to Ebonwood. If you were to stagger this every level (eg. &quot;/upgrade 2&quot;, then &quot;/upgrade 3&quot;, &quot;/upgrade 4&quot;, etc. until you reach level 8 ), you would spend aproximately 37% LESS more money doing the upgrades in stages (that's about 146 gold (Heartwood) or 245 gold (Ebonwood)). <br>
<br>
SEIGE PART RETREIVAL TEAM TACTICS <br>
<br>
The best way to upgrade a door from level 1 to level 8 is to bring about 5 people, including the upgrader. Each can carry about 40 pounds (8 piles of 20 boards) of Ebonwood if their inventory is relatively empty. This will suffice for the 195 pounds (39 stacks) of wood needed for this massive upgrade. If you bring a cleric and tanks, the cleric can buff up the tanks with strength buffs, you can carry more, and bring less people. Bring a mistrel, and you'll move faster too, which is even better. The ideal team for siege part retreival from Caer Benowyc is a Minstrel with very fast run speed, a cleric, and 6 tanks. You can carry a LOT of stuff this way. <br>
<br>
VENDORS AT CAER BENOWYC <br>
<br>
When Benowyc falls under enemy control and you take it back by force, you'll notice it takes some time for the guards to spawn. This is true of the vendors inside as well. There are three. The last to spawn has seige engine parts. Luckily, the wood vendor spawns quickly. I'm not sure how long you have to wait, but it's within 30 minutes that the first two vendors spawn and he's one of them. He's at the base of the stone stairs, just behind them. <br>
<br>
STOPPING THE ENEMY FROM REPAIRING THEIR DOORS <br>
<br>
Use ballistas. They fire slow but they can attack the doors of the keep you're taking back and they also have an AE damage effect that takes out repair workers around the door as well as hurting the door without hurting people from your own realm that are beating on the door. <br>
<br>
A DISCLAIMER ABOUT MY PHAT MATH SKILLS <br>
<br>
During this FAQ, I had to do some calculations to determine some of the figures you see above. It may be off, but my guess is it's pretty much solid. What I know for certain are the following: <br>
- the amount of wood units needed for every type of upgrade <br>
- wood pricing and weight <br>
What I could be wrong about (ie. things I had to calculate) are the following: <br>
- amounts of stacks of 20 wood needed to perform a certain upgrade / repair <br>
- amount of wood units needed for different types of door repair <br>
