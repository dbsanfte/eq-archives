His parents’ last words still rang in his head “Why can’t you be a respectable wizard like your father, or a theurgist like your Uncle Winfred?” He had tried, but the way of the elementalist was just not for him. He preferred a subtler approach to life. While the other children of Avalon burned or bashed the rodents found in the woods near town, he preferred to suck the life out of them. He would drain their life force and feel the rush as it replenished his own life. It was not flashy, but it was effective. Later in school, he learned to play tricks on their minds, to make them think they were weak, to sap their energy, in short, he became a magician. Then the day of choosing came upon him.<br><br>“So Winin,” his instructor asked, “what shall it be? Will you join the Academy or will you go to the Guild of Shadows?”<br><br>“How can I choose? What will I learn if I go to one or the other?”<br><br>“Cabalists of the Guild of Shadows excel at fashioning simulacrum to do their bidding. It is a most unnatural thing, but in this time of war, even the cabalists are tolerated in open society. Sorcerers of the Academy are accepted, but they are still mistrusted and feared by the common folk because they can hold power over people’s minds.”<br><br>“Mind control? Do continue.”<br><br>“Ah, I see you are intrigued. There is much you could learn at the Academy.”<br><br>“Indeed.”<br><br>“Sorcerers can bend a humanoid’s will to their own and force them to act as servants. They will do anything the master wishes and will even die to protect the master. Sorcerers also have the ability to render an opponent helpless as a baby or mesmerize it and turn it into a drooling idiot that will stand and do nothing. Their knowledge of the mind also allows them to do great damage by jolting the minds of their enemies.”<br><br>“I have no interest in fashioning artificial people, and I care not what others think of me. Nay, I shall travel to the great Academy in Camelot and become a Sorcerer!”<br><br>And so Winin the Magician became Winin the Sorcerer. As a young sorcerer, he was shunned by other adventurers. However, with a servant made faithful by his powerful mind magic, Winin was able to practice his dark arts and grow in power.  One eve, while sitting by the river resting after a fight, he was startled by the appearance of an old man in a robe.<br><br>“Young Winin, I have been watching you.”<br><br>“Indeed, and who are you old man?”<br><br>“I am a Keeper, that is enough.”<br><br>“A keeper of what? Secrets?”<br><br>“The Keepers are an ancient Order. We are the sacred Keepers of the Sangreal, and have been charged with its preservation for ages.”<br><br>“And what is the Sangreal?”<br><br>“The Sangreal is a most holy artifact. It has the power to heal, the power to protect, and the power to punish the unholy. In these times, it is called the Holy Grail.”<br><br>“Indeed, and why have you been watching me?”<br><br>“The Sangreal has become lost, and our order is too small to go searching for it. I have been sent out to find new recruits. You seem to have great potential, but you are unfocused. Becoming a Keeper would give direction to your life, it would allow you to gain a purpose as well as power. There are other young adventurers like yourself who are recruits. Together you can surmount obstacles that would be impossible alone. After you become a recruit, in time, if you prove yourself worthy, you will become a full Keeper. A few of the Keepers who excel will be promoted to Knights and higher, but that will be much father in the future when you have grown in power. As you are promoted, you will be allowed to learn more of the secrets of our long forgotten order. For now, you know all you need know. Will you join our cause?”<br><br>Winin pondered the offer. While he was strong enough to adventure on his own, he easily grew bored. Perhaps joining this order would give him a chance to learn new things he couldn’t on his own. And certainly the chance to learn more of this “Sangreal” caught his interest. The pursuit of knowledge is what drove him to get this far in life, he could not pass up this opportunity.<br><br>“I think I will join. Let us see if we can find this “Sangreal” of yours.”<br><br>And so Winin the Sorcerer became a Keeper and began his long quest.<br> <p>Winin the Sorcerer of Forgotten Grail Keepers(TM) on Guinevere<BR>Craewyn the Ranger of Dei Gratia on Palomides<BR>Winin the Bard of Shining Path on The Tribunal</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub31.ezboard.com/uwinin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winin</A> at: 1/29/02 11:02:26 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm14.showPrevMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm14.showNextMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm14.emailToFriend?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm14.threadControl?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm14.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm14.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub31.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm8">General Discusssion<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm19">The Sword and Key<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm6">Marketplace<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm7">Workshop<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm13">Quests<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm18">Strategy and Tips<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm14">Roster<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm9">Access Requests<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm12">Potential Recruits<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm20">Promotions<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm10">Private Discussion<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm11">Officer Discussion<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm15">General Discussion Archive<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm16">Private Discussion Archive</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/bforgottengrailkeepers>Forgotten Grail Keepers</a><font color=#993300> -
