We endevoured to eliminate them but the evil [Magic of this land] brought them back to haunt us and prey on the living. Simple folk in life these Ghosts of Farmers and town folks are still worthy apponents for a solo veteran of 35 seasons.<br><br>Our attention was then drawn to a new enimy of the land, A [Moorlich]. We were unable to accurately judge it's strength. So I broke away from the party to see if it was prone to fire. ot wanted to bring doom upon us I attacked this fiend alone. It was and is affect by my fire. And for a creature of it's size and ability did not depart me with one blow. His use of Poison at range was disconcerting and I endevoured to run from him.<br><br>A short while later after becoming readjusted to the land of the living. We enacted a plan to attack the fiend in force. Aruth let loose and his arrow flew true, the beast was upon us quickly for it's size gave it great spead. Swords flashed, strengthened with the power of earth, powered by muscles and skill bless by the lord himself. Fire and spells bloomed around the demon and early signs showed that victory was assured. Then the true evil power of the beast manifested itself. In a [glimmering light of Evil power], Aruth was struck down going from nearly no wounds to death, then the demon undead used this same power to strike at Gwalchgwynn alas he met the same fate. Galen Continued to fight bravely with sword and sound inflicting great wounds upon this foul creature, Zannah continued to strike at him with divine might, but as I let loose with one more spell of fire I knew my fate was sealed and joined my companions. But our deaths were not without cost. For our battle had weakend the shell of it's power. Zannah let loose with a final Spell of Divine power as Galen Pierced it's dark soul droping it to the ground. It was a valient fight and information was gathered, but at a dear cost.<br><br>It was also disheartening to find that our fight only fread a spot for another Lich to enter our realm in its place. It was with some sadness that we left that place to search more of the area.<br><br>The familiar Dunters where still roaming around we also noticed one of renown named [Colk], We dispatched them with little effort. <br><br>Another new menace of large lizards was also to be found near them. Perhaps menace is to strong a word. They are strong but were not above the collective might of our party. But they seemed somewhat complacent with life, as stupid beasts are oft to do, and would not attack unless provoked. We engadged a few of this simple creatures as well and judged there strength to be similar to that of there cousins the Cornwall Drakes.<br><br>We also encountered a small contigency of ghosts, lead by what appeared to be a clergyman. We showed them that there is only one true god in Albion. And then moved along the path.<br><br>It was here that we encountered another new enimy of the realm a [Lesser Talimon] from the reports we had heard. Dressed in flate black armor they would be a terrible mennace to happen upon in the night. We were unable to accurately judge the strength of this new mennace as well. He was a tough fight for our party but in the end we did dispatch him without loss of life on our part. Looking down the path to the south west we noticed that these demons were hiding on both sides of the road behind large rock outcroppings.<br><br>We explored little more before returning to Cornwall.<br><br>Other items of note:<br><br>We encountered and slew a few giants of cornwall. looking akin to giant Bandits of equal strength to that of the cornwall drake.<br><br>We avenged an early expidition to Cornwall / Lyonesse by dispatching the Hamadyriad of some renoun named [Yadnik].  A Few of us found great personal pleasure in this.<br><br>We were then joined by Yumping Yuber, Logas and for a brief time the Thurg Eett. By this time we felt content to try and rid the land of Drakes, Giants, and Greater Boogies.<br><br>We also dispatched what appeared to be their leader [Soth].<br><br>Sorry for the length of this letter but perhaps it's information could be of use to the kingdom.<br><br>Your Loyal Servant<br><br>M.<br>FGK<br>Knight Errant<br>Wizard of Albion<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub31.ezboard.com/uwinin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#993300>(12/21/01 8:55:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Report From Lyonesse</span><hr size=1> Huzzah! <p>Winin the Sorcerer of Forgotten Grail Keepers(TM) on Guinevere<BR>Craewyn the Ranger of Dei Gratia on Palomides<BR>Winin the Bard of Shining Path on The Tribunal</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=149.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=149.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=149.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm8.threadControl?topicID=149.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=149.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/fforgottengrailkeepersfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=149.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub31.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm8">General Discusssion<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm19">The Sword and Key<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm6">Marketplace<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm7">Workshop<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm13">Quests<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm18">Strategy and Tips<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm14">Roster<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm9">Access Requests<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm12">Potential Recruits<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm20">Promotions<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm10">Private Discussion<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm11">Officer Discussion<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm15">General Discussion Archive<option value="forgottengrailkeepersfrm16">Private Discussion Archive</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/bforgottengrailkeepers>Forgotten Grail Keepers</a><font color=#993300> -
