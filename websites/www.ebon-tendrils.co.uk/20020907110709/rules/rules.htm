Based on feedback, local knowledge and research the guild will operate 2 weekly incursions into places for our members enjoyment. These will be to show people new zones, experience, loot and to continue to build guild comradeship and effectiveness. The guildmaster will select the locations of these raids based on the above. <br>
<br>
Monday nights at 1900 GMT will be for low levels (exact details to be specified). <br>
<br>
Wednesdays for Mid levels (exact details to be specified). </p>
