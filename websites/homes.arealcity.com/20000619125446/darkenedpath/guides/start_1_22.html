        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">As a Shadow Knight, you are part Warrior and part Necromancer. Most people
        say 1/4th Necro and 3/4th Warrior, but this varies between the races. Obviously, Humans
        and Dark Elves with their lower strength will try to make up for it with their greater
        mana. Without getting into a debate about the best race for a Shadow Knight, I will
        present each level of spells through 22 from my 26th level Dark Elf Xilith&#146;s point of
        view. </p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#669933"><b>Rank 1 &#150; Level 9 (mostly level 1
        Necro spells)</b></font></p>
        <p align="left">Finally, you have spells! One nice thing about hybrids is the spells are
        always cheap relative to a caster. You must remember to train in your magic skills. There
        are 5 different schools of magic: Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration, Divination, and
        Evocation. In addition, you should train in Channeling, which will allow you to cast
        faster, and resist interruption. This is extremely important to an SK since they almost
        always cast in combat and get hit in the middle. At level 26 I am able to recover quite
        often and get that spell off. At this rank, you only get Alteration, Conjuration, and
        Divination spells, so you might consider waiting to train Abjuration and Evocation (First
        Evocation spell is at 22nd level &#150; Ward Undead). After you have trained in the
        magical arts, you must purchase your spells and scribe them. Since you don&#146;t yet have
        Meditate, this can be a tedious process, but it will get better at 12th level. At this
        level, you won&#146;t find magic to be of that much assistance, but you will get used to
        having 10 higher strength constantly.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Disease Cloud:</font></b> Diseases the target and
        hits for 5 damage. The best use I have found for this spell is that at lower levels it can
        be quite a taunt. I found monsters would stay on me more and off my wizard if I threw a
        disease in between swings every now and then. I still have it memorized, and use it on
        really long fights and while kiting to prevent mobs from healing. </p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Invisibility to Undead:</font></b> At this level,
        only useful to avoid wandering undead, can make the run up from South Ro much easier. In a
        few levels, it is really good in Befallen, and again later when pulling from the house in
        Unrest. I don&#146;t regularly keep it memorized unless I&#146;m in Unrest. Remember, you
        can cast this one on others too. Mana cost is really high for this level.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Leering Corpse:</font></b> Your first pet, it
        should be level 4+. Pets are the subject of much debate for SK&#146;s. I&#146;m doing an
        article on using pets soon as well. I don&#146;t remember using my pet much at this level.
        Troll and Ogre SK&#146;s may not be able to summon a pet when they first get this spell
        due to the high mana cost.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Locate Corpse: </font></b>This will target the
        nearest corpse, and turn you towards it. If you target a player, it will turn you towards
        their corpse and target it. Obvious use is to find your corpse, or if it&#146;s not lost,
        to plot a straight line to it. Another use is when a monster dies inside a tree or wall.
        Clear your target and cast this spell, and it will target the corpse. Then use the /loot
        command to loot it.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Sense the Dead:</font></b> Targets the nearest
        undead, and turns you toward it. This can be a problem in zones with a lot of SK&#146;s
        and Necro&#146;s, such as Nektrulos, as it will target pets as well. Useful at this level
        to find things to fight. Might allow to find pet if pet is targeted</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Siphon Strength:</font></b> Steals 10 strength
        from target and gives it to you. I have had this spell memmed ever since I bought it, and
        rely on it to remain unencumbered (weak DE remember?), and to get a little extra damage.
        Low mana cost, so you can cast it on everything you fight as a cheap debuff, or to pull.
        In my eyes, one of our best spells.</p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#669933"><b>Rank 2 &#150; Level 15 (mostly level 4
        Necro spells)</b></font></p>
        <p align="left">At this level, you will see your spells start to make a larger difference
        in the way you play, and you will find yourself much more effective at each new rank. If
        you haven&#146;t already, train in Abjuration for Numb the Dead and Endure Cold.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Bone Walk:</font></b> A new pet, about level 8.
        Much more useful than the last one. Read my guide on pets for some tips at this level.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Clinging Darkness: </font></b>The darkness line
        is one of our best set of spells. I always had it memorized until I got Engulfing Darkness
        at level 22. Although not much damage (25-30 points), it will slow the mob down
        considerably, allowing you to run, or prevent them from running. A great spell to pull
        with, and/or cast on a monster before it will run. A mob near death will turn its back to
        you and stand there, waiting for you to finish it off. I love that, and my party too.
        After the last patch, however, it will not stack with root, so coordinate with your
        rooters, as this is better in my opinion, and saves them some mana. See Fear below for
        some interesting combos.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Endure Cold:</font></b> Useful when fighting
        shamen such as orcs, goblins, and gnolls in High Pass, or in Befallen to help against Ice
        Boned Skeletons. Also useful later on when fighting higher wizzes that use cold based
        attacks. You can keep your group buffed with this to save a shaman or other buffer some
        mana.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Fear:</font></b> This spell has a few uses, and
        can get you into trouble as well. You can cast it on a mob in a camp to pull the others,
        and not have to fight him until he returns. You can also slow a mob with a darkness spell,
        and then fear it while you and your pet or party beat on it. I used this to solo blues in
        South Karanas a little after 22nd level with Engulfing Darkness. You have to watch out,
        though, because feared monsters can and will bring back friends when it wears off. Also
        great in PvP or duels, either using the above tactic or, in dangerous zones, to get them
        killed by falling or lava. Another use is to fear something to let you run away from it.
        Due to the long casting time, difficult to get off while getting hit. I usually pull with
        darkness, then send my pet to intercept, and cast fear while he takes a few hits.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Mend Bones: </font></b>You can heal your pet, or
        some other Necro/SK&#146;s pet with this. Doesn&#146;t heal very much, though, but I
        generally have enough mana to burn as a DE. I used this in Oasis at levels 15-17 to let my
        pet tank while I stepped in to take swings with a high damage, high delay weapon (Shiny
        Brass Halberd I believe) Read my pet guide for more info on this.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Numb the Dead: </font></b>Used like lull, but
        undead. Useful for pulling part of an undead camp. I only used this while camping
        skeletons in Rathe Mts, but might be useful to get you out of Befallen or Unrest as well.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Shadow Step:</font></b> This spell casts really,
        really fast, maybe in a sec. Useful in a duel or PvP to confuse your advisary or to get a
        headstart on a mob/player while fleeing. It can disorient you, too, so watch out.</p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000033"><b>Rank 3 &#150; Level 22 (mostly level 8
        Necro Spells)</b></font></p>
        <p align="left">This is a good time for SK&#146;s. You&#146;ve just had your damage cap
        removed, an improved regeneration rate, and now have double attack. By now you have a good
        weapon, and your pet can no longer hold a monsters attention if you are in melee with it..
        The best spell at this level is Engulfing Darkness, and improvement to Clinging Darkness
        that will dish out about 100 points of damage in addition to the slowing effect
        you&#146;ve come to love. You will need to train Evocation if you haven&#146;t yet, and
        will find it hard to improve since you have just got your first Evoc spell, Ward Undead.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Convoke Shadow:</font></b> About level 12 pet. It
        can now dish out more damage, but is only good for a few hits, so don&#146;t let it tank
        except to get off a spell. Still, pets can be a good DOT. Useful for the darkness/fear
        combo described above.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Dark Empathy:</font></b> Trades about 20 hp from
        yourself to the target. For Trolls this can be really useful to even out the hit points of
        the tanks. At this level, you won&#146;t save many lives with it, so mainly useful after
        combat. One trick, if you are already hurt to or below half and can bandage well, is to
        cast on other wounded player(s) that are above half and then bandage yourself. Useful if
        you can&#146;t rest long, and the other player can tank the next fight since you will be
        left at half.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Deadeye: </font></b>See invisible. Great on PvP
        servers to avoid a surprise, or to save a mage casting see invis on you before following
        him invisibly.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Engulfing Darkness: </font></b>Did I mention I
        love this line of spells? Better damage, but used the same. Good for about 100 points. You
        can just about kite with this on blues.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Spook the Dead:</font></b> Makes undead run away.
        I have never used this spell, but your mileage may vary.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Vampiric Embrace: </font></b>Another point of
        argument. Most likely due to the fact that often SK&#146;s use slow 2H slashing weapons
        that don&#146;t give much of a chance to do the embrace. Also, has a short duration (about
        the length of an average fight). At level 22 it will steal 13 health, and it goes up one
        point for every two levels. A high DEX will help it to go off more in combat. I&#146;ve
        had it go off 4 times in a fight, and I&#146;ve had it go off none, but it&#146;s better
        than nothing, so I try to cast before a pull or respawn. I&#146;d be interested in hearing
        from someone using a really low delay weapon to see how often they get it to work.
        Contrary to what Necro&#146;s may tell you, this spell HAS been changed to work with or
        without a weapon.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333366">Ward Undead:</font><font color="#99CC66"> </font></b>Does
        about 41 damage to undead. Not very much you say? But if you use a high delay weapon like
        I do, you can cast in between swings and it starts stacking up. You can also fall back and
        attack from afar with this if you get seriously hurt. Here&#146;s a trick to get your
        Evocation up to par&#133; Summon a pet, target it, and cast this repeatedly. You will
        fizzle a lot at first, but you will improve, even though your pet is unaffected. I did
        this while camping a slow spawn and got it up 60 points in one night.</p>
