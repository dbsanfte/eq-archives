<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	channel now moderated
<br><b>&lt;[GSI]hardcore_pawn&gt;</b>	Please welcome the guys from SOE and Verant to this special EverQuest-based chat!!!
<br><b>&lt;[GSI]hardcore_pawn&gt;</b>	Guys, please take a second to intro yourselves, your title and anything else you'd like to include!
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Hello all.  I'm Gordon Wrinn, Associate Producer of the EQLive team and the Scars of Velious.  Thanks for coming!
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	John Capozzi, Assoc. Game Designer, EQLive/Scars of Velious.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	Hello everyone.  I'm Alan 'Absor' VanCouvering.  I'm the Community Relations Manager for EverQuest.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Mrylokar&gt;</b>	Lawrence Poe, Assoc. Game Designer on EQLive/Scars of Velious. Content, Pathing, Spell Guy
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kayvman&gt;</b>	Greetings, I am Kayvan Simantob. Associate game designer for EQLive and scars of Velious. I'm fairly new to the team =)
<br><b>&lt;[GSI]hardcore_pawn&gt;</b>	thanks very much guys... the questions are coming...
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*MiddleFinger* Can any of the EQ staffers tell us what all the new art they have been loading is going to be used for? :)
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	The new art that we were loading the past weak was for some prizes given out at the gathering in Baltimore.  We didn't want to be that specific at the time, lest people jump into the emulator to capture and distribute shots and ruin teh surprise :)  Next question please.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	I think Gordon has this one
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	er, week.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*ChubbyNinja* will they be offering a package for sale that includes EQ, Velious AND Kunark?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	That's really in the hands of our marketing department, so we're unable to comment on it really.  Next question....
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*RepeateR* is a fletching upgrade still planned? can i get a time estimate if so?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	We lost Yak in Baltimore, so Mrylokar is going to take this one :)
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Actually, we found him, but he's not sober yet, so...
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	That's it... start rumors...
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Please excuse the mundane chatter between answers of substance :)
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Mrylokar&gt;</b>	Yes there is a Fletching upgrade in the works. Yakatizma is currently out of town, but he will resume working on it as soon as he returns. I'm pretty sure he said he was close to finished with some new things for the skill. Next Question please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*dnelson* What are they going to do about the epic quest items on planar gods and mobs when planes on our server are booked months in advance and most guilds with members over 55 do not go or book anymore?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Shhhh... The mighty Kendrick is about to speak....
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	We're revamping many of the Epic Quests in the near future to eliminate some of these bottlenecks..

	<br><br>[SOE]Abashi doesn't think he's done yet<br>

<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	next question
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*[GSI]Hellchick* Camping items seems to have taken some of the fun of surprise and exploration out of EQ for me. How do you guys feel about item camping?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	er, maybe he is :)
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	...
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	How we feel about camping is secondary to how you feel about it.  If you don't like it, don't do it.  Both Kunark and Velious provides many opportunities for those who don't like to camp through random contextual drops, that being random drops that are meaningful within the presented context.  Next question please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Aracnakat* Bunny Hats: Considering the overwhelming excitement over this "hoax" item .. will Verant consider inserting a tailor made bunny hat?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Lol...bunnies are taking over the world
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Yeah, we'll get right on it :)  next question please.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Now, Llama hats, maybe
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Ra`_Ammnontet* Are there any plans to add new zones to any of the existing continents?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Mrylokar&gt;</b>	I'd wear a Llama hat!
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Yes, we have two new zones planned, one is nearing completion, the other is in progress...The Warrens and Stonebrunt Mountains, both on Odus
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	next question
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*[GSN]Epic* It has been said that after finishing these balancing changes, the EQ team will continue to develop content. Does this mean that another expansion is on the horizon? What content changes are you planning to make for the future?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	We could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	That would at least allow us to put off answering until you respawned...
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Seriously though.... I'll not rule out a new expansion as it would be too soon to talk about anything of that nature.  As for new content, the two new zones are only part of it.   We have plans for new quests, and completely new classes (types) of items.  Next question.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*SITHH_VZ* PVP teams Vallon Zek Anything done to Stop Crossteaming?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	We could tell you, and we could kill you, since you are red...;)  Just kidding, Alan has an answer coming up

	<br><br>[SOE]Abashi hands Mavis Beacon Typing Tutor to Absor<br>

<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	We understand that this is a delicate situation.  It's certainly on my list of things to look into, but it's going to have to wait a while.  Sorry.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	Next please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Faenyar* a question about enchanters and balancing... Absor made mention that they were going to "look into" why enchanters were considered required for Kunark and "fix this". Can you elaborate? Rumor has it that you're going to nerf the effectiveness of mezzes, or otherwise make us less effective and this has us quite concerned.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Assist Absor!
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	.msg Absor I thought mezzes were already useless???
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	oops
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	rofl
<br><b>&lt;[GSI]hardcore_pawn&gt;</b>	nice :P
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	Nothing like nerfing mezzes has really come up, I'm not sure where that idea came from.  Honestly, I'm still looking for a good idea to help out enchanters in the big raids.  And don't worry, we'll be letting you know what changes we have in mind.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	Next please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Bobba-feTT* what is in the works for Verant? when will the Star wars rpg be available?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Well, as you know Star Wars is in the works, along with Planetside and Sovereign, but we're not up to date on their release schedules.  Check their respective websites at www.station.sony.com for info as it is released.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	next question please
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*dnelson* I play a wizard and Velious mobs have too many hp, very little exp and few drops to speak of for my class. I have become much less effective. Why should I go to Velious?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Answer coming up
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Mrylokar&gt;</b>	We are currently looking into ways to make the casting classes more useful in the epic encounters. I cannot really comment on what types of changes we are looking into, but I can tell you we have taken all of the players suggestions and looked through them to try to find a good solution. Next Question please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*[GSI]hardcore_pawn* are you getting positive feedback about the recent XP changes?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	All the feedback has been positive. And we've had plenty of nice comments.  Next question please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Eldamus* here is a question for Absor/Abashi =), what will possibly become of Odus in the near future. As in what plans do you have on changing it?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	We caught this one above when talking about the two new Odus zones planned.  Next question please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Popletmagi* What are the current plans for EQ2? When? Where?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	EQ what?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	What Kendrick said.  Considering the success of EQ it certainly makes sense that we'd evaluate opportunities for a sequel, but I really don't' have any information of that type to release.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	next question please
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*SITHH_VZ* anything to Increase the effectiveness of Melees in PVP.. maybe giving a Larger Attack Radius to Certain classes IE. warrior when attacking Players?..
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	We try to stay away from making PvP-specific changes to gameplay where avoidable.  As it is, melee attacks in PvP are already stronger than they should be given the fact that they are meant to take on critters with much higher hitpoints.  As it is currently, melee players are really only vulnerable when not in a group, which melds nicely with their PvE play style.  So to answer your question, nothing planned.  Next question please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Zerin* How do you plan to deal with the issue involving wizards and their inability to really effect 'uber' mobs in Velious, Absor mentioned -something- would be done, but so far hasn't said exactly what that is. On another issue: When will tinkering be addressed? As it stands, you invest a TON of money for little return.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Wizards don't have an inability to affect uber mobs in Velious.  Their Lure spells generally aren't completely resisted by anything, and they are the only ones that have a spell of that type.  As for the ratio of that effect, we currently have something planned.  As for tinkering, Yak is continually looking for new directions to take the trade skills.  Next question please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Faenyar* will we ever see the Erudite cultural tailored silks that have been hinted at? If so, any *rough* estimate at a time frame?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Soon
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Next question
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Wylias_Silvershade* are there any plans to take the Sword of the Gathering graphic and match it with another rare item, one that even players without the time/means to attend real life events can aspire to?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	The guy we'd have to ask about that is out of the office, is what Kendrick is trying to say on the last one :)
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b> No, that will not be done. Next question please.
<br><b>&lt;Cobby&gt;</b> *CherryFlakes* Is there any additional races coming down the line in the near future (i.e. Iksars with Kunark.)? Any chance you could give us a hint?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Nothing of that kind planned in the near term. Next question.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Ra`_Ammnontet* Will there be any major or minor changes in the way PVP loot and faction works? Any PVP changes at all planned?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	Essentially, I have the same answer to this one as the last one.  We don't have any immediate plans to make PvP changes, but we hope to look into it in the future.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	Next please
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Is that your final answer?
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*mortak* Kendrick, how come Kerafyrm goes on a rampage and kills everyone before they are given the chance to loot the 4th warder?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Maybe there's a trick to it..or maybe those warnings given meant something..;)
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Next question
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*gop* What are you feelings on guilds that become power houses, and rule a service as far as abilities?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	On a side note:    It's hailing here.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Mrylokar&gt;</b>	*Sigh* my car :(
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	People have a tendency to group for the sake of power and/or notoriety.  It's happened all throughout history.  Our task is to address it through gameplay where necessary.  We've considered limiting the size of a guild but don't think that would be well-received.  We're listening to everyone's thoughts as they are presented to us, and will probably make decisions from time to time in that regard.  Next Question please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*dnelson* In Velious they added many new textures for armor and have really livened up the atmosphere. Why not robes?!? And why not Pink?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	Hehe!  Sorry, the hail is a distraction for all of us Cali natives.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	We focused on armor for Velious because there was already a large variety of robe colors..we have every intention of doing more robes in the future..and pink?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Heh, that's a subject of great debate around here...Next Question
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*mOoK_* Recently it was stated that Ranger's Offensive skills were raised to the level of Warrior's, when all of the other hybrid's defensive skills were raised, why is that? As if our AC wasn't low enough!
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Rangers are offensive in nature, palys, sks, and bards are defensive in nature.  Those classes were design around that.  We decided to give the classes a bigger piece of their parent for one side of melee.  As for your AC, yes, it's lower.  Try not to get hit :)  Next
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*hcbk69* Are there any plans to increase group size beyond 6 people?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Mrylokar&gt;</b>	It is something we have talked about. We're looking into the possibility, but right now There are no plans to add this. Next Question please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*SITHH_VZ* HORSES!! when are we going to see Horses!!! mawhahww
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	Hmmmm  Horse head hats...
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	You can see horses in several zones.  You just can't ride them :P  And no, no plans along these lines in the foreseeable future.  Next question please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*[GSN]Epic* With all the current upgrades and big decisions the EQ team has had to make, have you found time to get much playing in? =)
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Horsehead on a stick!
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Most of us play daily still
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	And if we're not playing, we think about it...
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Mrylokar&gt;</b>	I play every day.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	I play most nights, actually.  More now than ever.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	I haven't had near as much time as I'd like, but still get in some time once in a while...
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Mrylokar&gt;</b>	One of the joys of having 2 computers at work ^_^
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Rofl... Next question please :)
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*CherryFlakes* Do you feel that EQ caters to the hardcore gamer, those that spend many hours a day in the game? When it takes so much real time to reach the next level or get that cool new item, how could anyone playing EQ casually effectively function in this environment?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	They do it everyday..you just have to change your expectations.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	I am a casual player.  Always have been.  If you play casually, then getting 'stuff' isn't really the focus of the game.  As a casual player myself, I can easily refute the idea that EQ caters to the hardcore gamer, just from my personal experiences.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	More coming from the others on this...
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	We've added a tremendous amount of casual content for Velious and Kunark, and more on the way..it's not all about uber mobs and phat lewt
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Massively multiplayer have always given more benefits to those that play more.  EQ is no different in this regard.  But as for catering, it caters to casual gamers as well, and very well at that.  The only group that feels that they are not getting anywhere is the power gamers who don't have the time to *be* powergamers.  Sooner or later perhaps they'll decide to be casual and enjoy the game as well :)  Nexxt question please.
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*lazarus* Any plans on porting EQ to Linux and MAC OS?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	No plans for other platforms at this time
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Next question
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Aracnakat* Deity Enchanted Jewelry: Why are the stats so drastically different on these items? Wouldn't it have made more sense to make them all about the same? Currently some deities have fantastic jewelry while others have virtually useless jewelry when you consider all the others items available for those slots. (cont..)
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	(...cont) Also, when deciding to create these jewels, why weren't these items tailored more towards clerics, paladins, necromancers & dark knights since these 4 classes must choose the deity per their race?(example: Brell's items vs Innoruuk's items).
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	That's one you'd have to ask Yakitizma, who is on vacation at the moment
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Next Q
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Faenyar* any chance of more job openings? How about for people who *can't* relocate to San Diego?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Mrylokar&gt;</b>	thanks, I clicked on help :P
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Abashi&gt;</b>	Well, we have three studios now, San Diego, Austin, and St. Louis.. But as for off-ite telecommute type of positions, nothing planned at this time.  Next question please.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	I always knew you needed help Mrylokar
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kayvman&gt;</b>	theres no help for you =p
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Radiant_Knight* Are there any plans to implement a variety of "epic" items for each class?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Not that I'm aware of..it's hard enough to balance them as it is, I shudder to think of adding more epics
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	next question
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*trunks* Would you consider giving the stealthy assassins..the Rogues...a Tracking skill? It fits along with the role of the character well and is my 2 cents into the Rogue discussion :)
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	I think it's a very bad idea giving them tracking.  A good rogue hires a bloodhound if he can't find his victim..;)
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Next question
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*[GSI]hardcore_pawn* can I get a free FBSS please?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Sure!  On Fishy Black Squid Shake coming up!
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Next Question
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kayvman&gt;</b>	Yes. Just go to the right place at the right time at the right level and you shall have one.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	That's what I've been drinking?
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Ra`_Ammnontet* Any plans to add more dynamic quests/mobs (ie: Loathsome individuals that were around Qeynos for a while)?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Dynamic quests are an on-going thing, expect the unexpected
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Next?
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*[FI]v0x[GS]* what are your views regarding possible enhancement to the game from the EQ community..we've seen this work very well with online games like quake and UT..will we ever see that happening with EQ?
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Very doubtful we'll add that kind of extensibility to EQ...
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	in return, there is a wealth of things to involve the community at this point
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	We certainly use player ideas when making decisions, though.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	in return, there is a wealth of things to involve the community at this point
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	We certainly use player ideas when making decisions, though.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	I think he was talking about skins and levels
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	I figured that.  :)
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	Next?
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	*Aracnakat* No Question .. Comment: I've been working on the new Velious Quests in EWs and I've got to hand it to the staff that worked on these .. FANTASTIC .. These are some of the best quests in the entire game .. well done and thanks :)
<br><b>&lt;[GSI]hardcore_pawn&gt;</b>	Ok, time's up! We'd really like to thank all the guys for turning up and answering these q's... we know you're very busy people, and keep up the great work on EverQuest!
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Thanks, we'll pass that on to the guy that did that
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	Thanks for taking the time to chat with us! good job!
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Absor&gt;</b>	It was fun.
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	You're welcome
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Mrylokar&gt;</b>	Nice chatting with you guys, How do I whisper to someone btw :P
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Mrylokar&gt;</b>	k thx
<br><b>&lt;[SOE]Kendrick&gt;</b>	Well, first you get to know them..sticking your lips on a strangers ears is a bad idea
<br><b>&lt;[Admin]Cobby&gt;</b>	channel now unmoderated
