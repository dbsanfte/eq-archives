              <blockquote>07/29/01: Veeshans Peak 2 - The big final fight, was 
                the fight against Phara Dar again. Daughter of Jaled Dar and leader 
                of the Ring of Scale. Being a cleric, she isn't that much of an 
                easy fight...but if its easy, its boring. So we had our fun with 
                her, and although she hide her head into the ground we saw her 
                and killed her. So Veeshans Peak was cleared again, this time 
                in only 4.5 hours. Next aim will be, clearing it in less than 
                4 hours!<br>
                <br>
                The casters cheered as we noticed she had again two Robe of the 
                Azure Sky, grats to Sanain and Jowood for their new robes. The 
                Claw of Phara Dar went to master of arms Kerleblanc. Grats to 
                all, and to the guild for another cleared VP! <br>
                <br>
                Veeshans Peak 2 - The Guardian Nexona, who looks a bit like good 
                old Trakanon, fought like him as well. In other words, she fought 
                like a wimp and died fast. /tell Phara Dar Use stronger friends/guardians 
                next time! <br>

                So once again, lewt time...this one had a Howling Cutlass for 
                Jhoira, two Pulsating Gem for Haro and Thorgal and also a Water 
                Sprinkler of Suffering for Anastasia. Grats to the winners and 
                hey....one more dragon to go!<br>
                <br>
                Veeshans Peak 2 - Can you track us Druushkalaar ? I mean you are 
                a ranger so you should have known what will happen if you follow 
                our vile puller...But maybe you are just stupid....or didn't use 
                your skills probably. Oh well....go die idiot! The fight vs Druushk 
                was kinda hard (at least for a ranger) but we attacked so hard 
                that he lost all his flesh! <br>
                <br>
                I still wonder how so much stuff fitted into that little bone 
                pile: Veridix Shortblade for Melodie, two Skullcrusher of Kragg 
                for our monkey team Aethis and Ghex and a Shissar Deathspeaker 
                Staff. Grats again to all winners and there was still more to 
                come.... <br>
                <br>
                Veeshans Peak 2 - VPs Jukebox Xygoz refused to sing some songs 
                for us, so we started to sing a song for him. The song of his 
                cruel death. Well it wasn't too cruel tho, since he dropped so 
                fast, I doubt he felt any pain! He copied Zlandicar in a certain 
                way with creating that nice rocketeer corpse!<br>
                <br>
                He was nice to our shammies and gave them two Spear of Constriction, 
                namely to Schupniix and Grishnak. Our extremely vile necromancer 
                Scorpus took the Left Eye of Xygoz as trophy. Grats to the winners! 
                And there still was more to come! <br>
                <br>
                Veeshans Peak 2 - Hello former nemesis. Hello Hoshkar! After causing 
                some troubles in the past, he had no chance this time. Our blades 
                and spells cut through him like nothing and he died in no time. 
                Poor old dragon! <br>
                <br>
                He dropped some shiny things as well, like Veldraks Shortblade 
                for Danagorn, Feverblade - Bane of the Shissar for Corel and a 
                Fatesteaker...aehm...Fatesealer for Ovelia. Grats to the happy 
                winners and to the guild for defeating this wimp! <br>
                <br>
                Veeshans Peak 2 - The horde is back! Since our first try was so 
                well, we decided to do Veeshans Peak another time. This time we 
                were slightly faster, about 4 hours faster. As usual we began 
                with super wussy Silverwing. Her more than pitiful try to stop 
                us had no success. The only one dying was Silverwing herself. 
                <br>
                <br>
                She was so kind to drop us 4 weapons, including an Executioners 
                Blade, a Scimitar of Lifestealing and a Blue Flowered Katana for 
                Kerleblanc. She also dropped a Dragon Claw Main Gauche for Forgefeu. 
                Grats to the winners and grats to the guild for the first kill 
                of the day! <br>
                <br>
                07/28/01: Before he starts to feel lonely since nobody wants to 
                kill him, we decided to take down Velketor the Sorcerer as well. 
                While we were moving down he was pulled to zone in (!) by a very 
                bright person and wiped out some grps there. Fortunately he then 
                returned to his chamber. <br>
                <br>
                It was enchanter's day in Velke's saleout this time so we got 
                Crystal Crown of Confusion for Quingu and a Crystal Rod of Confusion 
                for Thalanx. Velketor also dropped Velketor's Spellbook and Silver 
                Sword of Yalrek. Grats to the winners and to the guild for another 
                3 biggie day! <br>
                <br>
                We thought that a cannibalistic dragon, Zlandicar, would be the 
                best to feed our cannibalistic ogres. So we went to Dragon Necropolis 
                to put him to his final rest and to give the ogres a good meal! 
                Okok, he somehow tried to eat the ogres first, but we fixed that! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Once again Zlandicar was the master of talismans, he 'gave' us 
                Zlandicars Talisman for Kerleblanc, First Brood Talisman for Calroon 
                and Frakadars Talisman for Nandari. Heart of Zlandicar and Massive 
                Dragonclaw Shard went to Guildbank. Grats to the happy winners! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Go die Sontalak! He showed up with his ugly face so we decided 
                to get rid of it. After all, Sontalak is one of the ugly dragons 
                that were ever born!<br>
                <br>
                Sontalak's Talisman fitted Samarea's neck best then. Grats to 
                the winner and to Darkwind for another dead dragon! </blockquote>

              <blockquote>07/26/01: I was supposed to have nothing to update for 
                a few days this week as we were recovering from a really intensive 
                weekend in Temple of Veeshan. However, Kuthu continually whined 
                to Kervasis at work and I had to schedule a fight for his epic 
                otherwise Kerv would have probably moved out. So, congrats to 
                Kuthu and Kervasis on this.<br>
                <br>
                07/23/01: The plan for the weekend was farming in Temple of Veeshan. 
                We couldn't decide exactly what we should do in ToV but the answer 
                I received is so clear to me now. <br>
                <br>
                Anyways, after a rough start Friday night due to being trained 
                by the newest uber guild of Sol Ro (Ro being the operative word) 
                we got underway. With a total of forty different people in and 
                out throughout the weekend we landed at least one piece for every 
                single member. Some chain and silk classes got up to three pieces 
                each. I would say this weekend was truly the best farming we've 
                ever done. Most notable were plate breastplates to Tumili, Rhynne, 
                and Thrakki and plate legs to Kubla. On a warrior heavy roster 
                we now need only one more plate breastplate to have all our warriors 
                outfitted. <br>
                <br>
                After we finished up ToV for the weekend we hit City of Mist to 
                fight Lhranc. I remember the first time we killed Lhranc was truly 
                an epic battle. Lhranc is easily the hardest mob needed to be 
                killed for any epic. We weren't sure what to expect with all the 
                extra levels and gear. The result was Lhranc defeated with three 
                (enchanter) deaths. That enabled Calidore to get his epic. </blockquote>

              <blockquote>07/23/01: Last night 5 of Eternal Wrath's clerics entered 
                the Best of the Best Tournament...Saeeliel, Geeman, Salamyen, 
                Crovax, and Tuloc. One of them recently moved his computer into 
                another location to allow his wife some relief late at night, 
                and himself to relocate back off the couch. The benefit of this 
                change was very evident as Saeeliel emerged after nearly six hours 
                of dueling as the BEST cleric on the server. CONGRATS Saeeliel! 
                <br>

                This now makes the third BoTB winner for EW since moving here 
                in December, with Semedi becoming the best druid and Aeno the 
                best ranger. <br>
                <br>
                Last week the Wrath truly lived up to its reputation as mighty 
                dragon slayers, spending 6 evenings in the north wing of ToV. 
                Much armor and goodies were distributed, and the knights were 
                allowed to choose which of the tasty meat of Aaryonar, Lord Feshlak, 
                Ikitar, Eashen, Dagarn the Destroyed, or Lord Koi Doken they enjoyed 
                the most. To the but 30 members who enjoyed the late snake of 
                Lord Koi their choice was obvious. </blockquote>

                Sebilis Linkdead! The plan worked as follows, aggro Trak, have 
                everyone relog all at the same time, and Voila! You too can make 
                nearly an entire zone linkdead. Seriously, we owned Trakanon the 
                Dummy-Face Dragon. The loot was a Mrylokars Breastplate, Jaundiced 
                Bone Breastplate, and four of the meanies teeth! <br>

                07/27/01: After a few miscues from early agro, and lagged healers

                I am convinced that our next attempt will be successful because 
                of our knowledge gained. Morchaint had the revelation of the night,

                into shape. I think the major thing we need to keep in mind is 
                discipline. We need discipline in order to survive. I will be

                Venril Sathir was our next victim. Finally after all this kills 
                he dropped something really nice. Donals Greaves of the Mourning 
                for Deevault our dark battle cleric and Jaundicated Bone Greaves 
                for Fatso Schande! Followed by a gnarled staff for the lovely

                <br>
                Now, do you want to read something really funny? We wanted to 
                kill Trakanon too and did we ? Noooooo! We felt like in disney 
                land when we entered the from player empty reet lair and Trakanons 
                Ghost walked 4 times through the lair...<br>
                <br>
                When came for the fifth time he just jumped out of the wall and 
                killed us all and that without pulling w00t! But we are all pretty 
                sure no Bugs! Its a feature! <br>
                <br>
                At least it made this ugly dragon a bit more interesting today, 
                but as always we will come back! But next time I prefer a textur 
                cheat to watch if Trak waits in wall or on his pad for us.<br>

                <br>
                We were very successful and found a shiny new Breastplate for 
                Snowshadow on the Plane of Hate!<br>
                <br>
                We slaughtered the whole royal court in Chardok and got next to 
                two cleric scrolls an ancient blade for Preysshadow. She only 
                misses a green dragon scale now...<br>
                <br>
                We fought together with Torion to complete the ultimate High Elf 
                Weapon. Another Natures Defender for Storm of Eternity!<br>

                We took over the Ragefire Camp in Solusek B and brought him to 
                spawn after 24 hours of camping. Alliwa was the happy and lucky

                We then proceeded over to Great Divide and destroyed the Taskmaster. 
                After the fatty Ugree slapped on a slow the fight was over. The
