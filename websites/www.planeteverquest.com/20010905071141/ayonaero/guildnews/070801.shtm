              <blockquote>07/13/01: After PoF finally a ...guild first kill occurred. 
                We went to Thurgadin and took down Dain Frostreaver for our first 
                time. It was a cruel fight, especially as he got help of 5 other 
                mobs. But Darkwinds finest did well and we took him and his friends 
                down. It somewhat reminded me of our fight vs Xygoz last time, 
                just much much harder here.<br>
                <br>
                <a href="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/news1307/dain1.jpg">Here 
                you can see</a> a pretty little, fat, dumb looking dorf fighting 
                against our elite. It's very surprising that such a lil thing 
                can take out so much of our best fighters!<br>
                <br>
                After all the *cheers* and *YEAH!s* were done we looked what he 
                has for us. We cut his head and handed it to Falhallis which resulted 
                in a Belt of Dwarfslaying, we also found Frostreaver's Embroidered 
                Cloak and two Frostreaver, one went to Blizz. BIG BIG GRATS too 
                all winners and especially Darkwind for that kill. :) Keep up 
                the good work. <br>
                <br>
                Well zone crashes own ...since we got another Cazic Thule cause 
                of that. :) Thanks Verant! /hug PoF was cleared pretty fast as 
                usual and then we took another dance with the big boss. Too bad 
                he still didn't learn how to dance so he fell and broke is neck! 
                While trying to reanimate him, we found some stuff in his pockets, 
                hey you know, medics always have sneaky fingers! We found 3 Cloakes 
                of the Fearsome which were marked for: Danthalas, Kalle and Svara. 
                And cause the gods had a good day he even dropped a 4th item: 
                Bile Etched Obsidian Choker for Corellian. Grats to all the winners! 
                <br>
                <br>
                07/12/01: Well, no boss mob ...remained as we got the news that 
                <a href="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/news1207/Trakanon3.jpg">Trakanon</a> 
                is up. So we decided to let the old times life once more and kill 
                him. It was total overkill with nearly 30 members and we had no 
                losses besides our torpedo and...oh well....Chan. That means we 
                had none...<br>
                <br>
                He dropped us a Deepwater Breastplate and a Jaundiced Bone Breastplate. 
                Grats Darkwind! <br>
                <br>
                After two dragons ...we decided to be fair and kill a giant too. 
                Velketor the Sorcerer was the only valuable giant up at that moment. 
                So we went to Velketors Labyrinth and - after a zone crash - finally 
                attacked and killed him.<br>
                <br>
                <a href="http://www.darkwind-guild.com/pics/news1207/velke%201.jpg">Here</a> 
                our members dancing on the corpse, what you cannot see is, his 
                head was still moving while we did that. But agony already had 
                Velketor in his grasp.<br>
                <br>
                Today was Velketors Mage day, so he dropped us Boots and Gloves 
                of Bladecalling and also a crappy Bracelet of Frostbite. The boots 
                went to Biancca and the gloves to Jowood. Grats to the winners, 
                and there was still more to come... <br>
                <br>
                Since both *landicars were up ...we moved in to Dragon Necropolis 
                and payed Zlandicar another visit after we were done with Klandicar. 
                We fulfilled his destiny like we did for Klandi before. He went 
                down fast to our superior forces! <br>
                <br>
                He was so nice to let us some lewtz before he left for another 
                nap. Zlandicars Talisman fitted best to our sneaky little halfling 
                rogue Zwiffs, our cruel Oger Kalle took the Heart of Zlandicar 
                and greedy guildbank(tm) got a Cowl of Mortality. While we were 
                in DN we also killed the rat boss Vaniki who left us a Willsapper 
                for another halfling rogue, Corellian. Grats to all winners! <br>
                <br>
                Sleepers Tomb should ...start to shiver. We took down Klandicar 
                once more and got another key to Sleepers Tomb. This key went 
                to Eaithahal....Eaithalhahas.....Eaithalahsar. Grats!!</blockquote>

              <blockquote>07/13/01: Two quick picture of people I neglected over 
                the last week in getting their faces on the web page. First <a href="http://www.eqdestiny.com/download/luvepic.jpg">Luvana 
                finished her epic</a> last week.<br>
                <br>
                And <a href="http://www.eqdestiny.com/download/geinbp.jpg">Uthor</a> 
                received his Warlord's Breastplate. <br>
                <br>
                We've put in around thirty hours at the Ragefire camp now for 
                Shadowtorch and still no friggin dragon. It's amazing what you 
                do to pass the time. Around 4 am one morning myself, Diison, Krynus, 
                Leet For Life's very own Belegurth, and Maxel were hanging around 
                in lair trying to stay interested. <br>
                <br>
                Last night had in store for us another Gorenaire and another Talendor. 
                Now, I assume other guilds don't check our page because they keep 
                losing when I clearly gave out the strategy. In fact! One of the 
                attempts last night involved 3 nearly dead drolvargs mezzed in 
                hopes that Gorenaire would cheal the dogs. <br>
                <br>
                07/10/01: we decided it was time to rid Gorenaire from the Dreadlands. 
                Now, let me explain to you a little something about this version 
                of Gorenaire. I personally know of at least eight attempts made 
                on this Gorenaire by multiple notable guilds across the server. 
                I know one guild that lost four times to this Gorenaire with 45 
                people. Another lost two before giving up. Needless to say I was 
                a little anxious at what it could be that made this Gorenaire 
                so much more difficult then the others. After all, she did stay 
                up for three days. <br>
                <br>
                We had one of our largest forces in one place to date to attempt 
                to tackle this difficult version of Gore. We had forty-two people 
                line up in Dreadlands in a seemingly futile attempt to defeat 
                this seemingly impossible Gore. I even had clerics on standby 
                just in case the rumors were true and this Gore was more difficult 
                then the others. <br>
                <br>
                We had a serious lack of enchanters so she was able to cheal twice. 
                At two cheals + 32k hit points means we had to do 52k worth of 
                damage. That can turn into a kinda long and messy fight when all 
                your tanks are slowed. <br>
                <br>
                We owned her. Had only one death from an over-zealous wizard. 
                I would even say this was the easiest Gorenaire we have ever fought 
                to date. She went down faster then Krynus after two beers. I would 
                like to remind all our readers at home that I gave away the strategy 
                to killing gorenaire last week. Clearly these other guilds on 
                the server didn't heed my advice or they wouldn't have lost so 
                many times. I even had one member from one of the multiple guilds 
                that lost to her tell me that she was buffed. heh.. right. <br>
                <br>
                Most guilds kill Gorenaire for epic pieces so I'd like to tell 
                everyone just what they lost to. Phantomsix received the frost 
                book for the pally epic. My bank received a white scale! Kera 
                got the white shield. </blockquote>

              <blockquote>07/13/01: An awesome evening we had today in the Temple 
                of Veeshan. Some minutes right after we killed the first Guards 
                a Leather Tunic dropped which went to Bobbo followed by a plate 
                bracer for Lady Snowshadow, Chain Vambraces for Pasquino, plague 
                bear's bracer for Soltanol, Chain Vambraces for our big daddy 
                Hartmut and uhm... ah yes! Da Troll!<br>
                <br>
                Gukazz got some awesome Warlord Greaves with crazy AC. And last 
                but not least Melciah the Crusader could make his dream to reality 
                today a Plate Breastplate dropped and he got his shiny Breastplate 
                in Kael Drakkal this evening! <br>
                <br>
                Fandariella finished her Quest and got the Dazzling Robe! And 
                Monzta got his Golden Star Leggings.<br>
                <br>
                Oh, and Justifyer was finally able to complete his Nature's Defender 
                since the Quest NPC on the Growthplane at least decided to leave 
                his damn tree in which he was stucked for several days. A GM was 
                only able to kill the mob! <br>
                <br>
                07/10/01: Again we waited for Trakanon, the revenge in the heads 
                of our heroes was strong enough to beat him down again. He dropped 
                a poisoned mantle for Melciah and a Jaundicated Bone Breastplate 
                for Schande!<br>
                <br>
                And next time guys, don't agro the 4 Juggernauts, Trakanon is 
                a looser but a fight with those 4 adds was really interesting.<br>
                <br>
                Congrats friends! I hope i can add a picture soon our vile troll 
                went LD after the fight. <br>
                <br>
                07/08/01: This evening we started a return to ToV and we saw much 
                more improvement and teamwork. We cleared the entrance area till 
                the west wing and the big part of the west wing which was availible 
                to pull. We got a lot of drops congrats everyone!<br>
                <br>
                Taelayen got his Ancient Leather Tunic, Fandariella her Ancient 
                Silk Robe, Hartmut an ancient chain Helm, Aiella ancient plate 
                Boots, Hillh ancient plate Greaves, Tunnes to her awesome ancient 
                plate Greaves and much more minor things.<br>
                <br>
