            <p><b><font size="5">Role Playing Dictionary</font></b><br>
              By Kwill Heartfyre, Scholar Magician of Felwithe</p>
            <p>My friends, I write to you with earnest hand of the information 
              I have collected from scholars scattered over the four corners of 
              the land. Much work by many wise and brave souls has gone into the 
              gathering of lore and artifacts to uncover the history of Norrath 
              and the peoples who live there. I hope my humble effort will advance 
              the knowledge of all peoples, to bring peace and prosperity to all 
              the races that must live together in our fair world. <br>
              ~~Kwill Heartfyre</p>
            <p><b>F-Z</b></p>
            <p><b>Faerie</b><br>
              Tiny winged creatures, they have their own court. They live amongst 
              the toadstools in the Lesser Faydark in Fayswer. </p>
            <p><b>Faydark's Champions </b><br>
              Rangers in Greater Faydark have a treetop guildhall in Kelethin. 
              Here the Faydark's Champions train under guildmaster Maesyn Trueshot. 
              These champions oppose the Crushbone Orcs wherever they can find 
              them. They are loyal to the Elven King Tearis Thex, and support 
              both the Clerics and Soldiers of Tunare.</p>
            <p><b>Faydwer </b><br>
              Home of the Dwarves, Wood Elves and Gnomes. The High Elf civilization 
              from Antonica also relocated to Faydwer after the death of the Elddar 
              Forest. Faydwer is the home of two of the oldest creatures on all 
              of Norrath, Mayong Mistmoore, the Elf-Vampire and Phinigel Autropos, 
              the last living Kedge. The name, Faydwer was given to this continent 
              by the High Elves of Antonica when they landed on its shores.</p>
            <p><b>Feerot</b><br>
              The Feerott is the dark swampy home of the ogres and lizard men 
              of Antonica. The ogres live in a cave system at the edge of the 
              swamp, while the lizard men have established camps scattered throughout. 
              One can find the city of Grobb in the Feerot area. It is also the 
              home of the ancient ruined temple of Cazic-Thule, hidden in the 
              depths of the swamp. The traveler can find spiders, frogloks, bats, 
              wolves, skeletons, specters, zombies, and of course a number if 
              interesting ogres.</p>
            <p><b>Feign Death</b><br>
              Some creatures are said to pretend to be dead, in order to fool 
              their attackers into leaving them alone. Clever monks have mimicked 
              this behavior and found it to be very effective for them, too.</p>

			<b>Felwithe</b><br>
              The elegant High Elf castle in Greater Faydark, in Faydwer. Here 
              the elven king Tearis Thex holds court.</p>
            <p><b>Field of Bone</b><br>
              The Field of Bone is the original site of a vast reservoir for the 
              city of Cabilis and the nearby structures. Long ago, however, the 
              fatal battle between Galat the Ikasar and Jaled Dal the dragon was 
              held in the skies above and the magical energies unleashed there 
              forever charred the surface of the earth. The skeleton of Galat's 
              steed, a hybrid of froglok and dragon, can still be seen there. 
              Buryai, Iksar outcasts, wolf hunters, undead, scorpions, scarabs, 
              spiders, and Iksar guards can be found here.</p>
            <p><b>Firiona Vie</b><br>
              A high elf paladin princess, she is an avatar of Tunare and an intrepid 
              adventurer. Her adventures make up much of the lore of Norrath. 
              See the Chronicals of Firiona Vie for stories of her adventures.</p>
            <p><b>Land of Firiona Vie</b><br>
              Firiona Vie is the site of an outpost established by the High Elves 
              under the direction of King Thex to the lands of the Iskar. Dominating 
              the outpost is a statue of Firiona Vie, avatar of Tunare. Beyond 
              the outpost, a forest stretches. Ancient Iksar statues and structures 
              dot the landscape. The beach area near the outpost teems with evil 
              drachnids. Pilgrims, drixies, pirates, forest giants, leeches, and 
              goblins roam the woods. Sometimes an ancient Jarsath skeleton walks 
              the forests here. Deep in the forest is a giant outpost, and beyond 
              that, a drolvarg village in an ancient temple. The ruins are infested 
              with frogloks.</p>
            <p><b>Forbidden Arts</b><br>
              Once the magical disciplines of wizardry, magic, and enchantment 
              were called the forbidden arts.</p>
            <p><b>Freeport</b><br>
              Considered by most to be the hub of Antonica for a variety of reasons. 
              It is the mercantile center of the continent, since it holds the 
              only port with a regular boat to the island continent of Faydwer. 
              It holds facilities for most of the artisan trades, and most budding 
              craftsman travel to Freeport to take advantage of the readily available 
              facilities. Freeport is also the hub for traffic of all sorts. The 
              good races travel its streets to go to their guilds and the shops, 
              as well as to the boat to Faydwer, and the dark races travel through 
              the sewers to reach most of the same destinations. Guild Halls for 
              all classes except the Rangers, Druids, and Shamans are present 
              within the city. There are bad and good parts to the city, where 
              one can find just about anything a heart might desire. There are 
              pockets of corruption within the guards of Freeport, as every good 
              paladin soon discovers. Many good citizens allied with the Knights 
              of Truth cannot walk the streets in safety for fear of reprisal 
              from Sir Lucan D'Vere and his corrupt band of guards. Outside the 
              city gates, one can find an infestation of rats, spiders, snakes, 
              skeletons, beetles, and even small Deathfist orcs looking for unwary 
              travelers.</p>
            <p><b>Freeport Militia</b><br>
              This group of guards may seem on the surface to be of help to the 
              citizens and travellers in Freeport, but they are quite corrupt, 
              under the leadership of Sir Lucan D'Vere.</p>
            <p><b>Frogloks of Guk </b><br>
              These swamp loving creatures would like no more than to be left 
              alone but the Trolls of Grobb will have no such thing. Deep within 
              the ancient Trollish city of Guk, which the Frogloks reclaimed from 
              the Innothule, they fight a never ending battle against legions 
              of Trolls and other humaniods. The Frogloks are also cursed by the 
              fact that it is only within the swampland of the Innothule where 
              they can deposit and hatch their young. (EQ Official Bestiary)</p>
            <p><b>Frogloks of Kunark</b><br>
              The frogloks who inhabit the outdoor areas of Kunark.</p>
            <p><b>Frontier Mountains</b><br>
              The Frontier Mountains are the highest and roughest set of mountians 
              located on the continent. These harsh mountains cut across the western 
              half of the continent, and are inhabited by a variety of powerful, 
              large creatures, for whom the peaks are mere hills. Many of these 
              creatures operate vast mining operations in the mountains for the 
              minerals that lie beneath them, and the adventurerer may find the 
              Mines of Nurga and the Temple of Droga in these mountains. The unwary

              <p><b>Gharol the Orc</b><br>
                <i>Of the border struggles and the great burning: </i><br>
                The elves of Kelethin were tentative at first and the lord of 
                Kelethin, an old elf by the name of Carandril, sent many messages 
                to Gharol to ask what his plans were in moving his clan eastward. 
                To this day no scholar can really be sure if Gharol was able to 
                decipher the letters or not, as it is general knowledge that most 
                orcs can't read a word of any written language, but it is certain 
                the orcan lord was angry to find that another race had already 
                taken residence in the eastern lands. Carandril never saw any 
                messengers he sent out again, as they were all killed by Gharol 
                immediately as the letters were exchanged. Acting purely on his 
                instincts, the leader of the crushbone clan told his followers 
                of this &quot;new&quot; race and how they had &quot;stolen&quot; 
                the east from the orcs. Gharol then started to plot a new plan 
                which would entail the complete destruction of Kelethin and the 
                enslavement of the elven race, as he thought kelethin was the 
                only city of elves and the center for the entire elven empire. 
              <p> Both assumptions were false and the forces of Gharol were met 
                with bitter, however surprised, resistance on the borders of the 
                greater faydark. Most of the orcs leading this first attack were 
                killed and the rest were turned quickly away. Angry at this new 
                defeat and jealous of the elven strength, Gharol started to plot 
                a new system of attack. He understood that most of his soldiers 
                had been slaughtered from elves high in the treetops who would 
                rain showers of arrows down on his forces. So for the second attack, 
                Gharol put his orcs into a long line of attackers, gave each soldier 
                his own makeshift torch, and then ordered the entire host to run 
                into the borders of the greater Faydark and burn whatever they 
                could touch. The Crushbone orcs set fire from everything to the 
                tops of the trees to the grasses on the forest paths. Nothing 
                but ash was left in their wake. The elven archers high in the 
                trees were burned to death and the remaining elven soldiers, horrified 
                and shocked at the tactics of their strange enemy, began to make 
                a hasty retreat. The wood elves would later call the incident 
                &quot;the great burning.&quot; Gharol, seeing how effective his 
                new methods were, gathered his clan into many small camps around 
                the greater Faydark and ordered the construction of hundreds of 
                torches for a second assault. The lord of Kelethin, desperate 
                for help, sent word of his plight to the heart of the empire: 
                Felwithe. 
              <p> The first elf to take interest in Kelethin's request was a young 
                soldier named Edril. Edril had lived his entire life in Felwithe, 
                schooled by the best teachers and raised in a wealthy family. 
                Around his 30th birthday, young by elven standards, he admitted 
                himself into the imperial school of soldiery where he impressed 
                his teachers with both his knowledge of military science and his 
                deadly accurate fighting skills. After graduating and performing 
                many deeds of merit in the imperial army of the elves, he was 
                chosen as a personal guard of the emperor at the unprecedented 
                age of 50. What brought him everlasting fame among the elves, 
                however, was not how he excelled in schooling but what he chose 
                to do for Kelethin. Going straight to the emperor himself, Edril 
                asked that he be allowed to lead the attack against the orcs. 
                When the emperor granted his wish, Edril hand picked 100 of the 
                best elven warriors and the best horses, and rode quickly to the 
                woodland kingdom of Kelethin. 
              <p> He was met at Kelethin with a large reception, but decided to 
                ride through quickly. He was there for only one purpose: to make 
                a name for himself by destroying the orcs. Little more then two 
                days after arriving in the city, Edril and his men rode outside 
                the greater Faydark and headed directly for the first orcan encampment. 
                It was the middle of the night when Edril made his first strike, 
                and the orcs were completely caught off guard. Edril's men rode 
                straight over the orcs, slaughtering every clansmen they saw with 
                little casualties of their own. Edril is said to have fought like 
                a madman, tallying over 20 kills himself. Without even stopping 
                to catch their breath, Edril's soldiers rode for the next camp 
                so as to keep the element of surprise. 
              <p> One by one the camps of the crushbone orcs were destroyed quickly 
                and brutally. The orcs, still preparing for their second assault 
                on Kelethin, were always caught by surprise. Edril and his men 
                moved from one battle to the next so quickly, the elves called 
                them the legion of wind. The strategy worked perfectly: Gharol 
                was never able to get word of the new attackers in time to plan 
                a defense and so most of the orcs were slaughtered. The final 
                battle, lasting longer then the rest, was against Gharol's own 
                camp. Many of Edril's warriors were killed in this fight but all 
                of the orcs, including Gharol, were driven away to the deep growth 
                of the wild Greater Faydark. Here they have made their makeshift 
                kingdom. When Edril returned to his kingdom, he was proclaimed 
                high protector of Kelethin with over 150 kills to his name alone. 
                This would not be the last time Edril's name was written into 
                elven history, however. It is believed that only weeks later after 
                their retreat, Gharol was killed by his own followers. </p>

              Gnomes spend most of their lives in their underground burrows and 
              rarely come to the surface. They resemble dwarves to some extent, 
              but have a ruddy brown skin and are more wiry and gnarled. Their 
              hair is white, and somewhat sparse. Yet, their appearance is not 
              what gets them noticed. Gnomes believe that building contraptions 
              ranks right up there with saving the world. Renowned for their tinkering 
              abilities, gnomes delight in the fact that they can build the right 
              machine for any occasion. The many catastrophes, explosions, and 
              traumatic amputations of limbs are not seen as tragedies, but rather--learning 
              experiences.</p>
            <p>Gnomes are an easy-going race. Most always have a pleasant, carefree 
              attitude. They do not believe in failures, only temporary setbacks. 
              Their fascinations with gadgets, sprockets, springs, doodads, and 
              frighteningly enough, explosives, provide gnomes with an abundance 
              of healthy respect (from a safe distance) from others. Not ones 
              to waste time on such things as revenge, gnomes just do experiments. 
              They can't help it if an experiment goes bad on someone who just 
              happened to offend them in some way. </p>
            <p>Gnomes follow the standard occupations of cleric, enchanter, magician,

              of their history (which is perhaps some indication as to the severity 
              of their curse). However, they are said to be in possession of the 
              Staff of Anexen, parts of which were given to four goblin races

              <p>This ancient tale of a civilization long since forgotten by the 
                name of Ankexfen was handed down to me by a visiting priestess 
                in Najena by the name of Aerthane D'Zitherak, a Priestess of Innoruuk, 
                and seeker of the Fabled and Ancient Staff of Ankexfen:<br>
                Long ago, there existed a race known as the Ankexfen, after their 
                progenitor Hazeg Ankexfen, who were created by Rallos Zek during 
                the Elder Age. This race was quite intelligent and cunning. They 
                quickly expanded their knowledge of magic and the other planes, 
                yet constantly yearned for more power. So, along with their ogre 
                counterparts, they set out to master the Plane of Earth. Alas, 
                their attempts proved futile and the combined might of the other 
                gods forced Rallos Zek back to the Planes of Power, leaving his 
                creations to the whims of the other gods. 
              <p> 'The wrath of the unnamed gods was grim. Thousands of ogres 
                were instantly slain - their empire left to crumble under the 
                hand of retribution. The giants were flung across the face of 
                Norrath like seeds to the wind. The Ankexfen's fate was more severe. 
                The entire race was exterminated, but from the ashes were born 
                the four goblin races. Exactly how this happened is unknown. But 
                what is known is that each goblin clan was stripped of any knowledge 
                and was neither informed of the other clans nor of their origins. 
                Each clan was then transported to a separate environment to help 
                preserve the gods' will. However, the gods were not without mercy 
                and each clan was granted a section of the staff. Upon each staff, 
                a crystal was adorned. These staves served to aid the goblin clans 
                in understanding their environment. These remnants of the Staff 
                of Ankexfen combine to create the fabled and powerful Staff of

                of Kithicor]</i><br>
                The goblins of the Pickclaw tribe were not known for their wit. 
                In fact, because of their extreme lack of intelligence, they have 
                been abused in trades by just about every merchant in Norrath. 
                If one were to wonder why the citizens of Highkeep permit the 
                clan to live in the mines beneath their homes, the answer is quite 
                simple, they are good miners and they trade the ores cheaply. 
              </p>
              <p> The goblins would slave day in and out looking for the &quot;shiny 
                rocks&quot; for which the stupid humans gave them coin. The fact 
                that these same rocks actually made the coin they received was 
                a feature that escaped them. </p>
              <p> In addition to the humans of Highkeep, the goblins also made 
                secret trades with both the Teir`Dal of Neriak and the Fier`Dal 
                of Faydwer. The Teir`Dal would reward the goblins with decent 
                arms and generally paid the best. They were dangerous to deal 
                with as they were just as likely to kill you as pay you. Trading 
                with the Fier`Dal was rather uncommon. The Fier`Dal only came 
                seeking the few rare stones they used to create their arcane runes, 
                which was fine for the pickclaws as no one else wanted those dull 
                looking rocks. </p>
              <p> The Pickclaw miner Nurgal was on par intellectually with of 
                the rest his clan. Nurgal was quite happy this day as he had found 
                a new vein in his section of the mines. In fact, he'd already 
                pulled three shiny yellow bricks today and was sure to get at 
                least a fistful of copper for them! After chipping a few more 
                layers he hit something very hard with his pick, so hard that 
                his pick bent. &quot;Whaza!&quot; he exclaimed. In the crevice 
                he revealed was a slightly glowing blue rock. &quot;Hmm,&quot; 
                he thought, &quot;me never seen a blue rock a'fore.&quot; He tried 
                chipping at it a little bit more but could not even put a scratch 
                into it. Finally in a display of rare brilliance, and after ruining 
                several more tools, he decided to carve around the rock and yank 
                it out. </p>
              <p> The rock was spherical in shape, about 8 inches in diameter. 
                Nurgal's eyes gleamed as he guessed how many allies he could buy 
                with this rare find. He quickly concealed it in his belt pouch, 
                wary as always that some of the larger goblins might see it and 
                take it from him. He scrambled out of the hole he was working 
                in and started off to the city to find the dark elf ambassador. 
                The dark elves had always given Nurgal the best prices for rare 
                finds, and this would be no exception he decided.</p>
              <p> Tyrana Slil was quite pleased with Nurgal, especially since 
                he swore that he brought this new find straight to her without 
                telling anyone else. As one of the Teir`Dal ambassadors in Highkeep, 
                it was Tyrana's job to be both spy and broker for materials gained 
                in the keep. Although Tyrana enjoyed the shady nature of her work, 
                she really wanted to be back in Neriak. Working with these lesser 
                races day in and out was beneath her standards. &quot;Thanks to 
                this stupid creature,&quot; she thought, &quot;I may just have 
                a ticket back there.&quot; &quot;So, u pay me big?&quot; he asked 
                with a lustful gaze. &quot;Sweet sweet Nurgal, you've been so 
                kind to me, how can I ever repay you&#133; more wine?&quot; Gods 
                how she hated having to play the role of seductress to this loathsome 
                creature, but nevertheless, her tactics were effective. Nurgal 
                gulped the wine, most of which ended up on his gut, and seemed 
                most pleased with himself. &quot;Now, let us see just what kind 
                of properties this find of yours has.&quot; </p>
              <p> She had the orb centered on the table, although she was not 
                the most practiced geologist, as a necromancer of Innoruuk she 
                did have some powerful identification spells at her disposal. 
                As she finished her minor enchantment there was a bright flash 
                of blue light and a burning sensation that caused her to jump 
                back, shrieking. Nurgal promptly jumped under the table wanting 
                no part of the dark elf's wrath that was sure to follow. But instead 
                of draining Nurgal's life as she stared at her now burnt fingertips, 
                Tyrana begin to cackle with unabashed glee. &quot;By Innoruuk's 
                hand this is no mere metal! Its magic properties alone are the 
                strongest I've seen!&quot; Realizing that his mistress was happy 
                again Nurgal pulled himself up from the floor and smiled. &quot;Nurgal&#133;. 
                Are there more of these where you found this one, in the mines?&quot; 
                she asked. &quot;Umm, me not know&#133;but usually when me find 
                one type of shiny rock me find more later,&quot; he replied. &quot;I 
                must get both this rock and this information to Neriak at once,&quot; 
                Tyrana thought to herself, &quot;But, before I leave, I must have 
                this wretched creature show me where he found this, so I can be 
                done with him.&quot;</p>
              <p> After Nurgal was appropriately intoxicated, Tyrana tried to 
                convince the goblin to show her where it was he found this vein 
                of strange blue ore. Nurgal was hesitant to reveal the location 
                of his find to the dark elf but after Tyrana offered him a sizeable 
                reward, the goblin finally agreed. Calling for a guard from the 
                keep to escort them, Tyrana followed Nurgal down into the mines 
                where he revealed the location of the strange blue vein of ore.<br>
                Tyrana was very pleased with Nurgal's find and complimented the 
                goblin on a job well done. After inspecting the vein of ore, Tyrana 
                turned to the goblin and grinned. Her hands began to glow with 
                a pale green light. Nurgal jumped in fear as the magic began to 
                swirl and build around Tyrana. The coarse hair on the goblin's 
                body began to bristle with the building energy. Ducking his head, 
                Nurgal blathered, &quot;What you doing? You not hurt Nurgal now?&quot; 
                Tyrana continued to smile at the goblin and said in a sweet voice, 
                &quot;Why Nurgal! I'm not going to hurt you, I'm simply creating 
                your reward!&quot; No sooner had the Teir`Dal uttered these words 
                did she draw away the full sum of Nurgal's life-force. With a 
                pitiful squeal, the goblin slumped to the ground, a dry and empty 
                husk. Tyrana laughed.</p>
              <p> Concealing the large blue sphere in her packs she prepared to 
                journey back to Neriak to report her find. Tyrana sought out Grigog, 
                Bgug, Sagg, and Glunn a trio of orcs of the Shralok clan. Tyrana 
                often used these three as escorts for her journeys between Neriak 
                and Highkeep. Though she always paid the orcs well for their services, 
                they were always willing to help protect to &quot;bootifal&quot; 
                Tyrana Slil and probably would have done the job free of charge.</p>

              <p> <b>Grandmaster Tynn</b> <br>
                The father of Iksar monk disciplines. He came to the empire from 
                an unknown tribe. Some say he was a ronin who wandered the worlds 
                of Norrath where he formed the basis of the city of Sebilis with 
                no rebirth. He entered to form a caste which did not exist. He 
                was quickly challenged by the warlords. He spoke his words and 
                they did not listen. He knew the only way to make them understand 
                was to challenge their finest in The Gauntlet. He called for four 
                of the finest warlords and allowed them arms. The warlords agreed, 
                thinking his challenge as easy task. 
              <p> Grandmaster Tynn quickly dispatched of the warlords with nothing 
                more than fist and tail. He fought in a way never displayed. His 
                victory earned him much respect and Emperor Sathir soon commanded 
                him to form the Court of Pain and raise an army of monks. Tynn 
                formed the Swifttail Caste. <br>
                Soon the way of fist and tail had hundreds in it's ranks, climbing 
                the rungs. Tynn showed them they were not warriors, but monks. 
              <p> They would don shackles as testament to the Age of Snake when 
                the Iksar were a race enslaved. Inner strength and harmony were 
                taught. The Swifttail were born. 
            </blockquote>
            <p> The Swifttail were disbanded during the End Days. It was not till 
              the rise of the new empire under Emperor Vekin did the caste reform. 
              Grandmaster Glox, a former disciple of Tynn, came to New Sebilis 
              to rebuild the Court of Pain. In honor of Tynn, all masters now 
              drape themselves in a robe like he wore. (History of Norrath, Verant

              The Great Divide is a heavily mountainous area, cutting the continent 
              of Velious into two halves, east and west. The harsh environment 
              is home to all nature of powerful creatures, including shardwurms, 
              Kodiaks, a race of half- man-half-bull called Tizmaks, Coldain,

              Greater Faydark is the home of the wood elves, in the tree city 
              of Kelethin, and the high elves, in the grand city of Felwithe. 
              It is also very near the homes of both the dwarves and the gnomes, 
              so many members of those races are seen here as well. The traveler 
              must be wary of the camps of orcs near Kelethin which have spread 
              from Crushbone. One may also see all manner of creatures including

            <p><b>Half Elf</b><br>
              Half elves, being a blend between humans and elves, share some of 
              the strengths and weaknesses of both races. They most closely resemble 
              humans, except for their slightly pointed ears and sharper facial 
              features. Although scorned by the more closed-minded individuals 
              of their parent races, half elves received the best attributes of 
              both parents. From the elves, they received the much-valued ability 
              to see clearly in the dark, good agility and good dexterity. From 
              humans they received better strength and stamina. With these abilities, 
              half elves make good bards, druids, paladins, rangers, rogues, and 
              warriors.</p>
            <p>The other races are limited with regard to places where they can 
              begin their lives. Half elves have more options. They can choose 
              to originate from the cities of Qeynos, Freeport, Kelethin, or Felwithe. 
              This benefit helps in establishing half elves throughout the world. 
              (The History of Norrath, Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>Halfling</b><br>
              Halflings are stocky little people who most closely resemble humans, 
              but they are extremely agile, dexterous, and very light of foot, 
              not like those clumsy humans. Halflings hail from Rivervale, a quiet 
              little hamlet smack dab in the center of Antonica. Their mischievous, 
              jovial natures make them fun people to be around. Male halflings 
              take great pride in their foot hair and strive to ensure that each 
              hair is properly groomed. </p>
            <p>Possessing naturally high dexterity and agility, halflings are 
              viewed as quick little buggers who smile a lot. They have a love 
              of travel, and their professions of cleric, druid, rogue, and warrior 
              lead them on many an adventure. With their innate ability to hide, 
              halflings make great pranksters, sneaking up on an unsuspecting 
              victim and poking them, causing a bladder-loosening scream.</p>
            <p>All is not fun and games for halflings, however. They take the 
              encroaching goblin horde as a serious threat and defend Rivervale 
              and Misty Thicket with all of their might. (The History of Norrath, 
              Verant International)</p>
            <p><b>Halas</b><br>
              City of the Barbarians found in the frozen north. Rough and crude, 
              the city reflects the warrior culture of its founders.</p>
            <p><b>Heretics </b><br>
              The Heretics can be found in Paineel. Erudin and Paineel were in 
              a state of war. Erudin is a longstanding city of magic but was opposed 
              to Necromantic magic. At first the Heretics simply fled into the 
              nearby Tox Forest, but they then moved into Paineel on the opposite 
              side of the forest from Erudin. The Tox Forest is now a battleground 
              between the two cities. In Paineel can be found three Guildmasters. 
              The Clerics are led by Sern Adolia, the Necromancers by Coriante 
              Verisue and the Shadow Knights by Mandaril Dark Knife. The Heretics 
              have no allies but they oppose those in Erudin. They oppose the 
              clerics and paladins of Deepwater Knights, and the three magic user 
              guilds: Gate Callers, Craft Keepers and Crimson Hands. (Allakhazam's 
              Magical Realm)</p>
            <p><b>High Elf (Koada`Dal)</b><br>
              The high elves are much more intellectual than their woodland kin, 
              and are the &quot;royalty&quot; of the elven races (with the exception 
              of their dark brethren). They share the appearance of their woodland 
              kin, but are taller, thinner, more beautiful, more pale in skin, 
              and much more egotistical. </p>
            <p>High elves are very much like the Erudites in their belief that 
              manual labor is beneath them. Sweat and dirt do not combine well 
              with the finicky high elf personality. They would rather use magic 
              when muscle is needed. They are a highly intelligent race which 
              bodes well for them since all of the professions they may choose 
              from have magical requirements. For the devout, the path of cleric. 
              For the devout soldier, the path of a paladin is a logical choice. 
              Enchanters, wizards, and magicians hold high places within their 
              ranks.</p>
            <p>Even though high elves consider themselves the royalty of the elven 
              races, they will not hesitate to join parties with other races who 
              lean toward good. They understand that some sacrifices must be made 
              in order to do what they believe is the right thing. Of course, 
              they still will not hesitate to remind others of their own supremacy. 
            </p>
            <p>They make their home in Felwithe castle, in the Greater Faydark. 
              They are ruled by King Tearis Thex. (The History of Norrath, Verant

            <p><b>High Pass Keep</b><br>
              High Keep is the seat of a former empire that used to spread its 
              power over central Antonica in years past. Now, their reign has 
              diminished under constant attacks by the orcs and gnolls, and is 
              restricted to High Pass Hold now. The Pickclaw goblins mine the 
              area below the city. The inhabitants of High Keep thrive on trade, 
              both legal and illegal, passing through the center of the continent, 
              as High Pass Hold is one of the few &quot;safe&quot; regions to 
              pass through, thanks to the leadership of Carson McCabe. Visitors 
              to the town can see High Elf Princess Lenia, smugglers, beggars, 
              nobles and all sorts of other characters who end up here.</p>
            <p><b>High Pass Hold</b><br>
              Highpass Hold lies along the main travel route from Qeynos to Freeport, 
              and is a mountain pass guarded as well as possible by the valiant 
              guards of Highpass Keep. The pass is treacherous for the unwary, 
              as the fall from the moutain cliffs is deadly. Orcs and gnolls have 
              patrols that run up to the foot of the Keep itself, and the brave 
              Highpass citizens have carved out their homes out of the gulleys 
              and nooks. </p>
            <p>The Hole<br>
              The Hole is a huge area of underground caverns and the remains of 
              the old Heretic city on Odus, prior to their being driven out by 
              the evil forces that now dwell within it. There are legions of earth 
              elementals and other monsters to contend with to reach Lord Yael, 
              an earth elemental, within.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><i>As told by Talloth Vara in Paineel: </i><br>
                You have come to the Anthenaeum Necromanita. This place serves 
                as the stores of knowledge for the Seekers of the Dark Truth. 
                The Dark Truth is what all the necromancers in Paineel seek to 
                learn&#133;The Necromancers here are called the Seekers of the 
                Dark Truth. The leader of the Seekers is known as the Speaker 
                of the Dark Truth. The current Speaker is Coriante Verisue. She 
                does however, have many rivals. I support Coriante due to my respect 
                for her. Many have no such respect and covet her power and her 
                position. One such individual is Darton, the Seeker's Chief Researcher. 
                He is a direct decendent of Dartain, a hero to our people. Many 
                years ago, the Heretics and the people of Erudin had a grand battle. 
                In the ensuing battles, great magics were performed and many catastophic 
                effects plagued these lands. A good example of which, would be 
                the Hole. </p>
              <p>The Hole is a mysterious creation indeed. It was also a remarkable 
                find. Within the vast caverns created by the magical battles, 
                we found something very interesting. The Seekers call it the Vault. 
                &#133;.From what I can discern, the Vault is created from a living 
                stone. It was an artifact that was created by Brell Serelis to 
                seal the passageway that he had opened from the Plane of Underfoot 
                to Norrath. The Vault was to keep Norrath safe from some of the 
                more vicious denizens of the Plane of Underfoot. Something went 
                terribly wrong. During the Seekers investigation of the Vault, 
                they weakened its properties. In doing so, it released hordes 
                of Earthen Elementals into our fine city. Had Dartain not sacrificed 
                himself, we would surely be an extinct race. </p>
              <p>The Seekers developed a patch for the Vault, they sent Dartain 
                in to magically reseal the gateway. He was set upon by multiple 
                denizens of the Plane of Underfoot, and escaped into the Vault. 
                There, with full knowledge that he would be trapped, he magically 
                sealed the Vault once again, allowing us the freedom to create 
                the new city that you stand in now. The city which you live in 
                now, is New Paineel. The ruins of the old city are in the blight 
                we call the Hole. The old city was marvelous indeed. The one that 
                we have rebuilt barely captures the majesty that the old city 
                once bore. It is still quite remarkable even in its destruction, 
                however it is heavily guarded by the minions of the Underfoot. 
                The creatures that now call the old city home, are led by the 
                Earthen Lord Yael. He is a force to be reckoned with, as he commands 
                only the strongest of the elemental legions. Tread softly if you 
                see him, for he will not hesitate to take your life. </p>
              <p><i>The Escape of Dartain</i><br>
                Ognit Eznertob, Dabner Drednever and Dagda Icefury had spent the 
                last several days spelunking in the Hole and the ruins of the 
                old city of Paineel. The ruins were an eerie, dusty and dark place. 
                Strange and terrifying sounds echoed throughout the once splendorous 
                city, like wails of torment from souls suffering in eternal agony. 
                Though Ognit seemed unfazed by the atmosphere, Dabner and Dagda 
                were very skittish about their journey down into the Hole.</p>
              <p>Dabner swore that the sounds were none other than the ghosts 
                of Erudites slain during the Great War that destroyed the old 
                city years ago. Ognit hypothesized that the strange noises were 
                caused by undercurrents of wind wafting from the surface above 
                and were nothing to be concerned about. Dagda knew not the cause 
                of the sounds but she was sure that the three of them should not 
                be in that place. </p>
              <p>After spending some time exploring the ruins and wandering deeper 
                into the cavern, the three came across the very thing for which 
                Ognit had been searching. Before them stood The Hatch and the 
                wall of Living Stone. The Living Stone is an artifact of great 
                power created by Brell Serilis the purpose of which was to stop 
                the creatures from the Plane of the Underfoot from entering into 
                the world. The residents of the old city once conducted experiments 
                on the Living Stone, attempting to find a way to harness its power. 
                The experiments damaged the wall of Living Stone and creatures 
                began to breach the wall and threatened the city. The Erudites 
                constructed The Hatch; a sort of life support system that kept 
                the Living Stone strong after the earthen Lord Yael escaped and 
                threatened their destruction with his army of elementals.</p>
              <p>Ognit sought to study both The Hatch and the wall of Living Stone. 
                He felt that the Erudites were simply not qualified for that sort 
                of study and indeed it would take the delicate and careful touch 
                of a gnome to properly study the artifact and perhaps find a way 
                to harness its power. History has a way of repeating itself.</p>
              <p>Ognit considered the first of his experiments successful. He 
                found that the wall of Living Stone was able to release enormous 
                amounts of power, as evidenced by the tremendous earthquakes he 
                was able to cause simply by infusing the Hatch with just a small 
                amount of magical energy. Indeed, it seemed the two worked together 
                like a transformer, turning small amounts of energy into tremendous 
                surges of power. Though he had no idea how one could harness the 
                released energy, he was impressed with the results nonetheless.</p>
              <p>Dagda was terrified and believed that the gnome was tinkering 
                with powers beyond his comprehension. She threatened to leave 
                them both down there, particularly when the experiments began 
                to cause earthquakes of greater and greater magnitude. Against 
                her better judgement, she stayed. </p>
              <p>Ognit saw the greater earthquakes as a sign that his experiments 
                were going well. He was getting even better power output for the 
                same amount of energy. Dabner eventually began to become frightened 
                too and started to side with Dagda, urging the wizard to abandon 
                the experiment. Ognit was incensed and no amount of convincing 
                would deter him from his experimentation.</p>
              <p>Finally, the inevitable happened. Ognit channeled just a small 
                amount of energy into the Hatch. It wasn't much, not even enough 
                to kill a moss snake. However this time, the Living Wall began 
                to shudder spasmodically and took on a pale, sickly color. The 
                earthquake that resulted was truly terrifying. Chunks of stone 
                began falling from the ceiling and the ground itself began to 
                be ripped apart. From the huge gashes in the earth, the three 
                saw terrifying creatures emerge. All about them were sounds of 
                shrieking, crying and bellowing. The noises were both exclamations 
                of excitement for finally being<br>
                freed and rage for being imprisoned for such a long time. The 
                three began to flee the hole in terror as the creatures began 
                to swarm around them, their ears ringing from the unholy screams. 
              </p>
              <p>As they made haste toward the surface, they came across a figure 
                that looked to be an Erudite. The Erudite was walking slowly and 
                limping slightly. He was filthy, covered with dirt and soot. His 
                skin was pallid, as one who had not stood under the glare of harsh 
                sunlight for ages. He wore a robe that was a splotchy brownish 
                color. It was difficult to tell if this was the robe's original 
                color or if it was the result of the filth that covered it. He 
                turned quickly and upon seeing them, he spoke. &quot;Gnomes&#133; 
                And a Barbarian woman of all things! I don't know whether I should 
                thank you or draw the full sum of the life-force from your bodies 
                right here and now!&quot; Dagda pushed her way past the two gnomes, 
                putting herself between they and the Erudite. Facing the strange 
                man she asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot; He folded his arms across 
                his chest and smiled slightly. He raised an eyebrow as he spoke, 
                &quot;My name is Dartain of the Dark Truth. I don't suppose you 
                have any idea about what you have just done? Or perhaps I should 
                say undone, do you?&quot; </p>
              <p>He seemed to stare through their souls with eyes fierce yet lined 
                with weariness. &quot;Your meddling has caused the Wall of Living 
                Stone to weaken once again. Though your actions have finally allowed 
                me to break free after being trapped for so many a year, you have 
                also allowed many of the denizens that were imprisoned behind 
                that wall to escape into the world again as well.&quot;</p>
              <p>Even in the dim light, Ognit's face became visibly paled. Dartain 
                continued, &quot;The Hatch is still unharmed and appears to be 
                functioning as it should. I believe the wall will repair itself 
                again in time. While the breach remains however, there will be 
                a steady flow of creatures escaping from the underfoot. I suggest 
                you make haste out of this place and take warning to those above, 
                so that they may prepare themselves.&quot; As he finished speaking, 
                murky shadows made their way from the floor and encircled the 
                dirty robes the strange man wore. As he disappear from view he 
                softly muttered, &quot;Finally, I am free&#133;&quot;</p>
              <p>The trio said not a word to each other, and continued at a dead 
                sprint toward the surface as the sound of an army of creatures 
                rumbled directly behind them. Reaching the top of the ruins, they 
                held their breath as they jumped into the cold water and wriggled 
                their way with panicked speed through the rocky underwater cavern 
                that lead into the new city of Paineel.</p>
              <p>After emerging from the water, the first breath they took was 
                used to issue forth a scream of terror. All around them, terrible 
                creatures of rock and stone wandered in the open throughout the 
                streets of the new city of Paineel. Already, cries of alarm could 
                be heard being raised from deep within the bowels of the city. 
                Even more alarming was the fact that the earth still seemed to 
                be shaking, even after all this time. Dagda in an effort to warn 
                the Heretics of the impending danger shouted, &quot;Horrible creatures 
                from the earth have broken loose! Run for your lives!&quot; Dabner 
                exclaimed, &quot;Brell Serilis help us all! They are everywhere!&quot; 
                Dagda gave both gnomes a shove forward and yelled, &quot;Go! Run!&quot; 
                The three began at a dead run once again. She kept behind the 
                gnomes to make surethey were both still alive and running. As 
                he ran, Ognit smacked himself in the forehead screaming, &quot;Oh 
                gods! What have I done! Just keep running everyone!&quot;</p>
              <p>Guards Menbuknar and Heridion stood near the entrance to the 
                new city of Paineel. The pair of skeletal sentries stood staring 
                out over the grassy alcove through hollow eye sockets that were 
                long without flesh or blood watching over the new city of Paineel 
                in eternal service to their Heretic masters. &quot;Nooiiissseeey,&quot; 
                Menbuknar said with a quiet disembodied voice like sandpaper in 
                response to the sudden shouts. Guard Heridion took several steps 
                forward and pointed, &quot;Rooockssss.&quot; Hefting their swords 
                above their head, the two skeletal guards shambled clumsily out 
                into the courtyard and began to fight against the intruding earth 
                elementals.</p>
              <p>As he swung away against the creatures made from earth itself, 
                Menbuknar sniffed the air with a nose that wasn't there and rasped, 
                &quot;Gnoommmessss.&quot; Al`Kabor had been spending his time 
                researching in the Qeynos area. Though he preferred the superior 
                research facilities and libraries of Erudin, he found the locals 
                in the Qeynos area more then eager to assist him with trivial 
                errands for a trifling handful of coins. Indeed, labor was cheap 
                and the people generally hard working and honest in this law abiding 
                town. One such errand runner, a half elf, had just returned carrying 
                a vial full of a certain rare and difficult to obtain ink he was 
                sent to fetch. He flipped the half elf a gold piece and said, 
                &quot;You are dismissed&quot;. The errand boy looked at the coin, 
                smiled and then left Al`Kabor's flat happily. The ink was needed 
                for a scroll he was nearly finished scribing. He had run out of 
                the rare and precious ink just before he had completed his work 
                on the scroll. He very carefully uncorked the bottle and set it 
                upon the fine table of marble. Gently unrolling the precious scroll, 
                he smoothed it lovingly out on the cool surface of the stone table. 
                He dipped the quill, made from an enormous griffon feather, into 
                the ink. He put the pen to the parchment and began to once again 
                scribe the ancient runic symbols onto the parchment with slow 
                and deliberate care.</p>
              <p>It started lightly, almost imperceptibly. He first thought that 
                perhaps mobs of angry people were stomping up the stairs to his 
                flat. But suddenly, everything was shaking violently. Books began 
                to fall from their shelves; fine glassware fell to the ground 
                and smashed. Gripping the heavy marble table to keep his balance, 
                Al`Kabor watched in horror as the bottle of very expensive and 
                difficult to acquire ink rocked back and forth, rolled on its 
                side for a moment and then tipped over. Frozen in shock, he watched 
                as the ink spread out over the scroll. </p>
              <p>He slammed his fist onto the table as the realization dawned 
                upon him, &quot;Five days of work and components worth a mountain 
                of platinum pieces, ruined by yet another one of these damned 
                earthquakes!&quot; He grabbed the ruined scroll he had been laboring 
                upon for nearly a week, crumpled it up in his hand and tossed 
                it out his window. In crumpling the scroll, he had inadvertently 
                covered his hands with the ink. Another earthquake hit this one 
                more violent then the last. Stumbling a bit, he caught himself 
                on his coat rack in the corner of his study. The ink on his hands 
                smeared onto the robe that hung upon the rack. Throwing his hands 
                into the air he shouted, &quot;I've had enough!&quot; He wiped 
                his hands clean on the old robe and threw it out the window too. 
                Putting his best robe over his shoulders, he stomped downstairs 
                out of his flat and into the streets of Qeynos. Tramping through 
                the streets, he shouted, &quot;How can anyone get any work done 
                around here with all these earthquakes? This is completely unacceptable!&quot; 
                All around him, people were running and shouts of alarm filled 
                the streets. Walking toward the gates of the city, he was oblivious 
                to the broken glass on the ground and cracks in the fine stone 
                masonry, all evidence of the quake's severity. Enraged, he grabbed 
                a wood elf by the lapels as he tried to run past and yelled in 
                his face, &quot;You! Elf! What is causing these earthquakes? Hmm?&quot; 
                The elf looked back at him in fear and said nothing. &quot;Oh 
                why do I bother talking to one of your kind!&quot; Releasing him, 
                the elf ran away.</p>
              <p>Stepping through the city gates, he turned and inquired indignantly 
                to the heavily armored Paladin next to him, &quot;How am I supposed 
                to think when every five minutes I have the full contents of my 
                library on the floor, woman?&quot; The Paladin gave him a sideways 
                look, apparently offended, snorted to herself and then walked 
                back into the city shaking her head. &quot;Bah,&quot; he said 
                making a dismissive gesture behind the woman as she left. He began 
                walking down the path out of the city. The stones that made up 
                the<br>
                path were uneven, some raised up higher then others, no doubt 
                due to the earthquake. &quot;They should get someone to fix this,&quot; 
                Al`Kabor muttered to himself. </p>
              <p>Suddenly, he found his feet had sunk into the ground a good foot 
                or so and he was unable to walk. Surrounding him on four sides 
                were small creatures that appeared to be made of earth itself. 
                They grabbed at his robes and began pummeling him with their fists 
                of rock and dirt. Without even thinking, blinded by the sheer 
                audacity of these creatures to even dare assault the mighty Al`Kabor 
                and dirty his best robe, he begun to summon forth the magical 
                energy to unleash his wrath upon these creatures. The small elementals, 
                standing no taller then the shortest halfling, were each blasted 
                to bits by the sheer power of the energy released in all directions 
                by the mighty wizard. Clods of dirt and pebbles flying through 
                the air were the only evidence that the creatures were even there 
                a moment before.</p>
              <p>&quot;Why are these elementals all over the place?&quot; He pulled 
                his feet free from the ground and walked over to a cleric of Rodcet 
                Nife who was tending to another victim of the elemental attack 
                who faired far worse then the wizard. He asked, &quot;You! Cleric! 
                Did these elementals rise from the ground or did somebody summon 
                all of these?&quot; The cleric finished bandaging the wounded 
                traveler and said hurriedly, &quot;Sir, I have no idea. Excuse 
                me, many are hurt or in peril from this attack. I must take my 
                leave.&quot;</p>
              <p>Al`Kabor shouted to no one in particular, &quot;Bah! I'd gather 
                more information from a wall then I would from you people!&quot; 
                He continued to walk up the stone path. Here and there earth elementals 
                were assaulting folks outside the city in the hills of Qeynos. 
                The Jagged Pine Treefolk from Surefall Glade were on full alert. 
                The rangers and druids that called the glade home were doing their 
                best to stem the tide of the elemental invasion.</p>
              <p>Wandering the hills, Al`Kabor walked about blasting any elemental 
                he came across to kingdom come. He did this not in defense of 
                the hills nor for any sort of loyalty to the fine city of Qeynos 
                but more in retaliation for his days of lost work and as therapy 
                for the general feeling of rage and displeasure he was experiencing. 
                Today was not a good day at all and it was about to get much worse. 
                Al`Kabor was furious. He had lost nearly a week of hard work, 
                lost research components that were expensive and difficult to 
                find, had one of his favorite robes ruined and was assaulted by 
                a gang of small upstart earth elementals. His day was not going 
                well and was about to get worse.</p>
              <p>He took a walk to the hills outside of the city of Qeynos as 
                the elemental attack raged on and minor aftershocks from the huge 
                quake rattled the lands. He annihilated any of the earthen beasts 
                he came across. He did this not in defense of the hills nor for 
                any sort of loyalty to Qeynos but more in retaliation for his 
                days of lost work and as therapy for the general feeling of rage 
                and displeasure he was experiencing that day.</p>
              <p>In the distance he heard people calling out his name. &quot;Good, 
                perhaps now I will have some answers,&quot; he thought to himself. 
                Walking back toward the city he saw a crowd of people running 
                quickly toward him. &quot;Al`Kabor! There are two gnomes and a 
                barbarian woman that are looking for you. They said it is very 
                important,&quot; they told him. Al`Kabor muttered, &quot;Them. 
                It figures.&quot; Then loudly he said, &quot;Very well. Take me 
                to them,&quot; he made a shooing gesture with his hands, as if 
                to push the commoners along. He followed the crowd back to the 
                gates of Qeynos. There he saw the barbarian warrior, Dagda Icefury. 
                With her were the gnomes, Ognit Eznertob and Dabner Drednever. 
                Upon laying eyes upon the wizard, they ran right up to him. Their 
                voices were panicked and they were all talking. &quot;We have 
                terrible news!&quot; &quot;Odus is in danger!&quot; &quot;There 
                was this wall and things from the ground and&#133;.&quot; &quot;Something 
                went wrong!&quot; &quot;I didn't mean to do it!&quot; &quot;They 
                were everywhere! It was terrible and&#133;&quot; Al`Kabor said, 
                &quot;One at a time please.&quot; He waited, and still their frantic 
                raving continued. Finally he screamed as loudly as he possibly 
                could, &quot;Quit talking all at once!&quot;</p>
              <p>The three stopped suddenly. The wizard Ognit spoke. &quot;I'll 
                tell him. This was all my fault anyway.&quot; Rolling his eyes 
                Al`Kabor said, &quot;Speak then, gnome.&quot; Ognit began, &quot;Well, 
                we were all down in the ruins of Old Paineel. In the Hole. And 
                you remember that Wall of Living Flesh that is way down there? 
                Looks like a big face, you know?&quot; Al`Kabor balled his fists 
                at his side. &quot;Fool. Tell me that you were not meddling with 
                The Wall!&quot; Ognit smiled sheepishly and continued, &quot;Well 
                yes. Actually I was to tell you the truth. I came across some 
                writings that told of how your ancestors were trying to find a 
                way to harness the power of that artifact and I thought that I 
                would try to continue that research.&quot; Al`Kabor spat, &quot;Ingrate! 
                My ancestors were not Heretics! I've slew hundreds of those fools 
                during the Great War so many years ago!&quot; He glared at Ognit, 
                his eyes flashing with a hideous fury. &quot;You are no better 
                then they it seems!&quot;</p>
              <p>Al`Kabor's hands began glowing with a deep red color and the 
                sudden updraft of wind that swirled around them revealed the immensity 
                of the power the wizard had at his disposal. The hairs on the 
                back of Ognit's neck stood on end as the energy began to course 
                and build around him. Ognit winced, expecting to be blasted to 
                bits. Al`Kabor took a deep breath and the energy that was gathered 
                from the sheer rage of the mighty wizard dissipated. &quot;Fool! 
                Continue.&quot; Dagda turned a worried gaze upon the wizard, her 
                hand slowly moving to her sword, just in case. Dabner fidgeted 
                nervously, shuffling his feet and wringing his gnomish hands. 
                &quot;Wow Al, you're really mad about this aren't you.&quot; Ignoring 
                the last few stressful moments completely Ognit said, &quot;Ehem, 
                yes. So anyway, I found that if I infused that Hatch thing that's 
                attached to the wall with just the tiniest bit of magical energy 
                it would act like a transformer and release HUGE amounts of power!&quot;</p>
              <p>Al`Kabor clenched both of his fists and relaxed them once again. 
                &quot;For your information gnome, that Hatch 'thing' you speak 
                of was put in place to protect the Wall of Living Stone and to 
                keep it alive and healthy!&quot; Al`Kabor continued, &quot;The 
                Heretics damaged the wall of Living Stone by trying to do the 
                very same experiments! After they damaged it they put the Hatch 
                in place to keep the wall alive and strong. The Hatch and the 
                Wall of Living Stone prevent the creatures that inhabit the Plane 
                of Underfoot from entering the<br>
                world ever again. Your meddling has obviously weakened both.&quot; 
                Ognit nodded and said, &quot;Well yes, of course. My experiments 
                were going really well and I managed to get an amazing power output 
                on my last attempt. That's when things turned badly.&quot;</p>
              <p>Al`Kabor put the back of his hand to his forehead and asked in 
                a tired voice, &quot;So you damaged the Living Stone, weakened 
                the Hatch and suddenly you were surrounded by denizens of the 
                underfoot breaking loose and running pell-mell to the surface 
                correct?&quot; &quot;Well&#133; That's about right,&quot; Ognit 
                answered. &quot;No doubt those creatures were all waiting with 
                baited breath for the moment the wall would be weakened sufficiently 
                allowing for their escape again. I'm sure they were alerted the 
                moment you've begun this madness,&quot; the wizard hypothesized.</p>
              <p>Dabner raised his hand. The diminutive cleric of Brell Serilis 
                said, &quot;Ognit, tell him about that Dartain guy. He seemed 
                pretty nice, except for that bit about draining our life force 
                and stuff.&quot; Al`Kabor turned a murderous glare upon the gnome, 
                &quot;Gods strike me dead now!&quot; His voice dripping with sarcasm 
                and spite he ordered, &quot;Yes Ognit, please tell me about Dartain!&quot;</p>
              <p>Rather large crowds of people had gathered around the group and 
                were listening intently to the discussion. One person in particular, 
                another Erudite, seemed very interested in what was being discussed. 
                So interested in fact, that he was writing furiously in a small 
                booklet apparently recording every word that was said. Ognit said 
                nervously, &quot;Yes, well&#133; This Dartain fellow was an Erudite, 
                like you.&quot; Noticing the anger of Al`Kabor building again 
                upon the comparison, Ognit corrected himself. &quot;No! I take 
                that back! He was nothing like you actually. Not like you&#133; 
                Uhh, he was kind of spooky though. Not like you're not scary yourself.&quot; 
                Ognit stopped and stammered, &quot;Umm. I didn't mean that like 
                it sounded. Let me start over. Ok&#133; So this Dartain guy was 
                an Erudite.&quot; Al`Kabor took in breath as the name was repeated 
                and his teeth ground audibly. Ognit laughed nervously and then 
                said, &quot;Yes. So he said he was trapped for a long time in 
                the Plane of Underfoot but he seemed really happy to finally be 
                out of there. On the bright side, he told me that The Living Wall 
                would heal itself in time. And he said that The Hatch was still 
                functioning properly. So everything should be ok.&quot; Ognit 
                smiled, &quot;You see, no harm done! A few days and everything 
                should be back to normal!&quot; </p>
              <p>Al`Kabor was utterly silent and his face expressionless. A slight 
                twitch in the corner of his mouth was his only movement. Ognit 
                asked, &quot;Al`Kabor?&quot; Al`Kabor raised his fist, his eyes 
                flashing in murderous rage as he looked upon the gnome, &quot;Now 
                I shall end your miserable gnomish life!&quot; Wind charged with 
                electricity seemed to blow directly up from the ground itself 
                and enveloped the crowd as the wizard's hands began to glow with 
                sheer power. People began to take a few tentative steps backward.</p>
              <p>At those words, the Erudite that was writing quickly put his 
                book in his vest pocket and interposed himself between the gnome 
                and Al`Kabor. The Erudite shouted, &quot;Stay your hand wizard! 
                I shall take it from here!&quot;</p>
              <p>The wind subsided as the energy drained away harmlessly. Al`Kabor 
                recognized the man that shouted and he smiled to himself. Ognit 
                saw that it wasn't a good smile. It was a smile that told him 
                that it might have been better to have been blasted to bits. The 
                man identified himself. &quot;I am Warden Lius of Erudin. I have 
                been following these three since this catastrophe began!&quot; 
                He turned to the gnome and said in a commanding voice, &quot;Ognit 
                Eznertob! You are hereby under arrest for the crime of treason! 
                You have imperiled the continent of Odus and have released unto 
                the world a heinous criminal, the heretic of old Dartain!&quot;</p>
              <p>The Warden bound Ognit's hands and feet in heavy chains. &quot;I 
                doubt that there will be need for a trial. By your own admission 
                made here this day, it is evident that you are guilty. Surely 
                it will be 'The Hollowing' for you.&quot; Pushing the gnome roughly 
                he commanded, &quot;Move along criminal!&quot;</p>
              <p>As Ognit was led away, Dagda was surprised to find tears falling 
                from her face. She knew that Ognit was guilty, yet she was not 
                sure if execution was the just course of punishment in this situation. 
                As a follower of The Tribunal, she was torn between her notions 
                of justice and her loyalty and vow to protect her two gnomish 
                friends. Indeed, she would rather that it was she who was being 
                led away. At least she may have had the strength to break free 
                and perhaps escape. She knew that the physically weak gnome would 
                have no such chance and given that the Erudites are the most experienced 
                and<br>
                schooled in the use of magic, she had no doubt that they would 
                take every precaution to prevent his casting any spell. She felt 
                truly hopeless.</p>
              <p>Dagda wiped her eyes and brought herself up to her full height. 
                She asked Al`Kabor, &quot;Who is this Dartain?&quot; Al`Kabor 
                answered, &quot;Dartain is one of the heretics. A heretic ofold. 
                He was among those that put The Hatch in place to repair the Wall 
                of Living Stone. Through his own misfortune, he managed to get 
                sealed on the other side of the wall in the Underfoot, while his 
                companions were slaughtered to a man. He was able to complete 
                the ritual from the Underfoot side and The Hatch was put in place 
                successfully. The Underfoot was sealed off from the rest of the 
                world and the danger ended. Everyone assumed he was dead afterward, 
                of course.&quot;</p>
              <p>Dagda looked confused and stated; &quot;He is certainly not dead. 
                We saw him this day with our very eyes. Though he appeared pale 
                and weak, I know that hot blood filled his veins. By what magic 
                is he still alive after all this time?&quot; Al`Kabor looked up 
                for a moment thoughtfully. He then hypothesized, &quot;The Altered 
                Planes are much different from our world here. It is indeed possible 
                that by virtue of the elder magics that course throughout all 
                of the Underfoot and the other Planes, that mortals age differently 
                there.&quot; Then he added, more to himself then to anyone else, 
                &quot;No doubt the Heretics will gain in strength with his release 
                and I will not stand idly by while this happens. I must go and 
                prepare. I can not allow Dartain to remain in this realm while 
                I draw breath.&quot; Al`Kabor stopped for a moment and stroking 
                his chin reflectively said, &quot;Perhaps some good will come 
                of this. Maybe the denizens of the Underfoot will finally destroy 
                the heretics in Paineel before The Living Wall is able to heal 
                itself.&quot; He then walked away back through the city gates. 
              </p>
              <p>Dabner grabbed Dagda by the hand and cried, &quot;Oh Dagda, what 
                are we going to do? What about Ognit and Odus and Dartain and 
                everything!&quot; Dagda was numb. &quot;I don't know Dabner. I 
                am at a loss and I can not think.&quot; Dagda began to walk into 
                Qeynos through the gates leaving Dabner behind. Her sword hung 
                limply in her hand. &quot;Dagda! Where are you going,&quot; he 
                asked running after her. She turned and facing him said, &quot;I 
                am returning to Toxxulia forest. I intend to fight the beasts 
                from the earth and to try to keep them at bay until that wall 
                is able to repair itself. Perhaps some combat will help to clear 
                my head.&quot; Together both entered the city, making a beeline 
                for the docks to book passage to the continent of Odus.<br>

              The Iksar are an intelligent race of lizardmen inhabiting various 
              locales on the continent of Kunark. They were created by the god 
              Cazic-Thule during the Elder Age and began a tribal existence on 
              Kunark thousands of years in Norrath's past. They eventually united 
              to form a massive empire which later collapsed for the most part, 
              leaving an intricate and proud history as well as a rich setting 
              for adventurers to explore.</p>
            <p>The Iksar have a history that most races would consider evil in 
              nature, in that conquest, enslavement, and general war and destruction 
              were the norm. With that said, there are those who have chosen not 
              to blindly follow in the path of their ancestors and are more or 
              less neutral in their views of the world and its inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The Iksar have an interesting and unique variation of classes available 
              to them due to their unique history and circumstances. Being currently 
              in a tribal setting limits their general mystic abilities to being 
              shamans, yet the fallen Iksar Empire's rich history and knowledge 
              of necromancy also allows them to choose the path of the necromancer 
              or shadowknight. It also offers them a special opportunity until 
              now limited only to the human race, and that is the ability to become

              Following the creation of the dwaves, elves, and kedge on Norrath 
              to watch over the then Dragon-dominated earth in the Elder Age, 
              the Elves drew the unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate. 
              In a decrepit tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the 
              Plane over which he ruled, Innoruuk waited, stoking the fire of 
              his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He cursed his fellow gods 
              for not including him in their pact and vowed to make them regret 
              such disrespect. From the halls of the Elves' fair city, Takish-Hiz, 
              the Prince of Hate snatched away the first Elven King and Queen. 
              In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them apart, physically 
              and mentally, over the course of three hundred years. He then gathered 
              the quivering remnants of these beings of light and rebuilt them 
              into his own dark sadistic image, a twisted mockery of Tunare's 
              noble children. In depositing the Teir'Dal, as Innoruuk's Dark Elven 
              creations would come to be called, back into the Underfoot of Norrath, 
              the seeds for The Prince of Hate's final revenge were sown.</p>
            <p>Followers of Innoruuk include nearly the entire Dark Elven race 
              who regard him as their &quot;Father.&quot; They believe that Hate 
              is a creative force, or rather &quot;THE&quot; creative force in 
              the universe: creativity born of destruction. Love and kindness 
              are tools for those too ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly 
              to do what is necessary to obtain it. It is only through the total 
              disdain of your enemies that you can gain true power over them. 
              Pity and mercy have no power when confronted with contempt and viciousness. 
              It is the honest belief of the followers of Innoruuk that if they 
              were to hate strong enough they could destroy all of Norrath. (The

              to defeat the Iskar, leading the newly formed Ring of Scale. These 
              dragons included Trakenon, Talendor, Gornaire, Severian, Nagafen

              Dwarven King of old.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The dwarven king Grimmly Fireforge, an excellent fighter and 
                brilliant military tactician, began to assemble a defensive force 
                against Dagnor, the Ogre warlord. Dagnor also did not anticipate 
                the speed by which the dwarves could gather into a force large 
                enough to repel his own. It was the warlord's first mistake. </p>
              <p> When the army of ogres reached the Crakthorn ridge, just one 
                mile from the capital city of Kaladim, they were met by an equally 
                large force of dwarves lead by king Grimmly. The fighting on the 
                ridge was savage and brutal, but being less skilled at fighting 
                in tight tunnels and with low light then the dwarves, the ogres 
                were forced to flee. Dagnor ordered his army into the hills of 
                shade where the dwarves and ogres could fight on equal ground. 
              </p>
              <p> Day and night the battle raged across the hills of shade above 
                the lesser faydark and the grass was bleached red with the blood 
                of the fallen. Both armies were fueled by soldiers from their 
                respective kingdoms and soon the war had ground into a stalemate. 
              </p>
              <p> <i>Of the orcan betrayal and the battle of the shattered spear: 
                </i><br>
                Thinking that the war would either be won or lost on the hills 
                of shade, Dagnor ordered his southern most forces guarding the 
                forest of lesser Faydark to move north and add more strength to 
                the army in the hills. He left instead a handful of ogre soldiers 
                and mostly a host of orcan slaves. It was Dagnor's second and 
                most fatal mistake. </p>
              <p> For the first time in history dwarves and orcs came to an agreement 
                and entered in on an alliance. The dwarves promised the orcan 
                slaves of the defeated orcan clans their freedom if they would 
                not interfere in the war in favor of both sides. Completely in 
                favor with the plan, which gave the orcs freedom but did not require 
                them to fight, the orcan slaves retreated from lesser faydark 
                to the east, deserting the armies of Dagnor and leaving the southern 
                hills wide open. King Grimmly took this opportunity to assemble 
                a second force to the south and then attacked Dagnor's army from 
                both the front and the undefended flank. The ogre forces on the 
                hills of shade were demolished. Dagnor fled with few others and 
                the Rakthokian kingdom was now completely vulnerable. Grimmly 
                gathered his remaining forces and headed straight for the ogre 
                capital, leveling any fortresses he came to and burning Rakthok 
                to the ground. The Rakthokian army had been broken. </p>
              <p> The last official battle took place beneath the forest of Lesser 
                Faydark as the remaining ogre forces, lead by Dagnor, attempted 
                to flee to the south. They were met there by a small force of 
                vengeful dwarven soldiers who were able to hold them off until 
                the arrival of the main dwarven host. When King Grimmly and his 
                army arrived, the forces of Dagnor fought viciously and were able 
                to kill many, but were ultimately defeated. A story tells that 
                Grimmly and Dagnor met eachother face to face on the shores of 
                a lake to the south of lesser faydark during one of these fights, 
                and that Grimmly stabbed Dagnor with a spear with such intensity 
                and ferociousness that the weapon shattered into thousands of 
                pieces even as it cut straight through the ogre lord's chest. 
                The story goes on to say that the warlord fell to his death immediately 
                in that same lake and that the evil in his blood made the water 
                boil and turn red. Thus the dwarves mockingly renamed the lake 
                Dagnor's Cauldron and thus the final battle of the ogre-dwarven 
                war was called &quot;the battle of the shattered spear.&quot;

                attacks the Forces of HighKeep</i><br>
                Lord Tephys of the Koada`Dal and Carson McCabe of Highkeep stared 
                at each other with long faces over the council table in Highkeep. 
                The meetings were not going well. Upon hearing of the Teir`Dal's 
                plans of conquest, Tephys had immediately dispatched word to Felwithe 
                petitioning help. He had yet to hear a reply. Carson's biggest 
                problem in drafting forces for Highkeep was that most of the merchant 
                lords on the council were just that, merchants. They spoke endlessly 
                of buying their way out of the fight, that the goblin was lying, 
                or that they should just cut their losses and leave. Carson and 
                Tephys suffered no delusions. They knew that the Teir`Dal would 
                not bargain, and those that surrendered were doomed to a quick 
                death at best, with a long life of torture and servitude being 
                the alternative. 
              <p>&quot;Have we received any word from Antonius Bayle yet?&quot; 
                Tephys asked not for the first time since the council had convened. 
              <p> &quot;I'm afraid that my messengers have returned with the same 
                news we expected Lord Tephys,&quot; Carson explained. &quot;He 
                cannot lend us much support, if any, in our struggle. He is afraid, 
                and with good reason, that were he to make any attempt to do so, 
                the rival factions in and around Qeynos would be quick to take 
                advantage of the city. He envisions everything from the gnolls 
                of Blackburrow overrunning the city to the Bloodsabers taking 
                it from underneath him. And the sad thing is, I can't really say 
                I blame him.&quot; 
              <p> &quot;What of Freeport?&quot; asked Taliman Yurick, the leader 
                of the city's brewing merchants. &quot;Surely they're in the best 
                position to help us, practically bordering Nektulos and all.&quot; 
              <p> &quot;Freeport is in no position to help us either,&quot; Lord 
                Tephys pointed out. &quot;The Militia and the Paladins keep each 
                other in check constantly. Both know that if either were to support 
                us the other side would only use it as an excuse to try and take 
                complete control of the city. No my friends, I'm afraid it looks 
                like both of the great cities of Antonica will not be aiding us 
                in this fight. And we can count the dwarves out as well. As I 
                suspected, my emissaries to King Kazon were met only by the damned 
                dwarven logic of, 'all the more reason we should stay here and 
                prepare to defend the shores of Butcherblock'.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;I too, have contacted my people across the sea,&quot; 
                spoke Pracil Micus of the Erudites. They have agreed only to bring 
                it up in the next High Council meeting for discussion, at which 
                point they may decide to send some sort of help.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;Great!&quot; shouted Thubir Axebringer. The prominent 
                dwarven smith from Kaladim jumped up from his seat fuming, &quot;The 
                way ye blasted Erudites discuss things in yer meetins we should 
                be getting help just about this time next decade!&quot; Indignant,

                suppose I should expect such manners from a&#133;.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;SILENCE!&quot; bellowed Carson as he banged his gavel 
                upon the table. &quot;I'll have no bickering between us, especially 
                at a time like this. You think the Teir`Dal are fighting over 
                which of them are going to attack us? No. They're not because 
                they ALL want to attack. And if the stories I've heard of late 
                are indeed true, that the Teir`Dal have indeed united under this 
                prophet, this 'child of hate', then we may not just be facing 
                a few Teir`Dal war parties, but rather the whole of Neriak itself!&quot; 
              <p> &quot;But Carson!&quot; Taliman protested, &quot;If what you're 
                saying is true then we're doomed already. We have no armies save 
                the guard of Highkeep, no allies to call upon, and all against 
                an entire nation of Dark Elves!&quot; 
              <p>&quot;Perhaps you are not alone as you think, my friends,&quot; 
                said a voice from the crowd. Two high elves stepped forward, resplendent 
                in their ornate armor. One was an older male with lines of battle 
                etched into his face, the other a younger female with the beauty 
                of a goddess herself. Both appeared to be a bit travel worn but 
                fully armed. Lord Tephys stood, an obvious wave of relief flashing 
                across his face. &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen of the council, allow 
                me to introduce Galeth Veredeth, High Paladin of Tunare and chief 
                advisor to King Tearis Thex.&quot; 
              <p>The members of the council were impressed and quickly invited 
                the newcomers to join their meeting. 
              <p> Thank you Tephys my old friend,&quot; Galeth said with a look 
                of sympathy for the tired elven Lord. &quot;The young lady accompanying 
                me is Firiona Vie, Paladin of Tunare and my finest student yet.&quot;</p>
              <p> Firiona bowed politely to the table saying, &quot;The honor 
                is mine your lordships.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;Ah yes!&quot; said Tephys with sudden recognition. &quot;You 
                have truly grown in the grace of Tunare since last I saw you young 
                Firiona, we welcome you to our table. Now&#133;please tell me 
                you bring good news Galeth.&quot; </p>
              <p>&quot;Indeed I do,&quot; replied the Paladin. &quot;I'm pleased 
                to announce that the entirety of the Paladins of Tunare are at 
                your disposal.&quot; </p>
              <p>Cheers erupted from the council and the crowd. Galeth holds up 
                his hand for silence and continues, &quot;As we speak our legions 
                are sailing across the Ocean of Tears and should arrive in a fortnight. 
                The remainder of the Fier`Dal forces shall have to remain in Faydark 
                however, as we are constantly besieged by the orcs of Crushbone. 
                This is all King Tearis can spare. The only stipulation we insist 
                upon is that Lord Tephys lead the armies defending Highkeep.&quot; 
              <p> Lord Tephys attempted to argue against this at first, but was 
                quickly and unanimously outvoted as the entire council, led by 
                Carson McCabe, insisted that it was a grand idea. A messenger 
                stepped forward and whispered something in Carson's ear. Carson 
                stood up with a smile on his face and spoke, &quot;In addition 
                to this most fortunate news, I've just been informed that adventurers 
                from all over Norrath are volunteering by the dozens to aid our 
                cause!&quot; Again the crowd and council are swept away by rampant 
                cheers of thanks. 
              <p> Lord Tephys once again stood and addressed everyone. &quot;With 
                that said gentlemen, I believe this council is adjourned. We all 
                have a lot of plans to make and little time to spare. By the grace 
                of Tunare, we just might have a chance.&quot; All throughout Antonica, 
                forces prepared for war. Quartermasters scrambled to equip hastily 
                recruited troops. Men, both military and mundane, trained and 
                practiced diligently on both sides for what would surely be a 
                terrible war. Anyone who could carry a weapon, carried one during 
                those days for none knew when the army of dark elves would advance.
              <p> The Teir`Dal likewise prepared. They were confident that they 
                would be successful. Indeed, they had the blessing of Innoruuk 
                and his very daughter Lanys T`Vyl to lead them. Together with 
                her mentor Laarthik K`Shin, the two would lead their great army 
                against the forces of High Keep further increasing the strength 
                of the nation of Teir`Dal and dividing the two cities Qeynos and 
                Freeport, setting up a stranglehold upon the races of light.
              <p> The morning was rainy and cold when the dark elves began their 
                march. Lead by Laarthik K`Shin and Lanys T`Vyl, the hordes of 
                Teir`Dal were a consuming fire upon the common lands. Platoons 
                of Teir`Dal broke off to crush the rag-tag bands of allied forces 
                that rose up to stop their advancement. Regardless of the opposition 
                they faced, Lanys and Laarthik pushed forward toward their goal. 
                All around the sounds of war rang out, metal against metal, battle 
                cries and screams of the dying.
              <p> As the army approached Kithicor forest, a rear guard was left 
                behind to prevent the advancement of any of the races of light 
                through the common lands. It was then that the army began to spread 
                throughout Kithicor forest like wine spilled from a goblet. Slinking 
                through the forest, a group of 30 Teir`Dal crept into Rivervale. 
                They struck quickly. The peaceful halfling city was occupied and 
                subjugated under the brutal heel of the dark elven oppressors 
                with little to no resistance. The Teir`Dal raided the shops and 
                took whatever meager wealth the Halflings had. The new rulers 
                of Rivervale quickly struck down any that resisted.
              <p> As the army continued to work its way through the forest, they 
                met with heavier resistance as the allied races of light sprang 
                from their hiding places, ambushing the Dark Elves. Battles erupted 
                in every corner of the forest. As quickly as a Teir`Dal was struck 
                down, another came forward to take his place. As soon as a Teir`Dal 
                platoon would survive one ambush, they would be ambushed yet again. 
                Both armies were relentless. Neither side could tell who was winning. 
                The smell of death and of blood began to replace the usually fragrant 
                smells of the forest.
              <p> Lord Tephys, Galeth Veredeth and Firiona Vie waited just outside 
                the entrance to High Pass with the assembled forces of the Paladins 
                of Tunare and all others that were willing to assist them. The 
                situation was very grave. The armies approach was heralded by 
                a stampede of frightened animals all scurrying in fear of the 
                approaching dark elven menace. It was shortly thereafter that 
                they began to hear the sound of marching boots, the clang of weapons, 
                and the rattle of armor peppered with the occasional scream approaching 
                through the forest.
              <p> It was there, near the entrance to High Pass that the leaders 
                of the two armies met, face to face. The forest seemed to groan 
                and the very earth trembled. Cruel laughter was heard echoing 
                through the trees. Lord Tephys raised his mailed fist into the 
                air and swore aloud, &quot;By the grace of The Mother, you will 
                be stopped Child of Hate! Your cursed army shall go no farther.&quot;
              <p> Lanys's derisive laughter seemed supernaturally loud as it rang 
                out, almost hurting the ears of those around her, &quot;Old fool, 
                you feel such hate for me and in that I am glad. This only proves 
                the strength of my father and his power! However, the hate you 
                hold for me is nothing compared to the loathing I have for you 
                and your kind. Prepare to feel the full force of the power that 
                is Hate itself!&quot;
              <p> With those words, the two armies clashed. Lanys seemed to close 
                the gap between herself and Lord Tephys in a single leap and struck 
                at the old Paladin with a viscous fury. Like a hammer upon an 
                anvil, Lanys's swords struck again and again against the upraised 
                shield of Lord Tephys. The Paladin struggled valiantly under the 
                harsh blows of the Child of Hate. The attacks were relentless 
                and only seemed to become more violent as they continued. Finally, 
                the shield of the old Paladin failed him and Lanys landed a blow 
                squarely upon the aged shoulder of the holy fighter. Dropping 
                his shield, he staggered backward, holding his wound. He whispered 
                for aid from Tunare, and his hand glowed a soft blue as the wound 
                healed. He smiled to himself as he felt the love of The Mother. 
                His smile quickly faded as he looked up to see Lanys's hands glowing 
                as well, a cruel smile upon her face.
              <p> Shouting out words in Ancient Teir`Dal, Lanys made a sweeping 
                gesture toward her enemy. Great streams of magical energy coursed 
                from her outstretched hands and enveloped the High Elf. Lord Tephys 
                clutched at his chest as his whole body was wracked with incredible 
                pain. Stunned from the sudden and unexpected blow, Lord Tephys 
                failed to block as Lanys struck a final terrible blow. Lord Tephys 
                fell quietly to the ground and into the bosom of the Great Mother.
              <p> Meanwhile, a much different battle was being waged. Two seasoned 
                fighters, leaders of men, squared off against each other. Laarthik 
                K`Shin and Galeth Veredeth circled one another in a deadly ballet 
                of thrusts and parries. Both were opponents of equal skill, but 
                Laarthik, through the dark power he practiced, had the body of 
                a young man. Galeth, though in excellent physical shape for his 
                age, was still very old.
              <p> Lowering his guard ever so slightly, Laarthik allowed Galeth 
                to bash him square in the chin with his shield. Striking like 
                a serpent, Laarthik's hand shot forward enveloped in a blaze of 
                fiery magical energy. Stepping inward and snaking his blazing 
                hand under the upraised arm and the High Paladin's shield, Laarthik 
                touched the chest of the Galeth. The fire left the hand of the 
                Teir`Dal and enveloped his mortal enemy.
              <p> A cry of shock and pain erupted from the lips of the elder fighter. 
                But with a speed one would not expect from an old man, he quickly 
                jumped back and laid his hand upon his blistered and still smoldering 
                skin. The wound disappeared completely though the smell of burning 
                flesh still hung heavy in the air.
              <p> Galeth smiled briefly at his mortal enemy and laughed, &quot;It 
                appears we are still even my worthy adversary.&quot; Then, feigning 
                surprise, he raised his eyebrows and taunted, &quot;Oh wait, I 
                see your lip is bleeding now! Perhaps it is I who have the upper 
                hand!&quot; They resumed their deadly dance.
              <p> As Lord Tephys fell Firiona Vie moved to assist him but she 
                quickly realized that she was too late to save her companion. 
                Lanys T`Vyl sprung upon Firiona like a hunting cat after its prey. 
                Firiona was surprised by the uninhibited fury of Lanys T`Vyl and 
                by the sheer strength of her blows. Shifting her weight she dug 
                the side of her foot firmly into the ground in a back stance as 
                she began to parry the fierce thrusts and savage slashes of Innoruuk's 
                chosen.
              <p> Again and again, Lanys's weapons struck down upon Firiona's 
                shield and sword. Unlike Lord Tephys, she was able withstand the 
                force of her attacks. She did not forget the training she received 
                from her mentor Galeth. She realized the importance of remaining 
                calm and levelheaded during combat. Firiona and Lanys were polar 
                opposites on the field of combat. Lanys foamed at the mouth and 
                struck viscously while Firiona was calm, almost relaxed, as she 
                turned aside her blows. Biding her time and saving her strength, 
                Firiona simply parried the blows of Lanys T`Vyl.
              <p> Laarthik and Galeth continued their deadly ballet, but Galeth's 
                old body grew weak. Little by little, he felt himself loosing 
                his edge. He began to realize that this was a battle that he could 
                not win. He resolved himself to hold off Laarthik for as long 
                as possible, regardless of the outcome.<br>
                As Lanys's attack continued against Firiona, the Chosen of Tunare 
                noticed the fury begin to fade just a bit from the dark elf's 
                strikes. In a single fluid motion, the Paladin parried both of 
                her opponent's blades downward with her single sword as she circled 
                swiftly to the side of Lanys. Swinging her shield in a back handed 
                motion as she spun, she struck Lanys brutally in the back of the 
                head, pushing her off balance momentarily.
              <p> Though surprised and dazed by the sudden attack, Lanys regained 
                her composure in time to turn aside the deadly sword thrust that 
                was aimed directly for her midsection. Firiona took the offensive. 
                This time it was she who struck again and again, with Lanys continually 
                backing up under the force of her blows. 
              <p> Swarms of tiny insects descended upon the battle and the ground 
                began to tremble at the Great Mother's displeasure. Firiona seemed 
                to grow in stature and her golden hair began to shine brilliantly 
                as she was filled with the love of the Mother and surrounded by 
                her protection. She waged her battle against the chosen of Innoruuk 
                without mercy, making known the full displeasure of Tunare.
              <p> Lanys weakened and faltered under the righteous anger. Her eyes, 
                once a blaze of hate and fury, were now glazed and filled with 
                exhaustion. Defending herself grimly, she called out, &quot;Laarthik, 
                please help me!&quot; Hearing the cry of help from his student 
                and the chosen of his race and god, Laarthik was filled with a 
                new found rage. Roaring like a lion, he drove the pummel of his 
                sword straight across and onto the temple of the tiring Galeth 
                Veredeth. The savage blow was too much for the High Paladin of 
                Tunare. Galeth, for the first time in his long life, fell before 
                an opponent on the field of battle, bleeding and unconscious. 
              <p> Seeing the gravity of the situation, Laarthik pulled the large 
                glowing blue sphere found by the goblin Nurgal, from beneath his 
                breastplate. The orb glowing brightly pulsed and vibrated in Laarthik's 
                hands. The air resonated and hummed with energy. Holding the orb 
                to the sky, he cried out in a strangled voice, &quot;Innoruuk! 
                In the name of Lanys T`Vyl, I beseech you! Attend her!&quot; The 
                energy contained within the orb was released.
              <p> The screams of ten thousand damned souls filled the world as 
                an immeasurable power opened a rift in the astral barrier. The 
                hearts of even the most evil and twisted creatures in Norrath 
                were suddenly filled with dread and fear from the terrible evil 
                that spewed forth from the Plane of Hate. Laarthik's borrowed 
                body was encased in a pillar of fire emanating from the orb, as 
                the energies of Innoruuk were unleashed. Nothing can withstand 
                the presence of a god and Laarthik's body was quickly torn apart 
                by the mighty power.
              <p> Lanys tossed her head and laughed. She shouted out in welcome 
                to the power of Innoruuk. Her body ignited with crimson flame 
                as she was drawn upward by the Prince of Hate, her father. The 
                Child of Hate disappeared into the swirling rift in the sky as 
                the remains of Laarthik crumpled to the ground. A tremendous roar 
                rose up from the very heart of Norrath. Firiona Vie stared in 
                dismay and shock as Lanys was swept into the Heart of Hate, dread 
                filling her eyes with angry tears. The Chosen of Tunare called 
                out to those around her as her heart was overcome by terror, &quot;Flee! 
                Flee for your lives! Doom approaches!&quot;
              <p> Firiona rushed to Galeth's side and cried, &quot;This is a portent 
                of death! None can survive the Hate Innoruuk will cast upon us!&quot; 
                She helped her fallen mentor struggle to his feet and together, 
                they both fled the scene of the calamity. A vacuous wave of hopelessness 
                and dread withered the souls of all in Kithicor as sight was ripped 
                from their eyes from Innoruuk's presence. Hearts beating rapidly 
                in fear suddenly stopped. In an instant, the terrible clamor of 
                war was replaced by an unnatural silence. All life in the forest, 
                whether dark elf, ally, or animal, was instantly extinguished.
              <p> And so ended the Battle of Bloody Kithicor. Both sides suffered 
                terrible losses. The allied forces held what was probably the 
                most somber &quot;victory&quot; party in history at High Pass. 
                The Dark Elves retreated to Neriak. The once quiet, silvan forest 
                that was filled with relatively peaceful woodland creatures had 
                been forever tainted. To this day, Kithicor is haunted by the 
                restless souls of the fallen soldiers that perished during that 
                terrible war. The world was never the same.</p>

            <p><b>Kunark</b><br>
              Kunark has been the home of the dragons since ancient times. A race 
              of intelligent snake men, the Shissar, once ruled the land, until 
              a great plague wiped them out and left their slaves, the Iskar, 
              to hold sway over the land. The Iksar race of ages past thrived 
              and flourished, creating an empire whose only equal in all of Norrath 
              was the mighty Combine Empire of old. The entire continent belonged 
              to the Iksar, and their cities, vast monuments to their power, were 
              scattered across its surface. They built vast waterworks to supply 
              their cities with the water that they enjoyed, as well as religious 
              temples and villages all over Kunark. It was impossible to walk 
              for a few hours without seeing some stonework that the Iksar had 
              created to mark their homes or their triumphs. All who entered the 
              lands knew it belonged to this lizard race the first time they saw 
              an immense statue of an Iksar appearing out of the swampy mists.</p>
            <p>The Iskar formed five tribal states: Kylong, Nathsar, Obulus, Jarsath, 
              and Kunzar. Kunzar was led by Venril Sathir, a young and powerful 
              warrior-mage, who raised an army of undead with the assistance of 
              the dark magics learned from the Shissar. Venril Sathir ruled until 
              he died and became a lich. His son Rile took up the throne and continued 
              to expand the Iksar empire, engaging the dragons in battle. He enslaved 
              the giants and froloks. Rile died when the draghon Trakenon sunk 
              his ship. Rile's son Atrebe succeeded him, and during his reign 
              created the Sarnaks and a kind of flying creature from a dragon 
              and a froglok. Atrebe was suceeded by his son Ganak, who fought 
              a fiery battle against Jaled Dar and was killed along with Jaled 
              over the Field of Bone. The dragons retreated, but before they left 
              they destroyed the imperial palace and all Ganak's decendents in 
              it.</p>
            <p>Instead of a new king, the Iksar nobles created the Emerald Circle, 
              who worked to rebuild the empire. Strife followed, and the empire 
              was again divided into five tribal states. The Ring of Scale was 
              also trying to destroy the empire from within, using their forces 
              to create strife amongst the tribal leaders.</p>
            <p>The mighty legion of evil forces, led by the great dragon Trakanon, 
              assaulted the Iksar Empire. The slaves in Sebilis revolted, and 
              goblin lords from Faydwer invaded. The giants mustered their own 
              army to attack Iskar cities. Over a short number of years, the Iksar 
              lost battle after battle until finally they were driven from their 
              great capital city of Sebilis by Trakenon himself, who lives there 
              to this day. </p>
            <p>Following that, the tribes of Iksar were forced to survive in the 
              wilds of Kunark for many years while they gathered their strengths. 
              During this period, the basis of the modern Iksar society was formed. 
              The necromancers gained in power over their evil forces, and the 
              legions of warriors of the Greenmist were formed to help protect 
              the tribes. Following their unity, they recaptured their walled 
              city of Cabilis.</p>
            <p>Even there, they suffered for centuries, trying to return their 
              society to the basics, by which it had accomplished so much in the 
              ages prior. Cooperation was fostered among all the sects in this 
              small city, and gradually posts were obtained in the surrounding 
              areas. Iksar who fought against this concept were cast out to survive 
              in the lands beyond Cabilis' walls.</p>
            <p>Now the Iksar civilization are at what many hope to be a turning 
              point. Their society thinks as one, and is beginning to take on 
              their ancient enemies in the surrounding lands, fighting the goblins, 
              sarnak, and frogloks to reclaim the swamp over which they had ruled. 
              The struggle is not an easy one, however, for as the good races 
              of the continent of Antonica have become more powerful in the ways 
              of exploration and magic, they have discovered ancient, unused gates 
              into the lands of Kunark.</p>
            <p><b>Kunark Fire Giants</b><br>
              The mortal enemies of the Goblins of Solusek's Eye.</p>
            <p><b>Kurn's Tower</b><br>
              The tower is named after Kurn Machta, an evil warlord of the Sebilisian 
              Empire during King Rile's reign. Rile's son, Atrebe, performed many 
              experiments on various creatures within Kurn's Tower, eventually 
              resulting in the creation of the Sarnak race. Now, however, the 
              remains of the temple are haunted by the creatures destroyed in 
              those experiments, and the burynai are using their powers to reclaim 
              the Tower.</p>
