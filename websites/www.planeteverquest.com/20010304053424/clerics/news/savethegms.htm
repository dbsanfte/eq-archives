        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well let 
        me give you a little background before I begin. On 10/14/00 GM Raynara 
        and I were terminated for voicing our concerns with the treatment we and 
        other GM's had received from the Head of CS for Sony Online Entertainment. 
        From what I can tell this is what happened; on 10/11/00 a group of GM's 
        had an incident with the Head of CS.<br>
        We have had incidents before with him but this one went beyond too far. 
        All the GM's were asked to take a test and we obliged, but we had a few 
        questions. One of them being if we were to put what happens or what policy 
        states, another was if we should write on the back of the paper. While 
        we were being graciously helped by the Head GM, apparently Mr. Scotto 
        heard us asking questions and didn’t like the fact that the drones were 
        attempting to form a mind of their own to better serve the company and 
        its clientele. He immediately came out of his office, with a raised voice 
        was telling us to stop screwing around, and that we were being stupid 
        and that we have all taken tests before. We reiterated that we were serious, 
        we were stonewalled and the Head GM was pulled away from us. Later that 
        day, we wrote emails voicing our concerns to our supervisor, he sent an 
        email to his supervisor stating that yes were being treated unfairly and 
        that there was a problem. Somewhere along the line something got screwed 
        up and our emails landed on Mr. Scotto's desk, when we came back from 
        our days off on 10/14/00 our time cards were pulled and we were escorted 
        out of the building. <br>
        We were told that we were being fired for "insubordination; Refusal to 
        follow orders" but we never were insubordinate. We followed the chain 
        of command and kept our concerns to the point. If you are wondering why 
        it has taken till now to get out into the public I will explain. GM Raynara 
        and I have sent countless emails to people in Verant. Including but not 
        limited to: Human Resources, Smed, and Human Resources Director. We finally 
        went to Mr. Flock, CEO of Sony Online. Mr. Flock was the best contact 
        we had. He was polite and did look into our situation, but after all he 
        has to back up his management and remember the situation if it were to 
        occur again (I would not be surprised if the information he got when he 
        went to Verant was sweetened up for him.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During my 
        inquiry to what happened to GM Raynara and I, I have uncovered other cases 
        as well, and I have also heard that the other GM's which were brought 
        into Mr. Scotto's office during our situation were spared with a harsh 
        warning if they were to ever complain about Mr. Scotto again they will 
        be fired (Funny that the 2 youngest GM's were the ones terminated). Comments 
        were also made to those GM's when they said that they were getting the 
        impression that they were being treated like children, they were given 
        the response of "You are children!” Keep in mind that these are GM's in 
        there 30's. <br>
        As I pushed my investigation even further I learned that there were meetings 
        stating that GM's could no longer talk to former employees, possibly resulting 
        in consequences. That was the last straw, I wrote my final letters to 
        Mr. Flock. He respectfully declined to put any comment on them and now 
        I am here.<br>
        I didn’t appreciate the rudeness, and ill-treatment I received from the 
        company, and I have never been treated so badly before in my life by anyone 
        especially an employer, and trust me I am a work-aholic and have worked 
        for many companies, as Network Admins, Technical Analysis, Web Development, 
        and much more.<br>
        I even took a pay cut from $35+ an hour to slightly under $10 an hour 
        at Verant because I wanted to break into the gamming industry. I went 
        the extra mile for clientele, to finally be treated like a second class 
        individual at the end.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To close 
        off this letter, I would like to thank the EQ community for the time that 
        I spent with them. I will still be around and you can visit my site <a href="http://www.savethegms.com">www.savethegms.com</a> 
        to contact me and learn more. <br>
        Since I am a very active gamer as well you could possibly even see me 
        in other games; AC, EQ, Major Mud, Swords of Chaos, Unreal Tournament, 
        Half-life, Mech Warrior 4, many more and the further games to come (Including 
        some beta's, not going to say which ones though).<br>
        I would also like to thank the people on my server Rodcet Nife especially, 
        its awesome guide staff, people that I had to discipline (hey no hard 
        feelings, just had to do my job)(Stop getting suspended Mootalpar! lol 
        :P even I had to laugh at a few of the things you did that required my 
        presence), the people who helped me out I know you were not obligated 
        to and I thank you (you know who you are :P), and a big thanks to the 
        people that complemented me and my guide staff on quests (that means a 
        lot to a GM, especially me since I would stay on 4-6 hours past my shift 
        without pay running them, and drive home for an hour at 4:00 am or so!)
