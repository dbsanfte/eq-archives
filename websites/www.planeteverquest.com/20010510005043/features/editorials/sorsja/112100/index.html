<b class="heading">The Other Side of the Story</b><br>
<i>By</i> Sorsja (11/21/00)<br><br>

Ah, the other side. I must say that my <a href="/features/editorials/sorsja/111800/">original post</a> was about a Guild being disbanded on our server but some of you didn't quite open your eyes to that and demanded to hear what BoTB (Bloodline of the Bear) had to say in response to BoTS side.
<br><br>
Rogfear (GM of BoTB) was kind enough to grant me his side of the story. Here is what he had to say on that nights events:

<blockquote class="quote">
<b><i>Sorsja: &quot;What exactly happened in your eyes?&quot;</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>Rogfear: </b>&quot;We had the plane of fear reserved for Thursday of November 16th. On Wednesday night we had the majority of our team members camped out at the north wall SS. I was aware that the servers would be coming down on Thursday again before our raid and I was going to use this to our advantage because the plane would be free of mobs for a time after the servers came back up. Basically, I logged on my druid, who was parked at the SS at about 5pm CST to see if the mobs were still clear and if we could get some more people to the SS safely. Upon logging on I witnessed 4 members of BoTS entering the plane of fear. One of them was an officer of BoTS, whom I have known since the very first weeks of the Rathe server, a person who has helped me in the past and a person whom I trust and respect. I asked BoTS officer &quot;Whats going on bro?.&quot; He replied to me that BoTS was planning on clearing the plane of fear. Now we have had the plane of fear on reserve for over a month now on EQraid. Naturally I told him this (along with who I actually was-Rogfear), he told me to hold on a sec as he talked to Mistabone (GM- of Bots). He replied to me that BoTS would be coming up to clear the plane of fear and that we would be given all the loot MINUS all loot from Draco, CT, and some *carmine* and *blighted* pieces that they needed. I told the Officer that we didn't want any assistance in the raid, I added that we have looked forward to this raid for a long time now, its not everyday that we get to do the plane of fear, it wasn't about the loot-it was about FUN and doing something that we haven't had a chance to do in the past. BoTS Officer was very receptive in this, he understood where I was coming from and began to discuss again with the rest of BoTS. He replied to me that they were afraid that it would take us too long to clear the plane and they wanted to get some sleep. Around that time we all got the message that the servers were going to come down for 2 hours for maintenance......&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;I want to state again that we did NOT ask for help from Brotherhood of the Spider. They were concerned about getting some epic quests completed and I guess they just didn't want to wait. Our planes raids are under an alliance of Bloodline of the Bear (20 planable members) with the Legends of Marr (20+ planable members), that night we had 35 people in the plane, there is no way we could come close to matching the power of BoTS.&quot;
<br><br>
<i>Rogfear then told me what happened when the servers came back up 2 hours later...</i>
<br><br>
&quot;Servers come back up and we begin to log on our members and form up parties again. During the downtime a member of our raid called Verant and pleaded our case. We were informed that they would not allow larger guilds to bully smaller ones and that we would be watched to make sure that nothing happens.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;The Officer and I continued to talk, BoTS were going to come in whether we liked it or not, it was only a matter of time. There was nothing that I or anyone else could do to stop it, even The GM, whom I was chatting with throughout the night said there was nothing he could do to prevent BoTS from entering the plane. The Officer told me that BoTS would be willing to give us a few hours before they came up. We had some trouble with CRing a body and that took up quite a bit of time. The Officer had logged on his druid to aid us in clearing and soon realized that we were going on no pace that would allow us to clear the plane in the time we were allotted. BoTS wanted to get in, clear the plane and go to sleep. Realizing that BoTS was going to come in and begin to clear and there was nothing that could be done, The BoTS Officer and I started to negotiate a final deal on the loot. After a long discussion we came up with the following plan. We would receive all the loot that dropped, including Cazic and Draco loot MINUS the possibility of a BCG and some uber Robe, as well as all the epic pieces. Again I told BoTS Officer that this was wrong, under the &quot;Big Brother&quot; system that I believed we were going under, the BB guild would only take the epic pieces. As we were discussing this, the Officer informed me that another member of BoTS just said &quot;They have 3 minutes before we come in and take everything.&quot; Later I was told this was taken out of context, but from my point of view it was a direct threat from that BoTS member that we would lose the plane in it's entirety unless we made a decision soon. I asked the Officer for his word that he would hold this deal true for us, not BoTS, I wanted HIS word. He gave it to me and the deal was done.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Then informed me that they would be doing a WW break in, I asked him if we would need to camp out, he told me no and assured me that we would be safe at the north wall camp. Minute's later BoTS began to break in, we were sitting at the north wall safe spot.........and hit by a massive train, 35 people went down in 30 seconds more or less. GM later said that it was the biggest train that he had ever witnessed. Needless to say, we were very angry. We did not ask BoTS to be there, we did not want their help, but we had no way of stopping them from taking what they wanted. Also, BoTS claim that an alleged Bard-invite trained us. I just want to state that we saw 1) No Bard coming at us either before the massive death or as a corpse in the aftermath. 2) No Bard sent an apology to me or any other member of our guild.
<br><br>
I think if I was responsible for the death of 35 players in PoF as well as a contributor to the break up of the largest guild on the Rathe, I think I would say... something.&quot;
<br><br>
<b><i>Sorsja: &quot;Do you feel the GM over reacted by disbanding BoTS?&quot;</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>Rogfear: </b>&quot;EverQuest is a game; the nature of a game is to create &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;joy.&quot; The Brotherhood of the Spider admittedly did not check the calendar to even see if someone had the Plane of Fear reserved. They realized that there were people up there, they knew that we wanted to try something new and have some fun, I explained to BoTS Officer that it would not be fun to sit back and watch them clear the plane even if we would be given the majority of the loot. BoTS has killed Trakanon 22 times as of this day; I have yet to even enter Sebillis-fear was something SPECIAL to my guild and our allies. It was just a 3-hour clear to BoTS. With BoTS planning on coming to the Plane of Fear, clearing it and leaving us with no choice in all reality, they ruined the &quot;fun&quot; that we were having at the time.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;If this was one incident, then yes, the GM was way out of line. However, this was not an isolated incident, there are others that have received grief from the actions of the Brotherhood of the Spider. After the guild was disbanded, I was in tell hell, I still am when I log on. I think that the GMs have sent out a message across Norrath, power guilds will not be allowed to hinder the play of the other people that choose to play EverQuest.&quot;
<br><br>
<b><i>Sorsja: &quot;How do you feel the situation should have been handled?&quot;</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>Rogfear:</b> &quot;My experiences with this particular GM in the past have been nothing but positive. My personal opinion on this matter would be biased, because from what I have seen he has used square judgments to decide the outcome of other situations and I have been pleased with other decisions that he has made in the past.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;I do not know all the facts; I am not hired to be a GM. I play this game for fun. I cannot say whether or not his decision was the right one because I do not know what he knows. HOWEVER, if he had the reasons to do so, and if this was the topping to a cake of malice that BoTS has baked, then more power to him. I thank him for keeping our server a fun-filled place to hang out and play the game for what it was meant for.... FUN.&quot;
<br><br>
<b><i>Sorsja: &quot;Anything else you would like to add?&quot;</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>Rogfear:</b> &quot;Yes, in response to the &quot;kick in the face&quot; comment about asking another guild to help us with CT. After BoTS left, and after all the events that transpired because of this, it was getting fairly late. Some from Knights of Eternal Good as well as some from Tindi Losi both contacted me and offered to help us clear the entire plane and hand us EVERYTHING due to what happened to us. I then DECLINED, I told them we wanted to try this out on our own and both guilds wished us the best of luck. We spent about 2 hours clearing until we had our first mishap, which resulted in a lot of deaths . At this time it was getting close to 2:30 am CST, and everyone was all for getting some assistance. The Knights of Eternal Good as well as the members of Tindi Losi, gladly came to our aid. And here is &quot;the kicker,&quot; it was still our raid, they let us have our fun and were the &quot;Big Brother&quot; that they should have been. I want to send special thanks out again to Tindi Losi, and to everyone from KEG who stayed up late to help us kill Cazic Thule. ALSO, I want to add another thank you to that Officer of the former Brotherhood of the Spider, he took time to listen to me, but he could not stop the overwhelming opinion of this guild. I respect him and always will.&quot;</blockquote>

Hmm, it seems we find these types of stories extremely interesting to read about. Maybe it's because we know those involved, maybe it's because we have had a similar situation happen to us or maybe it's because our server is down for maintenance.
<br><br>
My personal feelings on this entire subject is that none of us have the right to be angry with BoTS or BoTB over what happened here. The countless flames in their forums only proves that we are leading our way with our eyes shut and our mouths wide open.
<br><br>
The people who have the right to flame would be Rogfear and the Officer from BoTS, and they obviously still respect one another greatly.
<br><br>
Thank you to BoTS and BoTB for giving me the time for these interviews - I had a great time meeting both of them and viewing the virtual world through both of their eyes.
