<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Give Jinkus a piece of Mammoth Hide Parchment
(from Cindl - Ask her 'what mammoth hide parchment?'), and a bottle
of datura ink (from Greta outside Smokes and Spirits - Ask her
'what ink?'). He will give you a wanted poster. Take this to one
of the Bank guards in Qeynos. They will give you a List of Qeynos'
Most Wanted. Return this to Jinkus for Initiate Symbol of Justice,
exp, and faction (+ShamenofJustice, +MerchantsOfHalas, -CircleOfUnseenHands,
-CoalitionOfTradefolkIII, -EbonMask). The symbol is barbarian
shaman only.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>The Cigar</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">In Halas, there's a cigar shop SE of
the Shaman temple called Dok's Cigars. Talk to Dok inside and
he'll mention a cigar, but he has none in inventory. If you ask
him about the cigar, he will relay a story about attempting to
make something he calls cigars, but burning himself all the time,
so he switched to candle making. A few more questions gets you
the quest to go get honeycombs for him to make candles - you get
a jar with 6 slots &amp; combine button. In return, he says he'll
give you a 'special candle'. Your reward is xp, plat and the Everburn
Candle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Cindl's Collection</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">At Mac's Kilts, Cindl is looking for
Polar Bear pelts. If you bring her a non-ruined polar bear skin,
she will give you some exps, 1 gold and a piece of large tattered
or patchwork armor, or sometimes even rawhide. For those of you
working on that complete set of patchwork, she sometimes gives
the pieces that are not available to tailor. Faction for Merchants
of Halas, Wolves of the North and Shamen of Justice goes up and
Rogues of the White Rose goes down. She is also looking for Wrath
Orc wristbands and says she will give Raw-hide tunic, leggings
or leather gloves if you return 2 such wristbands to her.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Gnoll Teeth</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Qeynos isn't the only place with and
NPC who hates gnolls enough to pay for their fangs. Lysbith McNaff
in the pit of Doom will give you rations, money and experience
for each gnoll tooth you give her. (you may have to give her three
at a time now). Almost makes that dental degree worthwhile. Giving
teeth to Lysbith Mcnaff raises your faction with Wolves of the
North; Shamen of Justice; Merchants of Halas; Steelwarriors and
it lowers your faction with Rogues of the White Rose.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Goblin Caster
Necklace</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">This quest is given to you by Shamus
Felligan (he is outside the Shaman's guild). The activation sentance
is &quot;I will hunt the goblin casters&quot;. The Ice Goblin
Casters spawn in 1 spot in Everfrost. They can be found by following
the right side wall after leaving the 1 guard area. Eventually
you will come to 2 igloo's. Casters and Scouts spawn here. After
killing a few casters you will get either &quot;shattered caster
beads&quot;, or more rarely, &quot;caster beads&quot;. If you
return the shattered caster beads to Shamus and you receive faction
with the guild, exp, some money and a minor item. If you return
the caster beads, you will get a Gavel of Justice. This quest
can only be performed by characters below level 12.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Head of Granin
O'Gill:</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">[Note - this quest may no longer be active].
This quest is given to you from Margyn McCann (she is the Shaman's
guildmaster). The activation sentence is &quot;I am a young shaman&quot;.
She tells you that she wants Granin O'Gill brought to justice
by bringing her his head. He can be found by the statue area of
Everfrost. Do even try to find him until you are 13th or in a
large group. The Orc Shamans and Orc Mountaineers spawn in the
same area and will wipe you out fast. He hits hard (20 points
a pop) and casts spells, but he does not have alot of hit points.
When you return his head to Margyn you get guild faction, exp,
somemoney and a spell. Only characters below level 12 will get
this quest, but anyone can just turn in the head for the reward.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Ice Goblin Necklaces</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Approach the Female Warrior named Lysbith
McNaff in the Pit of Doom and ask her about ice goblins. She wants
you to gather Ice Goblin Necklaces from the Ice Goblins that roam
Everfrost. The activation sentence is &quot;I will protect the
pass&quot;. If you choose to accept her quest, she will give you
a box with six slots in it for you to use. Collect 6 necklaces,
combine them and return to her for a minor item, money and some
experience. Giving necklaces to Lysbith Mcnaff raises your faction
with Wolves of the North; Shamen of Justice; Merchants of Halas
and Steelwarriors and it lowers your faction with Rogues of the
White Rose.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Ivan McMannus'
Remains</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Renth McLanis in McDaniels Smokes and
Spirits seeks to find the remains of Ivan McMannus. He was supposed
to escort Ivan who is a courier, but he ended up drinking the
night away and Ivan got killed. Now he needs to find Ivan's Remains,
but he doesn't know they are located. If you tell him that you
will [search for the courier], he will direct you to Arnis McLish
out in Everfrost who will then direct you to the lady who knows
where the remains are (Megan). Arnis tends to hang out around
the ramp into Black Burrow, but he runs around quite a bit in
the area. You may have to chase him down or wait for him to come
back. He will tell you that Snowflake (her pet wolf) can lead
you to Megan if you ask him [where is Megan]? Snowflake is located
by the two guards area on the edge of the tundra. Snowflake will
lead you to Megan who is by the North Tower. If you ask Megan
&quot;Where are Ivan's remains?&quot;, she will then tell you
her sad story and ask if you [will dive for remains]. When you
tell her that you will, she hands you the special box needed to
complete the quest. The remains are at the bottom of the river
and you have to access them through a hole in the ice. There are
at least two holes in the river; the correct one is near the south
side of the river and has a large piece of white ice jutting out
of the frozen river next to the hole. When you dive, as you descend
toward the north you will see a goblin diver. I killed this one
and he only had an ice goblin necklace. The next goblin north
of that one had a barbarian rib in his loot. Fighting the goblins
below water is difficult (they are fast) so I lured them out of
the hole in the ice to kill them on the frozen river surface.
The rest of the bones are located on the river floor and look
like small bags. The items you collect are: Barbarian rib, skull,
jaw, and femur. The very first item is almost directly below the
hole in the ice (was the femur for me). The other two items are
further to the north along the very bottom of the river. I suggest
returning to the surface to get a fresh air supply between grabbing
each item. The furthest piece is dangerously far from the hole.
A person needs a swimming skill of around 30 to swim straight
to the furthest item and still be able to return to the hole before
drowning. Once you have all four items, you combine them in the
box and give them back to Renth McLanis. He will reward you with
experience, some money, and a minor item.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>The Langseax</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">This is the quest to obtain the Langseax
or the Langseax of the Wolves . Complete Version: Go to Renth
McLanis in the tavern across from Mac's Kilts. Ask him &quot;What
dangerous matter?&quot;. He tells you of a crime. Agree to hunt
the murderer. Renth then sends you to see Dok in Dok's Cigars.
Find out all you can about the crime. He tells you to go see the
leader of Clan McMannus. This is the fishing village located in
West Karanas. Speak to the leader. Then speak to Ulrich McMannus
and he tells you Frostbite can track prey if he has a piece of
sweaty clothing. Return to Dok and ask him &quot;Where is the
sweaty shirt?&quot;. He then tells you he sold it to Tundra Jack.
Find Tundra Jack on the tundra of Everfrost. He will tell you
that Iceberg is using it for a collar and that you can distract
Iceberg with his favorite meal, Lion Delight. Go back to Halas
and speak to Teria O' Danos. Do the lion meat quest (you get coin
and faction as well as the Lion Delight). Once you have Lion Delight,
be sure to bury it lower in your container then your normal food
to prevent it being eaten by you. Take the Lion Delight to Iceberg
and receive the shirt (NO DROP, LORE ITEM) and faction adjustment.
Now run to the village and give the shirt to Frostbite. (NOTE:
Frostbite will wait for the murderer to spawn before he takes
off. He walks pretty fast so I wouls strongly suggest that you
have Spirit of Wolf on you. It also helps to have a party member
along that can track because I lost sight of Frostbite many times
and have had to start over. Also, Frostbite likes to fight things
along the way. Help him out. Be very careful not to target Frostbite
by accident!) Frostbite will lead you right to the criminal. The
murderer will be either Paglan or Basil. Paglan is tougher to
kill and probably in his low to mid 20's, Basil is around level
20. Kill whomever the dog leads you to, hope he drops a Barbarian
head and then return to Halas with the head. Give the head to
Renth for faction, coin, and of course, the Langseax (if you have
Basil's head) or the Langseax of the Wolves (if it is Paglan's
head). I am not sure what triggers which criminal you get or even
if you can just kill both and get both heads, but it seems that
you wil normally get Basil. Short Version: Run to village, and
receive the lion meat. Run to Halas, turn in meat to Teria and
get Lion Delight, faction, exp. and coin. Run to Iceberg, give
Lion Delight, receive shirt, faction, exp. Run to Frosbite, give
shirt, gain exp. Kill the criminal. Return head for faction, coin,
exp and Langseax. One thing to keep in mind is that your faction
drops a good deal with the thieves guild with this quest, and
the banker in Halas is a thief, making it possible that doint
this quest can cause you to get kos if you try to use the bank.
Also, you need a high faction with the Wolves of the North to
finish the quest. The faction changes are as follows: When you
complete the lion meat quest: Shaman of Justice (+1), Wolves of
the North (+1) Merchants of Halas (+1), Rogues of the White Rose
(-1); When you trick Iceberg and get the Sweaty Shirt: Shaman
of Justice (+1), Wolves of the North (+1), Merchants of Halas
(+1), Steel Warriors (+1), Rogues of the White Rose (-1); When
you kill Paglan or Basil: Rogues of the White Rose (-1); When
you turn in Paglan's or Basil's head for your reward: Shaman of
Justice (-1), Wolves of the North (+1), Merchants of Halas (-1),
Rogues of the White Rose (+1); Faction adjustments overall: Shaman
of Justice (+1), Wolves of the North (+3), Merchants of Halas
(+1), Steel Warriors (+1), Rogues of the White Rose (-2).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Lion Meat</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">This quest is also a part of the Langseax
quest. If you talk to one of the merchants outside the city before
the lake, you can get a quest to get lion meat from the fishing
village. Talk to Einhorst McMannus in the barbarian fishing villiage
in Western Karanas. He will refer you to a female barbarian nearby
to get the meat. You must say to her &quot;I will deliver the
Lion Meat Shipment to Halas&quot;. You get some minor coin for
this quest. A good idea is to combine this quest with the note
to Einhurst quest since they both go to the same place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Magic Elixir
for the Warriors</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Dargon McPherson, outside of the Pit
of Doom, has a warm spot in his heart for his compatriots freezing
and lonely out in the everfrost peaks. He asks you to take a magic
elixir to them to help warm them up on their lonely vigil. There
are four people to visit, each of whom will tell you who and where
the next one is. The activation sentence is &quot;I will deliver
an Elixir to young warriors&quot;. The order of people are: Talin
O'Donal (by the 2 tents), Brydin McGill (by the 2 guard area stands
next to snowflake), Arnis McLish (next to the entrance to Black
Burrow), Megan O'Reilly (at tower next to the temple where Starn
Barnjumper is, or ask snowflake). Your reward for this is experience,
faction, some money, a minor item and the warm feeling of helping
out your fellow Barbarians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Note to Einhorst</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">First talk to Jinkus (he is in the shaman's
guild). He asks if you want to contribute to the guild. He tells
you to find Halana and tell her &quot;Jinkus sent me to assist
you&quot;. She is located in Ye Majik shop in Halas) She askes
you to take a note to Einhorst in the Barbarian fishing village
in West Karana and return with their monthly Karana Clover shipment.
She gives you directions if you dont know the way. To get to the
village go though Black Burrow to Qeynos Hills, follow the mountains
to the left until you hit a path, follow the path to the left,
you will zone into West Karana. In West Karana follow path until
it splits turn right and head from the path towards the horizon,
the fishing village is not far. Einhorst is in one of the buildings.
You give him the note and get money, exp, a box of clover to return
to Holana and the following faction: Wolves of the North, Shaman
of Justice, Merchants of Halas and Steel Warriors increase; Rogues
of the White Rose decreases. When you give the box to Holana you
get money, exp, an item and the following faction: Shaman of Justice
and Merchants of Halas increase; Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition
of Tradefolk and Ebon Mask decrease. A good idea is to combine
this and the lion meat quest since they both go to the same place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>The Seax</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Lysbeth McNaff in the Pit of Doom wants
hardy warriors to hunt Orc Troopers and return their wristbands
to her. Give her 4 wristbands and she will give a Seax which is
a mediocre Barbarian piercing weapon usable by Rogues. It is possible
that Lysbith will not give you the quest till after you have done
her Ice Goblin Necklace quest. She also mentions a &quot;Langseax&quot;
that is a 1H Slash Barbarian weapon for warriors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Wooly Fungus</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">This quest is given to you from Waltor
Felligan (he is outside the Shaman's guild). The activation sentance
is &quot;I will assist in gathering fungus&quot;. You get a jar
with 8 slots. Kill wooly spiders and collect 8 of the wooly fungus.
The fungus can be found on all the types of wooly spiders in Everfrost.
When you combine the 8 fungus and give the jar to Waltor you receive
guild faction, exp, some copper or gold and a low level shaman
spell. A side note Waltor will cure poison, disease for a donation
to the shamans of justice.</FONT></P>
