              May 27 2002 5:20PM - Ok ok...we were... Deacis <br>
              Drunk most of the weekend, at least I was, and reckon the rest were 
              as well, because according to rumors, we could only field 10 or 
              15 people this entire weekend, which is, well...well...not the fighting 
              force to be reckoned with... 
            <p>On the bright side, we killed Draco with 13 people...15 if you 
              count a dead Assling, who despite being a warrior managed to pull 
              Draco solo, got on the recieving end of Frights little joymessage, 
              and still managed to get Draco to camp. Oh and the shaman who ran 
              blind around Fear fiddling possible adds left and right for 15 mins 
              while everyone else got to fight... </p>
            <p>He was nice enough to drop something we didnt need, so it promptly 
              rotted...Grats nothing on nothing, except the 15 people on having 
              fun :p </p>
            <p>Attempted the protect the gnome thing in CT later, which was going 
              ok, till our friendly neighbourhood Bard, Hazh, decided he hated 
              gnomes...So much for that quest...did some heavy camping of the 
              grid, and got squat, not considering the wand and arms, I wouldnt 
              give to Uros even if it did help boost our little mad genious....

              May 23 2002 2:02AM - Well the Flurries... Deacis <br>
              Got a serious rematch today :p </p>
            <p>Promptly wiped on second pull :p </p>
            <p>Besides that, killed the triplets without much problem, even managed

            <p>&quot;...that from these honored dead we take increased devotion 
              to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion, 
              that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died 
              in vain, that this nation under God, ...and that government of the 
              people by the people and for the people shall not perish from the 
              earth.&quot; --Abraham Lincoln </p>
            <p>No EQ update today. No sarcasm and silliness. Although this is 
              a game-related site, today it is important that we remember those 
              who paid the ultimate price for the freedoms we enjoy today. The 
              freedom to even sit back and play silly games like Everquest, the 
              freedom to enjoy BBQ's and picnics with friends on a day off from 
              work. And maybe even freedoms more weighty and serious than these...freedoms 
              we often lose sight of, only because those in our generation haven't 
              had those freedom's threatened, nor had to pay the same heavy price 
              asked of those who have gone on before us to preserve those freedoms. 
              So for a moment, lay aside your thoughts of this game, and remember 
              those who gave the &quot;last full measure of devotion&quot;. <br>

            <p>Roleplaying...Verant Style! <br>
              <br>
              Posted by: Druss on Tuesday, May 21st, 2002 @ 10:36 PM<br>
            </p>
            <p>Most of us &quot;old folks&quot; hooked up with EQ when it came 
              out because of our love of Roleplaying games. Many of us, myself 
              included, skipped the UO/Meridian/The Realm/Etc Mud scene, so EQ 
              was our first experience &quot;Roleplaying&quot; in a persistant 
              online world. </p>
            <p>Most of &quot;us&quot; loved fantasy environments, and most of 
              us had background playing either single player RPGs, or tabletop 
              gaming. We never imagined &quot;I_337 D00dz&quot;, Ninja looters, 
              Phat Lewt Whorz, Intentional trainers, Kill/camp stealers, or any 
              number of ills unique to online gaming. I know a lot of us expected 
              some roleplaying, in the way players would communicate with each 
              other if nothing else. I still go a little bug-eyed when I see some 
              guy shout &quot;Need SoW at orc3 PST!!!&quot; or some other inane 
              crap like that. Heroic names like Mysogynist Wifebeater and Labia 
              Majora (Yes, both were actual characters on the CT server, god save 
              us) do little to maintain the illusion of an immersive world. Even 
              the encounters seemed poised to trash the roleplaying aspect of 
              the game - remember the only way for a Paladin to get Ghoulbane 
              (which in the old days was the ONLY &quot;holy&quot; sword available) 
              was to kill a Froglock paladin...a good aligned creature waging 
              war against the undead, someone who should have been an ally to 
              the PC. Or Conversely....a Troll SK seeking the best weapon available 
              to him (Soul Leach), had to kill his God to get the weapon. Yeah, 
              GG Verant. </p>
            <p>Time passed, Kunark came and went, with Verant's first attempt 
              at having Faction actually mean something beyond not being able 
              to go into certain towns. We have the disaster of Venril Sathir 
              faction. Evil races who wanted to actually be welcome in their &quot;evil&quot; 
              city were forbidden from hunting in most of the high level dungeons. 
              Gee...so they can hunt only in OS, or they can choose not to be 
              welcome on any city on the new continent. </p>
            <p>Then came Velious, where we found, for once...an actual benefit 
              to faction. Pick a side, ally with it, kill its enemies, and be 
              rewarded. It worked beautifully for a while. </p>
            <p>Why the nostalgia trip? Well...it comes from witnessing the Dain 
              runs the past week (we offed him twice). Now, keep in mind, half 
              the casters of the guild are madly working on their 8th shawl, and 
              a good quarter of the guild are working on their coldain rings. 
              And yet...here we are, Killing the Dain. </p>
            <p>I can almost hear the Dain asking &quot;WTF D00d?!?! Didn't you 
              just save this town?&quot; as he gets hit by the damage shield on 
              my ring. </p>
            <p>Add to this the comedy of 60% of the raid logging as the Dain hits 
              30% health, to avoid the faction hit. And yes, I'm one of them - 
              I've grown pretty fond of those little DA scrolls he hands out. 
            </p>
            <p>Anyway..I guess the point of the rant (Other than bumping the pictures 
              of Taraddar in drag further down the page so that maybe I'll be 
              able to start receiving Focus and other shamanly buffs at raids 
              again), is to admit something most of you probably realized long 
              ago. EQ has about as much in common with roleplaying as a game of 
              Quake. </p>
            <p>In other news....Dain died twice, as I mentioned before, as did 
              the Creator, Glyphed, Exiled, Yelinak, Tormax, and I forget what 
              else. </p>
            <p>Another update later this week - I'll be roleplaying the part of 
              a Zergling until then.<br>

              ToV - Day 3 <br>
              Posted by Grasnalg On May 26 2002 At 12:18:26 AM <br>
              Well, day 3 of ToV rolled around and we started off by teaming up 
              with some friends from Second Age and Knights of Loyalty to take 
              out Dozekar. When all was said and done, we came away with a Black 
              Tear for Pheign which he's going to use towards a 20ac earring with 
              stats. Not too shabby. Gratz to SA and KoL on their tears and the 
              winners of those tears also.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>After we finished off Doze under the fine tanking of Havasee, we 
              moved into the halls. Drops were good at first and spotty later 
              on. Here's a break down of what drops we had and who got it:</p>
            <p> </p>

              Leather sleeves - Silini<br>
              Silk gloves - Lowkii<br>
              Leather boots and gloves for the bank<br>
              and our big winner of the night was:</p>
            <p> </p>

            <p>Entered Fear and started clearing up the place. As enough enchanters 
              and wizards were in zone, we started assuming ae fight style. If 
              there is a way to clear Fear its aeing the shit outta that place. 
              Took no time once we got started. Then the CT fight, had the overwhelming 
              amount of warriors there (2), on the other hand 10 clerics was there, 
              so heals was sufficient for sure. CT died like his supposed to dropping 
              2 robes and a choker. Grats Anavon on robe and Ves + Bio on lewdz.

            <p>Killed some more dragons there yesterday, triplets died faster 
              then i did to clear those damn flurries. grats to you who got lewts 
              there, drops were pretty cool actually, getting 2 Blackstars of 
              seems odd. Did we learn something there.....yes....never fight flurries 
              with 1 warrior. And last, Im honored to be in a guild where clerics 
              by own will, passes on Ragefire to comfort a fellow guildmate. Such 
              display of aiding fellow guildmates have yet to be seen. Grats a 
              Qina on Duckstick....eeehh Sprinkler.....or both maybe. Special 
              thanks to KoL for the aid in SF, damn nice to se guilds helping

              Now, I have no idea what we killed, when we killed them and how 
              much phat lewts we got while killing them, so I'll outline a few 
              high points of the last 6 days. </p>
            <p>First off, we killed a bunch of First Broods this week, got more 
              keys and thats always a good thing. Some nice loot of lendi, not 
              much else off anything else. </p>
            <p>Next event was the slaying of the IV guy in Akheva. Woo! Perfect 
              execution after an intial wipe, but hey, we're learning. Voided 
              the knockback with some fat guy placement, got the cures running 
              and had a grand old time. </p>
            <p>Next up was a DEEP voyage to attempt the THO. The previous evening, 
              we did a small 3 group or something scurry down to the guard area. 
              Got alot of the level 62 guards killed, got respawn, got a coffin 
              cr! yippee!! Anyway, the next day we got more people, kind of knew 
              what to expect. Fought off 2 almost CR's, then got ready for the 
              THO. We got him going, but then some respawn happened, and well 
              that lead to another respawn, and another. We just were not expecting 
              them that soon, so we ran around screaming for awhile hehe. Anyway, 
              another CR and away we go for the night. Oh, and that invis bridge 
              is a riot, leading a crew of 40+ across single file .. hehe. </p>
            <p>Then, I'm sure something else died in between, vindi or telk or 
              something. We got a Sleepers raid in there too. </p>
            <p>Now, comes Memorial Day Monday, the Rumble in GD, our first attempt 
              at the Big Giant Vs. Dwarfs War. Well, its a riot to do, and it 
              wasn't as hard as we were expecting it to be. With lots of help 
              from those that enjoy doing the war, we put those giants down and 
              Zerg'd the Hell out of Narandi! Yah. Congrats to Raladar of Unseen 
              Hand (who the war was for) for achieving the so very nice Ring 10. 
              And me for finally after time unremembered, the Penis Helm of the 
              Tracker is put into the backpack for the helm that comes out of 
              the ring war. It feels odd, to not have it on, and to loose truesight 
              (which now I have to find a good item to replace something to get 
              truesight back!) </p>
            <p>Anyway, thats the &quot;I'm so bad, I'm good&quot; 6 day update. 
              Enjoy!<br>
