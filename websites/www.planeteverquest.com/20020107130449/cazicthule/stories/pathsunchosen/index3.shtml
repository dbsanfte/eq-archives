<b class="heading">Paths Unchosen, Part III</b><br>
<i>by</i> Morganth, GM of the New Templars

<br><br>
In the previous adventure of Morganth (<i>Paths Unchosen: Part II</i>), the old man had went to sleep in an inn. After falling asleep, he had a strange dream that he could not understand:
		
<blockquote><i>In his head an image appeared. He saw many trolls around a campfire, primeval runes around the trolls. They were dancing and chanting as if performing in some religious rite. It made no sense, however. Trolls had an infidelity to any gods. The trolls worshipped none. The dream continued, and suddenly from the middle of the fire rises a dragon that had skin of fire. The dragon looks to his left and right, and then flies at an innocent troll of the circle. With its claw, the dragon inflicts a lethal blow on the troll, and engulfs him. The dragon then disappears, as do the trolls.
<br><br>
Morganth woke up in cold sweat. He checked his pouch and everything was still there. What could that dream have meant? Morganth had read the most in-depth annals on trolls, and he knew for a fact that they worshipped not a god nor religion. Yet here they were in his dream, worshipping some fire dragon god; and sacrificing to it. 
<br><br>
The old man knew not what to think, and was still tired&#133; even more so than before. He went to sleep.</i></blockquote>

<br><br>
Morganth woke up; it was early in the morning as the sunlight crept through the small window panels. Still unsure what his dream meant, he made sure his pouch was still there. Were the trolls planning some religious crusade of pillaging and ransacking? Did they found a new religion that would destroy Morganth&#146;s land? Morganth was speculating all these ideas, but all of them seemed unlikely. However, he could not let his dream go unnoticed. A wizard&#146;s dream is a distorted form of a foreseeing.

</NOSCRIPT> 
Morganth prepared his components and headed downstairs. He knew rogue warriors would be prepared for battle below, so he quickly chanted &quot;In Grav Vis&quot; and became invisible. When walking downstairs he saw a group of six at a table with their swords drawn. Morganth quickly kicked down the door, still invisible, and cast a blocking field of energy behind him to lock the warriors in. It would take them hours to get out of the tavern, and by then Morganth would be long gone. 
<br><br>
On his journey, he began to meditate on what his dream meant. The mere conception of a troll religion could mean death to hundreds&#133; even thousands. Trolls have but one weakness: they have no priestly or magical abilities. With a deity like that fire dragon Morganth had seen in his dream, their power would be absolute. Then another idea struck the old man&#146;s mind. The power necromancers would have would be deadly. Necromancers have alliances and friendships with the trolls of the land. If a strong necromancer commanded an army of troll magi with a celestial body on their side, the army would be able to crush any town. Morganth knew what he must do&#133; he must find Rindiun, in the metropolis of Norrathana. Rindiun is a great mage and is known mostly for his predictions.
<br><br>
Morganth deviated from his path and headed West. Although Norrathana was 3 days away, he had the requisites needed for the journey. He began his long quest to find out about the possibility of troll magi.
<br><br>
After about a day of calm, quiet walking, he could see a forest ahead. It was quite dense with trees, and Morganth did not remember it from his previous travels here. He quickly cast the Clairvoyance spell and his vision was extended by about 20 times. His reconnaissance showed no danger, so he walked on. 
<br><br>
After entering what seemed to be a labyrinth, the old man tried to figure out which path was best. He decided to head east for a little while, until he could head Northwest toward Norrathana. After a few hours of walking, he heard the rustling of leaves ahead of him. He quickly hid behind a tree and listened carefully&#133;
<br><br>
&quot;Zug rug! I smell hummy somewhere.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Yes, Yes! Me too Or&#146;Gon! Hummy is somewhere, me bash him with club.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;I smell him ahead, he smell bad, come!&quot;
<br><br>
Morganth had a grin on his face. Orcs were small, pathetic little creatures that have an inferiority complex. They <i>think</i> they are superior to humans, even the most eminent wizards, however their kind dies quicker every day. Morganth didn&#146;t feel like killing these orcs, so he walked ahead hoping they would see his pouch of components and back away. 
<br><br>
&quot;Hummy! Die Hummy!&quot; 
<br><br>
The two orcs ran at Morganth. He mumbled a paralyzation spell under his breath and quickly cast it on both of them. They were frozen, they could not move nor talk.
<br><br>
&quot;So, Orcs. Ye see what ye get thyself into? Now ye can&#146;t move a bone, and I have enough components to slay both of ye. But I won&#146;t.&quot;
<br><br>
Morganth focused his power and unparalyzed their heads only. &quot;This hummy is strong, we don&#146;t fight him. We go away Mister Wizard, we leave ya alone,&quot; said Zug Rug. &quot;I&#146;m afraid not, Orc. You have just gotten yourself in trouble, and as a result, you have to help me,&quot; replied Morganth. &quot;Zug Rug do anything you want Mister Wizard. Me just want to move again.&quot; 
<br><br>
&quot;Fair enough. I need to know how this forest came about. I walked this path to Norrathana a few years ago and there was no forest, yet now there is. What happened?&quot; &quot;Mister Wizard not know that Norrathana is no more? A big army of big ugly things ran through this path casting grow spell and made this big forest. At the edge of this forest is many broken rock which used to be Norrathana. The big ugly things destroyed Norrathana. Now can you let me and Or&#146;Gon go please Mister Nice Wizard Hummy?&quot;
<br><br>
So Morganth&#146;s hypothesis was correct. The army was already pillaging and ransacking towns. 
<br><br>
Morganth noticed the affectation of Zug Rug&#146;s speech, as the Orc attempted to free himself from this magical hold by being polite. As a result Morganth cast dispel magic on him and his friend. They ran away quickly. 
<br><br>
To destroy a large army of troll magi, probably headed by a strong necromancer entailed a large army of the best sorcerers in the land. Morganth was unsure of what path to take. He was sure the trolls had already consecrated Norrathana as a site owned by their deity. If Morganth ran into this army, they would have neither compassion nor mercy, and they&#146;d probably kill him as quickly as anybody. It was unsafe to move anywhere. 
<br><br>
Morganth needed to camp in the forest for a few hours to orient himself on a path to take. He sat down on a log and began to think of ideas.
<br><br>
The different cities across the town began to list in his head. Norfolk, Karana, Cazic-Thule, North Ro, Candlekeep, and The Friendly Arm: all of them possibilities for the troll army&#146;s next conquest. Then one city stuck out in Morganth&#146;s mind. Wind, of course! The entrance to the city of wind is remote from all these cities. It is in a mountain pass and is a magic teleporter. When one steps into the teleporter, he is sent to a chamber with no exit. However, within minutes a mage arrives and speaks to the person attempting to enter. The person must prove himself a pure, true human wizard or sorcerer, and he&#146;s allowed entrance. Morganth had never actually entered wind; he had only read about it, and met people who had been there. 
<br><br>
Morganth looked around, and behind him he spotted a grassy knoll. This was a landmark to him: he knew that North of the knoll was the Destard Mountains, and on the East Side of those was the pass to Wind. He headed in that direction. He was jubilant to go and meet some of the greatest sorcerers in the land, and he walked hastily. Soon, he would be able to tell these magi of his findings, and hopefully amass an army to stop the trolls.
