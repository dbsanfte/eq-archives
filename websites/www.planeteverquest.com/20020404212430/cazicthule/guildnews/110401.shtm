              November 8: Busy day for us! First we took down Myga for Visser's 
              DB quest. Then along with CC we took<br>
              out Lendiniari again. Grats CC on Taly and Trusight Helm. Grats 
              to Olebass on his Ring of<br>
              Relkententinar, and to Zoolspiff on his bonking hammer. After Lend, 
              we all dashed to PoF and took<br>
              down Cazic on the first attempt! Way to go guys! Grats to Valorath 
              on his new pauldrons, Rasten<br>
              on his Halo and Kidz on his &quot;soon to be retrieved&quot; Cloak 
              of Fearsome. Then a friendly halfling let<br>
              us know Myga had re-spawned and we moved in to down Myga a second 
              time, grats Soltane on the<br>
              Dragonblood.</p>
            <p></p>
            November 7th: Tonight along with some of our CC friends, we took down 
            Lendiniari the Keeper in ToV. Grats to<br>
            Minke on his new Gloves of Stability, Sylver on his new Ring of Relkententinar, 
            Charmm on his<br>
            Sleeper's key and to our friend Tarisk on his Boots of Superiority.<br>
            <p>November 2nd: Tonight we had a run at our buddy Vindi, we were 
              missing a few key people, but regardless he fell. Grats to Del on 
              the BP. After Vindi we decided to take a shot at the Statue and 
              dropped it easily in<br>
              one fell swoop. Congratulations to Jal on his new Breastplate of 
              Eradication, Kami on her Scroll of<br>
              War, and Thamak on his handed down Incardine BP. Please congratulate

              attendees. <br>
              A very smooth raid that will happen again in the near future followed 
              with a<br>
              return trip to kill dragons in WW.

              Our resident sorcerer, Groovit, completed the Wizard Epic quest 
              last night to<br>
              receive his Staff of the Four! Since the patch yesterday lasted 
              longer than<br>
              normal, Venril was still up when most of us logged on, and it became 
              a mad<br>
              scramble to mobilize and kill him. Thanks to everyone that came! 
              VS dropped<br>
              Groovit's final item and he finished the quest. Stats: 1hb 20/30,

              First guild raid into the Western Wastes. Guild is pro-dwarf / pro-dragon 
              faction,<br>
              but we decided to slay some oversized wurms in this tundra and fix 
              faction at a<br>
              later time. A few friends and allies showed up and we began our 
              fights. Had a<br>
              bad agro from a wanderer at the start, but as our first time in 
              the zone, we<br>
              made a few adjustments and started again. We warmed up with Glati, 
              followed<br>
              by Vraptin, and then finished off with Guardian Kozzalym. We will 
              definitely<br>
              return and add to our list of victims. Drops were: Great Dragon 
              Head [Brewall<br>
              holding], Vraptin Talisman (5ac 4stats 4resists 20mana 20hp) [Immolar], 
              Form<br>
              of Bear [Barelil], Aegolism, Gem from Guardian [Chadmoe].</p>

              of Darkness</a></b><br>
            <p>We killed gozz, telk, vind as there was basically nothing left 
              to kill.

              Phinny had been knocked off, so we went to DN, then decided to stay 
              in SG because the Seahorses are so nice this time of year. Got some 
              nice loot:<br>
              Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak - Faerus<br>
              Seahorse Spine Bracelet - Namffoh<br>
              Neriad Shawl - Fendos
            <p>We also got another 2 or 3 (memory is all foggy) Seahorse Spine 
              Bracelets, and a few gems (Black Marbles, Diamonds, Blue Diamonds, 
              etc) <br>
              On Saturday we went to Sky and did pretty well except for one misshap... 
              Note to self: Never type a message to anyone starting with the letter 
              'u' while sitting in the &quot;port-dish-thingy&quot; while holding 
              the key and also without hitting the 'r' key and making sure it 
              got pressed... /sigh Sadly, the cleric was eaten by a hungry Azarack. 
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of the raid was of course to get Nam his epic bit from 
              Gwan - who went down like a ton of bricks... hardly a challenge. 
              Two more epic mobs and a pipe for Nam and he's done! </p>
            <p>Blade of Abrogation - Palanor<br>
              Symbol of Marr - Cethorn (Runed Lava Pendant to Guild Bank - if 
              you want/need it send me a tell)<br>
              Belt of Transientness - Fiver</p>

            <p>We made our share of mistakes, and a few times we wiped out due 
              to something we couldn't really control, but we did manage to kill 
              some nasty giants from Tormax's room. </p>
            <p>Drops were a Frostbringer (Maddmax), Silk Robe (Shawshankya), Silk

              Plate Sleeves (Bonecrusha), Thunder Etched Pauldrons (not sure who), 
              Chain Sleeves (Ankk), and that bow from Gleed Dragonhunter which 
              rotted since we wiped out soon after killing him due to not snaring

            <p>ToV - day 5<br>
              Yesterday we continued our farming of armour in ToV. Main event 
              yesterday<br>
              was a new attempt on Telkorenar with Anavon. After a few misses 
              on this<br>
              dragon it was about time that we would stay victorious. This marked 
              our<br>
              first named kill in ToV, first of many to come.
            <p>Gratz to Uros from Anavon on getting True Mithril BP and our Tanyoberu 
              on<br>
              getting the Black Rock Maul of Crushing<br>

              So yeah, a lot of people have been taking time off. So yeah, we 
              have 75+ keys to Sleepers Tomb, but can&#146;t get more then 35 
              people in the zone at once. So yeah, we got a total of 7 keys in 
              the past two months between our ALLIANCE. So what does your neighborhood 
              evil, grief-pking, uber, training, cock-blocking, kill-stealing, 
              zith-loving uber alliance do? Well, we kill some bitch ass dragons, 
              that&#146;s what. But in reality, this started yesterday. As I was 
              playing around Western wastes yesterday, I managed to get eaten 
              by Sontolak, possibly because I'm a complete moron, but I'm going 
              with...my video locked up. Damn video. Anyway, while I was doing 
              a party of a CR, guess who was spotted, but Myga, god she&#146;s 
              a hottie, I just want to caress those big thighs, kiss those luscious 
              fangs...ANYWAY, we killed her for Trystar. Thx Porlo's Fury.
            <p>Fast forward to today. Guess who is playing in Western wastes again? 
              Yeah me, I'm dumb, tks! So I die to Sont again, and on CR again....that 
              sexy mama Myga spawns again. (just as a note, head to your right 
              when exiting ToV entrance and running from Sont, to your left is 
              a fun dead end) So this time, we get Porlo's Fury for Shalastar, 
              thanks ownage. Got dragonsbane? I thought so.</p>
            <p>So then tonight rolls around. Time for some dragon pwnage. First 
              is Sont....fabulous 1% on the first try. Titanax thinks Sont has 
              negative hps...I agree.(now leave me alone slut) Second try, well 
              blast, we have more people, but why stick with what works? Lets 
              try Ionat, silence is fun. Not. Do you know what the success ratio 
              for a silenced raid group is? Not good. We all know whose brain 
              child this was, no need to humiliate him. We love you Soel! ... 
              Oops. Suffice to say, we laid some beat down on the third try, Congrats 
              to Foulbreath on his Sleeper's Tomb Key.</p>
            <p>Now its Kland time. We run over, and lay utter WASTE to this bad 
              mo'faka. I tell you hes crying like it never hurt so good. Anyway, 
              Congrats Burgers on his Sleeper's Tomb Key.</p>
            <p>So about this time we realize, Zland isn&#146;t due for a party 
              for a few days, so its time for a little Yelinak killing. Now let 
              me point something out, we haven&#146;t got the numbers to a Yelinak 
              raid to win in, oh, about a Month. But hell, lets give it the ole 
              college try eh? </p>
            <p>So we CoH, we buff, we set up, we attack, we get him to 1%, we 
              lose. Fun. Nothing new? Nod. But you know what, we can kill this 
              sob, just need to modify the old tactics and have a little smoother 
              main tank transition. And do you know what? We had like 6 deaths 
              out of 50 some odd people on the 2nd try. Now you know that fuzzy 
              feeling you get when you look at the person you love, or at least 
              love for that night, and you feel like you could swim in their eyes 
              forever? Well, it wasn't anything like that, but I did feel sort 
              of fuzzy when my guild awarded me a Sleeper's Tomb Key. Thanks gang. 
              Yel also put out a nice caster Dragon's Blood Earing for Archelon 
              and some phatty Head, Caster Earing and Craslith for EoD and/or 
              ROT. </p>
            <p>What can I say; it was a day of ownage. And it felt damn guud.</p>
            <p>Also, we killed that Big Pile of Poop(BPoP) Cazic-Thule on Sunday. 
              Congrats Nochtero and Foulbreath on Pauldrons of Ferocity!</p>

              we had another Dain IV Ring War to which we can say congrats to 
              Kaacee! Was a pretty good war with all heros surviving and no major 
              problems. 
            <p>Tormax and the Warders all took a dirt nap as well this weekend. 
              Only sidenote was a certain Khaldrich WynnZ (ebay'd lvl60 rogue) 
              that ninja'd a few items from our raid. The GMs were quick to apprehend

              a failed Vindicator attempt from another guild at zone, Khaldrich
