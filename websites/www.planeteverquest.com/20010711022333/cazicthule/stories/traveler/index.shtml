<b class="heading">The Traveler</b><br>
<i>by</i> Penya Dreamlight

<br><br>
The Traveler, weary from his journey that day, sat beneath one of the few trees in the West Commons. A more poetic heart might find beauty in the gathering twilight, that moment between day and night when the sky stubbornly held on to the brilliant reds and oranges, with the moon showing its face on the other horizon. The Traveler did not have a poetic heart. Instead, jaded eyes carefully watched the shadows making sure that they were only due to uneven ground. These could be dangerous hills. Evil lurked here - how could it not with the deteriorating home of the undead so near? The wind seemed to carry the cries of the wretched to his ears, but their dark call would go unanswered until the morning, when he intended to relieve the living of their awful presence.
<br><br>
So the Traveler sat without a fire and his lightstone carefully hidden in his backpack. A fire might keep away the bears, but it would serve as a beacon to the whole area. He could do without the attention. He was a man who did not understand the need for simple "comfort." He had trained himself to sleep while in a sitting position and in armor, his sword lying within reach like a faithful companion. This made him prepared for any fight. It also classified him as paranoid to many of the people who knew him well. He preferred to think of himself as prepared. In his mind he kept an ever-growing list of dangers and he kept running over that list perpetually so he would not be caught unaware. The scar that ran from his forehead to his cheek bore testimony of the one time he had let his guard drop and felt the strike of a mummy. The resulting disease and the lingering scar were lessons he kept close to his heart.
<br><br>
A sound of huge wings cut through the encroaching darkness, causing the Traveler to snap to attention, his hand finding the sword. In the shadows he could see a griffin. It was huge in his sight, but fortunately seemed uninterested in him. The likes of the Traveler would not make a very good meal for such a creature - he was too thin and covered with armor. However, many of his friends had fallen to the claws of the beast. The traveler maintained a count of those things that he would kill when he could, and griffins were near to the top of that list. The arrogant dark elf who wandered the hills here like some self proclaimed prophet of evil was next. The traveler did not think of himself as bitter, but he kept alive a lingering fire of hatred towards those that killed the innocent, or killed unnecessarily. It had become his purpose to be rid such beings - if he could. If that left little in his life beyond killing, then so be it.
<br><br>
A movement of white in the corner of his eye pulled his attention away from griffin to an almost ghostly figure. His eyes sharpened on something not supernatural, but a small woman who was practically stumbling across the open field. Something on her (a greater lightstone?) was washing her with an eerie glow, making her elven sliminess appear ethereal in the dusk. She sat heavily as if her strength suddenly gave out. He stood swiftly, his hand scooping up his sword as he noticed the two young kodiaks nearby her, their sensitive noses sniffing the air. It only took him a moment or two to reach her, but by then the bears were drawing nearer, obviously honing in on the scent of blood. Almost gleefully (he was no ranger) he dove into the battle with the bears. The woman began to stand, but the traveler ordered abruptly, "I have it. Sit, rest." He sensed rather than saw her shrug.
<br><br>
The fight was over fairly quickly, and he turned to face the woman in white who was beginning to stand. Now that he could see her closer, he noticed she carried a strange staff and realized that she must be a spellcaster of some sort. His knowledge of those that practiced the art was limited, so the staff meant nothing to him, however he did notice with some surprise that it was the staff that cast the glow.
<br><br>
"Are you OK?" he asked.
<br><br>
She smiled teasingly and said, "They would not have attacked me, but thank you."
<br><br>
For a moment the Traveler was simply held by the smile. Its light-heartedness seemed out of place in an area so filled with death, but then he frowned, wondering what her words meant. To his experience, the bears attacked everyone. He opened his mouth to reply, but suddenly her hands started moving and she began a strange incantation. An aura of light surrounded her for a minute, as a hole in the very air seemed to appear letting a creature through. The Traveler had seen magicians summon pets before, but he had never seen one like this. He could feel the heat radiating from the creature and he was almost hypnotized by the sight of the swirling, red molten rock. The Traveler was shocked at the amount of power this creature emanated. His eyes fell again to the woman who had once again sat down, her expression one of inexplicable peace.
<br><br>
As he let his eyes stray once again to the summoned creature, he was suddenly thrown forward as he felt something like swords sweep down his back. As he landed he turned, feeling the blood beginning to flow down his back. Hovering over their heads was the huge form of the griffin, which must have turned back on its path. The Traveler closed his eyes, knowing there was no use in running. He hoped it would go quickly for him. Shockingly, the red mass that the woman had summoned pounced on the huge creature, causing it to screech in pain. At the same time, the woman in white stood quickly and began another incantation. A shower of magical blades began to pelt the killer creature. It writhed and went after the woman, her pet valiantly trying to taunt the creature off of her. The bird-thing was not to be distracted however, and swept a huge claw, catching her in the shoulder. Amazingly she kept her concentration and her hands became alight with a red fire. A huge fireball formed and pummeled the creature. The Traveler, not knowing what else to do, stood and swept at the creatures hindquarters.
<br><br>
The Traveler was unsure how long the battle lasted. As he would think about it years later all he would remember was the overwhelming blindness caused by the magic. He was vaguely aware of cutting the griffin, which showed no interest in him. It was intent on killing the spellcaster. The pet died at some point in the battle. When the fight was over, however, the Traveler had to dodge the falling body of the dead Griffin before it could crush him. He stared in amazement at the corpse, and then at the woman who was once again sitting with an expression of peace on her face. After a moment she stood, smiled, and said, "That was a good fight. I really have no use for these creatures." She smoothed out her robes and examined her wounded shoulder with a grimace. The Traveler was still trying to catch his scattered thoughts as she continued, "You are a brave man." With that, she pulled something out of her robes and pressed it into his hands. "Be well." With another wave of her arms, she faded away, leaving the Traveler by the huge corpse.    
<br><br>
He looked at what she had given him and was held captive by the sight of a green stone set in a silver setting. Just holding the ring made him feel stronger somehow. He slipped it on and looked at the area where the lady had disappeared, and pondered at the odd serenity of one so powerful.
