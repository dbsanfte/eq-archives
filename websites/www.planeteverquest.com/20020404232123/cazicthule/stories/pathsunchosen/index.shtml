<b class="heading">Paths Unchosen, Part I</b><br>
<i>by</i> Morganth, GM of the New Templars

<br><br>
&quot;The sanctity of this place has been fouled...&quot;, commented a weary old man in a dark cave located somewhere north of Mordoth. His pace increased and his heart palpitated; as he heard the grunts and snorts of listless creatures ahead of him. He readied his components, various rare materials from the land, and prepared for short, sweet battle.
<br><br>
They were hobgoblins, it seemed like a myriad were before the old man. &quot;Vas gorth ling forbiot, Morganth!&quot; The old man had some linguistic abilities, and was able to relate to what the apparent leader of the group of hobgoblins was saying: &quot;Hand over the amulet, Morganth.&quot; Morganth knew that now was the time to begin the fight.
<br><br>
Chanting mystical words of power his hands began to glow as he entered a state of complete fury. He had an aversion to hobgoblins; especially those who wanted property of his. A stream of fire had flown from the glow in Morganth's hands to the leader hobgoblin. The great intensity of the fire and spell that Morganth had cast made the leader hobgoblin fall to his knees. It was clear that he was no longer alive; the burn marks were visible.
<br><br>
The rest of the hobgoblins were in a battle charge before their leader fell. Their charge curtailed and Morganth stopped his attack as well. &quot;Lorgen forgrat vistograth...&quot;, said Morganth, with a sense of triumph in his tone. The hobgoblins lowered their swords and arms, and began to walk away, grunting as usual.
<br><br>

Morganth decided it was safest to stray from his current path, in the case that the hobgoblins would have vengeance in their hearts and plan a trap. Once he found an exit to the cave, he was greeted by a man with a short, stout physical stature. He held a large polearm and wore full, shiny platemail. &quot;Hail Morganth!&quot;, he said in an affable tone. Morganth nodded his head in return, he never was much of a people-person. &quot;So, how were the caves today,&quot; he responded after a brief pause and realization that Morganth did not want to talk; he cared not. &quot;Same way they are every day, now leave me be,&quot; replied Morganth hastily. &quot;Is it not my way to inquire into the lives of others?&quot;, said the man. &quot;Yes, Devian, it is. That is exactly why I'm asking you to depart... if you still want the arm that is holding that halberd...&quot; replied Morganth with flare in his voice. Devian's debonair nature was wearing thin in the eyes of Morganth. His pace increased, and he walked farther away from Devian.
<br><br>
Morganth decided that the best place to go was to the Rogue Sorcerer's camp just north of his current location. Although the rogue sorcerers there are often hostile with their &quot;guests&quot;, Morganth was different. The leader of the camp, Tahr'drirn, had gotten into an argument with Morganth over some ale in the Tavern west of the camp. Morganth decided it was time for Tahr'drim to learn a lesson, and hence he concocted a magical potion that whence ingested, turned the user into a person of the opposite sex. Tahr'drim and some friends of his who were witness to the transformation. They luckily found a sorcerer named Khalid to turn Tahr&#146;drim back to his proper gender. In any event, since then, Morganth has been treated like a true friend in the camp; simply to avoid incidents like that from happening again. Morganth knew he could retrieve supplies at the Rogue Camp, and most importantly, rest.
<br><br>
Morganth decided to use his last components on the casting of a &quot;haste&quot; spell. This increased his general movement speed and he was able to run across the Lorkan Desert without being detected by predators. He arrived at the camp of the Rogue Sorcerers, also known as The Horadrim.
<br><br>
A man in a dark robe, hood over head and short sword in hand, was standing at the apparent &quot;entrance&quot; to the camp. From afar the man yelled, &quot;Ah, Hail Morganth. Has been awhile since your last visit to our camp.&quot; Morganth nodded in reply, he had a few things to do and talking to this man was not one of them. Small talk was not an interest nor concern of his, and this man, Morganth hoped, would figure that out from the start. &quot;Hrnm, in a bad mood are we? That is fine. I'll be on my way to inform Tahr'drim of your visiting us.&quot; Morganth stared at the robed figure, and then pointed his head downward as to only watch the path ahead of him, rather than the person. When Morganth looked up again the robed man was gone.
<br><br>
Once inside the camp, Morganth found his way to a vendor and friend of his; a salesman of all goods magical in the lands. As one may have noticed, Morganth is not just an old adventurer, but a great sorcerer. His power was and is absolute, and no one challenges his authority; at least no one has and lived. With a childhood cut short, his mother dying when he was born, and his father murdered at age 10, Morganth was left on his own to survive in a town called Norglow. From a friend of his father, he learned the ways of magic and alchemy (which were skills his father never had), and soon began his own conjurations.
<br><br>
The man who had killed Morganth's father was an interloper in his home. The intruder's erratic movements let Morganth and his father know that someone was inside their house, and he was not invited. The rogue was clearly an amateur.
<br><br>
Morganth&#146;s father went downstairs, and told his son to stay in his room. Within moments, Morganth heard the sound of swords clashing. He ran to the balcony near the staircase and watched the battle. Only moments after that, Morganth watched his own father cut down.
<br><br>
Morganth was scared and ran to his father's room. He saw a dagger of his father's and grabbed it. Nearby, there was a armoire with two bottles of vintage inside. Morganth used the back of the dagger to crack open the bottles and disgorged the liquid inside them to under the door to the bedroom door. Morganth then heard the sound of footsteps, and surprisingly, the opening of a door from downstairs. Morganth readied his dagger and prepared for battle, but he heard a separate battle from outside the room. He carefully opened the door without slipping on the trap of wine on the ground, and went outside. There, he saw the friend of his father's, Khalid, casting spells of great power on the murderer. Within seconds, the murderer lay dead on the ground. Khalid comforted Morganth as they mourned the loss of a great man.
<br><br>
In any event, Morganth began speaking to the vendor who was concocting his own
<br><br>
magical potions with gusto. He was a skilled and passionate alchemist, among other things.
<br><br>
This man was a good friend of Morganth's, and he did not fear to talk to him regularly.
<br><br>
&quot;Hail Berrun. How is your business coming along?&quot;, inquired Morganth. &quot;Fine, fine Morganth. Glad to see you decided to come back to the camp after that event with Tahr'drim.&quot; Morganth sighed for a moment, then went on: &quot;A sorcerer's power is useless without his components.&quot; Morganth donned a grin. Berrun nodded in reply and asked, &quot;So, what goods would you like today?&quot;
<br><br>
Morganth began browsing Berrun's various goods. He noticed some culinary utensils, which were useless to him, as well as various foods. He started to see the things important to him after some more careful browsing. He required various component's such as poisonous thorned roses, ostrich eggs, and ginseng root. Before purchasing his goods, he looked around to
<br><br>
the other vendors set up around Berrun's shop. Morganth noticed that the most immaculate of them was indeed Berrun's, which came as no surprise for all of the other shops were merely bait for gullible people who could not defend themselves. The rogues in this camp were as powerful as they were clever, and the average traveler would fall victim to their tricks and traps.
<br><br>
&quot;I'll have 8 thorned roses, 3 ostrich eggs, and 20 ginseng roots, Berrun,&quot; ordered
<br><br>
Morganth. &quot;Very well...&quot; and Berrun began to package the goods. Berrun placed the bag with
<br><br>
the components on his counter and asked for 18 silver pieces. Morganth withdrew that exact
<br><br>
amount from his pouch. &quot;Thank you Berrun, I'm sure we'll meet again soon.&quot;, said Morganth.
<br><br>
&quot;I hope so, farewell Morganth&quot;, replied Berrun.
