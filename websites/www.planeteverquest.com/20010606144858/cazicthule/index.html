<span class="byline">6/5/01, 8:01 PST | <a href="mailto:kwill@rpgplanet.com">Kwill</a></span><br><br>
<span class="newsitem">This note about the patch was on the Developer's Corner:<blockquote>When we patch tomorrow (6-5-01), we will be introducing code on Rallos Zek server that will result in faction hits
                          similar to those on the team servers.<br><br>

                          Killing a character in any of their races home town will cause you to take a faction hit. This counts for all home
                          cities. So, if you kill a Human in any of the city zones of Qeynos (or Freeport, or Surefall Glade), you will suffer a
                          faction hit, even if that Human was born in Freeport. All of Greater Faydark is the starting city for Wood Elves.
                          There will also be faction hits for killing High Elves and Half-Elves in Greater Faydark. Killing an Erudite in either
                          Paineel or Erudin will cause a faction hit.<br><br>


                          Also, for those of you trying to start or complete quests for King Tormax, you need to know that we've made a
                          change. You will now need to be in good standing with him in order to do his quests. In game terms, this means
                          you will need to be at least amiable.</blockquote></span><br><br>

<span class="newsitem">This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Lower Guk</a>.  This dungeon is the home to both undead and alive Frogloks and is arguably one of the most loved and dangerous in Antonica. Why is that?  Some say it's the challenge while others claim it's simply the Phat Lewt. Take this test and see how much you know .. or perhaps don't know about this amphibious base.

<br><br>

This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about Lower Guk.  Killing frogs isn't the only thing that's happening in this dangerous zone.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about Lower Guk.</span><br><br>

<span class="headline">From the Developers Corner</span><br>
<span class="byline">6/4/01, 12:17 PST | <a href="mailto:kwill@rpgplanet.com">Kwill</a></span><br><br>
<span class="newsitem">Absor recently addressed these issues on the Sony Developer's Corner message boards:<br><br>

<b>Imbued Idols</b><br>These are in the game, but currently not equipable.  Absor says probably not in the next patch "for technical reasons that he can't get into."  Hmm, could something interesting be happening?<br><br>
<b>Shadow Knight Spell Issues</b><br><br><i>Speed of Shissar Doesn't Stack:</i>  This spell, just like Call of Earth, is built into the spell data base in a particular way that causes it not to stack with other SK spells.  Lawrence Poe, spell developer,  writes "I'd like to be able to tell you 'I'll move some stuff around and throw it up on test to
                               see if it works'; unfortunately I can't fix it right now. I've looked over the problems with speed of the
                               Shissar a few dozen times. All I can really tell you is that a number of stacking complications we
                               currently have should be rectified in the coming months."<br><br>


<i>Feign Death:</i><br>FD does not give a caster a message that it has worked, a player noted, which makes it hard to use in combat.  Lawrence Poe replies, "Having played a high level Shadow Knight, I agree there are times when I will not notice my spell
                               going off. However when I get into situations where I think I'm going to need to FD/DP I just pop into
                               3rd person mode so I can see my character."<br><br>

<i>DeadMan Floating Does not Stack with Deadeye</i>:  <br>Lawrence Poe will look into this matter.<br><br><b>Discussion on Agnostic versus Choosing a Diety</b><br>This discussion has gotten quite involved.  Check out this 
<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html" target="_top">thread</a> for opinions from both players and Absor.<br><br><b>Server Economies</b><br>This <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html" target="_top">thread</a> has been around for a while...players are still submitting ideas about how to improve the economy.<br><br><b>Rangers and Cinder Snare</b><br>A player wanted to know if there would be any high level less resistable snare spells for their class.  Lawrence Poe responds: "We gave Rangers Cinder Jolt to address their ability to survive encounters. A lot of high level
                               encounters are designed to make snaring impossible/very hard. It is very doubtful we would put in a
                               less resistible snare."<br><br></span><br><br>

<blockquote>Cazic-Thule Raid this weekend. We still need a raid leader, Uber Avatars will be available for Corpse Retrievals if neccessary. Fear Raid in 3 weeks, keep leveling. Guild Meeting also coming up soon. Also if you need anything for certain quests, don't hesitate to ask, Mistmoore can be done easily for those that need items for quest armor or just items. We've done many zones and always want to do more.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.theblacktalons.net/"><b>Black Talons</b></a>
<blockquote>Much has gone on over the last week. Grats to Tyri on her Shammy epic and Sympton on his Monk epic. Many people have moved very close to completing epics, and Trak was taken down for a 5th time. Grats to Scith on his Donal's BP. Also welcome our newest members, Morayven, Kylar and Manis.</blockquote>

<a href="http://members.tripod.com/crimsontalon/"><b>Crimson Talon</b></a>
<blockquote>Brewall led the Crimson Talon, allies, and other adventurers in a fourth raid against Vox, and won yet again (now 4-0). Her loot was liberated yet again, and for the fourth time in a row, no paladin books. Loot was: WDS [Brewall], WDS [Cris], Runed Bolster Belt [Tico], Staff of Forbidden Rites [Lazuli], Staff of Forbidden Rites [Scoff], and Ice Comet [Aridican]. Loot rules were changed to reflect status change of WDS (all four bards from original raid have won), bards will have higher odds, but casters are now in on roll. High level bards may offer a cloak for trade if caster wins and if same or better than a WDSC, I will enforce the trade.
<br><br>Grr. Emergency patch on Thursday. Should have scheduled Vox raid 4 on Wed and then hoped for another patch, three kills in three days would have been really nice (although 2 in 4 isn't bad either). Will try to plan more around this in future.
<br><br>Raid on Kedge last night, but Phin had been killed earlier in the day. Tomwin managed to get a piece for epic off the Corrupted Seahorses. Get ready for some upcoming raids on CoM and to get more Seblis keys.
<br><br>Vox is killed yet again on Tuesday night. Amazed that the word has gotten out, and I was shocked at how many people showed up. Once again, pick-up groups of random people can prevail against the beast if they are well organized. Were it not for the pit mobs, the fight would have been much easier (why people don't listen to instructions is beyond me-stay there and die!). This would have been certain failure for a smaller raiding party, but neverless, we prevailed. Brewall raids are now 3-0 against the beast, and although no paladin books have dropped (0 on 3 kills), three bards have a WDS necessary for epic quest. See links above for full write-up and raid points.
<br><br>Decided to take on the Kael Drakkal arena tonight, and killed many guards, spectators, and a number of named mobs. Drops were fairly sparce, but very nice: Gladiator's Chain Leggings (lore no-drop ac17 str2 cha4 wis6 hp20 mr10 0.0wt war/clr/pal/rng/shd/dru/brd/rog/shm all) [Savardar] and a Gladiator's Chain Sleeves (lore no-drop ac16 str9 dex5 hp20 cr2 dr2 fr2 mr3 pr2 7.0wt war/clr/pal/shd/dru/brd/rog/shm all) [Muscled]. Definitely need to return and spend more time in this spot.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.elementofdarkness.com/"><b>Element of Darkness</b></a>
<blockquote>425 Dain owned our <a href="http://www.elementofdarkness.com/images/member/Merauk/Zerg_Graveyard.jpg">Zerg force hard</a>, we got him on round two but it wasn't pretty. Sort of one of those everything that could go wrong did go wrong, ALL DAY!<br><br>
The loot you ask. 2 shitty shields, 1 shitty axe, 3 really shitty spells, and a head. What a waste of time.
Went to sleepers last night and killed something. Got ph4t l00ts.
<br><br>Dain and Yelinak dead.<br><br>Started day off by whacking CT. BTW you can't slow him anymore, sort of threw us out of whack and we lost on first attempt. Round two went to EOD/TR. Grats Merauk on his Robe of Inspiration and Angrie on his Pauldrons of Ferocity.<br><br>
Moved onto Yelinak. His AOF is no longer canceled by C2, again a bit of a suprise. We beat him to zero visible health and lost. Readjusted strategy totally owned his ass round two. Congrats Zagmog on his Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying and Cybsled on his Earring.<br><br>
Finished the night with Dain. Some jokers who apparently thought they were being funny gave him a velium axe. Too bad they were too cheap to stick a real weapon on him. Next time guys if you want to imitate FOH try to spend a little cash on a real weapon. 425 Dain with his gay proccing axe owned on round one.  <br><br>Killed Klandicar, Zlandicar, and Myga today. Made a piss poor attempt at The Vindicator, won't even go into details.<br><br>Casually waltzed in and killed The Dain yet again. Congrats to Gaef on his belt of dwarf slaying.<br><br>
Moved to TOV and fought Aaryonar who is a real mofacka. </blockquote>

<blockquote>Congratulations to everyone on a successful raid on Castle Mistmoore last weekend, and thanks to all our friends who aided us (such as Nandarr and Jhereg) and to Galadriad, just for being a cleric with Rez! <br><br>Special Kudos out to Uadan who completed the more difficult portions of the Raincaller, WurmSlayer, and Electrum Bladed Wakizashi quests, all in the same night!!!<br><br>We're growing rapidly under the new leadership of Aeryl & Lorudcee.  I've 
relinquished leadership, in an effort to once again just enjoy the game, and 
not have to deal with the politics of leading.  Our ranks are starting to 
include several in the mid to high 40s, and a few of us have gone planar.<br><br>

Our website has had a major facelift, including the addition of a new Guild 
Inventory system I wrote, which will soon be followed by a research items 
inventory.<br><br>

And just a bit of history... we're just a bunch of players, tired of the 
bickering and moaning about phat lewt.  We formed this guild to enjoy each 
others' company, to have good times with good friends.  And, so far, it's 
been a resounding success!  If anyone is interested in just having fun, then 
I recommend they give us a tell!</blockquote>

On Saturday, we will be heading to Hate, a raid sponsored by Giana.  The start time is set at 7 am est, and I would love to see all in attendance.  Because of the early start to this raid, I am asking for volunteers to lead the raid on Friday night.  Please send me a tell if you are interested. <br><br> 


Also, I would like to welcome Mimshealer to the role of guild officer.  She will handle all recruitment, so if you know someone who wishes to join, please refer them to Mimshealer. <br><br>


Welcome to all the new people recently.  This last weekend was slow by all standards.  We didn't do a whole lot though it seemed hard to get people together for raids on a holiday weekend. <br><br> 


We did manage to go to Kaesora and get 8 fangs for Howling Stones.  I would like to schedual a raid for the next weeks to come.  </blockquote>

We are going to start knocking some of the epics out now.  First on the list are Tannus and Statix.  Please read the message board to see how we are gonna do it.</blockquote>
 <a href="http://relentless.volitionx.com/main.shtml"><b>The Relentless</b></a>
 <blockquote>This last patch sucked. I think they buffed the ubermobs.  
Cazic, Yelinak and Dain all went down but all seemed more difficult than before.<br><br>Added a couple of Sleeper's Keys before the patch. We even gave one to a paladin. What's the world coming too?<br><br>
On a side note, our guild has a massive shortage of Crushed Flame Emeralds and is looking to purchase/trade for them. If anyone has any for sale or trade, please contact someone in game. We would be happy to give ya a good deal for them. <br><br>It was a long weekend, and that means a long weekend of killing for us. Now normally, BFA weekends suck. We putz around a bit, maybe kill Vindicator or Trakanon or something equally useless, but generally everyone logs in at different times and leaves at different times and we never get anything useful done.<br><br>
This weekend we made an exception. It was memorial day weekend and we wanted to make it a weekend worth remembering.<br><br>

First we had to warm up. We headed over to Skyfire Mountains and took a shot at Talendor. As usual, he dropped fast, and dropped nothing of value. I no longer consider Talendor a dragon. From now on, we will refer to him as the skyfire lizard boss.<br><br>

Then we zoned into VP. A slow start as always, but luckily the wurm spawn for us was set up pretty much perfectly, and so Silverwing died real quick. Again, he dropped nothing of value. I would remove Silverwing from the "dragon list" and consider him nothing more than an annoyance, except that occassionally after you kill Silverwing, some fool ends up standing too far out and training Hoshkar, making the battle cost a lot more deaths. As usual, this happened, and we had to CR, but we weren't beaten yet.<br><br>

Next up was Hoshkar, and we ended up screwing him up too, I forget how we did, but we all died. Then whie CRing, Omalley trained the camp again (DIE OMALLEY!) and caused us another fun CR. We got lazy and bored, so we just pulled Hoshkar instead of fighting him in his lair, and worked him real quick. Once again, drops were crap. Notice a pattern here?<br><br>

We moved deeper in for Phara Dar, and ended up killing her with 8 people left in the zone. Now, by now we should be experts on killing dragons, but no, we ended up almost losing again. This scared most of us, so we all decided to shape up. Phara had one good drop, the Shroud of Veeshan, but otherwise, a useless loot haul.<br><br>

Then we hit the three crappy dragons. Druushk, Nexona, and Xygoz all died without dropping anything of much interest. The only good thing was that we got two more necro DMF robes. Yay.<br><br>

Well, our warm up session was done and we all headed out to sleep. Tomorrow we had big plans scheduled.<br><br>

Of course, those plans fell through, and instead of doing them, we hit the Dain instead. Probably our worst Dain fight in history. Sadly enough, we got worked by the 350 Dain and came close to losing. You'd think after 25 dain kills we'd be pretty good, but no. We were getting complacent. It was time to shape up and try something new to test our skills. In revenge for all the deaths that the Dorfs caused us, we took it upon ourselves to get Crover, Malstrome, and Leody killed a few times. It worked.<br><br>

We would have gone for Klandicar at this point, but Western Wastes crashed. So instead we header to ToV. I know, you're thinking, "More armor farming? How boring!" But no, we were headed to ToV North to start our expedition into the Shrine of Veeshan. This was to be no joke - no non-kos characters to do easy CR, no known safe spots, no knowledge of the zone whatsoever. That combined with the fact that the BFA has no knowledge of tactics and no ability to form our own ideas (we are bottomfeeders after all) was promising to make for a coffin-filled adventure!<br><br>

First we made our way to Eashan of the Sky to practice our ToV North tactics. Mobs in ToV North hit REALLY hard, have nasty AEs, and tons of hitpoints. Eashan is a great mob to practice on. We ended up killing him and getting Onyx Chain Sleeves. The best part about killing Eashan is that after you kill him, you get to kill all his little kids hundreds of times over. Killing hatchlings is fun, almost as much fun as clubbing baby seals!<br><br>

Then we prepared for the Main Event. Aaryonar was the badass Sontalak-looking guardian of the ToV shrine. He's got a horrible AE, quads for 850, and has a ton of hitpoints. Killing him is far from trivial, but the force that succeeds in doing this has free reign to try out all the other bosses in ToV north. The first attempt we made weeks ago we only got him to 80% health. The second attempt we got him to 75%. But now we had a strategy. Third attempt we got him to 8%, fourth attempt we got him to 1%, but he warped home. By now it was close to 3am EST, and people were tired. But no one wanted to leave Aary up for another night. He had to die. Our final attept we ended up killing the beast. Cheers echoed throughout the halls. Aaryonar was dead, and even better, Clug was dead! Everyone loves seeing a dead dragon, but seeing a dead ogre is even better. Aaryonar dropped Ring of the Reaper and a Whitestone Shield.<br><br>

It was late, so we moved into ToV north and camped there for the night. Sunday was promsing to be a big day. If everyone could wake up in time. Which they couldn't. Scheduled for 4pm, we didn't start till 6pm. Our dragon killing abilities were starting to come under doubt.<br><br>

First dragon of the day on Sunday was Lord Feshlak. Now Xate came up with a method of solo pulling ToV dragons that I found to be extraordinarily fun. Because it involves killing off lots of warriors. Seeing dead barbarian warriors always brings a smile to my face. However, the method hasn't been perfected yet, and the first dragon pull ended up pulling Feshlak and one of his guards. People were all preparing to camp, but then we realized, hey, we're dragonslayers, we can kill him! And we did. Feshlak went down pretty easy, even with the extra adds. He dropped some stuff that I can't remember. I believe Lovern got some sleeves of some sort, and someone else got something else. And I think there was a third drop too. And we got some dragon meat. Fortunately I don't pay much attention to anything.<br><br>

We then went for Dagarn the Destroyer. Being part of the pulling team, I was psyched to pull a nasty quad 850 rampaging dragon that runs faster than sow. Unfortunately, after yelling out the warning "Don't Fall Off!" at least 10 times that night, I fell victim to my own curse, and fell off the ledge into the lava below. I had to sit out the entire fight while they fought Dagarn the Destroyer. Unfortunately for them, without me there is no victory, and Dagarn beat us. Not ones to give up easily, we tried a second time, but this time I got CoH'd back up, and Dagarn fell to our might in good time. Trystar recieved Shiny Metallic Leggings. So if you see a newbie high elf naked wizard walking around with the Relentless tag around him, that's Trystar.<br><br>

Moving farther in we ended up with a nice Xatetrain. Xate was challenged to pull Vulak'Aerr (the boss of ToV north) solo. So he tried one of the pulling tricks, and managed to pull Vulak to camp. Now unfortunately for us, Vulak likes to summon all his dragon friends to him when he attacks us. Vulak + Kreizemm + Nevederia + Jorelagg + who knows what else, and a bunch of drakes all charged camp. Needless to say, we all died once again. That's what's great about a new zone - you always end up dying a LOT. I always escape cause I know where to feign, plus I always make sure the groups are stacked so I get xp, so I ended up getting +xp for the whole trip. Sucks to be everyone else!<br><br>

Then Xate made a booboo and zoned into Plane of Mischief. Now any smart person, before zoning in, would have left a corpse at camp before zoning in. Not Xate. He's an ogre. He zoned in and realized he couldn't zone back out. So while grumpyleaf went to rescue him, the rest of us proceeded. Of course, at this point, everyone was screaming "Let's go to PoM!". Screw that! We were here to kill dragons, not puppets and mushrooms and shit. So I told everyone "later" and we kept going.<br><br>

Next up was Lady Mirellena. Now the other dragons were easy, but Mirellena was super difficult. She had a nasty AE and we didn't think we could beat her. Oh wait. No, I'm thinking of Aaryonar. Mirellena was a chump and went down like one. She had some crappy drops, including 2 Mithril Boots. But the Orb of the Crimson Bull that she dropped was pretty good. I wonder if it's a coincidence that Crimson Bull sounds like Red Bull, and has the Effect:Invigor on it.<br><br>

Next up was the lord of the fish, Lord Koi'Doken. Now normally I'm scared of fish dragons: I mean look at them, there is Faydedar, Kelorek'Dar... er, wait, fish dragons are all weak. And so Koi'Doken proved. We killed him on the first attempt with a flawless victory. Owned! He dropped a broken Trident, a decent Helm of the Deep Sea, and a Net of the Deep Sea, which isn't actually a net, it's a shield, but go figure, right?<br><br>

After that we all took a little trip to the Plane of Mischief for fun and frolick. Was nice to actually get to the zone without exploiting. We accomplished nothing however.<br><br>

Monday we were all tired, but managed to kill two more dragons, Jorleag and Lady Nevederia. Lady N gave us some trouble but we downed her eventually. Loot of Jorelag was really bad, Lady N had two SK belts.<br><br>

Other misc drops of the weekend included Barriers of Sound, Shield of Thorns, Rings of Superiority, Cleric and SK shields, Rogue and Bard necks, Ranger Bow, and some other nifty stuff. Overall a great weekend. 14 Dragons in 4 days is always impressive, especially 7 new ones. Only the 3 dragons and 3 bosses of ToV North left. </blockquote>

<blockquote>3 raids on Dragon Necropolis, 3 raids on Skyshrine (getting as far as the
level 61+ wurms), and managed to clear various wings in Howling Stones
making for a busy week for Shahmat.  All in all, a highly productive week
for Shahmat too.  In terms of loot our guild bank has a safe financial
cushion, and is able to begin equipping our members with items like
Celestial Healing, our raids have rewarded us with some excellent equipment
upgrades for our members and we are well on our way to more Vellious quest
armour.<br><br>

Recently, we have begun hunting in the Kael arena.  Over the next week our
focus will be to equip our members with Vellious quest armor, explore deeper
in Skyshrine and Dragon Necropolis and add a few new members.<br><br>

We are looking for a couple excellent players.  We have a lot of fun, we
have successful raids, and we have room for a couple more people.  If you
are interested in learning more about us, please see Pakse, Paynes, Sneeky,
Aphasia or Nandaar online or visit our web site at <a href="http://www.shagya.com/">www.shagya.com</a> for
additional information on our recruiting needs.<br><br>

Just want to raid with us?  Come on in.  We will fit requests to raid with
us on a first come first serve basis, if you want to raid - get your request
in now.  We will do our best to fit everyone we can into our raids.<br><br>

We were happy to be able to assist in killing Brother Zyphel in the Frontier
Mountains, and we run exp groups everywhere from Sebilis to Chardok and
back.  So if you are tired of the same old pickup groups - give us a tell,
we may have a better idea for you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Eejag, The "Fist of Fire" fell to the forces gathered in Lavastorm Saturday afternoon. Kinjate was able to loot the charred scale needed for his Monk Epic. After that fight, everyone moved over to Nektulos and took down Kirak Vil for Kanine. He was able to loot the tainted shield for his Paladin Epic. Grats you two!
<br><br>This update of the Thursday night event in Trak's Teeth comes from Darias and Greyy. The event went well. Even with the relatively late start time, we had about two full groups when we formed at the EJ zone. We decided to hunt the Forager cycle and moved ourselves into position.<br><br> 

With Falconian and Derreck as our trackers / pullers we were able to pick up some nice things. Aneega won the Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate and Bolgor walked away with the Meditative Blanket. A Korzanz Kit'ioukl helm rotted since no SK's were on when it dropped. <br><br>

Bolgor, Iamfree, and Orvious were the only ones in attendance that needed their Sebilis keys. All three of them received the two required medallions to make the key. Congratulations all! <br><br>Please welcome Johnanne, 28 ranger, and Greyy, 53 rogue, on the start of their probation with the guild.
<br><br>This update comes from Kinjate: Well, an extremely successful night in Chardok tonight! It took us a little while to get prepared and ready to zone in, but once we did, we moved quickly into the tunnel where the iksar betrayer spawns and set up camp. Not even an hour into the camp we Hear a message from Kevo who was pulling while I grabbed Malakie, Kevo shouts, "Iksar Betrayer Incoming!"<br><br>

So the pipe was taken care of!! Now it was time to get in there and have us some fun!!! Unfortunately I was so excited to get back to the group from getting Malakie that Ii forgot to grab a screenshot! Doh!<br><br>

Well, I died a few times, but loot was kind, even though we weren't able to get organized enough to try Korocust again. One Auspice was kind enough to donate a Sarnak Battle Shield to our camp, and another sarnak, (not sure what I was dead at the time) was kind enough to donate a Sarnak Battlehammer. I had invited The Templars along, as some had showed up last week and helped out quite a bit. Lvsun, one of their members was the lucky winner of the shield, and Gizak was the gracious winner of the Warhammer! Congratz to you both! And i guess to myself for my Pipe!<br><br>

Well, on about 1am we decided to call it a night and head out. Me, Jimatra, Aegien, and my friend Serinde got Translocates to Dreadlands(Thanks again Lum!) And we ran to to Old Wizard city to find Brother Balatim. He wasn't up right away, so we killed his PH and sure enough, 6 minutes later popped one Brother Balatin! 
<br><br>
Jimatra charmed it, I hailed him, and told him that I WAS ready for the True Drape. I handed in the Two Pipes and my Robe of the Lost Circle, and received my Robe of the Whistling Fists! W00t! </blockquote>

<span class="headline">Wizards of Norrath ----> Concillium</span><br>
<span class="byline">6/3/01, 10:51 PST | <a href="mailto:aracnakat@rpgplanet.com">Aracnakat</a></span><br><br>
<span class="newsitem">Sumaes Obadin of Concillium sent me this news:
<blockquote>
What a day.<br><br>
Since December 1999 the Wizards of Norrath guild has been a constant presence in Norrath.  Today we opened the next chapter of that heritage.  Our guild has changed its name to Concillium, which we believe is more in line with the balance of classes that we represent.  The transition happened sooner then we anticipated, so please be patient as we quickly change our webboards and html pages to reference the new name.  We hope that the good name we have developed for ourselves under WoN will follow us impart to our new name.  Sadly, although the leadership of the old guild name was transfered to my alt, the GM in game could not leave our current guild intact so as to facilitate a time of change over.  As such i would imagine that a few members who havent read there weekly email newsletter will be quite confused to find there entire guild has disappeared when they log back in.  Don't fret:  over the next few days, the officers and I will be porting around Norrath making sure that the disadvantage of having our old guild deleted will be smoothed out by quickly admitting everyone under the new name.  No problem.  Now... where is the tylenol?  Ahhh... just pass the Guinness!
 <br><br>
Cheers :)</blockquote>
So don't be confused .. Concillium = Wizards of Norrath!

<span class="byline">6/1/01, 14:42 PST | <a href="mailto:aracnakat@rpgplanet.com">Aracnakat</a></span><br><br>
<span class="newsitem">This was from a small patch last night:<br><br>


This evening we put in another patch to correct some issues that arose with the patch yesterday.  The changes implemented include some that weren't announced previously:<br><br>

- Resist-debuffs will do 1.5 times their normal value for PvP encounters.  In other words, if the spell did -60MR in PvP before, it does -90MR in PvP now.  PvE (combat versus NPCs) remains unaffected.<br>
- Faction-loss for PvP kills on Vallon and Tallon now only occur against factions within the hometown of the person killed.  In other words, if you kill an Erudite in Erudin, you will only lose faction with the factions in Erudin, not the factions in Paineel.<br>
- Turning in the Tomb of Order and Discord will have no effect on Vallon and Tallon.<br>
- On all PvP servers, only the person who gets the killing-blow in PvP combat will have looting rights.  We would prefer to implement some sort of "majority damage" logic however this should solve most of the issues associated with uninvolved players "ninja-looting" the loser in PvP encounters.</span><br><br>

<span class="headline">The New Runnyeye</span><br>
<span class="byline">5/31/01, 11:47 PST | <a href="mailto:kwill@rpgplanet.com">Kwill</a></span><br><br>
<span class="newsitem">Absor answers player questions about how the old spawns are affected in the new Runnyeye zone after the patch <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000181.html" target="_top">in this thread on the EQ Developers Corner.</a>  There is some good information there, so be sure to check it out.<br><br>There have been some complaints that the zone was flooded with high level characters, and some people asked, why didn't you institute a level cap policy like in The Warrens?  Absor had this to say:<blockquote>I also wanted to address something that I've been seeing posted on a few sites. Some folks are upset that we
                          announced the change to Runnyeye, blaming the influx of high level characters into the zone on the fact that we
                          mentioned it in the patch message.<br><br>

                          Even if we had not announced the change, players would know about it. The flood of characters into the zone
                          would have been the same, announced or not. The only difference, I suspect, is that now the flood of curious high
                          level characters will happen all at once and then, hopefully, trail off to something like normal.<br><br>

                          There is no preventing this effect. It happened in The Warrens, even with the ABF (which sounds a lot like some
                          battle-hardened plastic product).<br><br>

                          In any case, I've had the chance to peer at the zone as Kendrick was working on it. I love the dialogues and the
                          feel of the place now (which I, like many others, only used as a path to other places before).</blockquote>You might be asking yourself, what is ABF?  Anti-bottom feeding, of course!  Perhaps we need some sort of BFA (Bottom Feeders Anonymous).

<span class="byline">5/31/01, 11:36 PST | <a href="mailto:kwill@rpgplanet.com">Kwill</a></span><br><br>
<span class="newsitem">How about a quest that has you carrying around a sick baby, giving you a permanent snare effect? (I can attest to the reality of this particular idea, except it ought to reduce your cha to negative numbers as well).  And you have to get the baby to Felwithe...with no ports.

<span class="newsitem">A player brought it to Absor's attention on the EverQuest <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000180.html" target="_top">Developers Corner</a> that "Upon entering Warslik Woods you are told it is Warslilk Woods."  He wanted to know which one it was--it's Warslik. <br><br>Absor has requested that if you have seen any spelling errors like this one, you should bring it to his attention by responding to the above linked thread.<br><br>I am glad there are detail oriented people in the world, aren't you?</span><br><br>
