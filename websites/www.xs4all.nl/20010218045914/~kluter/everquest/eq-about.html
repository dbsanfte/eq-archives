<b>The Elder Ones:</b><br>
<br>
The Beginning:<br>
<br>
When I started to play Everquest in the Beta 3 everyone in the game
helped each other. Questions were answered, information was shared. They
rotated kills and loot, they would heal and buff you.  I enjoyed playing
in Everquest a lot back then and when beta 4 came too.  When the Final
edition was released I got it as soon as possible and started too play
again. The game is everything it was it was in beta and more, but
somehow the way people play the roles has changed dramatically. They
don't care about each other, steal kills, won't heal when needed. The
players would rather let you die to get the experience than help you.
The players are starting to steal kills rather than rotate on kills. I
find this a great loss since I not only liked the game but the way it
was played by most people too.<br>
<br>
<b>The Idea:</b><br>
<br>
Gladly I found some people that felt the same way as I did and my hope
started too rise again. There's still good people out there. People whom
Do help, heal, buff, and answer questions.  Playing with these people,
fighting along side them brought some honor back into the game. This is
how the idea to make a guild started. A guild with people, who just like
me, don't like the 8year old mentality of play that 90% of the people do
at this moment. We want a guild with the honor to help, answer
questions, and to share any information that we may have.<br>
<br>
<b>The Guild:</b><br>
<br>
So here it is! The Elder Ones! A group of people, that became close
friends while playing together in Everquest. All think that the way the
game is played now by so many people is not the right one. Our objective
is as follows:<br>
<br>
1. To try and restore some of the lost honor<br>
2. To answer any questions that others may have<br>
3. Heal where necessary<br>
4. Help in a battle where necessary to safe a life<br>
5. To convince others to play the same way<br>
<br>
<b>In Game:</b><br>
<br>
In the game "The Elder Ones" will be seen as a group of close friends,
who put his or her life at risk too save that of someone else's. People
that always try too help everyone were they can in every way possible.
Who put pleasure of "role" playing above gaining levels and money. It
will be a small guild: a group of close friends that all know each other
and play together, rather then some big guild of 100+ people where 80%
of participants don't know each other.  No ranks: we don't want to make
an army. We want to be a group of people sharing the same goals and
ways. Sure new people can and surely will join, but not because they
walk up to us and say: "Hey I would like join your guild, but because
they become friends while playing with us and share the same goals.
What's the use of a guild or its goal's when you never teamed with each
other to achieve the goals or have fun together?<br>
