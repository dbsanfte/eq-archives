<TR><TD ALIGN="right"><B>16/11/2002</B><TD>Adding some PoP mobs. I will sort them alpha for yet, first because I'm not sure guilds want to share the mobs difficulty information yet, and second because we didn't fight some of them and I wouldn't be able to sort them even if I would like to. I will only add the mobs that require a guild to be killed. Guilds in PoP chart will be sort based on the number of mobs killed. I don't know well who have killed what, so let me know what kills I forgot. More mobs coming soon.<BR>
I received a mail about a problem with the ST warders. That is, with the new KGC rule saying that Nanzata can't be killed, noone will be able to light the ST cell. But this is wrong. The rule says Nanzata OR Hraashna must be left up. If you prefer few SoD than a light on the chart, this is your choice.<BR>

Novae has killed some boss of VT yet. We found one of these mobs easy enough to be killed by any guild on this chart. But obviously some of these guilds won't be able to reach him because moving in the zone and killing the trash is a real pain. So we were unable to decide if that mob had to be placed in his real slot (which could let someone think he just had to zone in to kill him) or in a slot that takes into account the difficulty to reach him (which could let someone think that this was a real hard mob). Finally we decide to take VT boss as a whole and put them in a separate chart. VT is more like a "Ring of" where you have to perma-move perma-kill stuff and should be treated as that. Boss of VT will only be sorted in their own chart.<BR>
