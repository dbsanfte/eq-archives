<TR><TD ALIGN="right"><B>26/09/2002</B><TD>Novae has killed some boss of VT yet. We found one of these mobs easy enough to be killed by any guild on this chart. But obviously some of these guilds won't be able to reach him because moving in the zone and killing the trash is a real pain. So we were unable to decide if that mob had to be placed in his real slot (which could let someone think he just had to zone in to kill him) or in a slot that takes into account the difficulty to reach him (which could let someone think that this was a real hard mob). Finally we decide to take VT boss as a whole and put them in a separate chart. VT is more like a "Ring of" where you have to perma-move perma-kill stuff and should be treated as that. Boss of VT will only be sorted in their own chart.<BR>
