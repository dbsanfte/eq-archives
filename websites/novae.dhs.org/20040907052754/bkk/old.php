Message: Why did you move the Ring of Vulak so far down? Looks like once FK did it making them higher on the list than you, you changed it so you are still top guild. Looks pretty bad.
</TR></TD></TABLE>
<BR>
Why ? Well.... because of this one:<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>&nbsp<TD>&nbsp<TD>
Sender: Yumex@FamaVolat<BR>
E-mail:<BR>
Message: Fama Volat finished Ring of Vulak on 2/22.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not sure how hard it is but Vulak it self is easy , some wave are very easy , but few wave was littlebit hard.<BR>
<BR>
I think rank will be somewhere between High Priest of Ssraeshza and  Grummus 2h+@ ring is kinda boring but at least its hard than AoW.<BR>
<BR>
few flurry drakes pop and if ppl die , new flurry drake will pop...<BR>
It was still nasty when we had 7-10 flurry drakes at one time =)

Guys, don't send me BKK updates on mobs that you have kill with the help of other guilds. If your guild/alliance is listed in the BKK then you should kill the mobs by yourself to have it reported on the BKK.<BR>

I have been asked to put Saryrn above Bertoxxulous because Bertoxxulous flag is needed to have Saryrn flag. Well... mobs aren't sorted by tier neither by "flag order" but by difficulty. Saryn difficulty is independent from Bertoxxulous flag, so I guess I will let Saryrn where she is.<BR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="right"><B>09/01/2003</B><TD>Already received some emails on Grummus being to high on the chart. Proposed rows starts from A Burrower Beast Parasite. Those that haven't killed aBBP and higher mobs yet, we'll need your informations on were to definitively place Grummus.<BR>
Welcome to Elysee (I need your site url guys please).<BR>
The two charts has been merged. Guilds as been reordered to reflect changes. You may think that PoP mobs has been placed a bit high in the chart but... try to figure out what a pre-PoP AoW capable guild would have been able to do against Grummus and what a post-Pop Grummus capable guild is able to do against AoW and you should see that the proposed order shouldn't be that bad. LD : sorry if this new ordering has pushed you far at end of the chart which isn't imho representative of your strength but after all you just need one PoP kill to go back to your original spot.<BR>
As usual, yet unfighted mobs are listed in alpha order at the top of the chart.<BR>
Remember : this is the order for level 65 guilds with the new aa-skills system. The pre-PoP chart is still available <A HREF="pre-pop/pp-index.php?guild='.$guild.'">here</A>.<BR>
Send me comments on the actual ordering.<BR>

I received a mail about a problem with the ST warders. That is, with the new KGC rule saying that Nanzata can't be killed, noone will be able to light the ST cell. But this is wrong. The rule says Nanzata OR Hraashna must be left up. If you prefer few SoD than a light on the chart, this is your choice.<BR>

Novae has killed some boss of VT yet. We found one of these mobs easy enough to be killed by any guild on this chart. But obviously some of these guilds won't be able to reach him because moving in the zone and killing the trash is a real pain. So we were unable to decide if that mob had to be placed in his real slot (which could let someone think he just had to zone in to kill him) or in a slot that takes into account the difficulty to reach him (which could let someone think that this was a real hard mob). Finally we decide to take VT boss as a whole and put them in a separate chart. VT is more like a "Ring of" where you have to perma-move perma-kill stuff and should be treated as that. Boss of VT will only be sorted in their own chart.<BR>
