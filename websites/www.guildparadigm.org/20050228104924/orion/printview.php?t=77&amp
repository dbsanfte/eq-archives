<span style="font-weight:bold">Why do you wish to join Paradigm?</span>
<br />

<br />
To be part of a team working towards a common goal, which I hear is to be the best on Faydark.  To have people to adventure and hunt with... I'll admit I also want to get into a solid guild early on in the game's lifetime.  I've also grouped with several members and had a great time.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Prior Gaming Experience (EQ1? Guild?)?</span>
<br />

<br />
I played EQ1, had a 65 Beastlord, 66 Necromancer, 65 Shaman.  I was guilded with a few family guilds, then a raiding guild called True Alliance on Erollisi Marr that was in the process of restructuring when I decided to quit.  Never did any "real" raids with the guild, I was RZtW away from Elementals (most of the guild wasn't EP flagged either), did do a shitload of PU raids though.  Played DAoC, AO, AC... all pretty briefly.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">What do you wish to accomplish in EQ2?</span>
<br />

<br />
Achieve level 50, get great gear, be part of a great team, but mainly have a damn good time doing it all.
