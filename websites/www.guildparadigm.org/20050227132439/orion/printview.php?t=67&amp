  What up everyone, I'm a 20 Guardian on Faydark. I wasn't transfered to this server, I started on Fay last Saturday. I play seriously and I'm looking for a good guild with players that share my ambition. I know how to tank so you won't see me losing agro and getting everyone killed EVER. I'm just sick of wasting time LFG and grouping with idiots who think a HO is a prostitute and healers who go AFK for 30 minutes because they are picking up a pizza (true story).
<br />

<br />
So if you want to join with me then I'll be on after 6:00 Pacific tonight. If not then I'll see you all around. Drop me an email if you want -- <a href="mailto:shawnn@gmail.com">shawnn@gmail.com</a>. Latez.
