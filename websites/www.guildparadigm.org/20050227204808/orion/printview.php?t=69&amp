  This lady is great, I can't get over how good she is at keeping a group alive, she is an extremely dedicated player that came from a top guild on another server.  She quit right before luclin came out.  I really really think we need to pick this lady up, she is just too good to let slip between our fingers.  We may not necessarily need clerics now, but I can deffinetly think of times in the past where we could never find enough.
<br />

<br />
If it comes down to me needing to bring her around so you guys can see her skill I will.  Don't let this lady go.
