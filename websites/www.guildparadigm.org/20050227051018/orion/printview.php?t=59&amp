Why do you wish to join Paradigm? I would like to join Paradigm for several reasons, the number 1 reason is that I am looking for guildmates that are smart players and that have some dedication to the game.  You guys have a great reputation on Sol Ro as I recall.  I also have an old gaming friend Zhakrin in your guild so it would be nice also to be guilded with someone I have some old ties with.  My days with Zhakrin go back to Ultima Online 1996?  I  grouped with Fflurry, Erasser and Kaden doing the level 20 armor quests and I had a good report with them, seems like a good bunch of guys.  I have class envy now after watching Erasser firing his arrows so fast, I swear we had Legolas in our group last night lol.  I also grouped with Teuyan 2 nights ago in Vermin's Syne, we had a pickup group killing large tomb vermin, at that time my characters name was Alricx. He might recall the dwarven cleric healing.  The GM's changed my name since they stuck an "X" at the end of my name on the character transfer...I like Olfur...sounds more dwarvish

Prior Gaming Experience (EQ1? Guild?)? I started with MMORPG with Ultima Online, I still recall the lag from that game on opening day/week.  From UO I went to EQ1 and played that for 2 1/2 years with some breaks in there.  I played DAOC for abit during one of those breaks.  I stopped playing EQ1 sometime after PoP, I had a Barb Shaman/Smith and I recall being innudated with armor requests from other Barbarians, especially warriors, luckilly with PoP Blue Diamonds became more plentiful.  After Everquest 1 I played Star Wars Galaxies for almost a year, I unlocked my Jedi slot there which was exciting...till I got to actually see what playing a Jedi was like.  The moment I became attuned to the force was probably the highlight of my SWG experience.  Ok, I rambled enough for now, hope this is enough info <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

What do you wish to accomplish in EQ2? The main thing I want to accomplish is that I want to explore the world with others,  I also have crafting in my blood so I am trying to balance the 2, exploring/leveling vs crafting.  Online gaming is meant to be done with a group of friends and I am hoping to make some new friends while I explore EQ2
