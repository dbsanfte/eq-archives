  Paradigm,
<br />

<br />

<br />
    I'm a verteran of MMORPG's, played eq1 for many years, among some other games.  I have waited in eq2 to join a guild till I had grouped with a bunch of the guild's members before I decided I would apply.  Im a level 21 Iksar Conjuror(yes I did that pain in the rump betrayal quest), and I am now very interested in joining a guild.  I have grouped with many Paradigm members so far, and I must say they are all in my experience very talented and professional people.  This guild by far has the best EQ2 players I have grouped with since starting on the Faydark server.  I have my first 4 armor quests done, and Im pretty familiar with the game at this point.  I enjoy being made fun of and making fun of others, I enjoy adult language, and most of all I enjoy helping people out.  I am very excited to join Paradigm's family, so please let me know if you have room for me.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks!!

  I know you pretty much covered it all and shit, but go ahead and humor me with filling this out.  Makes sorting thru applications I post on the other board much easier, thanks!

  Sorry, we are in the process of getting the whole officer thing setup for eq2 (making the eq1 system work for eq1 and stuff).  Give us a day or so and we should be able to get ya some more information.
