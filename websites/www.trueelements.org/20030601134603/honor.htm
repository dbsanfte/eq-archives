  <br>
  <font face="ReneLouis" size="5">Greetings one and all!</font><font face="ReneLouis" size="3"> 
  </font> 
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">We are pleased you have found your way to 
    our guild website. In order to get a better feel for what being in The Council 
    of True Elements is all about...we would like for you to know the following: 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">We believe in friendship and fun... first 
    and foremost, we are not a raiding guild however we do have raids, but this 
    is not our primary focus...we do plan fun events and help one another to the 
    best of our ability. </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">We encourage people to play whatever class 
    they enjoy and believe that diversity is a way of keeping fun in the game, 
    therefore we do not support the theory of Mains vs. Alts...instead we feel 
    that whatever character you are playing at any given time is the Main for 
    the moment. </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">We frown strongly on unethical behaviors 
    such as: </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">Abandoning a guildmate in a dangerous area. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">Luring or enticing other guilds member's 
    away from their guild. </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">Insinuating that someone is not playing their 
    character well or does not have good gear (in general: insulting behaviors). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">Ninja looting. </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">Kill stealing which includes breaking someone 
    else's camp area deliberately. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Stonehenge" size="3">NEVER EVER BEG IN GUILD OR OUT OF GUILD! 
    BEGGARS ARE NOT TOLERATED</font><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">! </font></p>
  <p>NEVER BASH ANYONE IN ANY CHAT TO ANYONE.(in guild or not in guild)! Treat 
    everyone with respect. Treat them the way you want to be treated. This is 
    especially strict on officers. All members of this guild need to remain calm 
    and diplomatic when dealing with an issue. If you cannot handle it without 
    getting upset, ask an officer to get involved. If it is an officer or the 
    guild leader you are having issues with then ask another officer or a group 
    of officers to be a mediator. ANYONE caught bashing someone else will have 
    disciplinary brought again them &#133; Everyone will get a warning. Then a 
    counseling session..... if the temper cannot be calmed... the member may eventually 
    be removed from guild. An Officer's will get a warning, a counseling session, 
    then loose officership....eventually could lead to removal from guild. If 
    the member or officer goes way out of line&#133;.. then the guild leader has 
    right to remove that member with out the step down process. All actions should 
    be documented as much as possible via screen shots and /log. </p>
  <p>REMEMBER TO TREAT YOUR LEADERS WITH RESPECT. They are there to help you and 
    this guild. They are your friends and they are your family but they are also 
    your officers and guild leader. They are basically your Manager and Assistant 
    Managers &#133; treat them with the same respect. Officers should remember 
    to treat their fellow officers with respect and all Officers should treat 
    the guild leader with respect. And although they are your leaders&#133;. They 
    do not have the right to treat you poorly. And you have the right to seek 
    help when you have issues with one of them. See paragraph above. <br>
  </p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">We believe in the /random lotto method for 
    fair distribution of loot and need before greed is always the rule. </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">We do have a disciplinary board and will 
    address grievances quickly. We are not above guild removing a member who violates 
    our ideals. We would prefer to maintain a quality guild even if that means 
    remaining small as opposed to a large guild full of players who do not fit 
    into CoTE. </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">We do not condone prejudice in any form believing 
    all are equal. </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">We do not actively recruit for membership 
    into CoTE but rather guild invite those who are sponsored by an active CoTE 
    member. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Stonehenge" size="4">Each member is expected to view the website 
    daily if possible in order to stay well informed of guild activities and prevent 
    repetitive questions about what is happening in guild chat<b>.</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">We want our guild to reflect the personalities 
    and ethic's of our players and maintain an honorable guild reputation and 
    we feel each person wearing the CoTE guild tag is a representative of CoTE's 
    fine ideals. </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">We maintain a family atmosphere and value 
    the input of all our members whether we agree with them all the time or not. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3">Our focus is to form lasting friendships 
    and have a good time while doing this. Along the way extra rewards are experience, 
    loot and adventure </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3"> ;-) </font></p>
  <p><font face="ReneLouis" size="3"> Please make your application along with 
    who is sponsoring you, if you feel this is your kind of guild</font><font face="ReneLouis">.</font></p>
