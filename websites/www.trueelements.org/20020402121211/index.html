        Hail Guildmates, <br>
        For any of you that do not already know, we have a guild
        Alliance channel. This channel is for the Allegiance of
        the Sacred truth members only, witch includes any members
        of our guild. The name of this chat channel is AoST. To
        join the AoST chat channel you will need a password witch
        can be obtained from any officers or members of our guild
        who are online. I would suggest using the /autojoin
        AoST:(Password) command so that you will automatically be
        logged into this channel whenever you log into EQ. The
        AoST channel is very useful for keeping track of what's
        going on with our friends in AoST and for finding
        friendly groups.<br>
        <br>
        </font>03/26/02<br>
        Here is the guy you want on your side during those
        Barroom Brauls, hehe.<br>

        We now have a new guild roster system through Guild
        Magic. You will see a link to this new roster system
        above, <a
        href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=3541&amp;sortby=character_name&amp;showroles=1"
        target="new"><font size="4"><em><strong>Council of True
        Elements Guild Roster</strong></em></font></a><font
        size="4"><em><strong> </strong></em></font>.This will
        allow many new features such as custom awards, ranks,
        guild vaults, ect.. In order for this to work we need all
        guildmembers to create an account with thier characters
        and join the roster. If you have not done this so far,
        please do so now. If you see a guildmember in game who
        has not done this yet, please remind them to come to our
        website and do so. Thanks :)<br>

        New movie of our Plane of Fear raid on our <a

        HAPPY NEW YEAR!! Now lets kill some stuff! hehe<br>
        <br>
        12/19/01<br>
        I posted a new movie of our Adventure in Plane of Hate
        with our guild alliance Allegiance of the Sacred Truth.
        You can watch the movie from our <a
        href="Movies\index.html"><font size="4"><b><i>Movies</i></b></font></a><font
        size="4"><b><i> </i></b></font>page. Make sure you turn
        up your PC speakers for this one, the soundtrack kicks
        some major jam.<br>
        <br>
        12/12/01<br>
        I will be hosting a real life guild party at my home on
        or around March 2nd 2001. Please see detials in our <a
        href="http://www.trueelements.org/forum/"><font size="3"><b><i>New
        Forum</i></b></font></a><font size="4"> .</font><br>
        Another CoTE Funnie has been submitted by Jatoiah. If
        anyone else has anything that they would like to submit
        to our site, please send me an email.<br>
        <br>
        12/03/01<br>
        Well, I finally figured out how to post movies on our
        website. Go check out our latest movie of a fun raid on
        Unrest. The movies can be found in the <a
        href="Gallery.html"><font size="4"><b><i>Gallery</i></b></font></a><font
        size="4"><b><i> </i></b></font>in the <a
        href="Movies\index.html"><font size="4"><b><i>Movies</i></b></font></a><font
        size="4"><b><i> </i></b></font>link.<br>
        Jatoiah has submitted another CoTE Funny. This latest one
        is about those famous EQ GM's.<br>
        <br>
        12/02/01<br>
        I can now make our own EQ movies! My first attempt at an
        EQ movie is in our Gallery/Movies page. This is a big
        file so I suggest only downloading it if you have a high
        speed connection. I will probably be deleting these files
        as they get old so I don't take too much hard drive space
        from Treeman, hehe.<br>
        <br>
        Another new CoTE Funnie from Jat. I think he is trying to
        tell me something, but I'm not sure, lol.<br>
        <br>
        11/22/01<br>
        HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!<br>

        09/28/01<br>
        We had a great Officers meeting and discuseed some new
        and old issues. We decided on some new ideas to make our
        guild better and more fun for all.<br>
        <br>
        The meeting ended by a GM event that we were fortunately
        able to participate in. I was able to capture 70+ screens
        of our adventure and log all that happened. I have posted
        a new page in the Gallery that shows our great adventure.
        For all of us this was our first GM event and I think we
        all agreed it was well done. The following is a link
        directly to the GM Event page:<br>

        Hail Guildmates!<br>
        A great Thanks to Treeman for moving our site to
        TrueElements.org! I believe he has some great plans for
        improving our guild website too. I cant wait to see whats
        next. If you still have the old site
        Mythdrannor.com/trueelements bookmarked, change it now to
        here. This site will from now on have all current
        updates. <br>

        to go and fit the different requirements for these raids.
        Make sure you do some research before you go and always
        remember that you are representing all of the Council of
        True Elements while you are there. So be on your best
        behavior and show them what CoTE is all about! =) Next

        Congratulations to our new officers Treeman, Wisefoxx,
        and Zrake for passing the officers test! The officers
        test event was alot of fun for all. Now we all just need
        to think of some good titles to give them, hehe.<br>
        <br>
        We had a great raid of LGuk last Sunday. We wiped out the
        undead frog legions and even the Undead Lord himself!
        LGuk now knows the true power of the Council of True
        Elements. Thanks to Seconde for starting this raid and to
        all those who turned out to help. I know I had a blast on
        this raid, lets keep the good times rolling.<br>

        We have been getting together for some quick mini raids
        of places like Ry'gorr Fort in EW and DL. These have been
        going very well and have been loads of fun. Basically
        these mini raids have been two groups with one puller,
        one loot master, and a raid leader. Groups are equaled
        out as much as possible so that both groups get
        experience. The main puller chain pulls and both groups
        focus their attacks on the same mobs. This seems to be a
        strategy that can work well to allow the two groups to
        kill stuff bigger and faster then what one group could
        normally do. The exp over time is probably not as good as
        one good group because of the splitting of exp between
        the two groups. This strategy does seem to improve
        overall safety due to both groups helping each other out
        though. Besides, it is a blast being in a platoon of CoTE
        kicking some major arse on the battlefield=). Lets keep
        working on these mini raids to help us improve our
        strategies for the big raids coming up. And don&#146;t
        forget, any member can post raid idea's in our forum, so
        don&#146;t be shy!<br>

        Our Officer's meeting went well. Council of True Elements
        officers will now be planning and leading more guild
        raids for all levels. Treeman, Cootie, Zrake, and
        Wisefoxx are to be all tested at the Lake Rathe arena for
        rank of officer. I have started a post in the <a
        href="http://geocities2498.community.everyone.net"><b><i>Forum</i></b></a>
        so that we can plan a day and time to have this event.
        All four candidates, myself, and other officers will need
        to be in attendance as well. All members are welcome to
        come by and cheer them on, and take part in festivities
        afterwards.<br>

        Well, Lady Vox was a very mean Dragon the other night.
        Unfortunately we were unsuccessful at taking her down. We
        will get her next time though. Here is a link to the CoG
        topic on what happened. <br>

        Aillaar has suggested a Guild raid on Velk's Lab in GD.
        This would be a great raid for 45+ so post when you could
        be at this one in our <a

        We need to plan a Guild party soon for some good times
        and to let us all meet each other. Please post some ideas
        on this. =)<br>

        We are up for Lady Vox tonight with the Council of
        Guilds. If you want to attend get to Everfrost early. The
        Raid is scheduled to start at 8pm EST. These raids take
        at least 4 hours minimum so be prepared for a late night
        if you are going. For details on Lady Vox raids see the <a

        We had a fun raid last night on the Ryy'Gorr Fort in
        Eastern Wastes. Let's try to do that again tonight.
        Remember these raids are not necessarily about exp, they
        are about getting together to do things we could not
        normally do as just one group. It was great seeing three
        full groups of the Council of True Elements owning the
        whole fort. We got a lot of nice Ryy'Gorr armor and
        jewelry too. Gratz to Elderberry for winning on the role
        for the Ryy'Gorr Battle Mail =).<br>

        I'm back from vacation! I had a great time and got to
        spend some time with Axyus, Celestrial and Tironis in RL.
        Looks like our little guild has gotten a bit bigger since
        I was gone too. If you are new and not on our <a
        href="members.html"><font size="4"><b><i>Members</i></b></font></a><font
        size="4"><b><i> </i></b></font>page please post an
        introduction for yourself in our <a
        href="http://geocities2498.community.everyone.net"><b><i>Forum</i></b></a>
        with some details on level, class, who your sponsor is,
        ect&#133;<br>
        I also posted a thread in the <a
        href="http://geocities2498.community.everyone.net"><b><i>Forum</i></b></a>
        about the MM raid we had with Royalty of Norrath. Please
        post any ideas on how we can make these multi-guild raids
        go smoother in the future.<br>
        We need to plan another guild event so that we can all
        get together to meet each other and have some fun. Maybe
        another party/PvP event at Lake Rathe arena?? Please post
        some ideas on how/when/where you think would be best.<br>
        We have another Vox raid with CoG coming up this
        Wednesday the 22<sup>nd</sup>. If you plan on going sign
        up ASAP, and make sure you read up on the requirements,
        rules, and strategies for CoG Dragon raids. The following
