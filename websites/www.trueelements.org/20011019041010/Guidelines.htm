        TO BECOME A MEMBER OF TRUE ELEMENTS</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2">First, you must meet
        the Guidelines for Guild membership:</font></p>
        <ol>
            <li><font color="#00D269" size="2">You must play the
                game well, either by roleplaying, or hunting, or
                exhibiting good group hunting tactics</font></li>
            <li><font color="#00D269" size="2">Meet at least 1
                officer, hunt with at least 1 member and, when
                possible 1 officer at least once</font></li>
            <li><font color="#00D269" size="2">Must be able to
                act in a <b>MATURE </b>manner.</font></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2">After you've read our
        guidelines below and decided we might be for you, it's
        time to meet us and for us to meet you. Becoming a member
        of True Elements should be fun, so we ask that you hunt
        with at least 1 member, and when possible, 1 officer. If
        the hunt goes well, the member you hunted with will
        sponsor you for membership, at which point, you will be
        guildtagged for a one (1) week probationary period. This
        week will give us a chance to evaluate you, as well as
        you to evaluate whether or not you will fit in with us. <br>
        <br>
        If you decide you would like to join us, please post an
        introduction for yourself to the forum. If after the
        probationary period no one has any negatives to say about
        you, and you wish to continue your membership, you are a
        full-fledged True Elements member. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2"><b>GUIDELINES:</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2">We have now set our
        guidelines, but none of these are set in stone. We want
        to be able to alter our outlook on the game at will,
        without being constrained by an unchangeable set of
        rules. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2">One guideline is set in
        stone, and can expressed this way:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2">&quot;Have fun! If you
        don't like this guild, and aren't having fun, get your
        happy arse out!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2"><b>Out of Character:</b>
        The guild is NOT to be used to promote anything OUT OF
        CHARACTER that a person is doing. That means no posting
        URL's for your other web sites in the forum, no using the
        guild's name for commercial ventures, nothing that
        doesn't concern in-game is to be sponsored or supported
        by the guild. While it is not discouraged, it is also not
        encouraged. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2"><b>Kill-stealing and
        camping rotations:</b> Kill-stealing is a Guild-bannable
        offense. By Kill-stealing I mean deliberate and repeated
        acts of taking another person or groups kills out of
        turn, or &quot;hogging&quot; all the kills in a camped
        area, either by intentionally attacking all spawns in the
        area, or mana dumping damage spells onto anything that
        moves. Bragging about doing so, OR threatening to bring a
        load of higher level Guild characters in to make sure you
        take all the kills is ALSO wrong. Even in a situation
        where you are the victim of kill-stealing, you do not and
        SHOULD not threaten to kill-steal in retaliation. You are
        free to challenge the offender to a duel, call a GM, or
        try to resolve the situation by discussing it in /tells. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2">All Guild members, upon
        entering an area camped by multiple groups/individuals
        should seek to form a rotation upon entering the area.
        Once formed, stick to the rotation. If you mess up,
        apologize, and offer to sit out a spot in the rotation.
        If another group breaks the rotation, ask them to change
        their behaviour. DO NOT get into a verbal argument with
        these people, and keep the verbal abuse guideline in
        mind. Only after attempting a rotation should you engage
        in a free-for-all.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2"><b>Forum Use:</b> The
        forum is not to be used for personality conflicts.
        Problems between 2 guild members are not to be argued
        about in the forum. It is to be used for communication of
        ideas, events, support, etc. of the whole guild and its
        members in-game activities. It is not to be a forum for
        complaints. Complaints are to be sent to an officer via
        email or by discussing the problem with an officer or the
        Leader in /tells. The officer contacted with a complaint
        will be responsible for either dealing with the complaint
        or, if necessary, passing the complaint to the leader.
        Arguments between 2 or more players are to be resolved by
        the parties involved, when at all possible. Please feel
        free to contact any of the officers or the Leader with a
        problem, but do not use the forum as a venting platform.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2"><b>Verbal abuse:</b> No
        member of True Elements should engage in verbal abuse,
        except when roleplaying. This means public verbal abuse
        that can be heard in /shout, /ooc, /say, anything that
        can be overheard by anyone other than the two
        participants. No member should also engage in private
        verbal abuse, and any logged instance of said abuse will
        be adjudged by the council and treated accordingly.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#00D269" size="2"><b>Bannable offenses: </b>Any
        offenses that are bannable by Verant, are not
        Guild-endorsed, and may lead to disciplinary actions.
        Some examples are: </font></p>
        <ol>
            <li><font color="#00D269" size="2">Intentional,
                hurtful kill-stealing (more on this in another
                topic) </font></li>
            <li><font color="#00D269" size="2">Cheating
                (Intentionally using hacks or bugs in the game
                that Verant warns or bans people)</font><font
                color="#00D269"> </font></li>
            <li><font color="#00D269" size="2">Trading illegal,
                obscene or copyrighted material using EQ as a
                trading vehicle. This includes pornography, warez
                or anything else traded between two people.
                Guildsay is not the place for this, and the guild
                has NO connections to this. If you are caught
                doing this, you are on your own. </font></li>
            <li><font color="#00D269" size="2">Harassment. This
                includes sexual, verbal or any type of harrasment
                that can get you banned. We are here to have fun,
                and there is no reason to destroy another's fun,
                whether in the guild or out. </font></li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font color="#00D269" size="2"><b>Guidelines for
            Officers - Adding new members:</b><br>
            We must be selective in who we sponsor for
            membership. Just because we have one good hunt with
            someone is not reason enough. When we add a new

        forum, or give the owner a /tell in-game, and it is up to
        the two members to arrange the transfer. Once you have
        taken possession of an item, you must post it to the
        Treasury thread, showing that you currently have

        </b>Being mature adults, we created this Guild also to

        mature adults gives us license to act and voice ourselves
