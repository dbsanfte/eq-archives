And, as is the usual with me, I chose a seemingly broken class.<br>
<br>
The real question is, wether or not this class is really broken.<br>
<br>
So far, most things seem to work correctly except one thing.. Duel Weild.<br>
<br>
When you come from EQ, you have certain expectations for some abilities.  In EQ, Duel weild works as such.. When your primary weapon timer goes off, it swings.. Always.  When your secondary timer goes off, it makes a DW check, if it succeeds, that weapon swings, if not, you wait till the timer goes off again.<br>
<br>
DAoC duel weild isn't like this however.  I'm not EXACTLY sure on the details, but I believe it works something like this.<br>
<br>
In DAoC, weapons still have a Damage and Delay, similar to EQ.   When you start combat, you attack with your primary hand weapon.  After the delay of that weapon passes, you make a Duel Weild roll.  Now, instead of always having your Primary weapon go off, DW chooses one or the other, or, possibly both.  To this end, DW may indeed Seem broken.  I'm only level 8, while I started DW at level 5, I won't be able to train or specialize in DW until level 10.  So far, I haven't done any more damage than an Armsman with a pike, in fact, I've probably done less.  At this level, the tradeoff between DW and Not wearing plate armor isn't noticable, as no one at my level can even where chain anyways, but from what I hear, DW isn't worth the trade at later levels, as pikes and two handers will STILL outdamage duel weild.  And Certainly at lower levels, if one weapon isn't as good as the other, y ou would be better off weilding a single weapon over DW.<br>
<br>
Perhaps when I hit level 10 and get to spec in DW, I'll be able to better understand the way things work, but so far, I'm not so sure about the Mercenary.  As a Mercenary, I get Duel Weild, Evade (Similar to Dodge in EQ) Parry, Chain Armor as my best armor.  No spells, and no special skills. It's basicaly an Armsman with worse armor and a different weapon skill.  All our Duel Weild styles aren't anything special.<br>
<br>
Compare this to an Infiltrator, who also gets Duel Weild.  They are limited to Leather, maybe Studded armors, however they get Evade 2 (More advanced form of Evade) which makes up for some of this. (Only Friars get Evade3, which supposedly allows them to evade 70-80% of damaging blows)  In addition to this, they also get Hide, (The equivelent of Hide+Sneak for EQ rogues) Critical Strike styles (Backstab, but with a whole lot more options) Wall climbing, and Tracking.<br>
<br>
Then again, I don't know the Infiltrator class that well, and I may have the Tracking bit confused with a different class (Scout)<br>
<br>
Still, I'm not quite sure what the Merc's role will be in the game, both PvE and RvR.<br>

But duel wield is supposed to work with 2 weapons being of roughly equal delay. Unlike in EQ, where the offhand weapon is where you want to put your slower weapon, you need to keep your weapons roughly equal in delay to see the benefits of this skill. <br>
<br>
I do think that 2 handers are going to be equal in damage/taunt factor to duel wield in DAoC, which to me is a good thing, as it makes it so that you can choose which way to go as a warrior, as opposed to EQ where you have to duel wield fast weapons to be an effective tank. <br>
<br>
The Scout is the class that will have the tracking abilities, though they aren't in yet. Also, the rogue template (which the scout is built off of) gets hide (which is like EQ sneak/hide) at first level, PLUS the scout gets to be the BOMB for archery. The Scout class uses the longbow, which with good arrows, can shoot at the same range as wizards longest range spells. Apparently, againt low blues/greens, a good scout archer can solo most things, with a good percentage (say 50%) of the damage being from archery. <br>

He did anywhere from a Quarter to a third of the mob's health in one or two shots.  He had a nice long range bow and was able to get off two shots most of the time.  They DO get the bomb for Archery..<br>
<br>
Where as a merc cannot train in it, therefore cannot be effective in it.<br>
<br>
Like I said before, I'm seeing no compelling reason to play a Merc over a Rogue.. Rogues seem to get a better end of the bargain on Versatility and skills in general.<br>
<br>
<br>
While I agree with you Haemish that Twohanders should be a viable choice for doing damage, I don't think that giving DW, and Taking away plate armor option is a good trade off, when an Armsman can do equal damage and DOES get the armor.  Make sense?<br>

There doesn't seem to be an advantage gained for doing Duel Wield as a merc, but a huge disadvantage given by not getting the armour. Again, it may be that we haven't seen the advantage yet because the advantage becomes more noticeable at the higher levels, or with some of the faster gear? It seems the armsman doesn't really come into their own until they get plate/crossbows at level 15, but that they are more clearly defined as a tank early on than a Merc is. If DW doesn't give more damage, perhaps it interrupts spellcasting more than a single weapon? At below 10, we don't fight a lot of caster mobs, so it wouldn't be readily apparent. <br>

Oh, BTW, I saw your gravestone last night on the hill leading up to the Manes Demons in Camelot Hills. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Well, I'll play the Merc till level 10, if I even can, and see how it goes..  But the more I play, the more I keep wanting to ditch it to play a Hibby Ranger<br>

My only melee has been my Thane. However, I can tell you my Cleric's opinion. Tanking for the group, I want and Armsman, a Mercenary or a Paladin.. in that order. Armsmen and Mercenaries are pretty close (from a healer's viewpoint) with the Paladin a distant third. If the Pally is taking the hits, someone has to chain heal through the fight is basically how it works. If there's a Pally in the group, expect them to draw the agro. They have a chant called Refresh, which is a great boon to the group. It's been the difference between a win and a wipeout on more than one occassion in fact. Unfortunately, it also is, flat out, the highest agro draw in the realm. Nothing I've seen can draw and hold agro like Refresh.<br>
<br>
Anyway, there ya have it. I don't know the particualars of the Mercenary class, but I know they make damn fine tanks!<br>
<br>
Oh, and they can fill the puller role much better than an Armsman, as well, though not as well as a Scout or Wizard (the two best pulling classes in the game in my opinion). Armsmen, post 15, can pull with their crossbow, but the range is very very limited. It's more useful as a damage adder during the pull or when chain-pulling is needed for group safety.<br>
