<br>
Is DAoC ready for prime time, or am I again going to be paying money to be a beta tester?   Is the game 99% stable?  Have they done any real stress testing?<br>
<br>
Will the release not allow me even a few days to try the different realms, or will I have to make a descision based on the limited data available from the website, and then stick with it whether I like it or not?<br>
<br>
If it is pick a realm and stay there, I'd have to say my first pick would be Celtic (Hibernia?) followed by Vikings.  Choosing Camelot probably had good marketing reasons, but some (most?) of actual Camelot mythology is Celtic anyway, but they want the Celts as a separate realm?  WTF?<br>
<br>
And Haemish, you do know that Picts spoke Gaelic which comes from Celtic, right?  (and they didn't have blue tatoos on their face, they covered their naked bodies in blue mud and charged into battle!) <p>-+<([{Q}])>+-

<br>
Right now, I think Hibernia is our best bet...  Got some friends from another EQ server going there too, I'd love to play with them =)<br>
<br>
Wether we choose Hibernia or not, my main character will be with them most likely, so erm.. yeah, choose Hibernia <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
In terms of implemented features being fleshed out and bugless, you'll find that what they do, they do pretty darn well.  The feel of the game is pretty good, and it doesn't really FEEL like a beta, however, right now, it still is.. There are features they just haven't implemented.  I haven't played with Tracking, but I hear it's in, though it was a recent addition.  There are ladders all over the place that you cannot yet go up or down, and.. That's really all I can think of.<br>
<br>
There's only one &quot;feature&quot; that seems buggy.. And that is the ability to Alt+Tab out of the game to Multi-task.. It crashes =P  Bugs the graphics a bit.<br>
Although I hear you wont' be able to do that in the final release.  Bah.<br>
<br>
Over all, it won't feel any more like a Beta test than present day EQ..<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Oh yes! This game is as stable (if not more so) than EQ, and definitely more so than EQ was on release. I wouldn't play it with a Voodoo3 card if you can avoid it, as it's much prettier with a GeForce2 or better (though a Voodoo 4 is much nicer than Voodoo3 and performs better). As for stress testing? Yes, they have. The last few times I've played it, the server counts have been 1900 and 1700 and the LD's were less than in a normal night of EQ (from other players...  I have only dropped twice at home in the whole beta). <br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Will the release not allow me even a few days to try the different realms, or will I have to make a descision based on the limited data available from the website, and then stick with it whether I like it or not?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You'll pretty much have to pick a realm for the server you play on. See my other suggestions for some ways &quot;around&quot; this as a guild. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;If it is pick a realm and stay there, I'd have to say my first pick would be Celtic (Hibernia?) followed by Vikings. Choosing Camelot probably had good marketing reasons, but some (most?) of actual Camelot mythology is Celtic anyway, but they want the Celts as a separate realm? WTF?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
The Camelot Mythology was mostly Anglo-Norman in culture, from the first written myths. The historical King Arthur would have been more Saxon than Celtic. What's really funny is that the Celts were actually Viking-type peoples, so all of the realms come from Midgard... right? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;And Haemish, you do know that Picts spoke Gaelic which comes from Celtic, right? (and they didn't have blue tatoos on their face, they covered their naked bodies in blue mud and charged into battle!) &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
It was called Woad... some kind of blue paste that they used as decoration. I think the berzerkers even expected it to provide the protection of armour in battle. There were a number of rather loosely related tribes in Ancient Brittania... Celts, Gaelic (which is descended from the Gauls in France I think), Picts.. Gam you can probably shed some more light on that? <br>

I knew it was called Woad, but wasn't sure if you did.  As to Arthurian myths that are Celtic, is not the Green Knight who cannot die an Arthurian myth?   The Green _Man_ is a Celtic myth, which has many similarities to the Green Knight.  And of course, the Normans took the land of Briton away from the original Breton inhabitants, who were also Celtic. <p>-+<([{Q}])>+-
