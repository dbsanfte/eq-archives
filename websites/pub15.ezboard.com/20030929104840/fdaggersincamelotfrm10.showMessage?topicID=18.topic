<br>
It was a while after dinner, almost dusk, that Brother Trappist found himself sitting alone outside the Abby on the hill that overlooked the road.  There were other things he should be doing but his mind was being pulled in several directions and waiting somewhat impatiently seemed to be the only thing he could really concentrate on.  He wished he were with the others hunting down the Middies.  He wished the other Daggers would get to the Abby so he could head out to catch up.  He wished a reply to the missive he sent to Camelot would return quickly, though he knew a response before the morning would be unlikely, even if a reply was that swift.<br>
<br>
A smile came to his face as he thought about William and remembered his own days before he joined the Order and before he joined the Daggers.  He couldn't think of a better home.  He wondered if, one day, William would wish to join the Daggers.  He was certain William had a friar's heart and would, no doubt, follow that path for his life.  Brother Trappist had surreptitiously surveyed the stables that evening just after dinner and found that William had decided to delay his stable-tending duties a bit and was giving a hay bale a serious going over with the staff Brother Trappist had left him.  <br>
<br>
He chuckled at the memory.  William's skill with the staff was utterly non-existent but what he lacked in skill he more than made up for in focus.  He felt a kinship of spirit with William and was glad Brother Jamus had pointed him out.  As he watched, William learned to keep his balance better and he saw that William was learning to use the staff's torque to help stabilize him.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Intuitive reflexes...not bad, </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he remembered thinking.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Yep, he'll make a damn fine friar,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Brother Trappist thought as a grin came to his face.<br>
<br>
A movement along the road brought Brother Trappist out of his reverie. In the distance he saw what looked like 3 horse-drawn carts coming up the road.  It was nearly night and no caravans were due till the next mid-morning.  It took them some time to approach and he scrutinized them closely -- not exactly fearing anything but applying a cautious watchfulness that all those defending the realm had acquired since the realm breaches became a stark reality.<br>
<br>
As the carts drew closer he saw a familiar face.  &quot;Milar!&quot; he called out as he waved.  Milar waved back but without much energy.<br>
<br>
The carts came to a stop as the lead cart, driven by a haggard man in travel-stained clothes and an accent that was common in Lynn Barfog spoke to Brother Trappist.  &quot;Be ye of Abby?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, after a manner.  Are you seeking lodgings or trade?&quot;  Brother Trappist replied formally as was the custom of the Abby.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, nay, we be seek neither.  We hired to deliver for Churchman,&quot; he waved a hand in the direction of Milar, &quot;and we just get on with job and be on way,&quot; the man replied.<br>
<br>
They approached the Abby and Brother Trappist waved them by the guards and the Abby doors were opened.  Brother Trappist led them into the Abby and watched as they unloaded three boxes, (one large and flat, two much taller and half the length of the first) just inside the stables in a disused stall.  The two heavy boxes stacked on top of the longer one.  Milar sat heavily beside the boxes, using them as a back-rest, as the cart and driver left the Abby.<br>
<br>
&quot;Milar, it's good to see you,&quot; Brother Trappist said, and smiled as he continued, &quot;And you look like hell.&quot;<br>
<br>
Milar looked as if he had to pull himself from far away to answer.  &quot;I hate riding in carts.  Makes me sea-sick,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
A few strangely awkward moments hung between them before Brother Trappist asked him where the others were.<br>
<br>
&quot;Priestly, Cewen, and I were at Snow station waiting for Annaidia and Rasha.  Rasha sent word that Annaidia had to deliver something to the Captain at the Defenders of Albion in Camelot at the last minute and that they'd spend the night there and head out early in the morning to meet us.  We were just reading that when someone fell off their horse outside the station.  From what the guy was babbling it sounded like the Anfanc got too close to the little town in Barfog.  Priestly and I decided to go help and left Cewen to meet Rasha and Annaidia and tell them to meet us here.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was pretty messy in Barfog.  We were rezzing people left and right but finally drove it off.  The merchants were pretty happy and offered us this crap,&quot; he slapped one of the boxes, &quot;for our trouble.  It'll make good salvage.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where's P-man?&quot; Brother Trappist asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm...not sure,&quot; Milar said distractedly.  &quot;We got, ah, separated...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You OK, Milar?&quot; Brother Trappist asked.<br>
<br>
Milar sighed deeply and his eyes looked read.  &quot;It's just been a very long day...&quot; he said.  &quot;I take it Vince isn't here.  When's he gonna be back?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No idea.  They left a few hours ago to go hunt down some Middies that breached the Realm wall, I doubt we'll see them before tomorrow at the earliest,&quot; Brother Trappist said.  &quot;Come on, let's get you some food and quarters...and a stiff drink or three.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Trappist got a tray of food for Milar and brought to him in the room several of the Daggers were sharing and told Milar to get some rest.  Adding that if Milar didn't get some rest of his own volition, he'd oblige Milar by knocking him unconscious.  Milar has smiled weakly but left little to interpretation of his desire to be alone.<br>
<br>
Late into the night, Milar had removed his armor and was sitting on the meager bed, knees tucked to him and his chin upon his chest.  He hadn't so much as glanced at the tray Brother Trappist had left for him.  No candle was lit and the room was quite dark, the only illumination from a small window at the far side of the room that faced a near-by building.<br>
<br>
It was a long night for Milar.<br>
<br>
He didn't sleep.<br>
<br>
 *  *  *<br>
<br>
It had started off as such as quiet morning.  A pleasantly fragrant breeze blew by the Abby, carrying the smell of wild flowers on it.  Song birds were audible in the distance.  Even the sun seemed to be beaming down lighter than usual this morn and it remained cool and pleasant.  The women prepared the morning meal for their families in a muted concert, all of them enjoying the rare peace.<br>
<br>
Until the children found a new play-toy and a gaggle of them came screaming around the corner, overflowing with innocent children's laughter.  Mothers dropped what they were doing and ran for the kids, disaster recovery on their minds.<br>
<br>
The crisis was averted shortly and recovered as well as could be expected in the speedy fashion of experienced parents.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>**</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Now Cassa, don't you go bothering those nice folk with your pestering questions, you hear me?&quot; her mother said in a kindly voice.  She didn't really expect Cassa to obey her though, knowing Cassa's unquenchable curiosity, but she had to make the effort even for precocious 8-year-olds.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Mother,&quot; Cassa replied in typical fashion, knowing she had absolutely every intention of pestering someone with questions just as soon as she had half an opportunity.<br>
<br>
Cassa's mother packed away the brush and comb she'd been trying to make her little girl presentable with, though without a hot bath and soap it was only a marginal improvement -- that bath would have to wait till after supper.  She turned Cassa around and looked at her sternly, &quot;No more mud fights with the other children, you understand?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Mother,&quot; she said a giggle that brightened as her mother's stern expression melted to the warm smile she always had for Cassa.  &quot;Now, go find your father and tell him to hurry up at the forge or he'll miss breakfast,&quot;<br>
<br>
 *  *  *<br>
 <br>
After passing along the message to her father she was drawn, as expected, to seek out those exciting adventurers.  She knew many of them had left the Abby the previous day but she hoped some had stayed behind.  Out behind the stables she found, much to her excitement, that indeed some had stayed behind.<br>
<br>
Peeking around the corner, she saw a friar using two posts driven into the ground next to each other as a target.  Upon it he was executing blindingly fast and precise blows to specific places on the posts where, on a man, they would inflict the most pain and damage.  She listened to the painful -crack- as his staff hit the posts and saw wood-splinters fly at each hit.  She could only imagine how much it must hurt to be hit like that.  She waited, unsure of how to strike up a conversation, until she saw the emblemed cloak tossed over a pack and leather armor, obviously discarded due to the day's rising heat.<br>
<br>
Curiosity overcame her caution and she crept over to the pile of gear.  The friar had his back to her and the discarded armor and pack.  As she approached it she saw the glimmer of silver beneath the cloak.  Remembering the dagger that Dulcette had shown her the other night she was sorely tempted to take a peek at another one.<br>
<br>
She approached quietly as a stalking cat and moved the cloak aside just enough for her to see the blade in it's simple leather sheath, far too common for such an uncommon blade.  Just as she touched the hilt of the fine blade and felt the cool metal on her skin, she saw the blur of a staff and heard it cutting the air toward her wrist.  She let out a yelp of fear and panic as the staff hit her wrist but the touch was soft as a kitten and firm as stone.<br>
<br>
&quot;That would be unwise, little miss,&quot; said the friar in an even tone.<br>
<br>
&quot;I-I'm sorry,&quot; she said, her voice shaky from the fading panic and the expectation of a broken wrist, &quot;I just wanted to see it again.  Dulcette's was so pretty.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said the friar as he lifted his staff from it's pinning of her wrist and crouching down beside her, &quot;this is not a blade to be trifled with.  It is of fine and rare quality and extremely sharp.&quot;  As he said this, he picked up the sheathed blade and began to unsheathe it slowly.  &quot;It is also a symbol of the most powerful force in the realm.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the sunlight, the dagger sparkled and showed off it's exquisite construction.  Cassa could see why such a fine blade was so prized.  She'd seen her father make many swords and blades but never anything approaching excellent craftsmanship of this simple dagger.  She read the name emblazoned upon it:  Trappist.<br>
<br>
&quot;How did you get it?  And what's it a symbol of?&quot; Cassa asked in wonder.<br>
<br>
Brother Trappist, sat on the ground next to her and drove the dagger into the ground between them.  He sat quietly for a moment and decided his practice could wait.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where did I get it?&quot; Brother Trappist mused. &quot;I am a friar.  The monks and bishops tend to look down on us; the monks wonder why we want to leave the Abby and fight and the bishops and other church hierarchy frown upon our wild nature.  We are a very tight-knit community because of that.  When I was younger I was fortunate to read missives and treatise from Brother Vincent on the nature of what a Friar is and what we contribute to our realm and it's people.  It touched me and sounded to my ears much as my heart told me a Friar should be.  And I also learned that he was the leader of the Silver Daggers -- I confess, after listening to the monks and church hierarchy for so long, I yearned to hear the words of a leader who didn't think us aberrations.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cassa sat enraptured as Brother Trappist continued. Brother Trappist, for his part, was delighted with his audience.<br>
<br>
&quot;I left all that I knew behind and traveled a great distance to become a member of the Silver Daggers.  As an initiate, they showed me the kindness and understanding they would show an equal.  And let me accompany them on adventures to places I'd never even known existed -- and faced some terrors that still give me nightmares -- even though I'm sure I was more a burden than I was helpful (though none would say that).  I've never met a band of people so willing to help each other with only the joy of assistance as their reward.  I was excited that one day I would wear the emblem -- and terrified that I may not be equal in calibre for I would have an emptiness in me ever after.<br>
<br>
&quot;We sat at a meeting of the guild in the fair city of Camelot.  We sat, as always, in a circle after the true Arthurian spirit.  Each sat with their dagger before them, glimmering in the twilight.  Upon each dagger was a name, upon each hilt the jewels of their rank in the realm.  Upon the dagger of each officer was a gold ring to signify their responsibility and upon Brother Vincent's dagger were two gold rings, to signify his responsibilities both the circle of members and the circle of officers.  In the setting sun, Brother Vincent's dagger sparkled with gold fire.  Mesmerized by the sight, I was startled to hear Brother Vincent say my name with a great voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;I leapt to my feet and came forward as was demanded of me. Then in a voice of great sincerity he asked 'Are you ready for a reading of your crimes?'  I was aghast at first, trying to remember what crimes I could have committed but I said that yes, I was.  Then I was regaled with an admonishment for being carted away by the city guard from the bars in Camelot 3 times the previous week.  Other members jeered and some called for me to be thrown from the battlements!&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Trappist couldn't help laughing at the memory but Cassa was aghast.  &quot;That's awful!&quot; she espoused.  Brother Trappist laughed lightly at her response.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, it was only the jest of good friends.  I was told the minimum that a drunken friar should be dragged home by the city guard was 5 times a week, not a paltry 3!  They teased me about a few other things too, roaring with laughter as Brother Vincent would list a new crime, such as my greatest transgression:  I had ordered a jerkin instead of a robe for new armor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A jerkin?&quot; she giggled, &quot;but that's silly!&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Trappist laughed deeply as he replied, &quot;Aye, aye, it was.  But I was much younger then and wanted a chance of pace.  I assure you I regretted it the moment I put it on!<br>
<br>
&quot;After the reading of my 'crimes' Brother Vincent grew serious once again.  He looked me straight in the eye as he said, gravely:  Brother Trappist, do you accept the honor and responsibility it is to be a Silver Dagger?<br>
<br>
&quot;I swallowed at the gravity of his question and answered: Yes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brother Vincent withdrew this most exquisite dagger from his robes and held it by the blade, extending the hilt me as he said, &quot;Then take this dagger as a symbol all that we hold dear.  Let it be a symbol of all that we hold dear for so long as you walk with us.'  <br>
<br>
&quot;As I put my hand on the hilt, seeing that no name had been inscribed, he said in a commanding voice:  Born in fire, Bred in flame, Stronger than steel, such is the heart of a Silver Dagger!<br>
<br>
&quot;The dagger glowed as he spoke and grew very warm in my hand.  He looked at me seriously and held my gaze.  Then he said softly, 'Welcome, Trappist' and as he did a fire blew across the blade and as I looked down, my name was emblazoned with fire upon it and it looked as you see it now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Roars and cheers went up from my fellow Daggers but I was caught in that moment. I stared at the blade that carried my name. I couldn't think of a happier moment.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And that, young Cassa, is how I came to possess this fine dagger.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cassa looked at Brother Trappist in awe of his retelling and a small understanding of what the dagger represented to him.  Then she tilted her head and said, &quot;I thought you said it was a symbol of the most powerful force in the realm.  What magic is that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Trappist, seeing Cassa's mother round the corner of the stable in obvious search for her wayward daughter, stood with fluid grace and retrieved his dagger. Then he smiled at Cassa and said, &quot;Why, Friendship, of course.&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>/**</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

 *  *  *<br>
 <br>
Milar sat on the bed still, even though it was well past noon.  His muscles ached from disuse but his mind was elsewhere.  He scarcely noticed when the door opened and an acolyte walked in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; the acolyte said as he brought in a tray of warm but simple fare and sat it down on the bed next to the one Milar occupied.  &quot;I was told to bring this to you, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
Milar looked at the acolyte with a grave expression that succinctly said:  go away.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, sir, but Brother Trappist said you were to eat or I was to pound you into submission -- and put the food down your unconscious throat, if I had to,&quot; the boy said.  He had the look of intent to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>try</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it at least.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, he did, did he?&quot; Milar asked, gruffly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.  And I'd suggest you comply before this gets messy,&quot; the acolyte said evenly.<br>
<br>
It was a surreal experience for Milar.  &quot;I'm not accustomed to acceding to threats of puny acolytes,&quot; he said unpleasantly.  He wasn't sure he was angry but he really wasn't at all interested in talking to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anyone</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
The boy picked up a bowl of porridge and walked over to Milar.  A thin spire of steam wafted into the air above it.  He held it out to Milar.  &quot;Eat it...or wear it,&quot; he said with gravity uncommon in such a young voice.  &quot;Your call.&quot;<br>
<br>
Milar could see the boy had no fear (or at least hid it well) and was quite ready to dump a bowl of porridge over his head.  Milar, despite himself, started laughing.  And kept laughing.  Every time he tried to get a grip on himself, he'd see the boy's face looking sterner and sterner and more impatient and he'd start laughing all over again.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's it, over the head,&quot; the boy said and moved to dump the bowl on Milar.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, no, wait,&quot; Milar said, reaching for the bowl, &quot;I'll eat it, I'll eat it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.  Here's the rest,&quot; the boy said, moving the tray from the other bed to Milar's.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's your name?&quot; Milar said with a mouth full of porridge.  The boy was still looking at him, making sure he really <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>was</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> going to eat.<br>
<br>
&quot;William,&quot; he replied simply.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, William,&quot; Milar said, feeling better than he expected now that he had a few spoon-fulls of porridge in him.  &quot;Do you know if Brother Vincent is here?&quot;<br>
<br>
Milar saw the boy's eyes sparkle at the mention of Brother Vincent.  <br>
<br>
&quot;They left yesterday,&quot; William said and told Milar of the circumstances of their departure, in greater detail than Brother Trappist had given him yesterday.  Milar's heart sank a bit, feeling like he let them down by being late, even if it couldn't be helped.  Milar had almost finished eating by the time William concluded his tale.  <br>
Seeing that Milar hadn't stuffed anything down his throat for the past several minutes, he handed him a hunk of bread from the tray in a quite deliberate manner -- and seemed quite intent on staying and ensuring that Milar finished eating every bite.  &quot;Are you always this...&quot; Milar began to ask and fell at a loss of word to describe William's behavior.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dedicated?&quot; William filled in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pushy,&quot; Milar countered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Only when it comes to taking care of my friends,&quot; he said evenly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Friend?&quot; Milar half-laughed, half-choked, &quot;We're friends?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a friend to the Daggers that were here yesterday and a friend to Brother Trappist.  Brother Trappist is your friend and guildmate.  He's worried about you so I'm worried about you.  And I'll do whatever it takes to take care of you,&quot; William said in a voice that said he felt the gravity of his broad statements and considered it the most obvious thing in the world to do.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A friend of Trappist...well the boy sure does <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>talk</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> like a friar</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->,&quot; Milar through to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, friend William,&quot; Milar said, feeling almost a step to wellness of spirit as he stood up, &quot;Perhaps you can tell me where I can get a bath.&quot;<br>
<br>
William picked up the bite-sized piece of bread crust that Milar had left and handed it to him purposefully with a &quot;first things first&quot; look.  Milar, taking the crust, burst out laughing once again and clapped the boy on the shoulder as he walked past to lead Milar to a much needed bath.<br>
<br>

It was, in fact, the first fully written segment.  It was supposed to stand alone after the events of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Shockwaves</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (which, I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>swear</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, is the next one out, really, for real this time) as sort of a break in the tension...but the lead-up to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Shockwaves</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, as was noted before, got <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>real</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> long (6000 words) and had to be broken off.  Well the time-line of that segment, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Deceptions and Disasters</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, took events into the next day and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Shockwaves</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> will extend that time-line further...I didn't want to have to flip back over a full day in time to catch the story up so I resequenced this one and added the necessary &quot;wrapping paper&quot; around it to extend the other thread of the story and set up the events in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Tears</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brothervincent>Brother Vincent</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.silverdaggers.net/img/ge.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 5/5/03 1:29:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luric>Luric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 671<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(5/5/03 7:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.zimmers.net/mer/daggerimages/mugshot.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  TWD - Reflections of Ladon [1.12]  </span><hr size=1> ROFLMAO!!!!<br>

Really Vincent, this is such a fun read for everyone. It is like a weekly serial from the 1940's...you keep checking back to see if the next installment is written yet. This dusty old corner of the website is now one of the places I look at first. Well done brother.<br>
