<br>
The Story and the Loot<br>
<br>
Well I was very lucky on Saturday to be in the right place at the right time (for once!).  I had been with Koku/Hira/Cadusae in Caldey helping them to get some xp.  The group broke as folks had stuff to do in RL, so I headed back to Ft. Gwyn.  As I was there...I noticed more and more people trickling in, especially from AP, Paradox, CoP, etc.  I knew this wasn't normally a mecca, and figured a Sidi raid was in the offing.<br>
<br>
After talking with Gts he confirmed that AP had planned a Sidi raid for their guild to start forming at 3.  Coincidentally, another alliance (not sure which one) had planned a Sidi raid at the same time.  So they decided to combine under the leadership of Hawkes of AP.  There were a little over 50 people non-anon, so we had 7 groups at least and the vast majority of people were lvl 50.<br>
<br>
I was about to catch a horse and head out when I decided to take a shot and /b my availability.  Turns out a group needed a cleric and away we went.  Well...it wasn't quite that fast...took almost 2 hours from the time they first started arriving until we zoned into Sidi!<br>
<br>
Anyhow....we progressed through the first five keyholders with no problem.  However, though we defeated the Bane of Hope to open the 6th door, it remained locked.  So we put in an emergency appeal and sat down to go through the loot we'd accumulated so far.  Here's what we got in the first hour or so of the raid:<br>
<br>
1.  Etherbound Crystal:  15 Dex/Con/Quick, 3 Shield<br>
2.  Sanguine Silk Sleeves:  Wiz only, 3 cold/earth, 10% crush, 8% slash<br>
3.  Sanguin Bowyers Boots:  Scout only, 40hp, 9% cold/heat, 7% energy<br>
4.  Sacristan Belt:  30 Str, 30 Con, 3 xbow, 3 shield<br>
5.  Staff of Wind and Ice:  13 power, 33 Int, 50 levels wind/ice<br>
6.  Banes Ring:  30 Cha, 30 Con, Cold 11%<br>
7.  Cobalt Weapon Enamel:  apparently used to dye Sidi weapons only<br>
8.  Staff of Sight &amp; Servitude (2 of these):  13 power, 33 Int, 50 levels Deathsight and Deathservant<br>
9.  Sanguine Silk Gloves:  40hp, 3 Fire magic, 10% Crush, 8% Thrust<br>
10.  Azure Arcanium Crusher (2H):  3 Parry, 3 2H, 15 Str, 11% Slash<br>
11.  Ebony Defiler (1H):  4 Parry, 4 Slash, 3 Dual Wield, 22 Str<br>
12.  Blood Spire Cloak:  40hp, 15 Str, 15 Pie, 6% Body<br>
13.  Azure Sleeves of Notes:  3 Stealth, 40hp, 21 Dex, 27 Con<br>
14.  Sapphire Encrusted Necklace:  30 Cha, 6 power<br>
<br>
My group got very luck on the rolls and ended up with 5 of the 14 items.  I was fortunate and won the Blood Spire Cloak!!  We actually got more drops as we progressed through the evening, but after we wiped and released I left the cg as I had already gotten an item.  I know we got another Wiz staff and something called an Embryonic Wrap (ring?).  <br>
<br>
We had actually just finished item 12 when one of the scouts reported that door 6 had been unlocked by a CSR.  We quickly finished loot and made our way through bosses 7, 8 and 9.  We found ourselves at the base of boss 10, &quot;The Host&quot;.  We went up the stairs and met him along with several friends.  I'm not quite sure what happened but we all got wiped and no rezzers got out.  Someone said something about a named roaming mob that we got unlucky with (i.e. he happened to be at the top of the stairs).  It was all so chaotic and new to me that I couldn't verify this.<br>
<br>
All in all it was an absolute blast!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
The Learnings<br>
I think this may have been Hawkes first time to lead a Sidi raid, but he may have been on them before.  He knew some of the info but we got a couple of things out of order.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
I was able to follow our progress in the Prima guide Sidi map which helped tremendously.  Besides the fluke with the Bane of Hope, here are some things I observed and heard in /cg:<br>
<br>
1.  It's essential that on each floor, you kill *all* of the monsters on that floor before you kill the named mob.  If you don't do this the named calls a ton of those mobs to help and it's usually a guaranteed TPW.  We stuck to this basic strategy and did fine, never fighting more than about 4 enemies at any given time.<br>
<br>
2.  My mental model was that as we defeated each keyholder, someone in the group that did the most damage would get a tangible key in their inventory which would unlock the next door.  However this is not the case.  Simply killing the keyholder triggers the door to unlock.<br>
<br>
3.  Makeup of the Zerg:  We had at least 15 pally/arms in the zerg, probably more.  I think that was key as we had plenty of meaty tanks to take the aggro and chop them down to size.<br>
<br>
4.  Spectral Provisioner, Key 2:  This guy wanders out of his room into the main stairwell room once you unlock the door to his alcove.  We ended up fighting him by the stairwell on that first level.  He is apparently immune to all spells and I personally got messages from a stun and smite that he was not affected by those types of spells.  I would expect you have to have pure melee to beat him.<br>
<br>
5.  Silencer, Key 5:  This is a giant blob, similar to the many blobs you see in SI areas.  The key thing about the Silencer is that he adapts to the various damages that you are doing.  Once he adapts, you see a message in blue text in the chatbox to that affect.  You'd see something like the following:<br>
&quot;Following Norwoods crushing attack, the Silencer adapts and is no longer vulnerable to that form of damage&quot;<br>
<br>
Anyone that hits with crush after that point is teleported to the bottom of the &quot;hole&quot; where there is a pool of water and a ladder up.  They have to run back to join the battle.  I saw messages about crush, slash, thrust and matter damage.  I assume there were so many people hitting it with so many damage types that it couldn't deflect everything.  <br>
<br>
6.  Soul Reckoner, Key 9:  There are several flames surrounding the Soul Reckoner.  These have to be defeated before you can target the Reckoner (I believe).  I tried to target him through the flames and could not.  He looked really cool!<br>
<br>
7.  The Host, Key 10:  The Host is located at the top of some stairs.  The *real* host that you want to focus your attacks on is the one that appears as a ghost.  There are several other skellie warriors around it that say &quot;host&quot;, but these will disappear if you kill the ghost version (or so I was told).  I have no idea what the room at the top of the stairs looks like or what else is there...but I do know that at least 4-5 other mobs jumped into the fight.  Whether this was due to some roaming mobs or mobs that inhabit the room, I do not know.<br>
<br>
8.  When going down &quot;the hole&quot; to a sub level (where you fight the Bane of Hope and unlock doors 5 &amp; 6 to get to Lord Sanguis), you can just jump in and land in the water unharmed.  You can also jump out toward the ladder and as you fall down you will stick to it.   I did not personally take any damage from the fall, nor did anyone else that I know of.<br>
<br>
That's about it!  As more of us go on raids, or have additional information to supplement this report, please post it here to build an archive of knowledge/strategy.<br>

Okay, supposedly if you collect a full suit of Caer Sidi Armor, plus the jewelry only wearable when you ARE wearing a full suit, you will max all of, or close to all of your stats.<br>
<br>
SO! In part to benefit my Equipment Worksheet, and in part to help all you loot-hunters, let's please list EXACTLY any loot we have found that is scout specific from Sidi!<br>
<br>
No random drops please, only repeatable named drops.<br>
<br>
And yes I got this idea from VNboards but they suck at posting stats [I think it had +22 to two stats -- that helps me thanks]<br>
<br>
I will start - <br>
<br>
Legend Slayer's Quiver - Gem<br>
+40 hits, +4 longbow, +4 slash, +4 thrust<br>
<br>
Agless Eessnce Gem - Mispelled by Mythic<br>
+3 stealth, +15 dex, +15 con, +15 qui<br>
<br>
Legend Slayer's Longbow - Longbow<br>

<br>
Shadow Whisper's Longbow - Longbow<br>
16.5 dps 5.0 spd 100% qua 35% bon<br>
+4 long bow, +3 stealth, +22 dex, +22 quick<br>
<br>
Cobalt Small Kite Shield<br>
100% qua 35% bon<br>
+6 shield, +3 stealth, +15 str, +6% crush<br>
<br>
Fire Thorn Vest - Chest Piece<br>
AF 102 100% qua 35% bon<br>
+15 Con, +15 Qui, +11% Body, +11% Heat<br>
Procs a 5 dps Dmg Shield<br>
[This Chest is not the chest from the matching suit of armor] <br>
<br>
Sanguine Bowyer's Helm - Head piece - Graphicless Crown<br>
AF 102 100% qua 35% bon<br>
+40 hp, +9% body, +9% matter, +7% spirit<br>

<br>

+3 Slash, +3 Thrust, +21 Str, +27 Dex<br>
Reactive Spirit Proc - 95DD <br>
<br>
Sanguine Bowyers Boots - Boots piece<br>
AF 102 100% qua 35% bon <br>
+40 Hits, +9% Heat, +9% Cold, +7% Energy<br>
Reactive Spirit Proc - 95DD<br>
<br>

<br>

+3 Shield +3 Stealth +27 Con +21 Quick<br>
<br>
Sanguine Bowyer's Gauntlets - Gloves Piece<br>
+40 hits, +9% crush, +9% slash, +7% thrust<br>
Reactive DD proc 95 Value unknown damage <br>
<br>
<br>
Specifically I am looking for the Studded Armor - for example the chest piece has a NICE reverse heal on it.. 220 hp or so.<br>
<br>
So, anyone lucky enough to own any of this yet?<br>
<br>
Edit - Update on Legend Slayer Bow.<br>
Edit - Update on Armor! Thanks Andro <br>
Edit - Update on Cobalt shield and new pieces from Ed.<br>
Edit - Snype, I love you, the holy grail IMO is found!<br>
Edit - Thanks for the corrections impulse, and added leggings.<br>
Edit - New Gem from Caderi!<br>
Edit - I found the gloves.<br>
<br>
SO the full suit is complete - In it, we have:<br>
<br>
120/200 hits<br>
9/26 Crush/Slash/Body/Matter/Heat/Cold resist<br>
7/26 Thrust/Energy/Spirit resist<br>
3/11 Stealth, Shield, Slash, Thrust<br>
4/11 Longbow<br>
49/75 Dex<br>
27/75 Con<br>
21/75 Quick<br>
43/75 Str<br>
<br>
<br>
I've been trolling VN as well, big thread in the SI forum, another in the albion forum, and I STILL don't see anything I would consider a scout slasher, ie, a slasher without parry, cs, dw. I'm sooo jealous of Dulce's minstrel slasher.<br>
<br>
As a side note, the number weapons dropping for really oddball specs bugs me. On our last run we had one for a crush merc, slash reaver, and crush polearmsman.<br>
<br>
Bows do look nice, however. If you want 5.0 speed now that means a bow ( not hunting, long- or heavy long-, just bow) with a 2000 range- these are full longbow range bows. I bet with good buffs I could get a crit under 3 seconds with one of those...<br>
