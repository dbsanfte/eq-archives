WARNING ** Major Venting Up Ahead** (disclaimer - those who were new tonite to the raids, I ask you read it is all, but don't take it I am directing things to you)<br>
<br>
The FACTS<br>
- we had three groups tonite, the majority being longtime RvRers.<br>
- with the exception of one &lt;my mistake&gt; all group leaders have been on enough raids to know how they are run.<br>
- Lorne from Seekers, the battle commander, didn't show up.<br>
- Belce took up the position as not to disappoint those who did.<br>
- Belce asked for my assistance, as he felt it was required and I have had alot of group RvR experience of late.<br>
<br>
The PART you will not like<br>
- if you want to do your own thing and get your RPs, don't come to an organized raid where you are to work as a team.  You got RP envy, do it on your own time and quit wasting mine and anyone else's who showed up to be a part of a team.  Unless you are a STEALTH character, your ass is to be with your group 100% of the time.<br>
<br>
- if you are a Group Leader, your NUMBER ONE responsiblity is conveying the messages to your group.  We can only have 20 people in a chat.  I put the stealthers in tonite, the lead group and the minstrels.  Your group is depending on you, if you can't cut it, there is no shame in telling me.  Some people are slower typers than others, and don't want the responsiblity and have told me so.  That is fine by me, I have no problem with that.<br>
<br>
- if you are a Group Leader, don't tell me who you are picking to put in your group.  I am telling you for a reason who is in your group.  Don't like it, I don't care unless you have SOUND reasoning as to why.  (i.e. Dulcette you have three minstrels in this group and no healers).<br>
<br>
- dont' trust the Raid/Battle Commander, then back out of doing it.  I don't need those who don't trust my judgement.<br>
Spend 10sp and go back home.<br>
<br>
- if you are a member of a group and your GL does something against what the orders are, SPEAK up immediately.  That's teamwork.<br>
<br>
- use /follow at ALL TIMES, except on Stealth players or the raid commander.<br>
<br>
- Group Leaders pick a MA immediately if not assigned for whole raid and make sure everyone has it hotkeyed.<br>
<br>
- Going on an RvR raid, print a map.<br>
<br>
- reform when you are told to and where.  The number one reason I called off tonites raid.  HERE IT IS....  I asked four times to meet on the West side of MF1 on south corner.  Belce then asked twice before one of the other groups moved to us.  Finally he repeated himself two more times, for me to watch one group charge down the hill along with other Albions toward the tower.  <br>
<br>
- Listen Listen Listen Listen Listen and then follow the orders.<br>
<br>
- don't tell me INC, don't chit chat in chat, be specific.....Middies INC from DC to MF1 in valley.  INC means nada to a Raid commander who is trying to save lives and get realm points as opposed to just getting RPs.<br>
*************************************<br>
<br>
Now you are all asking, what the hell is she going on about.<br>
<br>
These raids are to make us successful.  To get the most realm points collectively, with the least amount of deaths.  To make us a refined unit so we can take down a keep of our own someday and maybe even one day take a relic.  Isn't that why we are playing the game.  Now we can do it a  haphazard kind of why with a call to arms, or we can be a well-oiled machine.  <br>
I put MY personal gaming time and effort, into learning RvR and all the techniques and strategies, so that WE as a guild and possibly an alliance can learn from them.  I am fortunate that other guilds wish me in their groups and that is where I learn from.  I am NO LONGER wasting MY time and anyone elses who wants to work as a team, by running any more of these events. IT'S NOT worth it to me anymore, especially when you can't get people to follow a simple instruction.  I WILL run one group RvR excursions and will work my way up to two groups eventually, when I know we can work together.<br>
Please note...yes I MAKE MISTAKES.  I make bad calls.  I run us into perfect setups, BUT I am the one who comes forward to assist us all in a more successful gaming experience and I take FULL RESPONSIBILITY for when I screw up.  No one feels more shame, then when I make a bad call and we have TPW.<br>
<br>
Tonite was an embarrassment to both guilds and especially to the newbies who came out.  We are better than this, but tonite we didn't prove it.<br>
<br>
To those who it was their first time, I am truly sorry that I called the raid and left you hanging there.  If you knew me well, you would know how frustrated I had to be, to do that.  I actually had to go afk and go and sit down and calm down before I could come back and deal with my own group.  And to Worst, I owe you an apology.  This was your first big RvR raid and I shouldn't have had you as a Group Leader.  I have complete faith in your competency but what I forgot is that you hadn't had the exposure of a larger scale.  So hun, I am sorry for putting that on you without even asking.<br>
<br>
Love me, hate me, but what is said is a diplomatic truth to tonite's events, considering all that we know together and have learned.<br>
<br>

<br>
No matter the scale, each member's actions are important and critical.  If you are in a group, your actions can keep that group alive or get it wiped out, no matter if it's a group of 2 or a group/raid of 200.  Your group depends on you.  Period.<br>
<br>
Everyone makes mistakes.  People get lost.  Look away from their screen for few seconds.  Miss a line in the chatbox.  It happens.  I lost my group once today b/c I reached over to pat my dog.  *shrug*  Mistakes happen.<br>
<br>
These RvR events are meant to be fun and even large scale ones <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> can</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be fun and fast-paced.  I stress <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> can</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> because it has a few perquisites.  And if they aren't met, very few if anyone has a good time.<br>
<br>
The most <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> fundamental</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> thing that each person in a group needs to do is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> L I S T E N</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  If you can not listen, can not subordinate your individual desires for the needs of the whole, *do not attend the raid* -- and while you're at it go solo or log the heck out of the game because you will be a liability in a exp group as well.  <br>
<br>
When you are part of an exp group, you have to work together, you have to be where you are supposed to be, you have to do your job efficiently.  What the hell makes anyone think they need to do any <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> less</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> when in RvR?  Especially when you aren't holding up 7 people but 3-4 times that?  <br>
<br>
Simple, common sense should dictate all of this.  If you are screwing around and get killed, SOMEbody has to find and rez you, while this happens, the raid force can not proceed.  They are stuck waiting for someone to rez you and rebuff you and YOU are less effective b/c you are rez sick.  Now while all this occurs, the other 20-odd people sit around getting frustrated and bored.  If you are not tasked with sheathed perimeter security or some other job and are outside of buff range of your healer YOU ARE NOT WHERE YOU BELONG (I know you guys don't do this kinda stuff exp hunting).  If you die, find your group once you get rezed and *get buffed again!*  If your healer/buffer dies, once they are rezed find your group once you get rezed and *get buffed again!*  You are part of your group's ability to survive, stay with them to protect them.  NEVER take the battle to the enemy unless a Charge is called -- ESPECIALLY AT A FORTIFICATION because your casters are ordered up on the walls -- because you will out-run your caster support and often your healers.  You wouldn't do this fighting mobs, why do it in RvR??<br>
<br>
All this stuff causes wasted time.  All of it contributes to the slow pace of events.  Slow-pace = less fun.  All of it is common sense that I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> know</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> every experienced player knows.<br>
<br>
What I found utterly unfathomable, however, was the complete lack of listening skills on the part of a large segment of the raid.  There is no reason an instruction should need to be repeated three times (let alone the number of time some instructions had to be repeated during this raid).  No reason why when we are trying to regroup that people should be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> running away from the raid group to get that extra RP because someone thinks there might be someone behind that tower</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  There is absolutely no reason why another group moving through the area should cause ANY disturbance despite anything they say or yell since <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> all your instructions come from your group leader in /group</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that they've gotten from the /chat group.  There is no excuse for non-stealthers getting killed outside the healing range of their healer when told to regroup.  And while we're at it, there is utterly *no* reason anyone *other* than the raid commander for *anyone* to issue an order to &quot;fall back,&quot; &quot;attack,&quot; or in fact do *anything* i the /chat channel but provide information in the battle situation -- this is 100x more critical when the raid is small enough to have most or all of it IN the /chat group...this just leads to confusion and frustration for everyone.<br>
<br>
In short:  There's just no excuse for holding up a raid just to get a damned realm point.<br>
<br>
Hidien felt bad enough about the problems to apologize to us for the behavior of some of the SoL members.  And I extend my sincere apologies to SoL for the behavior of some of the Dagger members and I know Belce and Haemish feel the same way.  <br>

<br>
First Dulcette, I apologize for not communicating more clearly with you that because this was my FIRST raid, I had no clue as to the following:<br>
<br>
1) Role of group leader<br>
2) Basic responsibility of our group (mostly casters) - i.e. hang back - enter melee (would have thought the former)<br>
3) Group number - never knew if we were 1, 2, or 3<br>
4) After Forich went LD, Thor became our group leader (most exp level 41 Pally)<br>
5) Sorry wasn't even sure what MF1, MF2 were. <br>
6) Did we have a primary objective for the group as a whole?  From where I was (on auto follow of our group leader) - very confusing.<br>
<br>
I never felt our group was in sink, never got a confimation that Thor had been invited into chat.  I suspect after reading the post that it was my job to relay the commands and instructions to my group, after Forich went LD (and later after he quit) - this was never made clear to me during the event.  Our group was listening to Thor for instructions and following him.  I suspect he never was invited to chat, so hence the screw up.  This was MY responsibility to inform you I felt we were lost, and for that my apologies.<br>
<br>
Because this was my first event, it proved to be extremely confusing and disorganized.  I think as a newbie the following would be helpful:<br>
<br>
1)   Some basic instructions should be given on basic RvR play - I learned more in your post today then all of last night.<br>
2)   For me personally, specific instructions as a group healer for RvR play<br>
3)   An understanding of principal objective or plan for overall group.<br>
<br>
I know it proved very dissappointing for many of my close friends who joined me for our first &quot;event&quot;.  Alldric, Uthar, Shaymus and I worked hard over vacation to finally raise our charactes above 30 - this event was what the effort had been for.<br>

I was late for this raid.  Lorne has apologized for not being able to attend, and when the raid commander doesn't show it puts pressure on those stepping in to fill those shoes.  <br>
<br>
For the First Timers -<br>
<br>
- I suggest you review the War Room, it really does have alot of great information.<br>
- I have consistently asked that ONE post be made with a pin held to it, that is updated, so that both guilds put the primary things you need to know in it.  If no one wishes to step forward to do this, then I will.  I think this will be a helpful reminder to everyone, as well as ONE place to go for the firstimers.  It would outline the very things you mentioned, Role of Group Leader, basic responsibilties of general classes, etc.<br>
- anyone who has the ability, MAYBE we could take one of the maps that are out there and formulate to read the terms we use.  Sorry I cannot help with this, as I don't have the computer knowledge to do this.<br>
- With regards to the primary objective, I had assumed &lt;I am old enough to know I shouldn't do this&gt; that the objective had been laid out before my arrival.<br>
- Communcation was rather poor last nite.  I couldn't even get confirmation you were LD.  The back-up should immediately tell in /chat who went LD, where and who their new back up is.  When LD's return, they resume their position &lt;ie. Group Leader&gt;.<br>
- I want to make it clear, it is not an embarrassment, if someone wishes to withdraw from a responsiblity until they are ready.  I am an extremely fast typer, in case no one noticed.  This is an asset in RvR.<br>
<br>
With regards to the dissappointment.  I knew this and trust me, those around me knew how upset I was to do what I did.  I took it as a personal failure.  This is my suggestion, all NEWCOMERS should attend a 'small' RvR event before attending a raid, to get a feel for things or even a 'free for all' event where you just port in and get a group.  However, with that said, here is my suggestion.......<br>
<br>
This is my offer to the guild.  I will hold weekly 'one group' RvR events, so that we can learn the lay of the land.  It will be a combination of those who have some experience, along with those who are new.  I say half and half.  Four 'newbies' and Four 'oldtimers'.  I will hold these events on different nites, most being held in the evening around 730pm est or later.  I am open to suggestions.  They will last 2 - 3 hours.<br>
<br>
I only hope the fun you and Alldric experienced a few nites ago, can be conveyed to Uthar, Shaymus, Igraina, etc.  As I would so love to share with them, the adrenaline rushes we felt that nite.<br>
<br>

I've added maps (and where I knew them, abbreviations for places contained in the maps) of the frontier areas to the war room.  I'll see about re-hosting them with some edits later. <p><table border=1 bgcolor="#161C81"width=80%>

<br>
All I can say about last night was that it was a mess.<br>
<br>
Dulcette, you did the best you could with what you had and I for one thought you were very patient to last as long as you did.<br>
<br>
To answer your questions Worst, no Thor never got invited into the chat group although it was requested several times. I was trying to relay what we were doing to him verbaly as best I could.<br>
<br>
I think its safe to say that everone involved was rather frustrated last night and to that end I would also like to suggest that we hold off on the large scale raids for at least a couple of weeks. Maybe we should just take single groups out and do some RvR - seems Dulcette had some great success with that.<br>
<br>
Anyway, lets put this one behind us and move on...<br>

<br>
Secondly, beginning either next week, or the week after, I'm going to start leading some RvR events myself. I have held off on doing so because: 1) I wanted to level, and I will take my own sweet time leveling because I don't want to get burned out on the game, and 2) I wanted to participate in some RvR to get my bearings, and get in mind what we need to do as a guild and I need to do as a leader to make RvR fun and successful. After having participated in the big RvR Keep retaking this previous Sunday, and seeing how a keep is taken, I have a much better understanding of what it's going to take to get us into the RvR groove. <br>
<br>
Thirdly, I was a group point man. I shouldn't have been. I was feeling quite under the weather last night, so much so that after the first wipeout, I logged off to go eat. I should have told Belce not to put me as point man. I know that on multiple occasions, I broke discipline, ran off and led a few people, including Forich's group, astray. At times, the orders coming down were unclear, even with Belce in my group. Getting lost in a sea of people from the other raid didn't help. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Finally, during the first wipeout at Dun Crauchon, I targeted a Norse (Healer I think) and hit /sticky. Unfortunately, when he started running back to the fort, I didn't unsticky from him, hoping that I could take him out before he led me too far in. Unfortunately, one of the other Seekers tank followed suit, and we both died right on top of each other, without having taken the healer out. BAD BAD idea, compounded by the fact that I knew better. <br>
<br>
Which brings me to point 4. Realm Point fever. When you go on 1 and 2 group expeditions, such as those Dulcette is running, you are after RP's for yourself and the guild. When you go into the frontier and do the Emain Tango, just hoping to get a group, you are out for realm points. You are NOT here for Realm Points when we do these Large Scale RvR events. If you get them, great. But that is not one of the goals of these raids, and will not be the goals of my raids. <br>
<br>
Just as when we ran Planes Raids and Dragon Raids in EQ, the Large Scale RvR events are to achieve a goal. That goal could be taking a keep, holding the Mile Fort, or just learning to move together as a large group, but there is a goal. Gaining Realm Points is NOT the goal, just like getting Lewtz on Planes Raids was not the goal... it was a fringe benefit. Discipline is key on these things. In these instances, we all need to subsume our individual desires, and our desire to &quot;go our own way&quot; and do what will help the team. Stay with your group, even if you see a sniper real close to you and you can take him. Unless you have specifically been assigned to sniper duty, stay with your group. Snipers can do wonderous things to groups, but only if you let them. A sniper will not wipe out the whole raid, unless you go running off after him. They are there to DISRUPT the raid, break us up, slow us down, and keep us from fighting as a cohesive unit. If you go running into the trees after him, and get out of healing range, he has succeeded. Stick with your group. <br>
<br>
Group leaders convey what's said in chat to the group. Scouts, be specific, use your compass. If you can't read a compass, don't be on the scout team. In the Sunday RvR (which was completely ad hoc), I was in a chat group, trying to get a position on the incoming Middie force (while we were waiting at Excalibur fort for them to come). The scout actually told me he didn't use the compass, and he was dead in the middle of lots of Middies. He couldn't even give me directions on where the Middie force was. Luckily, it wasn't anyone I knew. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It cost me 3 exp deaths, as I had to go try to find the Middies myself, just to be able to give accurate intelligence to other people on the raid. <br>
<br>
Group leaders, set a good example. Listen, be concise, and don't go running off half-cocked. <br>
<br>
We can do MUCH better than we did last night. And we will.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

Realizing late that there was no leader and trying to patch it together is bound to create this kind of confusion and disorganization. This was entirely my fault and again I hope you can all forgive me, but I was unavoidably pulled away, and my attempts to contact Molfious were unsuccessful. I should have thought to call on Belce but it did not occur to me.<br>
<br>
I would hate to see one set back like this derail our attempts at organizing large events. The key is always learn from the past and move on. Lets not put off planning more because of one bad outing.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we should have 2 people in on raid organization from the start so that in the event something like this happens we can recover more gracefully.<br>
<br>
Remember this happened to us once before when the raid organizer could not log on, and we suffered the same sort of trouble getting things going.<br>
<br>
In short lets suck it up, and move on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/uwerzat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>werzat</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>has been run over by Dulcette</span><br> <font color=#0000FF>(1/2/02 2:27:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://werzat.freeservers.com/vincent.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Forgive and move on...</span><hr size=1> I agree Lorne; I see no reason to stop holding large-scale events.

The mistakes that occured (the honest ones) are always there and that raid was just not gelling no matter what anyone did.<br>
<br>
Joint-planning a raid is always a good idea, in fact involving the raid staff (and backups) in it is also a good idea if it's feasable.   <p><table border=1 bgcolor="#161C81"width=80%>

Knowing that we can feel better about the next time we do something together and we will be doing more together.  <br>
<br>
Sorry about not getting Thor in the chat group, I did know it was needed and tried a few times, hence forth all group leaders will be named Tom, Jill, Frank or other easy to spell name &lt;Yeah I said the words,... well sorta&gt; This bit here is an example of a time when it is a good thing to just sit down, not move until this is fixed, call your group leader on the floor and spam me with demands to get it fixed.  This one thing goes a long way in explaining what seriously fubar'd our efforts last night and that is entirely my error.  I was able to invite to the chat group, I knew it was needed, I just couldn't spell that name and did not take the time to get it. <br>
<br>
Some of the things we know that we need to improve is keeping our people together in areas where there are many others such as Mile Forts.  One of the things I do is pick someone in my group and make sure I find them and stay with them.  In this manner I insure that we get our group together in some good time, like the snowball effect. <br>
<br>
Initiative and team responsiblity<br>
<br>
I like initiative, people able to make a decision and move it forward without needing every step confirmed for them, I like seeing groups operate as an individual unit responsible to themselves first and foremost.  Having said this I would like us to hold back here at first while we get up to speed, lets pay attention to what we are all doing, do it all together and later we can extend a looser set of rules for engagement.  The important thing to realize is that the smallest unit is not the individual, but the group.  One person can not accomplish anything, one person trying to solo in a group is even worse. Your group is responsible for you and your solo efforts are going to endanger your groupmates.  Therefore while you are alone and getting ganked it doesn't affect anyone other than yourself.  When you are in a group doing this you have recklessly endangered the people that are committed to aid you.   Things that you might be expected to do is to uncover or bait the Middie healers so we can deal with them, this could hurt, don't think star quarterback or like that.  I want people that want to be on the best team and not best on team.  Don't look at your individual RP's but instead look at the guild RP's for a measure of success if you want. <br>
<br>
Communicating Information<br>
<br>
We all have a real job here to relay information as you get it.  The sooner we can all be on the same page the better, but to be helpful we need proper correct info.  Information needs to include at the very least a direction and a landmark so it can be placed.  Vague information is just as good as no information, pretending to be Paul Reevre yelling the Middies are coming is not helpful. A direction and location is the minimum needed, more is better.  You don't need to get it all out right away, just start with a heading, type and a landmark. &quot;Hibies NW of DC&quot;  Later you can add number and con if possible. <br>

Learning the strengths of each character and what they can do out in RvR land.  I know for a fact, a few were surprised I can run and mez at the exact same time &lt;I am not being faceious (sp)&gt;.  Or the fact that I, if two to three mobs, can hold two of them off while the rest of the party take them down one at a time.  For the matter, someone people just need to get use to the SPEED to which I travel BEEP BEEP.  <br>
<br>
Operating as one solid unit, made us more effective, being more effective allowed us the opportunity to gain more realm points.  Therefore, the realm points become a benefit to the goal to which we are there to achieve.  The reward for disciplined actions.<br>

<br>
1.  Communication<br>
2.  Listen<br>
3.  Communication<br>
4.  The map I printed out of Hibernia Frontier did not have MF1, MF2 on it.<br>
5.  Communication<br>
6.  Organization, tactics, objectives<br>
7.  Communication<br>
8.  Seasoned GLs<br>
9.  Communication<br>
<br>
I see we are at the point on this thread where we are putting this past us and going forward.  However, I was curious as to why I, a level 25 cleric, was in a group with 6 armsmen.  There was no way I could buff them all properly.  Worst, level 31 cleric was in a group with all casters.  Would like to know how groups are made.  I'm thinking maybe because the casters are physically weaker yet are more powerful in damage, they need a stronger cleric to keep them alive?<br>
<br>
I wish I could say I had fun on my first RvR last night.  I was confused by all the running around and lost some times because the group would just take off.  I would /stick to someone but because their computer was faster than mine, I would lose the /stick.  Several times I was by myself on mountain walls wishing I had tracking <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Another question I had was, I noticed someone said the players in Hibernia Frontier were all level 50 or close to it.  How can 3 groups of 20s and 30s possibly succeed against level 50s?<br>
<br>
I would much rather go on smaller RvR raids; at least for now.  They would seem to be more controled and disciplined. All I saw last night was chaos.  But I got 32 RPs!!<br>

I came late, people were LD or left, I quickly shuffled everything as possible and adjusted the best I could.  I had asked group leaders to send me who was in their group and class.  At the time I made up your group, there were two clerics.  The group leader didn't bother to share with me that the other cleric left, other than repeatedly tell me they want PLAYER XXXXX in their group.  I did at first try to balance out casters and armsman and minstrels between groups, putting all stealth people in the Main group.  I neglected, when I found out that the other cleric camped to see what level healers we had in the groups.<br>

<br>
Yes there will be times when events in peoples lives interrupt plans they have made. Real life and/or virtual life for that matter, it just happens.<br>
<br>
I commend those that stepped in and tried to make the best out of an already difficult situtation, and I can understand peoples frustration.<br>
<br>
Remember, arguement and disagreement doesn't have to divide us, but rather it should challenge us and in the end bring us closer together. Through the use of effective discourse we all become better players and friends.<br>
<br>
So remember - try to take peoples criticisms and/or suggestions for what they are meant to be - an attempt to make us all better. <br>
<br>
At the same time, if you have a suggestion/cristism to make, say it in a constructive manner. In the end, we should be benifiting from these experiences even if they don't always go the way we want them to go. <br>

<br>
I asked the group leaders I selected to create good and balanced groups and gave each a chance to make a group one at a time.  I did this to take the job of making groups from myself to those.  The best way I think is to do a /who silver and a /who seekers then have the raid leader, me, make the groups.  Those that show as in Emain are put in groups and it is easy to scroll through the names to do this.  I took a shortcut and did so to make this part go faster, we had already delayed that night and giving people something to do makes it seem to go faster.   No one should have selected all of any type for their group and as they did they erred in selection.<br>

I have posted your request for that password in the officer forum for Haemish to send to you and to take steps that it does not occur again.  Thank you for letting us know.<br>

<br>
that's somethoing Mythic may want to look into.. I can't iunderstand _why_ we should need to /anon to prevent the enemy from knowing we're there.....<br>
