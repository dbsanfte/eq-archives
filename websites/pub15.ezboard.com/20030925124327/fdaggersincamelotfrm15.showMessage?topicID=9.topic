I walked in not knowing what to expect at all, what spells they had, what their role is, nothing. Then I got to lvl 5 and got my elementals. Oh....my....goodness. I was soloing oranges effortlessly, and reds, REDS mind you with a bit more trouble but they were still doable. In case you don't know, theurgists are a wacky kind of pet class, they have fire-and-forget elementals. You target a mob, summon an elemental, and it will atack it for you for about 20 seconds, then it dies. They cast as well, but I'm not sure which spells. The crazy thing is that you can keep casting them, and have a small army of elementals on the mob. I'm sure I've had at least 6 on a mob at once. Eventually the mob wises up and turns after you but you can just run away while the pets whack away at it, and as long as by the time your pets start timing out the thing is injured enough that it is running slowly, you are home free. Just get a bit a ahead and summon up another elemental or 2 to finish it off. Crazy I tell you. <br>
Now I figure that eventually they are going to nerf this, either by limiting the amout of elementals you can summon, or making mob aggro smarter, or something. But I can tell you I'm getting some levels in before they do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Big Boss</span><br>  Posts: 138<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(10/13/01 2:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.godwinclients.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Theurgist - I smell nerf bat</span><hr size=1> It will undergo some changes, as they only have had the class with those capabilites about 2 or 3 weeks.

Hell even &quot;balance&quot; was so over-abusued by Verant I can't use that word for Mythic.  They well may be toned down a bit once RvR gets really going but I can't see Mythic wielding the nerf bat in the EQ sense. <p><hr width=50%>

Things do get harder.  At level 8, I was able to take on yellows and oranges solo.  What I really like was being able to take on multiple mobs at one time!  Two yellows was not happening...but a yellow and a blue I did on multiple occassions.  <br>
<br>
When I hit level 9, and received a new pet...something changed.  I can still take blues pretty easily, but I use more POW then before to take them down.  Yellows have gotten much tougher.  They tend to recognize the threat much sooner than prior levels, which means you better have your running shoes on!  <br>
<br>
I have been truly surprised at how much I have enjoyed playing this class.  When I started playing DAoC, I thought for certain I would be playing a bard in any of the 3 realms.  But, in Albion, I don't like how the bard class is setup, so I started a Theurgist/Cabalist/and a Friar.  I like the Friar ALOT, but when I played the Theurgist (elementalist), I new that I had found my class for Albion.<br>
<br>
Strengths:<br>
*  This class can damage like no ones business!  Their damage isn't as sudden or as flashy as a wizards...but you can take oranges pretty easy pre level 8 and yellows solo after that.<br>
*  You can crowd control. (This is an area I want to really start working on.  With an Air specialization, you get an AE short duration MEZ.  The problem is I am not sure of the area yet! I have tried it on single mobs a couple of times, and yes, this spell really pisses the mobs off just like in EQ! <br>
*  You are the only class that can build siege stuff later in game (I read about this, but haven't read the details yet).  I hope this allows me to bring a different aspect to our guild and realm later down the line.<br>
*   You have root!  If a mob starts to move toward you, root it instead of running if you have mana and let your pets beat on it some more! <br>
<br>
Weaknesses:<br>
*   Like all the caster classes...if a mob gets to you and is blue or higher and has over 1/3 health, you are in some serious trouble.  If a tank can't pull them off, or you manage to get off a lucky spell like root, then you are dead.<br>
*   If your mana falls below 50%, your mana recovery is much slower...and with the damage ability of this class, it is addicting!  You just want to summon those little critters all the time! (I love the sound of them dying...sounds like a chainsaw <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>
<br>
Anyway, to sum up further about what Werzat mentioned, this is a powerful solo class.  I do think things are changing for me though, as I can see the mobs getting harder as I move up.  I have less mana now when fighting yellows, which translates into longer downtime (still much quicker recovery than EQ though).  But regardless, I am enjoying the heck out of this class and definately planning on it being my primary character in Albion.<br>

I will put ALL of my points in that spec..that way, I will have the BEST of what the class has to offer of that category.  I would be leary of spreading my points too thin. If you put points too widely around, your pets will be too weak at times, and your spec abilities will be behind the &quot;power&quot; curve.  What I am learning about DAoC is that it is a game of specialists....in other words, theurogists can damage and damage big time...but you need to make a choice of elements.  The nice thing is that DAoC also supports ALOT of specialists...in other words, a successful group can be made of alot of different classes, just as long as those classes are good at something.  So be wary of spreading your abilities too thin.<br>

But, if my math is correct, by splitting among only 2 paths, I will be able to reach over 2/3 max in both of them. Both paths have some very nice perks, that I'm not willing to totally give up. I may end up goin a bit higher in earth, since that is the only place I've put any points yet, but I think that being over 2/3 in both is an acceptable sacrifice, at least for this character. That's what is so cool about the game, no choice is really all that much better or worse than another, they are just different. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/ugamlaen0.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gamlaen0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(10/16/01 3:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Theurgist - I smell nerf bat</span><hr size=1> agree.

For instance, imagine a fully shield-speced melee guarding a fully-speced wizard.  Good defense, good offense.<br>
<br>
For general grouping and such, where you can't guarentee a balanced group all the time, you can find it a bit hard and that you are inflexible to some situations (inflexible = need for rez/pray).  <br>
<br>
Now that's not to say you shouldn't determine a focus (too much generalization dilutes your abilities).  Take a mercenary, you can train in shields and dual-wield....doing both is, in my opinion, not a good idea.  Decide if you wish to be offensive or defensive and toss away the extra weapon or the shield.<br>
<br>
As much as it pains me to decide to not get spec-spell X so that I can get style Y, I rather like the method.  It also lets you get multiple of class X yet get more than cookie-cutter benefits from them.  Let's say you have 20 silver to hire two mercs.  Merc1: I'll guard you from harm for 10 silver.  Merc2: I'll kill it before it gets to Merc1 for 10 silver.  I see a *lot* of strength is this system. <p><hr width=60% align=left>

The thing I love is that at 50th, my armsman will not have to be a cookie cutter of every other damn armsman on the server to be considered an effective warrior. I could have different items than most, and spec myself one way, while another differently equipped warrior will have some totally different specs, and thus have a different role. We can both be a &quot;main tank&quot; but the way we go about it will be determined by our play styles and our choice of specs, not our gear! This is what always got on my tits about EQ warriors... &quot;To be main tank, go ALL AC and Fast duel wield weapons&quot; Did anyone do any other type of warrior and remain effective in EQ? Whereas here, I can actually be a warrior that wields a huge honking two-handed two-fisted sword, and still be as effective as a duel-wielding merc, just in a different way. <br>
