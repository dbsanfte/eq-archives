There are places to hunt if not to solo well.  Yes Muire Tomb is far more deadly than either of the other realms starter dungeons, but the class imbalance issues he mentions I dont know about.<br>
<br>
Personally I think Bards are fine.  They actually have several advantages as a Music class over the Minstrel, especially in that their spells do not interupt their music.  Their Mez is FAR more capable, and they are not meant to be an attack class they are a HEALER class.  I dont know about the othe class issues mentioned, but I think we have seen the power of the caster classes first-hand.<br>
<br>

  Personally I think the Realm looks pretty good. Yeah, its a little 'golf coursey' and lacks the variation that Albion has, but I think it meshes pretty well with Irish lore.  Only thing missing are Heather and Peat, then it would be more Irish (well, ok, Whiskey too)<br>
<br>
  Hib SI is awesome, fits in well with the overall theme.  The have unique models (theres no botonids or sylvanshades in Alb).  The main contention here is that they removed the formorians from classic Hib when SI came. It fits with the formorian themed SI, but Mythic could replace the old formorian hunting spots with new mobs (say Spraggonillies, for example <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
  Now, for Bards. Bards are awesome, they are total support in one character.  They depend on others to do ALL their work, but they will back those people up 100%.  If a class sucks, no one will play it, I see Bards all the time.  A Bard will never kill you in RvR, but I can assure you that their group will.  (the 'fun' factor of Bards is a seperate issue, this petition is complaining about Bards imbalance, and I just dont see it).<br>
<br>
  That being said, I wish them luck, any new content for a Realm I play on is a good thing.<br>

LOL<br>
<br>
A lot of what's said makes some sense. I actually read most of the huge Hibernia protest thread on VN a while back, and they have a lot of valid points in that too.<br>
<br>
On architecture in particular- someone actually went through and counted distinct building types in all 3 realms. Hibernia had the fewest by a pretty good margin. I prefer the look of hibernia to the mud huts in mid, but it does look the same wherever you go. TNN may be plain jane, but I think it's the best designed of the 3 for navigating in- I find the mid capital to be a royal PITA, personally. And I agree that putting 2 NPCs in the middle of nowhere and calling ti a town is a stretch.<br>
<br>
=Class Stuff=<br>
<br>
Bards. heh, as it happens I'm playing a bard/champ duo, so I've been doing my research. IMO bards shouldn't be compared to minstrels ( who in my mind still have issues) but skalds, who I consider to be a pretty solid class. The problem with being a bard is that they're a 4 line class with 1.5 spec points. What this means is generally, the weapon spec gets ignored, and they become a 3 line 1.5 class. The cookie cutter spec is high music for CC, and high regrow ( minimum 43, for speed5) for speed, power and end. This leaves you with somewhere around 16 nurture ( ghetto rez) and no weapon spec. Bard regrowth is very similar to friar rejuv- and I wouldn't call a friar with 16 rejuv a healer any more than I would a paladin running heal chant. Bards DO get base spells in all 3 spell lines, something the other music clases do not. The other major annoyance with being a bard is I have to swap 3 instruments to be effective- speed is on the lute, end is on the drum, and power is on the flute, of all things. Health song is in regrowth, and was a wasted thing to give bards anyway.<br>
<br>
Wow, that was long winded. I'll try and not do that again.<br>
<br>
The comment on mage lines is dead on. However, the 'good' line for all of those mages is pretty damn good, IMO.<br>
<br>
I also agree that weapon spec lines suck. Blades is inferior to slash, and pierce to thrust, IMO. Of course, if you get that afk bard bot in your group you can style endlessly, but the paladin does end better. Let's not even talk about the shaman. gah.<br>
<br>
=RvR=<br>
<br>
Emain is too inviting, but at this point you wouldn't get people out of emain unless you had a dragon patrolling and randomly AEing people. Whee, wouldn't that be fun! I hope nobody from MythVerantic sees this.<br>
<br>
Rest of their rvr section? waah. All three frontiers are easy to get around in, once you learn some routes. Albion is a deathtrap if you don't know your way around- which hurts dribs and drabs trying to get out to defend more than it does mini-zergs of people coming in.<br>
<br>
=PvE=<br>
<br>
Yeah, Muire's tomb is a deathtrap, unless you go in when the entrance mobs are green-blue ( down there right now, hehe) For those of you who haven't visited- think cats- with all the legos aggroing you when you try to make the first x-roads.<br>
<br>
Lack of hunting 10-15 is hurting me atm- and in hib SI, it seems like everything yellow I find to kill drops -nothing- 90% of the time. So I pop out of SI, wander into a camp of (green) moss sheeries- and make more money in 4 pulls than I had in the last HOUR in SI. I'm not getting a lot of ROG items either- the bard is wearing more quest than drop, and the champ is in store bought armor because after 10 it's very hard to fight naked, even with the bard chain healing. I moved on to Muire's because it was either that or more WC consignments, I'm broke. I actually made as much over time doing consignments at 90 WC than I was on yellow mobs (at 14).<br>
<br>
Contrast this to alb SI where it was the rare mob that didn't drop something most of the time, and tons of rog stuff.<br>
<br>
Assuming I don't forget between now and then, I'll be attending the protest. I feel like Hibernia in many respects shows that it was the 3rd (and rushed) of the relams to be put together. People feel like the red headed stepchild- and Sanya telling them that their only problem is morale only reinforces that feeling.<br>
<br>
As the opening of the protest page states, Mark Jacobs said 14 months ago that they were going to work on Hibernia. I haven't seen it.<br>

<br>
As for RVR I was in a relic raid once a long time ago from Hibernia that was obliterated because of the albion Brown Drakes.  I have yet to see anything THAT devestating to a single 150 person force yet.  The aggressiveness of the albion landscape helps out in defense of the relics more than you know I think. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.zimmers.net/mer/daggerimages/Stage3b.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luric>Luric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 581<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(3/14/03 1:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.zimmers.net/mer/daggerimages/mugshot.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How Strongly Do You Feel?</span><hr size=1> Out of Curiosity Shyosh, what Server are you playing Hib on?

I'm on Percival. Going to ask to get into Palodox if I decide to stay with these guys.<br>
<br>
Why, anyone who causes THAT much whining out of the VN board trolls have GOT to be a hoot to hang out with.<br>
<br>
Thus far, I'm doing it the hard way. No PL, no cash , no help of any kind. I guess 2 accounts doesn't exactly count as the hard way, however.<br>
<br>
On bard end vs paladin end. Luric, for you, end is a bonus- you were highly sought after for groups without it. Contrast that with a bard who would be about as groupable as a scout without it. The only thing the bard brings to the table, otrher than end, is base buffs- which you already got from the warden. No room for mez in a PBAE group, and, as we all already know, you can use someone else's single target CC to good effect when your realm's AE mezzer isn't available.<br>
<br>
Plus there's the side issue of how Hibernia's weapon styles were (supposedly) designed with end regen in mind, and when the other 2 realms got end regen hibernia got nothing. <br>
