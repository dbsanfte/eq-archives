<br>
All I can say about last night was that it was a mess.<br>
<br>
Dulcette, you did the best you could with what you had and I for one thought you were very patient to last as long as you did.<br>
<br>
To answer your questions Worst, no Thor never got invited into the chat group although it was requested several times. I was trying to relay what we were doing to him verbaly as best I could.<br>
<br>
I think its safe to say that everone involved was rather frustrated last night and to that end I would also like to suggest that we hold off on the large scale raids for at least a couple of weeks. Maybe we should just take single groups out and do some RvR - seems Dulcette had some great success with that.<br>
<br>
Anyway, lets put this one behind us and move on...<br>

<br>
Secondly, beginning either next week, or the week after, I'm going to start leading some RvR events myself. I have held off on doing so because: 1) I wanted to level, and I will take my own sweet time leveling because I don't want to get burned out on the game, and 2) I wanted to participate in some RvR to get my bearings, and get in mind what we need to do as a guild and I need to do as a leader to make RvR fun and successful. After having participated in the big RvR Keep retaking this previous Sunday, and seeing how a keep is taken, I have a much better understanding of what it's going to take to get us into the RvR groove. <br>
<br>
Thirdly, I was a group point man. I shouldn't have been. I was feeling quite under the weather last night, so much so that after the first wipeout, I logged off to go eat. I should have told Belce not to put me as point man. I know that on multiple occasions, I broke discipline, ran off and led a few people, including Forich's group, astray. At times, the orders coming down were unclear, even with Belce in my group. Getting lost in a sea of people from the other raid didn't help. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Finally, during the first wipeout at Dun Crauchon, I targeted a Norse (Healer I think) and hit /sticky. Unfortunately, when he started running back to the fort, I didn't unsticky from him, hoping that I could take him out before he led me too far in. Unfortunately, one of the other Seekers tank followed suit, and we both died right on top of each other, without having taken the healer out. BAD BAD idea, compounded by the fact that I knew better. <br>
<br>
Which brings me to point 4. Realm Point fever. When you go on 1 and 2 group expeditions, such as those Dulcette is running, you are after RP's for yourself and the guild. When you go into the frontier and do the Emain Tango, just hoping to get a group, you are out for realm points. You are NOT here for Realm Points when we do these Large Scale RvR events. If you get them, great. But that is not one of the goals of these raids, and will not be the goals of my raids. <br>
<br>
Just as when we ran Planes Raids and Dragon Raids in EQ, the Large Scale RvR events are to achieve a goal. That goal could be taking a keep, holding the Mile Fort, or just learning to move together as a large group, but there is a goal. Gaining Realm Points is NOT the goal, just like getting Lewtz on Planes Raids was not the goal... it was a fringe benefit. Discipline is key on these things. In these instances, we all need to subsume our individual desires, and our desire to &quot;go our own way&quot; and do what will help the team. Stay with your group, even if you see a sniper real close to you and you can take him. Unless you have specifically been assigned to sniper duty, stay with your group. Snipers can do wonderous things to groups, but only if you let them. A sniper will not wipe out the whole raid, unless you go running off after him. They are there to DISRUPT the raid, break us up, slow us down, and keep us from fighting as a cohesive unit. If you go running into the trees after him, and get out of healing range, he has succeeded. Stick with your group. <br>
<br>
Group leaders convey what's said in chat to the group. Scouts, be specific, use your compass. If you can't read a compass, don't be on the scout team. In the Sunday RvR (which was completely ad hoc), I was in a chat group, trying to get a position on the incoming Middie force (while we were waiting at Excalibur fort for them to come). The scout actually told me he didn't use the compass, and he was dead in the middle of lots of Middies. He couldn't even give me directions on where the Middie force was. Luckily, it wasn't anyone I knew. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It cost me 3 exp deaths, as I had to go try to find the Middies myself, just to be able to give accurate intelligence to other people on the raid. <br>
<br>
Group leaders, set a good example. Listen, be concise, and don't go running off half-cocked. <br>
<br>
We can do MUCH better than we did last night. And we will.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>
