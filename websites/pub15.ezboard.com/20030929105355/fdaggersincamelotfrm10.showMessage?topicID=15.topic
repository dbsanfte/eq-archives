<br>
After breaking their fast, merchants and Daggers alike were gathered around the back of the stables where a work area sheltered a forge, lathe, and table with supplies for alchemy and spellcraft had been housed.  Armor and weapons were piled up in stacks and those with the appropriate skill were at work mending and fixing or creating brand new pieces while others filled in with mundane tasks to speed things along.  Merchants lined up carts with supplies and were more than happy to sell their wears and buy others as the Daggers set about long-needed refurbishment -- punctuated with typical Dagger banter.  The sun was promising another blistering day and everyone was glad to be &quot;dressed down&quot; and unarmored.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my, Vincent!&quot;, Dulcette exclaimed as she picked up Brother Vincent's staff from her work-pile, &quot;What have you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>done</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to this staff?!&quot;  She turned it over in her hands as if it were a 3-days-dead eel.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent smiled as he changed to a heavy thread to repair a suit lining, &quot;Oh, just the usual.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well honestly I don't know how you can use it with all these carvings in it,&quot; she replied as she began to repair the staff.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, now, we agreed:  I don't complain about your dye fixation and you don't complain about my carving,&quot; Brother Vincent replied with a chuckle.  He was rewarded with an exasperated sigh from Dulcette as she tried to fix a nasty broken vein of wood.<br>
<br>
Rhianidd and Devildog were working both sides of the forge as they tried to repair weapons and armor.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Good grief, Luric, what'd you do to this breastplate?&quot; Rhianidd exclaimed as she examined Luric's armor prior to starting to mend it.  It was in a terrible state with portions of the ornate metalwork being collapsed against the breastplate proper and the prominent eagle's head was separated and knocked off at an odd angle indeed.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's all that hot monkey-love he's been getting from the trolls,&quot; came Namira's response, never looking up from the weapon she was sharpening.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, my armor fared better than DD's knees have,&quot; Luric retorted jovially.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave my knees outta this, brothel rat,&quot; Devildog returned and launching a leather weapon-grip at Luric in punctuation.<br>
<br>
&quot;When'd he find time to visit a troll brothel?&quot; Brother Vincent asked innocently.<br>
<br>
&quot;If he's visiting troll brothels, I'd better modify his cod-piece,&quot; Rhianidd added.<br>
<br>
&quot;I coulda sworn Luric was into Lurikeens,&quot; Asycho tossed out, lifting his head from his enameling duties.  Luric, working across the table from him repairing some chain armor, playfully flung a ring at him in response.<br>
<br>
&quot;Luric...Lurikeen, yeah, I see it,&quot; Stelar chimed in at Luric's expense as she returned from the merchant wagon, dropped a pile of leather sheets and began to work them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey now! That's a coincidence,&quot; Luric defended.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lurikeen are small, you can get several for the price of one troll,&quot; Hidien said, matter-of-factly from amid the clutter of the spellcraft table.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh?  And how would <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> know, Mr Innocent?&quot; Dulcette thrusted at Hidien, raising an eyebrow.  Hidien only smiled smugly in return as he fiddled with a gem he was imbuing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lurikeen are only good for punting and thwacking,&quot; Brother Jamus said, spreading more dye onto the leather he was working, &quot;Right Vince?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn straight,&quot; Brother Vincent replied, not taking his eyes off the detail work he was employed in.  &quot;Luriball all the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent finished the work on the gloves he was repairing and tossed them into Brother Jamus' dye-and-waterproof touch-up pile.  Stelar delivered some weapon hilts for Devildog.  Namira dumped another two weapons into her &quot;sharpened&quot; pile.  And on they went repairing and refurbishing, each enjoying the ability to tease and harass each other again -- no one escaped scrutiny or received pulled a punch.  One thing was certain:  It was good to be with family again.<br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
It was late afternoon before the Daggers were finishing up with their tasks at the workshop.  They were pleasantly tired and looking forward to trying out their &quot;finally in fit battle condition again&quot; armor and weapons before having a nice lunch.  Brother Vincent was the only one lamenting his newly refurbished equipment -- the repairs has obscured some of his carved Scripture.<br>
<br>
After lugging all the equipment in two borrowed carts over to the open field behind the dining hall, some of them began trying their armor on.  Hidien went to the tents in the barracks courtyard area to retrieve Variana and Norwood who'd been helping the refugees settle in and treat two of the children who were sick with one of the many common ailments that clerics could never quite learn to cure with the wave of a hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vincent, you're a genius!  I never could work that kink out,&quot; Stelar exclaimed after she donned her robes, &quot;I can finally cast a spell without rubbing myself raw!&quot;  She cast a quick series of firey explosions in sheer glee.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Brother Vincent said warningly, &quot;I know what that gleam in her eye means...she wants to go blow something up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Always,&quot; Luric dead panned as Stelar nodded vigorously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wow</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;, Norwood said as he surveyed his chain, &quot;I haven't seen it look that good in...oh, way too long.&quot;  He donned his mail and moved around easily in it.  &quot;It feels lighter too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I replaced the lining,&quot; Rhianidd said as she was helping Devildog on with his plate.  &quot;All that crummy weather in Snowdonia screws up the leather and makes it soak up water.&quot;<br>
<br>
Namira picked up a scrap of wood from the cart the size of her hand and flicked it gently into the air.  With a blinding move she drew both her weapons and brought them up to slice the descending wood-scrap into 3 neatly sliced pieces then pirouetted around, quick as lightening, to bring the blades to bear horizontally, creating 9 gently falling scraps of wood.  Sporting a trade-mark wicked grin, she deftly sheathed her weapons, satisfied that they were indeed sharp enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think Stelar's the only one spoiling for a fight,&quot; Hidien said, glad that Namira was on his side.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent, seeing the display, bent to retrieve three of the skillfully sliced pieces.  He threw three them, one at a time in rapid succession, at Brother Jamus.  Looking up at the last instant and barely having time to bring his staff to bear, he returned all three to Brother Vincent with rapid hits of his staff.<br>
<br>
Others cleared the way as Brother Vincent put his staff to use and knocked the pieces at Brother Jamus and Brother Trappist.  As the Daggers watched, the three of them continued their intense game of reflexes and precision, though it was nearly impossible to see anything but a blur as each piece was hit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Never ceases to amaze me when they do that,&quot; Variana said, having some idea how difficult it would be to hit a nearly flat object directly along it's centerline at such speeds.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a friar thing,&quot; Asycho said with a grin, &quot;They just like to play with their staves.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Boys and their toys,&quot; Dulcette said, shaking her head as Brother Trappist halted each piece as it was sent his way, deftly removing it's momentum so that it landed gently at his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Showoff,&quot; Asycho shot at Brother Vincent.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent returned the grin.  &quot;Showoff?  Na.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->,&quot; he said, pointing to Brother Trappist,&quot;is a showoff.&quot;  Asycho looked at the grinning Brother Trappist and noticed that the wood pieces had fallen at his feet...in a neat stack.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
As they were still trying out their refurbished weapons and armor -- with the minor adjustments that inevitably were needed -- they saw a haggard minstrel run through the Abby gate.  After a quick conversation with the door guard, he turned and ran at full speed toward the group of Daggers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh oh, I wonder what that is,&quot; Brother Jamus said idly, as they all turned to watch the minstrel come at them.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're only worried your brothel tab caught up with you,&quot; Luric teased.<br>
<br>
&quot;Na, they'd need to drag a cart for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>his</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> tab,&quot; Brother Trappist quipped, playfully poking Brother Jamus with his staff.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent walked out to meet the incoming Minstrel.<br>
<br>
&quot;Golvan?&quot; Brother Vincent said tentatively.<br>
<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Golvan looked horrible.  His armor and cloak were heavily travel stained and he looked like he hadn't slept in a month.  He stumbled slightly -- minstrels <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>never</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> stumbled -- as he slowed down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vincent,&quot; he said in a tired, slightly winded and tense voice, &quot;Good, you are here.  I just came from the Canton mines...&quot;  Golvan seemed almost ready to faint; Brother Vincent helped him over to the building to sit down.  Once there, he continued, &quot;I was with a guard contingent escorting an ore caravan and we were overrun.  The traders and guards were slaughtered; they didn't have a chance.  We got caught in a pincer from two groups of Mids, it was a massacre.  I barely got away at sound-speed.&quot;  He looked gravely at Brother Vincent then, saying softly, &quot;They salted the ore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent swore and Hidien looked pale while others looked blankly.<br>
<br>
&quot;'Salted the ore'?&quot; Variana asked on behalf of most gathered there.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a special kind of ore, Var,&quot; Bother Vincent said, distantly.  He was deeply lost in thought at the implications.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me see if I can explain,&quot; Hidien said.  He began to cast a spell and his staff glowed with energy, then he canceled the spell.  &quot;This staff can channel a good deal of energy and can be itself enchanted.  Most things can be enchanted to some degree but often such a low level as to not be noticeable.  But our armor and weapons can hold magical energy for long periods and are imbued with all kinds of good and helpful magic.  This staff, and the metal and wood we use for making armor or a weapon, is able to hold that charge and channel that energy because it is imbedded with the rarified properties of that ore.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And,&quot; Brother Vincent expanded, &quot;that ore is only found one place inside our borders:  the Canton mine.  The other sources are in the Frontier in places we can't mine any longer.  In it's rarified form, it's indestructible and easily added to wood, cloth, metal, etc.  In it's un-rarified state, however, it can be 'salted' much the same way you would salt a well.  Instead of aligning with magical energy, it inhibits it.  Hibbies and Middies found a source of the inerting compound that binds irrevocably with the ore but we've yet to find a source of it to study in it's uncombined state.  We think that's how they're able to conceal their realm breaches.&quot;  He turned to Golvan, &quot;How much ore did they salt?&quot;<br>
<br>
Golvan raised his head from his chest to answer, &quot;Ten carts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hidien's knees went weak and he sat as well.  Brother Vincent stared in disbelief.  &quot;They moved that all at once?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Golvan answered, &quot;That was what the dispatch I carried instructed them to do, move all the mined ore.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn idiots,&quot; Hidien said under his breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, how much is that really and why are you three looking like Gaboran started singing again?&quot; Dulcette asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;10 carts, 4 tons of ore in each cart.  Once rarified that's around 900lbs.  Enough ore to last three years,&quot; Brother Vincent answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;But they haven't been shipping it from Canton since the breaches were found, only from the Frontier locations.  But we can't use those now so the order came to ship from Canton as the ore stocks are near depleted,&quot; Golvan supplied.<br>
<br>
It was Brother Vincent's turn to sit now.  &quot;You mean they waited till their stockpiles were gone before they shipped?  And shipped all at once?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Golvan said, tiredly.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent shook his head at the stupidity and incompetence, whispering, &quot;What manner of idiot...&quot;  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Or apparent idiot...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The gravity of the situation was slowly sinking in to the other Daggers.  There was a feeling of quiet dread.<br>
<br>
After a few moments, Brother Vincent asked Golvan for a dispatch box.  He wrote a few lines of text and handed it back to Golvan as he got to his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dulce, set combat groups for me.  Golvan, first find the nearest outpost and send as many reinforcements to the Canton mines area as they can spare.  Then head straight to Camelot.  If Korinth is there, let him read the dispatch.  Then take that dispatch box straight to the round table and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hand deliver</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it,&quot; Brother Vincent said.  He locked eyes with Golvan, &quot;Let <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>no one</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> handle that dispatch and make sure the Crown reads in your presence.  Do whatever it takes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Golvan looked perplexed at his instructions and asked, &quot;What am I delivering?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is madness and then there is madness with method,&quot; he replied somewhat cryptically but Golvan's widened eyes caught his meaning.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent then addressed everyone else, &quot;Get your gear on and checked and be ready to move out in 10.  Trappist, I need you to stay here.  There are others expected today, I need you to fill them in on what's happening then head out to reinforce us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trappist nodded curtly put down his combat robe, picking up Rhianidd's breastplate instead to help her get suited.  Others hurried to don their armor and equipment while Brother Vincent ran toward the Bishop's office.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
&quot;Rapid engagement groups arranged, we're good-to-go,&quot; Dulcette said as Brother Vincent rounded the corner and accepted a piece of his armor  Trappist handed to him.  He surveyed them quickly.  They looked worse for wear but better than he'd seen many in recent days.  A fire burned in their eyes and their demeanor was that of relaxed familiarity, determination, and focus -- great is the confidence that fighting next to someone you trust brings.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent gave them final instructions as he finished donning his armor.  &quot;Here's the situation:  we're outnumbered and outmatched with the forces we know about and there is likely a force guarding the realm breach.  We will contain and attrit them as best we can until reinforcements arrive.  I've told the Bishop to hold the trade caravan here and to post extra guards.<br>
<br>
&quot;More important than repelling them is to capture some of the inerting compound they seem to have with them.  If just one of us gets away with a sample, we may have a chance to reverse the 'salting' of that ore caravan -- if we can't...&quot;  Brother Vincent let them draw their own conclusions which were equally as dire as anything he could come up with.<br>
<br>
William, watching most of the exchange unseen, ran to have the gates opened as the Daggers approached.  He watched them go with a feeling of excitement and fear, envy and dread.  His life in the Abby had seemed so simple till just a few short days ago. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brothervincent>Brother Vincent</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.silverdaggers.net/img/ge.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 4/21/03 9:11:12 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=armanis>Armanis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pimp Daddy of Minstrels</span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(4/21/03 8:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/adamsjo/avatar.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TWD -
