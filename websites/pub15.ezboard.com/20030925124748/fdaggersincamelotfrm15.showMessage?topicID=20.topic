Dont know how often he intends to play, but for now my intent is to save the char to play with him.  So what class to be?<br>
<br>
UBERFRIAR! - ONLYWAYTOGO!<br>
<br>
I cant help but think that the post here on starting a friar is a bit outdated, (specially after looking at the sig) since it does not seem to be specced the way that I *think* Vincent and Jamus are specced.  I know that Jamus touts to keep points into rejuve and I would have to think that that would be important for a friar.<br>
<br>
My questions really come down to two so I will skip to the chase:<br>
<br>
What are your final specs?<br>
<br>
Starting out new, What would be the most important things to start in on from the beginning?  Enhance/Staves/Rejuve...<br>
<br>
Enlighten me please.<br>
( I think I already have the Drinking part down) <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.zimmers.net/mer/daggerimages/Stage3b.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brothervincent>Brother Vincent</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.silverdaggers.net/img/ge.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dodger of Minstrels</span><br>  Posts: 1766<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(11/11/02 10:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Friars</span><hr size=1> Jamus and I are speced nearly the same way I think but I'll let him confirm that.<br>
<br>
My spec is:<br>
  staff: 39<br>
  enhance: 46<br>
  Rejuv: 25<br>
  Parry 8<br>
<br>
The reasons...<br>
<br>
Staff 39 has a nice followup staff style to Counter Evade which, while it works better in PvE than RvR is still pretty nice and has a bleed effect.  But more importantly you can get +11 from items at level 50 giving you a modified 50 staff.  It may just be me but I notice signifigantly better performance when my staff is at or over 50 than below.<br>
<br>
Enhance 46...I'd like the 47 haste <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>but</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I'd have to drop either staff or rejuv to get it and that is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> gonna happen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      45 is the last +dex-qui and, personally, if that's the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> reason you're going for it, the lesser (38?) is only 4pts below the 45 one and if dex-qui is the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ONLY</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> reason you're going to 45 I'd recommend staying at 38 and putting the rest into parry.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>BUT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I'm at 46 for a reason <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      You can <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>never, never</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have too much heat resist since leather is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>heat vulnerable</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  You can only pack so much on SC gear and I use the 46 buff to make up for the natural vulnerability.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">I am utterly happy with this choice</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> and it's done me well.  There are also heat-based mez spells <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->        Since these stack with gear-based resist buffs, they're worth having, imho.  (I rarely run into cold or matter -- that I can tell -- so I'm not as concerned with those)<br>
<br>
I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>do absolutely and without any question in my mind</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> advocate going to 44 Enhance for the 15% absorb.  Do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> pass that puppy up.<br>
<br>
8 Parry...when I was &quot;growing up&quot; parry and enhance were jokes so I never planned for them.   And now that I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>can</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I find it's still not as important.  If you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>really</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> want parry, I suggest the Mastery of Parry RA.  You'll have the pre-req anyway most likely so for 1 RA pt you compensate for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>6</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> skill pts.  for 4 RA pts you compensate for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>12</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> skill pts. (see where I'm going?)<br>
<br>
While Parry <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>is</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> more viable than it was, I still don't find it, to me, being of the importantce of staff, rejuv, enhance to the levels I have them.<br>
<br>
Rejuv 25...this one is always hotly debated by friars but I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>stronly</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> feel that 25 is the minimum safe spec for a dual-role friar.  There are some who spec high (leather-clerics) and those who spec low or ignore it (leather-armsmen).  Your healing at low levels is just sad.  You may heal for 200 then heal for 50 a few times in a row.  In my humble opinion that is totally unacceptable if I have to keep people alive.  I need to know when to jump put of battle and heal and if I don't know what I'll heal <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>for</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> then I'm going to leave combat sooner or watch someone die -- and you do that enough already.<br>
<br>
At 25, your heals both spec and baseline are constant and respectable (~200 base/2sec ~300/3sec spec) and the spec heal is more power-efficient thus you heal <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>more</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> than with baselines -- baselines are good for casters, quick heals, and epics (lower agro).<br>
<br>
I find that, at 25 rejuv (I was 25 rejuv at 40 or 41), I can heal effectively enough to be the main healer in a group for Dagger DF group (if I go dedicated and med my ass off, lol) and that I can easily play backup-healer.  I can (and have) been the only healer in RvR -- it's tough as <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>hell</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> but I can do a respectable job of it and even a few seconds worth of healing can really make a difference in RvR, and the stable heals 25 rejuv provides lets you prioritize better.<br>
<br>
+piety and +power gear is good for when you are in &quot;cleric mode&quot; (I have a yog's fist mace and will be getting a SCed mace/shield with healing goodies on 'em)<br>
<br>
I still have my &quot;free respec&quot; and I'll prolly never use it.  I am completely happy with my spec.  I can play both roles a friar has (healer and killer) with strength equal to the class abilities (1/3 healer, 2/3 killer).<br>
<br>
RAs should factor into your thoughts though.  I've found that Serenity 2 is my favorite RA, followed by MCL second.  Power lets you heal, healing keeps your group alive (rvr/pve) -- we had many TPWs in DF that a little healing would have saved us from (sometimes we were 1 or 2 heals from a success) so I used a RA respec and got S2...never regretted it and we lived thorugh ungodly shit 'caues of a few extra heals (did a few epic mobs that way too, lol).  MCL is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>must</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  You can get your group buffs back on your party after an RvR rez and you can heal/rez more with it.  I'm torn between which is more important to get first if you were going to emphasize your healing side but if you haven't decided how much you will dedicate yourself to healing then MCL first.  No matter <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>how</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you play, MCL's a must.<br>
<br>
Spec path....When I was growing up, enhance was a joke and broken at 12spec so I went to my mid-30s, soloing <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>well</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with 7 enahnce <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
You need to keep your staff high to the mid 20s and that's much easier now.  You will want to get rejuv to 7 (cures) by 15 and you can leave your enhance a bit low to favor staff.   Plan on 18 rejuv in your early 30s and 25 by 40/41.  Staff at 34 in the early 40s is perfectly ok.  You'll want to be seriously getting your enhance up in the 30s too.  <br>
<br>
The big gun is Friar's Boon at 29 staff.  You need this by 34/35 and it's your bread-and-butter style as it will smack the crap outta things but beware in PvE as it's an aggro style <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      <br>
<br>
It's a different leveling world after the 1.46 patch which gave us the extra spec pts and fixed the enhance line so it's hard to give spec advice different than I gave above. <br>
<br>
Best advice I can give is to always keep your qui and dex maxed.  Dex is your damage stat (not str) and quickness makes you swing faster -- not sure how this ties in as evade is supposed to be dex based, iirc, but I noticed that I evade tons more when my qui is maxed than if it's 20pts below max with no change to my dex.<br>
<br>
Hopefully that's a broad-stroke large enough for you to work with.  If you've any other questions, lemme know.  <br>
<br>
(btw, not all of the robes you get from your trainer will be dyeable, I think the 5 and 10 ones arn't but the 15+ones are, iirc) <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brothervincent>Brother Vincent</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.silverdaggers.net/img/ge.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 11/12/02 11:57:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhianidd>Rhianidd</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://werzat.freeservers.com/ge.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Human Blade Turn</span><br>  Posts: 627<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(11/11/02 11:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmmm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Interesting about the 25 Rejuv. I found that was a good spot with my Cleric as well. I have moved it to 26 now so that I can get the next group heal. That seems to work well in RVR as a mez breaker. Also, I find it difficult to keep switching targets to heal my party. They are ALL taking dmg very fast. The group heal is still small, but its casting time is fast and it saved my party in RVR just the other night <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
