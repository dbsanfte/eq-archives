<br>
Brother Vincent sat down heavily when he, Variana, and Namira returned, painfully aware that he hadn't had any sleep in far too long.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Never thought I'd miss my acolyte days,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought.  The other Daggers were stirring and distributing the remains of the weapons Namira and company had found.  At her direction, most of the weapons had been salvaged for ease of transport but a fair number were retained.                                                            <br>
<br>
Brother Vincent looked at the pile of material he was assigned to carry.  He couldn't fathom why Middy would be making weapons of Albion metal types.  Perhaps they were anticipating taking over Albion's territory and looking for raw materials close at hand...but that seemed far fetched -- at least that's the thought he comforted himself with.  Unaccustomed to metal weapons, he was surprised to feel a flow of energy around the metal.  It wasn't a strong flow but it was definitely different from what he perceived from his staves.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Learn something new every day,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought to himself as he tossed the metal into his pack.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're almost ready to go, Vince,&quot; Stelar said, standing over him.                                      <br>
&quot;Ok,&quot; Brother Vincent replied as he stood.                    <br>
<br>
&quot;Where are we heading?&quot; she asked.                        <br>
<br>
Brother Vincent had been thinking on that during their run back from the village.  They really <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>had</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> been lucky in finding the Middies and didn't have any clues as to where the breach was.  The only candidate that Brother Vincent could think of was the cave Variana's crew had found but they'd checked that out carefully and found nothing to indicate a false wall or camouflaged entry way. The only possible clue was the direction Phleet had run.  Had it been Brother Vincent, he would have run <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>away</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> from any breach in fear of giving it away.  Phleet may have been running to get reinforcements -- or just escape.  Yet his course had been somewhat erratic -- though that could have just been unfamiliarity with the terrain.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What the hell,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>At least it'll </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->look<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> like I have a plan</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. &quot;We'll move north-west along the realm wall,&quot; Brother Vincent said confidently.<br>
<br>
They separated into their movement groups and Brother Vincent gave Dulcette the route they would follow.  She looked skeptical but said nothing.  <br>
<br>
Brother Vincent said little during their travel, his mind lost in thought as they ran.  Others joked about their success, Inconnu diets, who was staring at who's rear end...all the usual stuff to pass the time.  They even shouted back and forth between groups, though it was far from an ideal form of conversation.  Brother Vincent heard it only peripherally.<br>
<br>
They didn't follow the exact route by which they'd chased Phleet.  They moved in that general direction but were careful to pay attention to the lay of the land and keep a sharp eye for archers, stealthers, or anything out of the ordinary.  They also covered a good deal of ground as they zig-zagged north and south of their general direction to investigate as much area as possible.<br>
<br>
Eventually they came within sight of the feeder herd and the place where they finally caught Phleet.  The herd covered a hill and part of the land under it to the east.  There was a larger hill to the north that fed into the realm wall and long stand of trees to the south that curved Northwest.  To the west behind the hill was a jetty of the realm wall.  The area of the hill and the small valley behind it were strewn with boulders.<br>
<br>
The groups split to cover the immediate area quicker, Variana's group going south, Dulcette's group going north.  They'd have to work together to get through the feeders on the hill but they wanted to look around the area before doing that.  <br>
<br>
As Dulcette's group was coming back down from the north hill, they noticed Variana's group getting very close to the feeders.  It was an incautious move and Dulcette's group sped up just in case.  It wouldn't be a happy end if several feeders attacked Variana's group all at once.<br>
<br>
As they were in route something bad happened that had nothing to do with feeders.  Though too far away to tell precisely what was happening, it was evident that Variana's group was in heavy combat, though none of the feeder herd had rushed them.  They saw some of their comrades drop as they sprinted for all they were worth to get in range to help.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent stopped at his maximum healing range and began to aid where he could.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Shadowblades,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he cursed to himself. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That's the last damn thing we need right now</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  He exhausted his healing energy down to the last, even using his crystal, before he used the last dregs of his power to cast Saint's Vigor and sprint into the battle.  <br>
<br>
It was an unhappy sight.  As Brother Vincent ran into the frey, he counted three bodies of shadowblades and five of his comrades.  Hidien, Asycho, Stelar, Brother Jamus, and Luric lay on the ground.  Namira was laying into the middies trying to kill Norwood and Brother Vincent charged straight toward them.  Just as he came near he loosed his hold on his endurance regeneration spell, taking a chance.<br>
<br>
He leaped into battle with a shadowblade's backside with a furious swing, followed quickly by another and the little kobold fell to the ground.  He could see Norwood was in a bad way, brutally wounded and shaking from a poison.  He calmed himself and summoned binding energy to pull the poison out of Norwood.  He wanted to unleash healing energy as well but lacked the power for it.   He had only enough to bind the poison in Namira's body before he had to devote himself back to the melee.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent heard both Dulcette and Rhianidd fall in rapid succession but could spare them little attention as the shadowblades, which seemed to be raining from the sky, dove strait for the friar.  Brother Vincent gave himself over to fully defensive mode, moving randomly to throw off his attackers, feinting this way and that, but still managed to get in a devastating thwap now and again with his staff.<br>
<br>
Namira had dispatched the two that were on her and, though it was evident she was exhausted, ran to assist Brother Vincent.  Devildog was still dealing with two of them on his own, Brother Vincent saw from the corner of his eye, but Norwood was mercifully being left alone and was able to deliver welcomed healing energy to Variana and Devildog.<br>
<br>
With a vicious pirouette, Namira slammed both of her swords to the hilt in one kobold's chest, finishing him off.  Brother Vincent managed a killing blow on another of his attackers, but he was losing his war.  He was badly poisoned and still had two attackers.  Suddenly one of them stood still and he realized he'd heard Variana's distinctive shout and that the little devil was stunned.  He launched into him, determined to go down fighting. <br>
<br>
To his left, he heard a sickening <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>thud</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and saw something rush into his other attacker like a boulder like running down a mountain.  Devildog had knocked his last attacker into one of Brother Vincent's, and ran in himself to finish the job.  The kobold shook off the stun just in time to throw another poison into Brother Vincent before he crumpled to the ground bidden by Brother Vincent's staff.<br>
<br>
Exhausted and poisoned with no power to cure himself, Brother Vincent sat heavily on the ground.  The battle wasn't finished, Namira and the others were dispatching one that tried to take out Namira from behind, but Brother Vincent could do no more.  He felt his life ebbing away and knew he'd not generate power in time to heal himself.  He said nothing to Norwood, Brother Vincent knew Norwood would cure him if it was at all possible.<br>
<br>
Faint and ready for collapse, Brother Vincent felt the poison leave his body, almost at the very last second.  He let out a sigh of relief and tried to focus his mind on regenerating his power to resurrect his comrades.  They had to move away as quickly as they could from this area, then they could determine what happened.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent allowed himself to count the bodies of the middies.  15 bodies of middies lay around them.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>More must have joined in than I saw,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought to himself.  It was a brutal battle and fortunate they had trickled in and hadn't struck at once.  Brother Vincent shook off the thought and tried to remain calm.  They needed to rez and move quickly but that'd take time.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent closed his eyes and tried to relax and untangle the eddy-currents that always formed when casting spells. The soft minstrel music helping to dissipate those currents, he once again reviewed the scene.  It was obvious that something was being guarded heavily and the only thing that would warrant this type of guard would be the realm breach.  The danger they were in was considerable.<br>
<br>
With no small effort, the Daggers were again on their feet.  Brother Vincent and Devildog both letting out a mental sigh of relief as each Dagger was resurrected, their fears staved off for a while.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, head for those trees.  They'll give us come cover while we recuperate,&quot; Brother Vincent said, helping Stelar to her feet.  She'd been badly shaken and still wasn't yet her full self.<br>
<br>
They ran at their best speed toward the trees.  Turning, Brother Vincent looked at the bodies of the stealthers they'd killed.  All were still there.  He'd surreptitiously checked a few of them to see if a force of life was still present and had found it in each.  That meant they expected to be resurrected...a bad sign.<br>
<br>
&quot;Var,&quot; Brother Vincent said, taking her aside, &quot;I want you to head back.  Find those reinforcements that should be heading our way and make sure they find us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Variana was about to protest -- she hated the thought of leaving her friends behind in what would surely be a deadly fight -- but clamped her mouth tightly to quash it.  This was no time for heroics; this was the time for desperate action.  She nodded curtly, banged her drum, and sped away as fast as she could.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I hope I make it in time</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, she thought to herself, knowing that she was likely their only link to survival.<br>
<br>
Responding to several glances Brother Vincent replied, &quot;Var's our life-line...assuming those reinforcements are actually on the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shouldn't we all go?&quot; Dulcette asked, &quot;We're going to get over-run here by ourselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Our orders were to guard and contain until reinforcements arrived,&quot; Brother Vincent evenly.<br>
<br>
&quot;But,&quot; Dulcette interjected in exasperation, only to be over-ridden by Brother Vincent.<br>
<br>
&quot;No 'buts',&quot; Brother Vincent said concisely, &quot;Those are our orders.  And for once it's also the right thing to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Turning to Stelar, he pointed at the boulders and said, &quot;There's got to be an opening among those boulders.  Can you target just beyond them and lay down a few bursts?&quot;  Stelar nodded and moved to do as she was asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's going to stir them up if they're over there, Vince,&quot; Norwood said, obviously concerned.<br>
<br>
&quot;We gotta do it sometime, might as well be now,&quot; Brother Jamus said in support of Brother Vincent's intentions.<br>
<br>
Everyone moved to the edge of the wood and tried to remain concealed as best they could.  Asycho and Hidien nodded to Stelar that they were ready to deal with anything that happened to run their direction.<br>
<br>
Stelar stretched out with her mind, marking a place in space for her magic to expand.  She cast, and cast again, and again...nothing.  She stretched her ability to it's very limit and opened the earth once again.  Her eyes sprung open and she began to cast again furiously.  &quot;Three,&quot; she said between clenched teeth as she moved her point of focus where the thought the three she's hit would be running.<br>
<br>
In unison and without signal, Brother Vincent and Brother Jamus uttered words to unleash their endurance regeneration magic as they sprinted for the large boulder beyond the wood.  They reached its east side just as three figures ran past it's west side.  Two huge trolls barreled toward the wood and another, a dwarf, slowed to a stop and started to cast a spell.  <br>
<br>
Brother Jamus did not find that acceptable and shouted with a mighty voice, set at such a force and timbre to cause anger to boil in the dwarf even though he couldn't understand the words spoken.  Spell-casting is a controlled affair, not compatible with strong emotion, thus the dwarf's concentration was broken.  He turned to cast another spell on Brother Jamus but found himself interrupted again, this time by the butt of a friar's staff.  <br>
<br>
Brother Vincent hung back as Brother Jamus pummeled the dwarf, paranoia getting the best of him.  He moved quietly along the south side of the large boulder towering several feet above his head.  Just then he saw it, the wrinkle in the air that could only be a stealther.  Allowing Brother Jamus to keep the stealther's attention, Brother Vincent slowly crept up behind and just as the stealther was totally focused on his victim, Brother Vincent made his attack.<br>
<br>
The stealther almost fell forward and in doing so completely missed his target.  Brother Jamus, flashing a grin at Brother Vincent, spun his staff in perfect timing with Brother Vincent's next blow.  Brother Jamus from the front and Brother Vincent from the back was a force no rib-cage could overcome.  The kobold died instantly as his rib cage collapsed.<br>
<br>
Both friars ran back toward their comrades, skipping easily over the corpse of the dwarf on the way.  As they arrived they saw two troll corpses lying on the ground and Namira with a vicious grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Round one to the Daggers,&quot; Brother Vincent said, taking a closer look at the trolls.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Jaded Souls</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Brother Vincent thought, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Crap.  This is gonna hurt.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Come on,&quot; Devildog urged, &quot;We need to locate the breach precisely and bottle them up in it.&quot;<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
They edged around the large boulder that Brothers Jamus and Vincent had hidden behind.  They couldn't see any activity beyond the odd stray feeder nor could Stelar seem to hit anything with her magic.  Cautiously they crept forward.<br>
<br>
Around some other boulders they found an opening, just big enough for a troll to squeeze through.  A few feet in front of it was a boulder almost as tall as a man.  Brother Jamus and Brother Vincent peeked inside, then entered.  It was angled up, thankfully, and didn't seem as if it would cross a boundary layer.<br>
<br>
They stepped in and just as their eyes adjusted to the gloom...<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
The Daggers jumped as the explosion reached their ears.  Brother Jamus and Brother Vincent were flung out of the opening and slammed into the boulder in front of it.  The Daggers heard their bones snap upon impact.  Blood ran onto the ground as their bodies crumpled to the ground.<br>
<br>
The Daggers stood stunned for a beat, then moved into action.  Namira unsheathed her weapons coldly and walked after Devildog and Luric who darted into the opening, followed quickly by Hidien, Stelar, and Dulcette.  Asycho stood guard, ready to unleash mesmerizing magic on anything that came behind them while Norwood and Rhianidd both attempted to resurrect one of the friars...but neither were.<br>
<br>
Loud sounds of battle were heard coming from inside the cave and Rhianidd jerked her head to Norwood to get inside.  She tried once more to resurrect Brother Jamus, this time it worked but Brother Jamus was groggy and sat immediately.  He made no answer to Asycho's questions, he only sat beside the opening with his head hung.<br>
<br>
Standing, Rhianidd made a second attempt at Brother Vincent.  This time, he too was able to use the resurrection conduit but he, like Brother Jamus, was mostly incoherent.  She could only spare a moment to consider what they'd just been through, how violent their deaths were, before she too ran inside to lend her blade and shield to the battle.<br>
<br>
Asycho tried to offer the friars some water but they were still barely in touch with this world.  He tried not to glance at the place they'd just been or the blood pools and spatter that remained.  He heard the sounds of battle and knew he was needed.  In desperation, he pulled out some of the Mung worms and doused them with water to revive them.<br>
<br>
Each in turn, he split a Mung worm, lifted their heads and placed the writhing worm on their tongues.  Brother Vincent was the first to respond to the sensation drawing him back.  His eyes fluttered and he seemed aware of his environment, even accepting the water form Asycho.<br>
<br>
&quot;You ok, Vince?&quot; he asked tentatively.<br>
<br>
When Brother Vincent responded his voice was rough and strained.  &quot;I think so.  What the hell happened?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;We don't know.  You two were in there for a few seconds then there was a loud explosion and you two came flying out and hit that boulder,&quot; Asycho said.<br>
<br>
&quot;All I remember was seeing a Middy runemaster in front of us, hearing some magic off to our right and then we were flying followed by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> most amazing pain I think I've ever felt,&quot; Brother Vincent said, still slurring his words a bit.<br>
<br>
Asycho heard a muffled expletive and what sounded like &quot;get Hidien up!&quot;  He glanced at Brother Jamus who showed some signs of life.  He cupped Brother Vincent's head in his hands so he could stare directly into Brother Vincent's eyes, saying urgently, &quot;Can you take care of Jamus?&quot;  <br>
<br>
Brother Vincent nodded and Asycho bolted into the tunnel.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent tried to stand and found he was able to, though he was unsure of his footing.  He picked up his staff swung it lightly at Brother Jamus' legs, hitting the knee he'd inured in their previous duel.  Though the impact was light, Brother Jamus' body convulsed violently.  The sense-memory had done it's work, however, and a second later he was shaking his head and swallowing the Mung worm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on, Brother Jamus,&quot; Brother Vincent said gravely, &quot;They need us in there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell hit us, Brother Vincent?&quot; he asked as he groped for his staff with one hand while the other held his head.  &quot;I feel like I went on a week-long bender as a troll brothel's sole patron.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no idea,&quot; Brother Vincent said, handing Brother Jamus a water skin.  &quot;I haven't felt this bad since I tried Worst's 'Home-made brew' without cutting it with 90/10 with water.&quot;<br>
<br>
The friars then tried to summon their magic to augment them before they joined the battle.  The urgency was not lost on them, however they found moving and focusing extremely difficult.  After a few failures of concentration, they both managed to have all of their augmenting magic surrounding them and they went into the tunnel.<br>
<br>
Their comrades were not visible in the corridor they saw before them but they saw openings to the right, left, up, and down as they moved forward.  It was unlike anything they'd previously ever witnessed in any of their extensive travels.  They listened carefully, trying to hear sounds of battle but found none.<br>
<br>
Quietly as kittens on a fur rug, they made their way forward down the tunnel in front of them.  It curved up slightly then down slightly.  Lichen glowed in patches along some walls but provided almost no illumination.  The air smelled of burned almonds and mold and cut the lungs as one drew breath.<br>
<br>
As they advanced, they heard whispers that may have been voices.  Following one of the downward bending tunnels in the floor ahead of them, they descended at a shallow angle at first, then a sharp turn to the right.  They stealthily crept around the corner and found a kobold and a troll with their backs to the friars.  The two were peering below them where sounds of battle could be heard.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent looked at Brother Jamus and motioned for him to wait.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I bet they're waiting in ambush</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Brother Vincent thought as he hefted his staff.  But, not knowing what was happening below, it was most wise to wait and see the battle before making any attempt to alter the Middies' plans.<br>
<br>
The sound of war was coming closer and Brother Vincent heard the voices of his comrades.  He saw a few Middies run through below and saw the troll and kobold ready for action.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent put a restraining arm on Brother Jamus and felt him shift position slightly so that they he could move the instant Brother Vincent's hand left.  <br>
<br>
------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Almost...<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Almost!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, she thought. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Just a little further and those damn Albs are going down hard.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  She looked at her shaman companion.  He was readying too and she could see the anticipation on his face.<br>
<br>
Closer and closer the Albs came then they were in sight!<br>
<br>
She and her companion began to cast their spells in unison, readying to unleash torment and pain on those damn meddling Albs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ah...what the..</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> were her last thoughts.<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent saw the lights of readying magic and pulled his hand from Brother Jamus.  The Brothers Jamus and Vincent moved in unison themselves, executing precision blows.  The heads of both the kobold and troll snapped back as each friar's staff landed just at the base of the skull.<br>
<br>
Using their momentum, Brother Jamus and Brother Vincent pushed them both forward and the fell from the ledge.  The friars were right behind the Middies over the edge.  Each planted their staff as they came down on the backs of the Middies, using that to begin to break their fall, then letting their full remaining weight and momentum land on the bodies of their victims.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent and Brother Jamus were unhurt but the Middies were no longer an issue of concern.<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
A rare torch was hung along the far wall, providing some light to see by.  It hung at an odd angle as it was jammed into a rock crevice.  With the light, the Daggers could see the middies they were pursuing.  Stelar laughed with vengeance as she targeted their path and called the earth to do her bidding.  Two of them fell to the ground and the Daggers let out a war cry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go, go!&quot; Dulcette shouted as they ran after the middies, trying to get them before they passed out of sight.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell?!&quot; Luric exclaimed as he skittered to a halt along with the rest of the surprised Daggers.  In front of them the body of a kobold and troll fell from what appeared to be solid rock.  Following them down were two figures in dark clothes.  The first two figures hit the ground with a wet thump -- the two other figures landed on the first with a sound that weakens the stomach but defies description.<br>
<br>
The two friars stood and waved at their friends.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank god,&quot; Hidien said under his breath as they all rushed to greet them quickly and continue after their prey -- no time could be lost for even the most basic buffs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice entrance, guys,&quot; Stelar giggled -- Stelar was always giddy when she got to blow things up, Brother Vincent noted.<br>
<br>
Brother Jamus glanced around him quickly.  &quot;Where's Asycho?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Back there someplace,&quot; Rhianidd said as they rounded a corner and caught sight of the Middies again in the gloom.  The middies fired a few spells and arrows at the pursuing Daggers but these either bounced off the shields of the paladins or were shrugged off by warding magic.  &quot;We couldn't get to him after his damn fool heroics saved our hides.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He ran down another corridor,&quot; Hidien extended, &quot;and came up behind the Middies and mezed 'em all.  Then a few more came in and crushed him.  We got the hell out of there while we could.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, that little blue guy made my Christmas list for that maneuver,&quot; Luric said, as their good fortune ended harshly.<br>
<br>
As they turned another corner onto a ledge, one of the Middies turned and fired a bolt at them.  None of the Daggers could remember if it hit anyone.  The next thing they knew, they were shaking off unconsciousness and trying to figure out what happened.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent's head was pounding savagely.  He looked around but could see no light.  Reaching into his pack, he withdrew and ignited his torch.  He was near a wall covered with slime.  The smell of the place was causing him extreme nausea.<br>
<br>
He was badly injured and set about flowing healing and restoring magic through himself.  Looking around he could see a few others had survived but Stelar, Dulcette, Hidien, Norwood, and Brother Jamus would need resurrections.  <br>
<br>
He funneled magic to Norwood to resurrect him -- but Norwood wasn't too pleased with the world he returned to.  &quot;I liked it better when I was dead,&quot; he said, trying to hold back from vomiting.  <br>
<br>
Brother Vincent used his crystal to regain some power and resurrected Brother Jamus.<br>
<br>
Namira was stirring to her feet.  &quot;And I thought the inside of Phleet stunk,&quot; she said, covering her mouth and nose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, this is just un-sat,&quot; Brother Jamus said, before also covering his mouth and nose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are we?&quot; Stelar asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like we fell from up there,&quot; Hidien said, pointing upward to a faint flicker of light.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's just get out of here, please,&quot; Dulcette said.  &quot;This place smells like Hidien's cooking.&quot;<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Resurrected and buffed, the Daggers found several exits and took the nearest and looked for a tunnel upward toward some respectable air.<br>
<br>
They continued on for some time without meeting up with Middies, though they knew they'd far from wiped them out.<br>
<br>
Luric's finely tuned sense of direction had gotten them to a familiar area, a large cavern with natural stone arches serving as bridges among some outcroppings of rocks.  They entered the cavern with some trepidation but were determined to cross it quickly and exit the maze of tunnels, hoping to guard the entrance.  <br>
<br>
They passed the cavern peacefully and after a few wrong-turns were nearing the entrance.  Not a single Middy or sign of one had been spotted for hours.<br>
<br>
Luck, however, had run out for the Daggers.<br>
<br>
As they walked into an intersection of many tunnels, they were set upon from several directions with both magic and melee.  The magic was so intense it was impossible to see.  They had to move quickly if they were to have any hope.<br>
<br>
In the confusion, the Daggers were split as they headed down separate tunnels to seek refuge from harsh magic.  Devildog, Rhianidd, Brother Vincent, and Norwood put up a valent show as they retreated down a tunnel and across a natural sloping bridge.  <br>
<br>
As they fought, Brother Vincent felt a strange <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>pang</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, almost like a bright light had shown itself for an instant then disappeared and it startled him for a moment.  Devildog seemed to pause for a moment as well and quickly recovered but Norwood and Rhianidd didn't seem affected.  Worried, Brother Vincent tried to look every direction at once as they tried to both back up along the natural bridge and fend off the warriors pressing the attack at Rhianidd and Devildog.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent, however, missed a stealther in the gloom and found himself doubling over in pain before he knew precisely what had happened.  He swung his staff at the kobold just as a wave of pain from the poison hit and he lost his balance.  He and the kobold fell to the ground below.  Brother Vincent lived long enough to gain satisfaction that the kobold didn't survive but not long enough to stand and cure the ravenous poison.<br>
<br>
Upon death, the consciousness hovers about for a time, though not always with a great affinity for the real world.  Brother Vincent was dimly aware that the Daggers put up a fierce battle but were ultimately cut down by superior forces.<br>
<br>
For a while he floated, unconcerned by the events around him.  Then, suddenly, the bright blue glow of a resurrection corridor appeared in his awareness.  He was tempted to ignore it but after a few moments of reticence he moved his awareness into the corridor and came back into his body.<br>
<br>
He blinked for a moment trying to adjust to what he was seeing.  &quot;Brother Dent?&quot; he said, looking at the friar who's resurrected him, &quot;What the hell are you doing here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Saving your sorry hide, Brother Vince,&quot; DentAurtherDent said as he pat Brother Vincent on the shoulder.  &quot;You guys put up one <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>hell</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of a fight from the look of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on,&quot; Brother Vincent said, moving toward the slope Dent must have used to get down to him, &quot;I want to make sure we get everyone rezed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We've got people going down a few tunnels around here,&quot; Brother Dent said as they climbed, &quot;This place is a damn maze.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, it goes deep too,&quot; Brother Vincent said as he and Brother Dent jogged across the natural bridge back toward the intersection they were ambushed in.  &quot;We never found the exit to the frontier.  Big as this place is, it'll be in Sauvage, the way my luck's been running lately.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll find it,&quot; Brother Dent said reassuringly, &quot;Captain Brodi brought damn near half of Albion with him.&quot;<br>
<br>
As they reached the intersection, Brother Dent pointed down a tunnel.  &quot;That's the way out, it's pretty well marked now.  We sent everyone rezed, yours and ours, outside to recuperate.  I'm sure Brodi will want to talk to you too.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent put a hand to the wall and felt it's natural surface.  He reached deep, opening his senses to the flow of magic around him as his proctors had taught him.  It felt...it felt like rock.  &quot;You'll want to keep a sharp eye out for anything unusual.  We wound up quite deep in this maze and never crossed a boundary layer,&quot; Brother Vincent said quietly.  &quot;I've never seen anything like it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Dent nodded then said in a low voice as he moved closer to Brother Vincent so as not to be overheard.  &quot;I was near the Abby when I got word of the breach and my group formed up there.  Brother Trappist had a word with me.  We've been searching the Middy bodies under the guise of gathering intelligence.  We haven't found any of the inerting compound but every friar is on the lookout for it. I'll get word and a sample to you quietly if we find anything suspicious.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent took a deep breath, the air cutting his lungs, and turned to Brother Dent, clasping his shoulders.  A look passed between them that need no words.  <br>
<br>
Brother Vincent turned and walked down the corridor without another word.<br>

<br>
The combat was laid out nicely, and shows a good deal of the confusion that can happen when RVRing in a place like a dungeon.  It added to the story.<br>
<br>

Vincent, it's an awesome story and we are honoured as friends and families to be included in.  Quit critiquing your own work and allow us to enjoy it to it's fullest.

<br>
And reading what Luric posted (see below), I know <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>one</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> element of it -- it was some Dagger shanties that should have echoed around for Vince and Jamus to hear...grrrr.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do find it amusing that you keep using the full &quot;Brother Vincent&quot; and &quot;Brother Jamus&quot; even when in the middle of battle and recovery instead of the familiar &quot;Vince&quot; and &quot;Jamus&quot; that we are used to in game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, it's hard a hell to write it that way (b/c it sounds weird) but it was a &quot;design choice&quot; for lack of a better term.  Friars are, in general, a fairly tight-knit group (over on drunkenfriar.com anyway) and I wanted to expand on that in the story as it's one of the underlying fabrics in the tale.  But as I went over the threads and implications, it was very hard to convey that.  <br>
<br>
What I wanted to get across was that there was a basic underlying exchange between (most) friars that was different than the interactions with friars by others or with others by friars.  As far as this story goes, friars are part of the church but in that &quot;strange relative that lives in the attic and is rumored to eat cats&quot; way -- the church just doesn't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>like</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> being associated with them but they're too integral to the church's needs to be discarded.  As all friars are acolytes of the church in their youth, they're fed this attitude and rebel against it to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>become</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a friar, acception violence as a natural part of life (smite clerics are viewed cooly by the church but are still considered &quot;one of their own&quot; while they'd like to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>dis</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->own friars).  Coupled with various attitudes of the general populace (from the 'friars are useless' to 'friars are gods' depending on their bias) they learn to rely on each other.  It's that unity and mindset that caused the crown to vest so much trust and responsibility in them when things began to slide out of control for Albion.<br>
<br>
There's an intonation in the voice used with people you respect and trust and intonation is hard to get across it's presence or it's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>abscence</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in written form.  Formality is often used as a sign of respect so I used that as the tool.<br>
<br>
If this were ever turned into, say, a web-radio program (for those of you who remember radio drama) what would be written &quot;Welcome Brother WhateverTheNameIs&quot; would be said &quot;Welcome What&quot; but the respect of the more formal version would be evident in the voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;The only thing I think was missing was Luric being on the wrong toolbar and spamming the area with Dagger Chanties when he should be using shield slams.&quot;<br>
<br>

So just be proud of it.  One of the toughest things I am having trouble teaching my daughter is that when someone compliments you on your work, or anything for that matter, is that you should allways take it as genuine.  They would not be saying it if that was not the case.<br>
