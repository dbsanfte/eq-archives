<br>
First Dulcette, I apologize for not communicating more clearly with you that because this was my FIRST raid, I had no clue as to the following:<br>
<br>
1) Role of group leader<br>
2) Basic responsibility of our group (mostly casters) - i.e. hang back - enter melee (would have thought the former)<br>
3) Group number - never knew if we were 1, 2, or 3<br>
4) After Forich went LD, Thor became our group leader (most exp level 41 Pally)<br>
5) Sorry wasn't even sure what MF1, MF2 were. <br>
6) Did we have a primary objective for the group as a whole?  From where I was (on auto follow of our group leader) - very confusing.<br>
<br>
I never felt our group was in sink, never got a confimation that Thor had been invited into chat.  I suspect after reading the post that it was my job to relay the commands and instructions to my group, after Forich went LD (and later after he quit) - this was never made clear to me during the event.  Our group was listening to Thor for instructions and following him.  I suspect he never was invited to chat, so hence the screw up.  This was MY responsibility to inform you I felt we were lost, and for that my apologies.<br>
<br>
Because this was my first event, it proved to be extremely confusing and disorganized.  I think as a newbie the following would be helpful:<br>
<br>
1)   Some basic instructions should be given on basic RvR play - I learned more in your post today then all of last night.<br>
2)   For me personally, specific instructions as a group healer for RvR play<br>
3)   An understanding of principal objective or plan for overall group.<br>
<br>
I know it proved very dissappointing for many of my close friends who joined me for our first &quot;event&quot;.  Alldric, Uthar, Shaymus and I worked hard over vacation to finally raise our charactes above 30 - this event was what the effort had been for.<br>

I was late for this raid.  Lorne has apologized for not being able to attend, and when the raid commander doesn't show it puts pressure on those stepping in to fill those shoes.  <br>
<br>
For the First Timers -<br>
<br>
- I suggest you review the War Room, it really does have alot of great information.<br>
- I have consistently asked that ONE post be made with a pin held to it, that is updated, so that both guilds put the primary things you need to know in it.  If no one wishes to step forward to do this, then I will.  I think this will be a helpful reminder to everyone, as well as ONE place to go for the firstimers.  It would outline the very things you mentioned, Role of Group Leader, basic responsibilties of general classes, etc.<br>
- anyone who has the ability, MAYBE we could take one of the maps that are out there and formulate to read the terms we use.  Sorry I cannot help with this, as I don't have the computer knowledge to do this.<br>
- With regards to the primary objective, I had assumed &lt;I am old enough to know I shouldn't do this&gt; that the objective had been laid out before my arrival.<br>
- Communcation was rather poor last nite.  I couldn't even get confirmation you were LD.  The back-up should immediately tell in /chat who went LD, where and who their new back up is.  When LD's return, they resume their position &lt;ie. Group Leader&gt;.<br>
- I want to make it clear, it is not an embarrassment, if someone wishes to withdraw from a responsiblity until they are ready.  I am an extremely fast typer, in case no one noticed.  This is an asset in RvR.<br>
<br>
With regards to the dissappointment.  I knew this and trust me, those around me knew how upset I was to do what I did.  I took it as a personal failure.  This is my suggestion, all NEWCOMERS should attend a 'small' RvR event before attending a raid, to get a feel for things or even a 'free for all' event where you just port in and get a group.  However, with that said, here is my suggestion.......<br>
<br>
This is my offer to the guild.  I will hold weekly 'one group' RvR events, so that we can learn the lay of the land.  It will be a combination of those who have some experience, along with those who are new.  I say half and half.  Four 'newbies' and Four 'oldtimers'.  I will hold these events on different nites, most being held in the evening around 730pm est or later.  I am open to suggestions.  They will last 2 - 3 hours.<br>
<br>
I only hope the fun you and Alldric experienced a few nites ago, can be conveyed to Uthar, Shaymus, Igraina, etc.  As I would so love to share with them, the adrenaline rushes we felt that nite.<br>

<br>

I'd have bet my nic card we had a thread with that in it but I can't find it for the life of me -- glad I didn't bet my nic card now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you would lend us your insights Dulce, I'll glue 'em to the top and see what other gems I can add to it after I peruse the other threads in the events/warroom/general forums -- I know we've disucssed this stuff <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> some</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->place.<br>
<br>
I've added maps (and where I knew them, abbreviations for places contained in the maps) of the frontier areas to the war room.  I'll see about re-hosting them with some edits later. <p><table border=1 bgcolor="#161C81"width=80%>

<br>
All I can say about last night was that it was a mess.<br>
<br>
Dulcette, you did the best you could with what you had and I for one thought you were very patient to last as long as you did.<br>
<br>
To answer your questions Worst, no Thor never got invited into the chat group although it was requested several times. I was trying to relay what we were doing to him verbaly as best I could.<br>
<br>
I think its safe to say that everone involved was rather frustrated last night and to that end I would also like to suggest that we hold off on the large scale raids for at least a couple of weeks. Maybe we should just take single groups out and do some RvR - seems Dulcette had some great success with that.<br>
<br>
Anyway, lets put this one behind us and move on...<br>

<br>
Secondly, beginning either next week, or the week after, I'm going to start leading some RvR events myself. I have held off on doing so because: 1) I wanted to level, and I will take my own sweet time leveling because I don't want to get burned out on the game, and 2) I wanted to participate in some RvR to get my bearings, and get in mind what we need to do as a guild and I need to do as a leader to make RvR fun and successful. After having participated in the big RvR Keep retaking this previous Sunday, and seeing how a keep is taken, I have a much better understanding of what it's going to take to get us into the RvR groove. <br>
<br>
Thirdly, I was a group point man. I shouldn't have been. I was feeling quite under the weather last night, so much so that after the first wipeout, I logged off to go eat. I should have told Belce not to put me as point man. I know that on multiple occasions, I broke discipline, ran off and led a few people, including Forich's group, astray. At times, the orders coming down were unclear, even with Belce in my group. Getting lost in a sea of people from the other raid didn't help. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Finally, during the first wipeout at Dun Crauchon, I targeted a Norse (Healer I think) and hit /sticky. Unfortunately, when he started running back to the fort, I didn't unsticky from him, hoping that I could take him out before he led me too far in. Unfortunately, one of the other Seekers tank followed suit, and we both died right on top of each other, without having taken the healer out. BAD BAD idea, compounded by the fact that I knew better. <br>
<br>
Which brings me to point 4. Realm Point fever. When you go on 1 and 2 group expeditions, such as those Dulcette is running, you are after RP's for yourself and the guild. When you go into the frontier and do the Emain Tango, just hoping to get a group, you are out for realm points. You are NOT here for Realm Points when we do these Large Scale RvR events. If you get them, great. But that is not one of the goals of these raids, and will not be the goals of my raids. <br>
<br>
Just as when we ran Planes Raids and Dragon Raids in EQ, the Large Scale RvR events are to achieve a goal. That goal could be taking a keep, holding the Mile Fort, or just learning to move together as a large group, but there is a goal. Gaining Realm Points is NOT the goal, just like getting Lewtz on Planes Raids was not the goal... it was a fringe benefit. Discipline is key on these things. In these instances, we all need to subsume our individual desires, and our desire to &quot;go our own way&quot; and do what will help the team. Stay with your group, even if you see a sniper real close to you and you can take him. Unless you have specifically been assigned to sniper duty, stay with your group. Snipers can do wonderous things to groups, but only if you let them. A sniper will not wipe out the whole raid, unless you go running off after him. They are there to DISRUPT the raid, break us up, slow us down, and keep us from fighting as a cohesive unit. If you go running into the trees after him, and get out of healing range, he has succeeded. Stick with your group. <br>
<br>
Group leaders convey what's said in chat to the group. Scouts, be specific, use your compass. If you can't read a compass, don't be on the scout team. In the Sunday RvR (which was completely ad hoc), I was in a chat group, trying to get a position on the incoming Middie force (while we were waiting at Excalibur fort for them to come). The scout actually told me he didn't use the compass, and he was dead in the middle of lots of Middies. He couldn't even give me directions on where the Middie force was. Luckily, it wasn't anyone I knew. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It cost me 3 exp deaths, as I had to go try to find the Middies myself, just to be able to give accurate intelligence to other people on the raid. <br>
<br>
Group leaders, set a good example. Listen, be concise, and don't go running off half-cocked. <br>
<br>
We can do MUCH better than we did last night. And we will.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>
