Keep in mind that rezzing does not give back experience, but does bring you back to the spot where you died, and removes the constitution loss. The only way to gain the xp back is to /pray at your grave, which means you must /release back to your bind point upon death. If you /release, you cannot be ressed. <br>

Midgard looks to have the biggest problem in the RvR game with reviving fallen comrades in the heat of battle, but Albion Paladins waiting until level 30 to get the basic rez could also be a factor. Keep in mind this is the level of spell line specilization, so could be later in levels depending on what spells the caster specs in. <br>

<br>
In fact that makes getting a rez only reasonable during RvR and makes dungeon crawling a nasty and exp-expensive endeavour. <p><hr width=50%>werzat, Sylvan 1st Season Pathfinder<br>

What Dog and I have found is that Exp. actually flows MORE freely in DAoC than it does in EQ. In fact, it's easier to make back experience lost than it is to make back the money you lose on Constitution. Also, for things like dungeon crawling, a rez may be the only way to get back to your group easily, unless the whole group gets wiped out. I could be wrong about the xp loss though, since I'm not a cleric, and have only been rezzed a few times. <br>

<br>
&quot;Should your health bar become completely empty at any time, your character will die. When in the state of death, your body takes form of that of a ghost. You can see other players, but you can’t move around. If you are 5th level or lower, you may rejoin land of the living by typing /release with no penalty. This will return you to your nearest bind point with full health. After level 5, your character will lose experience for death by monsters and NPCs (though the experience loss will never cause you to lose a level). <br>
<br>
In addition to the experience loss, you will lose up to three points of constitution. Death caused during PVP (player versus player) combat does not incur an experience loss, though you will still lose constitution. You must pay an NPC healer, found in most towns, to have your constitution restored. <br>
<br>
You lose only one point of constitution per death per level, up to a maximum of three. For example, at 5th level, you will lose one point of constitution on your first death, two on your second, and three on every subsequent death.<br>
<br>
After 5th level, you can resurrect in one of two ways:<br>
<br>
Resurrection Method 1: At any time that you die after the 5th level, you will lose experience equal to 5% of the total experience required to attain the current level, unless this is the first death on this level, in which case the experience penalty is only half that amount. If you type /release, you will return to your last bind point and lose more experience, but no more than 10% of the total experience for that level. A gravestone will be erected at the point where you died. You can return to that point, select the gravestone and type /pray to regain the second part of the experience penalty. You will also incur a up to a 3-point penalty to your constitution, which can be replaced for a fee (which goes up each level) by one of the healers found in various places around the Realm. Finally, you will suffer from “res sickness,” a condition that lowers some of your stats temporarily. Res sickness wears off over time, or it can be removed, free of charge, by an NPC healer.<br>
<br>
Resurrection Method 2: The second alternative is to have a cleric use his or her resurrection command, which they learn at higher levels. Resurrection by a cleric avoids the second aspect of the experience penalty, the constitution penalty and the gravestone. You will also resurrect at the spot where you died instead of at the last bind location. In short, the only penalty you pay if you are resurrected by a cleric is the 5% experience penalty and temporary res sickness.<br>
<br>
There is a time limit after death.If this time limit is exceeded, your character will automatically release to its bind location.The formula for calculating how much time you have is simply 1 minute per level.So, if you are level 10, you will have 10 minutes before you auto release.&quot;<br>
<br>
So let's say you die at level 10 and it took you 100,000 exp. points to attain that level. On deaths after your first in that level, you'll lose 5,000 xp, and if you /release, you'll lose another 5,000 xp for a total of 10,000 xp (on your first death in that level you're total loss will be 5,000 xp). If you do not /release and are rezzed by a cleric, you only lose 5,000 xp, which would be the same amount you'd lose if you /released and came back to /pray at your gravestone. You also won't have to pay a healer to restore con points, which at level 9 cost me 125 copper per con point (which got expensive after a while). In short, whether rezzed or not, you'll only ever lose 5% xp of what it took to attain your current level... the only time you'll lose more is when you can't find or reach your gravestone to /pray. <br>
<br>
But as I said, xp is easier to regain than money sometimes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

LOL..now for winning the battle..that is a completely different story! <br>
<br>
Also, I have ready some reports by the designers that for some reason they consider Hibernia to be the most &quot;healing&quot; oriented of the realms.   I am not sure why in that respect...perhaps due to their closeness with nature...anyway, &quot;facts is facts&quot; and is shown by how early and how soon (level wise) the Hibernian classes get rez.  <br>
<br>
Boy! was I surprised when I read bards got rez with Hibernia..then I started to read why...and then it made complete sense.   <br>

If I understand all of that:<br>

You drop 5% of your exp when you die and another 5% when your soul leaves your gravesite (as well as Con points) and you can /pray at your grave to regain that 5% you lost when your ghost went wandering off to your bind spot.  <br>
<br>
A Healer can revive your body, which means no soul departing the body so no additional lost exp or lost Con points and no grave (since your body is reanimated).<br>

<br>
From memory, the actual death message reads something like:<br>
<br>
You have died in defense of your realm and thus lose no experience for this death.<br>
<br>
In practice, dieing to an enemy NPC is exactly the same as dieing to an enemy PC (I've been killed by both now &lt;chuckle&gt;).<br>
<br>
Rezing in Albion is actually a spell, complete with power usage and a casting time. Power use is dependent upon the level of the cleric as compared to the level of the one being rezed. At level 20, I have rezed players in their mid 30's and it used virtually all my power. If I rez someone level 10, I use almost no power.<br>
