Not form a &quot;what can we get&quot; but a &quot;what do we need in priority&quot; framework.<br>
<br>
Seems to me we'd need a forge, 1 vault, gh porter, all right off the bat.  Since we can bind in gh (or sauvage if I read correctly) and portal directly to the GH a bind isn't really that important atm.<br>
<br>
I'm looking at a setup for a craft-house and rvr-house (rvr -&gt; cottage) as it's easier on the brain <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Also it's the logical place for a lathe and you need a wood merchant for RvR so...all kinda falls together on that level too (I think).  Hidien's idea of vaulted rams sounds like a better plan than a siege merchant.  With 100 slots we can easily keep a good 10 rams in the siege locker there.<br>
<br>
What we've spent so far:<br>
1plat - forge<br>
0plat - spellcraft/alc table (donation)<br>
0plat - spellcraft merchant (donation)<br>
1plat - guild vault (1)<br>
~650gold - upgrades to facing of the guild houses, placing of emblems.<br>
100g - portal to GH merchant<br>
<br>
<br>
So large ammenities...there are 3 hookpoints in the cottage, 4 in the house for merchants and such.  So let's see what we need NPC-wise:<br>
<br>
Healer <br>
GH porter<br>
Albion Vault<br>
Border Portal Keep Teleporter <br>
Apprentice Tradeskills Merchant &lt;- this assumes that that wood for ram construction and door repair aren't located on the GM merchant)<br>
Grandmaster Tradeskills Merchant <br>
Spellcrafting Merchant <br>
Alchemy Merchants (2 sets of two merchants, configured differently ) <br>
<br>
That's 9 and we have 7...methinks we're 2 hookpoints shy.<br>
<br>
Now, two ways to look at this:<br>
1) Our alliancemates have some of these featuers and we can use their equipment (but can make making ram parts a bit annoying)<br>
2) We keep 2 of them locked in a vault and exchange them out as needed.  Caveat to this is that apparently <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you can not delegate the ability to place tools or NPCs</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> so only the house-owner can do it.<br>
<br>
Now the healer/albion vault are pefect for this as they'd prolly be in the basement anyway but I can't think of any other 'exchangables' that won't mess something up someplace.<br>
<br>
Seems to me that the priority to get these in would be:<br>
1) Spellcraft merch (paid for)<br>
2) GH Porter (have) <br>
3) Alb Vault<br>
4) Grandmaster Tradeskills Merchant <br>
5) Apprentice Tradeskills Merchant<br>
6) Alc 1<br>
7) Alc 2<br>
Healer<br>
BK Porter  <br>
(Healer isn't relevant w/o a BK porter b/c if you port to GH you can use the healer there)<br>
<br>
I see no need for a consignment merchant either as only the guildleader rank can use the dern thing -- but make a case if you think it could be useful.<br>
<br>
NPCs we don't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Hastener <br>
Smith <br>
Enchanter <br>
Emblemeer <br>
Recharger <br>
Capital City Teleporter <br>
Border Non-portal Keep Teleporter *<br>
Siegecraft Supplies Merchant *<br>
* would be cool to have<br>
<br>
Keep in mind we can get other NPCs but they'd have to be swapped out by either by someone with guildleader rank for the guild house or the house-owner for the cottage (We've the treasury-bot there who owns the cottage and holds guildleader rank but that doesn't help if neither Rhi or I are on)<br>
<br>
So let's look at NPC pricing:<br>
1) 0 cost to guild (member donation)<br>
2) 0 cost to guild (purchased already)<br>
3) 100g<br>
4) 500g<br>
5) 100g<br>
6) 100g<br>
7) 100g<br>
(healer) 3plat<br>
(snow port) 500g<br>
<br>
Net: 900g<br>
(opt) 4plat, 400g<br>
<br>
Bindstone...I can see this being useful in RvR but I can see it being a royal pain in the ass too.  It's really only good for RvR purposes that I can see (/rel, grab rams or repair wood, port) as if you wanted to suicide to the house you'd just bind in GH and grab a guildhouse port.  Don't see the merrits on this besides that but I'll tentatively put it on &quot;the list&quot; as I can see that being desired.<br>
<br>
Bindstone (cottage) - 1plat<br>
net: 1plat, 900g<br>
(opt 5plat, 400g)<br>
<br>
Vaults!<br>
There is currently 1 vault in the guild house that everyone has put/take rights on.  Our guild vault will be put in there soon as we get this all straightened out and get an albion vault NPC.<br>
<br>
1 vault needs to be in the cottage for a siege locker and quick turn-around.<br>
<br>
There is space for another vault in the house but as yet I can't think of a need for it unless we want to make a 'deposite for salvage' vault or something, for ease of donation to the guild...(not even sure if that makes sense but if we did that at all then we'd have to worry about the wrong things /salved from the guild vault...maybe...suggestions on the need of a 2nd guild vault in the house?)<br>
<br>
cottage-&gt; 1plat<br>
<br>
net 2plat, 900g<br>
(opt 6plat, 400g)<br>
<br>
<br>
Tools!<br>
Forge (have it)<br>
Spellcraft table) 0 cost to guild, donation<br>
Lathe: 1plat<br>
<br>
net 3plat, 900g<br>
(opt 7plat, 400g)<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, with our current fund, we can cover the opt price by a hair, but can easily cover the net price.<br>
<br>
Decorations....<br>
<br>
Frankly, I feel we need a porch...the house just looks odd w/o it.<br>
<br>
Porch deed, 500 gold <br>
<br>
I'd kill for some trees too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<br>
Now inside/outside decorating is going to be a challange.  Just with three folks helping me setup my 'office' it got more than a little confusing at times.<br>
<br>
Dunno if we should set a budget for decorating or maybe a special fund for it...  Just on the office I setup, I spent 1.5plat -- now, agreed, I don't do spartin well but we could easily drop some heavy cash on decorations.  The restriction on number of items can kill ya hard too so I'm sure some rearranging will need to be done.<br>
<br>
Now we can go slow or fast on decorations and if we find we don't like something, it sells back for the same price so no loss if we change our minds.  One thing to note, however, is that while woodworking has some items that can be made, they are only larger/smaller versions of what you buy anyway.  First you buy &quot;it&quot; then get materials to modify &quot;it&quot;.  No making it yourself and saving on price -- can you say Albion learned from Microsoft's marketing techniques?<br>
<br>
ANYway, the former SE folks have en masse RvR on Thursdays, we do it on Fridays so..how's Saturday for our meeting/mouse-warming?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(That's not a type-o, either.  We tailors take care of those who helped us get to LGM status and I just can't stand it to see a mouse freeze)<br>

<br>
I would like to see a bindstone, a seige merchant, and a porter to Fort Sauvage.  Having the seige merchant allows us to purchase trebs as well as rams, so it has it's advantages.  Depending upon someone to build 'ram parts' and place them in the vault I can forsee causing problems.<br>
<br>
Porting to GH for regular RvRing is truly a pain in the ass.  It adds additional time and inevitably causes groups to have to wait for additonal ports.  As it stands now, I keep both bound at FS because it's still much easier.  If we do have an event that requires us to be in SI, one long horse ride is much better than messing with the 'numbnut' porter in Goth Harbour five times a night &lt;give or take&gt;.<br>
<br>
I also like the idea of alchemist there as well, but am not exposed to whether we can buy products from someone who holds the items themselves....or is that the porch merchant?<br>
<br>
I wouldn't really worry about a Snow portal at this point.  And if we do go with a FS porter, we can always grab a horse to Snow from there.<br>
<br>
As far as a healer goes, I don't see it as a huge priority.  Most of the time, you are waiting long enough for a port that time is ticking off that release effects anyways or you stop and rebuff for timers anyways.  In all fairness though, both my characters don't really suffer much from rez/release effects.<br>
<br>
If we don't need the Apprentice Tradeskills Merchant for much, then I would much rather see BK Porter to FS.<br>
<br>
I agree a porch would be nice.  Personally I don't think a Lathe is a must-have quite yet.  Fletching is rare and I really don't mind going to Diogel to do the orders.  Or worse running Dulcette to Camelot with the required items to make things.  I see it as something down the road, but a forge has a much greater need, just from a /salvage alone stand point.<br>
<br>
Decorations:  Upgrading guild flags.  Large gathering table would be nice.  Maybe a couple of chairs and a rug upon entry just so it doesn't look empty.  The rest we can get as we gather more funds.<br>
<br>

<br>
There's definately a point to the CS port, but we should also have the GH port.<br>
<br>
No other ideas off-hand.<br>

<br>
What are you talking about?  <br>
<br>
&quot;Porting to GH for regular RvRing is truly a pain in the ass. It adds additional time and inevitably causes groups to have to wait for additonal ports.&quot;<br>
<br>
Um...you have the same port-time from the housing zone to the PK as you do from Goth...so if you bind at the house it's no praticle difference than binding in Goth.  Getting rams/wood would be something but you could stock up beforehand and put it in your bank.<br>
<br>
I'm really confused now as to why you'd want to bind there if GH is such a pain.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for a siege merchant, it's a 1-trick pony that eats an entire hook-point.  Hid's suggestion of using our crafters and making a siege locker looks like this:<br>
<br>
100 slots/4 pieces for a ram = 25rams.  Naturally you don't want to stuff it full of rams alone but have a percentage of rams and trebs -- 60/40ish I'd guess.  And at least one other guild in the alliance has stated they were going to have a siege merchant so <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>in a pinch</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> we could go that direction.<br>
<br>
You only need 500 in the skill to make the pieces so I'm not seeing that as a logistical barrier either.<br>
<br>
I'll pull the merchants out tonight and see what we're up against, hard to figure anything out with Mythic's descriptions.<br>
<br>
&quot;I also like the idea of alchemist there as well....or is that the porch merchant?&quot;<br>
<br>
They are supply merchants like the rest.  If we put up a porch merchant, you can put finished goods on him but he sells to everyone so there's no guarentee of availability.<br>
<br>
(Edit: &quot;...siege merchant, it's a 1-trick pony...&quot;  I take it back.  Either they added to this guy or my memory is faulty but he's a two-trick pony, you can buy made pieces or all materials to make them yourself.) <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brothervincent>Brother Vincent</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.silverdaggers.net/img/ge.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 7/2/03 10:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=norwoodblack>Norwood Black</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 681<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(7/1/03 7:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1741.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pricing, Guild fund, and Your Comments</span><hr size=1> Sounds like the hookpoints will be the limiting factor, not the pp.  We can always farm for another week if we really want to raise enough cash to probably buy everything on the list.

Porters - From what I am understanding the guild officers decided to put in a SI - Goth Harbour porter already.  Meaning if I am in the guild house, I have the option to port to GH.<br>
<br>
I am explaining that as someone who RvRs frequently, I believe it very beneficial that there be a Porter to Fort Sauvage as well.  If I am bound at the guildhouse, whereby I can pick up rams, then I would like to port directly to Fort Sauvage.  It's a disadvantage to then have to port to GH and then to FS, the delay is bad enough already without an additonal port.<br>

Hopefully, you can understand now.<br>

I'm still confoozed...  Banners and Emblem are purchased for house and cottage, inside and outside.  If I'm still missing something, lemme know.<br>
<br>

<br>
Hey, I fully agree.  But it's a matter of logistics.  Mythic in it's infinite lack of wisdome curtailed the number of hookpoints to be obscenely low.  I'd prefer a GH in the house and a BK in the cottage (so you streamline the entire process) but we can't get in the craft vendors we need.<br>
<br>
The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>bitch</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of that is you can't delegate swapping out the bleedin' merchants.  If we could, we could work around the crafting thing but we can't -- and Mythic dev-nulls my /appeals and they never, ever answer e-mail about bugs even to say it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>is</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> one.<br>
<br>
IMHO it ranks up there with the lack-of-foresight of paying rent.  Tell me why everyone in the guild can't stuff money in the lockbox for rent...or why a passer-by can't pay someone else's rent on a house...I mean, hell, if they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>want</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to, why stop them?!  */em realizes he's ranting again*<br>
<br>
Anyway, at present anyway, GH is the transfer hub of the realm.  (If they'd put a porter to GH in sauvage, it'd resolve the entire problem and make a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>lot</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of people happy...but I digress)  It's not a -written in stone- solution, just the most logical one we have at the moment.  And if the allies fill out the post I stuffed over on the allliance board, we may have something just next door we can swap out 99% of the time in favor of a sauvage port and swap back in for craft fairs or whatever.<br>
<br>
(I'm mulling over another solution but we'll see how that plays out)<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought there was a /release and /release house? Am I wrong?<br>
<br>
If so, bind normal in sauvage and /release house for goodies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rhi was gonna test that on penny tonight but never got around to it.  I thought only home-owners could do that to be honest -- and I can't trust Mythic's documentation or lack of.  If it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>is</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> like that, then a bind-stone makes a lot of sense as you get basically 2 binds.<br>
<br>
In that case, I can live w/o the healer being part of the package on the bind, etc. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=norwoodblack>Norwood Black</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 682<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(7/2/03 8:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1741.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pricing, Guild fund, and Your Comments</span><hr size=1> How much do we need to upgrade the cottage to a house?

<br>
Guild House (Nappa 9)<br>
<br>
1 Spellcraft Merchant<br>
2 Grandmaster Tradeskills Merchant <br>
3 Goth Harbor Porter<br>
4 Alb Vault <br>
<br>
Cottage (Nappa 10)<br>
1 Alb Vault and/or Healer<br>
2 Siege Merchant<br>
3 Border Keep Porter<br>
<br>
<br>
Cottage (Kingsdale 1)<br>
1 Alchemy Merchant 1 (poison and potion)<br>
2 Alchemy Merchant 2 (potion, tincture, enchantment)<br>
3 Alchemy Merchant 3 (dye, tincture, enchantment)<br>
<br>
Siege Merchants have all the construction components on them as well as the items themselves, ergo if you want to make siege equipment or just buy the stuff, a siege merchant covers both bills.<br>
<br>
Also, this theory removes the low-end materials merchant and causes the purchase of another spellcraft/alc table and gets 3 of the 4 alc merchants (so if you want to dyes, you may be out of luck).  We can purchase the low-end materials merchant and vault him if we think there's sufficient reason to -have- one besides using it to build siege equipment.<br>

&quot;You can make your home your binding location&quot;  ok, you can change your bind to your house.  This implies only 1 bind-point<br>

&quot;In order to successfully /release from a death to your home bind location&quot;  ok, '/release house' to release to your binding location (using above language) if in a Foundations zone.<br>

Does it say that &quot;/release&quot; by itself takes you to a you non-Foundations bindpoint?  Or does &quot;/release&quot; do nothing if your &quot;binding location&quot; is in Foundations?<br>

(i.e. if Rhi owns the house, Miara cannot Hearth Portal or /houseface (w/o a lot #))  It also means that 2 people sharing a house (Rasha/Nami, Dulc/Hid) cannot both do a Hearth Portal -- nor can the other do any tool or NPC moving/adding.<br>

I packed up my 'office' for the cash and nabbed a plot before I ran off to work (...so anyone who wants to come bag some shreaders with me is welcome) as I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>had</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be in the office today to deploy one of my apps to several accounts -- wish I coulda waited but *shrug* at least I got to pick the plot I wanted instead of worrying about it all day.  It's about a 20sec run from the guild house so I don't need any of the vendor spots.  Figured <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>what the hell</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> turn it into an alchemy emporium -- and since alc's spread out across 4 vendors (not..gonnna...say..it) it's better to get 3 of them together -- and solve all the issues.<br>
<br>
Edit: Since there seems to be some confusion on this issue...  The only way to arrange things was to go with another cottage.  There were no other officers around at the time I came up with the arrangement so there was no one to run it by but it seemed logical enough to do.<br>
<br>
So I checked lot prices, did the count-down math, packed up the 'office' stuff I'd purchased with my <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>own</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> funds, logged out near a post in Kingsdale.  Logged in, waited for the prices to drop another notch (and was fairly late for work b/c of it) and purchased a lot and put up a cottage.<br>
<br>
Now I was tooling around with the idea of getting a house anyway once they dropped to 1plat but there was no way to guarentee where it'd be -- not a serious issue for me to be honest -- but as I wasn't going to use the merchant points anyway (well, alb vault but not like I'd need him out all the time) and the guild could use 3 more, it seemed prudent to get one close to the guild houses so that we could have crafting fair w/o going to Diogel to get parts made.  So with that in mind, I purchased early so I could get the spot I chose (listed above) to make things simple.<br>
<br>
To reiterate:  I purchaed <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>my own</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> cottage with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>my own money</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and offered the option to open it for guild use. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brothervincent>Brother Vincent</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.silverdaggers.net/img/ge.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 7/2/03 10:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhianidd>Rhianidd</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://werzat.freeservers.com/ge.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Human Blade Turn</span><br>  Posts: 1276<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(7/2/03 5:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1741.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pricing &amp; Guild Fund: Your Comments Required</span><hr size=1> Looks good to me, Vince.<br>
