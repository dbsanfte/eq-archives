Realizing late that there was no leader and trying to patch it together is bound to create this kind of confusion and disorganization. This was entirely my fault and again I hope you can all forgive me, but I was unavoidably pulled away, and my attempts to contact Molfious were unsuccessful. I should have thought to call on Belce but it did not occur to me.<br>
<br>
I would hate to see one set back like this derail our attempts at organizing large events. The key is always learn from the past and move on. Lets not put off planning more because of one bad outing.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we should have 2 people in on raid organization from the start so that in the event something like this happens we can recover more gracefully.<br>
<br>
Remember this happened to us once before when the raid organizer could not log on, and we suffered the same sort of trouble getting things going.<br>
<br>
In short lets suck it up, and move on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/uwerzat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>werzat</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>has been run over by Dulcette</span><br> <font color=#0000FF>(1/2/02 2:27:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://werzat.freeservers.com/vincent.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Forgive and move on...</span><hr size=1> I agree Lorne; I see no reason to stop holding large-scale events.

The mistakes that occured (the honest ones) are always there and that raid was just not gelling no matter what anyone did.<br>
<br>
Joint-planning a raid is always a good idea, in fact involving the raid staff (and backups) in it is also a good idea if it's feasable.   <p><table border=1 bgcolor="#161C81"width=80%>

Knowing that we can feel better about the next time we do something together and we will be doing more together.  <br>
<br>
Sorry about not getting Thor in the chat group, I did know it was needed and tried a few times, hence forth all group leaders will be named Tom, Jill, Frank or other easy to spell name &lt;Yeah I said the words,... well sorta&gt; This bit here is an example of a time when it is a good thing to just sit down, not move until this is fixed, call your group leader on the floor and spam me with demands to get it fixed.  This one thing goes a long way in explaining what seriously fubar'd our efforts last night and that is entirely my error.  I was able to invite to the chat group, I knew it was needed, I just couldn't spell that name and did not take the time to get it. <br>
<br>
Some of the things we know that we need to improve is keeping our people together in areas where there are many others such as Mile Forts.  One of the things I do is pick someone in my group and make sure I find them and stay with them.  In this manner I insure that we get our group together in some good time, like the snowball effect. <br>
<br>
Initiative and team responsiblity<br>
<br>
I like initiative, people able to make a decision and move it forward without needing every step confirmed for them, I like seeing groups operate as an individual unit responsible to themselves first and foremost.  Having said this I would like us to hold back here at first while we get up to speed, lets pay attention to what we are all doing, do it all together and later we can extend a looser set of rules for engagement.  The important thing to realize is that the smallest unit is not the individual, but the group.  One person can not accomplish anything, one person trying to solo in a group is even worse. Your group is responsible for you and your solo efforts are going to endanger your groupmates.  Therefore while you are alone and getting ganked it doesn't affect anyone other than yourself.  When you are in a group doing this you have recklessly endangered the people that are committed to aid you.   Things that you might be expected to do is to uncover or bait the Middie healers so we can deal with them, this could hurt, don't think star quarterback or like that.  I want people that want to be on the best team and not best on team.  Don't look at your individual RP's but instead look at the guild RP's for a measure of success if you want. <br>
<br>
Communicating Information<br>
<br>
We all have a real job here to relay information as you get it.  The sooner we can all be on the same page the better, but to be helpful we need proper correct info.  Information needs to include at the very least a direction and a landmark so it can be placed.  Vague information is just as good as no information, pretending to be Paul Reevre yelling the Middies are coming is not helpful. A direction and location is the minimum needed, more is better.  You don't need to get it all out right away, just start with a heading, type and a landmark. &quot;Hibies NW of DC&quot;  Later you can add number and con if possible. <br>

Learning the strengths of each character and what they can do out in RvR land.  I know for a fact, a few were surprised I can run and mez at the exact same time &lt;I am not being faceious (sp)&gt;.  Or the fact that I, if two to three mobs, can hold two of them off while the rest of the party take them down one at a time.  For the matter, someone people just need to get use to the SPEED to which I travel BEEP BEEP.  <br>
<br>
Operating as one solid unit, made us more effective, being more effective allowed us the opportunity to gain more realm points.  Therefore, the realm points become a benefit to the goal to which we are there to achieve.  The reward for disciplined actions.<br>

<br>
1.  Communication<br>
2.  Listen<br>
3.  Communication<br>
4.  The map I printed out of Hibernia Frontier did not have MF1, MF2 on it.<br>
5.  Communication<br>

8.  Seasoned GLs<br>

<br>
I see we are at the point on this thread where we are putting this past us and going forward.  However, I was curious as to why I, a level 25 cleric, was in a group with 6 armsmen.  There was no way I could buff them all properly.  Worst, level 31 cleric was in a group with all casters.  Would like to know how groups are made.  I'm thinking maybe because the casters are physically weaker yet are more powerful in damage, they need a stronger cleric to keep them alive?<br>
<br>
I wish I could say I had fun on my first RvR last night.  I was confused by all the running around and lost some times because the group would just take off.  I would /stick to someone but because their computer was faster than mine, I would lose the /stick.  Several times I was by myself on mountain walls wishing I had tracking <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Another question I had was, I noticed someone said the players in Hibernia Frontier were all level 50 or close to it.  How can 3 groups of 20s and 30s possibly succeed against level 50s?<br>
<br>
I would much rather go on smaller RvR raids; at least for now.  They would seem to be more controled and disciplined. All I saw last night was chaos.  But I got 32 RPs!!<br>

I came late, people were LD or left, I quickly shuffled everything as possible and adjusted the best I could.  I had asked group leaders to send me who was in their group and class.  At the time I made up your group, there were two clerics.  The group leader didn't bother to share with me that the other cleric left, other than repeatedly tell me they want PLAYER XXXXX in their group.  I did at first try to balance out casters and armsman and minstrels between groups, putting all stealth people in the Main group.  I neglected, when I found out that the other cleric camped to see what level healers we had in the groups.<br>

<br>
Yes there will be times when events in peoples lives interrupt plans they have made. Real life and/or virtual life for that matter, it just happens.<br>
<br>
I commend those that stepped in and tried to make the best out of an already difficult situtation, and I can understand peoples frustration.<br>
<br>
Remember, arguement and disagreement doesn't have to divide us, but rather it should challenge us and in the end bring us closer together. Through the use of effective discourse we all become better players and friends.<br>
<br>
So remember - try to take peoples criticisms and/or suggestions for what they are meant to be - an attempt to make us all better. <br>
<br>
At the same time, if you have a suggestion/cristism to make, say it in a constructive manner. In the end, we should be benifiting from these experiences even if they don't always go the way we want them to go. <br>

Probably a good idea to set up a system that once recruited they get these passwords via email.<br>

<br>
I asked the group leaders I selected to create good and balanced groups and gave each a chance to make a group one at a time.  I did this to take the job of making groups from myself to those.  The best way I think is to do a /who silver and a /who seekers then have the raid leader, me, make the groups.  Those that show as in Emain are put in groups and it is easy to scroll through the names to do this.  I took a shortcut and did so to make this part go faster, we had already delayed that night and giving people something to do makes it seem to go faster.   No one should have selected all of any type for their group and as they did they erred in selection.<br>

I have posted your request for that password in the officer forum for Haemish to send to you and to take steps that it does not occur again.  Thank you for letting us know.<br>

<br>
that's somethoing Mythic may want to look into.. I can't iunderstand _why_ we should need to /anon to prevent the enemy from knowing we're there.....<br>
