Horizons<br>
<br>
Phoenix is known as the valley of the sun. So said Captain James, who flew me from California to Arizona Friday morning, and so said banners and scrolling marquees in the Sky Harbor airport. “Welcome to Phoenix, the Valley of the Sun!” While this is my first time in Phoenix in over ten years, I didn't need any special reminders about the sun's residency. I knew exactly what to expect. It was about ninety degrees Fahrenheit when my plane landed at about five after nine AM, and I figure that it probably reached the projected high of 109. At about six PM, it's still unpleasantly warm outside, which makes me glad that I'm inside a nice air conditioned building. Valley of the Sun, indeed.<br>
<br>
The sun, however grudgingly, shares its valley with Artifact Entertainment, developers of the highly anticipated Horizons, scheduled for release this fall. While I did see plenty of sun in Phoenix, the true purpose and focus of my visit was this upcoming MMORPG, and the development house currently devoting their time to it's development.<br>
<br>
Let me start off with an introduction of the game, for readers out there who haven't heard of Horizons, or who haven't followed its development closely. If you've been following Horizons news dutifully, go ahead and skip this paragraph, as it won't cover anything new. The game is an MMORPG, looking to support about 5,000 concurrent users on any given shard/server/world—whatever you want to call them. It takes place on a fantasy world known as Istaria, which is a new world created for the game. There is quite a lot of backstory to the game (much of it already available online), but to distill the very basics of the story into a sentence, you have the following oversimplification: three hundred years ago, a human necromancer created an undead army and virtually eliminated all life on Istaria, now the war may potentially be coming to an end as the undead have recently suffered their first major defeat as the living races finally were able to work together to defend the city of Tazoon. It's almost painful to simplify the story that much (I know the guys at Artifact would cringe). There's plenty of other interesting tales going on in the history of Istaria, including the schism in Dragon culture (a playable race in Horizons), the split between the Humans and Fiends, and lots more. Featuring nine playable races at launch, a skill-based experience system that includes both adventure and crafting skills, and property for players to own, on the surface, Horizons sounds like most other MMORPGs. Reading through the various material available online about the game (in particular, the developer's journals), you will start to get the idea that this is not the case. Spending a day or two at Artifact Entertainment, you certainly get an idea that there's something different going on here.<br>
<br>
I spent a large part of my day today with David Bowman, Creative Director of Horizons, and I can already picture him objecting to something in this article. I don't think he would like the fact that I used the word “currently” a paragraph back. He would respond to say that Artifact isn't just “currently devoting their time,” as one of the things that Artifact (and David in particular) is very proud of is the extendability and dynamic nature of Horizons. One of the things that he was quick to mention is that for most content updates, the Horizons servers will not have to come down for patching. I saw this in action, as a couple of the world builders entered the server. One of the world builders created a mountain. It seemed like a simple operation with the toolset that the team uses, and he had a decent new piece of landscape created and placed within about two minutes. He then clicked a button to save changes to the server, and I watched on the second computer as the world changed to reflect his efforts—all while the other player remained in-game. David says that adding new monsters, quests, NPCs, spells, weapons, etc. can all be done in basically the same way, once an object is ready for use in the world and it is saved to the server, it can be sent in and will be immediately incorporated into the world. While the servers will have to come down sometimes for maintenance or some other issue, the majority of updates to the game itself can occur while servers are live.<br>
<br>
While dynamic updating is a very cool feature, it wouldn't matter too much if the content wasn't interesting to begin with. So let's talk about the game's content. David told me that one of the big things he sees as missing in the current MMORPGs is purpose, or “why?” To this end, Artifact is attempting to provide a lot of context and purpose for players in Horizons. The backstory of Istaria is closely woven with the players' lives. A powerful Necromancer was besieging the living races with his undead armies for hundreds of years. Some races haven't been heard from at all in that time. While the undead no longer seems to be attacking Tazoon, almost the entire rest of the world is under their control. Tazoon seems to be largely safe, while the rest of the land is considered “frontier.” Players can settle the frontier, beating back the undead, expanding the territory of the Living Races. Frontier towns can be attacked by roving undead monsters, forcing players to defend their own settlements. Clearing an area of undead and fighting back enough invasions could actually push the frontier further out, expanding the “safer” territories. <br>
<br>
This is all done entirely through the game and the monster AI: World Masters do not have to use their admin tools to control undead monsters and attack settlements with them. Instead, certain types of monsters have certain types of AI patterns. One monster may search for appropriate locations to build structures, such as zombie-generating crypts. The crypt then spits out zombies (or whatever), and once a large enough party is spawned, they will wander about, searching for living things to destroy (or communities to attack). Another monster may wander about looking for other monsters to join its party. Once this group gets large enough, the leader starts seeking out enemies for his little army to take on. Or perhaps he comes across a dire wolf, which is much more powerful than the ghoul he has with him, so he drops the ghoul and picks up the wolf. Now, I made up those monsters and their relative power (though I saw a dire wolf-ish model being animated: looked really good), so it may be a bad example, but the idea remains the same. While Horizons will have some static spawns (particularly in training areas in the “newbie” territory), most of the monsters in the world will be governed by these sort of policies. <br>
<br>
On the topic of the builder monster, I asked, and yes, he is governed by the same rules that players are for buildings. Specifically, he needs resources to build that crypt (or whatever). To this end, the Undead (and presumably other monsters) will gather resources. So players may discover a skeleton chopping trees down for one of these buildings. This ties into some of the context and purpose that Artifact is trying to give players. One of their overall goals in the big picture could be settling the frontier, which means at the microlevel, players don't want to let skeletons harvest resources. If the skeleton harvests resources, then he (or one of his undead buddies) could build a building, which could generate more undead, and keep this land infested. <br>
<br>
Tied to this, there are other contextual purposes for the long term. While the head necromancer appears to have been destroyed, his most powerful henchmen still... uhh.. unlive. Thus, players could choose to potentially attack and destroy these guys as well. I was told that this endeavor isn't a single high level character's job, or even a high level group. Projects such as this will require efforts of various degrees from the entire community on the server, to harvest resources, build buildings and artifacts, fight off the undead, settle and explore the new lands, all in the hope of eventually getting a group of players to this undead lord's home and taking him out. <br>
<br>
The other good contextual goal for players that we discussed briefly was the freeing of the subjugated races. Up above, I mentioned that some of the Living Races haven't been heard from since the beginning of this undead plague. There are others that have been heard from... but not in such a good way. A couple of the races have been enslaved by the undead, compelled somehow to do their bidding. While players could simply fight and kill these poor thralls of the the undead, they could instead choose to attempt to free the subjugated races from their undead masters. Doing this would effectively remove a whole slew of enemies from the game, and create allies in return. In fact, freeing the subjugated races could very well enable them as a playable race.<br>
<br>
Horizons is launching with nine playable races, David says that the future could easily see the introduction of other races. These subjugated races are just one example of methods to potentially introduce new playable races: considering the action at launch is centered on just one continent, I think another method for adding new races is pretty apparent as well. While many of the races look very cool (I particularly enjoyed the Saris—cat people—I created a pretty nice looking white tigress), none has created such the buzz as the Dragon. Don't be confused: when Artifact says that you can play as dragons, they don't mean humanoid reptilian creatures; they mean gigantic, winged, fire-breathing lizards. While none of the nine races places exactly the same as another, the Dragon clearly is a case all on its own.<br>
<br>
First, there is the whole flight thing. While dragons cannot fly until they reach maturity (I'll talk about this in a second), their flight certainly gives them some advantages over other races. Dragons will be able to fly across impassable landscape, reach areas inaccessible to flightless creatures, and get from place to place more quickly than others. It should be noted that non-dragons can fly via powerful magic as well, but dragons clearly are at home in the skies. In fact, they are much more at home in the skies than on the ground. Dragons crawl along the ground in a very lizardesque manner, but slowly, as they are large, cumbersome creatures. <br>
<br>
Of course, dragons also have the whole breath weapon thing going for them. Even at a young age, dragons can breath fire at their opponents. As they become older and more powerful, they eventually gain the ability to alter their breath weapon to spew frost or lightning instead. It should be noted that every race has special abilities specific to each, the breath weapon being one of the major abilities for the Dragons.<br>
<br>
With flight, breath weapons, and the overall cool factor of being a friggin' Dragon, I would expect that most players will wish to play a Dragon. I asked David if he expected this to be the case, comparing Dragons to Jedi in the upcoming Galaxies. He does expect most players to try a Dragon out for awhile at some point. However, he figures that overall, there will likely be a fairly balanced racial preference among players. The reason that Dragons likely won't be the overwhelming majority is the exact reason that many players will choose to try them out in the first place. Namely, they are a completely different play experience.<br>
<br>
Yeah, Dragons can fly and breath fire (or other), but there are some key things that they can't do that other players can. First, Dragons don't need weapons, or armor, or clothing at all. Not only do they not need them, they can't use them! While one low level player could take out a zombie and be happy to pick up an enchanted axe from its corpse, a low level Dragon has no use for this axe, or that armor, or that helmet, or... you get the idea. The only items that Dragons can use (I believe) are jewelry items, and these must be Dragon specific. Dragons have very limited crafting items: they are restricted to Dragon crafting: for jewelry, stones, or Dragon specific buildings. Dragons need their own buildings; they can't fit into those of most other races. Which means that should a Dragon find himself in Tazoon, may not be able to enter the blacksmith's shop (not that he would likely want to), because he can't fit through the door.<br>
<br>
I promised to talk about Dragon maturity. Dragons advance a bit differently than other races. Most races advance via a steady increase in their abilities through their use. Dragons do as well, but at a slightly slower rate. Then, Dragons reach a certain stage when they are ready to go through some sort of rite of passage, from child to adult, or adult to ancient. Upon going through these rites, Dragons make a huge leap in power, gaining new abilities (such as flight), and gaining skill. I discussed how Dragons have no use for weapons above, which is only kind of true. A Dragon also gains power through the size of its horde. Being naturally greedy creatures, Dragons do actually want to gather money and new items, to add to their horde, which is not only a status symbol, but a representation of the Dragon's power. The bigger the horde, the more powerful the Dragon.<br>
<br>
I mentioned only briefly the cool looking Saris I created, and that really isn't fair, so let me talk about the character creation a bit. You start by choosing one of the races, and a gender (if applicable, Dragons and Sssliks are basically genderless), and from there go through to customize your appearance. There's some major changes you can choose, the most noticeable being the skin/scale/fur coloration of your character. Continuing to use my Saris as an example, I had quite a few different fur colorations to chose from: leopard, panther, tiger, and then I stopped at the white tiger because I thought it looked cool. After choosing the major coloration of your character, there's other choices that tend to vary by race. One of the cooler examples of this was for the Sssliks, who could choose bone formations that bordered their heads with different bone patterns. I gave my Ssslik a bony mohawk, one of several different choices. This is a particularly cool example because since these protrusions are bones, they are incorporated into the animations of the character. There are still more customizations to make to a character's appearance though, and most of these remaining choices exist for all races. Place different heads on your character, or different eyes. Adjust sliders to select your character's height, bulk (in terms of both muscle and fat, as two separate sliders), and for female characters, endowment.<br>
<br>
I created four separate characters personally throughout the day. In addition to the two mentioned above, I also made a human (whom I aptly named &quot;Mega Fat&quot;), and a Dragon. I also saw many of the Artifact employees playing—err... working on--Horizons with characters that they created. From the panther-like Saris, to a mithril armor wearing human wizardess, to a black-scaled Dragon, to my own green-scaled alligator-like Dragon, there is a huge variety among the potential characters in the game, both within a single race and across the spectrum. <br>
<br>
Another aspect of the game that I have touched on only briefly is the community building aspect of the game. Players are permitted to own one plot of land in the game, upon which they can build as many buildings as can fit on that plot. These are not limited to houses; rather, players can choose from a slew of buildings to place on their plots, from homes, to businesses, to machines such as forges or looms. Buildings require resources, and once a player chooses to build something, any other player can contribute resources and know-how to its construction. So, I want to be a blacksmith, so I decide to build a smithing shop/forge on my property. Another player comes by, and sees scaffolding on my property, and checks to see what I'm building. He sees what I want, and notes what resources I need for my shop, perhaps including cedar planks. He has a bunch of cedar planks, as well as the requisite skill to add them to my shop (one of the crafting skills, more on these soon), so he can help me build the shop while working on his skill. Not all builders will be so kind, so I can put money into my shop that gets paid to those who add to it, through a simple interface. Say I'm a decent woodworker, but terrible with stone, which is also necessary to build my shop. I can set an option to pay five gold per stone unit added to my building, so fellow players who work well with stone can be compensated for working on my smithy for me. I no longer have to stand around my home paying people to work on it, I can log off, or go adventuring or wood chopping, and return to find myself a little bit poorer, but with a more complete building.<br>
<br>
Fortunately for me, I bought a pretty big plot of land, and my smithy shop has been raking in the dough for me (what can I say, I'm a great smith), so I think I'll add another building to my plot. I knew I could do this when I built my smithy, so I positioned the shop with room to spare, and now I think I'll add my house to my plot as well. Horizons' plot management system does not use a grid: I can rotate my buildings for maximum aesthetic appeal or efficient land usage. Further, as long as I can fit them onto my plot, I can keep adding buildings.<br>
<br>
Of course, Horizons emphasizes communities, and as such, your plot doesn't exist in a vacuum. Most plots that are available for purchase exist very close to others. These are the communities that players can build up together... with some help from NPCs... kind of. So, I built my smithy on my plot of land. I realized location was important, and I built it in a developing community rather than in a largely uninhabited region. Nearby, other players were creating some other developments, both housing and shops. As we develop these buildings, some other plots that we could not purchase get scaffolding on them. These are community lots and community buildings. Players cannot purchase them, but all players in the community benefit from them. One of these buildings will be a training hall, and if players help build it, NPC trainers will move in, enabling players to train into new schools in their own towns. Other community buildings could include such things as NPC run shops, and travel gates, allowing instant transportation to other towns (these will be extremely expensive to build). Plans for the future include potential defensive structures as well. <br>
<br>
The Horizons trailer from E3 showed another example of a community plot, though it wasn't even in a community. The trailer showed a large river separating two landmasses, impassable as it is too large of a gap to swim across. However, players have the ability to construct an actual bridge across the gap. This is an example of players actually changing the way the world works. In some cases, bridges may reach land masses that are unreachable any other way (possibly excluding flight). In others, they may simply reduce travel time by a great deal. Things such as this really allow the players focusing on crafting a chance to be important to the game. Previously, crafting was a sort of side focus, something to do while bored in town, but Horizons is set to give crafters a chance to shape the world similarly to their adventuring counterparts.<br>
<br>
The final cool building-related thing I have to talk about are the castle plots. A special kind of plot in the game, only one building can be placed on these: the keep. Once a player buys this plot and completes his keep, other plots become available surrounding the keep, allowing players to essentially complete a castle. The player who owns the keep gets some special privileges should he choose to use them: he can set certain restrictions for his community, such as taxes or requirements for buildings. David expects that getting a castle community completed will be one of the first big goals that players will focus on, and there will be quite a bit of prestige associated with completing a castle, particularly that first one. He also warns that the undead will have a special hatred for castles...<br>
<br>
Obviously, players will be more successful in building these communities if they work together. In the MMORPG world, this usually means guilds. Horizons provides some pretty neat tools for guilds in-game. The founder of the guild can set restrictions on the type of players in the guild (this is a wizard guild). He can also create command ranks for his guild members, giving certain privileges (such as recruitment), only to players with the appropriate command rank. In-game calender and event scheduling tools exist as well, so that you can set up special events such as guild meetings, raids, or grand-opening celebrations, all without ever logging out. Guild management can all be done within the UI, and more specifically, within special windows. Players won't have to master slash commands in the chat window, the interface looks really simple to use.<br>
<br>
On the general topic of the interface, it is extremely customizable. The interface guys even surprised David when they were demoing it to me. Any of the various pieces of the interface can be enabled or disabled. The health and experience bars can include numbers, or they can simply be graphical bars. Their panel can be resized, or it can be switched so that the bars are vertical rather than horizontal. Inventory can be displayed in a list, or via a grid and icons. The whole interface can be reskinned. One of the coolest features of the interface is that you can attach portions of it to the sides of the screen. Once this happens, you can have it hide itself, sliding off the side of the screen, to slide back on with the press of a button. Very slick.<br>
<br>
The last thing I'm going to touch on is the graphical representation of the game, specifically the spells and weather effects. Weather is set up with sort of dynamically defined weather zones. As you enter the zone of a blizzard, clouds will roll in, and snow will fall, starting lightly, but rapidly growing to driving gusts of snow. I watched as a player entered and exited this zone, and the change in weather and ambiance is pretty cool. First the clouds start obscuring the stars, and within a minute or so, the large clouds of snow blowing around are obscuring the landscape as well.<br>
<br>
Spells are another story. Mostly done with particle effects, spells vary quite a bit in the effects department. This holds true not only from one spell to the next, but also within the same spell from one level to another. A weak healing spell creates a nice, soft glowing blue effect around its target. That same spell cast by a more powerful character creates that same effect, but larger and more elaborately. Obviously, the more powerful spells appear powerful from the beginning. I watched a character summon forth a big angry guy from the earth, who rose up and smacked his target good. A cooler spell I saw involved the creation of a tornado. This spell actually effects the weather in the region, so players who are nearby but not necessarily in visual range will notice an increase in cloud cover. Some spells include some camera shake as well which looks pretty cool when set to a nice level of shake. <br>
<br>
Final Thoughts:<br>
<br>
The problem with MMORPGs is that, if done right, there's a lot to talk about. I have to say, Horizons looks like its being done right, and there's tons to talk about. In a whole day with Artifact, they couldn't tell me about everything they would have liked to, and even if they had, there's no way I could have conveyed it all to you in this article. Horizons is taking massively multiplayer games to new places, and I can't wait. I was promised a preview copy of the game, likely in about a month, so I'll really be able to get a feel for how all these cool ideas translate to the gameplay experience. Look for Horizons in the fall, as the appropriately named game seems likely to change the face of the MMORPG forever.<br>

<br>
Say everyone wants ol' Vince to be GL, everyone declares fealty to Vincent.<br>
<br>
After a while, Vincent's drunken carousing and repeated thumping things with amusing carved sayings on his staff gets on some people's nerves and they want Rasha to be GL, they declare their fealty to Rasha.<br>
<br>
But Rasha only has 45% of the guild declaring fealty to him so he's just ol' Rasha and Vincent's patented &quot;nights of liver destruction&quot; continue as he practices Friar Stealth in the local wine cellars.<br>
<br>
Finally, when a few others have had enough, and declare their fealty to Rasha or someone else and someone gets the majority, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>They</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> become the GL and Vincent gets demoted and sent to rehab for a few decades.<br>
<br>
Basically this gets away from the &quot;guild leader owns the guild&quot; to &quot;the members who make up the guild, own it&quot; which is how *I* believe it should be -- after all, the members make the reputation of the guild, why should they have to start over just to depose one power-hungry friar? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showUserPublicProfile?gid=norwoodblack>Norwood Black</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 613<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(6/10/03 12:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1668.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Horizons Beta</span><hr size=1> A site I did not know about until tonight.

Here's one you should enjoy (and other who may have been following HZ only more recently).  SeonSaint was a poster on the boards back in the day.  When Artifact was releasing the original concept art of each race, it was a huge exciting thing and the discussion and critiquing went on for days after each race art was posted.  Anyhow...this guy colored all the original race art and he still has it all posted on his site.  Loved this art and the concept of the races, not all of which will now appear in HZ.<br>

<br>
Info on combat (not as twitch-sensative as DAoC it seems) and class changing.<br>
<br>
Interesting exerpts:<br>
<br>
&quot;For instance, let's say you're facing a monster that can use Flurry of Blows. By selecting this ability, the monster can deal 25% more damage during its next attack. The game will alert you when a monster is about to use a special ability and allow you to select one or more special abilities of your own to either defend against or take advantage of a given monster's attack. In the case of Flurry of Blows, you may find yourself picking Cleave, which lets you deal 100% extra damage to an opponent using Flurry of Blows. Or you may choose to use Super Dodge which reduces the amount of damage you take from any attack. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Each of these abilities recycle and can be reused once they recharge. Most of them become available again within 45 seconds of being used. Some are shorter, requiring only 30 seconds to recharge, while others can require a full day or two of real time. Some, like the Super Blizzard, have such an awesome effect that they don't become available again until a week after they've been used.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Real-Time based abilities?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Now that's interesting.  A large part of me thinks that's pretty dang cool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Of course, if you set it off by accident, it could lead to a few curse-words, lol.  But it's a cool way to give way-cool abilities but not let them become too overpowering.<br>
<br>
&quot;At a high enough level warriors and healers can opt to shift to the hybrid paladin class. Each class loses some of its abilities in order to gain those of the other class. Fighters who become paladins lose Flurry of Blows but can now Lay On Hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
I wonder what type of LoH...the EQish or D&amp;Dish LoH...<br>
<br>
&quot;All this stuff can be posted to a public global sellers' board. The item resides in escrow essentially until a buyer decides to pay the item's cost in gold (or until the seller takes it down). These transactions can even occur while the selling party is offline. Log back on, and viola! You've got a little extra cash in your bank account. You can even set up large transactions or post from a stock that players can purchase piecemeal. Make ten adamantium longswords, say, and post them for 600 gold each. Players buy as many as they want and you get the cash. There's also a global buyers' board where adventurers can post requests and buying prices for particular items. <br>
<br>
This system seemed a bit impersonal to me until the team explained the justification. &quot;We don't want you standing in town shouting, 'I need new armor. I need new armor. I need new armor,'&quot; says the other Steve. And even through the relatively faceless buyer and seller boards, you'll likely find that you're purchasing items from or selling to a relatively small community. You can pull up info on the buyers or sellers who you deal with the most and even send them private commissions. The Steves explain they're &quot;using it as a type of matchmaking service so you guys can move in to a more personal kind of transaction&quot; which includes face-to-face bartering. (A bit of this is still subject to change according to beta feedback.) &quot;<br>
<br>
I kinda miss the Britania Bizarre from UO (though I don't miss ECmart from EQ) and shopping at different vendors all over -- kind of a nice way to spend an evening in UO was shopping for crap <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Still, I guess it has it's advantages, namely that you don't *have* to own a house to sell something (a la UO).<br>

I have read that article you posted.  The stuff on the buying/selling I thought was pretty cool.<br>
<br>
Oh by the way...Ulairi (longtime mod) of Horizons Vault is finishing up and has taken a job with Artifact.  I'm guessing he'll be one of if not the community rep.<br>

They've even added 2 &quot;shared&quot; bank slots so you can put something in one of those slots, log your trader character on at the bazaar and move the item from the bank into the seller's bag. Set the price, activate /trader and your guy stands there selling while you head off to work. The /trader thing turns you into a NPC vendor so people can buy your stuff.<br>
<br>
For shopping, they have a well done search engine with multiple ways to filter to find the item(s) that fit your needs. Once you find the item you can right click on the seller's name and it will guide you to them to make your purchase.<br>
<br>
From what I've seen of it it's easily the most well implemented feature of EQ and Horizons could do a lot worse for a market model.<br>
