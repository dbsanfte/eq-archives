<br>
Since i've grown tired of debating/reading about n00bs posting on archery, im gonna spoon feed 'em. <br>
<br>
First off, if you are a robed caster and you do not have a group, do not venture out into the frontier and hope to live for long. <br>
<br>
Secondly, whether you are a robed caster or not, it is important for you to have /sticky hotkeyed, the exception, sometimes, is casters with pets can go without it, as their pet is a literal homing missile. <br>
<br>
So you are out in the frontier, just you and your little group: <br>
<br>
Are you a robed caster? Make sure the group all knows what to do when an archer suddenly strikes, use/get blade turn spells on you if posssible; robed casters live and die by these. Do you have a pet? A pet caster is a great asset to taking out archers. as the pet, if charmed, will continue to hunt down the archer even after the owner has been killed, summoned pet users are not so lucky but combing an area with pet set to aggressive sometimes works out very well(sometimes this works sometimes it doesn't). <br>
<br>
When the arrow hits you specifically and you see your life drop from 500 to 100 in the blink of an eye, you need to be quick in hitting your /sticky hotkey as well as sprint. The group SHOULD know immediately whats going on and take chase in the direction you are headed, now the archer has about 3 seconds after that first shot before he will nail and most likely kill you with the second. If, like most archers tend to do, he hangs around to make sure you eat that second arrow and he gets his realm points you have about 13-15 seconds to locate him, which usually, is plenty of time. If you had blade turn up and you were targetted, you have a high probability of surviving the encounter. <br>
<br>
Are you a tank/melee? always keep attack mode up, you cant be crit shotted with it on, it also increases your shield block vs arrows if you are lucky enough to be using one. If someones life in your group suddenly drops like a rock for no reason ... look at them and watch where they are running to(see above paragraph for why). Do you see the person who was hit running toward a particular tree/rock?? if so, the archer is behind it and shooting through it. <br>
<br>
Rogues, well in a your general grouping situation as i have outlined above(not large RvR combat) there isnt much place for your skills. however, in large RVR conflicts you are key in taking out enemy archers... make sure you have a yell for help hotkeyed when you are sweeping if you are dealing with hunters or any high level archers.(if they are purple to you , you better call for help *right* when you spot them, *not* after you attack them as that sometimes scares them off. Nail them with the snare poison if its possible. Make note of where your forces are located and note any nearby patches of trees/rocks, these are areas you need to constantly sweep for archers. Always checking *inside* objects that are enterable, tree trunks and the like. <br>
<br>
When you give chase to an archer and you can see them and they &quot;suddenly&quot; vanish, you need to remember which way he was headed exactly when he &quot;poofed&quot; as archers want to get away from their current location ASAP if they are being chased. Make sure to check around and *inside* trees for them when they do this.. they move very very slow when hiding and they are spotted if you get within a certain range of their location... make sure you are spamming your &quot;closest enemy&quot; hot key when sweeping with a group, as when you uncover them they will still be in their &quot;greyed-out&quot; ghost from and somewhat hard to spot... very hard to spot if in the snowy midgard frontier, so make sure you spam that key... <br>
<br>
An archer is looking for two things when he his out hunting for enemies, either robed casters or people much lower in level than him... And, people, if a way purple archer smokes your entire group, you just have to live with it, as just about *any* way purple character to you can kill your entire group. if a purple archer attacks, he most likely thinks he can take your whole group. your healer/cleric will be target number one in this case. Important is to always be on your toes... if the archer is purple you might want to run away as best you can and get reinforcemtns, just don't come crying on these boards when your group gets smoked by a lone purple when you *should* have gone and got reinforcments instead.  <p><table border=1 bgcolor="#7CB07C">

Your intercept, protect and guard abilities don't work without it, from what I can tell. Also, if you are a shield user, have it up and equipped. If you are like me, not primarily shielded, I plan to have my shield equipped, with a hotkey for switching to my two hander when ready. <br>

Even in melee range the archers will usually just try to take off on you using their speed spell. Your best bet is to stun them right off the bat and then kill them quickly as possible. Always presume they are a scout for a larger force, not a lone sniper.<br>
<br>
Also, if you have a suprise encounter your best 'knee-jerk' reaction is not to try to run away, but instead turn into the enemy and attack full bore, giving it everything you have right from the start. If you are killed, chances are you were dead anyway regardless of if you tried to run or not. Charging them at first sight is really your best chance, particularly if they got the drop on you and have already launched a ranged attack. Just about the only exception would be if you have a larger force or a friendly keep very close at hand... then you might have a shot at making it on the run and either luring the enemy into the main force or escaping under cover of the NPC guards. This stands true for rezers, as well. Even if you manage to get away and your group is killed all you are is bait for a solo kill when you try to get close enough to rez. Better to attack and everyone /release and regroup at the castle if the enemy is too strong to kill. Charging a sprung ambush or a suprised enemy is a tried and true combat tactic.<br>

As of the next patch (crossing fingers it's in this week or early next), stealthed archers will now have a % chance to become visible when they nock an arrow (based on their stealth level), and WILL become visible when they fire an arrow. If it hits, they will then have to wait 10 seconds before restealthing. <br>
