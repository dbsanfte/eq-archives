<br>
Well, my beef is, there is no class in Albion that fits me really.. Scouts, Mercenary..  Well, while they have some of what I want, they just don't have everything I want<br>
<br>
I know, I'm probably asking a lot.<br>
<br>
I've looked over the info for Midguard's Hunter, and only one thing sticks out at me, the use of spears as primary weaponry.. I prefer a sword, but eh, whatever is whatever.  Due to the whole Spear thing, and the &quot;Flavor&quot; of the Midguard realm, they I guess are my second choice..<br>
<br>
First choice, I think is Hibernia.. The Ranger class looks to be fairly good.  While I don't get the logic of making ALL their self buffs only, nothing else, they do have tracking, and a few other skills I like.  Give Rangers a heal spell (May have, not sure) and even a very small pet, and I'm extremely happy.  Still, I dont' know enough about the classes yet to be sure.  The style of the realm however is rather nice, and I think goes well with my personality, It's looking to be a second choice too.<br>
<br>
Albion is dead last, for reasons stated above, but I could deal with it if I had to.. I'd never be truly happy with it however.. (Unless Mercs got Track, then maybe ^_^)<br>
<br>
Yep, no first choice in there.. I don't know enough just yet to make one.<br>

What was the question? <br>
<br>
Oh yea, realm....hmmmm...tough one there.<br>
<br>
This is probably the toughest question we will ask ourselves.  I of course wish to play a bard (big surprise huh! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ).  Well of all the bards of the various realms, probably the bard of Midgard is my favorite, with Albion coming in second, and finally Hibernia.  There are certainly other classes that interest me, but if I HAD to choose now, I would choose the realms of <br>
<br>
1.  Midgard (playing a viking is kind of appealing to me )<br>
2.  Albion<br>
3.  Hibernia<br>
<br>
I certainly don't have any live or die realm option although I probably prefer Hibernia the least by far.<br>

We would have to pick a server for each realm. <br>
<br>
How is this for a suggestion? First off, we pick a server for each realm. Just as a hypothetical, say for Albion we chose Guinevere (not the one I'd pick but I can't remember the other names). Then for Hibernia we pick another and for Midgard we pick another. <br>
<br>
Now, each week, we label that week as Albion Week... i.e. that's the week we focus 4 days out of 7 on our Albion Characters. 4 of the days you'd need to play in Albion on the chosen Albion server, the other 3 days, play what you want. Then the next week, we go to Hibernia, then to Midgard the week after. <br>
<br>
The problem with this that I see is that it would dilute our progress in the short run, but make us very knowledgeable of all the realms in the long run. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Now, in conjunction with this, I'd like to see 1 night a week be dedicated to &quot;Dagger Night.&quot; I.e. no matter what we do on &quot;Dagger Night&quot; whether it be just get together to drink and talk, or exp. hunt, or raid (as we get up there in levels), we do it with other Daggers. Kind of like mandatory events, but only on one night. To me, asking one night to be dedicated to your guild isn't a lot to ask, is it? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I could play something in any realm. A Celtic Champion/Hero, a Viking Berzerker, or a Highlander Armsman. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  See a pattern? <br>

Second I really like your idea Haemish that we pick one server for each realm.  Even though I haven’t played the beta <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , I really see a lot of us wanting to check out the other realms even for a short visit, so it would be nice if you start a character that you know the other Daggers would be starting their characters on that server too.  Personally I would like us to choose one Realm as our MAIN realm.  Meaning that is the realm that we will play the most.  I say this because some of us may only have time to concentrate on one character.  However I wouldn’t object to the plan you just suggested of rotating realms.  The only problem I see is if someone doesn’t have time to keep 3 characters up to a significant level to stay with the group, for the week that realm(s) are up, they would need to sit out.  Which may be acceptable I guess.   I really can find a class to play in any realm so I don’t care too much, if I HAD to pick, right now I would pick the Midgard Hunter.<br>

In regards to requiring attendance on a set night IF you are going to play and being on a certain realm...I have no problems with that whatsoever.  I certainly don't think one night a week is too much to ask if you are playing that night either.<br>

While I don't think Haemish's idea of Rotating realms is a bad one, I just couldn't go along with it.. . I make one character, and I stick with it.. I may make Alts, but I have a primary character and spend 90% of my time on that.<br>
<br>
It'll be hard enough keeping up with my EQ character and my DAoC character =P<br>
<br>
Right now, due to some outside urging (RL friend and her guild from Lanys Server) I'm leaning torwards the Morgana(I think) Server and Hibernia realm, as that's where they'll be.  To be totally honest, I may end up there as may Main no matter where the Daggers go, but I'll certainly have a Character that I'll dedicate to the Daggers. (Long as you don't choose a combo of say Midguard and Morgana server =P)<br>

<br>
The thing I like about DAoC that to me would make the Realm weeks/nights work is that each realm is truly a slightly (or really) different way to build characters. The classes are definitely differentiated between realms. <br>

I personally have no problem reserving the Morgana server for my Hibernian characters. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Now Dog I already know the answer on, does this mean the rest of you will be committing your time to DAoC more than EQ, just curious.  As I said to someone recently, the more over 50's that move on or play less affects the balance of us. <br>

Woot! I get a Woof!!! &lt;chuckle&gt;<br>
<br>
I do think we'll need to consider one realm/server our main if we're going to play the RvR part of the game... the realm points also add to the entire guild's status/abilities! Now that makes it difficult, because no matter what realm we pick as the main for the guild, it will be an alt realm for some of us. I don't see a way around that at all. Should we just take a vote? Have the officers vote? /boggle I dunno' how to go about it.. I just know it's a decision that needs making, is all.<br>

I like the idea of NOT choosing anything the first couple of weeks and just experimenting to see what everyone likes, and going in with the idea that what you are playing is temporary.  Sounds like a plan to me Drae.<br>
<br>
Cre, I addressed your concern in a rather long winded post in the general forum of the DAoC section.  To answer your question in a short form, I expect DAoC to take about 90% of my time initially...and if it plays as good as it looks make a 100% transition for me.

That gives you the option of playing your primary in whatever realm tickles you, and you can have your alts as part of the Dagger Division on whatever server is devoted to each realm.<br>
<br>
Pros:<br>
1. No one is playing a realm they don't want to.<br>
2. Regardless which realm you decide to play on a given day, you'll have Daggers there to play with.<br>
<br>
Cons:<br>
1. Our initial strength is diluted.<br>
2. With this degree of seperation, the &quot;Divisions&quot; may end up losing touch with each other over time.<br>
<br>
I dunno'.. just something to toss around, really. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Here is my suggestion.  Allow those with interest time to fool around with the game.  Say until first week of November (assuming those shipments can find their way to Canada and Europe).   Then we post a poll.  All three realms go up, secret vote and majority rules as main Realm that Silver Daggers moves to.<br>
<br>
Why do I say not the officers.  Only based on words of Haemish before that it is the member's guild and not the officer's or Haemish's guild.  That the vision is Haemish's and we support the vision.  (I am sure I will be corrected if I am wrong).<br>
<br>
To be so bold.   SD picks a realm and that is it.  If anything I have learned you can not make EVERYONE happy.  Some will follow with great joy, some will follow with reluctance and of these some will stay and some will go, and some will just not follow at all.<br>
<br>
I think it fine if as individuals we choose alts on other realms, but I do not think we should have a Realm of the week.  Unless you turn that around,  one nite a week we have an alt realm, just for the heck of it.  Like newbie land all over again.  This will help us with strategy and an understanding of the other realms for the later game.<br>

I have one more request but I can't put it in an open forum.<br>
