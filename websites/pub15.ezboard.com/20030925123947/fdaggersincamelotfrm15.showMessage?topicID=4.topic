He's currently level 20, has 4 Realm points (4 kills) and has not yet died in RvR. He's speced (specialized) in the Rejuvination skill, with Smiting and Enhancement about even and well below Rejuvination. To clarify, Rejuvination is healing, Smiting is direct damage and Enhancement is buffing. I know of no clerics who spec in Enhancement, but several have speced in Smiting with an eye toward soloing.<br>
<br>
Ablion Clerics start off as Acolytes, with the Cleric and Friar career paths open to them at level 5.<br>
<br>
As with all classes, how you &quot;spec&quot; your cleric will determine how you play him. If you spec in Smiting, you'll be primarily a damage caster with some healing abilities. If you spec in Rejuvination, you'll be a group healer with some buffing and damage casting abilities. (Yes, more than once I've been both the puller and the primary healer for the group.. it works fine!)<br>
<br>
You'll start with leather armor and small shields, but at level 10 you get studded and medium shields, followed by chain armor at level 20. You cannot wear plate armor and to my knowledge you get no combat styles. You use crushing weapons only (hammers, maces, etc) and cannot use 2-handed weapons. Your weapon skill goes up with levels and is not trainable.. you cannot spec in weapon use or shield use at all, only Rejuv, Enhance and Smite. Skill points are gained at a 1/1 rate throughout.<br>
<br>
The rest of this is based on a heavily Rejuvination speced Cleric.<br>
<br>
First off, yes, I can and do solo greens and blues with little difficulty. I cannot solo yellows as I'll die at least 75% of the time. My usual tactic is to stand at maximum range and cast on the target, then cast again immediately. I can land two before he gets to me. After that, it's melee time! I always make sure I have my Bless Weapon buff on before I cast on the target, and I'm fully buffed before I even start to hunt. (Buffs never wear off, Bless Weapon does wear off after a short time and must be renewed. It adds about 50% damage to each melee hit.) If I get adds, whether I run or not depends on whether I have Gift of Heavens available or not. GoH is the same as the EQ Paladin's LoH. If it's available, I will usually fight 2 blues. If not, I run. Sometimes when I take on 2 blues I do so without having to use GoH, but most times I do need it. Three greens or a blue and a green is no problem.. I typically kill the green first, then switch to the blue. For melee, I do the same damage per swing that a typical melee class of my level does.. I just don't swing nearly as often and cannot up my damage or affect the fight in any of the ways a melee class can using their Styles. I do have one area effect spell line that is combat castable, and I use that but it's currently on a 60 second recast timer. That is one of the many things being balanced still.<br>
<br>
For grouping, I'm the healer/rezer/buffer/damage caster/meleer, in that order of importance. Being speced in Rejuv, I can and have been an effective healer in groups where everyone is many levels higher than me. Healing agro is a problem in DAoC, just as in EQ. Most times, on multiple pulls, the critters (if their not dumb animals) will head straight to the healer. Failing that, they'll go for the bard! Once you're attacked, you're negated as a healer (you can't cast while being attacked in DAoC) so you just stand still, type &quot;/g On me&quot;, and take the hits until the melees pull the mobs off you. The melees have a number of tools they can use to accomplish this, but you have to stand still and let them work. For this reason, and a couple others, most groups will try to include a minimum of two healers in their numbers (I think a Cleric and a Friar is the best mix, but some prefer 2 Clerics and others 2 Friars).<br>
<br>
Multiple mob fights, and some single mob fights, will run you out of Power (mana) frequently. When that happens is when you have to use your battlefield awareness to decide what to do. You may need to sit down and try to gain enough power to throw one more heal. You may need to engage in melee combat and add the damage that will finish off the fight before anyone dies. You may need to run far away and stay alive to come back and rez your friends. The situation will be different each time, and you must decide instantly what to do. If you hesitate at all, you've lost your chance and you may as well just draw your hammer (or mace), join the fray and hope like hell you win. Just bear in mind that you are not a &quot;sub-par&quot; meleer in DAoC. You can mix it up with the best of them.. but that is all you can do. Unlike the melee classes, you cannot affect the fight in any other way except doing damage.<br>
<br>
One final note on healing. Don't try to be an EQ healer in DAoC.. you'll get people killed! Remember that everything in DAoC is faster paced. That means you start healing as soon as someone is taking damage and use your smaller heals if you can and still stay ahead. If you try to wait to conserve power, your group members will die while you flail around trying to catch up. Even if you use all your power every fight, the downtime is barely noticable and well worth avoiding the deaths! If you're lucky enough to have a bard, you can go from OOP to FP in about 45 seconds or so. Part of that time is needed by the melees to recover Endurance anyway.<br>
<br>
As to spells, here's a quick rundown:<br>
<br>
Heals - you get a ton of them! On my &quot;healing page&quot; of hotkeys, I currently have 4 individual heals of varying levels (60, 105, 175 and 250 hp's), Gift of Heavens (250 hp's), my second stage group heal (105 hp's), one slot for cure poison, and my Sprint ability for running away to live and rez. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Buffs - First off, you get a bucket load of buffs. What you don't get is enough concentration points to put your best buffs on a full group. Pick and choose based on a person's class and role within the group. I try to give everyone a hp buff and an ac buff. Archers get Dex/Quickness, melees get Quickness (if I can afford it), Armsmen and Mercs and Pallys get Strength. And for goodness sakes get a hp and ac buff at least on yourself! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Damage - The best thing about the Smite line is they take almost no power to cast. If you're in an area where your melees are only needing 1 or 2 heals per fight, tossing in a quick smite or two during the battle is in no way endangering your group. Also, the smite line has nowhere near the agro that the heals have, so you can cast them without fear of drawing agro from them. You also get stuns and messmerize in this line, but both are currently broken. Use the Armsmen to stun and the Sorcerers to mez instead.<br>
<br>
This was supposed to be short and turned out really long.. sorry about that! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

His wizard (7th, then 8th, then 9th level) and my armsman. We had 2 clerics (10th and 8th), an infiltrator, a friar, a paladin besides us. The mobs have a tendancy NOT to follow a caster that hits them from a distance then runs. If you run out of range, they go back to where they were, so pulling is harder. On some pulls, we chained pulled, with Ranndal (Dog's wizzie) starting the pull, then the 8th cleric smiting to keep the pull coming. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So clerics can be damage casters in DAoC. <br>
<br>
Also, as Dog said, combat is much faster-paced, and sitting back waiting for heals as a cleric doesn't work. And sometimes, running as the cleric so you can come back and do the rezzes IS a valid tactic. <br>

Really funny part... I thought I had deleted my wizard several days ago! Lol... glad I didn't though!<br>

Was good, I think, to learn that chain-pulling method. I think it'll come in handy in the future!<br>
