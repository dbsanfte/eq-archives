<br>
Newly resurrected and feeling the strong after-effects, the Daggers moved away from the tunnel entrance and over to the shade of the near-by trees.  Variana was shaking slightly as she always seemed to do when resurrected after a death to poison.  Dulcette and Hidien leaned against one another and he noticed that Hidien was also looked particularly distant.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I must have a conversation with the Guild of Shadows about the poisons Middy is using,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought to himself, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>They may have developed a more potent mix.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> -- though the kind of poison that could affect someone <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>after</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> they had been resurrected frightened Brother Vincent.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>so</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> glad you guys came along when you did,&quot; Norwood said, leaning against a small tree with his legs stretched out in front of him.<br>
<br>
Priestlyone, laying on his back in the grass staring up at the leaves on the trees, replied, &quot;I'm glad we could find you -- even if it wasn't my most spectacular entrance.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, don't knock it,&quot; Luric said, leaning against the same small tree as Norwood, &quot;It worked.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yep, sure did,&quot; Rhianidd reinforced.  &quot;I thought we were going to get over-run.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>were</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> over-run,&quot; Jamus said with tired grin and threw a twig at Rhianidd.<br>
<br>
Rhianidd tossed the twig back playfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, well...&quot; Priestlyone returned with a good-natured chuckle, &quot;Just don't tell my cousin, ok?  He already gives me enough grief about charging me rent on my name as it is.  If he hears about this, he'll want to charge me an additional fee for 'tarnishing his reputation.'&quot;<br>
<br>
The Daggers shared a chuckle over the now-familiar joke.  Priestly One, Dagger Cleric, and Priestlyone, Dagger Friar, were cousins but their branches of the family had lost touch over the years.  Their chance reunion over an unpaid bar tab had led to many jokes at their expense.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyone seen Stelar?&quot; Brother Vincent asked.  He was the only Dagger not sitting and resting.<br>
<br>
&quot;We didn't see her when we came through,&quot; Priestlyone said.<br>
<br>
&quot;She'd have released by now, Vince,&quot; Norwood said, &quot;It's been quite a while.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent and Devildog exchanged a brief glance that spoke volumes.  Each knew the other wouldn't leave until they were certain Stelar and Asycho had in truth released back to the Soulstone.<br>
<br>
&quot;At least they found the breach,&quot; Variana said.<br>
<br>
&quot;They did?&quot; Brother Vincent asked, instantly attentive.  He'd been the last to be resurrected and hadn't heard anything past with Brother DentAurhurDent had told him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, it was just beyond the place Asycho saved our butts,&quot; Norwood said.  &quot;Good thing we didn't go that direction too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No kidding,&quot; Rhianidd emphasized.  &quot;They ran into, what, five groups?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Seven from what I heard,&quot; Luric said.  &quot;About 20 Albs dropped before they pushed them back enough to rez, then the Middies pushed again.  Just like the ol' Emain Tango&quot;<br>
<br>
Captain Brodi and his Lieutenant came over to the knot of Daggers and Brother Vincent walked out a short distance to give them a little privacy.  &quot;We've got them in a stand off at the moment, at least the main body of them -- lucky for us they didn't have time to get down inside that labyrinth.  We'll hold them there until we're ready to seal the breach then we'll push through and seal the breach behind us.  I've sent word to Camelot for a follow-up force to explore these caverns in-depth to make sure we don't leave any Middies behind and make sure there are no other exits.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our original orders were to escort that caravan through to Myrddin and relieve the troops guarding Merlin's staff.  We're going to take a while sealing the breach and those supplies need to reach the Keep as soon as possible.  Could I prevail upon you to ensure their safe and timely arrival?&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent looked over his guildmates.  They looked a little tired from the long fight but none the worse for wear.  &quot;Certainly, Captain,&quot; he said, and they talked over the fine details of the delivery and route.  During the discussion, one of the guards came running up to the Captain, gesticulating urgently as he spoke.  After a few moments, both the guard and lieutenant ran off toward the enormous body of people waiting just outside the entrance.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wonder what that was all about,&quot; Norwood said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Middies probably got reinforcements,&quot; Hidien replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;They certainly looked upset,&quot; Rhianidd observed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Holy crap,&quot; Priestlyone said with a mixture of excitement and dread, &quot;That's gonna hurt.&quot;<br>
<br>
Captain Brodi looked pained.  It was evident he was having to re-assess his plans and tactics.  He spoke urgently and pointedly to Brother Vincent, who appeared to protest what the Captain was telling him.  In the end, Brother Vincent made a pressed-palm gesture of surrender to Captain Brodi and they parted.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent was coming back over to the Daggers when they saw a rider leading a riderless horse in their direction.<br>
<br>
&quot;DD, go see to the horses please,&quot; Brother Vincent said.  He continued as Devildog went to see what this horse business was all about.  &quot;I was hoping we'd be able to head back to the Abby at this point but you know how it goes.  They were supposed to be taking that caravan,&quot; he pointed as he spoke to the several wagons of supplies standing off a quarter-mile from them, &quot;out to resupply Myrddin but got side-tracked out our direction to deal with this mess by Golvan's message.  They're going to be a while dealing with the breach and those supplies are needed quickly as the harassment of the last three resupply runs on top of the last relic raid by Hibby has depleted their supplies to a dangerous level.  You're going to escort them out.&quot;  He got some unhappy looks from Luric, Rhianidd, and Norwood who didn't relish the idea of going back into the cold so soon.<br>
<br>
&quot;And to add insult to injury,&quot; Brother Vincent continued, &quot;The middies got reinforced.  Brodi thinks the Middies will scatter when they finally push through so he's commandeered the minstrels for tactical speed, which that means some dispatches and communiques that need to be delivered, so DD and I are going to handle that.  Brodi is concerned about the security of the dispatches and was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>adamant</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that I take personal responsibility for them and keep someone as a personal guard.  That's what those horses are all about since I need Dulce and Var running orbit around the caravan.<br>
<br>
&quot;By the time you get that caravan delivered and return, DD and I should be finished with the outbound deliveries and on our way to meet you back at the Abby -- we'll dump the incoming ones on the regular dispatch rider there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Devildog had returned with the horses and a satchel during Brother Vincent's instructions and sat with the rest of the Daggers.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Luric,&quot; Brother Vincent said, &quot;You have tactical responsibility.  Get those supplies delivered and get back to the Abby.  Unless there's a relic defense in progress, I don't give a damn what they ask you to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Luric nodded curtly in understanding.  All the Daggers could see something was bothering Brother Vincent from his direct tone and manner -- he rarely used a command voice, one that brokered no questions or suggestions.  What truly made them feel the gravity of the situation was Brother Vincent's direction to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> provide any assistance -- save that of relic defense -- and return to the Abby.  Something must be imperative for Brother Vincent to issue an order such as that -- and there was no question that it was an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>order</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Captain Brodi came back to see Brother Vincent about some other arrangements and the two walked off toward Brodi's other officers who were going over a map of the area.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well that was surreal,&quot; Luric said as Brother Vincent exited ear shot.<br>
<br>
&quot;No kidding.&quot; Norwood added.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell is up with Vince?&quot; Hidien asked, plainly upset at Brother Vincent's tone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Priestlyone said, &quot;That was pretty <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>un-</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->Vince-like.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Vince-like or not, when's the last time you heard him given an order?&quot; Namira asked with a steely inflection that let those around her know she was more than slightly miffed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hrm.  I can't remember,&quot; Luric replied, &quot;Hell of a long time, I guess.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Namira continued in a clipped voice as she stood and deftly re-seated her weapons, &quot;In that case, if Vince sees fit to throw his weight around <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> often, I think I can follow his orders without complaint.&quot;  She began a brisk and purposeful walk to the supply caravan.  She did not look back.<br>
<br>
Dulcette, bristling visibly in disagreement with Brother Vincent's instructions, said nothing.  Her relationship with Brother Vincent was more-often-than-not one of disagreement...yet somehow a friendship and mutual respect had developed between them that had weathered many a violent storm and yet remained.  Namira was right; if Brother Vincent felt it necessary to give an order -- quite uncharacteristic for him -- then the least she could do would be follow it without adding Brother Vincent's troubles.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But that doesn't mean I'm not going to bring it up later</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, she thought as she began to gather up her instruments (and Hidien).<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm stunned,&quot; Hidien whispered to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?  That I kept my trap shut?&quot; she whispered in reply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Hidien whispered back.<br>
<br>
Dulcette shrugged.  &quot;Nami's right,&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;But don't you think it's odd?&quot; Hidien asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Odd that I don't agree with him?  or odd that he gave an order?&quot; she whispered in answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd get worried for the universe if you ever <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>did</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> agree.  I mean him giving an order like that,&quot; Hidien whispered in clarification.<br>
<br>
&quot;Something's wrong, Hon,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I don't know what it is that's got Vince acting like that...but it's scaring me a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Same here,&quot; Hidien replied.  &quot;Ya know, I don't even think Vince realizes he was giving orders.&quot;<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Brother Jamus hadn't moved out to the supply caravan with the others.  He'd over-heard Dulcette and Hidien's conversation and had to agree with Hidien's assessment:  Brother Vincent hadn't even realized he was giving orders, he simply gave them and never considered they wouldn't be carried out precisely.  That spoke well of his trust for his guildmates...but...<br>
<br>
Brother Jamus stood next to Brother Vincent for a few moments as if they were both standing alone, looking at the same distant object.  He spoke quietly without turning, &quot;So it's worse than I suspected.  What can I do?&quot;  <br>
<br>
Brother Vincent took almost a minute before he replied.  &quot;The avalanche has already begun,&quot; he said in a voice just above a whisper, &quot;It is too late for the pebbles to vote.&quot;  **<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Staring after them, Brother Vincent could almost hear Luric singing one of his 'Dagger Shanties' as they started up with the caravan.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">What do you do with a drunken Dagger?<br>

Shave his belly with a rusty razor...</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Hearing Devildog approach brought him out of his reverie.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate this job,&quot; Brother Vincent said as he watched his fellow Daggers ride out of sight with the supply caravan.<br>
<br>
&quot;Which one,&quot; Devildog asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;All of 'em,&quot; came Brother Vincent's distant reply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well that's what you get for being guild leader,&quot; Devildog said with ironic humor in his voice that was completely lost on Brother Vincent.<br>
<br>
&quot;A job <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> talked me into, as I recall,&quot; Brother Vincent shot back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, you're an adult,&quot; Devildog retorted matter-of-factly.  &quot;Nobody twisted your arm.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent let out a heavy sigh.  &quot;If I'd known...&quot; he said distantly before Devildog cut him off sharply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't play naive,&quot; Devildog said.  &quot;You knew what you were getting into.  And you know it was the right thing to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There's more to it than just that, DD,&quot; Brother Vincent said, unperturbed by the tone Devildog had taken with him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You mean what the Crown has you doing?&quot; Devildog asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;So many secrets, DD...&quot; Brother Vincent whispered as if lost in thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're trusted with secrets for just that reason, Vince,&quot; Devildog said.  &quot;Because you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>can</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be trusted.  <br>
<br>
Brother Vincent merely grunted in dismissal.<br>
<br>
Devildog continued, &quot;Well you name me someone else in the realm who has the Church's ear, the Crowns ear, and is warmly welcomed at Lethantis.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent's body tensed just a microsecond before he could control it, giving himself away.  <br>
<br>
Devildog chuckled at Brother Vincent's discomfort.  &quot;I may be an old tank,&quot; he said mirthfully, &quot;but I'm not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>blind</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  When a minstrel starts grousing about how some brit mage with a rune-carved staff arrives -- on a horse with a clergy's riding gear, no less -- and gets the greeted warmly by the elder mages when he's carrying a dispatch from the Crown and can't find anyone high enough to deliver it too...even I can put <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> together, Vince.&quot;  Devildog's smile was evident in his tone.  &quot;They aren't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> warmly welcoming to their own kind, let alone someone from the Church.  That speaks of a lot of trust.  And where trust is, secrets follow.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>such</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> secrets...&quot; Brother Vincent replied, looking at Devildog for the first time.  &quot;With a well placed phrase I could bring down all of Albion in such a fire that not even ashes would remain.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, well you just keep 'em to yourself, bub,&quot; Devildog said.  &quot;This thing with Tz...&quot; Devildog's voice choked with emotion for a brief moment before he continued, &quot;It scares the living hell out of me, Vince.  And I know...&quot; said then paused a moment to collect his words.  &quot;You're worried we'll find Stelar in there, and so am I -- I'm terrified by it.  But, it's not affecting you deeply, Vince.  That means you've got bigger, more bloodcurdling things on your mind.  And that puts me near to trembling.&quot;  Devildog paused before he continued.  &quot;Vince, we've been friends since before either of us picked up a weapon for Camelot and I'll stick by you through anything.  But secrets...that's your department.  The less I know, the happier I'll be.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent chuckled almost involuntarily and a grin touched his face.  &quot;You never did go in for the cloak-and-dagger routine, did you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hell</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> no!,&quot; Devildog responded emphatically.  &quot;I like my enemies where they belong:  straight in front of me and impaled on my sword.  I'll leave all the 'friends close and enemies closer' intrigue to you,&quot; he chuckled.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent sighed deeply and sat heavily by the tree the horses were tied to.  He leaned his head back into the tree and stared upward.  Devildog noted how very tired Brother Vincent looked.<br>
<br>
&quot;When's the last time you slept, Vince?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm....&quot; Brother Vincent mused, &quot;I can't remember.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well now's as good a time as any,&quot; Devildog prodded.  &quot;They'll be a while yet getting ready to push the Middies out.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish I could, DD,&quot; Brother Vincent said tiredly.  &quot;Too much running through my head just now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Devildog fished around his pack and threw a package at Brother Vincent.  &quot;Well at least eat something then.  I don't want to have to carry your skinny ass out of those caves because you fainted from hunger,&quot; Devildog said in mock harshness.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent wasn't hungry in the least but ate the dried rations anyway, knowing it would ease Devildog's mind a bit.  And, as he downed some of the dried tid-bits, he had to admit he did feel a bit better.  He glanced over at Devildog, now propped against a tree, helmet off and snoring.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ya know, DD,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Brother Vincent thought to himself, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I hate putting you through this but I'm <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>damn</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> glad you're here</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Theirs was a simple friendship, utterly uncomplicated by anything.  ...except perhaps Devildog's ability to be asleep, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anywhere</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, in under three seconds.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Lucky bastard.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
-------<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on, DD,&quot; Brother Vincent said, trying to rouse Devildog.  &quot;Wake up, you tin-plated boat anchor.&quot;<br>
<br>
Devildog began to stir, though with little enthusiasm.  <br>
<br>
The main force of Albion was now rushing, two-by-two into the tunnel.  The Push was on.  It was time for them to set about their reluctant duty.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
<br>
For hours they wandered through the tunnels, trying to make sure of each branch near the area they'd been attacked.  It was a maze of half-hidden side tunnels and it was hard to tell where someone might have run.  They'd nearly exhausted any realistic possibility and were privately hoping that their search would end fruit-less and happy.<br>
<br>
&quot;DD,&quot; Brother Vincent said in a voice void of energy, &quot;Over here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Devildog walked over, almost unwilling to see what he knew he would see.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent went down on one knee and brushed the hair away from Stelar's face.  She lay on her side just above a pool of blood on the gently sloping stone floor; she had a deep gashes over her renal arteries with the tell-tale gentle hint of poison in the air.  The blood around the wounds had been toughly coagulated over time by the venom.<br>
<br>
As he came around a shallow bend in the tunnel, Devildog saw Brother Vincent examining Stelar.  Though he knew what he would see, it hit him like a full-on rush of trolls at skald-speed.  He stopped a few paces away, felt tears begin to well up in his eyes.  He took off his helmet and hooked it under his left arm as he looked upon his fallen guildmate.  Stoic as he was, he couldn't hold back tears of seeing yet another friend lying in the dirt, truly dead.  He wondered how Brother Vincent could be so calm.<br>
<br>
Just then he saw a shift of shadow and was about to cry out to alert Brother Vincent but before he could utter a sound, the body of the norse shadowblade was battered between the opposing wall of the narrow tunnel and Brother Vincent's blurred staff.  In a move so quick Devildog didn't even register his movement, Brother Vincent collected his staff, turned, and thrust it directly into the solar plexus of the shadowblade with the force to lift the norseman off the ground and slam him violently into the wall.  An anguished cry came from the norse and Devildog heard the crack and snap of bones.<br>
<br>
The tunnel was lit for a moment as Brother Vincent let loose his regenerative magic and angelic haste.  Liquid rage boiling over, Brother Vincent attacked again and again, and again, so quickly that there was no distinction between the end of one attack and the beginning of another.  The norseman was slammed again and again into the tunnel wall by Brother Vincent's vicious attack.  Devildog was stunned by the power of Brother Vincent's onslaught, he'd never seen a friar -- or <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for that matter -- attack with such force or such terrifying speed; the body of the norseman was never able to crumble to the ground, being slammed again and again by powerful blows that kept it aloft.<br>
<br>
Even after it was evident that the norse was quite dead, Brother Vincent's attack had lost none of it's blind fury.  The flesh and bone were broken, horridly battered and pulping, splashing blood with every hit.  Brother Vincent began to cry out in anguish louder and louder with successive hits.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vincent,&quot; Devildog said, finally coming to himself.  Brother Vincent didn't respond.  &quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>VINCENT!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot; he shouted, but there was no response from the friar.  Nothing penetrated the friar's singular focus.<br>
<br>
Devildog moved to intervene physically with Brother Vincent but a friar going full bore, spinning and twirling his staff, was a dangerous creature to approach.  Brother Vincent was inflicting a devastating barrage the likes of which Devildog had never seen.  There was the loud and constant thrum of a staff cutting the air, punctuated only by wet thumps as it impacted the shadowblade's carcass.  <br>
<br>
Devildog put all his weight behind his shield and drove at Brother Vincent in an effort to stop his staff and get his attention.  He was stunned by the violence and strength of the blow that hit his shield, sending him stumbling backwards.  Brother Vincent never even noticed.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent hit the carcass again, crying out with the effort.  The abused neck vertebrae snapped and the head zinged down the tunnel away from Devildog.  Devildog used that brief moment move inside Brother Vincent's defenses and restrain him -- though it was difficult.  <br>
<br>
After some moments of struggle, Brother Vincent seemed to become aware of Devildog and ceased his battle.  Devildog led Brother Vincent, still shaking uncontrollably with rage, away from the devastated corpse.<br>
<br>
He sat him down near Stelar and wondered how someone who was so calm and in control only a short while ago could now be sitting against that wall, covered in blood and...other material, shaking with a rage so fierce he was only barely aware of his surroundings.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I guess everyone has their limits,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Devildog thought to himself.  Presently he saw signs that Brother Vincent's rage was dissipating.  His shaking was diminished and his breathing was starting to normalize.<br>
<br>
Presently Brother Vincent's hands relaxed around his staff form their white-knuckled grip, then they tightened and his face screwed up in an expression of disgust.  He hurled his blood-soaked staff, an item he loved dearly was rarely without, violently up the tunnel as if trying to throw it away forever.<br>
<br>
Devildog sitting some feet away heard muffled sobs as Brother Vincent held his hands covering his face.  He didn't know what to say to Brother Vincent; he was a not man of eloquent words and he was comfortable with that -- yet part of him now yearned for the right words, though none would come.  So he let the flood empty out of Brother Vincent, waiting for calmer waters before he tried to wade in.<br>
<br>
He pondered his guild leader, not for the first time.  He knew Brother Vincent had to hold some things back, just by virtue of his position, but what he had seen today... It shook him deeply.  He'd always known Brother Vincent to be a fair man and, in his opinion, a good guild leader who always tried to set a good example -- even if he didn't cut himself any slack when he should.  He also knew that Brother Vincent had more than just his guildmates relying on him -- the needs of the realm had put a heavy burden on Brother Vincent as well -- and Devildog had no doubt that Brother Vincent took those duties no less to heart than his duty to his guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>We put so much faith in them that we sometimes forget they are human.  And in responding to what is required of them...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought to himself as he listened to Brother Vincent's quiet sobs, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>sometimes they forget it too.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
&quot;The supplies were delivered then?&quot; the guard at Snowdonia Fortress asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Norwood answered.  &quot;Most boring trip to see the relic I think I've ever had.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, that's all of 'em for the guards here,&quot; Variana said, as she hefted the courier's pouch on her shoulder.  &quot;We're good to go.  I can hand these off at the Abby.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm gonna tell on you, Luric,&quot; Hidien teased.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, you heard what Vince said, Luric,&quot; Namira added.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh please,&quot; Luric said in his defense, &quot;It's just some letters and we were going here anyway.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tsk, tsk,&quot; Dulcette egged.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
&quot;RASHA!&quot; Asycho cheered as he saw his friend at the bar.  &quot;Pour me a tall one,&quot; Asycho said to the bar tender, and gestured to Rasha, &quot;She's payin'.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Asycho, what the hell are you doing here?&quot; Rasha asked, more than a little surprised.<br>
<br>
&quot;We ran into some Middies that breached the realm-wall,&quot; he said between gulps of ale.  &quot;I, in my usual heroic style, valiantly leapt to my guildmates's defense and mezed a whored of those Midgardian Malcontents, thus saving my guildmates a most horrible fate!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you're out to celebrate?&quot; Rasha asked with a grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, not at all,&quot; Asycho said with a flourish.  &quot;Such grand deeds shouldn't be celebrated with this swill.  No, my dear lady, this is how one recuperates from having four trolls and a kobold beat the crap out of you after you mezed their buddies.&quot;  He took another long draught and continued, &quot;Then sit on your head while your mez wears off.  I tell ya, there's nothing like a good troll fart.  It was killing the lichen on the cavern walls.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rasha couldn't help but laugh at Asycho's rendition.  It was worth the few coins his ale cost just to see an old friend again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, Asycho!&quot; Cewen said, rounding the corner.  &quot;We're ready to go when you are, Rasha.&quot;<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
The two horses walked as solemnly as their riders' moods.  It was some time before Brother Vincent had recovered enough help Devildog with Stelar's corpse.  They wrapped it in a large cloth Devildog had secured and placed it over the back of Vincent's horse behind the saddle.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent had cleaned himself up somewhat.  He used the remains of a water-skin to clean his face and douse his robes but they were still blood-soaked and would need to be thoroughly cleaned at some point.  He spared little time to think on this however...his mind was occupied with other less mundane thoughts.<br>
<br>
Devildog, after some hours, broke the silence.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not your fault, Vince,&quot; he said plainly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I should have said something before,&quot; Brother Vincent lamented.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what would that have done?&quot; Devildog asked matter-of-factly.  &quot;Just made everyone as nervous as you and I have been and wouldn't have changed a damn thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't have had to lie to them about some damn mail delivery,&quot; Brother Vincent spat back.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you think this is?&quot; Devildog asked as he held up the mail pouch full of dispatches.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know what I mean, DD,&quot; Brother Vincent growled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; Devildog riposted, &quot;You're feeling sorry for yourself and guilty because of what you did to that norse.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent was silent for a while, then replied in a voice touched with remorse and fear, &quot;You don't know... You don't realize what I really did, DD.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Realize it?&quot; Devildog replied, &quot;It'd be hard <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to, being that you're still wearing part of the guy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent's patience evaporated.  &quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I lost <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>control</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, DD!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, Brother Vincent spat vengefully, &quot;Don't you know what that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>means</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I sure as hell do,&quot; Devildog answered in a strong but measured voice.  &quot;It means you're human like the rest of us; just deal with it, Vince.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent rebelled against the notion inside.  He couldn't allow himself to take the easy route.  There were things he must do, whether they were impossible or not.<br>
<br>
Their horses walked on as they rode in silence for some time.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I wonder if Vince went farther over the edge than I think,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Devildog wondered.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I've never seen anyone look so drained and withered in the soul.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;I envy you, DD,&quot; Brother Vincent said, finally breaking the silence.  &quot;Your world is straight forward, you always know where the enemy is, always know an honest way to kill em.  It's not like that in the world thrust upon me.  I feel like Ladon, with each of my hundred heads saying a different lie.  I think it's time to eat a golden apple for myself.  Want to help me slay a dragon, DD?&quot;  With that, Brother Vincent spurred his horse to a faster speed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Who the hell is Ladon?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Devildog asked himself, trying to figure out Brother Vincent.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And why's he want to go on a Dragon raid with all this...this stuff going on?  Maybe he <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>has</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> lost it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Devildog spurred his horse to catch up with Brother Vincent's and a scarier thought came to mind.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Or maybe he <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>found</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

<br>
** The original lines:<br>
<br>
He (Jamus) spoke quietly without turning, &quot;So it's worse than I suspected.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent took almost a minute before he replied. <br>
<br>
- - -<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are fools and scoundrels at the helm, no amount of reason will alter your course.&quot;  Every time I read it, I felt it gave too much away in some areas and set up implications that weren't intended in others.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're doomed.&quot;  I like the brief finality and despair of it...but I just couldn't help laughing every time I re-read it.  Anyone who's watched the original Lost in Space series and remembers Dr Smith saying &quot;We're Doomed!&quot; will understand why kept cracking up.  I had to lose it.<br>
<br>
&quot;The avalanche has already begun.  It is too late for the pebbles to vote.&quot;  I love this line, even though it's a blatant steal from J.M.Strazynski.  Just didn't fit though.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ladon guards the garden with the golden apple tree...but what of the apples that spill from the cart?&quot;  I really love this line since it seems to reference what happens at the end of the section.  Sadly it never really fit well with anything Jamus would say and always felt contrived and tieing in the Ladon reference too early.<br>
<br>
After fretting over it all afternoon, I was trolling through the msg boards and saw bunch of posts from Jamus about helping high 40s get to 50, helping Tre, etc.  It finally occurred to me that he'd ask if he could help no matter what or how bad or how hopeless the problem.  The 'avalanche' line just fit too well at that point and I went with it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=24.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.silverdaggers.net/img/add.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.threadControl?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub15.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="daggersincamelotfrm1">DAoC General<option value="daggersincamelotfrm2">Events<option value="daggersincamelotfrm3">In Game Quests<option value="daggersincamelotfrm4">Trade Skills<option value="daggersincamelotfrm5">Treasury<option value="daggersincamelotfrm10">Around the Campfire<option value="daggersincamelotfrm12">Hibernia Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm14">Midgard Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm15">Albion Class Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm16">Albion Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm17">Game Mechanic Discussions<option value="daggersincamelotfrm18">Officers<option value="daggersincamelotfrm19">Sig Test Site<option value="daggersincamelotfrm21">Application Review<option value="daggersincamelotfrm22">Sponsorship<option value="daggersincamelotfrm23">Announcements<option value="daggersincamelotfrm27">War Room<option value="daggersincamelotfrm28">Policy Discussions<option value="daggersincamelotfrm29">RvR Council<option value="daggersincamelotfrm35">Wine Cellar<option value="daggersincamelotfrm36">Adventuring in the Shrouded Isles</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E6E8fA>- </font><a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot>Daggers in Camelot</a><font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10>Around the Campfire</a> <font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net">Silver Daggers Homepage</a><font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
