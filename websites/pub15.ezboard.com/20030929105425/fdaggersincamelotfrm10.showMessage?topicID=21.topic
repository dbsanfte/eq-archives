<br>
werzat was a character built for D&amp;D when going in cold on a campaign (had no idea what it was about). I decided on class (ranger) and the as-yet-unnamed-character said &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylvan</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Ranger&quot; and I thought to myself, &quot;a wood elf ranger? well that could be...&quot; then heard a testy voice say, &quot;Sylvan!&quot;  Well, I knew I had a fun character rolling around in my head so the unnamed <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sylvan</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Ranger was born and I needed some kind of backstory. I tried but couldn't figure out much about him so I turned it over to him to write -- bugger still wouldn't tell me his name either!  I literally didn't know the name till I typed it as the very last word of the story.<br>
<br>
So, what you see below is what came out (9255 words of it) as the backstory. (I've more written and a bunch not written but I thought it would be interesting to show my guildmates where and WHY I sported the name &quot;werzat&quot; (in lower case!) in EQ)<br>
<br>
Please note that I had to stop writing this several times because parts of it...just gave me the creeps. Still does when I re-read it.<br>

Ah...where to begin. M'Rena says I should write my thoughts down so that when I'm older I can pass them down when the free spirit stirs my legs and my heart feels the Calling. I think it's a load of Orc droppings but...it's cold tonight and there's a full moon and I've nothing better to do stuck up in this mossy tree -- blasted humans and their petty wars. Besides, it'll make M'Rena happy...and she has always been kind to me -- even when no one else would.<br>
<br>
I suppose I'm a sad excuse for a Sylvan but it isn't as if life has been kind to me. Life was a grand thing before my beautiful mother, with her quick-as-lightning smile and lovely songs sung to her little Elf when he was scared of the lightning, became involved with that...human. Buzek his name was. I was too young to remember or understand much -- and over the years I think I may have forgotten much of that time...for which I'm grateful -- but I know what my mother's songs were less vibrant, her smile grew...smaller and the previously ubiquitous gleam in her eye visited less and less till it was a stranger, all but forgotten. I remember she bore him two half-breeds, Marysa and Cyrica and I never liked them. Ever. I still don't know why...they just smelled...well, wrong. I wasn't jealous and I wanted so much to make my mother proud of how I helped her with them -- she was always tired then and I never remember her smiling after Cyrica was birthed -- though somehow I don't think she even noticed. It was a hard time and a lonely one...and I was still very young. Far too young to understand...well, any of it.<br>
<br>
After Marysa was birthed but before Cyrica, back when a quick tilt of phrase could bring an almost startled laugh from my beautiful mother, I asked her about my father -- I'd never known him, you see. In earlier times, my mother would tell me tidbits about him but never very much. I knew he loved me (somehow I remembered that without having to be told) and that he was a respected man in our village but that was all she ever really told me. On this meager evening, though, with a light and much needed rain lightly dancing on the roof of the immobile hovel, she told me...more...much more. I'll spare you (and my hand) the many details of my father and give you broad strokes on the canvas in a moment. What seared those precious moments and hours in my mind was the radical change that came over my mother. She slowly, over the course of the first half-hour, began to be the delightful, happy, spirited mother I remembered from my earliest recollections. Her words were strong, her manner confident, her laughter vibrant, and my entire body and soul embraced each and every single nuance...like a deep breath before one tries to race to the bottom of the stream for the pretty stones that reside there. <br>
<br>
Of my father... He was a respected man in our village. He was a good and kind Elf, and wiser than most, I'm told. By his presence alone, many battles were averted, horrific creatures would stop their slaughter and be at peace. As a matter of honor, to help a friend (a Dwarf, no less!), he left on a quest to a far away land. This was when I learned that my father was still alive until only a few short years before -- I had always thought he died when I was very, very young or before I was born...somehow the loss seemed greater now...I was so close! Their adventure was long and many great deeds were done (I later confirmed this with that old halfling hag Tamalu...and found out something more: my father was a Ranger! ...yet my mother never told me this...why?). Many of the Elven cities and outlying villages, hamlets, and townships -- even our Sylvan communities -- were being constantly harassed by all manner of nasty, smelly, unpleasant creatures (and I do remember a time when the village alarms sounded often and our encampment moved frequently). My father and that Dwarf friend of his -- I think Malishn was his name...I can't remember correctly, it's been a long time, my ears were young then, and their names are indeed odd -- had come back to find the source of these attacks. (My mother went in to great detail of these times but I shall spare you, those details have deep meaning only to me these days) The Dwarf, Malishn (or Melhasken as Tamalu swears or whatever that creepy Dwarf calls himself), found incontrovertible evidence that one of the great war leaders of the humans was behind the attacks and in league with the leader of the nearby High Elves and...our own village elder -- corrupted by evil or by coins and sweet baubles like the humans are so prone to. There was no way for my father to reach the elder after news from this Dwarf (whom rumor said did the bidding of the Drow) touched the ears of the Sylvan population, not even to disprove it. The High Elves were no less willingly deaf and the Humans...well who cares what those fruit-fly Humans think or say?<br>
<br>
What was known was that a few years previous (perhaps 60-70), we were allied with the High Elves to defeat a force of undead that was plaguing both the High and Sylvan Elves. Caught alone with a small force against an overwhelming army, our elder and his High Elf companion, were doomed -- and they knew it. For no reason they could fathom, a human force descended in a fool-hearty charge upon the undead closing in on the small Elven group. At great cost and against all odds, the undead were turned back. Upon meeting the arguably insane human who led the charge, so great was the relief in the Elves minds of their brightening prospects of reaching Arvanaith, even our venerable elder was almost civil to the outsider. Thereafter, over the next thirty years or so, they would fight for common causes as comrades in arms, the three of them.<br>
<br>
However, that our elder would be party to such treachery? Such thoughts were not even worth consideration, let alone when uttered from the lips of Dwarf -- would YOU believe a Dwarf (a Dwarf!) who said he had information calling into question the history and motives of one of your most venerable and distinguished leaders? Yet, due to long friendship, my father did. But he was convinced that our elder, even if party to such action, would not be its center, nor the High Elf, for the origin of such plots are not in their nature. However, Humans were not beyond such methods -- they revel in them, according to some tales. Yet more troubling, we Wood Elves bore the brunt of some of the most fierce attacks -- anyone who knows the Sylvans and our encampments knows we live in harmony with the land and the land envelops us and hides us from outsiders, we are part of the land, part of nature, and do not advertise our location. How were the attacks so pointed, so precise? Troubling indeed to the minds of our people.<br>
<br>
In all cycles in nature, there is one critical link that, if broken, will cause the entire cycle to collapse. In this case, it was the human and there was no alternative, in my father's view, than to kill him, for the greater good of us all. <br>
<br>
I've often pondered this decision of my father's...and I've talked deeply with M'Yan (you probably won't recognize that name but no matter) about it's implications. A hard decision; a crushing decision. My father took his longbow and sat nestled in the dense foliage of an aging Oak tree and waited for his prey, the person responsible for the attacks on our people, responsible for their deaths. My father's quarry was traveling to meet with his old comrade, now a leader of the High Elves, but traveling under heavy guard so my father, ever wise, waited high in that aged but lively Oak tree for the fateful greeting that would take place on the ground.<br>
<br>
When the time game, the Humans had just been received by the High Elves and were about to ascend high into the trees. My father stood and drew his mighty Elven bow, aiming directly at the accused (and well proven, if you believe the evidence) instigator of the Elves' current troubles and said the last words any Elf or Human of the time (save my beautiful mother) would ever let enter their ears. He said in a loud voice: &quot;For those you have wronged, to avenge their deaths and torment, to set right and balance the scales, I take your life to appease the past and protect the future.&quot; Then he let the arrow fly.<br>
<br>
With a sickening &quot;thunk!&quot; it buried itself mortally in the chest...of the human's wife who stood at his side. So it is said (by that hag Tamalu, who swears to be witness to it all, and a few others I've managed to coax into speaking of those bleak times) my father looked neither shocked nor horrified but rather as if this job, this nasty business, were &quot;done, finally, and good riddance to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Word circulated...and quickly came to our village.<br>
<br>
I think I remember this day, there was a lot of yelling outside our home and my mother was gone for two whole weeks after it. It was a hot, hot day with blistering sun high in the cloud-less sky. It hadn't rained for some time and the air was parched. Even the wind had found a nice, cool place to retire for the day, for it was certainly no where to be found to provide the much needed refreshment of a breeze to cool the skin. I had been playing children's games and singing with other Elves my age earlier in the morning but the beating sun forced us to eventually relinquish our play area and submit to the body's demands for sweet fruit juices and shade. I had never thought much of it -- a good son believes his mother's explanations, after all -- until I had thought through this a great many times in my later ordeal. That was when the sadness began.<br>
<br>
What happened next...is a matter of history and I shan't repeat it here -- as if I could do such happenings justice. But I'll give you its ending. My father was stripped of his Ranger status, stripped of all status as a matter of fact, and at the hands of the Humans, tied to a leafless tree and allowed to slowly die of exposure to the blistering sun, frigid nights of wind, and the loathing of the Elven and Human populations. <br>
<br>
(I was able to study of this period a few years ago, thanks to the gracious spirit of M'Yan. Though there were no records readily available, M'Yan was able to acquire a small but detailed collection of documents of the time. It seems no Elf noticed that the attacks upon our cities, towns, villages, and hamlets never occurred again -- at least not on any scale -- after the day my father let fly his arrow. In sadness and grief, the Human's weathered war leader stepped down from his post, gave away his posession, took his own life. History may have proven my father right but cool analysis of history is no match for boiling -- and un-Elf-like -- hatred. If fact, while there were increased tensions between Elves and Humans for a brief period, there were no pogroms, no wars, no skirmishes.) <br>
<br>
(And I've often wondered what role that nasty Dwarf, Mali-whatever, had to play here, considering his &quot;solid, irrefutable evidence.&quot; I can find no mention of him in the history of the time and no one, not even that hag Tamalu, will speak of that awful Dwarf's activities after that fateful moment the arrow flew. Where was he with my father was treated so unjustly? or did he betray my father? I intend to have a deep and meaningful conversation with that smelly creature if I ever find him. A very meaningful conversation indeed.)<br>
<br>
I remember, though poorly, that after my mother returned from her two week absence, that I things were tense and I remember many raised voices -- not something uncommon among the Sylvans, being wild things as we are, but these were...different...and they frightened me. (It's an odd thing but I never visit these times, or any times before my ordeal, in Reverie...a mixed blessing, to be sure.)<br>
<br>
What next happened to my mother after telling me this story...is too heartbreaking to relate in full. But I never, ever, asked her of my father again. Never. The memories remain...<br>
<br>
...but they were all I had for some time. As Cyrica grew older, that pile of festering troll-droppings Buzek began to treat me in what can only be called a &quot;less than kind&quot; manner. My mother rarely associated with other Elves and I no longer had others my age to play or interact with. For most of my childhood, they called me unspeakable things and threw things at me, their parents snatching them away if I drew too near, they too saying very unkind things about me -- it was a lonely and painful time, indeed. <br>
<br>
Things became worse... I noticed my mother had bruises that looked odd. Soon after, I found the source of those injuries first hand as that ghoulish Buzek took our his pleasure upon me with a stick, a strap of leather, or his bare hands. &quot;Hey! werzat leetle ponti eerd freek-o-mine? werzat greeni-eyd ting guo? gunna geet eet gud dis tiem.&quot; Over time, it was so bad, the mere sound of 'werzat' would strike a cold spike of terror down my spine and tears almost coming to my eyes from the fear -- even when it wasn't me he was looking for. I still have scars from those early days.<br>
<br>
And deeper wounds still. For years, I had been spending more and more of my time away from everyone, in the wood. My beautiful mother had collected, I know not from where, a number of simply wonderful books by many Elven authors on many diverse subjects -- an odd thing for a Wood Elf to do, considering the subject matter of many of them. With great care, I would take one of the beautifully bound and illuminated books from my mother's small but well chosen library and spirit myself deeply away from Elven eyes. There, I would find a brook, or field, or great tree and while away the days with my friends -- the bears and squirrels and other creatures cared nothing for my past or my parentage or any of it...and for that I was profoundly glad. Nor did they seem to mind the many, many questions I'd ask them when I didn't understand something I'd read -- not that they ever gave me any answers though. The books, the animals, and the wilderness itself, these were my only friends -- and life was not so lonely after all.<br>
<br>
I worked my way home, one particularly wonderful day -- an audience of a few chipmunks and squirrels had helped me struggle through some concepts of the great poet/philosopher Yeoden I was reading and I'd finally made friends with that old bear that lives near the brook (well, she didn't chase me today, and lately, even when she did it seemed more playful than dangerous) -- to the run-down quasi-hovel our home had become under the tutelage of that mutated goat-spawn Buzek...as if living in the same place for decades wasn't hard enough. When I approached my disheveled home, it was quiet. It's...eery, to have your home absolutely quiet, without the small sounds that let you know it's lived-in. <br>
<br>
If I could only have one wish, one thing granted to me for my life's work, it would be to forget that entire day, to have it ripped from my mind, torn from my soul, forever out of my reach. I was pleased to find that the tyrant Buzek was absent -- perhaps I'd escape into sleep that night without any additional encounters between my body and random pieces of furniture. But what bothered me was that I heard neither of my half-breed sisters -- ok, I never liked them...but I don't like spiders either and I'm still kind to them -- and they are *always* making some kind of ruckus. I searched the house and found nothing but panic rising in my mind (my heart was racing and I couldn't catch my breath...something inside me _knew_ horror awaited me). Frantic, I ran outside, ran around the grounds, finding no one. Tears welled up in my eyes and it was hard to see. It was all I could do to keep from screaming for my mother with all abandon, like a lost pup in the tall grass. Whether it was the false dignity of my young age restraining me or my ever-tightening throat muscles, I kept mostly silent.<br>
<br>
In absolute desperation, I entered the one room I *NEVER* entered before, under *ANY* condition: the room my mother shared with that crazed Buzek. Curse my heart for not stopping before I ran back inside our meager home, curse the ground for not swallowing me up, curse the trees for not falling upon me. In later time, I learned to understand what I saw and unfortunately learned the depravity my mother suffered for my benefit -- what parents would do for their children is beyond imagining -- and learned a seething hate that defies words but is my constant companion. In that moment, all sound, all time, all movement of the sun and moon, all life, ALL...stopped. I saw that image and my mind refused it and the universe as a whole would not proceed until I *did* accept it. For centuries, for eons, I stood there, stopping the entirety of creation from taking its next step. I could not, would not, accept what I saw. No. Never. That which is impossible, is impossible. This can not be. No.<br>
<br>
Then, in a moment, I knew it was all true. My mother was dead, having died in a way I have no words to relate but was most extremely unpleasant and sickening. I was alone. I was in great danger. What brought forward motion to he world? &quot;werzat damn freek?!! werzat ponti eerd ting?!&quot; <br>
<br>
Buzek.<br>
<br>
Fear? Rage? The emotions that collided inside me are impossible to pick apart and describe or to put to words but I pray you never understand. There is peace in ignorance. What I can say is this: I was a fool and paid a high price for my foolishness. As my mind exploded trying to come to terms with so much, so fast...I stood in that doorway as if suicidal. Would that Buzek had been so kind to me.<br>
<br>
Forgive my shaky hand...though I must write of the happenings, they are still powerful and move me greatly. I shall try to write slowly and clearly. <br>
<br>
When the disgusting Buzek found me, his smile of delight pushed all other thoughts aside but by then my life's path was already unchangeable and my feeble attempt to escape proved only more satisfying to the depraved Buzek. When he was done, some long time later, I felt as if I had no blood left in me, no bones unbroken, no part of me undamaged. Breathing was in ragged gasps with stabbing, blinding pain and making the most horrible gurgling sound. I will not even discuss movement, an action I would have attempted had not the mere consideration of it made tears of pain course down my cheeks.<br>
<br>
Some time later, after much laughing from the insane Buzek and a companion who's face I never saw and who's voice I never heard clearly, I heard footsteps behind me. I hoped for death, for the pain to end. I should have known better.<br>
<br>
I was picked up in a most painful way and held from behind as the gleeful Buzek emptied a coal sack onto the table. For a moment, I thought I was to be roasted alive but, alas, my fate was worse than I ever imagined. &quot;eue lik lukin' ut it freek? weel fix dat!&quot; Please forgive my handwriting but can you imagine what was about to happen to me? I see well in the day, love watching the sky, the leaves in waving in the breeze, I see well by night, I love watching the stars, the night creatures scurry about their lives..I've never, ever seen a Elf with bad eye-sight, never imagined a blind Elf...the concept is...beyond horror, beyond words. <br>
<br>
Buzek the Tormentor, he earned the title now, stood laughing heartily as he saw the fear on my face when he picked up the handful of coal-dust. I squirmed, I wriggled, I felt no pain...confronted with my greatest fear, most horrific nightmare, a fate beyond comprehension, I felt no pain. My mind screamed. Could I have ripped my own limbs off, I would have cheerfully done so to escape that hand...full of coal-dust...and that..that...that smile on Buzek the Tormentor's face. Even now, after many years, my body still shakes at the mere glancing remembrance.<br>
<br>
The human behind me, whom I never truly saw but I'll remember his stench till I finally die, held my head and forced my eyes open. Buzek the Tormentor walked slowly, _savoringly_ toward me. <br>
<br>
Then, with his hand right before my eyes and his wicked grin right before me....unable to close my eyes or struggle free...<br>
<br>
...he took a deep breath...<br>
<br>
...his cheeks puffed...<br>
<br>
...and the world...<br>
<br>
...went...<br>
<br>
...dark.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I remember screaming, clawing at my eyes, and another savage (but brief) beating. I remember a long and harried ride upon an unhappy horse, with my broken, sightless body thrown across the back like a package. I remember being lifted up, more maniacal laughter, and a bone-jarring series of thumps as my body was bouncing and tumbling down a disused underground shaft. Then nothing for a brief instant followed by a wet *thump* which I hoped would end my sad life.<br>
<br>
I awoke some time later briefly then fell unconscious again -- this went on for a long time. I remember my first conscious full-minute...I didn't like it. My tongue was swollen, I was hideously tired, in unbelievable pain, was both very hot and very cold simultaneously, and...worst of all...I couldn't see...anything. Couldn't even bear the pain to open my eyes. Thankfully, I fell back into welcome unconsciousness for a time but when I was finally undesiringly thrust into wakefulness, I was in even worse shape. <br>
<br>
I managed to shift myself on the sandy ground and realized it was very damp. Dehydrated as badly as I was, I was in no position to complain about the hideous taste of the water I drank from a small puddle I found by accident. I waited to die from exposure or other factors but, much to my unhappy amazement, I didn't. It was both heartening and depressing.<br>
<br>
Enduring foggy wakefulness, gradually my body improved a bit but I was weak from hunger and movement was excruciating. While I had not as many broken bones as I had feared -- the long time of beatings must have toughened my body some -- there were still nasty breaks. I found some plants growing on the walls (not that I ever noticed any sunlight) by touch and tried them out -- it wasn't a good experience but it wasn't fatal either.<br>
<br>
As far as I could tell, I was in a somewhat circular area at the bottom of a rather long, angled surface shaft. The walls were covered with slime and moisture. The smell was an amalgam of worst things I'd ever been misfortune enough to come across and somehow it managed to be even worse. This odoriferous pit could be used to modify behavior of even the most ill-acting child ever born; tales of this otherworldly stench will certainly frighten children for generations to come. If you ever find yourself in that space...take my advice: don't breathe.<br>
<br>
After some time I realized what was broken and what wasn't. My upper right arm was nastily broken as were some of my fingers on my right hand -- the hand I tended to favor -- and my left leg was broken badly at the calf and would move at odd angles if I was were not extremely careful. I anticipated a lingering and exceptionally painful end as I had naught but those vile plants, which I were not even sure were a food yet, upon which to fill my belly (when it didn't violently rebel against such gastronomic abuse and projectilly force it's removal) and water to drink that I'm sure would have frightened many of the nastier diseases, and nothing with which to even try to mend my broken limbs. Very un-Elf-like thoughts came to me during this time. <br>
<br>
After a few &quot;days&quot; I realized that if I sat very, very still, I could hear some soft movements. Having nothing to lose, I slowly and with great pain tried to seek them out. I cut my hand on some small rocks that were plentiful a short distance toward the noises. After some many hours practice, I was able to have a meal consisting of some creature that felt very much like I would imagine a rat smashed by a rock would feel like. I'll leave to your imaginations the scene of a blind Elf, with no tools and a broken right arm and fingers, trying to make a meal of this foul creature. If you ever have the chance to eat the raw meat of one of these creatures or experience the malodorous &quot;joy&quot; of that pit...I suggest suicide. They are both masochistic choices that I'd withhold from even a Drow.<br>
<br>
After choking down my third rat-creature (I managed to smash one every two or three days) I noticed something...odd. I was not unhappy to be alive. I had a lot of time to think, down there. I measured &quot;days&quot; by how many times I entered reverie. After a month of &quot;days&quot; I had explored all of my surroundings, found out where my rancid, furry meals came from, and my days fell into a routine eating and thinking, thinking and eating, and much more thinking than eating. And, oddly enough, I was...well, content. That was when it hit me and I fully realized that I was truly my father's son, that his blood coursed through my veins. <br>
<br>
I had passed through the fire and...I remained. Blind I might be, broken and poorly healed, but I was still the son of a Ranger. And I was not yet vanquished...or finished.<br>
<br>
Though my bones did heal, they didn't heal as well as one would hope. The area of my calf was still swollen and not exactly straight. My fingers were ok but my upper right arm, while straight to the touch, always felt as if it would break if I did anything too strenuous, as did my calf. And they all ached constantly in the dank surroundings I found myself in.<br>
<br>
I eventually tried every avenue of escape possible. But there are only so many times you can slide back off that slimy wall before you come to your senses. The cracked wall the rat-things came in from laughed at my feeble attempts to expand it. Early on, I thought more of freedom and escape but eventually I came to realize that escape would come or would not but that, as I was, it would have to find me. And, whether delusion or premonition, I had little fear that it would come, when it was ready -- seems reading all that Yeoden had done me some good. Even the hateful sensation of being underground had disappeared as I adjusted to my new universe.<br>
<br>
I can't tell you how much and how deeply I treasured the very un-Sylvan collection of books my beautiful mother had made available to me. I'd read so much...so many thoughts, varied and deep, had echoed in my mind over those years...there was so much to think about, reconsider, and observe in my mind's eye. Reverie helped bring back those long days. My days were overflowing with thoughts. I never remember having a bored moment in my confinement; there is nothing like quiet confinement to give the mind wings. I explored each book I had read (my memory being sharper than ever during my ordeal) and applied and tested each thought, each concept, to the world I remembered. Those books were my universe and I was on an awesome adventure! But, even those books had their limits and I began to wonder and consider the world for myself. I questioned...well, everything. And I learned that more often than not, it is the question itself that matters, not its answer. <br>
<br>
(I told you I was a sad excuse for a Wood Elf. Some Elves escape into the wood, I escaped into my mind. And thanks to Buzek, I suddenly had no where else to turn. In many ways, I feel loss and sadness for my fellow Sylvans for they hardly see the intricate and beautiful spider-web of connections all around us. We pride ourselves in our knowledge of and harmony with the land, with nature -- all while steadfastly maintaining our ignorance of what lies one step beyond. I understand nature much better now, much better than I ever could. The connections between the different Elven peoples, each with a piece of.... Forgive me, you didn't take up this epistle to read one of my many Elven diatribes.)<br>
<br>
I'd quit counting time at one point so I didn't know at the time but I was just about two years into my ordeal when the universe once again took notice of my existence and threw me another twist. While I was doing my afternoon thinking (which I did walking -- alright, hobbling -- back and forth), I tripped and fell head-long into the shallow pool of fetid water worse than any other I'd found in my blind explorations and that never seemed to fully go away. After violently coughing and choking, I realized my eyes were burning with great fervor. The pain was most intense and I imagined my eyes are aflame. It lasted only a few minutes but it was a relief when it mercifully subsided, leaving me sweat drenched and trying to reacquire my grip on myself. My eyes, though, felt better than they had since that day with Buzek the Tormentor. Some days later, I convinced myself to try that nasty pool of water on my eyes again. I'd washed my eyes many times before with the somewhat cleaner water available elsewhere but it had never had any beneficial effect. After the second, self-inflicted, bout of flaming eyeballs, I had to rest for many hours. It has been much, much worse than the first time. After I regained my strength enough to be aware of my eyes, they, again, felt quite a bit better. <br>
Over the next few weeks, every few days I'd have my courage worked up to set my eyes aflame again. The last few times I'd done it, the pain of the water on my eyes had stopped getting worse and almost seemed a tad easier. The last time I doused my eyes with that murky, foul-smelling liquid, I felt nothing at all. I washed my eyes with the cleaner water and, again, no serious pain. I had hoped, against all hope, that I'd be able to see but, alas, I was still blind. That was probably my lowest moment and I cried the tears of deep despair and sobbed mightily in self-pity. Hope, says Yeoden, is the seed of all our greatness. What he neglects to tell you is this: Hope is also the seed of our greatest and most profoundly soul-crushing despair. <br>
<br>
It took days but I recovered from my despair...and from my self-loathing. In all my mental wanderings and ponderings, I had never once let myself consider what life would be like outside my damp and malodorous prison. How would other Elves act to my blindness or my (now) oddly shaped body? Poorly I suspect, though with less enthusiastic hatred than they expressed for my heritage. I wondered, pitifully, if there was anywhere I'd be accepted with any dignity. It was at that bitter moment that I allowed the death of hope...<br>
<br>
...and for the first time in my life, I took a deep breath as a free Elf. That eminent moment was somewhat clouded by the fit of coughing that followed that profound gesture -- I may have been somewhat used to it but the stench of that hole was still quite bad. Yet...I felt better than ever in my life, happy even. What do you say to *that*, Yeoden?! <br>
<br>
I was free of restriction, free of the fear that my Hopes would go unfulfilled -- fear that I would still be despised and unjustly mistreated. Dignity, pride, self-respect...all of it returned to me and grew. I'd let go my fears and embraced my life. I no longer feared failure, feared how others would treat me, or how life itself would treat me. The eminent and necessary qualities of character come not from without but from within -- words easily said but rarely realized. Lest you think I suddenly had an epiphanal change of character, let me assure you, I still carry the scars and ragged tares of my experiences. But I did gain vital insight into, and confidence in, myself. Deep in the core of my Elven self...I knew I would be ok, no matter what happened.<br>
<br>
Some weeks later, I experienced a sharp, stabbing pain in my eyes as I awoke. More frightening than anything since Buzek the Tormentor held up that handful of coal dust. It was daybreak. <br>
<br>
And I knew. <br>
<br>
I knew.<br>
<br>
A few weeks later I could see enough to look back up the shaft I fell through so long ago. My escape was anticlimactic. There were gnarled and twisted vines growing down the shaft (which was at a traversable angle) and all I had to do was toss a fair-sized rock up the shaft till it knocked one of the vines within reach. My first escape attempt gave me a bruised behind for my trouble but the second vine held firm as I inched up the slimy, nasty, sickly green wall and through the lichen-covered shaft toward the sunlight. If you must know, I made the climb with my eyes closed. If I should see the world above and the vine break or my arm snap and I be trapped below...it would be the end of me. If that was to be my fate...I wanted to keep my ignorance of the beauty above. But the vine and my aching arm held as I inched closer. I suffered many scrapes and more bruises, a few cuts on my hands and other places. Yet..when I finally made it to the surface, moved (crawling on my belly) a good distance from that shaft into the underworld -- lest an act of ill-balance send me back to my unwarranted prison -- and stopped, all I could feel was my aching arms and bruised legs and collapsed in honest exhaustion, slipping almost immediately into Reverie.<br>
<br>
I awoke to an evening sun, extremely sore muscles, and the most intense pleasure of my life. I was...<br>
<br>
...free. And I could *see* that I was free. <br>
<br>
That first night...I couldn't do anything but lay there in the dry grass -- DRY!!...GRASS!! -- and consider how wonderful life was. Oh the sheer, unadulterated ecstasy to smell grass, blossoms, rabbits, birds, field mice, flowers, oh...just *EVERYTHING* Breathing was...Arvanaith. With great joy and happiness I stared at the stars throughout the night -- well, in truth, I stared up at barely discernable blobs that _might_ have been stars but I couldn't think of a single complaint. At daybreak, I decided some food and water were in order so I got clumsily to my feet and realized that my initial fall back into my prison must have injured my once-broken leg again, for it hurt badly, but it still held my weight so I continued. I thought I could make out a stream nearby -- I knew water must be very near due to the constant dampness of my prison. <br>
<br>
I approached the stream and had to traverse a shallow bank covered with fantastic colors and frighteningly wonderful scents. And in the midst of that transcendent scene...I tripped. It was, in retrospect, not the best thing I could have done at that moment. I splashed into the water with my once-broken leg now quite broken again, in the same painful spot. And the water was absolutely frigid. And I laughed the giggling laughter of a child. As I shivered and tried to drag my once-again-broken body back up on the bank, I was overwhelmed by the odd joy at my predicament. I didn't see anything funny but I was still giggling, and then I realized what I was laughing at: myself. I'd had a moment of fear and terror when I fell and felt my bones snap. Had I not been here before and survived? And I had _tools_ now! Terribly cold water to ease the pain and slow the swelling, small saplings not more than a few yards away and vines with which to make a splint. Cloth from my tattered shirt and river stones for a sling or...those trees on the other side of the stream looked like they'd yield me some excellent material for an improvised bow. Life was sweet.<br>
<br>
Yet, sweet as it was, my splint was of little help, those trees weren't as forth coming with anything really useful for even an improvised bow, and while the remains of my shirt made an acceptable sling and the river stones excellent projectiles, my aim left everything to be desired...and I couldn't find anything to lob my stones at anyway. I did at least find a fine walking stick so I could make acceptable progress walking to...well, wherever I was walking to. <br>
<br>
It was wonderful to be in the wood again. I had found some hard, angular stones late that first day of freedom and put something of a point on one end of my walking stick. Not knowing what I'd find on my journey, I wanted some kind of defense. My belly was sated for the first time in...how long was it?, I wondered. I'd found some scrumptious mushrooms and some delightful berries -- ok, the mushrooms were slimy and horrible and the berries were extremely bitter...and they were indeed wonderfully scrumptious and exceedingly delightful. I couldn't remember being so happy, so free, so content with life.<br>
<br>
Then...I met people again.<br>
<br>
My experiences left me changed, both in spirit and in body. No one would recognize me as my former self. That hardly mattered though and I had to reconsider my Sylvan brethren's desire to just be left alone -- perhaps they were correct after all . I was met by these travelers with derision, suspicion, contempt, and a variety of other responses that were even less enthusiastic. Could I look *that* bad? Surely no. <br>
<br>
Surely yes, as a matter of fact. The state of my clothing was nothing short of abysmal, tattered and stained as they were. And personal hygiene was something I had little facility to attend to. &quot;Odd how these things never occurred to me before my liberation,&quot; I thought to myself with a grin. I'm a Sylvan Elf, a wild thing, but even Sylvan's have their standards. I could do little about my clothing but a well splintered rock proved to contain a sharp enough edge to allow some poor but effective -- and desperately needed -- maintenance on my shaggy blond mane. <br>
<br>
Weeks past, during which I met few travelers -- and was better for it.<br>
<br>
Having filled my belly on the most wonderful fruits and nuts, I was taking a light almost-Reverie on the branch of an immense old Oak tree with the chipmunk I'd befriended, thinking how nice it was that my leg hurt little now (I'd improved my splint some weeks ago) and again considering writing -- if I ever saw pen and paper again -- that rebuttal to Yeoden I'd been toying with...when the most pungent and troublesome odor roused me. <br>
<br>
Orc.<br>
<br>
I looked and looked -- my eyes had continued to slowly improve but still were not what they once were -- and finally saw them. They were heading my direction but didn't seem to have noticed me. Normally, I had no love or hate for the Orcish folk, being too young to have direct knowledge of their raids on my village, and even so, it felt so very long ago. But the scene I'd seen the previous week, left me with deep feelings for their race. I found a band of them, 15 strong, causing an enormous Orcish commotion so I took to the trees to investigate. They were in such a state that I could have ridden up on horse back blaring on a trumpet and they'd have been oblivious to me, so I was able to get much closer than I would normally have dared. Elves are a curious people by nature...I'm no longer convinced this is always a good trait. I found the body of a poor Elf, a Grey Elf from the look of it, stung out as one would string a deer carcass for butchering. The Orcs were having a grand ol' time with the remains. It sickened me to my core but there was nothing I could do. I moved off to retch in peace.<br>
<br>
I watched these present Orcs carefully. They were doing the Orc version of being stealthy. I looked in the direction they were heading and saw nothing worth being stealthy about. I remained ready but unsure of what to do, I planned to let them pass, poorly armed as I was. When they passed under the great limb I was perched on something, to this day I know not what, compelled me to leap upon them. I had my now much better sharpened walking stick pointed down and I hit the biggest one with my full weight upon my staff -- it sunk in with a horrible sound and shriek from the soon to be dead Orc. The other set upon me almost immediately and, with my staff solidly buried in the first Orc, I was quite defenseless and wondering if I'd gone mad to get involved in this manner. The Orc managed a solid kick against my bare chest as I was still half-crouched from my partially broken fall, knocking the wind out of me as I crashed heavily to the ground. Just before the Orc was able to land another, perhaps fatal, blow, I heard the solid twang of a well-made bow and the ill-sounding *thunk* of the arrow hitting home. The Orc screamed and ran tearing through the brush.<br>
<br>
I tried to pull myself to a sitting position, an evil throbbing coming from my much-abused leg. Then M'Rena appeared in my field of view, she looked at me worriedly, asking if I were injured. I replied that I was in acceptable condition (which was a damned lie) and thanked her for her well-timed arrow. She looked surprised, then thanked _me_ for alerting her to the Orcs and for dispatching one -- she seemed confident that, even if she had heard them, she couldn't have dealt with two of them alone. We had rescued each other it seemed.<br>
<br>
It was at this moment that I knew I was no longer who I began life as. As I grew up, before I found myself an outcast, I remember hearing tid-bits of the world outside but...had little desire to meet other races, or even other Elves. We had a profound desire to be left alone from the insanity that lay outside ourselves. Even with other Elves, we were...while not unkind, not exactly welcoming. Yet, at that moment, after all I'd been through, after all the absence of companionship of like-creatures, I desperately wanted our contact to continue. She was, after all, an Elf. And to have an Elf, even a Grey Elf, speak kindly to me...it was food and Feywine to the soul.<br>
<br>
After much discussion I found myself accompanying M'Rena, limping badly and leaning heavily on my now Orc-reeking staff. She asked if I needed help, and I abrasively declined -- I was determined to continue my self-reliant trend...and I was being a bit pig-headed. M'Rena, to her credit, never showed me pity or even slowed her pace. She took me at my word. That, more than anything else, won her a special place in my crusty Sylvan heart. No matter the circumstances, if she calls, I will stand by her side even unto death.<br>
<br>
The ever-lovely M'Rena was the first person I encountered after my ordeal that was kind to me and showed me respect -- for which I am eternally grateful. Her father, M'Yan the Scholar, a crotchety old Elf who I miss dearly and daily, had one brief conversation with me (and that was a heated argument) before all-but-adopting me. I'm not sure how things would have been had he guessed my true age. While shorter than an adult, my bearing (for my childhood and adolescence never survived my ordeal) gave him the belief that poor diet was the culprit of my height and not my age -- even though I'd gained some weight, I was still horribly thin. The freedom this mistake gave me helped me greatly.<br>
<br>
Over the years, M'Yan and I battled over philosophy, ethics, poetry, economics, history, music, art, culture, law, pretty much everything (I had a *lot* of time to think while in my stinking prison, and one can think some pretty deep thoughts down deep in a hole and it was a trend I was intent upon continuing). And access to M'Yan's excellent library only added to the depth of the arguments we had when I came to visit. And years later, when he used his great influence to gain me access to the Scholar's Library... those times were vibrant, exuberating, exacerbating, exhausting, and completely thrilling as not just M'Yan and I would argue but he would often engage others of his trade in our wars of ideas -- though it has taken me decades, I seem to have finally been given some small measure of grudging respect by M'Yan's peers (now if I could only get them to stop calling me a 'young feral pup'). <br>
<br>
When I first met M'Yan, he had the gleam of the Calling in his eye, that look one gets when the Great Walk is near, but he put it off for a number of years till he could wait no longer -- I like to think it was because of our talks (well, battles) -- and then he departed some two summers ago. I am exceedingly happy for him, yet can not help wishing he were still here. He was perhaps the only one who fully understood the dichotomy of spirit I feel. He once told me, over some exceptional (and perhaps too much) Feywine, that he was convinced I was an old Grey Elf who left Arvanaith to be reincarnated but the shock of it left my memories behind as I entered my current Wood Elf body but kept the sense of those years intact. &quot;That would explain a great deal,&quot; he said. I've never given an moment's credence to that Feywine-induced utterance, I know that the torment I endured and the ordeal I experienced, forced adulthood and other growth upon me sooner than any god should allow. And now that I think again of that moment, I believe he was teasing me -- after all, I'd had a long diatribe about how the Grey Elf penchant for walling off the world to protect their purity was only ensuring that any purity that had existed would fall into decadence for lack of challenge. M'Yan was a subtle old Elf.<br>
<br>
M'Yan loved to argue, to honestly think and exercise his mind. There were many of his peers, I found, that also enjoyed debate -- especially younger scholars. It was sometimes hard to keep on an even footing -- I'd have to study long hours and constantly review in my mind as I went about the tasks of daily life (I still spent most of my time in the wood and training with bow and sword). Yeoden (who I found out was a Grey Elf), was held in high regard...so the subject of Yeoden was always an explosive one, on my end at least.<br>
<br>
That first day at the Scholar's Library... At first, I tried to remain calm and collected -- to honor M'Yan for his efforts on my behalf -- but my blood is still Sylvan and Yeoden the poet/philosopher is my pet sore-spot. I didn't last 10 seconds when Shail'rayn began expounding on Yeoden's great virtues to a young scholar. &quot;What a pile of fetid ogre droppings!&quot; I heard myself say, far too loud -- I suddenly felt the attention of everyone in the room. &quot;M'Yan,&quot; Shail'rayn said, the air rife with condescension, &quot;is that feral young pup yours?&quot; You can see where this is going, can't you? Decorum, what little I had, evaporated. I hopped across the intervening table, sat on it's edge, right in front of Shail'rayn, in direct violation of his personal space. &quot;Feral I may be,&quot; I said, &quot;but I can tell when a thief is stealing my purse while selling me damaged goods!&quot; It went down hill from there. He nearly walked out several times but some well placed insults brought him back. After a long, long argument, insults aplenty (from both of us) he said, with exceptional haughty condescension, &quot;How can I expect a feral Wood Elf to understand the subtleties one of our greatest philosophers?&quot; I was standing on a chair a fraction of a second later with two handfuls of his clothes in my hands so I could look him eye-to-eye, saying: &quot;Shail'rayn, I'm getting claustrophobia from the smallness of your mind!&quot; <br>
<br>
With that, I headed out of the room, wanting desperately get outside into wide open spaces -- or at least where I could see the sky and feel like I could breathe again. The room was completely silent as I hopped down from the chair began walking and stayed that way for perhaps another 10 seconds then M'Yan did something I never thought I'd see a Grey Elf do -- did you know they can actually belly-laugh? I'd done something M'Yan had never done: Shail'rayn was speechless. Shail'rayn was a tireless Yeoden supporter and absolutely hated it when someone wasn't a Yeoden convert, which describes me to perfection, and never would let them get away without seeing the 'brilliance of the great Yeoden.' I later learned that this was M'Yan's intent, to get Shail'rayn and I together...the sneaky old Elf. This was M'Yan's way of ensuring I'd be accepted (or at least tolerated). And I was, though more as a curiosity and amusement, but it was enough to guarantee me many thought-provoking hours of discussion and debate and immense learning. <br>
<br>
Is it any wonder that I miss M'Yan? I still visit the Scholar's Library when the mood strikes, but most times I feel the weight if his loss too much. <br>
<br>
M'Rena is still as kind to me as she was on that first day, never a haughty or condescending word said to me. Through the years, we've remained firm and confident companions. One of my joys is escorting M'Rena on her trips to gather herbs and subtle spices that do not grow well except in their natural environs. It is dangerous that far outside the city but my fighting skills have improved vastly since we'd first met -- in all truth, they could hardly have gotten worse -- and I've had many chances to demonstrate it. The joy of escorting her to collect those herbs and spices is second only to those times when M'Rena allows me the gastronomic ecstasy of sampling one of her dishes. I only pray the food in Arvanaith is as good.<br>
<br>
Yet, for all the time we have spent together over the years, she has never inquired into my history. So far, M'Yan is the only one I've told my story to. And now you. I have no house, no riches, but I have little need for these things. My clothes, my sword, my Elven bow (a parting gift from M'Yan, it is of exquisite construction and fine quality and my most prized posession), and my knowledge are all I have, all I need. I live my life struggling with the aftermath of my experiences and doing my best to live up to my father's blood in me -- and my mother's.<br>
<br>
My body is mostly whole now. My leg is straight and strong -- amazing what a good diet does for the body and soul -- and I fear no activity with my arm. I've continued to learn (M'Yan gave his daughter strict instructions to keep his library fully up to date and that I was to always have free access to it) and delve deeper into my chosen path. It's a struggle to be sure and I've had a little help in learning the ways of the Ranger but I remain undaunted, unafraid. I still spend enormous amounts of time alone in the wood, where I feel most comfortable. I find that after my ordeal, I'm not fond of closed spaces and at times even M'Yan's library is a bit too confining. My eyesight is still less than it once was but not overmuch -- and may still be slowly improving -- and in the wood smell and hearing (while not as sharp as they were during my ordeal are still quite keen) offer advantages -- a fair trade perhaps.<br>
<br>
But... I do have other goals, other less noble desires.<br>
<br>
I mean to have a very deep and pointed conversation with that foul Dwarf, Malishn. At the point of a sword if necessary. If I find any dishonesty, any betrayal in him...<br>
<br>
And the mutant offspring of a deranged troll that held me while Buzek the Tormentor snuffed out my eyes...this creature has much to answer for.<br>
<br>
However...<br>
<br>
My one over-riding goal in my life is to find Buzek the Tormentor. To answer his alcohol-slurred question &quot;werzat leetle ponti eerd freek-o-mine?&quot; To say my father's words to him (&quot;For those you have wronged, to avenge their deaths and torment, to set right and balance the scales, I take your life to appease the past and protect the future.&quot;), and permanently protect those he has not yet touched.<br>
<br>
Until then, until I've earned my true name again, you can call me....<br>
