Dark Age of Camelot <br>
Test version 1.39 <br>
<br>
====================================== <br>
<br>
CAMELOT HERALD <br>
<br>
- Please note that a new website was launched two weeks ago dedicated to disseminating information from us to you, the Camelot community. You can find it at www.camelotherald.com. <br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>
<br>
- The last patch had a change to Hibernian Piercing combat styles - Sidewinder was changed to require an opening style that itself had a block opening. This had the large unintended consequence that many classes (who didn't use shields) could no longer use these styles. So, we're changing it back to the way it was before. Sidwinder now requires as its opening Black Widow. We apologize for the confusion. <br>
<br>
- We think we've finally nailed down the last bug that was preventing high level characters from getting combat styles. You should now see all your styles when you log in. <br>
<br>
- You'll now see arrows fly through the air when an archer fires at a target. When the arrow hits the target, the arrow sticks in the target for a couple of seconds letting the target know the rough direction from which the arrow was fired. <br>
<br>
- Players can now climb ladders. To climb a ladder run up to it and continue holding down the move forward key. You'll climb up the ladder. To climb down the ladder, use the move backward key. If you are on a wall and which to climb a ladder, move backwards and fall off of the wall onto the ladder - you'll stick to it and can climb up and down. <br>
<br>
- Monsters now respect doors so that if a door is closed (but not locked) the monster will open the door before going through. If a door is locked (i.e. at a frontier or relic keep), the monster will not come through at all. <br>
<br>
- You now get a dialog box for confirmation when you give weapon or armor to a guard. <br>
<br>
- If you have no chance to repair an items, you now get a message telling you that - previously you would just get a message telling you that you failed. <br>
<br>
- Previously, you could not be interrupted while shooting a bow after you draw the bow but are just &quot;waiting to fire&quot;. Now you have a chance of getting interrupted while waiting to fire as well as when you are drawing the bow. <br>
<br>
- The /bind command has been slightly changed - it still binds you if you are in a bindable area, prints your bind location if you are not. The change is that if you are in a dungeon or another Realm, you'll get &quot;you can't bind here&quot; message (because the game doens't know where your bind point is when you are in another region). <br>
<br>
- If you are mesmerized in the middle of the cast, you no longer complete your spell when the mez wears off. You now have to recast your spell. <br>
<br>
- You can now simply type &quot;/who 30 40&quot; to find players of certain levels. Previously you had to type &quot;/who level 30 40&quot; to find the same information. <br>
<br>
- You can no longer inadvertently downgrade an object by using the &quot;upgrade&quot; command and specifying a lower level than the object's current level. <br>
<br>
- You can no longer salvage an item for 0 money. <br>
<br>
- The position of the tradeskill timer should save now when you exit the game. <br>
<br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES <br>
<br>
RVR Frontier Keeps: <br>
<br>
- A Forge and Lathe have been added to the following frontier keeps: <br>
- Albion : Caer Benowyc in Hadrian's Wall <br>
- Midgard: Bledmeer Faste in Odin's Gate <br>
- Hibernia: Dun Crauchon in Emain Macha <br>
<br>
- Merchants have ventured into the frontier with the various armies and have set up shop selling certain wares related to war. Arrows, throwing axes, and poisons can now be purchased in certain keeps throughout the frontiers, depending on which army holds the fortress. <br>
<br>
<br>
Monster Encounters <br>
<br>
Hibernia <br>
- Rangers have reported an increase in Siabra activity near the center of the Bog of Cullen. The power of that area also seems to be growing, not just with the Siabra, but with all the creatures found there. The guardians seem harder, more disciplined; the archmagi seem stronger; and the raven wraiths and cronicorns seem even nastier than they already were. The one good side of this is that the banshees seem to shriek a little less often than they once did. <br>
<br>
- A nightshade who snuck into the Coruscating mines reports an increase of the number of sentries. He also mentioned other guards, slightly larger than the sentries who patrolled the lode room. <br>
<br>
- Princess Brigit of Tir na Nog has dispatched Sentinel Champions and their Noble Steeds to help protect Innis Carthaig. They should be able to protect the city from any Siabra invasions. <br>
<br>
Albion <br>
<br>
- A wandering minstrel sings of his ventures in to Cornwall. He tells a story of how the Cornish frogs and brown bears, both young and old, have changed, and how more boogies haunt the area. The spirits of Romans long dead line the road and around their villa. The minstrel sings of the muryans, the shape-shifting small people of Cornwall who grow smaller with each change of their form until at last the smallest form is reached and they remain as ants until the end of their days. At the end of his song, the minstrel began to weep for the loss of his lute, which saved his life by deflecting the blow of a Cornish giant. <br>
<br>
<br>
Hibernia Quests / NPCs <br>
<br>
- The Level 40 Hibernian epics are in. See the trainers in Tir na Nog for details. <br>

<br>
<br>

SPELL SYSTEM UPDATES <br>
<br>
- Minstrels and Bards can now view information about their songs, just like other spellcasters can do with their spells (the &quot;i&quot; key). <br>
<br>
- All pulsing spells now print to everyone in the group. A chat channel has been added in the system chat channel picker to turn off all pulsing prints. <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

Oh...that just sounds awfully painful-looking.<br>
