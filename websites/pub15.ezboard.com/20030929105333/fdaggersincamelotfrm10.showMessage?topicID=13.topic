<br>
&quot;Miserable rain,&quot; thought William as he trudged through the mud from the stables.  He was drenched to the skin in moments with cold raindrops.  He was heading to the barracks but the rain was so strong he couldn't see the stone building across the compound.  The ground was covered in thick mud that made him take his time or lose his footing completely.<br>
<br>
As he was crossing the compound he thought he heard a commotion at the Abby gate although the rain was hard and loud enough that he wasn't sure.  He looked for the door guards but they were absent.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Likely someplace warm and dry like sensible people, no doubt</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well, I can't get any <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">more</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> wet.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  He changed direction to the Abby gate.<br>
<br>
As he approached he could hear heavy pounding on the door and shouts for entry.  William, his hair matted to him and his normally white and black garments splattered with mud, climbed the watchtower steps and looked over the wall.  &quot;Aye, what you be wantin'&quot; he called out loudly to overcome the rain.<br>
<br>
&quot;We seek entry to the Abby, Acolyte,&quot; came the reply.  There were several in the party, all looking a bit worse for wear and mud-splattered themselves.  Some were in ornate plate, obviously Paladins, while another was in chain of Cleric design.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you, who seek sanctuary?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;We've come from the frontier to meet our comrades here.  I am Luric,&quot; the Paladin spoke again, gesturing with his shield-hand, &quot;this is Devildog and...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Daggers!,&quot; exclaimed William, seeing the Silver Dagger emblem upon the shield, &quot;One moment sirs!&quot;  He quickly hurried down to open the door.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Sirs?&quot; Rhianidd said in a low voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hush, Butch,&quot; Norwood said, nudging her shoulder.<br>
<br>
William had trouble opening the latch by himself, slipping once to his knees in the mud, but he took little notice.  He planted his feet and pushed, opening the door a little way.  Strong hands opened the door the rest of the way as they entered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome to you all.  You'll find food and a warm fire in that building there,&quot; William said, speaking to Luric and pointing to a building that none could see in the rain. &quot;I'll let the Bishop and your guild mates know you are here.&quot;  <br>
<br>
The others thanked him and trudged off to the unseen building while Devildog remained behind to help him shut and bar the gate.  <br>
<br>
Urgency overtaking him, Devildog grabbed the boy's arm -- a bit harder than he intended or realized -- and spun him around.  &quot;Is Vincent here?&quot; he asked pointedly.  William, momentarily stunned at the strength he was gripped in, stammered for an answer. &quot;Is he here?&quot; Devildog asked again forcefully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Y-yes,&quot; William managed to get out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take me to him,&quot; Devildog said, adding an impatient, &quot;Now!&quot; when William hesitated.<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent sat in the empty scribe's hall of the Library.  He was supposed to be reviewing dispatches he'd received and had a meeting with the Bishop shortly.  Instead he was lost in his earlier translation work, still going over the symbols in his head to see if he could make some sense of them.<br>
<br>
The ringing of a bell to mark the hour let Brother Vincent know he was already running late.  He was gathering up the dispatches and securing them when two very wet people entered the room, dripping profusely.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brother Vincent,&quot; William started to say before Devildog cut him off<br>
<br>
&quot;Vincent,&quot; Devildog said forcefully, &quot;We need to talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent was happy to see his friend but too caught up with events and dispatches to mark it with the enthusiasm it deserved -- but then, there never was much ceremony between them.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd love to, DD, but I'm late for a meeting with the Bishop,&quot; Brother Vincent said, as he finished securing the dispatches and was making for the door.  &quot;We can talk as soon as...&quot; was as far as Brother Vincent got before Devildog threw him helm aside and interrupted his egress by pinning him to the wall.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have to talk <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>now</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, Vincent,&quot; Devildog said forcefully.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent looked down at the powerful hands holding him to the wall and back into Devildog's eyes.  Devildog, seeing the look in Brother Vincent's eyes, realized exactly what he was doing and released Brother Vincent immediately and backed away a step, feeling a bit ashamed of himself.  William was looking at them wide-eyed in surprise and more than a little alarmed.<br>
<br>
&quot;William,&quot; Brother Vincent said evenly, &quot;Tell the Bishop I'll be late.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent grabbed Devildog's arm and gestured up the stairs that lined the side wall leading to the second floor and the room that Brother Vincent had commandeered.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent used the time climbing the stairs to reflect on Devildog's behavior; something had enflame his preternaturally quiet countenance.  That couldn't be good news, not from the play of anger, distress, and fear that were in Devildog's eyes. Brother Vincent steeled himself for more awful news.<br>
<br>
They entered the room Brother Vincent had been using and, as a precaution, rune-sealed the room knowing that Devildog wouldn't mention Brother Vincent's use of arcane magic.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not that I was looking forward to meeting with that fat bugger of a Bishop but what exactly is so important that it couldn't wait till after I was done listening to him whine?&quot; Brother Vincent asked.  <br>
<br>
Devildog slumped against a wall and seemed, suddenly, at a loss for words.  He sank till he was sitting, staring between his plate-clad knees.  Brother Vincent waited patiently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hibernia tried to take the relic fort in Snowdonia but we beat them off.  We were...&quot; Devildog said, emotion choking off his words.  Brother Vincent watched him assert control over himself.  In a clearer voice, Devildog continued, &quot;We were resurrecting our forces and many had left the battlefield already.  Turtil had been with us but broke off to hunt down stragglers when we broke Hibernia's back.  We can't form a group like we used to so I didn't know anything bad had happened to him.  Down the side of a hill I found him and tried to resurrect him...but I couldn't.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent failed to see the fuss.  Being killed was a rough thing on the body and soul.  Sometimes the rip was so violent that the soul wasn't &quot;consciously&quot; responsive enough to use the conduit energy that clerics, paladins, and friars could provide to re-enter the body.  As the soul began the phase shift into the other realm after about 10 minutes, it reached the resonance the Soulstones magic was attuned to and was drawn into it's unescapable funnel -- so long as one had tied one's self to a Soulstones, they couldn't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>truly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> die.  Brother Vincent had, himself, run across many so-called &quot;unrezables&quot; in his career no to mention experiencing the other side of that coin a few times as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;DD...you know how violent some separations are.  We've both been &quot;away&quot; when someone's tried to resurrect us and Lord knows we've had our share of &quot;unrezables&quot;...what's the big deal?&quot;  Brother Vincent asked, admittedly impatient that he'd gone though all this for a somewhat routine issue.<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't understand...&quot; Devildog said heavily, &quot;There wasn't anything there to resurrect.  Nothing.  Hibby has found some way to kill us permanently.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent's face didn't portray it, he hoped, but inside he went cold.  He said nothing.  Not only had DD not been able to rez Turtil, something that he no doubt blamed himself for in some manner, but Turtil and Devildog had been very close friends.  Brother Vincent knew he has to remain strong no matter what he felt inside.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you understand what this means?!&quot; Devildog, seeing the death of his Realm, barked as Brother Vincent sat apparently unmoved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I do.  But it's not as simple as that,&quot; Brother Vincent said quietly as he rose.  He opened a cabinet and pulled out a short bundle wrapped in a blanket.  He unwrapped it for Devildog to see.  Devildog's eyes went wide.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent coldly explained, &quot;The waxy sheen is a preservative I picked up in the Isles -- they used it to preserve food but I figured it'd work here as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Devildog looked up at Brother Vincent, not sure what to say.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent continued, &quot;I ran into him yesterday morning.  Dumb little kobold was out alone apparently.  Once I dropped him and took care of my own wounds, I noticed he didn't feel right.  There wasn't the usual...feel.  I waited a long time.  As you can see, he's still here.<br>
<br>
&quot;At first I thought it might be a problem with Midgard but with what you tell me...I wonder if it is of Hibernia's doing or a problem all realms are facing.  I'll notify the Crown to look into it further.  In any event, no one, DD, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>no one</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> must know of this.  You can imagine the consequences.&quot;<br>
<br>
Devildog nodded but said nothing.<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
Devildog stood at the small window in the room watching the rain.  Brother Vincent had put away the blanket and it's contents and removed the rune-ward from the door and window.  <br>
<br>
Silently they left the room and, Devildog picking up his helm, exited the library.  They agreed to meet up with the other Daggers after Brother Vincent was finished with his meeting.  As Brother Vincent watched Devildog trudge off into the still pouring rain he took notice of Devildog's stance.  His back was straight, his stride confident and controlled.  That was the Devildog Brother Vincent remembered.  Stoic and strong as steel.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent knew Devildog was still concerned but he also knew Devildog had a lot of confidence in him and trusted him to involve the right people to get the bottom of matter.  Brother Vincent wished he shared that confidence.  He had told Devildog the truth but not all of it.  Brother Vincent felt a sharp pang at duplicity with is friend and wanted to let him know all that he knew about the matter...but one's conscience was a small price to pay for what was at stake.<br>
<br>
Soulstones were self-sustaining as they stripped what power they needed and then some from the act of resurrection.  What was not generally known, in fact what was known by only a handful of people in Albion, was that it was impossible to resurrect anyone.  The soul makes an almost instantaneous transition at the point of death.  Something has to slow that process down and turn it back on itself.  This was the Soulstone network.  It slowed the phase transition so that a resurrection could occur, either by an attuned adept or by the Soulstones themselves.  The resurrection energy merely provided an attunement and focus point for the Soulstones.  The energy used to resurrect fed into the Soulstones network at a rate of 10:1 ensuring that the Soulstones were always replenished with energy.<br>
<br>
Something had tapped into that energy or altered and diverted it, Brother Vincent feared.<br>
<br>
He prayed it was Hibernian mystics that had done it.  That might be corrected, given time.<br>
<br>
Yet he feared something far, far worse.<br>
<br>
That...something...lurked unseen...<br>
<br>
...and quietly fed. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=13.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=13.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.silverdaggers.net/img/add.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.threadControl?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub15.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="daggersincamelotfrm1">DAoC General<option value="daggersincamelotfrm2">Events<option value="daggersincamelotfrm3">In Game Quests<option value="daggersincamelotfrm4">Trade Skills<option value="daggersincamelotfrm5">Treasury<option value="daggersincamelotfrm10">Around the Campfire<option value="daggersincamelotfrm12">Hibernia Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm14">Midgard Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm15">Albion Class Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm16">Albion Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm17">Game Mechanic Discussions<option value="daggersincamelotfrm18">Officers<option value="daggersincamelotfrm19">Sig Test Site<option value="daggersincamelotfrm21">Application Review<option value="daggersincamelotfrm22">Sponsorship<option value="daggersincamelotfrm23">Announcements<option value="daggersincamelotfrm27">War Room<option value="daggersincamelotfrm28">Policy Discussions<option value="daggersincamelotfrm29">RvR Council<option value="daggersincamelotfrm35">Wine Cellar<option value="daggersincamelotfrm36">Adventuring in the Shrouded Isles</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E6E8fA>- </font><a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot>Daggers in Camelot</a><font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10>Around the Campfire</a> <font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net">Silver Daggers Homepage</a><font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
