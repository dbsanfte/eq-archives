<br>
Brother Vincent ran past Brother Jamus and spun neatly around to unleash a pointed attack to Brother Jamus' spine, wracking him with pain and slowing his movements.  Brother Jamus spun around quickly, grunting heavily from the effort as he slung his staff at Brother Vincent.  Brother Vincent evaded the blow easily and countered, knocking another grunt of injury from Brother Jamus.  Brother Jamus tried another quick blow at Brother Vincent but Brother Vincent, preparing for a follow-up to his last blow, had moved out of position and Brother Jamus' blow missed it's target as Brother Vincent's landed painfully on Brother Jamus, drawing blood.<br>
<br>
&quot;Watch out, Jamus! Vincent on his game today!&quot; came the cat-call from the sidelines.  The Daggers and other travelers not occupied with essential duties, and as many of the children who could tear themselves away, had gathered to watch the friars work in the new abilites they'd recently learned.<br>
<br>
The sun was exceptionally hot this morning.  Brother Jamus shook the sweat from his eyes as he recovered.  Brother Vincent's face was creased in a tunting grin and, not to be out-done, he returned it.<br>
<br>
Brother Jamus re-gathered his strengh and unleashed a vicious blow at Brother Vincent's head but Brother Vincent evaded and returned a pointed blow aimed for Brother Jamus' exposed leg but Brother Jamus spun to evade using the momentum to land a precisely aimed blow to Brother Vincent's shoulder.  Brother Vincent yelped as lightening fingers of pain exploded out from his wounded shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go Jamus!!&quot; came another yell from the crowd.  &quot;Take him down Vincent!&quot; flew a counter call.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent tried to laugh off the blow and matched Brother Jamus' huge grin as he made a feinted movement then moved to Brother Jamus' side to let fly staggering blow, precisely aimed at the weakest point of the knee joint.  Brother Jamus howled as he felt his leg move unnaturally but moved quickly to try to land a blow of his own.  The swing lacked focus and hit lightly, not disturbing Brother Vincent's plans for a followup to his last technique.  Brother Jamus almost lost his footing as this blow landed but Brother Vincent recovered badly and opened a golden opportunity for the position Brother Jamus was in.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent saw the manuever coming but couldn't counter and Brother Jamus pummeled him in the solar plexus with a focused blow carrying all his weight behind it.  Brother Vincent heard the audible intake of breath from the crowed as he was staggered by the force of the blow, letting out an anguished cry as he spun to take advantage of Brother Jamus' momentum and land an unfocused blow as he moved through.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ouch!  That hurt just watching it,&quot; said one by-stander.  &quot;Aye, that had to hurt,&quot; said another.  &quot;Not as much as that hit Brother Jamus took to his knee,&quot; countered another.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent and Brother Jamus took a breath or two to center themselves before entering the battle again, both grinning wildly, clearly enjoying the workout.  This time they were more evenly matched and both pushing a great deal of pain out of their minds.  They traded blows but Brother Vincent parried and Brother Jamus evaded.  Flows of light swarmed around Brother Jamus as he uttered the word-spell to replenish his energy.  Brother Vincent grined and allowed Brother Jamus the advantage of closure, uttering his endurence replenishment word-spell as he prepared to strike Brother Jamus.  The light-flows had their intended distraction effect and Brother Jamus missed his blow as Brother Vincent's landed strongly.  Brother Jamus muttered a curse under his breath for being taken by such a simple tactic but uttered another word-spell as he moved, quick as lightening, behind Brother Vincent.<br>
<br>
Magic flowed over Brother Jamus' body and the outline of angel's wings could be seen as a Holy Aura covered him and his staff moved with a blur.  Brother Vincent took two blows before he could focus enough to also call a Holy Aura upon himself.  As the magic flowed over him, he unleashed a stunning onslaught on Brother Jamus, only a few blows of which Brother Jamus could evade.  Brother Jamus managed to exploit a weakness in this brutal attack and land a precisely placed and terrifingly painful blow to Brother Vincent's neck.  Only the trained reflexes of a battle hardened friar saved Brother Vincent from certain death but it was certain another blow of that nature would terminate the battle.<br>
<br>
Out of reflex, Brother Vincent had moved to gain distance.  He turned to face Brother Jamus, who's grin was unmistakably (and unabashedly) smug.  Grining wider, Brother Vincent defiantly twirled his staff in a blurred flurish and sprang on Brother Jamus, landing a quick series of hits that brought Brother Jamus nearly to the brink before Brother Jamus could evade and move.<br>
<br>
In great pain and near expiration but none the less committed to the battle, they launched at each other again, each parrying or evading the other or taking small hits of little consequence.  The by-standers were standing on their feet, unabashedly cheering the both on, calls of encouragement and support for both friars were shouted loudly.  Neither Brother Vincent or Brother Jamus heard them, consentrated as they wre on the battle at hand.  Each knowing the next blow could be the last.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent, taking a calculated risk, exposed himself to a blow in hopes it would open an opportunity.  Brother Jamus made a lightening-fast move at the opening as Brother Vincent countered with his.  Brother Jamus' blow landed perfectly and a blinding pain lept through Brother Vincent but Brother Vincent's gamble paid off and his strike thudded home and Brother Jamus had no time to enjoy his successful strike on Brother Vincent.  Brother Jamus hit the ground with a satisfying thump.<br>
<br>
Wild cheering went up for Brother Vincent as he sat on the ground, too tired to even heal himself.  &quot;That was mighty close, Brother Vincent,&quot; Trappist said, casting much-welcomed healing magic on Brother Vincent.  &quot;Aye, very close&quot; Brother Vincent replied, rubbing his neck where Brother Jamus tried to bisect it.<br>
<br>
Brother Jamus stirred as he came-to amid a new cheer that went up in his honor.  He struggled to his feet and bowed to Brother Vincent then sat next to him, letting the effects of the battle wear off as Trappist healed him as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was a hell of a blow you hit me with,&quot; Brother Vincent said.  Brother Jamus chuckled, &quot;Yeah, I just learned that one.  I thought I had you for sure.  And where'd you learn that knee shot?!  I though I was going to have to have a permemant limp.&quot;  Brother Vincent echoed his companion's mirth in his reply, &quot;Oh, just something I picked up at the last Luriball championship.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trappist sat in quiet observation as the two friars traded barbs, insults, and tips.  They were his friends, his guildmates, they'd been with him as he completed an epic task for the realm to commemorate his standing in the realm...yet he still felt a sense of awe and excitement with them, wondering what it would be like when he reached their level of skill and experience.  <br>
<br>
But Trappist was not alone in his admiration.  Watching unseen, another set of eyes came to rest on the trio of friars sitting on the grass in the now-emptying field behind the Library.  The comfort and ease which they talked, the appreciation and admiration they shared for each other -- totally absent of the jockeying that other fighters oft carried -- and the confidence they had in their chosen way of life...it all tugged seductively and compellingly.  Irresistible.  And, minutes later, while the others were breaking their fast, a length of wood was quietly removed from the pile of supplies left near the lathe.  Hefted from hand to hand to field the weight the not-quite-staff was a poor weapon but in those hands a future could be felt.  The hands moved the wood slowly, feeling the weight and movement.  The eyes closed and the mind's eye looked forward, seeing robes and a spinning staff.  When William opened his eyes, they burned with fire...and desire...and purpose. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=14.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=14.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.silverdaggers.net/img/add.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.threadControl?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub15.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="daggersincamelotfrm1">DAoC General<option value="daggersincamelotfrm2">Events<option value="daggersincamelotfrm3">In Game Quests<option value="daggersincamelotfrm4">Trade Skills<option value="daggersincamelotfrm5">Treasury<option value="daggersincamelotfrm10">Around the Campfire<option value="daggersincamelotfrm12">Hibernia Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm14">Midgard Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm15">Albion Class Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm16">Albion Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm17">Game Mechanic Discussions<option value="daggersincamelotfrm18">Officers<option value="daggersincamelotfrm19">Sig Test Site<option value="daggersincamelotfrm21">Application Review<option value="daggersincamelotfrm22">Sponsorship<option value="daggersincamelotfrm23">Announcements<option value="daggersincamelotfrm27">War Room<option value="daggersincamelotfrm28">Policy Discussions<option value="daggersincamelotfrm29">RvR Council<option value="daggersincamelotfrm35">Wine Cellar<option value="daggersincamelotfrm36">Adventuring in the Shrouded Isles</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E6E8fA>- </font><a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot>Daggers in Camelot</a><font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10>Around the Campfire</a> <font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net">Silver Daggers Homepage</a><font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
