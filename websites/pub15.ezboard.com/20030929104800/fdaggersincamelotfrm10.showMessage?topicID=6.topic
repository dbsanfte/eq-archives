<br>
William walked down the corridor with his tray as visions if Friars danced in his head.  He'd never even considered the friar way of life before.  The very few he'd seen in his cloistered life had been portrayed as hooligans barely tolerated by the Church but he'd come to see that this was more the distorted vision of this particular Bishop.  He found them to be more relaxed and at peace with themselves than all but a rare few monks he'd known -- and those had found positions in the Order outside of the hierarchy.  Those with any power always seemed to strive to increase it or were afraid of losing it -- not very meek or humble in William's mind but he dare not speak those thoughts to anyone.<br>
<br>
Upon his rough wooden tray were the refreshments the Bishop always required be brought into his meetings upon the fourth hour of them.  A simple wine and small morsels of meats and cheeses and bread -- the Bishop consistently strove to demonstrate his frugality to his visitors, though few were taken in by the charade.  William hated this singular duty; the Bishop required him to wear his most formal acolyte robes and they were most unsuited to the duties of refreshment service.<br>
<br>
There was one benefit to this responsibility however.  While conversation invariably stopped as he entered, it would often resume as he went about his duty, as he seemed to become invisible the participants.  William was quite keen about this meeting as Brother Vincent was there; he hoped it would prove more interesting than many of the canonical discussions that had recently been the meat of the Bishop's meetings.<br>
<br>
He could hear voices as he approached the guarded door.  The guard, a senior acolyte, knocked on the door at William's approach and opened it for William to enter, closing it behind him.  As the door opened, William was greeted with the Bishop's shrill voice going at full volume.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is an outrage!  An OUTRAGE!&quot; the Bishop shrieked, &quot;An end MUST be put to it, do you hear?&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent noticed William and gave him a wink of greeting before turning his calm gaze back to the enraged Bishop.  &quot;What would you have me do?&quot; he asked, his voice a sea of calm and reason, &quot;Wave my hands and have the Isles disappear?  Ferret out every member of the Guild of Shadows for your inspection?  That's been tried before, you know, and miserably failed.  Or perhaps we could hold an inquisition for each member of the Church?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Bishop turned a shade of red William had never seen before.  His head would explode any moment now, William was certain.  He was just finishing laying out the refreshments and filling goblets when the Bishop let loose.<br>
<br>
Slamming both balled fists into the table, the bishop screamed, &quot;ARE YOU CONDONING THIS ALLIANCE WITH EVIL?!!&quot;  The force of the Bishop's strike upon the table sent morsels of meat and cheese flying and upset goblets.  Unfortunately for William he had just set the Bishop's and Brother Vincent's wine goblet on the table.  The sound of spilled wine running off the table onto the floor followed the outburst.  William noticed Brother Vincent had deftly rescued his wine goblet before it's contents spilled.<br>
<br>
Calmly taking a long draught of wine, before setting the goblet down, Brother Vincent finally calmly intoned, &quot;The realm has accepted the alliance, such is the order of the Crown to honor it.  They seek no alliance with us, they only seek to topple Morganna and preserve their land.  Evil or not, we have little choice in accepting them.  And you know it as well as I.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reason, however, had passed the Bishop by.  &quot;They are evil itself, Friar Vincent!  We will all be cursed because of it.  Evil will spread through Albion until there is nothing left.  They...&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent's sharp voice cut through the Bishop's tirade like a crossbow through armor.  &quot;Evil or not, we can not openly defy the Crown!  That would lead to civil war and the death of Albion.  You are well aware of the position Albion is now in, you know how insecure our borders are, our magic has been compromised, our communication cut, and there are persistent frightening rumors about,&quot; Brother Vincent almost slipped and said something he must not but he recovered quickly, &quot;other elements of our military infrastructure.  Like it or not, the Guild of Shadows has made the alliance and the Crown has accepted it as a fait accompli.  Even the Academy has accepted it.  I don't deny the evil of Arawn nor do I turn a blind eye it but the Inconnu are a slave race, ripe for conversion if the Church would pay attention, and at the moment we will not survive without them.<br>
<br>
&quot;We've brought you evidence of other races joining our enemy and they bring with them powerful abilities we've never seen.  The Crown can not afford to turn away any source of abilities or numbers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Even so, I've been the Church's agent in this matter. The Crown would have to see treachery and close the portal to the Isles.  We have laid the foundation for that but at every turn we are blunted in it's advancement by sheer common sense,&quot; Brother Vincent finished.<br>
<br>
The Bishop sat heavily, his bluster gone.  He looked suddenly old and frail.  William, taking his time cleaning up the spilled wine, wondered at it.  It wasn't something he would have thought possible.<br>
<br>
&quot;Friar Vincent,&quot; he said in a tired voice, &quot;This is the dispatch I received today.  It was included in a routine dispatch upon realm security.  You can read the Latin I expect.&quot;  With this he handed a piece of paper to Brother Vincent.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent read it carefully.  Then read it again.  He let out a sigh of concern and placed his hand upon the table still holding the note and staring at it.  He took another deep breath before he continued and looked at the Bishop.  &quot;Do they truly believe we have a traitor in the Church?&quot; he asked, echoing the Bishop's worry.<br>
<br>
&quot;That they do,&quot; the Bishop said heavily, &quot;Though they are not sure if the traitor is loyal to the Crown or the Morganna but the effect is the same.  Morganna openly decries it but secretly hopes the alliance with the Inconnu will weaken us, and I believe it will.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent seemed lost in thought.  &quot;What would you have me do?&quot; he asked the Bishop, all contention between them gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have been instructed to give you every assistance and to release you from all other duties.  You are to find the traitor by any means necessary.  I received a dispatch from the Crown today as well.  The Crown has released the members of your guild they could spare from their assignments and are having them assemble here under a number of pretexts.  The Crown was told the Church has received information about a secret plot to capture this Abby and other land inside our borders with the help of spies.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whoever this traitor is, they must be stopped, Vincent,&quot; the Bishop said, staring at the floor, his voice carrying a hint of fear and desperation.  Noticing as if for the first time the full wine goblet, grasped it warmly and drained it.  William, having just finished his cleaning up immediately refilled the Bishop's wine.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent felt a pang of sympathy for the old man.  He was a blustering old fool but he knew his limitations and when all the steam had vented, he truly did care for the Church and the Realm.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will do what I can,&quot; Brother Vincent said earnestly.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent and William exchanged meaningful glances.  The acolyte no longer seemed so young and there was a fire set alight in his eyes.  Brother Vincent felt a kindred spirit in that moment.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent stood and collected his satchel and left the room quietly as William filled the Bishop's wine goblet once more. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.silverdaggers.net/img/add.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.threadControl?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub15.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="daggersincamelotfrm1">DAoC General<option value="daggersincamelotfrm2">Events<option value="daggersincamelotfrm3">In Game Quests<option value="daggersincamelotfrm4">Trade Skills<option value="daggersincamelotfrm5">Treasury<option value="daggersincamelotfrm10">Around the Campfire<option value="daggersincamelotfrm12">Hibernia Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm14">Midgard Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm15">Albion Class Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm16">Albion Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm17">Game Mechanic Discussions<option value="daggersincamelotfrm18">Officers<option value="daggersincamelotfrm19">Sig Test Site<option value="daggersincamelotfrm21">Application Review<option value="daggersincamelotfrm22">Sponsorship<option value="daggersincamelotfrm23">Announcements<option value="daggersincamelotfrm27">War Room<option value="daggersincamelotfrm28">Policy Discussions<option value="daggersincamelotfrm29">RvR Council<option value="daggersincamelotfrm35">Wine Cellar<option value="daggersincamelotfrm36">Adventuring in the Shrouded Isles</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E6E8fA>- </font><a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot>Daggers in Camelot</a><font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10>Around the Campfire</a> <font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net">Silver Daggers Homepage</a><font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
