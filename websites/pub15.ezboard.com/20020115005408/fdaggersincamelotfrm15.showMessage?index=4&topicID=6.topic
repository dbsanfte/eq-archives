<br>
I have several questions for you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I have gotten my cleric to nearly level 10 and haven't done too much research, not as much as I should have at least.  However I thought I would ask a few questions here first before getting lost in the infinite number of cleric boards and posts.  I hope you don't mind and please don't spend any more time than you have.  Ok here goes:<br>
<br>
1. Spec points: My thoughts right now are to spec heavily in Rejuv, some in Smite and none in Enchantment.  I want to really be the best I can at Rejuv however I want to be able to still solo when I need to.  I really don't see the benifit of Enchantment.  The only line I see being worth anything is the regen line, but I can't see going past level 10, which gives 3 hp/tick. I wonder is the 3hp really worth anything at higher levels so as of now I am thinking of not putting any points in Enchantment.  Also the duel buffs you get in enchament don't seem worth it since they take twice the concentration since they are duel, but they will be less effective if my skill level is not near my character level.  Comments?  What is your take?<br>
<br>
2. Stuns: hardly use them, when i have needed them is when I have been in a group, in which case we are ususally fighting oranges, reds and purples.  Every time I have tried they have been resisted, so they seem useless.  What has been your experience.<br>
<br>
3. Area Mez: seems great but haven't used it much since kinda like stuns seems to be resisited.  But to be honest I didn't realize it was a shout until recently so I haven't used it much.  Will try though.  What has been your experience, especially against oranges and higher?<br>
<br>
4.Healing: I have been waiting a bit and then throw on a bigger heal as compared to throwing on smaller heals.  In one of your posts you recommend using smaller heals.  Do you still recommend this?  One reason I like bigger heals is so I can sit between heals.  Unfortunately unlike EQ bigger heals aren' any more efficient hp/power wise, so maybe I shouldn't be using them.<br>
<br>
5. Melee &amp; Smiting: I have been almost always staying out of  melee, unless the mob is on me, its the last one, and its almost dead.  If the mob is yellow or blue I will smite early in the fight before the heals are needed, but otherwise I hold my power for heals.  Do you find anytime you use and are able to land DD on oranges and higher?  Wondering if my smite skill is too low.  However I had it at level 5 (+2 smite bonus, so equal to level 7) when I was level 8, and still had troubles landing spells on orange/red/purple mobs.  Again just curious on how you play your cleric in group situations<br>
<br>
6. Run vs Log: I have seen posts about running away when things get bad so you can rez.  Which I understand and plan to do.  I have also seen people talk about camping out.  Now that DAoC has it so you stay in game for 45 sec once you go LD and camping takes 20 to 30 sec which I assume can get interupted, is it feasible?  I guess if you can't run (in dungon), then its your only choice.  Just wondering what methods you have used.<br>
<br>
7. Boxers or Briefs?<br>
<br>
If you gotten this far thanks for reading <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I am sure I will have more questions in the future, however these are a few on the top of my head.  Any advice you can give is greatly appreciated.  I never played a cleric (or druid, shaman, paladin) past level 15 in EQ so this is all relatively new to me.  However I must say I am really enjoying playing a man of the cloth.  Thanks again.<br>
