A great deal of this will apply to all classes, as DAoC characters are class/skill driven rather than just class driven.<br>
<br>
Clerics, like the other classes, can take a variety of forms. Some things every cleric will have in common. <br>
<br>
They may be using a mace or a hammer, but their melee skills will be roughly equal regardless. Are they the &quot;equal&quot; of an Armsman? In melee damage over time, no, they are not. They are, however, effective melee fighters none the less. At level 22, my beta cleric actually did *more* damage per hit than some of the Paladins I grouped with (the ones using 1h weapons). The Paladin's styles added different things that I could not add (damage, taunt, etc) but straight up whacking, my hammer outdamaged their sword every time. So, while not the best, don't discount the cleric's melee skills. Late in a fight and out of power, I have seen the cleric's melee skills turn defeat into victory more than once (yes, this is a last ditch effort when running is not an option or when another rezer has already cleared the area and is safe).<br>
<br>
Another commonality is protection. Clerics get nothing better than chainmail armor, which is the third best available (I believe scaled and plate are both superior). They also have medium shields available to them. Like melee, the shield skill is not trainable so they get no shield styles. They are, however, quite adept at blocking. Again, can they stand in like an Armsman? No way. Clerics will take the same damage as the chainmailed Armsman, but the Armsman will have far more hit points to give and thus much better durability when being hit. Thus, clerics are not fragile finger wagglers, but niether are they tanks. Put them in the category of &quot;It's okay to take a few hits, but either kill it quick or taunt it off fairly soon or things will start to get ugly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Having established that clerics are not fragile and are mediocre meleers, we get to the meat of the class, and the factor that differentiates one cleric from another. Their magical abilities.<br>
<br>
Here is where the cleric you just invited to your group becomes an unknown. There are two basic types, and literally dozens of permutations on those types.<br>
<br>
The Healing Cleric. The healing cleric is speced in Rejuvination, with strong Enhancement skills as well. He has the best and most varied selection of heals available in the realm (and the game, actually.. clerics surpass Druids and Healers in this capacity). Typically, if he's an accomplished healer, he will start healing early in the fight using low level heals to stay ahead of the damage being taken. If things get a little rough it's no problem. Throughout his development, the healing cleric gains progressively more potent abilities that allow him to heal an Armsman of a similar level from near death to well over half health in a single shot. He also has group heals of various levels, which are useful during 'furballs'. In short, the healing cleric is very capable of keeping you healthy in even the hardest fight, so long as it doesn't drag out too long. In this respect, if in no other, the DAoC cleric is comparable to the EQ cleric. A good healing cleric will stand at the start of the fight and remain well back from the melee group. He will heal until he's out of power, then make his decision whether to run, fight or sit. <br>
<br>
The healing cleric also has some offensive casting ability. Even with only minimal training, the offensive abilities gained through leveling keep the healing cleric able to deal effective damage through casting, though nowhere near the damage a pure caster can dish out. Additionally, he will have stuns and his instant cast, AE mez ability.<br>
<br>
The Smiting Cleric. This is a different animal altogether from the healing cleric. The smiting cleric has put most of his training into his offensive skills. The Smite speced cleric has damage casting abilities only slightly inferior to a well-speced Wizard, but with the melee and armor skills described earlier. He also has a variety of damage lines to choose from based on the situation, with all of them vastly superior to a healing cleric's. It's been said that a smite cleric is the most powerful solo class in the realm because of this unique mix of powerful magic and average melee abilities. In a group, the smite cleric is nowhere near the healer that a healing cleric is. Instead, he adds potent offense to the group, with an ability to heal that is virtually the same as the Friar's. A skilled smiting cleric will not try to tank for the group, but niether will he hold back on his damage output for fear of agro the way a good caster will. From what I've seen, a good smite cleric will step into the mix at the start of the fight and use his mez to freeze adds. He will then step back and begin casting damage spells. If he draws agro or runs out of power he will step back in and melee, running only if no other rezer has been able to move a safe distance away.<br>
<br>
Does this mean avoid grouping with smiting clerics? Absolutely not! It does mean find out up front what you're getting when you group a cleric. Are you adding offensive or defensive abilities to your group? Don't make the mistake of thinking you can put a smite cleric into the role of primary group healer and he will be as effective as a healing cleric. He won't. He's an offensive fighter, not a healer. If you must use a smite cleric as your main healer simply look at it as though you have a Friar as your main healer. He can do it, but like the Friar, it's not what he does best.<br>

Is he a worse tank than the paladin but a better healer? Or is he a better tank than the cleric and a worse healer? It sounds like his capabilities are to melee AND heal with the capability that is a mid point between paladins and clerics. <br>
<br>
What kind of mez line does the cleric get? <br>

I think the Friar is kinda like an EQ monk with heals.  Or something like that.  They get Evade III (Insane dodge ability) and good melee skills, but not so good armor.  Some heals, I think rez as well.<br>
<br>
I'm not really sure though.<br>

They are superior healers to Paladins, roughly equal in melee ability and less than equal in tanking ability... their superior Evade ability doesn't quite compensate for a tank classe's much superior armor. Friars can only wear leather armor. For comparison, think EQ Monk with Greater Heal. For their healing, I'd suggest using the old EQ Druid/Shaman/Cleric formula... 2 Friars or a Friar and a Smite Cleric = 1 Healing Cleric.<br>
<br>
The Cleric mez (Heavenly Visions) is an insta-cast, point-blank AE mez. It has the same duration as the Sorcerer mez, but is also on a timer that is longer than the duration. Thus, the cleric can mez several adds, but they'll be free before he's able to renew the mez on them. It's extremely effective when you're using a main tank who is able to immediately draw agro from all the mobs... a Paladin using the Refresh chant, for example. The cleric can step close to the Paladin, mez the adds, then step back and heal or cast while the group assists on the Paladin. If timed correctly, when the mez wears off the mobs will attack the Paladin again, not go after the cleric that mezed them. Several seconds later, the cleric's mez timer will finish and if needed he can try to re-mez. The mez uses no, or at least virtually no, power to cast.<br>

<br>
I have several questions for you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I have gotten my cleric to nearly level 10 and haven't done too much research, not as much as I should have at least.  However I thought I would ask a few questions here first before getting lost in the infinite number of cleric boards and posts.  I hope you don't mind and please don't spend any more time than you have.  Ok here goes:<br>
<br>
1. Spec points: My thoughts right now are to spec heavily in Rejuv, some in Smite and none in Enchantment.  I want to really be the best I can at Rejuv however I want to be able to still solo when I need to.  I really don't see the benifit of Enchantment.  The only line I see being worth anything is the regen line, but I can't see going past level 10, which gives 3 hp/tick. I wonder is the 3hp really worth anything at higher levels so as of now I am thinking of not putting any points in Enchantment.  Also the duel buffs you get in enchament don't seem worth it since they take twice the concentration since they are duel, but they will be less effective if my skill level is not near my character level.  Comments?  What is your take?<br>
<br>
2. Stuns: hardly use them, when i have needed them is when I have been in a group, in which case we are ususally fighting oranges, reds and purples.  Every time I have tried they have been resisted, so they seem useless.  What has been your experience.<br>
<br>
3. Area Mez: seems great but haven't used it much since kinda like stuns seems to be resisited.  But to be honest I didn't realize it was a shout until recently so I haven't used it much.  Will try though.  What has been your experience, especially against oranges and higher?<br>
<br>
4.Healing: I have been waiting a bit and then throw on a bigger heal as compared to throwing on smaller heals.  In one of your posts you recommend using smaller heals.  Do you still recommend this?  One reason I like bigger heals is so I can sit between heals.  Unfortunately unlike EQ bigger heals aren' any more efficient hp/power wise, so maybe I shouldn't be using them.<br>
<br>
5. Melee &amp; Smiting: I have been almost always staying out of  melee, unless the mob is on me, its the last one, and its almost dead.  If the mob is yellow or blue I will smite early in the fight before the heals are needed, but otherwise I hold my power for heals.  Do you find anytime you use and are able to land DD on oranges and higher?  Wondering if my smite skill is too low.  However I had it at level 5 (+2 smite bonus, so equal to level 7) when I was level 8, and still had troubles landing spells on orange/red/purple mobs.  Again just curious on how you play your cleric in group situations<br>
<br>
6. Run vs Log: I have seen posts about running away when things get bad so you can rez.  Which I understand and plan to do.  I have also seen people talk about camping out.  Now that DAoC has it so you stay in game for 45 sec once you go LD and camping takes 20 to 30 sec which I assume can get interupted, is it feasible?  I guess if you can't run (in dungon), then its your only choice.  Just wondering what methods you have used.<br>
<br>
7. Boxers or Briefs?<br>
<br>
If you gotten this far thanks for reading <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I am sure I will have more questions in the future, however these are a few on the top of my head.  Any advice you can give is greatly appreciated.  I never played a cleric (or druid, shaman, paladin) past level 15 in EQ so this is all relatively new to me.  However I must say I am really enjoying playing a man of the cloth.  Thanks again.<br>
