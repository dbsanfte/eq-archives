<br>
As the Bishop tried to regain his equanimity, Brother Vincent rounded up men from the travelers to bind the bodies of the unconscious brigands.  He found among them four low-level frontier guards-in-training just returning from their first posting and, while not guards of the realm yet, they were certainly capable of taking a few chained and properly subdued ruffians back to Camelot for adjudication.  They exchanged guilty looks at each other and averted their eyes from Brother Vincent, feeling the coward as they had not stayed at the door and fought but had instead moved with the other merchants and refugees.  Brother Vincent held back a smile at their discomfort, remembering his first taste of combat, knowing that had they tried to help that they would only have been under foot.  They had, in fact, been a great help in calming the excited refugees for while the frontier merchants were no strangers to heavy combat, the others were possessed with the greatest fright and the sight of uniforms, even of trainees, was of comfort.<br>
<br>
&quot;They will be bound in heavy chains locked with dispatch keys.  So bound, they will be of little trouble to you on the journey to Camelot,&quot; Brother Vincent finished in is instructions to them and, taking pity on their self-recrimination, continued, &quot;But even so, keep your wits about you, as you did here.  Not many would have had to good sense to help those people remain calm but would have tried to remain and fight in foolish hubris and gotten themselves or someone else killed.  Knowing the limits of your skill is the first rule of survival.&quot;<br>
<br>
At Brother Vincent's words they visibly brightened.  Self-confidence mostly restored, they vowed to set out immediately with their wards and went to ready their captives.  Brother Vincent was confident they would have no trouble with their catch who were already visibly cowed at their predicament.<br>
<br>
Brother Jamus could be seen helping setup temporary shelter for the refugees near the north side of the Abby near the monks' living accommodations, the ground there being rarely traveled and having grass upon the ground rather than the thick mud that formed after heavy rains like the previous evening's.  They would be given quarter here until forces from Camelot could be raised to make their homes safe again.  The merchants, for their parts, were talking with the quartermaster for the Abby, ever eager to make the best of a bad situation -- especially if there was profit in it.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent went to check on the captives -- downtrodden and covered in muck and mud, they looked as ready as any who were about to being their march to their trial in the Capital city -- and to wish their guards a safe journey once again.  <br>
<br>
As the Abby door was opened, the sound of a horse written in earnest were heard.  A tired and travel-stained figure rode the horse at full gallop right through the open doors and, due to the mud of the well traveled entry, had a great deal of trouble slowing down.  The figure dismounted in haste, taking little notice of the heavy mud that sprayed upon his garments and hurried to one of the two door guards.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent bid the guards-in-training a safe journey and reminded the captives of the perils that would face them, so chained hand and foot and one to another, should they attempt to thwart their guards in their duty, explaining that each lock was secured with a dispatch key which would remain in the Abby and who's only twin was in Camelot.  He further admonished them to avoid trying to break their chains or pick their locks, as each was of an enchanted material and a magic thing broken unleashed a hellish force and would surely be a most painful death for them and an unpleasant experience for those that survived, who would be chained to rotting corpses -- the possibility that it was a bluff was lost upon them.<br>
<br>
So charged, the guards mounted their borrowed horses and prodded their walking charges into motion.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent saw a door guard upon his platform, leaning down to speak to the recently arrived rider and in a heated conversation when saw the guard point to him.  The rider broke away moved toward him at a brisk pace.  He walked toward the rider to discover what could be so important.<br>
<br>
The wiry young man had a dirty face and long unwashed hair caked with sweat and the grime of travel and wore chain armor that was made for a fuller man but his gaze was an old one, full of steel.  When he spoke, his voice was brisk, steady and commanding, &quot;You are Brother Vincent?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am,&quot; Brother Vincent replied quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;The will of a king is precious and fair,&quot; he said, and waited.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent tensed, recognizing the sign/counter-sign.  He replied, &quot;Truth is at its core.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ten years upon the moor teaches nothing,&quot; the rider replied.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent completed the counter-sign:  &quot;Except that the sun sets as often as it rises.&quot;<br>
<br>
The rider thrust a sealed box into Brother Vincent's hands and asked another question, &quot;The Bishop is here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Brother Vincent replied, distracted and anxious about his unexpected package.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will summon him,&quot; came the quick reply. &quot;Now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent knew the importance of this dispatch rider for few could carry the package he had received.  &quot;Follow me,&quot; he said and moved with a sense of urgency across the courtyard to find the Bishop.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Having delivered the rider to the Bishop's stone out-building, he left him to his job and moved quickly to find a private place to open his dispatch -- the stables were closest. Upon the hayloft of the stable, concealed from sight, he spoke the words of a de-locking spell and inserted his key.  Before turning it, he spoke another de-locking spell and turned the key with a shaking hand.  Before opening, he spoke a third and final de-locking spell and heard a faint click.<br>
<br>
Now unlocked, he steeled himself and opened the box.  In it was a small piece of paper, folded into quarters.  Upon opening, he read:  I have done as you have asked, now do as I have commanded you!  Brother Vincent let out a sigh of relief...tempered by apprehension.  Withdrawing a writing implement from the small box he wrote upon the note, 'I have lain the ground work and will now send word for the completion of your command -- though we will all pay a blood price for it.  If your agents were successful, I will soon be sent upon that other matter.  Pray our information is wrong and your treachery will not doom us further.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent folded the note and placed it and the writing implement back in the box and performed the sequence of key movements and locking spells to fully secure the dispatch.  Thrusting the box into his robes he quitted the stables and returned to the courtyard to seek the dispatch rider.  He found him easily enough as beside the stable brushing his de-saddled horse as it munched greedily upon a small mound of hay.<br>
<br>
Without turning he said to Brother Vincent, &quot;You have a return dispatch?&quot;  &quot;Yes,&quot; Brother Vincent replied but did not hand it to the rider.  Momentarily the rider looked up and flashed a brief smile, &quot;The Bishop never replies quickly...or concisely.  I'll have time to rest my horse, have a bath, a hot meal, and brief repose before he's through.&quot;  Brother Vincent smiled in return but with little feeling.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have another dispatch I must send...securely,&quot; Brother Vincent said quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, I was told that you might,&quot; said the rider as he rifled through his saddle bags.  Standing, he handed a worn black case to Brother Vincent.  &quot;I was given another case for your second message but you have a look about you that tells me I am going to go through the bowels of hell to deliver it.  That dispatch case is well over four hundred years old and has never been broken despite being hostilely captured a number of times.  The blood of many of my family is on it, Brother Vincent, and perhaps mine will be too, but your message and its recipient will remain safe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent had grown accustomed to dispatch boxes of late but his was of a design he'd never seen.  It was smaller than the usual dispatch box, a deep brown with dark red stains over a fine latice-work of lines that sparkled with very tiny bursts of red or gold light when tilted just so toward the sun.  It felt sturdy but something about it just seemed...very old.<br>
<br>
It opened easily and paper was already within it.  Brother Vincent withdrew the pen from the box but did not open the small inkwell.  Instead he moved his glove to expose his wrist and bit into it with the sharp head of the pen, drawing a small upwelling of blood.  Using this as ink, he wrote but a single word up on the paper and placed it back in the dispatch box as he whispered a very small healing spell sufficient for the tiny wound.  He closed the dispatch box and was about to ask how to seal it when he felt himself go deaf and the world go very dark.  &quot;To whom am I to be delivered?&quot; he heard a raspy voice ask.  Startled he looked around but, in the darkness, he saw the rider smiling at him, almost laughing.  Brother Vincent guessed that this was part of the security spell.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent answered that question and several more as the box inquired about it's destination and recipient.  As soon as he had finished, the black cylinder around him dissipated and he felt immense energy tighten around the box.<br>
<br>
Still smiling, the rider took the box from Brother Vincent, saying, &quot;It's a little strange, isn't it?&quot;  Brother Vincent nodded.  &quot;Well you'll find no more secure message in all the realms, that much I guarantee you.  Do you have the other dispatch box?&quot;  Brother Vincent withdrew it from his robes and handed it to the rider who placed both lovingly in his saddle bag.  As he stood back, he spoke softly some words and made a circling motion.  A soft pink light appeared in a sphere around the bag and slowly shrank to take on the form of the saddlebag...then vanished.  &quot;Well if you'll excuse me, Brother Vincent,&quot; the rider said brightly, &quot;I'm going to see about that bath and hot meal.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The future is written with the ink of our actions.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Brother Vincent wondered as he watched the dispatch rider go about his business.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>My God...what I have set in motion.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  He looked at the place the small wound was only moments before and wondered how much &quot;ink&quot; was left in him.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent went to see about his meeting with the Bishop but, as the rider has suspected, he was busy having a lengthy reply written and would not be disturbed.  Being somewhat after mid-day, Brother Vincent considered having a light meal but the news he had received had unsettled him too much to dine.  So instead, he went to see how Brother Jamus and the refugees were getting on.  <br>
<br>
He crossed the compound with the weight of the world on his shoulders but soon after talking to a few of the refugees he found himself with a more pressing decision to make:  to help cook for thirty people or help unload carts of heavy sacks grain.  Wishing to help with the hardest work, he decided it was time he learned how to bake bread.<br>
<br>
The afternoon hours passed pleasantly listening to the women's talk about their children, grousing lovingly about their husbands, correcting something he was cooking wrong, listening to Brother Jamus shout a few friendly jibs his direction, and having the woman grow frustrated with his farcical attempts at &quot;helping&quot; and moving him on to something they thought he could cause less trouble with -- which eventually led to him being told to go carry some grain sacks and get out of their hair (luckily all the grain had been stored by this point).<br>
<br>
He found Brother Jamus lying in the late afternoon shade of some hay bails with the cowl of his cloak rolled up as a pillow beneath his head, hands folded across his chest.  He spoke without opening his eyes as Brother Vincent approached.  &quot;Schooled as a acolyte, trained as a friar, battle hardened on the frontier, thousands of bounty markers for killing the enemy, all for what?  To learn how to bake bread?&quot; he teased.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent sat down heavily beside him, leaning against a hay bail.  &quot;Hardly!&quot; he replied in the same vain, &quot;That concoction I made could be mistaken for a ballista round before it'd be confused with bread!&quot;  They both shared the laugh of tired men.  <br>
<br>
Brother Vincent laid back comfortably, pulling the cowl of his robe over his eyes as Brother Jamus asked, &quot;Did you find out what the Bishop wanted with you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The cenobitical windbag of the frontier?  No, not yet.  He was working on an illuminated manuscript in reply to a dispatch, the last I saw,&quot; Brother Vincent replied, thinking an afternoon nap was indeed a worthwhile use of his time on earth.<br>
<br>
Brother Jamus let out a soft chuckle, &quot;I loved the way his eyes widened when you thumped that clod on the forehead,&quot; Brother Jamus' said as the chuckles became stronger, &quot;That was just priceless.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent smiled, &quot;Mmmmmm, yes, that was rather priceless, wasn't it?  Not often you see the wind taken out of his sails.&quot;<br>
<br>
They sat in silence for a while, a comfortable silence shared by good friends.  Brother Vincent, thinking of the morning's events, said, &quot;I ran across an acolyte today by the name of William.  He's sharp and restrained, has good reflexes too.  He'd make a good friar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You give him your speech?&quot; Brother Jamus asked, sleepily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heh, no, didn't have time.  Some damn friar interrupted me with a raucous bunch of hooligans,&quot; Brother Vincent chuckled.<br>
<br>
Brother Jamus picked up his staff and swatted Brother Vincent before they both broke out in laughter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brother Vincent...,&quot; a soft male voice intoned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Brother William?&quot; Brother Vincent replied, still laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid the Bishop wants to see you now,&quot; he said, feeling sorry for his friend.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Brother William,&quot; Brother Vincent said as he stood and shook his cloak to throw off the stray straw that clung to it.  He started to walk off then turned and handed his well-carved staff to William and whispered, &quot;Here, hit Brother Jamus with this a few times, he deserves it.&quot;  William grinned and nodded conspiratorially.<br>
<br>
Brother Vincent was rewarded a few seconds later with the sound of a startled Brother Jamus yelping as he was playfully thwapped by William.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverdaggers.net/sigs/vincent1a.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=7.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=7.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.silverdaggers.net/img/add.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.threadControl?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub15.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="daggersincamelotfrm1">DAoC General<option value="daggersincamelotfrm2">Events<option value="daggersincamelotfrm3">In Game Quests<option value="daggersincamelotfrm4">Trade Skills<option value="daggersincamelotfrm5">Treasury<option value="daggersincamelotfrm10">Around the Campfire<option value="daggersincamelotfrm12">Hibernia Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm14">Midgard Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm15">Albion Class Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm16">Albion Realm Discussion<option value="daggersincamelotfrm17">Game Mechanic Discussions<option value="daggersincamelotfrm18">Officers<option value="daggersincamelotfrm19">Sig Test Site<option value="daggersincamelotfrm21">Application Review<option value="daggersincamelotfrm22">Sponsorship<option value="daggersincamelotfrm23">Announcements<option value="daggersincamelotfrm27">War Room<option value="daggersincamelotfrm28">Policy Discussions<option value="daggersincamelotfrm29">RvR Council<option value="daggersincamelotfrm35">Wine Cellar<option value="daggersincamelotfrm36">Adventuring in the Shrouded Isles</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E6E8fA>- </font><a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot>Daggers in Camelot</a><font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm10>Around the Campfire</a> <font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><a href="http://www.silverdaggers.net">Silver Daggers Homepage</a><font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
