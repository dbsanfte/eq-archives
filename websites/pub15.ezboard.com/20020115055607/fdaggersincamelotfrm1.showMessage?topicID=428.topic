I know that many classes are suffering in one way or another and I certainly don't support alot of what is in the article, however pretty much the list I supplied our TL is exactly what has been placed in her report.<br>
<br>
This is what I suggested, her report follows:<br>
<br>
Dulcette<br>
If you are compiling information then here is my list from a level 34 Minstrel, who basically enjoys her character very much. <br>
<br>
1) get rid of the swirling notes. They were a nice addition and looked real cute until we realized they are basically a big old bullseye with our name on it in RVR <br>
<br>
2) increase DD in one of two ways. Either greater damage or longer range. Preferabbly, I would enjoy a DD that has a medium to long range cast and I will accept the output they do. <br>
<br>
3) make Stealth actually useful to us. Provide us some sort of skill in it. <br>
<br>
4) THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. We have been on the list of things they know about regarding instrument increase, since the Camelot Herald came out. This is a basic feature of any character and all other characters get increases to their skills by adding items, with the exception of bards and minstrels. I am suspecting that they really don't know what benefit increasing instruments should provide us, therefore that is why they have not implemented it. Instrument increase should allow a percentage increase for each instrument skill point to the already existing numbers. i.e. drum would allow a percentage increase per instrument skill amount over your level for power. If you are level 34, with a 33 instrument skill and you have an item that adds 2 instruments, then the % of power is increased by 2 for every pulse whether sitting, standing or fighting). Hopefully that made sense. (i.e. flute - if you have an increase of 2 in instruments, then the mez will stick for 2% longer than the basic amount it should have). And lutes, well we all know those are completely useless in 95% of the cases after you reach level 20. However, the same theory could be applied to them. <br>
<br>
5) Lastly, we need more charisma/power items. <br>
<br>
I don't agree with the statement we have nothing to look forward to past 20. We certainly do, we just need an increase in some of our basics, still keeping us as a support class. At times, I truly believe that to Mythic we are a non-entity class to them. An afterthought. Some very basic changes would at least make me believe Mythic sees us as a viable class in game (power items and instrument skill increase). <br>

Minstrel Report 01/05/2002 <br>
<br>
Summary of Points <br>
<br>
1. Instruments do not give their +instrument bounuses <br>
2. Lack of +CHA items creates a two fold problem. The mana pool for minstrels is very small and resists are higher. <br>
3. Swirling notes create a bull’s eye target on minstrels in RvR <br>
4. Being a rogue hampers the minstrel more than it aids. <br>
5. Damage output vs. “tankability” is not balanced at higher levels <br>
6. Lack of minstrel specific loot. <br>
7. Dearth of songs/shouts <br>
8. Minstrels should be Armor crafters <br>
<br>
New songs and shouts <br>
<br>
Song of Endruance <br>
Mournful Lament <br>
Song of the Clouds <br>
Fear shout <br>
Curdling Screech <br>
Dances – Toe Twister <br>
Whirling Dervish <br>
Quickstep <br>
(explanations within the report) <br>
<br>
<br>
Explanation of Points <br>
<br>
It is a known issue that instruments are not giving their +instrument bonuses. It is understood that people are working on this. However, there is a further problem with +instrument items. They aren’t particularly worthwhile. Most songs like Motivational Anthem and Song of Power won’t be affected by the +instrument. You aren’t going to run faster nor is power going to be regenerated more quickly. The only potential bonus of +instruments is perhaps resistance checks for Commanding Cadence and Alluring Melodies. Similarly there need to be more high level instruments. By level 50 the highest known instrument is green. In addition it would be nice if there could be player crafted instruments. It has been suggested that perhaps it could be a part of spell crafting. <br>
<br>
<br>
While instruments may not be giving their intended +instrument bonuses, very few items give +Charisma at all. The first result of this is that minstrels end up with very small power pools. At higher levels a minstrel often uses up all her power before a fight is over. The actual bonuses of Charisma are hotly debated. However, if it is true that charisma helps govern reisits for the minstrel, then by having a lower charisma the minstrel is hampered. By level 30 almost all chain armor had +Piety bonuses but almost none has +CHA. Many minstrels end up with very high piety though their armor even though that stat has nothing to do with them. Possible soloutions to this are to either put minstrel armor into the game (preferred) or at least add +CHA to existing chain armor drops. <br>
<br>
<br>
Minstrels are currently asking that the swirling note effects of their songs be removed in RvR. This effect makes the minstrel stick out like Christmas lights in July. Now granted casters have similar effects for their spells, however, if they aren’t casting a spell the effect does not go off. Similarly, if a Paladin uses a chant the effect happens once, but does not continue on for the duration the chant is used. Perhaps the notes could be changed so that in the frontier zone they only swirl when the song is started, just like for a caster or Paladin. Or perhaps the minstrel could just chose to not have the notes on. A side effect of the notes is that in 1st person view the create an annoying green/blue light across the screen. It would be nice if that could be turned off, or at the very least lower the swirling notes so that they don’t bother the 1st person view player. <br>
<br>
<br>
A very touchy subject is the fact that the minstrel gets all the negatives of being a rogue without the positives. The supposed defining skill of the rogue is stealth however minstrel stealth is pathetic. There are very few reasons for the minstrel to put points into it. As a minstrel needs to keep their instrument and melee skills high that leaves only a few left over for stealth. However, a minstrel who sacrifices other skills in favor of stealth quickly learns that he does not get a speed increase as he raises his level, he does not get detect hidden, he does not get sense danger, yet he still finds that opposing thieves and archers see through his stealth. In addition said minstrel finds that he can not use his minstrel skills while stealthed. No songs may be active while stealthed, so in effect a minstrel can not be both rogue and a minstrel a the same time. This is unlike the scout and the infiltrator who can use Stealth to augment their critical strike abilities. The minstrel (unlike any other rogue) does not have a critical strike ability. <br>
<br>
In addition to getting very little out of stealth the minstrel is hampered by low hit points and low strength. As the minstrel is supposed to be a tank this combination becomes increasingly difficult as the minstrel levels. Unlike other tanks (Champion excluded) the minstrel’s Constitution does not raise as he levels and therefore does not the added hit points this gives a tank. Thus at higher levels say 35+ minstrels begin to get chewed up quickly by monsters and post 40 they are no longer able to tank. In addition as the minstrel does not get STR raised as she levels melee output is always very low. The direct damage shouts are supposed to make up for this, however, at higher levels the damage output of shouts isn’t enough to compensate for the weak melee and the low hit points. Either the damage of the direct damage shouts needs to be raised a bit, or melee damage needs to be raised a bit. Perhaps to help raise melee the minstrel could have a self only + str buff to raise damage output that lasted 4 minutes or so. <br>
<br>
By level 40 there is very little a minstrel does well. Sorcerers and cleric stun and mes better than a minstrel. Paladins and Armsmen tank better than a minstrel. This leaves the minstrel to be a taxi and mana whore. Many people are finding that there is really no reason to level a minstrel higher than 44. At that point you can get the highest DD shout so they stop there. The minstrel needs something to give them more of an active role later in life. <br>
<br>
<br>
There is very little in the way of minstrel specific loot. It would be nice to see high level minstrel armor drop. I would suggest some minstrel weapons with +dex and +str. A rare drop could have +str + hp and +cha. That would help the minstrel a ton. I can’t stress this enough. Minstrels need more loot and especially loot with +cha. <br>
<br>
There have been many good suggestions for new minstrel songs. Here are some of them: <br>
1. Song of endurance - raises endurance just like song of power or song of healing <br>
2. Mournful Lament – This is such a sad song that it makes any person/mob within hearing distance cry. Their tears glitter in the night and thus illuminates all bodies within a certain radius. This would be good for seeing in the night and spotting hidden people in rvr (not stealthed, hidden behind trees and such) <br>
3. Song of the Clouds – this would create a “fog of war” around the party. This would be good for RvR. The enemy would know a group is coming, but they wouldn’t know how many people are in that group. <br>
4. Fear shout – repels mobs for X seconds <br>
5. at higher levels (around 40 or so) a combo power + health song becomes available <br>
6. curdling screech – causes the target to go blind for X seconds <br>
7. Dances: Toe twister – trips up the opponent <br>
Whirling dervish – drains away endurance from opponent <br>
Quickstep – group haste <br>
<br>
Song of Healing needs to have its power output upped. Currently this is a worthless song. It needs to heal more. That’s the bottom line. <br>
<br>
Charm has problems. Hunters have permanently charmed pets. Why can’t the minstrel? It is understood that Charm has known problems and will at some point change. It is suggested that the pet should stay charmed until death. Charm as it is is workable but clunky. <br>
<br>
<br>
Minstrels are the only class that is not able to make their advanced armor. Might it please be looked into and have minstrels changed to armorcrafters? There is little point in them fletching (they don’t get bows, but would gladly accept them. Can minstrels please have bows?) and why should they spend time making armor they won’t be able to wear after level 20? I know people have said they would look into this, but minstrels have never gotten an answer. <br>
<br>
Finally, there is little spark to the minstrel. They are a utility class that has all the charm of an allen wrench. Many other classes get little toys to play with. From bows, to pets that hang around, to poison. The minstrel’s supposed fun line, instruments, is hampered by a clunky interface. By level 11 all songs and shouts have been gotten so there are only upgrades to look for. At level 20 the minstrel gets chain armor and that’s it for the rest of the game. What has happened is that the minstrel is a very cookie cutter class. Perhaps a “vocal” line could be added to the game. These would be songs that could be sung during battle so that the minstrel could actually Be a minstrel while fighting. They could be almost the same songs and on the instrument line, but only work at a reduced power. <br>
<br>
In conclusion: <br>
The minstrel is a low powered hybrid tank class. It works at lower levels but breaks down as you gain levels. By around level 35 the “tank” has gone out of the minstrel and you are left with a passive group assister. In addition the minstrel has few perks and no toys. They are one of the least played classes in the game but with a bit of help could be one of the best.  <p><img src="http://werzat.freeservers.com/dsig3c.gif">
