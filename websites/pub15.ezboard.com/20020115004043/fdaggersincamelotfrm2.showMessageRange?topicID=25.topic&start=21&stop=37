<br>
I really can't think of a valid reason why we go anon in RvR - other realms can only see what members of their realm are in a zone and thus it doesn't seem to make much difference, but is something that people are always saying we should do, so we have been doing it. But like you, I'm not really sure why.<br>
<br>
I do agree with Belce on this one though and it is something we have discussed before.  Basically, I don't think letting people pick their own groups is a good method to go about organizing balanced groups. By letting people pick their own groups, I think we will find that the first group selected will almost always have the most balanced and highest level mix.<br>
<br>
Think of when you played team sports on the play ground at school.  If you let one team pick before the other team even was able to select any of it's members, the first team would most definitly be stronger.<br>
<br>
Thus I think the task should fall to either the Battle Commander or the Raid Leader and I'm leaning towards the Battle Command at this time only because I think the Raid Leader will be busy dealing with the set-up of the chat channel and late arrivals. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/ucreirwyy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Creirwyy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>BEEP BEEP (poor pedestrian)</span><br> <font color=#0000FF>(1/3/02 10:07:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://werzat.freeservers.com/d_photo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RvR on January 1st, 2002</span><hr size=1> I suggest attendance is taken by Raid Commander only.  Raid commander sets up one person outside of Battle Commander and themselves to set up chat channel.<br>
<br>
Raid Commander advises chat channel person who the Group Leaders are to be and gets them invited immediately.  Groups are announced in the chat channel and the Group Leaders go about getting their own groups set up.  Group Leaders advice chat channel person who is their back up GL and advises chat channel person.<br>
<br>
Also I have found the other nite this helped.  Not only all Stealth class are in chat channel, but all minstrels should be as well.  The minstrels should be /stuck on the Battle Commander and the rest of their group should be /stuck on the minstrel.  Minstrels move quickly.<br>
<br>
When a move is called, we did this the other nite and it worked somewhat better.  Battle Commander says<br>
&quot;moving in 3&quot;<br>
&quot;2&quot;<br>
&quot;1 MOVE&quot;    <br>
You can make up simple hotkeys for these.  That helps alleviate some of the lag/delay problems.<br>
<br>
When assigning groups, we continue with G1, G2, G3, etc. but now with a twist.<br>
Each group has their own MA.  G1 is responsible for pushing thru to the back, to get the healers; G2 goes after the casters in the middle and G3 and whatever go after the tanks.<br>
This way you could actually make up groups that are efficient to take out certain classes/races.  <br>
(i.e.)  G1 has the fastest Minstrel so they can get to the back and mez the healers, the sorcerer would be great in this group as well for the AoE mez, which ever.  G3 could be made up of mostly tank types to smack down the other tanks.<br>
This is just a concept of mine in the making, I need to work on it a bit more, and collect some more data.<br>

G1 is assigned the left flank, G2 the middle, G3 the right flank. You always know your position, because if you are G3, you should always be to the right of G2. G2 sets the path, everyone else follows it. With extra groups being assigned as forward recon (stealthers) and Reserves.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

<br>
As you are almost always in the scout team I think you may not be aware of the problems we have been having with group balance when letting GL's pick their groups.<br>
<br>
I for one have never seen a raid where people are not talking about group balance after the fact.  I remember the last raid I was in, I was in a group with 3 casters and 1 tank.  The problem was that while I was level 35 cleric, the other players were all below level 20 except for our group leader who was level 29 and a caster. Group 1 had 2 additional members and had a mix of 3 tanks and 3 casters.  Every person in group one was with-in 1 to 2 levels of each other and thus by allowing them to have an extremely well balanced group, the other two groups where seriously comprimised.<br>
<br>
The raid before, while I was in a balanced group (I was in the first group selected) I clearly remember others complaining that their group make-up was seriously lacking.<br>
<br>
It seems that once again in the last raid, that we are still having trouble with groupings and I think we need to address this problem and it should be the first thing on our agenda. I think no one will take us seriously if the join the raid only to find that they are in a gimped group while another group is a power house.  I also think that we could do every thing else right and still be defeated only because we have poor group balance.<br>
<br>
I think we need to come up with a way to ensure that we are putting together solid balanced groups that can accomplish the tasks we are assigning them.  We need to mix in the lower level players equally in our groups or assign them more of a support role.  We need to ensure that we have equal distrubution of tanks and casters or what ever mix of players we are looking for should we have speicific group tactics.<br>
<br>
I think the only way we can accomplish this is to have one person organize the groups.  This person should understand the tactics we will be using both in group and large formations and must understand the objectives we have set for the raid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/ucreirwyy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Creirwyy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>BEEP BEEP (poor pedestrian)</span><br> <font color=#0000FF>(1/3/02 10:47:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://werzat.freeservers.com/d_photo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RvR on January 1st, 2002</span><hr size=1> Wasn't that exactly my suggestion?<br>
and that person should be the Raid Commander.  That is their purpose.<br>
<br>
I have never believed that we should allow Group Leaders to pick who they want.  That's not their role.  That is the role once again of the Raid Commander to balance the groups.  The raid commander should know the strengths and weaknesses of the classes and balance them.<br>
<br>
And finally, personally we are going backwards.  These are things that have been discussed and decided upon it the past.  Why does it feel we are reinventing the wheel, almost each time?<br>
<br>
If we are to continue together again I suggest, that those who have worked on the raids sit down and collectively make up a list of the WHAT WE KNOW stuff.  Haemish has offered, I have offered, Vincent has offered.  Let's sit down collectively and get it written so we don't need to discuss certain things that have been decided in the past based on our RvR experience.<br>
<br>
p.s. I may be in the scout group, however I am well aware of the problems we have had in the past with group selection, since we discuss after raids either in game or via the posts.   <p><img src="http://werzat.freeservers.com/dsig3c.gif">

<br>
However, the obvious need to continue this process throughout the raid would mean having GLs report their makeup to this person after groups are formed.  At that point, having that single person get attendance info from class designates and making the groups themselves is likely going to be much easier on the group coordinator.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm willing to wait a few more minutes to get a good raid balance. <p><table border=1 bgcolor="#161C81"width=80%>

<br>
Based on all I have done recently with my computer, this is what I have an Intel Pentium III, with 512 memory &lt;I think that is right&gt;, a 64MB video card, as well as being on a cable modem.<br>
<br>
At first, for the live of me I couldn't figure out why so many kept falling behind, but I really do believe that these things make a much bigger difference than when we were in EQ.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think auto-following a minstrel is always a bad idea when in single groups.  Following minstrels in a large raid, whereby the minstrel is on follow of the BC is fine.<br>
<br>
Why I think following a minstrel is a bad idea.  1) When I go LD you all keep going from what I understand 2) The Minstrel should be in the middle of the pack because I am a very noticable target due to the fact the enemy can see those stupid green musical notes flying around 3) see above on system structure 4) once the Main Target is called/chosen  then the Minstrel can pick the targets to mez if no sorcerer is around.<br>
<br>
Why do I do it now?  It's just plain easier is all that if I if am running the group that I lead the way due to communication lag.  I honestly hope that we can get to a point where thru communication we can speak almost in code and others know exactly the routine so that we don't have to 'chat' as much. <p><img src="http://werzat.freeservers.com/dsig3c.gif">

<br>
Sorry Dulcette, I misunderstood your post when I saw &quot;Group Leaders go about getting their own groups set up&quot;.<br>
<br>
That being said, Dulcette, Belce, Lorne and I used to meet to hold discussions about RvR and the directions we wanted to take it. Since that time, Haemish, Belce, Lorne and I have met and laid the ground work for what I thought was a very sound idea.<br>
<br>
Basically each guild would hold meetings internally to discuss RvR tactics and things of this nature.  From there 2 members from each guild would meet to bring these ideas forward.  The idea is that should Seekers and Daggers enter into an alliance, in time we would probably have more guilds in the alliance and it would be benificial to take this approach from the beginning.<br>
<br>
Haemish and I had a quick conversation before the holidays and I informed him that I would not be available over the holidays and that we would probably be best off to set up our next meeting for after the holidays.<br>
<br>
I think every one knows that I am always open to getting together to discuss ideas and hear peoples opinions, I just think we need some structure to these meetings.<br>
<br>
That being said, the Seekers have organized a council to discuss RvR ideas internally in our own guild.  We held our first meeting just before the holidays and I think we had a lot of good ideas.  We will be holding our next meeting next week and I look foward to getting together with Dagger representatives to discuss the ideas further.<br>
<br>
Just a quick note on moving foward vs moving backwards.  I honestly don't think one bad night can be enough to say that things are moving backwards.  Let's take last night for example.<br>
<br>
We had a small single party group going out on a raid.  I can honestly say that I have run more organized and effective single group raids with non-Seekers/Dagger people.  Yes we had trouble at first with people paying attention and yes IT IS FRUSTRATING (takes a breath) from time to time when this happens.<br>
<br>
However, in time people did start paying attention and we did have better success.  However, one of the main problems we did have is that our scout (while he did do a bang up job) is very new to RvR.  I had trouble giving directions to him and when I thought he was in the second southern valley, he was in fact in the first southern valley. But hell that is what this game is all about and I don't see it as a step backwards.<br>
<br>
As I have said, I was away for about 2 weeks (I don't get many chances to spend time with my sister) and have not been nearly as involved as I normally am or would have liked to have been.  However, the holidays are over, I am back to my normal routine.  I guarantee you that I will be the first one there to discuss/aid/assist in any thing that will be done in a constructive manner. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/umolfious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Molfious</A> at: 1/3/02 3:31:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/ucreirwyy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Creirwyy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>BEEP BEEP (poor pedestrian)</span><br> <font color=#0000FF>(1/3/02 3:23:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://werzat.freeservers.com/d_photo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RvR on January 1st, 2002</span><hr size=1> - I agree that there should be a RvR tactical team.

<br>
- I have spent a great deal in RvR, being a part of other guild's groups, with special invites so that I can learn from them.<br>
<br>
- When sending out scouts they move really really really slow.  Might be a good idea on any given day for Battle Commander/Raid Commander of the future to go spend some one on one time with a Stealth player and count off how long it takes them to get from point a to point b.  Too many times a call is moved beyond where the stealth player &lt;s&gt; are.<br>
<br>
- It was not one night, it was two nite's in a row.  And the most frustrating part was we are eight really good players and we weren't listening, we weren't stuck together, we were moving without calls being made, we got RVR realm point happy without consideration for the group, and the list goes on.  If we, the eight who were their last nite can't get our acts together to run as an efficient team how can we possibly ever expect of the others around us.  How can we possibly lead by example?  When myself and one other member were all by ourselves last nite at MF1, we actually shrugged together.  Yes two very experienced RvR players were completely lost as to what was going on and didn't gain one realm point due to it.  So yes that is very frustrating.<br>

- I think the meetings were a good thing.  We were holding them on a consistent basis and I would hope that know that the holidays are over that will happen again immediately.<br>
<br>
- regarding the attached quote from Molfious, could we hear what that ground work is?<br>
&quot;Since that time, Haemish, Belce, Lorne and I have met and laid the ground work for what I thought was a very sound idea.&quot;<br>

I suggest Raid Commander takes attendance.  Raid Commander assigns a chat lead person.  Raid Commander forms the groups.  Raid Commander has chat person get all Group Leaders in the chat channel.  Raid Commander then announces the groups in the chat channel, whereby the Group Leaders get the invites going.  Group Leaders then inform chat channel person who their back up is.<br>

<br>
We will hold regular meetings with a group of 4, this group will be drawn from a larger group to help keep ideas growing also we would like the previous and next raid commanders involved to discuss good and bad things from previous raid and help set goals, judge progress.<br>

Pretty much big picture stuff on the alliance, so that we could feel comfortable moving forward on an alliance. Also some discussions on when the next event would be and what that might be. <br>

I think having 4 gl's select one after another what they should have in their group would take longer.<br>

It is my intent to hold regular meetings to discuss the many things that an alliance would require us to invest time and engery into.<br>
<br>
One of these topics would be RvR and the ways we can make it better.<br>
<br>
The key here is as has been stated by every one already, is to develop a standard set of protocals if you will that govern the ways in which we conduct RvR.<br>
<br>
I played EQ on a regular server for 2 years and I can tell you that after a year on a PvP server that large scale raids against mobs are much different than large scale raids against other players.  I also played another team game for a long time in the PGL and I can tell that team dynamics when you are competing against other players are much different than when you are playing against a static mob.  I do not claim to have the answers and/or the knowledge that some how makes me better than any one else at this sort of thing, but I do hold a firm belief in the fact that through organization and a whole lot of grouping and practice that we will learn in time to not only anticipate each others actions but work as a very cohesive unit.  <br>
<br>
In the other game I speak of that we played in the professional gaming league, we needed the ability to communicate and communicate quickly.  We also had to understand each others style of play and learn to use our strengths to the best of our abilities to maximize our effectiveness.  We also had to learn how the opposing teams worked and what types of strategies they would use against us.  We spent a great deal of time working in small groups getting know each other and played the game over and over again not only against opposing teams, but against each other.  We developed a short hand and had specific keyboard mappings to communicate quickly and conscisely. We understood all the maps forwards and backwards and could navigate them in total darkness as if it was second nature.<br>
But again these things take time and commitment, something I feel I have not offered enough of at this point and time. But I would like to change this now, so here is what I suggest.<br>
<br>
I hear by announce that for the course of my stay in DAoC that I am committed to developing the same degree of unity between our two guilds.  I would like to see our guilds rise to this challenge and become the best that we can be in all areas related to playing the game including RvR and PvE.<br>
<br>
Therefore I would like to extend an invite to Haemish and all the Silver Daggers to step forth and join me in developing strategy, tactics and communication.  It will not be easy, it will not happen over night.  But as has been so wisely stated by Dulcette and many others, we have covered many of these things already and we need not move backwards, but rather we should be moving forward.<br>
<br>
Therefore I would like to merge our council of tactics with a division with-in the Silver Daggers, our goal to develop tactics, strategy and communication methods that will unite us into a cohesive unit prepared to take on the challenges that we will face in the coming months and years in DAoC.<br>
<br>
I would like to have regular meetings between the groups and work on quickly developing short hand communication, orders of movement, scouting tactics, battle divisions, group formations and seige tactics.  The key will be playing the game together as much as possible both PvE and RvR.<br>
<br>
As I have said, I am committed 100% to this and will do every thing I can to help bring about the things I have mentioned. But with out you all, I will surely fail and failure is something I do not take lightly.<br>
<br>
I will be speaking with Haemish more in game ASAP to see if this is something he believes your guild desires. But if the members of the Silver Daggers I already call friend are any indication I see no reason why this endevor should not move forward. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/umolfious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Molfious</A> at: 1/4/02 12:19:17 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#871f78><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub15.ezboard.com/bdaggersincamelot.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=belce>Belce</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.macaulay.org/macabdge.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer</span><br> <font color=#0000FF>(1/4/02 12:37:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub15.ezboard.com/fdaggersincamelotfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.macaulay.org/macabdge.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RvR on January 1st, 2002</span><hr size=1> The main reason why I want our guild to be in alliance with the Seekers is in the post above.   <p>Belce Gaegwyn<BR>

<br>
To-date we have assigned group leaders.  I think we should ask Group Leaders to step forward.  The reasons to why I think this is important:<br>
- some people have faster systems.<br>
- some people are faster typers.<br>
- some classes need to concentrate on more important things while in battle that is within their text, so therefore cannot always concentrate on chat.<br>
- it allows the person who offered to take responsibility, as opposed to us assigning it.<br>
<br>
There are challenges to being a Group Leader.  As well a Group Leader is not a prestigous &lt;sp&gt; right, it's a position who is comfortable in being able to keep their group together, keeping up with the commands, etc.    <p><img src="http://werzat.freeservers.com/dsig3c.gif">
