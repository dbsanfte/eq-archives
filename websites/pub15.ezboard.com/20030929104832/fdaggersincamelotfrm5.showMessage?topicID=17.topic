<br>
As it is right now, when you borrow money from the treasury for trade skills, you have to repay 90% of the money. While I thought this was a good idea at first, it doesn't seem to be working. First off, to my knowledge, I'm the only one who has borrowed. And when I did, I saw why. I wasn't really able to get much skill with the 10 gold I borrowed, especially considering I had to pay back 9 gold. I ended up making that many times over just trying to get some skill moving. At low levels, 90% might work, but as the amounts get higher, more money raises less skill. <br>
<br>
I'd like to propose that the repayment percentage be changed from 90% to 50% of the original loan, repayable within 2 weeks. <br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
We can set aside a portion of the treasury that goes towards nothing but trade skills. The sponsored trade skill people can use this money to raise their skill, with no need to repay it. However, the amount of money set aside from the treasury can never go over 50% of the current treasury, and the money would be first come first serve. <br>
<br>
I want to hear from trades people, as to whether either one of these systems would be something they'd want to use (and would be helpful). I also want to hear from those who have no intention of being tradesfolk... I want to know if you would have any problems with essentially paying for other's trade skills (though these skills will benefit you as well, through armor, weapons and when it's added, spellcraft, as well as siegecraft). <br>

<br>
Since the &quot;dues&quot; have been tossed out in favor of a community hunt -- which both suits the Dagger spirit better and will be more fiscally viable -- either of the above becomes a more useful means of sponsoring tradesfolk based on a conservative estimate of guild-fund growth.  The analysis of the two suggestions is provided via guesstimates of Dagger Night totals and full utilization of the trade sponsor program (which are both conservative and liberal respectively) and used to show the workings of the ideas.<br>
<br>
Proposal: Trade loan repayment percentage be changed from 90% to 50% of the original loan, repayable within 2 weeks. <br>
<br>
The current restrictions on these loans are: a) all outstanding loans can not exceed 1/3 of the total guild fund and b) each sponsored member can only be loaned money once per week.  <br>
<br>
With the above change to this system and assuming maximum utilization, if the guild fund is 900g and 300g is on loan, 150g will be repaid the first week leaving 750g in the guild fund.  Week 2 250g is on loan with 125g returned, 625g will remain in the guild account.  *Guesstimate* of return from Dagger Night hunt, (avg ~17g * 15 people) 250g, raising the guild fund to 875.  Week 3, 290g is on loan with 145g returned, yielding 730g. Week 4 has 250g loaned with 125 expected in return yielding 605g and add another Dagger Night guesstimate brings it up to 855g.  Net loss of 45 gold <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   using the above -guesstimates- for Daggers Nights</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  If Dagger Nights brought in 275g each, there is no loss and a little (5g) gain.<br>
<br>
It must be noted that even with adjustments in the loanable percentage, it is still possible for the guild fund to post a net loss due to the loans and the sums tradesfolk can utilize will be reduced when the guild fund is used for its other intended purposes (siege weapons, &quot;guild housing&quot;, etc).<br>
<br>
<br>
Proposal: Set aside a portion of the treasury that goes towards nothing but trade skills. The sponsored trade skill people can use this money to raise their skill, with no need to repay it. However, the amount of money set aside from the treasury can never go over 50% of the current treasury, and the money would be first come first serve. <br>
<br>
(<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Note:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the proposal suggests 50% of the guild treasury.  This proposal <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   is being modified</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> from the above language for this example, since the stated language is not fiscally viable in the long term and I think Haemish mis--spoke (it was 4am when he posted it..then again, it'll be after 6am when I post this, so....).<br>
<br>
Modified language:  &quot;...portion of INCOME TO THE TREASURY that goes...&quot; &quot;...never go over 50% of the CURRENT INCOME TO the treasury.&quot;<br>
<br>
With the above system (modified language) if the guild treasury is 900g and Dagger Night brings in 500g gold in a given month, 250g will be available for trade folks to use to increase their skill and the guild fund will be 1150g at the end of the month.<br>
<br>
It must be noted that this system provides less for tradesfolk to use that the above system <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> based on the assumption of income used</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  However, when the guild fund is used for other intended purposes, the tradesfolk <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  continue</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to benefit from the system (whereas the &quot;loan&quot; system would decrease their funding as the guild treasury totals go down) and the guild fund itself is insulated from fluctuations in income since the portions available for tradesfolk are derived from the income itself.  Additionally, gold from the general guild fund can at times be allocated into the tradesfolk fund after prudent review of the guild's finances by the officers and if no dissention from the members -- for situations where the guild's assets far outweigh it's obligations and forecasts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> My recommendation as Treasurer</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is the latter system (splitting the income into two budgets) as it is the most viable long-term solution for the over-all health of the guild's finances but using 30% rather than 50% <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> initially</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, with the possibility to be raised to 50% if sufficient income is being generated to meet long-term projections and more can be allocated to trades.  <br>
<br>
That is only a recommendation, however.  The decision is for the members to make. <p><table border=1 bgcolor="#161C81"width=80%>

<br>
I have not done any tradeskill work until last nite.  Why, too expensive even with 90% payback.  I finally reached 150gp, I burned thru 50gp relatively quickly to gain about 8 points.<br>
<br>
Now I have learned that my skills, especially in Woodworking are very useful in RvR.  Meaning I can repair keep doors quickly and efficiently, as well as upgrade them.<br>
<br>
My question would be, when the time comes we need seige equipment and wood to repair doors, etc., how will those items be paid for?<br>
<br>
I guess personally I have a problem taking other people's monies to build my skill even tho it's directly related to the guild's successes in the long run.  Since we are planning to do guild events to raise funds, instead of dues, then at least I don't feel the sense of guilt any longer.<br>

I've borrowed 10g from the guild treasury, and been given over 120gp from Quellar, Junun, Celarang and Alldric. The rest has been my own money. Without the money given to me I'd be at least 100 skill points lower than I am. <br>
<br>
Trade skills take ridiculuous amounts of time post 350. All that time is spent not leveling. I'd estimate of my 8 days played, 2.5 to 3 days of that has been trade skills. <br>
<br>
In RvR, which we have said is the end game, two things matter a lot: levels and (for keeps, both defense and offense) trade skills (either through better armor and weapons, repairing keep doors or using siege gear). To get the latter, you have to give up the former (unless you have insane amounts of time, certainly more than I do). It's become quite clear to me that while you can fund your own trade skills, the benefits they give to the guild are worth sponsoring. And the amounts we've talked about just don't do it well enough. <br>
<br>
Siege equipment items are to be paid for out of the guild treasury, because these are going to be expensive. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

I however am not doing a trade skill and have bought most of my armor from Brother Vincent and also been given equipment from Briton (thanks guys, it really helped alot). <br>
<br>
If the concern is for the end game, RVR then I would think that we would want to continue to maintain a nice bank amount to eventually do seigecraft, guild housing when available. <br>
<br>
But I also understand that the skills needed to for seigecraft and the other needs to have at least some support from the guild to advance. <br>
<br>
I don't know if the borrowing of money should be a gift, maybe if we have stellar nights for treasury hunting that could be a option.<br>

The other way, that &quot;gift&quot; money is split off up front.<br>
<br>
My main concern with the loan/repay system is that it eats directly the funds we have for other things (like sigecraft, door repair materials, etc) so that planning for these costs is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> extremely</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> hard because you have to forecast the income which...well let's just say you are making a big &quot;guess&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You can also basically shut-down trade loans if a large part of the general fund is spent on something (guild housing, siege equip, etc).  Another small concern is, as with the dues system, at some point you have to go to someone and do the Haemish-as-Soprano routine -- at least you buy-in to that with a &quot;loan&quot;<br>
<br>
The split-income method always makes sure the general guild fund goes upward, so you can plan for expenses.  It also doens't penalize tradefolk if, say, 90% of the general guild fund is spent on guild housing -- that would essentially shut down trade loans for a time.<br>
<br>
The other benefit of the split-income method is that it's bleedin' easy to understand and for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> any</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> member to see exactly where the guild's finances are and where they are heading -- that can't be said for the loan program running at 50%.<br>
<br>
Maybe what I'm trying to get is:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Why</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> do folks favor one system over the other? <p><table border=1 bgcolor="#161C81"width=80%>

<br>
The above systems, I think the one where the funds are tracked as part of the treasury is best.  50% repayment. <br>
