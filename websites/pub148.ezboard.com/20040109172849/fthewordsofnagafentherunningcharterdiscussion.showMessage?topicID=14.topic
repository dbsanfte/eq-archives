have never seemed to cause division among us.  The reason being, I feel ALL members of the Claw are generous and really want to see each other grow strong.  As the higher levels do reach the time when we can obtain those extremely rare and unique items… ones that are the best a class can get before going to the PoF… we need to be careful to not cause divisions or jealousy among ourselves.   High level items (at least the non-lore ones) are like money.  They can be used to trade for needed items.  For instance.  If I was lucky enough to obtain a ykesha (useless for my little druid) I could trade for some VERY NICE equipment.  Should I therefore roll for the item so that I can use it to trade or should I pass it on to someone in the guild that needs it? <BR>  <BR> I can see 2 schools of thought to this and both have merits and drawbacks: <BR> 1) Let whoever needs it loot it.  If more than one person needs it then use lotto.  In no one in the group needs it lotto for it and whoever gets it then can either use it to trade or offer it to another guild member… their choice. <BR>  <BR> 2)  lotto all items among the group no matter what the class.  This is what will most likely happen in a mixed (non-Claw) group as well.  This seems to cause the least disputes (no accusations of favoritism, etc.) but also leads to major group turnover.  Person X wins the loot they want… they leave… the party can’t hold the spawn and noone else gets a chance to loot.  This seems to happen ALL the time.  If you are in a claw group and can stick around AFTER you got what you wanted this is always the right thing to do. <BR>  <BR> In all cases, once you have looted a valuable item (whether to use, trade, or give away) you should refrain from rolling for the remainder of that hunt. <BR>  <BR> I tend toward option number 1 whenever I am grouping with people I have grouped with before.  Giving items among your friends and guildmates is basically like trading.  What goes around, comes around.  Hehe.  I “traded” gatorscale sleeves to Muirlan for a runed mith bracer (hehehe… he was ripped off but who’s keeping track?)  We didn’t exactly trade.  I gave him sleeves when I didn’t need them and a few weeks later he gave me a bracer he didn’t need.  I’m sure if either of us loots an item the other desires these kinds of trades will continue. <BR>  <BR> It worked for Sarivek (our newest zapper).  He was trying to trade an executioners hood for a nightshade wreath.  Noone in cazic or guk wanted to trade, so he gave the hood to Freyja.  The next day, Emeraldeyes and Sarivek and Zaya (sp?)(and later Aradan and I) camped the wreath.  Sarivek got his wreath.  Voila!  Yes both these examples are for fairly common items that you can buy with plat (rather than trade only) but I think the concept is valid. <BR>  <BR> Will this work for the REALLY expenxive/rare items?  I dunno.  Depends on the people in the guild and what we want to do.  Personally, I hope I find the generosity to still give things away.  Primary characters in the guild should come first.  My twink enchanter is wearing silk not an oracle robe.  Until EVERY caster in the guild has a nice robe that will be the case.  Primary chars come first in my philosophy.  Besides, by the time I’m 50 and playing my enchanter more, all the casters will have SMR and I’m sure I’ll get a good deal on an oracle robe.  Hehehe.  Rarely traded or auctioned, and never want to.  Never have more plat in the bank than I need for spells and supplies or buying things for friends.  Every piece of equipment I wear has either been looted, given to me, or crafted for me.  (Yes, Indiana twinked me with azure sleeves when I was 25 to so, but I count that as advance payment for all the ports I give him!) <BR>  <BR> I think it will work within the Claw for one main reason:  we need each other.  I’ll camp all night in MM to help Aradan get a drum because there is NO WAY I will ever loot a brown chitin protector without his (or other claws) help.  Sure I could roll against him hoping to trade a bard drum for some nice druid thing.  It doesn’t make sense to me to do it that way though.  I’m not a merchant and never want to be one.  On lower level items trading can be a good way to earn some cash or get good items you need.  At the higher levels these types of trades only encourages the item camping and greed. <BR>  <BR> Knowledge is power.  Having level 10 characters in level 50 gear will not kill a dragon.  Having a group of lvl 46-50 characters who trust each other and who know how to play in whatever gear they have will!  Yes I get jealous as heck!  Little Keke is out dressed by many 30 druids on our server (had an aquaintance brag to me last weekend after inspecting my gear how they have more wisdom than me because lvl 50 char X gave them a thingamahoosey cloak.)  Well, guess what?  The friends I have made both within the claw and elsewhere is what makes the game worth playing and is what makes me strong… not 15 more mana for a snare spell!  I’ll get my level 50 gear someday … perhaps the old fashioned way and earning it on my way to level 50.   <BR>  <BR> Please feel free to post countering point.  I’m not saying this is the Claw rule.  This is just the way I would like to see it.  I’ve probably missed a lot of important points and would love to have a debate on this issue.  One thing is certain… we need to decide soon how we are going to handle it.  In the next few weeks there will be more and more rare loots obtained by the Claw members (WAY TO GO!) <BR>  <BR> PS.  Aradan thanks for making me think about this.  I’d love to hear your opinion and thought we should move this discussion to the message board rather than online in guildsay.  You are right, we need to come up with a plan. <BR>  <BR> Keke <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#141419><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bramblefoot>Bramblefoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif              BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local user</span><br>   <font color=#7A8798>(1/12/00 8:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   I concur</span><hr size=1>  Keke, I totally agree with your philosophy.( and it's not because I'm trying to follow in your footsteps8) Part of what makes us so strong is our devotion to our brothers and sisters. When we take no thought of ourself and put others first, our bonds strengthen. Our trust becomes stronger and as a whole we prosper. <BR>  Some of the most enjoyable times I've had have been in helping others obtain a needed item. I have witnessed the selflessness of others in the guild as they have quested to help guildmates. I would much rather see a coveted item on a Claw, than to sell for profit or personal gain.  <BR>  I, myself have gained the coveted Paw gloves and in my continuing efforts around Paw, my thoughts aren't &quot;now I can sell the next pair I find for xxxpp&quot;, but &quot;Keke will love it when I get a pair of these for her!&quot; <BR>  I don't forsee a problem with the loot issue as the calibre of our membership has proven time and again that we are above such things. I've seen many players join guilds for the sole purpose of benefiting from membership &quot;perks&quot;. The greatest thing we offer one another is not wonderful magic items or loot, but friendship and a wonderful gaming experience. <BR>  I know that if I don't recieve a desired object because it goes to another not to be upset or jealous, because I will obtain it eventually. My friends will see to that. <BR>  <BR> Bramblefoot-still wearing patchwork-Stormfisher <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212128><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uemeraldeyes.showPublicProfile>emeraldeyes</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>   <font color=#7A8798>(1/13/00 12:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Looting Procedures </span><hr size=1> Option #1:  Need before Greed. <BR>  <BR> Has been and always will be my philosophy.  But Keke's post does bring up another question.... <BR>  <BR> Are we doing some of the lower levels harm by simply passing down the items.  I learned a great deal in camping for each of the items I have obtained.  Learned Zone layouts, met great people, learned how to gracefully become part of a camp and how to gracefully leave....each item forced me into first researching about the item on the web and then exploring and learning about the area on EQ.  By simply passing down the items, are we doing damage to the skill development of those that recieve the gift? <BR>  <BR> I will continue to pass on my items to younger claws...I have specifically targeted Trinitti as the heir to my items...but I'd hate to think these gifts may be robbing her of some much needed experience. <BR>  <BR> Please share your thoughts.... <p>EmeraldEyes BrazenHeart

None of them are perfect, and there is always someone that ends up getting jealous of angry because they feel they were shafted...but it all comes down to one word - Sacrifice.  I have seen all types...Kings Order, Alpha, lotto...the whole gambit.  For those who read my bio they will know about my old  Band.  For those who have not, a quick explanation - The Band was 12 Senior Guides, who liked to play together in their off time.  We got together at about 20th, and went to 50th.  We joined no guilds, played with none other but ourselves on most occasions because like you, we were disgusted with the lack of organization and tactical knowledge among other grouped players.  Since the beginning of our little group, we did a loot order based off need.  Who needed the item the most (notice I said NEED, not want) was the one who got it, no matter if they were online or not.  With this type of sacrifice for the other members of our group, and this out look on loot - everyone ended up with what they NEEDED.  We took everything into play, the stats, the advantages of this person having this specific item...etc.  Once everyone was happy with their equip, then we made a wish list, and we worked from this list.  We arranged the list according to item location.  We would not leave a zone until every item on that list was looted, no matter what the spawn rate was, and who was at the top of the wish list?  Support Classes - Druids, Bards, Clerics and Shamans. <BR>  <BR> What broke us up was one day we were all sitting around after the list was filled and everyone had everything they wanted (that they could use, we didn't have alt characters because we believed it caused greed and distractions)...and we said, &quot;What next?&quot; and then we all said &quot;Well we have everything we want, we're bored!&quot; lol..and we all split off to other servers from there, and I came to Bristlepain..and the rest you know. <BR>  <BR> In any case, when the needs of the players are met before the wants of others, and the others of the group are loyal enough and will sacrifice their time..that group will become extremely powerful, and nearly invincible, not to mention the increase of trust, companionship. and tactical knowledge.  Vander said it right when she said that we twink all our members because it increases our powerbase as a guild.  The same goes for primary characters and needed equip.  Here are a few GREAT examples for those who need some visuals: <BR>  <BR> Example 1 - I have been drooling over a Mithril 2 hander for several months, it will be the last weapon I have before I go to the planes.  By getting the weapon, I increase my power as a paladin and as a group member.  It lets me hit for 21 damage extremely fast, and who's to say that in a nail biter combat, due to the weapon, I am able to strike down or interrupt a caster that was casting Shock of Force on a near death party member, indirectly saving that person's life, XP and time?  What rule was it - Hit Hard and Hit fast. The faster we strike with more damage, the more mana we save, and the more blood we keep in our bodies.  That is just one example, and it goes from there.  Lets say I get the weapon, if I do I will donate my Silvery 2 Handed Axe to the guild, which increases the power of another player, which increases the power of the group they are in and over all increases the power of the guild.  Do you see the domino effect caused just from getting ONE item for ONE person?  Just think if we all did this??  WOW!   <BR>  <BR> Example 2 - Aradan's Drums.  As we all know Bards are a support class, backing up everyone in the group and speeding the recovery of two of the most important things in EQ - Mana and Health, not to mention several other support songs.  I have seen a 50th level Bard at work, and let me tell you something...she was deadly.  Not from raw damage or spell power but because her songs made the group as a whole more powerful.  We recovered health and mana faster, we were faster in combat, and her STR song stacked with Druid and Shaman spells made us melee gods.  Our down time was nearly zilcho. You know how long it took me to med from oom to full?  Nearly 9 minutes without clarity or her song.  At 50th level with her song or clarity I was ready to go in 3 minutes...not to mention fully healed.  I think you all get the point here.   <BR>  <BR> How to determine want from need? <BR>  <BR> Ask yourself these three questions: <BR>  <BR> 1) How will it benefit me as a player? <BR> 2) How will it benefit the groups I am in? <BR> 3) How will it benefit my guild? <BR>  <BR> If you can honestly answer ALL these questions starting with a &quot;Yes!&quot; then it is a need...2 out of 3 doesn't count.  Any less than 3 is a want.  The faster we gather all our needs, the faster we can get to the wants. (Like Mana stones for all the casters! Hehe).   <BR>  <BR> Twinking lower level players - Em made a good point...why go to Guk?  Why go to Sol B? Why go into these hell holes of death and chaos?  Because we need something there, and in going there we learned the tactics of the area and met new folks and made new friends.  One the other hand...I am sorry, I can think of many other more &quot;merciful&quot; places to go if I just needed XP, and when I was younger in level, this was surely the case.  But not now.  Verant's outlook is that your first 20 levels are there for one reason - to learn the game.  What you learn and the friends you make in your first 20 levels will save your life when you get up there in the 30's and beyond.  This game does not really begin until 20th level, hence the surname and melee damage cap.  I could solo all day long when I was 18th-20th, but when I hit about 24th, blue mobs started hitting me faster, for more damage...and the higher you get in levels, the more you will depend on a group. Which is the purpose of this whole game - interaction with other people.  The majority of people in general just can't get along with others, and those that can and band together can quickly become the most powerful people in this game.  This is why support classes are so important. <BR>  <BR> Now back to twinking - Not many people know this, and I am reluctant to let the cat out of the bag...of those that know this, not many believe it but I will tell you it is true.  There is an in-game code that prevents over twinking of characters.  Verant was not stupid - What is this code?  Well I am not going to go into it too much but technically it comes down to this...the code determines the average equip you should have according to level.  Example - 1-5 Cloth, 6-10 leather, 11-15 banded...and so on(just an example I am not sure of the actual coded limits).  This equip cap is removed along with the damage cap at 20th level.  So you may be 5th level with all ruby and you may look really pretty, but technically the server sees you as wearing cloth, and this is why twinked players do no better than those with average equip.   Keep this in mind when looking for items for your alt characters or lower level guild players.   <BR> To me there is a difference - Helping people and twinking people.  I think you get it. :) <BR> I will not twink anyone under 20th level because I know it won't do any good.  Twinking other guild members? Hell yeah, as long as they are above 20th, and no other player in the guild who is higher level NEEDS it..it is theirs. <BR>  <BR> Till about a week ago I was doing all I could to save up money to buy a mithril 2 handed sword, doing blacksmithing and making crafted armor to sell to others but I gave up, because I realized that by not helping my guild mates get what they need, hurts my chances of getting what I need...and I am doing no good for my guild by wasting my time camping something that I am going to use to sell to some other player.  I have spent a ton of cash on CHR gear and gems for these crafted quests..I had 1000 PP last week, and I now have only 21..lol...and guess what?  I don't mind being broke, because I know by giving this crafted armor to my guildmates who need it, takes me one step closer to being a millionaire. :) <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Neal aka Zar <BR>  <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212128><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uicecrusher.showPublicProfile>icecrusher</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=  http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif  BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>   <font color=#7A8798>(1/13/00 1:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What I have learned concerning loot...</span><hr size=1> Damn Zarr...

It seems to me that the number one priority on loot is: How much is this item needed by the guild?<br>
<br>
Basically, I've always thought that (in a group) the person who NEEDS the item should have first priority..as the advancement of that person's equipment is part of advancing the guild. For example: (not that this would ever happen, but for the purposes of illustration...) 5 warriors and a wizard are camping the AM....who gets the robe? well...the wizard of course...UNLESS...(and this brings me to scenario #2:<br>
<br>
No one in the group needs the item.....in that case, I'm of the opinion that the group as a whole should decide (vote) on which guild member should recieve said item....as Keke and I have done 2 or 3 times with some Bladed Thulian Claws...This seems to work well...and also benefits the guild as a whole. Then we have scenario number 3:<br>
<br>
No one in the group wants the item...no one in the guild needs the item.....in that case...roll on it...and let the winner do with it as he or she sees fit. This includes giving the item to an Alt. character....<br>
<br>
Hate to say it...but in order to focus on our goals...alt characters are at the VERY BOTTOM of the ladder when it comes to loot.<br>
<br>
All of the above aplies mostly to full claw groups...obviously, if a non-member is in the group...you'll roll for it....in which case...you won the item (if you won...) and may do with it as you wish...after all..we are not in full claw groups ALL the time..<br>
<br>
I'm sure I left out MANY crucial details...as I've had no sleep...so please feel free to respond...point out whatever I've overlooked...let's get a solid discussion going on this topic...so we can have a loot plan that is &quot;set in stone&quot;<br>
