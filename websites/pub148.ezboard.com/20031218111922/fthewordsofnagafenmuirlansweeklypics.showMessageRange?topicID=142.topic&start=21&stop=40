<br>
What was that supposed to mean as she landed in North Karana. As she had fully expected, the little runters were there and immediately one ported off to, she assumed, the Moon, where she could report in. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now ye come easy lassy and there'll be no 'arm done to ye,&quot; another, bolder runter had the temerity to spout.  Stormygale laughed in her face, and quickly summoned her steed. Doom materialized and pawed the ground, tired it seemed of being pent up in the stables, and the sheer size of him intimidating all to back away. &quot;You should let it lie, little runter, before you get hurt,&quot; she responded,&quot; then wheeled Doom and sped away. She bent around and watched the pursuers falling far behind. <br>
<br>
The fun of riding almost made her pain seem immaterial. After zoning into South Karana, she let loose the reins and gave Doom his head. He reared once, pawing the air with white hooves, then sped away. In no time at all she was zoning again, and then again into another zone and then her destination, the zone of Rathe Mountains. <br>
<br>
She trotted past hill giants and cyclops now too frightened of her to come near. Believe it or not, there was an inn here and if you knew the innkeepers secret password, no harm would come to you. Abruzi had often honored it. No questions asked, and now she would ask for the same.  <br>
<br>
She dismounted and gave Doom a pat. Oh what a wonderful investment he'd been. Always at hand in need and completely loyal. &quot;Off you go then lad,&quot; she whispered into his ear. &quot;Have a bit of grass and a good roll and I'll be out in a bit. I have business inside.&quot; She gave his rump another pat and watched fondly as he squealed and ran and kicked up his heels in a fit of bucking, then got down to the business of good green grass.<br>
<br>
Stormygale grimaced yet again in pain, but standing tall, she entered the inn. She strode up to the rather sly looking fellow obviously in charge of this seedy place. His evil eyes lit on her like a man on pure gold. The greed showing through like little suns from his eyes. <br>
<br>
She threw $100 plat on the counter and said the word. The man's entire demeanor changed. &quot;Yes mum, anything you says mum,&quot; was all that came out of his mouth at her requests. She gathered up her goods and waved him a goodbye, but he didn't see it as he was too busy polishing more money than he'd seen in a long, long time. <br>
<br>
She whistled once outside and Doom immediately nickered and came forward. Most of his white hide, which once had been black, much as her own hair, was now stained green. Luckily they'd take care of him back at the stables. She simply was unable to groom him anymore. &quot;Did you have fun? she asked, and got another nicker in return. &quot;Well, off we go then,&quot; and she mounted up and memorized the port to Wakening Lands. In a trice she was gone.<br>
<br>
When they rematerialized there was Wuoshi to greet them. While she eyed Doom with great interest, she didn't give a hoot about Stormygale, and that was all that was required. She invised up and sped off through the woods, knowing well to keep away from the entrance to her Gods land. She did not want to be seen. Doom dodged through the wood like a trained acrobat, which he was and after stopping for one moment to trample a panther into the ground, she had reached her destination. <br>
<br>
She dismounted for the last time for a while she hoped, and almost collapsed. Doom stood stoically and braced her until she could get her feet under her. &quot;What a wonderful horse you are, Doom. I love you so much,&quot; Stormygale used his mane to wipe her face from tears of glee as much as pain. &quot;You go home now and they'll rub you down and feed you well. I hear there is a new mare in the stall next to yours now,&quot; and watched as Doom took on his stallion Stance. Head up, chest out, snorting and blowing in glee. &quot;You big fool. Good luck with her!&quot; and watched as he vanished. <br>
<br>
She entered Skyshrine and nodded to the two guards. They knew her from days past and let her enter unquestioned. They were not about to tell anyone she was here. They cared not at all about puny human concerns.<br>
<br>
Well, let them find her now, she thought as she selected a room not too far from the merchants. Yes, they had a brew which would work fine and she bought many a bottle. In fact, she was already drinking one as she made her bed and had started the third as she kicked off her boots. She'd been smart enough to buy edible supplies in Rathe Mountains, as the dragon's food was not to her liking. Too hard to digest. She tore into a piece of jerky and sipped her brew and slowly fell asleep yet again as the pain abated. Her last thought was a brief puzzle over the words of Athene. Can help. Can help what? Who? It didn't matter anyway....<br>

<br>
She stopped for a moment in mid-scribe, sensing the usual morning break from her work.<br>
<br>
“Bah! Where be the Cazic-Thule Puppet!! Ridiculously funny!” shouted Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane as he appeared in front of her, right on schedule. “You know Fizzlethorpe, you ask that same question everytime you decide to manifest yourself. And, as of yet, none of your denizens has brought you that damn puppet. Nor do I think they ever will.”<br>
<br>
Bristlebane winked at Vandergrave and nudged her in the rib, “Bah! Where’s your sense of humor Necromancer! There be no harm in asking!” Vandergrave raised an eyebrow at Bristlebane, “I have no sense of humor, hobbit.” She said with a smirk. “Well, I best retire to me chambers then, hurry and finish that spell some day will you?…I’d like me home to myself at some point.” said Bristlebane, vanishing as quickly as he appeared, and with just as big of a grin. It was true, Vandergrave could be humorless and dry at times, but she almost sort of liked that giant Hobbit (as much as one could like the living, anyway), and she did owe him at least a conversation or two since he was kind enough to let her reside in his Plane from time to time.<br>
<br>
 Just then, Vandergrave felt a disturbance. Words of green mist appeared in her mind, just out of sight. Her guild was calling to her…..something she could not quite make out. Sto….a story? No…Storm…..Why would they warn her of a storm…Shadowha…Shadowhaven…That was on Luclin….No storms there….Stormygale. That was it. Stormygale was in trouble.<br>
<br>
Vandergrave quickly but away her quill and parchment, picking up her Scythe. “Suspend yourself Garn,” she said to the Child Of Bertoxxulos, “The one that brought you to me is in need, and we must travel.” The sickening visage floated behind Vandergrave, placing it’s rotting, skeletal hands on her shoulders before whispering into her ears, “As you wish, Oh Splendid One…” It’s breath smelled of an abandoned slaughterhouse, but she had long since become accoustmed to such unpleasantries. Garn then vanished, folding inwards into his own robes, leaving behind only a thin ribbon of grave mist.<br>
<br>
She quickly opened a Gate, stepping from the Theatre into the main hall of the castle, then through a secret doorway into the Courtyards. She ran south to the Planar Portal, suddenly shifting from the Planes into reality. The shift into the Cobalt Scar was always unpleasant, going from warm, dry air to cold, icy water. As she swam her way to the Druid Circle, making sure to activate her Circlet of Shadow so that the acursed Othmir would not hinder her. She wanted to cover her ears as she ran through the Othmir camp. That music…Innoruuk’s glare! That awful music!<br>
 <br>
Vandergrave began to form a response, the green script forming mystically in her mind. “I am on my way.” She willed to the ether. She only hoped is was not too late…<br>

Stormygale had been spotted . . . several times . . . in North Karana, where she had issued a warning to a foolish young druid before speeding off on her beautiful white mount . . . in South Karana, riding past the aviaks . . . in the pass from Lake Rathe to the Rathe Mountains . . . and that was the last. None of her young halfling watchers dared venture into the lands of the hill giants.<br>
<br>
Saphron sat in the dingy room thinking. She was thinking not only of Stormygale, but of her own present, past and future. She missed her friends in Natural Selection. Her new friends in The Imperium Knights were wonderful people, to be sure, but they just did not stoke the fires of adventure that had long lain dorman in her soul. She wanted to see the Planes, but felt too tired, or too unneeded, to do so. She knew that her old friends Quaras, Salar and even Temyez had joined the guild that Stormygale had grown to call her new home, the Claw of Nagafen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Athene?&quot; Saphron said to the contemplative druid as she studied her maps.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I feel empty inside. What do you know of the Claw of Nagafen?

Traveling the lands with Saphron was delightful, even in circumstances so dire.  She might as well just be frank about all the twisting turns her mind had taken since she had left the Ring and set out on her own.  Her eyes glistened, a mixture of humor and sadness.  “After our talk in Rivervale, I thought briefly of trying to revive Natural Selection.  I visited the guild tree—still in good shape, still some good souls there, … but so few.”  Athene’s voice grew wistful, her eyes staring not at Saphron but into the past.  “You could probably tell from some of the messages I sent you over the last few weeks that I was pondering whether it might be possible to bring it all back.  But it’s too late.  It didn’t take me long to see that, and I suppose it’s a blessing that I realized it quickly.”<br>
<br>
Saphron nodded.<br>
<br>
“I’ve exchanged a few messages with Quaras.  He’s mentioned the Claw, though I don’t know how serious he is.  He’s expressed a lot of concern for Stormygale too.  She’s often been gone.  Now that I’ve seen her eye-to-eye—brief though it was--I sense the pain she is feeling is incredibly deep, and I don’t know which is worse for her—the physical injury or the heartache.”<br>
<br>
“Probably a torturous blend of the two.”<br>
<br>
“Aye, I suppose you speak true.  Temyez has left the lands.  Have we spoke of this?  My mind is so muddled I can’t recall.”<br>
<br>
“I knew.  Demitasse, told me.”<br>
<br>
“Ha, … so you have met Demitasse?  In the old guild hall or elsewhere?<br>
<br>
“The guild hall.”  Saphron smiled mischievously.  “Quite something—that dwarven lass.” <br>
<br>
“Indeed.” <br>
<br>
Both chuckled, and then the two women sat silent for a while.  They knew how fond Stormygale had been of Temyez.  His leaving the boundaries of Norrath and Abruzi’s death had occurred within the same year.  Either event would have been difficult to get past, but adding to those sad circumstances was the break up of the council of Natural Selection, which had preceded both.  It had been a year of disappointments for Stormygale.  And her initial delight and excitement after joining the honorable and established guild The Claw of Nagafen had been marred by some physical injury from which she had not recovered.<br>
<br>
“I’m not sure she has totally forgiven me, Saphron, for leaving the guild, for how it all fell out.”  Athene smiled broadly.  “But I know she loves me still.”<br>
<br>
Saphron raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“When she saw me in the inn, she waved.”  Athene nearly cackled.  “Now think had I been a certain dark-elf enchantress.  Think she would have waved?”<br>
<br>
‘Heh, no, … I think I would have been restoring your soul to yer blackened corpse.”<br>
<br>
“Never was a druid more aptly named than that Stormygale, eh?”<br>
<br>
And so, it was more or less decided.  They would seek out the Claw after they brought Stormygale El`Orian home.<br>

She had nothing better to do, and it helped her think. &quot;can HELP!&quot;  What did Athene mean by that? <br>
<br>
Oh it had all been very clear what Athene had been doing at the inn in her wedding dress. Probably the fanciest robe Athene owned. Lord knows it was beautiful and Athene and Nurul had looked so fine as they took their vows high on the castle overlooking the Twilight Sea. It was clear Athene was going to try to use her finest garment to  wheedle information out of the innkeepers, but they would never have talked. Athene didn't know the password. <br>
<br>
Stormygale then wondered what had happened to that marriage. Had the marriage failed? There was a time when Nurul and Athene could not be parted.  Stormygale hadn't seen the intimidating Nurul in months, and hadn't seen Athene anywhere near him.  And Athene had gone guildless. Left the Ring. Well, Stormygale hoped Athene enjoyed it. She remembered all too clearly how it was to be completely alone. Her guild fallen apart because Athene had decided it would be so. Anger, hate. Loneliness. Followed by the death of her mother and almost immediately following that, the loss of Temyez.<br>
<br>
Temyez. The one person she had always counted on had let her down. He had up and left the world, never to be seen again. She had Athene to thank for that. And while she'd been lucky enough to find a new home in the grand and wonderful Claw of Nagafen, she was now crippled. Useless. Better off dead.  What possible good could she be to a guild who needed active members when she could barely stand to walk?<br>
<br>
She sipped her brandy and threw another pebble. <br>
<br>
She kept thinking of the icy bridge as one entered Thurgadin. She had always wondered what was down there. Maybe it would soon be time to find out. Oh, no levitation. She'd find out the fast way.  One glorious view to appease her curiosity and then she too would be gone. She and her pain. She and her resentment. She and her anger. <br>
<br>
In a morbid way the game of cat and mouse with Saphron and Athene had sparked a bit of life back into her, but it, like everyting else, would fade and become an illusion. The two people she had loved most in this world had left her within weeks of each other. Stormygale had then had the accident with the dragon and the next morning her black raven locks had gone white as snow. <br>
<br>
An icy sign that kept calling to her.<br>

Soon maybe, eh?

She had won this mount in an expedition into the Temple of Ssraeshza, and had no idea at the time just how valuable she would become.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quickly, my Willow,&quot; she had murmured to her pony, &quot;We must reach that awful giant city by nightfall.&quot;<br>
<br>
She had gone to Thurgadin on her own, on a hunch, to look for Stormygale. She knew there were some secluded inns, and some even more secluded drinking establishments there. None had seen her friend, but she had overheard talk between a couple of relatively youngish (and quite ale-logged) rangers in one of the seedier bars in the town. They spoke of a white-haired woman traveling on horseback in the &quot;Lands of the Mother&quot; and how she had easily vanquished a mighty panther.<br>
<br>
Saphron knew that Stormygale would not seek out the Plane of Growth, for even she could not stand the Icy Mother of All enough to seek shelter in her plane. Besides, Saphron thought . . . no booze there.<br>
<br>
She had also made sure to seek Tondar out once again before leaving ShadowHaven. She patted the medicine bag he had given her, holding it close to her as if it meant life and death. And . . . she knew it just might.<br>
<br>
Willow traversed the snow-covered crags deftly and quickly, and soon, they had passed through the pass to the Eastern Wastes and were nearing the great canyon to Kael. Saphron shivered, not because she was cold, but because she still did not like to travel through this evil city, even after several seasons of doing so.<br>
<br>
Dismounting outside the city gates, she whispered to Willow, &quot;Rest now, my friend, I'll need you in the Wakening Lands,&quot; and Willow evanesced into vapor. <br>
<br>
Preparing her best mind soothing spell, she prepared herself for the arduous journey through the city of the Frost Giants.  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:gold;font-family:Garamond;font-size:medium;">Saphron LaFeete</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:garamond;font-size:small;">High Priestess of Bristlebane </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#141419><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=revil>Revil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Officer</span><br>  Posts: 1501<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/20/03 1:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> Slowly creeping into the city of Skyshrine unseen. Revil, hoping to snatch a purse or 2 on his way thru going to Temple of Veeshan hears a pebble hit the wall, and than another. Some alternating patterns of  “tap” than “tap tap”. Getting a grin on his face. He knows for who his first pickpocket of the long drudging day will be. Making sure he stays to the shadows unseen by any of the kin’s lackeys for Revil is not welcome to the great city of Dragon kin since he turned on them long ago. <br>
<br>
“Ah, yes nothing like the fresh warm blood of a dragon to make your toes curl in delight”, he whispers to himself as he sneaks from shadow to shadow. The closer he gets to the pebbles hitting the wall the louder it gets. Like the ringing of a freshly strung up drum getting ready to see it’s first battle of bloodshed. Revil whispers to himself with ever step he gets closer to the archway, “This person must really have problems. I’m not sure whether to feel more sorry for the wall or the pebbles.”<br>
<br>
He slowly moves into position of the archway to take a peek inside. As he is about to scout the surrounds of the room “Whack” a pebble hits him in the forehead. Quickly gathering himself securely around the corner to be sure he won’t be seen. He rubs his forehead wondering if the person inside saw him, or just threw the pebble wildly, and missed the wall completely.<br>
<br>
Quickly thinking, he uses this to his advantage to get into the room, and measure up his first loot of the long tiring day. Revil picks up the pebble that hit him. Slowly creeping into the archway ready for another pebble if it comes. He gets a good view of his surrounds, and analyzes the room for anything he can use to his advantage.<br>
<br>
First thing Revil notices is a beautiful drunk woman. Even though she is a little tipsy while drinking her brandy. Her long white hair shines, and glows with every tilt of her neck. He watches as she slowly stumbles, and crawls to get another pebble to throw at the wall. Her long white hair slowly falls from the top of her head down to her cheek like Felwithe’s finest silk dresses slowly flowing, and swaying around the sleek and slender bodies of the loveliest elven beauties in Norrath.<br>
<br>
Taking peaks out the corner of his eye, not taking his sights off the woman he analyzes the rest of the room. So dull, and empty compared to the sight he sees before himself. Revil mutters so the woman doesn’t hear, “She is too beautiful for this room. There must be a reason why she choose the most dullest, and unentertaining rooms of the kin to set up camp.”<br>
<br>
Noticing he won’t get her attention by just talking to her while hidden. Revil uses the pebble he got hit in the face with to attract her attention, and scare her a bit since she seem off in her own world of thought.<br>
<br>
Revil tosses the pebble as hard as he can against the wall, but making sure he doesn’t hit the woman.<br>

For many minutes she kept completely still listening to the silence between the incessant casting of the stupid dragon guards as they refreshed their spell buffs. What a bloody noisy lot they were and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>WHO</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> had thrown that pebble back at her? <br>
<br>
She listened so hard it made her ears ring. Or, well, maybe that was the brandy. Finally deciding to act nonchalant, as she was sure someone was there, she sat up and pulled her hair away from her face while she took a sip of her brandy. As she set the bottle down, she slyly realized that she still had her port to Wakening Lands memorized. She could escape anytime she wanted, but first to have some fun with whomever was playing games. She stood and walked to the bed and bent over her packs as a ruse while she incanted &quot;See Invisable&quot; on herself. Her eyes glimmered, but they glimmered while she had her head in a pack. It was highly doubtful it was noticed. <br>
<br>
Then as she had it memorized still, she cast Improved Camo which unfortunately the person in the room with her would be able to see, but there was no helping that. She was fairly certain whoever it was, was in the room, or if not, in the hall directly outside. <br>
<br>
She turned around to see the heels of the little jokester vanishing through the door. So! She did have an intruder! She'd bet good platinum it was a sneaky rogue or someone like that. That heel had been too small for a runter rogue, and not hairy enough. Too small for a human. Maybe a half elf? Well, she'd see.<br>
<br>
She picked up her brandy bottle and sat on the bed, leaning back and getting comfortable against the wall, sipping her brandy and waiting. Surely the little thief would return, not being quite sure if she'd been just refreshing buffs or not. Especially if she made no move to follow and if he or she hadn't actually seen Stormygale disappear.  So she sat and she sipped and unrealizingly got drunker and drunker as she did so, until she closed her eyes one last time and they stayed shut; the half open bottle falling from her hand to lay sideways on the bed, almost, but not quite spilling the remaining contents. Her unconsious body slid sideways over the top of her packs, squashing them a bit but she was out cold and snoring. <p><b>Stormygale El`Orian</b><img border=0 src="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" /></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#141419><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sylvrwolf>SylvrWolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 236<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/21/03 8:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.datamagick.com/images/dancing.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> On her trek through the lands, checking on the various leaders of the dragons, Kalyndria was grateful that she had kept her faction with them friendly. &quot;Though,&quot; she mused, &quot;it won't be that way for long.&quot; Many times throughout the past, she had been taunted by friends and guildmates alike to leave behind the allies she had and join the Giants against them. Up until now, she refused. With a dissapointed sigh for lost friendships and wondering why she chose now to switch sides, she continues on toward her last stop, Skyshrine.<br>
<br>
After porting into Cobalt Scar, she sees a human in a purplish robe trailing sparklies behind her. &quot;Hrm,&quot; she mumbles to herself. &quot;Is that...VANDER! Wait up!&quot; Quickly casting Flight of Eagles on herself, she hurries to catch up with the Necromancer. <br>

Even so, the diminutive cleric was knocked from her horse. As she slammed into the tree, she saw the tigeraptors racing at full speed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get to safety!&quot; she screamed to her beloved Willow, who disappeared into the ether immediately.<br>
<br>
Turning, Saphron saw the great Frost Giant Commander lumbering her way, muttering something about ruining his lands. Mustering up all the energy in her broken body, she cast her most powerful stun, and watched as the giant's eyes glazed over. He would be out of commission for a few seconds, anyway. <br>
<br>
Now on her feet, Saphron hobbled toward the dark cave that she knew would harbor some sanctuary. She knew the tigeraptors would not be far behind, unless they had decided to attack the stunned giant. <br>

No time to think. Just run.<br>
<br>
Somehow she managed to make it to the end of the cave, where the emotionless sentinels gazed at her amiably.<br>

Shaking her head trying to clear it, she tried to remember.... something.  Pebbles... pebbles... A sneak!  <br>
<br>
Forgetting her pain, she quickly checked her belongings. All her stuff was there and she sighed with relief. She had items upon her she would not wish to lose. <br>
<br>
As she checked her coinage she realized she was short 10 platinum pieces. What in the world? That rogue could have stolen her blind and sold her into slavery, and there wouldn't have been a thing she could do about it! <br>
<br>
She sat back against the wall and picked up her brandy bottle and sipped it, as much to clear her mouth as for the ever present pain. And then her eyes lit upon ten gleaming Platinum pieces stacked with care right in the middle of the floor.  Stormygale pondered the platinum for a long while before finally getting up to reclaim her money. She admitted to herself, she was completely stumped this time. A compassionate rogue? Who ever heard of such a thing?<br>
<br>
She would dearly love to tell Quaras of it. But she dared not go near him.  He would surely turn her over to her guild or worse,  and she could almost hear his gravely voice, made furry from all his pipe smoking, saying &quot;It's for your own good, lass.&quot;  Bah! He would never understand that there was nothing that could be done. But there was something she could do, and that was move. It was clear Skyshrine was not as safe as she had thought. But this now posed a pretty problem. Where to go? Where to go? Dragon Necropolis? No. Too busy with people raiding there. <br>
<br>
She began to chuckle. Oh no. It was too funny. Should she? She might be caught by that Athene, but she'd have to take a risk.That rogue had made her too nervous. <br>
<br>
Throwing on her packs, she drained the rest of her bottle and memorized the spell. One she hadn't used in a long time. Incanting the words, she vanished in a puff of little rings of energy.<br>

She was tired.  She rubbed her eyes.  She stretched and looked around.  It was very quiet.  The library in the Plane of Knowledge was large and spacious, yet cozy at the same time.  Some of the levels rarely saw visitors.  The recess she chose was one of these.  She had been reading and writing all afternoon and had not been disturbed.  <br>
<br>
Among the documents over which she had poured was the history of The Claw of Nagafen.  It was an interesting tale, detailing its beginnings in the days when the two greatest living dragons known to man were the Lady Vox and Nagafen.  Some documents were more mundane—lists of current and former members and officers, rules for the division of loot, guidelines for conflict resolution, and others.  One of the most intriguing had been written by the guild’s founder, a scholarly necromancer.  It was titled <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Battle Tactics: The Writings of Sun Tzu</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, annotated by Vandergrave.<br>
<br>
Late in the afternoon, Athene had begun penning her own application to the Claw, but she would not submit it unless she gained Stormygale’s approval—and made sure that Quaras's suggestion that she consider pursuing his guild were serious.  Salar’s name she did not find among the most recent list of members.  They had been close companions in the days following the discovery of Kunark.  But since that time, and her marriage, and the decline of Natural Selection, they had lost contact somewhat.  He had gone on—first to another guild, then to other lands.  She still heard from him occasionally.<br>
<br>
In former days, the guild had communicated by telepathy.  It was not a skill one had to develop in the usual manner.  It was more a matter of being at peace with one’s self and open enough to others to allow their thoughts to pass through.  It was not an ability she’d had as a child; it had come with maturity.  She could remember days long ago when she fought and fished and swam in the vast Karanas—alone, but not really.  Unless she were very harried or deeply absorbed in someone or something, she could often hear the voices of her guildmates shouting their triumphs, expressing their sorrows, giving brief news of the world and the lands in which they traveled.  She was able to respond in kind, sending her thoughts forth where they wended toward those who would hear them.  They didn’t always reach their destination.  One could not intrude one’s thoughts on another who was unreceptive.  In all matters, it was hard to find those who did not wish to be found.<br>
<br>
She tried now with little hope to reach Stormygale wherever she might be.  ~I only want to talk, Stormy.  I think I—I think we—can help.  Won’t you let us try?  Can you hear me, Stormygale?~<br>
<br>
Telepathy was a skill that came most easily to those of very close association.  Sometimes the messages were delayed.  Did they bounce off the world’s edges like echoes?  Athene didn’t know.  She did know nearly a month before she had heard the voice of Abruzi urging Athene to help her daughter.  Saphron had heard it too.  But Abruzi was dead.  From where had she spoken and how long ago?  <br>
<br>
Athene, troubled by ghosts and guilt, collected her things.  She was oddly tired and had a sudden yearning to return to the old guild tree.  Perhaps someone there—maybe Demitasse?—had received some news of Stormygale.  Perhaps just being within the sacred tree would help channel her thoughts.<br>
<br>
She sealed the envelope containing a letter to Quaras, pressing the wax down firmly with her wolf-head seal.  She had re-established contact with Quaras over the last few months, but a matter as complicated as Stormygale was something that needed to be discussed face-to-face or through extended correspondence.<br>
<br>
With the letter to Quaras sealed and addressed to the guild hall of the Claw, Athene cast the teleport that would take her closest to what for many years had been home.  <br>
<br>
~Home, Saphron~ her mind breathed, and then in a brief flash of light, she was gone. <br>

As she had hoped there was no one about. She quickly cast innate camo and vanished. Just in time as two more travelers appeared just as she stepped back. Her luck was holding.<br>
<br>
She quietly ran through the glade and out into Qeynos hills where she remained camo'd and on foot until she zoned once more into West Karana. <br>
<br>
Here she had no choice. She called for Doom, and he instantly appeared looking rested an clean. &quot;Hello my love,&quot; Stormygale crooned. &quot;I see you are looking fit and rested. Did you have any luck with that mare?&quot;  Doom arched his neck and snorted, shaking his head back and forth, which Stormygale took to mean that he was still working on it. &quot;I have no doubts, my friend. No doubts at all. How could anyone resist you?&quot; She kissed his nose and then mounted up, and camo'd them both. &quot;Let us go to East Karana.&quot; And off they sped. <br>
<br>
They zoned into North Karana, ran through, and then she quietly held her invisible horse to a slow walk over the bridge into East Karana. There was no one sitting upon it, as there would have been in days past. The old world had become an empty world. But it was lucky for her, as even as slowly as they walked, there was no silencing the sound of hooves on the wood of the bridge. <br>
<br>
From there she turned him right and down the hill into the river. They swam. If anyone had picked up her scent, this would take care of it. Doom was a powerful swimmer, and fast. She kept her camo up and saw no one. <br>
<br>
Finally they arrived at the new destination. A hut, small but serviceable that stood out over the water near a large and noisy waterfall. There was no one in it and she bid Doom goodbye with another kiss and wishes for better luck with the mare. <br>
<br>
Stormygale climbed the ladder and entered the hut and stretched out after kicking off her soggy boots. The sound of the waterfall was soothing and relaxing. For the first time in a while, she felt at peace. she had always loved this spot. <br>
<br>
But there was an intrusion into her mind.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Stormygale... talk..won't... can help!&quot;  What was this rubbish? Ah, she knew. She hadn't had any brandy for a while. Well, she knew how to fix that and rummaged in a pack.<br>

The guild hall -- an almost fortress like structure carved into the edge of the fiery cliffs -- captured like a fly in amber high over the turbulent pools of molten lava that flowed below.  The elderly halfling stared at the letter in his hand and the broken seal and continued to pace back and forth on the high parapets overlooking the molten sea.  Below, inside the teeming guild hall, the morning bells had begun to ring.  The monks had risen from the deep meditation and were practicing their skills, feigning death in the depths of the sparsely furnished practice rooms.  Many of the clerics had attended morning masses in the common chapel and had retired to their private chapels for contemplation and reflection among distant and varied gods.  The shamen -- assembled deep within their icy lair -- had shed the hibernation of a long evening sleep and were restlessly sharpening their claws and summoning their pets.  Quaras paced distractedly back and forth almost ignoring the thunderous plumes of magical energy emanating from the wizard's tower.  He remained focused on the letter from Athene -- an anxious letter from one who was not prone to anxiousness -- and cast his thoughts out to an empty part of the guild hall -- the small druid's grove.  &quot;Stormy has been gone for too long,&quot; he thought to himself.  &quot;What kind of trouble is the wee lass in now?&quot;<br>

The wee girl snored so loud after drink that brandy. He couldn’t concentrate on his task to lift her back into her bed, and cover her for the night from the late night chill Skyshrine gives off from it’s icy walls. Even though he knew she was out cold for a while. Revil took 10 platinum pieces from her purse quickly, and decided to mess with her even more after being ignored. Stacking the platinum pieces in the middle of the floor.<br>
<br>
After doing such a devious deed, he went back to his hiding spot and waiting till she woke up again. Not too long after he placed the 10 platinum pieces in the middle of the floor he hears the woman wake up. Slow, and groggy with a few groans here and there she takes a few sips of her almost empty bottle of brandy. Not too long after he hears a “whoosh”. So Revil peeks into the roam, and the woman is gone leaving only a particle trail to show she was once there.<br>
<br>
“I sure hope that woman is ok, and I didn’t scare her too much. She seemed so troubled before I even messed with her.”<br>
<br>
Revil slowly walks into the room seeing if there is anything he can salvage that she may have left behind. As he steps near the bed in the corner of his eye he sees a quick flash. He turns quickly in the direction of the flash with daggers posed, ready to attack any danger. Seeing no one there he relaxes his attack pose, and scans the room than looks towards the floor.<br>
<br>
“What is this?” Revil mutters<br>
<br>
Revil bends down to pick up a locket. Slowly scanning, and feeling the locket he feels some engraved words on the back. “Abruzi &amp; Loving daughter Stormygale” <br>
<br>
“She must have dropped this in her hurry to leave.” Revil grins.<br>
<br>
Revil slowly scans the locket more, and finds the button to open it. The picture inside is of a peck, and a girl. The girl in this picture must be at least 16 – 18 years of age at the time. Thinking to himself for a quick second. He can make a few plat off this locket, but than thinks about it some more, and decides to return the locket to its rightful owner. <br>
<br>
“Stormygale must be the name of that woman since she is too tall to be a peck. Guess it’s time to visit the Peckville again. Boy do I hate that place, and their munchkin music, but the food is the best in all the lands.” <br>
<br>
Revil stands back up, and hears footsteps of someone coming by. He quickly moves to teh nearest shadows making sure he is not seen. Seems one of the golems is carrying a peck into the room next door. He creeps to the archway, and makes sure his exit is clear. Slowly sneaking his way out of Skyshrine Revil starts his journey to Rivervale.<br>

The place was spotlessly clean, the kitchen was well stocked, a comfortable chair was pulled close by the fireplace hearth.<br>
<br>
Athene stowed her bags in the entry hall as was her custom and made her way to the room that had been Abruzi’s.  On one shelf an amazing collection of rare liqueurs still remained.  Athene considered, briefly, uncorking one and downing the whole lot; but she changed her mind.  She hated to drink alone.<br>
<br>
She sat on the small bed that had been Abruzi’s and studied the pictures on the bedside table.  Except for the two small portraits and a wood carving, the table was empty.  Athene studied the images lost in thought.  In one picture, a lovely, youngish Abruzi gazed out into the distance, … maybe into the future, defiantly full of confidence.  In the other, a very young Stormygale displayed all the complexities of adolescence.  She was captured neither smiling, nor frowning.  She was somewhere in between the conflicting emotions that had characterized her youth.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/saffyre2.jpeg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/stormy.jpeg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
It had been an accomplished artist Abruzi had commissioned to paint the likenesses, and Athene recalled that Abruzi had paid quite a large sum, for she had requested six portraitures actually—the two larger images that graced her bedside table, and four miniatures for two lockets … one for herself and the other for Stormygale. <br>
<br>
Athene felt incredibly sad for no real reason she could identify.  Abruzi had been gone for a long time.  Why was she so deeply saddened now?   Perhaps because not only was the mother lost, but now it seemed, the daughter as well.  Wherever she slumbered in her drunken stupor, deepened by fatigue and pain, Stormygale was conceivably miles from anyone.  She was miles from Athene, from Saphron, from those who still cared …  <br>
<br>
Athene continued to gaze at the portraits, studying the mother and daughter.  Though Stormygale had taken after her father’s people in stature and style, she and her mother shared the same nose, the same pursed lips.<br>
<br>
~I only want to talk, Stormy. I want to help.  Come back to the guild hall.  You know where of I speak.~<br>

&quot;Watch it mortal.&quot; exclaims a voice from out of nowhere.<br>

Zyphin is left with two very disturbing problems, first what has happened to his lord that would cause him to break off communication so abruptly and second who was this Tunarean he was supposed to help.  <br>

&quot;Well I can do nothing to help my lord at this time but maybe if I find and help this Tunarean I can plead an audiance with the Mother of All.&quot; Zyphin thinks as he twist his tunarean signet ring. <br>

Closing her eyes, she tries to concentrate enough to ask her guild if there's been any more information on Stormygale, but she can't seem to communicate with most of them. &quot;Must be because of their affiliation with the Giants,&quot; she mutters. &quot;Bah!&quot;<br>
Passing into closer quarters, she comes across a couple of sentinels carrying what looks to be a halfling. She's broken and battered, and out cold.

This is Saphron, one of Stormygale's friends, and a powerful healer.<br>
&quot;Oh no...Saphron...&quot; Following the sentinels, she watches them set her up in a room, placing her gently on the bed, and her things beside it. When they leave, she goes in and stands above her. &quot;Saphron, what happened to you?&quot;<br>
Gathering in her mind the healing knowledge she has acquired, she sets to the task of mending the broken halfling. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/tamtam/kalyndria3.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

&quot;Saphron?&quot; came a soft voice, unknown to her, yet somewhat familiar.<br>
<br>
Light pierced the darkness as she strained to open her eyes. <br>
<br>
Had she had any energy at all she would have bolted for the door, for she was looking straight into the eyes of a great wyvern. <br>
<br>
&quot;Calm yourself, halfling,&quot; the gently wyvern hissed softly, &quot;It is I, Fardonad Fe'Dhar. You know me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even though she was frightened, Saphron knew she would come to no harm. This was the wyvern who had bestowed upon her the blue armor of Veeshan.<br>
<br>
Beside the wyvern sat a lovely elven druid, a friend of Stormygale's from the Claw of Nagafen, if her clouded memory served her.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is your business in the Shrine?&quot; came a gruff voice from behind the two who had obviously been caring for her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be still Commander Leuz! She came to us in search of a friend,&quot; the wyvern halted the drake's questioning with a wave of his clawed hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stormygale. Where is she? Is she here?&quot; Saphron managed.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, child, she has gone from us,&quot; came the reply in her mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;That human left quite a stench, too,&quot; Commander Leuz barked. &quot;It'll take my men a week to clear the smell of her liquor out of that room!&quot;<br>
<br>
The pain quickly subsided, and as the wyvern and the druid worked together, Saphron was able to stand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for your services my old friend,&quot; Saphron took the great wyvern's hand in hers, &quot;I appreciate you more than you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank the elf Kalyndria, as well. Her knowledge of the healing arts is great, and she has been very attentive. She, too, seeks your friend. Travel with her, Saphron, find that girl. She needs your help.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:gold;font-family:Garamond;font-size:medium;">Saphron LaFeete</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br
