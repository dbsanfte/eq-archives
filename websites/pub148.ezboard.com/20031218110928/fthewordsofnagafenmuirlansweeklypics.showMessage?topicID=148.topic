class=m><span class=title>   The Locket</span><hr size=1> Stormygale sat on the edge of her bed. It was very early morning, where the fog made the trees at the edge of the glade shadowy and insubstantial. Tall denizens with an ethereal transparency. It was beautiful. <br>
<br>
The rest of the tree slept. <br>
<br>
She sat and tried to think. Her back was healing. She felt better physically then she had in many a year and while that should have made her glad, it only made her restless to be on her way. <br>
<br>
She had to find her locket.<br>
<br>
She still didn't feel herself. It was if her head was being split in two with strange random thoughts entering in to torment her. Fear. Then happiness, then fear again.  And a deep seated anger that upset all around her. Stormygale couldn't help it though. It was if she were losing her mind. <br>
<br>
She came to a decision. It was time to look for the locket herself. Athene and Saphron and the Shaman had eased her enough so that she could go on her way with little pain, but she had to find that locket and they were not looking. At least they did not know where to even begin to look. The locket pulled at her. It was almost like a tugging at her soul. She would find no rest until she found it. <br>
<br>
She stood up and quietly gathered her gear. There was no need to awaken the rest, for they would only object to her leaving. Tip-toeing out into the kitchen, she grabbed some foodstuffs to tide her over. Then quietly returned to her room, after a stop at her mother's room to grab a few bottles. <br>
<br>
Packing things so the bottles didn't clank wasn't easy, but it was a trick her mother had taught her years ago. How to protect the precious cargo from breakage. They might come in handy in bribes or trades, as they were very rare. <br>
<br>
She would go to the bazaar first, and hide out in the stable. She would wait for the pull of the locket to guide her. Everyone went through the bazaar at some point. She would just have to be patient. <br>
<br>
She made her bed with a final pat, and left a note for the other's. She didn't want to worry them and there really wasn't anyway for them to help her on this quest. Athene and Saphron would just have to accept that. <br>
<br>
Hoping no one  would hear her, she cast the spell for the Nexus and quickly ran into the bazaar. She'd been lucky. At such an early hour, there were very few people about and none took any notice of her. <br>
<br>
Doom greeted her with a loud neigh and a nussle, and didn't mind at all as she made herself comfortable in his stall. The tall white stallion would act as a body guard. She tried to bribe the little white mare on one side to be silent with carrots, as she knew the pretty little thing belonged to Saphron. The huge tan on the other side she did not know, but assumed it looked to a troll or an ogre for it's master. Poor beast. She fed it a carrot too.<br>
<br>
Now to wait. She settled back in the  straw and chewed on a hunk of bread. One of these days, the new owner of the locket would wander through and she'd have him or her. She wondered if it was the rogue from Skyshrine, or if he had sold it to a new owner. Well she would find out.  Time would tell. <br>
<br>
She picked her teeth on a stalk of hay and waited.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=758233">

<br>
She wondered if she should tell Stormygale what Valtathien had told her in their most recent meetings or whether it would just upset her unnecessarily.  After all, Athene didn’t know how much of what Valt said was true.  The conversations with Stormygale’s father had been protracted and confusing—and mesmerizing—spanning years of history, some of which was new to Athene entirely.  Much of it—the business about Stormygale’s grandfather, for instance—simply defied credibility; and Athene wondered if Valtathien had, in fact, simply lost his hold on reality.  Saphron would likely vouch for that. <br>
<br>
Regardless, Athene was worried or vaguely uneasy.  Whether or not Belthezius had been reborn in a guise very like his son’s, there was the still unresolved matter of the necromancer who had haunted Abruzi’s last days.  Who had that necromancer been, and what had led him to Abruzi?  Could Valtathien’s father actually be searching for Stormygale for the nefarious reason his son had suggested?  <br>
<br>
Perhaps the matter of the locket and Valt’s warnings were not something Athene should attempt to judge herself.  Stormygale was a grown woman, and she was now sufficiently recovered to participate in any discussions regarding her own past … and present.<br>
<br>
Athene would go to Stormygale and lay the entire complicated story before her.  Let Stormy decide what to do with the information.<br>
<br>
That decision made, Athene felt immensely relieved.  She ended her anxious pacing and set her feet toward a goal.  If Stormy were awake, they could speak without further delay.<br>
<br>
... The door was slightly ajar.  Athene knocked lightly, and the door swung inward slowly.  She wasn’t sure of what it was exactly that told her, with certainty, that Stormygale was gone.  Perhaps it was the crispness of the well-made bed or that the room was completely in order.  Whatever it was, … Stormygale wasn’t there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212128><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=saphronlafeete>Saphron LaFeete</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#7A8798>(9/8/03 1:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=148.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Locket</span><hr size=1> Saphron awoke to a bright fall morning. Today would be a good day, she just knew it. <br>
<br>
Stormygale's treatments had come to an end, although Saphron was the only person who knew it. With the help of the shaman Kyusz, and the willingness (or was it willfulness?) and dedication of the druidess, the treatments had been a success.<br>
<br>
Today would begin the recuperation phase. Stormygale would need to be relatively careful with her back, but she could resume some normal adventuring - slowly, but surely. She would not even <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>have</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to remain in the tree, but Saphron hoped she would.<br>
<br>
So, it was no great surprise when Saphron approached Stormygale's room and saw Athene standing in the open doorway. Beyond lay an immaculate room. Stormygale obviously was not there.<br>
<br>
Athene turned and, seeing Saphron, looked at her with quite a bumfuzzled look.<br>
<br>
Saphron smiled at her friend, her eyebrows raising with her shoulders in quite a large shrug for such a small halfling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Frankly, I'm surprised she lasted this long. But, no matter, we have things to do. She'll be fine.&quot;<br>

And with that, Saphron led Athene downstairs, telling her the good news about Stormy's treatments. At any rate, they were not through with that girl.

Saphron was understandably elated that the days of Stormygale’s convalescence had ended.  And who could blame her?  <br>
<br>
The healing process had not been easy on the halfling cleric.  Many were the nights that Saphron had been brought to her knees as her own body absorbed the shock of the wrenching pain she wrested from her friend.  Athene had watched it all, humbled by the power of a true healer and the dedication of a friend.  <br>
<br>
Saphron had loved Abruzi, and Athene knew her devotion to Stormygale in her illness was largely borne of her continuing allegiance to Abruzi.  She would not fail Abruzi’s daughter if there were any other option.  And so, it was understandable that Saphron would revel in the success of Stormygale’s recovery. <br>
<br>
It was a night that they all had wondered, on especially difficult days, if they would ever see.  Athene held her glass high as they toasted the absent Stormygale, giggling like a girl decades younger at Stormy’s ever awful timing—missing a good drink and a such a fine party in her honor.<br>
<br>
But when the evening ended, Athene found she could not sleep.  Something rankled her, something about the room, something she had overlooked, something that might be important.  She eventually made her way back to Stormy’s room.  She needed some reassurance that all was well, that all those things Valtathien had warned her of had not played into Stormygale’s absence.  <br>
<br>
The room was immaculate, further evidence of Stormygale’s recovery.  Her slovenly behavior and heavy drinking had vanished with her pain.  On the bed, one end tucked under the neatly stacked pillows, Athene saw what appeared to be a folded page.  A note.  How had she missed it?<br>

Sadly the relief she was looking for did not come.  She had hoped that being home with her children would lay the locket to rest.  It didn't.  The dreams haunted her even more now.  She saw them in her sleep, when she was drinking he evening wine and staring out the window.  No matter what she did she could not escape the visions the locket was giving her.<br>
<br>
Kissing her children on the head and letting her husband know she would be back soon, she made her way back to the bazaar.  Something in her dreams told her she needed to be there.  But for how long would she have to wait, and who was she in search of?<br>
<br>
She wandered into the bazaar scanning every face she could as she walked by.  Her own troubles lost in the deep pursuit of the people she dreamed of.  Wandering the trader stalls and looking at the wares of all, she was still just as confused as she was the day she had touched the locket.  Nothing new had surfaced and for some reason she could almost hear someone telling her where she needed to be.<br>
<br>
The hope of ever finding anything out about this locket seemed to fade and she decided to set up shop in the bazaar for a while.  Just maybe someone or something would lead her to where she needed to go. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=457580"> Kandiya's things</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

The locket was here in the bazaar. She could feel it calling her. <br>
<br>
She stood up and kissed Dooms muzzle while she brushed the straw from herself. &quot;Thank you my friend for sharing your stall with me. Do you know how much I love you?&quot; She kissed him again for good measure and gave him another carrot.<br>
He whickered his love back to her as she exited the stall. <br>
<br>
She felt it. It was to the left, so Stormygale set off that way, but no, now it was to the right. Stormgale stopped. This was going to be hard. Should she say something by shouting? Or would that send the thief/person running? Oh what to do?  She felt the locket move around and about the bazaar but she couldn't quite get a fix on it.  Finally, she decided to take a chance, and yelled as loud as she could &quot;If anyone has a locket for sale, please come to the stable area!! &quot;  <br>
<br>
And then she sat down and waited. And as she waited she wondered why Athene and Saphron didn't beleive that the locket was more than it seemed. That it embodied all that was her mother and all that saved her from her Tier'Dal blood and her father's madness. They didn't believe her at all. She bet if it had been Abruzi telling the tale, they would have already found the locket. But no. She was just the daughter of a one time friend to these people. They didn't care for her but for the fact that she was Abruzi's daughter. It irked her.<br>
<br>
She had to get that locket back. No matter what the cost.  She was grateful for the healing, but angry at the lack of belief from Athene and Saphron. Would they never accept her as herself? Or only ever as an extension of a dead friend?<br>

Trying to find something of interest to trade with.  As she did so she glanced up for a moment.  Her heart almost stopped.  Not even realizing she was talking out loud, &quot;It's him...errr well maybe her, it's the one I saw in the tavern.&quot;  Kandiya yelled &quot;Hey you, the one with the locket, may I have a moment........&quot;<br>
<br>
As Kandiya yelled she heard a female voice shouting, &quot;If anyone has a locket for sale, please come to the stable area!!&quot;  Kandiya paused &quot;Nah, it couldn't be.  It's not possible, I have spent all this time searching and......but what if it was, or what if it was a trap......I'm so confused,&quot; she didn't even realize she was talking out loud to herself again.  Glancing around at the people near her, whose looks almost frightened her, they thought she was insane.  Kandiya realized that she had stopped in mid conversation with the dark cloacked figure and starting looking around......he or she was no was in sight.  Kandiya sighed.  I guess it never hurts to go check things out in the stables.  And with that she was off.<br>
<br>
Making her way to the stables she kept her eyes out for any sign of the cloaked figure.  Approaching the stables Kandiya inched closer.  Standing behing a few traders in hopes no one would see her.  She scanned the area looking for any sign of trouble.  Looking for the woman who shouted.  And praying that this was the right choice to make.<br>
<br>
As she scanned the stable entrance she saw a small human leaning against the wall.  A strong sturdy woman, seeming to have something on her mind.  Yet Kandiya couldn't see her face.  So she waited.  After a few moments the human looked up.  Kandiya's heart fluttered with every emotion possible.  She wasn't sure what to say, but that was the human she saw in her dreams.  It was her finally after all this searching.<br>
<br>
Kandiya stepped out from behind a the mass of traders she was hiding behind.  And inched her way to the stables.  The human looked up at her and their eyes locked.  Kandiya couldn't move, she couldn't speak she just stood there and starred.<br>

<br>
Stormygale's breath was almost non-existant as she waited to see what this woman would do. One thing was for sure. She wouldn't get away. If she decided not to return her property, well she would not leave this bazaar alive. <br>
<br>
The woman looked deep into Stormygale's eyes and the fear almost overwhelmed her. She saw the determination in those blue eyes, and the death that lay behind them. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=758233">

<br>
Hearing the human repeat herself again, &quot;Yes, it's you. I feel it on you. It pulls at me. May I have my locket back? You can open it up if you like, and inside you'll find two portraits. One of me as a young woman with black hair, and another of my mother, a halfling. I know my hair is not the same color. Something happened to me and it changed. Please, will you look? I will pay you any amount you ask for it, but I must have it back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Finally Kandiya got the courage to speak, &quot;I.....I....I don't have it.  I have been searching forever for the person I was dreaming about, and that person is you don't know why but I had to find you.&quot;  The words poured out of Kandiya's mouth as the tears started to stream down her face.  &quot;I felt the pain and still do, it has consumed everything, and the faces just keep flashing....&quot; Kandiya stopped to take a deep breath, she was so excited she forgot to breath.  &quot;Sadly I do not have the locket you are seeking, but I have seen it, I have touched it, a dark cloacked figure....I ran into them....Thurgadin...&quot;<br>
<br>
Kandiya watched as the expressions on the human's face changed.  She was sure what to expect.  She had spent so much time hiding from people to protect her own children that she was afraid what this human may try to do to her.  She was very rusty with her spells, and wasn't sure she could defend herself if she had to.<br>
<br>
As Kandiya starred something pulled at her.  Something or someone was standing right behind her.  The whole bazaar just seemed to freeze as if someone had stopped the passing of the days.  A rush of confusion ran over Kandiya, her dark blue skinned turned a pale blue, the world began to spin.<br>
<br>
&quot;I...I...&quot; and with that Kandiya fell to the hard floor and was out cold. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=457580"> Kandiya's things</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

She staggered a bit as the weight did bad things to her back, but she gritted her teeth and moved back into the stable, and back into Doom's stall, where she put the inky down gently in the straw.<br>
<br>
Doom sniffed the woman warily. He was not fond of the blue skinned ones and bared his teeth and moved to bite and trample when Stormygale quickly intervened. &quot;No my love,&quot; she said as she took his huge head in her hands. &quot;You must not kill her, but I must ask you to guard her. Do not let her go or get out of this stall. I need to go for help, and I need her here when I return. Do you understand, my love?&quot; She kissed his nose after he snorted his disgust. &quot;You must do this for me, Doom. I beg you.&quot; At that, Doom's head came up and he arched his neck as he whickered his aknowledgement. But his ears still lay flat against his neck. He'd do it but he didn't like it.  <br>
<br>
This woman would go no where. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be back as soon as I can.&quot;  Stormy bent and rummaged in her packs and left food and water for the woman. Then she sat and memorized the spell that would take her back to the great tree. They wouldn't laugh now, Athene and Saphron. This woman had been touched by what drove Stormygale and it has damaged her. This was not her imagination and now she had proof. She stood and cast her spell and ran as fast as she could to the tree, but as she slammed open the door she could already feel the emptiness of the place. They had gone. Well, she couldn't wait. She must return to the woman before Doom changed his mind. He was not always trustworthy.<br>
<br>
She cast the spell that returned her to the Nexus. Then she sent out a call for Saphron and Athene. It irked her to have to do so, but only they could help solve this, and help her get her locket back.<br>
<br>
She returned to the stall to find that Doom had eaten the food she'd left for the woman, but that he hadn't trampled her, which is what she had feared. <br>
<br>
That woman had something to do with the locket. The smell of it was all over her, otherwise she wouldn't be so pulled to her. There were questions to be asked when this woman came to. Stormygale sat down in the soft straw on the other side of the stall, and waited for this inky to awaken. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=758233">

She was on Luclin.  Her voice expressed urgency but not danger.  Stormygale must have found something.  <br>
<br>
Quickly, Athene set out to repack her bags.  As soon as everything was safely stowed again for travel, she flipped open her spellbook and repeated the words and motions that should pull her through to the Nexus.  The electricity crackled, and the portal opened.<br>
<br>
As soon as her feet touched down on the other side, Athene dashed off for the Bazaar.  If Stormygale were not there, she would try Shadowhaven.<br>
<br>
The Bazaar, as usual, was crowded with people.  Athene drew her bags close to her and pushed her way through the knots of people blocking the passageways and the bank entrances.  She had to get farther in to get some sense of who and what was there.  <br>
<br>
Scouting the stalls of vendors warily, she began to make her toward the less densely populated avenues away from the banks.  It was there she began to sense Stormygale’s presence within her tracking range and soon after her voice.<br>
<br>
Turning a final corner, Athene found herself before a horse stall in which sat Stormygale resting comfortably on a bed of straw.  Athene nodded to Doom, and then she stopped dead when her eyes came to rest on a Teir’dal female out cold on the other side of the stall.<br>
<br>
“Friend of yours?” said Athene, not sure if Stormygale were in the mood for a gentle joke, but there had to be some way of broaching the topic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#141419><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kandiya>Kandiya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#7A8798>(9/11/03 8:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=148.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Locket</span><hr size=1> The visions hit Kandiya harder than they had before.

Seen me in visions. Something about Thurgadin and a dark figure wearing a cloak. She's felt the pain. Then she went and passed out. I didn't know where to put her, so I carried her in to the stall. Doom won't let her get away.&quot; She reached out and gently patted one of his massive legs.<br>
<br>
She watched Athene as she studied this inky in Doom's stall, and wondered what she was thinking. Athene had certainly had more to do with the dark people than Stormygale ever had, even if she was a part inky herself. &quot;Well Athene, here's my proof. I have got to get that locket back. Look what it's doing to this woman I've never met? The only safe place for it is around my neck. Now will you help me? I have got to find it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Athene bent and checked the woman who was was twisting around in the straw, caught in some powerful vision, it seemed.  &quot;Something is surely happening to this woman. When she awakens perhaps she'll have more information. Maybe we'd better get Saphron here to check on her, although she looks healthy enough.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Athene sat back on her heels and looked at Stormygale for a long moment.  &quot; I've been speaking with your father, and he has told me a tale....&quot; and she began to repeat what Valtathien had told her, while Stormygale listened and fed carrots to Doom. Finally Stormygale said &quot; Athene, that's the worst pile of insanity I've ever heard from my father. He's lost his mind you know. This locket had to do with my mother, not my father. It a protection, not a curse. Please, please help me find it...&quot;<br>

At that point the woman began to awaken and Athene gently lifted her head to give her a few sips of water from her flask. &quot;Now Miss, who are you? And what do you have to do with the locket?&quot; <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=758233">

<br>
Saphron's voice rang out as she rounded the corner into the stable. Willow had called to her the moment she had heard Stormygale speak Saphron's name.<br>
<br>
Looking down at the elven woman lying in the straw, Saphron immediately became wary.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> doing here?&quot; she inquired. It is no secret how halflings feel about Teir'Dal, in general.<br>

And even though she was groggy and still slightly unaware of what happened she heard a small voice, &quot;What is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> doing here?&quot; <br>
<br>
With that Kandiya starred right at the little woman. &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> eh?  Well that has a name.  My name is Kandiya Holytears.  I was not expecting such an exciting welcome,&quot; as Kandiya nodded and tried to hide the evil smirk.  Kandiya understood the uneasy feelings that everyone had twards dark elves.  Though she had her own troubles at hand with her kind she knew she was not here to have a dispute over such petty things.<br>
<br>
Kandiya took a deep breath.  &quot;I came.....well I should say it called me here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>It</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.....what do you mean <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> called you here,&quot; as the taller human blurted out.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry I don't mean to be rude, but I don't know your names.  I have seen your faces many times and I would like to put a name to the faces finally.&quot;  Kandiya wanted to flee, she was terrified, trying to be bold was not her strong point.<br>
&quot;Before we continue we must move, we are not safe here,&quot; the fear in Kandiya's eyes almost put a chill down there backs.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see no point in going anywhere with you,&quot; bosted the small woman.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please, I will gladly tell my story.  But we are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NOT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> safe here.  We must move now.  Please take us to The Plane of Knowledge.

&quot;Oh, and remember, Doom could always chase her down like a rabbit. Only he might just trample her instead of stopping her. He's not fond of the blue people.&quot; <br>

She eyed Doom, who's ears were still laid flat back against his neck as his eyes watched the Teir'dal woman. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=758233">

If she were to flee, it is likely she would seek you again.”  <br>
<br>
Saphron said nothing for the moment, but it was clear from the set of her hands on her hips that she was displeased.  “Besides,” Athene said, “she’s Claw … or probably will be.”<br>
<br>
Saphron’s eyes widened, and a look of vague recognition flickered across her face.  “She is?”  Then her eyes narrowed, and she addressed the woman.  “Kandiya Holytears, you said?”<br>
<br>
The young woman nodded quickly, her eyes darting from face to face. Either she was truly terrified of something, or she was a consummate actress.  Athene, who did not share Saphron’s innate distrust of the Teir’dal, did not believe she was acting. “Her name is listed among the guild applicants on the public recruiting board outside the guild hall,&quot; Athene said quietly. &quot;Of course, there are many names there, but I remember hers.  She’s a cleric.” <br>
<br>
Saphron, who had had less time to interest herself in guild affairs during the days of Stormygale’s convalescence, was interested now and a bit less distrustful—but only a bit.  The bid to join the Claw could be a ruse to gain access and information.  She and Stormygale exchanged a meaningful look.  Stormygale was fiercely loyal to her guild.  If Kandiya were not honorable in intentions, she would bear the brunt of a Stormygale-led, public relations nightmare that would haunt her the rest of her days.<br>
<br>
“Let’s go, Ladies!” said Stormygale, her mind made up. “Quickly!”  <br>
<br>
The air around the three pulsed with energy as Stormygale’s spell illuminated the stall with a crackling flash of light.  Athene felt gravity give way as the portal opened.<br>
<br>
Then the three disappeared from view.<br>

Stormygale urged them to follow her to a secluded spot she often camped at. No one would bother them there, or be able to come at them unawares. Not with the huge walls of the city at their back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kandiya, will you speak now? Or would you have me tell my tale first? Perhaps that would be easier,&quot; Stormygale said. <br>
<br>
&quot;The locket was stolen from me by a rogue while I camped one night in Skyshrine. I was drunk and he stole 10 platinum peices and the locket. The platinum he left stacked neatly on the floor as if to mock me. The locket he kept. Where it is now, is anyone's guess execpt I think you know of it, because I can smell it on you. It has touched you and you have felt it's power.&quot; Stormygale paused, and reached into her pack for some brandy. She passed it around along with a couple of Misty Thicket picnics. <br>
<br>
She leaned against the starlite wall and continued. &quot;We are not here to hurt you. Only to find my locket as it is only safe around my neck. Look what it has done to you. It was charmed by my mother who passed away to be a protection for me. I do not know what it would do to others, but look what it's done to you. Will you tell us what you know of it? I would be very grateful.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sipped her brandy and ate some crackers from the picnic and waited for the woman to stop trembling and speak. She hoped she'd hit the right tone. This woman was afraid and Stormygale desperately needed to know why. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=758233">

She dug through her packs looking for some water.  She nodded slightly at the woman holding the bottle, &quot;No thank you, I will pass on the brandy hon.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will gladly tell you everything I know, but first may I please know your names?&quot;  Kandiya's voice still trembled slightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fair enough, my name is Stormygale, this is Athene pointing to the more laid back woman, and the short runter there is Saphron.&quot;  Saphron made a small grunting noise as she shifted her weight.  She still was not't quite sure of this dark skinned woman.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you.&quot;  Kandiya's voice barely trembled now.  &quot;I'm not suer where to start, so I assume the Beginning is the most fitting.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kandiya sipped from her flask of water, took a deep breath and began her long story.  &quot;I was in Thrugadin.  I had just finished up a quest and was going to see the Dain.  Sadly he was not in.  I figured I would make a bed in the tavern and rest for the night and seek out the Dain in the morning.  While I was in the tavern I saw this dark cloaked figure holding up a locket talking and chatting amongst some of the others around.  I figured I would use my charm and maybe but the locket for my daughter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kandiya paused for a moment and started digging through her bag again. &quot;Ah wine a much better selection.&quot;  The smirk she gave seemed almost evil.  Athene assumed it was the Teir'Dal in her.<br>
<br>
Kandiya started speaking again, now her voice was cool and calm and finally relaxed.  &quot;When I touched the locket.  I saw things you could never imagine.  There was so much hate and blood shed in the first vision.  You were all there.......it was horrible.&quot;  Tears slowly streamed down Kandiya's face.  She went on to tell about all of the visions she has had since then.  The expressions of each of the three women changed with each passing word.  What seemed to be disbelief and mistrust in the beginning, turned into puzzled and yet comforting expressions.<br>
<br>
&quot;My fear is more of what will come out of this.  Seeking this person out will only do more harm.  They are waiting for you Stormygale.&quot;  Kandiya's eyes darkened and her voice got softer.  &quot;You must make her come to you......&quot;<br>
<br>
Athene stopped Kandiya. &quot;Her what do you mean her?  All you have spoke of is this dark cloaked figure.....I see nothing that leads you to believe this person is a female.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kandiya nodded, &quot;Yes you are right, but before I heard Stormygale shout out in the bazaar, I saw the &quot;rogue&quot; as Stormygale has put it.  The smell was sweet like a woman's perfume.  I can't imagine a male &quot;rogue&quot; walking around smelling like that.  I went into a daze when I heard Stormy shout.  Please forgive me, I hope you don't mind me shortening your name?  When I finally came out of it the woman was gone.  The bazaar was not safe for us.  She knew you were there and the longer we stayed, the more danger we were putting ourselves in.&quot;<br>
<br>
Stretching her weary body Kandiya went on, &quot;I have troubles of my own keeping my children safe from the torments of Innoruuk.&quot;  Kandiya looked Saphron dead on.  &quot;No, I'm not making this up...you of all should be able to sense that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kandiya waited patiently to see what the women thought and what they thought should be done next.<br>

Perhaps the priests would know . . . or the arcanists . . . even the necromancers might shed some light on the situation. <br>

At any rate, there was bound to be a profit to be made.<br>

The Bazaar was bustling, but there was no one there who could impart the necessary information. That was clear. And no one in Thurgadin had wanted it, nor had anyone known anything about it.<br>
