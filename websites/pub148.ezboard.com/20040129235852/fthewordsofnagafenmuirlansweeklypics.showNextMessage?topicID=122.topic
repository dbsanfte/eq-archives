slowly through the now empty guildhall, lost in her thoughts. She'd become malcontent with the way things were going, and unsure of herself in many ways. There was so much going on that was drawing her attention from Norrath, and she wasn't sure what to do about it. Far away voices demanding her attention, among other things. She had found she couldn't enjoy things the way she used to.<br>
These were her dark thoughts when she ran into Kandiya, returning from Tradeskilling in the Plane of Knowledge. <br>
&quot;...Kaly, hellooooo...are you there?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm sorry Kandi, were you calling me?&quot;<br>
&quot;I was, but only curious why you're here and not out hunting, or your usual tradeskilling. Something wrong?&quot; Kandi asked. &quot;Perhaps so,&quot; Kaly conceded.<br>
&quot;I find I have no interest in things as I used to. I'm not sure what to do. It's got me a little depressed to be honest. I've always enjoyed every little thing. And now it's all...I don't know.&quot; She smiled at her friend. Kaly had known Kandi since she had put in her application to Claw, and had found a fast friendship. She enjoyed teasing the darkelf, particularly tugging on her long snow-white hair. (Kaly was secretly envious that Kandi had such beautiful hair, but was too attached to her coloring to change it in any way....but then Kandi didn't have to know THAT.) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I'd never live it down!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She thought.<br>
&quot;I'm glad I ran into you. I've been doing some thinking lately, though you may not like what I have to say I'm afraid I don't see an alternative. Will you come with me back to my rooms?&quot;<br>
Kandiya frowned at Kaly's serious tone. This wasn't like the Kaly she knew. Kandiya decided to follow Kaly and listen to what she had to say.<br>
<br>
When the two were settled, Kaly explained how she'd been feeling to Kandiya, certain that her friend would understand. &quot;I&quot;m sorry Kandi. I want to stay but I don't think I can anymore. I was wondering if you would take care of my things for me. I don't believe I can take them where I'm going. Not quite sure where that is going to be yet, but I need to find my way again.&quot; Kaly wiped the tears from her eyes. &quot;I want to stay, but I don't feel like I'm advancing anymore. I'm not going anywhere and I don't like the feeling.&quot;<br>
Kandiya hugged the druid close. &quot;It's okay, Kaly, really. Have no worry about your things, they'll be well taken care of.&quot;<br>
&quot;I knew I could count on you, my friend. I appreciate it immensely. I don't know how I can repay you...&quot; Kaly said.<br>
&quot;Think nothing of it!&quot; Kandiya exclaimed. &quot;And the only thing I want in return is for you to come back to us someday.&quot;<br>
Kalyndria grinned through her tears. She knew she could count on Kandi to help. &quot;I'll come back. I just need to go my own way for a while. Thanks, hon, for everything.&quot; Kaly hugged her friend, and tugged on her hair.<br>
&quot;Ow! Why you..&quot; Kandiya grinned. Still the same ol' Kaly. <br>
With everything taken care of, her place assured to stay, Kaly felt as if a great weight had been taken off her shoulders. She bid her friend farewell, and took a last longing look around her quarters in the Claw of Nagafen's Guildhall. Then, casting a spell, she raised her arms above her head, and faded away.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
/ooc I haven't felt like playing EQ for some time now. I'd log in to play, only to find myself logging out again a few minutes later, having done nothing. Not even speak to a friend. I don't know what's come over me to make me feel this way, but I've given my account over to Kandi and Dos, on their word that they'd take care of her for me until I came back. I hope someday to return to Norrath, to wander the Guildhall, and hear the voices of my friends and family once more. I WILL come back, it's just a matter of when.<br>
Be safe everyone. I'll haunt the msg board, so you can still harrass me. Besides I'm too nosy to not come check up on people. *grins* I just can't find my interest anymore. <br>
I'm going to miss you all. You've become a second family to me, don't think you haven't. And I've thoroughly enjoyed being the Guild Brat /nod. There's so many of you I want to name, but this being a REALLY long post as it is, I won't go into it. But I'll send a great big *HUG* to everyone. If you want to, my email is kaitlainmage@hotmail.com. I check it every day, and you all are welcome to spam me there...if you get too annoying I'll go back to being a major brat /grins.<br>
Be safe, take care. I love you all.<br>

The work was personal, of no consequence to the guild, but still ... it had to be done ... and it left precious little time for roaming the lands, chatting with friends, or raiding among her guildmates.  One day the work would be complete, and she would step back out into the main hall ... looking for adventure.<br>
<br>
She was shaken from her deep concentration by something almost imperceptible ... a shimmer of freshness ... of green ... and a faint whisper of a voice ... Kalyndria's.  And then it faded away.<br>
<br>
Athene felt briefly mournful, but there had been something in that moment of passing clarity that spoke of light-hearted friendship ... and goodness, so Athene returned to her work, ... somehow refreshed.<br>
<br>

She had not know Kaly for very long, but they made a quick friendship.  She still stared ahead as if Kaly would appear in front of her saying it was all a joke.  Kandiya knew deep in her heart that Kaly was serious.  It was just wishful thinking.<br>
<br>
Walking down the guildhall Kandiya kept thinking.  She remembered the first time she had met Kaly.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I thought she was insane!&quot;  Kandiya burst out and she stifled her tears and turned it into laughter.  Covering her mouth she thought to herself, &quot;They will think I am insane if I keep bursting out like that!&quot;<br>
<br>
There friendship grew quickly as if they had been friends all of their lives.  Stopping in Kaly's room Kandiya sighed very deep.  She relaxed as she looked around Kaly's room.  She had small trinkets on the shelves.  And on the very top shelf she saw a sparkle of something tucked under a piece of tanning.  Kandiya stretched and stretched till she could get her fingers on it.  Bringing the item to Kaly's bed, she sat down and began to unwrap the shining item.  It was a diamond she had imbued for Kaly a while back.  It was one of the first imbues Kandiya had done.  Of course the diamond didn't quite turn out like it should of.  Kandiya had mixed up the words while trying to imbue Justice on the gem.  And instead the gem had little blue sparkles floating in the inside of it.  Kaly had told her it was ok, and the gem was very pretty.  Kandiya had told her to keep in as a sign of their friendship.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't think she would actually keep the gem.&quot; Putting her hands over her mouth.  &quot;I need to stop talking to myself,&quot; Kandiya looked in the mirror, &quot;You are insane woman!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kandiya wrapped the gem back up and placed it on a lower shelf.  She would be in her every now and then to dust.  She knew Kaly would be back one day.  And there was no reason for her to come back to a dusty old room!<br>
<br>
Walking out of the room and cracking the door slightly Kandiya whispered quietly, &quot;Good bye dear friend.  We will see you soon I'm sure.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=457580"><br>

But please remember that someday you may get it back, be it a day, a week a month or a year.  <br>

You are one of the rare few Kalyndria that I call friend, and whether you're on this shard or not, your name will stay on my friends list. Be true to yourself. Your friends luff you.<br>
