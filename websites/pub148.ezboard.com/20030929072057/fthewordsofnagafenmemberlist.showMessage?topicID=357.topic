class=title>   New Member - &lt;Athene&gt; - 65 druid</span><hr size=1> Greetings, Claw.<br>
<br>
I would like the opportunity to be considered for membership.  <br>
<br>
I’ve been playing EQ since a month after its release.  Athene has always been my primary.  She is a lousy solo-er, which, I guess, actually means I am a lousy solo-er.  I feel that I’m a team player, and I prefer to group with friends and guildmates.  I also consider myself a roleplayer at heart.        <br>
<br>
I’ve just returned to Norrath after a brief sabbatical, and I’m looking for a guild with a friendly atmosphere where I will still have some opportunities to raid and get to know and group with guildmates. <br>
<br>
Until the spring of last year, I was a member of a very small (primarily roleplaying) guild called Natural Selection.  This guild was originally created for the alternate characters of Silent Thunder, which was druid only.  When Silent Thunder was retired/dissolved, a lot of us moved our primaries to Natural Selection.  I was guildmates there with Quaras and Stormygale, and with Salar, who was a member here before he retired (I hope temporarily) from the game.  I am also acquainted with Sylvene from working a little with Stratics EQ2.  (I don’t think we have ever grouped in game though.)<br>
<br>
Last spring, I joined Ring of Valor.  I had a few friends there from the early days of EQ, and I felt the lure of wanting to experience the often-called “end game.”  I enjoyed my time there.  It was a totally different experience, and I have nothing bad to say about RoV.<br>
<br>
However, this past March, I took some time off from the game to try to get some perspective.  The pace of RoV was/is very intense, and it has been especially so these past few months since PoP.  I needed to balance my real-life obligations and interests (family, work, and friends) with my devotion to the guild and its goals.  The end result is I know I can’t really keep up with the required pace of RoV and be fair to myself.  And trying to remain in the guild as a casual player isn’t really fair to my former guildmates, many of whom are nice people who invest a lot of time into this game.  Therefore, after writing to my guild leader (Waylander) and my class officer (Wulftyger), I removed myself from the Ring of Valor.<br>
<br>
It is, however, a lonely world without the voices of guildmates; and almost all of my friends from Natural Selection have now moved on to other guilds though we do still keep in touch via tells and roleplaying (stories) on the NS board.  <br>
<br>
In the last year, I’ve learned a lot about the Claw from Quaras and Stormygale.  They—knowing me and my situation, personality, and playstyle—suggested I think about applying for membership here when I returned to Norrath.  <br>
<br>
After joining some of your guild members on an impromptu raid on the BoT towers last night, I decided to make my formal application.  I saw a lot of good things on that raid, not the least of which was the respectful banter and conversation.  Everyone was so positive.  Regardless of whether I am accepted into the Claw, I'll always have a good impression of its members based on that experience.  <br>
<br>
Toward joining, I have read the charter, and I would try my utmost to uphold it.<br>
<br>
Other basic things I might should include ...<br>
<br>
I am flagged for the elemental planes and have the scepter for entry into Vex Thal.  <br>
<br>
I do not have keys for Veeshan’s Peak or Sleeper’s Tomb.  I totally missed out on those zones; and if I were accepted into the Claw, I'd really enjoy exploring those regions.  <br>
<br>
Of my planar spells, I am missing Blessings of the Nine, Winter’s Frost, and Destroy Summoned (all level 65).<br>
<br>
I have 65 aaxp points, including Mass Group Buff, which I realize isn't really a lot considering the amount of time I have invested in the game, but that's what I have.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I think that covers a lot of the basics.  (I hope this isn't considered too long a post.)  I look forward to getting to know more about the guild and your members if that would be all right with the officers and membership.<br>
<br>
~Sincerely,<br>
~Athene<br>

<br>
I have known Athene for over 3 and a half years in game.  She is one of the most skilled druids I know, but more importantly is a consummate storyteller, roleplayer, and devotee of Norrath.  She knows more about Norrathian lore than anyone else I know in EQ.  More importantly, she has a sterling character and is a highly skilled player.<br>
<br>
I have been chatting with her about the Claw for a long time and believe she would be a great fit.  She is a lot of fun to group with, knows her class exceedingly well, and is very loyal to her friends and guild.<br>
<br>
I would be very happy to have Athene in the guild and I VOUCH wholeheartedly for her application.<br>

<br>
Athene is... my friend. My mentor, my trusted advisor. She is everything that is good about this game.  Positive, mature, and out of everyone I've ever met in the three years I've been in Norrath, the person I love most in this game. <br>
<br>
She represents all of what a druid should be. She knows her class, and is absolutely the best grouping druid I've ever met.  She has taught me so much about grouping, (being a solo druid,) that it's basiclly her skill that got me into the Claw. Between Athene and Quaras, they have made me what I am as a druid. It is their knowledge that helped me grow. <br>
<br>
She would fit into the CoN, and I have no doubt that CoN will come to love her as I do. <br>
<br>
As you all know, I rarely vouch for anyone. I only vouch for those I have absolutely no doubts about and have known for a long, long time. I know Athene and I know CoN, and I have no doubts at all in giving her my utmost support. <br>
<br>
Please, group with her. Get to know her. You will see.<br>
