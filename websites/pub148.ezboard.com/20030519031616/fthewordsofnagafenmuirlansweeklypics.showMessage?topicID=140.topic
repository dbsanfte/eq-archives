valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   sins of the grandfather</span><hr size=1> The man behind the bar, or boy if you would judge by his apperance, whistled a raunchy tune as he counted the days take.  Despite being located within the forest of the dead, the earnings were more than satisfactory.  That would be due to the standing tradition of accepting cliental no matter the color of his skin (often dark blue or mottled green) or the color of his money (just as often a shade of slowly dripping red which seemed to gather in ominous puddles throughout the many dark and shadey corners).  <br>
<br>
That's not to infere that all of the patrons were of the unscrupelous sort.  This particular establishment carried with it a bit of fame and infamy.  The Lusty Oar, or better known to the holy types as Caldor's Feigned Brewery, attracted many who wished to momentarily bask in the aura of the one who defeated Lucin-- the evil paladin of Freeport and grandfather to the current owner-- then get more faced than a gnome at a high elf nudist colony.  <br>
<br>
Rodlac stopped his whistling as a new face appeared at the bar.  One could always tell a newbie by the same mistake.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gimmie a Caldor House, lad,&quot; a thick beard and beady eyes said under a helmet half the wearer's weight.<br>
<br>
Rodlac handed him a tankard.  The beard slugged back the brew and looked toward the distance with the air of a man who has just decided that his mother in law isn't all that bad after all.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Gah,&quot; the beard gahhed, &quot;Yer father wasn't to ken on the process was he?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid my husband never was much of a brewer, how about a Bleeding Brain, on the house,&quot;  a soulty voice that seemed to reach into areas of the libido not wholley appropriet to be reached into slinked from behind Rodlac.  The beard and beady eyes clashed with a sudden reddening of the barely perceviable area under the helm.  It muttered a hurried thanks, a lecterous leer, and a hasty retreat.  <br>
<br>
Hard to blaim him.  Tantrika had lost none of her appeal since the Freeport incident.  Luxourious blue skin, supple bosom, hair that flowed like cascading shadows even in still wind, and legs that did indeed go all the way up.  Essentially, the other half of the tavern's success, and Rodlac's mother.  <br>
<br>
Tantrika adored her son.  He looked much like his father-- tall, slender, blonde wavey hair with a touch of dark blue at the tips from his half dark elven heritage, and the same peircing blue eyes that suggested a soft heart, a warm shoulder, and with concent the possibility of a hot bath with a little elven wine.  He did however lack the muscle tone, battle scars, and dedication to a noble cause that made his father famous.  <br>
<br>
The problem with being the son of a hero and nearly three quarters elven is that not only do you have to live in your father's shadow all your life, but you also get a few extra centeries to think about it.  <br>
<br>
As far as Rodlac was concerned, those centeries were best put off untill the end.  But, what kind of story would that be?<br>
<br>
The door slammed open.  Not an unusual occurence in and of itself considering most trolls and ogres think of this as a form of knocking.  Unusual is the holy paladin who entered emblazed in full regail (most paladins, as a rule, enter in dark hoods and avoid eye contact).  Also unusual was the many soldiers who followed.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the name of our God, we find this estableshment in contempt.&quot; the paladin shouted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, ye tried the house brew yerself too then,&quot; the beard bellowed.  <br>
<br>
***next time, A Monkey and his fools shall soon part.<br>

Indeed he had before tried the house special and has since fought savegly to rid himself of the after taste.  But that was not why he was here today.  Well, not wholly why.  About a month ago, a mysterious wild rabbit managed to jump into the mule of a high ranking priestes and ever since the hammer of morality's been kicked into overdrive.  Now, a city such as Freeport thrives solely on the business of travlers from not so holy places.  Therefore, the paladins moved thier battle away from the thieves guild, gambling halls, water holes, gogo poles, and those involved with the &quot;entertainment&quot; industy to the outlands where taxes were uncollectable.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You are hearby ordered to close down this establishment of sin.&quot;  Paladin looked around the room with the air of the self rightous.  The patrons glared back.  Paladin checked to make sure his troops were still there.<br>
<br>
Tantrika spoke several words in dark speak.  A table of trolls blushed.  <br>
<br>
Paladin knew just enough of the language to know she requested certain parts of his body to be stuffed into other parts most unpleasent. And something about his mother and a pack of gnomes.  His body stiffened in rage.<br>
<br>
&quot;heathen harlot!&quot; he spat.  &quot;still thy tounge before I have it chopped loose.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rodlac stepped out from behind the bar.  He carried a sturdy stone tankard.  His steps steady and heavy against the wood floor.  <br>
<br>
Paladin sneered.  &quot;And just who do you think you are now,boy?&quot;  He stepped forward, sword clanking against steel shod boots.  Brown locks fell over brown eyes, head down slightly, peering under sharp brows.<br>
<br>
Rodlac whistled, sharp and single.  A troll stepped from shadows toward Paladin.  Half a goat carcass swung from his left club of a hand.  A slab of haunch hung pierced upon one jagged tooth jutting out from his lower lip.  His other hand carried what may have been a life threatening pike, or a simple toothpick.  Either case, it was longer than Paladin's leg. The troll grabbed him and held him to the ceiling by a swiftly crunching arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm the guy who decides if you keep your heart inside your body,&quot; Rodlac grinned.  <br>
<br>
&quot;What are you waiting for?  Charge!&quot; Pal screamed to his troops.  He did not enjoy the noticable delay as they contemplated just how loyal they were.  <br>
<br>
The troll looked to the doorway.  Fire leaped from the frame, forming a wall of flame, yet did not consume the wood.  The heat forced the troops back.  The troll looked back to Pal and spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir, I'm afraid I must ask you to leave here at once or we will be forced to prostitute.&quot;  Pal's eyelashed curled from the rank breath.  <br>
<br>
&quot;That's uh, prosicute.&quot;  Radlac said.  &quot;But the rest was good.&quot;<br>
<br>
The troll smiled.  Pal snorted.  &quot;as if you know what the word means, brute.&quot;<br>
<br>
The knuckles and shoulders of the Troll popped ominously.  &quot;How dis?  Me show you what me think, you tell me after.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Pal gasped as the hand upon his already crunching arm bone bore down with more force.<br>
<br>
<br>

The troll hurled Pal through the door.  Pal picked himself up,signalled his troops, and left.<br>
<br>
The tavern fell silent.  The shamblings of the skeletol waiter the only sound as it moved about collecting empty mugs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice job, Big B, Rodlac said at last.  He held out his hand to the troll.  He recieved a cold glare.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cal-Door wud not need ass-sentance fer one like dat.&quot;  The troll returned to his dark corner. <br>
<br>
Rodlac moved closer to his mother with a questioning look on his face.  &quot;Bloodclot yerns to journey once more, as he did with your father.&quot;  Tantrika spoke wistfully. Rodlac remembered the look from her stories when he was a child.  <br>
<br>
&quot;As do you,&quot; Rodlac noted.  &quot;So go ahead, I'll take care of the tavern.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tantrika shook her head.  Wisps of silver swayed over the blue skin of her face.  &quot;We must all go together..<br>
<br>
&quot;What for?  We make plenty of money, we don't need to adventure for riches.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not for riches, sweetie.&quot;  Tantrika scraped her thumbnail over the bar top unconciouly.  Her other hand snaked behind her back, fingers weaving spells of death and pestalince that, if she had not removed the heart runes of, could immidietly empty the back room of all patrions... as well as several acres of foilege.  <br>
<br>
&quot;A mute point&quot;  A coy smile.  &quot;Tomarrow there will come an end to this place.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;The paladins?&quot;  Rodlac snickered. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes dear.  The paladins in Freeport are a bored, tenatious lot tricked by thier god to destroy what brings pleasure.  They will return with seige weapons.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Isn't that a bt extreme?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Silly boy,&quot; Tantrika giggled. &quot;Zealots are extremist by definition.  And BLoodclot injured more than just his pride.&quot;  She spun around and faced the crowd.  &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; the assasins and necromancers scoffed and banged mugs against the tables, the holy men and honest merchants looked around with guilt.  &quot;As of now, the Lusty Oar has retired.  Free drinks for the rest of the night, however I do suggest leaving at dawn.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned back to Rodlac.  &quot;Pack up tonight, we leave when the moon tells us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Luna speak sooon&quot; Bloodclot's voice boomed above Rodlac's ear.  <br>
<br>
She shrugged.  &quot;Before the mourn, Luna will not answer more than that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bloodclot nodded.  &quot;Will pack much food fer journey.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Shaman.  We hunt and move light, like the old days.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cal-door hunt dat journey.  Now Rod-Lack bring fud?&quot;  Bloodclot looked the boy over.  &quot;Pack too packs, me carry.&quot;  Bloodclot marched through a side door to his room, a makeshift partition in the stable.  The smell of hair and horse sweat reminded him of home.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miss mudda.&quot;  He sighed, gathering stores of salted meats and fruits into his packs.  He paused a moment, looked to the sky and spoke.  &quot;Cal-Door, mentor friend...&quot;  He cleared his throat and looked to theground.  &quot;Cal, journey complete, promise over, got dat?&quot;  <br>
<br>
He grasped a large mallet that, according to rumor, was gilted in the melted scales of a silver dragon.  Bloodclot knew what silver dragon tasted like, this was not it.  &quot;Shudda taken da other choice, much more easy.&quot;<br>
<br>
------ Midsummer's Nightmare -----<br>
<br>
Tantrika sat near the fire, equipment by her feet.  She leaned back in the wooden chair, worn down by years and claws.  The celebrations had calmed to low muttering.  Tantrika's pet deader had pulled all the kegs to front room to allow the patrons to serve themselves.  She occasionally sipped on a mug of tea as she ran a stone over a short sword.  Unneccessary due to the runes blazed into the blade, preventing dulling of the edge.  <br>
<br>
The act brought back memories.  Katlain, the warrior drow who died protecting Freeport from Lucan.  She had sacrificed herself to give Caldor life.  Love of a friend, Kat said, was more powerful than any bond of servitude or marraige.  <br>
<br>
Caldor's voice wispered behind her eyes.  &quot;Ain't those different names for the same thing?&quot;  <br>
<br>
She smiled to herself.  Cal, her sweet fool, the cynical athiest monk.  His last breath was proposal.  Glancing up, she noticed the skeletal waiter watching her.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Sit, Adore.  You will journey with us.&quot;  Adore sat on the floor, by her feet.  Pin pricks of blue light watched her unwavering.  His body remained completely still.  Adore had remained at her side for as long as Rodlac could remember.  From the short time Rod spent in Nerriak, he could tell that necromancers did not typically name thier animated companions, nor were they kept preserved for more than a few days at a time.  Yet this one seemed to be a pet of sorts, possibly even a silent friend.  <br>
<br>
But Rod did not think of this as he stood before the window in his room.  The stars shinned ominously dark this night.  A large bundle layed upon his bed.  A shape, a griffon, swooped before the moon... full, tinted red, hanging ponderously in the sky.  Sat heavy, the matress of his bed giving little give under his weight, and thought of the journey ahead.  <br>
<br>
&quot;This is bullshit,&quot; he said to himself.  &quot;Even my own mother does'nt understand.&quot;  He slammed his fist into the bedpost.  It cracked from the force, nearly in half with a solid outline of his knuckles pressed into the wood.  &quot;I am not my father!&quot;  His screams echoed back to him as if the air about him had turned to thick fog, distorting his own voice, sending a chill through his spine.  <br>
<br>
He sighed, continued to stare at the moon.  A dark shadow began to creep over, from top to bottom, an eye winking at him.  A tingle ran through his body, anticipation or anxiety?<br>
<br>
He stood, lifted his bag (a grotisque grafting of leathery hide that gave the impression of an evil gaze but did seem to make his load a little lighter), and made his way to the front room.<br>
<br>
Tantrika greeted her son as he entered the room.  &quot;Luna has given us leave.  We journey once Bloodclot joins us.&quot;  She stood up.  The sword hung holstered over her back, worn only in memory of Katlain. Attacked under both wrist, rigged to leap into her hands with a flick of wrist, her daggers quivered in anticipation.  The runes that made the blades bite deep and true also granted them limited awareness.  They were now aware that their fast would soon end.  <br>
<br>
A tug at her wrist gained her attention.  A gnome, small for even his race, gazed at her with sorrow in his eyes. Chomskie, beardless under a black bandana tied about his neck,bright eyes under bushy white brows, and approxemetly a dozen or so weapons hidden about his person.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So den, you really do mean to retire?&quot;  Tantrika nodded.  &quot;Ack! And what about our business agreement, huh blue buns?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Our... agreement?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, I leave you an yer friends be, and take my price from the lushes.  We've been doing it fer years now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe you forgot to mention this arangment to us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah... well, no harm done.&quot;  Chomskie shrugged.  &quot;Still though, what am I to do fer money now?&quot;<br>
<br>
Bloodclot's door slammed open.  He carried two packs, each wrapped around his massive shoulders rather than across the back.  He hefted the silver hammer, smiled.  &quot;Lady blink.  Go now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just a moment dear shaman,&quot; Tantrika said.  &quot;I've but one last item to conclude.&quot;  She looked down at the gnome.  &quot;It is not my concern.  Now go, little one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chimskie's eyes lit up.  &quot;I'll go with yer party.  Ken make quite a few silvers slaying and plundering.  I need just a moment to ready myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me like idea.&quot;  He smacked his lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, little one.  We make haste this moment.&quot;  Chomskie groaned.  &quot;However, take what pilage remains here and find a new benifactor.&quot;  Tantrika, sweet and kind as she is, was still a necromancer to the core.  <br>
<br>
&quot;And these drunks?  You leave them to the coming army?<br>
<br>
&quot;They have been warned.&quot;  She shrugged.  With that, she turned to the egress and strode with deep purpose.  Rodlac and Bloodclot followed.  At the door, Rodlac stopped to glance back one last time.  He gave a deep sigh and walked out. <br>
<br>
Shoulders hunched, Chomsky went to work cleaning the money pouches of the remaining guest.  He climbed the stairs to check the rooms.  A few gold, a decent sword, some locket of gold that would sell for a nice price once the picture of pair of twin babies was scratched off.  <br>
<br>
He approached a door near the end of the hall.  He reached for the knob when sound caught his ears.  Inside, sloshing of water and a female voice mutterring to herself too quiet to hear.  He carefully creaked the door open.  <br>
<br>
Inside, lounging in a tub of steaming bubbles, a beauty with black hair slick with soap.  &quot;ah,&quot; Chomskie thought.  &quot;The injured girl.  Forgot she was still here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chomskie silently closed the door.  He treaded toward the next room.  A thought struck him.  The tavern had been earned of the coming army, but she would have no idea.  He stopped in his tracks, torn between looting and the memory of soap bubbles clinging like lovers to the gently sloping curve of her amble bosom.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Damn this sence of chivalry.&quot;  Chomskie turned back to the room with the girl.  He knocked on the door.  <br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Rodlac slumped down against a tree.  Bloodclot glared at him with a mix of disapointment and anger.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Not time fer camp, get up&quot;<br>
<br>
Tantrika placed her hand on his massive arm.  &quot;It is his first time, let him rest.  His endourance will rise in time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cal-Door wud not need rest.  He make me beg fer rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tantrika glanced toward her son already in sleep's grasp.  &quot;Dear shaman, do you forget your first journey?  How far from the swamp did you make it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Bloodclot looked away.  &quot;Fine, me make fire fer the night.&quot;  He pictured a structure of logs glazed with fire.&quot;  Tantrika pulled a blanket from her pack and covered her son.  <br>
<br>
From the east, sounds of catapaults slinging flaming pitch against the tavern could be heard.  Creaks from logs slowly pulling away from supports were audible.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Good bye,&quot; Tantrika whispered.  Adore stared at the flaming horizen, a wistful impression in it's eyes.  <br>
<br>

<br>
Rodlac awoke from a dream.  Vague memories excaped his mind as alertness pressed oppressively forward.  He tried to draw back the memory, but all he could think of was drake hide leggings.  Curious.  <br>
<br>
Tantrika lay asleep near the fire.  Adore paced patrol around the party's perimeter.  Rod watched the pale glow pinpricks pass in and out of veiw as the shambling mound of skeletal death-denial incarnate weave tween tree and a huge mound of blue tinted green that grinded noisily on the bone of a rather large creature.  <br>
<br>
Bloodclot's eyes penetrated into the boy's.  &quot;Gud.  Yer turn.  Watch well.&quot;  The eyes, sickening green like cabbage left under the sun, slid closed.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, B.&quot;  Rodlac hesitated.  The eyes slit open slightly.  Grunt. &quot;You knew my father and all, and well...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You want to know about him?  Understood.  He die fore you born.  Natural to want.&quot;  Bloodclot shifted his bulk, his neck popping like the rending of flesh from a dragons spine twisted open with a dull awl weilded by a compolsive skitzophrenic.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Dis tell, old story.  Old like mother though not as pretty.&quot;   Bloodclot looked to Tantrika.  &quot;By lil ones standards least.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Meet Cal-Door in sands, we see soon dat.  Sand gi-ant stomp jelly.  Me still young and weak in shaman ways.  Me seek shelter on pillar in tear water.  Cal-Door der wit mudder.  Both hurt in bad way.  Eyes shifty, warey.&quot;  Bloodclot's stature suddenly changed.  His shoulders lifted, chest high, cabbage eyes to the skyline.  He voice, as he continued, boomed and sheltered, like a preacher offering last bastion.  <br>
<br>
Bloodclot approached the two slowly.  Many hummies not like trollies, fer no gud reason.  Hurt as dey were, there were a lil chance, fer Bloodclot knew ways of mending flesh an bone.  Skellie approach as green toes leave da tear water.  It wave rusty metal at Bloodclot.  He hold metal in hand, not making skellie jelly.  Male hummie stand, hand on pillar, strong wood in hands.  Inkie finger pretty red lights in air.  Bloodclot nervous.  <br>
<br>
Bloodclot seek shelter, no blood.  Hummie and inkie warey, agree.  Refuse mending.  Sit opposite side pillar.  Sleep light, nervous.  <br>
<br>
Footsteps splash, splash, splash, grind like troll teeth on gnome skull.  Eyes open, sandie on pillar.  Lil ones scared, panic.  Bloodclot panic same.  Look to water, croc eyes bubble surface all round.  Shark, but not.  <br>
<br>
Dey share shelter wit bloodclot, bloodclot owe dem.  Bloodclot chant shaman toughts.  Magi bolt hit gi-ant toe.  Gi-ant look annoyed, look to Bloodclot.  Fist high, aim fer bloodclot.  Skellie rush giant, bee sting shin wit toothpick.  Hummie an inkie dive to tear water.  <br>
<br>
Gi-ant make skellie jelly, blodclot soon next.  Hold stance, prepare chant.  Gi-ant grunt in pain, reach fer back of neck.  Look annoyed. It turn round.  Hummie stand on shore. He make finger gesture to gi-ant.  Gi-ant run to hummie, follow to dune, smack hard.  Hummie fall to ground, not move.  <br>
<br>
Bolt of magi flashin distance.  Gi-ant follow, kill face set.  <br>
Bloodclot come to inkie.  Say he sorry, too weak to do more.  Inkie shrug, say &quot;Do not worry, Caldor is quit fine, I expect.&quot;  Inkie slink to ground, hurt too much to take no longer.  <br>
<br>
Bloodclot walk to da Cal-door hummie.  Chant spell of mend.  Hummie twitch, red flow stills.  It stands, but weak.  Cal-door look at jelly ribs, wrap white cloth round dem.  Seem stronger.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you.&quot;  Cal-door spoke through mouth blood froth. &quot;Perhaps we three should move to safer grounds and heal a bit?&quot;<br>
<br>
Bloodclot walk toward swamp.  Hummie say dat not safe fer dem.  Collects inkie girl, move to Fee-port.  Bloodclot hesitate.  Cal-door say he know place, move safe.  Bloodclot nod, sencing gi-ant still anger to him and inkie. <br>
<br>
Dey come to Fee-port wall.  Inkie girl feel round wall.  Hand pass through.  She walk in wall, Cal-door follow, so Bloodclot follow.  <br>
<br>
Damp, torch lit, safe.  Da tee of dem slump to ground.  No watch dis night.  Too weak.  <br>
<br>
Story told, Bloodclot closed his cabbage eyes.  Rodlac waits a moment them realizes the troll means to sleep.  &quot;But what then?&quot;  Rod asked.  &quot;That can't be the whole story.  <br>
<br>
Bloodclot snored.  Rod sighed, knowing full well that he should let sleeping trolls lay.  He heard clanking nearby.  Adore, during its patrol, paused during the story.  It moved along its course just as Rodlac looked to it.  <br>
<br>
Rodlac stood and walked into the darkness.  He thought of the story as he relieved his aching bladder.  <br>
<br>
