valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   The story of Rodlac</span><hr size=1> I never knew my parents. When they left me in Connla I was far too young. Though, I remember the stigma of my youth. My adoptive parents never explained much to me. Everytime I questioned, they remembered other jobs to perform more engrossing than my concerns. And so it was. <br>
<br>
By the time I could hold a scythe in my hand I found myself in the feilds, harvesting dawn to dusk to keep food flowing through the town. Times were poor, and famish was rampant. Often my hand would cramp from the work. Eventually, I learned to weild the sythe in my off hand. Soon, I was able to use two at once.<br>
<br>
A local soldier took notice of this. He spoke to my adoptive parents and I was pulled away from the feilds. The soldier took me out to the woodlands, talking of old tales of chivalry and honour, and the days of the Dahnnan, when they still ruled, and of Firbolg assaults to our lands. He spoke of a veil, and of elven kind hiding away; and failing. <br>
<br>
And then he told me of the pact, the falling of the vail and the alliences coming together. And he told me of the threats grave enough to warrent such allience with old nemises. <br>
<br>
It was then he handed me two rusty daggers. I looked at them in confusion for a moment. When I looked back up, he was gone. The sun began to slip beyond the glenn on the horizen and darkness settled. I wandered until the night was black then prepared to make camp. Using brown undergrowth and twigs splitered off of logs with my rusty blades, I made fire. I layed down to sleep.<br>
<br>
A snarling sort of howl echoed in the distance. Another closer came. I startled in my thin blanket, shivering from cold and fright, and arose to stare into the darkness of the forest about me. The firelight flickered shadows to dance across hill side and trunks. <br>
<br>
I stood, daggers weilded in both hands. My ears burned as they listended into the distance. A twig snapped behind me. I spun about to look into the gaping maw of a loathsome creature. Its pale, stretched skin complimented the fearsome talons bared toward me. <br>
<br>
I flung myself backwards, swingingly my right arm out randomly. With luck, my blade connected and warm blood burst outward toward my face. Still, the creature lunged toward me. Claws pressed against my shoulders, pulling me to the ground. I screamed, forcing both blades upwards. The eyes that glared into mine widened and lost focuse.<br>
<br>
I pushed the creature off me and rose to my feet. A subtle stir in the wind around me gained my attention. I turned to the source, raising my daggers before me to block. Another of the fowl beasts leapt at me and into the blades I held. His injuries appeared bad, and he was certainly dead if another had not striked me in the back.<br>
<br>
I fell, howling in pain. The talon rips against my back burned with pestalance. Another of the same race confronted me. It snarled in an almost laugh then leveled its claws for my throat. I attempted to spin out of the way as it's talons screamed toward my jugular.<br>
<br>
An arrow flew into the beasts head. It feel dead atop of me. I struggled with its body, attempting to throw it from me. Just as I has released myself from its oppressive weight, the other jumped atop me. Its talons ripped the earth around me apart as I evaded to my best. Gashes opened along my shoulders and neck to its onslaught. <br>
<br>
I raised my daggers before me in a cross position. The creature shattered its claws against them and fell backwards with pain. An arrow lanced its heart as it moaned, then shuddered in one last convulsion. The creature that had injured itself on initial attack ran. It made about twenty feet before it fell with an arrow protruding from its spine. <br>
<br>
I looked at the source of the arrows. There I saw a blue skinned man. His ears seemed pointed and cheek bones high. He nodded to me then disappeared into the woods.<br>
<br>
The howls around me broke off into a panick at this time. After and hour, I found myself alone in the darkness. The crickets had returned yet sleep would not. <br>
<br>

<br>
The morning sun found me weary and weak.  My wounds had clotted at last, but much blood found its way into my torn clothing that became bandages.  I believe I slept for a moment after the attacks, but at this time I felt too weak to believe such.  <br>
<br>
I scanned the land around me.  I did not recongnize it in any way.  I had never left my home town till now, and knew not of the terrain of the country.  My only clue was that my home existed along the riverside and the day previous we had walked toward the setting sun.  So I turned to the rising sun and knew my home was somewhere in the east and began the walk home.  <br>
<br>
A couple hours passed, hunger pained me like a dagger.  There were plenty of barries along my route, but I did not know if I could trust them.  Too many tales told of poisen from found food.  So, I decided to seek out live meat, something I would know would not kill me.  <br>
<br>
My attempt was in vein it seemed.  After several hours my hunger grew more and the day wained.  I decieded at last to make an ambush in the trees, hoping something would pass under me so I could fall upon it.  After a time, an elk came into veiw.  It grazed around near me, but out of my reach.  I contemplated dropping from the tree and trying to sneak within range of it, but knew my footfalls were too loud to attempt such.  <br>
<br>
As I grew more desperate and became ready to leap and hope for the best, I heard the thump of a bow string.  An arrow periced the elk's heart.  It looked up from its grazing, startled, then fell dead.  A woman approached it.  She had short white hair and facial tattoes.  As I watched, she slung her bow over her shoulder and grabbed the elk by its hind legs.  She struggled to drag the body away.  <br>
<br>
I dropped to the ground.  Her bow unslund and an arrow knocked toward my heart instants after I landed.  I rose both hands toward her, showing I meant no harm.  She lowered her bow, but kept it at ready.  <br>
<br>
I spoke to her.  &quot;I have been wandering this wood fer a whole day now.  I am hungry and have no luck in hunt.  That elk has more meat than one alone ken eat.  If ye would, I offer my help to bring it to yer camp for a meal.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked at me for a moment then slung her bow over her shoulder again.  &quot;Aye, ye look strong enough, and ye are right that this is more than one ken handle.  I would gladly share with ye if ye help me take it back to camp.&quot;<br>
<br>
So I walked over to where the elk lay.  I picked it up and barred its weight over my shoulders.  &quot;Dunna walk too fast, this beast is heavy.&quot;  <br>
<br>
She turned and began to walk away.  I followed her.  My shoulders began to strain under the elks weight.  But the ache in my belly was more important than the discomfert of this.  At last we reached her camp.  I borrowed a knife from her, not wishing to taint the meat with the rust of my blades, and quickly gutted the beast.  Its meat was placed on a spick over the fire.  As we waited for it to cook, we spoke.  <br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Rodlac, I hail from the town of Connla.  I came to this place with a soldier who left me to my own agenda.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Glad to meet ye, Rodlac.  I have come to this place on a mission of my own.  I would tell ye off it, but I dunna think it wise as yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
I simply nodded, not wishing to offend her with questions.  Sides, I was more conserned with the meat over the fire at the time.  However, I could not ignore her beauty.  When we had reached camp, she had removed her leather armour.  As she stood before me now she bore loose fitting cloth breches and a tight fitting cloth top that didn't quite cover her belly fully.  Her hair was unkempt, and despite its shortness fell over her eyes occasionally.  She had a habit of tossing her head to throw her unruly banges away from her eyes.  I couldn't help put think how cute it looked each time she did it.  She looked to be a slight bit older than me.  Not by much, but at sixteen as I was it seemed a bigger difference than I would later realize.  <br>
<br>
The fire crackled each time the blood of the elf dripped into it.  I tried to look into the distance of the stars, but found my eyes wandering back to her.  The silence between us became uncomfertable. So, baring my will I spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye have yet to tell me yer name.&quot;<br>
<br>
She poked at the elk with a knife, frowning at the still pink meat on the inside.  Turning to me slowly, she frowned.  &quot;Aye, I haven't.  I suppose it is of no consequence to say.  My parents called me by the name of Sheena.&quot;<br>
<br>
I stared into the fire a moment.  &quot;Ye say yer parants call ye Sheena, but what do yer friends call ye?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is fer my friends to know.  I appretiate yer company, donna get me wrong, but I far from consider ye a friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
We talked late into the night and feasted on the elk.  The meat was deliscious.  What was left over she salted for later use.  When I laid down to sleep, I dreamed of her in inappropriet ways.  As the sun woke me, she was gone.  In her place was a few days supply of the salted elf meat.  And so it was.  <br>

Expect this to be as long as the Caldor story, but more refined.  I learned a few tricks since then and plan to use then well here.  <br>

It has brought fear to many. So few attempt to go much less return alive. A few of our family have attempted the dragons in there. They fought and failed, untill they knew how to defeat there foes. They learned with others who have slayed these retched creatchers before they would bring thier family into such perilous blood drenched halls. Our first attemt at these creatures had much blood spilled, mostly ours. We wouldnt give up and soon all had trinkets from the fallen dragons. We continue to fight. The dragons turn there heads in fear as Ghit runs at them naked, forgeting to loot his armor. I hear the call to attack and sink my sword in to the dragons ribs. I show no mercy and live for the taste of a fallen dragons blood.<br>
