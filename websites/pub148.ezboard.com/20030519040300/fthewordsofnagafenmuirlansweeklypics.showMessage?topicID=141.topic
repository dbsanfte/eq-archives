class=m><span class=title>   Half-Elf.</span><hr size=1> My name is Delaine.  A half-elf from Freeport.  A half-breed.  Born of a high-elven mother and a human father.<br>
<br>
I never knew my birth-father.  If my foster mother knew, she surely would have told me.  Aye.  I was fostered.  At a very young age.  As a babe, I am told.<br>
<br>
My foster parents are human merchants in the City of Freeport.  Da sells arms.  Swords, pikes, daggers and such.  He is an excellent blacksmith and craftsmen.  Ma works in leather.  She makes leather jerkins, scabbards, quivers.  Mostly complementing Da’s wares.<br>
<br>
I learned the art of swordsmanship from Da at a young age.  Demonstrating the quality of his swords for customers who were often amused to see a young half-elven child trying to heft a sword almost as large as she was.<br>
<br>
Ma had a high-elven friend.  Or so I thought anyway.  I was in awe of her.  So tall and pretty!  I used to hide behind Ma’s skirts and peek out at her when she came to visit.  She would bring me the best presents.  Gifts of toys, sweetmeats and clothing.  I would always be lured out from behind Ma’s skirts and sit, bouncing on her knees, getting my grubby little hands on her robes, playing with the necklaces she wore.<br>
<br>
It was much later that Ma told me that she was my birth-mother.  When I was old enough to understand, I guess.  Maybe I wasn’t.  Because as I recall, I was real nasty to her the next time she visited.  Ma was pretty mad at me, and I guess I upset my birth-mother a lot, because I seldom saw her again after that, but the gifts continued coming.  Sent by messenger, and I still accepted them.  Like Da would say, to Ma.  “Waste not, want not.  Let Lainie keep them.  Afterall… why not?  What would we do with them?  Return everything and hurt her even further?”  Yes, I eavesdropped unashamedly when they talked about me and my birth-mother.  I wanted to learn all I could about her, but never knew how to ask.<br>
<br>
Ma must have continued to send my birth-mother periodic reports.  For the presents that came to me suited each step in my life.  Shurikens when I was learning to throw.  Jewelry to enhance my strength when I chose the way of the warrior.  Pieces of magical armor when I began to grow out of my leather, blackened iron greaves when I complained that leather didn’t cover much of my bottom.<br>
<br>
Ma made me send polite notes of thanks each time, and finally, one day I decided to visit Felwithe.  To learn more of my birth-mother’s home.  I thought perhaps, like all children like to fantasize, that my birth-mother was a Princess.  My birth-father her forbidden love.  Probably a Prince of Qeynos or some such.<br>
<br>
I ended up surprising my mother’s mother.  The grandmother I never knew I had.  She welcomed me with open arms and fussed more than I would have liked.  But she was a kind woman.  Young in the way high-elves were.  They never aged, it seemed, to my eyes.  I realized, that visit, how important my mother’s family was.  Grandmother was Seer to the Royal family of Felwithe.  I also found that I had an aunt, called to Tunare (whatever that meant) and a half-elven uncle who was a bard.  Seemed that my grand-da sowed some wild oats in his time.  I gathered from what my grandma told me, that my birth father was a Cleric of Marr.  He was probably a high-ranking fellow at the Temple.  Who knows? Maybe a high-ranking priest.  But, she would not tell me his name either.  <br>
<br>
“That is for your mother to tell you.  Make your peace with her.”<br>
<br>
I still remember her words clearly.  She was firm and would not be swayed.  ‘Fact, she got angry and scolded me when I tried to press her for more information but she gifted me with a heavy pouch of coin and bade me write and visit.<br>
<br>
That visit to Felwithe also made me realize how lucky I was that my birth mother had decided to foster me in Freeport.  Freeport is a bustling seaport with people from all over Norrath living there.  Half-elves, humans and high-elves were the most common, even though there were also gnomes, dwarves, halflings and the occasional erudite.  I grew up without prejudice shown me.  But in Felwithe, where everything was shiningly clean and elegant, I received short shrift from the high-elven merchants and sneers from town-folk when I asked directions.<br>
<br>
Upon my return to Freeport, I made my decisions.  I had chosen the way of the warrior early in my life.  Now I chose to follow Mithaniel Marr.  God of Valor.  May I one day bring pride to my name and my family.  Both my foster family and my birth family.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if I am worthy, my birth mother will accept me with pride, and my birth father would recognize me as his daughter.<br>

She had no talent for magic at all, but loved the dance of the blade.  Every now and again, a movement she made, a certain gesture, would remind her of her daughter’s father.  The way she frowned in concentration made her want to smooth the frown away like she often did in years gone by with a certain human male, the one that she loved once upon a time.  The one that fathered Delaine.<br>
        <br>
With an inward sigh, she continued her embroidery.  She had not dwelled upon her lost love in a long while, and she was not about to do so now.<br>
<br>
Delaine completed the cleaning and oiling of her much prized weapons and sheathed them carefully.  Putting them down, she stood to dispose of the cleaning rags.  She smiled at the picture her mother and grandmother made.  Drinking tea, doing embroidery.  So dainty and refined.  How did she come about?  She grinned.  Probably from her father.  She was shorter, stockier… after all, her father was human.<br>
<br>
Hmmm… this might be the right time to broach the subject again.  She approached the table.  Her grandmother smiled and offered her tea.  She sat down and accepted.<br>
<br>
So.  Delaine wanted to talk.  Cassandra knew this day would come.  She decided to open the conversational sallies.  “So, have you decided on a surname yet, my dear?  You are close to it now.  That is… if you wish to take a last name?”  Cassandra raised a delicate eyebrow.<br>
<br>
Delaine grinned.  “Well, Gramma, I’m not sure.  You know, I always thought I’d pick a name close to my mother’s or my father’s.  But I don’t know my father’s name.”<br>
<br>
Arawyne put down her embroidery and poured herself a cup of tea.  It was time.  Definitely time.  Taking a sip, she regarded her daughter solemnly.  Delaine watched her with a mixture of wariness and eagerness.  Arawyne set the fine china cup down.  It clinked softly on the saucer.  Picking up a napkin, she dabbed her lips.<br>

His name is Guerissant.  Dalain Guerissant.  High Priest of Marr.”  She said softly then smiled wryly at her daughter and her mother.  “You are named for him and he does not know that you exist, my daughter.  I never told him.”<br>
<br>
Delaine absorbed her mother’s words, and spun the name over in her head.  Over, and over.  Guerissant… Dalain… Dalain Guerissant.  Her father.  Her real father.  Not her foster-father, beloved as he was, her real father.<br>
<br>
Cassandra nodded.  She had always known.  Even if her daughter had not told her.<br>
<br>
“Why, mother?”  Delaine’s voice was just as soft.<br>
<br>
Arawyne looked up and out the window.  “Because I did not know I was carrying you until some time after our final fight.”<br>
<br>
Delaine pondered her mother’s words.  “Was it that bad?”<br>
<br>
Arawyne nodded.  “Aye.  It was that bad.  I was angry.  I was tired, angry and hurt beyond words, and I made him kill me.”<br>
<br>
Delaine and Cassandra both looked at Arawyne, shock clear in their eyes.<br>
<br>
“Kill you!”  Cassandra exclaimed.<br>
<br>
Arawyne nodded again.  “I made him duel me.  I harried him until he accepted, and hurt him until he had no choice but to stop me.”<br>
<br>
“Why mother?”<br>
<br>
“He was being stupid and at that moment, I hated him.  I was tired of being hurt.  So I destroyed the last vestige of love and respect he had for me and I had for him.”  Arawyne drank from her cup again.  <br>
<br>
“There was no chance that I could have won.  He was by far more powerful than I but I don’t think he ever meant to kill me.  By the time I recovered from resurrection sickness, he was gone.”<br>
<br>
Arawyne looked at her daughter.  “I found out I was pregnant with you several weeks after that.  I had been ill, but I attributed it to stress and heartache.”  She smiled wryly.  “Heartache was not foreign to me by that point in my life.”<br>
<br>
“You haven’t seen him since?”<br>
<br>
&quot;Arawyne shook her head.  “Our world is not that large, Delaine.  I’ve seen him now and again in passing.  On a Dragon raid or two.  We were civil to each other.  No more.”<br>
<br>
“But… but…”  Delaine shook her head, confused.  She did not know what to say.<br>
<br>
Cassandra was similarly shocked.  Arawyne looked at her mother and her daughter, then picked up her embroidery again.  She stitched in silence.<br>
<br>
Delaine exchanged glances with her grandmother.  A million questions pressed at her lips, but she did not know how to ask them.  That was one thing she was never very good at.  Words.<br>
<br>
“Mother?”<br>
<br>
Arawyne paused and looked up.<br>
<br>
“Yes, my dear?”<br>
<br>
“Ummm… I… well…”<br>
<br>
“You want to present yourself to him as his daughter.”<br>
<br>
Delaine swallowed.  She worked her jaw but no words came out.  She swallowed and tried again.<br>
<br>
“Do… do you still love him?”<br>
<br>
“No.”<br>
<br>
“Oh.”<br>
<br>
Silence reigned again, but for the lazy buzzing of a fat bumblebee that strayed too close to the window.<br>
<br>
“Umm…  can I?”<br>
<br>
“If you wish so.  You need not ask my permission.”<br>
<br>
Cassandra sighed inwardly again then stood.  “I think we need more tea.  I will see to the kettle.”  <br>
<br>
Delaine jumped up.  “I’ll help you, Gramma.”<br>
<br>
Cassandra nodded and left the parlor, her granddaughter at her heels.<br>

<br>
“Gramma?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, my dear?”<br>
<br>
“What was my birth-father like?”<br>
<br>
“You think I know him?”<br>
<br>
Delaine nodded.<br>
<br>
Cassandra sighed.  “I never met him as Arawyne’s chosen lover, my dear.  I only met him once during a conclave in Freeport.  I had heard much of him though.  A fine upstanding man.  High in the ranks of his temple when Arawyne first told me she was in love with a human.”<br>
<br>
“Did you know when she left him?”<br>
<br>
“No.”<br>
<br>
Cassandra smiled wryly.  “I did not know that she was pregnant, or that she had you, remember?”<br>
<br>
Delaine nodded.  The kettle whistled boisterously and she lifted it off the fire and poured a stream of boiling water into the teapot.<br>
<br>
“Why do you wish to seek out your birth-father, Delaine?”<br>
<br>
The half-elven maiden frowned and tried to put her feelings into words.  “I’m not sure… curiosity maybe?  He is the final piece to the puzzle of who I am?”  <br>
<br>
She shrugged and picked up the teapot.  “Do you think it’s a good idea to seek him out?”<br>
<br>
Cassandra sighed again.  “I don’t know.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t want to hurt Mother.  Not if it brings up hurtful memories or… I dunno…”  Delaine shrugged again.<br>
<br>
“What will you do?”<br>
<br>
“I dunno.  Prolly go back to Freeport.  See Ma and Da.  Heh… Ma would probably know about him.  She gets the best gossip.”<br>
<br>
They walked back to the day room when Delaine stopped before the door.<br>
<br>
“Gramma?”<br>
<br>
“Yes?”<br>
<br>
“D’you think mother should have told him?”<br>
<br>
“About you?”  Cassandra shook her head.  “I don’t know enough to make a judgement.  No one can, except your mother and father, my dear.”<br>
<br>
Delaine nodded again.  “I guess I’ll have to think about it.”<br>
<br>
Cassandra nodded in agreement and opened the door.<br>
<br>
~~~<br>
<br>
Arawyne fumbled with her handkerchief and wiped away the telltale tear that had insisted on spilling out.  The door swung open and her mother and her daughter walked in with fresh tea.  Her smile was only slightly tremulous as she stood and helped her daughter with the teapot.  As she bent to the task of pouring tea, Cassandra and Delaine exchanged looks over her head.<br>
<br>
Delaine opened her mouth to speak, but Cassandra shook her head, and she closed her mouth again.  She helped her grandmother with her chair and took her own.<br>
<br>
After their tea was drunk, Delaine had thought it out.<br>
<br>
“I’ll be leaving after tea, mother.  It’s time I returned to Freeport.  The Estate of Unrest was very good hunting, but I think I need to pay Ma and Da a visit anyhow.”<br>
<br>
Arawyne looked up at her daughter.  “And wring all the information you can out of your Ma about your birth-father.”<br>
<br>
Delaine’s mouth dropped open as Cassandra laughed.<br>
<br>
“Bravo.  Very insightful of you, Arawyne.  Do not tease the child if you do not wish to tell her about him yourself.”<br>
<br>
Arawyne had the grace to look ashamed.  Her heart was wrung painfully, and she had not thought it would hurt so badly after all this time.  She smiled a wry smile at her daughter.  Her mother was right.<br>
<br>
“What is it that you wish to know, Lainie?  Ask and I shall try my best to answer you.”<br>
<br>
Delaine looked at her grandmother gratefully and then the questions spilled out eagerly.  One following the other more and more easily.<br>
<br>
~~~<br>
<br>
Arawyne was exhausted.  After the emotional grilling she had put herself through answering her daughter’s questions about the man she once loved more than life itself, she had taken her own leave of her mother and fled to Rivervale. One of the few cities in which she had not spent time with Dalain, and hence one that did not bring back memories too painful to consider.  She sat on the hillside opposite the bank.  It had always been a favorite spot for her.  As dusk fell, light spilled from the windows and the shadows grew longer until darkness wrapped the city in a blanket of night.<br>
<br>
The tears spilled over now and she cried helplessly.  For the years of loneliness, for her lost love, for her daughter who never knew her father, and not least of all, for herself.<br>

He shook his head with a sigh.  Scrolls and reports.  News and missives of the guild.  He did not look forward to the reading.  Pulling all the papers out, a plain envelope fell to the floor.  He bent over and picked it up.<br>
<br>
Turning it over, he looked at the unfamiliar script on the envelope and frowned.  Who would be writing him?  It had been many, many years since he used to receive letters on a regular basis.  Indeed he could not remember the last time he received one.  He had no living relatives.  Once… once, he had a lover.  But that was long years past.<br>
<br>
Walking back to his rooms, he placed the mail on his desk.  The envelope lay, glaringly out of place among the scrolls and reports.  He decided to open it first.  Tearing it open, he unfolded the single sheet of plain vellum.<br>
<br>
“Dear sir,<br>
<br>
I am but a humble warrior of Marr, but would like to meet you, if you have the time, I would be honored to buy you a drink at the Jade Tiger Inn.<br>
<br>
Delaine <br>
Warrior of Freeport”<br>
<br>
Dalain looked at the letterhead.  Steel Warriors.  What did a warrior maid want of him?  It was dated today, and he wondered if she knew he had just arrived the night before.  He looked at the sun that was still high in the sky and then at the unread reports and scrolls.  Curiosity overcame him and on impulse, he decided to walk to the Arena.  He would learn more of the warrior there in the guild of the Steel Warriors.  He would just have to avoid the guards.  Something he learned to do early in his career as a cleric in the service of Marr.<br>

The cheers and shouts informed him that spectators were betting on the outcome.  Arriving at the gate, he placed his hands on the bars and watched the match.<br>
<br>
A half-elf female was sparring with a much larger barbarian.  The barbarian warrior had the advantage of strength, and obviously the reach of her, but he was using a slower two-handed weapon while she danced around him with sword and dagger.  The spectators whooped as she nimbly avoided a slash and skipping around him, kicked him in the butt.  The barbarian laughed and turning, swung the flat of his blade at hers.  She yelped and scampered out of reach, but tripped over a stone and fell head over heels, laughing and swearing like a sailor.<br>
<br>
Dalain smiled at the play.  Opening the gate, he stepped forward, and offered the healing power of his God.  Both warriors turned in surprise and accepted gladly.  The half-elf held out a hand.<br>
<br>
“I thank thee, good sir.  I am Delaine.  Warrior of Freeport.”<br>
<br>
Dalain took the offered hand and shook it.<br>
<br>
“Dalain Guerrisant.  High Priest of Marr.  You wished to speak with me?”<br>
<br>
Delaine swore and yanked off her helm to get a better look at the Priest.  She swore again when she realized she had sworn in front of him, and then apologized.  Great!  Her first glimpse of her birth-father and she was hot, smelly and sweaty and was swearing in front of him.  Way to go, Lainie girl.<br>
<br>
The barbarian laughed.<br>
<br>
“Looks a little too old for you, Lainie.”<br>
<br>
She turned and made a rude gesture at him.  Then blushed as she realized that she was making a horrible first impression with her birth-father.  This was not going well.  She turned back.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, sir.  Umm…”<br>
<br>
She stammered.<br>
<br>
“Let me get cleaned up.  If you don’t mind… Maybe I can meet you at the Jade Tiger Inn?  That will be safer then a tavern here, I think.”<br>
<br>
Dalain frowned.  For someone that he did not know, she seemed to know of the enmity the guards had for him.  <br>
<br>
“That will be fine.”<br>
<br>
The half-elf beamed a wide smile at him.<br>
<br>
“Oh, thank you, sir.”<br>
<br>
And she ran off.<br>
<br>
Dalain stared after her in her wake, bemusedly.  What was that all about?  And… who did she remind him off?  That was quite a glorious smile.  With a shrug, he waved at the other warriors sparring in the arena and walked to North Freeport, sprinting from the guards when they caught sight of him until he reached the sanctity of the Paladin controlled North boundary.<br>

Smiling, he procured a table in a quiet corner and ordered himself a slice of pie and a flagon of ale.  He was washing down his meal with ale when the half-elf entered.  She was dressed in soft leathers now, her short hair held back with a headband, her weapons sheathed at her side.<br>
<br>
Delaine entered the Jade Tiger Inn with great trepidation.  She was excited, yet afraid.  What was she going to say to her birth-father?  Better yet, how was she going to say it?  She had rehearsed her speech in her head over and over as she cleaned herself up and hurried to North Freeport.  Discarding one version and the other.  Spying the High Priest at the table, she walked on over and held out her hand once again.<br>
<br>
Dalain stood up and shook her hand.<br>
<br>
“Well met, sir.”<br>
<br>
“Well met, warrior.”<br>
<br>
The half-elf smiled, and Dalain smiled in response.  Such a bright sunny smile.  He thought.  Who was it that she reminded him of?  He waved her to a chair and she sat facing him.<br>
<br>
“Let me buy you a drink.”<br>
<br>
He shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Nay, you do not need to.  I have eaten and drunk well.”<br>
<br>
Delaine’s hands shook as she clasped them together.  Now what was she going to do or say?  She stared at the man sitting in front of her until he raised an eyebrow at her.<br>
<br>
“You had questions of me?”<br>
<br>
“Aye.”  <br>
<br>
She exclaimed.<br>
<br>
“Uh… well, not exactly… heh… I mean…”<br>
<br>
She seemed nervous, so he tried to put her at ease with a smile.<br>
<br>
“Ask, young lady.  I do not bite you know.”<br>
<br>
“Oh.”<br>
<br>
She blushed and stammered.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry.  You must think me awfully ill mannered.  I… I apologize for swearing in front of you.  I.. I mean..”<br>
<br>
Her voice trailed off into silence and she looked down at her hands before peeking up at him.<br>
<br>
Her mannerism struck a deep chord within him, and an image flashed into his mind.  But she was speaking again, and he forced his mind to the here and now.<br>
<br>
“Well, sir.  I… umm… I…”<br>
<br>
She struggled with words.<br>
<br>
“I’m your daughter.”<br>
<br>
She blurted out.<br>
<br>
“Oh Marr.”<br>
<br>
She slapped her hand over her face and swore.<br>
<br>
“I didn’t quite mean to say it like that!  I’m sorry.”<br>
<br>
Then she bolted.<br>
<br>
Dalain was too shocked to do more than stare at the chair she tipped over when she made her escape.  His mind whirled.<br>
<br>
“Half Elf!”<br>
<br>
He whispered to himself.<br>
<br>
“Arawyne…”<br>
<br>
The one word was full of despair and sorrow.<br>
<br>
“Did you hate me so much you could not tell me?”<br>
<br>
He stood and leaving coin to pay for his meal, made his way to the guild of the Steel Warriors again.  He had to find her – this daughter of his – and they would have the information he needed.<br>

The better part of town though, he was glad to see.  He was not welcome here either and for a moment, he pondered playing games with the guards of the militia before discarding the idea with a wry smile.  He was on serious business, and really… a little too old to be running through the town on a lark and thumbing his nose at the guards.  Quaffing a potion that rendered him invisible, he made his way to the blacksmith’s.<br>
<br>
The rhythmic tink-ka-tink of a hammer against steel floated through the air, as did the acrid smell of a smithy’s furnace, inter-mingled with the salt air of the harbor beyond as Dalain walked through the town.  The public furnace was free.  Rather unusual for the time of day, Dalain mused as he opened the door and walked into the blacksmith’s.<br>
<br>
Tislyn looked up at the tinkle of bells as the door to her shop opened, then shook her head bemusedly.  There was no one there.  She turned back to her task and continued stacking molds on the shelf.<br>
<br>
“Mistress Tislyn.”<br>
<br>
“Eek!”<br>
<br>
Tislyn jumped at the disembodied voice and dropped the mold she was holding.<br>
<br>
“My apologies.”<br>
<br>
The mold floated into the air and she automatically received it with both hands as a human male appeared before her.<br>
<br>
“M’lord Guerrisant!”<br>
<br>
She gasped in surprise.<br>
<br>
Dalain frowned.<br>
<br>
“You know me?”<br>
<br>
The woman nodded.<br>
<br>
“Aye, sir.  You are one of the high priests at the temple of Marr.”<br>
<br>
She looked around.  Grasping the situation quickly, she motioned him to the back of the store.<br>
<br>
“This way, m’lord.”<br>
<br>
Dalain followed her and they entered the backyard, which was surrounded by high stonewalls.  The blacksmith was working at the furnace there.  The source of the rhythmic hammering Dalain had heard.  One foot was working the bellows and his arm swung the hammer again and again.  Sparks flew from the weapon he was forging.  Never pausing, he glanced at the pair and back at his work.  Tislyn motioned to their visitor and he nodded.  With a final blow to the blade he was working on, he laid the hammer down and dunked the glowing metal in the tub of water next to him.  Steam hissed, covering him for a moment, and then he was peering at the blade.  With a final nod at his handiwork, he set it down on the bench and moved towards the pair.  Removing the towel from around his neck, he wiped his face and then his hands before turning to his wife and their visitor.<br>
<br>
Dalain smiled and held out a hand.<br>
<br>
“Well met, good smith.”<br>
<br>
The blacksmith smiled in return and shook his hand, testing the mettle of his visitor.  Dalain strove not to wince at the test of strength in the man’s grip but offered a firm grip in return.<br>
<br>
“Ashord, this is Lord Guerrisant, come to visit our humble abode.”<br>
<br>
“Nay, Mistress Tislyn, no honorifics, please.  I am but a simple cleric of Marr.”<br>
<br>
Ashord grinned and released Dalain’s hand.<br>
<br>
“Ashord Marner, and my wife Tislyn.  Have you come to purchase a blade perhaps?  Or is it other business you have come about?  I have recently tried a new technique to create a functional blade, but one that imparts much beauty to the metal.”<br>
<br>
He picked up the blade that he had been working on and showed it to Dalain.  Dalain examined it closely.  It was certainly different, and quite beautiful.  There were waves and swirls in the blade, yet it was smooth.  He could not feel the lines as he ran his fingers over it, yet they were there.  He turned it over in his hands to admire the handiwork, nodding approvingly.<br>
<br>
Ashord grinned proudly.<br>
<br>
“Much work goes into it.  The metal is folded again and again to create those swirls you see.  It makes an excellent blade and holds a fine edge.  Unfortunately, I can only make so many of them, and few can afford them.  This is elven work.  I was lucky enough that an elven smith divulged the secret to me over ale one eve.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dalain nodded and handed the weapon back to the smith.<br>
<br>
“It certainly is beautiful.”<br>
<br>
Tislyn had left the men as they talked and now returned with a pitcher of ale and fresh muffins.<br>
<br>
“Some refreshment perhaps?”<br>
<br>
She asked as she approached with the laden tray.<br>
<br>
Dalain smiled and reached out both hands to help her, but she lifted it out of his reach.<br>
<br>
“Sit!  Sit!”<br>
<br>
She bade both men and motioned them to the table and bench.  Dalain enjoyed the simple hospitality of Ashord and Tislyn, catching up with the gossip of the city, wondering all the while how he would bring up the subject of Delaine when Ashord asked.<br>
<br>
“Now what can two simple merchants do for you?  It’s not everyday that a High Priest of Marr dodges the Militia to visit and break bread with us.”<br>
<br>
Dalain was silent a moment.<br>
<br>
“A half-elven warrior maid by name of Delaine sought me out today.”<br>
<br>
He replied.<br>
<br>
“I understand she is your daughter?”<br>
<br>
Ashord looked at Dalain warily.<br>
<br>
“Aye.  She is.  A little scamp she is.  She has not insulted you has she?”<br>
<br>
Ashord turned toward the shop and bellowed.<br>
<br>
“Delaine!  Lainie girl!  Come here!”<br>
<br>
“Shush, Ashord!  You treat her like she is a child.  She is a young woman now.”<br>
<br>
Ashord looked at his wife sternly.<br>
<br>
“A young woman who should respect her elders.”<br>
<br>
Dalain grinned.<br>
<br>
“Nay.  She gave me no insult, but left me questions when we met.  She said a few things and then bolted, arousing my curiosity.”<br>
<br>
“Delaine!”<br>
<br>
Ashord bellowed again.<br>
<br>
“What, Da?”<br>
<br>
A feminine voice bellowed back from the upper floor.<br>
<br>
“I said to come out here!  Now!”<br>
