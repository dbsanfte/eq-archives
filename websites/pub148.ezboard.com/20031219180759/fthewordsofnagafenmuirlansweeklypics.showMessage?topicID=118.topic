class=title>   Character study</span><hr size=1> A background story on three main characters in my latest project.  It's written as a treatment, thus the lack of 'to be' verbs.'  When I do get this produced, you all will get to tell your more ignorent friends, 'well that happened bacause...' and such.  I'm diving head long into this project and hope to see it evolve into a full movie within a few years.  I'm more aimed toward scripting for games, but if I can break into Hollywood, I will be just as happy.  <br>
<br>
Nick, slender with a muscular frame, stands taller than average.  The tight, pale yellow jump suit he wears as part of his costume seems to enhance these aspects of his appearance.  Tossed casually over his shoulders, a leather jacket one size too big compliments a pair of black leather, steel-toed boots.  The boots are high-calf with buckles in place of laces.  His short, light brown hair always looks as though it has been combed with his fingers.  On Nick’s back can be found several scars, the worst of them a four inch diagonal stretching from shoulder to spine about half an inch wide.  They are the result of going through a glass window only half way.  <br>
<br>
Nick can often be found with a gun in his hand.  He developed a special ability that allows him to teleport weaponry to his hands.  The restrictions on this ability prevents him from teleporting any weapon currently seen or held, and he must be able to picture the weapon and location.  He must also teleport the weapon into a place where it would not be seen as it appears.  The place does not have to be large enough to actually hold the weapon as it will begin to materialize at one end first.  Theoretically, Nick could possibly pull a shotgun from a space as small as bad of chips.  <br>
<br>
Nick was born in the city, as were all members of his family since they came to America from England in 1830.  He has three years of junior collage education.  He dropped out in frustration.  He became a police officer shortly after.  Another two years pass and he feels useless.  The officers became nearly obsolete when the superhero business went big.  Nick leaves the force to become a superhero.  <br>
<br>
He learned to shoot a rifle when he was very young from his father.  Nick has a natural proficiency with all firearms.  Fellow officers often made bets about whether Nick would miss a target within fifty shots.  Nick made a killing.  <br>
<br>
Perfectly built for speed and agility, Nick excelled in martial arts.  While far from becoming a black belt, he can hold his own impressively well.  Certainly more than a match for the common street thugs he deals with nightly.  He has a few awards from amateur tournaments.  Due to a busy schedule, Nick can only train once or twice a week.  <br>
<br>
Nick owns a small collection of books.  He enjoys reading in order to relax after a hard night of villain bashing.  Mostly lighthearted fantasy and comedic sci-fi novels, Nick prefers to stay away from serious, moody stories.  He lives that life everyday and believes that his time should be spent as far from it as possible.  His television viewing follows the same idea, mostly cartoons and sitcoms, although it’s not too rare for a learning channel to be on as well.  <br>
<br>
His cynical nature has gotten Nick in trouble all his life.  He distrusts people as a matter of principle, wary of anyone new.  Not so cold he won’t allow others in, he tends to trust instinct, warming up quick once he feels better.  Carefree and playful, he enjoys humor and has a sharp wit.  Too wary to become the life of the party in large groups, he will command the conversation in intimate situations.  Not one to panic, he commands a cool aura that would intimidate the Fonz.  Should one of his limbs ever become severed, expect him to start quoting the Black Knight.  This quality endears Julie to him, though irritates her when he refuses to take a situation serious.  <br>
<br>
Julie knows his attitude is a way to protect himself.  She has known him since she was a freshman in high school.  Only two years younger, she sees Nick as a big brother and closest friend.  Like Nick, Julie likes to be playful.  She prefers to listen to the joke rather then tell it.  Sometimes, she would rather have a serious discussion.  Her wisecracking opposition to debates rarely dissuades her.  Nick will always take the opposite position in any discussion.  His ability to point out over sights in common thought intrigues her even when they aren’t completely relevant.  <br>
<br>
Sweet emanates from her like a fluffy pink cloud.  Her smile melts hearts from across the room.  With a cock of her head and sly grin, hair falling across her face, she can make the coldest of souls flutter.  She will carefully bandage the slightest of wounds with gentleness.  Had she become a nurse no man would ever suffer.  She sleeps with a stuffed fox, a carnival prize won by Nick.  <br>
<br>
To look at her one could not imagine her ever having been hurt.  She has known pain quite well.  Her father, a highway patrolman, was shot dead when she was sixteen.  Her mother became an alcoholic before dieing just after graduation.  Her trusting nature has led her into many destructive relationships.  She has sworn to remain single.<br>
<br>
Golden hair, cut shoulder length, falls over piercing blue eyes.  Short and slim, she appears more delicate than a china doll.  Most often dressed casually seductive, her favorite clothing includes a tight belly shirt with sleeves, pleated skirt, about thirty different pairs of shoes and boots, stockings or knee socks, blue panties, thong cut, and eloquent gothic style dresses should she ever go fancy in deep reds and black.  Her nails are kept shaped meticulously and always painted.  On the small of her back a succubae blows a kiss, wings tucked in tight.  She often wears multiple rings, designs such as snakes devouring their tails, mystic symbols, and Celtic influenced.   <br>
<br>
Clutched in her hands, her nose taking in the aroma, Julie usually grasps a cup of coffee.  A cigarette replacement, she obsesses over java to the dismay of Nick who can’t touch the stuff.  After every cup, she must replace her lipstick, red or black.  <br>
<br>
Julie moved to the city as a child.  Her father moved the family there from San Diego.  Her mother found work with the Superhero Agency as a caseworker as soon as Julie entered junior high.  Her mother worked long hours, coming home tired but smiling.  Father would often come home long after Julie had gone to bed.  Each night he would tip toe into her room to give her a kiss goodnight, sometimes leaving a present in her arms to find in the morning.  Julie would lay awake until he came home, unable to sleep till she knew he was safe.  She never let him knew that she waited up.  <br>
<br>
After her mother’s death, Julie could not afford to go to college.  She bounced around from job to job until she was hired by the Superhero Agency.  Her new boss knew her mom well and felt sorry for her.  Julie works there to this day.  Well respected, all the superheroes adore her.  Without a doubt, if she ever screamed in alarm every superhero in the city would run to her aid.  Most of her responsibility seems to be getting Nick jobs.  She chastises him for getting fired so often, but is secretly amused at his antics.  <br>
<br>
She tries to get him to quit the life and land a safe job.  When he left the force, she was happy until she found out his plans.  Julie keeps a careful eye on all her clients, secretly pulling strings to keep Nick safe, the problem being that the good, safe superheroes kept their sidekicks for years.  When she sees that Rob needs a new assistant, she nearly screams in joy.<br>
<br>
Julie’s records are not needed for her to know what kind of class act Rob is.  Strongarm is famous in two other cities as well as this one.  He has turned down several offers to join the CIA squadron of elite superheroes.  Sick of the military life, Julie ponders.  Raised by an army Colonel, son of a marine himself, military life was all he knew as a child.  A product of war stories, constantly moving around, and strict discipline, Rob is perfect to become a soldier himself.  Bootcamp was quick for Rob, the war had broken out and they needed men.  Rob enlisted right away and rose in rank steadily.  Pulled from the front lines, retrained to become an elite soldier, Rob battles behind enemy lines.  Pivotal to the victory and awarded several medals, Rob returns home saddened.  With no more war, he has no purpose.  He becomes a superhero to regain that meaning.  <br>
<br>
Within a year, Rob makes headlines, dubbed Strongarm by the media.  With his naming, he raises rank and becomes a professional.  Six years later, he moves to the city.  He makes several more headlines here.  <br>
<br>
Julie pulls an old newspaper clip from the files.  A picture of Rob on the cover.  She smiles at it appreciatively.  Rob looks gritty, hard edged.  His eyes almost blaze as he snarls, a Winnebago held overhead.  Muscles in his thick neck, shoulders, and arms strain as his legs buckle slightly.  He wears combat trousers, black.  Over a massive chest he dons a flack jacket and brown athletic T.  His hair remains in a crew cut from his army days.  Hanging from his hip, a baton swings, almost as if it wants a piece of the action.  Looking at the picture, Julie can almost see ‘The Adventures of Strongarm’ written across the top.  <br>
<br>
Another clip, this time a public appearance.  Rob accepts an award from the mayor.  Dressed in a classy three piece suit, looks at the camera.  He does not smile.  Dark glasses hide his eyes, but not the small scar on his eyebrow.  Julie laughs as she notices he is wearing combat boots.  That baton of his hangs from his waist, tucked up high, only barely poking out from under his jacket.  <br>
<br>
She finds an article on Rob.  It is an interview.  He talks about life as a superhero.  He expresses his dismay over the current trend of superheroes that exists.  He insists that most are buffoons begging for a bullet in the back.  He appreciates and understands the desire to don a flashy uniform and outlandish identities in order to grain the attention of the media and raise public approval.  However, he explains, the villains in this world have no qualms about fighting dirty.  Letting them know you are a potential threat will get you killed.  He also explains how superheroes are getting younger.  They do not have the experience yet.  He believes that they will learn once they get their first battle scar.  The reporter describes a seep scar across Rob’s forearm.  Rob explains he got it his first year when he did not check if a villain was faking being unconscious before rushing to the hostage.  The villain cut him with a katana.  Rob criticizes excessive force and praises the move to make bounties only payable for live captures for most villains.  To end, he explains that sidekicks are partners and not lackeys to be tossed into as a human shield.  <br>
<br>
Julie places the file back into the cabinet.  As soon as Nick gets himself fired again, she will push Rob to hire him on.  She smiles and wanders over to the coffee maker.  <br>
