Claw of Nagafen.<br>
<br>
Please take a minute (or 30) to read our <a href="http://www.clawofnagafen.com/charter.asp" target="_new">charter</a>.  Our guild history is an interesting read which can be found <a href="http://www.clawofnagafen.com/whatistheclaw.asp" target="_new">here</a>.  It would also be wise to visit our web site <a href="http://www.clawofnagafen.com" target="_new">news page</a> to see what is going on in the guild.  *waits*  If you've done that and are still interested than keep reading.<br>
<br>
<b>What CoN is:</b><br>
We are a family oriented casual raiding guild.  If you want to raid every single time you log on, this probably isn’t the place for you.  We usually have 2-4 nights where we raid on a large scale per week.  We are a guild that understands real life obligations/family and that not everyone can live on EQ.  We are a place where you can still advance in Luclin and PoP while continuing to advance your character.  We are a guild where you will get to see the end game, we just do it at a slightly slower pace than everyone else.<br>
<br>
We are currently focused on keying for VT and Emperor as well as slowly flagging for Sol Ro and the Elementals.<br>
<br>
<b>What CoN is not:</b><br>
We are not a guild that is interested in gearing you for the uber guilds.  We are not a guild that is interested in gearing your alts.  We are not here to guild your recently ebayed 65 monk.  We are not interested in entertaining your application if you have applied to every other guild on Bristlebane.  We are not currently raiding heavily in Velious or ToV.  We are not a guild that will KS, train, or do any of those things that gets attention on the Smutboard in the name of “friendly competition.”<br>
<br>
<b>How we deal with loot:</b><br>
Loot is awarded based on need, participation, and history.  The more you put into the guild, naturally, the more you will get out of it.  Loot will come to everyone in time so sometimes you just have to be patient.<br>
<br>
<b>How to apply:</b><br>
<br>
1.  You need to create a global EZBoard account and post your application with that account.  Make a post in this section and include your character's name, class, and level.  Please place this information in the title of the post.  It should look exactly like:<br>
<br>
     APPLICATION – Samriti – 65 Enchanter<br>
<br>
2.  Please detail why you are applying and what you are looking for in a guild.  Include relevant information like who you know here (your connection to the guild if you have one), your previous guilds, how many AA you have and what you have spent them on, what flags you have in PoP, what keys you have, and a Magelo profile link.  If you do not have a Magelo, then make one and include AA and flags as well.<br>
<br>
3.  The minimum level for an invite is level 62.  You may apply before level 62 with permission from the class officer, but you must be level 62 before an invite can be extended.  Characters below this level range will find it extremely difficult to contribute to most guild experience groups or raids.<br>
<br>
4.  PoV/PoS/BoT real flags are required for admittance.  If you do not posses these flags it might be a good thing to try to do with CoN members during your application period.  You are also required to have 1 insta-click item that works indoors.<br>
<br>
5.  The minimum time for completion of an application is 1 month.  During this time you should be trying very hard to meet the guild and its members as well as participating with us on our raids.  If your post in this forum goes untouched for 30 days it will be marked inactive, moved to archives, and you will have to start the application process over again.<br>
<br>
6.  You will need to get a minimum of 5 vouches from CoN members.  These are not an easy thing to get so be patient.  You will also need to attend a minimum of 5 guild raids during your application period.  Vouches will be placed on your thread in this forum and must be painfully obvious that they are a vouch.  <br>
<br>
7.  After you have received your 5 vouches and been an applicant for at least a month you may seek out your class officer for the final testing.  These are not all the same and differ from officer to officer and are not an immediate thing.  5 vouches does not mean you are in.  If you have trouble finding your class officer online please try e-mail.  If that doesn’t work please speak to any officer to see if arrangements can be made for your testing.<br>
<br>
<b>What we are looking for:</b><br>
Below is a list of class requirements and the information should be self explanatory.  As it has always been in CoN, real life friends and family are not necessarily held to the below requirements.<br>
