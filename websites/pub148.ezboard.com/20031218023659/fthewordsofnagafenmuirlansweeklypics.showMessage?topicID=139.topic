She had tricked me into it.  A trick that I had fallen willingly into.  We were sitting at the cliffs overlooking the sea of Firiona   A soft breeze was blowing in from the sea and the setting sun turned her hair into fiery strands of gold.  We had met as we often did in those days, after our hunts to spend our evenings and nights together.  We sat on the cliffs.  She leaning against me and I, with my arms around her as we watched the sun set into the sea.  I can almost feel the stress draining out of my veins now, as it did then.  Whenever we were together, I was at peace and the cares of the world fell away.  We talked of our days, our goals, our quests.  That day, she had saved a graze on her hand for me to heal.  She teased me often then, that “boo-boos” had to be kissed better.  I healed her hand when she showed it to me, then I had kissed it.  After I had done that, she told me she had another “ouchie.”  I examined her other hand and kissed that, but she told me laughingly it was not there.  When I asked her where her hurt was, she tapped her lips.  Then she closed her eyes, puckered up and leaned toward me.<br>
<br>
I remember the blood rushing to my head.  The thudding of my heart as I leaned over and covered her lips with my own.  They were soft, warm and trembled as I’m sure mine must have.  I had the courage only to place the merest touch of my lips to hers before I drew back.  But she had opened her eyes to stare into mine and she breathed a single word… “More.” And I was lost.<br>
<br>
I closed my eyes, as the memories exploded vividly in my mind and my heart.  I had pulled her into my arms then, and we kissed.  Exploring and tasting until we both shook with desire.  Then I held her until both our hearts were calm again, and wrapping her close to me in my cloak, we were content to lay down and sleep.<br>

<br>
The simple question broke the high priest from his reverie.  He blinked in the hot sun and gazed at his daughter who stood in front of him, hot and sweaty from practice in the arena.  He blinked again and then smiled at the pretty half-elf standing in front of him.<br>
<br>
“I was just thinking how alike your mother you are.”<br>
<br>
Delaine laughed out loud.  “Oh, father!  Like mother?  Look at me!  I am a warrior!  I’m all dirty and hot and sweaty.  Can you ever imagine mother lifting a sword?  Much less get hot and sweaty?”<br>
<br>
Emmedain’s wayward thoughts led him to think of the times that Arawayne was hot and sweaty.  He was thinking much too much of her these days.  Ever since he had discovered that he had a daughter.  With practiced discipline, he put his thoughts of the past away and forced himself into the present.  He chuckled, joining in his daughter’s laugher.<br>
<br>
“Well, in her youth, your mother was known to wield a staff now and again, with grace and ferocity.  Many a time it was at me, however, when she was threatening me…”<br>
<br>
Delaine laughed again, and then thrust out her hand at her father.  “Help me father, I have a boo-boo.”<br>
<br>
The flashback was intense this time.  “Arawyne…”<br>
<br>
“Father?”<br>
<br>
Emmedain visibly shook himself as he took his daughter’s hand.  He came when he could nowadays, when the young warriors trained in the arena, to offer his aid in healing accidental hurts and cuts.  Her sparing opponent had gotten through her guard and slashed the back of her forearm.  He frowned as he examined it.  It was an ugly gash, but not deep.  Murmuring a spell of cleansing, then one of healing, he nodded with satisfaction as the flesh knitted.<br>
<br>
Delaine chuckled as the potent magics flowed over her flesh.  The healing spell her father had cast was one that healed both flesh and soul.  “Thank you, father, but a minor healing would have been enough.”<br>
<br>
Emmedain smiled and patted his daughter’s hand.  “Your mother said that to me once, but like I told her then, and I’ll tell you now.  I like to see you whole and it takes little from me to use a superior heal.  You do look like your mother, you know.”<br>
<br>
Delaine made a face.  “She’s beautiful.  All elfin grace and charm, and that beautiful white blonde hair…”<br>
<br>
Emmedain grinned and interrupted his daughter.  “I do know how your mother looks, and you have the look of her about you.  Your smile, the way you toss your head… and hey… don’t you like the strawberry blonde hair you got because of me?”<br>
<br>
Delaine made another face and grabbed her short hair in her hands.  “It’s carrot!  You have this dark red hair that I would die for… mother has this gorgeous blonde, and I get carrot!”<br>
<br>
Emmedain laughed now.  “Enough.  Your head would get too large for your helm if I always praised you.”<br>
<br>
“But..”<br>
<br>
“Look at me, Lainie…”  Emmedain commanded sternly.  “You are a beautiful young woman.  You are different than the high-elf that your mother is, you are different than the human that I am.  Indeed you have the best of both worlds.  Now stop thinking about your looks and concentrate on your sword work or you will never attain the sword circle you wish.”<br>
<br>
Delaine cocked her head at her father then smiled.  The mischievous little smile that Emmedain recognized.  It was the smile that Arawyne would give him, just before she suggested something outrageous or dangerous.  He was on his guard before his daughter even asked.<br>
<br>
“Well, would you hunt goblins with me?  A few more goblin war beads as trophies would not be amiss to the Temple of Life, and I am close to finishing my second tier trials.”<br>
<br>
Emmedain considered his daughter’s request and her eager face.  She was indeed close.  Well, a little help now would not be amiss.  He would help her attain her second tier rank.  “Very well.  I do have the time today, after all.”<br>
<br>
“Yay!”<br>
<br>
Delaine cheered and danced off to store her practice weapons at her foster parents’ house and don her hunting gear.  Emmedain watched her run off indulgently and examined his pouches.  As usual, they were full of reagents for his spells, but none for the minor spells he would use for his daughter this day.  Well, he would purchase a few pieces of Amber and provide a minor magical shield.  From experience, he knew that a greater shield made her cocky and careless.<br>

<br>
“Well, she has no healing spells to protect me with, so she gave me the best armor she could buy.”<br>
<br>
Luckily, she didn’t, thought Emmedain as they rode from the city toward the goblin mines at the foothills of the Karana Pass.  Delaine was dressed in a full suit of crafted plate armor, Elven craftsmenship for sure, but not the finest, nor was it a suit of dragon mail.  Still, it was better than any that a second or even third tier warrior could afford.  Delaine needed to hone her skills, not depend on armor to protect her.<br>
<br>
“And the horse?”<br>
<br>
Delaine coughed and blushed.  “Well, I pay for his stabling and keep…”<br>
<br>
Emmedain snorted.  “She gifted you with an elfin steed, daughter.  Don’t try to hoodwink me, Lainie.  Elfin horses need no food and keep.  You summon them when you require their aid and dismiss them when you are done.”<br>
<br>
“Well… actually… grandmother did.  With Silvermist, I can actually ride the feyways to Felwithe and visit.  Ma crafted the saddle and Da did the metalwork of course.  Mine was the first saddle Ma did and she liked them well enough that she has started to sell them.”<br>
<br>
Delaine chattered on as they reached the forest of Mervamel, where perforce, they had to ride in single file and silence and attention to their surroundings would serve them better.  The verdant forest began to change as they neared the goblin mines.  The trees and bushes were stunted and deformed from the poisoning of the land caused by the dregs of goblin mining.  Emmedain had made his daughter lead and now she chose a small clearing where they would stage.  He prepared a spell of protection.  <br>
<br>
Delaine grinned as she felt her father’s magics flow over her.  This would be a piece of cake.  She dismounted and removing her packs and saddle from his back, bade her steed return to his lands.<br>
<br>
Emmedain frowned as his daughter prepared herself.  “No shield?”<br>
<br>
“No.  I can deal more damage with two-sword, and besides… I need the two-sword practice.”<br>
<br>
“That’s what the arena is for.”<br>
<br>
“Not the same.”<br>
<br>
Emmedain was forced to agree.  <br>
<br>
“Will you pull for me?”<br>
<br>
Emmedain raised an eyebrow.  He patted the saddlebag on his horse and withdrew a book.<br>
<br>
“I am here to help you.  Not feed you like a baby.”<br>
<br>
Delaine stuck her tongue out at her father mischievously then placed her helm on her head, fastening it securely.  Unwrapping her bow, she strung it carefully and nocked an arrow on it.<br>
<br>
“Your mother?”  The comment was dry.<br>
<br>
Delaine grinned.  “Uncle Tarube made it.”<br>
<br>
“Uncle?”<br>
<br>
“He is now!”  was the enthusiastic response.<br>
<br>
Emmedian reached out a hand silently and Delaine removed the arrow and handed her bow to her father. Delaine was picking up an extended family of adoptive aunts and uncles, it seemed.  There were few children among his set.  Since his friends had realized that she was his daughter, she often found herself the recipient of their hand-me-downs.  Thank Marr that most were too powerful for her to wield and sat in the safety of the Freeport bank’s stronghold.<br>
<br>
“He saw me at archery practice when he last passed through Freeport.  I was still using a short bow so he gave me this one.”<br>
<br>
Emmedain ran his hands over the bow.  Beautiful craftsmanship as could be expected from a Master Bowyer.  It gleamed with a magic aura.  Indeed.  It was his best of easily acquired mundane materials.  <br>
<br>
“The arrows?”<br>
<br>
“Oh!  I made them myself!”<br>
<br>
She handed them to him proudly.  Emmedain examined her handiwork.  The arrows were well made if still a little crude.  “Very well.  Don’t bring back the entire goblin horde.  I don’t feel like doing a resurrection today.”<br>
<br>
Delaine laughed, but nodded and moved carefully toward the mouth of the goblin mines.  Ahhh… good.  It was lightly guarded as usual.  The goblins were more interested in mining the land than protecting their own.  She often wondered if there were goblin mothers who worried about their children.  Delaine watched and gauged the distance.  Goblin miners moved in and out of the mines.  Two guards stood watch at the entrance, and one patrolled the perimeter.  Oh!  Her heart leapt.  A goblin guard captain!  She could tell by the colorful war beads it wore.  The war beads off the guard captain were worth more in prestige and points towards her competence trials than ordinary war beads.  She would never attempt a goblin guard captain alone.  It would be certain death.   With a hunting party of her level and status, maybe… but with her father…<br>
<br>
She drew the bow.  The captain walked closer to her then paused.  If she did this right, he would come charging over without alerting the other guards.  The goblins were stupid that way.  When angered or hurt, they had no thought but to hurt in return.<br>
<br>
She loosed the arrow.  Yes!  It flew true, piercing the goblin’s hard hide.  It howled in pain and looked around.  Deliberately, she stood and rustled the bushes.  The goblin squealed in rage and charged.  She grinned.  The other guards had merely looked up in the guard captain’s direction and had slumped back down in boredom.  Turning tail, she ran back to the clearing where her father would be reading his book.  Slinging the bow across her body as she ran, she unsheathed her swords in readiness.<br>
<br>
“Uhh…”  The blow of magic struck her hard.  It felt like a hundred flaming knives in her.  Then she felt the warm glow of a healing spell and grinned.  Spinning to face the enraged goblin, she yelled to her father.  “Magic protection, father, please!  Spell caster!”<br>
<br>
Emmedain gauged the strength of the prey his daughter had selected and cast a spell of magic protection on her.  He nodded.  He had known it.  She was too cocksure with him along for protection.  The minor spells he had chosen to shield her with would offer her some protection but not make her invulnerable to hurt.  However, his healing magic would close what wounds she took.<br>
<br>
This would be a long and savage fight Delaine realized.  The goblin’s hide was tough and his magics were strong.  Another blow of magic struck her and she gasped at the pain.<br>
<br>
“Bash, Lae, interrupt his magic.”<br>
<br>
Delaine gritted her teeth and wondered if that was what provoked her mother’s temper often.  He damn well knew she had not brought a shield.  Yes, she should have.  She would have switched it out with her off hand sword.  The goblin caught her a good blow and she gasped at the pain.  Damn… what protective shields had her father granted her?  Definitely not his best.  She felt the healing spell fade then strengthen.  He was renewing the healing spell.  At least she would not be seriously injured today or worse… die and have to suffer resurrection and the long recovery from that!<br>
<br>
“Dodge, Lae.  Parry.  Got to keep those skills up.”<br>
<br>
Delaine doubled her efforts.  Ha!  Piece of cake… father was making her work!  She swore as the goblin readied another spell.  She had to strike him hard enough to interrupt it and that was where the shield came in.  She could use the weight of her body, not just the strength of her arm to bash her opponent with.  The explosion of magic at close range made her ears ring, but she was not hurt.  Instead, the goblin stood motionless.  She paused.  Her father had stunned it.<br>
<br>
“I have a shield you could borrow.”<br>
<br>
Delaine turned at her father’s mild words.  He stood there, holding out a shield emblazoned with a sinuous gold dragon.<br>
<br>
“Wow!”  She marveled at the shield her father was holding out to her.  That was a shield given by the dragons only to those they deemed worthy!  She quickly loosed the sword from her off hand and took it from him, sliding her arm into the holding straps.<br>
<br>
“I want it back.”<br>
<br>
“Awww… father…”<br>
<br>
“Goblin’s waking up.”<br>
<br>
There was no more time for talk.  Delaine spun and bashed her prey hard.  It stunned him and interrupted his spell.  She hooted with glee and swung her sword with renewed vigor.<br>
<br>
Emmedain shook his head.  The warrior’s way was definitely for her.  Who would have thought that he and Arawyne could have spawned such a blood-thirsty little daughter.  Goblin guards were stupid and chosen only for their ability to fight and maim.  They did not run but fought to the death.  He renewed the powerful healing spell on his daughter, then turned back to his book.  The spell would take care of any hurts she received.<br>
<br>
In the despoiled forest, no birds sang.  Not even the raven, which often was a harbinger of evil.  Emmedain looked up from his book thoughtfully.  He leaned back against a tree and watched his daughter fight.  One could hear the chittering of a squirrel or bark of a fox sometimes but even the animals kept away.  It was quiet now, but for the thud of steel against goblin hide, the explosion of offensive magic, and the cries of the combatants; the goblin’s squeals of rage and a grunt now and again from Delaine.  She had been successful in thwarting most of the goblin’s magical attacks.  The goblin had lost the use of one arm and noxious ochres were oozing from multiple wounds.  It would not be long now and none too soon.  He had renewed the spell of healing three times, and he could see that Delaine was tiring.<br>

<br>
Delaine saw the opening and thrust her sword hard.  Yes!  It pierced the hide weakened by the many cuts she had inflicted on it and sank into the goblins chest.  With a final gurgle of frustrated rage, it slowly toppled over and lay still.  Delaine sank to a knee beside the corpse, panting.  Thank the Goddess of Love!  It was dead.  She could feel the shield of magic protection fading and the healing spell close the last of her wounds and itself fade.<br>
<br>
“Well done, daughter.”<br>
<br>
Delaine looked up and made a face at her father.  He could have given her a little more help.<br>
<br>
“Want a zing?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, please.”  She gasped the words.  “Oh yes…  please, father.  Before I fall over.”<br>
<br>
Emmedain grinned and granted his daughter her strength and stamina back.  Delaine let herself collapse flat on her back as she let the magic “zing” through her veins, replenishing her energy and stamina.<br>
<br>
“Oh bliss!”<br>
<br>
The high priest chuckled and opened his saddlebags again.<br>
<br>
“Sit up, Lainie.  Here.”<br>
<br>
Delaine sat up as bade, and drunk lustily from the water skin her father handed her.<br>
<br>
“Oh… Mmmm!  Yum!  Pardina’s Greater Constitutional.”<br>
<br>
Emmedain nodded.  “Grants you energy and strength.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.”<br>
<br>
It was also too expensive a drink for her to afford with any sort of regularity.  Delaine rolled onto her knees and taking her dagger cut the war beads from the goblin’s neck.  The corpse was beginning to smolder.  <br>
<br>
“Urgh!”<br>
<br>
“It will immolate.  It was a fire mage.”<br>
<br>
“Wow.”<br>
<br>
Delaine stared as the corpse burned until nothing was left but ashes and a stink in the air.<br>
<br>
“Maybe I should pull more of these.”  She grinned at her father.  “No corpses to bury.”<br>
<br>
Emmedain rolled his eyes.  “Why don’t you pull something a little easier?  As I recall, miners as well as guards wear war beads.  Won’t two sets of goblin war beads be equal to one of the goblin captain’s beads?  Only the captains are spell casters.  It will also go faster.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, father.”<br>
<br>
Emmedain looked at his daughter suspiciously.   Her eyes were bright with excitement as she looked forward to the next kill.  He had two choices here.  Given his daughter’s knowledge that he would not let her die, she would probably pick the hardest prey she could, if only for the challenge.  Given his promise to help her attain the last sets of beads she needed to finish her second tier trials, he could either draw for her or resign himself to spending the rest of the afternoon waiting as she finished off each goblin.  He sighed and put away his book.  Removing his mace from his belt he held out his other hand for his shield.<br>
<br>
“I’ll pull.”<br>
