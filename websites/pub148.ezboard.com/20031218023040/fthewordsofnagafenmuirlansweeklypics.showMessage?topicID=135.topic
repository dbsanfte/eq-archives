class=title>   The birth of a Druid (first draft)</span><hr size=1> I grew up in a quaint little hollow on the edge of Misty Thicket.  There I grew helping my father gather the fruits and berries he needed for the family business.  The Dalcohol family was well known in Rivervale for its wines and beers.  By age 7, I could pick out those berries that would make the finest wines.  So my life wen happily learning the family trade, hoping one day to be the best brewmaster in all Rivervale.  Unfortunately all this chanced on my 16th birthday.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The day started like any other day.  I went out and collected the freshly ripened berries in the family berry patch, ready to start the days brewing.  When I returned home dad said he had an errand for me to run.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Son, I want you to run into town and buy some Jumjum's from Rebo.  When you return I will teach you the secret family recipe for jumjum beer.  A recipe that has been passed down from father to son since the first Dalcohols arrived here with Reno Leatherfoot.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I happily ran into Rivervale that morning. To finally be trusted with the ancient family recipe of Jumjum beer meant that dad believed I was well on the way to becoming a master brewer like himself.  As I ran through the tunnel that separated Misty thicket from Rivervale, I accidentally ran into Kyra Leafshifter.  Once, Kyra was my childhood sweetheart, now days she hated my guts.  All because I refused her offer to join her little gang of cutthroats and hooligans.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ah, Zyphin! Running to fetch daddies things like a good lap dog I see!&quot; she said as she dusted off her pants. &quot;One day, very soon, you will regret turning down my offer.&quot; She then turned and walked out the tunnel into the thicket, waving at a few of her &quot;friends&quot;.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paying little heed to Kyra, I continued on into Rivervale.  Mayor Grubbins was out and about greeting everyone as he walked to the townhall.  The Town hall was actually a castle built by Reno Leatherfoot and was now the townhall, bank, and barracks for the town militia, &quot;The guardians of the Vale&quot;.  I always looked at the castle in awe and wondered what it must have been like in the days when the castle was being built.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As I continues on, I passed &quot;Fools Gold&quot;, a seedy bar in the center of town, but a chief purchaser of the family wares.  Off in the corner of the wale was the Leafway farm, my destination.  The Leafway's and their followers were a strange lot.  Most people shyed away from the farm unless they needed jumjums, the leafway farm being the only place in Rivervale the tasty tuber grew.  Rebo Leafway, the current head of the family, was out in the fields this morning as I approached.  Rebo was harvesting a new batch of jumjums as he talked to the animated scarecrow, Shakey, which guarded the field.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh, you keep the birds away fine! But why can you not keep that pest Nillipus out of my fields?&quot; ranted the farmer as he collected more jumjum stalks. &quot;Look! See here! More of his footprints!&quot;  The scarecrow looked on saying nothing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nillipus is a brownie that wandered into the vale when I as a small child. As a child, I would chase him around town playing games of hide and seek.  Unfortunately for Rebo, Nillipus had found the delightful taste of jumjums and was raiding the fields once a day since.<br>
Catching sight of me, Rebo turned to say, &quot;Ah young Zyphin, have you come to help me catch that rascal Nillipus and teach him a lesson?&quot;<br>
&quot;Actually Sir, I have come to purchase some jumjum stalks for my father.  Today we are making jumjum beer.&quot;<br>
&quot;Jumjum beer huh? How many will you be needing?&quot;<br>
&quot;Twenty stalks sir.&quot;<br>
&quot;Twenty? Hmm…..Ok follow me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I followed him around the corner of his farmhouse to a little shed.  There he stopped and mumbled some strange words before opening the door. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Was that magic?&quot; I said with excitement.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Depends.   What did you see?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I described for him the faint glow I saw on the latch briefly before he opened the door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hmm..' he said as he insected me from top to bottom. &quot;Touched by Karana you are.&quot; And turned back to the shed. &quot;That will be two gold and four silver.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I paid him the money and started making my way back home.  Rebo waved and walked back to his field as Nillipus ran in and grabbed another jumjum stalk. &quot;Nillipus! Get out! Shakey get him!&quot;   Wondering all the time what he meant by touched by Karana.  I knew Karana was the god of the storm, but why would Karana want to &quot;touch&quot; me?  Did he mean that I was &quot;touched in the head&quot; or crazy? I was still pondering this when I arrived home.<br>
