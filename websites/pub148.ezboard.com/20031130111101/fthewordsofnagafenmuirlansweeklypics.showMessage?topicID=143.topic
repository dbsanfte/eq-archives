class=title>   Reconciliation - ?</span><hr size=1> Fireflies danced, blinking in and out over the grass in the warm summer night.  Beyond the high stonewall that surrounded the small courtyard, the distinctive tramp of studded boots signaled the patrol of the night watch.  It was an unusually quiet evening in East Freeport, and the hushed surf of the distant sea could be heard.  <br>
<br>
The tang of the salt air was pleasant and it brought to Dalain’s mind other times.  Past instances where he sat by the sea.  Memories of long ago when he would sit by the sea with his love.  He had confessed his feelings for her in the spray of the salt sea.  He was such a fumbling young fool in love then.  Inexperienced in the ways of love in spite of his advanced years…  Ay… he was feeling his age this night.  He was glad it was summer.  The damp sea air in winter sometimes reminded his body of every major battle and hurts received even though they had been long healed.  Here he was… a grown daughter at his feet...  a love long lost… Elves were so long-lived, they seemed immortal to humans.  He wondered how Arawyne looked.  Probably as fresh and beautiful as the day they met…  <br>
<br>
He was lost in his memories when his daughter spoke, asking a question.<br>
<br>
~~<br>
<br>
Delaine was lying on the grass beside the rough-hewn bench in her foster-parents’ yard, gazing up at the stars.  Her Da was having a well-deserved drink at the local pub, and her Ma was inside the house doing something.  Her birth-father sat on the bench, seemingly lost in thought.  She wondered what he was thinking about.  She had easily grown to respect and love him, and she was glad that her Da and Ma took to him and he to they.  He often came to dinner with them when he was in town, enjoying their simple repasts, praising her Ma on her cooking, always bringing a bottle of wine or some sweet.  She had not known until he showed her his jeweler’s mark on her own diamond band, that her mother had given her, that he was a jeweler.  <br>
<br>
Her birth-father was an interesting and accomplished man.  She wondered again what he had done.  The act that her birth-mother had called “stupid” that had provoked her so she struck out in return and broke them up so irrevocably.  Her mother had never offered the information and she had never dared ask.  But her father… that was a different matter.  So she asked.<br>
<br>
“Father?”<br>
<br>
Pulled out of his reverie, Dalain turned.<br>
<br>
“Yes, Delaine?”<br>
<br>
“Whatcha do that made mother so mad that she made you duel her?”<br>
<br>
Dalain thought a while before answering and looked at his daughter.  Delaine looked back at him steadfastly, her eyes bright and questioning.<br>
<br>
It was all ancient history.  Dalain thought, and there was little need to go into the old hurts and fears, but perhaps she deserved an answer of some sort.  Distilling all the past into the deed, he replied.<br>
<br>
“I was giving her up.”<br>
<br>
“Why were you giving her up?”<br>
<br>
“Because I thought she deserved better.”<br>
<br>
Delaine looked back up at the starry night.<br>
<br>
“Mother was right… That was stupid.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you.”<br>
<br>
Dalain smiled wryly.<br>
<br>
“You’re welcome.”<br>
<br>
Silence reigned between them.  Delaine was thinking hard.  She wondered if she had offended her father.  Da did always say she had too big a mouth sometimes and needed to start her brain before she started her mouth.<br>
<br>
She pondered how she was going to ask the next question.  Ahhh…<br>
<br>
“That was stupid, father, because… how could mother have done better than you?”<br>
<br>
Dalain smiled, recognizing his daughter’s attempt at diplomacy.<br>
<br>
“Sometimes people in love do silly things.  I thought that I was doing the best by her.”<br>
<br>
“Mmmmph…”<br>
<br>
Delaine was sitting up now, hugging her knees and Dalain reached over and ruffled her hair.<br>
<br>
“Maybe one day you will fall in love and understand a little.  It was not quite that simple, Lainie.  Many things were involved, but basically, I loved your mother, but saw her little and could not give her the attention she deserved.  So I thought I was doing the right thing.”<br>
<br>
“Mmmmph…” <br>
<br>
Delaine grunted, and then was silent for a space of time before she spoke again.<br>
<br>
“You think you’d ever get together again?”<br>
<br>
Dalain sighed.  So that was what it was about.<br>
<br>
“No.”<br>
<br>
“Why not?”<br>
<br>
Dalain shrugged.<br>
<br>
“She doesn’t love me anymore.  She didn’t even tell me that she had you... that we had you.”<br>
<br>
Delaine was thinking hard.  That was what mother had said too.  That father did not love her anymore…<br>
<br>
“Do you love her still?”<br>
<br>
Dalain raised an expressive eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“What’s this, Lainie?  Twenty questions?  This was all a long time ago.”<br>
<br>
“Mmmmmph…”<br>
<br>
“And what is that supposed to mean, young lady?”<br>
<br>
“Just thinking, Father.”<br>
<br>
“About?”<br>
<br>
Delaine rose to her feet and hugged her birth father tight.<br>
<br>
“You and mother, and Gramma, and Da and Ma… and how lucky I am to have all of you.”<br>
<br>
Dalain smiled and hugged his daughter back.<br>
<br>
“I’m lucky too.  Lucky to have you, lucky that you found me.”<br>

Very nervous.  What if this turned out to be a fiasco?  She had confided in her grandmother what she had planned, and had asked her advice, but Cassandra had not been very forthcoming, although she approved.<br>
<br>
“Stop pacing, dear.”<br>
<br>
Cassandra murmured as Delaine passed her chair again.<br>
<br>
“Yes, Gramma.”<br>
<br>
Delaine continued pacing.  Cassandra clucked her tongue.<br>
<br>
“Sit.”<br>
<br>
Delaine pulled out a chair and sat, drumming her fingers on the table.<br>
<br>
Arawyne frowned at her daughter.<br>
<br>
“What is the matter, Delaine?”<br>
<br>
She jumped up again, but was saved from having to answering by her grandmother.<br>
<br>
“I am having a visitor, Arawyne.  Delaine is a little excited, I think.”<br>
<br>
“Oh?”<br>
<br>
Arawyne raised an eyebrow.  She did not like her mother’s expression.  She looked like the cat that had found sweet cream unattended.  In fact… her mother had the same expression when she was presenting marriage minded candidates to her years ago.  Scheming little wench!<br>
<br>
Cassandra nodded.<br>
<br>
“Aye.  Perhaps I should say that Delaine and I are having a visitor to tea.”<br>
<br>
Arawyne frowned.<br>
<br>
“Anyone I know?”<br>
<br>
Cassandra nodded again.<br>
<br>
Arawyne glared at her mother.  Cassandra was playing games.  But over the years, she had learned to either play or gracefully allow her mother her schemes, and it took much less energy to simply allow her mother her schemes.<br>
<br>
“Well you should have told me.  I would have baked more muffins or perhaps cake.”<br>
<br>
Cassandra smiled.<br>
<br>
“There is plenty of that.  But perhaps a little more tea?  I hear the kettle.  Use the larger tea pot.”<br>
<br>
“I’ll do it, Gramma.”<br>
<br>
Delaine volunteered, and escaped into the kitchen.<br>
<br>
~~~~<br>
<br>
Dalain walked through Felwithe, following the instructions his daughter had given him.  He made a wide berth around the paladin’s guild.  He was not sure of his welcome there since that little incident where his guild had trampled some rose bushes in Tunare’s garden, but did not want trouble.<br>
<br>
He was a little nervous and wondered again how he had let his daughter talk him into this.  How did one act when meeting one’s daughter’s grandmother?  What would he say to her?<br>
<br>
“Hi there.  Yeah.  I’m the one that knocked up your daughter.  But I didn’t know.  Really!”<br>
<br>
He grinned.  He was being foolish now.  He had met Cassandra Goldenmoon once before.  At a conclave in Freeport over the threat of Lanys T’val, the daughter of Innoruuk.  She was a stately elf.  Calm and collected.  Suuuuure… he would say something like that to her.  Maybe it would rattle her.  Then again, maybe he would just look foolish.<br>
<br>
He arrived at his destination and double-checked the directions on the many-times folded parchment again.  Taking a deep breath, he knocked on the door and stood back.  Then the door opened and he forgot to breathe.<br>
<br>
~~<br>
<br>
Arawyne stood at the knocks on her mother’s door.<br>
<br>
“I’ll get it mother.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you dear.  Bring him to the parlor.  I’m sure Delaine will have tea ready.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, mother.”<br>
<br>
She opened the door and stared at their visitor, her greeting frozen in her throat.  If she had been asked, the last person she would have guessed would have would have been he that stood in front of her now.<br>
<br>
~~~<br>
<br>
Dalain stared at Arawyne, his heart constricting in him as the smile left her face.<br>
<br>
“Arawyne.”<br>
<br>
“Dalain.”<br>
<br>
They stood, wrapped in time, staring at each other until Cassandra took the door from her daughter and opened it wide.<br>
<br>
“Dalain!  Welcome!”<br>
<br>
Taking him by the arm, she ushered him past her daughter.  Dalain’s eyes stayed on Arawyne until he passed her and perforce had to turn his attention to Cassandra.  Before he could speak, Delaine came out of the kitchen with a laden tray.<br>
<br>
“Father!  You came!”<br>
<br>
Her voice was joyful yet relieved, and he smiled.<br>
<br>
“Of course I did.”<br>
<br>
Arawyne closed the front door slowly as all three entered the parlor, and contemplated making her escape.  She didn’t seem needed.  Then her mother’s head popped out from the parlor.<br>
<br>
“Tea is poured, Arawyne.  Come.”<br>
<br>
Mother’s royal command.  She thought wryly and walked slowly to the parlor.<br>
<br>

Arawyne was not sure what she ate or drank.  That Delaine was acquainted with her father was obvious.  She chatted merrily and Dalain smiled readily at her.  He really hadn’t changed much.  Some silver in his hair.  More creases around his eyes when he smiled.  She hadn’t spent so much time nor had been this close physically, to him in many years.  In the occasional dragon hunts they both had attended, he was just another face in the crowd, although one she was acutely aware of.  Now she studied him discreetly yet studiously avoided his eyes, so she was more than surprised when her mother stood up and announced that she was sure they wanted some time in private and ushered Delaine out of the room.<br>
<br>
~~~<br>
<br>
Dalain shifted uncomfortably.  The pleasant airy parlor now seemed suddenly too small.  He was much too aware of Arawyne.  She sat across from him, one hand on the table, her eyes cast down, her fingers tapping the table silently.  He cleared his throat and she looked up.  He caught her eyes for a moment before she looked away.  Unsure of what to say or what he was supposed to say, he reached over on impulse and covered her hand with his.  She jerked at the contact but did not pull away, her fingers trembling under his as he squeezed gently.<br>
<br>
“Why didn’t you tell me?”<br>
<br>
She looked up again, her eyes flashing in anger.  Tunare take it all!  That he could still affect her like this after all these years…<br>
<br>
“What would it have mattered?  You had your life, I had mine.  You had no space in yours for me.  What space would there have been for me and a child?”<br>

She could hear her father and mother’s raised voices.  On impulse, she ran to the parlor door and pressed her ear against it, then winced as she heard shattering glass.  She looked at her grandmother who was calmly measuring herbs and making notations in her ledger.<br>
<br>
“I think mother just threw something at father.”<br>
<br>
“I hope it’s that hideous vase your grandfather’s aunt gave me.”<br>
<br>
Delaine grabbed her hair and whirled around to face her grandmother.<br>
<br>
“Ahhh!  How can you be so calm?”<br>
<br>
Cassandra smiled and nodded at the stool in front of her.<br>
<br>
“Come sit down, dear.”<br>
<br>
Delaine grabbed the stool and sat, propping her elbows on the table and her head in her hands.<br>
<br>
“Maybe this was one of my stupider ideas.”<br>
<br>
Cassandra laughed.<br>
<br>
“Actually, I thought it was a marvelous idea.”<br>
<br>
Delaine blinked.<br>
<br>
“You did?”<br>
<br>
“Aye.”<br>
<br>
“Why?”<br>
<br>
“Because they still love each other.”<br>
<br>
Delaine blinked again and winced as the sound of more breaking glass reached their ears again.<br>
<br>
“She just threw something else.”<br>
<br>
“I put the good vases away this morning, dear.”<br>
<br>
“How did you know?  How do you know?”<br>
<br>
Cassandra winked at her granddaughter and crossed her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Grandmother Cassandra knows all.  Sees all.”<br>
<br>
Delaine laughed.<br>
<br>
“Oh!  The witch woman persona!  How well you do it too!”<br>
<br>
Cassandra laughed with her granddaughter.<br>
<br>
“No, Gramma.  Tell me!  How did you know?”<br>
<br>
Cassandra smiled.<br>
<br>
“That your mother would throw things?”<br>
<br>
“No, Gramma, I mean… well, that too.”<br>
<br>
She laughed.<br>
<br>
“As if you don’t know your mother’s temper by now.”<br>
<br>
“I didn’t think she would throw things!  But Gramma, I mean… how do you know they still love each other?”<br>
<br>
“The way they looked at each other when one thought the other was not looking at them.  The longing in her eyes, the hunger in his perhaps?”<br>
<br>
Cassandra’s eyes twinkled.<br>
<br>
“Oh.”<br>
<br>
Delaine digested that piece of information.<br>
<br>
“You saw all that just over tea and cake?”<br>
<br>
“You grandmother has lived a long life, child, and is a seer to boot.  I’ve learned a lot about the nature of humans and elves.”<br>
<br>
Delaine nodded.<br>
<br>
“Do you think they will make up?”<br>
<br>
Cassandra smiled and picked up her teacup again, sipping from it while Delaine watched impatiently.<br>
<br>
“Yes, child.  I think they will.”<br>
<br>
“But mother’s yelling and throwing things!”<br>
<br>
Cassandra nodded again.<br>
<br>
“That is your mother’s nature.”<br>
<br>
“But… but…”<br>
<br>
Cassandra laughed.<br>
<br>
“Trust in your father, dear.  Your father and your mother were lovers for many years.  I’m sure he remembers how to handle your mother and her temper tantrums.”<br>
<br>
She reminisced.<br>
<br>
“I was first surprised that it lasted that long, then resigned that your mother would not be marrying a high-elf and continuing our line.”<br>
<br>
Another crash reached Delaine’s ears and she winced.<br>
<br>
“Are you sure, Gramma?”<br>
<br>
Her grandmother nodded and set her to the task of returning jars of herbs to their proper places on her shelves.  The chore done, Delaine sat with her Grandmother again, shooting glances at the parlor door anxiously.  Suddenly realizing that she had not heard anything else smash for a while, Delaine jumped up from the stool and ran to the parlor once more, pressing her ear to the door.  She frowned.<br>
<br>
“I can’t hear anything now.”<br>
<br>
Cassandra smiled and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Come away dear.”<br>
<br>
“But, I can’t hear anything!”<br>
<br>
Cassandra laughed.<br>
<br>
“Aye.  If your father is smart, he is kissing her to shut her up, and that will be that.”<br>
<br>
“Oh.”<br>
<br>
She opened the door a crack and peeked in.<br>
<br>
“Delaine!”<br>
<br>
Cassandra hissed her granddaughter’s name and set the herbs down.<br>
<br>
“Come away from there!”<br>
<br>
Delaine shut the door hurriedly and scurried over to her Grandmother’s side.  Her face was red with embarrassment.<br>
<br>
“Gramma!  They are… Father is…  Uhhh… Father… they are…”<br>
<br>
It was all Cassandra could do not to laugh at her granddaughter.  Wrapping a hand around her upper arm, she hauled her out of the house.<br>
<br>
“Time for you and I to take a walk.”<br>
