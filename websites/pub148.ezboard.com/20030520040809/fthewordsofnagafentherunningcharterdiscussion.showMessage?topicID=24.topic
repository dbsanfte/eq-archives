Original Claw of Nagafen Charter</span><hr size=1> The “Original Claw of Nagafen” Charter, with a few updates.<br>
<br>
Guild Theory:<br>
<br>
The Claw of Nagafen is based on a simple idea: Most people don’t know how to group.<br>
I’m sure we’ve all been in a group where the cleric doesn’t heal, the tank just stands there, people run off and bring a death train right into a bunch of meding casters, you happen to be meding…and when you’re finished everyone has disappeared…etc…etc…etc.<br>
All we are trying to achieve here is to be known as the best groupers in EQ. Hands down. I want people to see our guild name and FLOOD us with tells. I know that I know how to group…and I know the nine officers I’ve chosen know how as well, because I’ve grouped with them. I trust my officers will make the same judgements as well when recruiting new members.<br>
<br>
Helping others:<br>
<br>
If you see someone getting killed…for god’s sake…HELP THEM…heal them or draw their attacker. (Since this is the first thing some of you may have issues with, keep in mind, it’s a suggestion not a rule).<br>
If you get a shiny new weapon, and no longer need your old one (and aren’t short on platinum), give it to a newbie..it makes us look like gods to them.<br>
If someone shouts, “OH GOD PLEASE CURE MY I’M DYING HELLLLLLP!!!” Then see if you can help out. But, if someone shouts, “DEWD!!! I’m gon to dye! If U could Hlp me pls, U would ROK!!!” let them die. (Maybe it’s a personal thing, but I really hate that, again...you make the call)<br>
If someone wants to group with you, do it. It’s free advertising, to show how well we can group. <br>
Same goes for corpse retrieval.<br>
<br>
Helping Guild members:<br>
<br>
No brainer here…help ‘em!! But with members we will go a little more out of our way. We need to get the best we can as far as items and weapons. If someone in the Guild wants a Bone Bladed Claymore, and you think you can help, do it.<br>
If you have a Bone Bladed Claymore and you get something better, give it to a member, or at LEAST sell it to them super-cheap. (By the time you would want to get rid of one of those things, money shouldn’t be a problem.<br>
<br>
Your funds vs. Guild funds:<br>
<br>
Simple, if you wish to donate to the Guild as a whole, do so. Give all donations to Muirlan, for he is the guild leader. All donations will be kept track of. If you need money to get a new spell or weapon, just ask Muirlan. It’s that simple. If you feel you need to keep a record of your transactions as well, take a screenshot. Don’t worry though, we are here to help each other, not rip each other off.<br>
Donating to the guild is NOT required, and will NOT change your standing in the guild in any way. If no one donates however, no one will be able to receive guild funds. It’s a simple case of supply and demand.<br>
<br>
Buying and selling:<br>
<br>
Easy one here too. If someone is selling an item for an unbelievably low price…even if it doesn’t fit your class or race, GET IT!!! Another guild member might need it, and you can give it, or sell it to them (for the same price please). Or you can donate it to the guild bank (see above). If you are gonna sell…to non-members, get as high a price as you are able to fairly achieve. Verant has given us the wonderful /auc command. Use it.<br>
If selling to a guild member, sell for as low a price as you feel you can.<br>
<br>
Things NOT to do (i.e. Stuff that will get you kicked out if you keep doing it):<br>
<br>
Don’t kill steal. Don’t rip off the Guild. Don’t harass someone unless they go after you first. And for god’s sake….don’t use the word DEWD. I hate that word….(OK, you won’t get kicked for that…but I still hate it.) Complaints of un-guildlike conduct will be swiftly investigated and dealt with accordingly.<br>
<br>
Guild stance on Twinking and Camping:<br>
<br>
Twinking: DO IT!!!! Do it 24-7!!! The quicker we gain levels, the more powerful we become. (Once again, you make the call here.) As far as Verant states, “twinking” is NOT illegal. It is simply one high-level character helping a low-level character, and our guild is here to help us all. So, if you see a member, and he’s level 8 while you are level 20, Twink away!!!!<br>
<br>
Camping: Only camp long enough to get the item you need. Once you have the item, go elsewhere. If you are camping for xp, try to move around a bit. We’ve all seen how much it sucks to wait for campers to leave, so let’s try to be a little better than they are, ok?<br>
<br>
Recruiting new members:<br>
<br>
Test them out…group with them…if they have talent…invite them. If their name is something like, “Philatio, Krotch, Asshead, Buttmonkey….etc….etc….etc” DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, INVITE THEM!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
The Day of Retribution:<br>
<br>
One day, we will all reach level 50. Once we have 36 members at that level…we will make an assault on Nagafen’s Lair. We will, in effect, kill our Master. Many screenshots will be taken, and life will be good. If Verant puts something meaner and nastier in the game, we’ll go kill that. Whatever, as long as it’s mean and nasty. It is my intent to show, that with 6 full parties…all expert groupers…the Super-NPC’s CAN be taken down without a single death. I may be wrong, we shall see.<br>
<br>
<br>
Battle Tactics:<br>
The writings of Sun Tzu, annotated by Vandergrave.<br>
<br>
This is just amazing. After thumbing through “The Art of War”, I realized it’s almost a perfect Everquest companion book! So many of the verses correlate directly to the game. Read on adventurers! I have added annotations after each passage.<br>
Also, there is more in here that I have commented on. Read these words and take them as the gospel. They are indispensable tactics.<br>
<br>
“Military action is important to the nation- It is the ground of death and life, the path of survival and destruction, so it is imperative to examine it.<br>
Therefore measure in terms of five things, use these assessments to make comparisons, and thus find out what the conditions are. The five things are the way, the weather, the terrain, the leadership, and discipline.<br>
The way means inducing the people to have the same aim as the leadership so that they will share death and share life, without fear of danger.<br>
The terrain is to be assessed in terms of distance, difficulty or ease of travel, dimension, and safety.<br>
The weather means the seasons.<br>
Leadership is a matter of intelligence, trustworthiness, humaneness, courage, and sternness.<br>
Discipline means organization, chain of command, and logistics.<br>
Every general has heard of these five things. Those who know them prevail, those who do not know them do not prevail. Therefore use these assessments for comparison, to find out what the conditions are. That is to say, which political leadership has the way? Who has the better climate and terrain? Whose discipline is effective? Whose troops are the stronger? Whose officers and soldiers are better trained? Whose system of rewards and punishments is clearer? This is how you can know who will win.<br>
So it is said that if you know others and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know others but know yourself, you win one and lose one; if you do not know others and do not know yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.” – Sun Tzu<br>
<br>
In other words… know your enemy!! Study patterns of attack, if a griffin attacks you in a particular manner, rest assured he will do it the same way next time. Know your surroundings,<br>
And listen to what people are saying. If the locals keep shouting about an NPC, and you don’t know who he is…it’s safe to assume he’s bad news.<br>
When grouped, Follow the leader!! There is a good reason why you have a leader…and why he or she is called the leader. Your lead member should not be chosen because of their level, <br>
They should be chosen because of their experience in the zone you are adventuring through.<br>
A low-level leader who knows the zone by heart is better than a high-level leader who has never been there before.<br>
<br>
“When you do battle, even if you are winning, if you continue for a long time it will dull your forces and blunt your edge; if you besiege a citadel, your strength will be exhausted. If you keep your armies out in the field for a long time, your supplies will be insufficient.<br>
When your forces are dulled, your edge is blunted, your strength is exhausted, and your supplies are gone, then others will take advantage of your debility and rise up. Then even if you have wise advisors, you cannot make things turn out well in the end.<br>
Therefore I have heard of military operations that were clumsy but swift, but I have never seen one that was skillful and lasted a long time. It is never beneficial to a nation to have a military operation continue for a long time.<br>
The rules of the military are five: measurement, assessment, calculation, comparison and victory. The ground gives rise to measurements, measurements give rise to assessments, assessments give rise to calculations, calculations give rise to comparisons, comparisons give rise to victories.<br>
If you know your soldiers are capable of striking, but do not know whether the enemy is invulnerable to a strike, you have half a chance of winning. If you know the enemy is vulnerable to a strike, but do not know if your soldiers are capable of making such a strike, you have half a chance of winning. If you know the enemy is vulnerable to a strike, and know your soldiers can make the strike, but do not know if the lay of the land makes it unsuitable for battle, you have half a chance of winning.<br>
When opponents present openings, you should penetrate the immediately. Get to what they want first, subtly anticipate them. Maintain discipline and adapt to the enemy in order to determine the outcome of the war. Thus, at first you are like a maiden, so the enemy opens his door; then you are like a rabbit on the lose, so the enemy cannot keep you out.<br>
Act after having made assessments. The one who first knows the measures of far and near wins - This is the rule of armed struggle.<br>
In military matters it is not necessarily beneficial to have more strength, only to avoid acting aggressively; it is enough to consolidate your power, assess opponents, and get people, that is all.” – Sun Tzu<br>
<br>
Here’s an easy one, if a bit long winded: Hit fast, Hit hard. The longer a battle rages, the longer you risk death. But, do not be mislead, a battle is already lost if you did not assess it.<br>
You must know the outcome before the battle is fought, or you will almost always be surprised.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Therefore those who are not thoroughly aware of the disadvantages in the use of arms cannot be thoroughly aware of the advantages in the use of arms.<br>
So the rule for use of the military is that if you outnumber the opponent ten to one, then surround them; five to one attack; two to one divide.<br>
If you are equal, then fight if you are able. If you are fewer, then keep away if you are able. If you are not as good, then flee if you are able.<br>
Invincibility is in oneself, vulnerability is in the opponent.<br>
Those who are first on the battlefield and await the opponents are at ease; those who are last on the battlefield and head into battle get worn out.<br>
Therefore good warriors cause others to come to them, and do not go to others.<br>
To advance irresistibly, push through their gaps. To retreat elusively, outspeed them.<br>
If you can strike few with many, you will thus minimize the number of those with whom you do battle.<br>
So a skillful military operation should be like a swift snake that counters with its tail when someone strikes at it's head, counters with it's head when someone strikes at its tail, and counters with both head and tail when someone strikes at its middle. The question may be asked can a military force be made to be like this swift snake? The answer is that it can. Even people who dislike each other, if in the same boat, will help each other out in trouble.<br>
Therefore those skilled in military operations achieve cooperation in a group so that directing the group is like directing a single individual with no other choice.<br>
To assemble armies and put them into dangerous situations is the business of generals. Adaptations to different grounds, advantages of contraction and expansion, patterns of human feelings and conditions - these must be examined.” – Sun Tzu<br>
<br>
Know your group. What are they capable of? What are they not capable of? Get where you are going, and wait for the enemy to come to you, so as not to be surprised. This is how trains start.<br>
When confronted by a train, the group MUST be focused. I have seen many a group go down to a train because they all attacked different targets. Always eliminate the greatest threat.<br>
If your group is attacked, respond with violent force to destroy the attacker.<br>

“To plunder a locality, divide up your troops. To expand your territory, divide the spoils.” – Sun Tzu<br>
<br>
Ahhh, the “tentacle” theory. If in an easy zone for your group’s level, don’t stay grouped!! Sound crazy? Think about it, your loot will be multiplied six-fold. And, to “expand your territory” (get more guild members) Give the loot away!! If you are grouped with a non-member, and he needs something you just got, give it to him. It makes him think to himself, “Hey!! These guys are great!! I wanna join!!”<br>
<br>
“The individualist without strategy who takes opponents lightly will inevitably become the captive of others.<br>
Therefore those who know martial arts do not wander when the move, and do not become exhausted when they rise up. So it is said that when you know yourself and others, victory is not in danger; when you know sky and earth, victory is inexhaustible.” – Sun Tzu<br>
<br>
It’s as simple as this, in a group, there can be no individuals. The group must fight, move, and think as one. Don’t run off, for every member that is killed by a train, or gets lost decreases the group’s effectiveness. And doing so reduces the group’s trust in you, that’s never good.<br>
<br>
“Therefore tethered horses and buried wheels are not sufficiently reliable.” – Sun Tzu<br>
<br>
Tethered horses and buried wheels. Never has more apt a description of meding been given. If someone is meding, they are blind and paralyzed. They must be protected at all costs, because the quicker they med, the quicker the party gets moving again.<br>
<br>
“Put them in a spot where they have no place to go, and they will die before fleeing. If they are to die there, what can they not do? Warriors exert their full strength. When warriors are in great danger, then they have no fear. When there is nowhere to go they are firm, when they are deeply involved they stick to it. If they have no choice, they will fight. For this reason the soldiers are alert without being drilled, enlist without being drafted, are friendly without treaties, are trustworthy without commands.<br>
Confront them with annihilation, and they will then survive; plunge them into a deadly situation, and they will then live. When people fall into danger, they are then able to strive for victory.” – Sun Tzu<br>
<br>
If you are in a situation where death is knocking at your door, do not run. It’s pointless, so why not go out with a fight? Do as much damage as you can. Use all your mana and special attacks. This only applies if death is inescapable, of course. If you can get out, do it. You can help the group better alive than dead, even if you do have to zone and sit a while.<br>
<br>
“Give out rewards that are not in the rules, give out directives that are not in the code.” – Sun Tzu<br>
<br>
The rules don’t say you have to buff and heal. Hell, as far as I know, there ARE no rules. Do it anyway. The group moves as one. Wouldn’t you buff and heal yourself? Think of every lost group member as a lost bubble of health. When their bars go down, most likely you will go down too.<br>

This was written by me a very long time ago....back when I was about level 9 on my original Primary. Most of this stuff is dated to say the least. What I WOULD ask is that you pay attention to the Art of War sections. This stuff is ALWAYS valid.<br>
As far as I understand it, Muirlan is working on a new Charter as we speak. <p><html>
