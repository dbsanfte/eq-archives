class=m><span class=title>   The Fraud</span><hr size=1> Stormygale twitched in her sleep. She was dreaming of lusty Lizards, when suddenly her eyes popped open and she sat up.  She was damp and tangled in her blankets, and it took her a while to remove them so she could get up and stagger to look out the window. As she feared, it was the dead of night. No dawn. Just the cold cruel stars looking down on her like shards of glass. They held no answers for her. She was lost. <br>
<br>
Her back was on fire as she returned to her bed and sat on its twisted damp wool. She put her head in her hands and moaned.  Then she reached over to the table near the bed to grab the flask of brandy she always kept near.  She sipped as she did every night now, and every day. It helped to dull the pain, but it also dulled her mind. She really didn’t care. The blow from the dragon in the Hedge Run of the Plane of Nightmare had almost broken her back. She still hadn’t healed from it, and it caused her much pain. The brandy helped. Sometimes. If she drank enough. Oh she’d received her flag to a gateway of a plane she’d never see, but the cost had been terrible. She was now a cripple.<br>
<br>
She had taken up residence in an inn in Freeport, and had found a tavern that would deliver. No one traveled there much anymore, and she was rarely bothered.  Every day they brought her food and brandy, although she rarely ate anymore. She had no appetite, and she’d lost a lot of weight. They now brought less food and more brandy.<br>
<br>
She had not told the guild of her injury. There was nothing to be done about it anyway. Either it would heal, or it would not. She feared it would not. She had prayed to her icy God, The Lady Tunare, but Tunare had remained silent, as always. The wench. It had been many months now, and still she could barely move without fire streaking down her leg. She was unable even to stand upright, and so spent most of her time in bed. She could no longer sit in a chair without agony, and there was no way she could fight. She doubted she could even hold a shield.  For the hundredth time she looked over at her epic sword leaning carefully against the wall. She only had to fall upon it for it to all be over. In this room she rarely ever left, no one would know. There were no clerics nearby, only useless maids who did nothing but chatter. They never entered her room but once a week to change the bedding. If she timed it right, it would be too late for a cleric to help her, even if the maids called for one which was doubtful, as they were dumb as posts. <br>
<br>
She sighed. Something in her wasn’t quite ready for that final solution. Something still rebelled. For some silly reason she still had hope, but hope was a dangerous thing.  She lay back down and tried to get comfortable, still sipping her brandy. <br>
<br>
As the brandy took effect, she let her mind wander to the past. She remembered back when Norrath was new and she was so young. Life was so powerful then. Everything was so exciting with new adventures and new people to meet. People were nice back then. It was rare to run into an evil traitorous sneak. But over the years the evil-doers had become more numerous and she had become wary. She remembered very clearly the first time she’d fell to a scam in Eastern Commons. She’d lost two thousand pieces of platinum to the firepot dupe. God she was so young. So stupid back then. <br>
<br>
She remembered the first time she saw a Hill Giant in the West commons. She’d about wet herself with fear. How could anything be so BIG? And the first time she found floating swords in Kithicor Forest, before it had been changed to such a bastion of evil. It had been a beautiful wood, and she still remembered exploring it’s depths with glee.  She had no idea what Shadow Men were back then, but she had been wary of those floating swords, and had kept her distance, even camouflaged as she was.  And the first time she had ventured to that far off frozen tundra of the Barbarians and met the Lady Vox. She had been summoned and had died. But everyone had died that day. It was something that amazed her still, this power clerics had to recall a person from death. The death she craved though would be permanent. There would be no resurrection for her.  If she ever found her courage.<br>
<br>
Her guild must have thought she had abandoned them by now. And in truth, she almost had.  She was unable to attend and help with their battles, and was unable to bear the fact that she was so useless.  It was remarkable that any of them even remembered that she still existed. She felt like transparent paper. Or a Ghost. Something that showed up and wavered in the background once in a rare while, but was never seen.  Useless and hollow. She looked at her sword again, as she sipped. <br>
<br>
The worst part of her isolation was the fact that over the months, she had lost all of those people she had once called friend. They had gone. Either to another place she could not go, Stormygale being so young, or had left the world of Norrath forever.  Either way, she was truly alone.  To be guilded or not guilded at this point would hardly make a difference. Her guild had traveled on, while she had been injured. She would not catch up. In truth, she couldn’t. She had been left behind. Well, she had become used to being alone.  She had always been alone. Just her and her brandy.<br>
<br>
But she loved the Claw of Nagafen, though it tore her apart. It had become her home. Full, as it was, with such wonderful people. She admired so many of them and their astonishing ability to do what other guilds could only do with twice the people. She was proud to wear the guild tag, but felt in her heart that it was a hollow sham. She only watched the guild from afar now. She wasn’t a participant in the glorious battles that gave The Claw of Nagafen its reputation. She was a fraud.  Could she really go on wearing this tag and be truthful to her guild? She sipped some more brandy.  She had spoken of her feelings to the last friend she had on Norrath, and he had pleaded with her not to leave, as did an officer she had approached. But how could she stay and be honest? She was so torn. <br>
<br>
Again, there were no answers for her. So, she sipped her brandy and lay in her bed, and let the world revolve. More and more often, her eyes wandered to her epic sword, but her eyes grew heavy with the effects of the brandy and again, she fell asleep to dream of lusty Lizards...<br>

He was barely visible in his tiny corner of the immense throne made from the bones of one of the First Brood -- the ancient dragons.  For so many years, he had been kin to the dragons and the coldain.  In fact, he was one of the first explores into the dread wastes of Velious -- forswearing the brutal giants and allying with the smaller creatures of the land.   Now he sat atop dread Tormax's throne, with the head of his former lord Dain Frostreaver in his pocket....<br>
<br>
He pulled out a small pipe and smoked quietly.  Nodding to him, the giant guards wandered through their preappointed rounds as he reflected.  He had not seen Stormygale for many a day.  Perhaps she was sojourning in lands far afield -- perhaps paying respects to her mother Abruzi or her dread father who had been seen in the Planes of Power of late...  Quaras fretted silently.  Concerned was he that Stormygale always wandered her way until she glimpsed her true power and then bolted like a colt back to new lands, new identities, new adventures....  She had yet to embrace her birthright and realize that even her silent haunting goddess had been brought down by mere mortals.  She was missed.

What in Tunare's creation was all that ruckus going on downstairs? Normaly, the tavern she chose to stay in was peaceful, but for the occasional brawl. This,  however, went far beyond any brawl she'd ever heard before. Someone was thumping something on the floor of her bedroom, or as you like, the ceiling below her.  The something seemed to be human as it made some squeals as such. Stormygale thought she knew what was going on.<br>
<br>
There was quite a bit of outraged troll downstairs. She'd seen him many times, as he lurked in the shadows. He seemed kind of nice, once you got over the fact he was a troll. He certainly had a better grasp of language then most trolls she'd ever met. She kind of liked him, and they'd spoken quite often.<br>
<br>
He'd even given her some kind of shaman brew to drink for the pain she'd been suffering with. Remarkably, it seemed to help. At least she could move about without constant agony, and for that she was grateful forever. That and the fact that she no longer had to endure the king of all hangovers every morning. Or the dreams that came with all that brandy. Lizards, indeed. She blushed as she thought of it.  Maybe a little brandy now and then would be a good thing...<br>
<br>
She also wondered if she should go down and see what was going on, but the immediate yelling had stopped so she decided to clean herself up a bit. It had been a long while since she last had a bath. <br>
<br>
Opening the door, she grabbed a passing maid who had a rather frightened look on her face, and requested a tub and lots of very hot water. The heat would also do her back good. She gathered clean clothing and soaps as the maid did as she requested. A tub was brought in and filled with near boiling water. Stormygale gave the helpers all a few plat as a tip, then closed the door and stripped, shedding clothes like a snake sheding skin, she left them where they fell. They stank.<br>
<br>
As she sunk into the bath with a groan of relief, she heard men's voices through the floor. Muffled as they were, she couldn't understand it, but she wouldn't be surprised if there were some screams sometime soon. That tended to happen when one irritated a troll.<br>
<br>
Stormygale was definately feeling better. She wondered if she should actually go out this evening. Maybe try to solo a bit. Tone some muscles and get back into the swing of things. She missed her guildmates and her isolation was only causing her to fall into depression. She definately needed to get out more. <br>
<br>
A scream echoed from downstairs, disturbing her musing. Well, she'd known it was coming. She reached for her soap and started lathering her long black hair... <p><html>

<br>
She had hopped upon the table for dramatic effect, and it seemed to be working. &quot;These girls are dumber than they look,&quot; she thought to herself.<br>
<br>
Cries of &quot;she is not to be disturbed&quot; and &quot;she left strict orders ma'am&quot; came from all directions.<br>

<br>
&quot;Thank you. Now, send up something hot to drink in ten minutes. And NO ALCOHOL!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, the diminutive cleric tromped up the stairs. Banging on the door that had been pointed out to her, she huffed, &quot;Stormygale!! Get dressed! I'm coming in.

She didn't care who was banging on her door, but it was giving her a headache.  <br>
<br>
She reached over the tub of cooling water and grabbed her bottle of Pirate Brandy and took a huge gulp. The liquid was powerful strong, and it went down hard, but it worked best and it worked fast. <br>
<br>
The hot water had helped her back, and she was reluctant to get out of the tub, even as it cooled. Her skin looked wrinkled like a prune, but at least she didn't stink anymore. She wondered what to do with those disgusting clothes on the floor. But then she was getting so drunk she didn't know if she cared. Her pain was fading to that dull ever present ache.<br>
<br>
Finally, not being able to stand that pounding at the door, she got out of the tub, dripping water all over and grabbed a sheet to cover herself. She stopped on the way, as she wobbled to the door to throw her filthy clothes into the tub to soak. It would do. She hiccuped, and almost fell as she slid on some water.<br>
<br>
But she was getting madder than a hornet at all that banging  at her door, so she finally unlocked it and threw it open with a bang. She was about to give a screeching tirade when she saw who it was. Saphron! How in Tunare's name had she found her? <br>
<br>
&quot;Go away Saph. I don't want you here. Leave me alone,&quot; she slurred loudly, and slammed the door shut and locked it again. Not giving a hoot as the little halfling began banging on her door and yelling to be let in. Let her bang. Let her yell.<br>
<br>
Stormygale grabbed her bottle of brandy and returned to the bed where she lay back down, and seriously started slugging.  When Saphron broke through that door, and Stormygale had no doubts that she would, she would find one passed out human. It was the only way she could think of to avoid that cleric.<br>
<br>
So she sipped and slugged as fast as she could. <p><b>Stormygale El`Orian</b><img border=0 src="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" /></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#141419><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=saphronlafeete>Saphron LaFeete</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/16/03 10:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> &quot;Alright young lady, if that's how you want it,&quot; Saphron said quietly, staring at the doorknob only inches from her face.<br>
<br>
Reaching down, she pulled the gleaming Hammer of Damnation from her pack.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, this will do nicely,&quot; she smiled, as the housemaids stared in disbelief.<br>
<br>
Saphron started banging away at the door. After a couple of good bashes and a proc from the hand of Bristlebane, the door shattered inward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hrmph, flimsy thing,&quot; she said as she stepped into the room.<br>
<br>
Her green eyes flashed as she peered around the room. There, on the bed, was Stormygale, passed out cold.<br>
<br>
&quot;As I suspected. Poor child, still as predictable as ever,&quot; she smiled to herself.<br>
<br>
Saphron stepped outside and called downstairs. Several young halflings came scurrying into the room. Saphron begain barking orders.<br>
<br>
&quot;Peri, you and Flippin gather up these disgusting rags she calls clothes. Bracken, you and your brothers gather HER up. The rest of you clean up this room and meet us in RiverVale as soon as you can. We have work to do!&quot;<br>
<br>
Saphron then led quite an interesting parade down the stairs. As she passed the front desk of the Inn, she looked up at the bewildered innkeep. Indignantly, she tossed a bag of platinum coins to him. &quot;Forgive us for the intrusion. This should more than cover the uh . . . renovations . . . upstairs.<br>
<br>
&quot;To Rivervale boys, and do not tarry!&quot; she shouted.<br>
<br>
Passing Athene, who was giggling uncontrollably by now, Saphron threw her a wry smile. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Treantess, what are you waiting for? You'll be needed in this, too. We have some reprogramming to do!&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, the halfling procession, awkwardly carrying a very drunk, loudly snoring human, headed off into the night to RiverVale... <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:gold;font-family:Garamond;font-size:medium;">Saphron LaFeete</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:garamond;font-size:small;">High Priestess of Bristlebane </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212128><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=athene>Athene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/_uimages/ahstarsm.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/16/03 11:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/eye.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> Athene gathered her bags and followed dutifully.

<br>
Athene would take the shorter way by teleport to Misty and make ready for their arrival.  With Stormygale out cold, Athene would be unable to pull her through the portal, and she knew that Saphron would likely be stopping along the way to collect some herbs in case they had to call in a shaman.  The fresh air would do Stormygale good too, judging from the looks of her.<br>

It must be a dream, but it was a most unusual one. She was floating. Well, kind of floating. Actually she was sort of going up and down but it wasn't smooth. She was being jounced around and one of her bare feet kept whacking on dirt. The pain of it was waking her up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wa tha el is gone on,&quot; Stormygale whispered to herself as she warily opened her eyes to a mere slit. She blearily peered at an army of halflings that were bumping her along without a thought, or a glance to see if she were awake. She realized she was being kidnapped and these halflings were carrying her who knew where for who knew why. Her heel was beginning to really hurt after being smashed against a particularly large rock, and that was the last straw. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wa the el. Lego me you stinkin runters. I said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>LET ME GO!&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and she began to fight them like a wild creature. Her back screaming as well as her mouth. Her now white hair flying about her like the storm cloud about to arrive. Cursing and whacking halflings left and right she finally got them off her and she stood up tall, then bent over in pain. But she stood back up in spite of it and looked a particular halfling in the eye. <br>
<br>
&quot;I tol you ta leaf me be. Didja thin I was kidn?&quot; Stormygale slurred with an odd grimace.  Without any notice she let loose such a Fury of Karana, it blew the entire retinue of haflings off their feet and left them stunned as they lay, as it was meant to do. Saphron was even knocked off her feet and was as stunned as the rest of the halflings. When she finally got to her feet, she stood only to watch as Stormygale vanished using a fast evac. There was nothing left but a few floating spell flickers to tell she had even been there. <br>

<br>
Saphron rose to her feet and howled into the wind where Stormy had vanished, &quot;I'm coming for you Stormygale! By Bristlebane's Mark, I will find you!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking around her at the bumfuzzled group of young hobbits on the ground, Saphron stood for a moment, hands on hips. Then, noticing their fear, she said, comforting them, &quot;Never fear my young friends. She could have burned you all to cinders had she wanted to . . . or had she been sober enough to remember the incantation . . . &quot; Then she began giggling, and the young ones smiled along with her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Pick up your things my friends, this is not over. In her state, she could have blown herself right in the middle of a pack of dragons. Well, Wuoshi be damned! Let's get to RiverVale quickly and gather Athene. She has a far greater network of friends than I. She'll be able to help us find that girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Miss Saphron?,&quot; came a meek voice from behind the cleric.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Holly?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why do you want to help that human? I mean, I know she used to be your friend and all, but . . . she's so mean . . . &quot;<br>
<br>
Saphron put a hand on the young halfling's shoulder, &quot;She may be a curmudgeon, and she may be mean, and she may be spiteful, I agree . . . but Holly, she's dear Abruzi's daughter, and I promised Abruzi the last time I saw her that I would watch over that hotheaded little guttersnipe. And, I will. And besides . . . she's my friend, and I love her. And, I'm worried for her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now, you run along to RiverVale and inform Athene that we're coming. She'll no doubt be holed up at Grannie Mannie's place awaiting us. You are much faster than the rest of us, and I'm counting on you to have Athene ready when we arrive. There is no time to lose.&quot;<br>
<br>
Holly smiled up at Saphron and, infusing herself with the spirit of the wolf, ran off to find the powerful Treantess.<br>
<br>
&quot;C'mon ya little runters! We have much to do!&quot; Saphron called out to the young halflings.

It was approaching midday, and Saphron should have made it to the outskirts of Rivervale by now--surely.  Perhaps she’d stopped in the Commonlands at one of the inns?  It didn’t really seem likely though.  Stormygale was going to be fit to be tied when she woke.  For that matter, binding Stormygale would probably be a good idea—else she’d probably bolt at her first opportunity via teleport or wolf’s speed.  Such measures were not Saphron’s style, however; and Athene couldn’t imagine the senior cleric wanting to draw any more attention than necessary in getting Abruzi’s volatile daughter to Rivervale.<br>
<br>
Athene had posted wolves in the Kithicor pass to be on the lookout for Saphron and her party.  Many of the halflings were young, and it could be Saphron did not wish to take them through the forest after nightfall.  Though Saphron, herself, could easily handle the grim undead, she wasn’t the type of person to place the jolly young of her own kind in situations so foreign to their happy, carefree nature.  It was a pox on Norrath that those horrors descended nightly so near the vale of Antonica’s most cheerful people.  –All part of the balance her mind answered, and she banished those thoughts.  Time for philosophy later.<br>
<br>
She was standing near the stone-hewed tunnel leading into Rivervale straining her human eyes to see farther into the jade light of Kithicor when she spied a lone halfling female bustling with all speed through the trees.  “Miss Athene!  Miss Athene!” cried the girl, growing closer, her short legs now pumping with a fury having seen the druidess Miss Saphron had sent her to find.  “There’s been trouble!  That girl has done escaped!  Took off like a black wolf into the night, she did!”<br>
<br>
Athene reached out and hugged the girl close as she drew to arm’s length.  “Welcome home,” she said smiling.  “How far are the others behind you?  They’re all right, yes?  No one injured?  What’s happened?  Saphron’s on the way?”  <br>
<br>
Barely pausing to breathe, Holly told her story—Stormygale awake, escaped, Saphron comin’ with the main party close behind.  “She says to tell you to get ready, Ma’am.  I’m thinking you know what she means.”<br>
<br>
“Aye, Holly,” Athene nodded.  “I think I do.  Let’s get back to Grannie Mannie’s.  The world is large, but all wolves crave shelter when it rains.  We need to get some food on the table for our friends coming in, and I’m going to have to figure out where our wolf’s lair is now …”<br>
<br>
Athene cast a spell extinguishing Holly’s fatigue, and together the two clambered into the stone tunnel. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/sign_3.GIF" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212128><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stormygalewindrunner>Stormygale Windrunner</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 856<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/17/03 9:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> After Stormygale's evac to Eastern Karana, she quickly memorized the teleport to the moon. Arriving in Nexus, she caused rather a stir with her filthy sheet, so she decided to drop it and let it lie. <br>
<br>
Funny, but naked, no one took any notice of her. She was able to lose herself in the crowd. Oh a few men ogled her. She was by no means a dog, with her silvery white hair, even if she was a wolf. And she had to actually bare her teeth at a big Barbarian who got too friendly. He'd learned the hard way when she bit him. Wolf form or no, she knew how to use her teeth.<br>
<br>
Zoning into the Bazaar, she quickly went to the bank and got her spare clothes, bustling and pushing amongst the crowd. The Bazaar was always so full of people these days. But she was fully dressed now, had her sword, and was completely anonymous. She quickly made the necessary purchases and then zoned into Shadow Haven. <br>
<br>
There was an inn there. Expensive, and very elite. They kept their mouths shut and that's all that mattered. She had plat, and she wanted silence.<br>
<br>
Opening the door to her new room she deposited the bottles in the corner that she'd bought downstairs, and sat on the clean bed. <br>
<br>
But then she put her head in her hands and started to cry. Huge great sobs so that she could barely catch her breath between them. Her head hurt. Her back was on fire and so was her bloodied heel. And she was tired. So very tired of it.<br>
<br>
Why in that cold witich of Tunare's grace couldn't they leave her alone? Well, they wouldn't find her this time. She wiped her eyes on her sleeves and grabbed a bottle, cracked it and started to slug its fiery contents down. She finished that one and grabbed another, and as her pain eased she stopped sniveling like a baby and began to giggle. Oh the look oh Saphron's face! If she only had a portrait she'd hang it on the wall and guffaw every morning!<br>
<br>
Of course she'd hoped she hadn't hurt any of those younglings. Not that she hadn't minded seeing Saphron lying spread eagle'd in the dirt, but how was she supposed to know what was going on? Where they were taking her? No one pushed Stormygale around, not without paying a price for it. <br>
<br>
Laying back, she thought to herself it had been an interesting day. As the brandy hit her, and her thoughts grew muddled, she giggled once more as she slowly slid into unconsciousness, and the empty bottle clatttered quietly as it slid from her hand onto the nicely carpeted floor.  <p><b>Stormygale El`Orian</b><img border=0 src="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" /></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stormygalewindrunner>Stormygale Windrunner</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/17/03 10:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#141419><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=athene>Athene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/_uimages/ahstarsm.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/17/03 11:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/eye.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> Athene spread the maps out before her on the packed-dirt floor of Mannie’s back room.  In one of three cots, Holly was sleeping soundly, an occasional snore breaking the silence.  In the other room, a feast was being prepared—and consumed—all at the same time.  Athene had never known any race to take such delight in the simple pleasures of good food.  She chuckled and returned to her work.  <br>
<br>
She was seated cross-legged on the floor, both her elbows resting on a knee.  Her chin cradled in one palm, she studied the maps.  Where would Stormygale go?  <br>
<br>
Athene picked up a quill, dipped its tip into an ink pot by her side and began to circle and cross out teleport locations and cities.  Skyfire?  Dangerous, … but Stormygale had hunted there.  Not likely though.  No place to hide.  Many travelers.  And among the regulars hunting the wyverns for the scrolls they sometimes carried, Stormygale was well known.   With two quick strokes, Athene crossed out Skyfire.<br>
<br>
Abruzi’s daughter would need or crave a ready supply of alcohol.  Saphron had detected real pain beyond heartache in Abruzi’s daughter, and she would try to quench it with drink.  Athene made a quick X with her quill.  Not Sanctus Seru.  --Dawnshroud Peaks was the closest teleport to that severe city.  Athene’s hand hovered over the map.  She grimaced and didn’t cross it out.  Dawnshroud would be a good location for one hoping to slip into Luclin’s cities undetected.  Stormygale would know the Nexus would be watched from now on.  But she could have traveled there when she fled Saphron on the journey to Rivervale.  She could be in Shadowhaven.  Athene shook her head.  She could be a lot of places.<br>
<br>
The druidess was methodical, and though she was sincerely concerned for Stormygale’s well being, she loved a good hunt.  Athene put aside the map of Luclin and pulled forward a map of Antonica.  Lots of places to hide here, so now to other details that would lead her to her ... prey.  Stormygale might be swimming in drink, but she couldn’t abide the rot-gut brews common throughout Norrath; and like her mother, she favored brandy—<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>good</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> brandy.  “Jeek!  Come ‘ere please!  I’ve got a job for you!”<br>
<br>
A round-bellied halfling hurried into the room.  “What’s that ye be a needin’, Miss?” he said, rubbing his hands together briskly, seeming eager to be of some need.<br>
<br>
“I want a comprehensive list of the best inns and taverns in Norrath that serve the finest quality brandy—or least something darn passable.”<br>
<br>
Jeek’s eyebrows raised.  “Ye mean all of ‘em, Ma’am?  Everywhere?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, all of them.  Get a team together.  Find someone who knows brewing.  Get a list of brewers.  Don’t leave anything out.”<br>
<br>
Jeek nodded, “Yes ‘um.  I’ll get on it.”  He turned to leave and then stopped.  “We need to get some people up in the Bazaar.  Lot of traffic through there.  It’d be a good place to pick up a supply of whatever she’d need.  I’ve got family in the halfling quarter there.  I can’t abide Luclin much myself, but I’ll let them know.”<br>
<br>
Athene grinned.  “Thanks, Jeek.  I knew you’d develop a plan.”<br>
<br>
The affable halfling hurried off, and Athene returned to the map of Antonica.  Halas?  Too cold, too fraught with annoyances along the way for a druidess who was suffering.<br>
<br>
Freeport was large, but the city gates were easy to watch.  Coins placed in the hands of the right people would eventually lead to Stormygale’s exposure if she had decided to return there.<br>
<br>
Qeynos was probably too far out, and a powerful druidess such as Stormygale would garner much attention.<br>
<br>
Athene began to spread her maps out around her in a circle.  “Where are you, Stormy girl?” she whispered.<br>

It was time for research. As Saphron rose to check on Athene's progress, a frightened young halfling rushed to her side, whispering in her ear frantically.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's alright Petaldust, he's an old friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young halfling returned to the door and, opening it wide, allowed the hulking giant of a stranger entry into the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;TONDAR!!!&quot; Saphron beamed as she rushed to hug the great barbarian shaman, &quot;How good to see you at long last! How long has it been? How many months?&quot;<br>
<br>
Noticing the look of concern on his face, Saphron backed away. &quot;What is it, old friend?&quot;<br>
<br>
By now, the room had gone silent, and even Athene had noticed the feeling of tension in the burrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Saphron, I do not mean to alarm you Old Girl, but . . . well . . . it's Abruzi's daughter. Stormcloud? Stormwind?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Stormygale, Tondar,&quot; Saphron said with a smirk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, that's it. How could I forget? Well, it's Stormygale. I could have sworn I saw her earlier today. But she seemed . . . different. Even in wolf form, I would know a child of my old friend Abruzi's . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
The great barbarian Prophet rubbed a bandaged hand gingerly. <br>
<br>
&quot;But when I approached her to say hello, and merely ask how she was doing . . . the wench bit me!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so sorry, Tondar, we'll have a look at that bite, but I can assure you, there was probably enough alcohol in her system to sterilize any wound she may have given you. Can you remember where you saw her?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well now, it's hard to say, really. An old shaman travels quite a lot these days, you know. I was in Kelethin earlier today . . . had a lovely drink with a lovely elf friend there . . . she does love her brandy . . . then I traveled to Qeynos to see the Apothecary there, he is such a fine fellow, with many a fine story to tell, and so close to home . . . and then, of course, I spent some time in the Bazaar and the Nexus to see what I could see . . . Yes, it's been a busy day. What's going on, Saph?&quot;<br>

So many teleports these days.  She no longer bothered committing all of the incantations to memory.  The motions were all the same.  She’d hardly had a chance to greet Tondar, whom she had not seen in many seasons when Saphron barked, “NEXUS!  Now!  And bring Jeek’s list!”<br>
<br>
Tondar backed up a bit, seeming briefly befuddled at Saphron’s sudden urgency and brusque manner.  Then he grinned, attributing it all to the fact that they were women.  No use trying to figure it out, especially with these two particular women.<br>
<br>
Athene and Saphron briefly linked hands.  Saphron nodded her consent for the transport, and Athene began to recite the words.  The portal opened.  The scene in the room froze: Holly with spoon in hand heaping vegetables onto the plate she’d begun preparing for Tondar.  Then the scene changed.  Saphron and Athene stood on the Nexus platform.  Beneath the marble flooring, the black rock foundation of the Nexus pulsed with energy.<br>
<br>
“Why, here, Saph?” Athene queried.<br>
<br>
&quot;She can’t be hitting the teleport rings all day.  She knows we’ll be looking—IF she’s sober enough to think at all—and she’s got to find a place to rest.  Saphron’s face grew sober.  “She’s sick, Athene.  It’s beyond general depression, but that and the drink aren’t helping her.”<br>
<br>
Athene nodded. <br>
<br>
“Now, what’s on the list?”  Saphron was back to the business at hand.<br>
<br>
Athene dropped her bags, and fumbled to find Jeek’s lists.  She began to recite the neatly penned words on a short piece of parchment.  “Luclin.  List incomplete.  Two probable locations—Shadowhaven, Shandeling's Roost, inn and tavern; Twilight Sea, Jern’s Rest.  Possible additional refuge Fungus Grove.  Uncertain.  Sending courier with instructions to scout.”<br>
<br>
“Which do you think?  Yer a druid.  Where would you go?”<br>
<br>
Athene’s face grew whimsical.  “The Twilight Sea”<br>
<br>
“For all the mischief of Bristlebane!  Would you get your head out of the clouds!  Tis no time to be thinking of romance!  To Shadowhaven we go!”<br>
<br>
The two women resettled their packs on their shoulders and hurried to the east exit ... to Shadowhaven.<br>

Why is it, she wondered idly, that the more expensive the brandy, the worse it was in the morning? Somehow the logic escaped her.<br>
<br>
She also wondered if she should bother getting out of bed and get some water and food, or if she should just lay there for the day. She had brought plenty of brandy with her. There was no need to get up, but she was hungry. She couldn't even remember the last time she'd eaten. That wasn't good either. Oh the choice between two evils...<br>
<br>
Slowly she managed to get upright, while hanging onto the bedpost and not screaming. A good start. Since she hadn't bothered undressing she needn't be bothered with that either. Another good start. But it didn't stop a tear from trickling from her eye as she held onto the post for support. After a while it eased and she was able to pretend to walk almost normally out the door of her room and head for the stairs down to the barkeep. <br>
<br>
But she stopped in her tracks when she heard what could only be a halfling voice. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wots that ye say? Not seen a fair lass, tallish like bein Human an all, in the last few days? Well no need gitten uffy. If'n you ain't, you ain't.&quot;  And a door slammed shut soon afterwards.<br>
<br>
Stormygale knew that the extra $100 plat had been worth it last night. And she knew they'd keep it up as long as she kept it up. It being a pair of brothers who owned the place.<br>
<br>
She walked downstairs to the barkeep on the day shift, and leaned forward to give him an alluring grin. &quot;Nice work. Think this will buy me the same again?&quot; and she slid over another similar amount. The barkeep leant forward to one, swipe the money into his apron and two, breathe into her ear &quot;only for you darlin, I don't suppose you'd be free later?' he ended with a wink. <br>
<br>
If Stormygale had been well, she'd have considered it. He was a handsome fella. Just her type, but then said &quot;Sorry, I'm going to be busy, hon.&quot; She quickly purchased what she needed and blew him a kiss as she returned upstairs, knowing full well it would buy her another night, and the platinum had nothing to do with it. <br>
<br>
She'd have to move soon.<br>
<br>
She sipped the cool water and tore into a hunk of bread as she made her way back upstairs. Only then, when she had padded her stomach would she begin on the brandy. She didn't know how much longer she was going to be able to stand the pain.<br>
<br>

The inn was small and very near the teleporter in from the Nexus.  There were no vacancies, and the innkeeper, Morland, told them he’d “been full up” for a week.  Of course, she could have been there.  And the innkeeper could have been lying, but neither of the women thought so.  They had decided not to inquire regarding Stormygale right away.  They did, after all, legitimately require some accommodations themselves.  Morland suggested they try a larger inn, not on Jeek’s list—Grimthor’s Distillery.<br>
<br>
Athene raised an eyebrow.  How had Jeek missed this?  Of course, he had said the list was incomplete; and distillery wasn’t exactly a term commonly used for a boarding house or inn.  After thanking the innkeeper profusely for his help, Athene and Saphron again shouldered their bags and headed into the city center.  Grimthor’s Distillery was a large building, two storied, with a large open-air bar on an upper deck.<br>
<br>
They entered and immediately inquired regarding a room.  The innkeeper said he had a couple, both fairly small, both with a single frame bed, long enough for a human.  They could rent the two or take a single room.  One woman would have to sleep on the floor.  All his extra bedding had been let out as well.  There were more traders in the bazaar than usual.  Valuable items from the planes of power had begun making their way to the middle-man vendors of Luclin.  The bazaar had never been busier.  Business was good.<br>
<br>
Was there no place else to stay in Shadowhaven, Athene urged, some place very quiet, off the beaten path perhaps?  There was another inn, he said, but it was pricey and fairly exclusive.  Part of the Fordel compound, it served the city’s elite visitors and those with coin a’plenty to spare.  Saphron and Athene considered their options and decided to take a single room at Grimthor’s, at least to buy themselves some time.  They could stow their bags and send word to Jeek’s contacts.  If Stormygale was in Shadowhaven, they would ferret her out—one way or another.<br>

Saphron sat on the lone bed, short legs dangling above the floor, eying her warily.  “A dress?  Why a dress?  And why that one?  We’re not going to some fancy-dress ball!  We’re here to find that renegade Stormygale before she kills herself or someone else.”  <br>
<br>
Athene grimaced.  Maybe this was a bad idea, but it was an idea.  She felt they had to try something—different.  Jeek’s contacts had fanned out into the city inquiring after a woman meeting Stormygale’s description.  They’d had some leads, but in each instance, the woman proved not to be Stormygale.  <br>
<br>
There were a few private boarding rooms scattered within the city, but only a few, and all they knew of had been checked out.  Most of Shadowhaven’s visitors camped in or near the bazaar or in the halls of their respective professional class affiliates.  Athene had visited the rooms beneath the city where the druid masters consulted with those of their profession.  There were a few people milling around, but Athene caught no fleeting glimpse or scent of Stormygale among them.<br>
<br>
It was on her way back to Grimthor’s, where Saphron sat in talks with their halfling allies, that Athene picked up a faint trail tainted with blood that she was certain was Stormygale’s.  Her druid tracking skills were limited at best, but she had trained them as far as the gods would allow.  Often, especially in heavily traveled areas like cities or deep below ground where a druid was not keenly at ease, the trails would become muddled.  Other people’s tracks or scents would mix with those she sought, and sometimes, her trail would dead end.  <br>
<br>
The trail she picked up, not far from Grimthor’s, was stronger than usual—strengthened by blood.  Stormygale was injured.  <br>
<br>
Most of Shadowhaven’s streets were flag stoned.  Blood trails remained visible longer in areas not as heavily traveled.  Stormygale’s scent was strong, and even where the faint stain of blood had been diminished by many boot heels, it was easy to follow.  By the time Athene found herself outside a largish building with a tastefully decorated facade, she could have followed Stormygale’s trail with ease—blood trail or not.   They had been guild sisters for a long time.  When they all lived together in the guild hall of Natural Selection, Athene could often identify who was within the rooms merely by stepping into the main hall.<br>
<br>
Now, back in their room at Grimthor’s, Saphron and Athene discussed their next move.<br>
<br>
“Jeek’s people have already checked that place out, Athene.  The innkeep said no one like Stormygale is there.  Maybe she <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">was</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> there.  Maybe she is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">still</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> there.  You think he’s going to tell you something different just because you’re wearing a dress?”<br>
<br>
“Well, we can’t just waltz in there and demand they hand her over, Saphron.”<br>
 <br>
“Well, if we’re not waltzing, why, Athene, are you of all people wearing a dress?”<br>
<br>
Athene chuckled.  “If Stormygale is still there—and I’m certain she is—she’s paid them off.  Even if she hasn’t, this place strikes me as one of those honorable high-brow kind of places where people are paying for privacy and discretion as much as for their fancy rooms.  There’s no way we can match the money she may have doled out.  She’s probably stayed in this place before.  She knows how to travel in those circles.”<br>
<br>
Saphron nodded.  Stormygale was an heiress, a detail few knew.  She also knew the in’s and out’s of  buying and selling, and recognized a profitable deal when she saw one—skills and talents she has gotten from her mother.  Abruzi had owned a successful tavern in Fironia Vie during her lifetime and had left her daughter well off.  This wealth had increased under Stormygale’s management.  It was a tribute to her business sense that she actually had any platinum left, for she always seemed to give away as much as she took in.<br>
<br>
“I figure I’ll go in and pass myself off as damsel in distress, Saphron.  I’ll get a room.  Say I’m here awaiting my father who’s a wealthy merchant from Qeynos or something.  I can’t really go in my usual leathers.  She may have even told them who might be looking for her.  –Anyway, I’ll get a room and find her from within.  And when I do, we’ll probably have to use some force to take her down.  This injury is turning her vicious.  She’s like a caged animal.  I think we’ll have to tie her up to keep her from escaping.”<br>
<br>
Athene could tell by the look on Saphron’s face, she didn’t like the idea.  She had definite boundaries when it came to the use of force—at least when it came to her loved ones.<br>
<br>
“Just long enough to talk to her, Saph.  To talk some sense into her as you did me.  And to see about her wounds.”<br>
<br>
Saphron nodded, smiling ruefully.  “See an enchanter for some extra charisma on yer way over.  Yer not as young as you used to be.  Maybe you ought to say yer awaiting yer wealthy husband.”  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=athene>Athene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/_uimages/ahstarsm.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/18/03 8:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#141419><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=saphronlafeete>Saphron LaFeete</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/18/03 9:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> Saphron closed and locked the door behind Athene. She had never cared to be closed in by stone walls, and she had never really cared much for ShadowHaven, either.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great,&quot; she muttered to herself, &quot;the best of both worlds.&quot;<br>
<br>
Saphron sat down on the bed and thumbed through her spellbook. She would need her best, damageless stuns for the encounter with Stormygale. She was obviously not herself, and would need to be subdued somewhat if they were going to even talk with her. <br>
<br>
Perhaps she could be pacified as well. Saphron giggled.<br>
<br>
Staring at a picture hung awkwardly on the wall. The scene, the lost inn located in the Commonlands, reminded Saphron of a time long ago when she and Stormygale had been bitter rivals. The quarrel? A man . . . an erudite man, no less. Pffft! Saphron rolled her eyes in spite of herself.<br>
<br>
She remembered a certain, quite humorous instance, in which she had been sitting at the easternmost orc encampent with some young adventurers, watching over them as they exterminated the foul creatures. Stormygale had come up behind her and tried to pick a fight. That girl was so young then. Saphron had continuously feared her after accepting the foolish girl's  challenge to a duel. Stormy kept running back, and Saphron had kept fearing the girl. Oh what a sight!<br>
<br>
Saphron smiled once more, but the smile quickly faded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stormy, what's wrong with you?&quot; she asked the picture on the wall, straightening its precarious perch, &quot;Why are you doing this? What kind of pain torments you so?&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:gold;font-family:Garamond;font-size:medium;">Saphron LaFeete</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:garamond;font-size:small;">High Priestess of Bristlebane </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212128><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stormygalewindrunner>Stormygale Windrunner</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 859<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/18/03 2:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> Stormygale moaned. The pain, oh god the pain. She writhed on the bed. Nothing was helping anymore. Not even the brandy. She was in a full sweat and yet managed to sit bolt upright. She must move, and she must move now.<br>
<br>
The hunters were coming. Tears streaming down her face, grimmacing in horrible pain that almost buckled her legs, she slowly stowed her gear. <br>
<br>
She'd have to be wiley this time. She had no idea what Saphron wanted with her. They were not friends as they once had been. Even after the initial hatred, they had become close, but then it had all fallen apart when Natural Seletion had blown apart. Everyone had dissapeared, going thier own ways and leaving bitter resentment as the last dregs of a dying guild.  And she'd had to find a new way in a now cruel world. A way all her own, all by her self. She owed these people nothing and resented their intrusion beyond what was rational.<br>
<br>
She finally knew where to go though. They wouldn't find her there. By Tunare they would not. There were no tell-tale runters to tip a person off, and while the passes might be watched, she'd not go that route. <br>
<br>
No, though it cost her in every stride, she'd get her mount out of the stables. Doom was faster than all but elder bards. She'd outrun them on a goose chase and then go hole up. Into a hole they could no longer go.<br>
<br>
After all, who in their right mind would look for her where all others now feared to tread?  She had not taken that path, and the drink the dragons of Skyshrine brew might just do the trick. Hopefully, after she teleported into an obvious spot, say.... North Karana, the runter spy would report in, and as they develpted a plan, she'd port to Wakening lands. The Giants wouldn't see her and the Dragons would save her from her hunters. <br>
<br>
She had been wize to keep that faction.  While there was no &quot;inn&quot; persay, there were plenty of merchants and clean empty rooms to hole up in. She'd be safe for a goodly while there. <br>
<br>
But first to be obvious, and to thank the brothers downstairs.<br>
<br>
Her packs slung, she tread her way down the stairs to say goodbye to the very nice men, and stopped dead. She'd been right. There was Athene! Of all people, she would be the most difficult to elude.  She waved from the stairs and began casting her spell of North Karana. By the time Athene turned, all in her fancy red dress, all she saw was Stormygale disappearing into the mist of an unknown potal spell, waving  with as close to a smile her gimace would alow, as she did so. <p><b>Stormygale El`Orian</b><img border=0 src="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" /></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showMessageRange?topicID=142.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showMessageRange?topicID=142.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showMessageRange?topicID=142.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showMessageRange?topicID=142.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showMessageRange?topicID=142.topic&start=101&stop=119>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showPrevMessage?topicID=142.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showNextMessage?topicID=142.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.clawofnagafen.com/boards/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.emailToFriend?topicID=142.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.threadControl?topicID=142.topic><img src=http://www.clawofnagafen.com/boards/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=142.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=142.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub148.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thewordsofnagafentherunningcharterdiscussion">Charter<option value="thewordsofnagafengeneralmembersforum">General Discussion<option value="thewordsofnagafennewrecruits">New Recruits<option value="thewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics">The Claw Tavern<option value="thewordsofnagafenmemberlist">Member List<option value="thewordsofnagafenfrm20">Good Deeds<option value="thewordsofnagafenimportantcurrentinformation">Important Current Information<option value="thewordsofnagafenmembersonlygeneraldiscussion">Members Only General Discussion<option value="thewordsofnagafenguildevents">Guild Events<option value="thewordsofnagafenfrm30">PoP Flags<option value="thewordsofnagafentheclawvaultitemsupforgrabs">The Claw Vault<option value="thewordsofnagafenguildautobiographies">Claw Ranks<option value="thewordsofnagafenbookofknowledge">Book of Knowledge<option value="thewordsofnagafenquestsspecialitems">Quests & Special Items<option value="thewordsofnagafentactics">Strategy<option value="thewordsofnagafenskills">Skills<option value="thewordsofnagafenguildmemberreallifephotos">Guild Member Real Life Photos<option value="thewordsofnagafenfrm28">DAoC and Other Online Games<option value="thewordsofnagafenfrm29">13<option value="thewordsofnagafenfrm31">Raid Coordination<option value="thewordsofnagafenofficersoffice">Officers Office<option value="thewordsofnagafenofficerspersonalcontactinfo">Officers Contact Info<option value="thewordsofnagafenfrm26">Officers Archives<option value="thewordsofnagafenfrm27">Recruit Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#7A8798>- </font><a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen>The Words of Nagafen</a><font color=#7A8798> -
