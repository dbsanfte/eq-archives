class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> Rhavin muttered to himself as he tapped out his pipe over a rock near where he sat fishing in the Qeynos Hills. It was clear that he wasn't going to get any relaxing done with all this racket about Stormygale passing through his head. He had known Stormy had been depressed lately, what with her injury and all, but hadn't realized the toll it had taken on her until now. The guild was abuzz about it, and even though he had gone into retirement sometime ago, he was unable to shut out the chatter. He decided that the only way he was going to be able to make it stop was to find Stormy himself.<br>
<br>
After gathering up his gear he began the short walk to Qeynos where he could store his fishing tackle and gather the gear he wore back in his adventuring days. But first, he thought to himself with a bit of a smirk, I will check on my good friend Holly Windstalker...that contemptible shrew of a ranger had given him a fair number of bumps and bruises when he was just a lad growing up in the hills. Now he reviled in killing bears with her around, daring her to stop him.<br>
<br>
As he neared the path from Surefall Glade to Qeynos, lost in thought as he often was, he nearly met his bitter end, to of all things, a horse! He gave the rider a rude gesture and shouted &quot;Watch where you are going ya hippie!&quot; His words trailed off into a mutter when he realized who the rider was. The human druid with hair white as the Everfrost Peaks, and her horse, Doom if he recalled correctly. He also noted that she was somewhat transparent. She was invisible to the naked eye, but not his eyes, enhanced by his familiar they could see her clear as day. But her being invisible in the Hills was troubling. It meant she didn't want to be found and was taking precautions against being seen. He tried following her, but with her horse she easily outpaced him. She seemed to be heading towards the Karana's though.<br>
<br>
He ran the rest of the way to the bank in Qeynos. Once there he deposited his fishing tackle and began to pack up his gear. Everything was packed and readied except he couldn't seem to find his robe. He had passed his Mana Robe on after retiring, but he had kept the robe he had acquired during a visit by The Claw to The Hole to slay the vile Master Yael. The thing had been Loam Encrusted when he got it and it sorely needed....Now remembered where it was, he had left it for the maid to take to the laundry back at the guild house, nearly 3 months ago. Knowing that gnome maid it was probably still dirty as an ogre. He always suspected Merci of getting him a gnomish maid on purpose just to spite him. But now thinking of Merci made him grin. She always had the guild house decorated with odd little smiley faces in all shapes and sizes. He always figured that pipe she smoked and claimed was tabac was really something else entirely. He sighed and muttered &quot;Hippies...&quot;<br>
<br>
He arrived at the guild hall just before nightfall. Upon entering he found the places empty. They were almost surely raiding something tonight. The guild had grown far stronger since he left. And there were many new members that he had never...He finally noticed the walls, no longer were they covered with smiley faces, oh there were a few here and there, but now they were covered with. &quot;White boxes with red X's through them?&quot; he said out load. He didn't know which was more odd this or the smiley faces...No, this was defiantly weirder. Merci was nuts.<br>
<br>
He gave himself a shake and headed off for his apartments. They were just as he had left them, including his robe still slung over a chair and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> filthy! He cursed Merci over the gnomish maid once more and put on the robe. It may be filthy but it would do. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhavinsoulsbane@thewordsofnagafen>Rhavin Soulsbane</A> at: 7/23/03 12:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#141419><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stormygalewindrunner>Stormygale Windrunner</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 884<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/22/03 5:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> She stretched out her legs and tried to get untangled. She was in a full sweat, even with the mist of the waterfall to cool her. She knew she was coming to an end. This just couldn't go on any longer. She writhed in her bedding, the fire in her spine making her unable to sleep, eat, or drink. She'd drank all the brandy she'd had with her, and now was in agony.  She didn't know if she could move to try an get more.<br>
<br>
She slowly attempted to get untangled from her blanket, but it was useless. She couldn't do it without the world greying out on her from the pain.<br>
Her hands trembled uncontrolably. Probably from lack of drink.  She must be going through withdrawls.<br>
<br>
Finally she gave in, and with her thought going out into the either, she tried to ask her guild for help.  Then she tried to ask Saphron and Athene, but she didn't know if anyone had heard her. &quot;Help me, please....someone....anyone,&quot;<br>
<br>
Her words were garbled with pain and agony.  She couldn't remember if she'd told them where she was or not, but she couldn't try again. It had taken everything out of her to ask.  Her eyes finally rolled up in her head and she gave up and passed out.  <p><b>Stormygale El`Orian</b><img border=0 src="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" /></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stormygalewindrunner>Stormygale Windrunner</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/22/03 5:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212128><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zyphindalcohol>Zyphin Dalcohol</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 1834<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/22/03 7:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> Slowly Zyphin unfolded the map he had so diligently created, pondering over the slim clues that he had aquired.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Let see silk? There are way to many places in this world to get silk, I should know I have hunted most of them.  But the second clue waterfalls should limit it a bunch.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking over his map he located the waterfalls that he could remember.<br>
<br>
 &quot;The Great Divide has a wonderful waterfall.. Too bad those mindless zombies no longer like me.  Hmm.. there are a few spiders in the mines of Thurgadin.&quot; Zyphin pondered on this for a bit. &quot;I will have to check this one last no need to get the dorfs in a frenzy if  I do not need too.&quot;<br>
<br>
Continuing his search of the map he remembers that spider infested nest in East Karana. &quot;Oh it could not be so simple.&quot;  Tapping the map a few times he figures what the heck and decides to head off to the Karanas to test his luck.  So packing up his meager supplies off he goes in a puff of smoke.<br>
<br>
Arriving at the familiar rings in North Karana, Zyphin notices it is a buzz with young halfings, but decides that his task is too important to mess with the younglings at this time cast Spirit of Eagle and then Improved Superior Camoflage and runs off to the east in search of the goal he hopes to find.<br>
<br>
As he crosses the wooden bridge in to the East Karanas he is stuck by the thought that this place has never seamed so empty.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah how I hated this place with all those darn spiders.&quot; Many months had Zyphin hunting these haunts in search of the spider silks that would then be used in his tailoring projects.  <br>
<br>
As he mussed over his past he saw on the horizon the familiar sights of some barbarian fishing huts and in the background the all too familiar sight of a waterfall. The as if a faint whisper he hears in his mind &quot;Help me, please....someone....anyone,&quot; could it be possible that he has found his goal?  Zyphin quickened his pace even at the expense of the fatigue that he was sure would pain him in the morning.<br>
<br>

Hmm that name did not ring any bells for Zyphin, but somehow the face of this female was not unfamiliar to him.  Where have I seen her before?  She is in much pain if she thinks her only way out is death, and it was not from the reek of bad alcohol.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good lord woman what swill have you been drinking?&quot; he mutters to himself. &quot;But the first step here is to releave you of some of this pain you seam to be suffering. Very close to death are you now it looks I will not speed you on your way.  But by Karana himself if you fight me young lady I will lay you low.&quot; Zyphin says with a slight grin.<br>
<br>
Reaching for his spell book he starts to memorize the one spell he believes will help in this situation, Tunare's Renewal, always with one eye on his restless patient.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm before I cast this I must ensure that she will not run off in midcast&quot;  So Zyphin reaches into his Leatherfoot Haversack and pulls out one of his own Elven Brandy, &quot;Elven Brandy indead everyone knows halflings make the best alcohol!&quot; Then looks deeper for the herb his sly friend shown him.  &quot;Just a pinch should keep your 'victim' err patient sleeping while you administer to him&quot;.  Slowly he mixed the Brandy and the herb together, the easy part was done now for the difficult part.<br>

Slightly shaking the young lady Zyphin says &quot;Miss..Miss..

The pain had eased a bit and she realized she was not alone. That hadn't been a dream. The runter was still here. She smelled his leather. He was shaking her and talking to her,  &quot;Miss..Miss.. Here you need some of this.&quot;  She smelled the brandy. She craved it like water, but she kept herself still and loose as an unconscious person would. He shook her again.<br>
<br>
She kept her eyes to the barest of slits as she peeked at him. Pretending to still be out cold. Ah!  She knew this runter! And not only that, he was a guildmate! Oh what to do... what to do. She couldn't hurt a guildmate!<br>
<br>
She considered her options... not many. There was only one thing to do. <br>
<br>
Slowly, acting groggy and bewildered she sat up. Her back flamed and she almost went out again as the world started to grey out around her, but she forced herself back by sheer strength of will. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wha...&quot; she said, then with all her concentration cast her most powerful stun and watched as the force of the wind flopped the runter onto his back, eyes open and unable to move. <br>
<br>
She tried to quickly gather her things, but gave up and grabbed her packs, leaving her bedroll behind. She lept from the hut into the water and almost drowned as she sunk to the bottom. But as she did so, she summoned Doom, and with him under her, she burst from the water at a flat gallop, gasping for air and in so much pain she almost fell off.<br>
<br>
She heard swearing behind her as she ran on, and then she almost ran over someone who screamed &quot;HIPPIE&quot; at her, as she tried to memorized the only spell she could think of, and then paused to cast it. Leaving a swearing runter coming at her at speed, but he was too late. The two second head start and a fast horse was all she needed. <br>
<br>
She landed with a thump, setting off a huge excitement amongst the runters set to watch the hill. But Stormygale was unaware of it.<br>
<br>
Slowly Doom walked on through the woods, trailing a runter or two as he made his way on his own to the only place he knew to go. His mistress was unconscious and out cold.  And he could sense she needed help.<br>
<br>
Stepping as carefully as he could, desperately trying not to jog her or let her slip off, he made his way to the great grand tree in the middle of the wood. He'd been here before many a time and knew his rider concidered this another home. It was closer than her real home, so it would have to do. <br>
<br>
He reached the glade and let loose a mighty neigh. Then stepping carefully to the door he began pounding on it with a shod hoof. <p><b>Stormygale El`Orian</b><img border=0 src="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" /></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stormygalewindrunner>Stormygale Windrunner</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/23/03 1:32 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212128><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhavinsoulsbane@thewordsofnagafen>Rhavin Soulsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 876<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/23/03 12:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> After equipping his robe Rhavin sat and began memorizing the incantations that would take him to the Western Karana's. The last he had seen Stormy she was speeding off that way so that is where his search would begin. Reciting the incantation Rhavin disappeared into a flash of light. Seconds later he found himself on the large grey portal stone in the Western Karana's. And just his luck, it was raining. If there was anything in the world he hated more than Gnomes it was rain.<br>
<br>
Rhavin then quickly cast Abscond and found himself on the Qeynos side of the Karana's. From there he set himself to searching every inn, hut, and guard house, methodically moving back to the east. The Karana's were huge, and it took him nearly an hour to check even the relatively few houses in the area. He then began heading for the gypsies camp in the Northern Karana's. They had been known to give aid to wayward travelers from time to time.<br>
<br>
And then it happened. &quot;Tele mE, pbeyse....sameeny....snyqne,&quot; It was Stormygale. She was in a terrible amount of pain. And drunk too, judging by her slurred speech. She was to the east.<br>
<br>
Rhavin ran, sprinted, his lungs burnt and his side ached but he knew where Stormy was now, she was no longer hiding herself. Crossing the huge wooden bridge into the Eastern Karana's he turned south along the river. As he ran he noticed he was being followed. A pair of gnolls had spotted him and were now trailing him. While they presented no danger to himself he didn't know what condition he would find Stormy in and didn't want to bring them near her. Rhavin turned and quickly cast two spells. After each spell was finished a gnoll erupted in flames as if consumed by the sun.<br>
<br>
Turning to continue after Stormy he had but a second to dive out of the way of an on-coming horse and rider. That was the second time the fool girl had nearly run him down. &quot;@#$@# Hippies&quot; he yelled. Where was that damned girl going now! As he pushed himself to his feet a peck druid sprinted past him after the girl. He quickly fell in behind the peck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#141419><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=athene>Athene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/_uimages/ahstarsm.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/23/03 2:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=48>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/eye.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Help me, please....someone....anyone</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Athene was so startled, she nearly dropped the picture of Stormygale she held loosely in one hand.  Both hands now shaking, she returned the portrait to the bedside table and tried to think logically.  She had to think <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">clearly</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  She had to act.  From where had Stormygale spoken?  Athene’s blood ran ice cold.  She had never known Stormygale to cry out in such a way.  Had she heard her ask for help—ever?  Maybe when her mother was ill, but the request had not been such as this.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Where, Stormy?  Where?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The wind brought nothing more.<br>
<br>
Athene pulled herself up, unsteady on her feet.  I’ll got to get a grip on myself or I will be useless.  Consciously affecting a confident stride, she left Abruzi’s room and made her way to the kitchen.  She needed to leave, and she needed to act.  But where should she go?  Had she only been able to reach Stormygale because of some magic in the tree that bound them still?  Or was it simply that Stormygale had reached her end?  Athene had no idea, but remained where she was.  She had urged Stormygale to return to this place.  If Stormygale had heard, was she in a position to take action?  Athene had earlier sent a similar mind link out to Saphron as well—Saphron who had not answered.  A new worry.<br>
<br>
One day, I will know if I acted for good or nil, she said to herself.  Quickly, she set about making a fire in the main hall and in the kitchen.  She found blankets and set them by the fire to absorb its warmth.  She got no further when a sharp message stabbed into her mind.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kill me, please...please!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Athene began to pace.  Then she returned to action.  She hung a pot over the fire in the main hall, and from her packs she brought forth some rabbit meat and foraged vegetables and began to make a stew.<br>
<br>
A pounding on the door terrified her.  She was more skittish than she could remember being.  Steeling her nerves, she made for the door and swung it open.  Stormygale lay slumped on the ground.  The air around her shimmered and evanesced.  Some summoned creature had returned to an astral plane.  <br>

The message came to her clear as crystal. Stormygale!<br>
<br>
Bones aching, Saphron gathered her things, sure to keep the medicine bag Tondar had given her closest to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kalyndria, have you the mana to port?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kalyndria nodded, a bit surprised at the sudden activity by the injured halfling. <br>
<br>
&quot;Good, we have to get to the Tree.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Please port me to Misty Thicket. Willow will take me the rest of the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Confused, the druid memorized the port spell. In an instant, the two materialized on the hill.<br>
<br>
Willow was there waiting for Saphron. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, you knew I was coming, did you? This wouldn't have anything to do with that stallion in the next stable would it?&quot; Saphron smiled at the welcoming muzzle of her mount.<br>
<br>
&quot;Saphron, where are you going?&quot; called Kalyndria. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am heading for the great Tree - the guild hall of Natural Selection. Follow if you wish, but I must hurry! I fear Stormygale's life depends on it.&quot;<br>
<br>
And, with that, she was off. Willow sped through the trees like lightning. As they came upon the glade, she saw Athene huddled over a crumpled figure at the door.<br>

<br>
Zyphin takes off in persuit of the ingured human.  &quot;as long as she does not port I should be able to track her&quot; he thinks.  And quickly sets of too follow. Off in the distance he can see the horse she is riding, its speed will out distance him but he can still track her and the horse will have to stop sooner or later.<br>

Zyphin watches as the horse almost runs over an Erudite that was comming towards her. He yells &quot;&quot;@#$@# Hippies&quot; as he dodges the horse.  Zyphin chuckles to himself as he realizes who this erudite happens to be. But having little time to chat with his old guildmate he continues on his pursuit.  <br>
<br>
It becomes soon apparent that Rhavin is also persuing this fleet footed human so he slows. &quot;Rhavin, If you want to keep up with me you are going to need some help.&quot;  With that Zyphin begans to cast Spirit of Eagle on his friend. &quot;Come, We must not let her get two far ahead.&quot; And off he runs..  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212128><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=athene>Athene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/_uimages/ahstarsm.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/23/03 3:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=51>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/eye.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> Together, Saphron and Athene pulled Stormygale inside.  They tried to be careful, limiting their movement of her limbs.  Saphron cradled Stormygale’s head and shoulders in her arms and very, very slowly they brought her near the fireside where Athene had placed thick blankets to warm.  Gently, they lifted her atop and began to ease her out of her stinking leathers.  “Too much alcohol,” said Saphron.<br>
<br>
“Aye, it may have helped to ease her pain at first, but now it poisons her.  Still, she’ll need to be weaned off it, I think.  Else more a shock to her system.”<br>
<br>
Saphron nodded and began her examination of Stormygale’s body while she still slept fitfully.  There were scratches and bruises in various places.  Whether the result of her journey or the usual falls that a drunk may take was not clear, and Saphron did not suppose it mattered.  She patted the medicine bag Tondar had given her and continued her examination.  Stormygale’s lower back was hot to the touch.  Here there was deep, intense pain.  Saphron pressed her palms flat on Stormygale’s back and recited words of replenishment.  It was a temporary measure to relieve the pain by drawing it out.  The cause of the pain would still have to be addressed.  From her cursory examination, Saphron guessed that the discs of Stormygale’s spine had been torn out of alignment and had healed over but had not been re-aligned.  Thus, the pain had actually gotten more and more intense as she had seemingly recovered.  It was likely that as she had regained strength and attempted to return to her usual routine, sudden, simple movements had caused wrenching pain.  And the drink had probably not helped.  Numbing herself with alcohol, Stormygale had likely increased her tolerance for the pain that should have kept her immobile and seeking a competent healer.  Saphron sighed.  She would get that help now.<br>
<br>
Athene returned from the kitchen where she had gone to fetch hot water and towels as Saphron began to minister to her patient.  Together that cleaned the cuts and abrasions and washed Stormygale as free of the grime that covered her as they could--without waking her or moving her unnecessarily.<br>
<br>
The stew bubbled on the fire, and Athene fetched bowls and utensils from the kitchen for herself and Saphron.  They would try to get Stormygale to eat when she awoke.  <br>
<br>
“We can keep the pain at bay tonight so that she may rest and we can talk to her,” said Saphron.<br>
<br>
Athene nodded and cast the Blessings of Replenishment on the three of them. “It is likely going to be a long night, but let us hope the worst is over.”  <br>

Squinting his eyes till his pupils adjust to the bright light from the sun. He scans his surroundings carefully, but quickly. <br>
<br>
“Nothing, but a wasteland of a half dead forest constantly being put to the test by the 3 factions that be always battling, and fighting thru this wasteland. A once beautiful forest filled with bright neon green leaves, grass, and brush turned into nothing more than a battlefield”, Revil sneers.<br>
<br>
The giants, puppets of Rallos Zek to help him fight the dragon horde that have been the long driving force in Norrath. The giants have no respect for their surroundings, but more of their goals to drive the dragon horde out of existence. Revil has no respect for the giant’s goals, but had no remorse tricking them into thinking he believed in their cause. Revil slowly looks at his pieces of rugged chain mail armor the giants made for him during his service.<br>
<br>
Dragonkin, the spawn of Veeshan. Keepers of the land that kept balance between the gods, and mortals of Norrath. Constantly being tested from all fronts by mortals for their nice loot they keep stashed for themselves, and by the gods to take them out of existence to have more power over Norrath as a whole. They are weary of any travelers who try to prove themselves, as they should be. <br>
<br>
Revil slowly gazes at the pieces of armor the dragonkin have made for him. Finely made chain mail almost as beautiful as mithril, and as strong as dragon scales. Revil chuckles as he turned on the dragons after he used them for personal gain, and manipulated them like puppets on a short string.<br>
<br>
The Tunarean Court. Followers, and leading force for the God of Nature, Tunare. Constantly battling the giants for their lack of care for the forest. That is the only Knowledge Revil took the time to research on the court seeing as he has no use for what the nature guardians could give him for his skills.<br>
<br>
Revil gathers himself, and makes his way across the wasteland to the home of the giants, Keal Drakkal. He can take a quick rest while restocking on supplies for the long journey ahead of him. As Revil sneaks across the wasteland he feels a slight glow of heat coming from his ankle pack. He stops dead in his tracks, frozen into a cautious pose scanning his surrounds for trouble before he slowly kneels down, and opens up his ankle pack.<br>
<br>
The glow is coming from the locket he got from that human girl. He slowly pulls the locket out to examine it for any changes. He feels around the back where the engraving of words are, and feels them slowly changing. A bit frightened, Revil drops the locket on the ground.<br>
<br>
“What type of witch craft is this nonsense”, as Revil watches the locket roll, and slide slightly down the hill.<br>
<br>
The glowing of the locket gets brighter, and brighter. Revil quickly rushes to pick it up so it doesn’t attract any unwanted lurkers. After picking up the locket, he put the locket back into his ankle pack, and makes great haste to Keal Drakkal where he can examine the locket better in more peace of mind, and figure out why this locket is glowing.<br>

She awoke to that thought and did not move. She wondered, had she died? Was if finally over and that was why she didn't hurt? Ahhh, but she was hungry. So this was a dream? It must be because she still didn't hurt. But her hands, she realized, were shaking like leaves in the wind. This was no dream. Then why didn't she hurt?<br>
<br>
Stormygale opened her eyes and saw the flickerings of a fire burning on a hearth, and felt the warmth of it on her side.  She knew that hearth though. She'd known that hearth for more years than she could count. The smells and feelings of home invaded her and she was more than comfortable.  &quot;Mom?&quot; she asked, and fully expected her mother to be bustling somewhere near, but then reality set in as two sets of hands gently, yet firmly held her down, and the crush of her loss of her mother let them. What did it matter now?<br>
<br>
She turned her head to find Athene and Saphron hovering over her, looking apprehensive as if she were going to bolt again. She relaxed. She was too tired and too comfortalbe to move. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hello you two. So you caught me at last, eh? Well, I'm too tired to move. Have you got anything to eat and maybe a bit of my mother's brandy about?

The stew would need to be scooped up and served hot.  She’d see about that later.  Alcohol was Stormygale’s most pressing need, and neither she nor Saphron felt their friend needed to eschew the stuff.  She’s never had a problem with it before this injury and this depression.  Not that Stormygale couldn’t slam back a significant amount of the good stuff.  She could and could keep up with the best of them, but the craving had come with the pain.<br>
<br>
Athene came forward with a glass, filled to three quarters.  “Apricot cooler.  Not as strong as what you’re gotten used to, but a good drink nonetheless—apricot brandy, lemon, lime, grenadine, sugar, and club soda.  It should help take the edge off.”  <br>
<br>
Stormygale seemed grateful or in some strange state of peace.  She didn’t protest as Athene set the glass on a table and Athene and Saphron began to help her first into a simple shift and then into a low chair by the fire.  Saphron insisted that Stormygale sit up straight while she placed pillows strategically around her to support her.  Seeming satisfied, Saphron stood back and surveyed her patient.  “Yer lookin’ better, but yer not well.  I can help stave off the pain, but the underlying causes are still there, and we’re going to have to deal with them.”  Saphron motioned for Athene to pass Stormygale her drink.<br>
<br>
Stormygale took it and sipped.  It was good.  She wondered briefly if she were under some sort of spell, for she didn’t have the slightest urge to defy Saphron.  Usually, just the sight of the halfling cleric, so serious, hands on hips, would have brought out a bit of devilment from Stormygale, but she was feeling too comfortable to muster a display of fire, so she simply nodded her agreement.  Her primary concern at the moment was her hands, which continued to shake.  Athene took the glass and set it on the small table that had been pulled close.  “That will pass soon, I think.  Probably as much a lack of wholesome food as too much drink.”<br>
<br>
As if on cue, Saphron turned to the pot bubbling over the fire and began to ladle out a small portion of stew into a stoneware bowl.  She set it down carefully on the small table and said, “It’s hot.  Finish your drink first and let it cool.  Athene, be a bringing over some fresh water as well please.”<br>
<br>
Athene left for the kitchen and brought back a pitcher of fresh rain water the guild collected in a cistern out back near a shady copse of trees.  In former days, the guild’s dark elves, ogres, and trolls had favored this approach to the hall. <br>
<br>
When Athene returned, she found Saphron now seated in a chair across from Stormygale speaking gently.  “I think I know something of the cause of the pain in your lower back.  When you’re feeling a bit better and can stand a more thorough examination, we’ll know more.”  Saphron paused and continued.  Stormygale, whose hands now only revealed slight tremors, reached for her bowl of stew and began to eat very slowly.<br>
<br>
Saphron continued.  “Now, I don’t want you to be thinking I believe you too weak to stand the pain, Stormy, I don’t, but there’s nothing to be gained by aggravating the injury further and needlessly.”<br>
<br>
Stormygale listened.<br>
<br>
Athene poured three glasses of rain water.  She placed one within Stormygale’s reach and handed another to Saphron.  Athene drank her own in one swift draught and then sat on the floor near the cooling fire to listen to Saphron’s counsel.  “Your guild is worried.  Several search for you.  Athene has prepared a letter for delivery to Quaras, which will explain the current situation.  We have already sent  a message through the ether that you have been found.  I don’t know how long that news will take to reach all who search for you.  Athene and I think it’s best you continue your recuperation here.  It may be necessary, Stormygale, to reopen the wound in your back.  It could be that we will need to, in effect, re-break it.”  <br>
<br>
Stormygale took in this news without speaking.  Neither Saphron nor Athene could judge how she felt about such a possibility.  They had all suffered their share of injuries.  If this action led to a more complete recovery, it was likely Stormygale would accept it stoically.  The powers of Norrath’s clerics were limited somewhat.  Not every injury could be made completely whole.  Afflictions of the blood—diseases, poisons, most curses—could usually be cured.  The effects of these things and severe injury and age could not always be.  Athene, herself, had suffered years of residual pain from a stab wound to the back when Konaku had attacked her in the pass from South Karana to Lake Rathetear.  They had all seen men and women who had lost an eye or become blinded from their life’s adventures.<br>
<br>
Saphron set her glass on the floor.  “When you’re ready again for travel, Stormygale, you can make the journey home to the Claw.&quot;<br>

She couldn't remember the last time she'd eaten more than a bit of bread or a piece of Jerky. <br>
<br>
&quot;That was very good. Thank you.&quot; she said quietly and sincerely, then with her elbows on the table she put her chin in her still slightly trembling hands, and looked at the two women who were still aprehensively looking back at her. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's alright. I won't bolt again. You can relax.&quot; They didn't seem inclined to, though. Well that was understandable. She'd become very good at eluding these two, and others besides. <br>
<br>
&quot;If you don't mind me asking Stormygale, why are you being so docile? The last time one of us had you, you layed everyone on their backs, flat in the dust.&quot; Athene tried to surpress a giggle as she glanced at Saphron, who had a rather indignant look on her face. <br>
<br>
&quot;Athene, for the first time in almost a year, I am not in screaming pain. I don't know what you've done to stave it off, but you've given me hope. It was more than I could bare anymore,&quot; she covered her eyes as she began to cry. &quot;I just wanted to die, it was so bad.&quot; And she began so sob. Huge racking sobs that left her gasping for breath. &quot;I, I...saw a shaman after the injury... He said my back was broken... and either it would heal or it would not. There was nothing to be done... It got so bad...I just wanted to die,&quot; she sniffled and wiped the tears on the sleeve of her shift.  &quot;I didn't want to be a cripple, a burden on my guild, a burden to my friends. I just wanted to be left alone... to find the courage.... to kill myself, but I could just never quite do it. I kept looking at my locket and my mother's eyes would look at me as if to say, &quot;No daughter. You must not do this thing.&quot; <br>
<br>
She fumbled for her locket and found a nasty surprise. It was gone! <br>
<br>
&quot;Where is it? Where is my locket?! Oh no. It's lost! I've lost it...&quot; and she began to cry again. &quot;My locket... &quot; she laid her head on the table on her crossed arms. &quot;My locket...&quot; she was so tired. She wiped her running nose on the hankie Saphron gave her. Saphron's eyes met Athene's concerned eyes over Stormygale's unknowing head. A message passed between them. <br>
<br>
Saphron went into the kitchen and came out with another glass of water.  &quot;Here Stormy, drink. It will calm you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Her hands still trembling some, she took the water and drank. Then Saphron and Athene gently helped her back to her place by the fire and watched as the drugged water took effect and Stormygale fell asleep, still mumbling about her locket. <br>
<br>
&quot;You were right Athene,&quot; Saphron said quietly. &quot;There is more than just physical pain here.&quot; We have much to do. <br>
<br>
Athene, looking down with pity shining in her eyes and replied &quot;Yes. We'd best be careful though. One wrong step and she'll suicide.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then we'll just have to do it right, eh?&quot; Saphron winked and her friend and they smiled. <br>

Minutes past into hours as the night progressed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll watch her, Athene. Get some rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
They would worry about the locket later. For now, Saphron wanted to get a good look at Stormy's back. And now, while she was asleep, was the best time.<br>
<br>
Saphron was all business as she examined Stormygale's back. Laying both hands on the bare flesh, she winced in pain as her clerical senses fused with Stormygale's. She concentrated deeper, trying to feel the pain with Stormygale, trying to sense the exact origin of the inflammation. As she moved her sensitive fingers over the maligned disc, Saphron grimaced terribly and fell to her knees, the wind knocked out of her completely.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatsa matter, Runter?&quot; Stormygale chided softly, &quot;Too much for ya?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go back to sleep, whelp, &quot;Saphron flashed Stormygale a knowing smile and, getting to her feet, reached for the medicine bag that Tondar had given her, &quot;That's the second time this week you've knocked me down.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two women, once bitter rivals, shared a short lived smile. <br>
<br>
&quot;Stormygale, I don't know how you've been conscious through this pain, let alone riding and running. You are truly a remarkable girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
Saphron looked her friend squarely in the eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;And, I've missed you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Saphron?&quot; Stormygale inquired, &quot;Where is your guild badge?&quot;<br>
<br>
The cleric spoke quietly as she diligently prepared the medicine pack, &quot;I've left the Knights, Stormy. You know? I've felt so empty inside of late, and I think I am starting to realize why. I thought that with you joining the Claw, and with Athene doing that whole marriage thing and joining the Ring of Valor, and the others doing who knows what . . . well, I felt that I needed to find a new home quickly as well. Well, HOGWASH!&quot;<br>
<br>
Stormygale snickered in spite of the pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't get me wrong, Girl, they were good people and a good guild, but they just weren't . . . family.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, this might burn a bit. I'm no expert with shamanistic medicine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;GAH!&quot; Stormygale cried out as the medicine bag was placed on her lower back.<br>
<br>
&quot;OK, it's really gonna hurt,&quot; Saphron smiled at Stormy, &quot;But it's going to help. Tondar promised.&quot;<br>
<br>
The warm, wet pack on Stormygale's back began to smoulder and glow with healing properties. Shamen really were amazing.<br>
<br>
Saphron began to massage the area around the pack, as Tondar had explained, and she felt bones cracking beneath her fingers. There was no response from Stormygale, who was apparently too concerned with the burning sensation to realize her muscles were being manipulated so that her bones were being realigned.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you doing back there? Barbecuing me?!?&quot; Stormygale hissed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stormy, I have no idea how, but I think this is working.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:gold;font-family:Garamond;font-size:medium;">Saphron LaFeete</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:garamond;font-size:small;">High Priestess of Bristlebane </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=saphronlafeete>Saphron LaFeete</A> at: 7/24/03 11:10 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#141419><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stormygalewindrunner>Stormygale Windrunner</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 899<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/24/03 11:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> &quot;You know what, my friend? I think you're right.&quot; Stormygale gasped slowly, trying to remember to breathe. But the pain was no worse than the what she'd originally experienced, and had endured this last year so she could bear it. <br>
<br>
&quot;If your so dumb to join a guild who dosen't love you, then you deserve what you get.&quot; Stormgale bit off a yell as Saphron gave her a pinch. &quot;Ok ok. I'll shut up. But you should have joined The Claw of Nagafen with me. You and you too, Athene. It's like Natural Selection was, only better.&quot; Stormygale let out a yelp. &quot;Quit pinching me woman, or I'll blow you off your feet again!&quot; She clenched her teeth as the burning continued. <br>
<br>
&quot;But I'm serious. Join Quaras and me in The Claw. Better people you will not find. They are my family now, and I love them. Just consider it, ok?&quot; Stormygale believed they would love the Claw of Nagafen, and the talking helped keep her mind off the growing waves of fire in her back.<br>
<br>
Athene suddenly asked, &quot;What are they like?&quot; And Stormygale smiled to herself. She heard the real interest. She'd known these women for years upon years and could almost read their thoughts at will. <br>
<br>
&quot;They are honorable people, generous and kind. If you are accepted, you are family. It is not easy to garner entrance as they are very cautious who they allow into their hearts and home. But I love them, and they love me. Else they would not have hunted me also. Tell me, would either of your old guilds have cared so much for you?&quot; <br>
<br>
Stormygale watched them ponder that question and come up blank.  She had them. They just didn't know it yet. heh. <br>
<br>
God her back burned. She did not believe much in her Icy God, Tunare, but she sent a little prayer out to her anyway. Maybe at least she could cool the fire a bit?  <p><b>Stormygale El`Orian</b><img border=0 src="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" /></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stormygalewindrunner>Stormygale Windrunner</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon45.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/24/03 11:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212128><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub148.ezboard.com/bthewordsofnagafen.showUserPublicProfile?gid=athene>Athene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/_uimages/ahstarsm.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoN Member</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#7A8798>(7/24/03 11:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub148.ezboard.com/fthewordsofnagafenmuirlansweeklypics.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=59>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~abvogan/eye.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fraud</span><hr size=1> At that moment, there came a light rap on the door.  Athene made eye contact with Saphron and stood.  “I’ll see what that is about.”  She smoothed her hair down, running her hands down the single braid of hair.  She’d been up all night.  She figured she must look a bit haggard.<br>
<br>
She crossed quickly to the door and opened it.  On the threshold a lovely wood-elf druid stood.  She was well-dressed and wore the insignia of The Claw of Nagafen, Stormygale’s guild.  <br>
<br>
“Please enter,” Athene said.  “I think the one you seek is here.”  She stepped back and made a wide motion with her arm toward the large open room.  “Welcome to the guild hall of Natural Selection.  It’s really more of a retreat now, but it was my home for a long while and you are welcome.  My name is Athene.”  <br>
<br>
The young woman—a druid judging from her armor and the Nature Walker’s scimitar she carried—stepped in confidently.  She had never been down the paths that had taken her here; and now, knowing that she had found her quarry, she was intensely curious about this place.  “I’m Kalyndria of the Claw of Nagafen.  Thank you.  How is Stormygale?”<br>
<br>
“Come in, and see for yourself.  She’s much the worse for wear and pain.  Saphron is tending to her.  She’s a cleric.”<br>
<br>
Kalyndria brighted.  “Yes, I know Saphron.  We came here together—sort of.  I lost sight of her.  Fast pony.”<br>
<br>
Together the two women walked toward the fire where Saphron still hovered over Stormygale.<br>

I'm trying to convince these two old friends to join The Claw. If nothing else, they'd work well in the torture chambers!&quot; she yelped as Saphron pinched her again.<br>
