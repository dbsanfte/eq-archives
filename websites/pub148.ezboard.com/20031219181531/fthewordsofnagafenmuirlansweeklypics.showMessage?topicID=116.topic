class=title>   Night of the living alive</span><hr size=1> A five minute skit I wrote.  Might someday evolve into a flash product or maybe a short live action.  The follow up to this would be The Zombies Hit Club 57.  But that's only if I get the film students interested in this project.  <br>

FADE IN<br>
<br>
INT. HAUNTED MANSION – NIGHT<br>
<br>
Five zombies stand in a decrepit room.  BENSON, FRANK, STEVE, LAZARUS, and MUTUMBO.  The oldest among them is Lazarus, also the most selfish.  Benson and Mutombo are intellectuals.  They have both lived for thousands of years and were raised together in Africa.  Steve and Frank died relatively recently.  Frank has lots of schooling, but lacks grace in speech.  They are very agitated.  Shotgun blasts echo through the house occasionally.  <br>
<br>
Steve shakes Lazarus by the shoulder.  He screams in his face.<br>
<br>
        STEVE<br>
The humans are almost here!  What are we going to do!  What the **** are we going to do!<br>
<br>
Frank slaps Steve across the face.<br>
<br>
        FRANK<br>
Blargh!<br>
<br>
        BENSON<br>
Frank’s right, this is no time to panic.  We need a plan.  <br>
<br>
        MUTUMBO<br>
Can’t we reason with them?  What if we can get them to understand that they are just victims of centuries of unjust propaganda against the living-impaired?<br>
<br>
        FRANK<br>
Blargh.<br>
<br>
Lazarus walks casually to the fireplace.  He does not seem concerned.  <br>
<br>
        STEVE<br>
I’m with Frank.  We got to take them before they take us.  I say we rain down from the ceiling like hell fire and rip them apart.<br>
<br>
        MUTUMBO<br>
That would only lead to further support these allegations against us.  Brothers, these are intelligent beings that we face.  We can find a way to end animosity if we work together.   <br>
<br>
        STEVE<br>
**** that Mutumbo.  Plato already tried that, and they blasted his head off with a shotgun.  <br>
<br>
        FRANK<br>
Blargh!<br>
<br>
        BENSON<br>
I think Plato took the wrong approach is all.  <br>
<br>
        STEVE<br>
Oh please, if the great philosopher can’t keep from getting capped then what chance do we have?  <br>
<br>
        BENSON<br>
If you had known him for more than two-hundred years you would have noticed his mind was slipping.<br>
<br>
        FRANK<br>
Blargh?<br>
<br>
        BENSON<br>
I did not want to say anything.  But it is of no matter now.  Last trip Plato took to Tijuana, he picked up a bad case of worms from a dead senorita.  They ate his brain over time.  <br>
<br>
Mutumbo looks to Lazarus.  Lazarus leans casually against the wall.  He sips sherry from a glass.  <br>
<br>
        MUTUMBO<br>
What say you, Lazarus?<br>
<br>
Lazarus swirls the sherry in his glass.<br>
<br>
        LAZARUS<br>
What care I for this matter?  Let them come.  Should they strike me down, I will only rise again as I have before.  <br>
<br>
        MUTUMBO<br>
You do not care for your brothers?  What about the deaths that will be permanent for us?<br>
<br>
        LAZARUS<br>
You?  I care not.  Do not seek my compassion when you shambling fools could not find it in yourselves to bother with me.  I never felt more alone than within these walls with all of you.<br>
<br>
        BENSON<br>
You are the one who locked yourself in.  We tried, and you pushed us away.  We assumed that you wished to be left alone.<br>
<br>
        FRANK<br>
Blargh.<br>
<br>
        LAZARUS<br>
Too little too late, Frank.  <br>
<br>
A blast in the hallway.  A woman’s voice screams.  Mutumbo goes pale.  He falls to his knees.<br>
<br>
        MUTUMBO<br>
Sarah!  They got Sarah!  Those bastards!  <br>
<br>
Benson clutches his friend’s shoulder.  Mutumbo sobs.  All except Lazarus lower their heads. <br>
<br>
        FRANK<br>
Blargh.<br>
<br>
Mutumbo wipes his tears with the back of his hand.  He stands up straight.  <br>
<br>
        MUTUMBO<br>
You’re right.  Now is not the time for mourning.  We need a plan now.  They are almost here.<br>
<br>
        BENSON<br>
But what?  If we charge them, they will kill us.  If we try to talk to them, they will kill us before we can say a single word.  <br>
<br>
        STEVE<br>
Could we hide?  Maybe they will think they killed us all and leave.<br>
<br>
        BENSON<br>
No, they would have heard Mutumbo’s scream.  They know someone is here.<br>
<br>
Frank scratches his head.  He looks up with a smile.<br>
<br>
        FRANK<br>
Blargh.<br>
<br>
        STEVE<br>
So what if they would only know of one person being here?  You aren’t suggesting we sacrificed Mutumbo are you?<br>
<br>
Frank looks shocked at the accusation.  He shakes his head and waves his hands.  <br>
<br>
        FRANK<br>
Blargh.<br>
<br>
Benson rubs his chin.  He smiles.  His eyes look to Lazarus.<br>
<br>
        BENSON<br>
I believe I see what you mean.<br>
<br>
The others follow his gaze.  Lazarus stands with his back to the group.  He examines a bottle of whiskey.  They look to each other and nod.  They rush Lazarus and grapple him.  Mutumbo kicks open the door. <br>
<br>
        LAZARUS<br>
What are you doing?  Stop this!<br>
<br>
        STEVE<br>
You said you would come back no matter what.  So thanks for taking one for the team, buddy. <br>
<br>
        MUTUMBO<br>
As the last of my kind, I will do whatever it takes to make your kind suffer!<br>
<br>
The others throw Lazarus through the door.  They listen to the sounds of him tumbling down stairs.  Several blasts erupt.  They stand deathly still.  After a moment, a door slams shut.  Outside, car engines start up.<br>
<br>
        BENSON<br>
It worked!  We did it!<br>
<br>
        MUTUMBO<br>
Outstanding.<br>
<br>
        STEVE<br>
Sweet.<br>
<br>
        FRANK<br>
Blargh.<br>
<br>
