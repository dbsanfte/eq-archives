           Hey all. This is Axhelm from the wonderful server of Torvonnilous. I will do a very well organized and fun lottery on June 28th in Kaladim at 8PM Eastern Standard Time supposedly near the castle(at least that’s where I want it to be). Hopefully I will be getting a few guilds involved such as Knights of Redemption, Tribe of Ancients, Alliance of Races, and even Blades of Wrath and Blood of Phoenix, plus a couple more to contribute prizes. I will be selling tickets every weekend in game for 2pp a ticket. For every 5 tickets you buy you get 1 ticket free (sorry if I am copying the other guy from down below on the page, hehe). I will be traveling all across the world even to Iceclad and parts of Kunark. I will be shouting hot keyed messages throughout the zone. I will only be in that zone for like 10 minutes unless I have to wait for people to come pay me. If you want to contact me to buy tickets while I am not on-line please e-mail me at Axhelm@hotmail.com. <br>
          Tickets will be sold all the way until 1 hour prior to the event. Times for ticket sales will be. (all times EST)<br>
          <br>
          ·	Every Friday to Sunday starting at 4:00PM Friday ending at 5:00 PM on Sunday (I can not sell during the week because I have school)<br>
          ·	I will not be selling on Memorial Day Weekend<br>
          ·	On June 9th and 10th I can’t play to much because of Exams<br>
          ·	Starting June 17th I will be able to go on everyday of the week so ticket sales will be VERY high past then so I also advise you to buy tickets ASAP<br>
          ·	During the weekdays ticket sales will be from 10:00 Am to 5:30PM<br>
           I advise you to please buy tickets before hand because ticket sales will be massive before the event and I may not be able to get to you. I do not know how much tickets I will be selling but as for the way of figuring out the winnings is as follows: (also the buy 5 get 1 free will not be on all the time J)<br>
            10,000 tickets are sold<br>
          -2,000 free tickets (could be less, this is just an example)<br>
            8,000 tickets (16,000pp estimate)<br>
          <br>
          15% goes to me which is 2,400pp leaving 13,600 left<br>
          75% goes to 1st place winner (10,200pp)<br>
          20% goes to 2nd place winner (2,720pp)<br>
          5% goes to 3rd place winner (680pp)<br>
          I will be doing the cash prizes first then I will be doing the item prizes according to value going from least to greatest. As I have done with my first lottery back on innorukk you do not have to be present to receive your prize. A guide friend of mind has volunteered to come just in case people are afraid of scamming. <br>
          The ticket ordering process will be as followed: I will be answering tells as the first person to tell me. Lets say I have sold 450 tickets and you are the next person in line. If you buy 10 tickets you will pay 20pp for your 10 tickets plus 2 free tickets. Therefore your ticket numbers will be numbers 451-462. I will be keeping track of peoples names and their numbers on my second computer but please remember them to save time if you win. As for the e-mailing, I will be checking e-mails every Tuesday and Thursday. If you e-mail me on Saturday and I don’t check it until Tuesday so the number you will get is the next number in the line instead of what it was back on Saturday when you e-mailed me. As for payment, your number is guaranteed when you e-mail me. Your name and numbers will be on my computer but with no check next to it (the check means that you have paid me the money). If your money is not paid within 24 hours of the event your numbers will be disqualified from the drawing. I will also keep track of the total money I have gotten so I won’t get so confused of this happening. Because of the risk of this happening I will only allow a maximum of 100 tickets being bought over e-mail total not including the amount of free tickets you got.<br>
          In game however you can as many tickets as you want at a time as long as the money is present. Also, you don’t have to buy all your tickets at one time. If you want a couple of numbers scattered through the total amount it is alright, but the free tickets are given only if you buy 5 tickets at one time, not an accumulated total (it would be to hard to keep track of).<br>
          If you don’t trust me then its your problem you are missing out on great fun. As I said their will be a guide and possibly a GM their and trust me they know if it is a scam (which it is for surely not one). If you have any questions please e-mail me at Axhelm@hotmail.com and I reply ASAP as soon as I finish with the amount of e-mail ticket buys. Please, I can’t send all of my e-mailers /tells so please please please send me the /tell and we can set up a meeting place. That’s it for now, I will probably posting more messages up on Everlore as time goes on. Bye, and remember, you have a good chance of winning if you buy more tickets and plus the prize will just get bigger and bigger.<br>
          Finally. If you are in a guild, a big group of friends, or you just want to buy a lot of tickets I have special prices for tickets in bulk. Here they are.<br>
          <br>
          100 tickets - 180pp<br>
          200 tickets - 370pp<br>
          300 tickets – 550pp<br>
          500 tickets – 900pp<br>
          1,000 tickets- 1,800<br>
          5,000 tickets (ok if you buy this much you are like my favorite person)- ONLY 9k you save ONE-THOUSAND PLATINUM hehe. And plus if you buy this during the buy 5 get 1 free you get 500 free tickets which is another 1k for free.<br>
          Alright thanks for taking your time to read this. <br>
