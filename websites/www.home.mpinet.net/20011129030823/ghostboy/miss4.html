You start this mission inside a shop which sells the tools of your trade. As soon as you make a move the shopkeeper meets an untimely demise and leaves you holding the bag (of loot!) Be quick and get behind the counter, there are lots of arrows and a few flashbombs back there, but be careful not to set them off instead of picking something else up. Hurry out to the street so you don't lose your would be killers. <BR><BR>
Once they (and you) reach their destination, your objectives should change. <BR><BR>
The level is pretty self explanitory from here, so i'll just point out notable loot and objectives. <BR><BR>

Library upstairs, 2 candle holders (50 gold each), and another 100 gold in a chest<BR><BR>
In a sitting room in the North East corner of the second floor (next to the library) is a dinner set worth 275 in loot.<BR><BR>
Ramirez' bedroom is in the North West corner of the second floor. Put the fire out with water arrows, inside is a lever which opens a secret panel. Inside is the silver fire poker that is an objective on expert level. <BR><BR>
Look in front of the fireplace, and in the spa to the right of it for additional loot. <BR><BR>
On the floor in front of the crate by the bed, is a ring, very hard to see on the carpet.<BR><BR>
The counting room, is on the first floor, in the center portion of the map, in the South East corner. <BR><BR>
Ramirez is in the basement, the only entrance is a locked steel door, you can either pick or find the key. turn left once you go in, there is a room with 2 people in it. One with a sword, one with a mace. The one with the mace is Ramirez, also noted by the pouch on his belt which you have to steal. It is quite possible to knock out this guard even after Ramirez sets off the alarm. Every few seconds he will go back to a standard "guard" position before looking around a bit more. Use moss arrows on the floor in the area so you can be fast, when he turns his back to you, blackjack him. Search that room for extra loot and info while Ramirez looks for you in the hallway. <BR><BR>

With the loot in pocket, head out the main gate or thru the back river. If you're playing on hard or expert and have set of the alarm you'll get new objectives. Head back to your own turf. Keep an eye on your map and compass while doing this. It's not too difficult but there are angry folks wandering the streets looking for you. <BR><BR>

2705 total loot in the level. <BR><BR>
