<center><a href="http://home.mpinet.net/ghostboy/undercover.jpg"><b>Level map</b></a></center><br>

This is probably the most simple level in terms of how well it's mapped, access to the objectives and opponents to deal with. <BR><BR>

For the most part there doesn't need to be a walk through for this level, except for the part most people have asked about. The levers to open the gate to get to the talismans. The map has been modified to show the relative location of 4 of the 5 levers. The 5th is in the Reliquary, behind the Skull pedestal (the first floor isn't on the updated map)<BR><BR>

The guards on this mission are usually well spaced enough for you to practice your knock out technique, except a couple, which i'd suggest investing in a few gas arrows for.<BR><BR>

1 In the grave marker of Brother Mason step in and look up. <BR>
2 The "keystone tree" is in the garden, under the white overhang. again, look up to see it. <BR>
3 Behind the rack in the torture room, easy to spot. <BR>
4 In the kitchen. This refers to the old kitchen, upstairs, just around the corner from the Inquisitors room. <BR>
5 As stated earlier, behind the skull in the reliquary.<BR><BR>

To get to the Talismans, you must flip ALL of these levers within 5 minutes of flipping the first one. A sounder will go off if you do it correctly. <BR><BR>

My suggestion for order to switch is this (after a sufficient amount of guards have been removed for ease of travel. Reliquary, (jump down to the garden) keystone tree, Brother Mason, rack and kitchen. <BR>
To be able to pick up the talismans, you must have the Wallbuilders Prayer. A scroll found on a table in a side room. <BR><BR>
The Talismans room is on the lower level, if you have the hammer from the high priests room a catwalk will appear to get you to the prize. Switch the lever in the left cage, this opens the right one. Step up close to the talismans and read the Wallbuilders Prayer. When you pick up the talismans, the alarm will sound, so make sure you have an escape route planned.  <BR><BR>
<b>This list is 100 short of total loot. </b><BR><BR>
