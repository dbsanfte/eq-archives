<P>From the start point, head south, past the main entrance and proceed along the road to the <a href="http://home.mpinet.net/ghostboy/cache.jpg">arrow cache</a> (marked on map). Just to the east of the cache is a manhole cover on the road, open it and climb down. Once down take the first right and head east until you reach a wooden door, open and step inside. In the water is a necklace (100 gems, 100 gold) and on the wall is a switch to open the iron gate just outside the door. Go out the door and head north/east until you come to a ladder up, it leads to a manhole just behind the guarded well entrance to Lord Baffords mansion. <br>
<BR>Climb out, kill the guard, knock him out or just run up and take the key, you literally have to shove him out of the way to have him notice you. Unlock the well entrance and take a dip! Follow the water (west) to the round room, swim to the bottom and through the small tunnel, you'll find a ring (100 gold) in a chest there (with a couple small spiders). Continue the swim west until you come to the small ledge on the right side of the water. 
<P>Open the door and walk (quietly) into the room, there is a chest containing a healing potion just in front of the door. There are 2 guards talking just outside this room.  They will move on and split up, remove them or avoid them in your most convenient manner.<BR>
<P>From the guards starting point, head east and follow the hallway. when you get to the storage room, look east and you'll see the doorway to continue. In the chest beyond the door are 2 flash bombs. Go north to the staircase and head upstairs. <br>
<P>At the top of the stairs are 2 crates, the left crate has a vase (non valuable), the right has 5 gold. 
Make your way to the west, through any of the 4 doors connecting to the central part of the house. The two south-eastern rooms hold only servants and no loot. The easiest way to the second floor is by way of the southern stairway (marked rooms 6 and 7), but you can also head up the stairs through room (marked) 5.<BR>
<P>From the top of the stairs head east, either through the library or sitting room (depending on which stairs you go up). Pickpocket, knock out or kill one of the guards to get a key to the throne room (or check the table in room 10). The throne room, and ultimately the scepter is located past the room with 2 locked doors in it. 
Remember, if you play on normal mode the mission will end if you pick up the scepter, so be sure to loot before you grab it. <BR><BR>
