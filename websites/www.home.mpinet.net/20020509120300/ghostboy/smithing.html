<center><B>Getting Started</B></center><BR><BR>

For the aspiring smith the best thing to do before starting is put as many points as possible into the skill. You can only put 21 training points into any trade skill and that is highly recommended here as smithing can be very expensive. <BR><BR>
Next find the local store that sells ore, flasks of water and molds. These are always from different vendors so you may end up running around a lot. <BR><BR>
<b>Up to 21-</b><BR>
Sharpening weapons or making files to 21, if you put all your points in that you can, don't even bother sharpening except to drop a weapons delay by 2 points. I hear larger weapons like 2 handed swords will raise you higher than 21. <BR><BR>


Metal bits are also good to 21. This takes 2 small pieces of ore, and a flask of water. Note..you
CANNOT use the water that you forage to do this..it has to be a FLASK of water..costs 1s, 2c for most people. Get used to making bits, you'll need them into the 100's. <BR><BR>

<b>21-41</b><BR>
Scalers are good to 41, they are one of the cheapest things to practice at this point and also have a good payback value, almost twice what they cost.<BR><BR>

<b>41-46</b><BR>
Studs are good to 46, but i stay away from making studs, they are expensive and tedious. This is my feeling on studded armor and why i refuse to make it. You need 2 chunks of ore per metal bit. you need 3 bits per stud. Plus to make the stud you need to make a file (another metal bit + water + file mold)now to make any piece of studded armor, you need a certain amount of studs for it. Tunics take 5 studs (thats 15 metal bits). Now that you have your 5 studs, you need a medium quality pelt for whatever size armor you want to make. You
also need a tailor with sufficient skill to make this, because it's a long process with no benefit if it fails (by now files, metal bits and studs may be trivial to make, which means you can't improve smithing from it) And
studded armor doesn't offer THAT much of a benefit anyway. Maybe 1 point higher than patchwork for the same piece. <br>
<i>***A side note. You now dont need to make a new file for every stud and studs are now stackable. This makes creating them a little less stressful but still not very useful. My suggestion would be to make a few stacks of studs only to get to 46 and sell them to a vendor or try to find a needy tailor looking to buy them. Otherwise you may just want to go on to lanterns or cookie cutters.</i><BR><BR>

<b>46-60ish</b><br>
At 46 i heard that making lanterns is the way to go. they are a little more expensive than the skewers everyone thinks they should work on. Lanterns arent bad, good imps but you have to carry a few different items to make them. Water and metal bits which you have anyway, empty bottles and the mold.  <BR><BR>

<i>Steel boning becomes trivial at some point before 56 in smithing, you may want to try making this after scalers or studs become trivial. </i><BR><BR>

At about 55-60 you can start fooling around with small banded items, but i wouldnt suggest it. Bracers and gorgets are most notable because the molds are cheap and they
only take 1 sheet of metal.<BR><BR>

Cookie cutters will get you to 56. They cost about 4 gold each for the mold and 1 metal bit. They have a good resale value to vendors so you don't lose more than a gold if you make one. <BR><BR>
<b>60-116-</b><BR>
At 60 you're good enough to start on skewers. They will improve you to 115 if you just work on them. You may still fail quite a bit on them but they are cheap to make and if you do manage to make some you'll make a lot of your money back. I quit making skewers at 103, because the demand for armor was fairly high and i improved ok from that, and 2 i didn't know how far skewers would take me and metal bits were driving me up the wall.<BR><BR>

At 75 to 80 you can feel free to try a few armor pieces. Helms, Masks, Sleeves, Bracers and Gorgets should all be possible. I didn't manage to make any boots until almost 100. <BR><BR>

By 120 you can make all armor pieces at a decent rate, altho for me leggings and mantles failed a lot. My suggestion is to stick to making non armor pieces to raise the skill to 135. <BR><BR>
<b>116-135-</b><br>
At 116 when skewers become trivial work on pots to 122 and then sewing kits to 135.<BR><BR>
<b>135-168-</b><br>
After 135 you MUST work on armor. Make banded gauntlets to 168 when greaves and mantles also become trivial.  <BR><BR>
<b>168-175-</b><br>
Make banded cloaks from 168 to 175 when all banded items become trivial. After this the only way to improve smithing that i am aware of is to spend a fortune making fine steel plate to whenever it becomes trivial somewhere over 200 i presume. <BR><BR>
A note on sheets of metal. In the basics of blacksmithing book, it gives
the ingredients for making your own sheets. I would stay away from doing
that since the cost of the 2 blocks of ore to make one costs about as much
as it does to buy the sheet itself. I know i would much rather KNOW i have
the sheet than to spend over 1p to buy ore and fail making it. Besides the ore weighs a ton and is hard to transport. <BR><BR>
