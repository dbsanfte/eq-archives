In the mausoleum up on the hill to the left is a gold goblet (15 goods). Head into the main shaft.<BR>
Near the entrance is the body of one of Felix's spelunking partners, he was carrying some loot with him. (100 gold)<BR>
In the first room of the upper vaults sits a gold vase (100 gold), watch your step!<BR>
After descending the rope in the upper vaults, head south to the blue chest (100 gems)<BR><BR>
<b>Skip the BS</b><BR><BR>
After climbing down the ladder and narrowly avoiding being squashed, head into the tunnels. This is the direct path to the Halls of Echoing Repose. almost inside the first turn of the tunnel is a wandering burrick.<BR>
 Turn left at the end of the tunnel you are in (where it meets the burricks tunnel) and jump down past the board and turn left again. walk to the end of the small tunnel you are in and peek around the corner to the right. There is a tunnel higher up on the wall with a rope hanging in front of it, wait til the burricks are wandering away and make your move (or just kill them if you like that kind of thing). Follow the short tunnel until it ends in a grey rock room with another rope dangling from the roof. Turn left and head for the red rock tunnel. <BR>
<P><i>This will be divided into 3 section from here. The Horn, The Mystic Heart, and The Mystic Soul. The golden bones subquest is also noted at the bottom. </i><BR><BR>

<b>The Horn of Quintus </b>(borrowed from the Eidos walk through)<BR><BR>
Walk forward into the catacombs. Take the right-hand corridor every time you have a choice. Use your holy water and water arrows if you need to take out some of the zombies, but don¹t use your fire arrows since you¹ll need them later. <BR>
Keep heading down these right-hand corridors until you come to an open room with a lot of zombies. Run over to and head up the long ramp in the center of the room. At the top of the ramp, turn right and follow that path until you come to a wooden ramp. Turn left and head up the ramp, once inside the tower, go left up the stairs and climb the large ramp.<BR>
<P>At the top of the ramp, there are more of those purple magic missiles to deal with. The four posts on the platform fire their missiles at regular intervals, so timing your passage is not difficult. Make your way around the platform to the single exit from this area and follow the hall until it ends. <BR>
<P>Go into the burrick caves and bear to your right through the first opening. Head left then, but keep your eyes trained toward the right side. You should spot a pair of burricks guarding a passageway to a crypt. <BR>
Take the ladder heading up to the first platform. Look for a ladder set against the wall. Jump to it and climb again, jumping down to the second-tier platform from the top.<BR>
From the second platform, walk around again until you see yet another ladder leading up. Jump over to it and climb again, leaping down to the third tier from the top. From here, walk around until you see the catwalk leading through the center of the room. At the far side is the Horn of Quintus, the object of your quest. <BR><BR>

<i>Now back to the crypt with you!</i><BR><BR><BR>

<b>The Mystic Heart</b><BR><BR>

From the top of the first ramp (with the fireballs being fired nearby)stand with your back to the ramp and climb the ladder now in front of you. Jump to the platform and follow the path. Dispatch or avoid the burrick and continue on. What lies before you is one of the hardest tasks in the game. A series of jumps and drops amid a flurry of purple fireballs. This i leave up to you with one hint. Head down and to the left as quickly as possible...at least until you are out of the path of the fireball, where you can plan your next move. 
From the bottom walk carefully thru the open doorway. Each of the statues will kill you dead if you step in front of them. To see where not to step, look at it's base, each is triagular and easy to avoid if you are careful.<BR><BR> 
See <a href="http://home.mpinet.net/ghostboy/heart.jpg">diagram</a> and have a weapon ready. <BR><BR>
Mystic Heart (1000 gems)<BR><BR>
Step inside the small alcove behind the chest to get back out. <BR><BR><BR>

<b>The Mystic Soul.</b><BR><BR>

From the top of the ramp (by the fireball again) head to the right and this time go past that wooden ramp and continue on. The first room to the right is a small room with the lighting shaped like a Hammer. The next room on the right is where you need to be. There are 5 doors here and 5 UNlit torches. You should have started the missions with 5 or 6 fire arrows, so light those torches up! Now run! or deal with your surprise as you see fit. Once you are finished with that drop into the hole in the center of the room and swim to the other end. Mantle up out of the water and examine the room. The Soul is directly ahead of you on the pedestal.<BR>
This room is VERY trapped. Turn around and look at the wall, note the holes. look behind the altar, note the holes. <i>Crossfire is the word of the day. </i><BR>
Its a good idea to fool around a bit and find out where the traps are. <BR>
The easiest approach is to run and jump at the stairs, and quickly get to one side or the other until the explosions stop. Now it's time to think like Indiana Jones. Pick up the skull on the ground next to the altar, and place it next to to the Soul, it must sit flatly on the bottom or you'll be sorry. Now grab the Soul (500 gems) and carefully and quickly head back to the way you came in and take the ladder or the water, which ever you choose. <BR><BR>

<b>LOOT!</b><BR><BR>

Goblet(15 goods) in Marad tomb. Walk past the fireball shooter and out to the ledge. Look to the left, there will be a ledge with an opening you can jump to.<BR><BR>
Keep heading down that path, stay to the left and walk up the ramp, circle around and go up the next one.(The door behind you now leads to an alternate exit...think small ; ) You will come to a room with a pit in the center. Stick a rope arrow in the ceiling and climb down. There is 200 in gems and 4 rope arrows also in a chest.<BR><BR>

By now you should have almost enough for the 2000 (out of 2450) minimum for Expert level. There is a lot of treasure that isn't listed here, but if you just look around there is quite a bit scattered around, even some back in the burrick caves. <BR><BR>

<b>The Golden Bones</b><BR><BR>
1 From the entrance follow the left wall, you'll run right into a leg bone. <BR>
2 Head NorthEast around a couple of pillars and you'll find an altar room with a few bodies on the ground and a vase(100 goods) on the altar, and an arm on the ground.<BR>
3 Take the big staircase down to the water, swim thru the crack and inside the first air pocket there is one of the arms. <BR>
4 The last extremity is located next to the sargophagus you need to throw it into. <BR><BR>

Once you have the first 3 go back to the room next to the Soul/torch lighting room which has the hammer shaped light on the floor. Climb down one of the ladders and toss all 4 extremities and also the golden skull found there into the sarcophagus. 4 parts of the floor will light up, there is gear located on each including lots of fire arrows, some holy water and water arrows. <BR>
