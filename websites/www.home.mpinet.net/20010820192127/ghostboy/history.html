<font size=+1>In a land called Meridian (59), nearly 5 years ago, June 11, 1996 if i remember right, the 'group' called the Voyagers was born. I say group because there was no guild formed, just a group of friends who would watch each others backs in case someone needed help. <BR><BR>
The events of the day were simple. As i wandered around, eyes wide open in wonder in the new world, i passed through a town called Cor Noth. A group had formed near the large clock tower and i noticed one of my few friends at the time Dana Firehair. She invited me to join in with the rest in making a pact to be there if any of the others should need a hand and i agreed. Among others that day were Valkarth, Dhyannah, Obar, Khazad and a few others who's names i've forgotten over the years but each had an impact in my future. They decided on a name and <font color=blue><b>The Voyagers</font></b> were born. <BR><BR>
For about a year and a half we lived solely in Meridian, making our name known, not always in the best light but always as we wished it to be. Then UO was released. Valkarth, Dana and a few others forged ahead into the new game in hopes of spreading the values we'd come to have from the beginning. To this day the UO Voyagers are around and still going good. <BR><BR>
In early May, the 3rd of 1999, the Voyagers invaded a new game. EverQuest. most of us had been in the game but thats the day we became an official, names scraping the wall guild. Many friends and old guildmates have joined us there, some have gone to other servers but as the rules always are, they are Voyagers where ever they go. <BR><BR>
To this day, we've been neutral, staying out of conflicts as best we can, helping solve a few here and there, and generally being what we always claimed. There to serve those around us. When guilds fall down around us, it makes us stronger, we see what made them crash, and change anything we do that was similar. <br><br>
We are fully democratic, no one being any more important or gaining more of a vote than any other. The guild master has a vote which is equaled by that of a Scout, titles mean nothing, other than something for the games to keep track of. This policy seems to help us from having internal power struggles. <br><br>
We have no guild hall, as rangers, the roads we walk and each others company are all we need. This home page is our castle, our laws set in it's stone. <br><br>
So to this day, when you hear the cry go up <font color=blue><i>Hail the Voyagers!!!</font></i> know that somehow, for someone, we made a difference...and if you need help and see us around, just ask..the Voyagers are here to save those who may not be able to do it alone. <br><br>
