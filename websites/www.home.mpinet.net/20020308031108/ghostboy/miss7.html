Follow the road until you come to the river (just past the well). In front of you is a waterway, to your left is a wooden gate. If you use a rope arrow on the side of the house near the gate (the one with the wooden beam look) you'll find some extra arrows and loot past the gate. At the bottom of this section of water is a stone door and a "<a href="http://home.mpinet.net/ghostboy/lock.jpg">lock</a>" the lock has appeared to some people as a black block, for others it lights up like anything else. Use the stone key you stole from the Keepers temple to open the door. <BR>
<P>Take a deep breath of air and swim for it. You may need a breath potion to make it through unless you have really good lungs. Also, look for conveniently placed air pockets. <BR>
After the big dive, you'll come into another air flow section. Be quick and mantle up onto the first ledge/opening you come to. It will be on your right and will save you a few health points and some time.<BR> Follow the path around and jump across the stream. Follow the ledges down and go left at the fork on the road. <BR>
<P>You have 2 choices of how to get down to the area below. The easy way, go down thru the hole in the corner, it leads down into the building you're on, with a few burricks in there. Or you can do the hard way, if you angle your fall from the front of the building, so that you hit a statue on the way down, you can land with very little damage. Probably better to take the safe way ; )<BR><BR>
Inside this building there are 2 gold cups in a window (30 goods).<BR><BR>
Once out, head for the city before you. In this city section, there is a gold cup (25 gold), a gold plate (50 gold) and a 7 fire arrows. <BR>
I suggest heading east, hopping along the 4 rooftops until you come to the first section where you will see the elementals (fireballs who fly around)<BR>
Leave thru the South exit and follow the path. You'll eventually come to the central part of your map, straight ahead you'll see several elementals zipping around, sneak thru the break in the wall and get rid of them. The gates area to the right has a little loot (50 gold, 100 gems) and some arrows. Go back out to the South.<BR><BR>

<b>To get the Water Talisman</b>: Head to the South<BR><BR>

In the first area is 2 elementals (labeled as the Court), the walls are lined with blue gems, and 1 on the ground (345 gems). If you head into any of these doors, you'll end up in the same place eventually, a small path where you can mantle up onto the roof. Also, in this building are 2 masks, which you may need if you bought one of the hot tips before the mission. <BR>
<P>Follow the path until you come to a lot of square buildings, mantle up onto the roof of one and roof hop to the other end of the lava flow. At the end of this you'll find the remains of one of the Keepers parties. One of the medallions you need on expert level is here. <BR>
<P>After looting the former party, keep on the path and head down the stairs when you get to them. As you go down the steps, either jump, or shoot a rope arrow into the wooden beam to get across the small pit. In the next room is a hole and ladder going down in the far left corner of the room. <BR>
<P>In one of the side alcoves in the next room is a lever. Take that, you'll need it to get to the fire talisman. 
See that sarcophagus? go into the opening behind it and swim to the back corner. Thats where the water talisman rests. <BR><BR>

Search around for a little loot that is here and head all the way back to the central area on the map. <BR><BR>

<b>To get the Fire Talisman</b>:
Head southwest. You'll come to a place where you can go SouthEast or SouthWest...go SouthWest and take the first left. Continue on SW (UP the hills) Until you come to 2 abandoned houses. Turn around to your left.<BR>
Follow that path. You should pass over a few lava pits and thru a dark building into an area with a couple monsters there. There is a lot of loot here, mostly in the goods category. Also in a lower room is a piece of machinery which you can use that lever on. This extends the bridge to the fire elemental area. Head up to the now extended bridge and cross (don't just jump or it's near impossible to get back) Follow the path, you'll come to a doorway looking out to a good drop, look down. There is a ledge beneath you. Drop down and mantle up to your left. Walk down the stairs. Just to the left is the remains of another search party. The second medallion is here. Carry on. <BR>
<P>The next room you come to, has several buildings, the closest one to you, on your right is your target. Go in and shoot a rope arrow to get to the second level. Jump to the next building and then jump back to the 2 story building, but mantle up to the roof. There are some arrows and stuff up there. Get back down to the next building, inside it is some loot. Jump to the ledge on the other side of the lava and circle around inside the other buildings. From here you can see the tower which holds the fire talisman. <BR>
<P>When the coast is clear from fire elementals run for the door. Climb the stairs up to the 3rd floor. On one floor there is a little loot too. Move out the window ever so carefully, it's easy to slip off the balcony so make sure you save here! Follow the balcony to the left all the way around. Hook a rope arrow to the very outside of the middle beam, climb up and jump in the window. As soon as you grab the fire talisman, elemental activity picks up a LOT. Unless you can sneak by them you're going to have to get rid of them. <BR>

<P>Backtrack to the entrance, on hard and expert you have to get out of the city, this means getting back to the river, but not to the starting city. <BR><BR>

"loot note"<BR>
On the way back thru the guard building containing the bridge/lever mechanism, there is a hallway with a beam across it. There is another crayman and 200-250 in loot up there. <BR><BR>

<b>Total loot</b>:2845 OR 3205 if you buy the parchment at the start and find the masks.<BR><BR>

Just going thru these locations and grabbing the noted loot, you should be well over the 2000 gold objective for expert level. <BR><BR>
