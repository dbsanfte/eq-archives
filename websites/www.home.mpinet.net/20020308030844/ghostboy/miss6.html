<b>The Serpentyle Torc</b><BR><BR>

This fine crafted piece of jewelry was owned by a rich fellow who lived just west of the drawbridge, on a now cut off street. <BR>
From the drawbridge (in the UP position) climb up the short wall on the control side of the bridge (you can lower it from the other side by shooting the bottom button with an arrow through the window) From the top of the short wall, mantle up to the wall holding the drawbridge, zip across and pick the lock on the grey door. This path will get you to the mansion containing the fabled Torc. There is a key under the doormat, or you can pick the lock. <BR>
The Torc is in a locked chest upstairs next to the bed (it only appears to be jewelry and gives no warning you found it). Check around for extra loot in the house and then head back the way you came by run/mantling up the walls. <BR><BR>

<b>The Watchmans Grave. </b><BR><BR>

West end of Market street, enter the first opening on the south side. Crawl thru the fireplace and go up the stairs on the left. Shoot a rope arrow up at the top of the stairs to get to the next floor. Look out the window, there is a ledge with a door on it. Jump to that ledge and pick the lock. Proceed to the Watchmans Grave. 
To get out, walk up the angled beam, and jump/mantle to the beam headed to the door. <BR><BR>

<b>The Haunted Cathedral. </b><BR><BR>

At the North Eastern part of the map lies the cathedral. The doors have been sealed, so getting in at this point is impossible. Head around to the right from the entrance and mantle up the ledge near the back corner. The "eye" will give you further instructions. <BR><BR>
<i>Your objectives will change, you must now get into the Keepers temple in the area to find out how to unseal the Hammer cathedral. </i><BR><BR>

<b>The Keepers Temple. </b><BR><BR>

Follow the Eye's directions to open the Keepers temple.<BR><BR>

<i>"Comes a man to rescue me.<BR>
Poor man, Keepers have sealed the door,<BR> 
and only they know how to open them. <BR>
Cross you the bridge to the grotto of the Keeper Sentinel, <BR>
stand you on the pedestal, and illuminate the statue with fire. <BR>
Then can you discover the secret of the Talismans."</i><BR><BR>

This translates to. Go back to the power station closest to the temple, go south into the room with the platform surrounded by water. Use a rope arrow to get to it. Stand on the key shaped metal pedestal. Shoot a fier arrow at the statue, which should light both of the unlit torches there. A panel will slide away from a wall on the east side.  <BR>
<P>Inside is a door, blocked by a gate. There is a pedestal with broken statues to either side. Stack rubble on each to open the gate and the door. Pick the lock on the door, being careful to not get squashed. Go to the left first, pick up the key from the table and read the 2 notes. Then go back to the right, look at the table and read the book there. Your objectives will change again. <BR>

<P>Now all you should have left is the loot requirements. That, on expert, is the hardest part of this level (in my opinion) Listed below are just some of the locations of loot, there is undoubtedly some i didn't find or mark if it was easily visible. <BR><BR>

Loot!<BR><BR>
By the small red C on the map (beginning of Cathedral street) hidden in the barber shop is a gold vase (50 goods)<BR><BR>

In the locked room, just South West of the drawbridge, is a diamond (100 gems)<BR><BR>

When you are on Market street (the west end), (across the street from the Watchmans grave entrance) shoot a rope arrow to the wooden support beams and jump to the brick ledge. There is a gold pitcher and some arrows there. <BR><BR>

At one corner near market street, 2 beams disect the corner, yet are attached horizontally. Behind one is a gold goblet (50 goods)<BR><BR>

To the west of this is a building in mid-topple. To the right of that is a building with a ledge just a hair too high to mantle to, but it's wooden. In that building is a gold plate (50 gold). From where that plate is, look across the street and you can see a gold vase on a window sill. <BR><BR>

Basically, if you can climb there, go. If you can shoot a rope arrow and get there climb it. I have only marked 1500 or so in loot, but the Torc is worth a little, and there is loot strewn all over this level. Be inventive and it shall be yours. <BR><BR>
