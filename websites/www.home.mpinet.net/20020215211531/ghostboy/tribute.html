</HEAD>
<b>The Voyagers strength has always come from our members. This page is dedicated to all those who have held the title of Voyager since our inception in May/June of 1996.  Many of these fine people are no longer with us in Meridian but have all helped in some small way to help us grow into the guild we are today. <br><br>
When i asked Valkarth for a list of members from way back in beta, she surprised us all with this poem...<br><br></b>
<center><font color=black><font size=+1>Hear the History of the Voyagers, in the voices of the wind, <br>
Brave and bold the Rangers twenty, steadfast to their kith and kin<br>
Hear me now as I list here, the deeds of those who went before<br>
Dana Firehair stood first among us, Heralding our founding lore.<br><br>

Then came Valkarth, Training Serjeant, second founder of the three<br>
Khazad was a brave and bold one, Castellan of our homepage, he<br>
Tanis, then, our Guard Captain, loyal courage for our band<br>
Steadfast Rasmar, the Recruiter, always with a guiding hand<br><br>

Came then Thrap, with Duty Roster,a clever hand if you will<br>
Then the last of the positions, awesome hand with lyre or quill<br>
I speak now of Morden Blackshire, poet, friend, artist and Bard,<br>
Dwell ye 'pon our Voyager Emblem, Morden did our honor guard.<br><br>

Hear ye the names of our leaders, starting with Haplo, he of the heart<br>
Dhyannah, Jeff, Fendor and Crazyman, Obar the Wizard at the start<br>
Tolemac, Katrina, Striker, Axton, all names of those ring tried and true<br>
Hear ye now the lore of the ages, the Rangers, those who rescue too.<br><br>

There was Karrick, Timatia, Kern and Warrior, eager and willing to defend<br>
Vicar, scion of old Asha'man, Ama, hard working to the end.<br>
blacque knight, defender of our honor, died at a traitor's hand<br>
Bonehead, Kanaida, Skully, John Gaunt, also joined our growing band<br><br>

Speak I now of fair Merurdaen, elven lord and warrior bold, <br>
Flavius, Elminster, Ahriman, Megan, Rangers now 'n as of old<br>
Even as the last four utter, this I know to be our fate<br>
Puck, Cindy, Florin, Picard, your names are not too late<br><br>

For our people now have come here, taken root in a new land<br>
With memories of our friends and fellows we are stronger as a band<br>
Please remember all the people as I have shown ev'ry hero<br>
And of all the founders three, the last of the first of us was Niro.<br></font></font></font><br><br>

<font color=blue><b>There are more who have been there through out our times, those who are still with us and keep the Voyager spirit alive. <br><br>
