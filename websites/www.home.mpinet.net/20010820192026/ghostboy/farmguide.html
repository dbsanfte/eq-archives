<U><B>What is Merchant Farming and why do i need to know how to do it?</B></U><BR>
Merchant Farming is the method of shopping used by those who have some time to kill, a little plat to spend but dont want to pay outrageous prices for common items like spider silks or high quality cat pelts. <BR><BR>

The reason for farming is, of course, to be able to work your trade, make some cash or just find items like deathfist belts or bone chips by the stack without paying 3p or more per item when you dont need to. <BR><BR>

This is a simple how to, since to some people it is confusing if not explained correctly. <BR><BR>

<center><H3>First, spot your victim. </H3></center><BR>
Good victims are in zones where plenty of what you want drops, and where quite a few other items are available to cover up the fact that some people do sell these things to merchants. <BR><BR>

<center><H3>Approach your victim with a smile. </H3></center><BR>
Time to throw on all that old +charisma gear, and hope you worked your faction up with this particular person.<BR>
Paying low and selling high is the key to not losing a fortune to merchants. Bards and enchanters are particularly good at this with their faction songs and generally high charisma. <BR><BR>

<center><H3>Check what they are selling.</H3></center><BR>
Most merchants wont have what you're looking for right up front, or else someone else would likely have bought it. This is the key to farming your friendly neighborhood merchants. <BR>
See what they have, and make a quick mental note of how much you might have to spend right off to clear out a slot. <BR><BR>

Note the multiple stacks of cheap, stackable items. This is a good merchant to farm, at least to begin with. <BR><BR>

First thing to do, is clear out an inventory slot on the merchant, so that you can sell one of what you're trying to buy to see if they have more. <BR><BR>

If you sell your item to the merchant, and it appears in the now clear slot, buy it back and move on. They wont have any more buried deeper. (see pic below)<BR><BR>

If you sell to them and it disappears, it means that the merchant has more buried deeper on them, and they just added it to that stack instead of putting it in the now empty store shelf. ( see below)<BR><BR>

<center><H3>Dig for it!</H3></center><BR><BR>
This is the part where you buy everything possible until you hit what you want. <BR><BR>

<center><H2>Keys to farming:</H2></center><BR>
Learn what to buy, so as to minimize trips to the next merchant to sell , and also what has the best sell back value. <BR><BR>
Pick a merchant near others. One key to farming is to be able to get rid of all that junk you're buying rather quickly, and running halfway across the zone to another merchant will slow you down. <BR><BR>

<center><H3>What to Buy:</H3></center><BR>
Orc pawn scalps, eggs, bone chips, spider legs, bat wings. Anything small and stackable.<BR><BR>

Cloth armor, rusty weapons, rawhide armor, anything that stacks and costs less than 2 gold each are usually good to buy. Even tho rawhide costs over 1p per piece, it sells back at a good value and generally there arent many pieces in a stack. <BR><BR>

Low value gems, up to 5p each, most sell back for 80% or more of the value and are only 1 or 2 gems deep.<BR><BR>

Anything that stands out in the stack that doesnt drop in the zone. Bixie wings in Everfrost is obvious that there probably arent more than 1 or 2 in the slot, so the loss wont be huge and it easily opens a slot. <BR><BR>

Bronze weapons, these are a little on the expensive side, 2-3p usually but sell back for just under cost. <BR><BR>

<center><H3>What Not to Buy:</H3></center><BR>
Avoid buying runes and words if at all possible. These seem to have the worst sell back cost, not counting fine steel or special items, which i dont suggest buying at all. <BR><BR>

Anything which seems expensive for its value. This seems vague but buying just 1 and seeing the buy back value might save you from buying a whole stack of 3p items that sell back for 8s.<BR><BR>

Bixie/harpy wings. These cost 5g or more to buy, and sell back for silver. Usually found in huge stacks. <BR><BR>

Any player crafted item on a vendor who sells supplies. Never buy quivers or silk armor from a vendor who sells patterns. Someone was standing there practicing and selling back without a doubt.<BR><BR>

Fine steel. Look at the price, you'll get the point.<BR><BR><BR>
