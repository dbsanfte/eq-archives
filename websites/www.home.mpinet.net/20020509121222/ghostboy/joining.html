The only way to join the Voyagers is by a method we call Sponsoring. <BR><BR>

Sponsoring means that if you have travelled with someone in the guild, or know one in real life, or can con one of us into "sponsoring" you, you may be invited into the guild on a trial membership basis. The person who is the sponsor is responsible for you and your actions, however unlikely that something damaging may happen. After a certain amount of time we may call a vote to decide whether the member should stay or not, but in most cases there doesn't need to be a vote. A vote will probably only be called in cases where questionable personality or actions are present. <BR><BR>

If you don't know anyone in the guild other than having seen us roaming all over Norrath, feel free to talk to any of us, altho some are more familiar with the guild make up and rules than others. Most will send you here first, to the home page to learn more about us. You will need to send an email to the guild (my email is listed on the main page) and let us know you're still interested after reading the page, or talk to the person who sent you here. They will then let the guild know about you, generally thru the email list we have set up. There will be a vote, if anyone has seen actions which they feel don't look good coming from a Voyager in game you may be rejected by the guild. This vote will take 3 days. Keep in contact with the guild members to find out the status of the voting (but don't badger us too much =) .  Any vote of NO will result in not being accepted to the guild. <BR><BR>

You must have or find a sponsor to be admitted into the guild. This shows us that at least one person trusts you enough to take responsibility.

'The sponsor must FIRST announce an applicant over the email. All applicants
must have at least 5 votes for them to get in, from people who have hunted
with them. One negative vote is enough to keep them out.'(hunted is defined
as interacting for a period of time to kill creatures, quest, or give aid
while watching them)<BR>
