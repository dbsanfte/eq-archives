 The paladins in the camp in Rathe Mountains give the quests for the Ro armor. Below are the methods of getting the molds for each item.  All molds are no drop/lore items, so whoever turns in the items must finish the quest. <BR>

Leaf wants to reassemble the legendary Kithicor Bow.  Hunt Maldyn Greenburn (a wayward  master archer) in the Rathe Mountains by unkempt druids and retreive Broken bow part A, part of Morins Bow of Kithicor.   Part B drops from Slaythe the Slayer in Lower Guk.  Bring Leaf both parts and he will give you the gauntlets. <BR><BR>

<B>     Ivy Etched Boots:</B>  <I>ac10, +5 sta</I><BR>
(Leaf Falldim)  Ronium, 1 Mistmoore Granite (from gargoyles in Mistmoore) and 2000 gp. <BR><BR>

<B>     Ivy Etched Leggings:</B>  <I>ac 12 +5 agi +5 vs fire/cold</I><BR>
(Leaf Falldim) Leaf needs the "Quiver of Kithicor" and a Star of Odus, which can be purchased in Erudin.  To get the quiver, go to Kelethin and speak with Lieutenant Leafstalker who tells you to collect 6 different named arrows (Acknowledgment, bravery, defiance, gallantry, fortitude and recognition) from the
Outcast Brownies in Lesser Faydark (Kill Pixe Tricksters and Pranksters to get them to spawn).  
Then go to the Ocean of Tears.  On Seafury Isle the "a buccaneer" spawns as a place holder for Wiltin Windwalker.  If you kill the buccaneer, the spawn rate is 90 minutes.  If you leave him alone, he will despawn in far less than 90 minutes, with the chance that Wiltin will spawn in his place.  Thus, you don't want to kill the bucaneer. Instead,  you need to just sit there and wait for Wiltin to spawn and then kill him.  Get the Quiver and combine the 6 Arrows.  Return the Quiver to Leaf in Kithicor along with the star. <BR><BR>

You need the ingot and icon of Reliant and 1 bar of enchanted platinum.  Go to Kithicor Woods, in one of the burnt houses you will find a book (looks like a bag on the floor). The book will reveal that Turgan the Reliant lived here once, and his brother perished in the fire that burnt the house. It also states that one of the items is hidden in Kithicor. This is the Ingot of the Reliant. Look for it on one of  the tree stumps in Kithicor Woods (it is among a group of stumps).  You need to jump off a fallen tree to get onto the stump, or use levitate.  The book also states that Turgan has moved to Lake Rathetear. There, he is situated off to the left of Gnoll Camp. Hailing him is useless, as well as asking him about the Icon of the Reliant (he will shout at you and tell you to go away). Give him the book and he will give you the Icon.  <BR><BR>

   <B>  Bracers of the Reverent:</B> <I> (Gavel)  ac9 +5 wis (wt 3.0)</I><BR>

Ask her what has become of Regis  the Reverent and she will tell you that he was killed in the N Karanas by an evil man named Zahal the Vile  She says if you go kill Zahal the Vile, Regis' body will rise from the dead where he was killed along the NE  tree line of the zone.  She also asks that if he has her flute on his body to bring it to her.  Zahal the Vile is a ghoul around level 30 or so who spawns in the NE part of NK.  When you kill Zahal, Regis will appear at the  tree line.  He is a zombie.  You need to kill him and loot his corpse to get the ingot and the flute.

There are things behind the doors that are kinda ugly (mid blue to 34).  In the center room (these rooms are no more than closets) on the floor is where the Icon spawns.  It is on the floor and looks like a small doll until it is picked up. The Ingot of Sacrament spawns on a Giant Darkbone Skeleton In the ruins in Rathe Mountains. <BR><BR>

<B><I><U><FONT SIZE="4">Enchanter Incandescent Armor:  </FONT></U></I></B><BR><BR>
Sultin makes various incandescent items, plus the rod, which are for enchanters. <BR><BR>
<B>Incandescent Wand: </B>  He needs a Pouch of Silver Dust from the Dusty Werebat in the Estate of Unrest. He also needs a Silver Wand from the Silvered Guard in Cazic Thule, but asks that you get the wand enchanted  before you bring it to him.  Both of the components for this quest are no drop. Once you find the Silver Wand,  take it to Ezmirella in the gypsy camp in North Karana. Hand her the Silver Wand and 50 gold coins. She will return a Blessed Silver Wand an instruct you to seek out Raine Beteria in the Erudin Library.  Hand Raine  the wand and 50 gold coins to receive the Glowing Silver Wand and the following faction adjustments:  <BR> MerchantsofErudin, HighCouncilofErudin, HighGuardofErudin get better.  You must have a good faction for  this, so you may need to use benevolence.  Take the Enchanted Silver Wand and Pouch of Silver Dust back to  Sultin. Hand him both and he will give you the Incandescent Wand. <BR><BR>

   <B>  Incandescent Mask:</B> He needs a Glowing Mask, found on the skeletal monk in the caverns of Guk (I have also been told you can get one on the froglock scryer)  and all three Runes of Fortune.  One Rune can be found on the Dark Elf Enynti in the Chasm below Castle Mistmoore.  The other two can each be purchased  for 50 golden coins each - one from Mizr N`Mar in the Neriak City Library and the other from Madam Serena in Qeynos.  Purchasing the rune from Mizr N'Marr increases your faction with beta neutral, so this is an easy, but costly, way to raise this faction. <BR><BR>

<B>     Incandescent Gloves:  </B>He needs to sew together four other sets of gloves to make these.  Glowing Gloves  from Shadowed Men, Radiant Gloves from Radiant in the mazes of Cazic Thule and Enchanted and Gleaming  gloves.  For Gleaming Gloves you have to give Tarn Vislin in Highkeep a bloodstone he will then give you Gleaming gloves.  Bring 50gp to Tizina of the Lavastorm Gypsies.  She will then hand you the Enchanted  Gloves. <BR><BR>

   <B>  Rod of Insidious Glamour:</B>  (increases charisma) He needs a golden rod (from a froglok priest in guk) and an enchanted shining stone.  The enchanted shining stone is made from a shining stone from shadow men, take that stone to Cynthia, a gypsie in the rathe mountains and give it and 50gp to get it enchanted.  Then go to Highkeep and get the stone transmuted.  The two steps for getting the stone each raise faction with beta  neutral and can be done separately from the rest of the quest for those who just need a faction boost. <BR><BR>

 

<FONT SIZE="4"><B><U><I>Mage Armor:</I></U></B></FONT>  <BR><BR>Joyce in the Temple of Solusek Ro will make 3 articles of magician armor.<BR><BR> 

<B>     Clay Bracelet:</B>  He needs all 4 runes of clay.   3 come from gnomish necros in Rathe Mntns in the two towers  (Bindlegrob, Sindlegrob and Findlegrob).  The other comes from goblin headmaster in ocean of tears (by a  tent on the oracle island).  The 3 necros in the mnts are in 2 different spots one close to the lake zone and 2  together closer to ferrott zone. <BR><BR>

<B>     Earthen Boots:</B>  stone marker (glyphed guard in mistmoore), heart of stone (stone skeleton), soiled boots (froglok Tonta Knight in guk), and a cats eye agate. <BR><BR>

<B>     Circlet of Mist:</B>  Globe of mist (festering hag in unrest), water ring (aqua goblin tidal lord in dagnor's),  ring of  evoluoy (alligators in cazic), and a sapphire. <BR><BR>

  <B>   Robe of the Elements:</B> Joyce will make a Robe of the Elements if you bring her the following:  fire goblin  skin (solusek), frost goblin skin (from ice goblin elite guards in permafrost), a "Twice-Woven Cloak" (rare drop from faerie guards in faydark), and a scroll of elemental armor.  You may have to give them to her in a specific order. <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="4"><B><I><U>Necromancer Shadowbound Armor:</U></I></B></FONT>  <BR><BR>Syllina will make shadowbound armor for necromancers.  She makes 3 kinds: boots, gloves and a robe.  In addition, she will tell you how to make shadow silk for 50gp.  This is made through the tailoring skill, so you either have to learn tailoring or have to buy it from a tailor.  I keep getting conflicting reports on which sceptor she wants for which quest.  I think that it is set to vary randomly from person to person and she will ask for a different sceptor each time.  Best bet is to ask her first.  The scepters need to be identified to see which one they are, and they seem to appear in both Mistmoore and Guk.  I have also been told that you need to give her the items in the order she lists them, but can't confirm this. <BR><BR>

<B>     ShadowBound Boots:  </B>shadow silk, sceptre of sorrow (from Mistmoore), eye of shadow (from shadow men), and a skeletal toe (from giant skeletons in rathe mntns)<BR><BR>

<B>     Robe of Enshroudment:</B>  large shadow silk, werebat wing (from unrest), mask of shadow (shadowmen), and  globe of shadow (Nokta Shaman in guk).  <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="4"><U><I><B>Wizard Items:</B></I></U></FONT>  <BR><BR>Gardern and Vilissia will make several items for wizards: <BR><BR>

  <B>   Staff of Temperate Flux: </B> (Gardern)  He needs a Heart of Fire from an Inferno Goblin Warlock in the
     Caverns of Solusek, a Heart of Frost from a Goblin Wizard in the Caverns of Permafrost, a Rod of Bone from  a Stone Skeleton by the shores of Lake Rathe and a Staff of Ro. <BR><BR>
     <B>Weeping Wand:</B>  (Gardern)  He needs a Silver Wand (from a silvered guard in Cazic), A Bloodback Wand  (from giant skeletons in Mount Rathe), Twice-Woven Silk (from fairies), and a Scepter of Sorrow (from the  Tomb in Castle Mistmoore).  I have been told that you will need to pick up the flower (looks like a bag) in the tomb house (the one  where you can fall down through two trap holes) in graveyard, then ive the  flower to  the named shadowed man Ssynthi right behind the tomb house and he will then give you a scepter of  sorrows.   Bring them all back and get the weeping wand. <BR><BR>
