<b>Well, this is it! What you've been trained for. Well, sort of.</b> <BR><BR>

When you start, a bugman and a apeman are headed right at you. you're only given 1 fire arrow and 1 gas arrow to start, unless you're on expert then you have a water and moss also. <BR>
If you hide they will walk right past you into the portal behind you. The area ahead is full of bugmen and a couple craymen. <BR>There are gas arrows all over so don't hold back if you need to drop some bad guys. Head down and to the left, all the way as far as the path takes you. You'll exit the purple caves and enter an area of rocks and lava flows. Follow the path into the area, you'll notice you seem to be on a circuar platform, but if you look off the north side, you'll see a ledge you can drop down to. <BR>
<BR>There are several water arrows near the blue crystal formations but do <b>NOT</b> touch the blue crystals. <BR><BR>
<i>Remember if you're playing on expert, you have to close the portal, so keep one of each of the following until it's time to use them. 1 fire arrow, 1 water arrow, 1 moss arrow, and 1 gas arrow. </i><BR>
There is a steep snow covered slope, filled with these crystals so be sure to save at the top, and before you hit the bottom of that hill, run backwards to slow yourself. <BR><BR>
There is a small area with elementals, followed by another ski trip. After that you'll see a big blue crystal. It's actually a well, jump into the waterfall and go with the flow, but don't forget to step out for a breather. When you reach the final pool, look down. You're actually hovering over the well. you have to aim your drop to go thru the center of it. <BR>
When you dry off, you'll see something really big. Circle around it to the right, there will be an opening for you to enter it when you've gone about half way around. <BR>
Mantle up and use rope arrows if you can't mantle until you reach the top. (or just climb the sparkly thing, i'm told it's a ladder)<BR><BR>
Next you'll pass thru the spider area, i suggest...running like hell forward and to the right. <BR><BR>
The path is pretty straight from here, next up, destroying the <a href="http://home.mpinet.net/ghostboy/portal.jpg">portal</a> that the monsters are going thru. 
(see picture diagram)<BR>
Kill each of the elements with its opposite. Fire for water, water for fire, gas (air) for plants (earth) and moss for air. <BR>
From here it's just a shot distance to the ritual site. (hope you brought a few moss arrows along) <BR><BR>
Fire moss arrows to cover a path from you to the eye, when Constantine turns his back to you, run up, grab it, and get out of sight til he finishes the ritual. <BR><BR>

<b>Enjoy =] The final cutscene is one of the best in the game.</b><br><br>
