You start outside the mansion.<BR><BR>

Head around to your left. Fire a rope arrow up and climb up to the balcony, pick the lock and enter. <BR><BR>
<i>(alternate to entry)</i><BR>
I had a problem where it wouldn't let me pick the lock where i know i had been able to before. So heading back to the main gate, blackjack (or kill) the guard wandering outside. He carries a pouch (100 gold). There is 1 guard patrolling the main hall and one in a guard room off to the right of the main door. I found i was able to take down the one in the guard room with an arrow and then pick off the one in the hallway who has a key to the balcony door. Altho this is dumb, since you can now enter thru the main door LOL. <BR>

<P>For Expert level, if you can't pick the balcony lock, you also can't kill these guards. Knock out the wanderer outside, then douse the torch in the guard room so he can't see much. Use a moss arrow near the door and pickpocket the key from the guard as he passes by. You may even be able to knock him out. On expert level, buy as many moss arrows and water arrows as you can at the start, they are your best friends. <BR>
<BR>
<b>The Sword</b><BR>

<P>To get to the sword, move to the second floor by way of the Eastern staircase. Once in the hallway, use one of the guards keys on the double doors to your right and climb that set of stairs. Move along the hallway until you reach a tiled area. The guards really pick up around here, the sword is close. Look to your left, there will be a vine hanging out of a passage, climb up that and jump into the tunnel. There will be 2 guards talking at the top so don't rush. Put out the local torches ahead of you, and the guards won't even notice the bodies in the shadows as you do away with their friends. <BR>
<P>Once the area is clear of guards, step to ledge, the sword is very visible. Shoot a rope arrow into one of the beams over the sword, making sure you can jump onto and off of it, while still being able to grab the sword from your rope (might require some practice) Grab your prize and exit the way you came in. <BR>

<P>Constantines Info (expert level) In the garden, in the north section of the mansion, head toward the west end. There will be several guards patrolling the area. Just to the east of the large tree (surrounded by water) there is a passage heading south, a locked door marks the correct hallway( there is a bit of loot in this room). Head south and then sharply east again. You will be in a greenhouse, with a stairway ending in a locked door. This door can only be opened by the <a href="http://home.mpinet.net/ghostboy/key.jpg">key</a> found in Constantines bedroom (level 2, east end) on the floor next to the bed. There is a <a href="http://home.mpinet.net/ghostboy/key.jpg">screenshot</a> of how well the key blends with the floor, so look good. 
Behind this locked door is the information you are looking for.  <BR>

<P>While there are certainly more ways to accomplish gaining the sword, this is probably the easiest, feel free to discover the other ways for yourself : )<BR><BR>

Loot in this level is abundant, there's something on a table or in a chest in almost every room and check all guards for pouches.  <BR><BR>
