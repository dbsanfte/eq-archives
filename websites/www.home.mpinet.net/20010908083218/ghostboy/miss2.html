Hit the beach! and swim through the tunnel, make sure you pick up the diamond (35 gem) in the water on the way. <BR>
<P>Approach the crosspath with the flies hovering over the corpse, make a right and you'll find 150 in gold sitting on the floor. Continue following this path until it crosses another. Make a right into the "generator" room. Turn to your right and jump into the small shaft and follow it. There is a room with 3 corpses on the ground, 1 is a zombie so hurry past him and continue up the path. <BR>
<P>Climb out onto the ledge (on the left)just after the jump, follow the ledge to the left and jump across to the the gem (50 gold). Jump back to where you came from and mantle up 3 times and proceed up the hill to the 3rd level. <BR>
<P>Avoiding falling into the elevator shaft and outrunning the zombies, follow the hallway straight ahead and make the first left. This leads to the old temple, there is a holy water font, a vial of holy water next to it, and some loot in a "shelf", a candlestick (50 gold) and a gem (75 gold)<BR>
<P>Go back to the elevator shaft. Walk west. When you see the "factory ===>" sign, turn right and follow the tracks. Ahead of you is a ladder, climb it and jump off onto the ledge, in an alcove are 3 gems (total 200 gold)
Climb back down the ladder and follow the opening next to it, keep heading north until you get to an iron door. Open it and move in slow and quiet. There is a guard pacing, deal with him and move on. Climb the stairs to the elevator, go up. You're now in the factory section. <BR>
<P>The hallway splits up after a wooden door, follow the sign to the factory by heading left. Stay on the catwalk until you get to the northwest corner. A factory worker and a guard will be in the area, but if you're fast you can jump from the catwalk and head north without being seen. The path leads to a pair of guards chatting, be patient and move past them when they get done. Follow the signs to cell block 4 where Cutty is being held, get a key from one of the guards alone the way. In the room following the cell block directory signs, there is a motion detector spinning on the roof. If you can see it, it can see you. Move when it's facing away from you and in a manner which the guard won't detect (providing he's still standing).<BR><BR>
<b>**Trick**</b><i> Shoot the motion detector with a broadhead and it will break, but it will alert the guard so deal with him first</i><BR>
<BR>Cutty is in cell 6. Evade or kill the guards and get into the control booth. Directions on how to work the levers are below. <BR><BR>

<b>How cell levers work.</b><BR><BR>

bottom   top<BR>
2 . .1 . . . .7<BR>
4 . .3 . . . .8<BR>
6 . .5 . . . .9<BR>
. . . . . . . .10<BR><BR>
 
2, 4, 6 lever left=closed-- right=open<BR>
1, 3, 5 lever right=closed-- left=open<BR>
7-10    lever right=closed-- left=open<BR><BR>

Basically think of the lever pattern as a map of the cells.<BR> The above pattern is reversed for cell blocks 2 and 3<BR>

<P>Basso the boxman is located in cell block 3, cell 4. If you're playing on Hard or Expert you'll have to get him out of the prison. You have a couple choices. Leave him where he is and get him on the way out, grab him and get him all the way out, or stash him somewhere convenient to get on the way out. What you do with him is up to you, directions for the way out will be near the end of this chapters walk through. <BR><BR>
Issyt is located in cell block 1, cell 9. <BR>
<P>By now you're objectives have changed.  You have to go higher into the compound and find the evidence locker. Well you're in luck, the way to get there is thru cell block 1 and thats where you should be (if you're following this anyway)<BR>
<P>Head north out of cell block 1 and up the stairs. you'll come to a temple area with 2 guards and 2 other people. All are easy enough to avoid. To your left will be a room through which you can see a stained glass window. (By the window there are 2 candlesticks (50 gold each), and a golden hammer (75 gold each) on each of the pedestals there.) Straight ahead (of where you start) is a hallway, follow this hall, avoiding the guard doing his rounds. In the first room on the right is a chest containing 100 gold. In the second room there are some broadhead arrows in the chest.<BR>
<P>Back to the stained glass window. On the other side, there are 2 priests talking, there is a vial of holy water and a gold hammer (75 gold) on the table. The priest in red has a key you may need, unless you can find another silver key somewhere. Head south and go up the stairs.  The hallway will split, a door to the left and right. <BR>
<P>The door to the right is a small shrine, one wall has a safe which holds a diamond (100 gem),a healing potion and a piece of jewelry (100 gold, 100 gems). <BR>
<P>To the left is an office, in the safe there is some jewelry (75 gold, 50 gems) and a diamond (50 gems) along with Felix's notes.<BR>
<P>Now that you have the plans, if you're on Hard or Expert, you still have work to do. Nammon stole some things from the evidence locker. His body is near the guard station where the hall breaks to cells 3 and 4. On the wall where the guard paces, there is a waist high hole. Crouch down and crawl through and have a look around. <BR>
<P>Once you've got your evidence and Basso's body, you're ready to get out of this place. The easiest way out is via the river that runs along behind the guard room. Grab Basso and jump in. Follow it as far as you can, it should lead into the top level of the mines. Locate the elevator and call it up by pressing the top button. Take it down to the 3rd level and follow the cart tracks off to the left. <BR><BR>

<b>**Note**</b><i> Not all treasure is noted here, but there is enough to finish the level on any setting. </i><BR><BR>
