This mission starts off simple enough, but as you round the first corner that all changes. First order of business is to search the area for extra gear. There are arrows all over and some flashbombs in the guard room to the right. <BR>
<P><i>The first time you attack a bugman, your objectives will update and you'll be forced to kill all of them. Knocking them out won't do, if they fall down make sure they stay down.</i> <BR><BR>
Head to the temple area, the altar has been opened and you need to head into the cellar. <BR><BR>
Keep in mind there is a few flash bombs, 2 healing potions and assorted stuff (not much) downstairs.<BR><BR>

Once you are down under the altar, there are a few critters roaming about, your goal is a ramp heading down at the scene of a battle. (remember this spot for later if you play on expert)<BR><BR>

Go down the ramp, you'll be in a room with a pit in the center, There is a door on the far side leading down into the pit. After you head down into the pit, go straight across the walkway, there is a jump into no where for a gas arrow, a water pool with a water arrow, and a staircase going down. At the bottom of the stairs is where the Hammers are being held. Walk up to the window and one will speak and tell you what you need to do. If you are on expert (maybe hard also), you'll need to get the builders chisel as one of the new objectives. This can be found at the top of the ramp (i told you to remember that spot) and past the point where the ramp goes down. It is guarded by one of those nasty web shooting spiders. <BR>
<P>The Hammers also give you a key and a map, the key is for a door at the bottom of the first ramp. The map is a map of the lower levels. <BR>
The High priest is located in the only room with 3 apemen standing around a fire. He is on top of a bush in the back of the room. <BR>
The easiest way to get him to where he needs to be is, go back out the way you came (only 1 exit from the room)go thru the door on the left, duck under and go left past the flies by the door. You should be in a room with 1 apemen and a locked door on the wall. The blue key the Hammers gave you also works on this door and it leads directly to the place you need to drop the body, When you drop it, check your objectives, the high priest and chisel objectives should be done. <BR>
<BR>All that is left is the bugmen unless you killed them all by now. There are 4 bugs total. 1 in the temple when you first came in. 1 in the pit after the first ramp. 1 just past the first locked door, and 1 in the lower area (you have to go by him to get to the locked door).<BR>

<P>A side note. Sometimes to get the objectives to click in, you have to either take the raft down the small river or swim down, the chisel objective wasn't checked until i went down that way. <BR><BR>
<b>Total loot</b>:100<BR>Lower level, in one of the priests rooms.<BR><BR>
