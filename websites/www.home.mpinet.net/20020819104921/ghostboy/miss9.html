There are 2 ways to finish this level. The normal way, and the super easy way. I'll put the easy way first, because it takes up less room. <BR><BR>

First, a tip about the Haunts, (the sword wielding dead Hammerites) they can be backstabbed. <BR><BR>
<b>RTC, the easy way. </b><BR><BR>

At the front door, place each talisman in it's respective holder. <BR>
The eye will talk to you when you place the first one. Look just to the left of the entrance way and pick up the rib bones on the ground. After the doors open, place the rib cage and the skull by the door just inside to keep the door from closing again. <BR><BR>
<i>If you don't do this, once you step inside the doors will lock and then you're stuck doing it the hard way.</i><BR><BR>
 Once the door is propped open, go inside and to the right. Follow the hallway thru 2 doors, this will put you in the main chapel. Be very quiet, there is a sleeping zombie to your right. Shoot a rope arrow to the beam above and climb to the second floor. Pick the lock on the door (to the north) and go through. Shoot a rope arrow about halfway between you and the eye, jump onto the rope and grab the eye. Jump back to the ledge you came from and head back to the front door using the second level. You can jump down to the first floor where you origionally went right. <BR><BR>
<i>My best time, 4:27 . See if you can beat it =] </i><BR><BR>

<b>RTC, the normal way. </b><BR><BR>

First i must say, get as much loot as possible from Undercover, and load up on fire arrows, mines, flash bombs and water arrows. <BR><BR>

From the start, place each talisman in it's respective holder. The doors will open, step inside. <BR>
You have a choice of where to go or what to do first. You may want to turn the power on first, or grab the eye. 
A few notes. You can take out an undead guard (with the swords) with a backstab. If you're quick you can take out all 3 from the cathedral area fairly easy. <BR>
<P>The power generator is in the basement. Head to the NorthWest part of the cathedral, out the door under the eye, and to the left. Go down the stairs, there is a apparition and a zombie wandering around down there, so walk quietly. If you end up in a courtyard you went out the wrong door. <BR>
<P>Ok, should you decide to grab thr eye first (altho i suggest removing some critters first, you can leave the zombies an just outrun them.) If you have more than 3 flashbombs, you can clear the temple area, hang on the rope over the eye, all of the undead will gather beneath you. drop 3 or 4 flashbombs and they should all die. <BR>
<P>On your way to the Cloister gate (where it says to exit from in the cutscene) you'll run into Brother Murus, a ghostly figure just outside of the cathedrals back door. <BR>
He needs some help passing on to the other side, and you'll feel obliged to help him soon enough. If you haven't explored before you meet him, he'll have you do several things in this order. <BR><BR>
<i>1 Find his rosary beads. <BR>
2 Get hit prayer book. 
3 Make a holy symbol. <BR>
4 Find his candle. <BR>
5 Meet him in the graveyard to perform the ritual to help him leave.<BR>
<i>These are for expert level only, possibly hard too</i><BR>
6 Find and bury the bodies of 2 of his brothers.<BR>
7 And, the kicker, kill all of the Hammer haunts left in the area.</i><BR><BR> 
<b>
Brother Renault will tell you about the mural in the Winter tunnels, there is a <a href="http://home.mpinet.net/ghostboy/secret_button.jpg">secret button</a> in the top right corner.</b><BR><BR>
After this he will give you a key, or it may be near his grave, to the attic where your method of escape awaits.<BR><BR> 
The rosary beads are located in a chest on the second level in St. Yora's. <BR><BR>
The book is on the second level of St. Vales library. <BR>
I used the small table near the door to jump off of then mantle to the second level. Or you can use a rope arrow. <BR><BR>
The factory is in St. Tennor's. Find the holy symbol mold and follow the directions on the wall for making it. (remember to drop it into the holy font in the top of St. Jenel's)<BR><BR>
The candle is located on top of the shed behind St Tennor's. You can go out the chute there, or climb over the wall by the graveyard.  <BR><BR>
Brother Renault's body is in a locked door in the basement of the cathedral. Brother Martello is on the east side on the second level. <BR><BR><BR>
