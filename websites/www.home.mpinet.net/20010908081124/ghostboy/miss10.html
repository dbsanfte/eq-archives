There are only 2 objectives here, regardless of what level you play on, find info on Constantine, and get out alive. <BR><BR>

One is easier than the other, the info is a lot easier than getting out of this maze in 1 piece, but i'll try to help.<BR><BR>

From where you start, half dead and unequipped, move to the altar ahead of you, grab the gear there and get ready to move. Head out the only door you can, but be quiet as you go down the steps. <BR>
In the room that follows, is a nice stash of weapons, once you can reach them. Move to the edge of the platform and shoot a rope arrow near the big window in front of you. Get a good running start and jump to it, climbing in quickly. There is an assortment of mines and arrows there, you can also lean out and grab the gas arrow outside the window. Use the gas arrow on the bugman outside (unless you prefer other methods) and use your choice of weapons on the apemen. <BR>
<P>When the coast is clear climb down (take the rope arrow with you) and walk to your right. There is a fire arrow in the brazier and a moss arrow on the ramp. There is a fruit on the floor in the next room, it will heal you 2 points. <BR>
<P>Head thru the door to the North. Collect the water arrows from the vertical pool and then go down the other passage. There are jumping spiders here so be ready. Take the first left, then another left immediately. At the end of this tunnel is a tree house guarded by a couple bugmen and a frog (beware the frog!) In this house is the information on Constantine. <BR>
<P>Now to get out. From the main entry (the room with the weapons near the start, there is a half size opening to the left of the window (while facing it) Thru that passageway you'll see an apeman, who is in the way for most things you'll want to do. When you get rid of him, there is another fruit and a fire arrow where he was pacing. Farther down that hall there is a vertical pool with several fire arrows and a spider. To the right of the little guy you just killed is a large area with a treehouse. <BR>
<P>If you put out the 2 torches in that room, your chances improve dramatically. There is a small room on the left wall perfect for whacking critters from the darkness. When you feel the area is clear enough use a rope arrow to go into the tree, there are some mines and arrows in there. There is also a fruit on the floor near the far door. You should be feeling much better by now. <BR>
<P>There will be 3 or 4 apemen, a bugman and a couple elementals patrolling this and the next 2 rooms, getting thru them without removing almost all of them is near impossible. Move on, the way all the apemen came in the room. There will be a elemental guarding soem arrows there, thru one of the exits you can see another treehouse. Get to it and grab the gear. Head out the large opening and turn left. This is the start of the exit of the mansion. There will be several critters blocking our way out but i'll leave that to you. <BR>
<P>You should come to a metal ramp that leads to another one and a door past that. This leads to the first floor of the mansion. You come out on the North East stairway. To get directly out, head out of the stairwell to the left (South) and the front door is just around the corner. <BR>

<BR>Any looting you choose to do past this is up to you, thats how you get out =]  I suggest getting at least 2000 in loot to load up for the next mission. <BR><BR>
