<td>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was at the shrine trying to take some nice snap shots.&nbsp;
This was while the usual inhabitants (mummies and skeletons) were away
from home.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; I got attacked in the middle of my shoot and
the camera was broken.&nbsp; I almost defeated the skeleton that was attacking
me, but I ran to a nearby Dwarven Paladin for assistance.&nbsp; However
he seemed to be daydreaming as I was soon laying @ his feet.&nbsp; I got
the above picture when I returned and <a href="skelshrine_defeat.jpg">finished
off the skeleton.</a></td>
