<body>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Orcs in the Lesser Faydark are tougher
than your average Orc found in the Greater Faydark.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You usually only find them in or near their camps,
they don't wander much.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are dressed in a Yellow tunic, but I have yet
to learn what this signifies.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be extra careful of the orc camp near the Elven Outpost.&nbsp;
It has a high potential for trains, and the train usally has a Legionaire
in it - this is deadly for most travels who normally feel safe in the Lesser
Faydark.&nbsp; If you have the misfortune of trigging, or being nearby
when one of these is triggered I strongly advise you to take cover in the
elven outpost.&nbsp; This doesn't guarentee your safetly, as the guards
are only so strong and there are only so many of them.&nbsp; If you are
lucky, you can duck into one of the buildings and leave the orcs outside
with the Guard.&nbsp; You're unlucky if an orc stinks in with you and the
guards are on the other side of the door.
