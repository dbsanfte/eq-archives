<td>I first travelled through the Lesser Faydark on route to Ak'anon, the
home city of the Gnomes.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an uneventful trip on the way
there, and I stopped in for lunch @ the Gnomish Observatory.&nbsp;
<br>The trip home was a little bit more adventurous.&nbsp; I got lost,
and was chased by an Orc, I was luck to make it out alive.
<br>I had my first look at the <a href="../bestiary/faedrakes.html">Fae
Drakes</a> this trip as well.</td>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;March-Jun/3173&nbsp;</td>

<td>I spend a lot of time exploring and mapping the area.&nbsp;
<br>I saw the great unicorn, <a href="../beastiary/unicorns.html">Equestrielle</a>
- what a magnificent sight.
<br>I also encounted some awful undead - skelton's and Mummies.&nbsp; I
was diseased with Rabies from the Mummy for a while.
<br>I also made many visits to the Elven Outpost.&nbsp; To take protection
from the guards posted there, and to sell my loot to the nice Half-Elf
merchant there.</td>

<td>I received word from the Gods that there would be a terrible storm
and that all should stay in shelter if they could.&nbsp; I made camp in
under a quiet tree and stayed, resting for a long while.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Late Oct/3173</td>

<td>Something was up with the faeries.&nbsp; They were particularily hostile
towards me and I was forced to defend myself from 2 of the maidens.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Nov/3173</td>

<td>My film seems to have not developed for a # of the pictures I took
on this trip.&nbsp; It is very disappointing, but I'll have to try to reclaim
the photos on another journey.&nbsp; Safe travels to you.</td>
