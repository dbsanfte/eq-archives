<P><b>This is a special page about hockey, which is one of the best sports ever made.  Hockey is one of Canada's most famous and popular sports ever.  Every year there is a trophy called the Stanley cup that is rewarded to the NHL team that wins this playoff.  At this time there are only two teams left in the playoffs, Colorado and Florida.  At this time, Colorado leads the series 3-0.</P>

<P>I have a friend that plays in the NHL for the Ottawa Senators, because of knowing him, I've found out how difficult it is to play a sport at such an intense level.  His life is practically all hockey and if he has anytime left over, he can relax or do things with his friends.  He doesn't even get the summers off for he practices all year round, he knows that if he takes too long of a break that he will get out of shape and it will be harder to get back on track when the normal season starts up in the fall.

<P>I love watching hockey but I don't think that I would ever be really good at it.  It's a sport that I find is better to watch.  It's better watching the people who are good at it and know what they are doing and are good at it.  I think that I would probably spoil the game because I like fast action filled games and I couldn't play at that level.</P>

<P>My favorite team in the NHL is the Ottawa Senators.  Although they don't always look as if they are trying their hardest, it is really hard to go out there and play the game. Ottawa is still a very recent team and is still adapting to everything.  The good thing about Ottawa is that they are one of the only teams that still plays like a team, rather than one or two players getting extensive treatment.</P>
