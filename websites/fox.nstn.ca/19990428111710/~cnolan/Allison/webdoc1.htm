<strong>     Figure Skating is one of the most watched sports on
television today.  It has increased around 200% since four or
five years ago when nobody seemed to want to watch it at all.  I
started liking figure skating when I was about seven or eight
years old, after the Calgary Olympics I loved it.  I liked figure
skating so much, that I began to take skating lessons when I was
about eight or nine.  I progressed well in the sport and even
competed once in a local competition.</strong>

<p><strong>     I'm 16 now and I haven't skated in over 3 years do to
medical problems. I still miss being on the ice at 7:00 am and
practicing for all of those hours.  Unfortunately I can't skate
anymore so all I can do is watch it.  Personally, I find figure
skating to be one of the most beautiful sports in the world to
watch.  I really enjoy watching other people skate even though I
can't anymore.</strong>

<p><strong>     One of my favorite male
figure skaters ever is Kurt
Browning.  Even though Kurt never
won an Olympic title, I still
believe that he is one of the best
male skaters ever.  </strong>

Ekaterina Gordeeva &amp; Sergei Grinkov <br>
</strong>

<p><strong><img src="webdoc1.htg/g&g2.jpg" width="291" height="340" align="left" BORDER="0" >     My favorite pair skaters
are Ekaterina Gordeeva and
Sergei Grinkov.  Together
Ekaterina, known as Katia and
her husband Sergei won two
Olympic gold medals and four
World titles.  Their lives was
known to many as the perfect
fairy tale, but unfortunately
that changed.</strong>

<p><strong>     On November 20th 1995 while
training with his wife in Lake
Placid, N.Y., for the Stars on
Ice show, Grinkov complained of
dizziness.  The two of them had
just completed a lift, and Katia
helped Sergei to sit on the ice. 
Then suddenly he fell backward,
unconscious.  Katia started
screaming. The paramedics
responded in minutes, and
doctors at the Adirondack
Medical Center worked on Sergei for more than an hour.  "He was
dead the moment he hit the ice, he felt no pain," says Dr. Josh
Schwartzberg.  The autopsy later showed that Sergei's heart was
enlarged, probably from high blood pressure, and that his left
anterior descending coronary artery was virtually closed.  Sergei
had probably had a "silent" heart attack within the previous 24
hours.  One that caused him no pain but unfortunately could have
saved his life for it started a fatal heart rhythm.</strong>

<p><strong>     When Dr. Schwartzberg came to tell Katia that Sergei was
dead, Katia was devastated.  Her grief was so powerful.  She
wanted to go in and be with Sergei. When she went into the room
where Sergei lay she started speaking Russian to him very gently,
in a soft and affectionate way.  Before Katia left, she unlaced
Sergei's skates and gently removed them from his feet.  She was
talking to Sergei, telling him that everything will be okay and
that she would always love him.</strong>

<p><strong>     They were a pair of mismatched children thrown together by
the Soviet Union at age 15 and 11.  They grew up to become the
most celebrated pairs skaters ever and along the way they fell
madly in love with each other.  When the two won the gold medal
at the Calgary Olympics, friends say that Katia already knew she
was in love with Sergei even though she was just 16 at the time. 
Although it took her a while to win him over because he was a
young man who wanted to explore his options.  During a
competition in Germany, Sergei began to see Katia in a different
light.  That's when he confided in his sister Natasha, how
beautiful Katia had become.  After that Sergei and Katia started
to spend as much time as they could together.</strong>

<p><strong>     Katia and Sergei were married in Moscow on April 21, 1991,
and from that point on they never skated like any other pair had
ever before.   In the last years they skated better and better. 
It was probably because everything was perfect; they loved each
other and they loved their daughter Daria.</strong>

<p><strong>     The arrival of Daria or "Dasha" as they called her, changed
their lives dramatically.  Scott Hamilton says, "They didn't
become one person until Dasha was born."  When Sergei and Katia
introduced Daria to the ice, Sergei would hold her down close
between his legs as he was skating. When they put skates on Daria
she though that she would glide along like her parents, but her
first fall was traumatic.  After the fall Daria didn't want to
skate anymore but now she is very good.</strong>

<p><strong>     Since this traumatizing day, Katia has had to raise her 4
year old daughter by herself.  She didn't think that she would
ever skate again but she did a tribute to Sergei at the Hartford
arena in Hartford, Conn, U.S.A..  Most of Katia's close skating
friends were there to give their tribute and to say their
goodbyes.  Some of the skaters, like Kurt Browning, Katterina
Witt and Scott Hamilton gave the money that they made from the
event to help Katia now that she can't do the only thing that
ever came so easily to her, she can't skate with Sergei.</strong>

<p><strong>     It's hard to think of any
happy thought about this because
you can't help but feel such loss
for Katia because Katia and
Sergei were soul mates.  She had to say goodbye to her partner in
everything before she was ready.  The only happy thing about this
incident is that the last thing Sergei saw was Katia in her
landing position, which was everything that they had worked for
since they had been children in Moscow.<img src="webdoc1.htg/russia2.jpg" width="300" height="270" align="left" BORDER="0" ><img src="webdoc1.htg/g&g.jpg" width="294" height="337" align="right" BORDER="0" >  Sergei was buried in the
Vagankovskoye Cemetery in Moscow a few days after his death.</strong>
