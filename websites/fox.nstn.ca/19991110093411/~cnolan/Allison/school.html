<P><B>I am a student at Carleton Place High School.  C.P.H.S. is the only high school in the small town of Carleton Place, Ontario.  There are approximately 850 students that attend my school and around 200 of these are grade nine students.</P>

<P>I have been a student at C.P.H.S. for two years now, and I am now in grade 10.  C.P.H.S. is a small quiet school with a small staff and few kids.  One of the benifits of attending a small school is that you get to know who everybody is. A down to this is that not all of the people are very friendly.  Therefore it can be hard to be polite to people you don't really know that well somtimes.</P> 

<P>C.P.H.S. is a very spirited school, we always support our teams and our teachers.  Earlier this year when some of our teachers were going to be laid of, we, the students had our own rally and protest to this.  We refused to go back to school until they hired back at least some of our teachers.</B>
