<h2><a  NAME="A1.1"><b><font SIZE=+1>IntroductionC++ is one of the most
versitile if not the most versitile of all languages. It is a language
that you can use to do just about any tast you want to with your computer.
Where you view it has a high-level assembler language or a low-level structured
language it doesn't matter. It is the best there is (for now). In the collection
you will learn the basics of the language. You will have the opportunity
to learn of other reasources, mostly off-line that will help you on your
way to becoming a master programmer. I hope to make frequent updates to
the file as I have time to do so.
<br>I started this document because I can remember when I wanted to learn
the language and did not have a consise introduction at hand. Sure you
can fork out <i>$40</i> for a beginners book, but that is a little hard
to do just have you paid a couple hundred for the software. I hope you
enjoy this document and find it useful. Good day. </font></b>
<h2><a  NAME="A1.2"><b><font SIZE=+1>Very brief History of the language
C++ is an extension or superset of C. C has its foundations in BCPL, and
then through Ken Thompson's B. With the advent of Object Oriented programming
one Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup decided that he need a language to work in. So
around 1980 at AT&amp;T Bell Labs he started his work and decided to just
add on to the already well excepted and machine independent. </font></b>
<h2><a  NAME="A1.3"><b><font SIZE=+1>Your first program!The following is
the first program you should write because it is the simpliest and smallest.
</font></b>
<pre><b><font SIZE=+1>main()
{
}</font></b>
</pre>
<b><font SIZE=+1>There it is. Was that hard?
<br>That is what is called the main function. It is needed in every program
and it is the first thing executed next to the precompiler directives (more
on them a little later).
