<p><strong>     This is a page about Irish dancing.  Irish dancing is a
traditional type of dancing that originates from Ireland.  There
are two different types of dances that the dancers perform, there
are hard shoe dances and soft shoe dances.  Soft shoes are some
what common to highland shoes and cost approximately $40.00 to
$50.00 brand new.  The hard shoes look like shoes that
leprechauns where and they cost approximately $180.00 to $200.00
brand new (these are in Canadian prices).  The dancers are
required to wear special dresses when competing in competitions. 
There are school dresses which every dancer must have.  All the
school dresses from one dance school have to be identical.  There
are also solo dresses which you can have that are only for solo
dances.  You don't usually get solo dresses until you are at
least the Novice level.  All dancers must also have their hair
curled in ringlets and out of their face at competitions, this is
very traditional. </strong>

<p><strong>     There are many different soft shoe dances.  There are dances
that you do by yourself (called solo dances) and dances that you
do in groups (called figure dances).   There are five different
types of solo dances, the reel, the jig, the slip jig or the
light jig, the treble jig and the horn pipe, there are also set
dances which you can do but they are forms of the above dances. 
The horn pipe and the treble jig are hard shoe dances.  There are
many different figure dances that can be done and these dances
are done in soft shoes.  They are done in reels, jigs and slip
jigs that change depending on the creativity of the dancers or
the number of dancers.  There are 2 hand, 3 hand, 6 hand and 8
hand dances that are performed.</strong>

<p><strong>I found out about Irish Dancing about a year and a half ago.  I
watched some dancers and decided that I wanted to do it. I am now
an Irish dancer.  I joined the Kathleen Coyle School of Irish
Dancing in October 1995 and I have been dancing ever since.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>       I am off to Montreal on May 17th to compete in the
Montreal Feis.  This will be my fifth competition and I hope that
I do well.  I also have a competition the next day in Ottawa,
it's called the Capital Feis.  I will be doing five solo dances
at each competition, a 4 hand reel at each competition, a 2 hand
dance at each competition, an 8 hand in Ottawa and a 6 hand in
Montreal.  In case you don't understand, an 8 hand dance means a
dance with eight people, a 4 hand dance means a dance with four
people and so on.</strong>

<p><strong>     In total from my four previous competitions, I have 16
medals.  I won 5 medals in last years Feis in Ottawa, 4 medals in
last years Feis in Montreal, 4 medals in last years Feis in
Syracuse, and 3 medals in last years Feis in Watertown.</strong>
