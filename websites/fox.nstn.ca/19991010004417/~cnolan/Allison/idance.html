<P><B>This is a page about Irish dancing.  Irish dancing is a traditional type of dancing that originates from Ireland.  There are two different types of dances that the dancers perform, there are hard shoe dances and soft shoe dances.  Soft shoes are some what common to highland shoes and cost approximately $80.00 brand new.  The hard shoes look identical to the that of the little Irish leprechaun and they cost approximately $200.00 brand new.The dancers are required to wear special dresses when competing in a competition.  All dancers must also have their hair curled in ringlets and out of their face. </P>
<P>When doing soft shoes there are dances that you do by yourself(solo dances)and dances that you do in groups(figures).   There are five different types of solo dances, the reel, the jig, the slip jig or the light jig, the treble jig and the horn pipe.  The horn pipe and the treble jig are hard shoe dances.  There are many different figure dances that can be done.  They are reels, jigs and slip jigs that change depending on the creativity of the dancers or the number of dancers.  There are 2 hand, 3 hand, 6 hand and 8 hand dances that are performed.</P>

<P>I am an  Irish dancer and I am off to Montreal on May 18th to compete, this will be my first competion and I hope that I do well.  I also have a competition the next day in Ottawa, at Confederation High School of Merivelle.  I will be doing four solo dances, a 3 hand reel and a six hand jig in Montreal and four solos, 4 hand jig and and 8 hand jig in Ottawa.</P>

<P>I recently competed in two competions in Ottawa and Montreal.  I placed 2nd in my reel and my slip jig, 4th in my jig and 1st in my 6 hand.  In all of the dances I competed in, in Montreal, there were at least 15 to 20 competitors that I was competing against.  In Ottawa I placed 3rd in my reel, slip jig and jig, 1st in my 4 hand and 8 hand. There were at least 10 to 12 competitors in each of the competitions that competed in.</P>
