<h1 align="center"><strong>Personal Information</strong></h1>

<p align="center"><strong><hr>

     My name is Allison Tovell.  I live in Carleton Place,
Ontario, CANADA.  I have lived in Carleton Place my whole life
but I plan to live somewhere else when I'm older.</strong>

<p><strong>      I am 16 years old and I attend Carleton Place High School
in my small town of Carleton Place, Ontario.  I plan to be a
physiotherapist, a pilot or to go in to graphic design after a
graduate from High School. </strong>

<p><strong>     I have one sister named Stephanie who is currently attending
Ottawa University for a Degree in English.  I have four cats, 3
male and 1 female.  The male cats names are Morrissey, Fek'lhr
and Marmalade and the female cat's name is Odessa. I love all of
my cats very much.</strong>

<p><strong>     My best friend's name is Lisa Parker, she lives in Greely,
Ontario.  We live quite a far piece away from each other but we
see each other a lot because we dance together.  Seeing as how we
are both in the midst of getting our driver's license, we will
soon be able to do things together more often.</strong>

<p><strong>   In the future, I hope to be able to travel to England and
Bermuda to visit some of my relatives which I have never met.  I
hope someday to make it to Ireland to compete in the World Irish
Dancing Championships, I hope to visit Finland someday to visit a
good friend I haven't seen in a long time.  I would love to be
able to travel all of the world but I know that will never
happen.</strong>
