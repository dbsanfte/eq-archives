		<div align="justify"><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#303030">** New and Changed Features **<BR><BR>- Guild Message of the Day.  Guild Officers and Leaders will be able to type /guildmotd <text> to set up a Guild Message of the Day (GMotD).  From then on any time a member of that guild logs in they will see the message with the name of the message sender added at the front, so you will know who sent the message.  Any guild member will also be able to read the GMotD by typing just /guildmotd and the message will be displayed again.  The GMotD will be erased if the server comes down, however.  You will have to reset the GMotD when the server comes back up.<BR><BR>- /assist changed and improved.  It should be much more reliable now.  It also will target whatever the assisted person has targeted.  The assisted person does not need to have auto-attack on for /assist to work.<BR><BR>- Fixed a problem with /corpse that kept it from working on corpses that were too far above or below you.<BR><BR><BR>** Skill Change **<BR><BR>- Foraging changed so that if you are getting the hungry and thirsty messages, your next successful forage will always be drink or food.  We have also decreased the chance of foraging fishing grubs a bit and increased the chance that you will forage water.<BR><BR><BR>** Spell Changes **<BR><BR>- Acumen now overwrites See Invisible.<BR><BR>- Translocate now has the proper spell gem.<BR><BR><BR>** Bug Fix **<BR><BR>- Fixed many crash problems for Windows 2000 users.  This fix will most likely also aid some folks that are not using Windows 2000 that are having problems.<BR><BR><BR>** Item Changes **<BR><BR>- Velious racial plate helm quests have been added that will allow you to 'trade in' your existing helms for ones with textures.  We have decided to allow the players (or their characters) to chose whether they wish to have the new helmet textures or to continue to use helmets that show no graphics.<BR><BR>- Five and ten charge versions of Potions of the Bone Field have been added.<BR><BR>- Kilva's Skin of Flame potion has been changed.  It no longer has the same effect as the Kilva's Blistering Flesh potion.<BR><BR>- Removed the tinting from Dark Forge and Resonant armors.  Tinting was never really intended to be on those pieces and, frankly, they look better without it.<BR><BR><BR>** Miscellaneous Items **<BR><BR>- Reduced the 'bottleneck' for getting Howling Stone keys by increasing the availability of one of the quest items.<BR><BR>- Erudite guards will now be much less friendly to Kobolds.<BR><BR>- Vendors are once again selling the Coldain Tanner's Kit.<BR><BR><BR>** 'Combine' container changes **<BR><BR>We've made a change to 'combine' containers.  In order to prevent people from accidentally destroying items, all containers with a 'combine' button will not combine any items that do not form a complete recipe.  This will be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath.  But this removes the only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks.  Their reduced weight and often greater carrying capacity made them more desirable as bags, with the compensating risk that you might just lose something if you made a mistake.<BR><BR>We will be increasing the weight of portable 'combine' containers somewhat.  Where some of these containers weighed under 1 pound, they will now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit.<BR><BR>Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks.  In case you didn't know, most tailor made packs have a built in weight reduction of 5%.  We are raising that to 10%.  We will also be displaying the weight reduction of all containers with the information shown on a right click.<BR><BR>- The EverQuest Team</div><br>

		<div align="justify"><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#303030">99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall! <BR><BR>Come one, come all, to the airy treetops of Kelethin to participate in the Knights Hospitaller's quasi-annual Drunken Fun Run through the home of the Wood Elves! <BR><BR>The agenda is thus: <BR>Race Group 1 (Newbie): <BR>All Noobs level 1-5 are invited to get hammered and run like wild people through the treetops while your elders laugh hysterically at your young bodies crashing to the ground. There is no entrance fee for this race. The prize is a bag full of goodies. <BR><BR>Race Group 2 (Intermediate): <BR>All players level 6 and higher are called to prove their inebriated dexterity to the Noobs they were laughing at shortly before. The entry fee for this race is 1pp/5 levels. The prize is a bag full of stuff better than the previous bag. <BR><BR>Race Group 3 (Steel Cage Death Match): <BR>All players of all levels are challenged to navigate Kelethin's windy walkways while essentially peering through a spyglass the wrong way. The entry fee for this is also 1pp/5 levels. The prize is a big deal thing that we'll figure out once the Knights have picked through our pockets. It'll be something better than lint. We'll also be divvying up whatever leftover entry fee money there is after buying the alcohol. <BR><BR>Race 4 (Guild Pride): <BR>One representative from every guild shall get absolutely wasted and show what good drunks come from their guild. The main prize here is going to be the ability to brag about your guild being the best buncha drunks on the server. <BR><BR>Rules: <BR>No speed enhancement spells/songs/potions/rabbits' feet. <BR>No 'safety nets' such as levitate. <BR>Alcohol will be provided. <BR>If the interest is exceedingly high, we'll do heats, probably single-elimination. <BR>If you fall off, you are out. <BR>If you die, you are out. <BR>The Knights Hospitaller will not be responsible for any experience lost during the course of this race, nor any children that might be conceived as a product of this race. <BR>Other rules may be announced at race time as we figure out the best ways to cheat our game. <BR><BR>The course: <BR>Run from the Druid Guild to the Rogue Guild without falling off/dying in the shortest time, and win. Officials of the Knights Hospitaller will be at the start and end, as well as posted at various points along the race course. <BR><BR>Please show up in Greater Faydark at 3pm EDT (12 noon PDT), April 1st for registration for the newbie race. Registration announcements for other races will be given during the course of the preceeding races. The races will start promptly at 4pm EDT (1 pm PDT). <BR><BR>Don't forget to set your clocks forward one hour Saturday night, the 31st of March. <BR><BR>Thank you, <BR>Ristorette, 54 Druid <BR>Capitular Baliff of the Priory of Antonica <BR>Knights Hospitaller<BR></div><br>

		<blockquote>
		<div align="justify"><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#303030">*** Patch Day ***<BR> <BR>*Spell Changes and Additions*<BR><BR>- A new teleportation spell has been added to the game for both Druids and Wizards.  These are self-only gate spells to the Dreadlands.  These spells should be available on the more exclusive spell vendors in Norrath.<BR><BR>- Increased the drop rate on some Kunark spells to coincide with the narrowing of the creatures carrying those spells as the game evolves.<BR><BR>- Wizards now have access to a new type of spell that only works on certain types of target.  Generically called 'bane' spells, a few are now available in the game.  May your quest for such spells be successful.<BR><BR><BR>*Item Changes*<BR><BR>- Changed the effects on the Singing Steel Boots and Greaves.  After a fair amount of concern from players, we have removed the summon food and water effects from these items.  They have been replaced with modified versions of Aria of the Eagles (boots) and Appalling Screech (greaves).<BR><BR>- The Incandescent Bracer can now be worn on the wrist rather than the waist.<BR><BR>- The Incarnadine Breastplate must now be worn to activate.<BR><BR>- Changed spell effects on Pauldrons of the Fearsome and Fearsome Shield to right click and worn to activate.<BR><BR><BR>*Bug Fixes*<BR><BR>- Fixed a bug that was causing some players to zone into the Warrens at the wrong location.<BR><BR>- Corrected an error with the Bixie Sword Blade, changing its delay from 6 to 16.<BR><BR>- Fixed a bug where Iskar Monks were unable to Feign Death after Foraging.<BR><BR>- Kodiaks in the Great Divide are now seen as animals.<BR><BR>- Toxdil, the wandering rogue poison vendor, will now sell to characters even when he is away from his home.<BR><BR><BR>*Enhancements*<BR><BR>- Fixed a problem that occurred when players mistyped /guild.  Typing /guildd in the chat window is the shortcut for typing /guilddelete.  /guildd now has a confirmation box so that such an error should no longer lead to the accidental deletion of a guild. <BR><BR>- Added /showspelleffects.  Using this toggle ('on' or 'off') a player can turn on or off the display of particle effects for spells.  This will only affect spells, not world effects like waterfalls or weapon particle effects.  This should allow you to turn off many of the effects that hamper rendering performance, inducing effects of spells, while still being able to see some of the awesome effects, like those on certain paladin weapons...<BR><BR>- Added server-side filtering for chat and combat messages.  This will allow you to turn off guild chat, shouts, auctions, oocs, 'my misses', 'others misses', 'others hits', 'attacker misses me', PC spells (all options), NPC spells and Bard songs (all options) at the server instead of at the client.  This can reduce that amount of data sent to you over your connection, and can help those with slower connections with better performance and connectivity.<BR><BR>- Ships will now be announcing their arrival in most zones.  They will also be announcing their progress to any zone they travel through.  Any of those zones that they are not currently making announcements in will be added in the next patch or two.<BR><BR>- Shift - Left and Shift - Right will now repeat in the chat window.  This means that when editing what you've typed, you can just hold down the Shift and Left Arrow keys and the cursor will move left until it reaches the beginning of the line or until you release the keys.<BR><BR>- The spell slot number will now show up in front of the spell name when you press Alt to cast a spell using the Alt-Spell Number method.<BR><BR>- View perspective in wolf form has been fixed.  First-person view will now be on level with the wolf, rather than a few feet above it.  At the same time, perceiving other players in wolf form will appear to be standing on the ground instead of floating a few feet above it.<BR><BR>- Trade skill success and failure messages will be sent to the craftsperson's group instead of just the craftsperson, as long as the craftsperson is using the proper ingredients.  Failure of the craftsman to use the proper ingredients will result in no failure message being sent.<BR><BR>- In order to prevent a few trade scams, money can no longer be removed from a trade window.  You will have to cancel the trade and start over to adjust the amount of money involved in the trade.<BR><BR>- We're now sending hitpoint updates to the casters of direct damage spells no matter how far away they are when the spell lands.  This will allow those casters that try to stand as far back as possible to get updates even when their range indicates that the messages should be surpressed.<BR><BR>*Quest*<BR><BR>Several new quests have been added as well, so don't be afraid to talk to the folks of Norrath, they might have new information for you.<BR><BR><BR>- The EverQuest Team</div><br>
