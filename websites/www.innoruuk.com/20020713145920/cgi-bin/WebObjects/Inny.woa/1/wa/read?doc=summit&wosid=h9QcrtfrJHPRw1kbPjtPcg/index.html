<h1>Innoruuk Guild Summit</h1><H1>Summit III Notes</H1>
<p>This document is the proposed new Summit III ruleset.
        
<H1>Innoruuk Guild Summit</H1>
<p>
Leaders of majority of the plane-going guilds met to discuss some basic rules   
regarding plane scheduling. We had a representative present from all the major  
guilds on the server ... and would like to thank all of them for taking the
time to attend.

<P>
After much debate...we came to terms on some ground-rules regarding plane
bookings. We tried to make it so every guild got a shot at the planes,
regardless of size and experience....this is the story.
    
<P>     
<B>On Oct 27, 2001, Summit III was convened, resulting in new rules
designed to alleviate various issues including access to epic drops.</B>

<P>
*** Note: this only deals with PoF and PoH
<P>
We split events into 2 categories..booked events and FFA/FiF events.

<H1>Booked Events (Updated) </H1>

<OL>
<LI>These rules cover POH and POF only. Dragons, static spawns, and POS
        are not covered by these rules.

<LI>Innoruuk.com will be the calendar used for all bookings.

<LI><B>A mix of scheduled raids and FFA/FiF will take place.  Additional
        sections below define the schedule for FFA/FiF.</B>

<LI>Only 2 people per guild will be allowed to schedule events, see your
        Guildleader for confirmation on who these people will be.
<LI><B>In order to book a date, a guild should have at least 18 planes
        capable people on its roster and expected to attend the event.  If
        on the day of the raid, the guild is unable to assemble 12 of it's
        members, the plane should be considered a FFA.
        Note: THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE OLD SYSTEM.</B>

<LI><B>A guild may have only ONE event booked at any given time.  You may
        book your next event once your current event has begun.  Note: THIS IS
        A CHANGE FROM THE OLD SYSTEM.</B>

<LI><B>Provided a guild has the minimums outlined above, a guild may
        accept any additional help required to clear the planes or kill
        boss mobs.  Note that this is NOT encouragement to bypass booking
        rules by creating twink guilds.  That sort of behavior would be
        highly dishonorable.  Note: THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE OLD SYSTEM.</B>

<LI><B>In order to achieve the minimums expressed above, two or more guilds
        may ally together, each consuming their booking right when scheduling
        an event.  This ensures small guilds access to the planes.</B>

<LI>Your time in PoH or PoF will not exceed 16 hours. (will go into more
        detail on this one later in the FFA section).

<LI>At end of reservation time, your guild must be out of zone completely,
        regardless of CR efforts. Although it is encouraged to help others with
        CR when practical, the 2nd guild has rights to allow or refuse CR effort
s
        cutting into their schedule.

<LI>No guild/person/group shall enter a plane without permission of the
        scheduled guild currently in the plane during their scheduled time.

<LI><B>Public rostered events will be scheduled on the calendar.  The
        goal of these events is to provide people who otherwise may not
        have access to the planes their chance.  A section below discusses
        public events in detail.  Note: Public events will be handled
        differently than in the past!</B>

<LI><B>By permission of the reserving guild, the second floor of hate
        may be occupied without consuming a booking.  However, the occupants
        of second floor should facate the plane at the end of the booking guild'
s
        reservation.  Also please try to respect the next guild's respawn period
,
        which may involve leaving early.</B></LI>

<LI>Booking/guild Summit violation discussions will take place on the
        Innoruuk.Com Guilds forum.

<LI><B>The new Summit III rules take effect Dec 1, 2001.  Existing bookings prio
r
        to Oct 27, 2001 will be honored, but you are stronly encouraged to move
any
        bookings that exist during the designated FFA/FiF days.  December 2001 b
ookings
        during these days must be moved.</B>

</OL>

<H1>Unscheduled FiF (First In Force) Events</H1> 
<p>
<B>Note: References to FFA turned to FiF for consistent naming.</B>

<OL>
<LI>If a plane is NOT booked 24 hours prior to midnight GMT (EST-5),
        It becomes classified as FiF.
<LI>First group to get to an FiF plane with sufficient force (we deemed
        that to be 18ppl), gets the zone for 16 hours.  Note: this means
        the people must be IN THE ZONE, not gathering to enter.
<LI>If a guild is currently in the plane clearing their own spawn (own
        time slot)...and your guild shows up with the intention of claiming
        a non-booked time slot (FiF)...let them know of your intentions, and
        they MUST leave the zone after their 16 hours and let your group occupy.

<LI>If a guild is currently in the plane and finish their 16 hours, and
        there is no request to occupy...they may stay in for another 16 hours.  
        If you ask to occupy after they have started clearing next time slot..
        your group is out of luck. So if you want an FiF timeslot, make sure
        to let the current occupants know of your intentions.
<LI>FiF events do NOT count as BOOKED events...they can be done at will,
        with no booking required.
</OL>
<H1>Scheduled FFA and FiF Events</h1>
<p>
FFA is defined as Free-For-All.  These are the rules that exist throughout
Norrath -- where anyone is able to zone into an area and begin hunting.
 
<P>
FiF is defined as First-In-Force.  This means that the first group to   
assemble sufficient force -- which is defined as 18 people -- owns
the zone just as if it were a scheduled event.

Summit III has opened 3 days a week for FFA/FiF in both planes.  FFA/FiF 
begins at 4 AM Pacific time on Tuesday mornings and ends at 4 AM Pacific 
time on Friday morning.  The period from 4 AM until the start of the
Friday booking is considered respawn time.  You must exit the
zone and allow for respawn at 4 AM Pacific time Friday morning.
