<font face="arial" size="2" color="#AAAAAA"><font color="black">Author:</font> <a href="mailto:kadafi@innoruuk.com" class="news">Kadafi Oakbane</a><br><br><br>

<div align="justify"><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#303030"><B>Kadafi:</B>  When was the LoD formed, and who founded it?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  LoD was founded something like mid-July of last year, by Thulaak.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Is Thulaak no longer a member?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Thulaak was banned awhile back.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  May I ask why Thulaak was banned?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  He had 3 strikes against him, cursing in a public channel, exploiting, and cursing in a public channel.  Those were the warnings in that order.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>   Do you think his banning was fair?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  The cursing ones were fairly lame, the exploiting was basically red handed.  He was trying to level his twink as fast as possible, and got carried away.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  What exactly did he exploit?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Pot in the savant room in lower guk, it was wildly popular in it's day.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  I’m not familiar with that exploit, can you explain?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  You sit in the pot in the savant room, mobs are effectively mezzed.  They just sit there, won't attack.  You can attack them back, cast on em, do whatever you please.  The pot itself isn't bugged, just happened to be a pot at that spot, it’s just horrible pathing.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Is this exploit still exploitable?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Most likely, yes.  I doubt they can fix a pathing error that severe.  Generally there is at least 1 spot in EVERY zone that's like that.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Was LoD formed with certain principles, or rules in mind?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Nope, we were formed as a guild of friends to do events basically.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Any code of conduct?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Code of conduct?  Yeah, don't do anything that gets the guild disbanded.  I don’t don't think anyone would want their guild telling them how to act.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  How many members are currently in the LoD?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  63 members in LoD.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Minimum level requirement of new recruits?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  50, but membership is closed for the time being.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Any chance of reopening membership?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Possibly, couldn’t really give an answer.  More or less it’s a “we’ll come to you” sort of deal.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  So who calls the shots?  Is it guild consensus?  Or leader driven?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Bit of both, we have officers and the leader decide on some things, guild consensus on others.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Who are the officers, and how many?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  The officers are myself (I’m guild leader for the time being, since Junx quit) Arsenic, Silvera, and Deng.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Why'd Junx quit?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  RL.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  How is morale?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  As good as it gets right now.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Why do you think a lot of people distain LoD?  Jealousy?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Well, not straight out jealousy.  It’s more of the sub-conscious type.  Not everyone thinks about it when they're running around in EQ, but it’s in the back of everyone’s head.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  What’s in the back of everyone’s head?  The jealousy?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Yeah, the jealousy.  But also, people tend to remember bad things more so than good things.  So we've probably done something to them in the past and that's all they remember.  “Someone in LoD trained me!”  “My brother had a CR done by LoD!”  Stuff like that.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Is there much truth to the training stories?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  I don't think anyone in LoD has purposely trained anyone in well over 8 months, or whenever Thulaak and I left CT.  Between the two of us, and several others, we created some huge trains in CT.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  For sport?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Mainly unintentional, but they'd kill a few  people, yeah.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Are there any guilds you admire, or have alliances with?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Allied with?  No, not really allied with anyone.  As far as admiring, I admire them all.  I’d throw a few names, but then this interview would be too long.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Any one or two that stick out as rivals, or of equal ability?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  I admire all the guilds, they put forth the effort to get things done, come together, all that.  I guess admire isn't as good as word for me as respect is.  I'd more or less say I respect them all.<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Now, as far as rival guilds… I'm going to without a doubt miss a name, but I’d say Pantheon and Ashen Vendetta are the two biggest rivals.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Rivals as in stature or hatred?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Stature.  We have our differences with many guilds, but we don’t hate any.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  I’ve heard you guys used to train and disrupt other guilds in the planes, any truth to that?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  We generally don't go into planes at all when another guild is there, so the answer to that is a no.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Have you cleared Hate?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Cleared hate 2nd day it opened.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Cleared Fear?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Several times.  Took us awhile to fully clear fear in the beginning (couldn't get Cazic alone because we were too slow).<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Cleared Sky?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Nope, furthest we've been is island 5 (Spiroc Island) pre-expansion.  <BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Any idea how many islands there are?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  10 total, 1 unused.  The 10th island, the unused one, it's not populated when you first zone into sky.<BR> <BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  How does Sky compare to the other planes as far as loot and difficulty?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Sky is something like five times harder than the planes.  The loot in sky is absolutely horrible for the most part, but you can't really compare them to the two other planes.  Sky is mainly non-visible pieces, such as necklaces cloaks, etc.  Whereas the other two planes (of course) are mainly visible pieces.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Any idea of the difficulty and/or loot value of islands 6-10?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  For the most part, it’s not worth it.  There are a few gems, but most of the equipment is disdainful.  LoD is more into leveling right now.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Out of all LoD members, how many, on average, have planar gear, and how much?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Unless someone just joined, all of our members have planar gear, and almost all have full sets.  So something like 4-5 pieces on average per member.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Does LoD still go to the planes often?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Every so often -- about once a week, I'd say.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  How many level 60's in LoD at this time?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  7 currently.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  You mentioned earlier that LoD is mostly into leveling right now.  I assume you mean the goal is to get most members to level 60?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Yeah, our main goal right now is to level to 60 as fast as we can so that a) we're done with it and b) we can move onto what we enjoy, events.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  It's been said that LoD members are not really friends.  Just powergamers who come together under a common goal, be it loot or level, any truth to that?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  We're all friends and our goals are similar.  Goals being to do it all, see it all, be it all.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Are there any bad apples in LoD?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  There have been, yes, but they were removed from the guild.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>   Does LoD only group with one another?  For example if you log in and your guild mates are deep inside Old Sebilis, would they bust ass to get you in?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Most of the time we only group with LoD member or prospects.  But yeah, if someone was deep in Sebilis and had a free spot, they’d bust their ass to get you.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  So about Trakanon, have you guys attempted him yet?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Nope, we're working on Trakanon, planning our first attempt in about 2 weeks.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Waiting for a few levels?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Yeah, going to get levels, and get prepared.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Can I come watch?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Hmm, possibly… not sure how messy it’s going to be.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  How difficult have you found Kunark dungeons?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  It's more difficult compared to Norrath dungeons.  Stuff tends to hit harder here than it’s Norrath counter-parts.  Sebilis keeps on getting tougher.  No slacking at level 60, whereas 50s can romp most Norrath dungeons.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Peanut butter and Jelly or Pizza?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Pizza.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Steak or Hamburger?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Steak.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Milk or water?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Water.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Blonde or Brunette?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  Brunette.<BR><BR><B>Kadafi:</B>  Foreign or Domestic?<BR><B>Sydsloot:</B>  DOMESTIC.<BR></div><br>
