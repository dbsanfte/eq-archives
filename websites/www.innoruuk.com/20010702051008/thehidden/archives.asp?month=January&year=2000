							Conrgats Gale and Orbit. For the few of you who weren't there last night Haggin decidede he didn't want to run for Taskmaster or House leader so he dropped out. We then had a short debate between Gale and Orbit and then a vote. Gale won 6 - 3 and is now our new Taskmaster. Orbit is now a House Leader of House  2.<br><br>Afterwards in all the drinking Haggin had an excellent suggestion, Roger Wilco! You can get the newest version by clicking the 'Download It" link on up top. When you set it up rember to use wav recording. Right now I am hosting the Roger Wilco server on my computer whenever it is up at 207.5.147.75. There is a password so only Crimson Dragon members can get in, I'm not going to post it here though. E-mail me or ask somone in game if they know. Hopefully will we be able to have someone on a static IP that can have a Roger Wilco basestation open 24 hours a day. Taeil is looking into this right now but the Firewall is give him some problems. Hopefully everything will be set up soon!

							Check out the <a href="/~mboutin/CrimsonDragons/riddle.html">Riddle</a> page! The new riddle is up and should prove to be a stumper for some of you. If the directions confuse you please tell me. I'll try to make them a bit easier if you don't have a clue. Now once you do figure it out please don't tell anyone else the secret of Willie, that is the point of this Riddle, for someone to figure it out themself. Also I still have Kammerades reward that I just need to get to him! No exact reward on this weeks riddle yet but I'm working on it!<br><br>  House Leaders things look promising for the News program. With Aeleric / Nelanu's help its working right now. Only a few bugs in it and it still doesn't archive things yet. I'm even doing this update with it right now! It should be working and out to you all soon.<br><br>  I got some neat screen shots with Starkan and Nallin of the <a href="http://www.tyler.pair.com/eq/">Inquisitors</a>. Hopefully I'll get some time to upload them too. I must also thank Nallin for helping me get that second Lambent Bracer.

							It seems that all of a sudden many members are taking an interest in Trade skills! I know Galeof, Kelandra and Nelanu have all started fletching and they all are about 40ish. Therefore i propose that we elect a Guild Smither, Tailor, and Tinker(Although we have no gnomes yet).<Br><Br>I would also like to vote on the new House leaders and Taskmaster this coming weekend. If you goto the forum you can read Orbit speach. If Gale and Haggin could get theirs up soon the vote shall then commence.<br><br>Also with the coming weekend I will get a new riddle up. I am working on it right now with a gnomish friend Willie. It should be much harder than last weeks and I am workin on the reward now. Kammerade, I just got your reward last night so next time i see you come pick it up. I think you will like it.

							Well for those of you who I saw today you can probaly tell I'm busy. My cable modem had the same problems as it did two weeks ago and it didn't get straightened out till about 4:30 EST, just before i needed to camp!<br><Br>Orbit, I'm in the High Hold area and i can help you wednesday probaly. Just keep in touch and we can schedule a time. Kammerade and Galeof I know you both have a bunch of ideas but i don't have that precious thing called time to put them into use. I'm still working on the riddles page, and i still need help on how to get rid of the yellow border around the icon on the <a href="/~mboutin/CrimsonDragons/Test.html">Test</a> page. Any help with that would be greatly appreciated.

							So much has been going that this is going to be a huge update.<br><br>The past couple of days i have been working on a program to help with the web page. Its finally done now! Updating the news will be alot simpler and i can control the colors alot easier.<br><Br>Speaking of colors what does everyone think of this color scheme for the main page? Any suggestions or comments about it? I plan on keeping the format the way it is with the statue in the background. I just want to tweak the colors really. Although if you make a really good argument i can change it. Im just really attached to that statue.<br><Br>If you take a look at the <a href="/~mboutin/CrimsonDragons/member.html">members</a> page you will see that is has been updated and alot of people have been moved around. The reason for this is there seems to be alot of people who i don't see very often. I removed them from active houses and put them in the non active one. Once you start playing that character again please give me a ring and ill move you into an active house.<br><Br>Recently a few people have left guild, and ill talk about that more later. So because of the low membership i want to recruit a few more people. Preferably in the mid teens to mid 20s. If you group with someone who you think would be a great addition into the guild. Try to group with them a few times at least then invite them.<br><br>Now the news you have all been waiting for! I think I have decided what I shall do about the House Leader situation, with great help from Aeleric. As you can see Anyrael has been removed from the the guild. I talked to him last night and his RL is getting busy so he has very little time for EQ. Now we have a Taskmaster and two House Leader positions open. Haggin, Galeof, Orbit have been nominated so far. If you have any more nominations please tell me. I would like each nominee to write a short speech telling what you will do, how much free beer you will give away, etc... After that has been done i plan on asking everyone for their vote starting next weekend. The first vote will be for Taskmaster, then House Leader 2 then House leader 3. Good luck to you all and get thos speaches ready.<br><Br>I seemed to have neglected the <a href="/~mboutin/CrimsonDragons/TradeSkills.html">Trade Skills</a> page for a while. So if you have any info or a desire to become an official guild trade skill master just speak up.<br><BR>It seems we have all come to the conclusion that the new message board stinks! If you can find a better one PLEASE tell me so i can get it set up for us. Until then we must bear with it.<br><Br>I have need of some HTML help. Please goto this <a href="/~mboutin/CrimsonDragons/Test.html">page</a>. You should notice the IRPA icon in the top right. Does anyone know how to get rid of the yellow border?<br><br>Sometime later today you should see a new link on the left sidebar. From now on im going to have a weekly riddle. The first person to solve it will get some prize. Each week after the previous riddle has been solved a new one will go up. Here is this weeks riddle:<br><center><b>A Bent Riddle</b><br>Rain is spent<br>Now colors bent<br>Frame a clear, blue sky</center><br>Good luck on this one, It shouldn't be too hard.

Check the <a href="/~mboutin/CrimsonDragons/events.html" target="body">Events</a> page for the details.<br><br> As I have posted on the Forum Tegeril has left the guild.

							I believe I have asked most people who they would to nominate for House Leader. Haggin, Orbit, Galeof, and Glyn have been nominated so far. I am going to ask all of them if they accept and starting this weekend I'm going to ask you your vote on who should be next!<br><Br> I also uploaded a bunch of screenshots Wendiddle sent me before she left to join the Collective, her friend's guild. The first ones starts <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/me3/crimsondscrns2/ACK.html" target="body">here</a>. So go check them out. And if you have any for me send them to me and I'll put them up, although time may be a concern.<br><br> For those of you who saw Xele's question about how to get a submembers page here is a better answer. The easiest way to do it would be to post all the info on the message board. The next easiest way would be to send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:Boisvert@Innoruuk.com">Boisvert@Innoruuk.com</a> with the information and a screen shot. Please rember wether or not you want me to put up your e-mail address. The hardest way would be for you to take the template from one of the existing pages. Fix it up so it suits you and send it to me and i will upload it. Any other questions?
