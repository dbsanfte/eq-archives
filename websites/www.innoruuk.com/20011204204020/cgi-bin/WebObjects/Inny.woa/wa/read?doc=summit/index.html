<h1>Innoruuk Guild Summit</h1><a NAME="top"></a>

<p>Leaders of majority of the plane-going
guilds met to discuss some basic rules regarding plane scheduling. We had
a representative present from all the major guilds on the server ... and
would like to thank all of them for taking the time to attend.</p>
<p>After much debate...we came to terms
on some ground-rules regarding plane bookings. We tried to make it so every
guild got a shot at the planes, regardless of size and experience....this
is the story.
<p>*** Note: this only deals with PoF
and PoH.</p>

<p>We split events into 2 categories..booked
events and FFA events.
<h2>Booked Events (Updated) </h2>
<ol>
<li>
These rules cover POH and POF only.
Dragons, static spawns, and POS are not covered by these rules.</li>
<li>
Innoruuk.com will be the calendar used
for all bookings.</li>
<li>
Only 2 people per guild will be allowed
to schedule events, see your Guildleader for confirmation on who these
people will be.</li>
<li>
In order to book a date, a guild should
have at least 7 planes capable people on its roster. If the scheduling
guild does not have at least 7 planes capable members, it must be scheduled
as a public event.</li>
<li>
A guild may only have *2* events booked
at any given time but only one booking can be on a weekend date. A weekend
is defined as Friday through Sunday, PST. This meaning that a third event
cannot be booked until the first of it's 2 events have begun.</li>
<li>
No back-to-back BOOKED plane raids.
eg: Fear on mon. and Hate on tues. is unacceptable....Fear on mon. and
Hate on wed. is fine. (see FFA section for more info).</li>
<li>
Two or more guilds may "ally" themselves
with other guilds to book a planes raid but all guilds in the alliance
must use one of their bookings when doing so. When scheduling a planes
raid, if you are planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild
as guests, that guild must also be listed on the booking and it also counts
as a booking for that guild.</li>
<li>
Your time in PoH or PoF will not exceed
16 hours. (will go into more detail on this one later in the FFA section).</li>
<li>
At end of reservation time, your guild
must be out of zone completely, regardless of CR efforts. Although it is
encouraged to help others with CR when practical, the 2nd guild has rights
to allow or refuse CR efforts cutting into their schedule.</li>
<li>
No guild/person/group shall enter a
plane without permission of the scheduled guild currently in the plane
during their scheduled time.</li>
<li>
Public "Rostered Events" can be scheduled
on the calendar. They must include a link to a roster of expected attendees.
The roster should attempt to list 80% of the expected attendees. If more
than 6 people from the same guild are expected to attend, then it constitutes
a guild booking, not public event. No person can be scheduled to attend
two public events that are on the calendar concurrently.</li>
<li>
Booking/guild Summit violation discussions
will take place on the Innoruuk.Com Guilds forum.</li>
<li>
From Oct 1st, any new booking should
abide by the new changes set forth by this summit. Any bookings made after
Oct. 1st, 2000 midnight PST will be subject to the new rules.</li>
</ol>

a Log File from the Second Guild Summit</a>
<h2>FFA (free for all) Events</h2>
<ol>
<li>
If a plane is NOT booked 24 hours prior
to midnight GMT (EST-5), It becomes classified as FFA.</li>
<li>
First group to get to an FFA plane with
sufficient force (we deemed that to be 18ppl), gets the zone for 16 hours.</li>
<li>
If a guild is currently in the plane
clearing their own spawn (own time slot)...and your guild shows up with
the intention of claiming a non-booked time slot (FFA)...let them know
of your intentions, and they MUST leave the zone after their 16 hours and
let your group occupy.</li>
<li>
If a guild is currently in the plane
and finish their 16 hours, and there is no request to occupy...they may
stay in for another 16 hours. If you ask to occupy after they have started
clearing next time slot.. your group is out of luck. So if you want an
FFA timeslot, make sure to let the current occupants know of your intentions.</li>
<li>
FFA events do NOT count as BOOKED events...they
can be done at will, with no booking required.</li>
</ol>
<p>With that all said and done...I will
add a few other points.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Innoruuk.com will be used...we realize
that many events have already been scheduled...and all of them will be
valid. NO more events are to be booked until your guild gets below the
2 booking limit. This will insure that nobody gets screwed out of their
existing time slots, and that other guilds get their shot at some time-slots.
By April 1. the system should be in full motion.</li>
<li>
Innoruuk.com will provide added security
in the near future which will allow only pre-approved access to the event
editor.</li>
<li>
Dragons will not be scheduled...still
FFA.</li>
<li>
PoS will not be scheduled...easy enough
to see if ppl are there without disturbing them or putting their lives
in danger.</li>
<li>
This system will only work if EVERYONE
complies and tries to use a little common sense and respect.</li>
<li>
This system is for everyone...not just
who came to the meeting. If your guild is plane-worthy...by all means..start
booking, but plz comply with the stated rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thx all for your time.</p>
