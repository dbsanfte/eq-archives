<Havlok> heh.. er.. anyone know if ICQ is acting up today? :)
<Cymric> Sandory: do any of you schedule planes runs or go on planes runs with others who do schedule, currently?
<Cymric> heh ICQ always acts up.. buggy software! ;)

*** Mode change "+o Decantur" on channel #tp by ChanServ
<Havlok> and I'm here for the free booze.. there is booze right?  jk :)
<Cymric> Aerion: this is one of those precursory things I have to ask. Does your guild currently make planes runs and use the event calendar?
<Aerion> We have not yet BEEN on a planes raid, but we have two events currently booked
<Cymric> No one told me there would be booze! Who came up with this idea anyway!? ;)
*** Mode change "+v Aerion" on channel #innoruuk by Cymric
<Aerion> Thank you
<Cymric> That's good enough.
*** Branna (TCURTIS@cae31-197-089.sc.rr.com) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Havlok> well my alcohol tolerance isn't maxed yet :)
<Cymric> I think my tolerance on both of my characters is around 30 or 40, I'm just a social drinker. ;)
<Havlok> heh.. so was I... cept for the fact I had to go to alot of "social fun stuff" events dreamed up by friends :)
<sandory> I am a warrior.....  only way to keep slashing at mobs is to stay drunk!
<Cymric> One thing I hate about being drunk in-game is when I'm toasted as my caster, and something rare spawn wanders through, I cant cast.. and I look silly trying to bash it with a weapon. ;)
<Havlok> ./em makes a mental note.. don't give sandory alot to drink if I'm mezzing alot of mobs
*** Boisvert (Boisvert@147-75.suscom-maine.net) has joined channel #innoruuk
<sandory> lol Havlok
*** Mode change "+o Junx" on channel #innoruuk by ChanServ
<Cymric> heya bois. =)
<Boisvert> Hey there Cym
*** Mode change "+v Boisvert" on channel #innoruuk by Cymric
<Boisvert> What is +v?
<Havlok> now if only I could figure out a way to be here.. and in game at the same time.. darn one phone line and 2 comps.. heh
<Cymric> voice.. once things get underway, we'll be setting +m (moderate on the channel). That means only people with @ or +v will be able to talk.
<Boisvert> hehehehehhe
<Boisvert> Aaaahhhh, but if I read the current email correctly since CD is not currently scheduling planes wouldn't I not be able to talk?
<Cymric> havlok: heh.. you should play around with that 98 internet connection sharing thing.. and get 2 netcards 'n a hub. ;)
<Havlok> I'll just have to play the stimulating single version of EQ... the Tutorial.. ohh.. ahh
*** AVARUS (tfox01@c416076-a.jffsn1.mo.home.com) has joined channel #innoruuk
*** AVARUS has left channel #innoruuk
<Cymric> bois: nope, but you can represent me in the fact that I'll need more people to moderate/keep the peace. Coz you're also part innoruuk.com staff in an odd way, and I'll need more sanity checks if it gets ugly. So congratulations on your promotion. You wont be able to vote though, if it comes to that. ;)
<Havlok> ./em grumbles.. I bet Lhile knew this was coming and took vacation purposely at this time
<Cymric> But neither will I, so keep quiet. hehe
<Boisvert> Heee Hoooooooo!
<Boisvert> I never really use IRC so I don't know any of the commands, any ones I should know?
<Cymric> Havlok: it's been on the message boards for a good 3 weeks at least.. it's most likely not coincidence. ;)
<Aerion> Cymric: I personally disagree with that policy.  I should think that any guild who PLANS to use the calendar in the near future should also be entitled to vote.
<sandory> I disagree...  i think he should be able to vote
<Havlok> heck.. I forgot IRC.. heh.. who has time for that when I'm playing catch up to the others in my guild :)
<Cymric> boisvert: naw.. not any main ones.
<Boisvert> Cym: Okies
<Havlok> LOL Cymric... question is.. heh.. does Lhile use the boards ;)
<Boisvert> Although, I do kinda agree all guilds should get a say, we do need to keep it under control somehow
<Boisvert> I'll just send messages to Ansuz when he arrives :-)
<Boisvert> And speaking of that, how do you sen dprivate messages?
<Cymric> Aerion: The problem is, we don't know who is or who isn't going to use it in near future. We do know the current issues of people going now, and that's what we're trying to all meet about and correct, so we can even protect those in the near future.
<Boisvert> Hey there Aerion!
<Aerion> Boisvert: Control is needed, I agree.  But intentionally disallowing someone a voice is a receipe for anarchy.
<Cymric> The thing is, I've never been to a plane, and never had anyone walk in wanting to CR their corpses, so why should I get a vote regarding it? Know what I mean?
<Aerion> Hello, Boisvert!
<Aerion> Just because it has never happened to you does not mean it WILL not happen  *smile*
<Cymric> plus, the list of current plane-going guilds who use the calendar is at 49.. heheh that's enough to be more than noisy and have a good representation of guilds that might be like ones in the near future.
<Banadel> it's not like we are singling out people of smaller guilds that have never been to the planes. but the question is how do they have any say in doing things they aren't doing themselves. even if it is in the future.
<sandory> I agree with Aerion...  it diminishes any rules that are made ....  it makes it too arbitrary
<Boisvert> Aerion: The only ones who I feelarn't being represented are those who are guildless. And even then they can send private messages to those who they will eventualy be going with
<Boisvert> Yea, I'm working on 46th right now to go witht he SSoN next month
<Cymric> -nod- I do recommend for those who aren't currently booking/using the system to find a representative who will be voting. A lot of guilds will be here, a lot of them with your same concerns.
<Havlok> I decline to comment on things till this is underway :)
<Boisvert> *chuckles*
<Cymric> Bois: ahhh.. we're going with SSoN? ;)
<Gregor> On the subject of disallowing voices, I know my guild is not pleased with the current plan.  We do not have planes ready members at this point, but that does not mean we never will and don't have a stake in this.
<Boisvert> Anyone care to submit a riddle to me to be the CD riddle of the week?
<Gregor> Being silenced on the issues is not sitting well.
<Boisvert> Cym: Yea, gong with with SSoN and I think some dark retribution
<Banadel> find someone to represent your opinion then. Personally I think the way it is now is working quite well
<sandory> NOOO   speaking through proxy is NOT right and is NOT having a voice
<Gregor> It is not easy to fond someone who can represent my point of view, when anyone who shares my situation is ommitted by default.
<Boisvert> Sandory: So how do you propose to keep order if we don't limit by guilds. I can't really think of a better way
<sandory> he IS a guild representative... let him speak
<Cymric> I'm sorry guys, but this is a summit of guilds who are currently making planes runs. It's like a community meeting, and deciding for Pine Street. If you don't live on Pine Street, your decisions shouldn't be counted, even if you do plan on living on Pine Street next year. See what we're saying?
<Gregor> One representative per guild, regardless of wheather or not that guild is "planes ready" would work.
<Banadel> imagine having 200 guilds here with 2 representitives and keeping the peace. it will never work
<Havlok> cough... nice weather eh? :)
<Banadel> Cym: exactly
<Boisvert> *chukle* And we still got 48mins to go before it official "starts"
<Cymric> Gregor: there's currently 130 registered guilds on Innoruuk.Com, 49 of which currently use the calendar.
<Boisvert> What is the cmd to send a private message?
<sandory> just because it gets messy doesn't mean it isn't right
<Cymric> bois: double click on someone's name..  or /msg name blah
<Cymric> or tab if they've messaged you recently (like /r)
<Boisvert> Gregor: Even at CD guild meetings it almost gets out of hand iwth 12ppl, imagine 130!
<Boisvert> Cym: Thanks
<nyne> well, if it's not practical then it doesn't matter
<Gregor> Cym: that argument hold little wather to me.  Things move faster in EQ then they do in real life.  My guild could recruit one person, and have our status change.  Not being represented here hurts us.
<nyne> so shush
*** Aerion is now known as Aerion\afk
<sandory> I agree with gregor!  things move quickly
<nyne> if you honestly think you need to send a rep because you have one planes capable person, you need to get your head examined
<nyne> it's going to be a zoo as it is
<Havlok> I'm sure you'll see a few guilds here who do have planes ppl who don't have ALOT of planes ppl who will voice concerns of being ommited due to lack of size
<Cymric> yep, they're generally the majority too now. ;)
<Gregor> I understand your need for control.  IRC chats are know for being a bit, lets say "active."  But I think you are being too selective.
<nyne> cymric: not the majority of people that do planes afaik
<Boisvert> nyne: afaik? what is that
<Banadel> well when we get 60 plane capable guilds using the calander then we can hold another meeting and you get your say. Until then I really don't see the point of people that don't go to the planes (and don't really know how it works) should get a opinion on how everyone that is doing it should do it
<nyne> afaik = as far as I know
<Boisvert> aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh
<Havlok> aye.. as a rep for Amici (cuz Lhile is on vacation the bum).. I know we will be looking at this closely as we have at the most 10 planer ppl now with a few close to becoming it
<nyne> besides which, do you actually have a point?  or are you just bitching because you're not included?
<nyne> I'm still at a loss for how this meeting could take more than 5 min
<sandory> nyne I do not know who you are but I resent your attitude
<nyne> take cymric's proposed changes, vote, it's done
<Gregor> But you plan on enforecing the results of this meeting on my guild when we are planes ready.  We have no right in helping create the system we will someday live by?
<Boisvert> Nyne: I think people just want to shout and bitch
<nyne> I'm sure you do =)
<Cymric> Believe me, I'm the first person who will stand up and want to protect the little guy. But if you don't currently schedule planes runs or use the calendar, it's like voting on the new line of Pepsi when you've never had Pepsi. ;)  We'll have enough people here who will represent your viewpoints, and hopefully we'll have a good congregation of different viewpoints so we can get the best solutions for all, if the proposed amendments are voted on
<Havlok> nyne.. is the US president that easy to vote in? :)
<Boisvert> hahahaha lets just go down each item and vote :-)
<nyne> there should be an agenda for the meeting
<nyne> and people should have submitted items
<Havlok> heh.. I'm just here on short notice :)  and shall now leave my comments till this is officially underway ;)
<nyne> gregor: no one "enforces" the planes rules
<nyne> people that want to reap the benefits of them abide by them
<sandory> aye, it is based on respect
<nyne> people that don't abide by them aren't respected in their bookings
*** Irrani_Storm_ (Irrani__St@cc126016-b.hwrd1.md.home.com) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Banadel> has nothing to do with respect imo
<nyne> no, not really.  it has to do with it being to everyone's mutual benefit
<Gregor> nyne: Not yet.  but they will in time, even if it is by peer pressure.  And if the rules that come out of here are good, I want to see them enforeced.
*** phlint (jirc@syr-24-169-180-95.twcny.rr.com) has joined channel #tp
<Cymric> nyne: there is an agenda, I believe the first being if this meeting should actually exist. ;)  Then if you guys decide it should, then go down the proposed amendments, then maybe open forum if someone suggests any new amendments. just a suggestion. =)
*** Cylmae (WisCookie@146.milwaukee-11-12rs16rt.wi.dial-access.att.net) has joined channel #innoruuk

*** Aerion\afk is now known as Aerion
<nyne> put them up as a block to be voted on, if they fail, vote them individually with discussion afterwards to fix them
*** Aerion is now known as AerionLK
<sandory> that is reasonable
<nyne> what were they again anyway? =)
<Havlok> LOL
<Cymric> nyne: that makes sense too =)

<Havlok> umm.. Bois.. you just made my brain hurt... pls.. don't do that again.. my int is low enough as it is
<AerionLK> May I suggest that everyone append the initials of their guild to the end of their nickname as I have.  It will make identify us all much easier

<Havlok_Amici> no no.. Vest tosses around RBF's
<Macmorn> Actually i doubt any agrement here will have an impact on my guild..but as Aegis we are noted for our fairness for all
<Cymric> macmorn: that's what this summit meeting is about, fairness for all who are affected by the system. that includes large and small guilds.
<Vestrial_Legends> bah, I tossed AN rbf, not rbfS... ;P
<Havlok_Amici> sure sure
<Idril_Patronas> Personally I'd like to see us make some minor tweaks to the agreement we already have and go home happy.  Nothing we can agree on will be much fairer than the current system -- if people do not abuse it.
<Macmorn> What i dont want to see is say 5 or 6 small guilds, with plane capable players, denied any imput then have then join together into another uber guild just so they can play the game
<Tallis|Iceni> i agree Idril

<mitsurgurii_arcane_guardians> what about the guilds that have just a few people that are planes capable
<nyne_TP> no one take advantage of junx when he's not looking
<Boisvert_CrimsonDragons> SSoN's are a small guild, They need to make alliances like that, and even then their raid the 27th is going to be close on ppl
<Cymric2> macmorn: if you do a joint guild raid, and 1 books it, the person who books and reserves should be here, or his/her spokesman

<Urky_Iceni> but when you `invite' along another guild .. who already has 2 booking.. well.. hm
<Perdy> Yes, Bayre and Perdy are OOTW
<Vestrial_Legends> I think the issue is that when 3 small guilds band together and all reserve planes the same 18 people can effectively have 6 reservations
<Perdy> Order of the Wolf
<nyne_TP> exactly
<Bayre> Changed my Nick =0
<Cymric> ahhh  I'm so confused with guilds right now my friends, plz excuse me if I dont recognize you.
<Havlok_Amici> we don't invite another guild.. we pull friends that we know.. not guilds
<writhe_Justifiers> vestrial: agreed.
<Cymric> boisvert: we're waiting for stragglers.
<Macmorn> yes urky i have noticed that abuse and it needs to be addressed
<Urky_Iceni> really?
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> * smiles
<Boisvert_CrimsonDragons> Vestrial: Why I think if 2 guilds make an alliance they should both need to put in their "plane resveration credit"
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> : smiles
<Shylara_LB> exactly Vest
<Cymric> Being a small guild and scheduling for alliances like Avan/BH/Kogerne is just as viable.
<Vestrial_Legends> Boisvert: I agree with this
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> I agree on that 
<Cymric> as long as you list your alliances and only take up 2 reservations.
<Amazar_ascension> me too 
<Tallis|Iceni> i agree cymric
<writhe_Justifiers> yes yes
<Idril_Patronas> Agreed as well
<Idril_Patronas> But
*** Perdy is now known as Perdy_OOTW
<Skykat_AMS> the limiting to one booking per gild will cut that in half
<Cymric> -nod-
*** Bayre is now known as Bayre_OOTW
<nyne_TP> one booking per guild isn't going to happen
<Idril_Patronas> If 5 PV members are invited to help on a raid run by another guild, and we do, should that count against our bookings?
<Havlok_Amici> bah.. what stops me from just saying.... quit yer guild.. join ours for the riad.. then rejoin yer guild?
<writhe_Justifiers> however, we are allowed to invite up to 6 people from a guild, before they have an official presence at our booking, yes?
<Goad_Unbroken> agreed as well
<mitsurgurii_arcane_guardians> but then how will people in smaller guilds that are able to go to the planes get in ?
<Vestrial_Legends> No idril
<Cymric> It was proposed by your fellow guild members who visit the planes.. I have no personal stake in this. ;)
<Tallis|Iceni> i say that the guild with the majority of players up there should be booking it
<Banadel_DotP> that's cheating the system....alot of this rely's on trust between us all
<Urky_Iceni> yepyep
<Tallis|Iceni> when iceni had 6 47+ we went with OCH under their name
<Sandory_Aegis> aye
* Tuttle wages
<Tuttle> s/g/v/
<Tallis|Iceni> now we have a majority of iceni up there we book under our own name
<Cymric> Idril: The rules are built on respect and honor, I wouldn't say it would count against you, but if you repeatedly do it, and it's know that guild A always goes with guild B, and both book 2 each, that's frowned on.
<Junx-LoD> a/s/l  ?
*** Tuttle is now known as Tuttle_Pa
<Havlok_Amici> so effectively then yer saying small guilds have no choice in planes raids..
<Drakmeijen_Redoubtable> System will be easy to abuse if we don't say something like if 6 members of a guild go, then it is a booking
<Lorthyon_Amici> By pulling friends from other guilds, we have people from up to 5 or 6 different guilds. You want to say that all those 5 or 6 guilds used up their spot?
<Drakmeijen_Redoubtable> However how do we enforce it, seems tricky
<Macmorn> I think we need to move beyond the 2 or 1 booking idea..the amount of bookings needs to be in line with the number of players above level 46 in a guild
<Idril_Patronas> So does Patronas, we have 25 or so planes capable members.  But we are often asked to help others on their raids
<Shylara_LB> So my 70 pnes capable people should get one booking while 3 guilds with 10 each combine and go 3 times?  And you think that is fair???

<Skykat_AMS> macmorn i have 30+ players of planes capable level - how many do i get? that would be totally unfair i think
<Urky_Iceni> no Lorthyon, but when you have 20 members of another guild with you, thats bending the rules just a bit too far imo
<Banadel_DotP> ernyep too
*** Bodil has left channel #innoruuk
* Banadel_DotP learns to type
<Talmon_Storm> the system is pretty simple.... if you commonly align yourself with another guild for planes raids then only one of those two guilds can reserve
<Goad_Unbroken> aye we need to set a limit of people invites, wich beyond that makes the invite guild declare their booking too
<nyne_TP> let's say this.  if you send more than one group of people on a raid, it counts as your guild going
<Lorthyon_Amici> So, like it was proposed earlier. We are a small guild, how are we to go to planes? Most other guilds have more than enough people for a plain raid?
<Junx-LoD> that sounds good nyne
*** Bodil (Danielgang@fl-pbg1c3-19.pbc.adelphia.net) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Cymric> nyne: sounds logical.
<Vestrial_Legends> I agree Talmon. Guilds with fewer then 18 planar members should only be able to book through an aliance 
<Havlok_Amici> we don't ally with guilds.. we do it with friends.. hell Hate we had one from legends.. two from Wicked.. a few from Patronas..
<Urky_Iceni> sounds reasonable nyne/anne err..
<Macmorn> sky not unfair if you base number of spots say by number of 46+ divided by 18 thus you get one spot per time frame a guild with 60 memebrs that meet 46+ would get 3 spots
<writhe_Justifiers> I thought the accepted # to bring along was 6 from another guild before it became a problem.
<Lorthyon_Amici> I've been asked to go to a plain twice. And one of them was because they needed a teleport
*** zeke (ezekiel101@modem-1369.rns.tamu.edu) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Talmon_Storm> just align yourself with another guild that is also small Amici... Storm does this all the time
<Skykat_AMS> if small guilds go together I fail to see why they cant post together
<Vestrial_Legends> thats not true Lorthyon, there are MANY small guilds out there
<Banadel_DotP> you can go with other guildsa as you do now it's just you can't schedule a plane raid you have to let the guild you go with schedule it
*** Bayre (~jerle@cm-206-31-81-83.gulfbreeze.mediacom.ispchannel.com) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Cymric> amici: avan/bh/kogerne.. ally yourselves, and all of you can go.
<Jorom> whoa whoa, I jsut heard something that is totally wrong
<Tallis|Iceni> we went with OCH when we didnt have enough to do it on our own
*** Bayre is now known as Bayre_
<Havlok_Amici> but not all guilds agree on the way things are done
<Goad_Unbroken> for small guilds it is apparent they must form an alliance, and each guild going on that booking must declare its booking
<Talmon_Storm> they can post together... just dont every one of the guilds post 2 raids
<Skykat_AMS> macmorn that gives weight to uber guilds
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> A few people from other guild on one guilds trip is ok just not 20
-> *cymric* Are we actually discussing policy already?
*** zeke (ezekiel101@modem-1369.rns.tamu.edu) has joined channel #tp
*** Bodil has left channel #innoruuk
<Jorom> guilds with 18 or less planar should only be able to book with another?
<Vestrial_Legends> exactly Shim
*** zeke has left channel #tp
*Cymric* heh nah.. just hammering out the issues before vote, methinks. ;)
<Jorom> so in essence if you have 4 guilds with 18 or less, and they all four want to form up and go, then they cannot as none of them are allowed to book
<Longy_DeusVult> The only sure way for a small guild to make sure all their members get to go on a planes raid is for that guild to book it.
<Vestrial_Legends> that was an example. We can decide on the exact number...
<nyne_TP> since there has to be a number, let's say that if you send more than 6 people on a planes raid, that counts as you going
<Skykat_AMS> i dont know how we would regulate the number of members in a guild that are planar
<Perdy_OOTW> Agreed Longy
<writhe_Justifiers> can a guild with less than 18 planar do a plane, really?
<Tallis|Iceni> its all down to numbers... if the majority of players up in the planes are from one guild then its should be on that guilds booking
<Banadel_DotP> yes Jorum I think so....if you don't have enough to do the raid and group up with another guild. then you cannot book 4 trips between the both of you
<nyne_TP> writhe: if they're good =)
<Havlok_Amici> so this boils down to a simple fact of.. small guilds.. yer not uber.. so yer forced to ally with another small guild you will have to work hard to get the same ideals on
*** Bodil (Danielgang@fl-pbg1c3-19.pbc.adelphia.net) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Junx-LoD> skykat - can't regulate any of this truthfully, its all gotta be on the honor system :/
<Banadel_DotP> yep
<Idril_Patronas> Writhe: sure, can clear most mobs in hate with 12
<Urky_Iceni> whole thing is honour based
<Macmorn> sky yes it does but it would allow their 60 plus memebers the same chane to attend as anyone else..hehe why am i support this idea?
<Goad_Unbroken> agreed Longy, more that 6 makes them count as a booking
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> If we want this to work it has to be a honer thing
<Skykat_AMS> right so the weighted average of planar members cant apply
<writhe_Justifiers> Nyne:not many are that good.

<Tallis|Iceni> yup, its all down to honour, if not it ends up with the planes camped 24/7 after being broken and people doing pickup like on other servers. No one wants that do they
<Tut|Panth> Just because you're in a small guild and have to ally for an event doesn't mean you're getting event jipped
<Cymric> shylara: the 1 slot idea will most likely get shot down.
<Vestrial_Legends> Shylara, you are misunderstanding
<Perdy_OOTW> What happened to the idea of one event booking on the weekend, the other must be a weekday
<Havlok_Amici> basicially this sounds to me like its a case of... those who joined late.. or those who don't have alot of friends.. and are planar.. you'll be fighting hard to ever see them..
<Banadel_DotP> don't be so negative about this
<Tut|Panth> If you have only 9 people in guild X and 9 people in guild Y, then you still have 18 people using a plane
<Cymric> shylara: these were just proposed ideas in the threads.. you can vote no on the items. ;)
<nyne_TP> can we agree that the one event booking idea is dead?
<Banadel_DotP> hope so
<Junx-LoD> k, kill one event booking then
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> Perdy: some people don't have the members avail on the weekdays
<Tallis|Iceni> i think the current method of 1 current booking per plane works fine
<Amazar_ascension> I agree -- kill the one event idea
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> How about 2 bookings per but one MUST be on a weekday?
<Cymric> havlok: if you don't have enough friends to break a plane, or survive, you shouldn't be in a plane and shouldnt be booking one for reservation. ;)
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> I agree it is dead
<Vestrial_Legends> death to one booking
<Talmon_Storm> I also agree kill the one booking amendment
<writhe_Justifiers> what we really need are a couple new planes.
<Perdy_OOTW> Then find 'friends' from other guilds.. just a thought. I don't think it's fair to limit one raid though.
<nyne_TP> aerion: why?
<Tut|Panth> Here's my point: why should a small guild be able to take it's 9 members to a plane more often than my guild should be able to take it's 18 members to a plane just because small guild goes with another guild regularly?
<Tallis|Iceni> hehe too true writhe
<Havlok_Amici> ahh... so I shouldn't be having fun in a game I pay to play :)
<Idril_Patronas> I sort of like the idea of 2 bookings at a time but only 1 a weekend
<Havlok_Amici> I have friends.. in multiple guilds...
<Jorom> Cymric: Just out of curiosity..what is considered /enough/?
<Arenoth_Patronas> That will make a much better use of the weekdays
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Nyne: To make prime Weekend bookings a little more available
<Kelandria_Amici> Cymric, we do have enough friends, but they don't all happen to be in small guilds.  Some are in big guilds that routinely book their own.  We only invite a few per guild though, in general.
<writhe_Justifiers> yes, 1 weekend booking idea sounds reasonable.
<Bayre_OOTW> They shouldn't Tut, that would be quite unfair and encourages small guilds and uber twink guilds
<Tut|Panth> So? I have friends in other guilds, but I, personally, would be helping monopolise planes if I went with them /in addition/ to my own guild
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> I like the one weekend thing
<nyne_TP> weekend bookings are prime?  we never go on weekends, it's a pain =)
<Bayre_OOTW> Very true Tut
<Vestrial_Legends> is there currently a way to regester 'alliances' on Inno.com?
<Banadel_DotP> uber twink guilds? and those are?
<Cymric> jorom: any guild can effectively post a schedule currently. And ally itself with guilds to go. The issue right now is that some other guilds are allying themselves with smaller guilds -AND- taking their own 2 trips.. effectively going 4 times.
<Cymric> That's the main issue.
<Shylara_LB> I agree no on one booking, though I would consider allowing only one weekend booking at a time
<nyne_TP> hmm, I need to start a uber twink guild, sounds like fun
<Tut|Panth> I propose that we don't have an official guild alliance, but instead say "a guild can make a booking with any other guild it pleases, but that counts as a reservation for all guilds on the booking"
<Banadel_DotP> me too
<Goad_Unbroken> i like the idea of 2 booking but 1 on a weekend, 
<nyne_TP> anyone want to join?
<Bayre_OOTW> They would hypothetically be a guild formed by a huge guild simply to acquire more bookings
<Tallis|Iceni> i dont think theres a problem joining other guilds raids, as long as that guild has the most players up there
<Arenoth_Patronas> It seems most people like that idea
* Urky_Iceni is game
* Junx-LoD concurs with archi
<Vestrial_Legends> I prefer actual regestered alliances
<Amazar_ascension> Nyne -I have a few twink chars to join hehe
<nyne_TP> the weekend thing doesn't effect us, I don't see a problem with it
<Junx-LoD> If your guild name appears in the reservation , thats your slot
<Tut|Panth> actual registered alliances are too easy to abuse
<Idril_Patronas> the problem we are talking about is crowding, and frankly I do not believe getting the 5-6 guilds that are abusing the system to stop is going to end the 2 month wait between weekend bookings.  We need to encourage people to use the weeknights better
*** Mode change "+v Perdy_OOTW" on channel #innoruuk by Cymric
<Havlok_Amici> so in other words then the Hate plane Amici did a week or so back would take Legends booking.. Patrons.. Wicked... Spirit of the Moon...
<Tut|Panth> It also takes away freedom from small guilds
<nyne_TP> AND your name should appear on the reservation if you're sending more than 6 people
<Jorom> cymric that is perfectly understandable..but from the brunt of the conversation I am getting, it is basically saying that if you are in one of the smaller guilds and not a big uber guild, you in essence are going to get shafted as you are not going to be /allowed/ to book events?
<Cymric> idril: agreed.
<Bayre_OOTW> In all honesty, the number of bookings should be porportional to a number of members
<Tut|Panth> Frankly, I don't care who you go with, I just don't want you going all the time
<Junx-LoD> send more than 6, your slot = toast
<Urky_Iceni> Havlok : If they had 6 of each or more there then yes
* Tut|Panth nods Nyne, that's a good addendum
<Goad_Unbroken> I agree Panth, to be fair all allied guilds use a booking, that keeps it fair
<Cymric> jorom: no one ever said you wont be able to book.
<Banadel_DotP> Jorum you are so wrong
<Havlok_Amici> well we didn't have 6 or more of each of those guilds :)
<Cymric> Like Amici said, they only have 8 planes people. They book.
<Vorx-Justifiers> I agree, if you have 6 members on the plane, that is your post.  end of story
*** wildstar1 (wildstar@1Cust143.tnt2.durham.nc.da.uu.net) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Tut|Panth> Agreed
<Jorom> Banadel before you say I am wrong, please note the question mark on the end of that
<Junx-LoD> how bout we ditch the "uber guild vs small guild talk"
<Junx-LoD> as that just brings up heated crap
<Havlok_Amici> we had one Legends.. Vest... two wicked.. 3 or 4 Patronas.. 2 or 3 moonies.. and a few rogue guildless
* Tut|Panth nods junx
<Urky_Iceni> please do
<Junx-LoD> that we dont need in this channel
<Banadel_DotP> yes please Junx
<nyne_TP> havlok: that's fine then, don't bring more than 6 people and it doesn't eat their slot
<Amazar_ascension> I agree junx
<Idril_Patronas> Hmm... so only 6 total?  What happens when we are ready to kill Innoruuk and need reinforcements?
<wildstar1> #changename Trelani_Forsaken
<Cymric> Agreed... this isn't uber vs small, because right now, both are getting fair share. The only issue on the table is alliances that are booking extra, which we are all against.
<Irrani_Storm_> 6 from each guild idril
-> *wildstar1* use /nick
*wildstar1* tks
<Cymric> wild: do /nick trelani_etc
<Talmon_Storm> the real deal here is people agree not to schedule in a fassion that thier guild gets to go more than 2 times its once again a honor issue
<Vorx-Justifiers> yes, make it more then 6, each guild can have a group
*** Mode change "+v Winleth" on channel #innoruuk by Cymric
*** wildstar1 is now known as Trelani_Forsaken
<Arenoth_Patronas> I dont think bringing up more than 6 from a guild for an hour to kill a god is a problem
<Tallis|Iceni> getting extra up to kill cz/inny isnt a problem surely... its the whole raid that matters
<Idril_Patronas> 6 total not from your guild?
<Havlok_Amici> no problem... we won't bring more than 6.. and will surely have more than 6 ourselves
<Junx-LoD> if your guild books over 2 events (even allied) with your name on it - I say those events should not be honored
<Vorx-Justifiers> nope, 6 from each individual guild.. each guild counted on its own
<Irrani_Storm_> no idril, 6 from each alliance guild..
<Talmon_Storm> agrees with Junx
<Banadel_DotP> gotta Agree with Junx
<Junx-LoD> and any future events posted by those individuals will be questionable in wether they are honored or not
<Macmorn> yes lets avoid barbs what matterw here is allowing every planes capable players the same access
<Urky_Iceni> allies need to be mentioned on bookings as said already i think
<Junx-LoD> ie - abuse the system, get abused back
<Sandory_Aegis> lol
<Junx-LoD> you break the system, anyone that still follows can gladly walk over top of you
<Junx-LoD> as that seems about the only way to keep this in line
<Junx-LoD> and working......
<nyne_TP> basically what DoW did to us
<Tallis|Iceni> we saying that if you book a slot in your name, the number of guests you bring along shouldnt exceed 6 per other guild ?
<nyne_TP> no
<Amazar_ascension> Yes Tallis
<Irrani_Storm_> yes tallis
<Havlok_Amici> seems like it
<Sandory_Aegis> NO
<Vestrial_Legends> what did DoW do?
<Urky_Iceni> nyne : no?
<Idril_Patronas> I dont see how that works guys
*** Mode change "+v Goad_Unbroken" on channel #innoruuk by Cymric
<nyne_TP> we're saying if you bring more than 6 people from another guild, it counts as a trip for them
<Irrani_Storm_> if it does, that alliance guild will have to use up a booking
<Sandory_Aegis> no
<Tut|Panth> If you bring more than 6 people from another guild, that's their booking
<Arenoth_Patronas> it has to be 6 from a specific guild
* Tut|Panth nods nyne
<Idril_Patronas> I book a raid with 6 people, invite 2 groups of 6 from two seperate guilds.  How does that solve the problem?
<Boisvert_CrimsonDragons> Nynye: I totaly agree with you, if 6 or more come, it should count as a booking from that guild
<Irrani_Storm_> then all 3 alliance guild have to use a booking...
<nyne_TP> it means you eat reservations for 3 guilds
<Tallis|Iceni> ah so if you bring 8 from another guild, that guild are using a slot of their own ?
<Skykat_AMS> right - 6 from guild is a booking for that guild, nice
<Sandory_Aegis> ahhh nm.....  I got confused... ok
<Urky_Iceni> problem?
<lucy> problem is that shadow isn't fucking listening
<Tut|Panth> that's bookings for then Idril
<Arenoth_Patronas> but you said more than 6
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> So you get together 3 smaller guild and they all book and each of the smaller guilds has 6 people from each guild there for each of the 6 trips they get: DOESN"T WORK
<nyne_TP> tallis: yes
<Irrani_Storm_> yes tallis
<Tut|Panth> lucy: shut up
<lucy> Sorry, Tut|Panth, I'll keep my mouth shut. 
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I agree that 6 ppl from one guild should consitute a booking for that guild
<nyne_TP> rofl
<Idril_Patronas> But you said more than 6?  Are we talking 5?
<Winleth> So you are saying no maore then 5 from Alliance Guilds?
<Macmorn> I agree with the if a guild has 6 plus memebers in a plane that should count as a booking for them
<nyne_TP> I'd say more than 6
<Arenoth_Patronas> so 7 or more
<Vorx-Justifiers> What we are talking about it the spirit of the rule, right?  I would hope a guild would not break into 3 smaller  ones so they can go to planes more often
<nyne_TP> yes
<Winleth> Who would Police that?
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> yes 7 or more
<Sandory_Aegis> a lot of other guilds aren't listening either..... they will go in before a planned raid and wipe a plane out... that is wrong!  how do we make those guilds respect what is said today??
<Talmon_Storm> 6 people a full group that is fair most guilds can do a plane with 18 now
<Irrani_Storm_> no police..honior
<Arenoth_Patronas> it is all on the honor system
<Irrani_Storm_> err..honor
<nyne_TP> no one polices anything
<Tut|Panth> Everyone polices it, same as the existing system gets policed
<nyne_TP> it's an honor system
<Skykat_AMS> now if you agree to limit the guilds booking to only one weekend at a time i can go set up for vox <g>
* Tut|Panth nods
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> I am not saying I would do such a thing but I wouldn't put it past the guild that are breaking the rules currently
<Idril_Patronas> The problem is the people who _are_ looking the violate the spirit of the rule, we're coming up with lots of good ideas that just restrict the honorable people more
<Urky_Iceni> people notice in time
<Tut|Panth> the only way to violate that is to group with lots and lots of people from different guilds
<Cymric> Honor system.. but I doubt you wanna piss some guilds off and have them walking in on your raids, if you continually break the honor system.
<Goad_Unbroken> this is an honor system, it is iin all of our best interests to come to agreement, and more importantly abide by them
<Tut|Panth> IOW, you pick up group or something
<Junx-LoD> violate the spirit of the rule, and your scheduling will not be honored
<Jorom> one question...when you speak of /events/ here are we talking just planes or planes,dragons, VP, and other high level areas?
<Trelani_Forsaken> honor system   interesting that u would bring that up    justifiers_-3 trips sched this mont   company of wandering sould  4 trips sched
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed Idril
<Skykat_AMS> heck cymric, it only take sone one monk to wreck a plane raid
<Tut|Panth> Jor: Just POH and POF
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> Who decides you violated the RULES?
<nyne_TP> this only applies for poh and pof
<Cymric> jorm: just POH and POF
<Trelani_Forsaken> lords of edelo 5 trips sched
<Skykat_AMS> er takes one monk
<Macmorn> ok lets try to make some progress here and get some things agreed on
<writhe_Justifiers> umm... 3 this month for justifiers?
<Shylara_LB> It isn't per month, it is at a time
<Trelani_Forsaken> ano how many ffa?
<Cymric> skykat: true, but that monk would violate pnp too ;)  and be banned.
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> Who decides you violated the RULES?
<Macmorn> I motion that for now 2 guild bookings only one of which is a weekend..
<nyne_TP> you can have as many ffa events as you want
<Tallis|Iceni> they aint rules
<Tut|Panth> The server does, Shim
<Urky_Iceni> all current booking?
<Trelani_Forsaken> taken from the sched board  u broke no rules i must say
<nyne_TP> same as currently
<Tut|Panth> Read EQVault. =)
<Cymric> ok.. no one motion anything yet.
<Skykat_AMS> hehe cymric "but i thought i could solo" <g>
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I secong Macmorn's Motion
<Macmorn> also i motion if you have OVER 6 memebers on a raid thats a booking
<Bayre_OOTW> How bout each guild, for every multiple of 6 46+ members, gets a reservation token.  Tokens represent bookings in some fashion.  If they choose to use the tokens for allied small vs. small guilds, so be it.  Tokens could be tracked on the calendar (represented by booked events)
<Cymric> skykat: hehehe
<Idril_Patronas> So guild X gets pissed, posts bS to eqvault, and you lose your booking privleges?
*** Signoff: mitsurgurii_arcane_guardians (Leaving)
<Shylara_LB> I also think that current reservations have to be grandfathered
<Urky_Iceni> Bayre : hmm, no thats red tape central
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> SO we are going on the mob mentality enough people say you did it then you did how often do people get things wrong and how often to dislikes and such cloud peoples vision of the truth
<Banadel_DotP> Bayre: too hard to give the tokens out....would be like a full time job doing it
<Skykat_AMS> you keep bringing up number of planes capabel - any one else have a website where you list your members like i do?
<Tut|Panth> bayre: too much tracking, where's our token bank? Do we get an extra life if we kill Inno? =)
<Sandory_Aegis> most of us do Sky
<nyne_TP> shim: unless you have a better way of doing it, yes
<Banadel_DotP> yes Skykat most do
<Cymric> shylara: grandfathered?
<Goad_Unbroken> aye Macmorn, agreed, to bring the number of bookings down, can we agree to 1 weekend booking, 1 weekday booking?
<Bayre_OOTW> Could be Banadel, especially with changing member's levels

<Arenoth_Patronas> member listings can be faked, any system we do is all honor, and I think that it will work most of the time
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> I don't just seams like there needs to be a group that decides these things a council of yuou will
<Cymric> ok guys.. moderating the room
<Tallis|Iceni> 1 weekend and 1 weekday would get us all cycling through the bookings quicker

<nyne_TP> no, we were right =)
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> LOL
-> *cymric* I'm thinking we might want to have a floor or something
<Trelani_Forsaken> not acceptable  becuz u are discussing who should be able to go  u can't listen to only those who go now   that is the problem

<nyne_TP> AND we had the old eqv posts to prove we were right

-> *cymric* before we move to agenda items, I'd like to set some rules. =)
*** Mode change "+v Duakkad" on channel #innoruuk by Cymric
-> *cymric* namely what will and won't get you kicked.
*Cymric* heh ok
*** Duakkad is now known as Duakkd_TheWicked
<Skykat_AMS> you wicked boy you
<Talmon_Storm> we are trying to set some agreement that MOST guilds on the server will abide by that is all we are here for we cannot please all 4k peeps
<Duakkd_TheWicked> *bow*
<Cymric> Ok, Tuttle is going to list off some rules of the "chat" before we get started. Since obviously we have all agreed that, even if we dont vote the changes in for the rules, that this meeting is valid to discuss them and possibly vote on them.
<Tut|Panth> Okay, I'd appreciate it if people kept quiet for a bit while I do this
<Tut|Panth> The main thing to remember here is we're all here out of respect, we're trying to keep a smooth operation in game
<Goad_Unbroken> agreed Cymric
<Tut|Panth> So we should treat each other with respect in this channel
<Tut|Panth> I will not tolerate name calling and slander
<Tut|Panth> I will not tolerate harassment of ops or other people
<Tut|Panth> So, to that end, some rules
<Tut|Panth> 1) Harass an op and you get kicked
<Sandory_Aegis> agreed
<Havlok_Amici> guess we can't blame Jar now
<Tut|Panth> 2) Harass a person and get kicked
<Tut|Panth> 3) slander and op and get kicked
<Tut|Panth> 4) slander a person and get kicked
<Tut|Panth> Basically - act like a dick and get kicked. =)
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> good rule
<Tut|Panth> That's it. Should be easy to play like that.
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> <-- does his impression of a dick
<Jorom:#tp> damn that means I can't call tuttle a weiner in there =)
<Havlok_Amici> hmm.. good thing my real name ain't Dick
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Good Rules, Tut.  Thanks
<Thessaly_Ascension> Ok now, everyone line up for buffs.
<Cymric> Agreed, and it's done out of mutual respect for each other. We all want to be doing more important things right now, and we are all serious about the current rules set, and how you all get a fair share/fair shot at POF/POH, just like other guilds/alliances.
<Tut|Panth> one more thing
<Tut|Panth> Cym brings up a good point, we'd rather be doing damn near anything else, so cym has the agenda
<Havlok_Amici> this is where Tut tells Hav to stop trying to crack jokes
<Tut|Panth> When he decides to move to a new item, we move. Please don't keep on the old item
<Vestrial_Legends> we can hope
<Tut|Panth> And there's enough channel spam, please don't talk unless you have something to say regarding the rules
<Tut|Panth> Gay banter is okay, just not a lot of it. =)
<Havlok_Amici> sorry.. I can't talk with a lisp on IRC
<Skykat_AMS> for you fruitloops that gay meant happy <g>
* Tut|Panth is really done now
<Havlok_Amici> oh :)
* Thessaly_Ascension was wondering.
<Bodil-ashen> <--- newb to irc how to ya log this please ? :)
<Cymric> Heh ok.. those were decent rules. Does everyone understand them and willing to abide by them so we can hopefully make this quick and painless and fair for all involved?
<Skykat_AMS> you are logged in bodil
-> *bodil-ashen* depends on your client, /log may work
<Bodil-ashen> thanks
<Skykat_AMS> agreed cym
<Cymric> bodil: I'll have a full log and will post it on the site after we're done.
<Vestrial_Legends> aye
<Winleth> aye
<Perdy_OOTW> Yes Cym.. lets get the ball rolling now
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I agree whole-heartedly with those rules
<Thessaly_Ascension> aye
<Longy_DeusVult> agreed
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> yep
* Tallis|Iceni agrees with the above
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> Agreed
<Shylara_LB> yes
<Havlok_Amici> I'll keep it to an aye.. instead of a smart ass remark.. to save Vest pain
<Idril_Patronas> Yep
<Cymric> Ok, anyone disagree? ;)  (maybe I should ask this instead)
<Cymric> Ok.. first item on the Agenda then.
* Amazar_ascension hopes it involves alcohol
<Cymric> And let me say that we'll have an open forum afterward so we can discuss other "proposed items". One I'm adding to the agenda right now is the 6+ rule for alliance, but anyway.
<Cymric> - At end of reservation time, your guild must be out of zone completely, regardless of CR efforts. The 2nd guild has rights to allow or refuse CR efforts cutting into their schedule. 
<Cymric> Open forum for guilds to discuss that agenda item.
<nyne_TP> anyone disagree?
<Banadel_DotP> i'll agree to that
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> agree 
<nyne_TP> I thought this was implied in the existing rules
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I have mixed feelings about it.
<Shylara_LB> I agree
<writhe_Justifiers> add to that... this going to fear to catch respawn has got to stop.
<Cymric> It was implied, not stated.
<Goad_Unbroken> agreed
<Syd-LoD> that's kind of shakey, but, in terms of the guild entering the plane it has to be done
<Tut|Panth> agreed
<Urky_Iceni> doesn't seem to be a major issue, but yes agree
* Tallis|Iceni agrees with the above
<Idril_Patronas> Agreed, but we need some language saying we hope guilds will be obnoxious to folks who had a bad run
* nyne_TP nods
<Shylara_LB> hmmm?
<Urky_Iceni> err
<Thessaly_Ascension> you mean will not?
<Vestrial_Legends> will be?
<Idril_Patronas> will not be rather
<Arenoth_Patronas> hehe
<nyne_TP> that'd have saved us from DoW
<nyne_TP> no, I like the original idea
<Idril_Patronas> cut me some slack I'm dyslexic
<Irrani_Storm_> aye..agree with the hope people will be understanding..
<Bodil-ashen> agree
<Goad_Unbroken> hehe or hope that the next booking guild will help the CR along and get peeps out
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Personally, I would hope that most guilds would assist with CR if practical.
<Shylara_LB> yes, hopefully we will al help with legitamate CR, but we should be able to decline if the people requesting it are morons
*** Mchawi (mchawi@w210.z208176108.det-mi.dsl.cnc.net) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Skykat_AMS> AMS will always render a CR if we're next
<Havlok_Amici> I will agree long as its understood that some understanding and that if possible CR can be done soon..
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed Shy
<Idril_Patronas> Yes, we cant force people to help with CR but if we put that rule in place we should make it clear we'd like folks to be nice to one another
-> *mchawi* please /nick yourname-guildname please
<Urky_Iceni> shouldn't be `demanded' i think is the point
* Thessaly_Ascension agrees.
<Tallis|Iceni> i think most of us would.. provided the folks who need CR are patient and dont hassle
<Cymric> -nod- Is there a verbage change that anyone can suggest so that we imply that we think it's more honorable if they assist in CR's (like Pantheon does), but by all rights, they shouldn't be expected to?
<Talmon_Storm> ask Cymric to turn you on
<nyne_TP> The best way to do CR for people is to just clear the plane
<nyne_TP> unless you _really_ trust the guild in question
<Thessaly_Ascension> "The scheduled guild is not obligated to assist in CR, but certainly welcome to."
<Arenoth_Patronas> encouraged to
<Trelani_Forsaken> sounds better
<Shylara_LB> Say:  While we hope every effort will be made to assist with CR, the rule is...
<Thessaly_Ascension> agreed
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> How about adding: but it is hoped that guilds will cooperate with CR as much as possible
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> like that
<writhe_Justifiers> how about..  but is encouraged to.
<Thessaly_Ascension> on encouraged
<Tut|Panth>#tp> BTW - I was put here as guild rep so you know
<Talmon_Storm>    /e agrees with that idea most will help with CR I believe
<Idril_Patronas> Agreed Nyne, but that language sounds a lot like "if you have a bad run your screwed".  I'd like to soften it some and encourage people to be more cooperative in the Planes
<nyne_TP> I wouldn't say anything about helping with CR
<nyne_TP> people will do it or not
<Syd-LoD> yeah
<Irrani_Storm_> sounds good..i don't think verbage is that big a deal, sounds like everyone here understands what that means..
<Goad_Unbroken> Encouraged is good
<nyne_TP> I don't want anyone feeling obligated
<Idril_Patronas> Is why the language should be non-binding
<Syd-LoD> I wouldnt feel obligated to CR a guild
<Syd-LoD> its basically "hey, we're nice enough to CR you"
<Vorx-Justifiers> thorugh the respect that plane guilds have for each other is encouraged.....  yadda yadda yadda
*** Gregor_NorrKnights is now known as Gregor
<Arenoth_Patronas> has anyone ever refused to help out a guild that has bodies in a plane?
*** Gregor is now known as Gregor_afk
<Syd-LoD> Arenoth_Patronas: that too
<nyne_TP> it's basically impossible to refuse
<nyne_TP> you go in, clear the zone
<Syd-LoD> I'd have to agree with mr toes on issues of CR
<nyne_TP> and they CR after you leave
<Idril_Patronas> Well, not in hate
<nyne_TP> yes, but in fear
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> Most of the time in hate people don't loose a whole guild
<nyne_TP> and even hate to some extent
<Idril_Patronas> I guess I'd just like to see us try and get a little less adversarial in how we view guild relations int he Planes
<Tut|Panth> I think the main point is that it's nice to do CR for people, but no one should be obligated to
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I agree with the rule so long as some verbiage is added to encourage guilds to help with CR if practical
<Goad_Unbroken> the next guild does clear the plain, what we are talking about is will they allow fallen members to enter in their wake to grab a lost corpse
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed Idril

<duramis:#tp> Hey Now :)
<Idril_Patronas> And that language sounds adversarial to me

*** Steelhammer (chitwood@annex6-27.ecsis.net) has joined channel #innoruuk
*** Mchawi is now known as Mchawi_SOTM
<Sandory_Aegis> agrees with Goad
<duramis:#tp> how'd we end up doing vs Trak last night?
<Syd-LoD> if said guild nixs the CR, the guild needing CR is going to be pissed
<nyne_TP> no, I don't want people obligated to let people into the plane with htem
<Banadel_DotP> in thier wake of course but not during and endangering the current guild raiding the plane Goad
*** Mode change "+v Mchawi_SOTM" on channel #innoruuk by Tut|Panth
<Cymric> It does, I was mostly wording that at 5am in the morning, and I might have sounded harsh, so what's the best proposed verbage for that rule?
<Talmon_Storm> I agree syd there doesnt need to be verbage I think peeps currently help with CR and will continue to do so
*** Gregor_afk is now known as Gregor_NorrKnights
<Idril_Patronas> I agree Syd, lets just say "though we encourage guilds to work cooperatively when appropriate/possible"
<Havlok_Amici> who says the CR had to be done before you raid.. some take 6 hours to do a plane.. I'm sure after raid help for CR would be acceptable
*** Steelhammer is now known as Steelhammer_KnightsofBrell
<Urky_Iceni> Havlok : who said before?
* Goad_Unbroken agreed Baadel
<nyne_TP> I don't think we need any verbage along those lines
<Banadel_DotP> me either
<nyne_TP> what cymric said originally is fine
<nyne_TP> and neutral
<Havlok_Amici> just the impression I got from someone elses words :)
<duramis:#tp> how'd we do against Trak last night?
<Tut|Panth>#tp> died horribly =)
<Tallis|Iceni> its more than reasonable for the dead folks to wait until its safe for the scheduled guild before they do CR
<Talmon_Storm> aye pass it and lets move on no verbage, jsut get out when time comes up... you are always welcome to ask for CR
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> You don't enter a plane durring another guilds trip without being invited to would solve the problem that happend recently
<Goad_Unbroken> aye common sence says CR is done after the clearing, no riskin the current raid 
<Idril_Patronas> My beef is not with forcing people to help with CR, but with the language Cyrmic suggested.  It sounds a bit harsh to me
<duramis:#tp> ahh well, that was to be expected the first time out
<Havlok_Amici> exactly
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Proposed reword: At end of reservation time, your guild must be out of zone completely, regardless of CR efforts. Although it is encouraged to help others with CR when practical, the 2nd guild has rights to allow or refuse CR efforts cutting into their schedule. 
<Idril_Patronas> Perfect
<Arenoth_Patronas> exactly
<Perdy_OOTW> That sounds fair
<Skykat_AMS> fine
* Thessaly_Ascension agrees
<Tallis|Iceni> sounds good
<Tut|Panth> That's fine by me
<Talmon_Storm> great
<writhe_Justifiers> good
<Irrani_Storm_> aye
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> sounds good
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> sounds good
<Shylara_LB> works for me
<Macmorn> i think we need to addres the future users of the guild and adding encouraged would be good forthought
* Goad_Unbroken agreed Aerion
* Thessaly_Ascension crosses her fingers that no one is going to argue.
<Talmon_Storm> I think it is generally passed lets move on
<Irrani_Storm_> Does anyoen disagree? if not..next issue?
<Havlok_Amici> sounds good to me
<Duakkd_TheWicked> Never had this problem yet, but I'll agree anyway hehe :)
<duramis:#tp> any plans to go at him again soon?
<Macmorn> aeriuons sounds fine..agreed
<Tut|Panth>#tp> no clue
<Cymric> Ok, anyone disagree with ADDING this to the rules: At end of reservation time, your guild must be out of zone completely, regardless of CR efforts. Although it is encouraged to help others with CR when practical, the 2nd guild has rights to allow or refuse CR efforts cutting into their schedule.    ?
<duramis:#tp> well aren't you just a bounty of information :)

<duramis:#tp> ahhh
* Jorom:#tp points up a few lines
* Goad_Unbroken agrees
<Urky_Iceni> encouraged sounds like you'll be marked down if you don't but.. hey nm
<duramis:#tp> is it going on right now/
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> I can't spell but you got what i meant
<duramis:#tp> ?
<Tut|Panth>#tp> Everyone in the channel, mostly nyne since he has voice there, too. Just wanted it to be understood that I was official guild position. =)

<nyne_TP> I don't want encouraged in there
<Vorx-Justifiers> lol yes, just holding your piece has a differnt sound to it

<Banadel_DotP> has anyone had a problem where a guild actually didn't help with CR?
<Talmon_Storm> NOT I
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> nope
<Thessaly_Ascension> I think this is a majority situation, right? otherwise we'll be here forever on every little issue.
<Tallis|Iceni> nope
<Shylara_LB> nope
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> The wording also says "when practical" which means that if would endanger group, no assist.
<Arenoth_Patronas> no, I think the line just sets the tone for the planes, a new guild would get a better idea of how things are done.
<Banadel_DotP> I have yet to hear of one in months and months of plane raids....so it's fine how it is imo
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> I agree the majority says aye
<Tut|Panth> I don't think anyone has Ban, but I don't want it to be implied that I /have/ to help. =)
<writhe_Justifiers> arenoth: agree
<Jorom:#tp> this planes summit has absolutely no effect on me at all, I am 6 levels away from plane level and even when I do get it I doubt very seriously that I will ever go
<Idril_Patronas> The language we come out of this with should be neutral.  If the guild summit has phrases in it like, "when your times up get out, regardless of CR status" with no modifiers we set a crappy tone for future relations
<Cymric> I think consensus, with a fall back to 75% majority vote ?  That's usually how bills pass.
<Mchawi_SOTM> aye
<Duakkad_TheWicked> I don't think anyone really would want that bad Karma coming back to bite them in the ass really hehe
<Thessaly_Ascension> agreed cym
<Banadel_DotP> Tut: I don't either
<Talmon_Storm> THEN LETS MOVE ON THIS IS POINTLESS
<Bodil-ashen> The problem is usally with the people that need the CR , running in etc etc
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I agree that 75% should constitute a consensus
<Duakkad_TheWicked> Yeah let's move on
<Tut|Panth> Talmon - please avoid all caps. Cym will move the agenda. =)
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> You don't enter a plane durring another guilds trip without being invited to would solve the problem that happend recently
<Shylara_LB> what talmon said
<Irrani_Storm_> please lets move on, pretty please..
<Cymric> Wait..
<Idril_Patronas> Hmm... maybe we add what Shimm said as a seperate item
<Goad_Unbroken> verbage is majority aproved, lets move on aye
* Urky_Iceni cant see what is wrong in how it is written atm
<Cymric> there's still perhaps a disagreement with verbage?
<nyne_TP> yeah, use the verbage on the web page
<Skykat_AMS> seperate rule stating to not enter a plane unless invited no matter what please
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> <--- Thanks Nyne
<Tallis|Iceni> leave verbage to lawyers.. we here to agree with the principal of it, not the wording
<Cymric> is there any way else we can reword it so that everyone is happy with it?
<Havlok_Amici> we could sit here all day discussing the verbage of an item that.. as most here.. if not all.. have said there doesn't seem to be any CR probs
<Jorom:#tp> hard to do planes solo and a druid is not the top choice when looking for people to do planes...everyone already has plenty of druids
<Urky_Iceni> yes, leave out any pejoritives
<Havlok_Amici> what did Verant say... you can't pls all the players all the time
<Idril_Patronas> encouraged is a pejorative?
<Tut|Panth> I would agree that all verbiage should stay as neutral as possible on all issues. We don't want to even imply a dictaion of guild policy
<Banadel_DotP> exacly my point....just leave it as it is. there's no problems with it in the first place no reason to fix something that isn't broken
<Talmon_Storm> Over one hour has passed and we are still stuck on verbage of a generally passed item lets drop it please
*** Bayre_OOTW is now known as Abashi
<Goad_Unbroken> i agree Skykat, we need a separate rule stating no one shall enter a plane unless invited no matter what
*** Winleth is now known as Winleth_EON
*** Abashi is now known as Bayre_OOTW
<Idril_Patronas> Agreed Tuttle, but we also dont want to imply it's ok to be a putz
<Duakkad_TheWicked> No guild will enter during another guild's plane time unless it is OKed with the sheduled guild?
<Skykat_AMS> good enough duakkad
<Cymric> goad/skykat: ok.. I'll add that to the agenda.
<nyne_TP> that's implicit in scheduling it
<nyne_TP> otherwise, why would you?
<Trelani_Forsaken> cuz they don't know about this basically
<Duakkad_TheWicked> Well sheduling is one thing...but people coming in to camp out or do CR is another
<nyne_TP> no, not really
<Duakkad_TheWicked> It's not like they're trying to take over the plane, just pop in for a sec
<Tut|Panth> that's also OKed by the guild who has the plane
<Idril_Patronas> I may be wrong but the only time we've had folks disrupt raids in progress were people doing dumb things in CR or outcasts like Ceffen
<Trelani_Forsaken> i almost did it  didin't know about innoruk.com  till 2 months ago
<nyne_TP> if I sechedule it, it's mine
<Tut|Panth> agreed - you can interrupt a raid by precamping
<Arenoth_Patronas> going into the planes even for a moment can get everyone killed
<Cymric> We can't stop people from entering planes. It's respectful not to.
* Urky_Iceni has lost track already
<Thessaly_Ascension> Agreed, attempting to legislate stuff you cannot control weakens the rest of the guidelines.
<Shylara_LB> Also, if someone goes LD and can't get back in their time, they need to be able to go in long enough to gate out
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Discussion of a rule disallowing entering a plane without permission of scheduled guild has been added to agenda.  Can we move on please?
<Cymric> Ok.. let's get back to the first rule. Have you guys settled whether to use the original verbage or the proposed verbage?
<Tut|Panth> rather - in order to enter a plane when another guild is there you must get their consent, no matter how trivial you see the interruption
* Urky_Iceni votes original
<Sandory_Aegis> proposed verbage
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> agree
<Arenoth_Patronas> some want to use original, some proposed
<Banadel_DotP> let me put it this way, any wording we chose right now isn't going to effect people that A. don't read it or B. outcasts that like to screw with guilds during raids. So leave it as it is
<Thessaly_Ascension> proposed
<writhe_Justifiers> proposed verbage is fine.
<Mchawi_SOTM> 563

<Syd-LoD> oh
<Havlok_Amici> isn't that being rude?  or slanderous.. I gotta scroll back...
<Syd-LoD> I agree with whatever Tut|Panth does
<Tut|Panth> That's a first. =)
<Syd-LoD> yeah
<Arenoth_Patronas> well he abstained
<Cymric> okie syd. =)
<Cymric> Alright, so we've voted in the proposed addition to the summit rules of : At end of reservation time, your guild must be out of zone completely, regardless of CR efforts. Although it is encouraged to help others with CR when practical, the 2nd guild has rights to allow or refuse CR efforts cutting into their schedule. 
<Cymric> Next item...
*** Jarik (jirc@d9.rback0.milw.wi.voyager.net) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Cymric> Public events by "My character's name & friends" are not allowed.
<Idril_Patronas> Agreed
<Syd-LoD> yeah
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> agree
-> *Jarik* Jarik-Pantheon please. =)
<Shylara_LB> agreed
<Arenoth_Patronas> very much agreed
<Bodil-ashen> agree
<Urky_Iceni> agreed 
<writhe_Justifiers> agree
<Syd-LoD> that allows for too much exploitation of the ruleset
<Tallis|Iceni> agreed
<Vorx-Justifiers> yes
<Tut|Panth> agreed
<Banadel_DotP> agreed
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed
*Jarik* Bah.
<Syd-LoD> agreed
<Perdy_OOTW> agreed
<Thessaly_Ascension> agreed
<Trelani_Forsaken> ok if ur going to do that lets dedicate some  ffa time
<Longy_DeusVult> agreed
<Macmorn> agreed
<Cymric> when you mean ffa time, what do you mean?
<Tut|Panth> Trel - add that as an agenda item
*** Jarik is now known as Jarik|Pantheon
<Jorom:#tp> Just a curious question..from what I am seeing in here, only guilds are going to be allowed to schedule plane raids?
<Sandory_Aegis> agreed
<Tut|Panth> it's a seperate issue, IMHO
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Agreed
<Havlok_Amici> for defination.. what exactly is this meaning?  say Havlok and whoever else I drag or bribe to come with me?
<Mchawi_SOTM> schedule one day per month that is available for anyone to sign up you mean?
<Trelani_Forsaken> ok will wait till that is brought up then  
<Arenoth_Patronas> every booking has to be a guild booking
*Jarik|Pantheon* Ugh. This argument again.
*Jarik|Pantheon* Oh, fuck.
*Jarik|Pantheon* Bad idea.
<Jorom:#tp> What happens if you get 30 people that are 46+ and are not part of any guild? There are several out there that aren't in guilds and may never be
<Tut|Panth>#tp> No, but most people are in guilds anyway, so it's easiest to deal with that
<Shylara_LB> Interesting idea to add to the agenda, have a couple days a month scheduled as FFA so people can see how fun it would be without the Summit :)
<writhe_Justifiers> ick
<Arenoth_Patronas> lol
<Vestrial_Legends> heh, good call LOL
<Cymric> Havlok: that's correct. whether you're in a guild or not, and inviting everyone you want to, without marking it as a guild reservation.
<Mchawi_SOTM> also - something to keep in mind when it comes up, some of us have characters in mutiple guilds
<nyne_TP:#tp> there are 30 people 45+ that aren't in guilds?
<Thessaly_Ascension> better be non weekends. =)
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> devils advocate here, how can we dictate that only guilds and their members are allowed to go to thre planes?
<Jorom:#tp> I can probably find at least 20 people that do not want to be in a guild and are 46+
<Thessaly_Ascension> well, because if we don't all agree to a minimum set of guildelines, we're scrwed
<Goad_Unbroken> LOL good idea Cymric, some FFA chaos days to show peeps what it would be like without bookings hehe
<Vestrial_Legends> the use of 'public events' was being abused to allow for multipble bookings Shim
<nyne_TP:#tp> the point is, those people almost never organize raids
<Tut|Panth> well
<Jorom:#tp> lovetree is one that comes to mind 47 druid and doesn't want to be in a guild
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> dont want to be the only cleric that day :)
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Non-guild members would need to cultivate friendships with guilds
<Tut|Panth> to be honest, that was abuse because it allowed guilds to go
<nyne_TP:#tp> and there are tons of ffa days if they want to go
*** Signoff: Leonne_Arcane_Guardians (Signed off)
<Tut|Panth> with a later vote we will reneg that possibility
<Jorom:#tp> but..if they decide to, they cannot according to this summit
<Havlok_Amici> alrighty.. put me down as agreed on the Havlok and his smucks rule then :)
<Jorom:#tp> ahh
<Tut|Panth> So I don't see a problem with "Public Events" so long as they are actually pickup groups
<Idril_Patronas> schmucks
<Perdy_OOTW> Agreed Tut
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> i know that Vest, just playing devils advocate as I said, everyone pays to play how can we exclude someone not in a guild is all i meant
*Jarik|Pantheon* Have the public events types of people post a names list.
<Irrani_Storm_> good point tut...
<Idril_Patronas> Agreed, but they should not be booked in advnace
<Thessaly_Ascension> and of course there is zero way topolice that.
<Havlok_Amici> hey.. I'm outta school... I don't haf ta spell korrect
*Jarik|Pantheon* The whole idea of PEs was that "any 36 peopl should styill be able to go."
<Tallis|Iceni> pickups always take the ffa slots usually
<Cymric> Honestly, this is a "guild summit".. we can't govern trips by individuals if they should so enter FFA.. but they are advised not to. ;)
<Tut|Panth> HOWEVER, when a Public event is booked, a name list must be provided of at least 18 people
<Vestrial_Legends> were not, the nature of the planes excludes them
<Cymric> enter FFA on top of a guild's reservation, that is.
<Trelani_Forsaken> only one open ffa slot this month tho and i bet it will be taken before the month is out
<Tut|Panth> including guild affiliation where applicable
<Jorom:#tp> So basically, if you are not in a guild and you have a lot of friends that are not in guilds, either you wait for the ffa days and hope that you can get together or you just forget the planes all together
<Perdy_OOTW> ..and guild tags?
<Tut|Panth> right
<Arenoth_Patronas> a public event will always include members of a guild, and they really do not need another trip
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Non-guild members would need to cultivate friendships with guilds.
<Goad_Unbroken> Will the weekends be restricted from FFA bookings?
<Perdy_OOTW> That would prevent monopolization of a guild event
<nyne_TP:#tp> so far there has been exactly 3 outings of that nature in the server history that I know of jor
<nyne_TP:#tp> and most of those people were guilded
<Urky_Iceni> this isnt the topic under discussion?
<nyne_TP:#tp> and this is before anyone one but LOD could do it as a single guild event
<Vestrial_Legends> no its not
<nyne_TP:#tp> if this was actually an issue I'd agree with you
* Thessaly_Ascension has forgotten the topic. =(
<Idril_Patronas> Tuttle I dont disagree with the idea I just think it might open a can of worms we can't control
<Shylara_LB> Can we clarify what exact issue we are discussing please?
<nyne_TP:#tp> but for the most part, everyone does planes as a guild
<Jorom:#tp> understandable, but I am seeing a lot more lately of people leaving guilds for varying reasons and deciding to go it solo instead of finding another guild
<Urky_Iceni> no `me and my buddies' bookings
<Cymric> - Public events by "My name & friends" are not allowed.
<Tut|Panth> Idril - through name and guild listing we can easily find abuses of the system by peopl
<Havlok_Amici> it started off on public events by "my name and homies" are not being allowed..
<Thessaly_Ascension> ok, shall we just vote then?
<Idril_Patronas> Yes, but I could see the calender quickly filling up in prime spots with such events
*** Lotherat (~java@24.168.201.220) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Thessaly_Ascension> no pick-up posses in the planes.
<Vestrial_Legends> people, lets clear one topic before moving on
<Shylara_LB> So let us vote on that then move on to the other issues
<Tut|Panth> As the server continues to age we're going to have more and more people who can go to a guild as a group of friends and it shouldn't be outloawed
<Banadel_DotP> but they won't be recognized as plane raids Idril
<Tut|Panth> It's not impossible
<Trelani_Forsaken> how about this  no booking of friend ffa raids but set some days  (one of them must be weekend) aside to ffa the zone so that puck up grops have a chance to go
<Urky_Iceni> Tut : they can form a guild. no?
<Tut|Panth> So I'm not against public events, but if there is one scheduled we must have a name list
<Tut|Panth> urky: that's not an answer, there are lots of reasons to not form a guild
<Banadel_DotP> hmm not crazy about that Tut
<Shylara_LB> And add a agenda item of making 1 to 4 pre-scheduled FFA days that anyone and everyone can go to the Planes
<Thessaly_Ascension> I don't know, I feel it goes against the spirit of the bookings in the first place
<Tallis|Iceni> we just want to make sure 'public events' arent guild X with 2 bookings already really
<Thessaly_Ascension> and no one is going to have the time to police that.
<Tut|Panth> Agreed, Tallis
<Urky_Iceni> but one of the reasons to do so is to go to planes : cant have your cake and eat it etc
<Arenoth_Patronas> and they usually are ins ome form
<Mchawi_SOTM> so it mainly comes down to a matter of trust
<Thessaly_Ascension> so it's best to leave them off.
<Vorx-Justifiers> permanent FFA days might be good
<Banadel_DotP> cause Arven was doing it alot and just inviting guilds...we can expect that to happen quite a bit
<Vestrial_Legends> Tut, what are the conitions of the 'public event' you propose?
<Goad_Unbroken> I agree with prescheduled FFA days
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I don't think there is anyone who has played this game long enough to get to level 46 that does not understand that to go to the planes, you need to belong to a guild.
<Arenoth_Patronas> well if we make 7 or more ppl a guild event, then they cant do that
<Tut|Panth> Public events are events where there are no more than 6 people from a given guild that comprise the event
<Tallis|Iceni> just apply the 6 man suggestion to 'public events'
<Tut|Panth> rather, no more than 5 people
<Thessaly_Ascension> ok, and how will that be enforced? honor system?
<Tut|Panth> agreed, Tallis
<Tut|Panth> yes, same as everything else we discuss
<Tallis|Iceni> its all honour
<Vestrial_Legends> I like 6, one group seems resonable
<Irrani_Storm_> yes thessaly....EVERYTHING here is based on honor system..
<Macmorn> agree with vorx the 15th every month say
<Trelani_Forsaken> honor system is the only way to enforce anything that goes against verants rules
<Tut|Panth> 6 people from a guild comprises a guild booking, IMHO.
<Jorom:#tp> Tut, thank you
<Idril_Patronas> this is for a scheduled public event only, correct?  If I want to do a ffa raid with only PV members this would not make it count as a booking?
<Vestrial_Legends> correct idril
<Banadel_DotP> right Idril
<Winleth_EON> I dont see why you have to put a number on something. That disadvantages the small guilds
<Shylara_LB> Can we discuss one issue at a time please?
<Tut|Panth> right, Idril
<Urky_Iceni> quite
<Tallis|Iceni> not ffa... 'public event'
<nyne_TP:#tp> because if you don't put a number on it, people abuse it
<nyne_TP> because if you don't put a number on it, people abuse it
<Tallis|Iceni> ffa are unbooked slots no ?
<Vestrial_Legends> it also protects the smaller guilds Win
<nyne_TP:#tp> mischan
<Idril_Patronas> ok... and I think it should be "over 6 members", not 6
<Jorom:#tp> heh
<Cymric> FFA is unbooked, always.
*** haddon_amici has left channel #innoruuk
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed Idril
<Perdy_OOTW> But if they have more then 6, it's an official plane booking by that guild right?
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> ok question about the 6 people thing, this is to start a raod correct? just curious because sometime a guild loses people later in the raid and call on others for replacements is that still ok?
* Urky_Iceni agress with the original topic, and ask we move on
<Trelani_Forsaken> ok call them public events but they need to be in there
<Tut|Panth> Can we come back to public events after we decide on the six man rule, Cym?
<Banadel_DotP> this isn't a discussion on the 6 ppl rule yet
<Tut|Panth> Since it relies on that
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> if we make the 15th a public day isnt that an idea_
<Cymric> sure tut
<Irrani_Storm_> yes...thanks tut..
<Tallis|Iceni> agreed
<Tut|Panth> cool, let's drop the PE stuff for now
<Banadel_DotP> sounds good
<Tallis|Iceni> lets move on.. we'll be here all day/night otherwise
<Idril_Patronas> my view -- more than 6 people constitute a booking by said guild, and the numbers apply at a raid beggining
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed
<Perdy_OOTW> agreed
<Idril_Patronas> As I've said elsewhere, Im not going to let gear rot because bringing in a person to loot it would put me at 6+1
*** Boisvert_CrimsonDragons is now known as Boisvert-AFK
<Banadel_DotP> save it for when we actually discuss that issue Idril =)
<Trelani_Forsaken> i think that needs to be 2 days a month just like the guild on weekend day one weekday day   and we can let innoruk.com set the day
<Vestrial_Legends> we are
<Urky_Iceni> any chane of having current topic in the topic? we keep `forgetting'
<Urky_Iceni> chance even
<Tut|Panth> no, we're not talking about the six man rule yet
<Cymric> trelani: we'll add that, we're discussing 6 group rule right now.
<nyne_TP> proposed: "When scheduling a planes raid, if you are planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild as guests, that guild should also be listed on the booking and it also counts as a booking for that guild"
<Arenoth_Patronas> heh
<Vestrial_Legends> ah, thought you moved us to that, sorry
<Tut|Panth> Oh, we are? Damn. I'm out of it. =)
<Vestrial_Legends> lol
<Macmorn> i agree, more than 6 in a plane at any time your guild loses a booking
<Banadel_DotP> hmm guess I am too
<Banadel_DotP> I'll agree with that Nyne
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed Nyne
<nyne_TP> does anyone have a problem with that wording?
<Tut|Panth> Agreed, Mac/Nyne
<Idril_Patronas> Strongly disagree with "more than 6 at any time"
<Winleth_EON> I disagree
<Shylara_LB> Wait!  We are still on friends?
<nyne_TP> proposted wording only covers when you're booking
<Syd-LoD> agreed nyne
<Idril_Patronas> We often bring people in during a raid to loot an item so it wont rot
<Irrani_Storm_> aggre with nyne's proposal
* Goad_Unbroken agrees with the 6 man bookings rule
* Aerion_LoreKeepers Wonders when the topic changed
<Tut|Panth> shy - no, cym's just slacking on annoncing agenda
<Idril_Patronas> then lets say it in the language
<Shylara_LB> Did we vote on issue 2?
<nyne_TP> repeat: proposed: "When scheduling a planes raid, if you are planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild as guests, that guild should also be listed on the booking and it also counts as a booking for that guild"
<Mchawi_SOTM> 'more than 6, except for the purpose of looting an item that might rot'?
<Arenoth_Patronas> no we skipping issue 2 for now
*** Boisvert-AFK is now known as Boisvert_CrimsonDragons
<Tallis|Iceni> "more than 6 for the majority of the raids length'
<Urky_Iceni> Umm we moved on?
<Havlok_Amici> you guys are all politicians in real life aren't ya?
<Trelani_Forsaken> i'll agree to the 6 man constituses a guild booking
<Vestrial_Legends> "that guild must be also be listed..."
<Arenoth_Patronas> the proposed works
<nyne_TP> there is no way to handle it except at the time of booking
<Sandory_Aegis> yes..... I agree with Trelani on that
<writhe_Justifiers> *more* than 6.
* Tut|Panth nods nyne
*** Jarik (jirc@d9.rback0.milw.wi.voyager.net) has joined channel #tp
* Aerion_LoreKeepers agrees that 6 people consitutes a guild booking
<Tut|Panth> More than six is fine
<Boisvert_CrimsonDragons> Cymric: Perhaps to help keep us on subject, can you add the current topic to the MOTD?
<nyne_TP> if people don't stick to their bookings, we can't do anything about that
<writhe_Justifiers> 6 is not a guild booking, 7 is.
<Idril_Patronas> more than 6 at the time of booking, you can't police more than 6 at any time during a raid, it would make gear rot, and it's impratical for taking on boss mobs when you need reinforcements
*** Signoff: Thessaly_Ascension (Amazar is now voting for the Ascension.)
<Cymric> bois: I cant really. I'll just start frequently posting topic. ;)
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed Idril
<Vorx-Justifiers> can we also say that folks should not be anon, but set to roleplay when they are on the planes, so that they are not hiding their guild?
<Goad_Unbroken> i do believe bringing in a person just to prevent rotting of an item and taking them back out, does not count against the 6 main rule eh
<Shylara_LB> Are we going to vote on the person and friends rule?
<nyne_TP> vorx: no
* Cymric - Current Topic : <nyne_TP> repeat: proposed: "When scheduling a planes raid, if you are planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild as guests, that guild should also be listed on the booking and it also counts as a booking for that guild"
<Tallis|Iceni> 'more than 6' is fine.. if youve got 7 up there for 20 mins to loot something no-ones gonna be bothered
<Boisvert_CrimsonDragons> Cym: Sounds good, I see 10 ppl talking about 20things
<Vestrial_Legends> that doesnt even work IN the plane lol
<Urky_Iceni> thankyou c :)
<Havlok_Amici> you can't tell if someone is in a guild or not without targeting them and checking that way
<Havlok_Amici> far as I know at least :)
* Aerion_LoreKeepers agrees with the rule
<Cymric> vorx: you can do /guildstatus <name> on people.
<Urky_Iceni> if in the zone
<Tut|Panth> only in the zone, Cym
<Vestrial_Legends> it needs to be "that guild MUST also..." or it might be construed as optional

<Arenoth_Patronas> but if you are not in the zone, how will you know they are if they are anon?
<Vorx-Justifiers> but not if you are not in the same zone....  /who all justifier will show all justiies who are not anon

<Shylara_LB> yes
<Tut|Panth> why?
<Havlok_Amici> I disagree
<Cymric> Havlok: you disagree with the 6 man rule?

*** Duracrates (jasons@adsl-63-201-25-150.dsl.renocs.nvbell.net) has joined channel #tp
<Vestrial_Legends> why Hav?
<Shylara_LB> just because I think there are details I do not see people agreeing with
<Irrani_Storm_> like what?
<Idril_Patronas> I dont disagree wit the way it is worded, but I think people here have varrying interpetations of what it means
<Havlok_Amici> it forces us to make alliances to go with bigger guilds
<Duracrates:#tp> Heya Jarik :)
<Winleth_EON> if you have 100 peopel in your Guild and you take 6 from mine then someone is getting cheated if both guilds are charged one spot 
<writhe_Justifiers> not ture
<writhe_Justifiers> true,even.
<Jarik:#tp> Hey D
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> there is so much grey area it is hard to set a specific rule
<Urky_Iceni> The only guilds who could have an issue are small guilds relying on `big' guilds
<Vestrial_Legends> no it doesnt
*** duramis is now known as Duracrate
<Banadel_DotP> not true at all Havlok
*** Duracrates is now known as Duramis
<Urky_Iceni> which i think is the idea
<nyne_TP> uh, the rule is very clear cut
<nyne_TP> where is the ambiguity?
<Shylara_LB> For example, if 4 guilds with 6 people each go, they can go 8 times?
<Vorx-Justifiers> if you have say 9 people from your small guild, and 3 each from 3 other guilds, your guild is the only one that is hit with a booking
<Tallis|Iceni> it doesnt, you book.. you take say 8.. as long as your guests dont have more than 6 per guild its not a problem
<Boisvert_CrimsonDragons> Perhaps increase the number from 6 to 8 or something, but I think we do need something like this.
<nyne_TP> skylara: yes
<Idril_Patronas> Urky I have an issue with it because I often take people to loot gear who would otherwise rot, and oftne invite non-members to help with gods
<Vestrial_Legends> yes, thats why we need to address alliances later
<nyne_TP> there has to be a hard line somehwere
<Jarik:#tp> What a mess.
<Havlok_Amici> ok... on a raid.. we choose our friends... we have a number of them in one guild.. we take 7 or so.. and suddenly their spot is gone fomr the list and now they don't let us take their ppl and then we don't get to go
<nyne_TP> I see a lot of people bitching with no concrete suggestions
<Trelani_Forsaken> first they would never get 8 spots on the calendar 
<Macmorn> win a group of 6 of yoru guild could go and not be charged a booking seems fair
<Vorx-Justifiers> one gulid has to book it, and they are hit with that booking shy
<Urky_Iceni> Idril : not an issue..  no arguments about that
<Duramis:#tp> Idril's point is moot unless he has six or more poeple from the same guild coming at the same time to loot, which is VERY unlikely
<Tut|Panth> hav - that doesn't happen in practice
<Trelani_Forsaken> have u looked at it   its hard enough to get one day
<Shylara_LB> Why not Tre?
<Tut|Panth> vorx - no this treats both guilds as equals, they BOTH lose a booking
<Jorom:#tp> hehe Jarik, you haven't even seen the REAL messy part yet
<Skykat_AMS> is 9 a good number? half of 18 anyway
<Idril_Patronas> then lets be clear in this language -- it applies to the initial invites to a raid and does not preclude people from coming to loot wasted gear or helping with boss mobs
<Havlok_Amici> but with my current guild it IS how its happened...
<Banadel_DotP> Tut: exactly
<Jarik:#tp> I miss the first one.
<Jorom:#tp> it has been a lot worse all day =)
<Trelani_Forsaken> took my guild 2 weeks to get a password and this month was booked by the time we got it
<Arenoth_Patronas> that is why he made it planned in the wording
<Trelani_Forsaken> next month is booked all weekends
<Vestrial_Legends> hav, it simply means that each guild you invite has to chose more carefully
<Jorom:#tp> This has really turned into a big joke
<nyne_TP> idril: it is clear, it says at time of booking
<nyne_TP> edited proposed: "When scheduling a planes raid, if you are planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild as guests, that guild must also be listed on the booking and it also counts as a booking for that guild"
<Havlok_Amici> either choose more carefully or not lets our friends come along on raids
<nyne_TP> "When scheduling a planes raid" - read what it says =)
<Trelani_Forsaken> so that leaves us with weekdays  and in a small guild its hard to get 6 people to dedicate 16hrs on  wed night
*Vorx-Justifiers* which scenario hits both guilds....  i thikn if 9 from one, and 3 each from 3 other guilds go, only the first loses the booking
<Idril_Patronas> aye Nyne, I agree with the language, but people have disagreed as to what it actually means
<Amazar_ascension> Here is an example: Guild A brings Guild B. Guild A and B can only have one other raid scheduled
<nyne_TP:#tp> I'm tempted to say we should withdraw from the summit completely
<Vestrial_Legends> that is the choice that must be made, I dont get to invite all my friends either
<nyne_TP:#tp> I imagine lod would do the same
<Duramis:#tp> problem I see is a lot of the smaller guilds DEPEND on the larger guild to go on planes raids, if that's the case they are just going to have to accept that they will be charged with a booking iif  six or more of them go with another guild on a raid
<Amazar_ascension> Is that right Nyne?
-> *vorx-justifiers* I'm talking about the proposed ruling from nyne, that hits both guilds
<Jarik:#tp> I don't see that problem
<writhe_Justifiers> well thats an advantage to being in a big guild that has spent thousands of hours getting where it is.
<Goad_Unbroken> Small guilds go as guests of thier allies bookings
<Jarik:#tp> The way it's always worked is that the smaller guild band together
<nyne_TP> amazar: yes
<Duramis:#tp> well perhaps problem is the wrong word
<Havlok_Amici> big guilds don't NEED small guilds
<Jarik:#tp> Not smaller guilds with larger guilds
<Trelani_Forsaken> as guests u have basically no rights tho
<Arenoth_Patronas> yes, if they dont go as quests then the big guild gets 2 bookings
<Duramis:#tp> ahh I see
<Havlok_Amici> they're called big for a reason
<nyne_TP> trelani: then don't take the invite
<Jarik:#tp> First time around people just agreed to it by default
<Winleth_EON> When you have to wait two month in advance for a booking who really knows who is going tobe there?
<Jarik:#tp> LoA/NE, BH/AdV/K, etc
<Duramis:#tp> i c
<Havlok_Amici> they have the numbers to take.. why take joe smoe and his sidekick from Amici when they can take two from Leges
<Trelani_Forsaken> yes but then u don't ever get to go and that is against the spirit of the game
<Macmorn> i say if qa guild has 7 o rmore memebers in a plane then they essentially choose to book and should lose one booking
*Vorx-Justifiers* Every guild is allowed to book 2 events at one time...... if, at any guild breaking into a plane, they have more then 6 characters on the run, they lose one posting.  The original posting guild must either have 9 members in the group, or the most of any guild in the run
*Vorx-Justifiers* doh, not for you, sorry
<Shylara_LB> so again the 100+ planes capable people in my guild and my allies guild can go 50 each on two raids if we go together, but 4 6 poeple can go 8 times?
<Jorom:#tp> The problem that I have seen so far is that if you have 20 planar people that want to get together and do planes but are not guilded, you have no choice in the matter and have to wait for a FFA day or not go at all
<Urky_Iceni> Havlok : your point?
<Duramis:#tp> and in those examples, are both or all three of the guilds charged with a reservation booking?
<writhe_Justifiers> Havlok: you have the same right to book a plane, you just have to get others to support you and your effort.
<Vestrial_Legends> that means you have to pull from more guilds havlok. Nobody said being in a small guild would be easy
<nyne_TP> skylara: yes, unless you have a better suggestion
<Goad_Unbroken> this is a rule mainly to eaqualize alliances with Big guilds, and appears fair to all, and may reduce the amount of bookings, with is a goal of this summit
<Jarik:#tp> Jorom - Yes.  That's why Tuttle brought up the "We can't do this guild only thing - If 18 unguilded names want to reserve we HAVE to honor it."
<Jarik:#tp> That's the spirit of the original arrangement.
<Jarik:#tp> It's NO guild's place to say "unguilded people can't plan trips."
<Banadel_DotP> your making no sense Havlok....it's more then 6 people. not 2 or 3, anyone can take guests but when it's obvious that it's a allied raid with plenty of numbers of each guild present then your asked to share the boooking together
<nyne_TP:#tp> yes, but in practice it's only happened to abuse the system
<Jorom:#tp> yes, I saw him bring that up and I also saw it being shot down by almost every guild
<Havlok_Amici> my point is it deny's the small guilds who don't like the burocacy of big guilds who don't know one member from the next and who have massive infighting... it leaves us planeless
<Duramis:#tp> yeah, but Jarik, that allows people to abuse it and get more planes bookings
<Jarik:#tp> Nyne - Yes
<Tallis|Iceni> exactly.. if your raid is 8 of you and 25 from one other guild then thats their booking they are using
<Jarik:#tp> But with the 6 man rule added, now it's 'safer'.
<Jorom:#tp> true
<Duramis:#tp> true
<Vestrial_Legends> no it doesnt
<Arenoth_Patronas> it has to be
<Jarik:#tp> Jor -Yes, people are a bit too full of themselves in this room.
<Jorom:#tp> the 6 man rule will help it
<Vestrial_Legends> you can do exactly as youve done in the past
<Irrani_Storm_> havlok, how does it leave you planeless?
<Vorx-Justifiers> Every guild is allowed to book 2 events at any one time.. if, at the time of the guild breaking into the plane, if they have more then 6 characters on te run, they lose one of their postings.  The original posting guild MUST have either 9 members at break in, or the most of any guild present
<Urky_Iceni> it doesnt
<Duramis:#tp> so if you're gonna do a menagerie booking, you need to make sure that less than 6 members from youg guild attend
<Arenoth_Patronas> you cant make it only count against the guild with 8 ppl
<Goad_Unbroken> no it does not Havlok, you go to the plains in alliance with everal guilds
<Havlok_Amici> blah.. ok ok.. fine.. I have been over-rided by my others... carry on
<Cymric> The 6 person rule basically works for Avan/BH/Kogerne.. I dont think apart that they can break a plane individually.
<Tallis|Iceni> and if its 8 of you 6 of one guild 6 of another and 6 of yet another guild it isnt a problem
<Duramis:#tp> otherwise they are charged with a booking
<Duramis:#tp> yes I see how that makes sense
<Jarik:#tp> One of the reasons the GMs always stayed out of our arrangements instead of enforcing PvP was that it allowed /anyone/ to use the system.
<writhe_Justifiers> Havlok: so should the big guilds be punished, and have members that never make it to a plane for 2 months, since a plane really can't support more that 40 people?
<Tut|Panth> vorx - why does it need 9 members?
<Duramis:#tp> and cuts down abuse
<Jorom:#tp> Jarik agreed, I see a lot of people from guilds trying to support what is best for guilds and only a couple trying to support everyone in general
<Idril_Patronas> What if Havlok invites 8 Amici, 5 Iceni, 4 Pantheon, and 3 Justifiers? 
<Shylara_LB> I suggested it, make the scheduling guild be forced to provide at least half the people, or have it be both the 2 guilds with the most people there's slots
<Jarik:#tp> We make it "guild only", I wouldnt bne surprised to see a GM coming in and interfering.
<Macmorn> lets move on, to me its fair to large and small I vote to the last proposed wording
<Duramis:#tp> agreed
<Banadel_DotP> then Amici schedules the plane
<Vorx-Justifiers> that is up for discussion, the number that the posting must have, so there are no more mule guilds for planes
<nyne_TP> well, except that in practice, only guilds go
<Idril_Patronas> Agreed Banadel
<nyne_TP:#tp> well, except that in practice, only guilds go
<Duramis:#tp> the six man rule seems to solve that
<nyne_TP> mischan
<Jorom:#tp> I agree Jarik
*** Signoff: Skykat_AMS (Skykat_AMS)
<Tallis|Iceni> then thats Amicis booking Idril... and thats what we are agreeing is it not ?
<Tut|Panth> vorx - why the extra wording at all instead of nyne's wording?
*** Skykat (~java@1Cust142.tnt1.bowling-green.ky.da.uu.net) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Urky_Iceni> and only Amicis
<Jorom:#tp> If this is taken to far to the extreme, the GM's will more than likely get involved
<Vorx-Justifiers> hehe, i was typing not reading, scrolling back
<Idril_Patronas> I am trying to get clear on that
<Trelani_Forsaken> the way to aleaviate all of the bickering is to set days when anyone can go  so then no one will technically be  plane less
<Duramis:#tp> what would you consider too far?
*** Mode change "+v Skykat" on channel #innoruuk by Cymric
<Jorom:#tp> and then it will turn into a holy nightmare
<Havlok_Amici> since I'm the only one here who seemed to have disagreed.. and have since agreeded.. can we move on pls.. some of us have real lives to deal with.. not deal in politics on a Game :)
<Tallis|Iceni> but if its booked in amicis name and its 8 amici and 25 iceni then its icenis booking thats actually being used
<nyne_TP> doing it at anything but booking time is impractical imo
<Idril_Patronas> agreed Tallis
<Duramis:#tp> well, Verant has already stated time and time again that they do not support summits
<Arenoth_Patronas> then it counts as both
<Urky_Iceni> and Amici
<Cymric> trelani: plz stop jumping off topic. We'll get to that. ;)
<Duramis:#tp> Abashi at least has
* Tut|Panth nods nyne
<Jarik:#tp> Saying "Guilds only" even if that's the way we all know it will turn out.  Because at least our "rules" can handle the possibility of 18 casual nonguilders playing in the plane.
<nyne_TP> since the only way it's self policed is by looking at the calendar
<Jorom:#tp> Dur, as Jarik said..making these rules to where it benifits guilds only and leaveseveryone else out to dry
<Shylara_LB> What this does is encourages the big guilds to make uber twink guilds to make reservations
<nyne_TP> no
<Mchawi_SOTM> I think mainly the people that agree with the spirit of the agreement will follow it...
<Duramis:#tp> I understand Jor
<Banadel_DotP> nobody is going to do that
<Jarik:#tp> Shylara needs to be slapped.
<Tut|Panth> why? big guilds don't need to go really. =)
<Cymric> ok.. so what's the last proposed wording that everyone agrees on, nyne?
<Mchawi_SOTM> but with something like that, the 'mule guilds' will just continue doing what they have been
<nyne_TP> they could have always done that
<Jorom:#tp> sorry, didn't see Jarik post before me
<Banadel_DotP> if that was going to be a problem then it would have surfaced already
*Vorx-Justifiers* i have lost track, i was just trying to come up with verbage that would cover the 6 rule, and eliminate mule guilds
<Urky_Iceni> You cant get a slot till december for a start :)
<nyne_TP> this prevents large guilds from doing that shylara
<Tallis|Iceni> thats the whole point of this... we are all here to agree with the guidelines and follow them, not find ways to get around them
<Idril_Patronas> Shylara the nice thing about the old Plane guilds is they dont nead much gear now anyway
<Tut|Panth> exactly
<Jarik:#tp> Shylara's just being argumentative.  Give me a break.
<Perdy_OOTW> I think if you book it (no matter on how many members go, you use 1 booking) If people going with you consists of 6 or more people, they also loose a booking.
<Boisvert_CrimsonDragons> Idril: Good point
<Tut|Panth> We won't go through any extra effort to go, it's just silly
<Mchawi_SOTM> plus, honestly, most of the 'good' gear isnt IN the planes anymore
<Arenoth_Patronas> Patronas is even starting to get set up rather well on plane gear
<nyne_TP> perdy: that's what the rule says
<Jorom:#tp> Shylara is coming up with ignorant shit and is trying to find ways that people are going to cheat the system instead of relying on the honor system which in some ways there will be issues with people that have none but that can be handled
<Duramis:#tp> Agreed Jarik, if you have a six man rule, and LoD (as an example) creates a sub guild to book the reservation, and only like 4 of that sub guild go and 18 LoD show up, then LoD would get charged
<Idril_Patronas> I have everything I need from either Plane, nowdays I just go to help friends :)
<nyne_TP> if you're on the calendar, you lose a slot
<Tut|Panth> Right
<Perdy_OOTW> I like the rule as it stands.
<nyne_TP> if you are planning to bring more than 6 people, you have to be listed on the calendar
<Jarik:#tp> Yes, but the larger issue is, "LoD wouldn't do it, you ninny /slap shylara."
<nyne_TP> that's as simple as it gets
* Urky_Iceni nods
<Shylara_LB> I hate to seem self centered, but I still think that without a minimum number of the scheduling guild, this screws big (not uber, but big) guilds
<Duramis:#tp> very much agreed J
<Banadel_DotP> it doesn't
<Duramis:#tp> nor would any of the larger uber guilds
<nyne_TP> how so?
<Winleth_EON> How do you know two months in advance as a small guild??
<Vestrial_Legends> how shy?
<nyne_TP> I still don't see your point
<Tut|Panth> I don't see how it screws anyone
<Goad_Unbroken> our alliance came up with a radically different proposal to eliminate "Mule" guilds and yet be fair to all, that is to allow organizations to get a number of bookings equal to a number of plains capable members in thier guild or alliance, anyone see the login in this?
<Duramis:#tp> I don't think even Dawn of the Phoenix would try that
<Idril_Patronas> It doesn't, and with people leveling past 50 we can't pick a reasonable number.  
<Tut|Panth> There's no such thing as "mule" guilds
<Jarik:#tp> Exactly.
<Jorom:#tp> I think what she is trying to say is, example, jarik has 2 twinks that are planar correct?
<nyne_TP> unless you really think people are going to create 15 mule guilds
<nyne_TP> which isn't going to happen
<Jarik:#tp> It's just too much work, and no one wants to be in two green chatters anyway.
<Banadel_DotP> which they aren't going to do
<Tut|Panth> agreed, nyne
<Jorom:#tp> you get 20 twinks that are planar and form a seperate guild
<Jarik:#tp> Yep.  Never happen.
<Jorom:#tp> now you have the ability to double book
<nyne_TP> the entire system is based on everyone honoring the spirit of the agreemnt
<Duramis:#tp> right
<Jarik:#tp> Yes,. but no one has/would do that.
<Duramis:#tp> right
* Tut|Panth nods nyne
<Tallis|Iceni> exactly
<nyne_TP> if you're not going to do that, don't even bother
<Jorom:#tp> from most guilds, you are right Jarik, it wont happen but there will be someone that will try it
<Trelani_Forsaken> lets put it to a vote and see if we have  75%
<Cymric> goad: That becomes a nightmare of judging guilds based on members, and none of us have the administration or the manpower to police or to dictate that kind of legislation.
<Duramis:#tp> at which point we'll hold another summit
<Vestrial_Legends> and if a mule guild is created, we need to find out and revoke their abiltiy to make reservations
*** Signoff: Macmorn (Macmorn)
<Amazar_ascension> I think most people agree to *this* particular issue, lets vote and move on
<Duramis:#tp> and that sub-guild will be agreed to count as it's parent guild
<Tut|Panth> agreed, but that's a seperate issue
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> yes please
<Jorom:#tp> How do you find out though
<Goad_Unbroken> aye Cymric administration is a problem with that proposal
<Tallis|Iceni> the whole thing is a set of guidelines.. not rules, rules are enforceable, these arent
<Tut|Panth> It follows in line with the spirit of the aggreement
<Jarik:#tp> You know how well secrets are kept in EQ? :)
<Shylara_LB> because I have 70 planes capable people, the CoWS, my ally has 40 or so more.  I am fine with 6 guests only, so assuming a 30 person raid, each person can go one.  A smaller guild can do the 4 guilds of 6 and get 8 guilds per person
<Jorom:#tp> only guides/GM's have the ability to see station names and account user I'd
<Urky_Iceni> rules easier to spell :)
<Jorom:#tp> true jarik
<Jarik:#tp> If 3 people know something, it gets out, period.
<Jarik:#tp> And you need 10 to form a guild.
<Jarik:#tp> It'd last about a week, if that.
<nyne_TP:#tp> wtf guild is shy?
*** Nizdaar (schnoz@HSE-Toronto-ppp185968.sympatico.ca) has joined channel #tp
<Jarik:#tp> No idea.
<Banadel_DotP> you and your allied guild have the right to schedule 2 raids together
<Jorom:#tp> hmm no clue
<Nizdaar:#tp> I thought everyone would be playing today :)
<Idril_Patronas> or stop allying and schedule 2 seperately
<Jarik:#tp> Hey Nix
<Jarik:#tp> ....Niz
<Irrani_Storm_> shylara, you're correct..but at least we're limiting them to 6..as apposed to today, where there is no limit period.
<Tut|Panth> Right - if you create mule guilds for double booking that's against the agreement. I doubt seriously that it'll happen
<Nizdaar:#tp> How did it go last night?  Just stopped by to find out.
<Cymric> shylara: they'll have a much harder time killing everything if it's a bunch of small allies ;)
<Tallis|Iceni> yeh.. nothing we can do about that, we just need to trust each other that it doesnt happen
* Amazar_ascension notices that two hours have past and only one vote as been taken
<Jorom:#tp> light brigade
*Jarik|Pantheon* Tuttle - Can you please point out that no one, to date, has EVER created a mule guild - They're a paranoid invention, and besides, no secret can be kept by 'ten' people.  They'd unmask themselves before they managed to zone in.
<nyne_TP> shylara: if you don't like it, propose a better solution or vote no
<Cymric> OK OK OK
<Cymric> Let's bring the vote back up.
-> *Jarik|Pantheon* Already have. =)
<Idril_Patronas> And where would you put the limit?  No less than 18?  LoD or Pantheon could probably completely clear either plane with 12
*Jarik|Pantheon* I meant in that wording :P{
<nyne_TP> we did last week actually =)
<Jorom:#tp> Shy is The Light Brigade
<Cymric> When scheduling a planes raid, if you are planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild as guests, that guild should also be listed on the booking and it also counts as a booking for that guild
<Urky_Iceni> bah ;0
*Jarik|Pantheon* She's obviously not readin.  People hate being called paranoid, specifically - They stop fighting for fear of being perceived as nutjobs
<Cymric> Anyone disagree?
<nyne_TP> cymric: s/should/must/
<Vestrial_Legends> "must also be listed" otherwise agreed
<nyne_TP> that's important
<Tut|Panth> Shy - No one has ever created a mule guild EVER. It's a paranoid invention, no one can keep a secret between 10 people like that. It'd be unmasked before they even entered the plane.
*Jarik|Pantheon* Thank you :)
<Cymric> ok ok let me revise
<Shylara_LB> I like more than 6, but I also feel that the scheduling guild should be required to provide x% as well
<Tut|Panth> There's no need for that
<Cymric> Shylara: perhaps a different vote for that?
<nyne_TP> it doesn't matter
<Arenoth_Patronas> what does it matter?
<Tut|Panth> It doesn't matter
<Banadel_DotP> now your getting over complicated
<Tut|Panth> If you have more than 6 you lose a booking
<Cymric> Proposed amendment: When scheduling a planes raid, if you are planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild as guests, that guild must also be listed on the booking and it also counts as a booking for that guild.   Anyone disagree?
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> agree that doesnt mater
<Jarik:#tp> Sorry Niz - summit going on in #inno atm
<Tallis|Iceni> as long as its not more than 6 from another guild then that guild isnt hogging bookings and we all happy
<Trelani_Forsaken> agree
<Banadel_DotP> want to make this as easy as possible so it isn't a chore
<Jarik:#tp> Not paying much attn her e:)
<Arenoth_Patronas> unless your goal is to stop small guilds from banding together to go to the planes
<nyne_TP> if they send less than 6 people, they screwed themselves
<Urky_Iceni> 100% agree
<Vestrial_Legends> agree
<Tut|Panth> agreed
<Banadel_DotP> agreed
<Skykat> agree
* Goad_Unbroken agrees
<Shylara_LB> yes, add it to the agenda and I can vote yes 
<Winleth_EON> Why are we picking on small Guilds?
<Idril_Patronas> agreed
<Arenoth_Patronas> agreed
<Nizdaar:#tp> ah... okay.  forgot it was today :)
<Irrani_Storm_> agreed
<Jarik:#tp> Did good.  Got a clean shot at him, learned how to do the pulls, nicked him down a bit (70%)
<Perdy_OOTW> agreed
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> agree
<Jarik:#tp> Learned about 10 things we can do better.
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Agree
<Sandory_Aegis> agreed
<Vorx-Justifiers> agree
<Bodil-ashen> agreed
<Nizdaar:#tp> Great!
<Tallis|Iceni> agreed
<Havlok_Amici> agreed
<Longy_DeusVult> agreed
<Winleth_EON> agreed
<Cymric> any abstains or disagreements?
<Urky_Iceni> Winleth : we aren't, please read up.
<Banadel_DotP> lets move on
<Jarik:#tp> I figure next trip in 2 weeks, we knock him to 30% with the new tactics, then after that, we kill him with tactics+levels.
<Cymric> Ok... next item then.
<Jarik:#tp> Funniest part was after the raid, like 5 people went out and dinged up.
<Jorom:#tp> Hey Jarik, in two weeks, I should be getting close to 50
<Jarik:#tp> Sweet :)
<Cymric> - Public events by "My name & friends" are not allowed. 
<Nizdaar:#tp> Hehe, a level for 5 people would have made a difference :)
<Jorom:#tp> I got 2 full bubs in 40 last night in about 5 hours
<Jarik:#tp> --> #inno: We cannot say that.
<Jorom:#tp> only one bub from 41 now
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> I agree 
<Tut|Panth> Okay, with the new Six Man Rule, I think we can allow public events SO LONG as all participants are listed in the booking
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed
<nyne_TP> require a url pointing to a roster of commited people
<Tut|Panth> Right
<Tut|Panth> That'd work too
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Agreed
<Tallis|Iceni> agreed
<Havlok_Amici> agreed
<Skykat> i can do that nyne
<Sandory_Aegis> agree
<Jarik:#tp> --> #inno: That isn't our place.  We cannot /prevent/ the general nonguilded public from playing in a zone without risking interference from the VI staff.
<Irrani_Storm_> sounds fine
<Amazar_ascension> My read of that is this: I cannot schedule an event that is restricted to me and friends. Public means publis right?
<Banadel_DotP> that would would Nyne
<Jorom:#tp> from what I have seen of 40 so far and what I was told 2 bubs of exp in 5 hours is moving pretty good, is that right?
<Trelani_Forsaken> for 2 monts in advance u want a list of commited people?
<Bodil-ashen> are we voting on not allowing public events or allowing them?
<Jarik:#tp> Not bad :)
<Nizdaar:#tp> yes, Jorom
<Vestrial_Legends> Yes Tre.
<Jorom:#tp> solo at that =)
<Idril_Patronas> if you want to do that require public events to make a posting of the attendee roster  on Innoruuk.com's message boards
<Jorom:#tp> I have learned the art of kiting 4 dorfs at once =)
<nyne_TP> I'd rather a url
<Idril_Patronas> Set up a seperate board for planes discussions
<Nizdaar:#tp> Well, I"m outta here.  Just stopped by to see how things went.
<Nizdaar:#tp> *wave*
<Tut|Panth> Public events means public events not guild events, to that end we need to know who's going so we can see if the six man rule was violated when sechduling a public event
<nyne_TP> if that's a url to the message board that's fine
<Banadel_DotP> if your reserving a public event it's going to be 2 months in advance and you can take the time to list the people you are inviting to come along
*** Signoff: Nizdaar (Leaving)
<Jarik:#tp> nyne: A message is a url
<Shylara_LB> So I could invite 6 LBers, 6 Cows, 6 LOD and 6 LoE and it would not count to any of us?
<nyne_TP> I don't want to go search for the list
<Cymric> -nod- I can make a form that lists the attendees of a public event.
*** Longy_DeusVult has left channel #innoruuk
<nyne_TP> shylara: yes.
<Perdy_OOTW> I like the URL idea.  Do all the guilds here have a webpage roster?
<Skykat> i thought there were no public events
<nyne_TP:#tp> nod, I said that =)
<Arenoth_Patronas> we are debating that now
<nyne_TP:#tp> I want a direct link to it
<Tut|Panth> There aren't ATM. I want them back for really small guilds.
<Jarik:#tp> shylara: In theory, yes.  In practice, please show me one time that's happened in over a year.
*** Longy_DeusVult (dktravis@ppp-208-191-235-149.dialup.crchtx.swbell.net) has joined channel #innoruuk
<Tut|Panth> It is very possible, especially since Kunark, that you can take 18 random people and break a plane
<Arenoth_Patronas> why for really small guilds?  Cant they just sign up?
<Jorom:#tp> hehe
<Tut|Panth> And I don't want to outlaw it
<Tallis|Iceni> we allow public events, but if that event has 7+ from one guild then its that guilds event
<Goad_Unbroken> if Cymric can make a form for attendees, all the better
* Tut|Panth nods Tallis
<Idril_Patronas> Aye the trend now is actually towards smaller guilds
<Urky_Iceni> need less ppl to get `stuff'
<nyne_TP> tallis: not really
<Trelani_Forsaken> how about we list a public even as part of the 6 man rule  if there are not 6 members from a guild its a public event
<Arenoth_Patronas> it seems public events should be for unguilded people to have a chance at the planes
<nyne_TP> if they have 7+ people from a guild on the roster, they should schedule it as that guild
<Banadel_DotP> I agree with Trelani
<Skykat> agrees with nyne and tre
<Tut|Panth> The only extra requirement is that for Public Events you must include a roster
<Shylara_LB> So me and my friends will just book every available spot
<Idril_Patronas> agreed with Nyne -- lets be clear it is 7+ not 6+ :P
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed Nyne, but if they hadnt, they lose a res if they have 2 already
<Shylara_LB> ?
<Idril_Patronas> gah
<Banadel_DotP> why are you so set on beating the rules Shy?
<Arenoth_Patronas> shylara has a point heh
<Idril_Patronas> 7 or more
<Shylara_LB> Doesn't anyone else see a problem with people abusing this?
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I would think a "public" event is a public event.  Should not matter who goes.  It's basically a FFA
<nyne_TP> skylara: yeah, and you'll lose guild bookings
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> I think it could say every 15th in the month 
<Jarik:#tp> Nyne- Append: People scheduled in a 'public event' cannot be scheduled in more than one at a time.
<Skykat> the thing is to spcifically pick just a few days for public is all
<Banadel_DotP> if it's abused we will pick it up and those reservations won't be honered
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> People that want to abuse the rules Shy are going to find a way no matter what we decide
<Cymric> I see how it can be abused.
<Irrani_Storm_> not if only 6 from each guild attends..
<Tut|Panth> Shy - if you habitually abuse the rules, you lose the rules
<nyne_TP:#tp> make it two
<Vorx-Justifiers> hehe, i still think letting public events spawn from available ffa is good, and not allowing public events...  shy's point may not be fixable
<Urky_Iceni> prefer the 1 or 2 days a month thing
<Jarik:#tp> Better
<Goad_Unbroken> i dont't see a problem with Public Booking abuse so long as participants are listed, AND there are no more than 7 from any 1 guild goin
<nyne_TP:#tp> so they're on equal footing with guilds
<Jarik:#tp> Phrase it 'the current max'
<Jorom:#tp> I missed the part where they spoke about when these public events would be allowed
<Bodil-ashen> I say no to public events, since there is no way to police these, this only opens the possibility for abuse from guilds gettting extra booking
<Tallis|Iceni> well... if public events gets abused then i guess they will be removed again... its all about us follwing the spirit of it, not trying to find ways around it
<Trelani_Forsaken> i think if we can get some ffa  the booking of public wouldn't be a problem but i can't bring that up  its off topic
<Jarik:#tp> Since we're going to lower the current max before this is over, I'm guessing.
<Skykat> i have to go folks, i will read the rules you come up with and abide by them, good fortune to those making them

<Shylara_LB> but if I invite friends from other groups 6 at a time I am following the rules?
<Tut|Panth> the policing happens at book time and is easily policed
<Tut|Panth> shy - yes
<Idril_Patronas> Yes Shylara
<nyne_TP> skylara: yes
<Arenoth_Patronas> you could take 18 ppl, without taking more than 6 from a guild, and reserve 18 slots
<Bodil-ashen> yes but anyone can post names , that doesnt mean they will take those people
<Perdy_OOTW> Yes, but it's greedy.
<Tut|Panth> But you have to submit a roster for a Public Event
<Tut|Panth> So you'll never be able to do it all the time
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> If days are set aside I think it should be for the people who are unguilded, so that the rules cannot be abused the way Shy is suggesting
<Vorx-Justifiers> exactly Arenoth, I say ban the public events
<Arenoth_Patronas> I think setting up days for public events could work better
<nyne_TP> append: people on the roster cannnot be participating in more than 2 public events currently booked and the roster must be 80% of the expected turn out
<Tut|Panth> Banning public events means banning small groups of people who want to play in the planes. That's not cool.
<Perdy_OOTW> I agree Arenoth
<Vorx-Justifiers> yes, the ffa days, like the 10th and 20th or something

<Arenoth_Patronas> how many public events a month were there usually?
<Shylara_LB> I agree, set aside days.  Dispite common perception, I am not interested in abusing the rules, but there are people that will.  That is why we are having this fun now
<Idril_Patronas> As we all level up the Planes are going to be more and more accessible to small groups
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> can we agree on some rules about those public events 
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> Won't it be obvious if the same groups of certain guilds are taking up all the FFA spots?
<Bodil-ashen> yea public events for non-guilded people. The problem is i dont see this, i see guilded people getting extra bookings this way
<Duramis:#tp> this is just silly
<Tut|Panth> I disagree with set aside days because they will just rot
<Duramis:#tp> go with the six man rule
<Jorom:#tp> pre set ffa days would constitute unguilded=NEVER get a prime time booking
<nyne_TP:#tp> yeap
<Duramis:#tp> exactly
<nyne_TP> no, they won't
<Perdy_OOTW> Unless they have x days to get filled, or a guild can book it
<Jarik:#tp> Set-aside days would end up being mass hysteria as people just run around willy nilly.
<Idril_Patronas> Is our goal here to prevent individuals from going more than twice a month or guilds from going more than twice?
<Arenoth_Patronas> we could allow only a few public events a month?
<nyne_TP> it'll just be a race between the guilds
<Vorx-Justifiers> If we make it so there are days that are never booked, forced to stay FFA, then could not people just put their "Public Events" on those days in spirit and just show up, instead of having people hog slots by posting public events?
<Tut|Panth> Oh, preset FFA
<Tut|Panth> That's no good, either. Only big guilds win that
<Banadel_DotP> yeah
<nyne_TP> preset FFA days won't be for unguilded people,t hey'll never win the race
<Tut|Panth> Right
<Idril_Patronas> Agree with Tuttle again -- big guilds with east coast members get every ffa day then

<nyne_TP:#tp> someone just needs to write up a modified version
<Urky_Iceni> been there seen that
<Cymric> FFA days for members of guilds that have no bookings on calendar (including alliances) ?
<Tut|Panth> Preset FFA means unguilded people will never get a shot
<Cymric> or for non guilded members.
<Vorx-Justifiers> that big guild on the east coast better not send more then 6 people though ;-)
<Duramis:#tp> hmm, Cymric has a good ida

<Tut|Panth> It's FFA

<Duramis:#tp> if you were going to do preset FFA days, Cymric's idea would be a good one. however, I'm still opposed to the idea
<Arenoth_Patronas> could we say that we allow 1 or 2 public bookings a month?
<Banadel_DotP> if they want to do it FFA they can do it on a day that isn't scheduled
<Bodil-ashen> How many unguiled people do ya think there are ? even if they are they are usally friends with a guild , that they would most likely end up brining
<nyne_TP:#tp> you have to allow unguilded people to schedule 
<nyne_TP:#tp> or else it won't work
<Cymric> Pre-set FFA days where no guild can schedule on top of, that members of guilds or unguilded people can attend as long as they are not booked in a guild or alliance?
<Idril_Patronas> I'd say 10-20% of the 46+ folks are unguilded.  in the future will be more
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> i tend to agree with Bodil on that
<Jorom:#tp> yup
<Tut|Panth> agreed, with the six man rule I don't think PEs can be abused nearly as much
<Duramis:#tp> yep
<Tallis|Iceni> yeh
<Duramis:#tp> You go Archi
<Irrani_Storm_> aye..i agree bodil, if you're unguilded and want to go to planes, just ask a guild if you can go along...
<Perdy_OOTW> Agreed Bodil
<Tallis|Iceni> if they are.. it is noticed
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> I agree with Bodil
<Bodil-ashen> if it were 10 unguilded people i would say yes
<Urky_Iceni> you set a cap on the number of PEs?
<nyne_TP> it's easy.  allow people to schedule public events with a posted url to a roster. 
* Aerion_LoreKeepers wonders what "PE" means
<Tut|Panth> No cap, but with nyne's amendment it's not needed
<nyne_TP> public event
<Arenoth_Patronas> like 1 weekend and 1 weekday a month
<Goad_Unbroken> aye I dont believe too many people remain ungiulded who wish to go to the plains
<Shylara_LB> I would hate to think my guild members would have to leave the guild to be able to go on a plane raid.  As it is now with a normal raid of 30 people, some will not be able to go in two bookings
<Idril_Patronas> I'd say public events are fine, but no weekends
<Tut|Panth> nyne - can you recap the proposal?
<nyne_TP> public event clause is going to have to be complicated
<Banadel_DotP> I think the 6 man rule kinda solves this problem
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> setting aside one weekend a mointh for PE's hurts though because you can barely get a weekend now
<Duramis:#tp> I don't know if this got answered already, but what possible punishment is there for guilds who don't uphold the summit?
<Vestrial_Legends> yes it is Nyne
<Jorom:#tp> Hey Pantheon..when I get to 46 can I go on planes runs with you guys?? God knows I'll never be able to book for myself and 18-20 unguilded friends cept during the week when most of us have to get up and go to work the next day
<Duramis:#tp> it's not like WE can do anything
<Jarik:#tp> 46?  Of course Jor
<Goad_Unbroken> i agree no weekend bookings for public events
<Idril_Patronas> 2 months between weekend bookings now
<nyne_TP> that's not fair
<Jorom:#tp> heh J
<Tut|Panth> It's not fair
<Jarik:#tp> You'll want a buffer on it, like half a level.
<nyne_TP> you have to allow them to schedule weekends
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> no weekend public events I agree
<Tut|Panth> Then public events don't get primetime
<Jarik:#tp> Death = 1 bubble lost
<Jorom:#tp> oh I'm not even going to consider planes until I'm at least one bub from 47
<Tut|Panth> And they should be allowed as much primetime as real guilds
<Urky_Iceni> seems fair, there has to be some advantage to guilds
<Jarik:#tp> Nah.  Couple bubbles is good enough.
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> then is isnt fair to the guilds either because we get no where near 1 weekend booking a month
<Jarik:#tp> Just enough to make sure you can zone in once after death.
<Idril_Patronas> I want people to be able to do pick up runs, but I do not think they should be equal in status to guild raids
<Tut|Panth> the advantages to guilds are in the game itself
<Duramis:#tp> half a level is fine Jorom, even two bubbles
<Goad_Unbroken> mmm too true Tut, your right
<Vestrial_Legends> public events mostly consist of people from 'real guilds' Tut
<Jorom:#tp> you forget Jorom=death magnet

<nyne_TP> Public events can be scheduled on the calendar.  They must include a link to

<Jarik:#tp> "two public events that are on the calendar at the same time."  Simultaneously implies 2 places at once
<Shylara_LB> I like the only scheduled to attend one PE at a time, I vote yes with that addition
<nyne_TP> why?
<Idril_Patronas> Its going to cause problems if this is allowed for weekends, imo
<Irrani_Storm_> lol..course..since it's only 80%..i can be in every pe..and be apart of the 20%
<Jorom:#tp> agreed jarik
<Vestrial_Legends> this last change should prevent much abuse, but I still feel that PEs will never be used as we intend
<nyne_TP> one sec, let me fix this
<Bodil-ashen> Because its gonna be a way for peopple to abuse the system, who is gonna police these?
<Vestrial_Legends> I agree idril
<Urky_Iceni> I think PEs should be capped if guilds are
<Tut|Panth> idril - it'll be next to impossible in practice for people to get up the roster for a PE fast enough to take all the weekend slots
<Tut|Panth> WITH the new wording
<nyne_TP> ok, last edit I think
<nyne_TP> Public events can be scheduled on the calendar.  They must include a link to
<nyne_TP> a roster of expected attendees.  The roster should attempt to list 80% of
<nyne_TP> the expected attendees.  If more than 6 people from the same guild are
<nyne_TP> expected to attend, then it constitutes a guild booking, not public event.
<nyne_TP> No person can be scheduled to attend two public events that are on the
<nyne_TP> calendar concurrently.
<Irrani_Storm_> lol..course..since it's only 80%..i can be in every pe..and be apart of the 20%
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I'm afraid I agree 100% with the intent of this rule, but I see WAY too much potential for abuse.
<Bodil-ashen> If its for the non guilded people, roster should include 12 non guilded people
<Idril_Patronas> I disagree.  If I wanted to schedule one I could prob get a roster up and take a weekend by this afternoon

<Shimmerdark_Patronas> ok then change it to only 2 PE's can be on that calendar at any given time, same as guilds
<Bal_Forsaken> agree nyne
<nyne_TP> aerion: ok, how?
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed Aerion
<Jarik:#tp> #inno --> PEs will very likely never be used as intended, but it's absolutely not our place to invent rules that exclude people who are not here, and doesn't even leave them with a POSSIBILITY of scheduling a plane raid.
<Arenoth_Patronas> should we limit the number of PE bookings?  There is not likely to be a true PE event anyways.
<Tut|Panth> PEs are not guild and shouldn't be treated as such
<Vestrial_Legends> I could take a weekend as we speak
<Urky_Iceni> me too
<Shylara_LB> me 3
<Shimmerdark_Patronas> i think all concerned should be treated equally
<Urky_Iceni> abuse is going to happen
*** Mode change "+v Perdy_OOTW" on channel #innoruuk by Cymric
<Idril_Patronas> I would take 6 of the best from PV, 6 more from SotM, 6 more from Legends and have a raid 
<Bodil-ashen> yes it is but this is just another format for abuse to happen
<nyne_TP> the roster limitations prevent more than a certain amount of PEs from being on the calendar
<Tut|Panth> PEs will very likely never be used as intended, but it's absolutely not our place to invent rules that exclude people who are not here, and doesn't even leave them the POSSIBILITY of scheduling a plane raid
<Goad_Unbroken> hmmm must contain nonguilded players, would enforce the spirit of the PE
<Tut|Panth>#tp> happy? =)
<Jarik:#tp> #inno --> Could?  Yes. Would you?  No.  Why?  The vast majority of the people, as shown by the last summit /want/ to play nice, and we can't invent rules that cover every extreme.
<Jarik:#tp> danke :)
<Arenoth_Patronas> well now that is interesting
<Idril_Patronas> I like the idea tuttle I just think weekends are not plausable for it
<Urky_Iceni> just leave a guild for a few hours .. n'est pa?#
<Tut|Panth> Idril - with the "person may not be on two bookings" rule for PEs, that won't happen
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Any PE would need some people to go with planes experience.  That means guilded ppl
<Vestrial_Legends> who are we excluding Tut?
<Idril_Patronas> and the majority of the server population will react badly
<nyne_TP> it's very likely that people doing PEs aren't going to be able to do them on weekdays
<Cymric> What's wrong with adding an addendum to disallow members of guilds that currently have bookings on the calendar to participate in the PE?
<nyne_TP> urky: it's policed at the level of the booking, not who actually shows up
<Vestrial_Legends> right tut, wed just form 6 different rosters and take 12 slots
<Tut|Panth> We're excluding people who aren't here, small guilds with no representation. We're excluding people with no guild affiliation.
<Jarik:#tp> Cym - I like it.

<Arenoth_Patronas> oh I like that Cymric
<Vestrial_Legends> are we?
<Tut|Panth> I like that idea, Cym
<nyne_TP:#tp> I don't think it really matters actually
<Idril_Patronas> Cymric because raids without experienced people (most likely from guilds) will not succeed
<Arenoth_Patronas> it makes it tough for PE to go, but still possible
<Tut|Panth>#tp> It doesn't, I don't think. Doesn't hurt either
<Vestrial_Legends> how many unguilded people dont know anyone in a guild?
<Urky_Iceni> nyne, even with guild bookings..  the roster and who show is very different :)
<nyne_TP:#tp> well, yeah
<Syd-LoD> well
<Cymric> you can find experienced people that dont have current booked raids
<Amazar_ascension> That is a great idea Cym
<Idril_Patronas> In practice it just means more CR
<Syd-LoD> I don't foresee
<Syd-LoD> any PE
<Tut|Panth> Then don't bring 7+ people from that guild, Ves
<Syd-LoD> being like
<nyne_TP:#tp> it means that if a guild has someone in a PE, they can't schedule
<Jarik:#tp> nod archi
<Syd-LoD> 20 people from lod, and 15 randoms
<nyne_TP:#tp> it negates the 6 man rule
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> I like the idea Cym
<Syd-LoD> I don't think that's going to happen so that people can exploit the rules in their favor to have multiple guild bookings
<Syd-LoD> er
<Amazar_ascension> Idril-- people can and do get the exp from other guilds
<Vestrial_Legends> my point is that they DO have a means of getting in the planes without PEs
<Syd-LoD> plane not guild
<Shylara_LB> But Cymric, that hurts members in big guilds, if I have 2 30 people raids, all my people cannot go anyway, they should at least have this chance

<Syd-LoD> nyne_TP: ok, change it from 20 randoms to 15 lod, would that be a PE because 20 random people are the majority?
*** Value of INSERT_MODE set to ON
<Cymric> idril: It's not our place to decide if they fail or not, if they do enough PE raids (as they're allowed), they'll turn veteran just like guilds have had to hammer out.
<Arenoth_Patronas> but the PEs are for unguilded people
<Syd-LoD> or would that be considered lod exploiting the rules to gain more planes time?
<Goad_Unbroken> having 12 unguilded players required for a PE still allows for some experienced guilded people help plan the raid
<Morpherios_FoH> Personally I don't forsee, unless there is someone who is going to *volunteer* to spend most or *all* of their EQ time policing each plane, a way to avoid major major abuse of the PE setup
<Urky_Iceni> still lod, ie > 6
<Tut|Panth> Syd - no, you have 7+ LOD people, it's an LOD booking
<nyne_TP> syd: it's not based on majority.  anything over 6 people on an event is a booking for that guild
<Bal_Forsaken> I think regardless of what we choose.. someone is going to try and exploit it.. why we need to continue to update these rules..  I say we give the current proposal a try
<Jorom:#tp> oh wow what was that I saw about disallowing people that have bookings to participate in PE
<Syd-LoD> oh
<Banadel_DotP> Syd: no that would be a scheduled LoD event
<Syd-LoD> ok
<Syd-LoD> I misunderstood that
<Syd-LoD> I thought 6 was just a number pulled for an example
<Idril_Patronas> It wont work like that Cymric -- after a few bad experiences people just wont make PE's anymore
<Jarik:#tp> Something to shut up the whiners who insist that they could find a way around it.
<Tut|Panth> The system will ALWAYS be exploitable, we can't prevent that. HOWEVER most people want to play nice and work with the system. We can't concern ourselves with every loophole some assnugget can use.
<Jarik:#tp> It's irrelevant, considering PEs won't happen, anyawy.
<Havlok_Amici> for gods sakes.. at the end of this year hopefully.. 2 more planes will be added to our "roster of planes"... will we have to go through all this.. so far.. 2 and a half hours...  and only be on point 2... all over again?
<nyne_TP> you can't disallow people from public events whose guilds have bookings because it negates the 6 man rule

<nyne_TP> this is the rule as it stands for PEs
<nyne_TP> Public events can be scheduled on the calendar.  They must include a link to
<nyne_TP> a roster of expected attendees.  The roster should attempt to list 80% of
<nyne_TP> the expected attendees.  If more than 6 people from the same guild are

<trelani_Forsaken> i have to agree retro active is not a good idea

<Irrani_Storm_> yup
<Urky_Iceni> wont see any PEs till december then ;)
<Cymric> ok.. let's move on!
<nyne_TP> let's agree that these rules apply to all bookings one week after it's posted, no?
<Amazar_ascension> LOL Urky
<Cymric> - A guild may not "ally" itself with another guild during 2 runs, and still book runs outside of that. i.e. If you wish to book multiple guild runs (i.e. Alliance), then you do it as Avanguardia/BH/Kogerne does it, or you just go on an FFA and not reserve it. 
<Idril_Patronas> Remember how some people reacted to the first rules when they came out, we need to be sure what we produce is not incidiary.  Cant be retroactive
<trelani_Forsaken> or november week days 
<nyne_TP> and all bookings before that are grandfathered
<nyne_TP> cymric: that's covered, skip it
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I agree with the rule, but I think it needs to be reworded
<Amazar_ascension> This is covered by the 6 person rule, yes?
<Tut|Panth> I think Six Man RUle takes care of that
<Jarik:#tp> What's this rule for?  Doesn't 6 man cover it?
<Havlok_Amici> I think that point was pretty much covered in the 6 man rule

<Urky_Iceni> is to me
<Jorom:#tp> good one nyne

<Vestrial_Legends> a three guild alliance can get 6 bookings for the same 18 people
<Banadel_DotP> no
<Jarik:#tp> Vestrial needs to learn basic math.,
<Havlok_Amici> I give this another hour and 15 mins before I take a vote amoung amici reps and amici in private chat and we leave this to all the uber powers to decide our fate
<Cymric> When scheduling a planes raid, if you are planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild as guests, that guild must also be listed on the booking and it also counts as a booking for that guild.  
<trelani_Forsaken> under 6 is not a guild booking   more than 6 is  and u can't book back to back and can't book more than 2
<Arenoth_Patronas> you cant be in more than one booking as  PE person
* Tut|Panth laughs at Havlok
<Vestrial_Legends> were not talking PE now, were talking alliance

<nyne_TP> 6 man rule is all bookings
<Havlok_Amici> laugh all you wish.. I am serious.. this is insane.... I could be either in Bed or in FEAR now!
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Suggested rewording: Two or more guilds may "ally" themselves with other guilds to book a planes raid but all guilds in the alliance must use one of their bookings when doing so.

<Irrani_Storm_> no reason to even have this rule..its already covered by 6 man rule
<Idril_Patronas> Agree with Nyne
<Arenoth_Patronas> this is what the 6 man rule was for
<Cymric> Havlok: this is important for your representation to be here, but if you must go, there's quite a number of guilds which forewent any participation today.

<Jorom:#tp> I would have to agree with him...this does seem like a game
<Urky_Iceni> the topic is slain :)
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Leave it.  It further clarifies the 6 man rule.  
* Amazar_ascension begins to cast a spell
<Vestrial_Legends> 3 groups have 6 planar members each, that means 6 bookings for them
<nyne_TP> no, it doesn't
<Tut|Panth> I think it confuses the 6 man rule
<nyne_TP> it's contradictory

<Vestrial_Legends> planar? severa
<Jarik:#tp> #inno - They can't be on the calendar at the same time.  If they want to do that, 3 months apart, let 'em.
<Shylara_LB> NE?
<nyne_TP> someone paste the 6 man rule
<Vestrial_Legends> it was 'More then six' was it not?
<Cymric> When scheduling a planes raid, if you are planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild as guests, that guild must also be listed on the booking and it also counts as a booking for that guild.  
<Goad_Unbroken> perhaps we should lower the 6 man rule to 5
<Vestrial_Legends> 'more then six'

<nyne_TP:#tp> thought it was a he
<Jorom:#tp> he she, hell I don't know it
<Tut|Panth> I said 5 originally with that intent, Goad, but people wanted 6. I'm not about to fight over a person. =)
<Jarik:#tp> he/she/it, nfc
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> We agreed on more than 6 long ago
<Idril_Patronas> I disagree strongly on lowering it
<Vestrial_Legends> which was my argument against PEs
<Perdy_OOTW> Vest it works both ways, you can take 6 from yours and 6 from your friends guild's and still not be booked as Legends
<Jorom:#tp> ok is it
<nyne_TP> perdy: exactly
<Idril_Patronas> 6 people is the size of a group in EQ, and the size of a group you port into hate
<Vestrial_Legends> thats my point
<Irrani_Storm_> exaclty..sigh..but vest..people didn't see it..
<Shylara_LB> I will vote again less than 6+ One group is fair
<Jorom:#tp> Vestrial is now officially an IT
<Perdy_OOTW> All this does is allows the smaller guilds to step up and have a shot at the planes as well.
<nyne_TP> yes, you can get 15 6 person groups and it'll count as one booking

<nyne_TP> the line has to be draw somewhere
<Tut|Panth> agreed, perdy
<nyne_TP> you can't have it both ways
*** Signoff: Macmorn (Macmorn)
<Irrani_Storm_> no it doesn't nyne..count it as a pe
<Vestrial_Legends> it always smaller guilds to go more often is my point
<Tut|Panth> right, nyne
<Jarik:#tp> Practically speaking - No one would do that, because it would end in mass CR, and loot arguments, anyway.
<nyne_TP> well
*** Signoff: Seani (Signed off)
<Vestrial_Legends> allows even
<Jorom:#tp> yup
<Perdy_OOTW> Does Legends have any Alliances?
<Irrani_Storm_> because no guild has 7 members..it doesn't have to count on any guilds bookings
<Shylara_LB> So we add a minimum percentage of the booking group
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> If smaller guilds go they bring others too and that means friends from uber guilds 
<Tut|Panth> Minimum percentage is also contradictory to the 6 man rule
<Shylara_LB> How so?
*** Signoff: Vorx-Justifiers (Vorx-Justifiers)
<Irrani_Storm_> but..i can come up with how many 6 person groups from my guild, and how many 6 person groups from friends guilds..and we can create how may PE's before we run out?....its a lot
<nyne_TP> well, the possiblity is requiring people to convert it to a PE at some point
<Tut|Panth> In practice the 6 man rule is fine, I would think. Otherwise you'll end up with CR and loot fights.
<Idril_Patronas> As a point of fact if a guild tried to do this regularly they would get found out in short order and toasted on the message boards quickly
<Havlok_Amici> oh god.. are we going back a topic now?
<nyne_TP> idril: yeah
*** vorx_justifiers (~java@cb43769-b.mdsn1.wi.home.com) has joined channel #innoruuk
<nyne_TP> I don't think it's an issue
<Tut|Panth> Havlok: you wanted this over with or something? =)
<Jorom:#tp> I have to say though, some are taking a lot of the non-guilded for granted.  They are expecting that non-guilded people can't and won't want to do planes because they can't possibly survive it and do good.  I have seen some non-guilded people that are twice the gamers than guilded
<Idril_Patronas> It could happen but not something to worry overly about
<Tut|Panth> I don't either. Can we please just drop this? =)
<Cymric> Ok.. so we move to next? ;)
<nyne_TP:#tp> jor: in practice it's a non issue
<Amazar_ascension> I say drop it
<Havlok_Amici> oh no.. no rush at all.. I don't have a life outside of EQ...
<Bal_Forsaken> the point is it's up to the honor system for all of us not to exploit it...  We all know we can, but choose not to
*vorx_justifiers* can you bless me, i was stupid and changed the innoruuk page lol
<Banadel_DotP> seems like we are discussing the same thing over and over
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> please do
<Jarik:#tp> Jor, yes, lots of people are doing it.
<Cymric> OK OK OK quiet then.
<Arenoth_Patronas> if we see it we can deal with it, we cant make rules that prevent all abuses.  We would need a book to write it all.

*vorx_justifiers* ty
<Jarik:#tp> The chances of people in this game, remaining unguilded that long, are slim to none, imo, but we don't want to exclude the very possibility.
<Havlok_Amici> make it a big thick book... so I can knock myself out for sleep
<Cymric> Next suggested proposal:  Amend Rule 1 to be "A guild may only have *1* event booked at any given time. This meaning that a second event cannot be booked until the first of it's events have begun."
<Tut|Panth>#tp> agreed
<Jorom:#tp> oh I totally agree
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I think we should approve the rule.  We all basically agree with it and it does further clarify the 6 man rule.
<Urky_Iceni> erk
<Idril_Patronas> Disagree
<nyne_TP:#tp> do we want one outstanding booking?
<Havlok_Amici> disagree
<Shylara_LB> disagree
<Vestrial_Legends> disagree
<Jarik:#tp> Yes
<nyne_TP> agree
<Idril_Patronas> 1 weekend, 1 weeknight perhaps
<Arenoth_Patronas> that will not happen
<Perdy_OOTW> If you start seeing planar events with guilds having 6, 6, and 6, they are obviously abusing the rules.
<Banadel_DotP> has to be 2 bookings for the 6 man rule to work
<Jarik:#tp> We're going to be using 1 plane 1 trak from now one, prolly.
<Amazar_ascension> disagree
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> I will vote aye for one weekday and one weekend
<Arenoth_Patronas> Try modifying it to 1 weekday and one weekend
<Jorom:#tp> not saying anything regarding the rules..it just seems that the general idea is "If you aren't in a guild, you must suck"  that is just the feeling I am getting from a lot in this channel
<Idril_Patronas> agreed with Banadel -- this 6 man rule will not work w/ 1 booking
<nyne_TP:#tp> why do you want one plane booking?
<Vestrial_Legends> I will 
<Perdy_OOTW> disagree
<Havlok_Amici> aye.. one weekend and one weekend sounds sweet to me
<Amazar_ascension> I would agree with a 1/1 
<Jarik:#tp> Clear up some of the crap no the calendar.
<Cymric> well, just vote for this issue, we'll get to weekend bookings soon, plz people, stay on subject =)
<Shylara_LB> I would be fine with one weekday and one weekend too
<vorx_justifiers> aye, i disagree, agree to 1 week day 1 week end change
<Havlok_Amici> er.. weekend and weekday
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Agree with 1/1
<nyne_TP:#tp> it doesn't make much difference really
<Jarik:#tp> 2-3 months ahead of time is a bit much.

<Cymric> 	- Amend Rule 2 to be "No back-to-back BOOKED plane raids. eg: Fear on Mon. and Hate on Tues. is unacceptable....Fear on mon. and Hate on wed. is fine. (see FFA section for more info)." to also include only being able to schedule 1 weekend day per every 2 times scheduled.

<Tut|Panth> Thank God!
<Gallenite|Pantheon> lucy: havlok++
<Arenoth_Patronas> i agree with Aerion, it should be in rule one
<Bodil-ashen> !
<Shylara_LB> I agree with Aerion and I would like to see it worded one weekend on the books at a time, rather than alternating bookings
<Jorom:#tp> curious..are they counting sunday as weekend or friday and saturday ?
<Idril_Patronas> Dont use "holy" and "Abashi" in the same sentance please
<nyne_TP:#tp> good point
<Amazar_ascension> LOL Idril
<nyne_TP> question
<Goad_Unbroken> haha these are emendments we all can see that will free up more bookings
<Jarik:#tp> OH GOD
<Jarik:#tp> Last time
<nyne_TP> which days are weekends?
<Havlok_Amici> well.. hows about holy as in someone pumped him full of lead
<Cymric> Ok, someone please revise the wording then, and to which rule it "amends". then we'll vote again.
<Tut|Panth> That's what I'm wondering
<Jarik:#tp> The definition of "Weekend" was a 2 hour topic.
<vorx_justifiers> fri-sun
<Banadel_DotP> friday saturday and sunday
<Idril_Patronas> Friday night, Saturday, Sunday
<Jorom:#tp> hehe
<Tut|Panth> FOr where?
<Jorom:#tp> well, personally I think it should be friday and saturday
<Irrani_Storm_> good point
<Perdy_OOTW> Hrmm thought weekends were Sat and Sun
<Sandory_Aegis> friday sat and sun
<Cymric> Amend this rule: . A guild may only have TWO events booked at any given time...this meaning that a third event cannot be booked until the first of it's two events has begun.
<Jarik:#tp> I'm totally waiting for the time zone thing to hit again.
<Cymric> ?
<Idril_Patronas> It has to be north america, 90% of the server are in our time zones
<Tut|Panth> In what time zone? =)
<Morpherios_FoH> It's going to have to be Friday Saturday Sunday.... because people book on friday planning on using the weekend
<Urky_Iceni> weekend is when i finish work friday :)
<Jarik:#tp> I hate you.
<Jorom:#tp> those are the given days that people can stay up late because no work/school the next day
* Jarik:#tp points tuttle
<nyne_TP> PST
<Havlok_Amici> weekends are sat and sunday..  er... oh hell.. timezones....
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Proposed rewording...  Rule 1: A guild may only have *2* events booked at any given time but only one booking can be on a weekend date. This meaning that a third event cannot be booked until the first of it's 2 events have begun.
<Banadel_DotP> my time zone of course ;-)
<Gallenite|Pantheon> PST makes the most sense - That's where the servers live.
<vorx_justifiers> aye, i would vote east time zone, which is not my time zone
<nyne_TP> yeap
<Idril_Patronas> I like Aerion's language
<nyne_TP> pst, that's where verant is
<Tut|Panth> Agreed, G
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> agree aerion
<Goad_Unbroken> agrees with Aerions wording
<Shylara_LB> Rule 1 Each guild is allowed to have one weekday and one weekend day (Sat & Sun) reserved at any given time.
<nyne_TP> it's the only neutral time
<Tut|Panth> Disagree with Aerion
<Bal_Forsaken> agree Aerion
<Havlok_Amici> ok... everyone who plays eq must live in one time zone.. so everyone... move to mars

<Tut|Panth> Oh, I see what you mean, two weekends on different weeks

<Tut|Panth> Sorry, I was thinking back to back bookings on the same weekend which was just silly. =)
<Tut|Panth> Agreed, Idril
<Goad_Unbroken> i believe Friday is included in a weekend booking because players can stay up all night on fridays
*** Mode change "+v Urky2_Iceni" on channel #innoruuk by Cymric
<Perdy_OOTW> According to what timezone? Shall we do GMT 0?
<Morpherios_FoH> Those who book on a friday are expecting to base it on that they'll have the freetime on a weekend to put the raid together
<nyne_TP> what idril said
<Idril_Patronas> PST
<Tut|Panth> PST
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> Friday - Sunday : Weekend
<Perdy_OOTW> i.e. Thursday is Friday (for example) in Taiwan
<Cymric> reword amendment to include defining weekend days?
<Idril_Patronas> 80-90% of the server is in north america, trying to use GMT only causes problems
<nyne_TP:#tp> we can hope his head will explode
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Friday counts as a weekend because people can stay up much later than normal
<Jarik:#tp> lol
<Havlok_Amici> might as well use PST.. verant does for some odd reason
<Tut|Panth> agreed, Aerion
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> so it is friday - sunday pst

<Arenoth_Patronas> ok, so can we agree on what is a weekend and address Aerion's proposal?
<Tut|Panth> Agreed, G

<Tut|Panth> correct, Cym
<Urky_Iceni> thats 3am my time

<Urky_Iceni> yep

<Jorom:#tp> if your raid is schedule to BEGIN on friday, it is a weekend, if your raid happens to end on friday it is not a weekend
<Perdy_OOTW> Agreed Aer
<Idril_Patronas> I know, but we cant fix the time zone problem with any language.  The majority of players are in N America 
* Gallenite|Pantheon recalls a world terrorized by Garren's ability to convert JST to PST to GMT.

<Bal_Forsaken> agreed
<Urky_Iceni> not even sure why PST is in there
<Urky_Iceni> but.. whatever
<Amazar_ascension> I like it :)
<Idril_Patronas> It's Verant's time zone
<nyne_TP> because  you have to define a given timezone
<Vestrial_Legends> if you put your resevation in the 'friday' box its a weekend raid, simple ;)
<Tut|Panth> Yah
<Idril_Patronas> and we have to have some time zone
<nyne_TP> otherwise it's meaningless
<Morpherios_FoH> Because it's what Verant bases their time off of, and it's where a large number of players are from
<Winleth_EON> Agreed
<Tut|Panth> Agreed
<nyne_TP> and PST is better than anything else
<Cymric> OK OK OK Plz some quiet. =)
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> *Wonders if the Shadow Stalkers will forget her while she sits here*
<Idril_Patronas>  and prob 50 players on the server are on GMT
<Urky_Iceni> bah
<Goad_Unbroken> yes California Rulz!
<Cymric> Ok.. voting on proposed amendment: Rule 1: A guild may only have *2* events booked at any given time but only one booking can be on a weekend date.

<nyne_TP> arenoth: good point
<Irrani_Storm_> Rewording : Nobody rather than guild

<Shylara_LB> I agree with no one shall...
<Winleth_EON> Agreed
<nyne_TP> s/No guild/noone/
<Idril_Patronas> No player
<Havlok_Amici> <-- ponders bribing ppl with free clarity just to get em to agree
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> good point arenoth
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> No guild or PERSON should enter the...
<Tut|Panth> good point, Irrani
<Arenoth_Patronas> no player
<Gallenite|Pantheon> Arenoth  - We can't dictate what the unrepresented do.  We can only bind those agreeing to the terms.
<Urky_Iceni> sounds good
<Jorom:#tp> Just curious...was/are there any rules regulating if a guild/party cancels their plane raid at the last minute?
<nyne_TP:#tp> it's ffa then
* Sandory_Aegis reminds Havlok she's a warrior... but nice try :)
<Cymric> No guild/person/group shall enter a plane without permission of the scheduled guild currently in the plane during their scheduled time.
<Arenoth_Patronas> we cant bind guilds not here either, but that does not mean they have to know that
<Morpherios_FoH> That works
<Bal_Forsaken> agreed
<Irrani_Storm_> aggreed..
<Tut|Panth> That's good
<nyne_TP> gallenite: no, but we can hope that they abide by the rules
<Idril_Patronas> it is no more biding than any other part of the summit, but it explicitly states what is bad
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I agree with that one, Cymric
<Vestrial_Legends> agree
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> agree
<Goad_Unbroken> agree
<Tallis|Iceni> bascially.. we form the majority of planes goers on the server, people will go with the flow with what we do
<Trelani_Forsaken> agreed
<Amazar_ascension> That is fine
<vorx_justifiers> agree
<Perdy_OOTW> This is hard to enforce though, especially if person A is coming in to get there corpse because the guild in the planes isn't willing to help (playing devils advocate)
<Perdy_OOTW> But I agree
<Sandory_Aegis> agree
<Havlok_Amici> Sandory... Augmentation in Kedge is nice :)
<nyne_TP:#tp> also, no guild implies that single persons may be allowed if the guidl isn't entering en mass
<Tallis|Iceni> we cant do anything about that
<Irrani_Storm_> but..they have to ask first perdy..thats the point
<Banadel_DotP> agreed
<Havlok_Amici> and yes.. Amici agree's.. its a touch down vote!!
<Cymric> Proposed amendment: No guild/person/group shall enter a plane without permission of the scheduled guild currently in the plane during their scheduled time.  Anyone disagree?
<Tallis|Iceni> we can set guidelines that we hope people will follow, if they dont... they dont
<Goad_Unbroken> people requesting CR will assk permission, and should wait for the "All Clear" go ahead, common sence
<Perdy_OOTW> Asking is one thing, but if the other guild say flat out no... which I'm sure has happened.
<Morpherios_FoH> We're basically going with the honor system on the entire summit, and we have enough of the good folks here to be able to in effect "police" the others without putting much effort into it. Ie, if someone does something in horrible violation, their consequence is that they'll have a bad rep for it
<Morpherios_FoH> Agreed
<Havlok_Amici> agree... yes... oui... yuppers... we like
<Idril_Patronas> agreed
<Perdy_OOTW> Agreed Morph
<Irrani_Storm_> then you're not allowed in..same as it is now perdy
<Gallenite|Pantheon> Well said, Morph.
<Sandory_Aegis> aye Goad
<Irrani_Storm_> this isnt' adding anything new..just spelling out whats already done
<Tut|Panth> we have ny disagreements with the proposed Amendment?
<Jorom:#tp> ok, say Pantheon schedules a plane run for friday...when friday rolls around, there aren't enough people to do it "in guild" so we want to bring in SJ to fill the slots..SJ already has 2 bookings on the calander?
<Shylara_LB> I'd like to add a quick addition to the agenda.  I think discussions of violations of the Summit should be in a specific place, either Innoruuk.com in one forum or the flame, er EQVault
<Havlok_Amici> plus... Vest knows I'll flame anyone who does me wrong...
* Amazar_ascension did not hear any
<nyne_TP:#tp> SJ goes, doesn't matter
<Irrani_Storm_> next issue
<Tut|Panth> shy - not necessary. It'll happen anyway. =)
<Jorom:#tp> then you would break the 6 man rule
<Cymric> That is very true with what Morpherios has said.. this is unenforcable and totally based on honor and respect. Verant does not back this, only backs PNP, we only use this as a guild on how guilds and others should honorably treat each other.
<nyne_TP:#tp> this only applies to bookings and people are expected to attempt to comply with their bookings
<Jarik:#tp> If we withdraw, it's ffa.  If we round out with their members, over 6 of them, it's against 6 man
<Vestrial_Legends> we should decide where to do it though Tut
<nyne_TP:#tp> no, 6 man rule applies at booking time
<Goad_Unbroken> aye Shy a forum for violations is a good idea, ad a good deterent to breaking the rules
<Jarik:#tp> Hm.
<Tut|Panth> EQVault, same place as we always do. =)
<nyne_TP:#tp> all of this only applies to scheduling and you're expected to attempt to comply with your scheduling
<Tallis|Iceni> exactly.. we set guidelines here what we agree to. it is pointless to discuss what other people will do to get around it
<Jorom:#tp> agree nyne..but a lot of times booking especially this far in advance gets totally screwed when the time comes
<Jarik:#tp> Fair enough.
<Irrani_Storm_> we're close to the end of this..i can feel it :)
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> more items on the agenda?
<nyne_TP:#tp> yeap, that's why it only applies at booking time
<Cymric> Shylara: I created Local - Guilds form on innoruuk.com for pretty much the sole purpose of inter-guild matters, including summit violations.
<Havlok_Amici> blah.. I'll flame on my mailing lists.. I'm sure someone will be more than happy to pass them onto others
<Jorom:#tp> I see
<Morpherios_FoH> I agree wholeheartedly that the honorable on this server far outweigh those that are less than... Verant does not agree with any type of scheduling whatsoever, It's up to us to enforce, but we do that by just being good citizens to our community, a little common sense goes a long way, and I have faith in positive karma.
<nyne_TP:#tp> actually
<nyne_TP:#tp> the reason it applies at booking time is simple
<Vestrial_Legends> lol hav
<nyne_TP:#tp> we usually don't know what people do
<Tut|Panth> lucy: morpherios++
<Goad_Unbroken> Here here Morph!
<nyne_TP:#tp> we just know what they booked
<Gallenite|Pantheon> Tuttle beat me.
<Sandory_Aegis> aye Morph :)
<Jorom:#tp> I know its an honor thing but was jsut curious if people would throw a total fit if at schedule time, we didn't have enough, so we brought in 10 from SJ
* Tut|Panth grins
* Morpherios_FoH hands his soap box back to Cymric
<nyne_TP:#tp> they're on the honor system and very infrequent spot checks to comply with it
<Cymric> OK OK OK.. next subject...
<Cymric> Interesting idea to add to the agenda, have a couple days a month scheduled as FFA so people can see how fun it would be without the Summit :)
<Havlok_Amici> beat you?  isn't  that a violation of the rules for us in this chat?
<nyne_TP:#tp> jor: only if we made a habit of it imo
* Tut|Panth laughs
<Cymric> i.e. scheduled FFA days that no one can book on top of ?
<Morpherios_FoH> That is an interesting idea
<Irrani_Storm_> would just create a race wouldn't it?
<Banadel_DotP> I disagree
<nyne_TP> no preset FFA days
<Urky_Iceni> been covered, no dice
<Arenoth_Patronas> heheh, it is funny, but i dont think we need to do that
<Tut|Panth> Yes, it'll probably cause tension
<Gallenite|Pantheon> No need.  It's a waste of 'valuable' slots, and it's just going to end in races won by the fastest/largest who care to try
<Shylara_LB> I still like maybe one of these a month
* Tut|Panth nods G
<Arenoth_Patronas> with weekday bookings it would just waste a day
<Cymric> Last Wednesday of every month? ;)
<Tut|Panth> I disagree with the proposed FFA days
<Idril_Patronas> disagree
<Penguin> those days will give Local-Guilds some hard work to do cym
<nyne_TP> nod, if we want that slot, we'll just walk in with 12 people and break it
<Buffed_Ashen> nay
<Morpherios_FoH> Aye if they want an FFA day they can schedule one methinks
<Vestrial_Legends> disagree
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> disagree
<Idril_Patronas> waste of slots, small guilds will never get them
<Jorom:#tp> agreed nyne
<Bodil-ashen> buffed speaks!
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I think we should try one or two unofficially and see how they work out
<Havlok_Amici> would be a race to see who gets there first... and I know that wouldn't be Amici.. not that we care.. we're too busy making faces in private
<Irrani_Storm_> disaggre..
<Jorom:#tp> I have a bad habit of seeing stupid stuff like that and wondering =)
<Cymric> ok.. sounds like this one should be trashed.. ;)
<Morpherios_FoH> Otherwise I bet I could guess which day/time that the planes were going to be havoc
<Trelani_Forsaken> by being ffa  there would be no race becus everyone could enter
<Tut|Panth> Burn it and get the next one. =)
<Havlok_Amici> <-- hands Cymric the Recycle bin
<Trelani_Forsaken> no first 18 there   just everyone
<Goad_Unbroken> if its just to show how valuable the Summit is, then i would suggest the FFA prescheduled only be put on weekdays
<Urky_Iceni> CR! As Anne said :)
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> it is dead
<Idril_Patronas> first raid to have 18 would get the Plane
<Irrani_Storm_> wrong trelani, once you take control, then its yours..fFA rules
<nyne_TP> oh, you mean true ffa, not first come first serve?
<Morpherios_FoH> Ya but that means that nobody really sees how good the planes can be, it's going to turn into what it is on other servers
<Tut|Panth> OMG
<Cymric> OK OK Quiet Please!
<Tut|Panth> That'd be horrible
<nyne_TP> a true ffa day would be incredibly bad
<Morpherios_FoH> aye
<Banadel_DotP> extremely
<Bodil-ashen> would be a day to flame on eq vault )
<nyne_TP> it'd be "who's doing CR for them this week?"
<Gallenite|Pantheon> All loot goes to the wizzie with the best spell timing?  Hm.  Pass thanks.
<Idril_Patronas> would be a source of amusement though
<Cymric> it's been decided pre-set ffa days promotes chaos.
<Havlok_Amici> unless yer a cleric charging for res fee's
<Sandory_Aegis> lol
<Havlok_Amici> damn.. I shoulda been a cleirc
<Morpherios_FoH> I like that wording, promotes chaos... I have to use that
<Tut|Panth> Yah, let's move on
<Urky_Iceni> next!
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> agree Cym
<Cymric> OK OK Quiet Please!
* Tut|Panth polishes his kick button. =)
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> NEXT !!!
<Jarik:#tp> <havlok_amici> I vote I get kicked first!!!   (/msg)
<Jorom:#tp> there goes tuttle, flexing his virtual muscle again =)
<Tut|Panth>#tp> LOL
<Cymric> OMG.. we're out of agenda items!!! So ummm.. before this turns into chaos, does anyone here with voice have a proposed amendment. And plz, one at a time, raise your hand, and I will recognize the speaker. Once recognized, speak your proposed amendment, I'll add it to a list, then proceed to next proposer.. once that's done, we'll bring them up for discussion.
<nyne_TP> no, we have another
<nyne_TP> to reduce the slot from 16 to 12 hours
<Irrani_Storm_> aye
<nyne_TP> it was brought up earlier
<Cymric> ok.. that's added.
<Tut|Panth> right
<nyne_TP> personally, I want it reduced to 5 hours
<Cymric> any others?
* Tut|Panth laughs
<Vestrial_Legends> lol nyne
<nyne_TP> but I doubt anyone will agree with that =)
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I have one
<Gallenite|Pantheon> Hard to change slot time to less than respawn time, else the second booker takes it square in the shorts.
<vorx_justifiers> the agreement that all future planes go by these rules unless a summit decides otherwise?
<Morpherios_FoH> I disagree, certain zone pops are on an 8 hour basis, 16 hours makes a lot of sense
<Tut|Panth> same, G
<Cymric> wait wait
<Tut|Panth> Right
<nyne_TP> respawn time is 12 hours aafaik
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I have a agenda item
<Cymric> shhh dont talk about the times yet plz
<Cymric> shhh dont talk about the times yet plz
<nyne_TP> for fear
<Cymric> shhh dont talk about the times yet plz
<Tut|Panth> Shaddap! We're just getting new items
<nyne_TP> and considerably less for hate
<Cymric> shhh dont talk about the times yet plz
<Urky_Iceni> 8
<Jarik:#tp> Nyne - Some patrols spawn at 12, but mass respawn is 16 iirc
<nyne_TP> vorx: sky is still not by these rules
<Cymric> Ok what were the other proposed items (outside of changing the time slots) ?
* Amazar_ascension thinks Cymric wants to find out if people have OTHER items :)
<Tut|Panth>#tp> My god, is this almost over?
* Cymric slaps Amazar_ascension around a bit with a large trout
<Urky_Iceni> when these take effect, or was that covered?
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I think a rule should be instated to reuqire a guild to have at LEAST one planes capable person to book a day
<Jorom:#tp> sky is not on these rules cause no one ever wants to do sky..I hear it really sucks and just ain't worth it
<Amazar_ascension> ouch
<Idril_Patronas> aye, when the rules go into effect
<nyne_TP:#tp> we can at least change the times for hate though
<Havlok_Amici> ok.. kick him.. thats the second trout he's pulled.. and its not even clean
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I think a rule should be instated to require a guild to have at LEAST one planes capable person to book a day
<Jarik:#tp> We thought of that teh first time, but most didn't like the idea of 2 different times.  Can easily downgrade hate to 12 though.
<Cymric> Vorx added something about when these changes take effect, and if it is retroactive, etc. That will be added.
<Shylara_LB> We should also vote on when these rules take effect
<Idril_Patronas> And where booking/guild discussions take place
<Tut|Panth> add aerion's item
<nyne_TP> aerion: is that really a problem?
<Tut|Panth> no, but it'll be over with fast. =)
<Havlok_Amici> funny.. I thought Aerions idea was already in effect.. Amici never spoke up on planes till a couple of us were ready
<Bal_Forsaken> Idon't think thats really an issue
<Jarik:#tp> Actually, I like that idea.  Guild must have 12 planes capable to book.
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Well, it's logical and might prevent some abuse
<Havlok_Amici> if not in written rules... then in common sense..
<Arenoth_Patronas> I would not bother with it
<Arenoth_Patronas> how is 1 person different than none?
<nyne_TP:#tp> they'll just schedule as a PE
<Havlok_Amici> I mean.. Bixie Slayers United haven't booked Hate yet have they?
<Tut|Panth>#tp> yah
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> It certainly makes no sense to book a date if you have no one, but there is nothing stopping anyone.
<Bodil-ashen> should be 18 if your booking alone imo
<Morpherios_FoH> 10 times at last count
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed Arenoth
<Morpherios_FoH> With 15 more this week ; )
<Shylara_LB> I agree, there should be a minimum number
<Cymric> Ok added to agenda
<Trelani_Forsaken> the minimum number is 6
<Urky_Iceni> PE rules count here at a guess
<nyne_TP> well, anyone without the min, will just schedule as a PE
<Irrani_Storm_> lol..yes..the 6+ rule fixes this problem
<Tut|Panth> We're not discussing the items, just getting them
<Idril_Patronas> 6+ rule is what we decided
<Tut|Panth> Any more?
<Cymric> any more items?
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> But the 6 man rule DOES NOT apply to this
<Shylara_LB> So we got 4 additions?
<Cymric> yep, 4 additions for discussion.
<nyne_TP> aerion: no, it doesn't
<Tut|Panth> Cym: can you cover addendum?
<nyne_TP> cymric: add something about discussing when this goes into effect
<Jorom:#tp> hmm 4 additions, this is going to go oin for another 3 hours
<Havlok_Amici> ugh... ok... lets cover these 4 quickly... PLS..
<nyne_TP:#tp> I have nothing better to do
<Tut|Panth> right, we should talk about grandfathering
<Jorom:#tp> I'm at work so me either really
<Cymric> Changing reservation times from 16hr  to 12hr
<Cymric> [16:07] <Aerion_LoreKeepers> I think a rule should be instated to reuqire a guild to have at LEAST one planes capable person to book a day there should be a minimum number
<Cymric> [16:08] <Idril_Patronas> And where booking/guild discussions take place
<Cymric> [16:08] <Shylara_LB> We should also vote on when these rules take effect
<Havlok_Amici> yea.. and add something about not having another of these till I'm old and grey... me personally.. not Havlok
<Tut|Panth> Cool

<Jorom:#tp> wish I was at home, I would be leveling myself up
<Tut|Panth> Anything else?
<Jorom:#tp> or at least trying
<Cymric> that's it.
<Tut|Panth> Sweet, let's kill these fast. =)
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> please
<Cymric> I'm all for it. =)
<nyne_TP> let's change hate from 16 to 12, leave fear alone
<Idril_Patronas> disagree
<nyne_TP> why?
<Tut|Panth> Agreed, Nyne
<Arenoth_Patronas> disagree
<Tallis|Iceni> slots should be 16 hours to account for the differing time zones of each guild, rather than the time it takes to clear it
<Cymric> First topic, as nyne started: Changing reservation times from 16hr  to 12hr
<Urky_Iceni> yep, 16 is respawns in hate
<Idril_Patronas> small guilds take longer to clear, with 12 hours they never get a shot at Innoruuk
*** Guest22323 (~java@lsanca1-ar7-161-022.dsl.gtei.net) has joined channel #innoruuk
<nyne_TP> hate is 12 hours afaik
<Gallenite|Pantheon> Hate statics are 9, fear statics are 15 iirc.
<Gallenite|Pantheon> err 16
<Tut|Panth> right
<Tallis|Iceni> 16 hours has worked fine
<Idril_Patronas> 16 hours has worked, keep it
<nyne_TP> well, it'd allow for more slots
<Tut|Panth> let's say static respawn time
<Perdy_OOTW> 16 keep
<nyne_TP> that was the only reasoning
<Tut|Panth> so 9 hours for POH and 16 for POF
<Arenoth_Patronas> it took us 14 hours to clear all of hate, inny and maestro last time. Though 2 of that was finding bodies.  
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> keep 16 hours
<Morpherios_FoH> Yea changing of 16 would be just for the sake of changing it methinks
<nyne_TP> heh, ok
<Amazar_ascension> keep 16 for now
<Idril_Patronas> going with 12 effectively means guilds that clear slow never get a chance at gods
<Tut|Panth> Okay, guess that ones dead. Fair 'nuff
<Cymric> aight.. next topic?
<nyne_TP> yeah, doesn't matter to me really
<Havlok_Amici> yes... next pls :)
<Urky_Iceni> oki
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Next topic
<Cymric> [16:07] <Aerion_LoreKeepers> I think a rule should be instated to reuqire a guild to have at LEAST one planes capable person to book a day there should be a minimum number
<Tut|Panth> abstain, I don't see one difference one way or another
<Idril_Patronas> change to 6
<Vestrial_Legends> make it a meaningful number or its pointless
<Idril_Patronas> to match the rule
<Idril_Patronas> or dont put it in at all
<Arenoth_Patronas> 6 is at least meaningful
<nyne_TP> well, it'd be 7
<Shylara_LB> At least one?  6 maybe, otherwise they should be PE
<Vestrial_Legends> should be 7 then
<Havlok_Amici> don't think that matters really... shrug
<Tut|Panth> 7
<Cymric> Should we amend the new rule 6 to include this wording?
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> 6 I think
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Right now there is no rule that prevents a guild with no planes capable ppl in it from booking a date and letting another guild go in it's stead
<Shylara_LB> 7 is even better
<Idril_Patronas> 7 is fine
<Perdy_OOTW> 6 I think
<nyne_TP> should be 7 and suggest they schedule a PE, if we do it at all
* Tut|Panth nods nyne
* Gallenite|Pantheon nods Nyne
<Idril_Patronas> Agreed Nyne
<Arenoth_Patronas> 7 matches the other rule, so fair enough
<vorx_justifiers> sounds good nyne
<nyne_TP> that way we cover people with the rosters
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> oki 7 then
<Tut|Panth> agreed, Nyne
<Cymric> "The 6+ rule" : When scheduling a planes raid, if you are planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild as guests, that guild must also be listed on the booking and it also counts as a booking for that guild.  
<Urky_Iceni> sounds fair and consistent
<Shylara_LB> yes, 7 is good
<Irrani_Storm_> agreed
<Cymric> Any way we can reword that to include the guild must have at least 7 members. ?
<Tut|Panth> So change it to 7 and lets pass her. =)
<Tallis|Iceni> agreed
<Bal_Forsaken> agreed
<nyne_TP> yeah, we can
<Arenoth_Patronas> while you may not have 7 of your own members there because some cant come, you should at least in theory be able to do it
<nyne_TP> sec, let me writ eup something
<Winleth_EON> How can you know 2 months in advance who will be able to attend?
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> yea
<Urky_Iceni> related : need to prove you have 7+ to get a p/w to book?
<Idril_Patronas> wait
<Cymric> hehehe if you let 'em know 2 months ahead, they "should" be able to show up!
<nyne_TP> urky: can't prove anything =)
<Idril_Patronas> are we talking about need 7 to make a booking, or 7 at the event in order to go?
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> but U know if U got 7 46+ in the guild or not
<Urky_Iceni> i know, but can try :)
<Vestrial_Legends> to make a booking
<Irrani_Storm_> good point idril
<Idril_Patronas> are we talking about need 7 to make a booking, or 7 at the event in order to go?
<Cymric> I actually have probs scheduling short in advance, coz everyone will be busy working, or time with their gf, or therapist, etc
<Arenoth_Patronas> 7 to make a booking
<Gallenite|Pantheon> 7 in existence, in guild, to make a booking.
<Idril_Patronas> because it wont be long before 1 group can clear Hate
<Havlok_Amici> bloody hell I forced my self to Hate... I lost alot of sleep to get there... sorta like.. cough.. this thing... (to which I'm getting no exp or loot either.. course.. you all aint' asking me to pull inny)
<Arenoth_Patronas> easier that way
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Rule proposal...  Rule X: In order to book a date, a guild should have at least 6 planes capable people on its roster.
<Idril_Patronas> unless they buff it
<Gallenite|Pantheon> Independent of needing a roster. (a guild book wouldn't need a roster anyway)
<Arenoth_Patronas> at least 7
<nyne_TP> just addd something that says "If the scheduling guild does not have at least 7 planes capable members, it should be scheduled as a public event"
<Irrani_Storm_> 7
<Morpherios_FoH> Cymric: if they really cared about their GF, they'd buy them EQ ; )
<Goad_Unbroken> i think 6 is sufficient
* Tut|Panth nods nyne
<nyne_TP> 7 is symettric
<Idril_Patronas> 6 or 7, Im fine with either
<Tut|Panth> Agree with nyne's addendum
<Vestrial_Legends> 7, and 'must' have 
* Amazar_ascension agrees with Morph
<nyne_TP> better  yet
<Arenoth_Patronas> either works, 7 just fits with the other rule
<Havlok_Amici> ./em ponders how you could have a GF when yer all busy regulating "suggested rules" for a game :)
<Arenoth_Patronas> it might make people think we knew what we were doing
* Tut|Panth hands Hav /me
<Gallenite|Pantheon> lucy: havlok++
<nyne_TP> "If the scheduling guild does not have more than 6 planes capable members, it should be must as a public event"
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> hehe
<Cymric> Ok so instead of amending the "6+ rule", we add this rule: Rule X: In order to book a date, a guild should have at least 7 planes capable people on its roster.   Does anyone disagree?
<Shylara_LB> 7
<nyne_TP> Proposed: "If the scheduling guild does not have more than 6 planes capable members, it should be must as a public event"
<Vestrial_Legends> good Nyne
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> Agree
<Gallenite|Pantheon> should be must?
<Idril_Patronas> I like Cymric's language
<Irrani_Storm_> should = must
<Tut|Panth> cut him a break. =)
<Winleth_EON> Lucky 7 
<Arenoth_Patronas> cymric's works
<nyne_TP> yes, should = must
<Havlok_Amici> Amici nods.. its good... its a goal.. through the posts... extra point scored
<Tut|Panth> agreed, Cym/nyne
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Agree to adding Nyne words to my proposal
<nyne_TP> Proposed: "If the scheduling guild does not have more than 6 planes capable members, it must be scheduled as a public event"
<Perdy_OOTW> Disagree
*** Fraust (~java@nic-30-c4-236.mw.mediaone.net) has joined channel #innoruuk
<vorx_justifiers> agree nyne
<Bodil-ashen> I think it should be more then 7, thus, encouraging people to form alliances...sorry spelling
<Vestrial_Legends> why Perdy?
<Jarik:#tp> whotf is Perdy?
<Idril_Patronas> why Perdy?
<nyne_TP> cyrmic: add agenda item to change the term "Public Event"
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> agree nyne
<Urky_Iceni> more than 6 = 7 :)
<Banadel_DotP> agree nyne
<nyne_TP> it's not a good term
* Urky_Iceni coughs
* Tut|Panth nods nyne
* Amazar_ascension agrees
<Tut|Panth> that should be over with fast at least
<Perdy_OOTW> For the smaller guilds (our guild has enough), but there are MANY small guilds who rely on other smaller guilds. The PE would severly limit them
<Goad_Unbroken> more than 6 is in keeping with out numbers with the 6+ rule
<Tut|Panth>#tp> What am I saying, wording takes the longest. =)
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed Nyne, its not really appropriate
<nyne_TP> how does the PE limit them?
<Cymric> Proposed added rule: "If the scheduling guild does not have more than 6 planes capable members, it must be scheduled as a public event"  Anyone disagree?
<Vestrial_Legends> how? they can book two just like us
<nyne_TP> it's basically the same rules that guilds use, but requires a roster to prevent abuse
<Havlok_Amici> no no.. pls.. no old topics.. its dead... we beat that horse already
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Agree
<Perdy_OOTW> How many days are actually going to be PE?
<nyne_TP> perdy: as many as people want
<Idril_Patronas> agreed
<Gallenite|Pantheon> Perdy - All the rule says is that you have to have 7 46+ people in your guild to own a booking.  That's not the most stringent requirement in the world.
<Tut|Panth> agreed, Cym
<Goad_Unbroken> agrees with amendment
<Vestrial_Legends> they are scheduled Perdy, not preset
* Amazar_ascension wonders if he can slap people with the dead horse
<Arenoth_Patronas> I agree
<vorx_justifiers> agreed cym
<Urky_Iceni> agreed with amendment
<Havlok_Amici> agree on the 7 ppl who are 46+
<Vestrial_Legends> agree to 7+
*** Signoff: Fraust (Signed off)
<Perdy_OOTW> Ok, well then if there is no cap on PE then the smaller guilds will be happy
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> agree 
<Sandory_Aegis> agrees with amendment
<Tallis|Iceni> agrees
<Havlok_Amici> pls do Amazar.. start with Vest
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> One second please
<Bodil-ashen> 7 is VERY genorous
<Arenoth_Patronas> it will limit the guild to one event in effect
<Goad_Unbroken> this will help the Big guilds feel the calendar is not overly booked up with alliances
<Tiana:#tp> why are all these people in #inno?
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Someone has pointed out a valid argument that should be considered.
<nyne_TP> PE bookings are basically the same as guild bookings but with extras restrictions to prevent abuse
<Tut|Panth>#tp> summit
<Cymric> Aerion?
<Tiana:#tp> Ohhh
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Someone who does not have the MAgic Voice
* Amazar_ascension tries to slap Vest with the dead horse, but it is too heavy. (He is just a ranger after all)
<Cymric> who?
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Bayre 
*** Mode change "+v Bayre_OOTW" on channel #innoruuk by Cymric
<Cymric> Speak Bayre.
<Havlok_Amici> damn rangers.... useless..
*** Mode change "+o Tiana" on channel #innoruuk by ChanServ
<Bayre_OOTW> Thank you
<Tiana:#tp> hate being down at the bottom
<Bayre_OOTW> My point was regarding allied guilds
<Jarik:#tp> lol
<Bayre_OOTW> I was thinking that within allied guild politics, hypothetically speak, if I liked a particular guild, and I could book events(I have the magic 7+)
<Tut|Panth>#tp> Who's OOTW?
<Bayre_OOTW> I could exclusively invite whomever I wish from an alliance
<Tiana:#tp> order of the wolf
<Jarik:#tp> out of the woodwork.  
<Tiana:#tp> they suck
<Tiana:#tp> but I created the name
<Bayre_OOTW> Those with less than 7 members will never have a voice, and must rely on begging
<Tiana:#tp> so it's not too bad~
<Tiana:#tp> !
<Arenoth_Patronas> they can book PE
<Shylara_LB> they can do PEs
<Irrani_Storm_> PE
<Tut|Panth> PE
<Bayre_OOTW> very small guilds will never get a calendar shot unless they go to pe's
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Perhaps the number should be reduced to something closer to 1 or 2 members
<Irrani_Storm_> exactly
<nyne_TP> PE's aren't public events
<Bayre_OOTW> correct.. having heard the unlimited PE scheduling, that would be fair
<Tut|Panth> That's why PEs are there
<nyne_TP> they're like itemized bookings
<Arenoth_Patronas> all it means is that those guilds with less than 7, if they want to go, will get only 1 event rather than 2
<Havlok_Amici> very small guilds can make it to the planes underthe rules we're talking about... ala mine for instance
<nyne_TP> they're not public in any sense of the word
<Bayre_OOTW> but PE's are truely FFA no?
<nyne_TP> it's a bad term
<nyne_TP> bayre: not at all
<Tallis|Iceni> FFA is not PE
<nyne_TP> it's a bad term 
<Tiana:#tp> PE?
* Aerion_LoreKeepers Thinks we all have to remember that ALL of us are guilds with more than 6 ppl. WE ARE BIASED
<Bayre_OOTW> ahh very good.. FFA = open slot.. PE is PE.. gotcha.. that helps alot
<nyne_TP> public event = booking with a roster, that's all
<Idril_Patronas> PE is an event planned in advance which has no more than 6 members from any particular guild
<Irrani_Storm_> PE means you BOOK an event ahead of time with roster..
<Bayre_OOTW> I think there will never be FFA :P
<Tallis|Iceni> PEs are non guild, rostered events for anyone
<Havlok_Amici> I'm barely biased...  :)
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> PE = a ring of friends
<Jarik:#tp> reserved public event
<Morpherios_FoH> FFA = How other servers do it = bad juju
<Tiana:#tp> ahh
<Irrani_Storm_> ok..can we vote on it..
<Urky_Iceni> ring of friends = small guild
<Cymric> Non-Guilded Scheduled Events = PE, basically.
<Tiana:#tp> where's dumbasses of winter?
<Shylara_LB> Perhaps we should change the term PE to Rostered Event?
<Tut|Panth> It's an item
<Irrani_Storm_> sounds good
<vorx_justifiers> ding ding ding ding
<Tut|Panth> we'll cover it later
<Sandory_Aegis> that sounds good shy
<Tut|Panth> Let's close this one
<Goad_Unbroken> but small guilds are still guilded, 
<Havlok_Amici> wow.. he leveled in chat
<Perdy_OOTW> ... and you can't be in a public event more then twice at any given time correct?
<Jarik:#tp> lol
<Morpherios_FoH> lol
<Jarik:#tp> Havlok rocks.
<Irrani_Storm_> correct
<Morpherios_FoH> Least someone's getting exps here
<Arenoth_Patronas> yes perdy
<Perdy_OOTW> Ok that's fair
<Cymric> Shylara: I agree on that. =)
<Bayre_OOTW> Me happy
<Jarik:#tp> lucy: karma havlok?
<lucy:#tp> havlok has karma of 4
<Arenoth_Patronas> it sounds better
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> Shy: I agree
<Havlok_Amici> Your patience has gone up (2)
<Amazar_ascension> Shy--sounds good
<nyne_TP> shylara: sounds good for the name
<Bayre_OOTW> Ok Gag me Cymric :P
<Tiana:#tp> morphios_foh?
<Jorom:#tp> question: anyone know of something that might be better for exp than dorfs at level 40 for soloing as a druid or are those my best option?
<Tiana:#tp> who the hell's that?
<Idril_Patronas> I like Shylara's suggestion as well
<Tiana:#tp> OT
<Jarik:#tp> Jor - I did 40 on the docks.
<Tiana:#tp> is what I would do
<Jarik:#tp> Hated it for 3 days straight.
<Tiana:#tp> they nerfed the dorfs too much
<Perdy_OOTW> Rostered Event sounds great
<Tut|Panth> let's finish up the name thing then
<Tiana:#tp> they're a 30 minute spawn now aren't they?
<Tut|Panth> Rostered Events are great, let's use that
<nyne_TP:#tp> yeap
<Jarik:#tp> Ugh.
<Tiana:#tp> Nerfed
<Jorom:#tp> Tiana, I tried OT and got a pixel of exp in 3 hours
<Tiana:#tp> I'd do overt here
<Arenoth_Patronas> since it does not really matter what we call it, we can finish that now
<Havlok_Amici> yup.. sounds good..
<Idril_Patronas> agreed
<Urky_Iceni> no complaints
<Tallis|Iceni> agreed, next please. 3 hrs 30 so far
<Vestrial_Legends> agreed
<Jarik:#tp> Yup.  I'd do OT as well.
<Tiana:#tp> that doesn't make much sense
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> agree
<Irrani_Storm_> agreed
<Sandory_Aegis> agreed
<Jorom:#tp> not the dorfs along the beach, they are 12 minute spawn
<Cymric> Ok.. I'll reword it, but be silly to add that as an amendment, I'll change it on the calendar. ;)
<Jarik:#tp> Better Exp modifier.
<Perdy_OOTW> agreed
<Arenoth_Patronas> hehe, ok
<Tiana:#tp> and more mobs to kill
<Irrani_Storm_> yes..sounds good cymric
<Sandory_Aegis> k
<Goad_Unbroken> agreed
<Shylara_LB> yeah
<vorx_justifiers> agreed
<Havlok_Amici> thank you Abas...er.. umm.. some other game guy
<Tiana:#tp> is OT OD + modifier?
<Tut|Panth> when the summit gets posted, a clarifiaction on Rostered Events as old PEs should be made
<Tut|Panth> That's the only thing I'd ask
<Jorom:#tp> modifier?
<Cymric> Next proposed topic: [16:08] <Idril_Patronas> And where booking/guild discussions take place  i.e. summit violation discussions.   EQV or Innoruuk.Com Guilds forum.
<Jarik:#tp> Not sure on the modifier, but it's kunark-outdoor instead of antonica-outdoor.
<Jarik:#tp> exp modifier
<Havlok_Amici> yea.. and take out my smart ass comments  :)
<nyne_TP> eqv
<Perdy_OOTW> Inny.com
<Idril_Patronas> I vote Inn.com
<Jorom:#tp> you lost me
<Jarik:#tp> exp per kill for a given level mob should get you more exp in ot than bb
<nyne_TP> it's better suited to unbridled flaming =)

<Vestrial_Legends> Inn.com
<Bal_Forsaken> inny
<Urky_Iceni> eqv
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> Inn.com
<Tut|Panth> Inno.com is fine
<Idril_Patronas> Eqvault is too full of 12 year olds who just learned to cuss, and not moderated
<vorx_justifiers> inno.com
<Tallis|Iceni> might as well be inny.com.. thats where the clander is
<Urky_Iceni> inny is heavily moderated

<Cymric> urky: damn straight. ;)
<Jorom:#tp> problem I am not sure what level the mobs are in OT, I ahve been soloing them since 34
<Morpherios_FoH> One reason why it shouldn't be EQVault..... Kaurik
<Jarik:#tp> Low blues are the way to level best.
<nyne_TP> we have to deal with him regardless
<Tut|Panth> put it on inno.com
<Jarik:#tp> Most bamg for buck.

<nyne_TP> unless you want to blacklist him
<Jarik:#tp> Level 30ish mob is in the 1100-1500 hp range.  36ish is 2000-2700 range.
<nyne_TP> and say he can't schedule, but that'd be a really bad idea imo
<Jarik:#tp> There's a big step up.

<Cymric> In all honesty, and yes, this log will go public. But if a guild like DoW keeps violating summit rules, why dont you guys just "walk" in on one of their events and show how uncool they've been? And I'm not talking 1 guild, I'm saying reps from all 50 plane going guilds.
<Jorom:#tp> hmm now there is an idea
<Perdy_OOTW> inny.com

<Havlok_Amici> can I make rude gestures to them too?
<Jorom:#tp> what level is call of karana?
<Cymric> urky: I'll try not to, if it's debatable, plz tell me about it, I'm very reasonable.. I only close topics when they reach ugly flaming status.
<Tiana:#tp> fifty five
<Tut|Panth> please drop the Kaurik/DOW flames and move to the next item. =)
<Arenoth_Patronas> but if all 50 of us walked in and died at the gate in, it would look very bad
<Bodil-ashen> It would be the first step into turning all planes into a ffa
<Cymric> agreed.
<Urky_Iceni> ugly flaming is fun! :)
<Tiana:#tp> It only works on <35 mobs
<Tiana:#tp> which is useless!
<Cymric> Next proposed item:
<Cymric> [16:08] <Shylara_LB> We should also vote on when these rules take effect
<nyne_TP> sec
<nyne_TP> I'll be honest
<Jorom:#tp> Jarik, that's the strategy on dorfs, 4 at a time kite AE
<Cymric> ok wait on topic
<Tiana:#tp> Yeah but you can't get all 4 dorfs can you?
<Perdy_OOTW> We need to send this log to Abashi and demand Verant acknowledge Inny.com ;)

<Tiana:#tp> a_mage_04 shouts "You fucker! That was MINE!"
* Tiana:#tp shrugs
<Cymric> -nod- nyne. I'll heed that.
* Goad_Unbroken likes Perdy's suggestion, Inny.com acknowledged by Verant!
<Tiana:#tp> that was my experience :)
<Jorom:#tp> surprisingly the last few days when I have gone over there, I have only ran into another camped once
<Cymric> As a matter of fact, can I bring up a suggestion?
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> sure
<Perdy_OOTW> It's one major step players have taken to encourage fairness.
<Sandory_Aegis> aye Cymric
<Cymric> Instead of inny.com moderating "Guilds" how about 3 representatives from plane-going guilds?
<Morpherios_FoH> Lets write a declaration of independence to state our separation from the Verant Communist government
<Tut|Panth> That works Cym
<Jorom:#tp> so there is an additional modifier for kunark vs antotica?
<Shylara_LB> yes
<Tut|Panth> I was thinking the same damn thing. =)
<Idril_Patronas> Any bookings made after Oct. 1st are subject to the new rules?
<Havlok_Amici> oh lord.. pls.. no votes on that today... pls :)   I beg ya...
<nyne_TP> just leave it unmoderated
<Morpherios_FoH> hehe
<nyne_TP> I really doubt any 3 people will be considered impartial
<Shylara_LB> I am fine with unmoderated too
<Cymric> true enough.
<Bodil-ashen> agree nyne
<Vestrial_Legends> I agree Nyne
<Cymric> ok.. next topic!
<Irrani_Storm_> aggree nyne
<Havlok_Amici> whew
<Tut|Panth> true enough
<Cymric> [16:08] <Shylara_LB> We should also vote on when these rules take effect
<Tut|Panth> 1 week after posting
<Gallenite|Pantheon> One week after posting.
<nyne_TP> one week from posting dated
<Idril_Patronas> Any bookings made after Oct. 1st are subject to the new rules? :P
<Tiana:#tp> yup
<Tut|Panth> and only all future booked events
<Arenoth_Patronas> 1 week is good
<Perdy_OOTW> Oct 1
<Tiana:#tp> and a zone like skyfire would get you more xp then OT
<nyne_TP> and bookings before the active dated are grandfathered
<vorx_justifiers> oct 1
<Sandory_Aegis> Oct 1
<Trelani_Forsaken> agree  oct 1
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> I agree more with Oct 1str
<Tut|Panth> events made before that are grandfathered
<Tiana:#tp> xp owned for Phlint and I at the HS zone in
<Banadel_DotP> one week should be fine
<Jorom:#tp> I wish I could hunt in skyfire
<Tiana:#tp> it was fast as hell, but P couldn't handle 2 accounts down there without going nuts :)
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Or Grandfathered
<Arenoth_Patronas> if they new rules are good, why wait?
<Idril_Patronas> Oct 1st will be easier for folks to remember
<Tiana:#tp> I couldn't really hunt in skyfire really well til 53
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> One week is too soon.
<Cymric> ok, I'm stupid.. but what's grandfathered?
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> Oct 1 that means we are going to loose one Hate on a friday
<Gallenite|Pantheon> Indifferent.  As long as the timespan is longer than, "The instant we all leave here."
<Shylara_LB> I agree with Idril any bookings made after October first, existing bookings stay under the old rules
<Havlok_Amici> someone 'splain to me this grandfathered thing in lamens terms
<Tiana:#tp> without winged death it's not worth doing

<Tut|Panth> right
<Arenoth_Patronas> it means the rules here do not touch bookings made before they come into effect
<Jorom:#tp> right now I am just interested in getting through 40 and 45
<Gallenite|Pantheon> It's there, it was valid when it was posted, good enough.
<Havlok_Amici> ahh.. ok... cool
<nyne_TP> the rules don't apply to anything before when they go active

<Jorom:#tp> been trying to solo through 40 though, seems when in groups right now, I am getting absolutely nothing for exp

<vorx_justifiers> ok, all existing bookings stand, but no new bookings until 10-1, when new rules take effect?
<Idril_Patronas> I like what Cyrmic cais, is clearer
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Try again.. From Oct 1st, any new booking should abide by the new changes set forth by this summit.  Any bookings made after Oct. 1st, 2000 will be subject to the new rules.
<Goad_Unbroken> so for instance a guild who booked 2 weekends bookings allready, does not have to recant them because they were allready booked as its 2 bookings?
<Tut|Panth> any old bookings are not covered by the new rules, so it's possible to have a weekend before oct 1 and a weekend after

<Morpherios_FoH> hehe
<nyne_TP> on the veeshan schedule
<Cymric> From Oct 1st, any new booking should abide by the new changes set forth by this summit.  Any bookings made after Oct. 1st, 2000 midnight PST will be subject to the new rules.
* Urky_Iceni attempts to make the case for GMT but gives up in the face of Verant
<nyne_TP> someone scheduled FGS in late nov
<Arenoth_Patronas> are there any more topics?
<Gallenite|Pantheon> lol
<Havlok_Amici> screw 2... I'll start booking 5 now and have all of it for me and my buddies.. oh wait.. we didn't allow that.. or did we.. I forget..
<nyne_TP> with the note "I don't currently have a character on veeshan, but will have one of appropriate level by this date"
<Cymric> bah.. let's say right now that these rules cover POH and POF only.. dragons/static spawn/and planes not out are NOT covered.
<Tut|Panth> Right
<Idril_Patronas> Can we put a clear statement in the rules as to what can be booked
<Gallenite|Pantheon> Good call, Cym.

<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Agree Cymric
<Idril_Patronas> These rules _ONLY_ apply to Plane of Hate and Plane of Fear.
<Tallis|Iceni> agreed
<Cymric> Reword it for me, anyone? ;)
<Goad_Unbroken> agreed
<Arenoth_Patronas> what idril said
<Cymric> that's already stated in the original rules.
<Jarik:#tp> Nah

<Jarik:#tp> Day begins at 00:00 ends at 23:59
<Tut|Panth> Yah, just copy it from the first summit
<Urky_Iceni> um idle chatter sorry
<Idril_Patronas> not as clearly I think
<Cymric> After much debate...we came to terms on some ground-rules regarding plane bookings. We tried to make it so every guild got a shot at the planes, regardless of size and experience....this is the story.
<Cymric> *** Note: this only deals with PoF and PoH.
<Havlok_Amici> just book me for plane of sleep pls...
<Penguin> never urky

<Penguin> seriously
<Cymric> I think so..  instead of adding an addendum, I'll try to make the text stick out more on PoH and PoF bookings only.
<Urky_Iceni> really?
<Jarik:#tp> what?
<Arenoth_Patronas> I just have to say, I am very impressed that so many people could work out any kind of agreement.
<Penguin> yea
<Havlok_Amici> done?  complete?  no more?  ended?
<Aerion_LoreKeepers> Proposed Rule...  These rules cover POH and POF only.  Dragons, static spawns, and POS are not covered by these rules.
<Dacia_ShadowStalkers> *cant belive no more items to discuss*
<Jorom:#tp> umm 11:59 pm PST is 1 min before 10-2

<Cymric> Rostered events can be scheduled on the calendar.  They must include a link to a roster of expected attendees.  The roster should attempt to list 80% of the expected attendees.  If more than 6 people from the same guild are expected to attend, then it constitutes a guild booking, not a rostered event. No person can be scheduled to attend two rostered events that are on the calendar concurrently.
<rale:#tp> heh
<nick> ok, sounds good

<nick:#tp> well, except less bookings probably
<Gallenite> Which guild, Thess?

<Boisvert-HalfAFK> So what was decided in the ned?
<Boisvert-HalfAFK> end not ned
<Gallenite> Thess - Give it time.  If it's a weekday, those usually get snagged up the prior week.
<Thessaly> Aye.

<Thessaly> At least from the planes.
