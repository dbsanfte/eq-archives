<H4>Lysel Flirtsalot from Legends obtains her epic!<BR>
<span class="byline">November 26 06:46 AM, by <a href="mailto:Lyselflirtsalot@yahoo.com">Lysel Flirtsalot</a></span></H4>
<p>As I sit in the abandoned lair of Lord Nagafen with a few friends awaiting the arrival of Zordak Ragefire my head began to hurt. We had been keeping the entire area clear of the foes that were near all night and I was wondering if he would ever show himself. I thought that he was was just teasing me with the idea that he may come to visit and perish. Tappsek and I had been sharing the lair while awaiting him to arrive. I was about to give up and ask him to come on over when I placed my head in my hands and closed my eyes for a moment of silence. When I looked up he appeared before my eyes! A wonderful sight! I was so excited I don't think I moved for a few seconds while I was in awe. Many friends came to help and he was down in a flash. Thanks to all of you who came and helped me obtain this wonderful new toy!

Love and Clerical Kisses

Take care all, and have fun!
