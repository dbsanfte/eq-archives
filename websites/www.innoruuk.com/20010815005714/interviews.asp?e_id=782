<hr>
<font face="arial" size="2" color="#AAAAAA"><font color="black">Author:</font> <a href="mailto:Kadafi@Innoruuk.com" class="news">Kadafi Oakbane</a><br><br><br>

<div align="justify"><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#303030"><b>Kadafi</b>:  Tell me about the Dead of Winter.  Who formed it?  When?  Why?<BR><b>Kaurik</b>:  Ghaleon formed Dead of Winter about 4 months ago.  We used to be Four Seasons, but decided that name was just queer.  Dead of Winter was formed with one thing in mind, having fun.  Now Ghaleon's punk ass doesn’t play much anymore and he knew he was gonna be taking a long break so he made me co-leader and I decided where I wanted the guild going and got us there.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi</b>:  About how many members are in the Dead of Winter?<BR><b>Kaurik</b>:  There are about 60 of us in DoW.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi</b>:  What is the minimum level requirement to join your guild, if any?<BR><b>Kaurik</b>:  40+ for pretty much everyone.  There are a few exceptions though.  Clerics and enchanters can be 30+ just for the simple fact that they don’t stay guildless for long.  If someone in the guild wants their friend invited, there's a level 30 limit ion friends as well.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi</b>:  It's a well-known fact that you don't exactly have the "best" reputation on Innoruuk, why do you think that is?<BR><b>Kaurik</b>:  I don’t take shit off nobody.  I’m not one of these little twits that plays the little game of "you flame me I flame you, we call it even and apologize so nobody looks bad and write it off as a misunderstanding".  Basically, it's because I’m not two-faced.  Same Kaurik you talk to today is gonna be the same you talk to tomorrow.  If I tell you to go to hell now don’t expect open arms tomorrow.  I’m not very political.  I could care less about politics.  This is a game and I play it as such.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi</b>:  Has your questionable reputation had any impact on the way your guild operates?  Did any of the members leave or lose respect for you?<BR><b>Kaurik</b>:  One time someone left for the simple fact that the guild had a bad reputation.  I think...  what I say still goes for the most part.  I say who loots in planes.  I say who loots at guild events.  They give me that power because they respect me and because they respect me I don’t put anyone in a compromising situation with randoms where someone that does nothing for the guild gets to loot and someone at every guild event gets to die three times for the other person to loot.  I AM at basically ALL guild events.  I still let Rorii loot first shaman drops in PoH, mainly because I was holding out for the BP.... but still.... =)  Then Rorii quit the guild because we were “bad influences and he was trying to turn his life around" or something.  So now I don’t care if I hurt feelings, I’m gonna let the person loot that I know is gonna be there for the guild in the morning.  If they get their feelings hurt because they don’t get to loot then that's the only reason they're here and they don’t need to be.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi</b>:  What’s the story behind your longtime dispute with the Legions of Darkness?  What are your feelings towards them?<BR><b>Kaurik</b>:  Funny thing is I honestly didn’t know who Legions of Darkness was until I was 52.  Me and Ghaleon were each soloing on the raptor island in Timorous Deep.  This was back when the raptors weren't KoS to everyone.  So he's pulling his mobs, I’m pulling mine, and everyone else is pulling theirs.  A raptor spawned, and I rooted it.  Saradeline (sp?) a level 55 at the time LoD wizard started griping at me for breaking her snare.  I asked her WTF she was talking about.  She said we pulled at the same time but her snare hit it first.  I told her to kill it then.  The whole time my root is holding she's still bitching.  So I got this mad dino that likes to hit for low 100s waiting for my root to break to come eat me.  She keeps griping so I tell her if she don’t kill it then I’m going to.  She keeps bitching.  I kill the thing and she says, "my guild is gonna love this.  You just wait.  You fucked up now".  So then I start getting /tells from about 20 LoD members about "who is your guild leader?  We're gonna get you booted from your guild now" and "why did you KS her dino?  Are you ignorant?  Do you wanna join our guild?"  Half of LoD got the "kiss my fucking ass you bitches" remark after the other half had /tell spammed me for 10 minutes.  I tried to explain my side to about half of them but they didn’t care.  They were having their fun of the day or something.  Either way, that's what got my feud with LoD started.  After that it's mostly big egos that's kept it going.  The thing that really escalated it was both sides generalizing a lot.  Me saying "fuck LoD" instead of "fuck Nany" or "fuck Saradeline" because those were the main two I was having problems with.  In the same breath the ones in LoD caught in the middle would end up saying "DoW suxors" or "DoW is a bunch of gimps", which we admit to in /ooc and /shout a lot these days, instead of directing their comments at me, so it became a guild thing.  Now I don’t have problems with anyone except Anarik.  I can’t stand him.  And Haltsorn…  yeah, Haltsorn.... GNOMES MUST DIE!!!!<BR><BR><b>Kadafi</b>:  There have also been many rumors surrounding the Dead of Winter and Clan Impact.  Any truth to these rumors?<BR><b>Kaurik</b>:  Yes, the rumors are true, we're about eight times better than Clan Impact.<BR> <BR><b>Kadafi</b>:  What do you say to your critics, to the people who flame you anonymously, and moreover to the people who flame you and have never met you?<BR><b>Kaurik</b>:  To my critics...  get to know me before you try to talk crap about me.  Don’t come at me with your little bullcrap "I’m here, now impress me" attitude and we wont have problems.  To people that flame anonymously?  /laugh.  Get some balls and put your name to what you post.  I give no validity to anyone that wont put their name to a post because that is how you get respect from me.  If you're gonna stand up for what you believe in or feel needs to be said, then do it so the person you're flaming/posting about can defend themselves.  The people that never met me... read the "to my critics" part…<BR><BR><b>Kadafi</b>:  It seems everyone has a story to tell about their somewhat "unhappy" encounter with Kaurik.  Is there any truth to these stories?<BR><b>Kaurik</b>:  Probably.  As I stated before, I hate stupid people that do stupid things.  I let them know if I find them complete retards as pretty much everyone else does to me.  If they say they don’t like me because I made fun of them in /ooc for asking a warrior for a teleport then chances are it happened.  I do not train people on purpose (lets be honest, sometimes it happens and you didn’t mean to, then /shout Train to zone).  I do not ninja loot.  I do not condone any of these.  I do,  however, speak the way I wanna speak and  if you wanna censor me then go ahead but if I’m being censored then I’m gonna use enough profanity that I make it worth your time.  =)<BR><BR><b>Kadafi</b>:  How often does your guild go to Hate and Fear?  Who has looting rights?  How is that decided?<BR><b>Kaurik</b>:  Until recently we were going about once a week to planes.  Took a vacation after the bad PoF incident to "sit back and watch" and see how others plane raids went to see if it was just they or us were changing something.  We got PoH on October Friday the 13th (no, I'm not superstitious) and we got PoF next on November Friday the 10th.  After this PoH raid we're going back to the way we were doing it, a raid a week about.  =)  I just wanted to have a weekend raid so everyone could see how one was supposed to go, heh.  I chose who loots what in planes and anywhere else for that matter.  They're decided by how much I feel they've contributed to the guild lately and in the past.  Another thing...  if you’re armor drops in PoH and you do not go to PoF then do not expect to loot.  I would rather watch it rot than see you loot it.  I refuse to bust my ass in both planes and then turn around and let a "planes specialist" loot his stuff until he/her has full planar and then doesn’t wanna go anymore because it's too risky to their exp bar.  Only thing we're really lacking for planes and other stuff is enchanters.  We have 1 level 46 enchanter and that's it.  Thing that pissed me off most recently…  Beatmania…  basically we as a guild worked our ass off to get him in full planar.  He then quits and joins Ashen Vendetta because he don’t need us anymore I guess because we don’t hang out in Sebilis a lot and they do.  He wants his Donals now.  Well, good luck with the loot hungry asshole Ashen Vendetta.  What he did was total bullshit.  I gave him basically all his 51 - 55 spells and let him loot first in the planes if he needed what dropped.  He even told me he only joined Ashen Vendetta to get loot.  Said we didn’t go to Sebilis enough so he couldn’t get his 55+ spells and that's why he was there.  Enjoy the 56 resurrections while he's there for them.  <BR></div><br>
