<H1>Public Events</H1>
(This is an entirely new section.)

<OL>
<LI>The goal of public events is to provided people who are not in
	a planes-going guild access to the planes.  This includes the
	unguilded or members of guilds that just do not raid the planes.

<LI>There will be ONE public event on the calendar at a time.

<LI>Innoruuk.com will moderate a SIGNUP SHEET for people who wish to
	host (perform as raid leader) a public event.

<LI>Once the current
	public event has started, the next host on the signup sheet
	should register the next event in a timely fashion.  Failure
	to promptly pick a date (within 3 days of the previous event)
	indicates a lack of desire on the hosts part, and the event
	calendar moderator is free to pick both an event and a host.
	Picking a date far into the future will result in a similar
	response.

<LI>All public events will be PUBLIC.  A signup sheet will exist
	ON THE INNY.COM FORUMS.  The host may define reasonable
	limits based on class counts.  The host may also exclude a
	small number of people based on bad reputations.  The signup
	sheet must be made available IMMEDIATELY after posting the
	event on the calendar.

<LI>To help ensure the success of the raid, these rules will not
	limit attendance on public events based on guild affiliation.
	For instance, you may not be able to find enough unguilded
	clerics to go to Fear, or you may want an experienced puller
	to assist on the raid.  However, as a guideline, it is
	expected that the vast majority of attendees of public
	events should be unguilded or in guilds that are not
	attending the planes (either scheduled or FFA).
