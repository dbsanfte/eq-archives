<p>I've known this guild since it's inception, adn have seen many comings and goings.  Many times I have fout with, and sometimes died beside ToH members.  But, today my opinion of ToH forever changed.

I joined a group a friends from several well known guilds to bring down VS for a deserving person who gives freely of himself to help others.  We were a little off and a things didm not go as planned.  Most of us went down, a few retreated to the zone line to drop aggro and regroup.

No sooner had this happened then a ToH group, led by Kreed, who had watched out fight from a hideing place, moved into our camp.  They would not join with us, and would not honor our camp.  Further they pulled VS and his room spawns overe us as we were rezing and killed the newly rezed, which they thought a funny thing!  

Not only is this a clear violation of SoE policy and the "play nice rules", but also the most dishonoriable behavior I've seen in the history of this game!

Now I understand that Kreed leads ToH?  I'm sure Mayaxe, Tipton, Karwizzie and Denie are sickened in what the guild they lad has became, I am.

<H4>Bokkas gets his Epic!<BR>
<span class="byline">July 07 09:48 AM, by <a href="mailto:everlastingdragonlords@yahoo.com">Revenos Mistywolf</a></span></H4>
<p>Bokkas and I started our epics together and he's been sitting patiently with one kill since he got his Jade Reaver a couple months ago. So for the last week we've been camping Dolgin in Timorous Deep and of course he spawned late last night way after everyone had gone to bed. So the Hobbit Brodahood called on the God Father of da Brodahood, Crossifixio! Peeps from Glyphed Ring Gang, Silent Resurgence and Everlasting Dragon Lords ran over to TD and Faydedar fell before anyone could say "Resist Gear.". Thanks to all that came! And thanks to Pappy for coming through, yet again =) . Thanks to EDL that has been there all the way through Bokkas' epic, and to the few members of Team Epic that came to his Ulump fight so many months ago! Congrats Bokkas, you a big druid now!</P>
<H4>Crazy Week for Everlasting Dragon Lords<BR>
