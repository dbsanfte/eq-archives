<hr>
<font face="arial" size="2" color="#AAAAAA"><font color="black">Author:</font> <a href="mailto:kadafi@innoruuk.com" class="news">Kadafi Oakbane</a><br><br><br>

<div align="justify"><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#303030"><b>Kadafi:</b>  How did you first become involved with Verant Interactive?  Were you an employee prior to the EverQuest project?  Or were you brought aboard specifically for this project?<BR><b>Brad:</b>  I was hired in March, 1996 by Sony Interactive Studios, which later became 989 Studios, and then went back to being SCEA (Sony Computer Entertainment, America).  I was brought on board with Steve Clover to design and begin working on a massively multiplayer RPG, and so he and I wrote the original EverQuest design document and began coding.  In January, 1999 the PC online department at 989 Studios spun off into a separate company (Verant Interactive) and we then proceeded to complete EverQuest and start several other projects.  Recently, Sony Online Entertainment purchased Verant.  <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  How would you define your role regarding the EverQuest project?  Do you work solely on EverQuest or other side projects as well?<BR><b>Brad:</b>  I'm currently Vice President of Premium Games at Sony Online Entertainment, which basically means I'm responsible for all the subscription based massively multiplayer games we have in development.  The Producers of each product (EQ, Star Wars, Sovereign, etc.) report to me, and I try to be as involved in each project as much as is possible.   <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Can you describe the environment you work in (relaxed, professional, etc.)?<BR><b>Brad:</b>  Overall, I think it's pretty relaxed.  Jeans and T-shirts are pretty much the norm, and most employees are in their 20s and 30s, have cool posters up on their cube or office walls, like loud music, etc.  That said, when it comes to finishing these large projects the going can get pretty tough.  For example, the Velious team has been crunching for several months now, working 9-12 hour days, 6-7 days a week!  So overall I guess the atmosphere is a weird hybrid of casual, creative people who are also intense and passionate, working their butts off when necessary. <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  What types of games do you play?  Do you play EverQuest on a regular basis?  This is, of course, assuming you play computer games.<BR><b>Brad:</b>  I'm definitely a gamer... I enjoy mostly RPGs, RTSs, and racing games.  Recently I've been fiending on Age of Kings as well as F355 Challenge on the Dreamcast.  And I still play EverQuest, just not nearly as much as many of the other people here at Verant, many of whom still play late into the night even after a long day of work.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  If you were given the task of creating and designing another MMORPG, what would you make?  Fantasy, Sci-Fi, or ?  <BR><b>Brad:</b>  Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and more!  I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I'm involved in all sorts of MMOGs, some of which we've announced (Velious, Star Wars, Sovereign) and some of which we haven't.  There are all sorts of genres we're either exploring currently or plan to in the near future -- unfortunately, I'm not really at liberty to go into details. <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Nightly thousands of people immerse themselves in Norrath.  In your opinion, what makes EverQuest so appealing to the public?  <BR><b>Brad:</b>  Ah, defining the 'magic' that is EverQuest -- definitely not an easy task.  I think, in a nutshell, that it's the combination of encouraged cooperation that builds relationships, challenging environments, an immersive world, and a large group of passionate and committed players.  Of course, there's a lot more to it than that, but you probably didn't want an interview pages and pages long :) <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  What are some of your favorite in-game features EverQuest has to offer?  <BR><b>Brad:</b>  My overall favorite aspect of EverQuest is the grouping dynamic, especially at higher levels.  Watching a talented group of 40+ players navigate into a dungeon, working together as a team, each understanding his or her role in terms of support... well, it still blows me away watching it.  <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  I'm sure you're well aware of all the EQ2 rumors.  Are you able to confirm or deny talks and/or plans for EQ2?<BR><b>Brad:</b>  I really can't say anything more than I have in the past, which is to say that we'd be foolish not to be thinking about the future, and that EverQuest has a very bright road ahead of it, whether it be in terms of expansions, sequels, or other EQ related products.  Also, please keep in mind that it would be unwise to promote a sequel so early, were one to exist, when the current incarnation itself still has such a healthy life ahead of it.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Sandy Beaches or Rocky Cliffs?<BR><b>Brad:</b>  Sandy Beaches, clear water, snorkeling.... Bora Bora :)<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Blonde or Brunette?<BR><b>Brad:</b>  Brunette.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Vodka or Rum?<BR><b>Brad:</b>  Rum... Pina Coladas, Mai Tais, Daiquiris, yum!<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Intel or Athlon?<BR><b>Brad:</b>  Whatever runs my games the fastest :)<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  3dfx or nVidia?<BR><b>Brad:</b>  nVidia currently, but I was pretty excited about 3dfx before... technology changes so fast, you never know who'll be on top next.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Spaghetti + Meatballs or Spaghetti - Meatballs?<BR><b>Brad:</b>  With meatballs -- meat is good :)<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Foreign or Domestic?<BR><b>Brad:</b>  Cars: I'm definitely a Ferrari, Acura, Honda kind of guy, but then I do have a lot of respect for Vipers and Corvettes... though I doubt I'd buy one.<BR>Beer: It's Guinness Stout for me, although some of the strong red micro brewed ales are excellent too.<BR></div><br>
