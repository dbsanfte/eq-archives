<u><b>Innoruuk Guild Summit</b></u><br><br>

Leaders of majority of the plane-going guilds met to discuss
some basic rules regarding plane scheduling.  We had a representative 
present from all the major guilds on the server ... and would like to 
thank all of them for taking the time to attend.<br><br>

After much debate...we came to terms on some ground-rules regarding
plane bookings.  We tried to make it so every guild got a shot at the 
planes, regardless of size and experience....this is the story.<br><br>

*** Note: this only deals with PoF and PoH.<br><br><br>


We split events into 2 categories..booked events and FFA events.<br><br>

<u><b>Booked Events (Updated) :</b></u><br><br>

1. These rules cover POH and POF only. Dragons, static spawns, and POS are not covered by these rules.<br><br>

2. Innoruuk.com will be the calendar used for all bookings.<br><br>

3. Only 2 people per guild will be allowed to schedule events, see your Guildleader for confirmation on who these people will be.<br><br>

4. In order to book a date, a guild should have at least 7 planes capable people on its roster. If the scheduling guild does not have at least 7 planes capable members, it must be scheduled as a public event.<br><br>

5. A guild may only have *2* events booked at any given time but only one booking can be on a weekend date. A weekend is defined as Friday through Sunday, PST. This meaning that a third event cannot be booked until the first of it's 2 events have begun.<br><br>

6. No back-to-back BOOKED plane raids. eg: Fear on mon. and Hate on tues. is unacceptable....Fear on mon. and Hate on wed. is fine. (see FFA section for more info).<br><br>

7. Two or more guilds may "ally" themselves with other guilds to book a planes raid but all guilds in the alliance must use one of their bookings when doing so. When scheduling a planes raid, if you are planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild as guests, that guild must also be listed on the booking and it also counts as a booking for that guild. <br><br>

8. Your time in PoH or PoF will not exceed 16 hours. (will go into more detail on this one later in the FFA section).<br><br>

9. At end of reservation time, your guild must be out of zone completely, regardless of CR efforts. Although it is encouraged to help others with CR when practical, the 2nd guild has rights to allow or refuse CR efforts cutting into their schedule. <br><br>

10. No guild/person/group shall enter a plane without permission of the scheduled guild currently in the plane during their scheduled time.<br><br>

11. Public "Rostered Events" can be scheduled on the calendar. They must include a link to a roster of expected attendees. The roster should attempt to list 80% of the expected attendees. If more than 6 people from the same guild are expected to attend, then it constitutes a guild booking, not public event. No person can be scheduled to attend two public events that are on the calendar concurrently.<br><br>

12. Booking/guild Summit violation discussions will take place on the Innoruuk.Com Guilds forum.<br><br>

13. From Oct 1st, any new booking should abide by the new changes set forth by this summit. Any bookings made after Oct. 1st, 2000 midnight PST will be subject to the new rules.<br><br>

<u><b>FFA (free for all) Events:</b></u><br><br>

1.  If a plane is NOT booked 24 hours prior to midnight GMT (EST-5), It
becomes classified as FFA.<br><br>

2.  First group to get to an FFA plane with sufficient force (we deemed 
that to be 18ppl), gets the zone for 16 hours.<br><br>

3.  If a guild is currently in the plane clearing their own spawn 
(own time slot)...and your guild shows up with the intention of 
claiming a non-booked time slot (FFA)...let them know of your
intentions, and they MUST leave the zone after their 16 hours and let
your group occupy.<br><br>

4. If a guild is currently in the plane and finish their 16 hours, and 
there is no request to occupy...they may stay in for another 16 hours.
If you ask to occupy after they have started clearing next time slot..
your group is out of luck. So if you want an FFA timeslot, make sure to 
let the current occupants know of your intentions. <br><br>

5. FFA events do NOT count as BOOKED events...they can be done at will,
with no booking required.<br><br><br>


With that all said and done...I will add a few other points.<br><br>

<UL>
<LI>Innoruuk.com will be used...we realize that many events have already been
scheduled...and all of them will be valid.  NO more events are to be
booked until your guild gets below the 2 booking limit.  This will insure
that nobody gets screwed out of their existing time slots, and that other
guilds get their shot at some time-slots.  By April 1. the system should 
be in full motion.

<LI>Innoruuk.com will provide added security in the near future which will
allow only pre-approved access to the event editor.

<LI>Dragons will not be scheduled...still FFA.

<LI>PoS will not be scheduled...easy enough to see if ppl are there without
disturbing them or putting their lives in danger. 

<LI>This system will only work if EVERYONE complies and tries to use a little
common sense and respect.

<LI>This system is for everyone...not just who came to the meeting.  If your
guild is plane-worthy...by all means..start booking, but plz comply with
the stated rules.
</UL>



Thx all for your time.<br><br>
