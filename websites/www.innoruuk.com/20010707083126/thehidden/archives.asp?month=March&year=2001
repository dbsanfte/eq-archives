The event was very well done, and the organization was wonderful! Everyone managed to get one of the weight reducing packs, and some gems and of course many pieces for the Howling Stones keys went out.<br><br>

Not only did many see what a tight unit The Hidden works at, when something dropped most were saying "I'll wait till everyone else gets one before rolling."!!! I don't think I've ever seen so many people be so selfless at a raid!<br><br>

The experience flew for so many last night, enough so that Belledonna & I gained a new level from it.<br><br>

I'd also like to thank Stumpels, Javen & Tzin for coming along with us, we had a great time!<br><br>

Last nights raid marked my Official joining with The Hidden, and I'm proud to say that I'm now part of this Family. :)

							It looks like there is going to be a patch this Tuesday, and everyone knows what that means. All the big spawns will be up and this includes Lady Vox. There usually isn't a rush to her like Lord Nagafen but it still requires getting 30 - 36 people together for. If we do attempt her I would plan on starting about 6pm EST with a little room for those who have work to show up late. This is not definet yet. Everyone up for it?

							Many thanks to those who came on our Efreeti raid Wednesday. Things got going good but got a little rocky in the middle. It just shows how one spell can send you into CR. Sorry to those who had to wait so long to get back, especially Ghalaan. We did come out triumphant in the end though with two boots, two rings and, two Black Chitin Leggings.<br><br>

Tomorrow I am going to check if Lady Vox is up. Any interested in coming should contact a member of The Hidden or post here. Even if she is up we may not go if we do not get enough of the needed classes as corpse recovery isn't any fun!<br><br>

And finaly, Saturday evening we will be having a Kaesora raid to get Xalgoz fangs for the Howling Stones key. Start time is 8pm EST as long as Vox does not push it back later. Show up to Kaesora on time and we can bind just inside the zone! Again please post or contact a member of The Hidden if you are interested in coming.

							WHAT: Plane of Air WHO: Any members 46+, any allies and friends are welcome as well. Limited to the first 24 that we get so some classes may get bumped in order for this to work. Any extra will cost us 150pp extra per island.<br><br>WHEN: Starting Friday March 30th at 5pm EST (10 pm GMT) SHOW UP NO LATER THAN THIS PLEASE If you have ample reason and you can get there before our last port up then it will be ok. No promises though. Event will be for the entire weekend therefore be available for Friday, Saturday and Sunday if you sign up. This is a long event. WHERE: Meet at the Sro wizzy pad. We will be forming up in groups of 5 then porting up with a wizzy. Once were all up there groups will be made.<br><br>WHY: Main goals of this weekend: 1) Attempt to get mardia various parts of her epic quest items, possibly the full item. 2) Get myself a blade of aborgation for my epic. 3) Get components, complete quests for as many people as possible. LOOT: Currently the first epic drops for shadowknights and necros are reserved. All other loot will be randomed among members of the appropriate classes EXCEPT items for the key quests. There are enough components on the islands for 24 keys. All sellable items will be split among the group EXCEPT in my group in order to offset the cost of the stones unless everyone brings a stone.<br><br>SPECIAL NOTES: I would ask that everyone who comes bring a port stone from Erudin for this. As i am financing this out of my pocket it will be very expensive(250pp a stone) Extra stones will be banked for future raids.<br><br>RAID LEADER:Reshtal ALTERNATE LEADER:Boisvert Sign up now.

							That is right people! Upcoming raids part 2: the epic addition has arrived! More thrills, more chills, more uber mobs and their uber lewtz! This is what I am thinking about for the very near future. (keep in mind this doesn't have to be in this order. All of these raids are designed in order to get epic pieces.)<br><br>- The Hole! This should be our most important raid. About three steps to Reshtal's epic come from this zone along with a report that dragon scales are now dropping there. If this is so then Boisvert and Laurelai would do well to get their scales from here during the raid. We will definately need a lot of people for this, so think big. We have enough people in our previous raid lists to get plenty of 50+ people but we need to work on our 55+ people on "the list." Sounds like a 4 grouper raid to me.<br><br>- Chardok! Malcore needs to kill an Overseer and I need to kill the Royal Herbalist. Herbalist is the next step in my epic and if I can get the Manisi Herb from the Herbalist we can then go kill the mobs in Lake Rathe that are the next part of my epic. The Overseer in Chardok that Malcore has to kill is supposedly very tough, so come prepared. This is a very difficult zone. We will need plenty of people for this. My educated guess would be 5 groups at least.<br><br>- Plane of Air! Reshtal needs a Blade of Abrogation from there and I need a Cloak of Spiroc Feathers. I will let Reshtal detail us on his needs for that Blade, but I assume it is a Shadowknight quest that requires a few different pieces off various mobs. The Cloak that I need requires a Silver Disk off of Isle 3 and is commonly dropped by azeraks, a Spiroc Feather off of Isle 4 and is commonly dropped by both gorgalasks and spirited harpies, and finally, a Black Silk Cape off of Isle 5 and is a rare off the Keeper of Souls. (level 60 boss of the island) This might more effort then the others or might require less, I am really not sure.<br><br>- Various triggered spawns! After everyone gets the pieces that they need we should use all the people that we had asked to attend the raids to follow us to kill a few triggered spawns. A lot of the cleric epic (from what I saw at least) seems to be triggered spawns so getting some people together should be beneficial. That about wraps up my thoughts on the epic schedule. If there is a place that we need to raid then just tell me or post on the events board where an almost identical post has been made.

Also, Boisvert suggested an area where we could talk about our accomplishments, and point them out to people. What's great about The Hidden is that we're so new, and so small, yet we pull off very successful raids into dangerous areas where a lot of guilds will fail. Thanks mostly to our friends and allies, and ourselves for being mature and focused. So think about it, and make a few suggestions how we can point our record out to visitors and guild prospects.

							The Hidden is now officialy booked to go to the Plane of Fear on May 4th! Starting at 7pm EST we have 16 hours till 11am the following morning. Although many have work or RL and my not be able to make it at 7pm this has been taken into account. Booking at 7pm first gives us a bit of a buffer before the preceding guild and allows to have 16 hours till the following guild is scheduled. We will most likely not be able to port up at 7pm. Running in at 7pm would be preferable but we may need to wait for others to make it home.<br><br>

Big changes are coming to Fear and Hate to increase theif difficulty... and drop rates so we might need to be prepared for something much tougher than it currently is.<br><bR>
