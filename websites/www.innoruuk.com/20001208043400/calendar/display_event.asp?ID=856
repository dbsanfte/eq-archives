			<font face="arial" face="arial" size="-1">Illusere of Felwithe would like to cordially invite Norrath's finest Bakers and Brewers to the first ever Freeport Cookoff.  The Trade Foundation is looking for a Baking Trademaster (Officer), so this event is intended as a recruitment opportunity for any and all Baking Masters.  Brewers are also encouraged to come (what kind of cookoff doesn't offer beer?)  Only one officer will be chosen for the Baking field, however, sorry folks... dem's da rules.  ANYONE who comes with an interest in ANY of the Trade Skills is more than welcome to join.  Officers will be on hand to invite you.  Masters will be judged on the quality of their work and knowledge with an eye for those who can TEACH their trade to others (this is what a Trademaster DOES, after all :)...).  Anyone wishing to attend must meet prior to 10PM PST by 10 minutes at the least for introductions and pleasantries.  This event will be held at the Potter's Inn in North Freeport (the inn with the pottery wheel outside and a brew barrel and oven inside).  Come One, Come All!
