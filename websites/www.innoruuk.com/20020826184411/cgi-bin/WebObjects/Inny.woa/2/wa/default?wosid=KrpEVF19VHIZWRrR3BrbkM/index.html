<H4>Denross' Thought of the Week<BR>
<span class="byline">August 26 11:10 AM, by <a href="mailto:Denross@innoruuk.com">Denross Tapferkeit</a></span></H4>
<p>If places like Freeport and Qeynos stopped needing guards at the gates ... what other job skills could they list on a resume?  Good at killing rats, snakes and bats ... oh and the occasional suicidal Fippy.</P>
<H4>Denari gets her Leafblower!!!<BR>
<span class="byline">August 25 12:42 PM, by <a href="mailto:rockbrigade@holtmail.com">WickedSin</a></span></H4>
<p>Early this afternoon Fay was killed in TD, and Denari is now a proud owner of a Leafblower. Thanks to all the Moonies, and friends for coming out and making it happen today! Congratz Denari</P>
<H4>Swall becomes a PASTY GANGSTER~<BR>
<span class="byline">August 25 10:10 AM, by <a href="mailto:noobmaster@hotmail.com">Zath</a></span></H4>
<p>I'm guessing it must have been a year or more ago that Swall got his ragebringer, and when he got it, Stanos said it would look brand new forever. WELL, this saturday Swall was happily shanking stuff in the back when he noticed a <b>SCRATCH</b> on it. OH NO! Swall's like WTF?! Swall was REALLY mad, and he was seeking vengeance, so he called us in to Highpass Hold. So we go to Stanos and we're like WTF man you said Swall's Ragebringer would look brand new forever. Stanos goes, "Well uhhhh I guess it didn't now did it, now bugger off I have important things to take care of". Swall says, "There's just 1 problem, Stanos. I don't like being lied to, so tonight, you sleep with <b>TEH FISHES</b>." We killed Stanos, and Swall took his head to General Vhgera in Kithicor and the General gave him a brand new <b>GUISE OF THE COERCER~</b></P>
<H4>Tizerak gets his flaming sword of epic uberness!<BR>
<span class="byline">August 25 01:32 AM, by <a href="mailto:jeisenne@innoruuk.com">Jeisenne Naerisse</a></span></H4>
<p>In what has been a hectic epic filled week for the crazy folks on Notabilis Kruoris, Tizerak is the next one to complete his paladin epic!
<br><br>
It only took you 3 years to get it Tizerak, but in the end it's well worth it we hope!  Many thanks to LSoG for allowing Tizerak to go with you to PoA today and to Gart for doing the MQ of the Hate BP.  You guys are awesome and we will remember this act of kindness!
<br><br>
Congrats again Tiz, who will you smack around with flamey today?</P>
<H4>Epic at Last...<BR>
<span class="byline">August 25 12:38 AM, by <a href="mailto:falidaar@hotmail.com">Zathros</a></span></H4>
<p>Falidaar Lifegiver earned his Water Sprinkler today.  He was born back in January of 2000, showing that with persistance the regular player can earn the epic.  Thanks to many great people in X`ile, The Final Covenant, The Eternal Flame and Elder Tribunal who over tha past year have helped Falidaar get his epic.  Special thanks to Saemayel who endured many hours of camping RageFire with Falidaar.  </P>
<H4>Aesa gets her Spear of Fate!<BR>
<span class="byline">August 23 12:52 AM, by <a href="mailto:jeisenne@innoruuk.com">Jeisenne Naerisse</a></span></H4>
<p>Tonight, Notabilis Kruoris took down Lord Rak`Ashiir in City of Mist to help Aesa complete the last step to obtaining her Spear of Fate!  In the span of three days, Aesa dinged 56, got the spell Torpor after our guild killed Sev, and now weilds her epic!
<br><br>
What a busy week it has been for you Aesa!  Also thanks to all of Aesa's friends who have helped along the way.  Congrats on an epic well deserved!</P>

<p>If you have not heard already, just to let all of you know that Felor has finally hit 60!  And I am not talking about the number of times he has died in some dark dungeon, but in fact, I am talking about his level!
