<H4>A Longing Fulfilled...<BR>
<span class="byline">August 10 04:30 PM, by <a href="mailto:keatslovesonnet@hotmail.com">Keats Lovesonnet</a></span></H4>
<p>...is sweet to the soul. <i>~Proverbs 13:19</i>

<P>
Caraleena, Sigil of Ocean Mist, and Falkerr, Sigil of Balanced Steel, were wed on an idyllic island in the Ocean of Tears on Saturday afternoon! Many Sigils and friends were in attendance to wish this new couple fine days and sweet nights in their new life together. Congratulations Falkerr and Caraleena Coppersmith!

<H4>Grats Ordrich on SK epic!!! the first for FOH ever.<BR>
<span class="byline">August 10 04:09 AM, by <a href="mailto:jens@roved.dk">Halbred</a></span></H4>
<p>ConGratulations Ordrich and FoH on completion of SK epic!! Last night in CoM we did the last fight and even tho the NPC corpse poofed on us we had the GM assistance to put the epic where it belongs, in the hands of a very nice and very skilled player, Ordrich.

<P>
I also want to extend my thank you to Tjark, Dindaur and a few others (I am frightfully bad at remembering names, but you know who you are) for helping out with the fight...</P>
<H4>Lost Souls of Glaznor - Three Year Anniversary<BR>
<span class="byline">August 09 11:38 AM, by <a href="mailto:utrellien@glaznor.org">Utrellien Pentragon</a></span></H4>
<p>Siglo said it best in words once. <i>"A bunch of friends who accidentally levelled"</i>. 
<p>
For three years now the Souls have striven thru the land. No adventure too big and no friend left behind. I can surely say that I am very proud what we have created together. Not another ueber guild nor another nice guild without power. We managed to retain our good spirit and grew to face bigger Adventures. 
<p>
If three years ago someone would have asked me what the Souls should be one day I would have answered "A strong and nice guild". I would never even have believed what more they can be. We might not be as strong as a guild who can clear North ToV but instead we surely are the strongest when it comes to the binding between us :) And that is all that ever matters! 
<p>
I thank you all for the last three years. I thank you for the wonderful time we have had together and the great friendship. I thank you that you never got mad at me for leading in the wrong direction or producing yet another mass wipeout :) I hope that this will always be and that I one day can say to the son of my daughter "I play this damn old game because it is not just pixels. Those are my friends" :) 
<p>
Over the time the Souls and me also made alot of friends out there in Norrath and worked together with respected guilds. To all of you a huge thank you as well. It was and will always be a pleasure to work with you together for whatever goal we may want to go after.
<p>
Lets see what the next years will bring us :)
