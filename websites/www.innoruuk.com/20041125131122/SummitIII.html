<H1>Summit III Notes</H1>
This document is the proposed new Summit III ruleset.  I started with
the existing set and made chnages as best I can.  I have retained the
original rules set off in italics and marked (TBR'd) so you can compare.
These areas will be dropped after we approve the document.  My changes
are bolded.

<H1>Innoruuk Guild Summit</H1>
Leaders of majority of the plane-going guilds met to discuss some basic rules
regarding plane scheduling. We had a representative present from all the major
guilds on the server ... and would like to thank all of them for taking the
time to attend.

<P>
After much debate...we came to terms on some ground-rules regarding plane
bookings. We tried to make it so every guild got a shot at the planes,
regardless of size and experience....this is the story. 

<P>
<B>On Oct 27, 2001, Summit III was convened, resulting in new rules
designed to alleviate various issues including access to epic drops.</B>

<P>
*** Note: this only deals with PoF and PoH.

<P>
We split events into 2 categories..booked events and FFA/FiF events. 

<H1>Booked Events (Updated) </H1>

<OL>
<LI>These rules cover POH and POF only. Dragons, static spawns, and POS
	are not covered by these rules. 

<LI>Innoruuk.com will be the calendar used for all bookings. 

<LI><B>A mix of scheduled raids and FFA/FiF will take place.  Additional
	sections below define the schedule for FFA/FiF.</B>

<LI>Only 2 people per guild will be allowed to schedule events, see your
	Guildleader for confirmation on who these people will be. 

<LI><I>(TBR'd) In order to book a date, a guild should have at least 7 planes capable
	people on its roster. If the scheduling guild does not have at least
	7 planes capable members, it must be scheduled as a public event. </I>

<LI><B>In order to book a date, a guild should have at least 18 planes
	capable people on its roster and expected to attend the event.  If
	on the day of the raid, the guild is unable to assemble 12 of it's
	members, the plane should be considered a FFA.
	Note: THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE OLD SYSTEM.</B>

<LI><I>(TBR'd) A guild may only have *2* events booked at any given time but only one
	booking can be on a weekend date. A weekend is defined as Friday through
	Sunday, PST. This meaning that a third event cannot be booked until
	the first of it's 2 events have begun. </I>

<LI><I>(TBR'd) No back-to-back BOOKED plane raids. eg: Fear on mon. and Hate on tues.
	is unacceptable....Fear on mon. and Hate on wed. is fine. (see FFA
	section for more info).</I>

<LI><I>(TBR'd) Two or more guilds may "ally" themselves with other guilds to book a
	planes raid but all guilds in the alliance must use one of their
	bookings when doing so. When scheduling a planes raid, if you are
	planning to bring more than 6 people from another guild as guests, that
	guild must also be listed on the booking and it also counts as a booking
	for that guild. </I>

<LI><B>A guild may have only ONE event booked at any given time.  You may
	book your next event once your current event has begun.  Note: THIS IS
	A CHANGE FROM THE OLD SYSTEM.</B>

<LI><B>Provided a guild has the minimums outlined above, a guild may
	accept any additional help required to clear the planes or kill
	boss mobs.  Note that this is NOT encouragement to bypass booking
	rules by creating twink guilds.  That sort of behavior would be
	highly dishonorable.  Note: THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE OLD SYSTEM.</B>

<LI><B>In order to achieve the minimums expressed above, two or more guilds
	may ally together, each consuming their booking right when scheduling
	an event.  This ensures small guilds access to the planes.</B>

<LI>Your time in PoH or PoF will not exceed 16 hours. (will go into more
	detail on this one later in the FFA section). 

<LI>At end of reservation time, your guild must be out of zone completely,
	regardless of CR efforts. Although it is encouraged to help others with
	CR when practical, the 2nd guild has rights to allow or refuse CR efforts
	cutting into their schedule. 

<LI>No guild/person/group shall enter a plane without permission of the
	scheduled guild currently in the plane during their scheduled time. 

<LI><I>(TBR'd) Public "Rostered Events" can be scheduled on the calendar. They must
	include a link to a roster of expected attendees. The roster should
	attempt to list 80% of the expected attendees. If more than 6 people
	from the same guild are expected to attend, then it constitutes a guild
	booking, not public event. No person can be scheduled to attend two
	public events that are on the calendar concurrently. </I>

<LI><B>Public rostered events will be scheduled on the calendar.  The
	goal of these events is to provide people who otherwise may not
	have access to the planes their chance.  A section below discusses
	public events in detail.  Note: Public events will be handled
	differently than in the past!</B>

<LI><B>By permission of the reserving guild, the second floor of hate
	may be occupied without consuming a booking.  However, the occupants
	of second floor should facate the plane at the end of the booking guild's
	reservation.  Also please try to respect the next guild's respawn period,
	which may involve leaving early.</B></LI>

<LI>Booking/guild Summit violation discussions will take place on the
	Innoruuk.Com Guilds forum. 

<LI><I>(TBR'd) From Oct 1st, any new booking should abide by the new changes set forth
	by this summit. Any bookings made after Oct. 1st, 2000 midnight PST
	will be subject to the new rules. </I>

<LI><B>The new Summit III rules take effect Dec 1, 2001.  Existing bookings prior
	to Oct 27, 2001 will be honored, but you are stronly encouraged to move any
	bookings that exist during the designated FFA/FiF days.  December 2001 bookings
	during these days must be moved.</B>

</OL>

<H1>Unscheduled FiF (First In Force) Events</H1>
<B>Note: References to FFA turned to FiF for consistent naming.</B>

<OL>
<LI>If a plane is NOT booked 24 hours prior to midnight GMT (EST-5),
	It becomes classified as FiF. 
<LI>First group to get to an FiF plane with sufficient force (we deemed
	that to be 18ppl), gets the zone for 16 hours.  Note: this means
	the people must be IN THE ZONE, not gathering to enter.
<LI>If a guild is currently in the plane clearing their own spawn (own
	time slot)...and your guild shows up with the intention of claiming
	a non-booked time slot (FiF)...let them know of your intentions, and
	they MUST leave the zone after their 16 hours and let your group occupy. 
<LI>If a guild is currently in the plane and finish their 16 hours, and
	there is no request to occupy...they may stay in for another 16 hours.
	If you ask to occupy after they have started clearing next time slot..
	your group is out of luck. So if you want an FiF timeslot, make sure
	to let the current occupants know of your intentions. 
<LI>FiF events do NOT count as BOOKED events...they can be done at will,
	with no booking required. 
</OL>

<H1>Scheduled FFA and FiF Events</h1>
FFA is defined as Free-For-All.  These are the rules that exist throughout
Norrath -- where anyone is able to zone into an area and begin hunting.

<P>
FiF is defined as First-In-Force.  This means that the first group to
assemble sufficient force -- which is defined as 18 people -- owns
the zone just as if it were a scheduled event.

Summit III has opened 3 days a week for FFA/FiF in both planes.  FFA/FiF
begins at 4 AM Pacific time on Tuesday mornings and ends at 4 AM Pacific
time on Friday morning.  The period from 4 AM until the start of the
Friday booking is considered respawn time.  You must exit the
zone and allow for respawn at 4 AM Pacific time Friday morning.

<H1>Public Events</H1>
(This is an entirely new section.)

<OL>
<LI>The goal of public events is to provided people who are not in
	a planes-going guild access to the planes.  This includes the
	unguilded or members of guilds that just do not raid the planes.

<LI>There will be ONE public event on the calendar at a time.

<LI>Innoruuk.com will moderate a SIGNUP SHEET for people who wish to
	host (perform as raid leader) a public event.

<LI>Once the current
	public event has started, the next host on the signup sheet
	should register the next event in a timely fashion.  Failure
	to promptly pick a date (within 3 days of the previous event)
	indicates a lack of desire on the hosts part, and the event
	calendar moderator is free to pick both an event and a host.
	Picking a date far into the future will result in a similar
	response.

<LI>All public events will be PUBLIC.  A signup sheet will exist
	ON THE INNY.COM FORUMS.  The host may define reasonable
	limits based on class counts.  The host may also exclude a
	small number of people based on bad reputations.  The signup
	sheet must be made available IMMEDIATELY after posting the
	event on the calendar.

<LI>To help ensure the success of the raid, these rules will not
	limit attendance on public events based on guild affiliation.
	For instance, you may not be able to find enough unguilded
	clerics to go to Fear, or you may want an experienced puller
	to assist on the raid.  However, as a guideline, it is
	expected that the vast majority of attendees of public
	events should be unguilded or in guilds that are not
	attending the planes (either scheduled or FFA).

</OL>

<H1>In conclusion</H1>
With that all said and done...I will add a few other points.

<UL>
<LI>Innoruuk.com will be used...we realize that many events have already
	been scheduled...and all of them will be valid. NO more events are to
	be booked until your guild gets below the 2 booking limit. This will
	insure that nobody gets screwed out of their existing time slots, and
	that other guilds get their shot at some time-slots. By April 1. the
	system should be in full motion. 
<LI>Innoruuk.com will provide added security in the near future which will
	allow only pre-approved access to the event editor. 
<LI>Dragons will not be scheduled...still FFA. 
<LI>PoS will not be scheduled...easy enough to see if ppl are there without
	disturbing them or putting their lives in danger. 
<LI>This system will only work if EVERYONE complies and tries to use a little
	common sense and respect. 
<LI>This system is for everyone...not just who came to the meeting. If
	your guild is plane-worthy...by all means..start booking, but plz
	comply with the stated rules. 

</UL>
<P>
Thx all for your time.
