							Many thanks to all of those who atteneded our raid on the City

					we teamed up with Amici together we were able to take out
					Rak'Ashiir and got a Runed Ornate Blade! Two Jade Reavers and
					a Mace of Shadowed Souls droped as well! There were no wipe outs
					and very few deaths! Check back soon for more news on the City
					of Mist Raid.

					City of Mist</a> will be happening on Saturday February 24 at 8:00
					PM EST. Invite all of your friends, we have about 8 or 9 people
					coming so far but we will definately need a lot more! Probably
					3-4 groups should attend, this will be a big raid if we plan on
					getting some of the uber loot. (Ornate Rune Shield...*grins*)The
					more the better! Also, as a side note, the Shaman epic quest
					requires the killing of a lot of the spawns off of the black
					reavers. Be sure to bring along any of your shaman friends that
					need to work on getting a Spear of Fate.<br><br>

					Also, when it comes to Velious, a raid on the Tower of Frozen
					Shadow might be a heck of a lot of fun. We will need to do a
					preliminary raid by a few members in order to get as many keys
					as possible, but beyond that the sky is the limit, literally! On
					the seventh floor is a very powerful mob (I forget the name)
					that is sort of the boss of the zone. She drops some very nice
					loot but takes several groups to kill (I assume she will be
					about PA in Kedge Keep difficulty, but I may be wrong)<br><br>

					Lastly, I want to get a raid going on those nasty Coldain in
					Velious. For too long I have been on good terms with these
					dwarves and I want to ruin it! I feel like I have lost all
					respect for myself by siding with dwarves. (yuck! No offense
					Malcore, of course :) ) A lot of neat loot drops in Thurgadin
					and Icewell Keep. This raid will probably be hard to get together
					however and we might need to make it quite large considering
					most people actually like the idea of being amiable with these
					frozen beer swillers! (*glares at Boisvert*) Posting on
					Innoruuk.com will probably be a must. I would like this raid to
					replace our planned Kith raid, try to recruit guildless people
					this way, and save that raid for another time.<br><br>

					In conclusion, it seems like we could have a very promising
					future when it comes to raids and recruiting! Keep on posting
					here if you have doubts or concerns about any of these raids or
					just want to get in on the fun :)

							Boisvert will be gone this coming weekend to return monday.
					A few page layout and little things will be or already have been
					changed as well. The applications forum you might have noticed
					is locked. Instead of posting in a forum open to the public if you
					wish to apply to The Hidden please send an email to <a
					href="ug_mug@yahoo.com">ug_mug@yahoo.com</a> at the present time
					with the appropriate information. Boisvert will then post in the
					members only section where any prospective members may be
					sponsored. From the time that a person is sponsored there shall
					be one week of voting at the maximum. In an effort to get back
					to prospective members any votes cast by the end of this week
					shall be counted. So members make sure to keep checking the
					members only section to get your vote in. For the layout as well
					some people have expressed some confusion in the board layout.
					The follow three links are the most important ones that should be

							Saturday evening the 10th The Hidden and friends arrived in
					Trakanon's Teeth. After a late start we started the Forager
					spawn table going. To our dismay we soon found where the Hunter
					was. Doom was up! The scourge of all adventures to Trakanon's
					Teeth. This ghostly Iksar with almost Bard's speed was holding up
					the Hunter Spawn. We gathered up our forces and the battle began.
					Four of our number fell but Doom was himself Doomed and fell to
					the ground blessing us with Pillars of Fire, a 50+ Wizard Spell.

					<br><br>The Hunter was now going and the chase was on! Slowly
					but steadily everyone collected their medallions until we all
					had the parts for a Sebilis key. But before the night was over
					another named showed his face: Crusader Zoglic! Again we prepared
					for the fight and he charged our ranks. Boisvert took his Harm
					Touch leading him back but survived the whole distance. Zoglic
					was dropped with no casualties. Congrats to Amanar on his new
					Iksar Cerimonial Chestplate!

					<br><br>All members should keep tuned in on the board. There are

							Last night The Hidden arrived at Paw and brought it to the

					him down and the train he created we destroyed all comers.
					Congratulations to Mitivo and Mardia for aquiring Kurrpok's Ruby
					Pendant for the Jeweled Skull Quest. This was the last piece
					Mitivo needed. Congratulations to Mardia as well for getting her
					summon corpse spell. Time for everyone to put a coffin in the
