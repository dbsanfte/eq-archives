		<b>ATTENDANCE:</b><br>
		By signing up for a raid hosted by The Hidden you agree to abide by all rules noted below as well show up at
		the appointed time for the raid ready to start. All raids show on this page will be in Eastern time. As well,
		wyou will have completed all Pre-Raid Requirements. Failure to do so will result in action by the raid leader.<br><br>
		<b>PRE-RAID REQUIREMENTS:</b><br>
		When coming to a raid hosted by The Hidden the following steps should be taken before showing up at the
		appointed place on time. Do not count on the server being up on time or real life activities ending on time.
		If you have any doubts complete the following steps the night before and precamp at the meeting place. For
		regular raids buy at least 40 food and 40 water. Do not count on other attendees to supply some if you run
		low. Be bound at the appropriate spot. If the raid leader provides none bind as close as possible to the
		meeting point or at the Wizard Spires in Greater Faydark. Bring 150pp unless otherwise noted by the raid
		leader. This is enough to buy a coffin if needed or help pay for any regeants, items, or services. Make sure
		to have the correct gear and to not be encumbered.<br><br>
		<b>COMMUNICATION:</b><br>
		There will be an order of command that should be followed. The Raid Leader is in command, listen to anything
		they say. They may designate a Second in command or someone to help them lead. Listen to anything this person
		says. Below the Raid Leader and Second there will be a Puller or pull team. They should be reporting to the
		raid leaders. Below the Raid Leader and Second there will also be a main assist. It is important a /assist key
		be made with their name and and not pushed until they have called the target. All of the above people, as well
		as Enchanters, may use the shout channel at their discretion. All Incoming, Assist messages should be in shout.
		Enchanters and Shamans have the option to use shout as well for mesmerizing and slowing purposes. Everyone else
		should use /ooc or /say at all other times. Below the Raid Leader and Second each group will have a Group
		leader. The Leader or Second will stay in touch with all group leaders and it is the group leaders responsiblity
		to keep in touch with all their groupmates no matter what is happening. As long as this chain is not broken all
		raid attendee's will know what is happening in any extraneous cases.<br><br>
		<b>CORPSE RECOVERY:</b><br>
		In the event of death or whipeouts the dead should /consent any names provided by the raid leader at the start
		of the raid as well as their Group leader. Do not attempt to retrieve your own corpse. The Raid Leader or
		Second will organise corpse recovery to be as safe as possible. Most importantly remember the time of your death.
		The res timer lasts 3 hours and you may be asked to camp completely out of EQ in the case where corpse recovery
		lasts a long time.<br><br>
		<b>LOOTING:</b><br>
		The main objective of The Hidden's looting policy is to get loot into the hands of those who deserve and will
		derive the most benefit from the items dropped. No bias will be placed against guests or towards members of The
		Hidden. Items are not meant to be sold, but to be used. In the event that no one needs the item, the objective
		is to pass out all loot as fairly as possible to as many members of the raid as possible. Please note a member
		of The Hidden, or someone appointed by the Raid leader will master loot for each group in the case where they
		get the kill. Any drops, regardless of how small or large should be announced in OOC.<br><br>

		<ul type=I>
			<li>All items looted will be randomed, unless a stated objective of the Raid is to get a certain item, either
				for the guild or an attendee.</li>
			<li>Precious Gems, used for trade skills will be randomed at the end of the Raid between all attendees
				who received nothing.</li>
			<li>Sellable items, those only meant to be sold to merchants, will help cover the cost of any components,
				reagents, or services required during the raid.</li>
			<li>Items will be randomed between the appropriate classes.
				<ul>
					<li>Warriors will not be rolling on Golden Efreeti Boots nor Clerics for Flowing Black Silk
						Sashes.</li>
					<li>Raid Leaders have the option to suspend this rule for their Raid.</li>
					<li>Attendee's may only roll for characters they have in attendance. Twinks or secondary
						characters not present may not be rolled for.</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Only those who will honestly use the item that dropped will be allowed to random.
				<ul>
					<li>If all of those who are of the appropriate classes decline the item or do not need the
					item the item is considered "Subpar". Everyone who has not yet looted an item may get a
					chance to roll if they choose.</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Each attendee shall get one item per Raid until everyone has received one item.
				<ul>
					<li>If all attendees from a set of classes have one item but other attendees from other
						classes do not and another item drops that can be used by one among the first set
						classes, they will random for second item.</li>
					<li>"Subpar" items do not count against items looted. In the case where someone has looted
						a "subpar" item and a good item and someone else has nothing the "subpar" item should
						be passed on so that everyone leaves the raid with at least one item preferably.</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>The first item dropped, not considered "Subpar" will be randomed among The Hidden. This rule only
				applies to the first item not "Subpar" and the first item only. The Raid Leader has the option to
				suspend this rule and should do so where the expected number of drops is low.</li>
			<li>All rolls will be a 200 point margin. Ex. 0 - 200, or 200 - 400.</li>
			<li>Attendees will get a +10 points to their roll for every Raid they have attended since they last
				looted. Once they have looted their bonus shall be set back to 0.</li>
			<li>Those who arrive late will dealt with on an idividual basis by the Leader of the Raid.</li>
