If you are banned/kicked from the chat room, it's probably for a good reason. That includes by Pengy, Tuur, Tuttle, or any other #innoruuk channel operator. Do not email me and expect to be let back in, because I've researched all issues of being kicked and banned, and verified that it was for a valid reason. The chat is here to provide users with a friendly environment to talk with other players from the server, it's not a sandbox, and it's not a kindergarten recess area. If you act like an idiot, you will be kicked and banned for being that way.</div><br>
