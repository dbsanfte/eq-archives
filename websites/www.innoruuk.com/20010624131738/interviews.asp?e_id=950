<hr>
<font face="arial" size="2" color="#AAAAAA"><font color="black">Author:</font> <a href="mailto:kadafi@innoruuk.com" class="news">Kadafi Oakbane</a><br><br><br>

<div align="justify"><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#303030"><b>Kadafi:</b>  When was Ashen Vendetta formed? <BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Ashen was formed somewhere around April of this year.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Are you the original founder?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  I am the guild leader but the original founders are Odaen, Drexor, Elsid, Ralthin, & myself. <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  How many members? <BR><b>Schagger:</b>  We currently have around 50 members but around 10 of them are second characters for mains that run them on second computers.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  What does it take to become a member?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Unless you're recruited for Ashen you'd need to know someone in the guild and group with Ashen members before ever getting membership.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Tell me about your roots with Storm. <BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Well Storm was already established as a guild before I joined them. Basically I was level 50 soloing Ice giants in a small guild that I was apart of since level 30.  I left them and a week later I was tired of Aggravator recruiting me and I ended up joining Storm.<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  What is Ashen Vendetta about? What are it's beliefs and goals? <BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Ashen was formed on the basic idea of friendship and fun.  There isn't anything I wouldn't do for a member of Ashen.  We work well together and have fun doing it.  When we first started we had 8 people in the guild. Usually 4 or 5 in guild chat at night.  We were doing fear with 8 people because that's all we had.  Then I started putting the puzzle together. People may say we are Storm 2 or no one is happy in Ashen.  Don't be mistaken we are a tight guild that will be around for a long time.  <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  And of Trakanon?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Our first big goal I set was to kill Trakanon by October 21st.  Our first attempt was going to be on October 21st but we went down to his lair a little early to learn his lair pathing and Trak was up.  We agroed him with 18 people and got him to 40%.  So we tried him that night with 30 people and got him to 20-30%.  After that we tried him maybe 3 or 4 times with no success.  On the night of October 21st, we went down and killed Trakanon.  That was huge for me that we met our goal.  Other goals? hmmm..  Well Veeshan is in our future.  As of  our last Trak killing we now have 33 teeth.  We need a few more before we enter VP.  By the time we all get the quest done we will be set to go in.  Obviously SOV is coming out.  You can be damn sure we will be headed there.<BR> <BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  What is your relationship like with the Legions of Darkness?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Haha good question. It depends.  Personally I like some of them.  They show up kick ass & take names.  They've been the top guild on Innoruuk for a long time now and no one has ever come close to doing what they have done in the time they can get it done in.  Sydsloot is a great leader and will continue to keep Legions of Darkness moving forward.  As for Ashen - Legions of Darkness relations.  Some LOD members can't stand me as many hate me heh.  Reasons? I don't know.  Could be in the heat of battle I'm very competitive and come off as being the biggest asshole on the server.  <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Ever butted heads in-game?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  We raced to VS one night. Ashen and LOD just clearing to him,  Mobs everywhere in Karnors. Both guilds just kicking ass.  We split off and Ashen jumped down into the arena as LOD was coming through the door.  Was pretty fun if you ask me. I think competition like that is or can be fun at times.  Don't get me wrong, training each other and killing everyone is NOT fun. We are both excellent in fighting though.  So you can have lots of fun.  I guess some of the arguments we have had in the past were simply wanting recognition of some tough tasks that we have completed but instead getting slammed.  For Ashen, being the second guild on Innoruuk to kill mobs like Trakanon and the Queen in Chardok says a lot IMHO about the kind of players we have.  <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Do you think the competition LoD brings adds or takes away from the gaming experience?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Well the answer to that can go either way.  I think competition keeps life in a game that, let's face it, is getting old.  On the other hand, competing for a spawn that is trivial to kill only because guild member 39 still needs a breast plate really does take away from the gaming experience.  But this has nothing to do with LOD.  This has everything to do with Verants poor design choices.  <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  How often does Ashen raid the planes?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Well seeing that currently looking a plane is like a month in advance.  We usually do a Fear and Hate raid once a month.  And the sad part is because Verant put quest items in the planes for class epics, that is the main reason we are going to the planes.  <BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Funions or Awesome Blossom?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Awesome Blossom<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Apples or Oranges?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Oranges<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  The beach or the woods?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  The woods<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Pepsi or Coke?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Coke<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  DSL or Cable?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Cable<BR><BR><b>Kadafi:</b>  Foreign or Domestic?<BR><b>Schagger:</b>  Domestic<BR></div><br>
