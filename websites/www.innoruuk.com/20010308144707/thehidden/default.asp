					City of Mist</a> will be happening on Saturday February 24 at 8:00
					PM EST. Invite all of your friends, we have about 8 or 9 people
					coming so far but we will definately need a lot more! Probably
					3-4 groups should attend, this will be a big raid if we plan on
					getting some of the uber loot. (Ornate Rune Shield...*grins*)The
					more the better! Also, as a side note, the Shaman epic quest
					requires the killing of a lot of the spawns off of the black
					reavers. Be sure to bring along any of your shaman friends that
					need to work on getting a Spear of Fate.<br><br>

					Also, when it comes to Velious, a raid on the Tower of Frozen
					Shadow might be a heck of a lot of fun. We will need to do a
					preliminary raid by a few members in order to get as many keys
					as possible, but beyond that the sky is the limit, literally! On
					the seventh floor is a very powerful mob (I forget the name)
					that is sort of the boss of the zone. She drops some very nice
					loot but takes several groups to kill (I assume she will be
					about PA in Kedge Keep difficulty, but I may be wrong)<br><br>

					Lastly, I want to get a raid going on those nasty Coldain in
					Velious. For too long I have been on good terms with these
					dwarves and I want to ruin it! I feel like I have lost all
					respect for myself by siding with dwarves. (yuck! No offense
					Malcore, of course :) ) A lot of neat loot drops in Thurgadin
					and Icewell Keep. This raid will probably be hard to get together
					however and we might need to make it quite large considering
					most people actually like the idea of being amiable with these
					frozen beer swillers! (*glares at Boisvert*) Posting on
					Innoruuk.com will probably be a must. I would like this raid to
					replace our planned Kith raid, try to recruit guildless people
					this way, and save that raid for another time.<br><br>

					In conclusion, it seems like we could have a very promising
					future when it comes to raids and recruiting! Keep on posting
					here if you have doubts or concerns about any of these raids or
					just want to get in on the fun :)<br>

					After our meeting, which I would like to thank everyone for
					attending, I sat down today to get a barrage of page updates done.
					The following pages have been updated or created today: <a
					href="submit.asp">Submit News</a>, <a href="archives.asp">
					Archives</a>, <a href="joining.asp">Joining</a>, <a
					href="roster.asp">Roster</a>, and <a href="rules.asp">Rules</a>.
					With all these updates all Members should read over these pages
					especially the <a href="joining.asp">Joining</a> page and the
					<a href="rules.asp">Rules</a> page. Check to make sure nothing
					was left off and there are no typoes. To go along with all these
					changes on the Guildpage I have posted a example poll in the
					Members Only Voting Booth to show how to go about sponsoring
					a Prospective Member. The poll colors have been fixed as well.
					
					<br><br>Many thanks to Chulainn, Mitivo, Peppermynt and Xele
					for showing up on time for our first Official meeting. Heeroe
					logged in 5minutes late and Mardia an hour later. Split also
					showed up for the end after some RL issues.<br><br>
					
					Our first topic was how we wanted Leadership to work. It was
					decided our original idea of a council would be too cumbersome
					and nothing would get done fast enough. The idea that was finally
					setteled upon was to have the guild elect one Leader. That Leader
					could then appoint up to three Council Members to assit him.
					Check out the <a href="rules.asp">Rules</a> for more details on
					how this all works. I was elected as Leader and would like to
					thank everyone for their votes. Although the Rat wanted a recount
					the GMs didn't seem to answer his position :-)<br><br>
					
					As my first council nomination I appointed Mardia to the Council.
					I am abstaining from nominating any others right now as I feel
					no one has shown enough leadership in The Hidden to assume a
					position like this. I nominated Mardia for her drive to get events
					going successfully and get them going on time.<br>
