<H4>Rendlin has a new Leafblower!!!<BR>
<span class="byline">May 31 09:35 AM, by <a href="mailto:mitchh@bellatlantic.net">Beonar Orchammer</a></span></H4>
<p>At approximately 2:30am on the 30th, Rendlin put out the call for aid in killing the spawned Faydedar.  Forces from several guilds responded, but primarily from Lost Souls of Glaznor, and Spirit of the Moon.  There were many from other Guilds as well, and special thanks go out to everyone that responded!  The true drama was Rendlin going LD during the fight, and making it back with 54 seconds left to loot his item from the dead leezards corpse!  Grats Rendlin, on a job well done, and a Leafblower most deserved!!!

<H4>LUXAR GETS EPIC<BR>
<span class="byline">May 26 01:50 AM, by <a href="mailto:jsherndon@mindspring.com">Omac Thistlehunter</a></span></H4>
<p>     Would like to congratulate Luxar on obtaining his Fiery Defender.  Little bit about Luxar, its hard to describe the guy.  He's a Paladin in every sense of the word.  I can't think of many that deserves to have completed this more than he.  Seekers of Lore congratulates him and I make that a personal congratulation as well.  Luxar has been the rock of every raid we've been on, and I couldn?t be happier.  Saying Congratulations doesn't really put it into words but there really aren't words to tell the rest of the server just how proud we are to see him wielding that blade.  I do promise we'll put it to good use and wont let him get it rusty.  Here's to you big guy, were all mighty proud of ya
