<H4>Lost Souls of Glaznor - Three Year Anniversary<BR>
<span class="byline">August 09 11:38 AM, by <a href="mailto:utrellien@glaznor.org">Utrellien Pentragon</a></span></H4>
<p>Siglo said it best in words once. <i>"A bunch of friends who accidentally levelled"</i>. 
<p>
For three years now the Souls have striven thru the land. No adventure too big and no friend left behind. I can surely say that I am very proud what we have created together. Not another ueber guild nor another nice guild without power. We managed to retain our good spirit and grew to face bigger Adventures. 
<p>
If three years ago someone would have asked me what the Souls should be one day I would have answered "A strong and nice guild". I would never even have believed what more they can be. We might not be as strong as a guild who can clear North ToV but instead we surely are the strongest when it comes to the binding between us :) And that is all that ever matters! 
<p>
I thank you all for the last three years. I thank you for the wonderful time we have had together and the great friendship. I thank you that you never got mad at me for leading in the wrong direction or producing yet another mass wipeout :) I hope that this will always be and that I one day can say to the son of my daughter "I play this damn old game because it is not just pixels. Those are my friends" :) 
<p>
Over the time the Souls and me also made alot of friends out there in Norrath and worked together with respected guilds. To all of you a huge thank you as well. It was and will always be a pleasure to work with you together for whatever goal we may want to go after.
<p>
Lets see what the next years will bring us :)
