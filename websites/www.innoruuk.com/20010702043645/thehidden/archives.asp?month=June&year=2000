							I've gotten word from Ansuz, leader of the Shadow Stalkers of Norrath, that they are planning an invasion of Kaesora on the 17th of June at 3pm EDT and that Crimson Dragons are invited to attend. According to early scouting the dungeon is level 30 - 40 and should be good fun. I don't know how safe this would be for lower members becuase of the relativly high level mobs but it should be fun for those who attend! I will post up any more details as they become available and hopefully some us will be able to attend for and have a good time!I've gotten word from Ansuz, leader of the Shadow Stalkers of Norrath, that they are planning an invasion of Kaesora on the 17th of June at 3pm EDT and that Crimson Dragons are invited to attend.
