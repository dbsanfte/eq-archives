Two spdats were sourced from the Phase4 and Vanilla CD .iso's on Archive.org, I gave them their file modified dates as names:

- spdat-phase4-beta-cd.26.01.1999.eff
- spdat.original-retail-cd.16.02.1999.eff

One spdat from May 1999 was found on the Newsgroups, given in text format with spell names only:

- spdat.20.05.1999.eff.txt

One spdat was sourced from Project 1999 and it corresponds to the spdat.eff on the Kunark CD:

- spdat.14.03.2000.eff

The rest were sourced from a wayback_machine_downloader dump of the various EQPatch.zip files on www.everquest.com.tw, you can find those archives here, along with links to the original Wayback Machine source links:

https://github.com/dbsanfte/eq-archives/tree/master/eq-patches

I have renamed each spdat to its patch date for convenience.

If you need a program to read these, EQCaster should work. I have added two EXEs here, a latest version and an older version. The web archive link is the following if you want it:

NEW 02/12/2020:
EQCaster has a csv export function, so I extracted all the spdats to CSVs and merged them into a single .xlsx sheet with a new column for SPDAT date. This allows for checking differences between patches much more easily. I included some example differences between Kunark Beta (March 2000) and Kunark Launch (April 2000) as an example (and to help P99).
