Just use those prices as a guideline though. If someone<br/>\nis nice and polite, knock off a little. If they are rude and demanding,<br/>\ndon&#39;t budge an inch.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note: Do NOT make any enchanted jewelry unless you have a buyer<br/>\nfor it. People not following that simple guideline are largely responsible<br/>\nfor the plummeting prices. (I.E., Tradesman makes 10 +2 int rings. Sells 2<br/>\nright off the bat for 8p each. 2 hours later he still has 8 rings. He drops<br/>\nhis price to 7p each. No takers. An hour later, frustrated and just wanting<br/>\nto unload the things he drops his price to 5p each. Sells 4 of em. Still has<br/>\n4. Does a special auction at 3p each to free up his inventory slots. Now<br/>\nEVERYONE expects those +2 int rings to sell for 3p. Get the picture?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry... kinda ranted a little there...<br/>\n<br/>\nQinie Isil&#39;Goren<br/>\nHigh Elf Enchantress<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:duffjc@...\">duffjc@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:duffjc@...\">duffjc@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, August 05, 1999 12:57 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqenchanters] Jewelery<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:duffjc@...\">duffjc@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have searched back a couple digests, and haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; found an answer and figured this would be quicker.<br/>\n&gt; I am an Enchanter on the Karana server, and have<br/>\n&gt; a Jewelery skill lvl of about 41.  I have been <br/>\n&gt; making enchanted jeweler for a while, but don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; really have a firm grasp on what kind of base <br/>\n&gt; prices I should be charging.  Here is a list of <br/>\n&gt; prices I am charging now.  Could I get some<br/>\n&gt; feedback on what others are charging, and maybe<br/>\n&gt; set up a Merchants Co-operative to set prices for<br/>\n&gt; our market on Karana.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; +2 Agility rings 3pp<br/>\n&gt; +2 Dexterity Braclets 4pp<br/>\n&gt; +2 int rings 5pp<br/>\n&gt; +2 strength rings 6pp<br/>\n&gt; Jaded Silver rings 7pp<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I usually give up to 1pp off if someone buys 2 at<br/>\n&gt; a time.  Just wondering what the rest of you sell<br/>\n&gt; for.  I don&#39;t want to undercut the market, but <br/>\n&gt; then again I Don&#39;t want to sell to high.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think if we set up a Jewelery Co-operative we <br/>\n&gt; may be able to set higher prices for our wares.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sinth the Enchanter<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE ideas, and <br/>\n&gt; CONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
