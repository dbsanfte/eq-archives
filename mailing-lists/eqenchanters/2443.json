In the spell descriptions at<br/>\nEQ.castersrealm.com, the Mezmorize line is mentioned as having a good chance<br/>\nof wiping the hate list only if you are outside the MOB&#39;s agresso range when<br/>\nthe spell wears off.  Enthrall when resisted will also put you at or near<br/>\nthe top of the MOB&#39;s hate list, while an inneffective Memory Blur doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to have this taunt factor. At 37, you are using Entrance over Enthrall,<br/>\nright? And if not, what have you encountered that makes the difference?<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi ~Hand of Chaos~, CT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 2<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 07 Mar 2000 09:41:19 -0800<br/>\n   From: &quot;Douglas S.

I on the other hand use Enthrall.  It not only<br/>\nwipes<br/>\nthe hate list but also stuns the MOB in it&#39;s tracks and interrupts casting.<br/>\nI<br/>\nuse this daily and it has saved myself, and my groups cleric countless<br/>\ntimes.<br/>\nSort of a Swiss Army Knife of a spell.
