I have been \r<br/>\nmaking enchanted jeweler for a while, but don&#39;t \r<br/>\nreally have a firm grasp on what kind of base \r<br/>\nprices I should be charging.  Here is a list of \r<br/>\nprices I am charging now.  Could I get some\r<br/>\nfeedback on what others are charging, and maybe\r<br/>\nset up a Merchants Co-operative to set prices for\r<br/>\nour market on Karana.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n+2 Agility rings 3pp\r<br/>\n+2 Dexterity Braclets 4pp\r<br/>\n+2 int rings 5pp\r<br/>\n+2 strength rings 6pp\r<br/>\nJaded Silver rings 7pp\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI usually give up to 1pp off if someone buys 2 at\r<br/>\na time.  Just wondering what the rest of you sell\r<br/>\nfor.  I don&#39;t want to undercut the market, but \r<br/>\nthen again I Don&#39;t want to sell to high.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI think if we set up a Jewelery Co-operative we \r<br/>\nmay be able to set higher prices for our wares.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSinth the Enchanter</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
