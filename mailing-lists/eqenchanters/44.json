The loot is better I think which is important for<br/>\nsaving money for your upper level spells.  Neriak, the dark elf city is<br/>\nthe other place I&#39;ve started a character and know well.  It is a long<br/>\nwalk in (three zones - forest to foriegn to commons to 3rd gate) to get<br/>\nto the inner part of the city which is sometimes too long for me.<br/>\nYou&#39;ll die at the hands of NPCs alot as a dark elf but it&#39;s sure nice<br/>\nseeing in the dark!  I&#39;m used as a scout alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nNear Felwithe:<br/>\nThe giant wasp drones are a great source of income; selling their wings<br/>\nbrings me 1 silver apiece (with 110 charisma).  Also, the orcs in this<br/>\narea are wimpy.  Orcs are a great source of weapons and cloth armor<br/>\n(which you can wear).  Weapons will sell for half a gold to more than a<br/>\ngold all the way up to almost 1 plat for a cracked staff.  Cloth armor<br/>\nsells for 1.5 to 2 gold a piece I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Greg Short [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq@...\">eq@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 19, 1999 3:28 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Help on Races<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am starting Everquest this week!
