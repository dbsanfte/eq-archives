I had<br/>\na<br/>\nrun-in with a rather unfriendly and selfish player last night in Misty,<br/>\noutside Rivervale.  Vyctor, by name, seemed to think that the Mooto<br/>\n(named<br/>\nGoblin) spawning camp was all his. ...and despite my many attempts to<br/>\ntry<br/>\nand SHARE the spawns by rotating pulls, he would not budge....not reply.<br/>\nInstead, I would try to &#39;steal&#39; a turn (after he had killed the last 2<br/>\nor<br/>\n3) and he would reply by casting Camoflage on my, thus KILLING my<br/>\nanimation.  Exploit!  I immediately petitioned.  the Guide showed up a<br/>\nfew<br/>\nminutes later....and told me he was invisible and to continue playing as<br/>\nusual.  I did.....Vyctor repeated his actions and killed my pet.  About<br/>\n1<br/>\nminute later, Meronn The Mischievious (a GM, not a Guide) appeared at<br/>\nthe<br/>\ncamp and explained that he was &#39;Exploiting&#39; and could be banned for such<br/>\nbehavior.  Vyctor was not happy....challenged me to duel (which i<br/>\ndeclined<br/>\nby ignoring) and I left.  Meanwhile, I get ridiculed for &#39;crying to a<br/>\nGM&#39;.<br/>\nBullshit!  This is an exploit...and I tried diplomatic resolution first.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo sum up, he was given a &#39;Formal warning that will be logged by<br/>\nVerant&#39;....and I left with a very bad taste in my mouth....gated home to<br/>\nRivervale and fished to cool my nerves.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow else should I have handled this?  I might have dueled for the &#39;camp<br/>\nrights&#39; but he did not offer to duel until AFTER he was warned...and at<br/>\nthat point it was mere anger, not a solution to the original problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any input.<br/>\n<br/>\nFistlebane, High Elf Enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAlways wanted to set up a book club, but can&#39;t find the time?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nCreate an online book club through ONElist.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
