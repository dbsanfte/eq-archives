I ll give my perspective:  1 handed weapons","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2032052026\">I have most of the best weaps for enchanters in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nObserver Staff, Sacrifical Dagger, and Staff of Writhing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll give my perspective:  1 handed weapons have an incredibly good bonus in<br/>\nthat you can use a shimmering orb, or glowing black sphere in your other<br/>\nhand.  Whilt generally speaking I group for my exp, I occassionally do fight<br/>\nsolo, and join in with my pet or after Ihave finished kiting it near death.<br/>\nJboots help for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Ob Staff and Sac Dagger are both good cos they have the 5 int bonus.<br/>\nThe damage is low on the dagger, but its twice as fast so itbalances out.<br/>\nOn that basis alone I would rather have the dagger than the ob staff anyday<br/>\nof the week since i have the second melee spot then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe staff of writhing is also EXCELLENT.  9 dmg 1 handed weap, speed is<br/>\ndecent too.  I dont know what level the special kicks in at, BUT the thing<br/>\nabou the special is not the damage but the 2 sec casting stun it gives.<br/>\nReally helpful later on when you are doing spell casters if one decides it<br/>\nwants to beat on you, as they sometimes do.   It&#39;s major downside is the chr<br/>\nmask.  Which makes life of the charmer suck unless you wear a star ruby veil<br/>\nwhich gives you 9 cha, or have the level 49 spell which gives you 40 cha.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall I think 1h pierce or 1h blunt is the way to go, but the ob staff is<br/>\nexcellent for the mid levels - 15 to 25.   Take yur pick, and keep all your<br/>\nweaps maxedif possible, just rotate them as they max in each level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBaelish<br/>\nThe EQE Man</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
