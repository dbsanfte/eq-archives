Eg: Disempower, Levitate, and (I<br/>\n&gt; believe) beserker<br/>\n&gt; &gt; strength can be found at the Shaman Vendors. There<br/>\n&gt; are some others<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that are found at Cleric vendors (soothe/calm) for<br/>\n&gt; one. Basically,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; look at the spell lists, and cross-reference. Some<br/>\n&gt; spells are only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; found at specific vendors in certain cities<br/>\n&gt; (erudin has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; illusion:halfling, neriak has the metal<br/>\n&gt; enchantment, Freeport has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brilliance (a lvl 44 spell BTW), etc...etc..).

I have it now, bought it in Ak&#39;Anon,<br/>\nvery useful spell btw, not many people really understand it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does two things, stuns a mob for about 30 seconds or until it takes<br/>\nDAMAGE, very important there as you can still debuff the mob without<br/>\ntaking off the stun effect. Secondly, and most importantly, it ERASES a<br/>\nmobs hate list at the moment its cast. Think about it.<br/>\nI use it for soloing yellows all the time.<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
