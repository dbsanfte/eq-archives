If the best you can<br/>\ndo is flame, you probably had nothing worthwhile to say to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been playing online games since &#39;89, and I believe a part of our lag is<br/>\ndue to having entire databases stored locally. We can debate data structures<br/>\nand use of algorithms to our hearts content, but I still believe it is a<br/>\ncause. It is possible to design a system that allows you to store data on a<br/>\nserver (to help avoid hacks) and still allow you to play any one of your<br/>\ncharacters on any server. Think about it. There would be allot of benefits.<br/>\nI still maintain having a character permanently tied to a specific server is<br/>\na serious design flaw in EQ. A flaw easily avoidable by anyone who wants to<br/>\ncompete with EQ. I still hope Verant allows us to transfer characters<br/>\nbetween servers in the future, even if it involves a fee. Otherwise, we have<br/>\nno intention of renewing our EQ subscriptions once something else becomes<br/>\navailable.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if someone wants to flame me further, I suggest:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Use English. Maybe discover the wonders of paragraph structure and make<br/>\nan attempt at grammar.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Try to present a clear, concise logical rebuttal.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Have the guts to sign your flame.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho knows, if these suggestions had been followed, the post might have been<br/>\nworth reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nManny<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Core Leader [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coreleader@...\">coreleader@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 6:32 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] My 2 cents on the status of EQ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Core Leader&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coreleader@...\">coreleader@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSwitching characters between servers is the stupidest idea anyone ever<br/>\nthought of... how are you ever going to be able to contact friends you made<br/>\non one server? Of course YOU live near all your friends and can call them up<br/>\nsaying let&#39;s all go to this server but everyone doesn&#39;t have that option...<br/>\nDO THEY? Think about it from a programming point of view, the transfering of<br/>\ncharacters would leave many many loopholes and whereas a program similar to<br/>\nuoextreme could jump in and give you 1000000 platium... hmm... You didn&#39;t<br/>\nthink things through did you? Okay, you still don&#39;t agree so here goes some<br/>\nmore... A new server comes up and everyone playing it is a newbie then all<br/>\nthe sudden verant let&#39;s us do this stupid server switching crap and<br/>\nblacksmiths go over there selling everything at 5 times the cost they could<br/>\nget on an established server. This would also let high level parties go to a<br/>\nnew server and camp all the huge monsters... Emporer Crush for example?<br/>\nLet&#39;s look a bit deeper... How would a guild be able to keep in contact?<br/>\nTalking between servers would cause ungodly 24 hour 7 days a week 365 days a<br/>\nyear LAG!!!!! Not to mention the constant character switching would cause<br/>\nmore lag therefore screwing up your playing anyways... So basically pick<br/>\nyour server and STICK TO IT!!!! Why are people always wanting to move? When<br/>\nI first started playing I picked the server with the least amouth of people<br/>\non it... Bertoxx, and it still remains towards the bottom of the server list<br/>\nand even if it had 2000 people playing all the time I would not switch<br/>\nbecause all my friends on that server... so thank you and sorry if it<br/>\nsounded like a flame because it was suppose to sound worse than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
