Something HAS to be done<br/>\nabout the farming that goes on.  Too many guilds and assholes sit around<br/>\ncamping GREEN MOBs so that they can get yet another item to sell at<br/>\nexorbitant prices.  In my opinion, the new code is EXCELLENT and just what<br/>\nis needed.  Why do you have to get that 2nd item &quot;just in case?&quot;  Go get it<br/>\nagain or buy it when you NEED it, not &quot;just in case.&quot;  There are too many<br/>\ncampers for &quot;just in case&quot; scenarios.  I say that the new patch is exactly<br/>\nwhat is needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nDjar Lightbringer(Tarew Marr Server)<br/>\nServant of Light, Deliverer of the Truth to Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Scott Murph&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smurphy@...\">smurphy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First I need Brad McQuaid&#39;s E-mail address, if you have it,<br/>\n&gt; please post it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not one to start a campaign and have never tried so, as they<br/>\n&gt; say this is<br/>\n&gt; a first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how many of you keep up with changes that are<br/>\n&gt; getting ready to<br/>\n&gt; be made to the game, most are great and well needed, but one has<br/>\n&gt; me a little<br/>\n&gt; worried.  Its the change to help control the Camping in the game.<br/>\n&gt;  Now don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get me wrong this need to be looked at and fixed and I think they<br/>\n&gt; are on the<br/>\n&gt; right path, but I have one big issue with it... read what he has to say at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqss.stratics.com/\">http://eqss.stratics.com/</a> June 3rd.  Go to the 2nd set of red text titled<br/>\n&gt; Anti-Camping Update from Verant and come back here to hear what I have to<br/>\n&gt; say.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; O.K. So now you have read it.  I&#39;m sure you have you own idea how this is<br/>\n&gt; going to affect you, but here is my issue with this. Limiting it<br/>\n&gt; to one item<br/>\n&gt; is bad in this way, I am not a camper that sits for hours to get<br/>\n&gt; an item to<br/>\n&gt; sell, I hunt to get my item and stay so my group gets what they came for<br/>\n&gt; too.  Because these items are hard as hell to get ( had to sit 3<br/>\n&gt; days to get<br/>\n&gt; a Blood Stained tunic) if I happen to see another for sell, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; going to buy<br/>\n&gt; it so I can have a spare.  Why do you need a spare, you ask?<br/>\n&gt; Simple. Bodies<br/>\n&gt; still vanish and Varent HATES (taking 4 days and massive mailing<br/>\n&gt; to get) to<br/>\n&gt; restore bodies from backup tape. Bodies still vanish for no good<br/>\n&gt; reason and<br/>\n&gt; they want to give 25th and higher level people crap replacement<br/>\n&gt; kits.  There<br/>\n&gt; are legitimate ways to  loose your body too.  Deep lava pits to name one.<br/>\n&gt; We should be allowed to keep a spare of some thing in the bank if we wish.<br/>\n&gt; Brad&#39;s plan would be great if it allowed you to have two of the<br/>\n&gt; item and no<br/>\n&gt; more until you sold or lost one of them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Help me show him that two is the way to go with this.  Camping by super<br/>\n&gt; powerful people so they can sell tons of these items because there is a<br/>\n&gt; false supply and demand needs to be dealt with... allowing us to<br/>\n&gt; have two of<br/>\n&gt; a lore item will be just as good as allowing only one in this matter. But,<br/>\n&gt; allowing two will help protect you from spending hours if not<br/>\n&gt; days replacing<br/>\n&gt; item when lost.  That item could be as close as the bank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any feedback would be gladly accepted, but please post it, do not send<br/>\n&gt; directly to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I thank you in advance for your help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Scott<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For the great changes coming soon check out<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/\">http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/</a> Test server link.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
