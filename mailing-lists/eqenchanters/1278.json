I guess I will open up by stating what I was selling things for<br/>\nlast night, and then all of you can comment as to whether it was too high or<br/>\ntoo low, and we will work from there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAll +2 silver stat boosters : 7p each or 2 for 13p<br/>\n\tJade silver rings : 9p each or 2 for 17p<br/>\n\tJade electrum bracers : 25p each or 2 for 45p<br/>\n<br/>\nThis being only the 2nd day after the patch, I haven&#39;t tried marketing much<br/>\nof the electrum items other than the obvious seller, which is the jade<br/>\nbracer. With a skill of 79 I still get failures with electrum, and I am<br/>\ntrying to repay the guild for the money they pumped into me to raise my<br/>\nskill. Please add to this list and comment on prices!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
