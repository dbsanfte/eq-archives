After saving a<br/>\n&gt; druid a couple of times from trains I asked him to SOW and skin me, just<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; make sure I would be able to make it out if I tried to help and it went<br/>\n&gt; badly.  He said just let me know when it runs out and he&#39;d be back to<br/>\n&gt; recast it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;m sitting here in Unrest, messing trains, helping those lower levels<br/>\n&gt; groups that manage to snag one or two from a train kill it, etc.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; getting sick of zoning all the time, so I decide to try something else.  A<br/>\n&gt; huge train comes out  (there were all of 24 people in unrest at that time)<br/>\n&gt; all from the first and second floor, guessing around 20 MOBs.  There are 2<br/>\n&gt; groups that are fighting ghouls and mummies already, and I know that they<br/>\n&gt; are going to have to zone FAST.  So, I AOE Mes, only got about half of<br/>\n&gt; them.  Look for a high blue that didn&#39;t get messed- Barbed Bones is even,<br/>\n&gt; oh well, here goes nothing.  Tashani then Beguile the Barbed, sick it on a<br/>\n&gt; monk that&#39;s beating up on a cleric.  Languid Pace and Choke the monk<br/>\n&gt; (still<br/>\n&gt; need to research ?tepid? deeds- or whatever the name of the 24 spell is).<br/>\n&gt; Enthrall a couple CGs that didn&#39;t get messed, then AOE the other side of<br/>\n&gt; the walkway as they are about to come loose.  Only 2 resists that I see on<br/>\n&gt; the mass of MOBs, looks like they are both engaged.  Sit down to med.<br/>\n&gt; Check pet.  Pet&#39;s about 1/2 health.  Check Pet&#39;s target.  Pet has no<br/>\n&gt; target<br/>\n&gt; (after scrolling back up I missed the exp message in the Mes spam).  Stand<br/>\n&gt; up and sick pet on a CG that&#39;s loose.  Look around at the carnage going on<br/>\n&gt; around me, looks good &lt;grin&gt;.  CG running away (you get to hear their<br/>\n&gt; whines getting fainter) so I throw a Choke on him to speed things up.<br/>\n&gt; *exp*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sick pet on an newly arrived Monk that&#39;s beating up on a little dwarven<br/>\n&gt; paladin.  Barbed isn&#39;t taunting off the paladin, so Tashani, Choke....<br/>\n&gt; There we go, on me now.  Colour Flux.  Run to the other side of the<br/>\n&gt; battle.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Look around at the battle- throw another AOE mes.  Sit to med.  Check on<br/>\n&gt; pet.  Pet&#39;s health about 25%, Check Monk&#39;s health, monk at about 75.<br/>\n&gt; Charm<br/>\n&gt; breaks.  Colour Shift.  Enthrall my ex-pet.  Tashani Monk - Colour Flux -<br/>\n&gt; Beguile Monk.  /Pet kill on mummy.  Look around- almost everything is<br/>\n&gt; dead.<br/>\n&gt; Plop down to med.  Monk kills barbed.  Monk at almost no life.  Change<br/>\n&gt; spells to invis and nuke.  Stand up to see another couple of dark bones<br/>\n&gt; coming in now- I&#39;m getting way low on mana....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Charm breaks, C Flux, enthrall.  Beguile a dark boned skellie, sick it on<br/>\n&gt; the Monk.  Sit and med.  Monk dies.  *exp*  Other dark boned skellie<br/>\n&gt; killed<br/>\n&gt; by the other group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /say anyone want this Dark Bones?  He&#39;s not going to like me very much<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; he breaks charm.<br/>\n&gt; -a couple of people say &quot;yes&quot; &quot;we want him&quot; &quot;bring him on&quot; etc.<br/>\n&gt; /say let me med a little before I break charm<br/>\n&gt; /say Can I get a little heal?  Train stopping takes a lot out of me.<br/>\n&gt; /say Did everyone live there ?  Everyone get a couple of kills?<br/>\n&gt; Adriania begins to cast a spell<br/>\n&gt; Bonky begins to cast a spell<br/>\n&gt; -responses like &quot;that was a lot of fun&quot;  &quot;yes, we killed 4 I think&quot;  &quot;we<br/>\n&gt; got 3&quot; &quot;I thought I was a gonner&quot;  &quot;nice exp from that&quot;<br/>\n&gt; You feel better<br/>\n&gt; You feel much better<br/>\n&gt; You feel much better<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I med to about 3/4 of a bub of mana.  &quot;Ok,&quot; I say, &quot;invising.  Get ready.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Invis, Colous Flux, Colour Shift- take a couple of shots from the dark<br/>\n&gt; boned, but he mostly misses all together.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; someone says &quot;Did you get any kills there Allurreena?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; /say a couple.  Let me check.<br/>\n&gt; I scroll back up the list and find 6 exp messages!<br/>\n&gt; Excitedly I check my exp bar- WOW!  (I couldn&#39;t remember how much I had<br/>\n&gt; before it started but I&#39;m guessing that I made over a bubble in that one<br/>\n&gt; fight).<br/>\n&gt; /say Yep, I got a few there too.  Man that barbed was a good pet.  I think<br/>\n&gt; he killed a few of them with just his damage shield.<br/>\n&gt; Bonky says, &quot;Fine work again fair maiden.  Who are the lucky that you are<br/>\n&gt; grouped with today, M&#39;Lady&quot;  (he&#39;s a little dwarven cleric who role-plays<br/>\n&gt; the humble, dirty dwarven servant of Brell pretty well.  He cracks me up<br/>\n&gt; whenever I&#39;ve grouped with me).<br/>\n&gt; /say Not grouped right now.  Bonky, have you taken a bath lately?<br/>\n&gt; Bonky winces<br/>\n&gt; At this point everyone is silent for a couple of seconds (I think stunned<br/>\n&gt; hehe).  Then someone says, &quot;I got a little less than a 1/2 bubble from the<br/>\n&gt; 4 kills we got.  How much did you get Allur?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Bonky smelly himself<br/>\n&gt; /say Call me Allu, I don&#39;t like that R.  hehe  I got, oh, little more than<br/>\n&gt; a bub I think- can&#39;t remember how much I started off with.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;shocked silence fills unrest&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Things shouts &quot;Allureenna is the best enchanter in the game.  She<br/>\n&gt; rocks!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; /shout hehe Thanks Things, but I think that that would be Goldius, Hika,<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; Milexplux too close to call there.  Followed very closely by Anastia or<br/>\n&gt; Annelisa.<br/>\n&gt; Now Things is a funny little guy.  He&#39;s a Halfling Rogue who likes to<br/>\n&gt; emote<br/>\n&gt; things like:<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Things don&#39;t seem to be as they should be.&quot;   (/em: don&#39;t seem to be as<br/>\n&gt; they should be) and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Things seem to have changed&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s always a big cheer leader.  But the basement group starts asking what<br/>\n&gt; happened, and then I start getting all kinds of congrats and questions AND<br/>\n&gt; (you guessed it) requests for clarity!  To which I replied:<br/>\n&gt; /shout Clarity for anyone who can powerlevel me to the next circle of<br/>\n&gt; spells!  hehe- had to try.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Needless to say, it was a great day in Unrest- doubt I&#39;ll ever have a hard<br/>\n&gt; time finding a group from now on in Unrest.  Only down moment in the day<br/>\n&gt; came when we were fighting in the Tower when a Hag spawned.  About 1/2 way<br/>\n&gt; through the battle the Knight spawns, unfortunately he made a beeline for<br/>\n&gt; me and I ate a harm touch.  Couple more swings and I was dead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In this situation, I know that having the others around to engage the MOBs<br/>\n&gt; helped a lot, as did the fact that most of them had worked with one of the<br/>\n&gt; 3 or 4 enchanters around my level that are normally in the zone when I<br/>\n&gt; play.  Being fairly well twinked doesn&#39;t hurt either &lt;grin&gt;  (with buffs<br/>\n&gt; 189 Chr, 168 int, and about and extra 100 mana).  I&#39;ve also had the<br/>\n&gt; opportunity to watch some of the best on our server do their thing (when<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; cleric butt wasn&#39;t sitting down medding).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But this doesn&#39;t mean that we can&#39;t solo effectively with appropriate<br/>\n&gt; equipment for the level that we are.  I&#39;ve seen a high level enchanter<br/>\n&gt; solo<br/>\n&gt; bugs in Sol B with no problem, or rooms in Guk.  There is danger here<br/>\n&gt; though- and lots of downtime.  After all this I Illusion Tree  and went to<br/>\n&gt; the store to grab some Pepsi.  I was almost back to FM when I got back :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Allureenna the long winded!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS- Why-oh-why does Illusion Skeleton not make us able to walk around<br/>\n&gt; Unrest without being molested???<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get what you deserve with NextCard Visa!
