They had some<br/>\n&gt; Enchantment of brilliance spells which were supposed to make the item give<br/>\n&gt; off light.  I&#39;d like to see a level 8 or level 12 spell which temporarily<br/>\n&gt; makes a weapon able to hit magical creatures.  We have a damage shield<br/>\nspell<br/>\n&gt; (Feedback) so I doubt if that would be an enchantment (unless it was lower<br/>\n&gt; level).  Any old school D&D players remember the spell &quot;Permanence&quot;?  Make<br/>\n&gt; that a level 44 or 49 spell so our temporary weapon enchantments would<br/>\nlast<br/>\n&gt; forever.  It would be neat to make a sword flame temporarily and give<br/>\nextra<br/>\n&gt; damage.  I wonder if we&#39;d have to hold the weapon as we cast the spell.<br/>\nAll<br/>\n&gt; we know now is that it will be done, but I honestly have no clue what will<br/>\n&gt; actually be implemented.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Krye<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
