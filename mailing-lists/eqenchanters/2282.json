Most people<br/>\nclaim that wisdom is the key, although recent articles<br/>\nmay have suggested dex is involved.  I am a jeweler<br/>\nwith max skill and I practice at 191wis and 180int.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as costs go,1000p should get you up to 100<br/>\nskill.  The jump from electrum to gold (117-142 or so)<br/>\nwill cost you a couple thousand more.  Maxing your<br/>\nskill at 200 is likely to cost 50,000 or more.  Lots<br/>\nof fun.  As long as you are charging reasonable rates<br/>\nfor your product, you will be able to pay for your<br/>\npractice out of your profits.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuentin<br/>\n<br/>\n--- James &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My bace cha is 79 and int of 130 with items its 108<br/>\n&gt; cha and 183 int.
