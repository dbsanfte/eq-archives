They can&#39;t take much damage so you need<br/>\n&gt; to watch them closely.  One of the best things about being an Enchanter is<br/>\n&gt; that you have many options.  This is one such option at level 4:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Start with Tashan from a distance and follow ASAP with Suffocating Sphere<br/>\n&gt; before the critter reaches you (you can usually get both spells off if you<br/>\n&gt; are far enough away).    The critter should be on you and your animation<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; the critter, so back off a bit and let your pet tank.  Next debuf the<br/>\n&gt; critter futher with Enfeeblement (this strength debuf along with the DOT<br/>\n&gt; strength debuf will lower the average total damage the critter will do).<br/>\n&gt; Now just wait (med if you want to) and watch your animation&#39;s health...<br/>\ntank<br/>\n&gt; for it when needed.  When the critter is  almost dead cast your DOT again<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; finish it off (or if your Evocation is high enough use your DD).  I&#39;m<br/>\nmaking<br/>\n&gt; the assumtion you&#39;ve already buffed yourself and your Animation before<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another option in a safe area is to follow the same line except cast fear<br/>\n&gt; when you&#39;re done debuffing... the pet will follow and hit the critter<br/>\nwhile<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s running away.
