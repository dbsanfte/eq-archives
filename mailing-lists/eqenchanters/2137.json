I was lucky enough to find a crude stein for sale on a<br/>\n&gt; merchant in Feerot, only cost me 7pp and some change.  It&#39;s not for sale there<br/>\n&gt; anymore.  I&#39;ve heard the only way you&#39;re supposed to be able to get one is<br/>\n&gt; through a quest.  Does anyone know what quest gives the crude stein?  I see<br/>\n&gt; people auctioning them occasionally for 30 to 70pp.  I could use the money, so I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t mind running the quest to get another one.  (too bad they&#39;re lore and<br/>\n&gt; can only be held in the secondary hand.  There&#39;s been times that carrying 2 of<br/>\n&gt; them would have come in very handy.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Spoiler Below<br/>\n |<br/>\n |<br/>\n |<br/>\n |<br/>\n |<br/>\n |<br/>\n |<br/>\n |<br/>\n |<br/>\n |<br/>\n |<br/>\n&#92;/<br/>\n<br/>\nCrude Stiens are plain old loot items from Ogre Bouncers.
