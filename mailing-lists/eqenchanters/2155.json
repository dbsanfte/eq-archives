It is no longer a &quot;Run Away&quot;<br/>\nFear spell - instead the targeted creature will cower in terror until it<br/>\ntakes damage (similar to the Enchanter&#39;s Mesmerize spell). The Environment<br/>\nlimit (Dungeons only) has been removed. <br/>\nPact of Shadow (Necromancer) now has a 12 second recast time <br/>\nSummon Waterstone (Magician) has been added to the game. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AngieEQ@...\">AngieEQ@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AngieEQ@...\">AngieEQ@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 12:53 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] down time<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AngieEQ@...\">AngieEQ@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there a scheduled down time today?
