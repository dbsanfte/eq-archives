I think<br/>\nit is you who miss the point.  I was one of the earlier enchanters because<br/>\nthe class sounded so like what I wanted in the manual.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier, there were no animations, and they were all in HK.  No problem.  We<br/>\nadapted.<br/>\nOkay, we got animations, now suddenly resists mysteriously become worse.<br/>\nOkay, again we adapted, and waited four our promised Tashan upgrade.  We get<br/>\nour Tashini, but wait, our most valuable spell is suddenly made worthless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this has nothing to do with powergaming level mongering.  Add in the<br/>\nfact we need to be agnostic or illusions are worthless, stupid quirks with<br/>\nminor illusions, and the utter complete lack of any viable enchanting, and<br/>\nyou discover why people are quitting the class in droves.  I&#39;m glad you like<br/>\nit, but most of us are not into such masochism.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: DeGirolami, Franck [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:degirolami@...\">degirolami@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 20, 1999 1:02 PM<br/>\nTo: Eqenchanters (E-mail)<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] What&#39;s wrong with you people?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;DeGirolami, Franck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:degirolami@...\">degirolami@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a level 16 dark elf necro that I started on the first day of the<br/>\nrelease. It took me 4 &#39;played&#39; days and a half to get it to level 16. then I<br/>\ngave it up. I have now a level 16 enchanter. It took me 12 &#39;played&#39; days to<br/>\nmake it to 16... You think that&#39;s a problem for me? I had so much more fun<br/>\nplaying an enchanter. What&#39;s the deal with this level race? Sometimes I&#39;ll<br/>\nspend an hour travelling back and forth just to say hi to a friend I havent<br/>\nseen for a long time. Right now, I&#39;m hunting in CrushBone and I barely make<br/>\nany xp where I could be soloing in Lavastorm and make a shit load of xp and<br/>\nmoney..but what&#39;s the big deal? I enjoy playing Everquest a lot more now.<br/>\nPowergaming is so boring. So are those people who start a race everytime  a<br/>\nnew server comes up.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy 2 cents,<br/>\nSkara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
