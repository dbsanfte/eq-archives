I highly recommend you be careful selling and crafting items.  Magical items crafted under the new patch WILL vanish if you enter certain zones.  Qnos is one of these areas, I have no doubt there are others.  Craft at your own risk, and I do advise you notify everyone you sell to to be careful where they go.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthis is disturbing news, and perhaps a flaw? or not true, has anyone experienced this problem? or know anything about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Aeramus 16th Enchanter on Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
