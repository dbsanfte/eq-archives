A while later like 4 various gnolls came running back and<br/>\nattacked me which my group promptly smited.  Thank goodness for groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I know to root the thing before it starts running.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question I have is what if the pet I have gets hurt and starts running?<br/>\nActually, would the pet even do that?  If so, would a train start?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a tad bit off topic.  I got a bronze long sword.  Just wondering what<br/>\nI can auction one off for (if its even worth trying to auction off that is)<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nAzboklin the enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nScott Murawski                              <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott.murawski@...\">scott.murawski@...</a><br/>\nApplications Speech Engineer                          (voice) 212-425-7600 <br/>\nSpeechWorks Intl, Inc.
