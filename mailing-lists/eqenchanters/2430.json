It not only wipes<br/>\nthe hate list but also stuns the MOB in it&#39;s tracks and interrupts casting.  I<br/>\nuse this daily and it has saved myself, and my groups cleric countless times.<br/>\nSort of a Swiss Army Knife of a spell. I feel that this is the single most<br/>\nimportant spell in my lineup.  Here&#39;s my Usual lineup:  Invis (for breaking<br/>\ncharm),Rune III, Tashani, Tepid Deeds, Insipid Weakness, Enthrall, Beguile, and<br/>\nClarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any input on the use of Enthrall?<br/>\n<br/>\nHorchata Sabrosa &lt;Art of War&gt;<br/>\nLvl 37 Enchantress<br/>\nBrell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew Collins wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Andrew Collins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ACollins@...\">ACollins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Memory Blur is amazing. I too keep it on hand at all times, Ive even been<br/>\n&gt; able to memblur a sand giant while it was hitting and watched him forget who<br/>\n&gt; I was and start waltzing the other direction... whew.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I use it all the time while invising to places that see thru invis, running<br/>\n&gt; thru lower guk, urd shaman sees me breaks invis and starts beating on me.<br/>\n&gt; Mes...Memblur, memblur again, continue on way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Memblur does not always work %100. It works the same way as the monk feign I<br/>\n&gt; believe. 35 mobs and under works all the time, above that has some chance of<br/>\n&gt; resistability. Ive thought about replacing it with reocc amnesia, but the<br/>\n&gt; recast on that is horrendous.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Remember that these spells are aggro spells if they are resisted, so if you<br/>\n&gt; ae mindwipe a group, dont think they wont come after you. We had an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter try to attempt this in Hateplane, only to find he was beat to a<br/>\n&gt; pulp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Memblur also saves the enchanter, when tashania/tepid deeds at the beginning<br/>\n&gt; mobs get really angry and unless you have an incredible taunter theyll come<br/>\n&gt; for you. Memblur and they will go back to the tank. Also while fighting<br/>\n&gt; multiples I always mes/tashania/tepid deeds, then cast memblur a few times<br/>\n&gt; on the mob and hell usually never come after you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Even if you keep a mob mes&#39;d for a long time cause the battle has gone a<br/>\n&gt; long time, youll be up on his &quot;to kill&quot; list, so make sure mem blur at least<br/>\n&gt; once after a warrior hits it to break mes. This is mandatory in places like<br/>\n&gt; Hateplane and Fearplane, and helps a lot in lower guk as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Maelael, 50th Enchanter, Veeshan.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Im looking into that stun breaking mes thing, I did a test and it seemed<br/>\n&gt; like it didnt break it, but i could swear Ive broken it before with stuns in<br/>\n&gt; L Guk.<br/>\n&gt; Ill keep tryin.<br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ___<br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; MAXIMIZE YOUR CARD, MINIMIZE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
