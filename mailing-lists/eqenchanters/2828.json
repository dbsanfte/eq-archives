Phebos based upon the phrase Phoebos(sic) meaning fear.  I<br/>\nthought it appropriate that my little gnome  would be named after the Roman god<br/>\nof fear, for that is how she kills things by playing with their minds and making<br/>\nall fear her ;)  As for the dreamweaver last name, in european tradition my last<br/>\nname is that of my trade.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;(Uthanatos)&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I asked myself a question last night that I hope all of you will reply to<br/>\n&gt; when I ask it of you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why did you choose the name of your character? What does it mean to you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, so that is 2 questions, shoot me. =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This thought entered my mind as I sat last night trying to come up with a<br/>\n&gt; name for my gnome enchanter. I do not like the name generator that Verant so<br/>\n&gt; kindly provides. Answering this question(s) became the real challenge and<br/>\n&gt; gave my pixels a minor RP perspective that is truly lacking in this game. I<br/>\n&gt; love the game, but the war for XP dominates the minds of 98.9% (&lt;~ note the<br/>\n&gt; pun?) of those that subscribe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, what follows is a breakdown of why I chose the names I did. I am<br/>\n&gt; intrigued to see the results if all of you did the same.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personal history: I have been playing RPs since 73, and picked up WhiteWolf<br/>\n&gt; as the dominant favorite since 92.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Arakine Uktena, Woodelf Druid:<br/>\n&gt; Arakine-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From the movie Dune. Arakis, desert planet. Paul says at one point &quot;We shall<br/>\n&gt; squeeze and squeeze until no Harkonin breathes Arakine air.&quot;.  The planet<br/>\n&gt; itself is a desert filled with danger, yet has the potential to become a<br/>\n&gt; lush garden paradise.<br/>\n&gt; Uktena-<br/>\n&gt; American Indian tribe, and a tribe of Werewolves from WhiteWolf&#39;s &quot;Werewolf:<br/>\n&gt; the Apocalypse!&quot;. Violent, bloody bastards that guard the spiritual foci and<br/>\n&gt; are the closest to the Spirits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Uthanatos, Gnome Enchanter:<br/>\n&gt; No last name yet, but I will have a while before I need to worry about it.<br/>\n&gt; ;-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From WhiteWolf&#39;s &quot;Mage: the Ascension&quot;, Euthantos.  A Tradition of mages<br/>\n&gt; that believe death should come to all. They are to help others to meet Death<br/>\n&gt; when they try to avoid it and have nothing left to give, or to preserve Life<br/>\n&gt; when their existence still has something to contribute to those around them.<br/>\n&gt; Also called Death Mages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This may apply to Necromancers, but to me the Enchanter class is the true<br/>\n&gt; embodiment of the Euthanatos. They can ultimately control the outcome of<br/>\n&gt; almost any battle so that the &quot;Life&quot; of the party is preserved (by being<br/>\n&gt; competent) or they can hasten the grip of Death upon his fellows (by being<br/>\n&gt; inept).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, there you have it. One step closer into the mind of Me. Reply if you<br/>\n&gt; wish, I for one would enjoy reading it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Arakine<br/>\n&gt; Fennin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; aka<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Uthanatos<br/>\n&gt; Fennin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
