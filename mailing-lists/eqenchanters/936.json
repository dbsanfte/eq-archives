And if you think that a microsoft game is going to be better <br/>\nthan eq you keep on believe that... Asheron&#39;s call is microsofts attempt to <br/>\nmake online money, the game is horribly designed if you even bother to look <br/>\naround... And besides, you won&#39;t be able to switch servers there anyways! <br/>\nWhat&#39;s that you say? Your wrong? OMG! CAN THAT BE! YES! AE has already said <br/>\nthey are going to have ONE huge server, so stop your bitching about this <br/>\nthat and other and just play the game. Look at UO, you can&#39;t switch servers <br/>\nthere... Can you??? Hell no and people still play it, you can&#39;t switch <br/>\nservers in eq... Can you??? Hell no and people STILL play it. So if some <br/>\ngames comes along that let&#39;s you switch server PLEASE PLEEEEEAAASSSEEEEEE go <br/>\nthere so I can play in peace on MY server. If you think EQ is really worried <br/>\nabout cheap competators then maybe you should look back into the past a <br/>\nlittle bit, uo was never worried about eq coming out and when it did it <br/>\nmaybe took away 25000 from their already 300,000 players. So stop your <br/>\nwhining and play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Manuel Revilla&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manuel.revilla@...\">manuel.revilla@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] My 2 cents on the status of EQ<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 20 May 1999 07:42:49 -0400<br/>\n&gt;MIME-Version: 1.0<br/>\n&gt;From errors-161758-922-coreleader Thu May 20 05:11:23 1999<br/>\n&gt;Received: from [209.207.164.211] by hotmail.com (1.5) with SMTP id <br/>\n&gt;MHotMailB90D46EA0123D1B98326D1CFA4D33C380; Thu May 20 05:11:23 1999<br/>\n&gt;Received: (qmail 840 invoked by alias); 20 May 1999 11:44:56 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: (qmail 825 invoked from network); 20 May 1999 11:44:56 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: from unknown (HELO pimout3-int.prodigy.net) (207.115.59.211) by <br/>\n&gt;pop.onelist.com with SMTP; 20 May 1999 11:44:56 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: from fairy01 (VRHSB102-01.splitrock.net [209.156.162.1]) by <br/>\n&gt;pimout3-int.prodigy.net (8.8.5/8.8.5) with SMTP id HAA18628 for <br/>\n&gt;&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;; Thu, 20 May 1999 07:44:41 -0400<br/>\n&gt;Message-ID: &lt;001001bea2b5$e3378740$916bfea9@fairy01&gt;<br/>\n&gt;X-Priority: 3 (Normal)<br/>\n&gt;X-MSMail-Priority: Normal<br/>\n&gt;X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook 8.5, Build 4.71.2232.26<br/>\n&gt;X-Mimeole: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V5.00.2314.1300<br/>\n&gt;Importance: Normal<br/>\n&gt;In-Reply-To: &lt;000001bea256$017e63a0$916bfea9@fairy01&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mailing-List: list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>; contact <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters-owner@onelist.com\">eqenchanters-owner@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Delivered-To: mailing list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Precedence: bulk<br/>\n&gt;List-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters-unsubscribe@...\">eqenchanters-unsubscribe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Manuel Revilla&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manuel.revilla@...\">manuel.revilla@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Remember, we are trying to have a sharing of ideas here. If the best you <br/>\n&gt;can<br/>\n&gt;do is flame, you probably had nothing worthwhile to say to begin with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been playing online games since &#39;89, and I believe a part of our lag <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;due to having entire databases stored locally. We can debate data <br/>\n&gt;structures<br/>\n&gt;and use of algorithms to our hearts content, but I still believe it is a<br/>\n&gt;cause. It is possible to design a system that allows you to store data on a<br/>\n&gt;server (to help avoid hacks) and still allow you to play any one of your<br/>\n&gt;characters on any server. Think about it. There would be allot of benefits.<br/>\n&gt;I still maintain having a character permanently tied to a specific server <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;a serious design flaw in EQ. A flaw easily avoidable by anyone who wants to<br/>\n&gt;compete with EQ. I still hope Verant allows us to transfer characters<br/>\n&gt;between servers in the future, even if it involves a fee. Otherwise, we <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;no intention of renewing our EQ subscriptions once something else becomes<br/>\n&gt;available.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now if someone wants to flame me further, I suggest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) Use English. Maybe discover the wonders of paragraph structure and make<br/>\n&gt;an attempt at grammar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) Try to present a clear, concise logical rebuttal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3) Have the guts to sign your flame.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Who knows, if these suggestions had been followed, the post might have been<br/>\n&gt;worth reading.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Manny<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Core Leader [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coreleader@...\">coreleader@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 6:32 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] My 2 cents on the status of EQ<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Core Leader&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coreleader@...\">coreleader@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Switching characters between servers is the stupidest idea anyone ever<br/>\n&gt;thought of... how are you ever going to be able to contact friends you made<br/>\n&gt;on one server? Of course YOU live near all your friends and can call them <br/>\n&gt;up<br/>\n&gt;saying let&#39;s all go to this server but everyone doesn&#39;t have that option...<br/>\n&gt;DO THEY? Think about it from a programming point of view, the transfering <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;characters would leave many many loopholes and whereas a program similar to<br/>\n&gt;uoextreme could jump in and give you 1000000 platium... hmm... You didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;think things through did you? Okay, you still don&#39;t agree so here goes some<br/>\n&gt;more... A new server comes up and everyone playing it is a newbie then all<br/>\n&gt;the sudden verant let&#39;s us do this stupid server switching crap and<br/>\n&gt;blacksmiths go over there selling everything at 5 times the cost they could<br/>\n&gt;get on an established server. This would also let high level parties go to <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;new server and camp all the huge monsters... Emporer Crush for example?<br/>\n&gt;Let&#39;s look a bit deeper... How would a guild be able to keep in contact?<br/>\n&gt;Talking between servers would cause ungodly 24 hour 7 days a week 365 days <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;year LAG!!!!! Not to mention the constant character switching would cause<br/>\n&gt;more lag therefore screwing up your playing anyways... So basically pick<br/>\n&gt;your server and STICK TO IT!!!! Why are people always wanting to move? When<br/>\n&gt;I first started playing I picked the server with the least amouth of people<br/>\n&gt;on it... Bertoxx, and it still remains towards the bottom of the server <br/>\n&gt;list<br/>\n&gt;and even if it had 2000 people playing all the time I would not switch<br/>\n&gt;because all my friends on that server... so thank you and sorry if it<br/>\n&gt;sounded like a flame because it was suppose to sound worse than that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
