I agree that people","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1279860499\">Some good points made here but let me add a few of my own...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been practicing my jewel craft all the time since the patch came<br/>\nout.  I agree that people sell to cheaply.  Usually if I see someone<br/>\nselling for cheap I tell them how much I sell for and how much money I<br/>\nhave and they thank me and raise their prices.  My price list is as<br/>\nfollows:<br/>\n<br/>\nVs. jewelry with no AC                2X cost<br/>\nCat&#39;s eye &quot;Charisma&quot; Necklace           5  pp.<br/>\nBloodstone &quot;Stamina&quot; Earrings            12 pp. for two<br/>\nOnyx &quot;Dexterity&quot; Bracers                12 pp. for two<br/>\nJasper &quot;Wisdom&quot; Rings                   12 pp. for two<br/>\nCarnelian &quot;Agility&quot; Rings               12 pp. for two<br/>\nStar Rose Quartz &quot;Intelligence&quot; Rings   12 pp. for two<br/>\nAmber &quot;Strength&quot; Rings                  16 pp. for two<br/>\nJaded &quot;Mana/hp/ac&quot; Rings                15 pp. apiece<br/>\nTopaz &quot;vs disease/ac&quot; Necklace          12 pp.<br/>\nOpal &quot;Stamina/Agility&quot; Rings            40 pp. apiece<br/>\nRuby &quot;Strength/Wisdom&quot; Veil             300 pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are my prices.  I have made over 700 pp. since the patch and am<br/>\nstill going strong.  I have put about 300 pp. back into jewel crafting<br/>\nthough.  100 pp. has bought me some good equipment and the remianing 300<br/>\npp. is still in my bank account.  People will pay these prices, I have<br/>\nsold many of all listed above except Topaz Opal and Ruby.  While trying<br/>\nto sell the Ruby veil many people have told me that it usually goes for<br/>\n250 pp.  Anyone here sell it for that much? And, how do you do it?  Let&#39;s<br/>\ntake the price of Ruby. With all my charisma equipment on i have 113<br/>\ncharisma and can buy Ruby for 130 pp.  We all know it is easy to fail on<br/>\nsomething that is trivial to us so let&#39;s say i have a customer who wants<br/>\na Ruby veil.  So I go buy a Ruby for 130 pp. and I fail. Now I am<br/>\nscrewed.  IF I get lucky (or don&#39;t get unlucky) and make it the next<br/>\ntime, I still lose 10 pp.  Why would anyone risk doing this?????<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to my prices.  Here&#39;s the thing, I will accept almost any amount<br/>\ndown to 2x cost, but i don&#39;t tell the customer that.  It&#39;s all a part of<br/>\nbeing a good salesman.  If they won&#39;t pay or don&#39;t have the money to<br/>\nafford stuff at my prices I haggle with them. THAT IS how you make money.<br/>\nAnd it makes them feel special for you having taken money off the price<br/>\nfor you.  Not once has someone said to me &quot;Oh, you can sell it for<br/>\ncheaper? So you were trying to rip me off or something?&quot; They just don&#39;t<br/>\ncare. They want the item and will pay whatever you ask to get it.  Just<br/>\nmy advice, hope you all are rich someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nAarreran<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\nAd Infinitvm</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
