Did you scroll through all<br/>\nthe skills and still not find it?  It should be offerered by your<br/>\nguildmaster.  Whether it goes up through use or solely through<br/>\ntraining I do not know, but the patch message seemed to suggest<br/>\nonly by training?  I&#39;m not level 20 yet so I don&#39;t know for sure.<br/>\nHere is the example from the patch message:<br/>\n<br/>\nExample: Mildred the Magnificent (Wizard) has a 50 skill in both her<br/>\nSpecialize:<br/>\nEvocation and her Specialize: Abjuration. Mildred decides that she wants<br/>\nto be<br/>\nan Evocation specialist. She goes to her guildmaster and trains one<br/>\npoint in<br/>\nSpecialize: Evocation. She now was a 51 skill in Specialize: Evocation.<br/>\nNo other<br/>\nspecialize skill will be able to go higher than 50. <br/>\n<br/>\nKaela</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
