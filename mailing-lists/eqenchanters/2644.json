Just went <br/>\nout and bought a copy of the original game-my computer isn&#39;t smart enough <br/>\n166/32mb/4mb vid card-and I&#39;m wondering about the optional files offered <br/>\nwhen you first start up a copy of the game and click the &#39;play online&#39; <br/>\nbutton.(Not talking about the register Kunark button) I&#39;m wondering if these <br/>\nfiles are too much for my computer too handle, system spec wise, and what <br/>\nthey happen to contain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I&#39;m still going to play an Enchanter, again, even knowing how <br/>\nannoying the class can be. I can&#39;t help it, Enchanters are without a doubt <br/>\nthe iconoclastic class in the game, the enigma to many, and seeing the mana <br/>\nspeed up spells I&#39;m sure one of the most bothered classes-a&#39;la SoW-in the <br/>\ngame, which is fine with me most times because I love chatting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Since I haven&#39;t played in about a year, I&#39;ll try to start up a debate! <br/>\nWhat are the best and worst changes to the Enchanters as of late? What makes <br/>\nyou spittin mad and what makes you want to never give up the class??<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nqrentqent aka<br/>\n<br/>\nMezma Dark Elf Enchanter L3, Seventh Hammer<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
