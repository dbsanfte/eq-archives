I am on the Rathe Server<br/>\n&gt; and would be happy to assist you in obtaining your Animation.  Here is<br/>\n&gt; another Thought for you also:  You may want to use the Dark Elf illusion,<br/>\n&gt; the Orcs in CrushBone do not attack me when I am using the DE illusion so<br/>\n&gt; perhaps the Orcs in Highpass will not either..  But I would still use<br/>\n&gt; INVIS..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ll have to use invis, really.  The orcs from Crushbone are working<br/>\non an alliance with teh Dark Elves, which is why the CB orcs don&#39;t<br/>\nattack you with the DE Illusion up.  Other orcs have no qualms about<br/>\neating Dark Elves for breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nE<br/>\n-- <br/>\n&quot;Maybe I was mean<br/>\n but I really don&#39;t think so<br/>\n You asked if I&#39;m scared and I<br/>\n said so&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sinead O&#39;Connor, &quot;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
