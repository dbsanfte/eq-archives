I too keep it on hand at all times, Ive even been<br/>\nable to memblur a sand giant while it was hitting and watched him forget who<br/>\nI was and start waltzing the other direction... whew.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use it all the time while invising to places that see thru invis, running<br/>\nthru lower guk, urd shaman sees me breaks invis and starts beating on me.<br/>\nMes...Memblur, memblur again, continue on way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMemblur does not always work %100. It works the same way as the monk feign I<br/>\nbelieve. 35 mobs and under works all the time, above that has some chance of<br/>\nresistability. Ive thought about replacing it with reocc amnesia, but the<br/>\nrecast on that is horrendous.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember that these spells are aggro spells if they are resisted, so if you<br/>\nae mindwipe a group, dont think they wont come after you. We had an<br/>\nenchanter try to attempt this in Hateplane, only to find he was beat to a<br/>\npulp.<br/>\n<br/>\nMemblur also saves the enchanter, when tashania/tepid deeds at the beginning<br/>\nmobs get really angry and unless you have an incredible taunter theyll come<br/>\nfor you. Memblur and they will go back to the tank. Also while fighting<br/>\nmultiples I always mes/tashania/tepid deeds, then cast memblur a few times<br/>\non the mob and hell usually never come after you.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you keep a mob mes&#39;d for a long time cause the battle has gone a<br/>\nlong time, youll be up on his &quot;to kill&quot; list, so make sure mem blur at least<br/>\nonce after a warrior hits it to break mes. This is mandatory in places like<br/>\nHateplane and Fearplane, and helps a lot in lower guk as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Maelael, 50th Enchanter, Veeshan.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm looking into that stun breaking mes thing, I did a test and it seemed<br/>\nlike it didnt break it, but i could swear Ive broken it before with stuns in<br/>\nL Guk.<br/>\nIll keep tryin.<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
