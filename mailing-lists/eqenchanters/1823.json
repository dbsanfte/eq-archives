As of now, my skill is not<br/>\n&gt; that high, and I can only make enchanted topaz<br/>\n&gt; necklaces.  After examining some charts on<br/>\n&gt; jewellery, i have found that Wolf&#39;s Eye Agate will<br/>\n&gt; indeed make an item that will help you versus<br/>\n&gt; magic, when combined with silver.  Would anyone<br/>\n&gt; happen to know where a tradesman such as I could<br/>\n&gt; purchase, or find, some of this stone.  I have<br/>\n&gt; not been successful in locating it in Erudin or<br/>\n&gt; in Qeynos as of yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any help in this matter would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sinth the Enchanter<br/>\n&gt; lvl 9<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
