My vision of<br/>\ngreens not providing special items ocurrs at the point someone loots not<br/>\nat the MOB&#39;s death.  That is, if a 2 member group kills a monster the<br/>\nlower member who gained experience should be the one who loots to get<br/>\nthe special item.  So this already would be a bit of a loophole now that<br/>\nI think about it.  Oh well, still better than now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need to kill greens to get items after you die and are trying to<br/>\nget to your corpse that&#39;s ok to get a little weapon or something I<br/>\nthink.  Only big items should get the treatment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m driving at is give people who should be hunting that level of<br/>\nMOBs the chance.  Why should godlike characters hang out at ridiculously<br/>\neasy locations (for them) just because that&#39;s where the cool items<br/>\nspawn?  If you want to help out a buddy that&#39;s cool, let your buddy loot<br/>\nthe item, now he has one of that item, and off you go to new hunting<br/>\ngrounds.  Currently we have groups parked at whatever place gives the<br/>\nmost lucrative loot and they take kill after kill (I.E. the wizards<br/>\nmentioned earlier in another post on this thread) for the express<br/>\npurpose of building cash.  Get out and see the world, find a spot more<br/>\nappropriate to your level, and give fledgling characters the same chance<br/>\nyou had to hunt those area and get meaningful experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this sort of comes down to how you play the game.  For some, it&#39;s<br/>\na game to kill kill kill and that&#39;s great for those people.  Others it&#39;s<br/>\nsomething else, different for each player.  But wherever the different<br/>\nplay styles cross over we have an issue like this one that people<br/>\ndisagree on.  We all need money and neat items, low characters and high.<br/>\nNo right answer here, just some thoughts on how this could be helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for discussion,<br/>\nShawn<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: HiFi Review [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hifireview@...\">hifireview@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 07, 1999 1:04 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] Need Brad&#39;s email address and we all need to<br/>\nm ail him now<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: HiFi Review &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hifireview@...\">hifireview@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how would you propose this works if a group has a wide range of<br/>\nlevels?
