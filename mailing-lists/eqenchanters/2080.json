They<br/>\nare for sale on the first dock you come to for about 2gp.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother item is Honey Jum from Rivervale.  Get three<br/>\nhoneycombs from Bixies, auctions, or merchants and give them with<br/>\n30gp (3pp usually works) to the alchemist opposite the armoror<br/>\n(the one with Mangler the dog) in RV.  She will give you the Honey<br/>\nJum.<br/>\n<br/>\nOff to Sunny Qeynos.  In the pool under the temple (flying saucer)<br/>\nthere is koalindl fish that you need to kill and get a corpse.  This<br/>\nis tricky as it ruins your faction.  I created a lvl 1 warrior (mule) <br/>\nand had no trouble killing the fish.  Just check that the fish has a <br/>\ncorpse as loot then change to your enchanter.  Loot the corpse and <br/>\ngrab the fish.<br/>\n<br/>\nErud&#39;s Tonic is in Erudin, not surprisingly.  Buy an Innoruk&#39;s Kiss of<br/>\nDeath from the Blue Hawk Inn and go to the library.  Give IKD to<br/>\nSinekin Highbrow on the top level and you get Erud&#39;s Tonic.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to Gregor in Freeport.  I start by Alliancing him but that may<br/>\nnot be necessary.  Give him all four items.  After he gets them all he will<br/>\ngive you the brewer&#39;s book. Now the fun part.<br/>\n<br/>\nTravel to Oggok.  Yes you are KOS there (except for some DEs).  NO<br/>\nproblem, you ARE an enchanter after all.  Illus Dark Elf and invis<br/>\nyourself from South Ro until you get to Oggok.  Go and see Clurg the<br/>\nbar Tender.  He is in the Meet and Drink Tewby bar.  Alliance him and <br/>\ngive him the book ... you should get the<br/>\nStein of Moggok in return.  Gate your butt out of there )<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat quest, great item, great fun.  EVERY enchanter should do this<br/>\nquest )</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
