None<br/>\nto be found in Qeynos as far as I know.  I don&#39;t know if this is the best<br/>\nuse of spells but this is what I did.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Summon and buff pet.<br/>\n2. Tashan<br/>\n3. Suffocating Sphere<br/>\n4. Get hit and let pet pull it off me.<br/>\n5. Fear it<br/>\n6. Beat it down as it runs<br/>\n7. Recast fear and Sphere as necessary.<br/>\n8. Try in vain to issue the pet a &quot;get off what I&#39;m tring to loot&quot; command.<br/>\n<br/>\nUlgrath<br/>\n12th level enchanter<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wanted to say hi and that I just started an Enchanter. I was wondering<br/>\n </span></blockquote>if<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I could get some advice from all of you out there. I&#39;m Erudian, but I am<br/>\n&gt; hunting with a friend in Qeynos Hills right now, I&#39;m 4th level. I really<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing, usually here is what combat is like, I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; been lucky enough to get in a group yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Summon and Buff Pet<br/>\n&gt; 2. Tashan<br/>\n&gt; 3. Suffacating Sphere<br/>\n&gt; 4. Enfeeblement<br/>\n&gt; 5. Watch Animation beat up critter, sometimes help.<br/>\n&gt; 6. Run away recast Animation and help finish it off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Those are pretty much all the spells I use, with the exception of Minor<br/>\n&gt; Guard, Haze and Strengthen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have found that the best exp for me is to kill the diseased stuff and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>turn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; in thier pelts for alot of exp and a cure of course, that&#39;s really nice. I<br/>\n&gt; turned in a fleshy orb once, but she handed it back and said to go to<br/>\n&gt; Freeport, though I have no idea where that is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are there any problems with what I&#39;m doing? Please give me any advice you<br/>\n&gt; can, I would love to hear it, I don&#39;t wanna get stuck in a way of doing<br/>\n&gt; things only to find out that it will be wrong when I get higher in levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS: Where in Qeynos do I buy The daggers for the Animation spells? I lookf<br/>\n&gt; for hours, and go very lost.<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
