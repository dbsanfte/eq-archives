(hopefully someone can shed a new light on them for me).<br/>\n<br/>\n1. In what ways does CHA effect our characters?  A GM hinted around that it effects some spells in some way or another, but she would not confirm anything...<br/>\n<br/>\n2. What effects the Duration of a spell?  anyone every notice that if a level 14 druid SOW&#39;s you that it doesn&#39;t last no where near as long as if a level 30 or so does it?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Does anyone know what determines our &quot;Hit-percentages&quot; at higher levels when transformed (using an illusion) say into a Fire Ele?  (or any illusion where we can become a Mob of some type)  is it our 2H blunt that determines hit or miss?  Hand-to-hand? etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Does anyone know of any illusion spells that we may aquire besides the Race type ones (Dwarf, Human, High Elf, Troll, etc..) and these I have list - (Tree, Earth Ele, Skeleton, Air Ele, Water Ele, Fire Ele, Dry Bone, Spirit Wolf) So do you know of any that I have not listed?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I think I have asked enough questions for today, I sure hope to get some good feedback and would like to thank you ahead of time..<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcos -Lvl 19 - The Rathe- (aka Verrants Secret Test Server) haha J/K..stated for CYA purposes....</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
