They&#39;re a nice workout<br/>\nfor an Enchanter.  For mid to high 20s, warsliks and Lake of Ill Omen are<br/>\npretty darned good.  Through the low 30s, I found Cazic to be about the<br/>\nright challenge - nothing compares to helping a decent group mow through<br/>\nan 8-lizard pull from the upper Tae.  Paw has a few good spots too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, all of these places seem to have enough traffic that you can<br/>\nfind pick-up groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m having trouble now (L35) finding a place as reliable as Cazic for<br/>\nchallenging pick-up groups.  Sometimes SolB has 2 or 3 groups and it&#39;s<br/>\neasy to get into one, sometimes it&#39;s empty.  Crystal Caverns is also<br/>\nvery good for dungeon design, but spotty for finding a group.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nmuch like Frontier Mountains or Overthere - I find outdoor fighting<br/>\nsomewhat boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere did everyone go after Cazic?<br/>\n--<br/>\nMark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My enchanter is 54th level (not higher mostly due to my casual game-play), and<br/>\n&gt; spends a lot of time in the depths of the various Kunark dungeons or doing<br/>\n&gt; planes raids.  All quite a bit of fun, but sometimes one needs a break.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, recently, I&#39;ve been playing a Monk twink, and trying some of the places<br/>\n&gt; that I never tried as an enchanter.  I have to say, I HIGHLY recommend Upper Guk<br/>\n&gt; for someone of your level.  Our party of a warrior, a monk, and a cleric, were<br/>\n&gt; able to clean up quite nicely there, and the loot drops are very good as well.<br/>\n&gt; With an enchanter, we would have been completely unstoppable.  If your normal<br/>\n&gt; party is a paladin, a druid, and an enchanter, you should be able to have a nice<br/>\n&gt; little thing going, and with the experience bonus for Upper Guk implemented,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll see rapid advancement as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Solusek A is also a very good place, but you might want a couple levels before<br/>\n&gt; you start adventuring there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And given that the paladins are good tanks at lower levels, you&#39;d likely have<br/>\n&gt; little problem with your group of three in either place.  The only obstacle I<br/>\n&gt; really see is a lack of GOOD healing in emergency situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personally, I always find dungeons to be more of a challenge as an enchanter.<br/>\n&gt; Adventuring outdoors is usually pretty easy, and it&#39;s not terribly difficult to<br/>\n&gt; separate creatures out, and make the true talents of the enchanter a moot<br/>\n&gt; point.  Give some good dungeon delving a try, as it will REALLY hone your<br/>\n&gt; skills, and show you exactly what an enchanter is capable of.  Single pulls are<br/>\n&gt; all nice and good, but don&#39;t really give us a chance to shine.  *smile*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, just some thoughts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --Lotwilla Verditius<br/>\n&gt;    Illusionist of the Eldritch Collective<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
