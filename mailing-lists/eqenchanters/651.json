Ro, Made Changes to Lesser Faydark, Re-did Misty Thicket, Added a<br/>\nvery basic Blackburrow, Under map of part of the area. I don&#39;t know when I<br/>\nwill get back there, so I posted what I had.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdded an Faction Page with the few factions I know of, and who to kill to<br/>\nchange those factions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdded an Equipment Page with Weapon info. This info is stored in a Access<br/>\nDatabase so I can create Class specific or skill specific pages. Please let<br/>\nme know how you would want to view this info. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I would be interested in getting some info on weapons that I do not<br/>\nhave. Please send me a edited screenshot of the weapon info box. Please DO<br/>\nNOT send me the entire shot, I don&#39;t have a fast enough connection. Just<br/>\nthe box please. I will try to give a little credit to people that help out.<br/>\nTo take a screenshot hit the - key on the numberpad.<br/>\n<br/>\nChanged both the Fletching and Smithing Guides with more upto date info.<br/>\nAlso made some editing changes to make them more readable. If anything is<br/>\nunclear to anyone please e-mail me so I can clear it up.<br/>\nXezol - Lvl 13 Gnome Mag on E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit My EverQuest Page; including zone maps, trade skill guides, general<br/>\nweapons info, and more:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dubuque.net/~sirkal/EverQuest.htm\">http://www.dubuque.net/~sirkal/EverQuest.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
