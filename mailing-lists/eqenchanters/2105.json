I put the maximum practices in before<br/>\nstarting, 21 points.  As with all trade skills, afdter<br/>\nyou reach skill 21 you can never again train at your<br/>\nguildmaster.  Training can come through experience in<br/>\nthe field.  This means failures, and lots of them. <br/>\nSuccesses count for skill too, but they don&#39;t the<br/>\nwallet so I am not too worried about those.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to give you an idea of what the trade is going<br/>\nto cost you to master.  You can get to trivial on<br/>\nsilver items for less than 200p in practice (read that<br/>\nas money lost due to failures).  You will get up to<br/>\n100 skill at about 1000p.  Now start the big numbers. <br/>\nGetting up to the point that the first gold item<br/>\nbecomes trivial could cost you another 1000p or even<br/>\n2000p in failures.   Getting from 150 to 195 is going<br/>\nto cost you in the tens of thousands.  my last few<br/>\npoints, from 195 to 200, cost easily 5,000p in<br/>\nfailures each, maybe more.<br/>\n<br/>\nScary proposition, eh?  Just remmeber that you will be<br/>\nmaking money along the way.  You can&#39;t do jewlecraft<br/>\nas a hobby. If you are going to do it, you need to<br/>\nhawk your wares.  Else you will not be able to afford<br/>\nto practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the previous responder, don&#39;t waste too many<br/>\npractices on languages, enchanters don&#39;t need them. <br/>\nYou can take language classes from other players to<br/>\nlearn languages.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuentin<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
