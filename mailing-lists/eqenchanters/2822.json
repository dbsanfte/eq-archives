I do not \n  like the name generator that Verant so<br>kindly provides. Answering this \n  question(s) became the real challenge and<br>gave my pixels a minor RP \n  perspective that is truly lacking in this game. I<br>love the game, but the \n  war for XP dominates the minds of 98.9% (&lt;~ note the<br>pun?) of those that \n  subscribe.<br><br>Anyway, what follows is a breakdown of why I chose the names \n  I did. I am<br>intrigued to see the results if all of you did the \n  same.<br><br>Personal history: I have been playing RPs since 73, and picked up \n  WhiteWolf<br>as the dominant favorite since 92.<br><br>Arakine Uktena, Woodelf \n  Druid:<br>Arakine-<br>From the movie Dune.
