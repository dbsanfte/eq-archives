I&#39;ve been going to a lot<br/>\nof sources, studying jewelcraft, etc.  I thought it would be a good time to<br/>\nask opinions of people here where I should spend my first few levels.  I<br/>\nhear the isle we start on is a pit and I should get off it as soon as I can,<br/>\nbut I suppose I need to know if I should just stop at Qeynos hills or keep<br/>\ngoing all the way to the Steamfont newbie area? &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.
