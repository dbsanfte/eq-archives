Probably color flux/shift as well.

Just blast &#39;em!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Offense / Defense: Abyssmal (have not been in melee long enough to get hit<br/>\n&gt; very much).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This can be a problem later.  Offense is no big deal, but you should get<br/>\nin the habit of taking a few hits once in awhile to keep defense up.  As<br/>\nan enchanter, you WILL attract mobs sometimes, and it&#39;s very important to<br/>\nbe able to survive a few seconds of something beating on you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Evocation:Is so bad that I don&#39;t think it is above a 1 (if it has even<br/>\n&gt; gotten that high as I have cast it so little).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Replace WTYH and languid pace with your DD spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mezmerise uses conjuration I realize, but I have yet to have a need for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is so foreign to my experience that I don&#39;t know where to start.<br/>\nRoot just didn&#39;t last long enough at low levels for me to use as crowd<br/>\ncontrol, so mez was VERY important for any overpull.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Should I take the time to summon a pet and Mez it for an hour to get my<br/>\n&gt; skill up?

The nice thing about spell<br/>\nskills is that they can be practiced without combat.  A warrior who lets<br/>\nhis 2HS get behind has to fight tough critters with weak skills to get it<br/>\nup.  A caster who lets conjuration fall behind can practice on her pet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know my wife and I will go far together with this combo, but I am worried<br/>\n&gt; that I will lack the finess needed in a group of tanks when my guild goes on<br/>\n&gt; raids and such. Anyone have any advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If this is a worry for you, spend some time in groups.  Not only do you<br/>\nmake friends, you learn another aspect to the game. <br/>\n--<br/>\nMark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
