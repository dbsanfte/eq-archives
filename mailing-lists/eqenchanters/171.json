At least for now until we know more.  Not meaning to be<br/>\n&gt; rude as I think we have good information to pass back and forth on other<br/>\n&gt; topics.  But, this is beginning to remind me of arguments with my wife<br/>\n&gt; about who would take out the trash or what exactly did I mean when I<br/>\n&gt; said &lt;blank&gt;. Now, let&#39;s not confuse this with the &quot;your computer means<br/>\n&gt; more to you than me&quot; fights cause those are in another league and they<br/>\n&gt; just don&#39;t understand hehe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, this is the kind of thread that discourages people from being a<br/>\n&gt; part of mailing lists.

To me, this is far more &#39;tangible<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; informative&#39; than saying that Stratics says something, ergo it must be<br/>\n&gt; true.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; .........ppl just argur for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sake of the arguement I think<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of couse, arguing is fun. =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ......oh well....until Stratics proves to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wrong or has falsified information I will continue to read their site<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;take it to heart<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Firstly, I never even suggested that Stratics falsified information.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; talked with eqss people in the chat rooms in beta, and grouped with one<br/>\n&gt; early in retail.  They&#39;re good, honest people.  However, they are *not*<br/>\n&gt; perfect.  You want an example of wrong info on the sight?  Okie dokie.<br/>\n&gt; If<br/>\n&gt; you look under thier class reference chart, you&#39;ll see that barbarians<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; large sized creatures, and it will say that, for example, high elves are<br/>\n&gt; small/medium.  Now, the thing is, barbarians are capable of wearing<br/>\n&gt; medium<br/>\n&gt; armor too.  The simple fact is, Verant has not released a great deal of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;number crunching&#39; information, so I&#39;m likely to at least pay attention<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; someone who comes up with new information rather than dismissing it out<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; hand do to its not being known beforehand.  *All* the information that<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; once stratics was once this way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ......and by the by.......MANY of the authors of EQ are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;directly involved with GMs and what not....just becuase they arent<br/>\n&gt; Verant<br/>\n&gt; &gt;EMPLOYEES dusnt mean they dont have inside information.......<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll admit befuddlement as to what you mean when you say &quot;many of the<br/>\n&gt; authors of EQ are directly involved with EQ...&quot;.  I assume you mean that<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; authors of EQSS or perhaps EQVault there rather than EQ.  I&#39;m quite<br/>\n&gt; certain<br/>\n&gt; that the authors of EQ are involved with the GMs. ;)  However, neing<br/>\n&gt; friends<br/>\n&gt; with the admins of CoN, I can assure you that GMs do *not* give out<br/>\n&gt; specific<br/>\n&gt; number crunching values to anyone.  Seriously, how do you mean that they<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; involved?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Jude Morrigan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Neurosiz<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Share the wealth!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Tell a friend about ONElist&#39;s 130,000 free e-mail communities!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that ONElist hosts some of the largest lists on the<br/>\n&gt; Internet?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Our scaleable system is the most reliable free e-mail service on the<br/>\n&gt; Internet!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Are you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Friends tell friends about ONElist! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
