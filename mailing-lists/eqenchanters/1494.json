Malachite will<br/>\nprobably get you 15 points or more, but I wouldn&#39;t know because I<br/>\ntrained with my guildmaster for 21 points. With the next 10 stones or<br/>\nso you can get 2 skill points each before they become trivial, assuming<br/>\nyou do them in order. Starting with Wolfs Eye Agate or Jade it<br/>\nincreases to 3 points of skill per stone.  Not all the stones are<br/>\nreadily purchasable so you may have to do 4, 6 or even more points with<br/>\na more expensive stone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaelish has the stones listed in order on his site.  Print out this<br/>\npage and refer to it as you practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/pages/jewel_table.htm\">http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/pages/jewel_table.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nQuentin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are thousands of opinions on the &quot;best way&quot; to<br/>\n&gt; go <br/>\n&gt; about raising your skill and making money at the<br/>\n&gt; same <br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; My question is this:<br/>\n&gt; If I do not train more than 5 points into Jewel<br/>\n&gt; Craft, <br/>\n&gt; and raise it by experience instead (for the RP<br/>\n&gt; aspect of <br/>\n&gt; learning hands on :) )is it beneficial to use silver<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; bars and Quarts/Malachite to increase skill?<br/>\n&gt; At level 21 (max trainable at the guild) what gems<br/>\n&gt; will <br/>\n&gt; not help raise JC skill?  <br/>\n&gt; What is the order of stone progression exactly. ie<br/>\n&gt; what <br/>\n&gt; does &quot;start with Carnelian and work your way up&quot;<br/>\n&gt; mean?<br/>\n&gt; Can you give me a list? Star Rose Quarts, Carnelian,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jasper, ?, ?, ?  <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for reading my frustrated rant.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Off topic, I was in N.Ro last night and I have never<br/>\n&gt; had <br/>\n&gt; as much fun killing Skeles. Before I had to go sell<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; had bagged 18 skeles in 30 minutes as the zone was <br/>\n&gt; completely cleared and repopped twice. I started<br/>\n&gt; with no <br/>\n&gt; money after just coming from the bank and had 5gp<br/>\n&gt; equiv. <br/>\n&gt; in copper and silver before I had to go sell. I hope<br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; do it again tonight. hehe.<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Artimis<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter 1st Rank<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxxulous\t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Who is the most visited e-mail list community Web<br/>\n&gt; Service?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist.com - where more than 20 million e-mails are<br/>\n&gt; exchanged each day!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
