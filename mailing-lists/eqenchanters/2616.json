My shaman is 29th and a lvl 50 mag<br/>\nwith journeyman boots could easily outrun me.  I was<br/>\nfollowing him and he had to stop every now and then<br/>\nfor me to catch up.  I asked him how he was gong so<br/>\nfast and he said all he had was journeyman boots.  I<br/>\nwas not encumbered and it was not a lag thing.  I am<br/>\ninclined to think that the sow effect you recieve from<br/>\nthe journeyman boots is actually based on the level of<br/>\nthe person wearing them.  i.e. if journeyman had the<br/>\neffect of a lvl 9 sow then my 29 shaman would be<br/>\npretty upset that he can&#39;t outrun that mage :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some more info.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnacton<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Whitcraft,David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dwhitcraft@...\">dwhitcraft@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Journeyman&#39;s boots are the booties ye be speaking<br/>\n&gt; of.
