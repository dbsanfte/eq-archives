The player becomes charmed, the pet registers it as an attack on its <br/>\nowner and attacks the person casting charm, and then the PC (as your pet) <br/>\nregisters this as an attack on you and attacks the pet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can let them duke it out until the PC kills its own pets and damages <br/>\nitself in the process.  Then you can root him/her (releasing him/her from the <br/>\ncharm) and finish him/her with ease.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a cruel tactic, but we enchanters don&#39;t win with the straight strength <br/>\nof our spells.  It is the creative way we utilize them that gives us our <br/>\nadvantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis tactic generally only works as an offensive tactic (i.e. Humans <br/>\nattacking Dark Elves, Dark Elves attacking Humans, Gnomes attacking High <br/>\nElves, High Elves attacking Gnomes, etc etc)) because Charm takes too long to <br/>\ncast once you are under attack.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
