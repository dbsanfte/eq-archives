I just watch the pet getting slain and another 3<br/>\n&gt; dagger<br/>\n&gt; going lost.. any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t[Hapke, Matthew]  NOpe. No suggestions. This is the life of our<br/>\nanimations. Young , Dumb, and fealress.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. In group fighting with possibly more than one mob, i try to tag the<br/>\n&gt; different monsters to cast my really fine enchanter spells, clicking<br/>\n&gt; directly on the chest or head of a monster, and what did i tag? ... my<br/>\n&gt; pet,<br/>\n&gt; my partymembers... everything clickable in around the next five<br/>\n&gt; miles... but<br/>\n&gt; not the monster i want. F8 always tags my pet.. its quite useless.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; i loose lots of seconds runnig forth and back or around the battle to<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; the mob tagged. The same with 3 orcs running towards us... strategy is<br/>\n&gt; clear, just root, flux or mesmerize to control 2 of them and wait<br/>\n&gt; until the<br/>\n&gt; party slain the first... but the run nearly one orc inside the other,<br/>\n&gt; chances to tag them in time to cast...zero. its a stupid handling<br/>\n&gt; prob...and<br/>\n&gt; that stupid pet is always in the line of sight. Suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t[Hapke, Matthew]  Click on the health bar of the group member<br/>\nwho is fighting the mob you want to attack, then type /assist  The<br/>\nclient will then target your group member&#39;s target. Very useful for<br/>\nenchanters! You should teach your whole group this command so they can<br/>\nconcentrate on one Mob at a time, while you  mes the others and make<br/>\nthem wait their turn =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. anyone ever casted a pet in befallen? i am getting mad about that,<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; pet is that nervous runnig around me, and is alwas really far from me,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; get into melee with everything that moves. Once i casted 4 pets<br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; every 2 minutes i realized, oh the pet got lost somewhere i didnt even<br/>\n&gt; hear<br/>\n&gt; a taunting attacker... i run around there a lot, from one door to the<br/>\n&gt; next,<br/>\n&gt; and most times i dont even see, where my pet is, and where he gets<br/>\n&gt; himself<br/>\n&gt; slain this time. suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t[Hapke, Matthew]  This happens in all the dungeons. In Black<br/>\nBurrow where I have spent a lot of time, my pet fequently gets left<br/>\nbehind. He does eventually make it out, but sometimes I have to go and<br/>\nunstick him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Niniel<br/>\n&gt; lvl 11 darkelf enchantress on Solusek ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Explore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
