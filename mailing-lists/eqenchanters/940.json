Pardon me but does that really effect game <br/>\nplay? I think it looks cool when they have a bow and a sword, looking like <br/>\ndual wielding newbies. Some people just need to look around the bugs and <br/>\njust play, Verant fixed all really bad bugs. And with every patch you can <br/>\nexpect some bugs to come up, like the illusion bugs. I don&#39;t play my <br/>\nenchanter anymore, so I never knew it wouldn&#39;t work. And when they patch <br/>\nsomething they only test what is going in... Not every single little detail, <br/>\nlike enchanter&#39;s illusion spells effects. If they did that we would get a <br/>\nnew patch every 3 months and still be like we were in pre beta testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Mushin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mushin@...\">mushin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Swap Character between Servers? Are you crazy?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is an onlline world that is consistently changing what good would<br/>\n&gt;moving a character to anohter server do? So your friends are not on the <br/>\n&gt;same<br/>\n&gt;server as you.. create a new character on that server and play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3) The inability to swap characters between different servers is stupid,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hopefully Microsoft learns from that major EQ mistake. (I&#39;d still like to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;play with all my friends and co-workers on the same server, instead of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spread out over 4 servers, pity EQ doesn&#39;t realize how critical this<br/>\n&gt;feature<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is to allot of us - who the hell wants to start over? Hint: we&#39;d pay to <br/>\n&gt;get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;our chars moved over Verant.) The correct implementation would have been<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;log-in:choose character:choose server:play&gt; not what it is now.
