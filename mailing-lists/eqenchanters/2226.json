Hoping my guild will make a run for the Imps of Firegiants soon <br/>\nheh. Little off topic here specially on an enchanter board, but look me up <br/>\nnext time yer hunting imps or firegiants and need any help. My primary char <br/>\non Veeshan is a lvl 46 Necro. Enchanter is on a diff server and doesn&#39;t get <br/>\nplayed much any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nKlayan Deathbringer<br/>\nThe Oracle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Andrew Collins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ACollins@...\">ACollins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqenchanters] Digest Number 197<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 13 Dec 1999 09:13:49 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would just like to add that the new mes series change rocks!<br/>\n&gt;Goodbye mesmerize forever! See, I used to always use enthrall, but I would<br/>\n&gt;add mes to my list as a back up in case enthrall was resisted, so i didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;have to wait 5 seconds for a recast. I also used both when fighting tough<br/>\n&gt;battles such as the Ghoul Lord or King. AE mesmerization is reserved for<br/>\n&gt;trains, and weaker mobs. I learned my lesson when I tried to AE mesmerize 5<br/>\n&gt;Imp Protectors. With everyone resisting and knocking me dead in a little<br/>\n&gt;over 1 round (they were all red to me at the time). Instead, when fighting<br/>\n&gt;really tough battle I pick them off 1 at a time, that way if it is resisted<br/>\n&gt;I only have to deal with 1 mob attacking me at a time. And with 4 other <br/>\n&gt;Imps<br/>\n&gt;beating on my party I need to act quickly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So now I have Entrance as my main spell, and Enthrall as a back up, and in <br/>\n&gt;1<br/>\n&gt;level I will be using Dazzle/Entrance. I can&#39;t wait to use dazzle, because<br/>\n&gt;entrance has kept most things entranced for 60+ seconds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Maelael, 48th Enchanter<br/>\n&gt;-Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
