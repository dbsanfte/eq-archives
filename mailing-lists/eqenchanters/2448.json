However I have<br/>\nbroken camps with mes before. There are different ways to do it, and Im not<br/>\nsure if you are talking about dungeon or outdoor camps, (dungeon a little<br/>\nmore difficult to break).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a 3 spawn outdoor camp example.<br/>\n<br/>\nCast mes for pulling. You mes one, and 2 come running from the camp. They<br/>\nboth hit you and your pet engages one. Have your party pull one quickly off<br/>\nof your pet and bring it a safe distance away and start whacking it. Once<br/>\nboth are off you (one on your pet, one on the party), memblur the initial<br/>\ntarget that was mesd. Now he will stay at the camp.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow watch your pet. He shouldnt be able to win against the mob, if he does<br/>\nyou are prolly too high level for the camp =). Stay a distance away until<br/>\npet is almost dead. Now cast mes. Once your pet dies, the mob is mesd. Then<br/>\nmemblur, walk back to your party. Now the camp is back to normal minus 1<br/>\nmob.<br/>\n<br/>\nWait the proper amount of time, then pull with mes again. Memblur the mesd<br/>\none, kill the other one. Wait a few more minutes, pull and kill the last<br/>\none. Now you have a perfectly spaced camp.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn dungeons usually you dont have the luxury to pick a good place to fight,<br/>\nand must fight an entire room. I have broken and killed many rooms solo<br/>\n(Executioner, Cavalier, Sage, Live Tower, etc...) Always cast mes first,<br/>\nthis reduces the number you face. The problem now is you will prolly still<br/>\nbe facing 2-4 mobs that are now on you. (hopefully you cast runeiii and<br/>\nberserker on your pet) this will allow him to take enough damage so that you<br/>\ncan mes. If everything is going good, then awesome , kill them. If however<br/>\nyou are low on mana, pet getting a whoopin... go ahead and settle for<br/>\nkilling one or two, now gate.<br/>\n<br/>\nRun back down to spot, make a pet, buff up, and start again with 1 or 2 mobs<br/>\nless. Gate is not preferred, cause its fun to clear an entire room, but its<br/>\na good backup. If you are down to 1 or 2 mobs and pet about dead, save your<br/>\nlast bub of mana, mes one, let your pet die, mes the other...(at this point<br/>\ndepending if you can memblur do it, rest and rebuff, if you cant leave the<br/>\nroom, keep meditating and casting mes until your fom. This will take a long<br/>\ntime because of casting 2 mes constantly. However once you rebuff you can<br/>\nkill one, and meditate again since your pet doesnt know the 2nd is aggro =)<br/>\n<br/>\nanyways just some tips.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Maelael, 50th Enchanter, Veeshan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;hehe, you&#39;re not kidding!

Its because the higher level they are above the spell level,<br/>\nthe more chance they resist the memblur part. Anyway when fighting level<br/>\n35-53 mobs<br/>\nyoull find the mes series doesnt quite wipe the hate list, and will find<br/>\nyourself attacked very often. Memblur isnt %100 either but its chance for<br/>\nsuccess are much higher. If a mob is in combat how do you wipe its hate if<br/>\nit aggros you or a caster? Enthrall may only make it angry with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen travelling thru lower guk my spell list was comprised mainly of<br/>\n1. Buff (speed, clarity, personal buffs, insight, etc...)<br/>\n2.

In the spell descriptions at<br/>\n&gt; EQ.castersrealm.com, the Mezmorize line is mentioned as having a good<br/>\nchance<br/>\n&gt; of wiping the hate list only if you are outside the MOB&#39;s agresso range<br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; the spell wears off.  Enthrall when resisted will also put you at or near<br/>\n&gt; the top of the MOB&#39;s hate list, while an inneffective Memory Blur doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; seem to have this taunt factor. At 37, you are using Entrance over<br/>\nEnthrall,<br/>\n&gt; right?
