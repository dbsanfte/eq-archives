Last night on<br/>\nwisp isle (where I used to hang out alot to get the money for my 12th level<br/>\nspells) my pet was dying before I could finish casting my opening spells.<br/>\nThis used to happen only rarely, but last night I was only able to keep the<br/>\npet 2 times out of 11. After looking at the log, it appears that the pets<br/>\nhad far fewer hp than normal. I understand that sometimes you just get a<br/>\nweak pet, but with so many consecutively? BTW, I had gotten killed in a<br/>\nKerra spider snafu and had lost 12th level, so the pet I was using was the<br/>\n8th level one that I was very familiar with, and had been using to harvest<br/>\nwisps earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings me to my 2nd question. Does anyone know how the 12th level pet<br/>\nspell works? What I mean is, it doesn&#39;t appear to create a randomly strong<br/>\npet like the 8th level spell does. The first 4 pets I cast conned green to<br/>\nme. The next few conned blue to me. I had heard that you could get a pet<br/>\nthat cons white to you at 12th level, but I didn&#39;t see one last night. As a<br/>\nmatter of fact, the level 8 pets that I had to use after losing my level<br/>\nseemed to do better than my level 12 pets. My conjuration is in the low<br/>\n50&#39;s, so it&#39;s not maxed, but it&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. Anyone else have<br/>\nany similar experiences?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
