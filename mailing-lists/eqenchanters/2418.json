Since I fail repeatedly at<br/>\nmaking them, and I see no one auctioning these pages, at this rate I will be<br/>\nlevel 30 before I have them.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd looking ahead a bit as well, where should I go for the level 24 research<br/>\npages as well.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI was level 18 when I found out that Jonah and other Lake Rathe mobs give<br/>\nlevel 16 ones out like candy.  Now those pages (for 16) are all I ever see<br/>\nanywhere (I practically throw them away I have so many), but there must be<br/>\nother treasure troves like Jonah for level 20 and 24 spells too (I hope). <br/>\n <br/>\nMy poor (and I mean &#39;broke&#39;) level 21 enchantress has CHA and INT both just<br/>\nover 130.  I am working hard on jewelcraft to try to fill in my (bare) ear<br/>\nslots, and wrist slots in particular, but she currently sports damask or<br/>\nleather or cloth underwear. A second question I have is .. at what level can<br/>\nI successfully do Evil Eyes in the gorge (given the above stats, and with a<br/>\nmagic resist of 57).  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy druid, with a partner druid, has a lot of trouble with them at level<br/>\n25/26 (magic resist at base 25) but since evil eyes are enchanters, I hoped<br/>\nwe might be more successful at earlier levels? <br/>\n <br/>\n I (my enchanter) often group with a level 21 cleric but I think we might<br/>\nneed another tank type to help out (unless my pet can take on that role?)<br/>\nEvil eyes often seem to have both an animation and a mino pet, and they<br/>\nthrow blindness, fear, debuffs and charm on us. Can be wild there. Fun but I<br/>\nam going steadily backwards with my druid so far.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for any help you can give me. I enjoy this list very much. <br/>\n <br/>\nChiasma<br/>\n21st season, Fennin Ro<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/1571/4/_/451658/_/952061503/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/1571/4/_/451658/_/952061503/</a>&gt; <br/>\n Click Here for Move.com!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adimg.egroups.com/img/1571/4/_/451658/_/952061503/468x60mcpdrotate.g\">http://adimg.egroups.com/img/1571/4/_/451658/_/952061503/468x60mcpdrotate.g</a><br/>\nif&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
