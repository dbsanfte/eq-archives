But I really wanted to make<br/>\nso comments.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Players will no longer crash when an extremely long group message is<br/>\nreceived.<br/>\n<br/>\nPreventing the from crashing is always a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Added the ability to pull one item &quot;charge&quot; from a stack by holding down<br/>\nthe &quot;Control&quot; key when left-clicking on the stack.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone who has ever tried to advance in a trade skill this is a welcomed<br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\n- After casting a spell at an NPC, if the target were lost before the spell<br/>\nmade contact, the caster would crash.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a declaritive statement.  Did they fix it or are they just<br/>\nacknowleding it?<br/>\n<br/>\n- The &quot;/ignore&quot; command will now ignore emotes also.<br/>\n- The chat command &quot;/e&quot; will trigger &quot;/emote&quot; instead of exiting to the<br/>\ncharacter selection screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t argue with change for the better.<br/>\n<br/>\n- We have added new sound tracks to the Planes, Crushbone, Guk, Mistmoore,<br/>\nSteamfont, and the Estate of Un<br/>\n<br/>\nI would rather have the bug worked on over the soundtracks but that is just<br/>\nmy own opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n- We have reduced the amount of experience lost when dying by 50%.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would have helped me 2 weeks ago when I hit level 14, 13 different<br/>\ntimes.  Probably my favorite of the non enchanter changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A number of new quests have been added to various zones.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the question is do they actually work?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Magician pets (elemental) will now cast minor spells (to make up for their<br/>\nlack of kick)<br/>\n- New Magician spells on vendors and some Magician spells have moved to<br/>\ndifferent vendors<br/>\n- New Magician weapons for Summon Fang & Spear of Warding & Dagger of<br/>\nSymbols<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t play an enchanter but I am sure that they will like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n- New enchanter whirl spell (check the vendors)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know what level this is for?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Whirl now works on MOBS better than it did on the last patch.<br/>\n- The saving throw against Memory Blur and Atone was reduced (harder to save<br/>\nagainst) from the last patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEY LISTENED!  I am suprised.  Although they didn&#39;t put it back to where it<br/>\nwas, I am happy.  Really it could be a sham, the change could be only one<br/>\npercentage point of resist and it would still be true.  BUT they did listen<br/>\nto us and made an attempt to apiece us.<br/>\n<br/>\n- AC added to the Rune Series (Enchanter)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t have it yet but at least it isn&#39;t a downgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Alliance series works better (Enchanter)<br/>\n- Enchanter Attack Speed spells now have longer durations (Quickness,<br/>\nAlacrity, etc.)<br/>\n- Tashan (the entire Enchanter series) is now quicker to cast, costs less<br/>\nmana, and is harder to save against.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat took so long?  These should not have been patches after the game was<br/>\nreleased.  Tashan has always been pretty useless along with Alliance.  And I<br/>\ntold that the speed spells weren&#39;t worth the mana for what you got.<br/>\n<br/>\n- New bard songs have been added to the vendors<br/>\n- Paladins lose the spell Bravery, and gain the spell Valor<br/>\n- ShadowKnights and Necromancers gain the Word of Spirit spell (replacing<br/>\nWord of Shadow for the ShadowKnight)<br/>\n- ShadowKnights lose Haunting Corpse and gain Summon Dead<br/>\n- Necromancers and ShadowKnights get a new spell - Shadow Vortex.<br/>\n- ShadowKnights lose Intensify Death (replaced by Shadow Vortex)<br/>\n- Rangers lose Shield of Barbs and gain Shield of Brambles<br/>\n<br/>\nGood for them....  =)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Shorter stun effects will no longer remove longer stun effects (Bash won&#39;t<br/>\nget rid of whirl, for example)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example of Feedback in action.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Spell components are now stackable<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain what took so long.  Why were they ever created not stackable?<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t let this stop any of your feedback or petitions.  Tonight send a<br/>\nfeedback giving thanks for the improvements, but also tell them what needs<br/>\nto be improved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------<br/>\nWhen the people we love are stolen from us, the way to have them live on is<br/>\nto never stop loving them.  Buildings burn, people die, but real love is<br/>\nforever.  -- The Crow</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
