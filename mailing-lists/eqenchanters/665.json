I mean we are supposed to be enchanters right<br/>\nbut the only things we can enchant or metals which seem to not do to much<br/>\nfor us considering they sell for less then they cost for us to make them.<br/>\nAre the peopl at EQ going to give us other enchantments maybe something that<br/>\nlets us add a fire effect or a ice effect to a weapon something that will at<br/>\nleast be of service to us. I dont know i may be wrong on this but i dont<br/>\nfind it fair for are enchantment spells to be taken away we are supposed to<br/>\nbe enchanters not another form or wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\naldron</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
