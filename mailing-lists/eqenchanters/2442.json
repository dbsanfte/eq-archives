Am I breaking up a spawn? Am I in a situation where trains will<br/>\nhave to be dealt with or are we off the tracks? Are we outdoors taking on<br/>\none solo creature? Other classes pretty much keep the same spells memorized<br/>\nno matter what the situation. We can do different things depending on the<br/>\nsituation, and have a variety of spells to choose from to do so. There are<br/>\nsituations where 8 spell slots just don&#39;t seem to be enough and I find<br/>\nmyself constantly switching out spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne situation that hasn&#39;t been mentioned is PvP. Many of our spells while<br/>\nseeming useless against critters you usually fight, are quite strong in a<br/>\nPvP environment. Whenever travelling on Vallon Zek in non-friendly areas<br/>\n(and us enchanters are the one class on the PvP-Teams server that MUST do<br/>\nthis) or going out to PK, I find myself using completely different spells<br/>\nthan usual combat. Some stay the same, but Strip Enchantments, for example,<br/>\nis a must have for PvP. Low mana spell interrupting spells are also a must<br/>\nhave. Debuffs, while usually useless, can easily encumber a player, and<br/>\nlower rank ones (which means less mana) are quite useful for this. Too bad<br/>\nthere is no fix for the abuses that charm can lead to, because when we could<br/>\ncharm PvP, we were not only the masters of PvP, but were rightfully feared.<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi ~Hand of Chaos~, CT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
