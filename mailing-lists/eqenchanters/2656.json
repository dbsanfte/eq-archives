I attempted to turn in items to the warlord on the balcony in the<br/>\nlake of ill omen and as soon as I left clicked on him with the item on the<br/>\ncursor I became visible as he killed me.  At 170 a shot I lasted about 3<br/>\nhits heh.

Especially since here are two bankers right next to each other. <br/>\nDo the newbie quests as those raise all guild factions I believe. <br/>\nField of Bone hand in Scorpion Pincers <br/>\nLake of Ill Omen hand in Sarnak hatchling brains (Also can hand in those to<br/>\nthe Necro guild) <br/>\nWarsliks Wood it is Goblin watcher torches or beads <br/>\nLake of Ill Omen it is froglok tongues. <br/>\nOne of the Troopers in Field of Bone near the city gate also takes 4 bone<br/>\nchips. <br/>\nAll of these are 4 item at a time quests. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter you have done those 4 a bit and you probably need Iksar and<br/>\nbenevolence to turn them in, but invis might work. <br/>\nThen do the cuirskin quest. <br/>\nGate a backpack full of hides off scaled wolf pups and go to the merchant<br/>\nnear the monk guild. <br/>\nAsk to preform a small service (spell preform or perform, I forget) and get<br/>\na special pack to put the hides in then combine them and hand it back. <br/>\nThis I believe raises resident faction. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3480/8/_/451658/_/959277843/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3480/8/_/451658/_/959277843/</a>&gt; <br/>\n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adimg.egroups.com/img/3480/8/_/451658/_/959277843/Burned_468.gif\">http://adimg.egroups.com/img/3480/8/_/451658/_/959277843/Burned_468.gif</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
