Works very well when you team up with a<br/>\nwizard (Tashan+root then leave the nuker do his job) or facing some<br/>\nannoying mobs who just have this tendency to run for cover. It would have<br/>\nnormally be replaced by WTYH at later stage but that spell has been tweaked<br/>\nand is of no use.<br/>\n<br/>\nCancel magic : remove good and bad spells on you or others. Very useful<br/>\nagainst  targets who uses damaging shields (eg fire elm in lavastorm).<br/>\nDefensively great when you go against necro (befallen). Not aggro. Great<br/>\npvp spell <br/>\n<br/>\nSoothe : used in conjonction with mez to weed out opposition. Motsly useful<br/>\nagainst camps or in dungeons. Soothe is not aggro, so against a party you<br/>\nsoothe one, mez (later enthrall) another which draw the rest of the crowd<br/>\nto you and pet (or party). So, if alone, you can face a lone opponent<br/>\ninstead of a three mob. <br/>\n<br/>\nIbnabeth / Karana<br/>\n18 or 17 depending on the amount of stupid pills I take /day<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:03 13/07/1999 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   Well, I finally made level 8, and I mus tsay I love the  spells!

I do not want to go to Crushbone, but the <br/>\n&gt;Dragon Bones in Steamfont where I am fighting right now are also pretty<br/>\n&gt;boring.  I do not want to take a month to get to the next spell circle like<br/>\n&gt;I did this  time, can anyone help me out?
