It is surrounded by<br/>\nKithicor and East Karana.  Try one of the websites or just ask again if<br/>\nyou can&#39;t manage to find one of these places.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are coming from the Qeynos direction you will enter at the West<br/>\nGate.  On the east end of East Karana is a huge ramp that climbs up in<br/>\nto the mountains.  Climb the ramp to zone into the West Gate of High<br/>\nHold Pass.  Gnolls in the level 16 20 range spawn at this gate.  Invis<br/>\nis the way to go.  The easiest way to get to the Keep if you are not<br/>\nfamiliar with the area is to stay on the main path (Don&#39;t go up any<br/>\nramps) and take all left turns.  You will pass a log cabin that is a<br/>\nsaloon (Maybe the Golden Rooster) and this should tell you you are<br/>\nclose.  Following the next turn should bring you to the front of a<br/>\ncastle, High Keep.  Eventually you will learn there is a faster way<br/>\nthat lets you skip that loop with the saloon, but until you are healthy<br/>\nenough to learn the terrain without getting stomped by a gnoll, follow<br/>\nthe left hand wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose of you coming from Freeport/Neriak will approach through<br/>\nKithicor.  At the West end of Kithicor you will find a mountain zone<br/>\nentrance to High Pass.  Orcs spawn at this end and they should be<br/>\napproximately the same level as the gnolls, if not a little bit higher.<br/>\n These guys spawn right on the path so if there is no one there killing<br/>\nthem off, you will HAVE to be invis to get through with out a scuffle. <br/>\nFollow the main path until you come to a wooden bridge.  Don&#39;t cross<br/>\nthe bridge but rather take a 90 degree turn to the right and look down<br/>\nthe hill.  The path continues here.  Going down the hill you will see a<br/>\nstore called Serpent Supply.  Just skip it and follow the path up to<br/>\nthe left.  You will soon enter a cave, and this i sa good time to stop<br/>\nand look around.  if you take a left inside the cave you end up in a<br/>\nsmall room with 3 bandits who will quickly dispatch you if you are<br/>\nunder level 16 or so.  Take a right instead, going up a small hill and<br/>\nthen down the otherside in to the hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow all you Westerners and Easterners are in the same place, looking at<br/>\nthe front of the Keep.  Go in to the keep and enter by going either<br/>\nleft or right, they both end up in the same place as you go around the<br/>\nwall to zone into High Keep.  The Keep is not entirely safe because<br/>\nthere are some level 24 to 30 goblins in the basement as well as some<br/>\ncrazed prisoners in the jail next to the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you enter the zone you findyourself in a courtyard with a vendor and<br/>\na beggar and another gate in front of you.  Again you can go either way<br/>\naround the wall (has a HIGH KEEP sign) to get inside.  There is a<br/>\nhallway to the left and right with a staircase going up and another<br/>\nwall in front of you to go around.  This time you can only go to the<br/>\nleft.  That&#39;s your clue that you are in the right place.  After going<br/>\nleft around the wall you can go straight to the vendor by going through<br/>\nthe first door on the left.  There is a door in this room you must<br/>\nopen, then you will find a bard and enchanter vendor a couple rooms<br/>\nback.  If you need to go to the bank it is downstairs.   from the point<br/>\nwhere you went arounfd the wall to the left, go to the right wall and<br/>\nenter the inn through either of the two doors.  take a left and then<br/>\nanother left and go down the stairs.  at the bottom of the stairs take<br/>\na right and you should see the bank on your right.  Do your business<br/>\nand go back upstairs.  Don&#39;t open the door and don&#39;t go down another<br/>\nlevel of steps.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully that should get you there.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It can only be found in Highpass Hold.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know where, but that is the only place that<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; know of.<br/>\n&gt; Good Luck.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Templarus<br/>\n&gt; 4th level Enchanter<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxulous\t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t\t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Nsane98@...\">Nsane98@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyone know where I can get mercyls<br/>\n&gt; animation?(level 8 pet spell)  I can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt; seem to find it in Neriak.
