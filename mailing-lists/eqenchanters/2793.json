What I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1173105602\">&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nBlind will not stop it from attacking you in my experience<br/>\n&lt;/snip&gt;<br/>\nUsing Sunbeam with my druid, I have had some experience with the Blind<br/>\nspell. What I can tell you is that if you are within melee agro range, the<br/>\nMoB will come after you. However, if you Tash, Stun, Blind and back out of<br/>\nagro range it will wander around &quot;aimlessly&quot;. DD, DoT, enter agro to lead it<br/>\naway from more help, etc. I do not have much experience with the Enchanter<br/>\nside of the house, so I was wondering if an Enchanter can kill a mob with<br/>\nthis tactic alone (ie no pet).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nWhirl is a stun, Once pet hits or you land a DD WTYH will break.<br/>\n&lt;/snip&gt;<br/>\nI was under the impression that when stunned, the MoB is stunned for the<br/>\nduration no matter what you did to the mob (melee, DD, or DoT). I know when<br/>\nmy char gets stunned, it can&#39;t do squat until the &quot;You are no longer<br/>\nstunned!&quot; message appears.<br/>\nOr am I wrong here and the dogs, er gods, of Norrath don&#39;t treat this the<br/>\nsame for MoBs and Characters?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nAs you get higher in level you will want to use Charm OVER having a pet,<br/>\nthis will allow you to take out TWO or more mobs with less mana. Remember to<br/>\nrefresh your charm if you have an extended battle.<br/>\n&lt;/snip&gt;<br/>\nIs this suggestion because of the mana drain from the Charm spell? I know a<br/>\nMoB will hit for alot more than a Pet. The idea of a pet at 24 that hits in<br/>\nthe 50s is very appealing. What does an animation hit for at 24th?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThicken Mana revisited:<br/>\nAfter you create a Vial-O-Mana, can you right click on it to regain that<br/>\nmana? Or is it&#39;s only purpose for the Wu Gauntlets at this time?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am used to soloing with my Druid. Is there anyone that has soloed to<br/>\n50th?Stupid people are very common so I try to avoid them as much as<br/>\npossible. Low levels are bad enough, but to lose xp because of other&#39;s<br/>\nstupidity is more than frustrating. If I die because of something I do, then<br/>\nI learn and go on. Anyway, solo sugestions and experiences are very welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nArakine</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
