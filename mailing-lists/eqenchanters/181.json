Whether or not the totem staff is worth it is<br/>\nvery largely dependant on your level.  If you&#39;re using the 2H blunt skill,<br/>\nyou should go something like worn great -&gt; fine steet great -&gt; rune totem.<br/>\nEventually, you really will need to get the totem however, there are just<br/>\ntoo many magic only mobs once you get much higher than 15.  Certainly, the<br/>\nmagic flag is the only real advantage it has over the fine steel.<br/>\n    On the other hand, one of the perks of being a magic slinger is a nice<br/>\nhigh intelligence.  Later on, I know there are daggers that are very, very<br/>\nnice, and I&#39;ve heard that some of the better staffs out there are 1H&#39;ers.  I<br/>\nwould really recommend trying to keep all your weapon skills up.  Once you<br/>\nget to the point where you&#39;re maxing them out (prolly around level 8ish), it<br/>\nbecomes very, very easy to keep them that way, allowing you to always use<br/>\nthe best you can find.  However, if you&#39;re only going to use one weapon<br/>\nskill, I would recommend two handed blunt.  Magical weapons in the other<br/>\nskills are either very hard to find or hideously expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nJude Morrigan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
