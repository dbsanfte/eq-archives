From posts DIRECTLY from the magic guy, GZ, it is quite<br/>\nevident that Charisma DOES affect most, if not all, of the enchanter spells.<br/>\nHow much? That is the current debate. You need to learn to accept the<br/>\nopinions of others as that, and stop down playing everyone else.

I quote straigth from the ATTRIBUTE section<br/>\n&gt; on the left<br/>\n&gt; hand side of the website......this is cut and copied for all you NON<br/>\n&gt; belivers!!!   if you ppl will notice that ONLY the charm spell is effected<br/>\n&gt; by CHARISMA!!!!........the ***&quot;CHARM&quot; LINE OF SPELLS ONLY***!!!!&gt;........<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     STRAIGHT FROM STRATICS ATRIBUTE PAGE!!!!      eqss.stratics.com<br/>\n&gt; &quot;WISDOM (Mana for Priests, Resistance to Mind Spells, Tertiary<br/>\n&gt; Skill Check)<br/>\n&gt; WIS is the mana determinant for the priestly casters, and their derived<br/>\n&gt; hybrids (Cleric, Shaman, Druid, Ranger, Paladin). It is bar none the most<br/>\n&gt; important stat for the former three classes and a consideration for the<br/>\n&gt; latter two. This attribute also affects your character&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; resistance against<br/>\n&gt; mind-affecting spells, such as Charm. In addition, WIS provides a last<br/>\n&gt; chance to succeed at a failed skill roll. Although INT is the secondary<br/>\n&gt; skill-up attribute for most skills, WIS may grant you to continue a failed<br/>\n&gt; skill roll. Minimal as the chance may be, it is still the opportunity to<br/>\n&gt; succeed on a roll one has already failed via skill check.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; INTELLIGENCE (Mana for Mages, Skill Gain)<br/>\n&gt; INT is the mana determinant for the non-priestly casters (Wizard,<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter,<br/>\n&gt; Magician, Necromancer), their derived hybrid (Shadowknight), and also<br/>\n&gt; determines how quickly one will gain skills. As such, it is<br/>\n&gt; important to all<br/>\n&gt; classes, but is especially so for the four non-priestly casters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; CHARISMA (Faction Standing, Merchant Prices, Charm Success)<br/>\n&gt; CHA affects NPC prices--when both buying and selling--and also<br/>\n&gt; how NPCs will<br/>\n&gt; react to you. While generally not a stat that most people raise,<br/>\n&gt; saving some<br/>\n&gt; hard-earned platinum on that plate breastplate is always a nice<br/>\n&gt; bonus. Also,<br/>\n&gt; CHA is almost the INT of faction. By having high CHA, you reduce<br/>\n&gt; the amount<br/>\n&gt; of faction you need to have NPCs change their view toward you.<br/>\n&gt; This can be a<br/>\n&gt; nice bonus when questing. It is also a factor for Charm spells, which<br/>\n&gt; notably affects the enchanter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;             OK so can we put this to rest until more thourough and<br/>\n&gt; conclusive information can be posted or studied?......please ppl<br/>\n&gt; we need sum<br/>\n&gt; new topics.......<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Neurosiz<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
