You can still attack the mob and increase your skills while<br/>\nsaving you from too much down time.  Why die when you don&#39;t have to?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, when you get up in level and things start hitting for 50+<br/>\ntwice a round, you won&#39;t be able to take damage of even a green /con much<br/>\nless something that will give you experience.  Your life at level 20 and up<br/>\nchanges dramatically.  While it is still possible to solo, it is definately<br/>\nmore difficult... the down time is just too long.  Now I almost always try<br/>\nto get a &quot;real pet&quot; (a PC fighter type) and I use charm when needed (on over<br/>\npulls).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a good party Charm is the best.  Lets say the puller mistakenly gets<br/>\nthree critters.  I Mes/Enthral the furthest away, Tashani and Charm the one<br/>\nnot engaged by the rest of the party, send the charmed pet against the<br/>\nengaged critter, sit and med while waiting for either the charm to break or<br/>\nthe enthralled critter to wake up.  Usually the engaged critter doesn&#39;t last<br/>\nlong so I send the charmed pet to the enthralled one.  Makes a diffucult<br/>\npull really easy.  We are the life of the party :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRizzin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
