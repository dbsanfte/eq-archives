Anyway,<br/>\njust in case its off, here are brief directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter entering from Kithicor, stick to the main path.  Now, when you get<br/>\nto a bridge, DO NOT CROSS.  The path continues if you look to the right.<br/>\nEventually you will reach a Y.  You can see buildings to the right, you<br/>\nwant to go left into the mines.  Cross through and you should come out<br/>\nin front of the keep.  In the mines, if I remember right, do not go<br/>\nthrough the square opening, go the other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis pretty much goes with what I see on the map.  Stay invised, do not<br/>\ncross the bridge, and stay away from orcs and gnolls.  Its not that hard<br/>\nto do.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Farr, Robert [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robert.farr@...\">robert.farr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, April 23, 1999 10:31 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Re: High Hold Pass<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Farr, Robert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robert.farr@...\">robert.farr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I get to the keep by going through the guard house?<br/>\n<br/>\nQinie, 8th Circle Enchantress<br/>\nMithaniel Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The bank is in the keep itself, which is another zone entirely.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Inside<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the keep is safe (unless your a dark elf) EXCEPT for the basement.<br/>\n&gt; Coincidently, the bank is in the basement, and is as far as I would go<br/>\n&gt; as all the hostiles conned red to me at 16.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDid you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nExplore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
