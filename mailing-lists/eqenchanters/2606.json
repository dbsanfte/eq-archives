If you are trying to get the faction I might recommend<br/>\ntossing a DoT on the mob, which will give you a damage point or two. As<br/>\nfor the DD spells, it is because our spells are all or nothing. Also you<br/>\ncan enthrall than nuke a mob, if it don&#39;t hit, the mob stays mezzed, if<br/>\nit does, the mobs wakes up and chases you down.
