Of course YOU live near all your friends and can call them up <br/>\nsaying let&#39;s all go to this server but everyone doesn&#39;t have that option... <br/>\nDO THEY? Think about it from a programming point of view, the transfering of <br/>\ncharacters would leave many many loopholes and whereas a program similar to <br/>\nuoextreme could jump in and give you 1000000 platium... hmm... You didn&#39;t <br/>\nthink things through did you? Okay, you still don&#39;t agree so here goes some <br/>\nmore... A new server comes up and everyone playing it is a newbie then all <br/>\nthe sudden verant let&#39;s us do this stupid server switching crap and <br/>\nblacksmiths go over there selling everything at 5 times the cost they could <br/>\nget on an established server. This would also let high level parties go to a <br/>\nnew server and camp all the huge monsters... Emporer Crush for example? <br/>\nLet&#39;s look a bit deeper... How would a guild be able to keep in contact? <br/>\nTalking between servers would cause ungodly 24 hour 7 days a week 365 days a <br/>\nyear LAG!!!!! Not to mention the constant character switching would cause <br/>\nmore lag therefore screwing up your playing anyways... So basically pick <br/>\nyour server and STICK TO IT!!!! Why are people always wanting to move? When <br/>\nI first started playing I picked the server with the least amouth of people <br/>\non it... Bertoxx, and it still remains towards the bottom of the server list <br/>\nand even if it had 2000 people playing all the time I would not switch <br/>\nbecause all my friends on that server... so thank you and sorry if it <br/>\nsounded like a flame because it was suppose to sound worse than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
