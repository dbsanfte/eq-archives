This means your going to have to make things that<br/>\nthe other players would like.  Things like Enchanted jewelry.  Since I can&#39;t<br/>\nmake any of the cool things yet, I havent made much money, except for once.<br/>\nI made a Silver Rose Engagement ring.  It costs about 15 gold to make and I<br/>\nsold it to another player for 2 platinums.  I have also been asked by other<br/>\nplayers if I could make them a ring that Increases strength.  I had to tell<br/>\nthem &quot;no not yet.&quot;  :(  Since in order to make something that increases<br/>\nstrenght I think you need a metal that is Electrum or better and combine it<br/>\nwith Onyx.  Not that skilled yet!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nSomething has been nagging me of late. Not that it would change anything in<br/>\nmy desire to master jewelry, but has any of you yet reached a skill level<br/>\nwhere you gained more money than you put in in the first place by using<br/>\nthis craft?.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
