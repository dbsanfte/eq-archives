Also depending on how they <br/>\ncoded it this could be a very major change to make.  If they left it in <br/>\nthen in the meantime they are granting an exploit.  The big picture is <br/>\nthis.  Who do they take care of first&gt;  The enchanters by leaving it as is <br/>\nuntil they can fix it or the rest of the player base by taking it out now? <br/>\n The majority rules so taking it out is the best move for the greatest <br/>\ngood. Don&#39;t call it lazy programming to get these spells off the PVP <br/>\nprocess, call it a regrettable need to serve the greatest good.  Oh and <br/>\ndon&#39;t go calling this just an enchanter nerf either.  That also shows <br/>\nnarrow focus instead of a view of the whole picture, were not the only <br/>\nones with these spells.<br/>\nAnd to say losing them reduces us to just poor nukers is really so much <br/>\nHyperbolae.  I doubt anyone  on this list believes that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI applaud and accept the change.<br/>\nNow if they don&#39;t fix it you can call that lazy programming if you want <br/>\nbut remember that working on this would cut back on programming resources <br/>\nelsewhere.  Our enchantments for  example.....<br/>\nProgramming resources are finite and have to be rationed somewhere.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t hear any qualified programmer&#39;s volunteering to pitch in for free on <br/>\nthis list.  Until you do watch the rock throwing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRic R &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:redr@...\">redr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n11/17/99 08:35 AM<br/>\nPlease respond to eqenchanters<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n        To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n        cc: <br/>\n        Subject:        Re: [eqenchanters] Latest nerf<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ric R &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:redr@...\">redr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYup, Dispell only works on another player if they are grouped with you <br/>\nnow.<br/>\nAgain a lazy change for this is great on all levels cept +PvP server where<br/>\nsomeone wants to fight. Heck our lvl 50 Cleric took on 2 lvl 50 necros,<br/>\nkilled one and sent the other running with  bub of health left thanks to<br/>\nthis change.
