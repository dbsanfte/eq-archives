I found if you are in skel form and invis undead only werebats will go \nafter you. I have not died there since I started doing that, in fact I walk all \nover the house unscathed ,except the basement =p.. I&#39;ve been to ct and guk but \nit&#39;s almost impossible to get a group in those areas, may just be a bertoxx \nthing... Anyway if you got the patience to learn the in and out of unrest you \ncan lvl fast and rule the area, people will beg you to join their groups. I \nactually get swamped with tells when I log on and zone into unrest =).. Do what \nyou think is best for you though, and have fun =)...</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"freya@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">Jenni</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"eqenchanters@onelist.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Monday, March 27, 2000 9:09 \nAM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [eqenchanters] Where to \n  go...</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>From:</tt> <tt>Jenni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>&gt;</tt> <br><br><tt>Hi \n  guys!<br><br>I&#39;m real close to lvl 24 now and I&#39;m wondering where I should be \n  fighting.<br>I&#39;m loving permafrost, but I want to move on soon.&nbsp; (Don&#39;t \n  even say<br>Highkeep, I hate that place.. :) ).&nbsp; I checked out Sol A, but \n  there<br>weren&#39;t enough people there at the time that could group with me \n  (mostly<br>lvl 35 and up).&nbsp; the mobs there looked great, and I found a \n  couple nice<br>places to set up camp, but it might be tough to get a group \n  going in that<br>situation.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?&nbsp; I&#39;m really \n  loving the dungeon scene.<br>big pulls, mez, and tons of exp and good \n  loot.&nbsp; Anybody have any favorite<br>dungeons that would be good for my \n  level? :)<br><br>Thanks!<br>Ezrae Dreamstealer<br>Lvl 23 DE \n  Enchantress<br>Brell Serilis<br><br></tt>\n  <hr>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/2600/5/_/451658/_/954173327/\">\n  <center><img height=\"60\" alt=\"\"\n src=\"https://ec.yimg.com/ec?url=http%3A%2F%2Fadimg.egroups.com%2Fimg%2F2600%2F5%2F_%2F451658%2F_%2F954173327%2Ffree_tshirt_online_banner.gif&t=1564900110&sig=MBaMpfiQwu5kOuupqu55IA--~E\"\n width=\"468\" border=\"0\"></center>\n  <center><font color=\"white\"></font></center></a>\n  <hr>\n</blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
