I suggest making a decent pet and hanging around not too too<br/>\nfar away from the city entrance in the Warslik Woods, killing hundreds and<br/>\nhundreds of the little goblins that frequent the area.  They are extremely<br/>\nplentiful, and even the whelps provide faction with both the Legion of<br/>\nCalibis and Firona Vie.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re feeling these are too weak, you can always go to the other goblin<br/>\ncamps between the overthere and calibis (in Warslik woods).  At one camp, a<br/>\ngoblin will spawn names Dragoth(?) the Destroyer, which conned yellow to a<br/>\nlevel 32 ranger that came by after me and a friend were slaughtered by him<br/>\nand were sitting around contemplating what to do about him.  Let me know if<br/>\nyou want more particulars about this goblin... he&#39;s an easy spawn to find<br/>\nand also easy to make appear after not much time... you just need to be in<br/>\nthe right area.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also some Iksar bandit camps in this zone, but you will lose<br/>\nfaction with another faction which I believe is the shadowknight guild in<br/>\ncalibis, although you still gain factions with the Legions of Calibis.<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg - RZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Shawn Alley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shawna@...\">shawna@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 24, 2000 4:11 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqenchanters] Return of an Enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; spittin mad:<br/>\n&gt; Illusion Iksar - The Iksar can see right through it making this spell<br/>\nalmost<br/>\n&gt; useless in it&#39;s current form.

Just<br/>\nwent<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; out and bought a copy of the original game-my computer isn&#39;t smart enough<br/>\n&gt; 166/32mb/4mb vid card-and I&#39;m wondering about the optional files offered<br/>\n&gt; when you first start up a copy of the game and click the &#39;play online&#39;<br/>\n&gt; button.(Not talking about the register Kunark button) I&#39;m wondering if<br/>\nthese<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; files are too much for my computer too handle, system spec wise, and what<br/>\n&gt; they happen to contain.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And yes, I&#39;m still going to play an Enchanter, again, even knowing how<br/>\n&gt; annoying the class can be. I can&#39;t help it, Enchanters are without a doubt<br/>\n&gt; the iconoclastic class in the game, the enigma to many, and seeing the<br/>\nmana<br/>\n&gt; speed up spells I&#39;m sure one of the most bothered classes-a&#39;la SoW-in the<br/>\n&gt; game, which is fine with me most times because I love chatting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And Since I haven&#39;t played in about a year, I&#39;ll try to start up a debate!<br/>\n&gt; What are the best and worst changes to the Enchanters as of late? What<br/>\nmakes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; you spittin mad and what makes you want to never give up the class??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; qrentqent aka<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mezma Dark Elf Enchanter L3, Seventh Hammer<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/8/_/451658/_/959209564/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4054/8/_/451658/_/959209564/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Find long lost high school friends:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4056/8/_/451658/_/959210013/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4056/8/_/451658/_/959210013/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
