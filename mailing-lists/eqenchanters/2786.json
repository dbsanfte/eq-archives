Other spots to<br/>\ncheck are Highkeep, Lost Temple of Cazic Thule, and the lower level areas of<br/>\nLower Guk. Just walk into the zone and /auction for em, will come to you,<br/>\nclarity included (if you are level 29 already). Offer two or three plat<br/>\neach, more if you really desperate.  Also, check vendors EVERYWHERE. I&#39;ve<br/>\nbought more level 44 research items off of vendors already than I ever found<br/>\nof 39 stuff hunting in Lower Guk and Sol B. I also advertise regularly in my<br/>\nguild precisely what items I need which I have found is the best way to get<br/>\nthem. The main thing is to let people know what you need because if it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t sell to a vendor for more than FS will, most people will just poof<br/>\nit or let it rot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi ~Hand of Chaos~, level 42, CT<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 6 Jul 2000 17:04:49 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Mindseye&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mindseye@...\">mindseye@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Feed Back<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi..<br/>\n&gt;    Anyone no where I con find the research pages for the Feed Back shield.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve got lots of Vel 109 pages but can&#39;t seem to find 108 or even faded<br/>\npages.
