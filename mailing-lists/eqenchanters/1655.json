If you are crafting items<br/>\nmerely for the skill gain involved you are better off starting electrum in<br/>\nthe high 30&#39;s. Even though the fail rate is slightly higher, the cost of<br/>\nfailing an electrum/malachite bracer is 2p 7g, while the cost of failing a<br/>\nsilver/pearl ring is 5p 3g. You will be failing the electrum/malachite more<br/>\noften, but not twice as often as the silver/pearl. The cost disparity only<br/>\ngets greater as you climb up the stone ladder with silver...<br/>\n<br/>\n---------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I know ... I&#39;ve heard that from others, too, but I can get less failures<br/>\n&gt; and more money back from NPCs by doing it this way, plus my guildmembers<br/>\n&gt; like those +disease/+ac necklaces :).  I love the thrill of making truly<br/>\n&gt; new jewelry with gems I&#39;ve never worked with before (and probably won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; again).

At a skill of 38 I had about a 50% success rate <br/>\n&gt; with electrum/malachite which was cheaper than a 70% success rate with <br/>\n&gt; silver/pearl.
