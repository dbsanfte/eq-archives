A Charm s ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-410495217\">The great debate. Charm is wonderful for controlling a bad situation, but it<br/>\ncan be very dangerous to use solo (very effective when it works).  A Charm&#39;s<br/>\nduration, as I understand it, is a random time determined when you cast on a<br/>\ncritter and based your the critter&#39;s level, your level and your CHR.  Every<br/>\n&quot;round&quot; there after the critter get a &quot;roll&quot; to see if they break the charm<br/>\n(again based on their level, your level and your CHR).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no set length however.  I experimented with Orc Pawns in EC when I<br/>\nwas around level 16.  I have about a 110 CHR at the time (not very good by<br/>\nthe way).  Duration was everything from 2 seconds to 5 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nRizzin Diamoure<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jenni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 30, 1999 1:37 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Charm question:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Jenni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m level 12 and I just got Charm and I&#39;m wondering if the duration will<br/>\n&gt; increase as I go up in level?  I know charisma is an important factor<br/>\n&gt; for this spell, and right now, with all my charisma gear on I have about<br/>\n&gt; 99 chr.  Right now Charm only lasts a few seconds, not long enough to do<br/>\n&gt; anything useful with it..  Should I just hold on to it for a few levels<br/>\n&gt; and use it later?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ezrae<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
