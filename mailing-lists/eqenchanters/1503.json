Just so you know...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a side issue I have given up on ever trying to achieve standardised<br/>\n&gt; pricing.  It just will never happen.  EQ is a very different tradeskill<br/>\n&gt; related game since so many people trade magic items for their wares, and<br/>\n&gt; currency can come in many many forms of equipment.  I am now a follower of<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;if both sides are happy&quot; principle.  To me if both people are happy in<br/>\n&gt; a trade then good for them.  But trying to force people to use standard<br/>\n&gt; prices simply will not happen - I have tried on my server and people just<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t listen - good thing only two of us can work in plat right now heh.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; baels<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has 180,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
