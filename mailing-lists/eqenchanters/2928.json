Ran a shadow knight from 1-8<br/>\n&gt;just to take a break.<br/>\n&gt;Tonight my lv 25 enchanter will be at Castle Mistmoore for the<br/>\n&gt;Halloween bash (Our guild, the Nameless of Norath, on the nameless<br/>\n&gt;server, is hosting a server wide raid).  I need somewhere interesting<br/>\n&gt;and good for growth to hunt. But with enough people to not spend a<br/>\n&gt;long time standing around looking for a group.

I<br/>\nthought it was one of the better zones in the game, and certainly<br/>\ninside the castle itself one of the prettiest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now it&#39;s just empty whenever I go to play, and with nothing<br/>\nsuitable nearby and not being able to gate around the world, I can&#39;t<br/>\nreally go anymore :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nA good alternative I also enjoyed was inside Cazic Thule.  A great<br/>\nplace to really get into proper mezzing and develop those skills<br/>\nnicely!!  Can have some bad trains when it&#39;s busy though, but pick<br/>\nyour spot carefully and you&#39;ll be safe.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMelaniel, Wood Elf Bard (48)    &quot;Flirting is a girl&#39;s best friend&quot;<br/>\nKalara, Enchanter (37)          &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT ....&quot;<br/>\nTura, Dark Elf Necromancer (10) &quot;Jobantik, you really smell!&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
