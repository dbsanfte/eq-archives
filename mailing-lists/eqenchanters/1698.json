I don&#39;t think I<br/>\ncould have ever done enough damage to kill an Orc Centurian.  Featherweight<br/>\nwould be very cool but would help others a lot more than us.  They would<br/>\nhave to give us something REALLY good to make up for taking away our pets if<br/>\nthey decided to do that. Although I can see it in one place.  The Race Wars<br/>\nserver.  We will RULE the race war server.  With the ablitity to blind,<br/>\nroot, and change forms we can effectivly be that assassins of the Race War.<br/>\nThat, or if you choose we are the only class that can travel anywhere and<br/>\nnot be attacked as some as someone sees us.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark<br/>\n<br/>\nAmazing $14,000 Opportunity.
