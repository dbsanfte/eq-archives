I dont<br/>\n&gt; believe it is a good investment to lower your int to gain more<br/>\n&gt; charisma since at this point and having done some tests it seems to<br/>\n&gt; me that it all pretty much works the same after 150 charisma.<br/>\n&gt; However, if you can improve it without sacrificing INT by all means<br/>\n&gt; do so.  In the end, I suppose it is all a moot point if you can get<br/>\n&gt; to 200 int, 200 cha.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
