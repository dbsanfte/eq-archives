At the moment I&#39;m fighting in the High<br/>\nKeep basement against the picklaws and AE is out.  I can successfully use<br/>\ncolor flux 5 out of 6 times, but that 6th time the guards come and at the<br/>\nvery least hang around and make our lives difficult and at worst kill me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is standard enchanter fare - occassionally I get a gob on me and<br/>\nneed to mez.  Normally *BAM* Color Flux, step back, mez, no problem.<br/>\nWithout color flux I&#39;m having to just stand there and take it and keep<br/>\npounding the mez key until one gets through.  Is there no better<br/>\nalternative?<br/>\n<br/>\nChiming - 22nd enchanter on druzzil ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
