Enthrall target. If not resisted,<br/>\ntashini, languid pace, disempower then med till enthrall breaks, right at<br/>\nedge of spell casting range. Cast choke as it comes in, let it hit me so the<br/>\npet gets on it, cast whirl at down 2 bubbles of health and back off. Recast<br/>\nwhirl is it comes at me, toss in a DD as mana available. Shouldn&#39;t be too<br/>\ndifficult to find a group doing harriers at 21 either. Me and a necro could<br/>\nsolo a harrier at 22. No clue on Kunark zones under 35. I did treants till<br/>\n29, only druids you get KOS with are the ones in Surefall Glade and at East<br/>\nand North Karana druid rings, have had no problems at any of the other druid<br/>\nrings. When I need to be ported to North K by a druid I just invis myself<br/>\nfor the ride. Did the end of 29, 30, and into 31 in HighKeep, spent the rest<br/>\nof 31 and some of 32 in Unrest in the ghost room. Went to Cazic till I was<br/>\n34 (look for archon base or top groups or grid (sewer) groups). Hit Lguk at<br/>\n34 and been there since, almost 45 now and doing my magic in Lord room.<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi ~Hand of Chaos~ CT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
