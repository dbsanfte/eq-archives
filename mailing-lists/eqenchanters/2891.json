Watch for the<br/>\nminotaur hero who comes out to that area and will kill you quickly.

You&#39;ll find challenges here up<br/>\nto level 22 or so.  Some of the other Kunark newbie areas (Warsliks, Lake<br/>\nof Ill Omen) are also pretty sweet.  The only problem is you can&#39;t use<br/>\nCabilis facilities until L20, so take a lot of supplies to last you<br/>\nbetween trips to the evil outpost or FV.<br/>\n--<br/>\nMark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
