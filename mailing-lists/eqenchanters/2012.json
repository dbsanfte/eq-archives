The reason is that they leveld<br/>\ntoo fast and did not get to learn the intricacies of<br/>\ntheir new class.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 34 with my enchanter I took a break to play a<br/>\ndruid.  Of course I dressed that druid very well and<br/>\nhit level 20 within a couple of weeks, playing solo<br/>\nall the while.  Around level 20 you hit the point<br/>\nwhere you need to group to make adequate progress.  I<br/>\ndid not know how to play in a group as a healer, so I<br/>\nwent back to my enchanter.  I&#39;m at level 45 now with<br/>\nthe enchanter and doubt that I will go back to that<br/>\ntwinked druid.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven still, I don&#39;t consider twinking to be cheating. <br/>\nI earned all of that equipment.  Now players buying<br/>\nstuff on EBAY...  that&#39;s a different issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ<br/>\n--- Paul Jesernig &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwj@...\">pwj@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Twink: To give items or cash to a player of a level<br/>\n&gt; who would have<br/>\n&gt; absolutely no chance of getting them at that level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I personnally have never looked at twinking as<br/>\n&gt; cheating, more just of<br/>\n&gt; shortcutting. I do tend to avoid playing with<br/>\n&gt; twinked people as I have found<br/>\n&gt; that most of them can&#39;t play for squat. They tend to<br/>\n&gt; consider themselves<br/>\n&gt; invulnerable, as most monsters near their level are<br/>\n&gt; quite easy to kill. At<br/>\n&gt; some point (Brad has said this and I have seen it in<br/>\n&gt; action), the monsters<br/>\n&gt; you are fighting catch up to whatever gear you have,<br/>\n&gt; and then you must rely<br/>\n&gt; on teamwork and play skill to survive. And if the<br/>\n&gt; twinkees (generally) had<br/>\n&gt; that to begin with, they could go out and get level<br/>\n&gt; appropriate gear and<br/>\n&gt; survive. &lt;gets down off his soapbox and awaits the<br/>\n&gt; flames while waiting for<br/>\n&gt; an on topic thread to start&gt;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So now that the lifetap spells of necro&#39;s are<br/>\n&gt; resistable, are people finding<br/>\n&gt; it even easier to find a group?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Thu, 4 Nov 1999 19:37:33 -0900<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: Brian Pifer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bpifer@...\">bpifer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: Twinking / was : Welcome to<br/>\n&gt; eqenchanters@oneli st.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Twinking is having one of your high level<br/>\n&gt; characters gain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; equipment/items/money and then transfer it to one<br/>\n&gt; of your lower level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; characters.
