The main damage","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1751973765\">I&#39;ve tried it a bit at 18th against blue mobs (aqua gobs to be specific)<br/>\nand found out it was possible. Expect to run a lot more though :).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe main damage dealer is now our DOT (chocke in that case), and a huge<br/>\namount of color flux. The strategy I used was :<br/>\n<br/>\n\t- Choke the mob to pull it <br/>\n\t- Tashan it (best if you can do it while the mob is on the way)<br/>\n\t- Color flux after being engaged<br/>\n\t- Root then Mez the beast (enthrall looked too expensive). Let DOT do his<br/>\nstuff<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQuick med from a safe distance. Once DOT is over, start again or use San<br/>\nwarp & wpn to end its misery. Since I was in cauldron I couldn&#39;t use fear<br/>\nor chase the moon strategy for obvious reasons. The important spell is<br/>\ncolor flux as its so fast you can use it even engaged (but make sure you<br/>\nare not attacking the beast though). <br/>\n<br/>\n\tOf course there is still the old reliable Charm to use if you can spot two<br/>\nblue beasts nearby. The charmed mob then act as our pet. And flux can help<br/>\nif it wears off.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThings which can go wrong : <br/>\n- Other mobs engage you. Flux and run like hell<br/>\n- Mob unroot while you med and decides to go see someplace else<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs I started this I would like to emphasize again the loss of pet line is<br/>\nonly something I came up with as an example should Verant decides to take<br/>\nsomething out of us in exchange of a meaningful &#39;enchantment&#39; line of<br/>\nspells and ask us our view. Better offer Verant something we -players-<br/>\ndiscussed first hand before crying foul after they put new code into place. <br/>\n\t\t<br/>\nIbnabeth/karana<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 07:20 23/07/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Manuel Revilla&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manuel.revilla@...\">manuel.revilla@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just for the sake of discussion then: Can an enchanter solo without a pet?<br/>\n&gt;at all levels? and If so, with what tactics? What have you all tested?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wouldn&#39;t be willing to loose the extremely useful pet series of spells<br/>\n&gt;until I can figure out how to make up for the loss of the &quot;baby tank&quot; in<br/>\n&gt;combat. To me it is what makes soloing bearable. Lets face it, while I would<br/>\n&gt;prefer to be in a group, there are times where it is either solo or don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
