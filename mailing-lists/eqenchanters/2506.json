Tho you can use a pet as well.<br/>\nBut it is true that we are extremely powerful solo classes, I can break<br/>\nalmost any spawn solo save for a few of the really mean ones. You can break<br/>\nand camp virtually any camp in lower guk (still havent done King, Lord, or<br/>\nFrenzy solo tho). But I have done sage, magi, hand, and even cleared live<br/>\ntower and solod the crusader and priest (the entire tower had to be cleared)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeafuries are always fun and easy to solo. THe reason i dont recommend<br/>\nsoloing is because of efficiency. In a party an enchanter/cleric combo will<br/>\nget you the most xp in the least amount of time. In a good party who knows<br/>\nwhat they are doing, you never have to stop pulling. Because all the mobs<br/>\nare mesd, the cleric is only healing 1 party member, and losing little mana.<br/>\nDowntime is very rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo i recommend partying since an enchanter amplifies a groups power, wait<br/>\ntil you are level 40-50 to solo and amaze you friends =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Maelael, 50th Enchanter, Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
