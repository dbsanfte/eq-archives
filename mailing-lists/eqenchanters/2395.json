(and no matter what you cast) tashan, tashani,<br/>\ntashania...<br/>\n&gt; is seems the Mobs  tend to like you alot...  but only if i&#39;m the first the<br/>\n&gt; cast....  (this is without any taunt type spells cast on it). has anyone<br/>\n&gt; else noticed this or am i dreamin?  hehe<br/>\n&gt;    One last this i really like this e-mail list it helps me get more info<br/>\n&gt; than anyother place due to real applications of things said... thanks guys<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Chantisis Tashania<br/>\n&gt;   Rodcet Nife &lt;Luna Imperium&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; FREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
