If its a tough mob, a languid pace, and or enfeeble<br/>\n&gt;5.  Now I tend to melee the monster a bit to keep my pet alive.  Since<br/>\n&gt;it has a languid pace on it, its not going to hit me often. I try and<br/>\n&gt;keep a balance between using mana and health.  More mana of course as<br/>\n&gt;its much easier to recover.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Finishing strategies<br/>\n&gt;1.  Second choke.  Its usually fatal after a few seconds<br/>\n&gt;2.

The risk is you need to know the<br/>\n&gt;running patterns of the monster, it running through a camp will get you<br/>\n&gt;killed.<br/>\n&gt;4.  whirl. I generally save this for tough battles with harder hitting<br/>\n&gt;stuff.  Very effective when followed by a choke<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Other tips.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Stand well back when you cast, as it really ups how much the monster<br/>\n&gt;hates you. (Choke causes much less hate than the less powerful chaotic<br/>\n&gt;feedback for some reason)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Know where the zone is at all times.  Its always possible for another<br/>\n&gt;monster to jump in, and the best defence there is knowing where to run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mesmerization - use this if two mosters jump you.  Then hit the other<br/>\n&gt;monster hard with the damage spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Soothe - learn how to use this effectively on camps.
