So, at level 10 for<br/>\nexample the skill cap for our magic skills is (10 + 1) x 5 = 55.  The skill<br/>\ncap for our melee skills (and probly offense/defense?) at level 10 is (10 +<br/>\n1) x 3 = 33.  This helps explain why we can&#39;t solo as easily at higher<br/>\nlevels.  You can be sure NPC melee types get better than (level + 1) x 5<br/>\ncaps for their levels.  I&#39;ve never seen numbers on this before but I&#39;d guess<br/>\nthey&#39;re more like (level + 1) x 8.
