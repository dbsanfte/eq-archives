So,<br/>\nI have a few questions...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t1) Is there a list somewhere of spells that are unimplemented or<br/>\njust plain worthless?  I have heard rumors that the faction adjustment<br/>\nspells such as Alliance do not actually do anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t2) I have heard many problems with regards to tougher monsters<br/>\nresisting spells.  Is this only apparent at higher levels?  I am currently<br/>\n5th level, and while my spells are resisted occasionally, I can still affect<br/>\nred creatures reasonably.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThanks for your help, in advance.  I&#39;m trying to tell if I&#39;m going<br/>\nto regret the time I spend advancing my character in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t--Fayen, currently of Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n|  Daniel E Andersen      | &quot;Life...
