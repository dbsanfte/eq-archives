Its a little mana intensive until you get a few levels under your<br/>\nbelt.  Plus my animation seems to miss a lot when in chase mode.  If you use<br/>\nthis tactic during your early years, watch that mana bar.  You may be in for a<br/>\nwhole world of hurt when that mob kills your pet, grabs some friends and heads<br/>\nback while you are banging your gate hotkey.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You have insufficient mana to cast that spell&quot;  AARRRGGGHHH.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; When soloing always use an animation (later on you can use charm instead)...<br/>\n&gt; they are your main damage dealer.  They can&#39;t take much damage so you need<br/>\n&gt; to watch them closely.  One of the best things about being an Enchanter is<br/>\n&gt; that you have many options.  This is one such option at level 4:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Start with Tashan from a distance and follow ASAP with Suffocating Sphere<br/>\n&gt; before the critter reaches you (you can usually get both spells off if you<br/>\n&gt; are far enough away).    The critter should be on you and your animation on<br/>\n&gt; the critter, so back off a bit and let your pet tank.  Next debuf the<br/>\n&gt; critter futher with Enfeeblement (this strength debuf along with the DOT<br/>\n&gt; strength debuf will lower the average total damage the critter will do).<br/>\n&gt; Now just wait (med if you want to) and watch your animation&#39;s health... tank<br/>\n&gt; for it when needed.  When the critter is  almost dead cast your DOT again to<br/>\n&gt; finish it off (or if your Evocation is high enough use your DD).  I&#39;m making<br/>\n&gt; the assumtion you&#39;ve already buffed yourself and your Animation before this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another option in a safe area is to follow the same line except cast fear<br/>\n&gt; when you&#39;re done debuffing... the pet will follow and hit the critter while<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s running away.  Rinse and repeat until dead.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many more strategies can be found at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rizzin Diamoure<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
