Green cons consistantly<br/>\n&gt;resist Sanity Warp, the same monsters that I killed with Chaotic Feedback<br/>\n&gt;when they were blue cons. I have begun using Tashan again (Ever since level<br/>\n&gt;10 or so, I stopped using it), and Tashan seems to help the situation. I<br/>\n&gt;just think it is strange that I am having such a problem with monsters<br/>\n&gt;resisting more powerful spells, when lesser spells seemed to work on them<br/>\n&gt;great at lower levels. For instance, wisps now con green, but often resist<br/>\n&gt;Sanity Warp. I was murdering wisps with Chaotic Feedback just two levels<br/>\n&gt;ago. Same thing is happening with monsters I am just now starting to fight<br/>\n&gt;alot, like crocs in the Oasis, undead in Unrest, and Borer and Scythe<br/>\n&gt;Beetles in the Karanas. I am at a loss.
