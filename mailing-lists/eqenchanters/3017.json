I&#39;ve cut-n-pasted it in it&#39;s entirety<br/>\nso<br/>\n&gt; that the proper person gets the credit.  This is great stuff and I thought<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d share it again with the group.<br/>\n&gt; ===============================================<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Nathan Dunning&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nathand@...\">nathand@...</a>&gt; wrote in message<br/>\nnews:&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:38a29e50.225666236@...\">38a29e50.225666236@...</a>&gt;...<br/>\n&gt; For a long time, necromancers have had the reputation as the ultimate<br/>\n&gt; in evil professions.  They consort with dark powers, torture the<br/>\n&gt; living, and enslave the dead.  They even use strange vampiric powers<br/>\n&gt; to suck the life force right out of another person.  The epitome of<br/>\n&gt; pure evil, right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not so fast.  When you look at the true picture, you see something<br/>\n&gt; vastly different.  Necromancers aren&#39;t the true evil in this world -<br/>\n&gt; Enchanters are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lets look at some examples of evil-doing by necromancers, and see the<br/>\n&gt; myriad of ways that enchanters outdo them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First, there&#39;s the pet thing.  Necromancers, the grubby little<br/>\n&gt; bastards, will gleefully pull your dear old Uncle Fred out of the<br/>\n&gt; grave and turn him into their everlasting slave.  But really, Uncle<br/>\n&gt; Fred wasn&#39;t busy right then, and might appreciate the chance to walk<br/>\n&gt; around a little and get some exercise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Meanwhile, the innocent enchanter in the corner charms you, and has<br/>\n&gt; you methodically slaughter the rest of the family. And the neighbors.<br/>\n&gt; And maybe even little Timmy down the street.  And then, to put the<br/>\n&gt; evil little cherry on top, the enchanter will wait for the charm to<br/>\n&gt; drop, watch the horrified expression cross your face as you realize<br/>\n&gt; what you&#39;ve done, and then kill you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second, damage spells.  Here the necromancer has a wide variety of<br/>\n&gt; ways to kill you.  He can infect you with a disease, poison you, cause<br/>\n&gt; your blood to heat up, mess with your heart, and even turn you into a<br/>\n&gt; skeleton.  None of these are a particularly pleasant way to die,<br/>\n&gt; certainly much worse than getting incinerated by a mage or frozen by a<br/>\n&gt; wizard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But the enchanter is no slouch in the agonizing death department,<br/>\n&gt; either.  He&#39;s got two main attack forms.  The first is to choke you to<br/>\n&gt; death, slowly and agonizingly (think Darth Vadar in the beginning of<br/>\n&gt; Star Wars).  The second is to fire a bolt of pure energy into your<br/>\n&gt; target&#39;s brain, causing blinding spikes of pain to flare throughout<br/>\n&gt; the victim.  And then, the enchanter waits for the pain to almost<br/>\n&gt; completely abate, and the poor victim to believe they&#39;re free of the<br/>\n&gt; torture, before he/she fires off another bolt of agonizing energy<br/>\n&gt; (think the Emperor at the end of Return of the Jedi).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Third, the Vampirism issue.  True, necromancers have a wide variety of<br/>\n&gt; spells that steal their victim&#39;s health or energy and give them to the<br/>\n&gt; caster.  But this is counterbalanced by the wide variety of spells<br/>\n&gt; they have to give their very own vital health and energy to other<br/>\n&gt; people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Meanwhile the enchanter also has spells to drain others of energy.<br/>\n&gt; However, unlike the necromancer&#39;s eco-friendly spells, the enchanter<br/>\n&gt; carelessly disregards the energy he siphons.  This uncontrolled energy<br/>\n&gt; release straight into the environment is clearly the cause of the<br/>\n&gt; environmental shifts seen recently in Norrath, particularly the<br/>\n&gt; rainfall in the deserts and the increased fog banks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fourth, the &quot;consorting with dark powers&quot; accusation.  This is a PR<br/>\n&gt; issue for necromancers.  I mean, calling a spell dark pact has<br/>\n&gt; negative connotations while calling the same basic spell, say,<br/>\n&gt; cannibalize doesn&#39;t.  Or calling a spell snare instead of clinging<br/>\n&gt; darkness.  If the necromancers would pony up some of that hard earned<br/>\n&gt; loot for a good PR firm, this problem could be fixed in a heartbeat.<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, the average necromancer is too much of a loner to work<br/>\n&gt; well in a group fix this issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now we get to some of the real evil that enchanters do.  It starts<br/>\n&gt; with the illusions.  Who wants a grubby little high elf peasant scum<br/>\n&gt; to visit their home in the better parts of Neriak?  Spying on them,<br/>\n&gt; chatting up their friends, and generally making a nuisance of<br/>\n&gt; themselves.  Keeping the high elf riffraff out is, after all, what we<br/>\n&gt; pay the guards to do. But the illusions render our poor, underpaid<br/>\n&gt; guards incapable of doing their job and keeping the lower classes in<br/>\n&gt; their proper place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last but certainly not least, is the most insidiously evil set of<br/>\n&gt; spells the enchanter has at his/her disposal.  I refer, of course, to<br/>\n&gt; the mind-altering spells.  These come in two basic forms, the &quot;memory<br/>\n&gt; wipe&quot; and the &quot;attitude adjustment&quot;.  The memory wipe will allow the<br/>\n&gt; enchanter to erase the memory of all of the pain and suffering they<br/>\n&gt; have caused you, usually so they can do it again at a later date.<br/>\n&gt; The attitude adjustment, actually a sophisticated form of<br/>\n&gt; brainwashing, will cause you to be aware of the enchanter&#39;s action,<br/>\n&gt; but to rationalize them away. (Little Timmy was rude. He deserved to<br/>\n&gt; be slaughtered.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now you realize the true depths of the enchanter&#39;s evil.  Of course,<br/>\n&gt; is doesn&#39;t really matter, as the Attitude Adjustment Team will be<br/>\n&gt; knocking on your door shortly, and you won&#39;t remember a word of this<br/>\n&gt; essay, except that enchanters are the best thing to ever happen to<br/>\n&gt; Norrath.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Braediil, Dark Elf Enchanter of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
