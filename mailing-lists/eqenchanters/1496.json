It was<br/>\nposted but isn&#39;t linked right now for some reason.  Check out his site if<br/>\nyou haven&#39;t already as it is very useful and he puts alot of time/effort<br/>\ninto it I think.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/\">http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you think you want to sell cheap jewelry?<br/>\nAzara, level 8 high elf enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed a disturbing trend where jewelry prices are falling as more<br/>\nenchanters delve into jewelcraft now that it has been revamped.  Using my<br/>\ntrusty jewelcraft chart (thank you EQ Enchanters) it is easy for me to<br/>\ncalculate what an items base cost is and charge accordingly.  The problem is<br/>\nmany people are selling the same items for just a tad more than base cost.<br/>\nHere is an example:<br/>\n<br/>\n+2 Strength rings = 3125c<br/>\namber = 2p6g2s5c or 2625c<br/>\nsilver bar = 5g or 500c + time to enchant (about half my mana per bar)<br/>\n<br/>\nI sell these for 6p or 2 for 10p.  I know some people sell them for 5p which<br/>\nis OK just not my choice of price.  The people that bother me are those that<br/>\nsell for 4p or less.  Even at 4p there is a profit of only 9g per ring.<br/>\nThis brings me to my next problem (which is related): why do we fail SO MANY<br/>\ntimes on items that are trivial to us?  It makes no sense to fail a<br/>\nsignificant amount of time on a jewel/metal combination that is trivial.  If<br/>\nthere is no skill gain possible why not lower the chance of failure (about 5<br/>\nfold)?  I wear two +2 wisdom rings when working to raise my wisdom and<br/>\nhopefully lower my chance of failure.  At any rate with a jewelcraft skill<br/>\nof around 40 I failed 4 times in a row with amber (a worst case I think), a<br/>\nloss of about 12.5p.<br/>\n<br/>\n3125c per attempt * 4 failures = 12500c<br/>\n9g profit per ring = 13 - 14 extra rings to make up losses (assuming no more<br/>\nlosses)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone so let&#39;s look at the 4p stength ring again.  Assuming<br/>\nI make 9g per ring and then have 4 failures costing me 12.5p total, how many<br/>\nsold rings does this equal?  About 14 rings!  And this is just to break even<br/>\nassuming you have only those 4 failures (plus no more failures on the 14 to<br/>\nmake up for the previous failures).  Additionally, forgetting the 4 failures<br/>\nfor a second, by selling so cheaply you are setting yourself up for more<br/>\nfailures because you will need to make and sell more rings to build up a<br/>\ndecent amount of money.  But, the failure ratio is the same whether you sell<br/>\nhigh and create a few rings or sell low and create a lot of rings.  Let&#39;s<br/>\nassume a 30% failure rate (sad but true sometimes) for worst case and let&#39;s<br/>\nsay I want to amass 10p profits.<br/>\n<br/>\n# RINGS REQUIRED to AMASS 10p<br/>\nfailure rate = 30%<br/>\nselling at 4p get 9g profit ea:<br/>\n11 rings w/o failures - my target is to make 11 rings then<br/>\n11 * 30% fail rate = 3 failures<br/>\n3 remakes * 30% fail rate = 1 additional failure or remake (which hopefully<br/>\nwon&#39;t fail again!)<br/>\nSo, to make 10p profit you need to sell 11 rings w/o failures but we WILL<br/>\nhave failures.<br/>\nBut, we see statistically that we may fail 4 times for an additional cost of<br/>\n12.5p.<br/>\nSelling our 11 rings for 4p ea we get 44p.<br/>\nSubtract the cost to make: 11 * 3.1p = 34.1p<br/>\nSubtract the cost of failures: 4 * 3.1p = 12.4p<br/>\nTotal cost to make: 46.5p!!!!!<br/>\nResulting &quot;Profit&quot;: 2.5p LOSS<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you see???  You LOST money after making all those rings.  You went and<br/>\ncollected the jewels, enchanted the metal, and got yourself to level 8 so<br/>\nthat you can enchant and then you gave the jewelry away.....<br/>\n<br/>\nNow let&#39;s look at selling 6p per ring.<br/>\n# RINGS REQUIRED to AMASS 10p<br/>\nfailure rate = 30%<br/>\nselling at 6p get 2.9p profit ea:<br/>\n4 rings w/o failures<br/>\n4 * 30% fail rate = 1 failures or 1 remake (which hopefully won&#39;t fail<br/>\nagain!)<br/>\nSo, to make 10p profit you need to sell 4 rings w/o failures.<br/>\nBut, we see statistically that we may fail 1 time for a cost of 3.1p.<br/>\nSelling our 4 rings for 6p ea we get 24p.<br/>\nSubtract the cost to make: 4 * 3.1p = 12.4p<br/>\nSubtract the cost of failures: 1 * 3.1p = 3.1p<br/>\nTotal cost to make: 15.6p<br/>\nResulting profit: about 10p<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to summarize:<br/>\nDon&#39;t undersell your competitors if they are already selling for a<br/>\nreasonable price.<br/>\nThere is no bonus for ramping up production.  Your fail rate is constant.<br/>\nTherefore the more you make the more you will fail.<br/>\nYou will fail some of the time.  You need to make enough profit to pay for<br/>\nthe failures.<br/>\nPeople want better jewelry which comes from higher priced gems.  You will<br/>\nneed LOTS more money to try them.<br/>\nIf you sell for too low a price you hurt not only yourself but the other<br/>\njewelcrafters as well.<br/>\nYou aren&#39;t doing ANYONE any favors selling low.  Don&#39;t subscribe to the &quot;you<br/>\njust want to make money&quot; mentality.  A suitable response is &quot;you just want<br/>\nto get more magic stuff&quot;.  Of course we want more money and they want<br/>\nstuff....  that&#39;s why we have a trade skill to sell.  If you give it away<br/>\nyou won&#39;t get the prices back up.<br/>\n<br/>\nCase in point - let&#39;s look at giant snake fangs.  In the beginning they were<br/>\nsold for the ridiculous price of 5p ea.  God I wish I could have been<br/>\nselling them at that time.  This price came about I believe because you<br/>\ncould buy them for something like 6p from an NPC merchant.  Are they worth 5<br/>\nor 6p?  I don&#39;t think so really.  A more reasonable price is 1p - they are<br/>\nGOOD weapons for new people.  However, people started selling them to<br/>\nplayers for 5gp ea (I have no idea why).  This is stupid as a person with<br/>\ngood charisma can sell them to NPCs for 4g8s.  Why in the world am I going<br/>\nto waste my time wandering the zones to sell snake fangs for a 2s profit<br/>\neach?  So I sell them to NPCs and get on with my life.  The point?  You who<br/>\nwant snake fangs could readily buy them from me if you make it somewhat<br/>\nworth my while.  But if you expect me to kill Asps at great risk so you can<br/>\nhave a cool weapon for 2s profit to me after I just took 5 minutes or so to<br/>\ntry to sell it you are mistaken.  I tried and tried to sell fangs for 8g -<br/>\n1p but everyone said &quot;everyone knows the price is 5g&quot;.  Not from me it&#39;s not<br/>\nand if enough people would work together we could find a fair medium.  But<br/>\ninstead we have people who want to make a quick buck not looking to the<br/>\nfuture.  If you are selling jewelry for a few gold more than it took to<br/>\nmake, with the current screwed up failure model (failing on trivial items)<br/>\nyou will either lose money or break even (most likely) and will not make<br/>\nenough money to research the high end jewelcraft items.  In other words you<br/>\nwill work yourself out of the market because we will be able to sell only so<br/>\nmany low end items.  Yes, new characters/people will need low end/cheap<br/>\njewlery but the vast majority of the server will be ready for gold and<br/>\nplatinum enchanted rubies and diamonds but you will have enough money to be<br/>\ndabbling in malachite electrum saying &quot;jewelcraft sucks, you can&#39;t make any<br/>\nmoney. why doesn&#39;t anyone want my stuff...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAzara<br/>\nShawn Alley</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
