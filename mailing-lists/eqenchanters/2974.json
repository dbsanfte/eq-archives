This is my 3rd <br/>\npost 40 character, and I&#39;d rather not level in SolB or Guk, and I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever PLed doing guards, however, this may be an option as I just<br/>\nwant <br/>\nto level quickly.  I&#39;m also looking for places where I can solo<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas I can come up with (although I don&#39;t know much about them <br/>\neperience wise from a below 50 perspective):<br/>\n<br/>\nCoM- grouped<br/>\nOverthere- solo or small group (but really don&#39;t like this area)<br/>\nKaesorea- grouped, MOBs from 25ish to level 40 (Xalgoz)<br/>\nTemple of Droga- grouped, not sure on the level range of things here<br/>\nMines of Nurga- not sure at all on the level range here<br/>\nFrontier Mountains- group or solo<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know the level range of MOBs in these zones?  I killed a <br/>\nbunch of stuff in these zones when the expansion first came out, but <br/>\nwith the exception of CoM at 51/52 I didn&#39;t get experience from any<br/>\nof <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a little background, all the characters I&#39;ve played from start <br/>\nto 50+ were all before Kunark, and while I&#39;ve camped items in each of <br/>\nthese zones with various people (so I do know the layouts), I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever <br/>\ndone it for exp.  I also don&#39;t know what agro on pulling is like.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help on those who&#39;ve leveled there would be great!  Thanks!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
