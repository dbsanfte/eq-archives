One<br/>\nthing IΓÇÖve found with mem wipe is it seems to work better if I cast it right<br/>\nnext to the target rather than from a ways away.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, the calm line doesnΓÇÖt work for breaking up the spider pairs as<br/>\nthey seem to run over each othersΓÇÖ spawn point in the process of coming at<br/>\nme thereby waking up the one I calmed.  Also, casting calm is asking for<br/>\ntrouble when a resist comes.  Mez line seems to be more consistent.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Still looking for mana sieve by the way...  lemme know if you can sell me<br/>\none!<br/>\n<br/>\nAzara Sparklemeister, Sacrament<br/>\n36th enchanter, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mark Rafn [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 13, 2000 3:55 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] Soothe....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 13 Oct 2000, Melinda wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&quot;m told that the enchanters spell - soothe - is pretty useless, and<br/>\n&gt; the druids harmony will beat it anytime.
