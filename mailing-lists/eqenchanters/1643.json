They had some<br/>\nEnchantment of brilliance spells which were supposed to make the item give<br/>\noff light.  I&#39;d like to see a level 8 or level 12 spell which temporarily<br/>\nmakes a weapon able to hit magical creatures.  We have a damage shield spell<br/>\n(Feedback) so I doubt if that would be an enchantment (unless it was lower<br/>\nlevel).  Any old school D&D players remember the spell &quot;Permanence&quot;?  Make<br/>\nthat a level 44 or 49 spell so our temporary weapon enchantments would last<br/>\nforever.  It would be neat to make a sword flame temporarily and give extra<br/>\ndamage.  I wonder if we&#39;d have to hold the weapon as we cast the spell.  All<br/>\nwe know now is that it will be done, but I honestly have no clue what will<br/>\nactually be implemented.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Krye</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
