They are quite silly ones, but ones that mean a lot to<br/>\nme and ones that I have invested a lot of time and effort into.  These are<br/>\n1. Being able to walk freely in my un-illusioned DE Agnostic form in every<br/>\ncity.  and 2. Mastering every language in the game to excellent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first one I am 90% complete.  I can freely walk through felwithe (much<br/>\nto the amazement of the high elf pcs), kelethin, kaladim, etc. etc.  I am<br/>\nstill working on Halas and Ak&#39;anon.  This has been done 100% -without- using<br/>\nthe guild note trick, purely from quests and killing the right combination<br/>\nof mobs.  Something I take great pride in actually.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second one I have run into a brick wall.  The research languages are<br/>\neasy to purchase in any zone, as so many people needed them, that everyone<br/>\nand their brother now knows combine, old erudin, etc. etc.  Heck, the tank<br/>\nin my group two nights ago offered to teach me Combine for 5pp during our<br/>\ndowntime.  The problem is the fringe languages.  I was young and stupid, and<br/>\nas soon as a language became available at the trainer, I would put a point<br/>\ninto it.  Not knowing what I know now that that first point roughly equals<br/>\nyour level in skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make a very long and rambling first post short (he he, sorry), I am<br/>\nlooking for Gnoll, Goblin, Kobold, Fairie, Lizardman, Froglock, and Orc to<br/>\nbe trained to excellent on the Karana server.  If there is any kind hearted<br/>\nenchanter there that would sell me these languages, and/or take the time to<br/>\ntrain me in them, I would be most grateful.  If anyone can help, please send<br/>\nme an email or an ingame tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nAthos<br/>\n40th Enchanter Karana server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
