I suggest that you decide what you<br/>\nwant to specialize in ( I hear most enchanters specialize in alteration, I<br/>\nknow I did).  When you get level 16, train one point into each<br/>\nspecialization, and then go outside and cast a spell from your &#39;main&#39;<br/>\nspecialization repeatedly, until specialize:alteration (or conjur, evoc,<br/>\nwhatever) reaches 51... then no other specializations will beat it and you<br/>\ncan go about your daily business.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my pleasure!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Bahir<br/>\n&gt; 3rd Season DE Enchanter<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxx<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cogg - Rallos Zek (30)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
