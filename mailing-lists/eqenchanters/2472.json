I am currently KOS to most faction<br/>\n&gt; groups in Neriak (even with<br/>\n&gt; Illusion: Dark Elf and Benevolence) because of my<br/>\n&gt; religion (Erollisi Marr)<br/>\n&gt; and a few unfortunate run-ins with the Neriak Guard<br/>\n&gt; population. One part of<br/>\n&gt; the Tashania quest reqiuires that I see Mizr N&#39;Mar<br/>\n&gt; in the Neriak Library to<br/>\n&gt; get my glowing coin of Tash converted into a<br/>\n&gt; gleaming coin of Tash. Will I<br/>\n&gt; be able to do this without dropping invis? Being<br/>\n&gt; invis is basically the<br/>\n&gt; only way I can roam Neriak unmolested, and I am<br/>\n&gt; usure if initiating a trade<br/>\n&gt; with an NPC will cause my invisibility to drop. I am<br/>\n&gt; pretty sure that would<br/>\n&gt; be the case, and being killed by angry NPCs in the<br/>\n&gt; Neriak Library really<br/>\n&gt; doesnt appeal to me...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would appreciate some advice from anyone that has<br/>\n&gt; completed this quest.<br/>\n&gt; Am I right to think that initiating a trade with an<br/>\n&gt; NPC will make you<br/>\n&gt; appear? If so, does anyone know what faction group<br/>\n&gt; Mizr and the surrounding<br/>\n&gt; NPCs belong to? And is there anyway that I can raise<br/>\n&gt; my faction with this<br/>\n&gt; group?
