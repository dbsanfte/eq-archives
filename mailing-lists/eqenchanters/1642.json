Do not expect to make money from it, although you might if you&#39;re<br/>\nlucky and persistent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would do first is make sure you have enough money in the bank to buy<br/>\nyour next set of spells before you start out in JC, even if that means<br/>\nwaiting a level or two. Then train as many points in it as you can. Start<br/>\nwith the cheapest gem (malachite?) and a silver bar. When you get a &quot;this<br/>\nitem is trivial&quot; message it&#39;s time to move on to the next most expensive gem<br/>\nyou can find. This works well for silver jewelry up until Topaz.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanting the bars beforehand seems to make no difference to the success /<br/>\nfailure rate, although it can increase the NPC sale value of your goods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Steve Fogle [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steve.fogle@...\">steve.fogle@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 19 July 1999 18:40<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] Where do I start?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Steve Fogle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steve.fogle@...\">steve.fogle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My Enchanter is very close to 8th level.
