When I went to purchase items from the vendor I was able to buy<br/>\nthem almost as fast as I could click the mouse.  Doing the same thing from<br/>\nmy normal connection, a 26.4 modem connection, there is half second lag<br/>\nbetween when I buy something and when I see it appear in my inventory.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe recently upgraded my wife&#39;s machine (she also plays EQ) from a K6200 with<br/>\n24Mb RAM running a Monster3D to a Celeron 466 with 48Mb RAM running a<br/>\nMonster3DII.  Differences there are zone load times cut in half and she<br/>\nactually used to run slower than me when we ran together.  So, if she<br/>\n/follow ed me she eventually would break follow cause she fell farther and<br/>\nfarther back.  Now she speeds right along.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Farr, Robert [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Robert.Farr@...\">Robert.Farr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 02, 1999 10:47 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqenchanters] Stein Quest<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Farr, Robert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Robert.Farr@...\">Robert.Farr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe single biggest improvement to game speed I have seen personally was when<br/>\nI upgraded my EIDE hard drive to an Ultra DMA hard drive.
