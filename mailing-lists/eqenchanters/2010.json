I do tend to avoid playing with twinked people as I have found<br/>\nthat most of them can&#39;t play for squat. They tend to consider themselves<br/>\ninvulnerable, as most monsters near their level are quite easy to kill. At<br/>\nsome point (Brad has said this and I have seen it in action), the monsters<br/>\nyou are fighting catch up to whatever gear you have, and then you must rely<br/>\non teamwork and play skill to survive. And if the twinkees (generally) had<br/>\nthat to begin with, they could go out and get level appropriate gear and<br/>\nsurvive. &lt;gets down off his soapbox and awaits the flames while waiting for<br/>\nan on topic thread to start&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now that the lifetap spells of necro&#39;s are resistable, are people finding<br/>\nit even easier to find a group?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 4 Nov 1999 19:37:33 -0900<br/>\n&gt;    From: Brian Pifer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bpifer@...\">bpifer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Twinking / was : Welcome to eqenchanters@oneli st.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Twinking is having one of your high level characters gain<br/>\n&gt; equipment/items/money and then transfer it to one of your lower level<br/>\n&gt; characters.
