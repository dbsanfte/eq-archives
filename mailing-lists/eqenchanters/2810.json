This put my stats up at 202 int <br/>\n202 charisma.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo being only 55 str I dumped a batwing earring for a +4 int +2 str <br/>\none and dumped a +4 int ring for a +3 int +3 str and some ac forget <br/>\nhow much ring of gob king from sol a.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy new stats are now 60 str, 66 sta, 139 agi, 100 dex, 121 wis, 200 <br/>\nint and 202 charisma.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had gold efeeti booties, but then on a hole trip I looted some loam <br/>\nencrusted boots (IMHO the best ench boots to be had) and a loam <br/>\nencrusted amice (ditto great stuff).<br/>\n<br/>\nI wear a ring of ancients on one wrist and pbb on other (on shoppoing <br/>\nlist is a gold chit bracer).  Otherwise I wear a robe of ishva (still <br/>\nhave not won a insidious one yet).  Maybe next trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know for me, I will be going long on STR till i get to say ..hmm 75 <br/>\nor so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that I will focus on dex, cuz of the regain concentration part <br/>\nyou hear about.  I know it works cuz I regain lots more when shammy <br/>\nbuffs me for dex.<br/>\n<br/>\nAC too.  Gawds I have spent up the 2 int and 13 Int from the gcb and <br/>\nrobe about 20 times over.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response tho.  Pre planes gear the best .. matching int cha combo <br/>\nI could do is about 185 185 and I had fantastic gear going in.  I see <br/>\nmany who dont spend as much time on gear as I do in Hate who must <br/>\nhave more like 160 160 and do very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel is by far the most important thing.  I started Hate late and I <br/>\nam kinda glad I did.  I started when I was 52 and mobs were blue to <br/>\nme.  I see the young enchanters struggling with them 51 mobs and they <br/>\njust have a real stuggle of a time nailing a mes first time off <br/>\n(speaking of the 46 to 49 bunch mostly), miss big head 52 makes fool <br/>\nof self acting so high, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I genuinely believe it is true that level is the great <br/>\nequilzer.  Guk for me was most fearsome till the day I got about 50 <br/>\nand all my mes pertty much stuck, including on lord or king.  When <br/>\ngoing in if invis pops, no prob after 50, before a few lvls i just <br/>\ngot pummeled trying to mes.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven Int stat is not that important in some ways.  Inasmuch as i <br/>\nopperate between 30 and 70 most of time.  If i am FM I am refreshing <br/>\ngrouop buffs just to keep the mana regen being put to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can easily imagine being as effective with less INT, in fact it <br/>\nmight require more skill but have same outcomes to have lower int.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment based on my 255 cha tests and mezing, charming <br/>\nexperience I believe if blue, 150 up is fine even or yellow higher is <br/>\nbetter.  But, I am not convinced there is any benefit to having over <br/>\n200 cha as of yet.  No mater what the con.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, I believe charm is more useful in planes in general <br/>\nthan mez on multi pulls often, since it cannot be broken and you <br/>\noften have many folks up there .. as many as 40 at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also find BARDS extremely helpful in multipulls.  If they are <br/>\nmasterful they can truely help save you if that charm breaks soon.  <br/>\nThey have mez and charm of their own that is very effective, but IMHO <br/>\nnot quite as good as ench &lt;ducks for cover&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater all,<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Jouleblu Diamond<br/>\n<br/>\n    Knights of Loyalty<br/>\n<br/>\n        52 Enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n            Cazic-Thule Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
