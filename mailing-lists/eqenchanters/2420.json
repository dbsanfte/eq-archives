I have NEVER had a color flux<br/>\nbreak my mezzes.  Last night I mezzed a Lava Duct Crawler which was all<br/>\nalone, and immediately color fluxed it, stunning it.  I did this completely<br/>\nfor the purpose of having an example for you.  after about 20 seconds I<br/>\ncolor fluxed again.  after about 30 more seconds I let my group tear it<br/>\napart.  Color Flux does not break mez.<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg - RZ</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
