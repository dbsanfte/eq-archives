I&#39;m fortunate enough that I can enchant my own<br/>\nmetals, but I find that very few are interested in my wares.  Strangely, I<br/>\nhave been getting requests from higher level characters to make them as<br/>\nmany jade rings as I can, perhaps they know something I dont. I sure have a<br/>\nhard time selling them on my own though. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, what I wanted to put out there was an idea.  Wouldnt it be<br/>\nwonderful if we could not only enchant the metal, but the stone as well?  I<br/>\nthink a +5 mana ring with 5 charges of shocking grasp would sell quite<br/>\nwell, or a +2vsFire ring with 1 charge of laying hands, or some other<br/>\ncombination.  This is just an idea, but one I would love to see<br/>\nimplemented.  I suspected that perhaps there was a way to scribe a spell<br/>\nonto paper, and put this into the extra slots but I havent figured that one<br/>\nout yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother note... does anyone know what good the other 2 slots in our<br/>\njewelers kit are for?  I have tried several combinations of things in these<br/>\nslots, and other than losing a whole lot of money I did not learn anything<br/>\nat all, except that it is a good way to waste money.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nCampaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nDiscuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
