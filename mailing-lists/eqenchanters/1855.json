At level 28 or 29 I went to nektulos Forest with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;some friends and we killed Guards and corporals for loot. We sometimes drew<br/>\n&gt;&gt;overpulls but beguile let us escape them, usually by charming a guard to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;fight the corporal. Today we dicided to go to Solusek and as I waited for<br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;&gt;friends someone pulled the corporal and two guards. All three were dark<br/>\n&gt;&gt;green to me at level 32.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The Corporal on walking apst came at me and I tashani&#39;d him and tried to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;beguile him. And failed. 8 times in a row. I killed it the old fashioned<br/>\n&gt;way<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and thenwhen my friends came we experimented. $ casts on Dark green guards<br/>\n&gt;&gt;all after tashani all resisted. Another 8 casts on Corporals also after<br/>\n&gt;&gt;tashani everyone resisted.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I was mad as hell. This isn&#39;t a random number problem this is deliberately<br/>\n&gt;&gt;making a mob that I should ahve a chance of charming IMMUNE to it. When I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;travel solo I have a choice, I always go with a pet spell memmed or with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;beguile. Usually beguile because my other spell mix is geared to flight<br/>\n&gt;&gt;rather then fight. I used to be fairly certain that with 160 charisma I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;could reasonably expect to succeed in a charm of a green. Now that faith is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;gone. What other random mobs has Verant decided to make IMMUNE to one of<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Major spells we Enchanters rely on? How many deaths am I going to face<br/>\n&gt;&gt;discovering these little changes. I feedbacked it.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I petitioned it. I got a tell from a GM or Guide that siad they couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt;discuss game mechanic changes but there was something in the news file. I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;logged out to check the news file and didn&#39;t see anything so is there<br/>\n&gt;anyone<br/>\n&gt;&gt;out there who can enlighten me as too what the guide or Gm was referring<br/>\n&gt;to?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;And what benefit did we get in exchange for making a spell that we could<br/>\n&gt;&gt;reasonably count on now totally uncertain? I could understand making charm<br/>\n&gt;&gt;spells harder to resist, but thats not what happened. They made a certain<br/>\n&gt;&gt;mob type Immune to them and if they did it for one they probably did it for<br/>\n&gt;&gt;others.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I think we need to ask Verant to undo this change, Charm spells are the<br/>\n&gt;core<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of the Enchanter class and screwing around with them in that manner is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;crazy. Thanks. Any help or comments are appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Silverlock,  ICQ 474725<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Why would you think all creatures are vulnerable to any spell much less this<br/>\n&gt;one in particualr?<br/>\n&gt;There are a couple of Magic immune MOBs out there.<br/>\n&gt;Also I disagree that Charm is our core spell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t a magic immune mob.
