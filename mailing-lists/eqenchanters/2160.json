It was a freak<br/>\nfind as I was level 10 at the time.  Was walking along and *pop* this<br/>\ngriffin corpse appears at my feet.  I was looking around trying to figure<br/>\nout what was going on and *poof* it disappeared.  I was sad till a few<br/>\nseconds later it reappeared at which point I pounced on it.  Got a feather,<br/>\nabout 5p, and a black pearl.  I was so excited when the NPC offered me 21p<br/>\nfor the gem so I sold it.  Sigh, didn&#39;t know how rare they are since you<br/>\nonly can find them from loot supposedly.  Anyhow, got one off a griffin.<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing the max quality of looted gem is based on the level of the<br/>\nmonster.  No gurruantee you&#39;ll get a good gem but at least possiblity is<br/>\nthere?  So, perhaps other NPCs that are similar level or higher will also<br/>\nhave black pearls?<br/>\n<br/>\nAzara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Scott Davidson Lenker [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slenker@...\">slenker@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 12:13 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] black pearl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Scott Davidson Lenker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slenker@...\">slenker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHey guys, i was wondering if anyone knew of a vendor that sells black<br/>\npearls.  That are supposedly rare, but caster&#39;s realm didn&#39;t include these<br/>\non the NPC drops so I was thinking maybe someone sells them.
