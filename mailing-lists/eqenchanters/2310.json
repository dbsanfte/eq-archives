Spells that<br/>\nwould<br/>\nbe hard to use in NON-PK situations (ie normal grouping) - like<br/>\nMezmerization,<br/>\nall the Color series of stuns, grav flux (this one would be funny as hell if<br/>\nit<br/>\ndidn&#39;t get the entire party killed), etc.  What does this leave the<br/>\nenchanter<br/>\nwith?  Hope your tanks resist or do you go up and whack on your group member<br/>\nto<br/>\nbreak the mes?<br/>\n*snip*<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t speak for Rallos Zek where everyone can hurt everyone else within 4<br/>\nlevels of their level, but on Tallon the &quot;cross-teaming&quot; enchanters have a<br/>\nmore difficult time because they can&#39;t use those spells.  However, I&#39;m<br/>\npretty sure that on Rallos, the spells won&#39;t hurt your party members but<br/>\nwill hurt their pets (go figure) making them go aggro on you.  Maybe it<br/>\nworks the same way on the Race war zeks, but I&#39;ve never cross-teamed so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t really worry about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny story:  There was a huge battle in South and North Karana of the<br/>\nLights vs. the Darks (the Lights being the 3 other teams - Team shortie:<br/>\nDwarves, gnomes, halflings - Team elf: High elves, half-elves, wood elves -<br/>\nTeam Blind: Humans, Erudites, Barbarians).  After a great battle on the<br/>\nSouth Karana bridge, the lights retreated into North Karana or were killed<br/>\nin South Karana, and the Darks moved into North Karana to give chase.<br/>\nDuring these big 50 on 50 battles I always fight under an illusion.  It is<br/>\nmuch easier for them to target an Ogre or a dark elf, than to realize that<br/>\ngnome is really a dark elf.  So I zone in and begin AE Mesmerization,<br/>\nstopping a good many of them.  Then Enthralling the ones not actively<br/>\nengaged.  After a few AE mezzes, a shorty sends me a tell &quot;Easy on the AE<br/>\nspells&quot;  - He still thought I was the illusioned race and was hitting him<br/>\naccidentally!  After Enthralling him two more times (ha ha) he figured out<br/>\nwhat I was really doing.  Later on he told me he had to do a /guildstatus<br/>\nDrexia to figure it out.  During the whole night, he was the only one to<br/>\nfigure it out.  That tells you how safe we can be under illusion.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever been attacked running through High Pass (that is solid Lightie<br/>\nterritory) thanks to illusion.  And had no trouble buying spells from Erudin<br/>\nor completing the Stein quest.  The team PvP servers are so much fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrexia<br/>\n27th (as of last night) Enchantress<br/>\nTallon Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
