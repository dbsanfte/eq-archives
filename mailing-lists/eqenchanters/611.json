I died yesterday in<br/>\nblackburrow when a huge train (20 or so gnolls including elites and<br/>\nseveral guardsmen) bubbled up from the depths after a partymembers pet<br/>\n(a necro&#39;s skel) wandered off and attacked something.  We eventually got<br/>\nexperience (seemed kind of funny getting exp out of the blue with us all<br/>\nsitting/resting) which worried me but there were so many people in the<br/>\nzone I thought the gnoll population was probably under control.  HaHaHa,<br/>\ndon&#39;t think so anymore.  They started trailing in and they just kept on<br/>\ncoming.  I made the decision to run too late.  I almost made it up but<br/>\nan elite kept stunning me and then the gang would hit hit hit.  So,<br/>\ndon&#39;t let your pets wander off and attack as you may see more of the bad<br/>\nguys at once than you intended.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3. anyone ever casted a pet in befallen? i am getting mad about that,<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; pet is that nervous runnig around me, and is alwas really far from me,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; get into melee with everything that moves. Once i casted 4 pets<br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; every 2 minutes i realized, oh the pet got lost somewhere i didnt even<br/>\n&gt; hear<br/>\n&gt; a taunting attacker... i run around there a lot, from one door to the<br/>\n&gt; next,<br/>\n&gt; and most times i dont even see, where my pet is, and where he gets<br/>\n&gt; himself<br/>\n&gt; slain this time. suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t[Hapke, Matthew]  This happens in all the dungeons. In Black<br/>\nBurrow where I have spent a lot of time, my pet fequently gets left<br/>\nbehind. He does eventually make it out, but sometimes I have to go and<br/>\nunstick him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Niniel<br/>\n&gt; lvl 11 darkelf enchantress on Solusek ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Explore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAre you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nFriends tell friends about ONElist!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
