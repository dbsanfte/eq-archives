I bought<br/>\n&gt; Alliance, Chaotic Feedback, Lesser Shielding, and Eye Of Confusion. They<br/>\n&gt; are all great. However, I didn&#39;t have enough money for anything else, so I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know if I should buy Root, Soothe, or Cancel Magic first when I get<br/>\n&gt; enough. Anyone have any suggestions? Also, could someone give me a<br/>\n&gt; suggestion as to where to fight? I do not want to go to Crushbone, but the<br/>\n&gt; Dragon Bones in Steamfont where I am fighting right now are also pretty<br/>\n&gt; boring. I do not want to take a month to get to the next spell circle like<br/>\n&gt; I did this time, can anyone help me out?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Aginor, Gnomish Enchanter, Fennin Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
