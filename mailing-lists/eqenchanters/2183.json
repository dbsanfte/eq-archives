However, I can cut to the quick as I<br/>\n&gt; know it by heart. Lucky you!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My wife and I have 2 HP Pavilion PCs, standard issue. The only difference<br/>\n&gt; between the 2 is that her PC has 64MB of RAM more than I do. We both have<br/>\n&gt; 2<br/>\n&gt; seperate ISP accounts with the same provider and are on 2 different phone<br/>\n&gt; lines. Swapping lines does nothing to help me. The UOTracer program shows<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; in the green from my PC to CerfNet. Yes, CerfNet is usually Yellow to just<br/>\n&gt; under, but it is that way for my wife to.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have more RAM on order (my mother is getting me an upgrade for<br/>\n&gt; Christmas,<br/>\n&gt; and it will be the only thing I get from them. hehe.) which should be here<br/>\n&gt; soon. When it gets here, my zone time should be alot less and I should be<br/>\n&gt; able to do it that way. I already have a 5th level monk over there that I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t really care if his faction goes down the crapper.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Story Time w/ Bahir<br/>\n&gt; You may get a big chuckle out of this, but I no longer even try to get on<br/>\n&gt; the boats anymore.  I was stuck on the boat, back when there was only one<br/>\n&gt; boat in OOT, for over 2 hours Real Time because I couldn&#39;t finish zoning<br/>\n&gt; fast enough to get out of OOT.<br/>\n&gt; LOADING PLEASE WAIT.....<br/>\n&gt; You have entered Butcherblock<br/>\n&gt; LOADING PLEASE WAIT....<br/>\n&gt; You have entered the Ocean of Tears<br/>\n&gt; Rinse, recycle, repeat...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t even get other people shouting that the boat was here. The only<br/>\n&gt; reason I got off the boat was because a GM standing on the Pier in<br/>\n&gt; Freeport<br/>\n&gt; teleported me from OOT after I petitioned.<br/>\n&gt; YOU have been SUMMONED by the GODS!!!!    &lt;~ I will never forget this<br/>\n&gt; phrase. The text was yellow.<br/>\n&gt; LOADING PLEASE WAIT....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That was pretty interesting because when I first asked, he said he had to<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; in the same zone as me. After he found out I had just left Freeport and he<br/>\n&gt; would need to wait another 40 minutes til I was zoning into Freeport<br/>\n&gt; again,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Miraculously&quot; I was summoned.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heh! Just after that I created a Wood Elf Ranger and got onto the boat<br/>\n&gt; again. &lt;~stupid idea!<br/>\n&gt; He is still in OOT at the first Island after leaving BB, for the 2nd time.<br/>\n&gt; He has no food or water and the newbie sword.

After that, just go kill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fishes until a corpse is found.  Log out.  Log back in with your main<br/>\n&gt; &gt; character and loot the corpse.  No fuss. No muss.  No KOS.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would do this, but it takes me 2 minutes to log out, and another 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt; minutes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to log back in as the primary. By that amount of time, someone else has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looted the corpse or it has been &quot;eaten&quot; by the system.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
