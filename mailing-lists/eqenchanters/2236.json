Does anyone know where it<br/>\ndrops or where I might be able to buy it?  Also, Is the tome of Endless<br/>\nEnchantments in the general Enchanter guild area or do I need to travel<br/>\nto find this as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also ran across the page on specialization, and it&#39;s got me curious<br/>\nnow..<br/>\n<br/>\nThis page says that the spell skills will cap at 50 skill and you can<br/>\nthen specialize in one.  I&#39;m level 14 right now, and All of my spell<br/>\nskills are at 75 (except conjuration, which is at 36, uck, need to keep<br/>\nworking on that one).  Has something changed with specialization or am I<br/>\njust not understanding something?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nEzrae<br/>\nLevel 14 Dark Elf Enchanter<br/>\nBrell Serilis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
