Such is the life of the enchanter, as it is with most magic<br/>\nclasses I suppose (except those nasty clerics... its not fair!)<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 5 you should still be wearing a Jr. or Sr. apprentice robe... these<br/>\nare NO-DROP items, so when that lvl 8 PK sees you he wont be interested in<br/>\nyour wares(I play on Zek).  I have seen no end to the amout of level 10 and<br/>\nless characters wearing the Flowing Black Robe, or Thamurgists robe, when<br/>\nits impossible that they got them themselves.  Now sure some get them as<br/>\ngifts, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that I suppose, but wouldnt you<br/>\ntreasure that robe more if you&#39;d actually EARNED it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Thamurgists robes can be found in Befallen, down deep in its bowels, but<br/>\ndont go looking for it until you&#39;re at least 15 and in a nice sized group.<br/>\nThe Flowing Black Robe is well beyond the reach of a level 5 character, so I<br/>\nwouldnt worry about it just yet.... Also, if you get a chance head to Guk<br/>\nfor armours... you&#39;ll find many woven pieces inside if you are persistent,<br/>\nand these are perfect for a magic user.  You&#39;ll find this task fairly easy<br/>\non any server except Rallos Zek, where the ogres and trolls will eat you<br/>\nalive if you&#39;re not a dark elf.  I went in as a gnome disguised as a dark<br/>\nelf, and everything was fine until my illusion wore out mid fight, as trolls<br/>\napparently dont like illusions very much.  It was all I could do to<br/>\npacify/entertain them with minor illusion and charm to keep myself out of<br/>\ntheir stew pot!<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg, lvl 18 gnomish enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; --- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In my many wanderings of old and new characters I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others running around wearing very nice white, blue,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; black robes.

I have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; set<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of Damask pants (thanks to my wife) and would like a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; complete set.  Anyone who knows what pieces are out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there and what the benies are, please let me know.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, you can spoile me as to where to acquire them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too. :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Artimis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Enchanter 2nd Rank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bretoxxulous<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
