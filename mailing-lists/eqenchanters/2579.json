We were able to ice the 4 clerics until the spite went<br/>\n&gt; down, then picked the clerics off one by one, and those things are very<br/>\n&gt; difficult to get mes to stick. Weve also pulled a train of 8 mobs in Hate<br/>\n&gt; that we successfully defeated, 200 Charisma is the best gun you can have<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; there.<br/>\n&gt; I know many guilds on our server that would have called evac but we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; usually up for a good challenge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Items can usually get your int/cha pretty high. I am working now with<br/>\n&gt; 204cha/176int, but with a few items Ill be able to get over 200/200.<br/>\n&gt; (adorning grace adds +40 to cha)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Being Level 50, i need to ask you a question...I am level 41, and have<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;working on getting my INT up, not my CHA.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my int is 189, and my cha is 135 with buff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I hear for the Planes you really need a high CHA, can you comment on this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Maelael?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanx<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Aeramus, 41 Enchanter, Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; PERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
