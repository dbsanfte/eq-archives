To grasp the effects of mesmerize,<br/>\njust think about what its name implies. What it does is &#39;distract&#39; the<br/>\ncritter (i.e., makes em start daydreaming). This is the &#39;stun&#39; effect of<br/>\nthis spell. NOTE: If you attack the critter while it is &#39;stunned&#39;, it will<br/>\nno longer be &#39;stunned&#39;, and you will have just wasted your spell, because it<br/>\nwill begin attacking you once again. That would be akin to seeing a friend<br/>\nof yours daydreaming, so you punch em in the shoulder to &#39;bring em back&#39;.<br/>\nThis is where I assume most go wrong with this spell. While the critter is<br/>\n&#39;stunned&#39; he is dead to the world. He doesn&#39;t care what&#39;s going on, as long<br/>\nas it doesn&#39;t involve him. If the critter is normally non-agressive, when he<br/>\ncomes back from la-la-land, he will just go his merry way. If he is normally<br/>\naggressive, and you are still in his aggression range, he will attack you<br/>\nonce again. And the tricky situation: If the critter is a normally<br/>\nnon-aggressive swarmer (wisps, fire beetles, spiderling, etc.) and you are<br/>\nfighting one of its kind, you can kill the one you are currently attacking<br/>\nwithout disturbing the critter who was mesmerized. HOWEVER, if you change<br/>\ntargets to another of the same type of critter, the previously mesmerized<br/>\ncritter registers this attack and will join in. (Example: You are fighting 3<br/>\nwisps. You mesmerize one. You are now fighting 2. You can kill the one you<br/>\nare currently fighting, but when you attack the 2nd one, the mesmerized wisp<br/>\nwill join in again.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an incredibly useful spell. Play around with it, I think all of you<br/>\nwill like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nQinie, High Elf Enchantress<br/>\n(16th Level, Mith Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I just made level 16, so I haven&#39;t had much chance to play around with<br/>\nthe AE version. I&#39;ll let y&#39;all know if it is as useful as the single target<br/>\none...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
