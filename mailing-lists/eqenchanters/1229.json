Well, I have ( or had ) a mage level 12, a necro<br/>\nlevel 9, a necro level 16 and an enchanter level 20, and it didnt seem that<br/>\ntough to me. Necros were definitely the easiest to play with a &quot;strong&quot; pet<br/>\nat level 1 and since melee and hp matter more at those low levels and you<br/>\ncan absorb them. But I did pretty good with my enchanter and my mage also.<br/>\nAt level 4, I could buy all my enchanter spells!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I started a bard last night ( tank class ). Well after 6 hours of<br/>\nendless fight, here are the stats:<br/>\nI just made Level 5,<br/>\nI&#39;ve bought all my songs and my first instrument ( hand drum ),<br/>\nI have about 8 plats in the bank,<br/>\nI have about half of the cloth armor pieces with one banded torso part (<br/>\nwhatever those tanks call that ).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now, I dont think I did that well before... Anyway, here is what really<br/>\nsurprised me. Remember at our low levels how it&#39;s fight then meditate ( or<br/>\npretend to hehe ), fight then meditate, etc... I fought that for tanks it<br/>\nwas fight and sit and fight and sit..no no no! I had to sit about 3 to 4<br/>\ntimes because my hp went under a bubble and that&#39;s for the whole 6 hours! I<br/>\ndied a few times ( one by falling from Kelethim ). The only backdraw on that<br/>\nis that I could barely raise my skills to their max in that timeframe.<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m not trying to do a race here, but you guys should try a tank<br/>\nsometimes, it&#39;s not bad at all ( well yes, warrior is! ). I may create a<br/>\ndruid also. I&#39;m getting bored of the same spells and characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkara de Toxxulia</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
