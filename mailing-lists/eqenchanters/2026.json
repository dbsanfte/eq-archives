Is it by money?  I have had several hundred<br/>\nplat at level 12. I have spent much time on my jewelry business and it is<br/>\nbooming.  Is it rare items?  Most players have grouped with those a few<br/>\nlevels above them.  What if you grouped with someone MANY levels above you<br/>\n(say they needed someone with SOW or Invis)?  Wouldn&#39;t they give you a turn<br/>\nat looting?  Didn&#39;t you stand toe to toe with them, fighting, and earn it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you&#39;re a chicken and only fight blue/green&#39;s, getting little exp and<br/>\nlots of loot.  Take that loot and turn it into better items.  If trading<br/>\nwith other players/NPC&#39;s was against the intent of Everquest, why did they<br/>\ndevelop trade skill and an economy?  If trading is OK, why couldn&#39;t someone<br/>\ntake months to level and still trade for the upper items (outpacing what<br/>\nmost feel is usual for that level)?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
