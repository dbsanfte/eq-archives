What is most important<br/>\n&gt;is Veriant hears our upset with the most recent changes, send em email,<br/>\n&gt;send feedback and write up a bug report. The more people that do, the<br/>\n&gt;chances are something will be done. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another thing along the same lines, I&#39;d like to know where Veriant is<br/>\n&gt;telling us of these changes vs. just putting them in and us finding out as<br/>\n&gt;we play.
