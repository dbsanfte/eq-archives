Most people look in the guild hall and can&#39;t find the spell<br/>\nand they get frustrated. I did this myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI created a new Dark Elf with HIGH charisma so the spell would be<br/>\ncheapest. I traveled to Freeport which is very easy to do. I had a<br/>\nfriend help me transfer 5 platinum to my newbie dark elf. I then killed<br/>\nmyself so I would be sent back to Neriak. I then bought the spell and<br/>\nran back to Freeport again. Once again I had my friend help me transfer<br/>\nthe spell and left over money to my good character.<br/>\n<br/>\nDO NOT buy more then one spell. I was going to buy a few spells at 4p<br/>\nand sell for 8-10p. Sounded good to me as I knew many people that wanted<br/>\nthe spell.  When I bought the second spell the vendor took my money and<br/>\nnever gave me the spell. There is a bug so that if you buy a spell you<br/>\nalready have on your person you don&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDIRECTIONS TO FREEPORT <br/>\nWhen you leave the entrance to Neriak stay against the left wall. When<br/>\nyou come to the water just swim across it. Stay against the left wall<br/>\nuntil you reach the zone. You will then zone into East Commonlands.<br/>\nAgain, stay against the left wall to the next zone which is Freeport.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
