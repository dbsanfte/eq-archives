I am currently KOS to most faction groups in Neriak (even with<br/>\nIllusion: Dark Elf and Benevolence) because of my religion (Erollisi Marr)<br/>\nand a few unfortunate run-ins with the Neriak Guard population. One part of<br/>\nthe Tashania quest reqiuires that I see Mizr N&#39;Mar in the Neriak Library to<br/>\nget my glowing coin of Tash converted into a gleaming coin of Tash. Will I<br/>\nbe able to do this without dropping invis? Being invis is basically the<br/>\nonly way I can roam Neriak unmolested, and I am usure if initiating a trade<br/>\nwith an NPC will cause my invisibility to drop. I am pretty sure that would<br/>\nbe the case, and being killed by angry NPCs in the Neriak Library really<br/>\ndoesnt appeal to me...<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate some advice from anyone that has completed this quest.<br/>\nAm I right to think that initiating a trade with an NPC will make you<br/>\nappear? If so, does anyone know what faction group Mizr and the surrounding<br/>\nNPCs belong to? And is there anyway that I can raise my faction with this<br/>\ngroup?
