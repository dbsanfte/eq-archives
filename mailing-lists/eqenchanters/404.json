I have this theory that, perhaps, your str and<br/>\ndex ( maybe a few more ) have a very noticable effect on such things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis came about after comparing experiences with an Erudin Wizard<br/>\nfriend of mine using Tailoring.  At the time, I was playing a Monk, so<br/>\nboth my Str and Dex were significantly better than his, and I seemed to<br/>\nbe having much greater success than he was, with both Tailoring and Fishing,<br/>\nof all things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo... as an experiment, i have created a high elf enchanter with<br/>\nthe following statistics:<br/>\n\tStr 55 Sta 65 Agl 85 Dex 95 Wis 95 Int 102 Cha 95<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis character operates under the assumption that Str does not<br/>\nplay a vital role in jewelcraft.  I&#39;ve found the Int to still be within<br/>\nreasonable levels, regarding spell use.  (Although I seem to be getting<br/>\nmore resisted results than I remember from my other high elf enchanter.<br/>\nHas anyone noted a Int to Spell resistance correlation?)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnyway, I just thought I&#39;d ask around.  It might be worthwhile to<br/>\nadd, when posting success rates, your character&#39;s stats.  Just a thought, and<br/>\nI have seen some stats mentioned on some of the trade skill guides.  Just not<br/>\nall of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n|  Daniel E Andersen      | &quot;Life...
