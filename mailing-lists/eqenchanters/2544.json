The key is <br/>\nto know when you are gonna aggro other rooms, and split the spawns amongst <br/>\nmultiple parties. I would suggest a minimum of 2 enchanters for this, as <br/>\nsometimes the pulls will get large. Good monk pullers are critical also(2 as <br/>\nwell, very well buffed), and at least 3 or 4 clerics. Once inside the house <br/>\njust make sure to keep the trouble areas clear (in front of the magi room, <br/>\noutside the hand room, and the bar/tower). It would be impossible to hold <br/>\nall 4 of the major loot spawns on the second floor at once, but two could be <br/>\nheld at any given time. holding the pit/bloodpool would be very easy as <br/>\nwell, i have not quite gotten into the ghost room but i suspect it could be <br/>\ndone by people in that level range.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoranur<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 28 Mar 2000 15:38:57 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Paul Jesernig&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWJ@...\">PWJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Hunting at 24<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Unrest is quite fine, but it depends on the time of day you play. The zone<br/>\n&gt;needs 30+ people in it to be playable, with a group in the ghoul magi room.<br/>\n&gt;That room is the key to Unrest, as pulling down the back stairs will <br/>\n&gt;usually<br/>\n&gt;agro that room. It&#39;s also best to have a group in the tower and the bar if<br/>\n&gt;one is to be camped as the other room will agro through the floor/ceiling.<br/>\n&gt;Bats, the reanimated hand and a few things by the ghost room will see<br/>\n&gt;through invis to undead, otherwise it&#39;s a necessary spell for moving around<br/>\n&gt;in the house. Outside of primetime I never see enough people in there to<br/>\n&gt;make it worthwhile, and in primetime it&#39;s camped.  If you don&#39;t mind the<br/>\n&gt;faction hits (who needs to go to Surefall or Karana druid rings anyway :p),<br/>\n&gt;or waiting for a spot to open up,  the treants in South Karana are cash and<br/>\n&gt;experience city, just keep the level 30 and 31&#39;s outta your group. A bubble<br/>\n&gt;of experience and 30pp an hour is minimum I ever made there (alot more with<br/>\n&gt;just 4 level 24 casters). Last summer Cazic was quite fine to level in, but<br/>\n&gt;now all I see in there are trains (all the fools from CB who never learned<br/>\n&gt;to not make trains I think have gone to CT now). Was used to only seeing <br/>\n&gt;one<br/>\n&gt;train there an hour, last time I was there saw em every 5 or 10 minutes<br/>\n&gt;(about what Unrest been averaging too). I went to High Keep at 29 then<br/>\n&gt;(never been there before and my guildmates recommended at) and hit 30 in 5<br/>\n&gt;hours in the warrior room. Walk in, give the working with an enchanter 101<br/>\n&gt;speech, start splitting the spawn, start yelling at groupmates not to <br/>\n&gt;attack<br/>\n&gt;mezzed mobs (taunt them please until they attack like I said 3 times), <br/>\n&gt;split<br/>\n&gt;the spawn nice and wide, relax and make experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lozi ~Hand of Chaos~ CT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
