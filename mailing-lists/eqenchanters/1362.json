I will offer you some advice at your current skill level: Stop with silver and start with electrum","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1270996532\">I raised my jewelcrafting skill from 86 to 92 this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will offer you some advice at your current skill level: Stop with silver<br/>\nand start with electrum now. Work with electrum and malachite, as the<br/>\nfailures with that combo (3p) cost far less than a failure with silver and<br/>\npearl or higher. You will succeed fairly often, and this combo will raise<br/>\nyou all the way up to the mid 70&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of being undercut, I have convinced no less than half a dozen<br/>\nothers who were selling their items ridiculously cheap to raise their<br/>\nprices. How? A number of ways really. My first /tell to them is along the<br/>\nlines of my past success at selling such items at a substantially higher<br/>\nprice. If they are primarily greedy, this will usually suffice. I usually<br/>\nfollow that up with marketing advice, such as reminding everyone about the<br/>\nadded benefits of extra intelligence when you are trying to raise a trade<br/>\nskill such as blacksmithing. If you can&#39;t sell a pair of +2 int rings for<br/>\n15p, then either you aren&#39;t marketing very well, or the zone has been<br/>\nspammed for too long by someone selling them for 3p each.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is, most people will raise their prices if you ask them<br/>\npolitely, suggest what the new price would be, and tell them that you have<br/>\nbeen having success selling the items at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, the jewelcrafting patch is the best thing to happen to me in the game<br/>\nthus far. I started on Tuesday morning with 23p, and when I logged out last<br/>\nnight, I had almost 500p! Not a bad nest egg for a 16th level enchanter, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcent@...\">jcent@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcent@...\">jcent@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tMonday, June 14, 1999 3:29 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqenchanters] pricing<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcent@...\">jcent@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s awfully quiet out there today....you must have all had a good<br/>\n&gt; weekend,<br/>\n&gt; like I did....raised my jeweling skill from 22 to 38 over the past<br/>\n&gt; week....any other success stories?  Is that a normal rate?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Working with jade and pearl now....the pearl rings are a hard sell...even<br/>\n&gt; at 12pp each..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i noticed a lot of jewelers selling their wares for a lower cost then<br/>\n&gt; mine...seems like I&#39;m getting cut....I&#39;ve been selling for about twice the<br/>\n&gt; cost of materials...seems like a fair rule for prices (considering all the<br/>\n&gt; factors and costs involved in getting skill high enough to even work with<br/>\n&gt; the better stones)....but I saw a few people selling jade rings for<br/>\n&gt; 6pp???!!!!   Ouch!  10pp is what I&#39;ve been selling them for.....and until<br/>\n&gt; someone auctions a lower price, I had no problem getting that price.   It<br/>\n&gt; pains me greatly to see it happen...so I politely ask the vendors to raise<br/>\n&gt; the selling price a little....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any thoughts?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fistlebane, rathe server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
