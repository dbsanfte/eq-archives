I&#39;ve done this to get my faction up.  I don&#39;t remember the name<br/>\nof the NPC in question but he is in a room by himself, and nobody will<br/>\nassist him if he attacks you, or you attack him.  you should be relatively<br/>\nsafe in this room.  At lvl 16 he conned green to me and was REAL easy for<br/>\nme to kill (tome of ages quest).  You can try giving him wine while in<br/>\nminor illusion, invis, etc to see if you can.  The factions raised are<br/>\nDread Guard Inner, Dread Guard Outer, and Dark Barganers (which is Mizr&#39;s<br/>\nfaction I believe?).  I know it&#39;s boring, but a hundred or so wines should<br/>\nraise your faction to dubious to these groups.  80 wines got me from<br/>\namiable to warmly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether you want (or can) raise your faction in neriak, this would be the<br/>\nsafest place to test your invis/trade.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEzrae<br/>\n21st DE Enchantress<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 15 Mar 2000 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eantravis@...\">eantravis@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n.From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eantravis@...\">eantravis@...</a><br/>\n.<br/>\n.I know every detail of the quest to get the Tashania spell, but one part<br/>\n.worries me. I am currently KOS to most faction groups in Neriak (even with<br/>\n.Illusion: Dark Elf and Benevolence) because of my religion (Erollisi Marr)<br/>\n.and a few unfortunate run-ins with the Neriak Guard population. One part of<br/>\n.the Tashania quest reqiuires that I see Mizr N&#39;Mar in the Neriak Library to<br/>\n.get my glowing coin of Tash converted into a gleaming coin of Tash. Will I<br/>\n.be able to do this without dropping invis? Being invis is basically the<br/>\n.only way I can roam Neriak unmolested, and I am usure if initiating a trade<br/>\n.with an NPC will cause my invisibility to drop. I am pretty sure that would<br/>\n.be the case, and being killed by angry NPCs in the Neriak Library really<br/>\n.doesnt appeal to me...<br/>\n.<br/>\n.I would appreciate some advice from anyone that has completed this quest.<br/>\n.Am I right to think that initiating a trade with an NPC will make you<br/>\n.appear? If so, does anyone know what faction group Mizr and the surrounding<br/>\n.NPCs belong to? And is there anyway that I can raise my faction with this<br/>\n.group?
