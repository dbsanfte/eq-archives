You have no clue how useful this<br/>\nspell is. Normally an orc leggione is read to me and I<br/>\ncast tashan on him succesfully almost always.. with<br/>\nthis spell and root i can kill it solo with a pet of<br/>\ncourse and sometimes help. Tashan rocks cause it<br/>\nlowers MOB Major More than you think. And with this<br/>\nnew patch i can get even better things... I thing this<br/>\nis a major cool thing especially with faster casting<br/>\nand lower mob cause i use this spell on almost every<br/>\ncritt especially in groups cause when a wizard can&#39;t<br/>\nget any spells through my tashan spell will hlep him<br/>\nmajor.

Probably my favorite of the non enchanter<br/>\n&gt; changes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- A number of new quests have been added to various<br/>\n&gt; zones.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;But the question is do they actually work?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- Magician pets (elemental) will now cast minor<br/>\n&gt; spells (to make up for their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lack of kick)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- New Magician spells on vendors and some Magician<br/>\n&gt; spells have moved to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;different vendors<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- New Magician weapons for Summon Fang & Spear of<br/>\n&gt; Warding & Dagger of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Symbols<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t play an enchanter but I am sure that they<br/>\n&gt; will like this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- New enchanter whirl spell (check the vendors)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Does anyone know what level this is for?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- Whirl now works on MOBS better than it did on the<br/>\n&gt; last patch.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- The saving throw against Memory Blur and Atone<br/>\n&gt; was reduced (harder to save<br/>\n&gt; &gt;against) from the last patch.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;THEY LISTENED!  I am suprised.  Although they<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t put it back to where it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was, I am happy.  Really it could be a sham, the<br/>\n&gt; change could be only one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;percentage point of resist and it would still be<br/>\n&gt; true.

These should not have been<br/>\n&gt; patches after the game was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;released.  Tashan has always been pretty useless<br/>\n&gt; along with Alliance.  And I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;told that the speed spells weren&#39;t worth the mana<br/>\n&gt; for what you got.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- New bard songs have been added to the vendors<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- Paladins lose the spell Bravery, and gain the<br/>\n&gt; spell Valor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- ShadowKnights and Necromancers gain the Word of<br/>\n&gt; Spirit spell (replacing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Word of Shadow for the ShadowKnight)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- ShadowKnights lose Haunting Corpse and gain<br/>\n&gt; Summon Dead<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- Necromancers and ShadowKnights get a new spell -<br/>\n&gt; Shadow Vortex.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- ShadowKnights lose Intensify Death (replaced by<br/>\n&gt; Shadow Vortex)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- Rangers lose Shield of Barbs and gain Shield of<br/>\n&gt; Brambles<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Good for them....  =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- Shorter stun effects will no longer remove longer<br/>\n&gt; stun effects (Bash won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;get rid of whirl, for example)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Another example of Feedback in action.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;- Spell components are now stackable<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Again what took so long.
