No\nother stat","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-827520055\">The only stat that I have ever seen as being useless to be over 200 is<br/>\nint/wis for a caster, as every point over 200 is only one point of mana. No<br/>\nother stat has been investigated/explained as much as those. From my<br/>\nexperiences working with a warrior for example, there is a noticeable<br/>\ndifference when str is over 200 for melee damage, which continues to rise as<br/>\nstr rises. Nobody from VI has ever said exactly what cha will have what<br/>\neffect on success/failure rate of what spells. I normally work with a 206<br/>\ncha, though I do raise it to 213 when on the planes. I have not noticed any<br/>\nmajor difference in Hate/Fear between myself and the other main enchanter I<br/>\nwork with in those places, who has a 185 cha. We bounced a forsaken reverent<br/>\nback and forth with 4 or 5 resisted dazzles each once. I personally will<br/>\nsacrifice some int (or any other stat) for the sake of getting my cha as<br/>\nhigh as possible when I think it&#39;s called for. If I&#39;m having a bad streak of<br/>\nluck mezzing (and who hasn&#39;t? usually, it&#39;s the blue ones that get lucky now<br/>\nand then and won&#39;t mezz), I&#39;ll switch out items to boost my cha a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi ~Hand of Chaos~, CT<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sun, 5 Nov 2000 17:19:15 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Charisma<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; True but it&#39;s not something you would want to sacrifice say hp or ac items<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for since the return of stats over 200 is almost non existant.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Osmosis<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, November 02, 2000 2:20 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] Charisma<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   From what I&#39;ve experienced and what I&#39;ve been told, having more than 200<br/>\n </span></blockquote>charisma, while not being necessary in any situation, can still be useful.<br/>\nThe simple fact is that the returns for &gt;200 in any stat is greatly<br/>\ndiminished, but not non-existant.
