(and no matter what you cast) tashan, tashani, tashania...  <br/>\nis seems the Mobs  tend to like you alot...  but only if i&#39;m the first the <br/>\ncast....  (this is without any taunt type spells cast on it). has anyone <br/>\nelse noticed this or am i dreamin?  hehe<br/>\n   One last this i really like this e-mail list it helps me get more info <br/>\nthan anyother place due to real applications of things said... thanks guys<br/>\n<br/>\n  Chantisis Tashania<br/>\n  Rodcet Nife &lt;Luna Imperium&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
