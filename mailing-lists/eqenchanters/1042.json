For my character, I maxed out intelligence to 142 and I&#39;ve put the<br/>\nremaining 5 in charisma. If I need more charisma later, there are spells for<br/>\nit. I can also make rings for only when I sell or buy. If I was to redo my<br/>\ncharacter, I would probably put some points in wisdom instead of charisma.<br/>\nStamina is kind of useless. You get more hp which can help a bit at low<br/>\nlevel, but you really dont care about it at high levels. If everything goes<br/>\nwell, you wont get hit in a fight or just a bit. If it turns wrong, your<br/>\nextra points from charisma wont save you, but extra mana given by<br/>\nintelligence will. In the long run, high charisma is not an issue. You get<br/>\nspells at level 20 that give you a high enough charisma ( at least I would<br/>\nguess, I&#39;m just at 18 ).<br/>\nNow choosing Quellious instead of Agnostic was a bad idea. Although I didnt<br/>\nknow about it, so I guess I&#39;m lucky I didnt pick it up. I had a high level<br/>\ndark-elf necro before and I was tired to get KOS all the time, so when I had<br/>\nthe opportunity to pick agnostic, I jumped on it.<br/>\nrestarting your char? level 9 is still pretty low. You can make it back in a<br/>\nweek or a week and a half. Higher levels take time. If you want to restart<br/>\nit, restart it now! Level 12 is the level at which enchanters really start<br/>\nto shine ( just a bit ). As long as you&#39;re under that, it&#39;s ok. Level 11 was<br/>\na nightmare for me, but since I passed 12, I&#39;ve been flying through levels.<br/>\nmy 2 cents,<br/>\nSkara<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Scott Murawski [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 24, 1999 1:07 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] On a note of mistakes...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Scott Murawski &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI originally put a bunch of my skill points in wisdom (17) - don&#39;t ask me<br/>\nwhy, I can&#39;t think of a good reason.  Plus<br/>\nI chose Quellious instead of agnostic.  I didn&#39;t know about that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m level 9 now and it took a while and a bunch of effort to get there and<br/>\nI&#39;m finally realizing my mistake.  I&#39;m sure if I had to do it again I could<br/>\ndo it quicker though.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst question: Would it be possible to have two characters on the same<br/>\naccount with the same name or would you have to delete one first?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond question: Does not having a really high chr hurt your character alot<br/>\nin the long run?  If I would do it again, I would put starting points into<br/>\nint, chr and sta.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo bad you can&#39;t transfer spell books :(<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just wondering what the recommendation is.  I plan on having a full and<br/>\nfruitful life for my enchanter and wondering if starting over now while I&#39;m<br/>\nonly lv9 is better than going on to much greater levels with a &#39;screwed up<br/>\ncharacter&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance to all the wise enchanters out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAzboklin the enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nScott Murawski                              <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott.murawski@...\">scott.murawski@...</a><br/>\nApplications Speech Engineer                          (voice) 212-425-7600 <br/>\nSpeechWorks Intl, Inc.
