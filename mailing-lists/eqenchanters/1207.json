This is good and bad, good that you don t have to learn any other languages to read the recipe books, bad","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-461797725\">1. there is no Enchanter&#39;s recipe book for spells. This is good and bad, <br/>\ngood that you don&#39;t have to learn any other languages to read the recipe <br/>\nbooks, bad because you have no idea what spell will be created unless you <br/>\nfind the information before hand. Also, on this note, i&#39;ve read that the <br/>\nhigher the page number, the higher the level the spell will be created.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. the mixing of the hate list people are talking about is 99% likely a <br/>\ntypo, I have seen &#39;nixing the hate list&#39; to describe Mesmerize&#39;s action and <br/>\nthe letter m is right next to n on the keyboard.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. crack rock is a lore item and will not combine with any metal to create <br/>\nany type of item. nobody else has found any other weird item, pearl of odus, <br/>\nlight stones, etc to create any jewelry. apparently only generic stones <br/>\ncreate jewelry. save the crack rocks to get mobs addicted to it so they <br/>\nwon&#39;t attack you because they want to buy your crack supply. a mob can never <br/>\nhave enuf crack and they know only Enchatners have the secret recipe to make <br/>\nit. that&#39;s why mobs rage on us sooo much if we don&#39;t give them some crack <br/>\nbefore the first draw of blood, at that point it is too late to offer the <br/>\ncrack since their passion is no longer focused on the smokin but on using <br/>\nyour head for their upcoming lawn bowling tournament. of course, the crack <br/>\nrecipe is only sold in Neriak, look for the merchant talking in elder <br/>\ntier&#39;del about the frankenstein remote control xray robot death machine that <br/>\nlives in his liver. use the keyword &#39;skeezer&#39; to get the conversation <br/>\nrollin.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. there has been an update to jewelry on the test server and this will soon <br/>\nbe patched to the rest of the servers. jade+silver now makes a +5 mana and <br/>\n+5 ac and it can only get better with higher grades of metal!<br/>\n<br/>\n5. if you haven&#39;t heard by now, Alliance is now actually useful. cast it on <br/>\nothers that you are buying/selling from when the items cost/sell more than a <br/>\nplat to save yourself some money. if you already have wickedly high chr, you <br/>\nmight not notice any affect because you are at the best price level and <br/>\ncan&#39;t get any further increases in your buying/selling power. combining a <br/>\nrace illusion with Alliance may or may not improve your prices/keep you safe <br/>\nfrom psycho guards, an email I got from GZ states that using Alliance and <br/>\nrace illusions together can and will get your better deals, more quests, or <br/>\nkeep you safe from certain psycho guards. this means that using both spells <br/>\nat once doesn&#39;t always give enough of a boost in your overall faction to <br/>\nnotice the difference, which makes sense because if both spells &#39;had&#39; to <br/>\nraise your level at least by one that&#39;d end up making that combo a tad too <br/>\npowerful.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. if you have a spare minute or two, send a short thank you email to GZ at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Gzatkin@...\">Gzatkin@...</a> for helping Enchanters get their spells tweaked so that <br/>\nthe hardest class isn&#39;t also the most frustrating class to play. GZ is the <br/>\nhead magic man at VI, in case you didn&#39;t know, and his main character is an <br/>\nEnchatner so he has a special affinity for the class. he also Usually <br/>\nanswers politely asked and rational questions within a few days too as long <br/>\nas you don&#39;t constantly pester him. can&#39;t say that bout UO!<br/>\n<br/>\nqrent`grammar is a tool of fascism`qent<br/>\n<br/>\nall information is correct as far as I know; however, since I am not the 2nd <br/>\ncoming of Christ(least that&#39;s what my dr keeps telling me), I have been <br/>\nknown to make the occasional innacurate statement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
