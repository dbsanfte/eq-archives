Here&#39;s some that I know of:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unrest to Dagnar&#39;s Cauldron:<br/>\n&gt; If you are hit on your way out of Unrest you may fall &quot;below&quot; the world.<br/>\n&gt; You will find yourself in the water under the land which goes around the<br/>\n&gt; lake.  When this happened to my wife I suggested she swim off the edge.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t do that!  She fell for 10,000 points of damage and I had to get my<br/>\n&gt; necro to locate her corpse (which was beneath the land near 0,0).  Without a<br/>\n&gt; necro we would have never found it.  Meanwhile we had petitioned a GM and he<br/>\n&gt; was sad when he finally got to us because my wife had already looted her<br/>\n&gt; corpse otherwise he would have res&#39;ed her.  When the same thing happened to<br/>\n&gt; me I knew not to swim of the edge but what to do?  I swam to the middle and<br/>\n&gt; climbed up the island.  Once you do this you can swim back to the land and<br/>\n&gt; climb up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oasis to No Ro:<br/>\n&gt; If you are hit hard enough (sand giant, etc.) on your way out of Unrest you<br/>\n&gt; may find yourself near the inn but the kicker is you will fall for some<br/>\n&gt; small amount of damage.  It&#39;s not much but if you were almost dead you will<br/>\n&gt; be dead after you fall.  This is a change from a while back where you would<br/>\n&gt; bounce back into Oasis at full health (which was kind of cool).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Beholder Maze to Runneyeye:<br/>\n&gt; Had to run from a train that was led into the entrance of Runneyeye.  Got<br/>\n&gt; hit going through apparently and died.  My corpse was not on either side of<br/>\n&gt; the zone.  I managed to find it in Runneye in the first alcove to the left<br/>\n&gt; by the little stream.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone know of others?<br/>\n&gt; Shawn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jenni [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 21, 1999 12:36 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] Digest Number 205<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Jenni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On fighting in Lavastorm:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Be very very careful if you are fighting near the entrance to Najena.  This<br/>\n&gt; has<br/>\n&gt; happened to me and a friend of mine.  After being ambushed by 3 fire<br/>\n&gt; elementals<br/>\n&gt; while looting my corpse (I just got all my armor, but my bags were on my<br/>\n&gt; corpse)  I ran to the zone to Najena because there was no way I was going to<br/>\n&gt; live otherwise.  Instead of zoning into the hallway where you&#39;re supposed to<br/>\n&gt; end<br/>\n&gt; up, I ended up in a room full of Magicians and pets and was immediately<br/>\n&gt; killed.<br/>\n&gt; I had to petition to get my corpse (which took 2 hours).  The GM that helped<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; was very nice and pulled my corpse out to safety for me.  When this happened<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; a friend of mine the GM&#39;s weren&#39;t quite so nice.  They didn&#39;t believe that<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; just zoned in to avoid a monster they believed he was &quot;exploring&quot; in Najena<br/>\n&gt; (at<br/>\n&gt; level 12!).  It took him 2 hours of arguing with a GM before he got his<br/>\n&gt; corpse<br/>\n&gt; back.  Both GM&#39;s mentioned that this does happen occasionally at that zone<br/>\n&gt; edge<br/>\n&gt; (the second GM said my friend&#39;s corpse was on the wrong side of the room :(<br/>\n&gt; ).<br/>\n&gt; I have no idea if or when they plan on fixing it. :(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has this happened to anyone else?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ezrae<br/>\n&gt; Still level 14<br/>\n&gt; Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Paul Jesernig wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Paul Jesernig&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwj@...\">pwj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Solo hunting? Lavastorm is ok, you can hunt near Najena and zone if you<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a problem. Don&#39;t know how much gear you have, as you hit the harder things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;ll need a magic weapon. Yard trash in Unrest is also very good at this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level, there&#39;s about 6 spawn spots inside the maze just past the fountains<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where you will be off the tracks. I think the regular aviaks (not the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guards) in front of the Arena in Lake Rathe should be ok, though they may<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too low. There&#39;s also a lizard man camp in Rathe Mountains (one outrunner<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and 2 in camp). The Southern Ro dervish camps have an outrunner at each<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you can go back and forth between or join a group doing one of the camps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (the east one is preferable, there&#39;s a safe area near the grass where you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can pull to and no ghouls or dry bones will wander through). The solo<br/>\n&gt; dervs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; may spawn a little tough on occasion, but you can kite those using fear.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Might be able to do the orc camp in misty thicket, not sure exactly how<br/>\n&gt; high<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they are, but level 10-12 I think. If you can get  4 or 5 people together,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the orc camps in Rathe Mountains are great experience and loot. There&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my good spots (good as in loot, experience, and rarely occupied).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lozi ~Hand of Chaos~ CT<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Date: Sun, 19 Dec 1999 18:00:28 -0600<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Richard Slater&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:richie@...\">richie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Hunting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am level 12 and looking for some good hunting grounds, I think I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; gunna<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; try lavastorm today so I&#39;ll see how that goes.
