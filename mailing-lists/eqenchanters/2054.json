From the recent posts, a lot of people are upset about the changes to<br/>\n&gt; enchanters in pvp.  My question is why?  I have not tried pvp and have no<br/>\n&gt; reference.  Isn&#39;t the point still to kill npc&#39;s for loot and exp?  In pvp,<br/>\n&gt; does that change?  I mean, Do you get loot or exp from fighting other<br/>\n&gt; players?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brian<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
