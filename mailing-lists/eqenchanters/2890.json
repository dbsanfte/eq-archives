Charming I<br/>\nuse more for crowd control or in a situation where I have someone backing me<br/>\nup if it breaks at the wrong time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for pets and weapons, it really doesn&#39;t do them any good (except make<br/>\nthem look cool sometimes :).  It used to be that giving you pet a dagger<br/>\nwould increase it&#39;s speed without affecting damage, but that is not the case<br/>\nanymore.  Your pet will do the same damage at the same speed no matter what<br/>\nit wields.  Eventually, however, you pet will gain the ability to dual<br/>\nwield, in which case giving it two weapons will help, but I forget what<br/>\nlevel they get it at.<br/>\n<br/>\nTinik Gutenungrie<br/>\nGnomish Enchanter, Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rich Hitz [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rich.Hitz@...\">Rich.Hitz@...</a>]On Behalf Of (Uthanatos)<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 06, 2000 12:12 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;(EQ Enchanters)&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Charm vs level 12 pet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it better to use your pet at 12th or to charm?
