Rune I is a great spell, its a lot like divine aura (cleric).  More or<br/>\nless it grants invunerability for a short time which I&#39;m sure you can<br/>\nimagine is quite handy.  A good spell to have!<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Jade is also available in Akanon, at the jeweler immediately beside the<br/>\nbankers, as are all other stones except perhaps black pearls or wolfs eye<br/>\nagate.  The metals are available in the room nearest the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  I have recently aquired a level 44 spell : Brilliance and want to know<br/>\nwhat it does.  This sounds a lot like the &#39;enchantment of brilliance&#39; spell<br/>\nwhich was supposedly removed from the game.  Has anyone USED this spell?<br/>\nIf I get a good offer I may sell it, it is quite a ways from where I am<br/>\n(lvl wise) and I can probably get it again.  You can /tell me on Rallos Zek<br/>\nif you are interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg - Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:41 PM 5/24/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: HiFi Review &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hifireview@...\">hifireview@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Can anyone give me a good description of how Rune spells work and a<br/>\n&gt;strategy for using them effectivel?.
