I am a 14th lvl<br/>\nenchanter on Rallos Zek, and either the market on the care bear servers is<br/>\nmuch healthier or I&#39;m really having a LOT of bad luck.  I&#39;m lucky if I can<br/>\nsell a new silver jaded ring for 10 plat, and those bloodstone earrings are<br/>\nreally my main staple since everyone wants earrings these days.  For all<br/>\nyou people with +1000 plat in the bank.. well I&#39;d really like to hear your<br/>\nmethods of achieving this... I&#39;m ALWAYS hovering under 20 platinum before I<br/>\nblow it all on Jewels and metals... and I&#39;ve never had more than 30 pat<br/>\ntotal inthe bank!  WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT I&#39;M NOT?!?  You have obviously<br/>\nsome secrets that I am completely unaware of, and I&#39;d sure like some hints.<br/>\n Currently my enc is around crushbone since Kelethin is a good place for<br/>\nmaterials (but BAD for markets) and I find its difficult to find a good<br/>\nplace to &#39;hang around&#39; off of faywer (gnomes arent as loved as they should<br/>\nbe).  I suppose some of this has to do with being on RAllos Zek and I<br/>\nshould assume some level of difficulty but I really would like to explore<br/>\nthis skill to its fullest.
