Apparently a more expensive type of metal must be<br/>\nused to get magic jewelry out of the above stones.<br/>\nBelow is a short list of the magic jewelry that I have created using<br/>\nenchanted silver.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Jade           = Jaded Silver Ring,<br/>\nEffect: MANA +5<br/>\n1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Pearl           = Silvered Pearl Ring,<br/>\nEffect: VS POISON +4<br/>\n1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Topaz         = Topaz Silver Necklace,<br/>\nEffect: VS DISEASE +4<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I was wondering why there are four slots in the jewelry kit.  So I<br/>\nbriefly tried a couple attempts using multiple stones.  Since both attempts<br/>\nwere unsuccesful and this type of experimenting is expensive I discontinued<br/>\nthis experiment until later.  These are the failed attempts:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Malachite + 1 Lapis Lazuli = &quot;These<br/>\ncombinations and quantities  of items fail to combine to produce anything.&quot;<br/>\n1 Bar of Silver + 1 Lapis Lazuli + 1 Turquoise = &quot;These combinations and<br/>\nquantities of items fail to combine to produce anything.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone can add to this list, please feel free.<br/>\nAlso, if anyone can tell me how the skill cap is calculated for jewelcraft I<br/>\nwould like to know, I have a level 14 Enchanter who has a 30 in jewelcraft.<br/>\nAfter hitting 30 my skill has not risen even after numerous attempts to<br/>\nraise it.  Am I maxed for my level?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFren<br/>\nGnome, Enchanter<br/>\nTunare Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
