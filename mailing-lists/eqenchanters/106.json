One sad evening, coming back from a<br/>\n&gt; very long quest that brought me to Kerra Island and South Karana, I got<br/>\n&gt; hacked multiple times in Riverdale losing about 4 bubs of xp because my<br/>\n&gt; invis wore off on me randomly. I got really pissed off that at level 16, I<br/>\n&gt; could not manage to cast a level 8 spell reliably and decided to start<br/>\n&gt; another character more appropriate for travelling since I was very much<br/>\ninto<br/>\n&gt; research and quests.<br/>\n&gt; With my enchantress, I got invisibility at level 4 and used it some times.<br/>\n&gt; It always seemed to work great but I might be wrong. Yesterday, I found<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; that this invisibility spell is as bad as gather shadows as a %$#%^^%$<br/>\n&gt; griffin nuked me a few seconds after I cast invisibility. Since then, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; noticed the same kind on unreliability...but only since I made level 8...I<br/>\n&gt; might be wrong.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I would like to know how&#39;s the enchanter&#39;s invisibility like at<br/>\n&gt; level 16 or 20 or more. CAN YOU COUNT ON IT?<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Skara, the pissed-off dark-elf Necro from Fennin-Ro<br/>\n&gt; now known as Skara, the enchantress from Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; You can now easily share photos and documents with your fellow list<br/>\nmembers<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out our homepage for details on how to use our new shared files<br/>\nfeature!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
