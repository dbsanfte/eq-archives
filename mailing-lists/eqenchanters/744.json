My best guess is<br/>\nthat indeed your invisiblity ran out, it happens quite abruptly, you<br/>\ndon&#39;t usually even see it blink.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Ric R &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:redr@...\">redr@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Ric R &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:redr@...\">redr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am sorry to say, chances are your invso failed,<br/>\n&gt; and the orc jumped you<br/>\n&gt; right off. I&#39;ve had invso drop without notice<br/>\n&gt; before, as a matter a fact,<br/>\n&gt; only twice since EQ went production (march 17) I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; had invso last for the<br/>\n&gt; full durration.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Telan Ka`Rlaah<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 06:21 PM 5/8/99 -0000, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rival@...\">rival@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m sorry if this message sounds bad, but i love<br/>\n&gt; the game, just a little<br/>\n&gt; upset right now.  I finally made 8th level, and so<br/>\n&gt; off I go to get my pet<br/>\n&gt; spell.  I had read many reports on this list, so I<br/>\n&gt; thought myself prepared.<br/>\n&gt;  After about an hour and a half trip from Felwithe,<br/>\n&gt; I finally reach High<br/>\n&gt; Hold Pass.  My invisibility still going strong, I<br/>\n&gt; procede in a short<br/>\n&gt; distance only to be rooted and killed by some<br/>\n&gt; #@!!@#$ orc who could see<br/>\n&gt; invisible.  I came from Kithicor forest.  Was I just<br/>\n&gt; unlucky?  Is there<br/>\n&gt; another better way in, other than through kithicor? <br/>\n&gt; That place is insane.<br/>\n&gt; How do they expect us to ever get a pet at this<br/>\n&gt; level?  I&#39;ve been hearing<br/>\n&gt; Mages whine about have to research 24th level pets. <br/>\n&gt; How about getting<br/>\n&gt; screwed out of 8th level.  If my bitching is<br/>\n&gt; unfounded, please tell me.  I<br/>\n&gt; will appologize.  If there is an easier way, or I<br/>\n&gt; just got unlucky, let me<br/>\n&gt; know.
