At least for now until we know more.  Not meaning to be<br/>\nrude as I think we have good information to pass back and forth on other<br/>\ntopics.  But, this is beginning to remind me of arguments with my wife<br/>\nabout who would take out the trash or what exactly did I mean when I<br/>\nsaid &lt;blank&gt;. Now, let&#39;s not confuse this with the &quot;your computer means<br/>\nmore to you than me&quot; fights cause those are in another league and they<br/>\njust don&#39;t understand hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this is the kind of thread that discourages people from being a<br/>\npart of mailing lists.

To me, this is far more &#39;tangible<br/>\nand<br/>\ninformative&#39; than saying that Stratics says something, ergo it must be<br/>\ntrue.<br/>\n<br/>\n.........ppl just argur for the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;sake of the arguement I think<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of couse, arguing is fun. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n......oh well....until Stratics proves to be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;wrong or has falsified information I will continue to read their site<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;take it to heart<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Firstly, I never even suggested that Stratics falsified information.<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\ntalked with eqss people in the chat rooms in beta, and grouped with one<br/>\nearly in retail.  They&#39;re good, honest people.  However, they are *not*<br/>\nperfect.  You want an example of wrong info on the sight?  Okie dokie.<br/>\nIf<br/>\nyou look under thier class reference chart, you&#39;ll see that barbarians<br/>\nare<br/>\nlarge sized creatures, and it will say that, for example, high elves are<br/>\nsmall/medium.

The simple fact is, Verant has not released a great deal of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&#39;number crunching&#39; information, so I&#39;m likely to at least pay attention<br/>\nto<br/>\nsomeone who comes up with new information rather than dismissing it out<br/>\nof<br/>\nhand do to its not being known beforehand.  *All* the information that<br/>\nis<br/>\nonce stratics was once this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n......and by the by.......MANY of the authors of EQ are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;directly involved with GMs and what not....just becuase they arent<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Verant<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;EMPLOYEES dusnt mean they dont have inside information.......<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll admit befuddlement as to what you mean when you say &quot;many of the<br/>\nauthors of EQ are directly involved with EQ...&quot;.  I assume you mean that<br/>\nthe<br/>\nauthors of EQSS or perhaps EQVault there rather than EQ.  I&#39;m quite<br/>\ncertain<br/>\nthat the authors of EQ are involved with the GMs. ;)  However, neing<br/>\nfriends<br/>\nwith the admins of CoN, I can assure you that GMs do *not* give out<br/>\nspecific<br/>\nnumber crunching values to anyone.
