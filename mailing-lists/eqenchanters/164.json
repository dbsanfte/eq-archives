This attribute also affects your character&#39;s resistance against<br/>\n&gt;mind-affecting spells, such as Charm. In addition, WIS provides a last<br/>\n&gt;chance to succeed at a failed skill roll. Although INT is the secondary<br/>\n&gt;skill-up attribute for most skills, WIS may grant you to continue a failed<br/>\n&gt;skill roll.
