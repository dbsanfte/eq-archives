When they resist<br/>\nthey don&#39;t always agro, most of the time they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMez has already been described.<br/>\n<br/>\nok, now what I have done for some camps is to Lull everything and pull.  Now<br/>\nif one saves and pulls a partial camp, I mez the ones that come after us.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*notes on lull*  Make sure you Lull/sooth the furthest back.  If an agro<br/>\nmost monster past a lulled one.. they will agro as well.  If you do it<br/>\nright, and it works, lull the back ones.. pull the front, and mez the ones<br/>\nagro if more than one come.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmony is the best though, but playing all 3 characters, I have used them<br/>\nall.. Lull and mez is a poor mans substitute for Harmony.  I have used the<br/>\ncombo successfully in an indoor dungeon though.  Lull one and pull another..<br/>\nif they resist lull then mez till the tanks take them out.  BTW lull line<br/>\ndoes not work on an agro mob.  Good luck, has anyone else done it this way?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
