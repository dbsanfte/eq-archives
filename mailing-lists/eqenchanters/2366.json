It&#39;s *great*<br/>\nexperience and enchanter pages are dropped there so you can buy and loot<br/>\nsome level 16 and 20 research components.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanters aren&#39;t that great at soloing, although it *is* possible.  I think<br/>\nthat you&#39;ll find that after each fight you&#39;ve used a big chunk of your mana<br/>\nand your pet is hurt pretty badly.  In other words your downtime when<br/>\nsoloing is terrible compared to other classes like Necros.  My primary char<br/>\nis a 47th bard who shares a lot of skills (albeit watered down) of an<br/>\nenchanter, as well as some aspects of rogues and tanks.  Bards can&#39;t solo<br/>\nwell either, it&#39;s just not how the class was designed.  Personally one<br/>\nreason that I picked bard and enchanter is because they are group classes.<br/>\nI suppose I&#39;d level a lot faster if I was soloing, but hey I *like* grouping<br/>\nwith competent groups and showing off my (our) skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI admit that I did solo and work in pickup groups in Oasis 16 to 19, and<br/>\nthen the call of Unrest was too great.  I got a port to Butcherblock and<br/>\nwent.  I didn&#39;t do Unrest too much as a bard, but my 23rd monk spent a good<br/>\ndeal of time there.  The place is *dangerous*.  It&#39;s train city, the mobs<br/>\nhave a wide level range and agro on everything in sight.  It&#39;s PERFECT for<br/>\nand enchanter to show off!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I was in Unrest at level 19.  I was in a pickup group of four<br/>\nclerics (!), a paladin and myself, so we really were dangerous to the<br/>\nundead.  We were in the Round Room around back pulling stuff.  On three<br/>\ndifferent occassions our Paladin pulled trains of ~8 mobs ranging from red<br/>\nto blue.  On each of these occassionas I was able to Mez the whole crowd,<br/>\npick one off, charm it and sick it on the active mob or two that the clerics<br/>\nwere fighting.  A couple of times either I or the clerics ran oom and we had<br/>\nto zone from the last mob or two, but when I said &quot;Guys it&#39;s 3am I gotta<br/>\nlog.&quot;, three of the group simultaneously said basically &#39;Well hell, we&#39;re<br/>\nscrewed now.&#39;  YES!  It&#39;s hard to feel more useful than when clerics<br/>\nfighting undead feel screwed that you&#39;re leaving.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrowd control, buffing and debuffing - it&#39;s what enchanters do best and it<br/>\nreally only helps groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nChiming<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Jenni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think for now I&#39;m going to stay in Guk, or Rathe Mtns.  Both<br/>\n&gt; zones are rarely<br/>\n&gt; crowded, and the lower level mobs that I can kill are rarely camped.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; getting sick of the crowded zones.  Befallen is OK, but it seemed<br/>\n&gt; a bit crowded<br/>\n&gt; for me.  My only experience with Najena was when I zoned in and<br/>\n&gt; ended up in a<br/>\n&gt; room full of magicians and pets and promptly got killed and almost lost my<br/>\n&gt; corpse for good.  I do want to go there in a few more levels though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Question about Soloing:  Now that I&#39;m 16 it&#39;s been very difficult<br/>\n&gt; for me to<br/>\n&gt; solo, even with a pet.  My new level 16 spells use tons of mana,<br/>\n&gt; and I end up<br/>\n&gt; either running out before I kill the mob, or coming very close to<br/>\n&gt; it.  Either<br/>\n&gt; way I end up medding and healing for a long time between kills.<br/>\n&gt; It hardly seems<br/>\n&gt; efficient.  Any suggestions on soloing at level 16?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Ezrae<br/>\n&gt; 16th level DE Enchantress<br/>\n&gt; Brell Serilis </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
