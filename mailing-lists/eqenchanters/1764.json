Last night I made level 8<br/>\nand would like to obtain the Enchant Silver spell. It is my understanding the<br/>\nspell is located in the Library in Neriak, a place to which I haven&#39;t been.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is: as a high-elf enchanter, am I KOS in Neriak? (I&#39;m betting<br/>\nprobably so...) If so, what strategies did you use to obtain the spell? I have<br/>\nnot seen anyone in in Greater Faydark selling the spell on the Erollisi Marr<br/>\nserver.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour comments will be most helpful. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChristine<br/>\nknown Minbari on Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
