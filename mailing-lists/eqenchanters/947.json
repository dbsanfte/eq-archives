It took me 4 &#39;played&#39; days and a half to get it to level 16. then I<br/>\ngave it up. I have now a level 16 enchanter. It took me 12 &#39;played&#39; days to<br/>\nmake it to 16... You think that&#39;s a problem for me? I had so much more fun<br/>\nplaying an enchanter. What&#39;s the deal with this level race? Sometimes I&#39;ll<br/>\nspend an hour travelling back and forth just to say hi to a friend I havent<br/>\nseen for a long time. Right now, I&#39;m hunting in CrushBone and I barely make<br/>\nany xp where I could be soloing in Lavastorm and make a shit load of xp and<br/>\nmoney..but what&#39;s the big deal? I enjoy playing Everquest a lot more now.<br/>\nPowergaming is so boring. So are those people who start a race everytime  a<br/>\nnew server comes up.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy 2 cents,<br/>\nSkara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
