Most of the stuff in Skyshrine are VERY <br/>\nhard for their level.  At 37 I&#39;m not sure how well you&#39;d do there...<br/>\n<br/>\nStats you listed are for the Guardian Robe- and it is nice =) (but <br/>\nugly as sin - pink and dakrer blue)<br/>\n<br/>\nOther robe is the Sentry Robe (+11 AC +5 Str +5 Dex +9 Int +20 Mana )<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wrong below- the robe I should have listed in Charasis is the <br/>\nSiren Scale Robe (+10 AC +10 Int +10 vsMg +10vsCold)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a couple of robes in the Crystal Caverns that attainable at <br/>\nthat level (and very nice). Blackened Crystalline Robe (+8 AC +6 Int <br/>\n+5 Cha +10 vsCold) is the easier and looks like the PoF Necro robe.  <br/>\nthe harder one comes off the Queen, and is called the Crystalline <br/>\nRobes (+10 AC +2 Agi +6 Int +5 vsMg +10 vsCold +10 Mana).  Both very <br/>\nnice.<br/>\n<br/>\nCourse, the Sarnak Arcane Fetish is a fairly common drop, so it wont <br/>\nbe too expensive, and the robes I listed below are fairly easy to get <br/>\nin trade items once the other people upgrade.  Lots of SMRs and FBCRs <br/>\navailable for pp (although SMRs are still somewhat pricey due to the <br/>\nfact they are used in several epic quests).<br/>\n<br/>\n/cheers<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In eqenchanters@y..., &quot;Nygaardr, FC3&quot; &lt;nygaardr@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you can stand the looks there is a very nice robe in Skyshrine <br/>\ncant<br/>\n&gt; remember if its the sentry or guardian I got mine after about 8 <br/>\nhours of<br/>\n&gt; helping my brothers group kill stuff.

If this is how you normally play the game, here are some <br/>\n&gt; recommendations for alternate equipment:<br/>\n&gt; 1. Neck- Plat Saphire Necklace (7int 7str)<br/>\n&gt; 2. Head- Nightshade wreath (1ac 5int 5 wis)<br/>\n&gt; 3.

Back- Mystic Cloak (listed in shoulder slot) or Molten Cloak<br/>\n&gt; 5. Feet- Wolf Fur Slippers (just +mana, but no real upgrades until <br/>\n&gt; EBoots)<br/>\n&gt; 6.
