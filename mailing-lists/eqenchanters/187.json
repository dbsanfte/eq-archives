Just keep<br/>\nusing the cheap gems until you get the &quot;too trivial&quot; message and then move<br/>\nto the next gem up in the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nDjar Lightbringer, Chancellor of HOA (Tarew Marr Server)<br/>\nServant of Light, Deliverer of the Truth to Norrath<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hoa-rpg.com/\">http://www.hoa-rpg.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcent@...\">jcent@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcent@...\">jcent@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, April 21, 1999 9:18 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] Jewelry and skill raises<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcent@...\">jcent@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hail and well met, fellow enchanters!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am Fistlebane, high elf enchanter {of The Rathe server}.    I started my<br/>\n&gt; jewelry making craft fairly recently (after sinking about<br/>\n&gt; practice points).<br/>\n&gt; I found that when I try to use lapis or malachite that I receive<br/>\n&gt; a message:<br/>\n&gt; these items are trivial for your skill level.  I stepped up to Cat&#39;s Eye<br/>\n&gt; and made about 5 necklaces with Cat&#39;s eye...but got no visible message<br/>\n&gt; telling me that my skill had raised.  I am impatient?  How many attempts<br/>\n&gt; are required, generally, before you see an increase?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the feedback.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fistlebane<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist<br/>\n&gt; of the Week!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
