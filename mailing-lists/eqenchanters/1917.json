I cannot belive that is possible that in qeynos dont exist seller of<br/>\n&gt;tinny dagers, it is so big city there must be one seller but maybe hard to<br/>\n&gt;find i spent nearly a day searching but i dont find it. Please if you know<br/>\n&gt;where it is to share it with this list so that a enchanters dont have to<br/>\n&gt;travel to other side of ocean or to freeport to get daggers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks in advance<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dilith  8 lv Enchanter, Soulsek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\n&gt;programs, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
