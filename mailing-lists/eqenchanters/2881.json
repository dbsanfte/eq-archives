After I hit 8th, I put 10 points into evocation<br/>\nsince the spell itself sucks alot of mana. Now When I look forward, I see<br/>\nresearch at 16 and nothing again til 20 for specialization, then dodge at<br/>\n22, then nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if what I read is correct at 16, 17, 18, and 19 I can train 1 point into<br/>\nresearch for each level. At 20 I can put as many points into it as I wish.<br/>\nIs this correct?<br/>\nDo I save my points and pump research to the max at 20 (70 minus the 5 for<br/>\nspecialization)?<br/>\nHow hard is it to be successful at 16 with a skill of 1?<br/>\nMy primary char is collecting lefts, rights, faded pages, etc. so that I can<br/>\nincrease skill but I would like to know my odds for when I actually start<br/>\nusing the pages for research.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nUthanatos</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
