I was disturbed by how often<br/>\nI was fizzling on Chaotic because I too solo and needed a spell I could<br/>\ncount on.  When your pet is about dead and you know you won&#39;t be able to<br/>\nsolo or park the monster with a reasonable degree of certainty it&#39;s nice to<br/>\nnuke it to death.  Pour some points into Evocation.  Worry about jewelcraft<br/>\nlater.  If you&#39;ve read some of the messages in the other thread about<br/>\njewelcraft you&#39;ll see the amount of money we&#39;re talking to become a master -<br/>\n10,000s of plat probably.  It&#39;s not worth trying to sell silver jewelry (at<br/>\nleast I wouldn&#39;t choose this over putting points into evocation).  You&#39;ll<br/>\nsell a few here and there but most people will turn their nose&#39;s up at<br/>\nsilver jewelry.  Can&#39;t enchant electrum till 16 and won&#39;t have much money to<br/>\nmess around with jewelcraft till then anyway.  I would recommend putting<br/>\npoints into melee stuff in the very beginning to help stay alive and then<br/>\ndon&#39;t be afraid to put some points into evocation at or before 8.  I hardly<br/>\never fail on Chaotic Feedback at 13 now!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rich Hitz [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rich.Hitz@...\">Rich.Hitz@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 1:07 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqenchanters] Evocation!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Rich Hitz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rich.Hitz@...\">Rich.Hitz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nEvo is not really a nessecity, even at level 8.<br/>\n&lt;Snip&gt;<br/>\nSince the 8th level spell Chaotic Feedback is the upgrade for our 1st level<br/>\nDD spell, and the 12th Level spell Choke is the upgrade to our 4th level DoT<br/>\nspell do you mind telling me how you advanced in level without using them<br/>\nthat much?  Is it because you group all the time? I solo alot do to lag<br/>\nissues, which makes me unreliable in groups. This makes things tough, but I<br/>\nfind it necessary to be able to rely on my current Rank of spells. This<br/>\nmeans keeping all the Spell Abilities maxxed as quickly as possible.<br/>\nI already see that Enchanters alternate upgrades to DD and Dot spells every<br/>\nother Rank. That makes for an Interesting combination. I will play around<br/>\nwith that tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nAND STOP NUKING YOURSELF.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nSince I am only 4th level and I do not have this spell yet, I&#39;m not nuking<br/>\nmyself. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;another rant&gt;<br/>\nI have known something was not right and I just figured it out why it was<br/>\nbothering me. Our Level 1 DD spell (and every DoT spell) is an Alteration<br/>\nspell. Every DD spell afer 1st level except the AE DD spell at 39th level is<br/>\nEvocation. Why the change? By this I mean why did it go from an Alteration<br/>\nspell at 1st to an Evocation spell up until level 39 where it becomes an<br/>\nAlteration spell, and then back to an Evocation spell?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, why do we skip an upgrade to the 12th level DoT at 20th level? This is<br/>\nthe only level that this happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, get me going and I can&#39;t stop. Expect alot of twisted questions<br/>\n from me. Why? Because I like active lists. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBahir<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I hate not knowing why.  I can handle anything as long as I understand<br/>\nwhy.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
