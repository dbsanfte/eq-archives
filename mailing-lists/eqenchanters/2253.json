Say you&#39;re KOS there, and are<br/>\nnot an enchanter so you can&#39;t cast an illusion.  Is it at all possible?<br/>\nI&#39;ve checked every everquest website that I know of for the faction hits<br/>\nfor the various monsters and I don&#39;t see anything about raising or<br/>\nlowering faction with these groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m KOS in Kaladim with or without illusions, and Alliance doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhelp.  Anything I can/should do to raise faction with them as well?  I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t able to find a whole lot about the Kaladim Guards.  What group do<br/>\nthey belong to?<br/>\n<br/>\nLast but not least: this is for any DE enchanters out there.<br/>\nCrushbone:  Should I or shouldn&#39;t I?  The only faction I will lose is<br/>\nwith the Warriors Guild in Neriak (Indigo Brotherhood), and I will gain<br/>\na lot of faction where I&#39;m currently KOS.  BUT I don&#39;t necessairly want<br/>\nto make myself KOS in my own hometown either..  comments?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I&#39;m not agnostic.  Makes things a bit tougher, but that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat keeps the game fun. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEzrae<br/>\n14th Level Dark Elf Enchanter<br/>\nBrell Serilis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
