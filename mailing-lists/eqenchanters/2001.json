I was casting Color Shift on him,<br/>\nhoping to stun him and stop his casting. But I noticed that when I cast it,<br/>\nnothing would happen. If he had been affected by the spell,<br/>\nI would have seen &quot;Soandso is stunned by scintilating colors.&quot; If he had<br/>\nresisted the spell, I would have seen &quot;Soandso resisted the<br/>\nColor Shift spell.&quot; I saw neither of these messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didnt see any message at all when i cast it. I thought I might have been<br/>\nin error, maybe i had memorized the wrong spell. So we<br/>\ntried it again, and i made absolutely sure I had Color Shift memorized.<br/>\nSure enough, we tested it out, and he wasnt stunned. The<br/>\nspell had no effect on him whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have used Color Shift in duels quite a few times, and until recently it<br/>\nhas worked splendidly! But this was the first time I had dueled<br/>\nsince the Temple of Solusek Ro patch...perhaps that has something to do<br/>\nwith it? Can anyone offer any input in this matter? Has<br/>\nthis been going on for awhile, and I just haven&#39;t heard about it? I check<br/>\ncaster related sites quite frequently, and have never seen<br/>\nanything regarding this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTimn the Enchanter<br/>\nEan Travis on the RL server<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are some who call me . . . Timn?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
