If I just stand where I am and not<br/>\n&gt;follow, will my pet following the wisp cause a train if wisps are in the area?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Generally speaking your pet will attract things that wouldn&#39;t touch you but<br/>\nin the case of running or fighting mobs, all mobs call for help as they<br/>\nfight so if another mob is nearby it will respond.  In other words if there<br/>\nare other wisops close enough they will jump in regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, since I&#39;m getting close to level 16, I might as well start pouring on<br/>\n&gt;the questions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does levitate last long?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Long enough, 10 mins maybe. There is a slight bug with levitate thouhg where<br/>\nsometimes people and other things like mobs not beign on the same z axis as<br/>\nyou become invisible. Happens randomly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve heard that quickness doesn&#39;t last long and I notice that it has a high<br/>\n&gt;mana requirement.  What level is it<br/>\n&gt;mana efficient to use at? (eq similar to chaotic feedback, at lv 8, it<br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t so mana efficient)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If your partied with a Monk always use it. If you are drawing a CONTINOUS<br/>\nstring of blues then it usually lasts 2 fights. I always wait two levels<br/>\nbefore really using a new spell because at that point the fizzle rate and<br/>\nmana efficiency are better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think I&#39;ve seen it before, but I can&#39;t remember.  Rune I uses a component<br/>\n&gt;right?  What is it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cats eye agate, 2.8 gold or thereabouts. You will probably not be casting<br/>\nthis spell to often. It only protects from meleee and it costs to much for<br/>\nregular use.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSilverlock,  ICQ 474725\t\t\t<br/>\n<br/>\nHousehold Pests?
