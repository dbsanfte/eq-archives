I finally made 8th level, and so off I go to get my pet<br/>\nspell.  I had read many reports on this list, so I thought myself prepared.<br/>\n After about an hour and a half trip from Felwithe, I finally reach High<br/>\nHold Pass.  My invisibility still going strong, I procede in a short<br/>\ndistance only to be rooted and killed by some #@!!@#$ orc who could see<br/>\ninvisible.  I came from Kithicor forest.  Was I just unlucky?  Is there<br/>\nanother better way in, other than through kithicor?  That place is insane.<br/>\nHow do they expect us to ever get a pet at this level?  I&#39;ve been hearing<br/>\nMages whine about have to research 24th level pets.  How about getting<br/>\nscrewed out of 8th level.  If my bitching is unfounded, please tell me.  I<br/>\nwill appologize.  If there is an easier way, or I just got unlucky, let me<br/>\nknow.
