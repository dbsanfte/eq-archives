It stunned a mob and<br/>\nallowed us to keep fighting them. Totally nerfed it now stuns them only<br/>\nuntil theya re stunned, which occurs with all our direct damage spells,<br/>\nwhich our pet does, which all tanks basically do, etc. Also there is now a<br/>\nrandom chance to break free each hit. Basically you waste 55 mana for 2<br/>\nseconds of stunning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMemory Blur. No damage, no stun, all it did was remove a mobs shit list. If<br/>\nit was ana gro mob it would still come after you if you were in range. This<br/>\nwas however sueful for saving the lives of group members targeted by giants<br/>\nor stuff, or getting a frenzied mob of a caster because it was unresistable.<br/>\nAfter the change I cast it on a Dry bone skellie that was about 4 levles<br/>\nabove me and it wouldn&#39;t get off the tank who died. I soon followed. Spell<br/>\nvalue is now zero since if its resistable why not just use mesmerize which<br/>\nis also resistable and at least ahs a stun effect as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemovement of the Enchantment of light and brilliance.<br/>\n<br/>\nDirect damage spells that ahve &quot;stuns&quot; that don&#39;t work, yet cause us to ahve<br/>\ntotal resists instead of partial ones and a higher overall resist rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on but I am pressed for time.<br/>\n--<br/>\nSilverlock,  ICQ 474725\t\t\t<br/>\n<br/>\nHousehold Pests?
