I have been<br/>\ntold that the only place to get Mircyl&#39;s Animation is in High<br/>\nHold Keep. I know the way is treacherous, and am asking for<br/>\nhelp from my fellow enchanters. Attached below is a map of<br/>\nHigh Hold Pass that I got off of one of the most incredible EQ<br/>\nmap sites I have seen to date. Unfortunately, almost everything<br/>\non the site is in Japanese. If one of you who has made the trip <br/>\ncould mark the path to take from Kithicor to the bank, then to<br/>\nthe vendor who sells the spells and maybe annotate a few <br/>\nthings to watch out for (like the prisoners past the bank), I, along<br/>\nwith all the up-and-coming enchanters out there, would be<br/>\nvery appreciative. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;map-highpass.jpg&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, here is the link to that webisite...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~hakata/eq/index2.html\">http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~hakata/eq/index2.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance...<br/>\n<br/>\nQinie, 8th circle Enchantress<br/>\nMithaniel Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
