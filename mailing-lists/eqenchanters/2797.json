My 1st Druid was a Halfling on Bertoxx. When I cast the 14th <br/>\nlevel charm animal spell (I was 17th) for the 1st time, I cast on a <br/>\nvery green puma to test it out. It lasted long enough for me to sit <br/>\ndown. I had base charisma at the time. Later, after getting a Crude <br/>\nStein, (2) +7 Cha bracelets, and the GOOD Halfling-only Raider cap <br/>\n(+10 Cha) I tried again at 19th level (Cha was 104 this time as I put <br/>\npoints into cha at creation) while in NK. I cast on a Griffawn (blue)<br/>\nand it lasted over 90 seconds. I did /pet as you were  and it <br/>\nwandered off. After the &quot;your charm spell has broken&quot; message, I went <br/>\nout again and cast on another fawn (even) and the same thing happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless there has been a hidden nerf Charisma does have an effect, in <br/>\nmy experience, or its effect on saves has diminishing returns the <br/>\nhigher it gets. Just like Int of 212 gives 12 extra points of mana, <br/>\none for each point over 200. Also keep in mind &quot;Magic Numbers&quot; like <br/>\n75, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200.  An Erudite Necro with no extra <br/>\npoints in Agi has an AC of 1, but if you put points in Agi and raise <br/>\nit to 75, that same neco will have an AC of 12 when you appear in <br/>\nNorrath the first time (no armor or buffs). I know as I tested this <br/>\nwhen I heard the rumors about it. What happens to an Agi over 200 I <br/>\nhave no idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love debates. Keep it going! Hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nArakine</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
