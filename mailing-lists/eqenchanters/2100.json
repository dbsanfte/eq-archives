You must put a point into <br/>\none to kick it off and you must have put a point into each of them to get <br/>\none past the 50 mark.<br/>\nResearch can be practiced fairly easily with just spare pages you pick up <br/>\nand the practice runes the gypsies instruct you in.<br/>\nOne thing I have not tried yet but keep planning on is to find out <br/>\nrecipe&#39;s for the other classes and try to research their spells.

Can you do this at<br/>\neach level?<br/>\nI realize you may not want to do this or advise it, but is it possible?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat reasons would you give for NOT putting your training points into <br/>\nJewel<br/>\nCraft at each level, even if you only put in 1 or 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, after you reach 16th, how hard is it to do research and advance it?<br/>\nShould I save points for Specialization?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBahir<br/>\n3rd Season DE Enchanter<br/>\nBertoxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
