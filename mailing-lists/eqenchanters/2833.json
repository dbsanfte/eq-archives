But for full <br/>\ncrowd control you must be scared and ready, and to mem that DD takes <br/>\naway from the crowd control.  Take a typical mem block<br/>\n<br/>\ngate, theft of thought, fasination, dazzle, color stun, charm, tash, <br/>\nroot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther often swapted out spells would be boon of clear mind, auggie, <br/>\nslow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try not to have buff memed for any longer than I need it.  I often <br/>\nselect the gem to mem it in based on the immediate risk in the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example,  I never un mem dazzle or ae mez.  But I might un mem <br/>\ncharm or gate for buffs if it seems relatively safe at the moment.  <br/>\nIf it is very unsafe i will unmem root perhaps if others have it.  I <br/>\nwill explain to group I am unmemming root.  I see root as an <br/>\nimportant crowd control spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy whole job, as I am beginning to see it, is Crowd Control.  If the <br/>\nothers don&#39;t have the damaging protential needed to do the job then I <br/>\nneed a new group.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, to load a evoc DD embraces an impatience I just dont think <br/>\nI can afford.<br/>\n<br/>\nLonger battles are the norm.  FM or higher mana than normal is the <br/>\nnorm.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when stuff goes bad.  Micro, Mini, or massive mistake or train.  <br/>\nI end up using tons of mana fast.  The benefit is no evac, or cr.  <br/>\nThose are my goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a whole new type of thinking to extremes needed for <br/>\neffective CC in places that are ultra filled with 45 plus baddies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch the same as our conversion at 35, I think at 51 and up there is <br/>\na new .. come to jesus .. LOL sorta speak... in terms of our <br/>\npriorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too have memd other spells for fun in battles.  I almost always <br/>\nregret it.  Stuff just goes wrong often in pulls.  It is the norm.  <br/>\nWhen I say norm I mean it will happen every hour or so that if not on <br/>\nyour toes the team will have someone die or need to evac or some <br/>\nother bad time consuming thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Jouleblu Diamond<br/>\n<br/>\n     52 Enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n          Knights of Loyalty<br/>\n<br/>\n               Cazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
