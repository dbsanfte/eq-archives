Go in from the ferrott,<br/>\ntake the first right just inside the zone. There&#39;s a plateau in the middle<br/>\nof the open area. One end of the plateau has an orc camp on it with 3 orcs,<br/>\nthe other hand has a paladin camp. Alliance the paladins, illusion human or<br/>\nhigh elf if you are a dark elf, enthrall one of the orcs (vital to enthrall<br/>\nthe cleric if there is one, because he will cast on your pet and pull the<br/>\npet), run the other two to the paladins who will kill them. Repeat if need<br/>\nbe. At 16, I could then keep the camp beat down, plus there&#39;s a gypsy vendor<br/>\nby the paladins for when you get loaded down. The orcs drop bronze weapons<br/>\nand rawhide armor. Good cash and experience till 17 or 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi ~Hand of Chaos~, CT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
