In the future would you please refrain from quoting the<br/>\nentire digest in your message?  Nothing worse than a digest to<br/>\ndigest feedback loop.  Well, okay, maybe a festering hag train is worse,<br/>\nbut only slightly )<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to contribute instead of just complain )<br/>\n<br/>\nMy enchanter is only 10th level, and I have not found it difficult to gain this<br/>\nlevel solo<br/>\nor with group assistance.  My tactics change drastically whether Im solo  or in<br/>\ngroup,<br/>\nof course.  Perhaps I will become severely disable when I hit the range of 14 -<br/>\n18th.<br/>\nBut, while some spells don&#39;t work the way I would like them to, I am still happy<br/>\noverall<br/>\nwith the class.  Not a knock on necro players, but I didn&#39;t want to play one,<br/>\nand if they are<br/>\n&quot;tougher&quot; than me, no big deal.  Being able to contribute in a group is another<br/>\nissue entirely.<br/>\nI can&#39;t always contribute directly against a deep red, but I can engage it first<br/>\nand contribute my<br/>\npet, and I can buff the party to some extent and keep wandering yellows from<br/>\nfouling the mix.<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty happy with my role as it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as an aside. I have grouped with a couple of 9th and 10th level wizards,<br/>\nand in all occasions,<br/>\nI habe ended confornations with more life and more mana than they have. Don&#39;t<br/>\nknow what this<br/>\nREALLY means in the end, but the mobs were always more willing to target me than<br/>\nthem if I stepped<br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFystro of Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
