Something HAS to be done<br/>\n&gt;about the farming that goes on.  Too many guilds and assholes sit around<br/>\n&gt;camping GREEN MOBs so that they can get yet another item to sell at<br/>\n&gt;exorbitant prices.  In my opinion, the new code is EXCELLENT and just what<br/>\n&gt;is needed.  Why do you have to get that 2nd item &quot;just in case?&quot;  Go get it<br/>\n&gt;again or buy it when you NEED it, not &quot;just in case.&quot;  There are too many<br/>\n&gt;campers for &quot;just in case&quot; scenarios.  I say that the new patch is exactly<br/>\n&gt;what is needed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Djar Lightbringer(Tarew Marr Server)<br/>\n&gt;Servant of Light, Deliverer of the Truth to Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-------------------<br/>\ntim borrelli<br/>\ncomputer character animator and crackhead extraordinaire<br/>\nVolition, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timmyland@...\">timmyland@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.timmyland.com\">http://www.timmyland.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
