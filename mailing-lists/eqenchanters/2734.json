South Karana is a<br/>\nhellhole filled with 12 year olds who forget they&#39;re playing a game for<br/>\nfun (but if you spent time in Lake Rathe, you&#39;re probably prepared for<br/>\nthat).  Rathe Mountains has a few spots that are good if you get a good<br/>\ngroup (but that&#39;s hard to find there) - specifically the giant skelly camp<br/>\njust south of the Feerott zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch better than these is Lake of Ill Omen, which has goblins for 20-26 or<br/>\nso and then Sarnaks for 24-30.  Also, I&#39;ve had better luck there finding<br/>\ngroups that know how to (or can be taught to) assist and work together<br/>\nthan I have in Cazic, S Karana, Unrest, or Mistmoore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get bored there, forest giants in Warsliks are L20-25 or so and can<br/>\nbe nice for a group around your level.  You&#39;re probably just past the<br/>\nperfect range for Kurn&#39;s Tower in Field of Bones, but you may still find<br/>\nsome decent XP there.<br/>\n--<br/>\nMark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
