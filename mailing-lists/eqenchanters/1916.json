I cannot belive that is possible that in qeynos dont exist seller of<br/>\ntinny dagers, it is so big city there must be one seller but maybe hard to<br/>\nfind i spent nearly a day searching but i dont find it. Please if you know<br/>\nwhere it is to share it with this list so that a enchanters dont have to<br/>\ntravel to other side of ocean or to freeport to get daggers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\nDilith  8 lv Enchanter, Soulsek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
