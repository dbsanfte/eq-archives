After 18, it&#39;s still good but not as good.<br/>\nTo get there, Take the boat to Freeport, go in East Commons, enter Nektulos<br/>\nforest ( follow the right wall to get there )and turn into a dark elf then<br/>\nfollow the path straight all the way to lavastorm. as you enter lavastorm,<br/>\nfollow the right edge and you&#39;ll soon find the entrance of the Najena<br/>\ndungeon. This is a great place to hunt. Xp is amazing on the lavas crawlers.<br/>\nLoot is also pretty good ( although not extraordinary ). Hunt in Lavastorm<br/>\nand zone in najena if there is any trouble.<br/>\nAlso, this place is full of darkies, ogres and trolls so if you like duels,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have a good time.<br/>\nNote: A magic weapon can help...try to buy or get a runed totem staff first.<br/>\nSkara de Toxxulia.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Andrea Maionchi [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:okandrea@...\">okandrea@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 03, 1999 11:29 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Finally 15 but where now?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHail Friends,<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally reached lvl 15! but I am at a loss now. I have traveled far, from<br/>\nErudin to Felwithe and currently hunt at the Sister camp in Lesser Faydark.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those that do not know, this is (well was until last patch) a great<br/>\nplace for loot and exp. I started hunting there at 12th and made my way to<br/>\n15th quickly and after buying all my spells I still have 150pp in the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell now this place is too easy for me and need a better place to reach 16th<br/>\npreferably with good loot. I would like to solo to 16th but in safety. I<br/>\nhear you say, don&#39;t we all!<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas where I could find such a place/camp?<br/>\n<br/>\nEregil - Erudite Enchanter.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
