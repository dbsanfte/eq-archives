Wear it on your face and broadcast every hour <br/>\na price of 220 to 250pp, It will sell eventually and make more than all of <br/>\nyour other jewelry sales combined.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe careful though and look at your connection before clicking that combine <br/>\nbutton.  The other day I clicked the button and was disconnected a <br/>\nmillisecond after.  When I logged back in I was out the components and alas, <br/>\nno veil.  I realize I may have failed and not seen the message but who knows. <br/>\nI had a 102 skill at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, don&#39;t get your metals mixed up.  If you are making lots of electrum <br/>\nmake darn sure you put a silver bar in your kit.  I accidentally put an <br/>\nelectrum bar in and somehow suceeded with my 102 skill.  Thank god I suceeded <br/>\nbecause if I had failed I might have done the same thing again!  That was 5 <br/>\ndays ago and I still haven&#39;t been able to sell the thing, I&#39;m wearing it <br/>\naround because it is a *Very* nice item, no matter what your class.  Anybody <br/>\nknow a fair price for these? I&#39;m askin 250pp but who knows it may be a little <br/>\nlow.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrbane<br/>\nFenin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
