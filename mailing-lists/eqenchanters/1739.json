With all of us having<br/>\nSoW and me having Memory Blur (MB) we didn&#39;t think we&#39;d have a problem, even<br/>\nthough we are all low-mid 20&#39;s. Well, we couldn&#39;t touch that hill giant with<br/>\nspells even after my tashani. The tank was hysterical and wouldn&#39;t run close<br/>\nenough for me to get off a MB to get the giant off him. In the end, everyone<br/>\nbut me zoned, so the hill giant comes straight for me. I start pushing the<br/>\nMB key... Target out of range!... Target out of range!... You begin to cast<br/>\na spell.... A hill giant blinks. The hill giant then changed direction and<br/>\nwent about his merry way. Cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that we know we can&#39;t take a hill giant, and bolstered by our experience<br/>\nwith the hill giant (noone died), we decided to try a griffon. This one<br/>\ndidn&#39;t go nearly as well. The griffon turned out to be just as magic<br/>\nresistant as the hill giant, and a LOT faster. After unsuccessfully trying<br/>\nour spells, the call went out for MB. The tank ran the griff near me and I<br/>\ncast MB. A griffon blinks. Problem was, it kept chasing the tank! The tank<br/>\ndidn&#39;t like that news so he kept running for the zone. I chased him a bit to<br/>\ntry and get another cast of MB off. I guess at that point I was closer to<br/>\nthe griffon than the tank because it turned for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou begin to cast a spell.<br/>\nA griffon claws you for 96 points of damage!<br/>\nA griffon claws you for 96 points of damage!<br/>\nA griffon kicks you for 34 points of damage!<br/>\nYou keep your concentration and finish the spell! (don&#39;t know how...)<br/>\nA griffin blinks.<br/>\nA griffon claws you for 78 points of damage!<br/>\nA griffon claws you for 89 points of damage!<br/>\nA griffon bashes you for 28 points of damage!<br/>\nYou are stunned!<br/>\nYou cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>\nYou cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>\nYou cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>\nYou cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>\nA griffin claws you  for 56 points of damage!<br/>\nA griffon kicks you for 32 points of damage!<br/>\nYou have been slain by a griffon!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question I have is, what is the correct way to use MB? Apparently, it<br/>\nwipes the hate list, but if you are in the critter&#39;s aggro radius the<br/>\ncritter will just jump you again. Anyone have any strategies to share in<br/>\nusing Memory Blur?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
