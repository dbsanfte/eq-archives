Since I fail repeatedly<br/>\nat making them, and I see no one auctioning these pages, at this rate I will<br/>\nbe level 30 before I have them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best luck for finding these was in Oasis on deepwater crocodiles. Easiest<br/>\noption would be to do a /auction for the pages you want in the zone. I<br/>\nusually offer 2pp for these. Lizards from the maze in Cazic Thule are also<br/>\ngood for these pages and the level 24 spell research pages (now if I can<br/>\njust find about 10 faded velishouls so I can make feedback, finding all<br/>\nkinds of necro research stuff off the level 31-33 goblin warriors in<br/>\nHighKeep, but few enchanter items).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; And looking ahead a bit as well, where should I go for the level 24<br/>\n </span></blockquote>research pages as well.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My poor (and I mean &#39;broke&#39;) level 21 enchantress has CHA and INT both<br/>\n </span></blockquote>just over 130.  I am working hard on jewelcraft to try to fill in my (bare)<br/>\near slots, and wrist slots in particular, but she currently sports damask or<br/>\nleather or cloth underwear. A second question I have is .. at what level can<br/>\nI successfully do Evil Eyes in the gorge (given the above stats, and with a<br/>\nmagic resist of 57).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 24, I was soloing (no pet either) EE&#39;s without a problem. Under that,<br/>\nyour damage output may not be sufficient. Due to the charming the EE&#39;s do, I<br/>\nwould recommend not using a pet on them. Had a stein in one hand and a Skull<br/>\nof Jhentra in the other (weapon, what&#39;s a weapon? really haven&#39;t used one<br/>\nafter level 22). Buff up with endure magic. Enthrall the pet, burn the EE<br/>\ninto the ground (WTYH is actully useful here), then mem blur the pet when<br/>\nthe eye is dead. Very important to tell anyone you are with not to touch the<br/>\npet (watching it slash itself for 32k always impresses people the first time<br/>\nthey see it). In the gorge, nearby critters will come and assist anything<br/>\nyou fight which is why the mino&#39;s jump in. The king room in the gorge (the<br/>\nroom with the big stone altar type thing and the 2 EE spawn spots) also has<br/>\nsome horrrible pathing issues. Putting up a pet there always attracted the<br/>\nwhole room on to me. It is one of those non pet friendly areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi Candiman, level 30, ~Hand of Chaos~, CT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
