I m ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-955560734\">I think for now I&#39;m going to stay in Guk, or Rathe Mtns.  Both zones are rarely<br/>\ncrowded, and the lower level mobs that I can kill are rarely camped.  I&#39;m<br/>\ngetting sick of the crowded zones.  Befallen is OK, but it seemed a bit crowded<br/>\nfor me.  My only experience with Najena was when I zoned in and ended up in a<br/>\nroom full of magicians and pets and promptly got killed and almost lost my<br/>\ncorpse for good.  I do want to go there in a few more levels though.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion about Soloing:  Now that I&#39;m 16 it&#39;s been very difficult for me to<br/>\nsolo, even with a pet.  My new level 16 spells use tons of mana, and I end up<br/>\neither running out before I kill the mob, or coming very close to it.  Either<br/>\nway I end up medding and healing for a long time between kills.  It hardly seems<br/>\nefficient.  Any suggestions on soloing at level 16?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ezrae<br/>\n16th level DE Enchantress<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew Collins wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Andrew Collins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ACollins@...\">ACollins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gossimer armor can be found in Unrest, rarely in Runnyeye, but 2 good spots<br/>\n&gt; to find gossimer are Befallen and Najena.
