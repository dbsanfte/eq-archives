Granted, the sole<br/>\n&gt; components used cost a fraction of what the sale price is, yet factoring in<br/>\n&gt; failures, training to get to that skill level, and your time to get it<br/>\n&gt; there I think it&#39;s more than fair! I usually bark back, well go work your<br/>\n&gt; jewelcraft skill up and make it yourself if you dont like my prices. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well it depends upon how these people phrase it, if they are nice about<br/>\nit (for instance if I am working an area and am selling at 5pp a piece<br/>\nand they are selling for significantly more, I will nicely inform them<br/>\nof what I am selling them for) I usually will adjust my prices for that<br/>\nzone. However if they start the conversation with your prices are a<br/>\nrip-off, that is one of the fastest ways to get yourself added to my<br/>\nignore list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The<br/>\n&gt; KEY is getting all jewelers on the same page and charging the same or close<br/>\n&gt; to the same prices. Until that happens, you&#39;ll have to deal with a much<br/>\n&gt; less margin to reinvest into your trade.<br/>\n&gt; Try getting with all the jewelers, and get them all on the same page, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; to only help you, them, and the trade of jewelcraft. It does work, you just<br/>\n&gt; have to keep after it and others to pass the word.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heh, this did work for smithing for a while (way back when I was a young<br/>\nenchantress and had just taken up the skill), until everyone and their<br/>\nbrother started smithing (mainly high level guilds funding someone and<br/>\nselling their wares at a bargain basement cost did it) we had a decent<br/>\nsystem going where even &quot;journeyman&quot; smiths could at least break<br/>\neven...  you see this in the higher level jewelry also ( who the hell<br/>\nwants to play an enchanter up to level 24 just to enchant gold?) where<br/>\nit is possible to more or less break even on all your sales, unless you<br/>\nhave a really poor run of luck.
