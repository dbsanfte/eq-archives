I was reading all the<br/>\n&gt;responses to Absor&#39;s post on Enchanters and some of the other classes and I<br/>\n&gt;think I am the only one who doesn&#39;t really care that some (ok, near all) <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;SoV mobs have such high MR and many , many are unmezzable.  So what its a<br/>\n&gt;few zones, there are so many other places to go you cant complain about a<br/>\n&gt;handful of zones that we cant mez in.  Granted I am only 54 but it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;really bother me.  I also got a kick out of how many people were bitching<br/>\n&gt;about wanting new Illusions.  Yeah, I think some of the reasons they give<br/>\n&gt;for not giving us new Illusions are pretty much crap and wish they would<br/>\n&gt;just be honest.  But I could really give a poo if we don&#39;t get anymore.  <br/>\n&gt;Not<br/>\n&gt;unless they don&#39;t have some sort of use to them (faction, stat +&#39;s that are<br/>\n&gt;worth the time/manna it takes to cast).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mu<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stallion02@...\">Stallion02@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stallion02@...\">Stallion02@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, January 30, 2001 5:46 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@yahoogroups.com\">eqenchanters@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] Message boards?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;if you want a noisy class talk to the rangers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
