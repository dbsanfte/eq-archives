I start a<br/>\nfight and take all the damage from Orcs only to have a mage blast the<br/>\norc with 2 spells that do 80 points damage each and kills it. He then<br/>\ngets the loot and exp. That&#39;s wrong.  It should be a combination of who<br/>\ntakes most of the damage and does the most damage.
