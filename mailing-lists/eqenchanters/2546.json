The basement doesn&#39;t have this problem.<br/>\nThe ghost room is good for level 29-35. The ghost himself is 35 I am pretty<br/>\nsure (had a hard time getting spells to stick at 31). In the area spawn<br/>\ngreater dark bones, barbed bones, skeletal monks , mortuary fungus,<br/>\nfestering hags, and tentacle and dark terrors (blue to yellow at 31). I lost<br/>\ntrack of the number of times enthrall, color flux/shift, and charm saved our<br/>\nlives here. Standing and waiting for enough mana to regen to cast color flux<br/>\nand stunning 4 things is not something I ever want to have to do again<br/>\n(someone did something really stupid). It&#39;s a great room to really show the<br/>\npower of an enchanter. My main charm targets were the hags (they are great<br/>\npets), though the yellow tentacle terror which I then convinced the group to<br/>\nlet solo a white one was the biggest pet I had there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi ~Hand of Chaos~, CT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
