Anybody measure <br/>\nwith a stopwatch ?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as far as I can tell, this line of spells is fixed duration, i.e, MOB<br/>\ndoes not get any saving throws to break early like the root line. True ?<br/>\n<br/>\nStun line : Color Flux 3 sec, Color Shift 7 sec, Color Skew 8 sec. Is the<br/>\nstun duration fixed ? In my experience, some MOBs seem to be more susceptible<br/>\nto staying stunned longer. Like lizards in CT seemed to stay stunned forever<br/>\nwith even flux.<br/>\n<br/>\nMohini,<br/>\nLvl 27 enchanter on Fenin Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
