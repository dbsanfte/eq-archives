I have both Illusion:Human and Illusion<br/>\nHalf-elf and have tested them out briefly.  I am a Dark Elf, so when I<br/>\nchanged to a human, I lost my Ultravision, making everything pitch black.<br/>\nAt least the Half-elves get infravision.  My questions are these:  If I<br/>\nchange to human, do I get the experience point bonus (or rather lose the XP<br/>\npenalty for being a non-human)?  I&#39;ve heard that the Illusion spells do not<br/>\nmask religious identity.  How safe would I be walking in Freeport with one<br/>\nof the illusion spells active?  Would I still be KOS?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen that Race war server opens up, Enchanters are going to be the assassins<br/>\nof Norrath.  Invisibility, charming someone and making them attack their own<br/>\nguards, Illusion spells to walk among the enemy unnoticed...<br/>\n<br/>\nKrye 5th Enchanter of Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWith more than 20 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n...ONElist is home to the liveliest discussions on the Internet!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
