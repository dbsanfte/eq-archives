After being","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1842549189\">On fighting in Lavastorm:<br/>\n<br/>\nBe very very careful if you are fighting near the entrance to Najena.  This has<br/>\nhappened to me and a friend of mine.  After being ambushed by 3 fire elementals<br/>\nwhile looting my corpse (I just got all my armor, but my bags were on my<br/>\ncorpse)  I ran to the zone to Najena because there was no way I was going to<br/>\nlive otherwise.  Instead of zoning into the hallway where you&#39;re supposed to end<br/>\nup, I ended up in a room full of Magicians and pets and was immediately killed.<br/>\nI had to petition to get my corpse (which took 2 hours).  The GM that helped me<br/>\nwas very nice and pulled my corpse out to safety for me.  When this happened to<br/>\na friend of mine the GM&#39;s weren&#39;t quite so nice.  They didn&#39;t believe that he<br/>\njust zoned in to avoid a monster they believed he was &quot;exploring&quot; in Najena (at<br/>\nlevel 12!).  It took him 2 hours of arguing with a GM before he got his corpse<br/>\nback.  Both GM&#39;s mentioned that this does happen occasionally at that zone edge<br/>\n(the second GM said my friend&#39;s corpse was on the wrong side of the room :(  ).<br/>\nI have no idea if or when they plan on fixing it. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nHas this happened to anyone else?<br/>\n<br/>\nEzrae<br/>\nStill level 14<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Jesernig wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Paul Jesernig&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwj@...\">pwj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Solo hunting? Lavastorm is ok, you can hunt near Najena and zone if you have<br/>\n&gt; a problem. Don&#39;t know how much gear you have, as you hit the harder things<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll need a magic weapon. Yard trash in Unrest is also very good at this<br/>\n&gt; level, there&#39;s about 6 spawn spots inside the maze just past the fountains<br/>\n&gt; where you will be off the tracks. I think the regular aviaks (not the<br/>\n&gt; guards) in front of the Arena in Lake Rathe should be ok, though they may be<br/>\n&gt; too low. There&#39;s also a lizard man camp in Rathe Mountains (one outrunner<br/>\n&gt; and 2 in camp). The Southern Ro dervish camps have an outrunner at each that<br/>\n&gt; you can go back and forth between or join a group doing one of the camps<br/>\n&gt; (the east one is preferable, there&#39;s a safe area near the grass where you<br/>\n&gt; can pull to and no ghouls or dry bones will wander through). The solo dervs<br/>\n&gt; may spawn a little tough on occasion, but you can kite those using fear.<br/>\n&gt; Might be able to do the orc camp in misty thicket, not sure exactly how high<br/>\n&gt; they are, but level 10-12 I think. If you can get  4 or 5 people together,<br/>\n&gt; the orc camps in Rathe Mountains are great experience and loot. There&#39;s all<br/>\n&gt; my good spots (good as in loot, experience, and rarely occupied).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lozi ~Hand of Chaos~ CT<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Sun, 19 Dec 1999 18:00:28 -0600<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Richard Slater&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:richie@...\">richie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Hunting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am level 12 and looking for some good hunting grounds, I think I&#39;m gunna<br/>\n&gt; &gt; try lavastorm today so I&#39;ll see how that goes.
