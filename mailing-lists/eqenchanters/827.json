After looking at the log, it appears that the pets<br/>\n&gt;had far fewer hp than normal. I understand that sometimes you just get a<br/>\n&gt;weak pet, but with so many consecutively? BTW, I had gotten killed in a<br/>\n&gt;Kerra spider snafu and had lost 12th level, so the pet I was using was the<br/>\n&gt;8th level one that I was very familiar with, and had been using to harvest<br/>\n&gt;wisps earlier.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Which brings me to my 2nd question. Does anyone know how the 12th level pet<br/>\n&gt;spell works? What I mean is, it doesn&#39;t appear to create a randomly strong<br/>\n&gt;pet like the 8th level spell does. The first 4 pets I cast conned green to<br/>\n&gt;me. The next few conned blue to me. I had heard that you could get a pet<br/>\n&gt;that cons white to you at 12th level, but I didn&#39;t see one last night. As a<br/>\n&gt;matter of fact, the level 8 pets that I had to use after losing my level<br/>\n&gt;seemed to do better than my level 12 pets. My conjuration is in the low<br/>\n&gt;50&#39;s, so it&#39;s not maxed, but it&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of.
