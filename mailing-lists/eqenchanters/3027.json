Post Kunark, it has mobs to<br/>\nbe pulled aplenty. My first stop was Supplier room (at 34) to get a light<br/>\nburlap sack. As a bonus, I got a guildy a TBB there. At 35, you can handle<br/>\nbreaking Sage/cav/exe/sav camp. 27 mobs every 29 minutes. Once you and your<br/>\ngroup get it together, after the first pull, it will all be single pulls.<br/>\nOutside Karnor&#39;s in Dreadlands is also great exp 35-45. A full group at 35<br/>\noutside Karnors can kill just about anything in the zone. Or go into the<br/>\nYeti caves on the north side of the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personnally will not go into Karnor&#39;s Castle, Sebilis, or Chardok without<br/>\na cleric in the group. Other places can be done 50+ for exp without a<br/>\ncleric, but not those. You can do Efreeti without a cleric 50+, the front<br/>\nspawns in the Hole are also good exp til 53 and do able without a cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nGear at 50 : This is what I had at 50, I did go with my guild to Hate at 48<br/>\nand started getting Insidious, not sure if that&#39;s an option for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHead: Runed cowl (Sage in Lower Guk) or Crown of King Tranix (Fire Giants,<br/>\nSol B)<br/>\nNeck: Sarnak Arcane Fetish (random drop somewhere in Chardok)<br/>\nEars: Ivanders Hoop and a gold sapphire earring (soon to be upgraded to<br/>\nearring from Necro epic quest)<br/>\nFace: Incandescent mask<br/>\nRobe: SMR (Arch-Magus, Lower Guk) and a Kedge (Phinny in Kedge Keep)<br/>\nArms: Insidious (Hate)/ Gator scale<br/>\nHands: Insidious (Hate)/ Incandescent<br/>\nLegs:  Insidious (Hate)/Drakehide<br/>\nRings: One electrum star ruby, one platinum star rose quartz<br/>\nWrists: Gold cat&#39;s eye bracers<br/>\nFeet: Gold efreeti boots (Sol B)<br/>\nBack: Mystic cloak (Quest)<br/>\nHand held items: 2 steins<br/>\nShoulders: Emboidered Black Cape (Lower Guk)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I wear the Crown, I swap out the wrists for int pieces.
