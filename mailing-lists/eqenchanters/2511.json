There are wandering NPC guards on the level above you, so using AE stun is risky.  I have been using it when absolutely necessary provided I have SoW up.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-323593775\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; &gt; at the very least hang around and make our lives difficult<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and at worst kill me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bummer.  Is it a matter of where you stand in the room, or do they wander<br/>\n&gt; enough that it&#39;s simply luck?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are wandering NPC guards on the level above you, so using AE stun is<br/>\nrisky.  I have been using it when absolutely necessary provided I have SoW<br/>\nup.  The gards only hit for 50-60, so if I have SoW I can zone without<br/>\ndying, and more importantly the guards do not agro on the rest of my group,<br/>\nonly me.  Last night I played without stun memmed and it was a major<br/>\ninconvenience.  Actually this same problem would probably present itself if<br/>\nI was fighting in the tower in Unrest...  Those mobs agro through the floor<br/>\nand ceiling very, very easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mez (and WTYH for that matter) has a 2.5 second cast time.  If you cast<br/>\n&gt; immediately after seeing the &quot;hits YOU&quot; message, you should be able to get<br/>\n&gt; it off at least half the time.  If there&#39;s only one.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is what I was doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Better yet, if you have a wizzie or cleric (or 30+ Paladin) in your group,<br/>\n&gt; warn them in advance that this will happen and they should keep a stunning<br/>\n&gt; spell memmed.  In combat, just /g &quot;please stun this unpleasant green<br/>\n&gt; thing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We had a cleric last night (for a change), but he was often LOM and medding<br/>\nfor heals.  BTW these things aren&#39;t green - they&#39;re high blue to red, with<br/>\nmost being red.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Root is another very good option, either from another caster that can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; stun, or cast it yourself, as it casts in 2.0 seconds rather than 2.5.<br/>\n&gt; Once rooted, step back and mez away (or step back and leave it rooted, for<br/>\n&gt; that matter).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Root&#39;s also a good idea.  It&#39;s not a spell that I memorize very often<br/>\nthough.  I tend to select mez/charm/stun type spells before a &quot;brute force&quot;<br/>\nroot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In fact, in the hands of a competent group without an enchanter, root is<br/>\n&gt; actually an effective small-crowd control method.  It doesn&#39;t touch what<br/>\n&gt; an enchanter can do, but with just a very small amount of maneuvering room<br/>\n&gt; it can take 2-3 MoBs out of the combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>BTW - my group last night sure loved me.  The paladin and monk were pulling<br/>\nthree red mobs at a time.  At first they were a hair&#39;s breadth away from<br/>\nzoning at all times, but as the evening progressed they go relatively<br/>\ncomfortable with pulling three reds..  I was able to mes the pretty easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nChiming</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
