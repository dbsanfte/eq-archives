I am going to<br/>\ncreate a gnome enchanter and I have a few questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12th level, how does Charisma effect the length of the Charm spell?<br/>\nIs this effected by Tashan at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom 8th to 11th how well does this strategy work out on evens/yellows?<br/>\n1) Tashan<br/>\n2) Color Flux (after pet engages)<br/>\n3) Root or Blind / Fear<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom 12th on how well does this strategy work out on evens/yellows?<br/>\n(Using highest level pet possible per level, fully buffed)<br/>\n1) Open with Tashan<br/>\n2) After Pet engages cast &quot;Whirl-Til&quot;<br/>\n3) Cast Choke (optional)<br/>\n4) Med til pet starts getting hit, cast &quot;Whirl&quot; again<br/>\n5) Repeat 4 til mob dies<br/>\nThis looks good on paper, but would it work in the game? Recast time on<br/>\n&quot;Whirl&quot; a factor here?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat good are the vials created via Thicken Mana? Are they stackable if you<br/>\nuse stackable vials? Can you use them in combat?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone figured out how to use the Gem Cutter? What benefit does this<br/>\nactually have on Jewel Crafting?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nArakine Uktena &lt;Shadows of the Fallen&gt;<br/>\nWoodelf Druid<br/>\n26th Limb on the Tree of Life<br/>\nFennin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
