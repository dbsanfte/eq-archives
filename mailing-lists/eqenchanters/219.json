So, if enchanter x is<br/>\ngrouped with or without a pet he takes the same amount of experience.<br/>\nWhy would it differ from when you solo?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are x points from a creature<br/>\nWhen you solo w/o a pet you take x points<br/>\nWhen you group w/o a pet you take (complicated formula based on level<br/>\nand maybe damage we&#39;ll call K for unknown) your K share of x points<br/>\nWhen you solo with a pet you take (x - pet points)<br/>\nWhen you group with a pet you take (your K share of x points - pet<br/>\npoints).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the thing that might affect this is if damage inflicted affects exp<br/>\nshare.  If this is true and your pet is dishing out the damage you and<br/>\nyour pet will split more points than if you were w/o a pet not hitting<br/>\nas often so doing less damage.  Also, it could be if the pet hits last<br/>\nhe is just doing even more damage which adds to your amount of damage<br/>\ninflicted.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, your pet counts as another party member in which case maybe you<br/>\nshould get your pet killed before finishing the monster?

If your grouped and your pet makes the kill, it takes the<br/>\nxp.  (serious pain)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i usually do is<br/>\n1.  Tashan - This pissed off the bad guy and gets him running after me.<br/>\n2.  Sit til he takes ne swing at me, then back off and let my pet take<br/>\nit.<br/>\n3.  Choke or other DOT spell.  Its important to cast these early, as<br/>\nthey take time to work to their best advantage.<br/>\n4.  If its a tough mob, a languid pace, and or enfeeble<br/>\n5.  Now I tend to melee the monster a bit to keep my pet alive.  Since<br/>\nit has a languid pace on it, its not going to hit me often. I try and<br/>\nkeep a balance between using mana and health.  More mana of course as<br/>\nits much easier to recover.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinishing strategies<br/>\n1.  Second choke.  Its usually fatal after a few seconds<br/>\n2.  Chaotic feedback.  i tend to avaoid this due to its poor mana/damage<br/>\nratio<br/>\n3.  Fear.  This is deadly in conjunction with a pet.  basically the<br/>\nmonster runs and the pet beats on it.  The risk is you need to know the<br/>\nrunning patterns of the monster, it running through a camp will get you<br/>\nkilled.<br/>\n4.  whirl. I generally save this for tough battles with harder hitting<br/>\nstuff.  Very effective when followed by a choke<br/>\n<br/>\nOther tips.<br/>\n<br/>\nStand well back when you cast, as it really ups how much the monster<br/>\nhates you. (Choke causes much less hate than the less powerful chaotic<br/>\nfeedback for some reason)<br/>\n<br/>\nKnow where the zone is at all times.  Its always possible for another<br/>\nmonster to jump in, and the best defence there is knowing where to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nMesmerization - use this if two mosters jump you.  Then hit the other<br/>\nmonster hard with the damage spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoothe - learn how to use this effectively on camps.  It takes practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Brian Rittermann [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bpr@...\">bpr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 21, 1999 3:38 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Re: Solo Fighting Strategies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brian Rittermann&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bpr@...\">bpr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStrategies when fighting solo, eh?<br/>\n1. I cast my highest lvl pet (i am a 13th Gnome Enchanter, so I summon<br/>\nthe<br/>\n12th lvl pet, Kali&#39;s (sp?))<br/>\n2. Cast Lesser shielding on myself, and Mist (or Haze) and Strength on<br/>\nme<br/>\nand my pet.<br/>\n3. Meditate to full mana/hp<br/>\n4. Attack:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe spells I like to have memorized at lvl 13 are:<br/>\nLesser Shielding<br/>\nStrength<br/>\nMist<br/>\nSuffocating Sphere<br/>\nChaotic Feedback<br/>\nWhirl till ya Hurl  (necessary.  definitely)<br/>\nLull<br/>\nGate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter you buff yourself you can dememorize the buffs and memorize things<br/>\nthat can help you escape or debuffs, like Mesmerize, Fear, Eye of<br/>\nConfusion,<br/>\nColor Flux, Enfeeblement, etc.... here it is really a preference.  I<br/>\nprefer<br/>\nEye of Confusion, Mesmerize, and Enfeeblement.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen attacking, I cast Enfeeblement, then back off and let my pet hit it<br/>\nfor<br/>\na little, then cast Suffocating Sphere and Whirl in succession.  If the<br/>\nWhirl was successful, cast Chaotic until dead unless yer pet is roughing<br/>\nit<br/>\nup, then save the mana and watch the pet deal damage.  Try to get a<br/>\nchaotic<br/>\nto finish it so yer pet doesn&#39;t steal exp from the kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the creatures proves too strong, and resists many spells or is<br/>\ncrushing<br/>\nyour pet, back off and you have several options. Try casting Eye of<br/>\nConfusion and run, cast Fear and run, whirl and run, get a good head<br/>\nstart<br/>\nand run for the guards, or you can gate, depending on where you are<br/>\nbound.<br/>\nIf you are close to a zone point or guard, by all means run there.  Most<br/>\ncreatures will not be able to overtake you if you have a lead and jump<br/>\nevery<br/>\n5 or 10 seconds to keep your lead. (dont run out of stamina though!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRinse and repeat steps 3 and 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoreweaver of the Eldritch Collective.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  If you do group, get someone with a reliable ISP if at all possible<br/>\n;).<br/>\nI grouped with two rangers yesterday and we were attacking cutthroats.<br/>\nOur<br/>\nthree person party could take on two or three cutthroats at once and<br/>\nstill<br/>\nlive (we did it earlier in the day) but as I was casting to lure one of<br/>\nthem, one of the rangers went linkdead, and another cutthroat spawned.<br/>\nThe<br/>\ntwo cutthroats made short work of us, as the remaining ranger could only<br/>\nhandle one at a time.  The Thug that zoned in was white/black to me, and<br/>\nkilled my pet quickly and then hit me, bashed me, stunning me, and<br/>\nkilled me<br/>\nin about 7 hits.  (When the linkdead ranger rejoined, he said his ISP<br/>\nhad<br/>\ndisconnected him. It happened again later that night.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Miko, Jeff &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JMiko@...\">JMiko@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, April 21, 1999 4:21 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Solo Fighting Strategies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Miko, Jeff&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JMiko@...\">JMiko@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was curious what strategies everyone is using when fighting solo?
