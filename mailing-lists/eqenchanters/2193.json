I much prefer bandits.<br/>\nSmugglers in the Qeynos Sewers are tailor made for Enchanters.  Loot&#39;s not<br/>\ngreat though.  If you get a party, hit the shark pit right next door.<br/>\nGreater Skellies on the undead island (OOT) are fantastic experience and worth<br/>\n1-5gp per shot.  I have not encountered one that wasn&#39;t level 13, and I&#39;ve<br/>\nkilled about 20 of them so far.  Your Exp bar will visiblely move each kill.<br/>\nI heard Aqua Gobs in OOT are good loot as well.<br/>\nIf you have a magic weapon, try Lavastorm in a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo many places to hunt, so little time.  Hope this helps.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
