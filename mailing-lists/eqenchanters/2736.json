No one had heard of the SMR yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow  lets talk the merits of the Tham robe...<br/>\n<br/>\nYour senior robe is AC6... ( +2 mana, that&#39;s useful )<br/>\nthe Tham robe is AC5 +3 agility   <br/>\n<br/>\nNow  unless you still live in some dream world thinking that Agility has<br/>\nsome mystical function in the game; even when everyone, including Brad<br/>\nMcQuiad, the producer of the game says it does not; you must know that<br/>\nagility really only affects your AC.  For Erudites, Humans, and other lower<br/>\nagility races, at the levels that you would wear the tham robe, it takes 4<br/>\nagility to raise your ac ONE point.  3 agility does not raise it one whit.<br/>\nIf you are Dark elf or other higher agility race ( i.e. more than 75 )  it<br/>\ntake 6 or 7 points of Agility to raise your AC ONE point.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow keep in mind, agility affects your total AC, not the AC on the item, and<br/>\nthat agility HAS NO OTHER FUNCTION IN EQ OTHER THAN RAISING YOUR AC.  (( For<br/>\nanyone piping up that Agility affects your channeling, get a gun and shoot<br/>\nyourself, you are hopeless ))<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, here is the real kicker... based on your LEVEL ( nope, still not your<br/>\nagility, but keep that dream alive ), items add more AC than they list in<br/>\ntheir description.  An ac 6 item adds 8-9 to your real AC number.... a AC5<br/>\nitem adds like 6-7.  ( I do not care what real number it really is, like I<br/>\nsaid, it is level based, not a linear formula, and all results will vary<br/>\nanyway)  To add to your misery, just like the Agility calc, it throws away<br/>\nfractions, so 8.999 is 8 and 9.001 is 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow  for the most important reason to NOT wear the tham robe... IT IS CRUD<br/>\nBROWN.  <br/>\nIf you cannot get a pure white Gossamer robe, the pinnacle of fashion, get a<br/>\ngreen senior, red senior, Blue senior, or even a Purple Senior from the<br/>\nnecros in FP.  Just do not wear those gay ass yellow or violet senior robe.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow   if you want to continue this conversation, please direct it to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moghedan@...\">moghedan@...</a>, and not this list.  I will be happy to tell you all<br/>\nthe ways you are wrong in private.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoghedan Carns<br/>\nEnchanter Adept of Freeport<br/>\nBrell Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
