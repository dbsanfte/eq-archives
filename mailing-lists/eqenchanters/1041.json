Plus<br/>\nI chose Quellious instead of agnostic.  I didn&#39;t know about that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m level 9 now and it took a while and a bunch of effort to get there and<br/>\nI&#39;m finally realizing my mistake.  I&#39;m sure if I had to do it again I could<br/>\ndo it quicker though.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst question: Would it be possible to have two characters on the same<br/>\naccount with the same name or would you have to delete one first?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond question: Does not having a really high chr hurt your character alot<br/>\nin the long run?  If I would do it again, I would put starting points into<br/>\nint, chr and sta.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo bad you can&#39;t transfer spell books :(<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just wondering what the recommendation is.  I plan on having a full and<br/>\nfruitful life for my enchanter and wondering if starting over now while I&#39;m<br/>\nonly lv9 is better than going on to much greater levels with a &#39;screwed up<br/>\ncharacter&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance to all the wise enchanters out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAzboklin the enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nScott Murawski                              <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott.murawski@...\">scott.murawski@...</a><br/>\nApplications Speech Engineer                          (voice) 212-425-7600 <br/>\nSpeechWorks Intl, Inc.
