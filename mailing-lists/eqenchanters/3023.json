If you&#39;re looking for pick-up groups, it&#39;s prime.  Sol B is also really<br/>\ngood, at least on E&#39;Ci.

Also, Kedge is very nice, if you don&#39;t mind a completely<br/>\ndifferent fighting environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was about 40 when I first started in Karnor&#39;s, but it was a bit rough.  Probably<br/>\nwant to be about 45 or so for Karnor&#39;s.  Chardok is a really cool dungeon around 48+.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know much about Vellious, in truth.
