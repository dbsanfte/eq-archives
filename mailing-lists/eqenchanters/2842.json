I no \nlonger cast, pets I charm, either for soloing or for crowd control. Once I had a \ngroup that pulled 5 hill giants from the fort in Frontier Mountains, I charmed \n(actually beguiled)&nbsp;one and sent it after another and feared two&nbsp;then \nblasted the other to death (thank god for rune shields), I was proclaimed a hero \nfor saving their butts. we and my pet picked the other two off, by the end my \npet was almost dead when charm broke and he was killed quickly. By the way hill \ngiants at fort are immune to mez that&#39;s why I started to&nbsp;charm and fear and \nfound that combo actually seems to work better than mez in some situations. Oh \nwell, every person has there way of playing and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll work out yours. \nI once was in a group where my only purpose was to cast clarity, easiest exp I \never made *lol* =)</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote dir=\"ltr\"\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"vtemplarv@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vtemplarv@...\">(Zhian)</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"eqenchanters@egroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">&#39;(EQ Enchanters)&#39;</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Monday, September 11, 2000 8:25 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [eqenchanters] Advice \n  needed</div>\n  <div><br></div><br>\n  <p><tt>Hello all.<br><br>I just hit 12th and am now overwhelmed by my spell \n  options.
