In other words, I<br/>\ntrained a point in each and played the way I normally play. If my<br/>\nspecialization:Evocation had made it first, then obviously it was the one<br/>\nthat was used most often, and should be the one that got the benefits of<br/>\nspecialization. As luck would have it, my playstyle emphasized Alteration,<br/>\nso that&#39;s what my specialty is in. That actually surprised me, given the<br/>\nfact that the Mesmerize line of spells is Conjuration, and I use those very<br/>\nheavily. Anyway, I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that specializing in<br/>\nAlteration might be a good idea for Enchanters, but it may not be for ALL<br/>\nEnchanters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2cp...<br/>\n<br/>\nQinie Isil&#39;Goren<br/>\n27 Enchanter<br/>\nMith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tPaul Jesernig [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwj@...\">pwj@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, December 15, 1999 1:18 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqenchanters] Specialization<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Paul Jesernig&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwj@...\">pwj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not just that most of our spells are alterations that you want to<br/>\n&gt; make<br/>\n&gt; this your primary specialization. The spells you will be tossing in combat<br/>\n&gt; will be mainly alterations. That is why alteration should be the primary<br/>\n&gt; specialization. My method for specialization has been to put one point<br/>\n&gt; into<br/>\n&gt; alteration specialization, wait till it hits 49 or 50 (took most of the<br/>\n&gt; way<br/>\n&gt; to 21 or even just past), then go back to the nearest guild and put one<br/>\n&gt; point in all the others and one more in alteration. I don&#39;t have an hour<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; two to sit around and do nothing in the game, so this worked good for me.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; also noticed that the lower level alteration spells almost never raised<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; skill whereas with the higher level spells it seemed to go up more often.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lozi ~Hand of Chaos~ CT<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What they said.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Definitely put a point into each Specialize skill (one for each spell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill) and then make sure you stop casting any spells other then the one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you want to eventually Master at about skill 40.  The reason is that you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want them all and that you cant get one above 50 until you have at least<br/>\n&gt; &gt; put a point into each of them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I also recommend Alteration. At the present time Baelsih at Castersrealm<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is the only one who has a good page for viewing spells by skill type.<br/>\n&gt; So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; look at your spell list or hit his site and then view by the different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; categories to see what spells you like and the skill they fit in.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You will find that most of our spells are Alteration.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since Specialization will reduce mana cost if it works it should be for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells you will cast often and when your mana may run out.  For example<br/>\n&gt; &gt; combat spells or enchantments.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Stonedreamer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
