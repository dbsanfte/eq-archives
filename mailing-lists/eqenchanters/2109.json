Chaotic Feedback has<br/>\na long recovery time, has a poor Mana/Damage ratio, and will fizzle like<br/>\ncrazy early on.<br/>\nAt 8th level the skill will max at 45. If you haven&#39;t spent training points<br/>\nin it each level, it will be a very time consuming action of getting this<br/>\nskill to where you don&#39;t fizzle just thinking about casting it. Does anyone<br/>\nhave a quick solution to raise this skill quickly besides standing around<br/>\ncasting it on yourself? At level 8 I will have 30 training points to spend<br/>\nas I have 10 left still. If I max my Jewelcraft at 21 and pump the remaining<br/>\n9 into Evocation I will still suck but it will not take me nearly as long as<br/>\nif I started with a &quot;0&quot;. Yes, I made the mistake of priming it with 1 point<br/>\nwithin my first 2 levels before I saw when we get the first Evocation spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent 15 minutes last night incresing my Divination from 1 to 23 while<br/>\ncasting Sense Magic (mana drain of 5). I also spent time increasing<br/>\nAbjuration from 3 to 18 last night with Minor Shielding. Recovery time was<br/>\nok, but the thought of this for evocation gives me a headache. It could take<br/>\nyour entire night of self-casting to get this maxxed. This assumes you<br/>\nintend on not wanting to die in combat after 9 fizzles in a row and becoming<br/>\nOOM while a Green MoB kicks the crud out of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I crazy, or should we have a low level Evocation spell? Even if it does<br/>\nnothing like Sense Magic, I would spend the $ to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have thoughts on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBahir<br/>\n4th Season DE Enchanter<br/>\nBertoxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
