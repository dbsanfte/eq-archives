I usually get to call evacs, and I don&#39;t go unless there<br/>\nis NO way, and there very rarely is no way), I don&#39;t see how an enchanter could<br/>\nNOT be hit a lot... for me, my goal is to keep everything that&#39;s not being hit<br/>\nby the main tank out of the fight, and NOT hitting the healers... leaving the<br/>\nhealers free to heal at need.  Mostly, this involves mezzing them, but there<br/>\nwill be resists, so if that involves making them all mad at just me and beating<br/>\non me, fine.  Perfect... the madder they are at me, the less chance they&#39;ll<br/>\nrun at the healer when he casts, and the more clumped they are.  At lvl 53,<br/>\nI can cast with 3 to 8 things beating on me, if I don&#39;t panic.  And the clerics<br/>\nI usually work with are pretty good, they&#39;ll help me out with a stun on the<br/>\nones hitting me.  But, that&#39;s just me.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;On another topic has anyone else tried using AE stuns and AE spells to kill<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;large pulls instead of mezzing?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep... do this in Charasis a lot.  Though it works better with 2 enchanters,<br/>\nmaybe 3 if you have them, and at least 2 wizards, more if you can.  In Charasis,<br/>\nI think our biggest pull was 18 or so at once... most were lvl 48+ mobs, about<br/>\na quarter were 51+.  A lot of them harm touched, but we used a paladin with<br/>\ninvuln to do that particular pull.  :)  It&#39;s great, just watching the yellow<br/>\ntext fly by.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, on pulls like that, the enchanters will usually what&#39;s hit if anything<br/>\nis.. and once you lose one enchanter, things start slipping... you lose the<br/>\nother, might as well evac or be sure your will is signed, and start sending<br/>\ntells to a necromancer with summon corpse.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say, though, I have found that, even though you see a TON of yellow xp<br/>\nmessages, it still seems to go faster with a group of 6 going through normally<br/>\n(not sitting in one spot, but moving through).<br/>\n<br/>\nJM - Saidan/Eltanin/Aipex Soulblade<br/>\nMith Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
