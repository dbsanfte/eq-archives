Here is what the<br/>\nGM told me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince your pet is only defensive, he doesn&#39;t take any xp from you if you solo<br/>\nor are in a group.  I was wondering why I was getting tons of xp when fighting<br/>\ncreatures that conned yellow to me so I asked.  Can someone please try to<br/>\nconfirm this as well.  Just ask a GM.<br/>\n<br/>\n2nd, also according to the GM&#39;s that I spoke to... buffing your pet is a waste<br/>\nof mana.  I use to buff my pet all the time but really didn&#39;t see any<br/>\nimprovement.  Again, I hope someone can confirm this since my information is<br/>\nbased off of my perceptions and what the GM&#39;s tell me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarisma,<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShawn Alley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ShawnA@...\">ShawnA@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nFrom: Shawn Alley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ShawnA@...\">ShawnA@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI read on stratics or vault (hehe, I know it&#39;s not the gospel now) that<br/>\npets take exp from the master not from the group.  So, if enchanter x is<br/>\ngrouped with or without a pet he takes the same amount of experience.<br/>\nWhy would it differ from when you solo?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are x points from a creature<br/>\nWhen you solo w/o a pet you take x points<br/>\nWhen you group w/o a pet you take (complicated formula based on level<br/>\nand maybe damage we&#39;ll call K for unknown) your K share of x points<br/>\nWhen you solo with a pet you take (x - pet points)<br/>\nWhen you group with a pet you take (your K share of x points - pet<br/>\npoints).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the thing that might affect this is if damage inflicted affects exp<br/>\nshare.  If this is true and your pet is dishing out the damage you and<br/>\nyour pet will split more points than if you were w/o a pet not hitting<br/>\nas often so doing less damage.  Also, it could be if the pet hits last<br/>\nhe is just doing even more damage which adds to your amount of damage<br/>\ninflicted.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, your pet counts as another party member in which case maybe you<br/>\nshould get your pet killed before finishing the monster?  Too many<br/>\nunknowns...<br/>\n<br/>\nShawn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
