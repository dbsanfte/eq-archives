What have you all tested?<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t be willing to loose the extremely useful pet series of spells<br/>\nuntil I can figure out how to make up for the loss of the &quot;baby tank&quot; in<br/>\ncombat. To me it is what makes soloing bearable. Lets face it, while I would<br/>\nprefer to be in a group, there are times where it is either solo or don&#39;t<br/>\nplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nTharkun / Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: refplace [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:refplace@...\">refplace@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 21, 1999 11:37 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] about the new enchant items (long rant)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;refplace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:refplace@...\">refplace@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: XIII &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dlepriol@...\">dlepriol@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Party pooper, party pooper. Ok you know the song, this time I fill the role<br/>\n&gt;:).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; May I point out that the message said that the code was going to be<br/>\n&gt;implemented, not that -we- enchanters are going to benefit from it. True,<br/>\n&gt;it was stated in the book we could do it, but at no time in B4 it was in<br/>\n&gt;effect, and, according to EQE, we received other benefits to make up for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; As I see it, such thing would overbalance us (enchanters) in regard of<br/>\n&gt;other pure spell user classes. So either the benefit will be too small to<br/>\n&gt;even consider it or too huge and Verant might take out something in return<br/>\n&gt;to balance our classe again. Don&#39;t tell me we&#39;re nerfed now. We were, true,<br/>\n&gt;but that was sometime ago and from my point of view we are rather balanced<br/>\n&gt;regarding other pure spell users. To sum up we have our &quot;niche&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, the idea is: By talking here, and offering Verant options to consider<br/>\n&gt;we may have a say in the matter and make our class fuller in the way -we-<br/>\n&gt;see it. What I would like to see discussed here is : What can we give up to<br/>\n&gt;have a &#39;proper&#39; enchantment line of spells?. Or are we just to receive this<br/>\n&gt;new ability/spell/line of spells without giving up anything?.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As stated above, I dont think we can&#39;t expect a &#39;useful&#39; line of<br/>\n&gt;enchantment&#39;s spells unless we give up something in exchange. Thinking back<br/>\n&gt;of Beta, there was a line of spells we didn&#39;t have but nonetheless still<br/>\n&gt;managed to survive and prosper : Pet line of spells. Plus they don&#39;t fit<br/>\n&gt;enchanters very well . On the other hand, this line form the very core of<br/>\n&gt;most of our solo strategies so losing it wouldn&#39;t be a small thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is just an example, a topic&#39;s starter. Feel free to agree, disagree<br/>\n&gt;or tell me to shut up. Once again my aim to to talk things out here first<br/>\n&gt;and offer something (petition/ EQE/ you name it) constructive to Verant<br/>\n&gt;before we see something not implemented or half implemented in place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Best,<br/>\n&gt;Ibnabeth / Karana<br/>\n&gt;still going up<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would be hapy to lose our pets.<br/>\nI went up to 9th level before seriously using a pet.<br/>\nGive us spells so we are wanted in a group even at low levels so that we can<br/>\nalways find a group and I&#39;ll happily give up my pet for good.  Even take<br/>\ncharm if ya like.<br/>\nHowever Enchantments I see as a form of trade skill and people will want you<br/>\nto create tehm for them at little or no cost but tehn when it comes to<br/>\npartying ask waht you can do in a fight.<br/>\nThat are give you a pity spot in the party to keep those temp enchantments<br/>\ncoming.  I dont see Enchantments having such a huge effect on our class no<br/>\nmatter what form they take.<br/>\nStonedreamer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations to RON MARTINO<br/>\nThis week&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY WINNER!<br/>\nTo join ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family program, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
