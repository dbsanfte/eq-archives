Chaotic Feedback<br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; a long recovery time, has a poor Mana/Damage ratio, and will fizzle like<br/>\n&gt; crazy early on.<br/>\n&gt; At 8th level the skill will max at 45. If you haven&#39;t spent training<br/>\npoints<br/>\n&gt; in it each level, it will be a very time consuming action of getting this<br/>\n&gt; skill to where you don&#39;t fizzle just thinking about casting it. Does<br/>\nanyone<br/>\n&gt; have a quick solution to raise this skill quickly besides standing around<br/>\n&gt; casting it on yourself? At level 8 I will have 30 training points to spend<br/>\n&gt; as I have 10 left still. If I max my Jewelcraft at 21 and pump the<br/>\nremaining<br/>\n&gt; 9 into Evocation I will still suck but it will not take me nearly as long<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; if I started with a &quot;0&quot;. Yes, I made the mistake of priming it with 1<br/>\npoint<br/>\n&gt; within my first 2 levels before I saw when we get the first Evocation<br/>\nspell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I spent 15 minutes last night incresing my Divination from 1 to 23 while<br/>\n&gt; casting Sense Magic (mana drain of 5). I also spent time increasing<br/>\n&gt; Abjuration from 3 to 18 last night with Minor Shielding. Recovery time was<br/>\n&gt; ok, but the thought of this for evocation gives me a headache. It could<br/>\ntake<br/>\n&gt; your entire night of self-casting to get this maxxed. This assumes you<br/>\n&gt; intend on not wanting to die in combat after 9 fizzles in a row and<br/>\nbecoming<br/>\n&gt; OOM while a Green MoB kicks the crud out of you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Am I crazy, or should we have a low level Evocation spell? Even if it does<br/>\n&gt; nothing like Sense Magic, I would spend the $ to get it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone else have thoughts on this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Bahir<br/>\n&gt; 4th Season DE Enchanter<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxx<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
