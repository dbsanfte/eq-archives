I finally made 8th level, and so off I go to get my pet<br/>\nspell.  I had read many reports on this list, so I thought myself prepared.<br/>\nAfter about an hour and a half trip from Felwithe, I finally reach High Hold<br/>\nPass.  My invisibility still going strong, I procede in a short distance<br/>\nonly to be rooted and killed by some #@!!@#$ orc who could see invisible.  I<br/>\ncame from Kithicor forest.  Was I just unlucky?  Is there another better way<br/>\nin, other than through kithicor?  That place is insane.  How do they expect<br/>\nus to ever get a pet at this level?  I&#39;ve been hearing Mages whine about<br/>\nhave to research 24th level pets.  How about getting screwed out of 8th<br/>\nlevel.  If my bitching is unfounded, please tell me.  I will appologize.  If<br/>\nthere is an easier way, or I just got unlucky, let me know.
