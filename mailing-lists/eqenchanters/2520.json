Not only do you have a better chance of regaining your<br/>\nconcentration and getting mes off, but you are also saving your cleric a<br/>\nlittle mana on the heals for your *crunchy* self. At level 50 Rune III is<br/>\nalways up, as soon as its off, right back up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso don&#39;t forget the power of tepid deeds. If you slow the monsters while<br/>\nthey are mesd, if someone accidentally breaks mes, or if they come out<br/>\nbefore you have a chance to recast, you have plenty of time to cast between<br/>\ntheir hits. <br/>\nHeh, tanks in Gukbottom used to think I cast it so they wouldnt get hit as<br/>\nmuch (which I did), but more importantly, so i could cast between swings<br/>\nfairly easily. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaelael, 50th Enchanter, Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
