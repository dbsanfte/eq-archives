(again) When I <br>created Galadriana, I \n  was pretty much clueless about what religion I should <br>pick and so forth. I \n  for some reason chose Rodcet Nife, well what a mistake <br>THAT was. I cast \n  illusion drybone on myself.. but the spec&#39;s killed me <br>because of my god.. \n  next time I casted improved invis on myself and got thru <br>everything \n  &nbsp;including the spec&#39;s BUT &nbsp;as soon as I cast collaboration on \n  <br>reania the other guild masters instantly killed me, because of my \n  religion. <br>&nbsp;I am currently working on the crate quest in qeynos to up \n  my faction with <br>opaldarkbriar, and I&#39;ve smacked old Neclo Rheslar in west \n  karana several <br>times too. (opal is the necro guildmaster under freeport) . \n  Does anyone have <br>any tips or hints or any suggestions as to what I can do \n  that could help me <br>start this part of my epic so i dont get killed every \n  single time?? <br><br>thanks, <br>Galadriana Dimystic <br>level 52 \n  enchantress</font> <br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
