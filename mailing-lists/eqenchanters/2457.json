There are alot of<br/>\ngriffawns, griffeenes, and a few griffons not to mention Hill Giants.<br/>\nHowever, if you fight near the guard tower near the gypsies the guards can<br/>\nhelp you out.  I died twice in a few levels, once to a second wisp that<br/>\nsnuck up on me when killing the first wisp and once by a hill giant that I<br/>\nwas watching fight two guards.  I was drawn to attack it because it only had<br/>\nthe teeniest sliver of life left after workin the guards but of course I was<br/>\nstupid and took 2 hits and died without landing a single point of damage.<br/>\nToo bad I didn&#39;t remember my damage shield heh.  Anyway, if you don&#39;t mind<br/>\nkilling bears and wolves there are LOTS of them in NK too.  Not too many<br/>\npeople, high level people who can occassionly help you, and places to sell<br/>\nnearby for non evil people I believe.  Wolves and bears would probably be<br/>\nbetter around 12 and pincer beetles as you hit 13 or 14.  Be careful of<br/>\nborer and scythe beetle which will help the pincers if you get to close.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Doctor Zero [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drzero@...\">drzero@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, March 12, 2000 6:25 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqenchanters] Digest Number 248<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Doctor Zero &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drzero@...\">drzero@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI found North Ro to be great from 12-14 where I am now.
