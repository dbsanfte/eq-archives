One was Inset.  This was a<br/>\ncross bewteen jewelcraft and black smithing as it allowed you to inset<br/>\na stone in to a weapon to imbue the weapon with the magical properties<br/>\nof the stone.  The other was simply Enchant Weapon, which was a level<br/>\ndependent damage enhancer.  As I recall the goal was to win a quest so<br/>\nan immortal would enchant your (non-magical only) weapon and then you<br/>\ncould inset the Purple Shard from the Purple Snorklewacker.  Now that<br/>\nwas fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way Lottie, is there any chance you do configuration management<br/>\nfor a large tech company in the Southwest?<br/>\n<br/>\nQuentin<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Bryan M.
