One sad evening, coming back from<br/>\na<br/>\nvery long quest that brought me to Kerra Island and South Karana, I got<br/>\nhacked multiple times in Riverdale losing about 4 bubs of xp because my<br/>\ninvis wore off on me randomly. I got really pissed off that at level 16,<br/>\nI<br/>\ncould not manage to cast a level 8 spell reliably and decided to start<br/>\nanother character more appropriate for travelling since I was very much<br/>\ninto<br/>\nresearch and quests.<br/>\nWith my enchantress, I got invisibility at level 4 and used it some<br/>\ntimes.<br/>\nIt always seemed to work great but I might be wrong. Yesterday, I found<br/>\nout<br/>\nthat this invisibility spell is as bad as gather shadows as a %$#%^^%$<br/>\ngriffin nuked me a few seconds after I cast invisibility. Since then,<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\nnoticed the same kind on unreliability...but only since I made level<br/>\n8...I<br/>\nmight be wrong.<br/>\nAnyway, I would like to know how&#39;s the enchanter&#39;s invisibility like at<br/>\nlevel 16 or 20 or more. CAN YOU COUNT ON IT?<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSkara, the pissed-off dark-elf Necro from Fennin-Ro<br/>\nnow known as Skara, the enchantress from Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nYou can now easily share photos and documents with your fellow list<br/>\nmembers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nCheck out our homepage for details on how to use our new shared files<br/>\nfeature!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
