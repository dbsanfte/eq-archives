The nicest person","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-296347113\">Why not Baels? I have gotten about 5 steins for other people, and I admit,<br/>\nI feel kinda bad about it, but I have made decent money doing it. The<br/>\nnicest person I helped complete the quest gave me 120 platinum and 6<br/>\nresearch-only spells for bringing him merely an ingredient. This was an<br/>\nEnchanter that couldnt get a Koalindl fish from Qeynos because his faction<br/>\nwith the Priests of Life was already KOS. Now that I know what others are<br/>\ncharging, I will insist that others be at least as nice as that person was.<br/>\nIn my opinion, high level Enchanters (level 30+) have a great outlet for<br/>\nmaking money. Not only can they brave the terrors of high level dungeons<br/>\nand usually get some nice loot, but their jewelcraft skill is also high<br/>\nenough that they are starting to make back the tons and tons of platinum<br/>\nthey dumped into improving the skill. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis Stein quest is a great way to make money for those Enchanters that are<br/>\nat the awkward 20th - 30th levels, where jewelcraft is still right around<br/>\nthe low to mid 100&#39;s, and you are still dumping money into it to become<br/>\ngood with gold and platinum. It burns me up when non-enchanters tell me<br/>\n&quot;Man, Enchanters have it made. You have jewelcraft AND this Stein quest.&quot; I<br/>\nwant to slap them in their stupid face. I have spent over 600 platinum on<br/>\njewelcraft and my skill is about 108 or so. 600 platinum. To other level<br/>\n20&#39;s that may not be much. But that is ALOT of money to me. ALOT more<br/>\nplatinum than I have MADE with jewelcraft.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe im not being as economical as I could be. If some of you other<br/>\nEnchanters around my level have some advice on other ways to make money,<br/>\nbesides fighting your group members for scraps in dungeons, or hoping to<br/>\nmake decent coin fighing Aviaks and Centaurs, or surviving the trains in<br/>\nUnrest, let me know, I would love to hear your advice :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is getting long, so i will sum up. This Stein quest may be an<br/>\nEnchanter only quest, but thats what gives it such profit potential for us.<br/>\nI think it is a great way for 20th - 30th level Enchanters to make some<br/>\ndecent money and work on their jewelcraft, or buy some decent armor and<br/>\nspells.  Sorry this is so long, and thanks for reading this far!<br/>\n<br/>\nTimn the Enchanter<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are some who call me . . .
