Any armor equipable by your true race will show up on another race you have taken the form of. Only problem is that you are a caster, and cant wear much","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2136738676\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;Just started an Erudite Enchanter, and having a blast. Some of these<br/>\n&gt;questions are probably asked often, so if there&#39;s a FAQ or other source<br/>\n&gt;that answers them, please feel free to point me there.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;1) Is there any armor available that gives the look of plate, chain, or at<br/>\n&gt;least leather?  I&#39;d like to be a little less naked when taking the form of<br/>\n&gt;a class that doesn&#39;t have robe graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Any armor equipable by your true race will show up on another race you have<br/>\ntaken the form of. Only problem is that you are a caster, and cant wear<br/>\nmuch other than cloth or magical armor. Only think I can think of that will<br/>\ngive you a nice armored look is Woven armor, and the ribcage armor from the<br/>\nGoblin Alchemist in Misty Thicket. Both appear as leather on your character.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2) Do any of the illusions provide racial abilities (wood elf forage, dark<br/>\n&gt;elf hide, etc. in addition to sight improvements?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The first illusion that offers a stat increase is the Earth Elemental<br/>\nillusion that you get at level 24. If you are looking to gain a skill while<br/>\nin the form of another race, the first (and only, I believe) skill that you<br/>\nwill recieve as part of your illusion repertoire is Slam. You will receive<br/>\nthe ability to Slam when you cast Illusion: Barbarian, which you get at<br/>\nlevel 16 (if memory serves).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3) How does Alliance work?  Does it always raise one faction level (e.g.<br/>\n&gt;dubious to apprehensive)?  Does it decrease faction with negative faction<br/>\n&gt;groups (e.g. if I cast it on a deathfist orc, will it make me less liked<br/>\n&gt;by the commons residents)?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You cast alliance once on a member of a faction group in a zone, and your<br/>\nfaction will increase with the group by a certain amount. The amount is a<br/>\nnumerical value, so it wont always bring you from indifferent to amiable,<br/>\nor from glare to glower, etc. It all depends on what your beginning faction<br/>\nis with the ilk you cast on. As for the Alliance series decreasing your<br/>\nfaction in response to increased faction with a rival group, no, that does<br/>\nnot happen. Casting alliance only affects faction for the group to which<br/>\nyour target belongs. No other faction groups in the area are affected.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;4) At what level can I go into the evil cities?  My gnome necro can go<br/>\n&gt;into Neriak - can my agnostic enchanter go there in gnome form?  Can I go<br/>\n&gt;into Grobb or Oggok in dark elf form, or must I wait for ogre/troll form?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even as an agnostic, I think the simple fact that you are an Erudite will<br/>\nprevent you from venturing inside the evil cities. At level 12 you will get<br/>\nIllusion: Dark Elf, which (combined with your agnostic religion choice)<br/>\nshould grant you access to all evil cities. The Dark Elves will love you,<br/>\nand the Trolls and Ogres will tolerate you. Just be careful of the Shadow<br/>\nKnight guild area in the Ogre and Troll cities. Even as a Dark Elf, they<br/>\nmay find your presence offensive. I am not agnostic nor Erudite, so your<br/>\nresults may vary. Just giving fair warning.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you in your playing, and I hope you enjoy the Enchanter class<br/>\nas much as I have.<br/>\n<br/>\nTimn the Enchanter<br/>\nLevel 40, Erollisi Marr server.<br/>\n&quot;There are some who call me . . .
