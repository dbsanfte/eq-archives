I&#39;ve been using a <br/>\nWorn Great Staff pretty exclusively for the past few levels (Currently at 9) <br/>\nand is it worth me continuing using the 2H Blunt style or should I give it <br/>\nup in favor of 1H or Piercing? I&#39;ve been doing fine using it with support <br/>\nfrom my pet backing me up for melee. But are there better 2H Blunt weapons <br/>\ndown the road or should I invest quickly in a different weapon style to <br/>\ninsure I will have an interesting array of weapons in my future?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then again someone&#39;s post stated that why are Enchanters even getting <br/>\nnear the high level mobs. So maybe I shouldn&#39;t be fussing over weapons since <br/>\nI won&#39;t be doing melee later anyways.. Any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- Random (Calamwen, Enchanter of Bristlebane)<br/>\nGairyu Isle ~ A Samurai Shodown Fanfiction Site<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Temple/8818\">http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Temple/8818</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
