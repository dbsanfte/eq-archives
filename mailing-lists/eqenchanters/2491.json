The preacher spawned 3 times for us last night and we<br/>\nwere all over the room, including on the stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was also a Vox raid last night.  That was a lot of fun to listen to<br/>\nas well.  I&#39;m getting exited for the times when I can go join. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks also for the advice on Mesmerisation.  If I stay back towards the<br/>\nstage, and the puller pulls to the front of the room I can mezz everything<br/>\nwithout getting myself mezzed.  Though it was a bit annoying I can&#39;t<br/>\nenthrall while they&#39;re all mezzed, but it did get us out of quite a few<br/>\nsticky situations.  I was able to hold everything back while our casters<br/>\ngated out and our tanks ran to the zone(gotta love having a bard with<br/>\ninvis song in the group, hehe), then zone myself (ugly pull. with all<br/>\ncasters oom and tanks lown on health.  bad picture.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!!!!<br/>\nEzrae<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 20 Mar 2000, td wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n.From: td &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tomaaas@...\">tomaaas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n.<br/>\n.I don&#39;t think it is true. When we camped him a while<br/>\n.back, once we cleared the room, we hang out on the<br/>\n.stage and pulled to it from behind, from the entrance<br/>\n.and sometimes the hallway. He spawned 4 out of first 5<br/>\n.times, then not for the next 3, then again.

He<br/>\n.&gt; only spawned twice all<br/>\n.&gt; day yesterday (and my group was very careful not to<br/>\n.&gt; walk on the stage.<br/>\n.&gt; heh).
