Similarly a charmed pet that casts a DoT then breaks<br/>\ncharm before the target dies could have this happen, though I&#39;ve never seen<br/>\nit.<br/>\n2) You are too far away when the creature dies.<br/>\n3) Group exp bug. There are numerous cases of individuals getting exp over<br/>\ngroups (still), usually unintenionally. However the exp thing is coded it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to be the group that does the most damage that gets the exp. It<br/>\nseems more like whoever does the most damage in the round of combat the<br/>\ncreature dies in.<br/>\n4) The thing you kill is blue or higher but gives no experience e.g.<br/>\nmerchant.<br/>\n<br/>\nMawrin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: JasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 14 February 2000 16:11<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqenchanters] Glowing Black Stone<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, I would say that you either killed a green mob with your<br/>\n&gt; pet or it was<br/>\n&gt; actually your pet that died.
