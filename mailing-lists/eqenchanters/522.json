Use the<br/>\nas wisely as you possible can. If you are not going to be serious about<br/>\njewel craft, dont use any there at all. I would highly suggest saving them<br/>\nfor Research and Speicalize and Dodge. As for Speicalize, once again, save<br/>\nem if your about to get level 20 or already have, for at this time it is<br/>\nbroken. The way I understand it, specialize will allow you to raise your<br/>\nschools of magic higher than currently available. As for Dodge, only put 1<br/>\ntraining point to it, it will improve on it&#39;s own just fine if you keep<br/>\nyour melee skills up. As for the levels past 22, you will have very little<br/>\nuse for them excluding the luxuries such as languages, fishing (HA!) and<br/>\nwhatever. To comment about Research, it is the easiest skill to raise in<br/>\nthe game, yet hardest to find the pages we need to raise the skill. Unless<br/>\nyou want to be the last person to have the spells obtained by Research, I&#39;d<br/>\nhighly suggest pouring all the points you can into this and buying the tomb<br/>\nof Endless Enchantments (the red book). As for keeping your different<br/>\nschools of magic max ed, that is simple enough with proper attention to<br/>\nyour current skill and making sure they are max ed. I personally feel it is<br/>\na total waste of training points to put them toward anything that will max<br/>\nout on its own with just a little effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTelan Ka`Rlaah of Rellos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
