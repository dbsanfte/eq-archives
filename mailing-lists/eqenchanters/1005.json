I havent soloed since level 5.<br/>\n6) to make a lot of xp, try parties of 2. With the debufs you can make any<br/>\nyellow a blue or a green, and while you focus on that, your partner can<br/>\neasily take care of the monster.<br/>\n7) in large parties ( 6 people ), when attacking one big red...well stay<br/>\naside because you are useless anyway,<br/>\n8) in large parties, when attacking a bunch of blues to yellow, try to<br/>\nswitch target quite often so you will have a better overall effect over the<br/>\nbattle and no monster will especially get mad at you and come for you. Also<br/>\nkeep charm handy in case your pet dies. Always warn your group that you<br/>\nmight charm a monster BEFORE battle, and always warn them that the charmed<br/>\ncreature will eventually come back for you and no taunting will get it off<br/>\nyou so they have to watch and protect you. Let them also know how mesmerize<br/>\nworks so they dont attack stunned creatures<br/>\n9) One big life saver: do not panic! most spellcasting class have one thing<br/>\nto do when some monster start pounding on you: RUN! but not us! Stay calm!<br/>\nif you&#39;re under 2 bubs of hp you&#39;ll die if you run anyway. cast root ( fast<br/>\nto cast ) right after an attack, back off, cast mesmerize and then RUN LIKE<br/>\nHELL. That saved me a million times.<br/>\n10) explore to find nice hunting areas suitable for your level and close to<br/>\na zone. One of my favorites recently has been lavastorm mountains, near the<br/>\nnajena entrance. Lots of xp, lots of loot, and a very close zone point.<br/>\n11) Ah! I forgot! USE THE LURE METHOD. Do not run into mob, make it come to<br/>\nyou at a safe point, even if you have to run 30s with it on your tail before<br/>\nyou get there.<br/>\n12) play with the mouse! arrow keys dont allow to turn around quickly enough<br/>\n<br/>\nmy 12 cents,<br/>\nSkara<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Eain Bankins [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eain@...\">eain@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 20, 1999 11:44 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] To Franck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Eain Bankins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eain@...\">eain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWanderer CommonWealth wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Wanderer CommonWealth &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wanderercw@...\">wanderercw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Practice try diffrent things,<br/>\n&gt; I got my ultimate one at times i can handle things red<br/>\n&gt; to me.
