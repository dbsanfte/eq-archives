With all of us<br/>\nhaving<br/>\n&gt; SoW and me having Memory Blur (MB) we didn&#39;t think we&#39;d have a problem,<br/>\neven<br/>\n&gt; though we are all low-mid 20&#39;s. Well, we couldn&#39;t touch that hill giant<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; spells even after my tashani. The tank was hysterical and wouldn&#39;t run<br/>\nclose<br/>\n&gt; enough for me to get off a MB to get the giant off him. In the end,<br/>\neveryone<br/>\n&gt; but me zoned, so the hill giant comes straight for me. I start pushing the<br/>\n&gt; MB key... Target out of range!... Target out of range!... You begin to<br/>\ncast<br/>\n&gt; a spell.... A hill giant blinks. The hill giant then changed direction and<br/>\n&gt; went about his merry way. Cool!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now that we know we can&#39;t take a hill giant, and bolstered by our<br/>\nexperience<br/>\n&gt; with the hill giant (noone died), we decided to try a griffon. This one<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t go nearly as well. The griffon turned out to be just as magic<br/>\n&gt; resistant as the hill giant, and a LOT faster. After unsuccessfully trying<br/>\n&gt; our spells, the call went out for MB. The tank ran the griff near me and I<br/>\n&gt; cast MB. A griffon blinks. Problem was, it kept chasing the tank! The tank<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t like that news so he kept running for the zone. I chased him a bit<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; try and get another cast of MB off. I guess at that point I was closer to<br/>\n&gt; the griffon than the tank because it turned for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You begin to cast a spell.<br/>\n&gt; A griffon claws you for 96 points of damage!<br/>\n&gt; A griffon claws you for 96 points of damage!<br/>\n&gt; A griffon kicks you for 34 points of damage!<br/>\n&gt; You keep your concentration and finish the spell! (don&#39;t know how...)<br/>\n&gt; A griffin blinks.<br/>\n&gt; A griffon claws you for 78 points of damage!<br/>\n&gt; A griffon claws you for 89 points of damage!<br/>\n&gt; A griffon bashes you for 28 points of damage!<br/>\n&gt; You are stunned!<br/>\n&gt; You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>\n&gt; You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>\n&gt; You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>\n&gt; You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>\n&gt; A griffin claws you  for 56 points of damage!<br/>\n&gt; A griffon kicks you for 32 points of damage!<br/>\n&gt; You have been slain by a griffon!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The question I have is, what is the correct way to use MB? Apparently, it<br/>\n&gt; wipes the hate list, but if you are in the critter&#39;s aggro radius the<br/>\n&gt; critter will just jump you again.
