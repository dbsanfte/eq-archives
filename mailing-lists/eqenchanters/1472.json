It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;insane green mob&#39;s should resist at all, let alone what we deal with after<br/>\n&gt;the patch. So let them know, tell em you want it the way it was. <br/>\n&gt;FYI, they also reduced the damage (to mana) from mana sieve GREATLY! Before<br/>\n&gt;the patch, it would totally drain a lvl 39 wizard to out of mana. Now, it<br/>\n&gt;takes a total of 4 cast to do the same. Also, the effect would last 3 to 5<br/>\n&gt;min. preventing them from meditating in that time. Now they can meditate<br/>\n&gt;right off. Once again, these changes were not announced, therefor a bug and<br/>\n&gt;if not, it should be changed back to the way it was, or least made stronger<br/>\n&gt;than it is after the patch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Telan Ka`Rlaah<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With more than 20 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;...ONElist is home to the liveliest discussions on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nSilverlock,  ICQ 474725\t\t\t<br/>\n<br/>\nHousehold Pests?
