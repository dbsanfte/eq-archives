Here&#39;s some that I know of:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnrest to Dagnar&#39;s Cauldron:<br/>\nIf you are hit on your way out of Unrest you may fall &quot;below&quot; the world.<br/>\nYou will find yourself in the water under the land which goes around the<br/>\nlake.  When this happened to my wife I suggested she swim off the edge.<br/>\nDon&#39;t do that!  She fell for 10,000 points of damage and I had to get my<br/>\nnecro to locate her corpse (which was beneath the land near 0,0).  Without a<br/>\nnecro we would have never found it.  Meanwhile we had petitioned a GM and he<br/>\nwas sad when he finally got to us because my wife had already looted her<br/>\ncorpse otherwise he would have res&#39;ed her.  When the same thing happened to<br/>\nme I knew not to swim of the edge but what to do?  I swam to the middle and<br/>\nclimbed up the island.  Once you do this you can swim back to the land and<br/>\nclimb up.<br/>\n<br/>\nOasis to No Ro:<br/>\nIf you are hit hard enough (sand giant, etc.) on your way out of Unrest you<br/>\nmay find yourself near the inn but the kicker is you will fall for some<br/>\nsmall amount of damage.  It&#39;s not much but if you were almost dead you will<br/>\nbe dead after you fall.  This is a change from a while back where you would<br/>\nbounce back into Oasis at full health (which was kind of cool).<br/>\n<br/>\nBeholder Maze to Runneyeye:<br/>\nHad to run from a train that was led into the entrance of Runneyeye.  Got<br/>\nhit going through apparently and died.  My corpse was not on either side of<br/>\nthe zone.  I managed to find it in Runneye in the first alcove to the left<br/>\nby the little stream.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone know of others?<br/>\nShawn<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jenni [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 21, 1999 12:36 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] Digest Number 205<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jenni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOn fighting in Lavastorm:<br/>\n<br/>\nBe very very careful if you are fighting near the entrance to Najena.

After being ambushed by 3 fire<br/>\nelementals<br/>\nwhile looting my corpse (I just got all my armor, but my bags were on my<br/>\ncorpse)  I ran to the zone to Najena because there was no way I was going to<br/>\nlive otherwise.  Instead of zoning into the hallway where you&#39;re supposed to<br/>\nend<br/>\nup, I ended up in a room full of Magicians and pets and was immediately<br/>\nkilled.<br/>\nI had to petition to get my corpse (which took 2 hours).  The GM that helped<br/>\nme<br/>\nwas very nice and pulled my corpse out to safety for me.  When this happened<br/>\nto<br/>\na friend of mine the GM&#39;s weren&#39;t quite so nice.  They didn&#39;t believe that<br/>\nhe<br/>\njust zoned in to avoid a monster they believed he was &quot;exploring&quot; in Najena<br/>\n(at<br/>\nlevel 12!).  It took him 2 hours of arguing with a GM before he got his<br/>\ncorpse<br/>\nback.  Both GM&#39;s mentioned that this does happen occasionally at that zone<br/>\nedge<br/>\n(the second GM said my friend&#39;s corpse was on the wrong side of the room :(<br/>\n).<br/>\nI have no idea if or when they plan on fixing it. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nHas this happened to anyone else?<br/>\n<br/>\nEzrae<br/>\nStill level 14<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Jesernig wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Paul Jesernig&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwj@...\">pwj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Solo hunting?
