I&#39;ve been groving from 20 to 25 in the lake of ill omen, easy exp, I only die now when...well, I haven&#39;t died in quiet a while! The down side is...bored. Ran a shadow knight from 1-8 just to take a break.<br/>\nTonight my lv 25 enchanter will be at Castle Mistmoore for the Halloween bash (Our guild, the Nameless of Norath, on the nameless server, is hosting a server wide raid).  I need somewhere interesting and good for growth to hunt. But with enough people to not spend a long time standing around looking for a group. Should I stay in Castle Mistmoore? Or go else where? Or what?<br/>\n<br/>\nVroc, Enchanter on the Nameless<br/>\n_____________________<br/>\n&quot;The more I learn, o, the less I know<br/>\nFriend or foe?
