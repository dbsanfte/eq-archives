One sad evening, coming back from<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;very long quest that brought me to Kerra Island and South Karana, I got<br/>\n&gt;hacked multiple times in Riverdale losing about 4 bubs of xp because my<br/>\n&gt;invis wore off on me randomly. I got really pissed off that at level 16,<br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;could not manage to cast a level 8 spell reliably and decided to start<br/>\n&gt;another character more appropriate for travelling since I was very much<br/>\n&gt;into<br/>\n&gt;research and quests.<br/>\n&gt;With my enchantress, I got invisibility at level 4 and used it some<br/>\n&gt;times.<br/>\n&gt;It always seemed to work great but I might be wrong. Yesterday, I found<br/>\n&gt;out<br/>\n&gt;that this invisibility spell is as bad as gather shadows as a %$#%^^%$<br/>\n&gt;griffin nuked me a few seconds after I cast invisibility. Since then,<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;noticed the same kind on unreliability...but only since I made level<br/>\n&gt;8...I<br/>\n&gt;might be wrong.<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, I would like to know how&#39;s the enchanter&#39;s invisibility like at<br/>\n&gt;level 16 or 20 or more.
