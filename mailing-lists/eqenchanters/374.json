You<br/>\nshould NOT just start with jade.  The most cost effective way to build<br/>\nyour skill is to go from the cheapest stone up to the most expensive. <br/>\nWith jewlecraft you can increase your skill 2 points per stone before<br/>\nbeing forced to move up to the next level.  The reason it is most cost<br/>\neffective to do it this way is that you are more likely to succeed,<br/>\nwhich means you can sell the product back to the vendor for 5% loss or<br/>\nless, depending on your Charisma.  I don;t have the game open now<br/>\n(obviously) so I can&#39;t tell you which stone to use at skill 25.  You<br/>\ncan, however, count backwards because I do know the skill levels for<br/>\njade are 37 and 38, Amber is 35 and 36, Rose Quartz is 33 and 34,<br/>\ncarnelian 31-32, etc.  Count down two points per stone to the level you<br/>\nneed to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in case you care, I just got up to skill 36 but I failed my first<br/>\nattempt at jade.  Gotta collect 4 more PLat to try again!<br/>\n<br/>\nQuentin on E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;DeGirolami, Franck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:degirolami@...\">degirolami@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;DeGirolami, Franck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:degirolami@...\">degirolami@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; it seems to me that the first magic rings you can<br/>\n&gt; make cost around 2 or 3<br/>\n&gt; plats to make.. but I suppose that you can sell them<br/>\n&gt; for more...with a base<br/>\n&gt; skill of 21, I dont want to waste money making<br/>\n&gt; non-magic rings. With which<br/>\n&gt; stone do you think I can start practice with? do I<br/>\n&gt; have to start from<br/>\n&gt; malachite? can I start with Onyx? or even more<br/>\n&gt; expensive stones? thanks for<br/>\n&gt; the help.<br/>\n&gt; Also, can you tell me which rings you found out are<br/>\n&gt; the best to sell to<br/>\n&gt; players?<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Skara<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Eain Bankins [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eain@...\">eain@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, April 26, 1999 2:24 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] Re: Financial Aid<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Eain Bankins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eain@...\">eain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Honestly, it&#39;s a great idea.  Unfortunately, it<br/>\n&gt; takes SO much cash, that<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll have a problem convincing someone to do it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s what I do:  Go wisp hunting.  I have a necro<br/>\n&gt; that I team up with<br/>\n&gt; in the East and Wect commons.  At 8th level (maybe<br/>\n&gt; 4th too, I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; sure) Enchanter pets can hit magic.  :)  With two<br/>\n&gt; spellcasters, and two<br/>\n&gt; pets, as long as you can pull the wisps one at a<br/>\n&gt; time, you shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have any problems.  Also, pulling to a predesignated<br/>\n&gt; spot is great,<br/>\n&gt; because then as long as your partner can watch you<br/>\n&gt; incoming, he can tell<br/>\n&gt; you if there&#39;s anything else on you.  Good incase<br/>\n&gt; you start a train,<br/>\n&gt; then you can zone right away.  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bukaru, Teir&#39;Dal Enchanter, Test Server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Show mom you love her.
