They have snare and<br/>\nyou can use your fear spell.  You will find that in outdoor zones<br/>\nRanger/Enchanter, Druid/Enchanter, Shadow Knight/Enchanter and to a lesser<br/>\nextent Necromancer/Enchanter (because the necro really doesn&#39;t need you) all<br/>\nthese combinations are great.  My favorite is actually Ranger/Enchanter<br/>\nbecause there is allways a ranger out there looking for a group.  Let the<br/>\nRanger snare and you fear, make sure the Ranger backs out when fear is off<br/>\nor your down time will increase quite a bit while he tries to heal himself<br/>\nafter fights.<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\nI know all of this is the opposite of what I told you about grouping in<br/>\ndungeons to learn, but this is very good exp too.  Not so much at your lvl,<br/>\nbut after 29 or so when outdoor mobs start having enough HPS to make it<br/>\nworth while to use the mana on fearing them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: ansonidak [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ansonidak@...\">ansonidak@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 23, 2001 3:09 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@yahoogroups.com\">eqenchanters@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] Digest Number 374<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 14 you might take your group up to lavastorm mountains.
