There are at least 6 stones<br/>\n&gt; harder than jade.  I am at<br/>\n&gt; skill 28 and I am pretty much finished with Jade<br/>\n&gt; rings.  Jade has given me<br/>\n&gt; skills already and each stone will only give a few<br/>\n&gt; points.  I also noticed<br/>\n&gt; that your skill advances faster if you practice soon<br/>\n&gt; after leveling, and<br/>\n&gt; personally I always like to sit at a table to do my<br/>\n&gt; work, and it seems to<br/>\n&gt; cut down on the failures a bit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cogg- Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 09:04 AM 5/3/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Miko, Jeff&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JMiko@...\">JMiko@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This really got me mad yesterday. I put as many<br/>\n&gt; training points as I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;could into Jewelcraft. I then sunk 40 platinum into<br/>\n&gt; the skill. I sold<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all the stuff I made and put it back into the<br/>\n&gt; skill.  This got me to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;skill of 37 where I was combining Amber and silver.<br/>\n&gt; I was in Freeport at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the time and my skill was rising very fast I<br/>\n&gt; thought. Last night I sunk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;over 70 platinum into the skill. I went up a notch<br/>\n&gt; to using Jade and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;enchanted silver to make Mana Rings.  In 20<br/>\n&gt; attempts I made 13 rings and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;got NO SKILL IMPROVEMENT AT ALL.  What gives?  Am I<br/>\n&gt; doing something<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wrong? I thought my 70 platinum investment would<br/>\n&gt; get me to at least 40<br/>\n&gt; &gt;skill or higher. Now I&#39;m broke, but I have yet to<br/>\n&gt; sell the Jade rings<br/>\n&gt; &gt;because I was tired and frustrated. If I can get<br/>\n&gt; 7-8 platinum per ring I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;should get most of my money back. I would<br/>\n&gt; appreciate any help here guys.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Also, I found my success rate making jewelry better<br/>\n&gt; when I had full<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mana.
