I have been<br/>\n&gt;told that the only place to get Mircyl&#39;s Animation is in High<br/>\n&gt;Hold Keep. I know the way is treacherous, and am asking for<br/>\n&gt;help from my fellow enchanters. Attached below is a map of<br/>\n&gt;High Hold Pass that I got off of one of the most incredible EQ<br/>\n&gt;map sites I have seen to date. Unfortunately, almost everything<br/>\n&gt;on the site is in Japanese. If one of you who has made the trip<br/>\n&gt;could mark the path to take from Kithicor to the bank, then to<br/>\n&gt;the vendor who sells the spells and maybe annotate a few<br/>\n&gt;things to watch out for (like the prisoners past the bank), I, along<br/>\n&gt;with all the up-and-coming enchanters out there, would be<br/>\n&gt;very appreciative.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Oh, here is the link to that webisite...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~hakata/eq/index2.html\">http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~hakata/eq/index2.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thank you in advance...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Qinie, 8th circle Enchantress<br/>\n&gt;Mithaniel Marr server<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
