(skill was 201 went up making some jewelry for a \n  friend.) So from 201<br>to 206 how much money do you think I lost? Actually \n  nothing.&nbsp; I made some<br>money, I enchanted every bar and I was making \n  money selling it back to<br>vendor (vendor bought gold ruby rings back for \n  147pp and some change, cost<br>131p and change 10p and change for the gem and \n  bar respectively) So I made<br>about 5p of each one.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t keep track \n  of 201 to 203 but from 203 to 206<br>I made 240 Gold Ruby Rings selling them \n  all back to the vendor, I think I<br>failed 6 times.&nbsp; While I was making \n  these I would /auction some of the 4int<br>2str earrings and 4str 2int \n  earrings.&nbsp; Dont like to mess with plat to order.<br>The only time I do \n  plat is when I loot some Fire Opals and then just try my<br>luck.&nbsp; Anyone \n  else trying to raise it past 200?&nbsp; I know Plat malachite is<br>cheaper \n  each attempt but the mana to enchant the bars was killing me ( I<br>tried 20 \n  with no increases). <br><br>Any ideas, Suggestions, or Experiences \n  here?<br><br>Teenimu<br>Enchanter Tunare Server<br>53 Season<br><br>Btw my int \n  was 213 while doing these.<br>And wisdom of below 100 not sure what it \n  was.&nbsp; But I don&#39;t believe in the<br>wisdom theory.
