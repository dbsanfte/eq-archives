Up until jade, or perhaps the<br/>\nstone just before Jade, you can get 2 points per stone before it<br/>\nbecomes trivial, assuming you have used the previous stone up to<br/>\ntrivial.  I belive at Jade or Amber you can start getting 3 points per<br/>\nstone.  Jade became trivial for me at skill 40.
