The only reason they say enchanters are good<br/>\nfor groups is cause they are, they mold the battle to<br/>\nwhat they want it to become. They can weaken and fear,<br/>\nroot and strength and haze. But if you goto<br/>\neqenchanters website you will see under the strategies<br/>\nsection that there are a lot of ways enchanters can go<br/>\nsolo with their pets. Whats fun about enchanters is<br/>\nthat they can Screw with the monsters while killing<br/>\nthem. Example: Orc Leggion that is red to me,<br/>\nMEzmerize, Tashan, Root, Chaotic sphere, Suffocating<br/>\nsphere, Mezmerice Root Etc... Except you can cast more<br/>\nattack spells inbetween . This is how i killed them.<br/>\nAnyway I had no pet then i&#39;m sure i could have killed<br/>\nit with less risk of dying with my pet. I&#39;ll tell you<br/>\nnow they are not that great till you hit about level 4<br/>\nor 8 than you notice things but at 12 with your charm<br/>\nspell you can have fun.<br/>\nThe Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kubleais@...\">Kubleais@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kubleais@...\">Kubleais@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not in EQ yet, but I&#39;m seriously considering it.<br/>\n&gt;  Main question I have is <br/>\n&gt; whether it&#39;s really worthwhile/fun/possible to play<br/>\n&gt; the enchanter class solo? <br/>\n&gt;  Stuff I&#39;ve read so far kinda says that if you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; not in a group, you&#39;re not <br/>\n&gt; goin anywhere...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list<br/>\n&gt; members? <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events,<br/>\n&gt; meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>===<br/>\nThe Wanderer<br/>\nMay The Wanderers Protect You<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
