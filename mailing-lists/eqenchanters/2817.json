Why did you choose the name of your character? What does it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1184557823\">I asked myself a question last night that I hope all of you will reply to<br/>\nwhen I ask it of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did you choose the name of your character? What does it mean to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so that is 2 questions, shoot me. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thought entered my mind as I sat last night trying to come up with a<br/>\nname for my gnome enchanter. I do not like the name generator that Verant so<br/>\nkindly provides. Answering this question(s) became the real challenge and<br/>\ngave my pixels a minor RP perspective that is truly lacking in this game. I<br/>\nlove the game, but the war for XP dominates the minds of 98.9% (&lt;~ note the<br/>\npun?) of those that subscribe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, what follows is a breakdown of why I chose the names I did. I am<br/>\nintrigued to see the results if all of you did the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonal history: I have been playing RPs since 73, and picked up WhiteWolf<br/>\nas the dominant favorite since 92.<br/>\n<br/>\nArakine Uktena, Woodelf Druid:<br/>\nArakine-<br/>\nFrom the movie Dune. Arakis, desert planet. Paul says at one point &quot;We shall<br/>\nsqueeze and squeeze until no Harkonin breathes Arakine air.&quot;.  The planet<br/>\nitself is a desert filled with danger, yet has the potential to become a<br/>\nlush garden paradise.<br/>\nUktena-<br/>\nAmerican Indian tribe, and a tribe of Werewolves from WhiteWolf&#39;s &quot;Werewolf:<br/>\nthe Apocalypse!&quot;. Violent, bloody bastards that guard the spiritual foci and<br/>\nare the closest to the Spirits.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nUthanatos, Gnome Enchanter:<br/>\nNo last name yet, but I will have a while before I need to worry about it.<br/>\n;-)<br/>\nFrom WhiteWolf&#39;s &quot;Mage: the Ascension&quot;, Euthantos.  A Tradition of mages<br/>\nthat believe death should come to all. They are to help others to meet Death<br/>\nwhen they try to avoid it and have nothing left to give, or to preserve Life<br/>\nwhen their existence still has something to contribute to those around them.<br/>\nAlso called Death Mages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may apply to Necromancers, but to me the Enchanter class is the true<br/>\nembodiment of the Euthanatos. They can ultimately control the outcome of<br/>\nalmost any battle so that the &quot;Life&quot; of the party is preserved (by being<br/>\ncompetent) or they can hasten the grip of Death upon his fellows (by being<br/>\ninept).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, there you have it. One step closer into the mind of Me. Reply if you<br/>\nwish, I for one would enjoy reading it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nArakine<br/>\nFennin<br/>\n<br/>\naka<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nUthanatos<br/>\nFennin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
