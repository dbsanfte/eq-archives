Cast illusion: darkelf when standing before the NPC, but consider first to make shure he won&#39;t attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ1.03: <br/>\nWhere can i find enchanter animation spells for lvl 8 and above?<br/>\nA1.03: <br/>\nThey can only be found in High Hold Keep<br/>\n<br/>\nQ1.04: <br/>\nHow do i get to High Hold Keep alive?<br/>\nA1.04:<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter entering from Kithicor, stick to the main path.  Now, when you get to a bridge, DO NOT CROSS.  The path continues if you look to the right. Eventually you will reach a Y.  You can see buildings to the right, you want to go left into the mines.  Cross through and you should come out in front of the keep.  In the mines, if I remember right, do not go through the square opening, go the other way. This pretty much goes with what I see on the map.  Stay invised, do not cross the bridge, and stay away from orcs and gnolls.  <br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSection 2: Questions concerning functionality of enchanter spells<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nQ2.01: <br/>\nAre there any enchant: ore or other spells available that will affect weapons?<br/>\n<br/>\nA2.01:<br/>\nOther than the enchantment of brilliance line of spells no spells are known that affect weapons. there are rumours that these spells will be implemented one day.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSection 3: Questions concerning spell research<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nQ3.01: <br/>\nWhen can i start researching and what do i need to start?<br/>\nA3.01: <br/>\nAll magi begin researching spells at level 16. To do spell research,you will need a Tome specific to your class - these can be purchased in your guild hall. <br/>\nWizards use a Lexicon<br/>\nMages use an Elemental Grimoire<br/>\nEnchanters use a Tome of Endless Enchantments<br/>\nNecromancers use a Book of Dark Bindings <br/>\n<br/>\nQ3.02: <br/>\nAre there any instruction books available?       <br/>\nA3.02: <br/>\nResearch instruction books can also be purchased in your guild hall. All instruction books are written in languages other than common. Research instruction books will list the components needed to produce a scroll. Spell components can be found scattered throughout the world - they appear randomly on different creatures, so you will not have to &#39;camp&#39; a spot to get a certain component. Components can be stored and traded - ask around - 13 of the 14 classes out there will not be able to use the research component that you need. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ3.03: <br/>\nHow can i learn other languages?<br/>\nA3.03: <br/>\nTo learn the fundamentals of a language, you must train one point in the language with your guild master. Once you have learned the fundamentals, you will be able to advance your linguistic skills through use - usually by listening to someone speak in that language. <br/>\nAs a tip form a group with different races, or persons speaking the desired language, everyone switching to his native language or the one he can teach, customize a social button with a gsay phrase of 3 to 4 lines, and start everyone to hit this button over and over spamming the others with that phrase in the other languages, maybe while fishing or any other relax time,<br/>\nand note your skill going up in the languages spoken by the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ3.04: <br/>\nWhere do i find research components?<br/>\nA3.04: <br/>\nResearch components are usually found on intelligent creatures, or on creatures that are innately magical. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ3.05:<br/>\nHas there any spell ever been researched successfully? Or is the skill broken?<br/>\nA3.05: <br/>\nBerserker Strenght is obtained by combining both left and right pages 30 of Tasarin&#39;s grimoire, leaving 2 other slots empty in the tomb.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSection 4: Questions concerning spell specialization<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nn/a <br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSection 5: Questions concerning trade skills<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nQ5.01: <br/>\nI want to learn jewellcrafting what do i need basically?<br/>\nA5.01: <br/>\nBasically you need to purchase a jewellcrafting kit at about 1.5pg depending on your race/charisma and a lot of money, or alternativly 1 better 2 sponsors :-) It is advisable to train as much skillpoint as possible into the skill at your guild (about 21), as these advancements are far less expensive then failure as all ingredients cost the hell.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ5.02: <br/>\nHow do i advance my skill in jewellcrafting?<br/>\nA5.02: <br/>\nStart with cheapest gems and advance with your skill-lvl, using the following recommondation list. When you hit the lvl 23 e.g. start with silver + bloodstone for further advancements. The column mag.effects states whether the object can be magical when enchanting silverbar before crafting.<br/>\n<br/>\ngem               cost  met  lvl Obj.  mag. <br/>\nname              ca.                  effects<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nMalachite         56    slv  13  rg    n/a<br/>\nLapis Lazuli      100   slv  15  rg    n/a<br/>\nTurquoise         123   slv  17  bl    n/a<br/>\nHematite          167   slv  19  rg    n/a<br/>\nCats eye Agathe   223   slv  21  nc    n/a<br/>\nBloodstone        558   slv  23  er    n/a<br/>\nOnyx              725   slv  25  bl    n/a<br/>\nJasper            837   slv  27  rg    n/a<br/>\nAquamarine        893   slv  29  ?     n/a<br/>\nCarnelian         946   slv  31  rg*   n/a<br/>\nStar Rose Quartz  1116  slv  33  rg**  n/a<br/>\nAmber             2790  slv  35  rg    n/a<br/>\nJade              3906  slv  37  rg    mana+5<br/>\nTopaz             5580  slv  39  nc    dise+4 <br/>\nWolf&#39;s Eye Agate  3571  slv  41  ?     ? <br/>\nPearl             5022  slv  43  rg    pois+4<br/>\nPeridot           11161 slv  45  rg    cold+4 <br/>\nEmerald           14509 slv  47  rg    fire+4 <br/>\nOpal              18973 slv  49  ?     ? <br/>\nBlack Pearl       22321 slv  50  ?     ? <br/>\n...
