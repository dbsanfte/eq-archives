Ok you know the song, this time I fill the role<br/>\n:).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMay I point out that the message said that the code was going to be<br/>\nimplemented, not that -we- enchanters are going to benefit from it. True,<br/>\nit was stated in the book we could do it, but at no time in B4 it was in<br/>\neffect, and, according to EQE, we received other benefits to make up for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs I see it, such thing would overbalance us (enchanters) in regard of<br/>\nother pure spell user classes. So either the benefit will be too small to<br/>\neven consider it or too huge and Verant might take out something in return<br/>\nto balance our classe again. Don&#39;t tell me we&#39;re nerfed now. We were, true,<br/>\nbut that was sometime ago and from my point of view we are rather balanced<br/>\nregarding other pure spell users. To sum up we have our &quot;niche&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo, the idea is: By talking here, and offering Verant options to consider<br/>\nwe may have a say in the matter and make our class fuller in the way -we-<br/>\nsee it. What I would like to see discussed here is : What can we give up to<br/>\nhave a &#39;proper&#39; enchantment line of spells?. Or are we just to receive this<br/>\nnew ability/spell/line of spells without giving up anything?. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs stated above, I dont think we can&#39;t expect a &#39;useful&#39; line of<br/>\nenchantment&#39;s spells unless we give up something in exchange. Thinking back<br/>\nof Beta, there was a line of spells we didn&#39;t have but nonetheless still<br/>\nmanaged to survive and prosper : Pet line of spells. Plus they don&#39;t fit<br/>\nenchanters very well . On the other hand, this line form the very core of<br/>\nmost of our solo strategies so losing it wouldn&#39;t be a small thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis is just an example, a topic&#39;s starter. Feel free to agree, disagree<br/>\nor tell me to shut up. Once again my aim to to talk things out here first<br/>\nand offer something (petition/ EQE/ you name it) constructive to Verant<br/>\nbefore we see something not implemented or half implemented in place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nIbnabeth / Karana<br/>\nstill going up<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 13:09 21/07/1999 +1000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   Thant would be very handy....O well will have to wait and  see...   <br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----    From:    Mike    Cummins    To:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>    Sent: Tuesday, 20 July 1999  11:15:PM  <br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] about the new    enchant items   <br/>\n&gt;   It sounds like we will be able to enchant already    made items, and<br/>\n&gt;possibly materials for blacksmithing, weaponsmithing    etc..            <br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----      From:      Freedom           To:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>      Sent: Tuesday, July 20, 1999 12:21      AM   <br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] about the new      enchant items     <br/>\n&gt;     I was wondering will this allow as to enchant other      stuff apart<br/>\n&gt;for bar&#39;s of silver and such.       <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
