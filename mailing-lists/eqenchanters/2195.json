Skellies will help each other, much like spiders will.  It is easy<br/>\nto avoid this since they are not static spawns.  They will drop and wander.<br/>\nThe shores are safe and I have never been jumped there.  Its kind of eerie<br/>\nfighting within visual range of Spectres though.  Fortunately, their aggro<br/>\nrange is small, and they do not wander..  I spent all of last night there (on<br/>\nBrell) with a 20ish monk, and a 20ish Mage.  They were soloing the gargoyles<br/>\nwhile I took out the Skellies.  It was truelly one of the most pleasurable EQ<br/>\nexperiences I had.  2 hours, a boat load of cash and exp, and not once did I<br/>\neven come close to meeting my maker.  Heck, I didn&#39;t even lose my pet.<br/>\nGOODBYE OASIS!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be fair, the loot still didn&#39;t compare to Karana bandits though.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
