While it&#39;s true you<br/>\ncan wait for your dark elf illusion spell and invis yourself to the guards<br/>\nyou won&#39;t know the way through the maze that is neriak.  The library is in a<br/>\nzone called &quot;The 3rd Gate&quot; which is two zones in from the 1st neriak city<br/>\nzone.  You probably won&#39;t want to be wandering around in there any longer<br/>\nthan necessary so trying to find your way won&#39;t be much fun knowing your<br/>\nspells could fail at any time.  Many new dark elves ask for help navigating<br/>\nthrough the city.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the change a while back to allow multiple copies of spells to be<br/>\ncarried you may find someone to sell it to you.  I&#39;d make a button to<br/>\n/auction Buying enchant silver spell and let a savvy businessperson help you<br/>\nout.<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck to you,<br/>\nShawn<br/>\nFlarfian, lvl 17 dark elf necromancer<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Christine Greenwald [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ChrisRAV4@...\">ChrisRAV4@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 03, 1999 6:51 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] A question about Enchant Silver<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Christine Greenwald &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ChrisRAV4@...\">ChrisRAV4@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi everyone-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been lurking on the list for the last week or so and have found your<br/>\ndiscussions very valuable as a beginning jeweler.  Last night I made level 8<br/>\nand would like to obtain the Enchant Silver spell. It is my understanding<br/>\nthe<br/>\nspell is located in the Library in Neriak, a place to which I haven&#39;t been.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is: as a high-elf enchanter, am I KOS in Neriak? (I&#39;m betting<br/>\nprobably so...) If so, what strategies did you use to obtain the spell? I<br/>\nhave<br/>\nnot seen anyone in in Greater Faydark selling the spell on the Erollisi Marr<br/>\nserver.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour comments will be most helpful. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChristine<br/>\nknown Minbari on Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist members: don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist<br/>\nJoin our community member news update at <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
