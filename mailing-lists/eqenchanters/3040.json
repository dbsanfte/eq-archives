(again) When I \n<br>created Galadriana, I was pretty much clueless about what religion I should \n<br>pick and so forth. I for some reason chose Rodcet Nife, well what a mistake \n<br>THAT was. I cast illusion drybone on myself.. but the spec&#39;s killed me \n<br>because of my god.. next time I casted improved invis on myself and got thru \n<br>everything &nbsp;including the spec&#39;s BUT &nbsp;as soon as I cast collaboration on \n<br>reania the other guild masters instantly killed me, because of my religion. \n<br> &nbsp;I am currently working on the crate quest in qeynos to up my faction with \n<br>opaldarkbriar, and I&#39;ve smacked old Neclo Rheslar in west karana several \n<br>times too. (opal is the necro guildmaster under freeport) . Does anyone have \n<br>any tips or hints or any suggestions as to what I can do that could help me \n<br>start this part of my epic so i dont get killed every single time??\n<br>\n<br>thanks, \n<br>Galadriana Dimystic\n<br>level 52 enchantress</font></font></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
