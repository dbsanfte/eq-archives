What you choose for specialization is dependant on your play <br/>\nstyle. It is RECOMMENDED that enchanters specialize in alteration, but if you <br/>\nthink another would be more useful, then specialize in that.  A <br/>\nspecialize:Conjuration would be useful as well for an enchanter who is strict <br/>\ncrowd control and doesn&#39;t buff/debuff as much.  Specialize:Alteration is simply <br/>\nrecommended mostly because most of the enchanters spells ARE Alteration.<br/>\n<br/>\nTinik<br/>\n19 Gnomish Enchanter<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wednesday, December 15, 1999 2:22 PM, Farr, Robert <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Robert.Farr@...\">Robert.Farr@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Farr, Robert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Robert.Farr@...\">Robert.Farr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The way I did it was to let the cards fall where they may.
