Once<br/>\nyou break level 19 you can put 4 or 5 in there (depending upon your magic<br/>\nclass), then once at 20, the skies the limit...<br/>\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>\nAlso, there is a way to practice your research w/o using real components:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mythiran.everquest.gamestats.com/practice.html\">http://mythiran.everquest.gamestats.com/practice.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nhope this helps,<br/>\nShawn<br/>\nBertt Earneeless, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jenni [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 29, 1999 3:06 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] Jeweler Questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jenni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Bahir,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also new to the list, but I might be able to help a bit with the jewlrey<br/>\nquestions.  More feedback is welcome :)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can add more points into your Jewlrey Craft skill after the base 21<br/>\npoints,<br/>\nbut they&#39;ll cost you.  The skills list will show how much it will cost to<br/>\nincrease the skill (given you have points to spend on them).  I personally<br/>\nprefer to increase my jewlrey skill by practicing making jewlrey instead of<br/>\nspending the money on skill points.  That would be the reason I don&#39;t add<br/>\nmore<br/>\npoints to jewlrey anymore.  My skill is still low (only at 35), but actually<br/>\nmaking the jewlrey gives for getting the money you put into the skill back,<br/>\ninstead of spending the money for the points, and not seeing the money<br/>\nback..<br/>\nAlso, as an enchanter, money for making the jewlrey (or anything else for<br/>\nthat<br/>\nmatter :)  ) isn&#39;t too hard to come by if you&#39;re patient.  We are the only<br/>\nclass that can complete the Stein of Mogguk quest easily, and the Stein is<br/>\nworth quite a bit of money, (I just sold mine for 250pp).  I&#39;ve run this<br/>\nquest<br/>\ntwice now, and I&#39;m planning on doing it a few more times.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure about the research question as I am only level 12 right now,<br/>\nbut I<br/>\nhave saved some of my practice points for research.  My question is this:<br/>\nWhere do I find the pages for the research?  after days of hunting the<br/>\ndervishes in North Ro I picked up one page (24 of Tasarin&#39;s left side).  Are<br/>\nthere any other places I might be able to pick these up quicker?<br/>\n<br/>\nEzrae<br/>\nDark Elf Enchantress of the 12th season<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRich Hitz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Rich Hitz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rich.Hitz@...\">Rich.Hitz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am new to the list and have Jeweling questions for you.<br/>\n&gt; My questions involves training points.<br/>\n&gt; After you spend the max 21 points at the guild and you get to your next<br/>\n&gt; level can you put those 5 into your Jewel Craft skill?
