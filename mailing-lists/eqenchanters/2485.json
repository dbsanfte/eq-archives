When we camped him a while<br/>\nback, once we cleared the room, we hang out on the<br/>\nstage and pulled to it from behind, from the entrance<br/>\nand sometimes the hallway. He spawned 4 out of first 5<br/>\ntimes, then not for the next 3, then again. So I<br/>\nsuspect that it is random.<br/>\n<br/>\nArcius<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Rumor has it though in the preacher room if you walk<br/>\n&gt; on the stage it will<br/>\n&gt; cause the Preacher not to spawn, Is this true?  He<br/>\n&gt; only spawned twice all<br/>\n&gt; day yesterday (and my group was very careful not to<br/>\n&gt; walk on the stage.<br/>\n&gt; heh).  Any truth in this? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
