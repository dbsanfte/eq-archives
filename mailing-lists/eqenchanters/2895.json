I had someone come up to me in oasis last night and say &quot;Can<br/>\nyou buff me?&quot;  I had time so what the heck, I threw on UV, aug, str, endure<br/>\nmagic, obscure, and even a rune III.  Did I get a thanks?  Nope, the<br/>\nresponse was &quot;can&#39;t you sow me too?&quot;  Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext was the response from some people when I participated in a dragon raid<br/>\nwith my guild.  I&#39;m level 35 so I raised some eyebrows when they saw me<br/>\nthere for Nagafen.  However, I was there just to hang out with my guild,cast<br/>\nclarity, and buff whenever my buffs were needed/wanted.  Many people were<br/>\nthankful as I was the only enchanter at times.  Others though turned their<br/>\nnoses up (none in my guild of course ;)) at aug because it wasn&#39;t swift like<br/>\nthe wind and endure magic because it wasn&#39;t a higher form of that buff.  I<br/>\ncast 100p worth of RuneIIIs and received thanks for a few but not for most.<br/>\nA guildmate gave me a saphire so the cost worked out in the end but it made<br/>\nme sad to see the reaction of some strangers to my help.  I&#39;m not aware of<br/>\nall of the spells that take components but if you didn&#39;t know it does cost<br/>\nyour friendly groupmates to cast some of those buffs.  If it&#39;s a normal<br/>\ngroup type situation I am happy to spend 20 or 30p for a night keeping the<br/>\npuller or primary tank Runed.  It&#39;s part of what I do.  Those who request<br/>\nRune and offer no thanks are the ones that get me though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are those who are confused why I&#39;m wearing such &quot;crappy<br/>\nequipment&quot; when I&#39;m also wearing a Tranix crown.  Hehe, what kind of<br/>\nquestion is that?  I&#39;m doing the best I can  8)   I was just very lucky my<br/>\nguild asked me to roll on the crown during a FG raid and I won.  That was<br/>\nanother time I tagged along to cast clarity and didn&#39;t dream I would be<br/>\nasked to roll on an item.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust remember to say please and thank you and it&#39;s so much more fun ;)  I&#39;m<br/>\nhappy to buff people for free mana permitting if they only would say thank<br/>\nyou.  Many do and I say thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nAzara Sparklemeister, Sacrament<br/>\n34th enchanter, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: (Uthanatos) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vtemplarv@...\">vtemplarv@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 06, 2000 1:03 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] (Re: to Mark ) and a rant (sorry ;-) )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nLast night I had a level 3 wizard come up to me and inspect me 9(!!!!) times<br/>\nin about 2 minutes. It isn&#39;t like my equipment changed in that time... then<br/>\nhe asked the question I knew was coming. &quot;Got any stuff you don&#39;t need, or<br/>\nplat?&quot;  &lt;~ asked for PLAT! He then followed with &quot;I&#39;m new to EQ.&quot;.  You have<br/>\ngot to be joking! A true newbie would not be asking for equipment, they<br/>\nwould be asking for what is safe to hunt here, and other basic questions. My<br/>\nreply was (after inspecting him 30 times or so rapidly) &quot;No, I need the<br/>\nequipment I have as I am using it. There is no such thing as money I don&#39;t<br/>\nneed, especially plat. Now go kill things for what you need like I did.&quot;  I<br/>\nthen got up and ran to my spawn point with SoW on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeggars get under my skin in a heartbeat. I don&#39;t mind helping others; in<br/>\nfact I enjoy it and give things away all the time. Nothing major, leather to<br/>\ndruids, etc and buffs are free. I just can&#39;t stand seeing people standing<br/>\noutside a bank for HOURS pestering every person that comes by for stuff when<br/>\nthey could have spent that time leveling.
