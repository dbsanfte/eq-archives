The guards kill dark elves on sight I believe, and they are much worse<br/>\nthan the orcs.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou were the victim of bad luck, i have made the trip with several L8<br/>\ncharacters (and a L4 one once before the animations were added locally)and<br/>\nhave never had an orc see through my invisibility.

But I must admit that I have<br/>\nnever found an Orc that can see invisible  ( I may be wrong, its just that I<br/>\nhave never ran into one).  What server are you on?  I am on the Rathe Server<br/>\nand would be happy to assist you in obtaining your Animation.  Here is<br/>\nanother Thought for you also:  You may want to use the Dark Elf illusion,<br/>\nthe Orcs in CrushBone do not attack me when I am using the DE illusion so<br/>\nperhaps the Orcs in Highpass will not either..  But I would still use<br/>\nINVIS..<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcos<br/>\nLvl 16 Enchanter  (if I can keep from dying haha)<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAttention Star Wars fans!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nONElist is the best place for your Star Wars list!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
