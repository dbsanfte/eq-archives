I have a<br/>\nrespectable<br/>\n\twisdom of 90 something and a skill level of 40 something (been<br/>\nplaying other<br/>\n\tcharacters so haven&#39;t leveled beyond 8 for a long... time) but I<br/>\nfail SO<br/>\n\tOFTEN with onyx and lower.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIs there a relationship with difficulty of attempt (even when<br/>\ntrivial) and<br/>\n\tthe rate of failure?  In other words, will I continue to fail the<br/>\nsame rate<br/>\n\ton average with a particular trivial combination even after raising<br/>\nmy skill<br/>\n\tlevel by working on harder combinations first?  I think there&#39;s no<br/>\n\timprovement to the failure rate on combinations that are pretty easy<br/>\nlike<br/>\n\tsilver/onyx even as I improved my skill in the recent past.  With<br/>\nthat in<br/>\n\tmind, I don&#39;t know if I should work with unenchanted electrum and<br/>\nmalachite<br/>\n\tto improve my skill level if the rate of trivial failures remains<br/>\nconstant.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThanks for any info or advice you might have.  If this is something<br/>\nyou<br/>\n\tcould ask someone or even better if there&#39;s a petition or list of<br/>\n\tsuggestions I would request one of the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSubject: Rate of failure on trivial metal/gem combinations too high<br/>\n\tWhat:  With a respectable wisdom of 90ish there are far too many<br/>\nfailures<br/>\n\twith trivial metal/gem combinations.  Failure rates are running 30%<br/>\nto 50%<br/>\n\tworking with trivial items.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tProposal:  Drastically lower the rate of failure for trivial items<br/>\n\t(something less than 10%) or eliminate failures for trivial items<br/>\n\tcompletely.    OR    Leave fail rates where they are but if you fail<br/>\nmaking<br/>\n\ta trivial combination you either get a non-magical item or you don&#39;t<br/>\nlose<br/>\n\tanything and have to reenchant the metal or you just don&#39;t lose<br/>\nanything.<br/>\n\tAgain, these are only for when an item is trivial.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhy:  It makes sense to expect a skill gain with the known chance of<br/>\n\tfailure.  It makes no sense to fail often when there is zero chance<br/>\nof skill<br/>\n\tgain because the item is trivial.  If it IS trivial to make, why<br/>\nwould a<br/>\n\tcraftsman fail so often?  Trivial = easy = no learning = no skill<br/>\ngain = low<br/>\n\tfailures<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat would happen:  Not really changing much except making the game<br/>\nmore<br/>\n\tfun.  There will still be the current rate of failure for<br/>\nnon-trivial skill<br/>\n\tgaining - so we won&#39;t be getting something for nothing.  This will<br/>\nmake<br/>\n\tbusiness more fun and less frustrating.  If there are certain items<br/>\nthat for<br/>\n\tsome reason should never be trivial then you could still fail at<br/>\nthem and<br/>\n\tstill gain experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tthanks,<br/>\n\tShawn<br/>\n\tAzara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\tONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
