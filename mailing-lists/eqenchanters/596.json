I just watch the pet getting slain and another 3 dagger<br/>\n&gt; going lost.. any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Our pets only attack things that attack us first.  Also, they don&#39;t<br/>\nfollow commands.  We have sort of a moving bodyguard that doesn&#39;t listen<br/>\nto advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. In group fighting with possibly more than one mob, i try to tag the<br/>\n&gt; different monsters to cast my really fine enchanter spells, clicking<br/>\n&gt; directly on the chest or head of a monster, and what did i tag? ... my pet,<br/>\n&gt; my partymembers... everything clickable in around the next five miles... but<br/>\n&gt; not the monster i want. F8 always tags my pet.. its quite useless. Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; i loose lots of seconds runnig forth and back or around the battle to get<br/>\n&gt; the mob tagged. The same with 3 orcs running towards us... strategy is<br/>\n&gt; clear, just root, flux or mesmerize to control 2 of them and wait until the<br/>\n&gt; party slain the first... but the run nearly one orc inside the other,<br/>\n&gt; chances to tag them in time to cast...zero. its a stupid handling prob...and<br/>\n&gt; that stupid pet is always in the line of sight. Suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try different views.  I haven&#39;t done it yet, but I&#39;m pretty sure the<br/>\noverhead view would provide an EASY way to mouse-target opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. anyone ever casted a pet in befallen? i am getting mad about that, the<br/>\n&gt; pet is that nervous runnig around me, and is alwas really far from me, and<br/>\n&gt; get into melee with everything that moves. Once i casted 4 pets because<br/>\n&gt; every 2 minutes i realized, oh the pet got lost somewhere i didnt even hear<br/>\n&gt; a taunting attacker... i run around there a lot, from one door to the next,<br/>\n&gt; and most times i dont even see, where my pet is, and where he gets himself<br/>\n&gt; slain this time. suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have.  That was a hairy trip.  Thought I was going to die, and would<br/>\nhave, if not for the intervention of a Troll Shadowknight named Torgo. <br/>\nMade me re-think my opinion of trolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur pets aren&#39;t guaranteed to work well in dungeons, but are better to<br/>\nhave than not have.  Just get used to buying those tiny daggers.  I now<br/>\nhave about 60 I keep in the bank, plus a supply on my person.  Makes<br/>\nvisiting Qeynos a little easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nLotwilla, Fourth Circle Enchantress of the Eldritch Collective<br/>\nE&#39;Ci Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
