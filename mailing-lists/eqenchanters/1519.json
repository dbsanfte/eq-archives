What I ve seen recently<br/>\n&gt; is a strange behavior in some skills. I know that the combat skill is<br/>\n&gt; maxed at (level +1) * 3, and the magic skills at (level+1) * 5. But<br/>\n&gt; what about Offense and Defense ? Those are important, and if you<br/>\n&gt; neglect them you will be very sorry at higher levels. I ve seen the<br/>\n&gt; following from lvl 10 to lvl 13: level 10: Defense 45level 11: Defense<br/>\n&gt; 48level 12: Defense 51level 13: Defense 54 So, these numbers would<br/>\n&gt; indicate a (level+5) * 3 I cant really believe this. Are we really<br/>\n&gt; that weak in defense ? At higher levels every critter will hit us for<br/>\n&gt; max damage. If somebody knows if this is correct, please reply. When<br/>\n&gt; the Mobs have (level+1) * 5 and we have only 3, this would be<br/>\n&gt; dissapointing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\n<br/>\nGet paid up to $.50 an hour to surf the web click below<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alladvantage.com/go.asp?refid=BQI063\">http://www.alladvantage.com/go.asp?refid=BQI063</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
