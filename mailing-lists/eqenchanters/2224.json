See, I used to always use enthrall, but I would<br/>\nadd mes to my list as a back up in case enthrall was resisted, so i didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to wait 5 seconds for a recast. I also used both when fighting tough<br/>\nbattles such as the Ghoul Lord or King. AE mesmerization is reserved for<br/>\ntrains, and weaker mobs. I learned my lesson when I tried to AE mesmerize 5<br/>\nImp Protectors. With everyone resisting and knocking me dead in a little<br/>\nover 1 round (they were all red to me at the time). Instead, when fighting<br/>\nreally tough battle I pick them off 1 at a time, that way if it is resisted<br/>\nI only have to deal with 1 mob attacking me at a time. And with 4 other Imps<br/>\nbeating on my party I need to act quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I have Entrance as my main spell, and Enthrall as a back up, and in 1<br/>\nlevel I will be using Dazzle/Entrance. I can&#39;t wait to use dazzle, because<br/>\nentrance has kept most things entranced for 60+ seconds. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Maelael, 48th Enchanter<br/>\n-Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
