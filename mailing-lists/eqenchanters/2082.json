Killing other people is a very<br/>\nsmall part of EQ; the people on Non-pvp servers almost never have to atk<br/>\nanother person. Hmm...now you can&#39;t use some spells on other people... So<br/>\nwhat? If its very important for you to be able to destroy other real people<br/>\nin combat, there are plenty of other games (like Quake) that let you do<br/>\nthat, and you don&#39;t have to worry about your rocket launcher getting nerfed.<br/>\nI am surprised at how much grief these new changes have caused. After all,<br/>\nyou can still charm NPCs, you can still color flux camps of monsters, you<br/>\ncan still cast fear on that orc. Sure, that big bad ogre warrior might kick<br/>\nyour butt in pvp. But when that warrior is in your group (which he most<br/>\nlikely will be, as opposed to dueling u), he will be praying for your next<br/>\nspell as he watches the monster he is fighting rip him apart. Finally, you<br/>\ncan still pvp. You can still win. Some classes can&#39;t pvp at all. Thus, my<br/>\nfriends, I wish you good hunting and good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:osmosis@...\">osmosis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, November 19, 1999 4:48 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] Latest nerf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Garett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:osmosis@...\">osmosis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In case you hadn&#39;t noticed it yet, we&#39;ve also lost the ability to cast the<br/>\n&gt;color flux/shift/ect line of spells on other players.  hmmm... so that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>makes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;it<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    1.
