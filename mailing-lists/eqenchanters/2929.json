(skill was 201 went up making some jewelry for \n    a friend.) So from 201<br>to 206 how much money do you think I lost? \n    Actually nothing.&nbsp; I made some<br>money, I enchanted every bar and I \n    was making money selling it back to<br>vendor (vendor bought gold ruby rings \n    back for 147pp and some change, cost<br>131p and change 10p and change for \n    the gem and bar respectively) So I made<br>about 5p of each one.&nbsp; I \n    didn&#39;t keep track of 201 to 203 but from 203 to 206<br>I made 240 Gold Ruby \n    Rings selling them all back to the vendor, I think I<br>failed 6 \n    times.&nbsp; While I was making these I would /auction some of the \n    4int<br>2str earrings and 4str 2int earrings.&nbsp; Dont like to mess with \n    plat to order.<br>The only time I do plat is when I loot some Fire Opals and \n    then just try my<br>luck.&nbsp; Anyone else trying to raise it past \n    200?&nbsp; I know Plat malachite is<br>cheaper each attempt but the mana to \n    enchant the bars was killing me ( I<br>tried 20 with no increases). \n    <br><br>Any ideas, Suggestions, or Experiences \n    here?<br><br>Teenimu<br>Enchanter Tunare Server<br>53 Season<br><br>Btw my \n    int was 213 while doing these.<br>And wisdom of below 100 not sure what it \n    was.&nbsp; But I don&#39;t believe in the<br>wisdom theory.
