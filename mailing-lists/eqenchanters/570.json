My Enchanter has a jewelcraft skill of 33 and a Wisdom of about 75+-.  I&#39;ve found that I can make most of the silver jewelry, even the topaz, with more success than failures.  Every once in a while I&#39;ll have a bad luck streak and fail 5 times in a row with something easy like Rose Quartz, but for the most part I have success.  <br/>\n    When you are posting success or failure rates try posting your Wisdom level and skill level so we can compare.<br/>\n<br/>\nFren<br/>\nGnome, Enchanter<br/>\nTunare Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
