First, it cost us<br/>\na LOT of money to get our skills up to where they are, and we should be able<br/>\nto recuperate the training costs in a timely fashion. Second, price the<br/>\nitems based on what they are worth, NOT what it costs you to make them. When<br/>\nyou put a price on your silver amber rings (+2 str), just think about how<br/>\nmuch people are paying for flesh bands that offer the same increase, and not<br/>\nthe fact that it only costs about 3p to make one. If we put too low a price<br/>\non these items, remembering that items do not EVER go away, it won&#39;t be long<br/>\nat all before EVERYONE has all they need and we will be left with a<br/>\nworthless trade skill. Just my 2 coppers...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; --------------------<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Hapke, Matthew&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mahapke@...\">mahapke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mine are close to that, but I was a bit lower on the silver stuff.<br/>\n&gt; plus 2 silver, from 4plat to 6plat each<br/>\n&gt; Jade rings 10plat<br/>\n&gt; electrum jade on my server goes at a steady 20pp. Everyone just sticks<br/>\n&gt; with that.<br/>\n&gt; Also, WIS earings last night were a big seller. I sold about 20 of them,<br/>\n&gt; at aroudn 8 to 10 pp each.

I guess I will open up by stating what I was selling things for<br/>\n&gt; last night, and then all of you can comment as to whether it was too high<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; too low, and we will work from there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tAll +2 silver stat boosters : 7p each or 2 for 13p<br/>\n&gt; \tJade silver rings : 9p each or 2 for 17p<br/>\n&gt; \tJade electrum bracers : 25p each or 2 for 45p<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This being only the 2nd day after the patch, I haven&#39;t tried marketing<br/>\n&gt; much<br/>\n&gt; of the electrum items other than the obvious seller, which is the jade<br/>\n&gt; bracer. With a skill of 79 I still get failures with electrum, and I am<br/>\n&gt; trying to repay the guild for the money they pumped into me to raise my<br/>\n&gt; skill. Please add to this list and comment on prices!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
