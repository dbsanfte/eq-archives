Of course you have to take anything Verant says with a grain of<br/>\n&gt; salt, so you may want to keep your cha high, but in my exp with my low cha<br/>\n&gt; halfling(50 cha) if the charm sticks it can last as long as someone with a<br/>\n&gt; real high cha.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Suttun Fuzziefoot<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 42 druid of Rocent Nife, obsessed with the crack that is clarity<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
