Mesmerize is a great spell for solo or groups.<br/>\nIt basically stuns the creature for up to 30 seconds, allowing you to step<br/>\nback and cast, get away, or in a group scenario, you can mesmerize one or 2<br/>\nof the 3 creatures attacking your group, allowing the others to kill the<br/>\none that remains unstunned. Do note, once u hit it, or cast a DD or DoT<br/>\n(Direct Damage or Damage over Time) spell on it, it&#39;s no longer stunned.<br/>\nLull makes the creatures less aggressive for a VERY short period of time<br/>\n(2-4 seconds). This is useful when wanting to attack a camp of 2 or more<br/>\ncreatures they you couldn&#39;t handle alone or grouped with others. <br/>\nPersonally I didn&#39;t bother with Lull, but soon as I got Soothe (a better<br/>\nLull) my group and I started taking camps we would of normally gotten<br/>\nslaughtered. My routine was, Soothe 2 of the 3 in the camp, while another<br/>\nmagic user would have the 3rd targeted. Once I Soothed the 2 (with out them<br/>\nresisting) I announced go, they would cast on the 3rd pulling it out of the<br/>\ncamp so we could fight it with out the other 2 attacking us all at once.<br/>\nVERY important, Soothe only last 3-7 seconds, giving just enough time to<br/>\nSoothe 2 and pull a 3rd, so do not waste time and make it as fast as you<br/>\ncan else you&#39;ll end up pulling 2 or 3 vs. just 1.<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTelan Ka&#39;Rlaah of Rellos Zeke<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:19 PM 4/20/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Brewhaus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brewhaus@...\">brewhaus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is mesmerize a better Lull spell or is it totally different?
