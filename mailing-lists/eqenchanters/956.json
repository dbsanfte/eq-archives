We will never<br/>\nbe as powerful as a wizard and so if a group is choosing absed on damage<br/>\ndealing capabilities we would lose that battle anyway. No waht I would like<br/>\nis for our whirls to go back to working, for our Memory blur to not be<br/>\nresistable, for our debuffs t actually affect the creature and for them to<br/>\nbe castable on deep reds as well. The thing I would change with our damage<br/>\nspells is Either make the secondary stun effect REAL or remove it. It is the<br/>\ndual effect that causes our resistances to skyrocket supposedly. Personally<br/>\nI would not mind a lesser damage ratio if chaotic feedback actually did its<br/>\njob of stunning. I would alos like it if the Enfeeble line did mor ehten 4<br/>\nextra strength loss at levle 20 over level 4.<br/>\nI stacked these spells on myself and they really made a difference. I was<br/>\nencumbered etc. But mobs don&#39;t get encumbred, and I ahve yet to see any real<br/>\ndamage reduction. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy list:<br/>\n1) Restore Whirl till you hurl to full effectiveness. If you need to make<br/>\nthis spell into a line of spells each of which is useful over a range of<br/>\nlevles then fine but they are our bread and butter spells and should never<br/>\nbe research required and should always have the same mana/stun ratio. If you<br/>\ndouble the mana usage then the stun length had better double too, or the<br/>\nability to be resisted go way down. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) memory Blur should again be irresistable. I cast this on a Dry Bone<br/>\nSKellie alst night that was 4 levels above me to get it to stop killing my<br/>\ntank. Resisted. Tank died, I soon followed. <br/>\n<br/>\n3) Debuffs that matter.  A wizard can cast a single spell and do damage to<br/>\nmultiple creatures. If I want to debuff I have to debuff individually and it<br/>\ncosts A LOT of mana to debuff a single creature to the point where anyone<br/>\nwill notice. Make us some area affect debuffs, or lower the mana<br/>\ncost/refresh time of our debuffs so we can cast on multiple targets in a<br/>\nsingle battle. <br/>\n<br/>\n4) Area Affect Point blank Tashaan, nuff said.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Charm should put an Icon on the screen that we cna cancel just like any<br/>\nother buff thus breaking the control. Since we are required to have Tashan<br/>\nmemorized, and charm basically requires us to memorize and cast invisibility<br/>\nto use as well we are down to 5 spell slots. Making Charm put an icon up<br/>\nwhich we could cancel will give us one extra spell slot and also be<br/>\nbeneficial to the dev teams favortie characters, Druids. <br/>\n<br/>\n6) Item or Place enchantment spells.  How about circles of warding? Resist<br/>\nbonuses? <br/>\n<br/>\n7) Buffs that can extend the length of other classes buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Stackable buffs and debuffs. Why cna necros stack their Dots but ours can&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well, you&#39;ve got my list:<br/>\n&gt;1) Damage spells should at least do some damage when resisted following<br/>\n&gt;similar rules as the wizard spells with a lesser ratio to keep a balance<br/>\n&gt;with the wizards that are a nuke-only class,<br/>\n&gt;2) Our spells should not jump from a 20-30% resistance to a full 100%<br/>\n&gt;resistance ( from reds with one level above yellow to reds with two levels<br/>\n&gt;above yellow ), there should be a nicer ramp so that an enchanter is not<br/>\n&gt;completely useless in a group of 6 people attacking one strong red target.<br/>\n&gt;Skara<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Steve H.
