It was actually one of the few things that made<br/>\nenchanters NOT totally suck (enchanters were a HORRIBLE class the first<br/>\nfew months, they really improved them a lot, but killed a couple of the<br/>\nspells along the way).  They thought it was TOO powerful after 6-8 months,<br/>\nand tuned it down a lot.  As it is now, it is a variable length single<br/>\ntarget stun.  It lasts from about a second to 15 or so.  It is most<br/>\neffective from 16-24ish, but on mobs 24 or higher, it starts to become<br/>\nuseless, and past 27 or so, it&#39;s completely worthless.<br/>\n<br/>\nANY stun breaks it (this includes bashes from your pets, other tanks, etc,<br/>\nas well as stun components of wizard spells (the things that cause an<br/>\ninterrupt) and your own DDs.  The biggest issue is bash, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an upgrade, Drynn&#39;s Dizzying Draught, but this is THE single most<br/>\nuseless spell in an enchanters repetoire.  WTYH is actually more useful<br/>\nthan Drynn&#39;s, even at level 56 (where WTYH is next to useless, but DDD IS<br/>\nuseless, unless you feel you have too much mana and want to waste it<br/>\npointlessly).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll get a better version of WTYH at, what, 55?  Lagarn&#39;s Lamentation,<br/>\nwhich is a single target stun for 8 seconds, just like most other classes<br/>\n(i.e. clerics) stuns.  Until then, you&#39;ll have to make do with your Area<br/>\nEffect stuns at 8, 20, 44, 52, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRoot, however, is still a great spell.  As are many in it&#39;s line... you&#39;ll<br/>\nfind that some of your low level spells stick with you long into your<br/>\nupper levels... I STILL almost always have the 16th level Mesmerization<br/>\nmemorized (the AE mez), at level 56, as well as the level 20 AE stun.<br/>\n<br/>\nLower level spells don&#39;t necessarily become obsolete, in some cases they<br/>\nare much better than their higher level equivalents.  Root is great,<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s very low mana and resists less at higher levels than the root<br/>\nupgrades... I always use either Root or Immobilize... Root for the low<br/>\ncasting cost and resists, immobilize for the low casting time.  The ONLY<br/>\nbenefit that I&#39;ve seen from higher level roots is they have less chance to<br/>\nbreak when DD spells hit the creature.  They don&#39;t seem to last longer (in<br/>\nfact, my root usually lasts longer than high level root spells), though<br/>\nsome of the higher ones technically have a slightly longer maximum length,<br/>\nbecause of the greater chance of resists on the higher level ones, they<br/>\nbreak more easily, and rarely reach their maximums, while the low level<br/>\nones usually do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe low level stuns are good because they cast faster, cost less, resist<br/>\nless, and have a smaller radius from you... there are times when a larger<br/>\nradius AE stun is good, but overall, that just means more chance of<br/>\nattracting attention you wouldn&#39;t have had otherwise... it&#39;s better to<br/>\njust learn better placement with a smaller radius.  If I&#39;m chain stunning,<br/>\nI&#39;ll load my lvl 20 and lvl 44 AE stuns (and if I really want to be sure,<br/>\nthe lvl 8 one as well, to fill in the gap).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut remember, overall, lower level spells get resisted less than higher<br/>\nlevel spells (cast by the same caster...  obviously, a lvl 12 enchanter<br/>\ncasting the lowest root spell will be resisted more than a lvl 60<br/>\nenchanter casting the lowest level root spell).  They usually cast faster,<br/>\nand often the difference in effect from the lower lvl spell to the higher<br/>\nlevel spell isn&#39;t enough to warrant the costs in mana, time, and resists.<br/>\nIt is all situational, there are times you&#39;ll want the high ones memmed,<br/>\nthere are times you&#39;ll want the low ones memmed... I did SO much spell<br/>\njuggling... I became a master at AE stunning, sitting down quickly,<br/>\ndropping out a spell, memming the spell I need, standing, backing a<br/>\nlittle, and trying to cast it before the stun broke.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanters are one of the more interesting classes, I think... there are<br/>\nSO many ways to do things, and to handle the same situation... you kind of<br/>\ncreate your own style as you go, and in the end, very few enchanters ever<br/>\nreact the same to an identical situation.  You do, however, have to be<br/>\nunafraid of death.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJM - Saidan/Eltanin/Aipex Soulblade<br/>\n40/56/12 Paladin/Enchanter/Bard<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n-= recovering EQ addict =-<br/>\n(I&#39;m on step 11!!!!  :)  now, will someone go ahead and start a Dark Age<br/>\nof Camelot recovery support group?
