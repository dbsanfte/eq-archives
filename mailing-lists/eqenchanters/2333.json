Some of these<br/>\n&gt; questions are probably asked often, so if there&#39;s a FAQ or other source<br/>\n&gt; that answers them, please feel free to point me there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Is there any armor available that gives the look of plate, chain, or at<br/>\n&gt; least leather?  I&#39;d like to be a little less naked when taking the form of<br/>\n&gt; a class that doesn&#39;t have robe graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Afraid I don&#39;t know this one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Do any of the illusions provide racial abilities (wood elf forage, dark<br/>\n&gt; elf hide, etc. in addition to sight improvements?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The large racial illusions give you the bash ability and the troll illusion<br/>\nincreases HP regeneration, but not much beyone that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) How does Alliance work?  Does it always raise one faction level (e.g.<br/>\n&gt; dubious to apprehensive)?  Does it decrease faction with negative faction<br/>\n&gt; groups (e.g. if I cast it on a deathfist orc, will it make me less liked<br/>\n&gt; by the commons residents)?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Basically, Alliance and Benevolance will increase your faction by a definate<br/>\namount with the faction group of the NPC targeted.  The facion increase may<br/>\nor may not be enough to raise it a level, though in most cases it is, unless<br/>\nyou&#39;re trying to increase a scowls faction.  It has no effect on any other<br/>\nfaction, and lasts until you zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) At what level can I go into the evil cities?  My gnome necro can go<br/>\n&gt; into Neriak - can my agnostic enchanter go there in gnome form?  Can I go<br/>\n&gt; into Grobb or Oggok in dark elf form, or must I wait for ogre/troll form?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I play an agnostic gnome enchanter, and he can enter Neriak without any<br/>\nillusions (though most NPC don&#39;t really like me a whole lot).  I&#39;m KoS in<br/>\nboth Grobb and Oggok.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks for any advice to a newbie illusionist.<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Mark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;   !G<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hope this helps<br/>\nTinik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
