When they are offline I cannot findany<br/>\ngroups to play so I am stuck attempting to solo which is incredibly slow and<br/>\ndangerous too.  This is the Second Wave of friends that has out leveled me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;DeGirolami, Franck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:degirolami@...\">degirolami@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I had a level 16 dark elf necro that I started on the first day of the<br/>\n&gt;release. It took me 4 &#39;played&#39; days and a half to get it to level 16. then I<br/>\n&gt;gave it up. I have now a level 16 enchanter. It took me 12 &#39;played&#39; days to<br/>\n&gt;make it to 16... You think that&#39;s a problem for me? I had so much more fun<br/>\n&gt;playing an enchanter. What&#39;s the deal with this level race? Sometimes I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;spend an hour travelling back and forth just to say hi to a friend I havent<br/>\n&gt;seen for a long time. Right now, I&#39;m hunting in CrushBone and I barely make<br/>\n&gt;any xp where I could be soloing in Lavastorm and make a shit load of xp and<br/>\n&gt;money..but what&#39;s the big deal? I enjoy playing Everquest a lot more now.<br/>\n&gt;Powergaming is so boring. So are those people who start a race everytime  a<br/>\n&gt;new server comes up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;my 2 cents,<br/>\n&gt;Skara<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Are you?
