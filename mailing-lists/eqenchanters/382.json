I<br/>\nhave not gone to the dark elf city because of this, because if i change back<br/>\ninto a high elf between zones in the middle of the dark elf city, i know i<br/>\nwill not be getting my body back?<br/>\nany suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Aeramus from Bristlebane server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for a new hobby?
