If you have a poor charisma in a high level dungeon (Lguk) you will be almost useless to a party when the inevitable train comes your way or a too big pull. I love the feeling I get when I hear my party members say &quot;God I love Enchanters!&quot; after I mezz a &#39;too big&#39; pull.<br/>\n My Charisma is currently 197 and my Intelligence is a comfortably in the 170&#39;s. I have a set of equiptment that I can switch to when charisma isn&#39;t as important, Meaning I have Mezz mode and Int mode gear. =P<br/>\n<br/>\nZealott Enrapture<br/>\n40th lvl Enchantress, Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
