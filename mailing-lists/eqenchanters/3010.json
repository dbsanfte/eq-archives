The <br/>\ntaunt<br/>\n&gt; factor I haven&#39;t really had a problem with.I&#39;ve always used rune&#39;s <br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; initial breaks of an area.  If needed in battle, don&#39;t chain cast it <br/>\nas your<br/>\n&gt; targets health starts to fall, wait till they are under half. By the <br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; the spell goes off, they will be at 2 bubbles and the mob will be <br/>\nfrenzied<br/>\n&gt; on them. At that point, the cleric&#39;s (you do have a cleric with you, <br/>\nright?<br/>\n&gt; if not, don&#39;t even think about fighting level 50+ critters) CH <br/>\nshould be<br/>\n&gt; flying through the air. If the cleric says &#39;OOM&#39;, is dead, or is LD, <br/>\nthen<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re stuck with rune to keep someone alive. I used 8 Rune IV&#39;s to <br/>\nkeep a<br/>\n&gt; ranger alive in hate once. Critter never turned on me once. About to <br/>\nhit 52<br/>\n&gt; and get Rune V, can hardly wait. I usually carry 80 peridots on me <br/>\nand end<br/>\n&gt; up giving a stack of 20 to a cleric sometime on any raid I&#39;m on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lozi ~Hand of Chaos~, CT<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
