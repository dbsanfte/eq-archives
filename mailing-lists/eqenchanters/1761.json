I have a respectable<br/>\nwisdom of 90 something and a skill level of 40 something (been playing other<br/>\ncharacters so haven&#39;t leveled beyond 8 for a long... time) but I fail SO<br/>\nOFTEN with onyx and lower.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a relationship with difficulty of attempt (even when trivial) and<br/>\nthe rate of failure?  In other words, will I continue to fail the same rate<br/>\non average with a particular trivial combination even after raising my skill<br/>\nlevel by working on harder combinations first?  I think there&#39;s no<br/>\nimprovement to the failure rate on combinations that are pretty easy like<br/>\nsilver/onyx even as I improved my skill in the recent past.  With that in<br/>\nmind, I don&#39;t know if I should work with unenchanted electrum and malachite<br/>\nto improve my skill level if the rate of trivial failures remains constant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any info or advice you might have.  If this is something you<br/>\ncould ask someone or even better if there&#39;s a petition or list of<br/>\nsuggestions I would request one of the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: Rate of failure on trivial metal/gem combinations too high<br/>\nWhat:  With a respectable wisdom of 90ish there are far too many failures<br/>\nwith trivial metal/gem combinations.  Failure rates are running 30% to 50%<br/>\nworking with trivial items.<br/>\n<br/>\nProposal:  Drastically lower the rate of failure for trivial items<br/>\n(something less than 10%) or eliminate failures for trivial items<br/>\ncompletely.    OR    Leave fail rates where they are but if you fail making<br/>\na trivial combination you either get a non-magical item or you don&#39;t lose<br/>\nanything and have to reenchant the metal or you just don&#39;t lose anything.<br/>\nAgain, these are only for when an item is trivial.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy:  It makes sense to expect a skill gain with the known chance of<br/>\nfailure.  It makes no sense to fail often when there is zero chance of skill<br/>\ngain because the item is trivial.  If it IS trivial to make, why would a<br/>\ncraftsman fail so often?  Trivial = easy = no learning = no skill gain = low<br/>\nfailures<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would happen:  Not really changing much except making the game more<br/>\nfun.  There will still be the current rate of failure for non-trivial skill<br/>\ngaining - so we won&#39;t be getting something for nothing.  This will make<br/>\nbusiness more fun and less frustrating.  If there are certain items that for<br/>\nsome reason should never be trivial then you could still fail at them and<br/>\nstill gain experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\nShawn<br/>\nAzara, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
