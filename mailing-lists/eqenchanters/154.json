Neither have any &#39;inside&#39; information that<br/>\nguarantees that all information contained therein is accurate.  For example,<br/>\nI would recommend reading EQVault&#39;s guide to jewelcraft.  It is one of the<br/>\nremarkably worst pieces of prose I&#39;ve ever had the privelidge to read.  It<br/>\nmake Hubbard&#39;s Battlefield Earth look like Ulysses.  ;)  Now, I&#39;m not saying<br/>\nthat charisma necessarily affects resists in any way shape or form, I dont<br/>\nhave any data on the matter (and I&#39;ve been playing eq since the begining of<br/>\nphase 3).  If some people are experiencing a great deal fewer resists, it&#39;s<br/>\nentirely possible that there&#39;s an undocumented chr effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nJude Morrigan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
