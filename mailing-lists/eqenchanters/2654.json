I&#39;ve been working on faction in Cabilis.. as it was, I could not enter<br/>\nat all before... I&#39;m human, and follow the ways of Mithaniel Marr (which made<br/>\nthe basis of my decision of servers, I might add :) , when I started my first<br/>\ncharacter, my paladin, who also follows mith marr).<br/>\n<br/>\nTroopers and Crusaders were RtA.  Iksar illusion and Benevolance brought either/or<br/>\nup the Threateningly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I started hunting out outcast iksar in the Field of Bone.. I found that<br/>\nthey gave LegionOfCabilis faction (wasn&#39;t sure what that was, think now that<br/>\nit&#39;s the trooper guards?), and BroodOfSomething faction (I think this is Sarnaks?),<br/>\nbut lost faction with TheForsaken... I wasn&#39;t too worried about this, as I asked<br/>\nand was told it was just the iksar outcast (Marauders, manslayers, etc) faction...<br/>\nbut I have heard a few times recently that people believed it was the SK or<br/>\nnecro faction in Cabilis... OUCH.  I&#39;m just HOPING this isn&#39;t the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, now I have troopers at threateningly with iksar illusion, and dubious with<br/>\nbenevolance... but the crusaders, hierophants, and the banker of course, are<br/>\nall RtA.  I can benevolance them, and I can still get it to threateningly (which<br/>\nleads me to believe that TheForsaken is NOT their faction, but that&#39;s not conclusive),<br/>\nbut then I&#39;m threateningly with both troopers and crusaders... maybe with all<br/>\nthe other residents, not sure.  I think I&#39;m dubious with the standard resident<br/>\nwith benevolance on a trooper, but didn&#39;t test it with benevolance on a crusader.<br/>\n So, in theory, as long as I kept moving fast, if everything was threateningly,<br/>\nI could go through the city safely, as long as I didn&#39;t get TOO close to anything,<br/>\nor stay near them long.  But, I&#39;m not going to try that.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, anyone have any more definitive info on this?  Also, the banker is RtA,<br/>\nbut way green at 50.  Can I still bank with him, assuming he or someone near<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t attack me?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s enough babble from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJM - Saidan/Eltanin/Aipex Soulblade<br/>\nPaladin/Enchanter/Bard 35/50/10</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
