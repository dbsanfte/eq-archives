I highly recommend you be careful selling and crafting<br/>\n&gt; items.  Magical items crafted under the new patch WILL vanish if you enter<br/>\n&gt; certain zones.  Qnos is one of these areas, I have no doubt there are<br/>\n&gt; others.  Craft at your own risk, and I do advise you notify everyone you<br/>\n&gt; sell to to be careful where they go.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; this is disturbing news, and perhaps a flaw? or not true, has anyone<br/>\n&gt; experienced this problem? or know anything about it?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; -Aeramus 16th Enchanter on Bristlebane </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
