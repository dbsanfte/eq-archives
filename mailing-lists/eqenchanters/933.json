As long as the spell was not resisted (and it was resisted at the same fairly high","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2000009969\">Whirl til you hurl used to be a reliable, 15 seconds of monster stunning.<br/>\nAs long as the spell was not resisted (and it was resisted at the same<br/>\nfairly high rate of most of our spells) it was 99% reliable.  Some things<br/>\nsuch as certain bard songs could break it.  This made an enchanter of great<br/>\nvalue to a group.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow however, assuming you get past the resist<br/>\n1.  Any stun breaks whirl (including bashes from warriors)<br/>\n2.  Any of the Chaotic Feedback line of spells break whirl.<br/>\n3.  Any hit as a 1 in (either 12 or 20 I suspect 12) chance to break whirl<br/>\n4.  Mob gets a saving throw every tick or so (6seconds) to break whirl<br/>\n5.  Level limits on how high of monster you can whirl.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow, add this up, and you get whirl being essentially a higher mana, no AE<br/>\ncolor flux, as its duration is now close to 2-5 seconds.  It goes from being<br/>\nthe best L12 spell to being essentially worthless.  Admittedly, it is<br/>\noverpowering at higher levels, but that could have been fixed by the level<br/>\nlimits alone.  This from a class which is the hardest in the game to level,<br/>\nfewest in number, and now least useful in a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mushin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mushin@...\">mushin@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 20, 1999 10:31 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Enchanter Update?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that they havemad changes to the Enchanter Class but What exactly<br/>\nhave they changed.

I have no<br/>\nproblem protesting if I believe the change was not for good. I would really<br/>\nappreciate a run down on what they have changed.
