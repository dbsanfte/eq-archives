They are also a<br/>\nquest item... a favored item for Trolls.  The quest requires the happy love<br/>\nbracers from ratraz and the head of guard lumpkin from the Ogre/troll<br/>\nforeign quarter of Neriak.  Other guard will help lumpkin, so let him wander<br/>\ndeep into the empty buildings/tunnel behind the neon screen.  Ratraz also<br/>\ndrops a head on occasion, this one does not work...must be lumpkin&#39;s head.<br/>\nTake the bracers and the head to Hukulk in the Grobb Shadowknight guild.<br/>\nYou need excellent faction with the nightkeep and may have to do his other<br/>\nlower quests first.  ( My advice is to bring lots of bone chips... you get<br/>\nfaction and a rusty 2 handed sword that will pay off the cost of the<br/>\nchips... also killing the spore guardian in Innothule nets you a 2 dex, 2<br/>\nint mask usable by any evil race, really nice for a lower level DE Necro,<br/>\n100pp in Oasis.)  finally,  after all this, you get the Helm of Hukulk, a<br/>\nstrength and stamina increasing helm, steel plate look, and usable by those<br/>\nlovable trolls.  You will be able to sell this in Innothule for a small<br/>\nprofit considering the time involved... but the risk of ILL: Troll wearing<br/>\noff and the potential of failure ( conflicting reports... some enchanters<br/>\nclaim to have never been able to get the helm, no matter what) means that<br/>\nthis quest might be best suited to leaving to the Trolls... we do not have<br/>\nto do EVERY quest.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
