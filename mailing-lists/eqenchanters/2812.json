I too stuggled at that lvl but here is what I finally <br/>\ndecided.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe enchanters love variety and dont like to actually level, but there <br/>\nare times in our lives we must group in a xp farm type environment to <br/>\nforce us to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me that was high keep.  I sat in guard room and other rooms off <br/>\nand on for days.  Literally.  I found it was basically bub every 4 <br/>\nhours.  I know that sound mind bending painful boring, but you need <br/>\nto advance at times and being in group where you dont die is the <br/>\nanswer sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDont kill ogres if you have done or plan to do the stien of mogguk <br/>\nquest for self or others and definately dont kill treants, bad karma <br/>\nfriend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my advise is this, recognize why you dont level is disdain <br/>\nfor boredom, after all we have gazzillon spells and things we can do -<br/>\n- how on earth do you expect us just to breeze and slow and tash <br/>\nstuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW advice, dont use your evocation DDs, they are not useful for us <br/>\nin groups and should not be used at all.  Other classes are much more <br/>\neffective at dealing damage, mana and otherwise.  Keep in mind we are <br/>\nnot damage dealers but crowd control.<br/>\n<br/>\nColor flux, stun etc are great.. mez here enthral there.. no no no <br/>\ncharms yet.... slow sit med.. <br/>\n<br/>\nRelax realize by doing less and controling the crowd you doing the <br/>\njob you will till you are 60, good time to practice, dont <br/>\nunderestimate the value of the tasks you do do well, cuz nobody is <br/>\nyour match in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Jouleblu Diamond<br/>\n<br/>\n    Knights of Loyalty<br/>\n<br/>\n         52nd Enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n             Cazic-Thule Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
