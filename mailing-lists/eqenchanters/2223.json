As<br/>\n&gt; Personally I dont enjoy jumping around and running from MOB&#39;s.  I do let<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; pet tank, against Blues. Who hit for around 50 points.  (ouch!)<br/>\n&gt; I am lvl 29. And my 29th Animation (w/ his 2 daggers) and Augmentation,<br/>\n&gt; Obscure, Stregnthen. Really kick&#39;s some ass.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am killing the Intown Bards. (Woah big time faction loss) To get to 30.<br/>\nMy<br/>\n&gt; Rotation is as follows.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tashan/Root/Languid Pace/Suffocate/Sanity Warp/Suffocate/Sanity warp.  At<br/>\n&gt; this point he&#39;s nearly dead.. and I either Melee him and try to get the<br/>\nlast<br/>\n&gt; stroke in, or just DD him again.  But usually i&#39;m at about 40% manna when<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;m done, and nearly full health.  I&#39;ve check&#39;d my pets health after the<br/>\n&gt; battle, he&#39;s usualy just a tad below half life. I have lost a pet in doing<br/>\n&gt; this, but I also was resisted on nearly every spell... *shivers*  That<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t fun.  BUT, I did use nearly the same strategy against the Hermit in<br/>\n&gt; S. Karana. from lvl 22-27. Work&#39;d perfect, Never lost a pet. And I didnt<br/>\ndie<br/>\n&gt; during ALL those levels.  *smiles* Gotta love that lil bonus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Countt<br/>\n&gt; Erolissi Marr  29th Enchanter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Eventually, all enchanters find out that their pet can&#39;t tank. I have<br/>\n&gt; developed a strategy which will prolong the life of our beloved pets and<br/>\n&gt; make our use of mana more efficient. However, this will only work if the<br/>\nmob<br/>\n&gt; you are soloing is not one of those &quot;cons blue but hits like a red&quot; types.<br/>\n&gt; First, u tashan, then you do your Dot. Then, u wait for the pet to have<br/>\nhalf<br/>\n&gt; hp, and then cast the big dd spell. This will draw the mob toward you.<br/>\nHere<br/>\n&gt; is the most important part. You must begin running in a circle, hitting<br/>\njump<br/>\n&gt; every once in a while. The mob will chase u and hit u less then it woud if<br/>\nu<br/>\n&gt; were standing in one place. While this is going on, your pet is getting<br/>\nfree<br/>\n&gt; hits on the mob and should quickly finish it. Note: as much as you&#39;d want<br/>\n&gt; to, do NOT use debuffs other than tashan. You must cast your 3 spells<br/>\n&gt; quickly, before the pet gets so low on hp that the mob will finish it.<br/>\nOnce<br/>\n&gt; again, this will only work if the mob you are fighting is blue. You must<br/>\n&gt; have an open area to work with, I&#39;d say at least 15ft radius. I am<br/>\ncurrently<br/>\n&gt; using this one in Lavastorm and its very mana efficient.  Good luck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Shawn Alley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ShawnA@...\">ShawnA@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, December 02, 1999 4:54 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqenchanters] Charmed creatures<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;From: Shawn Alley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ShawnA@...\">ShawnA@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;Oasis is great for orcs grouped and crocs solo<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;So Ro would be good for the derv camps and drybones<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;West Commons is good.
