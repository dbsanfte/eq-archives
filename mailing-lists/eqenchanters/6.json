Seems like they<br/>\nare getting really expensive. Anyone else worried about having enough cash<br/>\nto buy those spells? I also have  a level 11 monk named Doorn. I can make<br/>\npretty good money with him in BlackBurrow but don&#39;t have anything to spend<br/>\nit on, yet. Looking at the price of those next rank spells seems to me that<br/>\nit might take a while to get them all. I don&#39;t think I could even do it with<br/>\nmy monk at some of those higher rank spells.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Briles &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:briles@...\">briles@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 18, 1999 9:18 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Re: Well met good friend enchanters!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Briles&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:briles@...\">briles@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good thing the illusion spell doesn&#39;t use much mana because they dont last<br/>\n&gt; long.
