Our Level 1 DD spell (and every DoT spell) is an Alteration<br/>\nspell. Every DD spell afer 1st level except the AE DD spell at 39th level is<br/>\nEvocation. Why the change? By this I mean why did it go from an Alteration<br/>\nspell at 1st to an Evocation spell up until level 39 where it becomes an<br/>\nAlteration spell, and then back to an Evocation spell?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell the reason that the level 1 spell is Alt is that it is not a DD spell<br/>\nit is the first of the Dot spells.  Try it on yourself it does the first<br/>\ndamage then about 20 more after that.  The first Evoc spell / DD spell is<br/>\nat level 8.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, why do we skip an upgrade to the 12th level DoT at 20th level? This is<br/>\nthe only level that this happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not the only level that this happens when you hit 29 get use to<br/>\nyour DOT since it the last one you get till you hit 49.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKryten Emohawk <br/>\n<br/>\n49 Enchanter E&#39;CI</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
