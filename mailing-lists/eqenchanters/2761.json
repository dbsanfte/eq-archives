I believe that at level 39 they gain double<br/>\nattack.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne question that I have, that probably cant be answered, is : Why is it<br/>\nthat I can summon a pet, who appears with sword and shield in hand, and give<br/>\nit a single dagger... causing it to dual wield daggers?  Where is it getting<br/>\nthe second dagger from?  I&#39;ve also seen some pets that are dual wielding 2H<br/>\nweapons (hang around a spectre killing group with pets and you&#39;ll likely see<br/>\nthis happen...) This includes enchanter pets... I&#39;ve personally had a pet<br/>\nthat was two floating scythes.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven after the pet-nerf, I still enjoy using my pet to solo @ level 45.<br/>\nAlthough its more exciting to use the charm methods to fight solo, there is<br/>\nsomething to be said for having a pet that you know will never turn on you.<br/>\nI&#39;d also like to point out to the younger enchanters out there that if you<br/>\nsummon a pet, for goodenss sakes use every buff you possibly can on them<br/>\n(shade line, speed + line, strengthen, feedback)... and if you have a cleric<br/>\nin your group be sure that he/she buffs it as though it were any other tank.<br/>\nOur pets have minimal hit points but other than that fact are efficient<br/>\nlittle slice and dicers.  I would also like to point out that the entire<br/>\nreason for the pet nerf a few months back was because our pets were FAR<br/>\ntougher than any other pet at high levels (when properly prepared with low<br/>\ndelay weapons and &#39;swift like the wind&#39;).... imagine how cheated the mages<br/>\nfelt!<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg - RZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Nilen23@...\">Nilen23@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 25, 2000 5:15 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] Enchanter Pets need weapons?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; On one post I read on an enchanter board before it said that enchanter<br/>\npets<br/>\n&gt; can duel wield<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Shop online together.
