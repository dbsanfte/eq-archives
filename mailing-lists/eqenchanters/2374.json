The power of an enchanter doesn&#39;t really shine<br/>\nuntil later levels, tho they do quite nicely at earlier levels. What I mean<br/>\nby that is people can party for a long time and take other classes or an<br/>\nenchanter, it may not matter much to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut major runs at high levels, you end up hearing this &quot;our enchanters are<br/>\nnot online, so we wont be able to go to the planes&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, our class is just like clerics. You cannot do planes, dragons,<br/>\nphinigel, well at all without your enchanters.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I would suggest grouping, because understanding how to be most effective<br/>\nin a group is important in these later levels when your group has 24 people.<br/>\nSolo at higher levels... take on full rooms of blue mobs, take on live<br/>\ntower, the ghoul sage or magi, etc solo when you are 50...because you will<br/>\nbe one of the few classes that actually can.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaelael, 50th Enchanter, Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
