In<br/>\nthis way the group is learning some of my special languages.  Make sure<br/>\nto switch back to common when finished!  You don&#39;t want to be calling<br/>\nfor help or announcing a train and have your group see &quot;safsa fga the<br/>\ntrxzn&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShawn<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout Spell Research <br/>\nThe Arch Magi himself, Verant&#39;s Geoffrey Zatkin, sent me an email<br/>\ndescribing the little known trade skill of Spell Research. Here&#39;s what<br/>\nhe had to say: <br/>\n\tSpell Research is a trade skill, similar in theory to tailoring<br/>\nand cooking. Specific items are inserted in to a container, combining to<br/>\nproduce a new item. <br/>\n\tAll magi begin researching spells at level 16. To do spell<br/>\nresearch, you will need a Tome specific to your class - these can be<br/>\npurchased in your guild hall. <br/>\n*\tWizards use a Lexicon<br/>\n*\tMages use an Elemental Grimoire<br/>\n*\tEnchanters use a Tome of Endless Enchantments<br/>\n*\tNecromancers use a Book of Dark Bindings <br/>\n\tResearch instruction books can also be purchased in your guild<br/>\nhall. All instruction books are written in languages other than common.<br/>\nTo learn the fundamentals of a language, you must train one point in the<br/>\nlanguage with your guild master. Once you have learned the fundamentals,<br/>\nyou will be able to advance your linguistic skills through use - usually<br/>\nby listening to someone speak in that language. <br/>\n\tResearch instruction books will list the components needed to<br/>\nproduce a scroll. Spell components can be found scattered throughout the<br/>\nworld - they appear randomly on different creatures, so you will not<br/>\nhave to &#39;camp&#39; a spot to get a certain component. Components can be<br/>\nstored and traded - ask around - 13 of the 14 classes out there will not<br/>\nbe able to use the research component that you need. <br/>\n\tResearch components are usually found on intelligent creatures,<br/>\nor on creatures that are innately magical.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
