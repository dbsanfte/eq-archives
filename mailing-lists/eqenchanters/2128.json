They can&#39;t take much damage so you need<br/>\nto watch them closely.  One of the best things about being an Enchanter is<br/>\nthat you have many options.  This is one such option at level 4:<br/>\n<br/>\nStart with Tashan from a distance and follow ASAP with Suffocating Sphere<br/>\nbefore the critter reaches you (you can usually get both spells off if you<br/>\nare far enough away).    The critter should be on you and your animation on<br/>\nthe critter, so back off a bit and let your pet tank.  Next debuf the<br/>\ncritter futher with Enfeeblement (this strength debuf along with the DOT<br/>\nstrength debuf will lower the average total damage the critter will do).<br/>\nNow just wait (med if you want to) and watch your animation&#39;s health... tank<br/>\nfor it when needed.  When the critter is  almost dead cast your DOT again to<br/>\nfinish it off (or if your Evocation is high enough use your DD).  I&#39;m making<br/>\nthe assumtion you&#39;ve already buffed yourself and your Animation before this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option in a safe area is to follow the same line except cast fear<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re done debuffing... the pet will follow and hit the critter while<br/>\nit&#39;s running away.  Rinse and repeat until dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany more strategies can be found at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRizzin Diamoure<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
