I tried using this <br/>\ntechnique (level 15 at the time) and just died a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have a new enchanter who just made level 16 and I&#39;d like to try <br/>\nagain, but I think I need to understand more details of the <br/>\ntechnique.  As I recall....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFind a mob to charm, with another of similar level not to far away.  <br/>\nStand as far back as you can and cast Tashan.  At this point do I <br/>\nback up while waiting for the gems to refresh?  Then cast charm on <br/>\nthe approaching mob.  Find the other mob, and tell the charmed pet to <br/>\nattack it.  Should I cast something on the other mob now, to give my <br/>\npet a little advantage?  Perhaps choke? Sit back and med (but then I <br/>\ncan&#39;t tell the health of either).  After charmed mob beats up other <br/>\nmob, tell it to guard here and back off.  When charm breaks kill it - <br/>\nbut what should I use to kill it?  What do I do if charm wears off <br/>\nearly and both mobs come after me.  Recharm?  This is what usually <br/>\nresulted in my death before.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll help greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nShaepe, 16 high elf enchanter<br/>\nTholuxe Paells</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
