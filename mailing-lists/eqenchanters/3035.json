If I were you I would suggest going to Unrest behind the<br/>\nhouse.  Never hunt in front of the house too many trains.  The back side of<br/>\nthe house is good place for your lvl and you can solo there too until you<br/>\ncan get a group.  Learn your spells and what they actually do.  You will be<br/>\none step ahead of everyone else anyways because,  at least on my server,<br/>\nmost enchanters are power leveled up these days and that&#39;s one class if you<br/>\ndont know what you are doing you cant fake it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n55 Enchanter<br/>\nTunare Server<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Casparian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:casp@...\">casp@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 22, 2001 5:01 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@yahoogroups.com\">eqenchanters@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] Digest Number 374<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:47 22/06/01, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gucomics.everlore.com/strip/gu_06222001.jpg\">http://gucomics.everlore.com/strip/gu_06222001.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hehehehe<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all, i&#39;ve not introduced myself... just joined this list last week and <br/>\nas there haven&#39;t been any posts.. well, that&#39;s my reason for not doing it <br/>\nbefore now :o)<br/>\nI&#39;ve only just started playing EQ in the last few weeks, i&#39;m a Gnome <br/>\nEnchantress on The Rathe server.<br/>\nDoing pretty well, I&#39;m lvl 14 now and a large loan from a friend has <br/>\nensured that I&#39;ve been able to get almost all my spells and lots of decent <br/>\nkit :o)<br/>\nAnyway, so far I&#39;ve played... in North Freeport for the first few lvl&#39;s, <br/>\nMisty Thicket up till 7 or 8, then West Commons up until now, killing <br/>\nDervs.  I&#39;ve pretty much stopped getting exp from killing them now (in <br/>\ngroups of 6 usually), so have been dumped in Oasis... but so far everything <br/>\niv&#39;e come across is green or red :o(<br/>\nDoes anyone have any tips for the best place to be located at this <br/>\nlvl?
