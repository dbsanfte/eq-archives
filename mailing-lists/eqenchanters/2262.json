And Im sure<br/>\n&gt; many other high level enchanters would agree with<br/>\n&gt; me. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; True, some people say conjuration may be good with<br/>\n&gt; mes and all, but honestly<br/>\n&gt; that is our cheapest line of spells. If you really<br/>\n&gt; want to be a good<br/>\n&gt; enchanter specialize in alteration, at higher levels<br/>\n&gt; youll be casting so<br/>\n&gt; many alteration spells youll be happy for the<br/>\n&gt; slightly lower mana cost. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ive had to cast clarity and celerity on over 2<br/>\n&gt; parties worth of people, and<br/>\n&gt; Its hard to keep that demand up, and when I get<br/>\n&gt; swift like wind it will be<br/>\n&gt; worse. I try to reserve all my casting to my<br/>\n&gt; specialization skill, (slow,<br/>\n&gt; and if i need to do dmg i use my dots since they are<br/>\n&gt; alteration) In kedge<br/>\n&gt; you will learn that the enchanter needs to cast<br/>\n&gt; augmentation on EVERYONE,<br/>\n&gt; and last week i had 18 ppl to augment. The extra<br/>\n&gt; mana you save on 2 personal<br/>\n&gt; buffs is at least minorly helpful (cha/agi). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There was a time when I laughed at other casters<br/>\n&gt; because everytime they were<br/>\n&gt; oom, i still had over 50-60, but since weve been<br/>\n&gt; hitting giants, imps,<br/>\n&gt; kedge, (and very soon the planes), i have always<br/>\n&gt; been the lowest mana<br/>\n&gt; because of the buffs (and I always drain my mana on<br/>\n&gt; buffing because it is<br/>\n&gt; well worth the cost)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So specialize alteration, youll be happy you did<br/>\n&gt; when you are able to cast<br/>\n&gt; 2400 mana worth of buffs on only 1900.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Maelael 48 Enchanter, Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\n------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFozzle Brainbender<br/>\nSpirit of the Moon<br/>\nEnchanter, Jeweler, Short guy<br/>\nPuppy of Tinina<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
