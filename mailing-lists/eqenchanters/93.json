So basically, this spell *IS*<br/>\nworthless. It DOES work (i.e. you see it say &quot;so-and-so seems more<br/>\nfriendly,&quot; but it&#39;s effect is so minimal to non-existent that it is just not<br/>\nworth the money. I have never seen a change in price. I guess if you were on<br/>\nthe cusp of a faction change, it might put you over by that last single<br/>\n&quot;point&quot; of faction that is needed, but in practice this is pointless. Don&#39;t<br/>\nwaste the money.<br/>\n<br/>\nDjar Lightbringer, Chancellor of HOA (Tarew Marr Server)<br/>\nServant of Light, Deliverer of the Truth to Norrath<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hoa-rpg.com/\">http://www.hoa-rpg.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Magik [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aarongb@...\">aarongb@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 20, 1999 8:55 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] Re: Alliance<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Magik&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aarongb@...\">aarongb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BUY ALL YOUR SPELLS EVENTUALLY!!!!&gt;......<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;             This is not UO.....they will be worthy of their<br/>\n&gt; design.....sooner or later......<br/>\n&gt;      and as with Alliance.......EVERY LITTLE BIT<br/>\n&gt; HELPS!!!!......period.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dymond<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that ONElist hosts some of the largest lists on the Internet?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Our scaleable system is the most reliable free e-mail service on<br/>\n&gt; the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
