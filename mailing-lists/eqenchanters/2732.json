Im sure criticizing the intelligence of others<br/>\nwill ensure that they never hit &quot;reply to all&quot; by accident again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd obviously you did not play the game when it game out. Who would wear a<br/>\nThaumaturgist Robe? I would have because it was better than my Senior Yellow<br/>\nApprentice robe, which I was very proud of btw, one of the few dark elves<br/>\nthat actually went to Erudin to get one (they were in Akanon as well, but<br/>\nGnomes were few and far between on the mainland) I wore that yellow robe to<br/>\nlevel 29 when I finally got my Gossimer robe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are still friends of mine that are just beginning eq, who Im sure<br/>\nwould love to wear a Thaumaturgists robe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaelael<br/>\n53 Enchanter<br/>\nSaryrn<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now  I understand that when reading your postings in Digest format, it is<br/>\n&gt;possible to forget when replying, and to send the WHOLE digest out again...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it happens, I did it once, and posted a sorry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am pissed about is that it was replied to FIVE FREAKING TIMES, and<br/>\nnone of you had the sense to trim the reply.  I hate to break it too you,<br/>\nbut enchanter is the smartest class to play in all EQ.  I can understand one<br/>\nmistake, I can see past two, after that...  ( deletes and does not continue<br/>\nthis thought )<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, you begin to argue what robes are what... <br/>\n<br/>\nTham Robe, AC5, 3 Agi   befallen...   why would you wear this?  3 Agi is<br/>\nless than what is needed to give you the AC6 of a silk robe, or a senior<br/>\nrobe<br/>\nGossamer  AC8, from befallen, beautiful white color<br/>\nKeeper AC8 2 Int... from temple of Ro<br/>\nFBR   AC8 3 Int, 5 sta   from najena<br/>\nGreen silk drape, from one of the Sol Dungeons<br/>\nSMR   lower guk<br/>\n<br/>\nalso robe of ishiva and a few others that you will never see...
