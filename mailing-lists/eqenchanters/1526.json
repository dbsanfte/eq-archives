It<br/>\ngives you invulnerability for a certain amount of damage.  I have read<br/>\nthat Rune 1 is about 125 points of damage.  It will generally last<br/>\nuntil you have been hit for that amount, and then disappears.  When it<br/>\ndisappears  You start taking normal damage instead of the blow being<br/>\nabsorbed by your magical shield.  It also seems to go away after a long<br/>\nwhile if you take no damage at all.  I use Rune anytime I&#39;m in new<br/>\nterritory or I&#39;m doing something risky.  If your group&#39;s healer has run<br/>\nout of mana you can cast rune on your tank to keep him alive a bit<br/>\nlonger.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst spells for reserach require left and right halves of pages 23, 24<br/>\nand 26, respectively.
