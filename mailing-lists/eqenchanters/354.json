Note, some consider this twinking and a bad thing.  You can use a<br/>\nfriend as a go between or just find an out of the way spot like a room at an<br/>\ninn.  Bring both of your charcters there.  Then have one character drop the<br/>\ngoodies on the floor.  Quickly camp and bring your other character on and<br/>\npick up the items.  If more than one item you can just drop them all on the<br/>\nground (usually shows as one little bag but they&#39;re all there) or put in<br/>\ncontainer and drop container.  Not sure how long items dropped hang around<br/>\nbut they do hang around long enough to make a switch of characters.  Down<br/>\nside is if someone comes by and sees the bag on the ground while you&#39;re in<br/>\nbetween characters, they may help themselves to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard that you can give /consent to a player not currently in the game,<br/>\nmaking the possibility of having one of your characters loot another of your<br/>\ncharacter&#39;s corpse.  I don&#39;t know if this is possible or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel Devorkin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:devo@...\">devo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, April 26, 1999 3:56 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Re: New Survey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Daniel Devorkin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:devo@...\">devo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;how do you transfer items between charecters then? dont you have to log off<br/>\n&gt;with one to log in with the other?<br/>\n&gt;or are you using a friend for this?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
