It sounds like from<br/>\n&gt;what you said it would make more sense.  Instead of only having 3-7<br/>\n&gt;seconds you would have 30.  Wouldn&#39;t this work?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;---Ric Reichelt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:redr@...\">redr@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Ric Reichelt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:redr@...\">redr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Yes they are very different. Mesmerize is a great spell for solo or<br/>\n&gt;groups.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It basically stuns the creature for up to 30 seconds, allowing you to<br/>\n&gt;step<br/>\n&gt;&gt; back and cast, get away, or in a group scenario, you can mesmerize one<br/>\n&gt;or 2<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of the 3 creatures attacking your group, allowing the others to kill the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; one that remains unstunned. Do note, once u hit it, or cast a DD or DoT<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (Direct Damage or Damage over Time) spell on it, it&#39;s no longer stunned.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Lull makes the creatures less aggressive for a VERY short period of time<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (2-4 seconds). This is useful when wanting to attack a camp of 2 or more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; creatures they you couldn&#39;t handle alone or grouped with others.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Personally I didn&#39;t bother with Lull, but soon as I got Soothe (a better<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Lull) my group and I started taking camps we would of normally gotten<br/>\n&gt;&gt; slaughtered. My routine was, Soothe 2 of the 3 in the camp, while another<br/>\n&gt;&gt; magic user would have the 3rd targeted. Once I Soothed the 2 (with out<br/>\n&gt;them<br/>\n&gt;&gt; resisting) I announced go, they would cast on the 3rd pulling it out of<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; camp so we could fight it with out the other 2 attacking us all at once.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; VERY important, Soothe only last 3-7 seconds, giving just enough time to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Soothe 2 and pull a 3rd, so do not waste time and make it as fast as you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can else you&#39;ll end up pulling 2 or 3 vs. just 1.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hope this helps!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Telan Ka&#39;Rlaah of Rellos Zeke<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; At 05:19 PM 4/20/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;From: Brewhaus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brewhaus@...\">brewhaus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Is mesmerize a better Lull spell or is it totally different?
