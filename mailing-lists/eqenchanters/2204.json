I have some questions, hopefully not all of them have<br/>\nbeen asked before. I&#39;m now level 20.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Whirl till you Hurl - is this useful at all anymore ? I heard that it<br/>\nused to be a 15 second guaranteed stun and enchanters did nothing but<br/>\nwhirl all day, and now it&#39;s nerfed to uselessness.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Disempower and Enfeeblement. I cast both on myself, and lost 54 str and<br/>\n71 agi. I can see that I can waste a tank in PvP with these spells but are<br/>\nthey useful against MOBS ? Do MOBs have str, agi and other stats, or just<br/>\nac and atk ? Currently I do not use these spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I&#39;m still using mesmerize. Why is enthrall better ? Lower resists ? Longer<br/>\nduration ? Btw, I find that against orcs in Highpass, Mesmerize would <br/>\nconsistently wipe hate lists, very useful when charmed orcs turn against you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend highpass for fledgling enchanters 17-20. Get your highpass<br/>\nguard faction up, and learn how to deal with huge fights. I loved all the<br/>\naction you got there. Charm can really turn tables in those fights. Suddenly<br/>\ntheir healer is smacking them instead of healing them. Or they are getting <br/>\nbackstabbed by orc scouts.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. What is the speed improvement of quickness and others in that line ? Does<br/>\nthe speed improvement of quickness increase as you rise in levels ? Does<br/>\nthe meditation boost of clarity increase as you rise in levels ? <br/>\n<br/>\nFor lvl 20 enchanters out there, aviak guards in Lake Rathe, including those <br/>\nthat con even are very easy to solo. Get a magician summoned dagger for your <br/>\npet. This reduces its atk delay. Then give it quickness to make it really <br/>\nabusive. Then berserker str. Draw a guard with tashani/languid pace/choke. <br/>\nThe pet is so powerful that the guard is down to 2 bubbles of life before it&#39;s <br/>\nworked through the berserker str skin. The pet ends the fight with only 1 bubble <br/>\nof life lost. I&#39;m pretty sure it outdamages any lvl 20 tank. The best pet does<br/>\nmax dmg 22. <br/>\n<br/>\nMohini,<br/>\nLvl 20 high elf enchanter on Fenin Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
