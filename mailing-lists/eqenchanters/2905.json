If","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-83510772\">I myself found this line very unreliable until pacify. It reduces agro<br/>\nrange, it does not eliminate it. You have to know the exact pathing to use<br/>\nit well. If you do cast the spell on a critter, then pull one over it,<br/>\nwhatever you have calmed will most likely come also. You should start on the<br/>\nfarthest one in pathing and work toward you, pulling the closest. Harmony,<br/>\nwhile much more reliable, is outdoor only. I&#39;ve used pacify to split spider<br/>\ncamps in the Dreadlands and also  in Lower Guk to pull safe hall spawns solo<br/>\n(had to something while waiting for a group). When the spell is resisted and<br/>\nthe target doesn&#39;t agro, I will toss mem blur. It can be slow, it can be<br/>\nunsuccessful, but when it does work, you will amaze your group. Especially<br/>\nin a dungeon situation, I just tell the puller if it&#39;s less than 5, pull it,<br/>\nwe can handle it. And in anywhere near a good group, we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi ~Hand of Chaos~ CT<br/>\n<br/>\n\r<br/>\n_________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?\r<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
