Find yourself a snarer<br/>\npartner and snare and scare, 2 people can do 40-45 pretty fast at the<br/>\nskellie camp in the NW corner. Or you should be able to find a group on the<br/>\nwall of Karnor&#39;s anytime.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoM : With one group pulling to zone, it&#39;s hard to insert past them to<br/>\nanother good location, but excellent exp.<br/>\nOverthere: Sarnak knights top out at 39 or 40, not enough good exp there<br/>\npast 40.<br/>\nKaesora : Great exp in a full group. Problem is finding a full group there.<br/>\nDroga : Starts greening out at 42 or so.<br/>\nNurga : Believe it&#39;s lower level then Droga.<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi ~Hand of Chaos~ CT<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 15 Nov 2000 21:31:34 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Steve Rutkowski&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Leveling past 40<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for good places to level past level 40.  This is my 3rd<br/>\n&gt; post 40 character, and I&#39;d rather not level in SolB or Guk, and I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never PLed doing guards, however, this may be an option as I just<br/>\n&gt; want<br/>\n&gt; to level quickly.  I&#39;m also looking for places where I can solo<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ideas I can come up with (although I don&#39;t know much about them<br/>\n&gt; eperience wise from a below 50 perspective):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; CoM- grouped<br/>\n&gt; Overthere- solo or small group (but really don&#39;t like this area)<br/>\n&gt; Kaesorea- grouped, MOBs from 25ish to level 40 (Xalgoz)<br/>\n&gt; Temple of Droga- grouped, not sure on the level range of things here<br/>\n&gt; Mines of Nurga- not sure at all on the level range here<br/>\n&gt; Frontier Mountains- group or solo<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know the level range of MOBs in these zones?  I killed a<br/>\n&gt; bunch of stuff in these zones when the expansion first came out, but<br/>\n&gt; with the exception of CoM at 51/52 I didn&#39;t get experience from any<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, a little background, all the characters I&#39;ve played from start<br/>\n&gt; to 50+ were all before Kunark, and while I&#39;ve camped items in each of<br/>\n&gt; these zones with various people (so I do know the layouts), I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never<br/>\n&gt; done it for exp.  I also don&#39;t know what agro on pulling is like.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any help on those who&#39;ve leveled there would be great!  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?\r<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
