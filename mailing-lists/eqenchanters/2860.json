I was wondering if <br/>\nI could get some advice from all of you out there. I&#39;m Erudian, but I am <br/>\nhunting with a friend in Qeynos Hills right now, I&#39;m 4th level. I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing, usually here is what combat is like, I haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen lucky enough to get in a group yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Summon and Buff Pet<br/>\n2. Tashan<br/>\n3. Suffacating Sphere<br/>\n4. Enfeeblement<br/>\n5. Watch Animation beat up critter, sometimes help.<br/>\n6. Run away recast Animation and help finish it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are pretty much all the spells I use, with the exception of Minor <br/>\nGuard, Haze and Strengthen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that the best exp for me is to kill the diseased stuff and turn <br/>\nin thier pelts for alot of exp and a cure of course, that&#39;s really nice. I <br/>\nturned in a fleshy orb once, but she handed it back and said to go to <br/>\nFreeport, though I have no idea where that is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any problems with what I&#39;m doing? Please give me any advice you <br/>\ncan, I would love to hear it, I don&#39;t wanna get stuck in a way of doing <br/>\nthings only to find out that it will be wrong when I get higher in levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Where in Qeynos do I buy The daggers for the Animation spells? I lookf <br/>\nfor hours, and go very lost.<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
