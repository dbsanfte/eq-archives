Had one charge our group as<br/>\nwe where going to purchase more animated sword spells and we verified<br/>\neveryone&#39;s outdoor camo was still up as the critter charged. The question I<br/>\nhave is this: Is the Orc seeing invisible due to a spell cast by an Orc or<br/>\nby other means (npc&#39;s, players, etc.). Just curious as to the origin, as<br/>\nI&#39;ve never seen the source of this irritation. Strongly recommend you do not<br/>\nmake the trip alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nManny</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
