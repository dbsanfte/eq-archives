I think if I don&#39;t use piercing for a couple of levels<br/>\nfor example and then come back to it when I make a level it takes a while<br/>\nbefore I see a skill increase.  Maybe when we go to train at the guild we<br/>\nbring that skill to the forefront like it has been recently used alot.  My<br/>\ntheory doesn&#39;t answer why if you put one point in there sometimes aren&#39;t any<br/>\nincreases.  Maybe there&#39;s a critical point that needs to be passed based on<br/>\nskill level, character level, etc.  So, for some skills 1 point into that<br/>\nskill might be enough depending on what level you decide to try that but<br/>\nother skills need lots more points to &quot;catch up&quot; the skill to your current<br/>\nlevel if you wait till you are medium or higher level?<br/>\n<br/>\nfood for thought,<br/>\nDarmok<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: osmosis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:osmosis@...\">osmosis@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 21, 1999 2:35 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] Worth it to practice 1h blunt?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: osmosis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:osmosis@...\">osmosis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, and if you want to increase your skills be sure to train at your guild<br/>\nas much as you can.  a person with 1 skill wont improve as fast as a person<br/>\nwith 15 skill, trust me I spent a whole level tring to improve my piercing<br/>\n from 1 and there was no change, next level I trained it up to around 20 and<br/>\nI noticed my skills begin to rise shortly after.<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:08 AM 6/21/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Scott Murawski &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I didn&#39;t get a 1h blunt weapon (cracked staff) until I turned like level<br/>\n&gt;10, but I didn&#39;t practice it much.<br/>\n&gt;I think my skill is (1).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My piercing and 2h blunt are good though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Should I try hard and increase it?<br/>\n&gt;You can only increase mele skills on blues or above, right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;Azboklin the enchanter<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Scott Murawski                              <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott.murawski@...\">scott.murawski@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Applications Speech Engineer                          (voice) 212-425-7600 <br/>\n&gt;SpeechWorks Intl, Inc.
