Granted, the sole<br/>\ncomponents used cost a fraction of what the sale price is, yet factoring in<br/>\nfailures, training to get to that skill level, and your time to get it<br/>\nthere I think it&#39;s more than fair!

The<br/>\nKEY is getting all jewelers on the same page and charging the same or close<br/>\nto the same prices. Until that happens, you&#39;ll have to deal with a much<br/>\nless margin to reinvest into your trade.<br/>\nTry getting with all the jewelers, and get them all on the same page, it&#39;s<br/>\nto only help you, them, and the trade of jewelcraft.
