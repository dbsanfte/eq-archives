As for a day we do not play our<br/>\nEnchanter, BAH! Between people who dont know about the day, or ppl who just<br/>\ndont care, there will be Enchanters playing period. What is most important<br/>\nis Veriant hears our upset with the most recent changes, send em email,<br/>\nsend feedback and write up a bug report. The more people that do, the<br/>\nchances are something will be done. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing along the same lines, I&#39;d like to know where Veriant is<br/>\ntelling us of these changes vs. just putting them in and us finding out as<br/>\nwe play. If anyone know&#39;s please post it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTelan Ka`Rlaah of Rellos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
