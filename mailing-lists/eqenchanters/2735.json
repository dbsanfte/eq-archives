My enchanter<br/>\nhas leveled from 20 to 26 in that zone and can easily keep going there until<br/>\n30.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome good spots at 22 in the lake are:<br/>\nfirst binding:  probly best to bind at the lake / mountain zone since this<br/>\nis close to area where you will find groups<br/>\nsolo - dunno very dangerous solo and the zone is pretty big<br/>\nsmall group - healer and tank partners - on west lake shore toward south or<br/>\nsouth lake shore toward west (hint: clouds go west)<br/>\nfull group - outside sarnak fortress near bridge or in front of fortress or<br/>\npulling to lake / mtn zone<br/>\n <br/>\nonce you hit the upper 20s head to frontier mountains for brutes and<br/>\nmountain giants in full group.  At 26 they con from blue to red.<br/>\n <br/>\nFinally on Kunark, don&#39;t be fooled by thinking Firona Vie is the place for<br/>\nyou since it&#39;s the first zone you hit in the new world assuming you come on<br/>\nthe boat.  That zone is a nightmare and you&#39;ll easily die to a host of<br/>\nthings till you are around 30.  I&#39;m sure some people have made it work but<br/>\nhonestly the lake of ill omen is so much less stressful and rewarding.<br/>\n <br/>\nNo Kunark:<br/>\nfull group in upper guk or cazic thule.  enchanters are sought in CT for<br/>\ntrain stopping abilities and there are lots of lizards.<br/>\nI recommend these place only if you don&#39;t have Kunark.  If you have the<br/>\nexpansion go to the new lands!<br/>\n <br/>\nhope that helps a bit.<br/>\nAzara Sparklemeister<br/>\n26th enchanter, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Melinda [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warnock@...\">warnock@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 14, 2000 10:56 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Leveling etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello fellow enchanters, its me again :)  <br/>\n <br/>\nI am now level 22 and looking to leave Lake Rathe and head out to level<br/>\nelsewhere.  I am told to head to SK or to Unrest.  Does anyone have any<br/>\nideas on the best place?<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso:  Im a little low lvl yet, as far as i can tell, to do the quest for<br/>\nthe incandescent gloves and mask.  Does anyone know what they sell for? Or<br/>\neven what lvl I should wait until to do the quest?<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks again guys!<br/>\nCalistaah Fyreblaze<br/>\n22nd Season<br/>\nVeeshan Svr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
