This is NOT TRUE.  Believe me, I wish it was.  They would certainly sell a lot faster if it was true.<br/>\n    I confirmed this by expending all of my mana and then timing the how long it took to completetly regenerate.  I did this several times with no Mana bonus and then several times with two Jaded Silver Rings and the Sr. Apprentice Robe which gave me a total bonus of MANA +12.<br/>\n    The results were it took an average of 13 seconds LONGER to regenerate all the mana with the rings on.  This seems to indicate that the only effect is an increase in total mana.<br/>\n    Sorry guys!<br/>\n<br/>\nFren<br/>\nGnome, Enchanter<br/>\nTunare Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
