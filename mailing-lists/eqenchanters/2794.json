I have spent the last 2 days in the Plane of Hate <br/>\nworking on obtaing my last few items of Isiduous armor, bane of all <br/>\narmor to obtain.  I would rather it be on Lord Nagafen or deep in the <br/>\nbowels of Sebelis or Chardok than this plane.  After clearing the SW <br/>\nas most of you know, clerics get sleepy and most dont have the energy <br/>\nfor more, much less clearing out Maesto/INNY or even more revs, <br/>\nsigh.  But such is our quest for armor it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am fairly flexible with the abitlity to be 218 int or 248 charisma <br/>\nand can adjust these depending on perceived need.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday in PoH I was 248 charisma and all loaded for bear as I <br/>\noften am on a new planes trip.  Today I was 200 int and only 187 <br/>\ncharisma.  And, to my surprise I was equally able to mez the mobs and <br/>\ncritters.  I did only attempt charms on 4 occassions more or less <br/>\neach day and noticed no perceptable differnce.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am slowly arriving at the conclusion that charisma is totally or at <br/>\nleast in part a waste.  I am most sad about this because I have <br/>\nenormous pp invested in the finest of cha gear.  But alas, the <br/>\nconclusion is not new; I have suspected this for some time now, but <br/>\ndid not want to admit it to myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know much has been written on this matter but from the perspective <br/>\nof this enchanter, given one day at 248 cha and one day at 187, dont <br/>\nbreak your neck getting the cha.  Get the good solid int, mana items, <br/>\nthen AC.  I regret to report this for I feel our class has been <br/>\ngrossly misled by the gods and our wasted armor for some time now<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Gold, is never as good as bad Platinum,<br/>\n<br/>\n   Words to live by....<br/>\n<br/>\n       I am sincerely yours,<br/>\n<br/>\n            Lady Jouleblu Diamond,<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Knights of Loyalty<br/>\n<br/>\n                        52 Season Enchantress<br/>\n<br/>\n                              Cazic-Thule server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
