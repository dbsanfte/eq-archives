I think the formulas include the following:<br/>\nprimary skills: (formula differs for monks, rogues dual wield, double<br/>\nattack)<br/>\n(level + 1) x 5<br/>\n<br/>\nsecondary skills:<br/>\n(level + 1) x 3<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that formula for skill caps. At level 8 my Evocation skill cap will<br/>\nbe 45. As of now, I think I have trained 2 points into Evocation at level 1<br/>\nand or 2. This would give me a skill of 3 or 4 right now at level 4. I still<br/>\nhave 10 training points to spend. At 8th I will have 20 more points (if I<br/>\ndon&#39;t spend them on something else) for a total of 30.<br/>\nMy questionwas meant to read:<br/>\nAt 8th level can I put all 30 points into Evocation or will I need to split<br/>\nit up over more than one level?  e.g. \tTrain once at 8th: 30 points into<br/>\nEvocation<br/>\n\tor<br/>\n\tTrain at 4th level: 10<br/>\n\tTrain at 5th level: 5<br/>\n\tTrain at 6th level: 5<br/>\n\tTrain at 7th level: 5<br/>\n\tTrain at 8th level: 5<br/>\n\tEvocation Skill: 33-34 points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBahir</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
