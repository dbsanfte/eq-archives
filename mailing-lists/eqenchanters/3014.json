Until recently, most fights","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1179197748\">My regular group (just 3 of us) is myself the enchantress, my husband <br/>\ndruid, and our friend the paladin, all in the low 20&#39;s.  Until <br/>\nrecently, most fights found me doing tashani, choke, and maybe a <br/>\nslowdown on the incoming mob, getting in the mob&#39;s face so he&#39;d aggro <br/>\non me and my pet would attack, then sitting on my butt waiting for <br/>\nchoke to wear off and recasting if needed.  On the rare occasions that <br/>\nwe&#39;d get 2 mobs, I&#39;d mezz the extra.  Our fights were efficient, but a <br/>\ntad boring.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen one night my druid husband and I decided to try out the forest <br/>\ngiants in Warsliks Woods.  These guys hit hard, and we had no tank <br/>\n(Paladin off enjoying RL :)  The strategy we came up with was such a <br/>\nnice change of pace.  The druid pulled with snare (if resisted, he <br/>\nrecast after my tashani), I tashani&#39;d, if that was enough to get the <br/>\nmob&#39;s attention, I let him aggro on me and engage pet, if not, I hit <br/>\nhim with sanity warp.  Once on my pet (or me)  I&#39;d run off a bit <br/>\n(we both were SoW&#39;d) and the druid nuked and got the giant&#39;s <br/>\nattention.  While he tried to catch the druid, I nuked and got him <br/>\nback after me.  We&#39;d run back and forth, nuking, and generally <br/>\nconfusing the poor guy, with my pet at it&#39;s back.  Finally it would <br/>\ndecide to run, but found snare interfering, and would just stand there <br/>\nwhile my pet and druid husband beat it down.  After the battle, we&#39;d <br/>\nhave 2 or 3 bubbles of mana left and full health, and this was after <br/>\nbeating the low red ones.  Yeah, we then had to sit and med a bit, but <br/>\nthe battle was so much more fun playing dodge the giant. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had heard that druids and enchanters make good partners, now I know <br/>\nwhy.<br/>\n<br/>\nShaepe Shyphter<br/>\n22 Enchantress<br/>\nTholuxe Paells</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
