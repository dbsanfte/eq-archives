Anybody have further<br/>\ndetails - where does he spawn, placeholder, is he rare spawn ?, is it rare drop ?, <br/>\nor any other suggestions. I&#39;m planning to wear a plat cat&#39;s eye necklace when<br/>\nI can make plat jewellry, but that&#39;s only +9 cha. Seems like Gypsy Medallion is<br/>\nthe very best neck item for enchanters. True ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m currently wearing a Split Paw Tooth Necklace AC 2, +5 cha, +5 poison.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMohini,<br/>\n28 enchanter on Fenin Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
