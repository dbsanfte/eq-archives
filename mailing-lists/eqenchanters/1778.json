Most silver<br/>\nstuff, up to jade, sells at 1-2pp above cost, hence you may find difficult<br/>\nto sale unless you&#39;re patient. Electrum+ market isnt flooded yet, but most<br/>\nguilds have dedicated enchanters, so 100+ skills are known. Your market<br/>\nwill likely be lone 5-12th players.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAside from that, others replied with a very sound advice. Don&#39;t go making<br/>\nn times the same item. <br/>\n<br/>\nIbnabeth / Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 17:57 05/08/1999 -0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:duffjc@...\">duffjc@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have searched back a couple digests, and haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;found an answer and figured this would be quicker.<br/>\n&gt;I am an Enchanter on the Karana server, and have<br/>\n&gt;a Jewelery skill lvl of about 41.

Here is a list of <br/>\n&gt;prices I am charging now.  Could I get some<br/>\n&gt;feedback on what others are charging, and maybe<br/>\n&gt;set up a Merchants Co-operative to set prices for<br/>\n&gt;our market on Karana.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;+2 Agility rings 3pp<br/>\n&gt;+2 Dexterity Braclets 4pp<br/>\n&gt;+2 int rings 5pp<br/>\n&gt;+2 strength rings 6pp<br/>\n&gt;Jaded Silver rings 7pp<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I usually give up to 1pp off if someone buys 2 at<br/>\n&gt;a time.  Just wondering what the rest of you sell<br/>\n&gt;for.  I don&#39;t want to undercut the market, but <br/>\n&gt;then again I Don&#39;t want to sell to high.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think if we set up a Jewelery Co-operative we <br/>\n&gt;may be able to set higher prices for our wares.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sinth the Enchanter<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE ideas, and <br/>\n&gt;CONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
