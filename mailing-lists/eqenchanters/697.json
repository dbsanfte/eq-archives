I have seen two<br/>\nothers on Bristlebane, is there anymore and what are your character&#39;s name?<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the enchanter.  I have to say I was having doubts when I bought the<br/>\n8th level spells and most were pretty much useless, but the 12th level<br/>\nspells renewed my faith in the class.  I have to say that Whirl to you Hurl<br/>\nis the best combat non damage spell there is.  But I must say minor illusion<br/>\nis the most useful of all, I think have overlooked it&#39;s greatness.<br/>\n<br/>\nA full set of cloth armor can be purchased in two places in Erudin.  The is<br/>\na female vendor near the supply shop and a below the balcony of the temple<br/>\nof Quellious.<br/>\n<br/>\nPillage does exist.  I was in Greater Faydark, I had just gated back after<br/>\npurchasing the 8th level animation spell.  The second message I recieved<br/>\nafter gating in was an auction of the spell Pillage.  I inquired when told<br/>\nit was an enchanter spell.  The seller said he had completed a paladin quest<br/>\nin Erudin &quot;hundreds of times&quot; and that is was a random quest reward.  I<br/>\ncertainly didn&#39;t have the 3p and some odd gold that the vendors offered him<br/>\nlet alone whatever &quot;finders fee&quot; he would put on it.  I didn&#39;t know how rare<br/>\nit was.  I wish I could remember the characters name.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also wondering what enchanter spell only are sold in Erudin.<br/>\n------<br/>\nWhen the people we love are stolen from us, the way to have them live on is<br/>\nto never stop loving them.  Buildings burn, people die, but real love is<br/>\nforever.  -- The Crow<br/>\n-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
