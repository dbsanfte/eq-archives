I look at my<br/>\nspell book and see alot of gems that have the same graphic and I haven&#39;t<br/>\nlearned them all yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reason this is a bit more difficult for me is that I am primarily<br/>\ngrouped with my wife who plays a wizard. I have found that my primary<br/>\nfunction is to Soothe anything but the one we want on a group spawn, she<br/>\nroots and blasts while I wait for Root to break and cast WTYH, Choke and<br/>\nLanguid Pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nOffense / Defense: Abyssmal (have not been in melee long enough to get hit<br/>\nvery much).<br/>\n<br/>\nEvocation:Is so bad that I don&#39;t think it is above a 1 (if it has even<br/>\ngotten that high as I have cast it so little).<br/>\n<br/>\nConjuration: Whats that for? At 4th level, she had Root, and I had Fear<br/>\nready so she could root again.  At 8th I rooted / feared and that was it.<br/>\nNow at 12th I WTYH. No need for a pet. I have yet to cast my pet spell. And<br/>\nnow that I have Charm.... I&#39;m not even sure I will ever use it.<br/>\nMezmerise uses conjuration I realize, but I have yet to have a need for it.<br/>\nColor Flux has give me the time I need to get off a WTYH or fear as we have<br/>\nbeen focusing on wandering mobs and 2 to 3 mob spawns.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t even have time to cast Tashan as the mobs die so fast. I did in the<br/>\nbegining, but it seemed a waste of mana very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you have as your standard spell line up at 12th?<br/>\nAre you grouped with melee classes or other casters?<br/>\nShould I take the time to summon a pet and Mez it for an hour to get my<br/>\nskill up? Will I need it later in my career?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy divination and Alteration are maxed. I love illusions (div) and buff<br/>\neveryone I see normally. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know my wife and I will go far together with this combo, but I am worried<br/>\nthat I will lack the finess needed in a group of tanks when my guild goes on<br/>\nraids and such. Anyone have any advice?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nZhian *Dragons of Kel`Dar*<br/>\n12th Facet in the Jewel of Norrath<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
