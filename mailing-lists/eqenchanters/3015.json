Until <br/>\n&gt; recently, most fights found me doing tashani, choke,<br/>\n&gt; and maybe a <br/>\n&gt; slowdown on the incoming mob, getting in the mob&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; face so he&#39;d aggro <br/>\n&gt; on me and my pet would attack, then sitting on my<br/>\n&gt; butt waiting for <br/>\n&gt; choke to wear off and recasting if needed.  On the<br/>\n&gt; rare occasions that <br/>\n&gt; we&#39;d get 2 mobs, I&#39;d mezz the extra.  Our fights<br/>\n&gt; were efficient, but a <br/>\n&gt; tad boring.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then one night my druid husband and I decided to try<br/>\n&gt; out the forest <br/>\n&gt; giants in Warsliks Woods.  These guys hit hard, and<br/>\n&gt; we had no tank <br/>\n&gt; (Paladin off enjoying RL :)  The strategy we came up<br/>\n&gt; with was such a <br/>\n&gt; nice change of pace.  The druid pulled with snare<br/>\n&gt; (if resisted, he <br/>\n&gt; recast after my tashani), I tashani&#39;d, if that was<br/>\n&gt; enough to get the <br/>\n&gt; mob&#39;s attention, I let him aggro on me and engage<br/>\n&gt; pet, if not, I hit <br/>\n&gt; him with sanity warp.  Once on my pet (or me)  I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; run off a bit <br/>\n&gt; (we both were SoW&#39;d) and the druid nuked and got the<br/>\n&gt; giant&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; attention.  While he tried to catch the druid, I<br/>\n&gt; nuked and got him <br/>\n&gt; back after me.  We&#39;d run back and forth, nuking, and<br/>\n&gt; generally <br/>\n&gt; confusing the poor guy, with my pet at it&#39;s back. <br/>\n&gt; Finally it would <br/>\n&gt; decide to run, but found snare interfering, and<br/>\n&gt; would just stand there <br/>\n&gt; while my pet and druid husband beat it down.  After<br/>\n&gt; the battle, we&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; have 2 or 3 bubbles of mana left and full health,<br/>\n&gt; and this was after <br/>\n&gt; beating the low red ones.  Yeah, we then had to sit<br/>\n&gt; and med a bit, but <br/>\n&gt; the battle was so much more fun playing dodge the<br/>\n&gt; giant. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had heard that druids and enchanters make good<br/>\n&gt; partners, now I know <br/>\n&gt; why.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shaepe Shyphter<br/>\n&gt; 22 Enchantress<br/>\n&gt; Tholuxe Paells<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
