As far as enchanters being a solo class, EVERY<br/>\nclass is a solo class until level 10ish.  After that, being an enchanter is<br/>\nHARD work!  The most important thing about these hard levels is that you<br/>\nlearn to play an enchanter... no other class requires as much learning as<br/>\nours (IMHO).  For god sakes, get into a GROUP during these levels!  But for<br/>\nsolo... I didnt really notice the solo-ability of being an enchanter until I<br/>\nwas about level 38 or so, at which point I realized we can solo like no<br/>\nother class.  We dont have to kite, ensnare, fear, or root... we have the<br/>\nmesmerize line and the charm line.  These 2 spell disciplines are all we<br/>\nneed to solo, and solo extremely well!  I dont know if you read one of<br/>\nSmed&#39;s recent posts about watching an enchanter solo 5 spectres, but that<br/>\ncould have been me.  I&#39;ll tell you my strategy for that, if you ask nicely<br/>\n:)  Its fun AND easy!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd really... what other class can make a pet that hits for over 100?  well,<br/>\nbard I guess but I wouldnt want to be near THAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
