You<br/>\n&gt;may have read this description on someone&#39;s web page, but I doubt<br/>\n&gt;anyone at Verant said that it would stun.  I seem to recall them saying<br/>\n&gt;that the spells would shock rather than stun.  The shock effect causes<br/>\n&gt;a spellcaster to be interrupted.  Try it on a spell casting mob.
