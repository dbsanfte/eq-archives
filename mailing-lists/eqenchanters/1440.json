Does anyone know what the &quot;Effect&quot; (if any) is from the Blackened Wand?<br/>\nhas anyone tried Identify Item on it to see if the Effect shows up?  I<br/>\nobtained this recently, but the Effect area is left blank.  ?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I&#39;d like to be able to equip the above Wand, but that would mean a<br/>\nswitch from my 2H Totem to a 1H Blunt.  The best I&#39;ve seen is a Staff Of<br/>\nWrithing.  Any idea where I might obtain one?  Known locations to hunt?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMay Tunare bless you and the power of Polaris possess you!<br/>\n<br/>\nFistlebane, High Elf Enchanter, Order of Polaris Officer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
