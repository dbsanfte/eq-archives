Keeping the pet alive<br/>\nin the fight is my main startegy solo, so from time to time I enter the<br/>\nfray to draw the monster to me. It make sure the pet is alive when big<br/>\ntaunt spells (choatic feedback family) are used.<br/>\n<br/>\n- In group according to case lull/soothe (ex hitting orc camp in EC) <br/>\n- Tashan is the opener. Doesnt draw a lot od attention nor mana and help<br/>\nboth the group and me.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Suff. sphere and Enfeeblement<br/>\nAllow mob to hit so it activates the pet, plus enfeeblement helps a lot in<br/>\ncase of wildlife. Suff. being DOT its better to cast it early.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAfter that depends on the situation.<br/>\n- Whack the mob with a pointed stick.<br/>\n- Chaotic feedback is something else is approaching.<br/>\n- Root to run away and/or Fear (but you have to wait for the pet then).<br/>\nFear is especially useful if another mob start hitting me/grp from behind<br/>\n(but it is slow). <br/>\n<br/>\nNote rank 2 pets hit magics wpn only creats (eg wisps).    <br/>\n<br/>\n- In group color flux if against many monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrouble?. Fear + leave pet to die and zone/run away. <br/>\n<br/>\nIbnabeth <br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 13:48 12/05/1999 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Hapke, Matthew&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mahapke@...\">mahapke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My Complete spell tactics for solo <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Use pet, buff a lot.<br/>\n&gt;Find bad guy, draw with tashan.
