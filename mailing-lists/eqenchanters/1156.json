That sounded like a good idea<br/>\n&gt;too. We should discuss all those ideas and submit them to Verant.<br/>\n&gt;Skara &lt;Elite&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: osmosis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:osmosis@...\">osmosis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well I&#39;ve been making rings, earrings, bracelets since the beginning of the<br/>\n&gt;public release, and I have to agree that there are some serious problems<br/>\n&gt;with what we can make.  I&#39;m fortunate enough that I can enchant my own<br/>\n&gt;metals, but I find that very few are interested in my wares.  Strangely, I<br/>\n&gt;have been getting requests from higher level characters to make them as<br/>\n&gt;many jade rings as I can, perhaps they know something I dont. I sure have a<br/>\n&gt;hard time selling them on my own though. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyways, what I wanted to put out there was an idea.  Wouldnt it be<br/>\n&gt;wonderful if we could not only enchant the metal, but the stone as well?  I<br/>\n&gt;think a +5 mana ring with 5 charges of shocking grasp would sell quite<br/>\n&gt;well, or a +2vsFire ring with 1 charge of laying hands, or some other<br/>\n&gt;combination.  This is just an idea, but one I would love to see<br/>\n&gt;implemented.  I suspected that perhaps there was a way to scribe a spell<br/>\n&gt;onto paper, and put this into the extra slots but I havent figured that one<br/>\n&gt;out yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another note... does anyone know what good the other 2 slots in our<br/>\n&gt;jewelers kit are for?  I have tried several combinations of things in these<br/>\n&gt;slots, and other than losing a whole lot of money I did not learn anything<br/>\n&gt;at all, except that it is a good way to waste money. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
