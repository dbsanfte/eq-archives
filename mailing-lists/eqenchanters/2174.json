I realize Silver may not sell for much on the established<br/>\nservers and on PVP+ they would rather kill you for your wears, as if you<br/>\nwould sell them anyway. I am merely looking for a &quot;suggested retail price&quot;.<br/>\nAlso what zones result in the best prices?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that I saw was that Jewel Craft caps at 200 with Gold being<br/>\nTrivial then.
