Now when I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; level 8 or 9 there was nothing in the game I wanted more than one of<br/>\nthose,<br/>\n&gt; and I finally managed to loot one of my very own by the time I was 12 or<br/>\n13.<br/>\n&gt; I have long since moved on to other things, and getting this formerly-uber<br/>\n&gt; staff from a gnoll in one shot made me realize just how much tougher I am<br/>\n&gt; now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I kept the staff in my inventory, just because I thought some low-level<br/>\n&gt; would be able to use it. The next day, in Felwithe, some level one person<br/>\n&gt; asked if I could help them out. I usually just throw on a few buffs and<br/>\nsay<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Okay, now you can go kill things to get money and experience&quot; but I<br/>\n&gt; happened to have this staff and a generous mood.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I put the staff into a trade window, saying &quot;Here you go.&quot; The beggar<br/>\n&gt; actually cancelled the trade and said &quot;Do you have anything better?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Needless to say, he didn&#39;t get any items or buffs after that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Sagesse Noire<br/>\n&gt; 54 Enchanter<br/>\n&gt; Druzzil Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Shawn Alley [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shawna@...\">shawna@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, 06 October, 2000 3:24 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqenchanters] Re: manners<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; heh I agree.  I had someone come up to me in oasis last night and say &quot;Can<br/>\n&gt; you buff me?&quot;  I had time so what the heck, I threw on UV, aug, str,<br/>\nendure<br/>\n&gt; magic, obscure, and even a rune III.  Did I get a thanks?  Nope, the<br/>\n&gt; response was &quot;can&#39;t you sow me too?&quot;  Sigh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Next was the response from some people when I participated in a dragon<br/>\nraid<br/>\n&gt; with my guild.  I&#39;m level 35 so I raised some eyebrows when they saw me<br/>\n&gt; there for Nagafen.  However, I was there just to hang out with my<br/>\nguild,cast<br/>\n&gt; clarity, and buff whenever my buffs were needed/wanted.  Many people were<br/>\n&gt; thankful as I was the only enchanter at times.  Others though turned their<br/>\n&gt; noses up (none in my guild of course ;)) at aug because it wasn&#39;t swift<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; the wind and endure magic because it wasn&#39;t a higher form of that buff.  I<br/>\n&gt; cast 100p worth of RuneIIIs and received thanks for a few but not for<br/>\nmost.<br/>\n&gt; A guildmate gave me a saphire so the cost worked out in the end but it<br/>\nmade<br/>\n&gt; me sad to see the reaction of some strangers to my help.  I&#39;m not aware of<br/>\n&gt; all of the spells that take components but if you didn&#39;t know it does cost<br/>\n&gt; your friendly groupmates to cast some of those buffs.  If it&#39;s a normal<br/>\n&gt; group type situation I am happy to spend 20 or 30p for a night keeping the<br/>\n&gt; puller or primary tank Runed.  It&#39;s part of what I do.  Those who request<br/>\n&gt; Rune and offer no thanks are the ones that get me though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then there are those who are confused why I&#39;m wearing such &quot;crappy<br/>\n&gt; equipment&quot; when I&#39;m also wearing a Tranix crown.  Hehe, what kind of<br/>\n&gt; question is that?  I&#39;m doing the best I can  8)   I was just very lucky my<br/>\n&gt; guild asked me to roll on the crown during a FG raid and I won.  That was<br/>\n&gt; another time I tagged along to cast clarity and didn&#39;t dream I would be<br/>\n&gt; asked to roll on an item.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just remember to say please and thank you and it&#39;s so much more fun ;)<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; happy to buff people for free mana permitting if they only would say thank<br/>\n&gt; you.  Many do and I say thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Azara Sparklemeister, Sacrament<br/>\n&gt; 34th enchanter, Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: (Uthanatos) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vtemplarv@...\">vtemplarv@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, October 06, 2000 1:03 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] (Re: to Mark ) and a rant (sorry ;-) )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night I had a level 3 wizard come up to me and inspect me 9(!!!!)<br/>\ntimes<br/>\n&gt; in about 2 minutes.
