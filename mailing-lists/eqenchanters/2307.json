Alec of darkenbane for<br/>\n&gt;example).  Really I believe that equally skilled enchanter vs. necromancer<br/>\n&gt;means quite a lot of pain for both parties, and ANY other class would fall<br/>\n&gt;more easily.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am level 35, and these are DUELLING spells, since these isnt a general<br/>\n&gt;purpose spell bank and you&#39;ll never catch me with these particular spells<br/>\n&gt;memorized while I&quot;m fighting most MoBs<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. spells I memorize<br/>\n&gt;tashani<br/>\n&gt;curse of the simple mind<br/>\n&gt;mana seive<br/>\n&gt;entrance<br/>\n&gt;root<br/>\n&gt;tepid deeds<br/>\n&gt;chaos flux<br/>\n&gt;anarchy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This assumes that I&#39;ve been able to call a pet, give it a dagger, and buff<br/>\n&gt;it with alcrity, obscure, rune3, and feedback.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2. spells cast<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The first thing you HAVE to do is entrance the skelly pet.  if you dont do<br/>\n&gt;this your own pet will simply fight the necros pet, and most likely lose.<br/>\n&gt;Then tasani the necro, followed by entrancing him.  Cast curse of the simple<br/>\n&gt;mind on him, sit and forget curse of the simple mind and memorize strip<br/>\n&gt;enchantment.  As soon as this spell is available stand up and cast it on him<br/>\n&gt;twice.  Enthrall the pet again.  If the necro is STILL entranced, hit<br/>\n&gt;him/her with a mana seive or two until they begin casting on you.  (A wise<br/>\n&gt;necro will cast a small DoT on himself to prevent being entranced, so be<br/>\n&gt;careful).... entrance the necro again.  sit and med until he wakes up.  at<br/>\n&gt;this point it becomes a matter of mana remaining, and I usually choose to<br/>\n&gt;blast blast blast (no DoT for me to cast, I dont care for them in PvP) but<br/>\n&gt;you can continue to enthrall the pet.  NOTE: if your OWN pet is attacking<br/>\n&gt;the necromancer you wont be able to entrance him, but really you wont need<br/>\n&gt;to... in THIS situation Tepid Deeds is one debuff you HAVE to cast on him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3. spells I&#39;ve found to be useless when they&#39;d be great in PvP if they<br/>\n&gt;worked<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;a)Whirl spells - too short, slow casting, slow recast time... a damn shame<br/>\n&gt;this could be a great spell.<br/>\n&gt;b)charm and fear - damn verant, damn you to HELL.  I was killed by a level<br/>\n&gt;50 wizard after being feared by a Necro NPC, now why can MoBs fear us but we<br/>\n&gt;cant fear us?<br/>\n&gt;c)DoT - Personally, too slow for me, although the damage to mana ratio is<br/>\n&gt;quite good<br/>\n&gt;d)weaken debuffs - its a casting fight.  I definately use these when<br/>\n&gt;fighting a melee class, ESPECIALLY monks<br/>\n&gt;e)color flux line - handy for PvP but I&#39;m afraid to hit my pet so I dont use<br/>\n&gt;it.  If I have no pet this is a spell I use constantly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d really love to hear other enchanter strategies for PvP, I know there are<br/>\n&gt;flaws in my strategy but this has worked for me so I dont alter it too much.<br/>\n&gt;Of course this guide is a perfect situation, and I know that if we&#39;re caught<br/>\n&gt;unawares we can be toast rather quick... of course I think we&#39;re the best<br/>\n&gt;class for getting away alive as well, too bad we dont have shadow step<br/>\n&gt;too!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cogg - Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqenchanters] how to fight PVP without charm fear??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Freedom &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sysgod@...\">sysgod@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hi All,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have a lot of trouble with necros in Rellos zek i was just wondering<br/>\n&gt;&gt; what is the best method of fighting them whit out charm fear.... and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can i charm there pet???<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nJoin AllAdvantage.com and get paid to surf the Web!
