As of now, my skill is not\r<br/>\nthat high, and I can only make enchanted topaz\r<br/>\nnecklaces.  After examining some charts on \r<br/>\njewellery, i have found that Wolf&#39;s Eye Agate will\r<br/>\nindeed make an item that will help you versus\r<br/>\nmagic, when combined with silver.  Would anyone\r<br/>\nhappen to know where a tradesman such as I could \r<br/>\npurchase, or find, some of this stone.  I have\r<br/>\nnot been successful in locating it in Erudin or\r<br/>\nin Qeynos as of yet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAny help in this matter would be appreciated.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSinth the Enchanter\r<br/>\nlvl 9</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
