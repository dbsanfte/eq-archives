It&#39;s faster, more reliant, and lasts longer. If a mob<br/>\nis running for friends, mes will stop em dead in their tracks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother alternative to the dd/stun/mes/dd/stun/mes nuke combo is<br/>\nmes/tashania/tepid(shiftless)/dd/mes/dd/mes/dd/mes/dd<br/>\n<br/>\ntepid has been a lifesaver for me many times, especially those times when we<br/>\ntook on 2 frenzies and a bloodthirsty. I don&#39;t always tepid for the tanks, I<br/>\ndo it when they need the help. But If I&#39;m the only one aggroed on a<br/>\npotentially dangerous mob (entrance/tashania will do it), that mob is gonna<br/>\nget tepid. When and if they break mes, Ive got a 60+ delay mob that will<br/>\nnever interrupt my 2.5 casting time :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Maelael, 48th Enchanter<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw I went to paw yesterday, and I seriously do not recommend 35ish-40ish<br/>\nparties in the old Ren Rex area. There are enchanter mobs all over the place<br/>\njust waiting to charm. Turned our level 50 tank on us a couple times. But<br/>\nPaw is not as bad as I gathered from the posts, we cleared the entire<br/>\ndungeon with 50sk, 48enc, 35wiz, 50cleric, 50cleric, and it was extremely<br/>\neasy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for those of you who ever used the water as an escape from Lenrils spot,<br/>\n<br/>\nit has been modified. Them damn snakes will attack you under there, by the<br/>\ntime our party surfaced we had 3 snakes aggroed on us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Small Enchancement to this if the bards aren&#39;t near any other NPC that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>would<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;get you is to use one of your colour stun spells in the combo.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Easy way to solo even the Ghoul Magi is to buff a pet up then just cycle<br/>\n&gt;stuns while the pet rips a new one into the mob...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Just make sure the target is all on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Although with the new entrance and dazzle times dd/stun/mes/dd/stun/mes<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nuke<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;combo&#39;s are certainly the way to tackle high level single mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>- Baels</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
