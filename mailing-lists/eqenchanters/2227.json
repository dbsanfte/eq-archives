I would rather cast 5 Suffocating<br/>\nSphere than 2 Choke (less aggravating, I have found). I didn&#39;t even start<br/>\nusing Fear regularly until I saw what Chase the Moon could do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing in a group it is usually my role to save the poor wizard overburning.<br/>\nTo halt the fight before an escape. I often need to cast 2 or three spells<br/>\nin a hurry just as everything is falling apart. And that is at the end of<br/>\nthe fight. Not much mana, not much time. Lower level spells are better!<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that there are uses for the stronger spells. But in the common<br/>\nsituation where you are hunting blacks and yellows in a group, numbers are<br/>\nusually the main concern.
