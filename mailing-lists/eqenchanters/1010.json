What I invision is an entire army of invisible Enchanter marching righ into the Enemy camp and out of no where summoning our pets and routing every one in sight.  Imagine multiple squads of 6 suddenly becoming 12  as we summon. Imagine marching to justwithin casting range and rooting every enenmy then casting  DOT spells while another unit moves in for with pets and finishes them up. If anyone of you would like to experiment with this let me know. I also think that it would make people think about the powers of enchanters. We do have some of the best spells out there but we have to use them a little more creatively.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nMushin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
