What am I missing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not sure.  Mez and the like are the strong points of the Enchanter class.<br/>\nEven at L5, you should notice that it saves your life quite a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt basically stuns a mob for 24 seconds OR until the mob gets attacked or<br/>\ntakes damage.  You can only use it on something that doesn&#39;t have a DOT on<br/>\nit and is not under attack by your pet or a party member.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it as a spell that says &quot;don&#39;t do anything until I&#39;m ready to<br/>\ndeal with you&quot;.  Use it:<br/>\n - If you accidentally get more than one foe, to make one wait while you<br/>\nkill the other.<br/>\n - If your pet dies while soloing, to make your target wait while you mem<br/>\nthe animation spell and summon another pet.<br/>\n - If you&#39;re about to run to the guards, to give yourself a 24 second<br/>\nheadstart.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5&gt; Why does my pet always stand on what I&#39;m trying to loot?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s starved for attention.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6&gt; Is being agnostic going to cause grief later?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.  Being agnostic is usually the best choice.  Having a religion will<br/>\naffect your faction even when you have an illusion up, which is a bad<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n--<br/>\nMark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;   !G</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
