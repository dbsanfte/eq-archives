I finally made 8th level, and so off I go to get my pet spell.  I had read many reports on this list, so I thought myself prepared.  After about an hour and a half trip from Felwithe, I finally reach High Hold Pass.  My invisibility still going strong, I procede in a short distance only to be rooted and killed by some #@!!@#$ orc who could see invisible.  I came from Kithicor forest.  Was I just unlucky?  Is there another better way in, other than through kithicor?  That place is insane.  How do they expect us to ever get a pet at this level?  I&#39;ve been hearing Mages whine about have to research 24th level pets.  How about getting screwed out of 8th level.  If my bitching is unfounded, please tell me.  I will appologize.  If there is an easier way, or I just got unlucky, let me know.  Please.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
