My suggestion would be to stop<br/>\ncasting it on yourself.  (that hurts)  At least go to the Freeport/Commons<br/>\nnewbie area and whack Orc Pawns/skellies with it.  You get a nice faction<br/>\nadjustment, and maybe even some cloth or rusty weopons to sell.  Why target<br/>\nyourself?  Otherwise, I raised mine by only using it in situations where it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t a neccesity, like when you&#39;re soloing a low blue.  By doing this, I<br/>\nmanaged get Evo to a useable state by level 10 1/2, and I maxed it by level 12.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND STOP NUKING YOURSELF.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
