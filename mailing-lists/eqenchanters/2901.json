How much exactly does<br/>\nsoothe reduce the agro range by? So far I have only been able to take out<br/>\nKayla by the tree. Every time I try for Shayla (they are all even fights<br/>\nright now) I soothe Tay and Jay and even throw one on Shay, back way up and<br/>\ncast Tashan. Now it may have been a fluke, but  my pet engaged her too close<br/>\nto Jay and ended up pulling her to. It still happened when my pet didn&#39;t<br/>\nattack her early. I have run to MM several times no matter how many times I<br/>\ntry to pull Shay. Help? Druidic Harmony cannot be beat at this camp. *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also told to try Cognoggin (13 warrior). Where is he located? I was<br/>\ntold by the gnomes in LFay, but will I be able to pull him without any other<br/>\nmobs coming after me? I know he is on faerie faction, which I don&#39;t give a<br/>\nhoot about, just like Gearheart and the Queen. Anyone know a loc?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nUthanatos<br/>\nGnome Chanter<br/>\n12th Facet in the Gem of Norrath</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
