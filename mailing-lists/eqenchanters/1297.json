And Enchanters ARE supposed to control the<br/>\nbattles and morhp it to what they wan&#39;t. It would be<br/>\ncool to cast faster and cheaper. Course you do have a<br/>\ngood point evocation is our major damage spells and<br/>\ncosts lots of mana and is needed for soloing. course<br/>\nat higher levels it&#39;s really high to solo but for<br/>\nenchanter&#39;s they can solo, so if you like soloing go<br/>\nfor evo. If you like to do both go ahead and put it in<br/>\nEvo cause while everyoe is attackin you still have<br/>\n&lt;Time&gt; which is the key part to this skill to cast<br/>\nyour debuff spells. Evo is slow and costly in mana.<br/>\nfor those of you that like to just go groups a lot<br/>\nmore than solo go ahead on alteration but me<br/>\npersonally i&#39;m gonna go through all spells and see<br/>\nwhat skill they take than decide.<br/>\nAlso is there a list i can find to find all the<br/>\nadvantages an minor illusion has? Ie:<br/>\nDarkelf get&#39;s ultra vision<br/>\nHumans get&#39;s Bonus exp? I think?<br/>\ni&#39;m not even sure but i think there is SOMEHOW an<br/>\nadvantage to each kind of race like the fire elemental<br/>\nhaving super damage.<br/>\nI could use a list like this.<br/>\nThe Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n--- HiFi Review &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hifireview@...\">hifireview@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: HiFi Review &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hifireview@...\">hifireview@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; seems to be a good time to discuss specialization,<br/>\n&gt; now that it is<br/>\n&gt; available.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We can choose one primary specialization.  Which do<br/>\n&gt; you guys plan to<br/>\n&gt; choose?  Alteration seems to be the obvious choice<br/>\n&gt; for enchanters, as<br/>\n&gt; most of our bread and butter spells are of that<br/>\n&gt; type.  However, our DD<br/>\n&gt; spells are evocation and our illusions are<br/>\n&gt; divination.  Do any of you<br/>\n&gt; think that these spells are more important?  Is it<br/>\n&gt; possible that an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter specializing in evocation could go toe to<br/>\n&gt; toe with a wizard? <br/>\n&gt; Or is the spell delay issue still going to be a<br/>\n&gt; problem?
