And yes please tell \n  me that I am<br>wrong that I wanted to wear the Thaumaturgists robe over the \n  Yellow Erudite<br>robe when I played. Yes, I am wrong for wanting to wear a \n  different robe<br>than the one I had been wearing for 4 months. I suppose my \n  friend is also<br>wrong for actually liking the color. In the future I will be \n  sure to listen<br>and adhere to your personal preferences.<br><br>And I dont \n  care what drivel people spout about what stats do and what stats<br>dont. We \n  have proven time and time again that we notice a greater<br>performance when \n  stats are increased... we cannot state exactly why, but our<br>performance is \n  nonetheless greater.<br><br>I personally have a 200 charisma and a 200 \n  intelligence and I am aiming to<br>increase my agility now. If i feel as if my \n  performance in game has not<br>changed with the increase, perhaps Ill try \n  Dexterity next, for the last<br>alternative would be stamina for more \n  hp.<br><br>I suppose you still believe in the fact that Wisdom is what \n  affects<br>Jewelcraft. I cannot dispute if it is correct or not, but I can \n  guarantee<br>that I jewelcraft with a wisdom of 128, and people who are \n  wearing their<br>&quot;wisdom gear&quot; to get near 200 wisdom around me are failing a \n  lot worse than<br>I am, and I have a 198 skill compared to their \n  200.<br><br>But again I appreciate your explaining to me the inner workings of \n  the game<br>and what I should and should not like, as Im sure many other \n  people on this<br>thread appreciate it as well.<br><br>People dont listen to \n  when people tell you what you need and dont need. Take<br>it into account, \n  play with different configurations, and stick with what you<br>like best.

( +2 mana, that&#39;s useful )<br>the \n  Tham robe is AC5 +3 agility&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Now&nbsp; unless you still \n  live in some dream world thinking that Agility has<br>some mystical function \n  in the game; even when everyone, including Brad<br>McQuiad, the producer of \n  the game says it does not; you must know that<br>agility really only affects \n  your AC.&nbsp; For Erudites, Humans, and other lower<br>agility races, at the \n  levels that you would wear the tham robe, it takes 4<br>agility to raise your \n  ac ONE point.&nbsp; 3 agility does not raise it one whit.<br>If you are Dark \n  elf or other higher agility race ( i.e. more than 75 )&nbsp; it<br>take 6 or 7 \n  points of Agility to raise your AC ONE point.<br><br>Now keep in mind, agility \n  affects your total AC, not the AC on the item, and<br>that agility HAS NO \n  OTHER FUNCTION IN EQ OTHER THAN RAISING YOUR AC.&nbsp; (( For<br>anyone piping \n  up that Agility affects your channeling, get a gun and shoot<br>yourself, you \n  are hopeless ))<br><br>Now, here is the real kicker... based on your LEVEL ( \n  nope, still not your<br>agility, but keep that dream alive ), items add more \n  AC than they list in<br>their description.&nbsp; An ac 6 item adds 8-9 to your \n  real AC number.... a AC5<br>item adds like 6-7.&nbsp; ( I do not care what \n  real number it really is, like I<br>said, it is level based, not a linear \n  formula, and all results will vary<br>anyway)&nbsp; To add to your misery, \n  just like the Agility calc, it throws away<br>fractions, so 8.999 is 8 and \n  9.001 is 9.<br><br>Now&nbsp; for the most important reason to NOT wear the \n  tham robe... IT IS CRUD<br>BROWN.&nbsp; <br>If you cannot get a pure white \n  Gossamer robe, the pinnacle of fashion, get a<br>green senior, red senior, \n  Blue senior, or even a Purple Senior from the<br>necros in FP.&nbsp; Just do \n  not wear those gay ass yellow or violet senior robe.<br><br>Now&nbsp;&nbsp; if \n  you want to continue this conversation, please direct it \n  to<br>moghedan@..., and not this list.&nbsp; I will be happy to tell \n  you all<br>the ways you are wrong in private.<br><br>Moghedan \n  Carns<br>Enchanter Adept of Freeport<br>Brell \n  Server<br><br><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>How \n  about a flat, no-fee long distance rate of 6.7┬ó per min. - <br>or less?
