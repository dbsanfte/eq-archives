I assumed for<br/>\ncha dependant spells like mez, charm, lull, there was a single saving throw <br/>\nthat was based on your level, level of target, MR of target and your cha. You<br/>\nare saying that there are two seperate throws ? Could you elaborate ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that for variable duration spells, MOBs get a saving throw every<br/>\ntick. For root, they additionally get a saving throw everytime damage is done.<br/>\nFor charm, I believe the saving throw is dependant on your cha. I&#39;ve<br/>\nhad the misfortune of having sympathetic aura fade during battle, and having<br/>\ncharm break almost immediately afterwards. I would guess that every tick, your<br/>\ncharmed pet looks at your cha and makes a saving throw, instead of just<br/>\nremembering your cha when you first charmed it. Anybody confirm or deny ?<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, some high level enchanters in my guild were questioning the role of cha, <br/>\nsince they see very little variation in resists over a large range of cha. But <br/>\nat lvl 27, with cha 150, I certainly notice if sympathetic aura is missing. <br/>\nSuddenly my AE mez is getting resisted by more than 1 lizard. Maybe this changes<br/>\nat high levels ? Or maybe 140 is a break point of some sort ?<br/>\n<br/>\nMohini,<br/>\n27 enchanter on Fenin Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
