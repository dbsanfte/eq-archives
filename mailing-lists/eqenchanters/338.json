I have<br/>\ntried bone chips (dont combine), bat wings (dont combine), and multiple<br/>\ngems (never works).  I dont see what combining gems or metal with pelts<br/>\ncould do.  I may try a rusted blackbox next... also I was wondering if<br/>\nthere was any way of combining coins to perhaps make a bar of metal ,i.e. 4<br/>\nbanks filled with 20 cp each may produce a copper bar?
