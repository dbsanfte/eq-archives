I use a Fasination <br/>\nright off.  I ask the tanks to attack any that are not mezd or it did <br/>\nnot stick to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf more than one is not mezed, often they all are mezed, but <br/>\nsometimes one or two resist.  I recast fascination.  Let them start <br/>\nto work on the mob fist selected.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I try to pick out a non caster type from the remaing mobs (non <br/>\nwiz or shammy) and tash him and cast charm on him.  While I wait for <br/>\nthe fasinatioins to bust I root the mobs not charmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce it is broken I immediately cast dazzle on it or them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I tell my pet to attack the mob they are working on.  If not too <br/>\nlate i slow it.  But at minium i tash it.  I tash any remaining mobs <br/>\nand then med a tad.  Maybe suck some mana from target if he is caster <br/>\ntype.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharming the baddie being tanked or one of the ae mezed ones is a <br/>\ntactic I recommend on higher lvl baddies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find charm is almost an essential tool now.  I am very excited <br/>\nabout the new charm I will get at 53 and cannot wait)<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Jouleblu Diamond<br/>\n<br/>\n     52 Enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n          Knights of Loyalty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n              Cazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
