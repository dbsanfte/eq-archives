You dont want to waste<br/>\nthose hard-earned pages on getting your skill up to 20 when you can simply<br/>\ntrain in it.  I&#39;m not sure of the amounts of skill points you can train in<br/>\nat those levels, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nExpect to ruin the faded pages, they are generally the more difficult items<br/>\nto research (and generally for the spell you want the most).  Dont worry<br/>\nabout your skill points though, once you&#39;ve recieved dodge it will go up<br/>\nrather quickly and doesnt necessarily warrant training in that beyond the<br/>\ninitial point (which you NEED to train).  I am level 46, and generally train<br/>\nin one of the 2 dragon languages.<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg - RZ<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;(Uthanatos)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vtemplarv@...\">vtemplarv@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &quot;&#39;(EQ Enchanters)&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 28, 2000 8:16 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Skill points<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi all;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been taking a break from my Enchanter lately, but I have a few<br/>\n&gt; questions on skill points. After I hit 8th, I put 10 points into evocation<br/>\n&gt; since the spell itself sucks alot of mana. Now When I look forward, I see<br/>\n&gt; research at 16 and nothing again til 20 for specialization, then dodge at<br/>\n&gt; 22, then nothing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now if what I read is correct at 16, 17, 18, and 19 I can train 1 point<br/>\ninto<br/>\n&gt; research for each level. At 20 I can put as many points into it as I wish.<br/>\n&gt; Is this correct?<br/>\n&gt; Do I save my points and pump research to the max at 20 (70 minus the 5 for<br/>\n&gt; specialization)?<br/>\n&gt; How hard is it to be successful at 16 with a skill of 1?<br/>\n&gt; My primary char is collecting lefts, rights, faded pages, etc. so that I<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; increase skill but I would like to know my odds for when I actually start<br/>\n&gt; using the pages for research.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Uthanatos<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
