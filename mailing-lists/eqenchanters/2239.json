The reason is that you <br/>\nwant them all and that you cant get one above 50 until you have at least <br/>\nput a point into each of them.<br/>\nI also recommend Alteration. At the present time Baelsih at Castersrealm <br/>\nis the only one who has a good page for viewing spells by skill type.  So <br/>\nlook at your spell list or hit his site and then view by the different <br/>\ncategories to see what spells you like and the skill they fit in.<br/>\nYou will find that most of our spells are Alteration.<br/>\nSince Specialization will reduce mana cost if it works it should be for <br/>\nspells you will cast often and when your mana may run out.  For example <br/>\ncombat spells or enchantments.<br/>\n<br/>\nStonedreamer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJenni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n12/14/99 10:45 PM<br/>\nPlease respond to eqenchanters<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n        To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n        cc: <br/>\n        Subject:        [eqenchanters] Research and Specialization<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jenni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi All!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was reading on eq.castersrealm.com about research (gettin close to 16<br/>\nand I REALLY want mesmerisation :)  ), I need to find page 26 of<br/>\nTsarin&#39;s Grimoire left and right for it.  Does anyone know where it<br/>\ndrops or where I might be able to buy it?  Also, Is the tome of Endless<br/>\nEnchantments in the general Enchanter guild area or do I need to travel<br/>\nto find this as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also ran across the page on specialization, and it&#39;s got me curious<br/>\nnow..<br/>\n<br/>\nThis page says that the spell skills will cap at 50 skill and you can<br/>\nthen specialize in one.  I&#39;m level 14 right now, and All of my spell<br/>\nskills are at 75 (except conjuration, which is at 36, uck, need to keep<br/>\nworking on that one).  Has something changed with specialization or am I<br/>\njust not understanding something?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nEzrae<br/>\nLevel 14 Dark Elf Enchanter<br/>\nBrell Serilis</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
