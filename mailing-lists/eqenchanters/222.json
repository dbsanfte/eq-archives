I just love trying to hit something that&#39;s INVULNERABLE.<br/>\n <br/>\nDoes anyone know so far which 2H weapons does the most damage with little lag time? I know as spell casters, we rely mostly on our spells, but I it&#39;s fun to get my hand&#39;s dirty every once in a while :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;ve notice that guilds don&#39;t sell the complete spells for each level (ie Mercyl&#39;s Animation, and Enchant Silver (would love to try my luck at making magical jewelry)).
