Try illus human + alliance on a vendor (Freeport) (I play<br/>\n&gt; Erudite) Price did not go down. . Tried the same on the Erudite gemseller<br/>\n&gt; in EC, same result. So this is obviously not this spell&#39;s use.<br/>\n&gt; Still at it,<br/>\n&gt; I have other ideas to test.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That *IS* the spells purpose, Alliance is just the lowest version and is not<br/>\nvery worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - Poison. Meditating is NOT sitting. I wish someone told me that before.<br/>\n&gt; Just figured it out after I saw the poison effect wore off and watched the<br/>\n&gt; hp grows.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you meditate, you *do* sit, so I&#39;m not sure what this statement means.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - Jewelry. Jewel&#39;s prices are related to the level of one&#39;s skill. At<br/>\n&gt; jewelry 30 I sold rose quartz wedding ring at 133sp (+cp), made 31 and<br/>\n&gt; price went up 152 (+cp). Almost no loss :P. I noticed something similar<br/>\n&gt; earlier (I worked lvl 9-13 on my own before buying the rest of the lvls<br/>\n&gt; from a teacher). So maybe jewelry is not so bugged in the first place. If<br/>\n&gt; anyone else can confirm/infirm this I would appreciate (test sales before<br/>\n&gt; and after a 10th is reached)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most likely you just sold to a different vendor that liked you better. If<br/>\nthis is not the case, it would be a MUCH needed change.  Another would be to<br/>\nraise the benefit of the enchantment based on your jewelcraft skill, so<br/>\nsomeone with a skill of 100 could make a MUCH better item than someone at a<br/>\nskill of 30.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDjar Lightbringer(Tarew Marr Server)<br/>\nServant of Light, Deliverer of the Truth to Norrath</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
