Does anyone know where it<br/>\n&gt; drops or where I might be able to buy it?  Also, Is the tome of Endless<br/>\n&gt; Enchantments in the general Enchanter guild area or do I need to travel<br/>\n&gt; to find this as well?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also ran across the page on specialization, and it&#39;s got me curious<br/>\n&gt; now..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This page says that the spell skills will cap at 50 skill and you can<br/>\n&gt; then specialize in one.  I&#39;m level 14 right now, and All of my spell<br/>\n&gt; skills are at 75 (except conjuration, which is at 36, uck, need to keep<br/>\n&gt; working on that one).  Has something changed with specialization or am I<br/>\n&gt; just not understanding something?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ezrae<br/>\n&gt; Level 14 Dark Elf Enchanter<br/>\n&gt; Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
