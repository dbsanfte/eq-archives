I don&#39;t recall looking in Ak&#39;Anon.  I did find it in Erudin in the Enchanter guild.  I believe it was on the normal illusion vender.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for &quot;new&quot; illusions, I would like to see Verant put in a special stackable Illusion: Opposite Sex.  I can&#39;t see any game use for it, but I think it would be kinda neat.<br/>\n--<br/>\nRonh Charming<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Fri, 7 Apr 2000 10:43:33 -0700 (PDT), you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can also now confirm that Illusion:Erudite has absolutely no effect<br/>\n&gt;except putting the spell icon in the corner.

Ah, well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Next question: is Illusion: Halfling available anywhere outside of Erudin?<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m Currently based in Freeport (though camped in Highkeep after getting<br/>\n&gt;my pet), and would like to avoid the trip.  I was hoping to find it in<br/>\n&gt;Neriak, but didn&#39;t see it.<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Mark Rafn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAccess your e-mail anywhere, at any time.<br/>\nGet your FREE BellSouth Web Mail account today!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.bellsouth.net\">http://webmail.bellsouth.net</a><br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
