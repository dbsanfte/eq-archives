I just remembered a story I read from an Enchanter in Kelethin. He was<br/>\ntesting his new spells, and was trying out Color Flux.  He was attacking<br/>\nsomething underneith the city itself which he pulled there from the forrest.<br/>\nShortly after hitting the Color Flux hot-key a few times he noticed<br/>\nMerchants from the city above started jumping onto the ground around him.<br/>\nHEH! He had enough time to think: WTF? when they started to beat the crap<br/>\nout of him. It was a short battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure if this is fixed, but I would be careful using this in dungeons<br/>\nthat stack rooms. If you hit it while on 1st floor Befallen, you may end up<br/>\nbringing the Elf Skeleton from the 3rd door up to the top floor.<br/>\nI think this is similar to the Rogue ability Sense Traps. I works in your<br/>\ngeneral area, but does not take into account virtical displacement. Either<br/>\ndoes Levitate (MoBs still know you are over their head at 50 feet and can<br/>\nstill punch you from the ground). Ah well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr am I totally off as to why this may have happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBahir</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
