I was around level 13 or 14 at the time. I&#39;ve<br/>\nchanged my tactics quite a lot since.<br/>\nthe major change would be that when I solo, I dont use debuffs at all<br/>\nanymore. I use tashan, dot, whirl, damage, whirl, damage, etc..<br/>\nwhen I fight with a group, I dont whirl anymore, I root instead. Root lasts<br/>\nlonger and keeps all spellcasters safe. if you have a level 20 wizard in<br/>\nyour group, the monster wont live long anyway.<br/>\nwhen fighting big reds, I always cast Tashan ( now that it&#39;s less resisted )<br/>\nso that fellow wiz and mages can do more damage. I also cast berserker<br/>\nstrength and quickness on all the tanks right before the fight. That usually<br/>\ntakes care of most of my mana. Also when fighting reds, I use memory blur a<br/>\nlot. I&#39;ve saved many people with that. When this nasty centaur courser comes<br/>\non your wizard and start pounding on it for 74 damage, that&#39;s a great way to<br/>\nsave him, much more reliable and much quicker than taunting. spellcasters<br/>\nshould also always root a monster when a fellow spellcaster is attacked<br/>\ndirectly. I have a macro that YELLS to my group BACK OFF! STOP ATTACKING!<br/>\nThat is when the fight is turning too nasty. I hit this macro, give them 5<br/>\nseconds and blur the memory of the enemy. That works great for centaurs and<br/>\naviaks, wouldnt work with agro monsters though..<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout your fear technique, it&#39;s cool, I&#39;ve done that too but you really have<br/>\nto do this in a safe place. At the time, I tried that on a young kodiak in<br/>\nwest commons and ended with a horde of adult ones on me! Dont even try that<br/>\nin dungeons. Also, I recommend not using pets in dungeons, especially our<br/>\npets. you cant tell them to stop attacking. I had my pet chasing a froglok<br/>\nin Guk for a long time, and at some point, it died. About one minute later,<br/>\nI see from a distance a huge mob coming my way, I was dead in instants, hit<br/>\nabout 10 times for 45 damage by 10 high level ( at the time ) frogloks. That<br/>\nis an extreme case but it happens. also, charm is much better in dungeons.<br/>\nmy 2 more cents,<br/>\nSkara de Toxxulia &lt;Elite&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ben Setala [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:onlyanembryo@...\">onlyanembryo@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 01, 1999 4:50 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] To Franck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ben Setala &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:onlyanembryo@...\">onlyanembryo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to be replying to such an old post, but I don&#39;t<br/>\ncheck my mail often.

I&#39;d say that for any class<br/>\nEXCEPT the enchanter it&#39;s almost necessary. For the<br/>\nenchanter, it isn&#39;t necessary at all. Safer true, you<br/>\ncan&#39;t always be sure what&#39;s going to happen, or how<br/>\nmuch mana you&#39;re going to be down, but not really<br/>\nnecessary as long as you keep your wits, and fight<br/>\nsmart.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Always be the first to run in a party, at least<br/>\n&gt; before your tanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Umm, never. I&#39;m usually one of the last to run. While<br/>\nthey&#39;re running, I&#39;m busy mesmerizing, fearing, etc.<br/>\nthe mobs to give us a chance of making it out alive.<br/>\nDon&#39;t be such a fraidy cat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) keep the mob off you by using mesmerize every 3<br/>\n&gt; or 4 spells you cast ( do<br/>\n&gt; that with your pet too ).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sound advice, better yet don&#39;t burn so much mana that<br/>\nyou&#39;ve taunted the sucker on you so badly in the first<br/>\nplace, less downtime too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) soloing becomes much easier at level 12 when you<br/>\n&gt; get whirl till you<br/>\n&gt; hurl..your pet can then stay alive more than 10<br/>\n&gt; second,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So many people overlook Fear, Level 4, it basically<br/>\nhas the same effect as whirl, you just don&#39;t stay in<br/>\nthe same place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5) do not solo. we are not a soloing class. I havent<br/>\n&gt; soloed since level 5.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve solo&#39;d plenty, level 13 now and going strong.<br/>\nAgainst yellow mobs, several blues, whatever. You can<br/>\nsolo just fine, better even than most classes in my<br/>\nopinion, but then, hey what do I know?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6) to make a lot of xp, try parties of 2. With the<br/>\n&gt; debufs you can make any<br/>\n&gt; yellow a blue or a green, and while you focus on<br/>\n&gt; that, your partner can<br/>\n&gt; easily take care of the monster.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely true. I solo a lot like I said, but my<br/>\npreference is to have one or two other good people<br/>\nalong. The reason? Less downtime, I usually have a<br/>\ngood amount of mana left over after the fight, instead<br/>\nof being down to one exit bubble left :) I call it the<br/>\nexit bubble because it&#39;s the one that I only actually<br/>\nuse if my intent is to &#39;exit stage left&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 7) in large parties ( 6 people ), when attacking one<br/>\n&gt; big red...well stay<br/>\n&gt; aside because you are useless anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This point I concede, but there are a few things you<br/>\ncan still do. Hit it with Tashan, whack it, try to<br/>\ntaunt it enough so that it tries to hit you, and your<br/>\npet joins in, even resisted spells are a taunt. Better<br/>\nyet, charm something nearby to get into the action and<br/>\nhelp out a bit, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 8) in large parties, when attacking a bunch of blues<br/>\n&gt; to yellow, try to<br/>\n&gt; switch target quite often so you will have a better<br/>\n&gt; overall effect over the<br/>\n&gt; battle and no monster will especially get mad at you<br/>\n&gt; and come for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In a large battle your tanks should all be fighting<br/>\nthe same mob, the rest is up to you to control. If<br/>\nthere&#39;s anything an Enchanter excels at, it is crowd<br/>\ncontrol. Even if your party could take all the mobs on<br/>\nat once, there&#39;ll be fewer chances and less downtime,<br/>\nif you keep the ones you aren&#39;t currently fighting,<br/>\nout of the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; keep charm handy in case your pet dies.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or your pet spell, same reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n Always warn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; your group that you<br/>\n&gt; might charm a monster BEFORE battle, and always warn<br/>\n&gt; them that the charmed<br/>\n&gt; creature will eventually come back for you and no<br/>\n&gt; taunting will get it off<br/>\n&gt; you so they have to watch and protect you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is true no taunting will get it off of you, that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat blur, and/or mesmerize are for. I tell my party<br/>\njust to keep an eye out, and let me handle it. Tashan,<br/>\nColor Flux, back up, Mesmerize. Works every time,<br/>\nwell, usually :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet them<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; also know how mesmerize<br/>\n&gt; works so they dont attack stunned creatures<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A must in every party. I try to simplify it for the<br/>\nstupid warriors in the group :) I tell them all to use<br/>\n/assist and never target a mob on their own. I pick<br/>\nout &lt;insert name of tanktype who has some brains&gt;<br/>\nto be the targetter, he&#39;s the only one who is allowed<br/>\nto target a mob, everyone else must assist him. Leaves<br/>\nme free to do my thing :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 9) One big life saver: do not panic! most<br/>\n&gt; spellcasting class have one thing<br/>\n&gt; to do when some monster start pounding on you: RUN!<br/>\n&gt; but not us! Stay calm!<br/>\n&gt; if you&#39;re under 2 bubs of hp you&#39;ll die if you run<br/>\n&gt; anyway. cast root ( fast<br/>\n&gt; to cast ) right after an attack, back off, cast<br/>\n&gt; mesmerize and then RUN LIKE<br/>\n&gt; HELL. That saved me a million times.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d agree with everything you have said here, except<br/>\nfor the last &quot;RUN LIKE HELL&quot; part. Panic is useless,<br/>\nan enchanter who shows fear is a dead enchanter. I&#39;d<br/>\nlike to point out, that in most cases, once a creature<br/>\nhas been mesmerized it won&#39;t come back after you, so<br/>\nrunning isn&#39;t really necessary. Be prudent and back<br/>\noff to a place you feel safe at, but no need to be too<br/>\nworried.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 10) explore to find nice hunting areas suitable for<br/>\n&gt; your level and close to<br/>\n&gt; a zone. One of my favorites recently has been<br/>\n&gt; lavastorm mountains, near the<br/>\n&gt; najena entrance. Lots of xp, lots of loot, and a<br/>\n&gt; very close zone point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Haven&#39;t been there, sounds like fun. Though your<br/>\ninsistence on zoning sounds like you might rather be a<br/>\nwizard. They do more damage you know, and most of the<br/>\nones I&#39;ve met enjoy waiting for zones to load as much<br/>\nas you sound like you do. MOST of the time, you don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to zone, we are one of the few classes who can<br/>\nsay that, if not the only.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 11) Ah! I forgot! USE THE LURE METHOD. Do not run<br/>\n&gt; into mob, make it come to<br/>\n&gt; you at a safe point, even if you have to run 30s<br/>\n&gt; with it on your tail before<br/>\n&gt; you get there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In a party this is pretty much usually the case<br/>\nanyways in my experience. If you&#39;re soloing however,<br/>\ncasting minor illusion will help keep any unwanted<br/>\nmobs from being too interested about the bag and the<br/>\nbear fighting each other :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 12) play with the mouse! arrow keys dont allow to<br/>\n&gt; turn around quickly enough<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No comment, as I stuck my nose in to talk about<br/>\nenchanters.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; my 12 cents,<br/>\n&gt; Skara<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Finally in response to the post that mentioned getting<br/>\nkicked by blues, here&#39;s how to solo a yellow. :) Not<br/>\nthe only way btw, just one of the safest.<br/>\n<br/>\nPet up, all buffs on, find a lone yellow, take your<br/>\ntime at this, better to be sure it&#39;s just one, than to<br/>\npull several yellows on your butt. No undead, not for<br/>\nthis tactic anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nTashan<br/>\nback up once attacked, let pet into the fight.<br/>\n&lt; be quick here, you don&#39;t want the pet to die if you<br/>\ncan help it &gt;<br/>\nChoke, or best DoT you have<br/>\nFear<br/>\nrun behind whacking it for a while, then back off<br/>\nbefore fear wears off, pet&#39;s still going at it.<br/>\nTashan<br/>\nWait til the instant the mob turns on your pet again.<br/>\nChoke<br/>\nFear<br/>\nat this point take stock because your mana will be<br/>\nkind of low, if you really don&#39;t think this is going<br/>\nwell, now is the time to run, while it&#39;s currently<br/>\nrunning from you. Most of the time, things should be<br/>\npretty smooth up til now, here&#39;s where you start<br/>\ntaking a few chances.<br/>\nIf you decide to stick it out, remember to always keep<br/>\nthat last bubble for a final mesmerize or two if the<br/>\nfirst is resisted, you should have taken little or no<br/>\ndamage yet, pet might be down a bit, especially if you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t quite time it right, but the mob will be down a<br/>\nlot, and you still have that DoT working away at its<br/>\nhp&#39;s.<br/>\nRun behind it whacking it, if you have a little mana<br/>\nleft over, give it a chaotic feedback brainsmoldering<br/>\nkick, and then wade in and start taking the brunt of<br/>\nthe damage when the fear wears off, circling around so<br/>\nyour pet&#39;s still hitting it in the back.<br/>\nBy now it should be dead.<br/>\nIf, however, you take more than half damage, cast<br/>\nmesmerize, stop attacking, it&#39;ll turn on your pet,<br/>\nback way up, look at it&#39;s health, chances are very<br/>\ngood that if it isn&#39;t dead yet, it soon will be. Throw<br/>\na final spell at it to finish it off, wade in and give<br/>\nit those last couple whacks, or if you have neither<br/>\nthe hp, mana, or backbone left, finally run to a<br/>\ngaurd, chances are it&#39;ll be so damaged it won&#39;t be<br/>\nable to keep up with you. Keep that last bit of mana<br/>\naround for a final mesmerize if it can though, just in<br/>\ncase.<br/>\nFinally if it still isn&#39;t dead, is running after you<br/>\nand hitting you, your pet has died, and the gaurd or<br/>\nzone is too far away, face the mob.<br/>\nDon&#39;t attack, mesmerize. interrupted. mesmerize.<br/>\ninterrupted. mesmerize.<br/>\na &lt;mob&gt; has been mesmerized.<br/>\nGo find a safe place to rest, do a quick med and cast<br/>\nminor illusion, think about how you timed everything,<br/>\nwhat you could have done differently and try it again<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that was a worse case scenario soloing a yellow<br/>\nmob. In most cases, after the second round of Choke,<br/>\nFear, whack away at it&#39;s back, it&#39;ll be dead right<br/>\naround the time when the second Fear runs out. For a<br/>\nblue mob, the first round should be plenty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is for level 12 to 15, haven&#39;t gotten to 16 yet.<br/>\nFor level 4 to 11 substitute Suffocating Sphere for<br/>\nChoke, and cast it a bit more often, everything else<br/>\nshould be about the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Eain Bankins [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eain@...\">eain@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, May 20, 1999 11:44 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] To Franck<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Eain Bankins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eain@...\">eain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wanderer CommonWealth wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Wanderer CommonWealth &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wanderercw@...\">wanderercw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Practice try diffrent things,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I got my ultimate one at times i can handle things<br/>\n&gt; red<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to me.
