As I stated in a previous post,<br/>\n&gt;sell the items for what they are worth, not what it costs to make them. I<br/>\n&gt;have seen flesh bands, which are loot-only items that give +2 to strength,<br/>\n&gt;sell regularly for 15-20p. That would be stretching it for the rings we<br/>\n&gt;could make, but I would suggest a minimum of 7p for the items that add 2 to<br/>\n&gt;stats.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
