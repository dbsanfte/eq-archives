Apparently a more expensive type of metal must be<br/>\n&gt; used to get magic jewelry out of the above stones.<br/>\n&gt; Below is a short list of the magic jewelry that I have created using<br/>\n&gt; enchanted silver.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Jade           = Jaded Silver Ring,<br/>\n&gt; Effect: MANA +5<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Pearl           = Silvered Pearl Ring,<br/>\n&gt; Effect: VS POISON +4<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Topaz         = Topaz Silver Necklace,<br/>\n&gt; Effect: VS DISEASE +4<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also I was wondering why there are four slots in the jewelry kit.  So I<br/>\n&gt; briefly tried a couple attempts using multiple stones.  Since both<br/>\nattempts<br/>\n&gt; were unsuccesful and this type of experimenting is expensive I<br/>\ndiscontinued<br/>\n&gt; this experiment until later.  These are the failed attempts:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Malachite + 1 Lapis Lazuli = &quot;These<br/>\n&gt; combinations and quantities  of items fail to combine to produce<br/>\nanything.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; 1 Bar of Silver + 1 Lapis Lazuli + 1 Turquoise = &quot;These combinations and<br/>\n&gt; quantities of items fail to combine to produce anything.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anyone can add to this list, please feel free.<br/>\n&gt; Also, if anyone can tell me how the skill cap is calculated for jewelcraft<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; would like to know, I have a level 14 Enchanter who has a 30 in<br/>\njewelcraft.<br/>\n&gt; After hitting 30 my skill has not risen even after numerous attempts to<br/>\n&gt; raise it.
