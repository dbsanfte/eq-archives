It&#39;s<br/>\ninsane green mob&#39;s should resist at all, let alone what we deal with after<br/>\nthe patch. So let them know, tell em you want it the way it was. <br/>\nFYI, they also reduced the damage (to mana) from mana sieve GREATLY! Before<br/>\nthe patch, it would totally drain a lvl 39 wizard to out of mana. Now, it<br/>\ntakes a total of 4 cast to do the same. Also, the effect would last 3 to 5<br/>\nmin. preventing them from meditating in that time. Now they can meditate<br/>\nright off. Once again, these changes were not announced, therefor a bug and<br/>\nif not, it should be changed back to the way it was, or least made stronger<br/>\nthan it is after the patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTelan Ka`Rlaah</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
