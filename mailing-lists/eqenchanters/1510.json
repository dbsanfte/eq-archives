What I ve seen recently is a strange behavior in some skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that the combat skill is maxed at (level +1) * 3, and the magic skills at (level+1) * 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about Offense and Defense ? Those are important, and if you neglect them you will be very sorry at higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ve seen the following from lvl 10 to lvl 13:<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel 10: Defense 45<br/>\nlevel 11: Defense 48<br/>\nlevel 12: Defense 51<br/>\nlevel 13: Defense 54<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, these numbers would indicate a (level+5) * 3<br/>\n<br/>\nI cant really believe this. Are we really that weak in defense ? At higher levels every critter will hit us for max damage. If somebody knows if this is correct, please reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the Mobs have (level+1) * 5 and we have only 3, this would be dissapointing.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
