You could do a 3 person group pretty good in there.  Cleric,<br/>\nyourself and a ranger is nice for snare and melee damage.  Also for tracking<br/>\nsome of those rare spawns.  A few nice pieces there, Runed Lava Pendant, Imp<br/>\nSkin Gloves, Obsidian Hoop (3 Int 3agil and some AC I think).  Also Unrest<br/>\nTower and bar could be nice IF you can find a few good people to group with<br/>\nas it can be quite a challenge if your group does not know what they are<br/>\ndoing.  The bar has the 2ac 5 charisma earrings there, very nice I still use<br/>\n1 at lvl 53.  Well good luck and lets keep the msg&#39;s coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Dan&#39;s path [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danspath@...\">danspath@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 31, 2000 2:27 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Hunting at 25<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a question then. I&#39;ve been groving from 20 to 25 in the lake of ill<br/>\nomen, easy exp, I only die now when...well, I haven&#39;t died in quiet a while!<br/>\nThe down side is...bored. Ran a shadow knight from 1-8 just to take a break.<br/>\nTonight my lv 25 enchanter will be at Castle Mistmoore for the Halloween<br/>\nbash (Our guild, the Nameless of Norath, on the nameless server, is hosting<br/>\na server wide raid).  I need somewhere interesting and good for growth to<br/>\nhunt. But with enough people to not spend a long time standing around<br/>\nlooking for a group. Should I stay in Castle Mistmoore? Or go else where? Or<br/>\nwhat?<br/>\n<br/>\nVroc, Enchanter on the Nameless<br/>\n_____________________<br/>\n&quot;The more I learn, o, the less I know<br/>\nFriend or foe?
