I have heard a lot of arguments for<br/>\nconjuration over alteration, but I am quite happy with alteration. I&#39;ve been<br/>\nin Lower Guk and Sol B almost exclusively since I hit level 34 and the main<br/>\ntime I go low on mana is when I am doing buffs, almost all alterations. The<br/>\nonly time with good groups I go low on mana fighting is when 5 or 6 critters<br/>\nget pulled, keeping them under control does take a fair amount of mana. Most<br/>\ngroups evac or die in Lower Guk when they pull that many and don&#39;t have a<br/>\ngood chanter, I can settle for using 80% of my mana versus maybe 60% if I<br/>\nhad specialized in conjuration to keep the medding time down when I throw<br/>\n500+ mana buffing. Downtime is what kills rate of experience, and I have yet<br/>\nto have a fight where I had to go OOM or close to where the other casters<br/>\nweren&#39;t as bad off or worse than I was.<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi, level 41  ~ Hand of Chaos ~ , CT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Fri, 23 Jun 2000 22:34:42 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;James&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Level 20 HELP!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok where do I specialize in.
