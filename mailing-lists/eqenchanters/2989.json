I felt like such a loot hound when I kept asking what<br/>\ndoes this one drop what does this one drop.  I think I will print up a list<br/>\nbefore I go.  I hate asking all the time, dont guess I need to know just<br/>\ncurious.  I was reading the boards about the Enchanter robe and Absor was<br/>\nsaying that he didnt think the robe was supose to use a Peridot when you<br/>\ncasted and he was going to &quot;look into it.&quot;  I hope so  I wish our robe would<br/>\ncast something useful that we would never have to mem again. <br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: S.

I have went twice <br/>\nin the<br/>\n&gt;   last week and stayed for 12 hours once and about 8 hours another <br/>\ntime.  Only<br/>\n&gt;   saw two caster items drop (got both of them btw =P) a pair of <br/>\nEnchanter<br/>\n&gt;   gloves 5ac , 9int, 9agil, 35mana , 2vs all except magic which is <br/>\n1vs and a<br/>\n&gt;   belt 4ac 40hps 40mana.  But to spend 20 hours in a plane and only <br/>\nsee 2<br/>\n&gt;   (TWO!) pieces of caster gear drop is pathetic.  While I was there <br/>\nI saw<br/>\n&gt;   countless pieces of Cleric and Warrior pieces drop.  Anyone else <br/>\nseeing this<br/>\n&gt;   as well?  This place is really big and maybe my groups are just <br/>\nnot pulling<br/>\n&gt;   the right mobs or we are not in the right area I have no idea.  <br/>\nJust seemed<br/>\n&gt;   a bit strange to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Mu<br/>\n&gt;   Enchanter 54th Season<br/>\n&gt;   Tunare Server<br/>\n&gt;   -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Melaniel [mailto:online.games@e...]<br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, November 01, 2000 6:12 AM<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] GU Comics - Daily OnLine Comic Strip <br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt;   Woody Hearn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   On Tue, 31 Oct 2000 20:44:54 +0100, &quot;(Allayana)&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   &lt;sarastro@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Heya all,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Well, me too was wondering about the lifelyness of this group! <br/>\nBut finally<br/>\n&gt;   I<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;got soms mail.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;I am also new here, so I just want to say hello too.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Safe huntings,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Allayana<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Pleased to meet everyone.
