In High Pass Hold a vendor<br/>\nsells the animation spells for levels 8 and up.  This is the only place to<br/>\nget them.  Just like Neriak is a tough place for a high elf, High Pass is<br/>\ntough for a Dark elf.  You might want to pick up two of those spells when<br/>\nyou go to High Pass and then offer a Dark elf a trade for enchant silver.<br/>\nIf I was a Dark elf on a regular server, I&#39;d charge you 15 plat to get that<br/>\nspell for you.  On the hell known as Tallon Zek, you&#39;d never get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrexia (TZ Level 2 woohoo!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
