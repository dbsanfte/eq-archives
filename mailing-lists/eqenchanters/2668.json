At level 8(?) you will get Illusion Dark Elf.  This will make them like<br/>\nyou enough not to squish you. If you can&#39;t wait until then, you can invis<br/>\nyourself and run quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  You can only have one pet at a time. Animated or charmed.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Charmed pets do follow commands.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Not sure what you are asking here.  The spell duration is short, maybe<br/>\n15 secs or less.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  Your pet stands on what you are looting because it is so dumb that it<br/>\ncan not understand simple commands like &quot;guard here&quot;.  It will always<br/>\nhappen.  On a reality note, your pet will follow invisible &quot;pathing&quot;.<br/>\nExperiment with where you stand until you are able to loot with out your pet<br/>\nbeing in the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  Agnostic is the BEST choice you can make as an enchanter.  Choosing any<br/>\nreligion will be a hindrance later on.  <br/>\n<br/>\n7.  Practice &quot;timing&quot; your activities.  Use a second hand to know how long<br/>\nyour Mez line of spells lasts.  Be aware that every 6 seconds, the checks to<br/>\nsee if you are meditating or not and adjusts your mana bar appropriately.<br/>\nThis means that you can be medding during a battle, get up cast a spell, sit<br/>\ndown and med again, and if you were fast enough, not loose any mana<br/>\nregeneration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Randy Rustin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cyberwulf@...\">cyberwulf@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, May 27, 2000 10:51 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] Spell Quests...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 5th level High Elf enchanter and have a few questions.
