But I didn&#39;t remember the name of the guys that made a new char and<br/>\nwere not online with the old in my list, and there for I never saw the name<br/>\nwhen typing /friends all... and did not remember, as well there were some<br/>\ntypo names in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk what i did is: open the file eqoptio0ns1.opt with notepad, and on the<br/>\nsecond very long line you see all the friends names, and i took notes. I do<br/>\nnot advice to edit the names, as the files formate is binary, and if you do,<br/>\nthe file will be probably corrupt.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you can write them down for later ingame editing, to regain free slots.<br/>\nAnd - if you transfer this file to the everquest directory of a second<br/>\ninstallation, you will probably have your friendlist and so on there as<br/>\nwell. I did not try this, and if you do make copys of the files before<br/>\noverwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThw character specific data is probaply in the file &lt;charname&gt;.opt -<br/>\nsocialbuttons, hotkeylist... everything that changes with the char. And you<br/>\ncan try to copy this file as well to the directory of a nother installation<br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe files are binary, but the format is simple, and it shouldn&#39;t be a great<br/>\nthing to make an offgame optioneditor to manipulate the files. As the data<br/>\nincluded is not vital in the sense, that you could cheat something by<br/>\nchanging your friendslist, I don`&#39;t think Verant would oppose such a simple<br/>\ntool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI already /bug &#39;ed the problem with editing the friendslist when you forgot<br/>\nthe old names, and people are no longer online to see the name, but there<br/>\nwas no reaction from Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the file dgb.dat you have a logfile of your logins and logouts, a tool<br/>\ncan easyly analyze these lines vor you offgame.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn guilds.dat (binary) the are all Guildnames in the game listed, and<br/>\ncharnames, not shure if guildmasters... should be analyzed.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe file equname.txt contains your station loginname.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk thats what i can say from a short look, Perhaps someone likes to take out<br/>\nhis compiler, and creates a nices offgame minitool to view an edit this data<br/>\nconveniently.<br/>\n<br/>\nNiniel<br/>\never lvl 11 darkelf enchantress from solosek ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Urspr∩┐╜ngliche Nachricht-----<br/>\nVon: HiFi Review &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hifireview@...\">hifireview@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nAn: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDatum: Donnerstag, 6.
