We were getting kinda bored,<br/>\nso I challenged him to a duel to pass the time, see what his spells<br/>\ndid, etc.,. We were messing around for about 15 or 20 minutes, he<br/>\neventually casts fear on me and I start running to the Ice Giants<br/>\n(this isn&#39;t the bug, but I&#39;ll share anyway), then mezzes me before<br/>\nI hit them, scaring the pants off me. When the charm wore off, I<br/>\nwalked up to him meditating and gave him a round kick to the head.<br/>\nHe had it coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, so then we start messing around with charm and beguile and<br/>\nwhat-not. He charms me and walks me around and makes me say stupid<br/>\nthings, then he tries `/pet get lost&#39;. I find myself at the character<br/>\nselection screen with my Monk in Halas. I log back in and have lost<br/>\nhalf a bubble of XP, have no items, and it sure looks like I&#39;ve<br/>\ndied and gone to Halas. DOH!<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, when he issued that command I slashed myself (interesting,<br/>\nsince I&#39;m a monk) for 32000 points of damage (beware my nails of<br/>\ndoom!). The duel was ended with my untimely death, and Raloon was<br/>\n/highly/ apologetic. But I can&#39;t really blame him, who&#39;d have<br/>\nthought that would happen? It doesn&#39;t happen on NPCs after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;d been a little more willing to lose some more XP we would<br/>\nhave tried Reclaim Energy on me next. It&#39;d be kinda funny if he<br/>\ncould InstaKill me and replenish his mana at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there you go, my tale of woe, and now you know, never have an<br/>\nenchanter for a foe.<br/>\n<br/>\nArchi Tuttle<br/>\nMonk at Large<br/>\nBard at Nightschool<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
