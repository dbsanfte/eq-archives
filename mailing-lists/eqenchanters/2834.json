I got resisted on Enthrall about 10% of the time, maybe 20%. I<br/>\nhad two groups in Disco room and I was the only enchanter. Died once when we<br/>\nhad a 5 pull, but handled them long enough for all but one of the two<br/>\nclerics to survive. That was the only mishapp in about 4 hours. Ilis<br/>\nresisted a bit, but that was the only high one. Some needed to leave, so I<br/>\ntook a group to the zone out and we fought there for 4 more hours or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe monk would pull to the corridor near zone out, and we&#39;d pull them into<br/>\nthe room. A couple of times, he got 4 casters and they were messin up his<br/>\nFD. Instead of allowing him to die, I hit em with AE Mez. Did this about 5<br/>\ntimes. Each time, I about died, but never lost a member. I never once tried<br/>\nto charm tho. Might try that next time, but I&#39;d rather mez and let the tanks<br/>\ntake em out when they can get to em.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharming is fun tho, worth a death or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and my afternoon in Sebilis, I got half my level done in 47...2.5<br/>\nbubbles of xp. And that&#39;s gropued with everyone else 51-54...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dysin<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jouleblu Diamond [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:opm3@...\">opm3@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: August 09, 2000 2:55 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Charming the the Beast<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been hunting in Sebelis some and have some ideas to share on <br/>\ncharms.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst let me say my tactics are for sure not perfect or to be used in <br/>\nall situations but I think they are better than the ones I used when <br/>\nI started.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn multi pulls of say 3 to 4 froggies in Sebelis.  I use a Fasination <br/>\nright off.  I ask the tanks to attack any that are not mezd or it did <br/>\nnot stick to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf more than one is not mezed, often they all are mezed, but <br/>\nsometimes one or two resist.  I recast fascination.  Let them start <br/>\nto work on the mob fist selected.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I try to pick out a non caster type from the remaing mobs (non <br/>\nwiz or shammy) and tash him and cast charm on him.  While I wait for <br/>\nthe fasinatioins to bust I root the mobs not charmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce it is broken I immediately cast dazzle on it or them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I tell my pet to attack the mob they are working on.  If not too <br/>\nlate i slow it.  But at minium i tash it.  I tash any remaining mobs <br/>\nand then med a tad.  Maybe suck some mana from target if he is caster <br/>\ntype.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharming the baddie being tanked or one of the ae mezed ones is a <br/>\ntactic I recommend on higher lvl baddies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find charm is almost an essential tool now.  I am very excited <br/>\nabout the new charm I will get at 53 and cannot wait)<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Jouleblu Diamond<br/>\n<br/>\n     52 Enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n          Knights of Loyalty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n              Cazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
