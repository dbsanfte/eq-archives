Any<br/>\nsuggestions as to acquiring Enchant Silver on Tallon/Vallon Zek?  I am<br/>\n*not* going to make a mule character, but, is it possible, at lvl 8, to<br/>\nuse invisibility to sneak into Neriak, purchase the spell, and get out?<br/>\nIs it advisable to wait  until level 12 and the DE illusion?  Or, is<br/>\nneither approach safe, and should I just try to find a dark one willing<br/>\nto betray their race for some platinum?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nTry ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
