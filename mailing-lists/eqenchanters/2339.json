Read first on EQvault but<br/>\ncopied from <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a> :)  Personally I find most<br/>\ninteresting the change to &#39;DDD&#39;.  It shall be interesting to see if this<br/>\nspell makes its way back into peoples hotkey bank... imho it seems like more<br/>\nof a PvP spell now (mana drain on Mobs?  whats the point?)<br/>\n<br/>\nyup nothing &#39;nerfed&#39; though, unless you were really attatched to &#39;sense<br/>\nmagic&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg<br/>\n<br/>\n- Mana costs for enchanting metals has been reduced.<br/>\n- Dyn&#39;s Dizzying Draught has been altered slightly. It now reduces AC,<br/>\nAgility, and drains mana as well as spinning the target.<br/>\n- Blanket of Forgetfullness has received a minor upgrade.<br/>\n- &quot;Reoccurring Amnesia&quot; has had its casting time reduced.<br/>\n- &quot;Yaulp&quot; and &quot;Augmentation&quot; should now stack.<br/>\n- &quot;Sense Magic&quot; has been replaced in all cases by the &quot;True North&quot; spell. If<br/>\nyou have already inscribed the &quot;Sense Magic&quot; spell, the spell icon will now<br/>\nautomatically reflect &quot;True North&quot;.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
