See, mesmerization uses conjuration<br/>\nfor some reason.  I generally start a fight with mes, not that I need to use<br/>\nit, but just for the practice, as well as the free debuffs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as pierce and 2hb, do both.  You have the intelligence, and since it<br/>\nonly goes up a lousy 3 points a level, you can keep both at max fairly<br/>\neasily.<br/>\n<br/>\nSave those training points for specilization (when implemented), research,<br/>\nand any trade skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all, I think you have more than enough points to prime evocation or 2hb<br/>\nsome, it depends whether you want to take the time to max skills through<br/>\nuse, or use the points for a quick fix.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Lews Therin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lewstherin2@...\">lewstherin2@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 06, 1999 10:00 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Skill Points<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lews Therin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lewstherin2@...\">lewstherin2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just have a few questions regarding skill points and their allocation.<br/>\n  How have all of you spent your practices? I am lvl 8 now, and up to this <br/>\npoint have maxed out my Jewelcraft (21), spent one on Meditate, one on <br/>\nPiercing (at lvl 1 a mistake I know), and have saved the rest.<br/>\n  My spellcasting skills are all maxed except for Conjuration and Evocation.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Have any of you maxed out your Conjuration skill?  I just don&#39;t cast my <br/>\nanimations THAT often. I spent over 40 daggers just creating Pendril&#39;s <br/>\nAnimation and then Reclaiming Energy immediately and my Conjuration skill is<br/>\n<br/>\nstill only 25 (as opposed to 45).  Is this a problem? Does skill affect <br/>\nanything other than fizzles? Will my animation be stronger? I guess I&#39;m just<br/>\n<br/>\nwondering if its worth dumping some points into. As for Evocation, I can <br/>\njust now get Chaotic Feedback and so far have a skill of a whopping 3.  The <br/>\nmana cost is just too much for me to use it extensively now, so my skill <br/>\nrise is mired in slow motion. Is this worth skill points, or will increased <br/>\nmana levels later on allow me to raise it for free?  Also, my 2h blunt skill<br/>\n<br/>\nis only a 5, but I have been doing well with my Giant Snake Fang thus far.  <br/>\nDoes piercing become inferior to the point of uselessness later on? Seems <br/>\nlike everyone and their dog has a staff.  I like my speedy attacks and hate <br/>\nto waste any points, but this is another area that could use help.<br/>\nI had originally wanted to save my points for Research, Specialization and <br/>\nwhatever Languages I would need for Research, but now think I might need to <br/>\nuse SOME of them at least before then.<br/>\nI know there&#39;s no hard and fast rules, just wondering what everyone else&#39;s <br/>\nthinking was, and what they may have done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVendril     lvl 8 Enchanter         Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
