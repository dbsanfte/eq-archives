Here&#39;s some text from &quot;Casters Realm&quot;:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you start early without much money you will want to max your skill to 21<br/>\n&gt; at the guild with practise points.  After this you have to make items to<br/>\n&gt; raise skill.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In other words you can&#39;t put any skill points into Jewelcraft after skill<br/>\n&gt; level 21 even if you have points to spare and money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Research training questions:<br/>\n&gt; This is taken from a research info site, &quot;Mythiran Tower&quot;:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mythiran.com/\">http://www.mythiran.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Q: What&#39;s the deal with research at level 16? It only allowed me to put ONE<br/>\n&gt; practice into the Research skill when I made level 16! How can I improve<br/>\n&gt; this skill?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A:Sorry, folks, but at level 16 through level 18 you are only allowed that<br/>\n&gt; ONE practice. Something to do with that spell circle. But never fear! Once<br/>\n&gt; you break level 19 you can put 4 or 5 in there (depending upon your magic<br/>\n&gt; class), then once at 20, the skies the limit...<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, there is a way to practice your research w/o using real components:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mythiran.everquest.gamestats.com/practice.html\">http://mythiran.everquest.gamestats.com/practice.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hope this helps,<br/>\n&gt; Shawn<br/>\n&gt; Bertt Earneeless, Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jenni [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 29, 1999 3:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] Jeweler Questions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Jenni &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freya@...\">freya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Bahir,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m also new to the list, but I might be able to help a bit with the jewlrey<br/>\n&gt; questions.  More feedback is welcome :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can add more points into your Jewlrey Craft skill after the base 21<br/>\n&gt; points,<br/>\n&gt; but they&#39;ll cost you.  The skills list will show how much it will cost to<br/>\n&gt; increase the skill (given you have points to spend on them).  I personally<br/>\n&gt; prefer to increase my jewlrey skill by practicing making jewlrey instead of<br/>\n&gt; spending the money on skill points.  That would be the reason I don&#39;t add<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; points to jewlrey anymore.  My skill is still low (only at 35), but actually<br/>\n&gt; making the jewlrey gives for getting the money you put into the skill back,<br/>\n&gt; instead of spending the money for the points, and not seeing the money<br/>\n&gt; back..<br/>\n&gt; Also, as an enchanter, money for making the jewlrey (or anything else for<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; matter :)  ) isn&#39;t too hard to come by if you&#39;re patient.  We are the only<br/>\n&gt; class that can complete the Stein of Mogguk quest easily, and the Stein is<br/>\n&gt; worth quite a bit of money, (I just sold mine for 250pp).  I&#39;ve run this<br/>\n&gt; quest<br/>\n&gt; twice now, and I&#39;m planning on doing it a few more times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure about the research question as I am only level 12 right now,<br/>\n&gt; but I<br/>\n&gt; have saved some of my practice points for research.  My question is this:<br/>\n&gt; Where do I find the pages for the research?  after days of hunting the<br/>\n&gt; dervishes in North Ro I picked up one page (24 of Tasarin&#39;s left side).  Are<br/>\n&gt; there any other places I might be able to pick these up quicker?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ezrae<br/>\n&gt; Dark Elf Enchantress of the 12th season<br/>\n&gt; Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rich Hitz wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Rich Hitz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rich.Hitz@...\">Rich.Hitz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am new to the list and have Jeweling questions for you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My questions involves training points.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; After you spend the max 21 points at the guild and you get to your next<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level can you put those 5 into your Jewel Craft skill?
