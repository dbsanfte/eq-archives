Trade skills do not max out by level.<br/>\n You can raise it as high as you can afford to practice with the tools<br/>\nof the trade.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor most trades there is som eorder in which you should do things, as<br/>\nyour skill will develop most cost effectively in this manner.  For<br/>\njewel craft you can get up to 2 skill points with each stone (with<br/>\nsilver), if you do them in order of cheapest to most expensive.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t note the whole list, as I started at skill of 21.  FOr skill<br/>\npoints 31 and 32, use carnelian, for points 33 and 34, use rose quartz,<br/>\nfor 35 and 36 use Amber, etc.  up to Black Pearl.  Then you should be<br/>\nable to start over with electrum.  I haven&#39;t gotten that far yet, so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you try to use a stone below your level, it tells you that that<br/>\nstone is too trivial for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ. of E&#39;ci<br/>\n--- Drew Silsby &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:asilsby1@...\">asilsby1@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Drew Silsby&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:asilsby1@...\">asilsby1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, I have been keeping track of different<br/>\n&gt; combinations of jewels and this<br/>\n&gt; is my list thus far in response to The Wanderer&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; post.<br/>\n&gt; All of the below were made with Enchanted Bar&#39;s of<br/>\n&gt; silver.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Malachite     =       <br/>\n&gt;  Silver Malachite Ring<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Labis Lazuli =        <br/>\n&gt; Silver Labis Lazuli<br/>\n&gt; Ring<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Turquoise     =       <br/>\n&gt;  Silver Turquois<br/>\n&gt; Bracelet<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Hematite      =       <br/>\n&gt;  Silver Hematite Ring<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Cat&#39;s Eye Agate = <br/>\n&gt; Silver Cat&#39;s Eye Necklace<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Bloodstone   =        <br/>\n&gt; Silver Bloodstone<br/>\n&gt; Earring<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Onyx             =    <br/>\n&gt;      Silver Onyx<br/>\n&gt; Bracelet<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Jasper          =     <br/>\n&gt;     Silver Jasper Ring<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Carnelian      =      <br/>\n&gt;   Silver Carnelian<br/>\n&gt; Wedding Ring<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Star Rose Quartz =<br/>\n&gt; Silver Rose Engagement Ring<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Amber          =      <br/>\n&gt;    Silver Amber Ring<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Notice even though I used enchanted siver for all of<br/>\n&gt; the above no magical<br/>\n&gt; jewelry was produced.  Apparently a more expensive<br/>\n&gt; type of metal must be<br/>\n&gt; used to get magic jewelry out of the above stones.<br/>\n&gt; Below is a short list of the magic jewelry that I<br/>\n&gt; have created using<br/>\n&gt; enchanted silver.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Jade           = Jaded<br/>\n&gt; Silver Ring,<br/>\n&gt; Effect: MANA +5<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Pearl           =<br/>\n&gt; Silvered Pearl Ring,<br/>\n&gt; Effect: VS POISON +4<br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Topaz         = Topaz<br/>\n&gt; Silver Necklace,<br/>\n&gt; Effect: VS DISEASE +4<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also I was wondering why there are four slots in the<br/>\n&gt; jewelry kit.  So I<br/>\n&gt; briefly tried a couple attempts using multiple<br/>\n&gt; stones.  Since both attempts<br/>\n&gt; were unsuccesful and this type of experimenting is<br/>\n&gt; expensive I discontinued<br/>\n&gt; this experiment until later.  These are the failed<br/>\n&gt; attempts:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Malachite + 1 Lapis<br/>\n&gt; Lazuli = &quot;These<br/>\n&gt; combinations and quantities  of items fail to<br/>\n&gt; combine to produce anything.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; 1 Bar of Silver + 1 Lapis Lazuli + 1 Turquoise =<br/>\n&gt; &quot;These combinations and<br/>\n&gt; quantities of items fail to combine to produce<br/>\n&gt; anything.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anyone can add to this list, please feel free.<br/>\n&gt; Also, if anyone can tell me how the skill cap is<br/>\n&gt; calculated for jewelcraft I<br/>\n&gt; would like to know, I have a level 14 Enchanter who<br/>\n&gt; has a 30 in jewelcraft.<br/>\n&gt; After hitting 30 my skill has not risen even after<br/>\n&gt; numerous attempts to<br/>\n&gt; raise it.
