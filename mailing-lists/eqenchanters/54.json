At least<br/>\n&gt; not yet.  I am having so much frustration with this class I am on the<br/>\nverge<br/>\n&gt; of not playing it for a while.  Here&#39;s the highlights:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.  Spells are not correctly implemented i.e.  Sentinel is a spell which<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; suppose to watch the area around an Enchanter while meditating,<br/>\n&gt; unfortunately it lasts only 2-3 seconds.<br/>\n&gt; 2. Even NPCs which are blue risky to me resist my spells (combat and<br/>\n&gt; enchantment) on a 50/50 basis.  Gambles do it even more frequently.<br/>\n&gt; 3. None of my spells ... not even enchanter only spells spells like<br/>\n&gt; Mesmorize and Soothe work on anything that is Tomb to me, they are<br/>\nresisted<br/>\n&gt; 100% of the time, making me worthless in large groups 50% of the time!<br/>\n&gt; 4. Current enchanter buff spells are a joke ... confirmed by many of my<br/>\n&gt; fellow enchanters whom have the same complaint.<br/>\n&gt; 5. 12th level animation spell does not always summon a 12th level<br/>\nanimation<br/>\n&gt; ... several times a 4th level pops in.<br/>\n&gt; 6. No current plans to add Weapon or Armor enchanting spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sigh, I just spent 20mins in an Enchanter chat room and had my worst fears<br/>\n&gt; confirmed.  Enchanters who are over 17th level were stating they still run<br/>\n&gt; into the same frustrations as they did when they were 8th level.  The old<br/>\n&gt; hold out &quot;if I can just make it to the next spell ranking&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt; do any good.  Every one of them had the same level of frustration as I.<br/>\nAll<br/>\n&gt; of them stated they had fallen behind their friends and guild members on a<br/>\n&gt; level basis even though they had put in several more hours of game play.<br/>\nA<br/>\n&gt; 21st level enchanter in the room, who just restarted as a cleric and was<br/>\n&gt; already 7th level, stated &quot;night and day difference&quot; between playing the<br/>\n&gt; different classes.  Now I am not complaing becuase I need to be a &quot;power<br/>\n&gt; character&quot;, but two somple facts remain: I cannot solo and groups benefit<br/>\n&gt; very little or, in the case of a large group fighting tomb monsters, not<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; all.  Without some enhanced buffing spells or newer combat spells I am<br/>\n&gt; afraid the majority of my contribution to the guild will be for magical<br/>\n&gt; jewelry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks, I needed to get this off my chest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aumaar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS Nekoj it looks like your experience in Beta 4 with Enchanters has only<br/>\n&gt; changed for the first 8 levels - my guess is they never play balanced<br/>\nafter<br/>\n&gt; that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for the perfect gift for a friend?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell them about ONElist&#39;s 115,000 free e-mail communities!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The Erudin Arcanium Mailing List<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Knowledge above all&quot; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
