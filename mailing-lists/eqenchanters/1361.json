Ouch!  10pp is what I&#39;ve been selling them for.....and until<br/>\n&gt; someone auctions a lower price, I had no problem getting that price.   It<br/>\n&gt; pains me greatly to see it happen...so I politely ask the vendors to raise<br/>\n&gt; the selling price a little....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fistlebane, rathe server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
