Killing other people is a very<br/>\n&gt;small part of EQ; the people on Non-pvp servers almost never have to atk<br/>\n&gt;another person. Hmm...now you can&#39;t use some spells on other people... So<br/>\n&gt;what? If its very important for you to be able to destroy other real people<br/>\n&gt;in combat, there are plenty of other games (like Quake) that let you do<br/>\n&gt;that, and you don&#39;t have to worry about your rocket launcher getting nerfed.<br/>\n&gt;I am surprised at how much grief these new changes have caused. After all,<br/>\n&gt;you can still charm NPCs, you can still color flux camps of monsters, you<br/>\n&gt;can still cast fear on that orc. Sure, that big bad ogre warrior might kick<br/>\n&gt;your butt in pvp. But when that warrior is in your group (which he most<br/>\n&gt;likely will be, as opposed to dueling u), he will be praying for your next<br/>\n&gt;spell as he watches the monster he is fighting rip him apart. Finally, you<br/>\n&gt;can still pvp. You can still win. Some classes can&#39;t pvp at all. Thus, my<br/>\n&gt;friends, I wish you good hunting and good luck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Garett &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:osmosis@...\">osmosis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Date: Friday, November 19, 1999 4:48 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] Latest nerf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Garett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:osmosis@...\">osmosis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;In case you hadn&#39;t noticed it yet, we&#39;ve also lost the ability to cast the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;color flux/shift/ect line of spells on other players.  hmmm... so that<br/>\n&gt;makes<br/>\n&gt;&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    1.
