Once I break up something into solo pulls<br/>\n&gt; (lately it&#39;s been Lord/AM/Hand in Lower Guk), which with a good group<br/>\n&gt; usually takes an hour (2 spawn cycles),  what am I supposed to do on the<br/>\n&gt; singles we&#39;re pulling for the next four hours? Yes I stun them for most of<br/>\n&gt; their short lifespan, but that&#39;s so little mana I can fit in a DD and still<br/>\n&gt; be back to full mana by the next pull. Besides, evoke is trailing behind my<br/>\n&gt; other skills (under 200 at level 44), I need to get work in on it when the<br/>\n&gt; situation can handle it. Any spell casters that get pulled must go down hard<br/>\n&gt; and ugly with DD&#39;s, after two stuns of course. If spell casting mobs get 2<br/>\n&gt; spells off on my group after the initial pull, I consider that I did a poor<br/>\n&gt; job on them. Never nuke early, never nuke often. And if you ever do get into<br/>\n&gt; a situation where&#39;s there&#39;s 2 enchanters grouped together (rare, but I have<br/>\n&gt; had it happen), one can do a little more nuking even. Enchanters are one of<br/>\n&gt; the most flexible of the spellcasters, we can buff, debuff, crowd control,<br/>\n&gt; and do damage, indirectly and directly. Know the situation and adapt to it.<br/>\n&gt; I will add that when I need buff, it&#39;s the damage spell that has it&#39;s slot<br/>\n&gt; taken by the buff spell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lozi ~Hand of Chaos~, CT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I mildly disagree that our DD&#39;s are not usefull in a group. Im not<br/>\n&gt; saying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; im a nuke happy enchanter, I know what my job is;  buffing, debuffing and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mezzing =) . There is no bigger thrill for me than pulling my party<br/>\n&gt; through<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an &quot;imposible&quot;  pull with skillfull mezzing and hearing them say &quot;You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ROCK!&quot;. However there are times in a group when your crowd control<br/>\n&gt; abilities<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are not needed. If  your loaded with mana and a mob is getting low on<br/>\n&gt; health<br/>\n&gt; &gt; why not toss a nuke in there to hurry things along? Other classes are more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; efficient at DD of course but often arent present in my groups, we tend to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be pretty melee oriented.  Use ALL of your abilities and stay flexible =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sandoz Pharmacueticals<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 42nd Enchanter of Torvonnilous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Proud officer of Requiem Despair<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
