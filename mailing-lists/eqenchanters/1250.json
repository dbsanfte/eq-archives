With big<br/>\nguilds, <br/>\neach character can hold one of those extra items and they can still sell<br/>\nthem at<br/>\nhigh rates.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I go with the restriction of only having 1 lore item deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Shawn Alley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ShawnA@...\">ShawnA@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;for a little bit are new characters that are totally buffed out with<br/>\n&gt;extremely high end magic weapons, magic items, and plate armor.  Is this<br/>\n&gt;wrong?  Depends on how you play the game and is probably fun for some<br/>\n&gt;people.  But I think much of the challenge goes out of the game.

The reasoning (for me<br/>\nanyway) is you play your main character<br/>\nand most likely its very painful cause your learning the areas and whatever<br/>\nelse.  There&#39;s<br/>\na sense of non-efficiency (if your a powergamer type).  Then the thought<br/>\nis, &quot;Man, if I could <br/>\ndo this all over again, it would be so much better and faster&quot;.  I think<br/>\nits kinda a silly thought<br/>\n(even though I think that sometimes), cause YOUR CHARACTER IS ALREADY<br/>\nTHERE! Why would I want to<br/>\ndo it over again?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the challenge is perfecting the PROCESS of getting to a certain level<br/>\nand not the actual level and doing it <br/>\nthe most efficient way possible to become a &#39;master of that game&#39; type of<br/>\nplayer.  Then you could say, &quot;I got my guy to level 20 in a DAY!!&quot;, and<br/>\nother powergamer people would repect you and be in awe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAzboklin the enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nScott Murawski                              <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott.murawski@...\">scott.murawski@...</a><br/>\nApplications Speech Engineer                          (voice) 212-425-7600 <br/>\nSpeechWorks Intl, Inc.
