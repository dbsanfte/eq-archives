If you are invisible, still keep away<br/>\nfrom any harmful creature.  Instead, when you want to have a minimal chance<br/>\nthat you will be killed, cast it and hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use invisibility to travel through Highpass Hold, and across East Karana<br/>\nwhen I don&#39;t want to encounter some of the nasties in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to duration, it can last from a few seconds to several minutes.  I have<br/>\nhad it last over 20 minutes, and it usually lasts from about 5 minutes to 10<br/>\nminutes.  If a creature spots you and is unfriendly, then invis will not<br/>\nstop it from hitting you.  Once spotted, and on that creatures hate list,<br/>\nneither invis nor minor illusion will stop you from being attacked.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, all in all it is a useful spell.  If you must travel in hated lands,<br/>\nby all means use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\nLoreweaver of the Eldritch Collective<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: DeGirolami, Franck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:degirolami@...\">degirolami@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: Eqenchanters (E-mail) &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, April 20, 1999 5:51 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Invisibility<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;DeGirolami, Franck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:degirolami@...\">degirolami@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I gave up a level 16 dark-elf necro because their invisibility spell (<br/>\n&gt;gather shadows ) was very unreliable. One sad evening, coming back from a<br/>\n&gt;very long quest that brought me to Kerra Island and South Karana, I got<br/>\n&gt;hacked multiple times in Riverdale losing about 4 bubs of xp because my<br/>\n&gt;invis wore off on me randomly.

Yesterday, I found out<br/>\n&gt;that this invisibility spell is as bad as gather shadows as a %$#%^^%$<br/>\n&gt;griffin nuked me a few seconds after I cast invisibility. Since then, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;noticed the same kind on unreliability...but only since I made level 8...I<br/>\n&gt;might be wrong.<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, I would like to know how&#39;s the enchanter&#39;s invisibility like at<br/>\n&gt;level 16 or 20 or more.
