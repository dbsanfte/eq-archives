Some of these<br/>\n  questions are probably asked often, so if there&#39;s a FAQ or other source<br/>\n  that answers them, please feel free to point me there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  1) Is there any armor available that gives the look of plate, chain, or at<br/>\n  least leather?  I&#39;d like to be a little less naked when taking the form of<br/>\n  a class that doesn&#39;t have robe graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You may looked naked but you still get the stats of the armor even if it can&#39;t bee seen. I for one would not give up my Oracle robe for any thing. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n  2) Do any of the illusions provide racial abilities (wood elf forage, dark<br/>\n  elf hide, etc. in addition to sight improvements?<br/>\n<br/>\n  From what I got from Verant is that all illisions give enhancments but not all are noticable. I&#39;m trying to get make a list of what each illusion does but it&#39;s har, nobody seems to have been interested enough to try to find out before. I&#39;m working on it now. If any of you know some attributes please let me know .=)<br/>\n<br/>\n  3) How does Alliance work?  Does it always raise one faction level (e.g.<br/>\n  dubious to apprehensive)?  Does it decrease faction with negative faction<br/>\n  groups (e.g. if I cast it on a deathfist orc, will it make me less liked<br/>\n  by the commons residents)?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  It will increase your faction with one group but not decrease it with another.<br/>\n<br/>\n  4) At what level can I go into the evil cities?  My gnome necro can go<br/>\n  into Neriak - can my agnostic enchanter go there in gnome form?  Can I go<br/>\n  into Grobb or Oggok in dark elf form, or must I wait for ogre/troll form?<br/>\n<br/>\n  When in doubt try it out. =) I always went invisible then targeted a guard of the city I wanted to get into, then I&#39;d go way out and away from guard, drop my invisible, and then I would con. After all that if I was kos I would pick an illusion and put it on and con again. This has always worked for me. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for any advice to a newbie illusionist.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You&#39;re welcome. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Signed<br/>\n  Zytreen Matrixmistress, Gnome Enchantress, Senior Officer of the Soldiers of Brell<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you&#39;re not on Bertoxxulous then you&#39;re not in the real Norrath. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
