They now seem to last more than long enough to do whatever<br/>\nyou need to do under them.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a few general questions about the Illusion spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I remember before the patch that extended the length of time an illusion<br/>\n&gt; stayed in place, it lasted a few minutes. How long do they last now?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>1. WTH: doesn&#39;t seem to be as great as it used to be, but I still find it<br/>\nuseful. I find it more effective than root when one or more people need to<br/>\nback off from melee. You must remember to have your tanks kick instead of<br/>\nbash when you cast this (which is the main problem because your animation<br/>\nwill always bash). And if you&#39;re fighting a caster, you can still WTH till<br/>\nit drops.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. These also stack with choke. Again, better for PvP, but they do drop the<br/>\nprobablity of a MOB hitting for max damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.Enthrall lasts ALOT longer than mezmerize. Up to 50 seconds, depending on<br/>\nMOB level, ones 25 and over it seems to last a shorter time on.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. The speed boost does not rise as you advance in levels, but the duration<br/>\nof the spell does. The medition boost of clarity does raise with levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to enthrall first, tashani, pace, disempower, meditate, then choke it<br/>\nas it comes in. At 18 with a necro or a magician partner, you can start<br/>\ndoing rooks in S Karana. At 22 (it&#39;s iffy at 21) an enchanter and a necro<br/>\ncan do harriers. Then at 23, it&#39;s lumberjack time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi, ~Hand of Chaos~, CT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Whirl till you Hurl - is this useful at all anymore ? I heard that it<br/>\n&gt; used to be a 15 second guaranteed stun and enchanters did nothing but<br/>\n&gt; whirl all day, and now it&#39;s nerfed to uselessness.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Disempower and Enfeeblement. I cast both on myself, and lost 54 str and<br/>\n&gt; 71 agi. I can see that I can waste a tank in PvP with these spells but are<br/>\n&gt; they useful against MOBS ? Do MOBs have str, agi and other stats, or just<br/>\n&gt; ac and atk ? Currently I do not use these spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. I&#39;m still using mesmerize. Why is enthrall better ?
