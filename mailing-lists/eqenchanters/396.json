I<br/>\nhave also noticed that when I cast the illusion Human ( I am a High Elf ) I<br/>\nlose my ability to see in the dark.  With these observations in hand, am I<br/>\nright to assume that we gain the abilities of our illusion as well?  I am<br/>\ncurious to know if my Wood-elf illusion will give me the ability to<br/>\n&quot;forage&quot;.  It may be far fetched, but I have not seen anything being<br/>\ndiscussed on this matter anywhere, &#39;cept for the brief mention of being a<br/>\nFire elemental.  Any input and thoughts on this matter would be greatly<br/>\nappreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am<br/>\nTovan<br/>\nFelwithe Enchanter of the 3rd rank.<br/>\nRathe Lake</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
