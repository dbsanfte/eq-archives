Here is what I<br/>\n&gt; think. All our spells are tested against Magic Resistance where other<br/>\n&gt; classes spells are tested against Fire or Cold Resistance. If you are in<br/>\n&gt; Lavastorm Mountain, all your fire based spell wont even harm a green<br/>\n&gt; creature. So the trade off is that our spells can affect creatures of any<br/>\n&gt; kind. The problem is that most of the magic-users get an extremely good MR<br/>\n&gt; due to spells. Another problem is the fact that our damage spells dont do<br/>\n&gt; any damage when resisted. Right now, our spells are almost never resisted<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; greens, rarely by blues, rarely by whites ( although I could not cast a<br/>\n&gt; single spell on Dorn when he was white to me ), sometimes resisted by<br/>\n&gt; yellows, resisted 20-30% of the time by the reds that are one level above<br/>\n&gt; yellows and resisted 100% by all other reds.<br/>\n&gt; Here is my list of suggestions:<br/>\n&gt; 1) Damage spells should at least do some damage when resisted following<br/>\n&gt; similar rules as the wizard spells with a lesser ratio maybe to keep a<br/>\n&gt; balance with those easy-to-kill wizards,<br/>\n&gt; 2) Our spells should not jump from a 20-30% resistance to a full 100%<br/>\n&gt; resistance, there should be a nicer ramp so that an enchanter is not<br/>\n&gt; completely useless in a group of 6 people attacking one strong red target.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I dont have other suggestions because I personnaly think that enchanter is<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; very strong class. I have an enchanter level 16 now and I had a necro<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; 16 before and my enchanter is almost as good in solo ( nothing can beat<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; triple dots+feign death+let pet finish the critter combo of the necro ),<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; much much better ( much more useful would be the word ) in groups. I am<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; annoyed that sometimes I have to watch my friends kill reds for me while I<br/>\n&gt; cant even cast a spell to help except buffs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; my 2 centimes,<br/>\n&gt; Skara<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CatsEye543@...\">CatsEye543@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CatsEye543@...\">CatsEye543@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 4:34 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] Enchanter Nerf Protest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CatsEye543@...\">CatsEye543@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree, I think that we should all assemble on one day, in one area. Then<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; petition for a GM. While we wait, we send alot of FEEDBACK reports, asking<br/>\n&gt; Verant to finally balance the enchanter. When the GM comes, he/she will<br/>\nsee<br/>\n&gt; that we are serious (hopefully).
