Make a left and<br/>\ngo until you cant go forward anymore.  Follow the room to the right- on the<br/>\nfar side of the room you will see a hall going off to your right.  Facing<br/>\nforward at the start of this hallway you see a door to your left (this is<br/>\nwhere the froglok Squire spawns)- go through that door and into the room on<br/>\nyour left.  You are now in the &quot;Plank Room&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nCross the plank room and you will see a room with a whole in the floor<br/>\n(ladder going down to the floor below).  Jump down this hole and face the<br/>\nonly exit from the room below.  You can get to the first entrance to Lower<br/>\nguk by makeing a right, however, the Froklog priest is just down the hall<br/>\nto your left.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hallyway will turn right then left again then pass through a small room<br/>\nwith one foggie in it (no other exits from this room).  Next will be a room<br/>\nwith a number of exits and 3 or 4 frogs.  Hang a right in this room and<br/>\nhead dow nthe hall.  It  will curve around in a &quot;U&quot; shape (kinda) then make<br/>\nan abrupt left.  The room in front of you now has a pit with 4 spawns, and<br/>\nalclove on either side of the pit with a frog in each, and the hall<br/>\ncontinuing on the far side- welcome to the Froglok Priest Room.<br/>\n<br/>\nAilamil</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
