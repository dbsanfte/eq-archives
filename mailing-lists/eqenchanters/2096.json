My skill is still low (only at 35), but<br/>\nactually<br/>\nmaking the jewlrey gives for getting the money you put into the skill back,<br/>\ninstead of spending the money for the points, and not seeing the money<br/>\nback..<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, but I had an Enchanter before (7th level) and never made a profit<br/>\nat it or even came close to breaking even because of the failure rate. Even<br/>\nif I did succeed I still took a loss. So in my mind, if I can increase my<br/>\nJewel Craft at the guild at a &quot;loss&quot; and have it go up each time I spend a<br/>\ntraining point instead of hoping the next attempt at creating something new<br/>\nwill improve it still at a loss, then the guild way is a better way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure about the research question as I am only level 12 right now,<br/>\nbut I<br/>\nhave saved some of my practice points for research.  My question is this:<br/>\nWhere do I find the pages for the research?  after days of hunting the<br/>\ndervishes in North Ro I picked up one page (24 of Tasarin&#39;s left side).  Are<br/>\nthere any other places I might be able to pick these up quicker?<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOasis and Lavastorm are the places I have seen words, other than vendors.<br/>\nFire Elementals, Lava Basalisks and and other nasties drop them.  However, I<br/>\nwould just Auction into the zone to see if anyone is selling the words you<br/>\nneed/want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want the Levitate spell, Druids sell it as Druids do not research any<br/>\noth their spells. Not sure if any other spells can be bought like this<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Hunting.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBahir<br/>\n3rd Season DE Enchanter<br/>\nBertoxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
