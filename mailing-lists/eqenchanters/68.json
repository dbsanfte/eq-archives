(only human I will make is a human Necromancer out of<br/>\nFreeport)......ok so then lastly we have the Erudite and I personally would<br/>\nhave gone with this race as a second choice......if I wouldnt have gone evil<br/>\nI would have gone with this char.......BUT I didnt like the location.....I<br/>\nactually muled some (no flames please, I worked for my equipment either way<br/>\nits mine) stuff over to my enchanter to get him started so I needed a much<br/>\nbetter locationa nd since I have a 16th lvl Druid in<br/>\nRivervale.......Nektulos Forest just seemed like the right<br/>\nlogistics.......so those were my reasons.......have fun.....YOU WILL LOVE<br/>\nTHIS GAME!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDymond the Enchantress</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
