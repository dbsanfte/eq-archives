You do not get the loot if you have the person die as <br/>\nyour pet.  Yes, you were in control of them, but you did not get the kill -- <br/>\ntherefore -- no loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nScenario Two:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis scenario involved having your charmed player (pet) kill another player.  <br/>\nThere is a bug in the pet system right now.  If your pet gets the final blow, <br/>\nyou will not be able to loot the person.  This is true of all pets <br/>\n(enchanter/necro/magician/etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to loot the person, you will have to work a little harder than <br/>\nthat.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
