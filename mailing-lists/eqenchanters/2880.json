Charm is out<br/>\nexcept in the arenas (I believe, we dont do much arena PvP on Rallos), but<br/>\ncharmed pets are quite a bit superior to our own pets in every way except<br/>\nfor loyalty.  I still remember the time a +3 level druid attacked me in the<br/>\noasis while I was fighting a hill giant.... a miraculously successful charm<br/>\non the HG completely caught him off guard and after rooting him to take the<br/>\nabuse he was short work. *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have the luxury of selecting your spells before a duel, it will be<br/>\ndependant on who you are duelling.  For example, if you are fighting a melee<br/>\ntype you will want to use our weakness/disempower/suffocation spells as they<br/>\nwill quickly make your opponent overweight and quite slow moving... a wizard<br/>\non the other hand would be in a bit of trouble if you mem your early DD<br/>\nspells (fast cast and spell interrupting) with mana seive to make sure they<br/>\ndont have enough mana to finish you off.  A good strategy with casters is<br/>\ntash/quickDD/mez/slowDD/quickDD/mez/slowDD/quickDD/mez/ect.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, rune, shade, and your personal armour as well as your +cha buff<br/>\n(augmentation doesnt hurt also, a little extra ac).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how our slowing spells (tepid deeds ect) work with casters but,<br/>\nwhen applied to a melee, prove to be quite effective.  Blinding spells are<br/>\npretty inneffective as most classes have their crucial attack spells<br/>\nhotkeyed, but its a good way to confuse a melee and get a few steps away<br/>\nfrom them... but very resistable.  Another useful series are our color flux<br/>\nline, good for interrupting casters as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an extra note, if you happen to have the rod of insidious glamour, its<br/>\neffect (alliance) can be chain cast on your opponent to give them quite a<br/>\nheadache (read:LAG) and give you an opportunity to get away... just dont<br/>\nlook into the light and you will be all right.<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg - RZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Shawn Alley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shawna@...\">shawna@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 27, 2000 1:26 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] some PvP questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering what some enchanter strategies are when dueling on a non-PvP<br/>\n&gt; server (like Povar).
