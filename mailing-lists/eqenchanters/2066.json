I know the charm spell for necros<br/>\n&gt;was crap anyway.  I guess I&#39;m just jealous that my enchanter is wanted so<br/>\n&gt;much for in a group then my necro is.  But it is alot easier to kite with my<br/>\n&gt;enchanter then my necro now.  Just charm one mob and set it against another.<br/>\n&gt;When the one thats being teamed up is dead and your pet is almost dead then<br/>\n&gt;its very easy to kill it and get exp for both.
