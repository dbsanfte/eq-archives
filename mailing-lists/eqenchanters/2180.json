That is a really long time.  I almost always am back before the<br/>\n&gt; primary<br/>\n&gt; looting rights have expired.  I am curious, what hardware do you use?  I<br/>\n&gt; use<br/>\n&gt; a PIII 450 with a 770ultra card and I have cable modem service. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Rich Hitz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rich.Hitz@...\">Rich.Hitz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tFor my mule, I create a human fighter and max out the str.  Then I<br/>\n&gt; hunt in front of Qeynos to hit lvl 2.  This is just for comfort, a lvl 1<br/>\n&gt; has<br/>\n&gt; a better than even chance of making the kill.  After that, just go kill<br/>\n&gt; fishes until a corpse is found.  Log out.  Log back in with your main<br/>\n&gt; character and loot the corpse.  No fuss. No muss.  No KOS.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would do this, but it takes me 2 minutes to log out, and another 3<br/>\n&gt; minutes<br/>\n&gt; to log back in as the primary. By that amount of time, someone else has<br/>\n&gt; looted the corpse or it has been &quot;eaten&quot; by the system.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
