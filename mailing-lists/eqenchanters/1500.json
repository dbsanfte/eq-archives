Just so you know...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side issue I have given up on ever trying to achieve standardised<br/>\npricing.  It just will never happen.  EQ is a very different tradeskill<br/>\nrelated game since so many people trade magic items for their wares, and<br/>\ncurrency can come in many many forms of equipment.  I am now a follower of<br/>\nthe &quot;if both sides are happy&quot; principle.  To me if both people are happy in<br/>\na trade then good for them.  But trying to force people to use standard<br/>\nprices simply will not happen - I have tried on my server and people just<br/>\nwon&#39;t listen - good thing only two of us can work in plat right now heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nbaels</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
