I get beat<br/>\n&gt; on all the time. Fact<br/>\n&gt; is, you will get resisted and then you will get hit.<br/>\n&gt;  Never fails.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; On another topic has anyone else tried using AE<br/>\n&gt; stuns and AE spells to kill<br/>\n&gt; large pulls instead of mezzing?  I was in a group in<br/>\n&gt; Chardok the other night<br/>\n&gt; and we had 1 cle 2 wiz 1 dru 1 war and myself.  On<br/>\n&gt; large pulls of 3 and over<br/>\n&gt; I would ae stun and the wiz and druids would cast ae<br/>\n&gt; spells.  It was prob<br/>\n&gt; the fastest exp I have ever got at this lvl.  Rune V<br/>\n&gt; is a must and berserker<br/>\n&gt; on the pull because as you know you will get<br/>\n&gt; resisted on some of the stuns<br/>\n&gt; but with 4 memorized its not too hard to keep most<br/>\n&gt; of them stunned.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Mu<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Osmosis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:osmosis@...\">osmosis@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 06, 2000 3:06 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] Charisma<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, to be perfectly honest with you, I would.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; 20 AC or 50 HP wouldnt make that much of a<br/>\n&gt; difference if I&#39;m being hit by a<br/>\n&gt; level 50+ MOb really, but if I can squeeze an extra<br/>\n&gt; 20-30 charisma out of<br/>\n&gt; those lost points and get a better chance at a mez<br/>\n&gt; or a charm, I personally<br/>\n&gt; would do it.  Personal opinion really, but I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never gotten much benefit<br/>\n&gt; out of AC or HP items.... my opinion is that if an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter is getting hit,<br/>\n&gt; something is wrong.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Cogg - RZ<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; From: Naeeldar &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a>&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, November 05, 2000 2:19 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] Charisma<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; True but it&#39;s not something you would want to<br/>\n&gt; sacrifice say hp or ac items<br/>\n&gt; for since the return of stats over 200 is almost non<br/>\n&gt; existant.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
