I just watch the pet getting slain and another 3 dagger<br/>\ngoing lost.. any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. In group fighting with possibly more than one mob, i try to tag the<br/>\ndifferent monsters to cast my really fine enchanter spells, clicking<br/>\ndirectly on the chest or head of a monster, and what did i tag? ... my pet,<br/>\nmy partymembers... everything clickable in around the next five miles... but<br/>\nnot the monster i want. F8 always tags my pet.. its quite useless. Sometimes<br/>\ni loose lots of seconds runnig forth and back or around the battle to get<br/>\nthe mob tagged. The same with 3 orcs running towards us... strategy is<br/>\nclear, just root, flux or mesmerize to control 2 of them and wait until the<br/>\nparty slain the first... but the run nearly one orc inside the other,<br/>\nchances to tag them in time to cast...zero. its a stupid handling prob...and<br/>\nthat stupid pet is always in the line of sight. Suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. anyone ever casted a pet in befallen? i am getting mad about that, the<br/>\npet is that nervous runnig around me, and is alwas really far from me, and<br/>\nget into melee with everything that moves. Once i casted 4 pets because<br/>\nevery 2 minutes i realized, oh the pet got lost somewhere i didnt even hear<br/>\na taunting attacker... i run around there a lot, from one door to the next,<br/>\nand most times i dont even see, where my pet is, and where he gets himself<br/>\nslain this time. suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nNiniel<br/>\nlvl 11 darkelf enchantress on Solusek ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
