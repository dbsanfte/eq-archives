Made<br/>\na trip back to mainland at 28 (been in Lake 23 - 28).<br/>\nFrom memories of my wizzie, I thought MM, Unrest, and<br/>\nCT would be great hunting grounds. Sadly, it&#39;s hard to<br/>\nactually find groups as there are relatively few<br/>\nplayers in their 20&#39;s in these dungeons nowadays. They<br/>\nmostly seem to have 30+ at this point. I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhere all the 20&#39;s went, probably Lake and Karanas.<br/>\nYou certainly CAN get a group, and then it&#39;s a blast,<br/>\nbut it can also mean wait for others of your level to<br/>\nshow up. Esp. if the one group there has an enchanter<br/>\nalready :(<br/>\nSo I am back in Lake to get 29, and then off to<br/>\nDalnir, and Nurga/Droga next. At least that&#39;s the<br/>\nplan. Maybe back to CT (haven&#39;t played much there<br/>\nbefore) in low 30&#39;s. Mistmoore is train central, and<br/>\nas such it&#39;s hard to get steady experience due to<br/>\nfrequent zoning and deaths. But give it a shot :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTreana<br/>\nDE 28 Enchantress<br/>\nQuellious<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFrom homework help to love advice, Yahoo!
