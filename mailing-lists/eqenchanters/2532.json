Apparently, she had heard<br/>\n&gt; of me from SOMEONE (I&#39;m not naming names) and<br/>\n&gt; refused to speak with me, simply took my money.  Not<br/>\n&gt; a single illusion would change her mind, nor would<br/>\n&gt; any of my &#39;you like me&#39; spells.  In an act of<br/>\n&gt; desperation I attempted to charm her with my magical<br/>\n&gt; spells, but apparently she is UNcharmable (I used a<br/>\n&gt; full mana dump trying).  For those not knowing why I<br/>\n&gt; did this... pets always consider amicable, and a<br/>\n&gt; charmed NPC is always happy to trade with me. <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, Leutenant something-or-rather saw<br/>\n&gt; what I was trying to do (after I had meditated back<br/>\n&gt; to full and was trying to charm her again) and hit<br/>\n&gt; me, VERY hard.  So now not only do I have to find<br/>\n&gt; some way to make Madam Serena like me but I have a<br/>\n&gt; grudge with that hard hitting guy.  Do I have to go<br/>\n&gt; spend a week in BlackBurrow killing wimpy gnolls or<br/>\n&gt; is there some other faster way to make Madam Serena<br/>\n&gt; interested in dealing with me?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Cogg<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\n------------------------------------------------<br/>\nFozzle Brainbender<br/>\nSpirit of the Moon<br/>\nEnchanter, Jeweler, Short guy<br/>\nPuppy of Tinina<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
