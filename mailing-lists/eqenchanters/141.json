I quote straigth from the ATTRIBUTE section on the left<br/>\nhand side of the website......this is cut and copied for all you NON<br/>\nbelivers!!!   if you ppl will notice that ONLY the charm spell is effected<br/>\nby CHARISMA!!!!........the ***&quot;CHARM&quot; LINE OF SPELLS ONLY***!!!!&gt;........<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    STRAIGHT FROM STRATICS ATRIBUTE PAGE!!!!      eqss.stratics.com<br/>\n&quot;WISDOM (Mana for Priests, Resistance to Mind Spells, Tertiary Skill Check)<br/>\nWIS is the mana determinant for the priestly casters, and their derived<br/>\nhybrids (Cleric, Shaman, Druid, Ranger, Paladin). It is bar none the most<br/>\nimportant stat for the former three classes and a consideration for the<br/>\nlatter two. This attribute also affects your character&#39;s resistance against<br/>\nmind-affecting spells, such as Charm. In addition, WIS provides a last<br/>\nchance to succeed at a failed skill roll. Although INT is the secondary<br/>\nskill-up attribute for most skills, WIS may grant you to continue a failed<br/>\nskill roll. Minimal as the chance may be, it is still the opportunity to<br/>\nsucceed on a roll one has already failed via skill check.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nINTELLIGENCE (Mana for Mages, Skill Gain)<br/>\nINT is the mana determinant for the non-priestly casters (Wizard, Enchanter,<br/>\nMagician, Necromancer), their derived hybrid (Shadowknight), and also<br/>\ndetermines how quickly one will gain skills. As such, it is important to all<br/>\nclasses, but is especially so for the four non-priestly casters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCHARISMA (Faction Standing, Merchant Prices, Charm Success)<br/>\nCHA affects NPC prices--when both buying and selling--and also how NPCs will<br/>\nreact to you. While generally not a stat that most people raise, saving some<br/>\nhard-earned platinum on that plate breastplate is always a nice bonus. Also,<br/>\nCHA is almost the INT of faction. By having high CHA, you reduce the amount<br/>\nof faction you need to have NPCs change their view toward you. This can be a<br/>\nnice bonus when questing. It is also a factor for Charm spells, which<br/>\nnotably affects the enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n            OK so can we put this to rest until more thourough and<br/>\nconclusive information can be posted or studied?......please ppl we need sum<br/>\nnew topics.......<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNeurosiz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
