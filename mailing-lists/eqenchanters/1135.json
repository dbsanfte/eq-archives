Adding more spells (where to get them from ?) might be one<br/>\nanswer. Also using more slots to make heavier items would be an idea (eg 2<br/>\njade stones + 2 silvers bars := jade bracelet with maybe other properties.<br/>\nWe can also mix things you get the idea).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSlot number : I know for sure Topaz need something else than but a single<br/>\nsilver bar, but being strapped of cash I had no time to follow that one<br/>\nthrough so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nIbnabeth/Karana<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 18:18 27/05/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;DeGirolami, Franck&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:degirolami@...\">degirolami@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Somebody suggested to able able to combine several stones, so we could make<br/>\n&gt;a +4vs Poison, +4 vs Disease, +5 mana ring.

I&#39;m fortunate enough that I can enchant my own<br/>\n&gt;metals, but I find that very few are interested in my wares.  Strangely, I<br/>\n&gt;have been getting requests from higher level characters to make them as<br/>\n&gt;many jade rings as I can, perhaps they know something I dont. I sure have a<br/>\n&gt;hard time selling them on my own though. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyways, what I wanted to put out there was an idea.  Wouldnt it be<br/>\n&gt;wonderful if we could not only enchant the metal, but the stone as well?  I<br/>\n&gt;think a +5 mana ring with 5 charges of shocking grasp would sell quite<br/>\n&gt;well, or a +2vsFire ring with 1 charge of laying hands, or some other<br/>\n&gt;combination.  This is just an idea, but one I would love to see<br/>\n&gt;implemented.  I suspected that perhaps there was a way to scribe a spell<br/>\n&gt;onto paper, and put this into the extra slots but I havent figured that one<br/>\n&gt;out yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another note... does anyone know what good the other 2 slots in our<br/>\n&gt;jewelers kit are for?  I have tried several combinations of things in these<br/>\n&gt;slots, and other than losing a whole lot of money I did not learn anything<br/>\n&gt;at all, except that it is a good way to waste money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
