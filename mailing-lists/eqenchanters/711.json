It wouldn&#39;t bother powergamers much,<br/>\nsince any-old-spawn-spot will do, but I for one wouldn&#39;t like it. Not<br/>\nto mention the fact that keeping player info on the servers makes it a<br/>\nlittle more difficult for hackers to get their hands on the binaries.<br/>\nNot impossible I don&#39;t think, but so far I&#39;ve yet to see a valid hack<br/>\nand hope I never will.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize it&#39;s a tough thing to give up some play time away from your<br/>\nfavorite character. Take it as a chance to start up a new character,<br/>\ntry a different race, a different class, a whole new persona. Try to<br/>\nexpand your experience, don&#39;t limit it by playing the same thing<br/>\neverywhere you go. As a look on the brighter side, go play with you&#39;re<br/>\nfriends on the other server and don&#39;t look at it as being tied down,<br/>\nlook at it as being set free.<br/>\nMy two cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Manuel Revilla &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manuel.revilla@...\">manuel.revilla@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Manuel Revilla&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manuel.revilla@...\">manuel.revilla@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So If I understand you correctly, I have a set of<br/>\n&gt; character slots on each<br/>\n&gt; server? I would have preferred having just one set<br/>\n&gt; of slots and being able<br/>\n&gt; to move them from server to server. I recently found<br/>\n&gt; out some friends I<br/>\n&gt; hadn&#39;t heard from in a while are playing but on a<br/>\n&gt; different server. Kinda<br/>\n&gt; stinks. Finding a consistent group to play with is<br/>\n&gt; hard enough without being<br/>\n&gt; &quot;tied down&quot; like this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Manny Revilla<br/>\n&gt; a.k.a. &quot;Tharkun&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
