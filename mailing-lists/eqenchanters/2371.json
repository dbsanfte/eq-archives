I can solo stuff easy with that and chase the moon  heh,  i can&#39;t wait <br/>\nfor level 35 cause i&#39;m gonna play with specs :o). If you wanna solo use your <br/>\ncharm line of spells  ie charm beguile... blah blah  those wiil help you <br/>\nalot. i solo when i can&#39;t find a group all the time useing this spell :o) <br/>\nand later on in the game, ie. lvl 40+ enchanter can solo multi mobs with <br/>\nonly a few spells...... a 46lvl enchanter in my guild solos multi (up to 4 <br/>\nfrom what i&#39;ve seen) useing Charm and Fear line of spells, charms one fears <br/>\nthe others cept one, lets it hit him then fears it while the other spec goes <br/>\nto town....you can also mez the other two roamin specs...<br/>\n<br/>\nall in all chanters are a pretty nice charater to play but i personnaly <br/>\nchose this class because of the group emphasis...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChantisis Tashania<br/>\nRodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
