Selling the new mana<br/>\nbracelets for 20p each isn&#39;t a problem. Also, those plus two rings are<br/>\nlike tailor made for whoeevre needs what, and they sell quick now!  Been<br/>\nselling them for between 2 plat up to 6 plat.  I sold CHA bracelets this<br/>\nmorning for 18plat for a pair plus one CHR necklace. (plus 11CHR total)<br/>\nAll in all, some great stuff!  I was alsot able to sell a pair of AGI<br/>\nElectrum rings for 16plat a pair.  Basically just going by the double<br/>\nprice law seems to be working finally!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tChip Paul [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, June 08, 1999 1:24 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqenchanters] Fixing prices for new jewelry?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Chip Paul&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone want to work together to make a price list for selling<br/>\n&gt; the new jewelry to players?
