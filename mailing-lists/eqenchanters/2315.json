Do note, I haven&#39;t focused on keeping my int<br/>\nbuffed max vs. my wis.  I recently have made some  very hard items, my<br/>\nfailure rate was less than 20% and in some cases 0% failure (depending on<br/>\neach gem). In additional buffs, I always buff every stat I can (being a<br/>\nlevel 50 Enchanter we get a couple). Now dont get me wrong, some days, I<br/>\ncant make a plat sapphire necklace to save my life. Usually I&#39;ll zone after<br/>\n3-5 tries and try again in the next zone, this usually breaks the bad run<br/>\non luck, or whatever. The bottom line, least to me, wis does play a part,<br/>\nbut so do ALL of our stats, Im sure. <br/>\nAlso, along the same lines in another subject, I&#39;ve herd a CHA of 130+ is<br/>\nwhen charm really kicks in. So, if the same applies to wis, it would stand<br/>\nto reason, we shouldn&#39;t see much if any with a wis of 130 or less.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
