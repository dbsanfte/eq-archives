I had a friend<br/>\nteleport me to Erudin to buy my spells then I logged out.  I was able to<br/>\nmake a feedback on my first try failed the other 2 times I tried.  If I<br/>\nremember correctly it is 75 mana.  It is a damage shield if you are hit the<br/>\nMob takes 11 damage from what I can see I tried it on a Black Wolf and it<br/>\nwas only able to hit me once so that was the extent of my test on it.  I did<br/>\nbug the fact that Rune and Agumentation was not stacking but I was having<br/>\nwierd things happen to me last night so I was hoping that it was just<br/>\nlastnight and that maybe it does stack but the icon does not show.  I will<br/>\ntry it more tonight though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGive me a message tonight I will be on about 11:30 pst tonight I can give<br/>\nyou the info on it then.  If you are looking for one I know most of the<br/>\nhigher level Enchanters.  I believe I know someone who has one.  I can find<br/>\nout if he has one.  I also am looking for a Strip Enchantment if you have<br/>\none or know anyone who does.  Give me a message later tonight if you are on.<br/>\n<br/>\nKryten Emohawk of EC&#39;I<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Silverlock [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:croesus@...\">croesus@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 12, 1999 6:30 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] Question about Augmentation and Rune series.<br/>\n&gt; Also Feedback.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Silverlock &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:croesus@...\">croesus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 01:07 PM 7/12/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s spelled Sylverlokk, and yes I&#39;m on E&#39;ci, only level 29 though.<br/>\n&gt; I will test them when I can, If they don&#39;t stack thats a bug it<br/>\n&gt; seems to me<br/>\n&gt; and should be bugged and feedbacked.<br/>\n&gt; Can you give me some details about feedback like how much mana it<br/>\n&gt; costs and<br/>\n&gt; what it does?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Jeff Wilkinson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wilkie@...\">wilkie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Is it just me or do these not stack.
