Unfortunately, it takes SO much cash, that<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have a problem convincing someone to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I do:  Go wisp hunting.  I have a necro that I team up with<br/>\nin the East and Wect commons.  At 8th level (maybe 4th too, I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure) Enchanter pets can hit magic.  :)  With two spellcasters, and two<br/>\npets, as long as you can pull the wisps one at a time, you shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave any problems.  Also, pulling to a predesignated spot is great,<br/>\nbecause then as long as your partner can watch you incoming, he can tell<br/>\nyou if there&#39;s anything else on you.  Good incase you start a train,<br/>\nthen you can zone right away.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBukaru, Teir&#39;Dal Enchanter, Test Server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
