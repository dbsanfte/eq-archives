I dont know how well this will work in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1977349588\">I was hoping someone would ask :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo the spectre fighting in the oasis, on the lake side closest to the south<br/>\nro zone.  I dont know how well this will work in other areas.  Take bat<br/>\nwings with you (or illusion air elemental), you need to levitate.  Of<br/>\ncourse, get as ready as you can with buffs and get your charisma as HIGH as<br/>\nit will go(mine is normally around 180), and its best if you can get a SoW<br/>\nthough it isnt needed really (every little bit helps though, but I do it all<br/>\nthe time without).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pull : pull as only an enchanter can... get close to the spectre island,<br/>\nand tashani the nearest spectre.  A whole lot of them will come, if the<br/>\nisland is fully spawned expect at least 3 and as many as 6 or 7.  I havent<br/>\nbeen able to solo more than 5 yet but I&#39;m still trying!  Run back to the<br/>\nspot on the lakeshore closest to Sro zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Fight : Making sure you have the lead spectre targetted, enthrall it as<br/>\nsoon as it hits land (this takes some practice).  one down.  as the rest of<br/>\nthem come closer to you, run over the &#39;ditch&#39; to the second hill.  The<br/>\nspectres cant float across so it takes them more time to get to you.  I can<br/>\nenthrall 2 more as they go thru the ditch.  Hopefully you&#39;re down to 2<br/>\nspectres coming for you.  Go over the hill and run over the second &#39;ditch&#39;.<br/>\nUse the same method that you used on the first &#39;ditch&#39;, charm one (you<br/>\nshould have plenty of time).  Run STRAIGHT at the uncharmed one and let it<br/>\nhit you as you run past it, to get your new pet angry at it.  They will<br/>\nfight, and this is a good time to go and re-enthrall the first spectre you<br/>\nenthralled.  I usually run back to near the fight to make sure my pet is<br/>\nwinning.  The remainder of the fight is all about timing.  Once the first<br/>\nspectre dies, enthrall your pet and then wait for the next spectre to wake<br/>\nup and charm it.    Send it after your previous pet(which is likely almost<br/>\ndead so its a short fight), and reenthrall the first spectre you enthralled.<br/>\nThere may be a angry spectre chasing after you now, but you have a handy<br/>\nspectre pet that is quite healthy, so get them fighting.  Make sure your pet<br/>\nwins this fight, and when he does, enthrall him and let him heal to halfway<br/>\nor even more.  You&#39;re down to 2 spectres now, and you want them to have a<br/>\nclose fight, as you&#39;re probably getting quite low on mana.  Meditate until<br/>\none of the spectres wakes up, and charm him.  Then the spectres fight, and<br/>\nyou make sure your pet wins.  Enthrall your pet, and meditate until you have<br/>\nenough mana to nuke it to death.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Strategy : 1.  Learn to use the &#39;ditch&#39;!  You can always get a ways<br/>\nahead of spectres using the ditches(dunes, I guess) in the oasis.  Sometimes<br/>\nyou have to use both ditches to get enough space between you and the<br/>\nspectres to charm, but I&#39;ve found that I have enough time to cast &#39;cajoling<br/>\nwhispers&#39; as soon as they are in range if they have to go thru the ditch.<br/>\n                      2.  Learn to love charm!  If you think the fight is<br/>\ntaking too long, dont be afraid to re-charm your pet.  If it resists its<br/>\nstill your pet so there is no fear of breaking the charm yourself, but a<br/>\nshort charm will force you to fall back on strategy 1 a lot more often.<br/>\n                      3.  Dont be afraid to run away!  It took me many<br/>\n(game) days of practice (and several deaths) to get good at doing this....<br/>\ndont expect to be able to do it right the first time.  Its also common<br/>\ncourtesy to inform anyone near you of what you&#39;re doing, so that they dont<br/>\na)get killed or b)&#39;help out&#39; by taking away your spectres or waking one up<br/>\nthat is particularily mad at you.  You&#39;ll gain back any experience you lose<br/>\nonce you get good at this, so dont be TOO edgy, but its usually pretty<br/>\nobvious when you are in over your head.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Spells :<br/>\nTashani - No explaination needed, any time you&#39;re going to do damage, use it<br/>\nColor Flux - Good for getting those extra 3 steps ahead of anything<br/>\nEnthrall - Most mana efficient mes spell IMHO<br/>\nEntrance - A few extra seconds of sleepy MoBs never hurts<br/>\nImmobilize - for the wizard in all of us, and handy on the last spectre<br/>\nCajoling Whispers - A charming spell, use your best for the lasting pets<br/>\nChase the Moon - Uh oh, here come 3 spectres but I only wanted 2<br/>\nAnarchy - Die Die Die<br/>\n<br/>\nAny comments on my strategy here are welcome... this works fine for me, and<br/>\nhas since level 40.  Me and another enchanter often take turns doing this<br/>\nlate at night, and between us there arent enough spectres to go around :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck!<br/>\nCogg - RZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stallion02@...\">Stallion02@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 22, 2000 1:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] Digest Number 257<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stallion02@...\">Stallion02@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I read the post about soloing 5 spectres and was intrigued.  please let me<br/>\n&gt; hear your strategy Cogg.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S. Enchanters cant do near as much damage as wizzards, necros or nearly<br/>\nany<br/>\n&gt; for reasons outlined in previous post.  Just wanted to add what a huge<br/>\ntaunt<br/>\n&gt; our damage spells accutually are.  It is a penalty for casting them.
