I finally got a pair of sleeves.  The sleeves did not show up on my character if I took<br/>\nmy robe off.  I am going to stay down there for a while (GREAT exp!) and see if I can get a full set.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s going to show up, but it&#39;s decent armor anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\nEzrae<br/>\n16th Level DE Enchantress<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJanea &#39;Jake&#39; Knight wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Janea &#39;Jake&#39; Knight&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Janea@...\">Janea@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are we talking CHEST items here?

Only problem is that you are a caster, and cant wear<br/>\n&gt; much other than cloth or magical armor. Only think I can think of that will<br/>\n&gt; give you a nice armored look is Woven armor, and the ribcage armor from the<br/>\n&gt; Goblin Alchemist in Misty Thicket. Both appear as leather on your character.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
