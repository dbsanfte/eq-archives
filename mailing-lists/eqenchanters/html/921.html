<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770703995">Well, there is the Lair of the Splitpaw Gnolls, commonly known as Paw.  It<br/>
is in S. Karana and is for levels 5 to 18 or so.  Solusek&#39;s Eye is a NASTY<br/>
place (probably one of the hardest places in Norrath now) since it has lava<br/>
traps AND when I walked in the door at level 20, I saw a PET of a Greater<br/>
Kobold Shaman that con&#39;d Red to me, so I assumed the master was DEEP red and<br/>
immediately left.<br/>

    Aradune send a couple system messages last night. He talked about some<br/>
stuff that he had to some areas. I can&#39;t remeber what the names were of the<br/>
places but I have no idea where they are. Could someone infor me on this?<br/>
The names where like (someone)&#39;s Liar and (someone)&#39;s eye. He also said that<br/>
they were for mid to high level players. Huh glad you are specific on that<br/>
Brad. Woud that be level 25-50?</div>
