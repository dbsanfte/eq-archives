<b>Subject:</b> where is illusion: halfling? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-773748867">I can also now confirm that Illusion:Erudite has absolutely no effect<br/>
except putting the spell icon in the corner.  There really ought to be an<br/>
&quot;Illusion: Change Face&quot; spell that would randomize the character graphic,<br/>
(and an &quot;Illusion: Leather/Chain/Plate&quot; series that gave some AC and made<br/>
it look like you were wearing armor).  Ah, well.<br/>
<br/>
Next question: is Illusion: Halfling available anywhere outside of Erudin?<br/>
I&#39;m Currently based in Freeport (though camped in Highkeep after getting<br/>
my pet), and would like to avoid the trip.  I was hoping to find it in<br/>
Neriak, but didn&#39;t see it.<br/>
