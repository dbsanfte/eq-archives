<b>Subject:</b> Some Orcs can see invisible <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393191804">I can confirm that some Orcs can see invisible. Had one charge our group as<br/>
we where going to purchase more animated sword spells and we verified<br/>
everyone&#39;s outdoor camo was still up as the critter charged. The question I<br/>
have is this: Is the Orc seeing invisible due to a spell cast by an Orc or<br/>
by other means (npc&#39;s, players, etc.). Just curious as to the origin, as<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen the source of this irritation. Strongly recommend you do not<br/>
make the trip alone.<br/>
