<div id="ygrps-yiv-566202311">WOW! That is a really long time.  I almost always am back before the primary<br/>
looting rights have expired.  I am curious, what hardware do you use?  I use<br/>
a PIII 450 with a 770ultra card and I have cable modem service. <br/>

	For my mule, I create a human fighter and max out the str.  Then I<br/>
hunt in front of Qeynos to hit lvl 2.  This is just for comfort, a lvl 1 has<br/>
a better than even chance of making the kill.  After that, just go kill<br/>
fishes until a corpse is found.  Log out.  Log back in with your main<br/>
character and loot the corpse.  No fuss. No muss.  No KOS.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
I would do this, but it takes me 2 minutes to log out, and another 3 minutes<br/>
to log back in as the primary. By that amount of time, someone else has<br/>
looted the corpse or it has been &quot;eaten&quot; by the system.</div>
