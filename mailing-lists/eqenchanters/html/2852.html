<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165049599">At 16 you get Breeze and should already have it in your backpack ready to be<br/>
memed.<br/>
SInce you have gotten away with not using evoke nad conjuration much I would<br/>
wait till then to practice as the extra mana from Breeze and your additional<br/>
levles will speed it up.  Just go and mez some rats.<br/>
I love practing in newbie zones.  I can have a bunch of newbie mobs on me<br/>
while hte newbie players pick what they want off.  Things are so green they<br/>
hardly ever hit me.<br/>
Also good for faction in some cases.</div>
