<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902480432">Well as far as weapons go..<br/>
With me summoning a level 20 pet I can give him:<br/>
Daggers - pretty much all of them, Summoned, Rusty, FS, etc...<br/>
Rapiers.<br/>
and Scimtars.<br/>
(I am including Giant Snake Fangs with the Daggers, and the Beak things that<br/>
come off some of the Spiders in ROK)<br/>
But if I am not mistaken I believe I have seen some higher level pets (40+)<br/>
wielding FS WarHammers and stuff..<br/>
Just wish I knew if it made a difference besides making him (the pet) look<br/>
cool.. haha<br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>
