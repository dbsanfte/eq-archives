&gt; Hi fellow enchanters,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ive some questions on fighting strategies with the pet, and the actual<br/>
&gt; how-to:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. my pet went into melee with some unwanted mob, and i have a safe position<br/>
&gt; and want the pet to come back to keep it alive, but i found no way to to get<br/>
&gt; the pet to do so? I just watch the pet getting slain and another 3 dagger<br/>
&gt; going lost.. any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>

follow commands.  We have sort of a moving bodyguard that doesn&#39;t listen<br/>
to advice.<br/>

&gt; 2. In group fighting with possibly more than one mob, i try to tag the<br/>
&gt; different monsters to cast my really fine enchanter spells, clicking<br/>
&gt; directly on the chest or head of a monster, and what did i tag? ... my pet,<br/>
&gt; my partymembers... everything clickable in around the next five miles... but<br/>
&gt; not the monster i want. F8 always tags my pet.. its quite useless. Sometimes<br/>
&gt; i loose lots of seconds runnig forth and back or around the battle to get<br/>
&gt; the mob tagged. The same with 3 orcs running towards us... strategy is<br/>
&gt; clear, just root, flux or mesmerize to control 2 of them and wait until the<br/>
&gt; party slain the first... but the run nearly one orc inside the other,<br/>
&gt; chances to tag them in time to cast...zero. its a stupid handling prob...and<br/>
&gt; that stupid pet is always in the line of sight. Suggestions?<br/>
<br/>

overhead view would provide an EASY way to mouse-target opponents.<br/>

&gt; 3. anyone ever casted a pet in befallen? i am getting mad about that, the<br/>
&gt; pet is that nervous runnig around me, and is alwas really far from me, and<br/>
&gt; get into melee with everything that moves. Once i casted 4 pets because<br/>
&gt; every 2 minutes i realized, oh the pet got lost somewhere i didnt even hear<br/>
&gt; a taunting attacker... i run around there a lot, from one door to the next,<br/>
&gt; and most times i dont even see, where my pet is, and where he gets himself<br/>
&gt; slain this time. suggestions?<br/>

have, if not for the intervention of a Troll Shadowknight named Torgo. <br/>
Made me re-think my opinion of trolls.<br/>

Our pets aren&#39;t guaranteed to work well in dungeons, but are better to<br/>
have than not have.  Just get used to buying those tiny daggers.  I now<br/>
have about 60 I keep in the bank, plus a supply on my person.  Makes<br/>
visiting Qeynos a little easier.<br/>
