<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104873787">Hail and well met my fellow Enchatners!<br/>
<br/>
Well I just signed up for this list and thought I would take a moment to <br/>
introduce myself. I have two Enchatner characters that are my main two <br/>
characters, along with a Cleric and a Druid I play around with every now and <br/>
then too. One Enchanter is a Dark Elf and does indeed worship Innoruuk, mind <br/>
reading merchants and guards be damned! She&#39;s on Tunare and is about to hit <br/>
level 9, her name is Mukaluteo, I haven&#39;t played her as much recently since <br/>
I have found a group on another server, but I am keeping her around because <br/>
a friend of mine is getting the game and we are going to be evil races(I <br/>
think he wants to be a Troll Shaman, should be a wicked combo) On Innoruuk I <br/>
play a neutral Gnome Enchanter that is level 6, her name is Maia and she is <br/>
grouped with two other Gnome Enchatners, a Hafling Warrior, and a Barbarian <br/>
Shaman.<br/>
<br/>
Im also a message board/list junky and thank the fates for giving me a speed <br/>
reading course in high school that still pays off a decade later.<br/>
<br/>
Also, just so everybody knows, qrentqent, is pronounced brentbent, just a <br/>
play on my irc nickname that came about when I couldn&#39;t remember my hotmail <br/>
password and just created a new acct. As GI Joe says, &quot;knowing is half the <br/>
battle.&quot; With Enchanters the saying is &quot;Knowing is all of the battle!&quot; If <br/>
you don&#39;t know what your spells are capable of, then you aren&#39;t going to be <br/>
a good Enchanter, it&#39;s not like being a Wizard who roots-n-nukes. That&#39;s <br/>
what makes this class so much fun.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Allrighty, now you know who I am, Hello!<br/>
