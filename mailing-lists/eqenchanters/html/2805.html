<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504861679"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You won&#39;t fight treants anyway - they&#39;re insanely camped, all the <br/>
&gt;time. Out of curiosity, why Qeynos?  WK is a BIG zone - <br/>
&gt;Highkeep and Grobb are both closer to SK than Qeynos, and <br/>
&gt;there are vendors in SK so you don&#39;t often need a city.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as to why Qeynos is so i could got to Erudin and stock up on <br/>
Tinny daggers for my pet is closest place to there, and i forgot to <br/>
buy them before i left freeport doh.</div>
