<div id="ygrps-yiv-47944039">Well, last night I decided to see how hard it is to train Jewlcraft After<br/>
200. (skill was 201 went up making some jewelry for a friend.) So from 201<br/>
to 206 how much money do you think I lost? Actually nothing.  I made some<br/>
money, I enchanted every bar and I was making money selling it back to<br/>
vendor (vendor bought gold ruby rings back for 147pp and some change, cost<br/>
131p and change 10p and change for the gem and bar respectively) So I made<br/>
about 5p of each one.  I didn&#39;t keep track of 201 to 203 but from 203 to 206<br/>
I made 240 Gold Ruby Rings selling them all back to the vendor, I think I<br/>
failed 6 times.  While I was making these I would /auction some of the 4int<br/>
2str earrings and 4str 2int earrings.  Dont like to mess with plat to order.<br/>
The only time I do plat is when I loot some Fire Opals and then just try my<br/>
luck.  Anyone else trying to raise it past 200?  I know Plat malachite is<br/>
cheaper each attempt but the mana to enchant the bars was killing me ( I<br/>
tried 20 with no increases). <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas, Suggestions, or Experiences here?<br/>

Btw my int was 213 while doing these.<br/>
And wisdom of below 100 not sure what it was.  But I don&#39;t believe in the<br/>
wisdom theory. I think Abashi on one of his recent posts dispelled this.<br/>
Unless your a wisdom based caster/player then your skill goes off this. <br/>

Heh, haven&#39;t we all tried this?   Thing is, once you reach a certain skill<br/>
level (I think 21), it<br/>
says in all red &quot;You must learn advanced skills in this trade&quot; which means<br/>
you gotta do it the hard<br/>
way.  Do the stein quest 50,000 times to fund your training like the rest of<br/>
us did, and earn &#39;dem<br/>
