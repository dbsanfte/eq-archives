Definitely put a point into each Specialize skill (one for each spell <br/>
skill) and then make sure you stop casting any spells other then the one <br/>
you want to eventually Master at about skill 40.  The reason is that you <br/>
want them all and that you cant get one above 50 until you have at least <br/>
put a point into each of them.<br/>
I also recommend Alteration. At the present time Baelsih at Castersrealm <br/>
is the only one who has a good page for viewing spells by skill type.  So <br/>
look at your spell list or hit his site and then view by the different <br/>
categories to see what spells you like and the skill they fit in.<br/>
You will find that most of our spells are Alteration.<br/>
Since Specialization will reduce mana cost if it works it should be for <br/>
spells you will cast often and when your mana may run out.  For example <br/>
combat spells or enchantments.<br/>

Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
I was reading on eq.castersrealm.com about research (gettin close to 16<br/>
and I REALLY want mesmerisation :)  ), I need to find page 26 of<br/>
Tsarin&#39;s Grimoire left and right for it.  Does anyone know where it<br/>
drops or where I might be able to buy it?  Also, Is the tome of Endless<br/>
Enchantments in the general Enchanter guild area or do I need to travel<br/>
to find this as well?<br/>
<br/>
I also ran across the page on specialization, and it&#39;s got me curious<br/>
now..<br/>
<br/>
This page says that the spell skills will cap at 50 skill and you can<br/>
then specialize in one.  I&#39;m level 14 right now, and All of my spell<br/>
skills are at 75 (except conjuration, which is at 36, uck, need to keep<br/>
working on that one).  Has something changed with specialization or am I<br/>
just not understanding something?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
