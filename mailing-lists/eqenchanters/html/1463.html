<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-441937559">The only way not to get resisted and works 100% of the time is to get up<br/>
real close.<br/>
<br/>
This is my usual tactic at lvl19:<br/>
Cast Quickness on tank<br/>
Get up REAL close to the enemy (aviak in my case)<br/>
Cast Tashan<br/>
Then Languid Pace<br/>
Then Disempower<br/>
Then Choke<br/>
<br/>
At this point I have used 50% of my mana and can comfortly sit down and wait<br/>
for the tank to do its business and I just wait for the next one while<br/>
medding.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, with this tactic my tank friend was taking very little<br/>
damage (he is lvl20) and killing it much faster than the 2 tanks that we<br/>
were alternating kills with.<br/>
<br/>
I think that with this tactic I may have been resisted 1 time only in 3<br/>
hours of play! The only side effect is that as you debuff them, they tend to<br/>
get real mad at you, hehehe! Just step back.<br/>
I do tend to forget often that I am not a tank too and melee a lot, but that<br/>
is ok as we share damage together.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I am close to lvl20 now, anyone have any suggestions on what spells to<br/>
buy next?<br/>
