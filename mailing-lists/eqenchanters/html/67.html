<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336097841">ok ppl heres for all you enchanters that are werking on Jewelcrafting.......<br/>
<br/>
        GREAT SITE HERE!!!!       www.thegrid.net/eq/mainpage.html<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                    heres a clip from sum of thier info......<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
           &quot;&quot; I started my jeweling by follow the advice of Riesling given<br/>
in a post I read a while back on Words of Enchantment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) Train up to skill 21 at the guild.<br/>
<br/>
2) You need about 12 p for this step.  Make silver cat&#39;s eye necklaces until<br/>
you have 24 skill, then make silver bloodstone earrings until 26, silver<br/>
onyx until 28.<br/>
<br/>
3) You need some seed money to try and start making jade rings. You will<br/>
probably lose money due to failure, but your skill will slowly and<br/>
sporadically increase.<br/>
<br/>
Get to know the high level players on your server.  One on mine (Vilar,<br/>
you&#39;re the best) helped me out with some of the cash for step 2, and<br/>
provided a big and rewarding market (all of his 25+ friends) once I was at<br/>
step 3.  It also helped that I was more or less the only person devoting any<br/>
attention to jewelcraft; I sold the rings for 12 and a half plat each.<br/>
I&#39;ve since lowered my price to 10 in part because of competition, and in<br/>
part because I fail less often.  But I still have 60 or so plat in the bank,<br/>
which is not bad for a level 13 enchanter, and it gives me something to do<br/>
when there&#39;s nobody else on that I know.  I just can&#39;t wait till level 16!<br/>
Electrum seems very mass-marketable because you can make magic stuff and<br/>
sell it for 2 or 3 p and still make a profit.<br/>
<br/>

For the most part, this strategy worked well for me.  I was not as<br/>
successful as Riesling when it came to selling my creations, but I also<br/>
attempted this about two weeks later than he did.   Let me add my own<br/>
conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
Having an investor or two is a must.  I spent 42pp increasing my skill from<br/>
21 to 40.  This includes selling all of my creations back both to NPC&#39;s and<br/>
PC&#39;s.  This in and of itself is not that much of an expense, but once you<br/>
hit 40 skill, anything less than Jade gems will not increase your talent any<br/>
further.  Jade gems cost around 3.6pp for me (95 CHA) and the gems get<br/>
progressively more expensive from there.  I was able to sell Jade +5 mana<br/>
rings for an average of 6pp each (not much profit).  Before too much longer<br/>
I will have to start purchasing 6pp and higher gems just to continue gaining<br/>
skill with no hope of selling to PC&#39;s for any profit whatsoever.  It cost<br/>
42pp to skill up to 40 points.   I expect it will cost another 100pp to<br/>
skill up to 55, which I have read is the minimum you need to start using<br/>
Electrum at Level 16.<br/>
<br/>
I also started using Jade a bit later than Riesling did as it was so<br/>
expensive when a failure occured.  I went from Onyx to Jasper and then<br/>
Carnelian.  After those I used some Star Rose Quartz and Amber that I had<br/>
looted somewhere.  This got my skill up to 35.  That is when I started with<br/>
the Jade.  I still failed with Jade often enough even with that high of a<br/>
skill level, but the increases came rapidly.  At one point I had three skill<br/>
increases on three consequtive successful tries (needless to say I was quite<br/>
ecstatic).   At a skill of 39 I started making +4 poison Pearl rings, but<br/>
these cost over 5.5pp to make, and do not sell as well as the mana rings (at<br/>
least in the zone I was in).   It will continue to get more expensive from<br/>
here until Level 16.&quot;&quot;<br/>
