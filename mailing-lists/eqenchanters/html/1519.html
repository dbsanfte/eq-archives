&gt; is a strange behavior in some skills. I know that the combat skill is<br/>
&gt; maxed at (level +1) * 3, and the magic skills at (level+1) * 5. But<br/>
&gt; what about Offense and Defense ? Those are important, and if you<br/>
&gt; neglect them you will be very sorry at higher levels. I ve seen the<br/>
&gt; following from lvl 10 to lvl 13: level 10: Defense 45level 11: Defense<br/>
&gt; 48level 12: Defense 51level 13: Defense 54 So, these numbers would<br/>
&gt; indicate a (level+5) * 3 I cant really believe this. Are we really<br/>
&gt; that weak in defense ? At higher levels every critter will hit us for<br/>
&gt; max damage. If somebody knows if this is correct, please reply. When<br/>
&gt; the Mobs have (level+1) * 5 and we have only 3, this would be<br/>
&gt; dissapointing.<br/>
