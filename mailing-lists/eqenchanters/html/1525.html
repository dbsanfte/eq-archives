<div id="ygrps-yiv-538535231">the duration is not fixed...it&#39;s not that kind of buff....it<br/>
&#39;absorbs&#39; damage...you should see text when you get hit like: &quot;Orc tries to<br/>
hit you but your magical skin absorbs the blow&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	So, it&#39;s not like an AC buff....it lasts only as long as the approx<br/>
50 points in damage are used up in melee or spells...<br/>

<br/>
	Well, <br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	After almost hitting the delete character key(thank god I didn&#39;t), I<br/>
finally made it to level 16.<br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	I just have a few questions,<br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	When is the Rune 1 spell really worth using? I∩┐╜ cast it on myself<br/>
and it lasted an incredibly long time Just wandering around. I cast it a<br/>
second time and as soon as I got into any fighting it wore off very fast.<br/>
Kind of an expensive spell for the time it lasts. Just looking for some<br/>
feedback and maybe some situations to use it. <br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	Second question is about research. What book to I need to buy? and<br/>
for the first three spells is there a left and right half to one page? or do<br/>
I just put one page in ?<br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>

	Finally 16 in North Karana</div>
