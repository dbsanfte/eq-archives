<b>Subject:</b> Flarfian auctions, I&#39;ll bring the enchant silver spell to you for a little cash or magic item trade... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131183109">Are you an enchanter?<br/>
Are you ready to begin enchanting metal?<br/>
Do you look longingly at Nektolus or Neriak and feel the need to attempt<br/>
to enter but are afraid?<br/>
Wish someone could help you out?<br/>
<br/>
I, Flarfian, a dark elf necromancer would like to help out.  For a fee<br/>
to cover time/expense I will bring an enchant silver scroll to you<br/>
(payment upon delivery) in the Freeport/Commons areas.  If I can make a<br/>
bit on each scroll I will be able to stockpile a large number of them.<br/>
Also, remember you will need the more exotic enchant metal scrolls at<br/>
some point and these are EXPENSIVE for me to buy so I need a pool of<br/>
working capitol.  My purchase price to buy enchant silver is 4p6g just<br/>
so you know it&#39;s not too cheap.  Make an offer over that and we&#39;ll see<br/>
if we can make a deal!  Act now, our enchant metal counselors are<br/>
standing by, free alchoholic beverage or edible goo with any purchase.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:alleys@...">alleys@...</a> - home<br/>
<br/>
with your offer and where/when you would like to meet.  I&#39;m often<br/>
playing other characters so it may be difficult to /tell me directly in<br/>
game.<br/>
