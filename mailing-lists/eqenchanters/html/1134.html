<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345183220">Somebody suggested to able able to combine several stones, so we could make<br/>
a +4vs Poison, +4 vs Disease, +5 mana ring. That sounded like a good idea<br/>
too. We should discuss all those ideas and submit them to Verant.<br/>

Well I&#39;ve been making rings, earrings, bracelets since the beginning of the<br/>
public release, and I have to agree that there are some serious problems<br/>
with what we can make.  I&#39;m fortunate enough that I can enchant my own<br/>
metals, but I find that very few are interested in my wares.  Strangely, I<br/>
have been getting requests from higher level characters to make them as<br/>
many jade rings as I can, perhaps they know something I dont. I sure have a<br/>
hard time selling them on my own though. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, what I wanted to put out there was an idea.  Wouldnt it be<br/>
wonderful if we could not only enchant the metal, but the stone as well?  I<br/>
think a +5 mana ring with 5 charges of shocking grasp would sell quite<br/>
well, or a +2vsFire ring with 1 charge of laying hands, or some other<br/>
combination.  This is just an idea, but one I would love to see<br/>
implemented.  I suspected that perhaps there was a way to scribe a spell<br/>
onto paper, and put this into the extra slots but I havent figured that one<br/>
out yet.<br/>
<br/>
Another note... does anyone know what good the other 2 slots in our<br/>
jewelers kit are for?  I have tried several combinations of things in these<br/>
slots, and other than losing a whole lot of money I did not learn anything<br/>
at all, except that it is a good way to waste money.<br/>
