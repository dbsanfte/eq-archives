  Although I could by this point easily have an FBR or something of the sort, I stick with my Gold Senior Apprentice robe, just because it&#39;s enchanter only. Think of it as &#39;Enchanter Pride&#39;. I think that there should be some decent enchanter only robes, which of course would be quest items, and no trade/ no drop, and lore. This goes for the other spellcasting classes as well.<br/>
