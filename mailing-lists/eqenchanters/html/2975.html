<b>Subject:</b> Levelling past 40- kunark <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-30066467">Dreadlands is better at 40-45 for Kunark zones. Find yourself a snarer<br/>
partner and snare and scare, 2 people can do 40-45 pretty fast at the<br/>
skellie camp in the NW corner. Or you should be able to find a group on the<br/>
wall of Karnor&#39;s anytime.<br/>
<br/>
CoM : With one group pulling to zone, it&#39;s hard to insert past them to<br/>
another good location, but excellent exp.<br/>
Overthere: Sarnak knights top out at 39 or 40, not enough good exp there<br/>
past 40.<br/>
Kaesora : Great exp in a full group. Problem is finding a full group there.<br/>
Droga : Starts greening out at 42 or so.<br/>
Nurga : Believe it&#39;s lower level then Droga.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Leveling past 40<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m looking for good places to level past level 40.  This is my 3rd<br/>
&gt; post 40 character, and I&#39;d rather not level in SolB or Guk, and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; never PLed doing guards, however, this may be an option as I just<br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; to level quickly.  I&#39;m also looking for places where I can solo<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ideas I can come up with (although I don&#39;t know much about them<br/>
&gt; eperience wise from a below 50 perspective):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; CoM- grouped<br/>
&gt; Overthere- solo or small group (but really don&#39;t like this area)<br/>
&gt; Kaesorea- grouped, MOBs from 25ish to level 40 (Xalgoz)<br/>
&gt; Temple of Droga- grouped, not sure on the level range of things here<br/>
&gt; Mines of Nurga- not sure at all on the level range here<br/>
&gt; Frontier Mountains- group or solo<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know the level range of MOBs in these zones?  I killed a<br/>
&gt; bunch of stuff in these zones when the expansion first came out, but<br/>
&gt; with the exception of CoM at 51/52 I didn&#39;t get experience from any<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, a little background, all the characters I&#39;ve played from start<br/>
&gt; to 50+ were all before Kunark, and while I&#39;ve camped items in each of<br/>
&gt; these zones with various people (so I do know the layouts), I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; done it for exp.  I also don&#39;t know what agro on pulling is like.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any help on those who&#39;ve leveled there would be great!  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
