hours.  :)<br/>

The first ring you can make to sell to players (you can&#39;t make ANY money<br/>
selling back to vendors, maybe with a CHR of 110) is the Jaded Silver<br/>
ring, enchanted silver + jade.  Jade is approximately 3.7 plat each, the<br/>
silver is approx 6 gold.  Selling price will depend on your customes, of<br/>
course, but start at 10 pat, see if you can get it.  I&#39;ve got a fairly<br/>
steady clientele where I am, and with a jewel craft of 32, succeed at<br/>
making jade rings about once every 3 tries, so even selling for 7<br/>
apiece, I&#39;m STILL losing money.  But every little bit helps.  Rumor has<br/>
it that at Jewel Craft 40, Jaded Silver rings become trivial to make, so<br/>
that may help out then.<br/>
