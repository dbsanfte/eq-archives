<div id="ygrps-yiv-668580484">Yes, i have a suggestion, dont solo....<br/>
Soloing is good for a while, but you need to realize that the objective of<br/>
this game is not to really solo but to find a well rounded group, and do<br/>
your part.<br/>
your part includes and does not include:<br/>
1) you are NOT a tank! there is no need for you to do any sort of hand to<br/>
hand combat!.... EVER!!! if your tank says &quot;&quot;RUN&quot;&quot; dont even think twice<br/>
about it. get your ass outta there!<br/>
2) you ARE crowd control (Mezmerization, Color Flux, Memory blur....these<br/>
are your specialties, learn how to use these, and people will love you.....i<br/>
have held off a train of about 12 mobs, while my group killed them off one<br/>
at a time.......you must communicate with your group, and tell them, if a<br/>
train comes, all assist &lt;tank&gt; this was all the mobs wont even move, cept<br/>
the one they are attacking. all you need to do, is keep casting Mezz about<br/>
once every 15 seconds)<br/>
3) you are a Buffer (buff your tanks, give them speed, str, and other stuff)<br/>
4) you are a debuffer (weaken, and slow down your enemies, this will help<br/>
your tanks live longer)<br/>
Everyone loves enchanters, we help people live during major combat<br/>
situations......<br/>
remember your role, and live it.<br/>
if you wanna do hand to hand combat, and solo, be a Tank, not an enchanter.<br/>
or if you wanna solo the wholel game, be a Necro hehe.<br/>

&gt; I think for now I&#39;m going to stay in Guk, or Rathe Mtns.  Both zones are<br/>
&gt; rarely<br/>
&gt; crowded, and the lower level mobs that I can kill are rarely camped.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; getting sick of the crowded zones.  Befallen is OK, but it seemed a bit<br/>
&gt; crowded<br/>
&gt; for me.  My only experience with Najena was when I zoned in and ended up<br/>

&gt; Question about Soloing:  Now that I&#39;m 16 it&#39;s been very difficult for me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>

&gt; up<br/>
&gt; either running out before I kill the mob, or coming very close to it.<br/>
&gt; Either<br/>
&gt; way I end up medding and healing for a long time between kills.  It hardly<br/>
&gt; seems<br/>
&gt; efficient.  Any suggestions on soloing at level 16?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Gossimer armor can be found in Unrest, rarely in Runnyeye, but 2 good<br/>
&gt; spots<br/>
&gt; &gt; to find gossimer are Befallen and Najena. However it isnt as easy as<br/>
