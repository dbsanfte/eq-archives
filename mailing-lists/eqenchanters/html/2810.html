<b>Subject:</b> Re: Enchanters and the Charisma vs Int Battle <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744974321">Just an update of my planes trip.  I was so lucky.  I won some <br/>
isidious arms, gloves and a halo.  This put my stats up at 202 int <br/>
202 charisma.<br/>
<br/>
So being only 55 str I dumped a batwing earring for a +4 int +2 str <br/>
one and dumped a +4 int ring for a +3 int +3 str and some ac forget <br/>
how much ring of gob king from sol a.<br/>
<br/>
My new stats are now 60 str, 66 sta, 139 agi, 100 dex, 121 wis, 200 <br/>
int and 202 charisma.<br/>
<br/>
I had gold efeeti booties, but then on a hole trip I looted some loam <br/>
encrusted boots (IMHO the best ench boots to be had) and a loam <br/>
encrusted amice (ditto great stuff).<br/>
<br/>
I wear a ring of ancients on one wrist and pbb on other (on shoppoing <br/>
list is a gold chit bracer).  Otherwise I wear a robe of ishva (still <br/>
have not won a insidious one yet).  Maybe next trip.<br/>
<br/>
I know for me, I will be going long on STR till i get to say ..hmm 75 <br/>
or so.<br/>
<br/>
After that I will focus on dex, cuz of the regain concentration part <br/>
you hear about.  I know it works cuz I regain lots more when shammy <br/>
buffs me for dex.<br/>
<br/>
AC too.  Gawds I have spent up the 2 int and 13 Int from the gcb and <br/>
robe about 20 times over.<br/>
<br/>
In response tho.  Pre planes gear the best .. matching int cha combo <br/>
I could do is about 185 185 and I had fantastic gear going in.  I see <br/>
many who dont spend as much time on gear as I do in Hate who must <br/>
have more like 160 160 and do very well.<br/>
<br/>
Level is by far the most important thing.  I started Hate late and I <br/>
am kinda glad I did.  I started when I was 52 and mobs were blue to <br/>
me.  I see the young enchanters struggling with them 51 mobs and they <br/>
just have a real stuggle of a time nailing a mes first time off <br/>
(speaking of the 46 to 49 bunch mostly), miss big head 52 makes fool <br/>
of self acting so high, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
But, I genuinely believe it is true that level is the great <br/>
equilzer.  Guk for me was most fearsome till the day I got about 50 <br/>
and all my mes pertty much stuck, including on lord or king.  When <br/>
going in if invis pops, no prob after 50, before a few lvls i just <br/>
got pummeled trying to mes.<br/>
<br/>
Even Int stat is not that important in some ways.  Inasmuch as i <br/>
opperate between 30 and 70 most of time.  If i am FM I am refreshing <br/>
grouop buffs just to keep the mana regen being put to use.<br/>
<br/>
I can easily imagine being as effective with less INT, in fact it <br/>
might require more skill but have same outcomes to have lower int.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment based on my 255 cha tests and mezing, charming <br/>
experience I believe if blue, 150 up is fine even or yellow higher is <br/>
better.  But, I am not convinced there is any benefit to having over <br/>
200 cha as of yet.  No mater what the con.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, I believe charm is more useful in planes in general <br/>
than mez on multi pulls often, since it cannot be broken and you <br/>
often have many folks up there .. as many as 40 at times.<br/>
<br/>
I also find BARDS extremely helpful in multipulls.  If they are <br/>
masterful they can truely help save you if that charm breaks soon.  <br/>
They have mez and charm of their own that is very effective, but IMHO <br/>
not quite as good as ench &lt;ducks for cover&gt;.<br/>
