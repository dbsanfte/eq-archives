&gt; Well, after the wonderful responces to my previous question, I have more for<br/>
&gt; you. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Is an Agnostic DE Enchanter KoS in Erudin?<br/>
&gt; I was late getting beck to the office over lunch and had just received the<br/>
&gt; Erud&#39;s Tonic from the Erudite in the library using illusion Halfelf and<br/>
&gt; Alliance. I am &quot;parked&quot; in front of the illusion merchant on the 2nd floor<br/>
&gt; and bound at the wood bridge in NK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Where is illusion Halfling?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Erudia<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Is it possible to chain cast WTYH while your pet kills a mob as you med<br/>
&gt; up to continue casting WTYH?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, too long a recast time, not to mention I think the stun of a bash breaks WTYH<br/>
still<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) Or is it safer to root, fear?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most definitely, less chance of failure.  better yet team up with a druid or some<br/>
such to snare the monster.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 4) Does Languid Pace effect movement rate of the mob when it is in &quot;run<br/>
&gt; mode&quot; or only attack speed?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>attack speed only<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 5) For the Coin of Tash:<br/>
&gt;         Do you only give the combined coin to the next npc(s) or do you need to<br/>
&gt; give them gold to?<br/>
&gt;         How much xp does it give at 12th level?<br/>
&gt;         Is it like all the Temple quests and gives no xp anymore or do you get xp<br/>
&gt; at each person the &quot;changes&quot; the coin?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will think up more as time passes. Thanks.<br/>
