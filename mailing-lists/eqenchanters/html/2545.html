	Hmm, you want a druid in wolf form pulling.  In wolf form, NOTHING<br/>
is agro on you.  You can look around completely safe.  Plus you will NEED<br/>
harmony if you are going to pull anything in there.<br/>
<br/>
	10 to 20 is yard trash..<br/>
	20 to 25 grouped first floor<br/>
	24 to 30 second floor<br/>
	30 to 35 is basement and second floor<br/>
<br/>
	Those are rough guidelines.  But a cleric and druid makes life MUCH<br/>
easier.<br/>
	I&#39;ve taken 2 of my characters to 30 there.. a druid and paladin.<br/>
For the level&#39;s, unrest has some of the best loot and exp. in the game.  If<br/>
your below 30, don&#39;t even think about going to the basement or tower room,<br/>
one hag will take you out fast if your aren&#39;t well prepared for her.  Hags<br/>
are wizard, they don&#39;t have a lot of HP, but they are way dangerous to<br/>
fight.  Most rooms don&#39;t pull other rooms, the exceptions are, the bar room<br/>
will pull the tower and the other way around.  LOL, you can see the feet of<br/>
people walking around when your in the bar room.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all 4 of the major loot spawns on the second floor at once, but two could<br/>
&gt; be <br/>
&gt; held at any given time. holding the pit/bloodpool would be very easy as <br/>
&gt; well, i have not quite gotten into the ghost room but i suspect it could<br/>
&gt; be <br/>
&gt; done by people in that level range.<br/>

	It is rare to see anyone under 30 in the ghost room, very rare.  If<br/>
your not at lease upper 20&#39;s, be prepared to die LOTS if you try to go into<br/>
the basement.  If it is you first time in unrest, take a high level friend<br/>
who knows the dungeon.  Trains are VERY common.  If you know where to play<br/>
(back wall, gazebo, etc) life can be much safer.  Make sure person who goes<br/>
in with you can trust.  ONE stupid person can wipe whole parties out.  BTW,<br/>
NO area effect spells.  I once watch a bard do an area effect song, he lived<br/>
about 20 seconds, party 25 seconds, the zone was completely wiped out in<br/>
about 1 minute.  An area affect spell can pull 2nd floor as well as the<br/>
basement.</div>
