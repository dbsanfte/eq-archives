<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127301868">Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
I was reading on eq.castersrealm.com about research (gettin close to 16<br/>
and I REALLY want mesmerisation :)  ), I need to find page 26 of<br/>
Tsarin&#39;s Grimoire left and right for it.  Does anyone know where it<br/>
drops or where I might be able to buy it?  Also, Is the tome of Endless<br/>
Enchantments in the general Enchanter guild area or do I need to travel<br/>
to find this as well?<br/>
<br/>
I also ran across the page on specialization, and it&#39;s got me curious<br/>
now..<br/>
<br/>
This page says that the spell skills will cap at 50 skill and you can<br/>
then specialize in one.  I&#39;m level 14 right now, and All of my spell<br/>
skills are at 75 (except conjuration, which is at 36, uck, need to keep<br/>
working on that one).  Has something changed with specialization or am I<br/>
just not understanding something?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
