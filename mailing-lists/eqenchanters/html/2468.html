<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-918477053">I&#39;m not sure if you can initiate a trade without dropping invis, but you<br/>
can raise your faction in Neriak by giving red wine to a npc in the<br/>
library.  I&#39;ve done this to get my faction up.  I don&#39;t remember the name<br/>
of the NPC in question but he is in a room by himself, and nobody will<br/>
assist him if he attacks you, or you attack him.  you should be relatively<br/>
safe in this room.  At lvl 16 he conned green to me and was REAL easy for<br/>
me to kill (tome of ages quest).  You can try giving him wine while in<br/>
minor illusion, invis, etc to see if you can.  The factions raised are<br/>
Dread Guard Inner, Dread Guard Outer, and Dark Barganers (which is Mizr&#39;s<br/>
faction I believe?).  I know it&#39;s boring, but a hundred or so wines should<br/>
raise your faction to dubious to these groups.  80 wines got me from<br/>
amiable to warmly.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you want (or can) raise your faction in neriak, this would be the<br/>
safest place to test your invis/trade.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps :)<br/>

.I know every detail of the quest to get the Tashania spell, but one part<br/>
.worries me. I am currently KOS to most faction groups in Neriak (even with<br/>
.Illusion: Dark Elf and Benevolence) because of my religion (Erollisi Marr)<br/>
.and a few unfortunate run-ins with the Neriak Guard population. One part of<br/>
.the Tashania quest reqiuires that I see Mizr N&#39;Mar in the Neriak Library to<br/>
.get my glowing coin of Tash converted into a gleaming coin of Tash. Will I<br/>
.be able to do this without dropping invis? Being invis is basically the<br/>
.only way I can roam Neriak unmolested, and I am usure if initiating a trade<br/>
.with an NPC will cause my invisibility to drop. I am pretty sure that would<br/>
.be the case, and being killed by angry NPCs in the Neriak Library really<br/>
.doesnt appeal to me...<br/>
.<br/>
.I would appreciate some advice from anyone that has completed this quest.<br/>
.Am I right to think that initiating a trade with an NPC will make you<br/>
.appear? If so, does anyone know what faction group Mizr and the surrounding<br/>
.NPCs belong to? And is there anyway that I can raise my faction with this<br/>
.group? Any help would be appreciated :)<br/>
