<b>Subject:</b> Jewel XLS spreadsheet <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-937462659">I hate to throw this over 3 lists, but I deleted the <br/>
mail that has the Jewel Spreadsheet made by some one <br/>
here (sorry i forgot your name).<br/>
I saved the XLS, but have some ?s...<br/>
1) where you list the properties and bonuses: is the <br/>
metal enchanted? does it matter? I assume that the metal <br/>
is not enchanted.<br/>
<br/>
2)For the list of base costs: what race/charisma rating?<br/>
If in Freeport, were you of the mage class? Is that in <br/>
the starting city for that race?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
