<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990089231">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Something has been nagging me of late. Not that it would change anything in<br/>
my desire to master jewelry, but has any of you yet reached a skill level<br/>
where you gained more money than you put in in the first place by using<br/>
this craft?.<br/>
<br/>
- please separate unenchanted and enchanted items made.<br/>
