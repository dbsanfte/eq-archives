<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-406817301">Okay, I didn&#39;t sign my flame? look at the top of every e-mail bub... they <br/>
are PRE SIGNED. And if you think that a microsoft game is going to be better <br/>
than eq you keep on believe that... Asheron&#39;s call is microsofts attempt to <br/>
make online money, the game is horribly designed if you even bother to look <br/>
around... And besides, you won&#39;t be able to switch servers there anyways! <br/>
What&#39;s that you say? Your wrong? OMG! CAN THAT BE! YES! AE has already said <br/>
they are going to have ONE huge server, so stop your bitching about this <br/>
that and other and just play the game. Look at UO, you can&#39;t switch servers <br/>
there... Can you??? Hell no and people still play it, you can&#39;t switch <br/>
servers in eq... Can you??? Hell no and people STILL play it. So if some <br/>
games comes along that let&#39;s you switch server PLEASE PLEEEEEAAASSSEEEEEE go <br/>
there so I can play in peace on MY server. If you think EQ is really worried <br/>
about cheap competators then maybe you should look back into the past a <br/>
little bit, uo was never worried about eq coming out and when it did it <br/>
maybe took away 25000 from their already 300,000 players. So stop your <br/>
whining and play the game.<br/>

&gt;Remember, we are trying to have a sharing of ideas here. If the best you <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;do is flame, you probably had nothing worthwhile to say to begin with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been playing online games since &#39;89, and I believe a part of our lag <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;due to having entire databases stored locally. We can debate data <br/>
&gt;structures<br/>
&gt;and use of algorithms to our hearts content, but I still believe it is a<br/>
&gt;cause. It is possible to design a system that allows you to store data on a<br/>
&gt;server (to help avoid hacks) and still allow you to play any one of your<br/>
&gt;characters on any server. Think about it. There would be allot of benefits.<br/>
&gt;I still maintain having a character permanently tied to a specific server <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;a serious design flaw in EQ. A flaw easily avoidable by anyone who wants to<br/>
&gt;compete with EQ. I still hope Verant allows us to transfer characters<br/>
&gt;between servers in the future, even if it involves a fee. Otherwise, we <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;no intention of renewing our EQ subscriptions once something else becomes<br/>
&gt;available.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now if someone wants to flame me further, I suggest:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Use English. Maybe discover the wonders of paragraph structure and make<br/>
&gt;an attempt at grammar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Try to present a clear, concise logical rebuttal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3) Have the guts to sign your flame.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Who knows, if these suggestions had been followed, the post might have been<br/>
&gt;worth reading.<br/>

&gt;Switching characters between servers is the stupidest idea anyone ever<br/>
&gt;thought of... how are you ever going to be able to contact friends you made<br/>
&gt;on one server? Of course YOU live near all your friends and can call them <br/>
&gt;up<br/>
&gt;saying let&#39;s all go to this server but everyone doesn&#39;t have that option...<br/>
&gt;DO THEY? Think about it from a programming point of view, the transfering <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;characters would leave many many loopholes and whereas a program similar to<br/>
&gt;uoextreme could jump in and give you 1000000 platium... hmm... You didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;think things through did you? Okay, you still don&#39;t agree so here goes some<br/>
&gt;more... A new server comes up and everyone playing it is a newbie then all<br/>
&gt;the sudden verant let&#39;s us do this stupid server switching crap and<br/>
&gt;blacksmiths go over there selling everything at 5 times the cost they could<br/>
&gt;get on an established server. This would also let high level parties go to <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;new server and camp all the huge monsters... Emporer Crush for example?<br/>
&gt;Let&#39;s look a bit deeper... How would a guild be able to keep in contact?<br/>
&gt;Talking between servers would cause ungodly 24 hour 7 days a week 365 days <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;year LAG!!!!! Not to mention the constant character switching would cause<br/>
&gt;more lag therefore screwing up your playing anyways... So basically pick<br/>
&gt;your server and STICK TO IT!!!! Why are people always wanting to move? When<br/>
&gt;I first started playing I picked the server with the least amouth of people<br/>
&gt;on it... Bertoxx, and it still remains towards the bottom of the server <br/>
&gt;list<br/>
&gt;and even if it had 2000 people playing all the time I would not switch<br/>
&gt;because all my friends on that server... so thank you and sorry if it<br/>
&gt;sounded like a flame because it was suppose to sound worse than that.<br/>
