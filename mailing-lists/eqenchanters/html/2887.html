<b>Subject:</b> Solo Chanters 6 to 9 in GFay/Steamfont <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986946473">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
The list has been quiet lately, so I thought I&#39;d write this up. I know there<br/>
is a message board via EQCasters, but sifting through message threads for<br/>
strategies is not my thing. Plus the good ones get burried if no one<br/>
comments on them.<br/>
<br/>
This can get wordy at times, sorry in advance. ;-)<br/>
I had been in GFay at the bandit camp since 6th and made 8th there, after<br/>
which they were all blue and turning green. =( Last night I logged in to do<br/>
the same despite the low xp, but it was camped. Now since I am a Chanter and<br/>
I don&#39;t want to ruin faction in Neriak I was at a loss for a hunting spot.<br/>
As my DE Cleric I saw alot of tiny DE bodies all over the place, obviously<br/>
Gnomes that even with DE Illusion on got whacked by the Indigo Brotherhood<br/>
because they hunted in CB. I can count on my hand the nunber of CB orcs I<br/>
have killed. &quot;I will kill no faction.&quot; is the motto I uphold most. Heh.<br/>
Well, anyway, I know that the Sisters are to high for me solo (soothe will<br/>
be resisted quite a bit) and I want to stay away from Antonica as long as<br/>
possible.  I ended up going into Steamfont to the Dragon Bones. All the<br/>
skeletons conned yellow to me. I made 9th last night and they are now<br/>
yellow, even and an ocasional blue. I will be here for quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
There is a key to keeping this spawn and not getting swarmed if you are solo<br/>
like me. The head of the dragon has one spawn point, the rear edge bones<br/>
have 3 spawn points, left to right.  This is where Verant messes you up. The<br/>
left hand skele (facing the trio from Ak&#39;Anon side) is linked to the middle<br/>
one even though it looks to far away. What I did was soothe the left and<br/>
center and pulling the right. After that one fell I took out the head spawn.<br/>
I did this until I had a tiny gnome skele appear at the right spawn<br/>
(indifferent to me and green). Then I took out the center and head spawn<br/>
until the center spawn had a gnome skele. I then sat myself down half way<br/>
between the head and left spawn to med up and only attacked these 2 points.<br/>
This kept the spawn under my control for the entire time I was there. Now at<br/>
9th, this spawn will do quite nicely til 11th or so at which time I will<br/>
check out the elementals and clockworks near the Mino caves. Once I get<br/>
12th, I will check out the Sisters. Charm will make it much easier to take<br/>
down than my pet, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
Some things to be carefule about. Some of the skele when you target them are<br/>
&quot;decayed skeleton&quot; but you will need to con them as this is an error. The<br/>
first time I didn&#39;t con it, I almost died as it was yellow. The only things<br/>
that spawn there are regular skele and tiny gnome skele with a very rare<br/>
mino slaver (I didn&#39;t see any pop). Any decayed skele you see will be the<br/>
same level as the regular skele that spawn there. This may be a database<br/>
error, but be warned. =)<br/>
<br/>
Spells used: tashan to pull (after soothe), Chaotic Feedback, Suffocating<br/>
Sphere, CF again, melee and SS to keep pet alive. Casting SS will give 10<br/>
more damage, plus when it refreshes, CF will be ready to cast again.<br/>
Keep Mez ready and fear if you wish.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that&#39;s it. Enjoy!<br/>
