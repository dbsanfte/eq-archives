<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388442393">Party pooper, party pooper. Ok you know the song, this time I fill the role<br/>
:).<br/>
<br/>
	May I point out that the message said that the code was going to be<br/>
implemented, not that -we- enchanters are going to benefit from it. True,<br/>
it was stated in the book we could do it, but at no time in B4 it was in<br/>
effect, and, according to EQE, we received other benefits to make up for it.<br/>
<br/>
	As I see it, such thing would overbalance us (enchanters) in regard of<br/>
other pure spell user classes. So either the benefit will be too small to<br/>
even consider it or too huge and Verant might take out something in return<br/>
to balance our classe again. Don&#39;t tell me we&#39;re nerfed now. We were, true,<br/>
but that was sometime ago and from my point of view we are rather balanced<br/>
regarding other pure spell users. To sum up we have our &quot;niche&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
	So, the idea is: By talking here, and offering Verant options to consider<br/>
we may have a say in the matter and make our class fuller in the way -we-<br/>
see it. What I would like to see discussed here is : What can we give up to<br/>
have a &#39;proper&#39; enchantment line of spells?. Or are we just to receive this<br/>
new ability/spell/line of spells without giving up anything?. <br/>
<br/>
	As stated above, I dont think we can&#39;t expect a &#39;useful&#39; line of<br/>
enchantment&#39;s spells unless we give up something in exchange. Thinking back<br/>
of Beta, there was a line of spells we didn&#39;t have but nonetheless still<br/>
managed to survive and prosper : Pet line of spells. Plus they don&#39;t fit<br/>
enchanters very well . On the other hand, this line form the very core of<br/>
most of our solo strategies so losing it wouldn&#39;t be a small thing. <br/>
<br/>
	This is just an example, a topic&#39;s starter. Feel free to agree, disagree<br/>
or tell me to shut up. Once again my aim to to talk things out here first<br/>
and offer something (petition/ EQE/ you name it) constructive to Verant<br/>
before we see something not implemented or half implemented in place.  <br/>
<br/>

&gt;   It sounds like we will be able to enchant already    made items, and<br/>
&gt;possibly materials for blacksmithing, weaponsmithing    etc..            <br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] about the new      enchant items     <br/>
&gt;     I was wondering will this allow as to enchant other      stuff apart<br/>
&gt;for bar&#39;s of silver and such.       <br/>
