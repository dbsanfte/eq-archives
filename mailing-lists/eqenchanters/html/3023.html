<div id="ygrps-yiv-40298671"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m having trouble now (L35) finding a place as reliable as Cazic for<br/>
&gt; challenging pick-up groups.  Sometimes SolB has 2 or 3 groups and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; easy to get into one, sometimes it&#39;s empty.  Crystal Caverns is also<br/>
&gt; very good for dungeon design, but spotty for finding a group.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; much like Frontier Mountains or Overthere - I find outdoor fighting<br/>
&gt; somewhat boring.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At 35, Lower Guk is a good spot for experience and loot, plus it&#39;s constantly<br/>
crowded.  If you&#39;re looking for pick-up groups, it&#39;s prime.  Sol B is also really<br/>
good, at least on E&#39;Ci.  Don&#39;t know how these dungeons are frequented on other<br/>
servers.<br/>
<br/>
If you can put together your own groups, Kaesora has a HUGE experience bonus, and some<br/>
darn nice loot t&#39;boot.  Also, Kedge is very nice, if you don&#39;t mind a completely<br/>
different fighting environment.<br/>
<br/>
I was about 40 when I first started in Karnor&#39;s, but it was a bit rough.  Probably<br/>
want to be about 45 or so for Karnor&#39;s.  Chardok is a really cool dungeon around 48+.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know much about Vellious, in truth.  Haven&#39;t bothered to spend much time there.<br/>
<br/>
*shrug*  That&#39;s my 2 cents.<br/>
