<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I&#39;ll make it simple, my line of spells are set up 
for half attack and half defense (crowd control), I&#39;m at level 35 now and don&#39;t 
quite remember my exact spell line but this has always been my strategy. I no 
longer cast, pets I charm, either for soloing or for crowd control. Once I had a 
group that pulled 5 hill giants from the fort in Frontier Mountains, I charmed 
(actually beguiled)&nbsp;one and sent it after another and feared two&nbsp;then 
blasted the other to death (thank god for rune shields), I was proclaimed a hero 
for saving their butts. we and my pet picked the other two off, by the end my 
pet was almost dead when charm broke and he was killed quickly. By the way hill 
giants at fort are immune to mez that&#39;s why I started to&nbsp;charm and fear and 
found that combo actually seems to work better than mez in some situations. Oh 
well, every person has there way of playing and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll work out yours. 
I once was in a group where my only purpose was to cast clarity, easiest exp I 
ever made *lol* =)</font></div>

  <p><tt>Hello all.<br><br>I just hit 12th and am now overwhelmed by my spell 
  options. I look at my<br>spell book and see alot of gems that have the same 
  graphic and I haven&#39;t<br>learned them all yet.<br><br>Another reason this is a 
  bit more difficult for me is that I am primarily<br>grouped with my wife who 
  plays a wizard. I have found that my primary<br>function is to Soothe anything 
  but the one we want on a group spawn, she<br>roots and blasts while I wait for 
  Root to break and cast WTYH, Choke and<br>Languid Pace.<br><br>Offense / 
  Defense: Abyssmal (have not been in melee long enough to get hit<br>very 
  much).<br><br>Evocation:Is so bad that I don&#39;t think it is above a 1 (if it 
  has even<br>gotten that high as I have cast it so little).<br><br>Conjuration: 
  Whats that for? At 4th level, she had Root, and I had Fear<br>ready so she 
  could root again.&nbsp; At 8th I rooted / feared and that was it.<br>Now at 
  12th I WTYH. No need for a pet. I have yet to cast my pet spell. And<br>now 
  that I have Charm.... I&#39;m not even sure I will ever use it.<br>Mezmerise uses 
  conjuration I realize, but I have yet to have a need for it.<br>Color Flux has 
  give me the time I need to get off a WTYH or fear as we have<br>been focusing 
  on wandering mobs and 2 to 3 mob spawns.<br><br>I don&#39;t even have time to cast 
  Tashan as the mobs die so fast. I did in the<br>begining, but it seemed a 
  waste of mana very quickly.<br><br>What do you have as your standard spell 
  line up at 12th?<br>Are you grouped with melee classes or other 
  casters?<br>Should I take the time to summon a pet and Mez it for an hour to 
  get my<br>skill up? Will I need it later in my career?<br><br>My divination 
  and Alteration are maxed. I love illusions (div) and buff<br>everyone I see 
  normally. =)<br><br>I know my wife and I will go far together with this combo, 
  but I am worried<br>that I will lack the finess needed in a group of tanks 
  when my guild goes on<br>raids and such. Anyone have any 
  advice?<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>--<br>Zhian *Dragons of Kel`Dar*<br>12th Facet

Norrath<br>Xegony<br><br><br><br><br></tt></p></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
