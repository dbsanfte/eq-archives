<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039706125">I understand your dilema *perfectly*.  I have a 20th enchanter and a 47th<br/>
bard which, as I said, share a lot of capabilities.  At lower levels my bard<br/>
used to plead with my group to let me lull the mobs and bring back singles<br/>
or doubles instead of whole camps, but they rarely listened.  About the time<br/>
that I&#39;m halfway through trying to explain what I&#39;m doing some loose cannon<br/>
is shooting an arrow at one of the camp pulling them all down on top of us.<br/>
Sound familiar?  I know it does.<br/>
<br/>
There is no solution except levels.  The higher level you attain the more<br/>
likely the players are to understand your capabilities.  However, even today<br/>
at level 47 fighting in lower guk&#39;s Frenzy or Lord (two of the hardest<br/>
non-planar camps in the game) it amazes me how totally ignorant some people<br/>
can be about other classes&#39; capabilites (and even their own classes&#39;<br/>
capabilities sometimes).  The other night we had a Bloodthirsty Ghoul and a<br/>
couple of Dar class frogs in the Frenzy room to pull.  My group was bracing<br/>
themselves for a hard fight that they might not win when I convinced them to<br/>
let me pull.  I lulled the two Dars, brought the Bloodthirsty and we killed<br/>
it.  I went back, lulled one Dar and pulled the other, we killed it, etc.<br/>
My group was astounded.<br/>
<br/>
At higher levels enchanters are well understood and often highly sought<br/>
after for groups (beyond just Clarity).  Crowd control in places like Sol B<br/>
and especially Lower Guk is very important.  In the Planes and on dragon<br/>
raids enchanters have become more important as well.<br/>
<br/>
It does get better, but the problem never goes away entirely.  If you have<br/>
the option, find a competent group and hand out with them routinely.<br/>
<br/>
As for getting groups, I don&#39;t have any secret there..  One thing I would<br/>
say is that when you get to your mid-twenties go to Cazic-Thule.  This is a<br/>
place where crowd control is *very* useful and the experience is great.<br/>
Because of the dynamics of most of the camps there you won&#39;t have to explain<br/>
the need and value for crowd control.<br/>

&gt; I have tried oasis, but it&#39;s always crowded, and there never<br/>
&gt; seems to be enough<br/>
&gt; crocs to go around (grouped or solo) :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree about the downtime.  And I agree about us being a group<br/>
&gt; class.  I find<br/>
&gt; it VERY difficult at my level to get a group.  Nobody seems to<br/>
&gt; want an enchanter<br/>
&gt; in the group.  I have been successful in getting groups in South<br/>
&gt; Karana fighting<br/>
&gt; at the aviak village, but my spells resist most of the time-even<br/>
&gt; with tashan,<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m usually grouped with low 20th level characters.  The exp<br/>
&gt; is ok, but not<br/>
&gt; that great.  When I do find a group that&#39;s closer to my level,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s rarely a<br/>
&gt; &#39;good&#39; group.  People out there don&#39;t understand the purpose of<br/>
&gt; the Enchanter<br/>
&gt; class, and good strategy for that matter, and they will most of<br/>
&gt; the time get us<br/>
&gt; all killed.  They don&#39;t understand what I do, and they get angry<br/>
&gt; when I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; blasting the mobs (as if I&#39;m a wizard or something. :)  ) instead<br/>
&gt; of trying to<br/>
&gt; debuff/mez/charm/control them.  At camps I try to soothe and I<br/>
&gt; tell my puller<br/>
&gt; which to pull.  But before I&#39;m even through (after telling my<br/>
&gt; group what I&quot;m<br/>
&gt; doing 8 times) my group is fighting the whole camp.  It&#39;s really<br/>
&gt; frustrating.  I<br/>
&gt; know the higher level players on my server appreciate Enchanters, and love<br/>
&gt; having them in their group, but the players my level just don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get it yet.  I<br/>
&gt; have proven to many players what enchanters are capable of, but<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not seeming<br/>
&gt; to matter when it comes to finding myself a group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bards are great as well.  My roomate plays a bard primarily, and<br/>
&gt; absolutely<br/>
&gt; loves it.  The Bard class is also great at crowd control.  He has also<br/>
&gt; successfully stopped bad trains, and he&#39;s been fighting in lower<br/>
&gt; guk, grouping<br/>
&gt; with level 40ish players since he was lvl 35.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I might check out unrest, but I think I  might wait until I&quot;m<br/>
&gt; closer to 20, even<br/>
&gt; grouping, I tend to run out of mana really quick.  After a couple<br/>
&gt; levels my<br/>
&gt; spells will be a bit better on the mana I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions on how to approach finding a group?  I&#39;ve tried<br/>
&gt; asking nicely,<br/>
&gt; just plain saying I need a group, and even shouted the benefits<br/>
&gt; of having me in<br/>
&gt; the group, but I dno&#39;t get responses.  Once in ooc someone<br/>
&gt; responded who would<br/>
&gt; want an enchanter?  I proceeded to get into an argument with a<br/>
&gt; few people over<br/>
&gt; whether or not our class is even beneficial to a group.<br/>
