<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746749771">Hail and well met, fellow enchanters!<br/>
<br/>
I am Fistlebane, high elf enchanter {of The Rathe server}.    I started my<br/>
jewelry making craft fairly recently (after sinking about practice points).<br/>
I found that when I try to use lapis or malachite that I receive a message:<br/>
these items are trivial for your skill level.  I stepped up to Cat&#39;s Eye<br/>
and made about 5 necklaces with Cat&#39;s eye...but got no visible message<br/>
telling me that my skill had raised.  I am impatient?  How many attempts<br/>
are required, generally, before you see an increase?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback.<br/>
