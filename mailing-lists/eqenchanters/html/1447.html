&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just started using fear yesterday just for the heck of it.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m always fighting stuff that trains and so I&#39;m paranoid that I&#39;ll cause a<br/>
&gt;huge train while romping around<br/>
&gt;the area stabbing the fleeing mob in the back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So the question is<br/>
&gt;Suppose I fear a wisp and I have a pet.  If I just stand where I am and not<br/>
&gt;follow, will my pet following the wisp cause a train if wisps are in the area?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Generally speaking your pet will attract things that wouldn&#39;t touch you but<br/>
in the case of running or fighting mobs, all mobs call for help as they<br/>
fight so if another mob is nearby it will respond.  In other words if there<br/>
are other wisops close enough they will jump in regardless.<br/>

&gt;the questions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does levitate last long?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Long enough, 10 mins maybe. There is a slight bug with levitate thouhg where<br/>
sometimes people and other things like mobs not beign on the same z axis as<br/>
you become invisible. Happens randomly.<br/>

&gt;mana requirement.  What level is it<br/>
&gt;mana efficient to use at? (eq similar to chaotic feedback, at lv 8, it<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t so mana efficient)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your partied with a Monk always use it. If you are drawing a CONTINOUS<br/>
string of blues then it usually lasts 2 fights. I always wait two levels<br/>
before really using a new spell because at that point the fizzle rate and<br/>
mana efficiency are better.<br/>

&gt;I think I&#39;ve seen it before, but I can&#39;t remember.  Rune I uses a component<br/>
&gt;right?  What is it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cats eye agate, 2.8 gold or thereabouts. You will probably not be casting<br/>
this spell to often. It only protects from meleee and it costs to much for<br/>
regular use.<br/>
