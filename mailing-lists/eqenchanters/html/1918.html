&gt;Hy all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a little problem as i created erudite enchanter and after first 8 lv<br/>
&gt;i crossed a ocean without many tinny daggers.<br/>
&gt;WHERE i can find tinny daggers in qeynos? i dont wish to travel back to<br/>
&gt;erudin or to freeport as some enchanters suggested when i asked them in<br/>
&gt;game. I cannot belive that is possible that in qeynos dont exist seller of<br/>
&gt;tinny dagers, it is so big city there must be one seller but maybe hard to<br/>
&gt;find i spent nearly a day searching but i dont find it. Please if you know<br/>
&gt;where it is to share it with this list so that a enchanters dont have to<br/>
&gt;travel to other side of ocean or to freeport to get daggers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks in advance<br/>
&gt;<br/>
