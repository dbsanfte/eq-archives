<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096760734"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1) Is an Agnostic DE Enchanter KoS in Erudin?<br/>
&gt; I was late getting beck to the office over lunch and had just received the<br/>
&gt; Erud&#39;s Tonic from the Erudite in the library using illusion Halfelf and<br/>
&gt; Alliance. I am &quot;parked&quot; in front of the illusion merchant on the 2nd floor<br/>
&gt; and bound at the wood bridge in NK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Normally, yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) Where is illusion Halfling?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe it is in Erudin, but I could be mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) Is it possible to chain cast WTYH while your pet kills a mob as you med<br/>
&gt; up to continue casting WTYH?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, the recast time on WTYH normally wont keep up with the duration of the<br/>
spell.  What I mean is that it will break before the spell is available.  I<br/>
still have this problem even using WTYH and DDD together.  Aah, for the days<br/>
before it was nerfed...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) Or is it safer to root, fear?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Root is generally safer for you but more dangerous for whomever is meleeing.<br/>
Fear is safer in the short term but there are a lot of dangerous<br/>
possibilities with it (i.e. mob runs into another group of boogiemen)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4) Does Languid Pace effect movement rate of the mob when it is in &quot;run<br/>
&gt; mode&quot; or only attack speed?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only attack speed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5) For the Coin of Tash:<br/>
&gt; Do you only give the combined coin to the next npc(s) or do you need to<br/>
&gt; give them gold to?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just the coin.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How much xp does it give at 12th level?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I dont know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it like all the Temple quests and gives no xp anymore or do you get xp<br/>
&gt; at each person the &quot;changes&quot; the coin?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe you get xp at each person.</div>
