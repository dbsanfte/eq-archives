Well, I was faced with the same problem recently. Made<br/>
a trip back to mainland at 28 (been in Lake 23 - 28).<br/>
From memories of my wizzie, I thought MM, Unrest, and<br/>
CT would be great hunting grounds. Sadly, it&#39;s hard to<br/>
actually find groups as there are relatively few<br/>
players in their 20&#39;s in these dungeons nowadays. They<br/>
mostly seem to have 30+ at this point. I don&#39;t know<br/>
where all the 20&#39;s went, probably Lake and Karanas.<br/>
You certainly CAN get a group, and then it&#39;s a blast,<br/>
but it can also mean wait for others of your level to<br/>
show up. Esp. if the one group there has an enchanter<br/>
already :(<br/>
So I am back in Lake to get 29, and then off to<br/>
Dalnir, and Nurga/Droga next. At least that&#39;s the<br/>
plan. Maybe back to CT (haven&#39;t played much there<br/>
before) in low 30&#39;s. Mistmoore is train central, and<br/>
as such it&#39;s hard to get steady experience due to<br/>
frequent zoning and deaths. But give it a shot :)<br/>
