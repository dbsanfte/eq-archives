<div id="ygrps-yiv-755680202">If you are only going to get one of the spells you listed below I&#39;d have to<br/>
suggest root. That&#39;s a staple of just about every casting class. Soothe is<br/>
pretty good too, but at level 8 you can still pretty much rely on lull.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I finally made level 8, and I mus tsay I love the spells! I bought<br/>
&gt; Alliance, Chaotic Feedback, Lesser Shielding, and Eye Of Confusion. They<br/>
&gt; are all great. However, I didn&#39;t have enough money for anything else, so I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know if I should buy Root, Soothe, or Cancel Magic first when I get<br/>
&gt; enough. Anyone have any suggestions? Also, could someone give me a<br/>
&gt; suggestion as to where to fight? I do not want to go to Crushbone, but the<br/>
&gt; Dragon Bones in Steamfont where I am fighting right now are also pretty<br/>
&gt; boring. I do not want to take a month to get to the next spell circle like<br/>
&gt; I did this time, can anyone help me out?<br/>
