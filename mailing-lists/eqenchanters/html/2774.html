<div id="ygrps-yiv-953502423">I thionk someone else said it, but I&#39;ll say it again. Find the Iskar Bandit<br/>
camp, with the huts. Close to the center of the zone. Kill all the<br/>
wanderers, and keep your eye out for the Ton Warrior. I got 4 in one hour, a<br/>
buddy went and did it last night and got him within 15 minutes. Just keep<br/>
your eye out, he&#39;ll wander off.<br/>

<br/>
Ok I spent 7 hours at the Frogloc city and didn&#39;t see a Ton warrior once. I<br/>
saw 3 Ton shaman, but not one Warrior :&#92; I went by what I read on the net!<br/>
Is there a better way to do this? Like do the Hooky Pooky before each spawn<br/>
heheheehe? <br/>
 <br/>
Sorry just hate taking time, I could have had fun instead of Doing EverCamp.<br/>
Well if any one can help on this one please speak up now :) </span></blockquote></div>
