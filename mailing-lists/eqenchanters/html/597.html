<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716749162"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;1. my pet went into melee with some unwanted mob, and i have a safe position<br/>
&gt;and want the pet to come back to keep it alive, but i found no way to to get<br/>
&gt;the pet to do so? I just watch the pet getting slain and another 3 dagger<br/>
&gt;going lost.. any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suggest getting in there and taking some damage with your pet.  Once you<br/>
get into range the MOB will start hittin ya with all its gots cause you<br/>
(should have) hit it with at least a few chaotic feedbacks and that&#39;ll piss<br/>
off any kobold, snoll, or npc/pc.  That was your pet can whack away at it<br/>
for a while and heal up.... watch how fast his health returns!  You cannot<br/>
command our pets at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2. In group fighting with possibly more than one mob, i try to tag the<br/>
&gt;different monsters <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try switching camera angles (f9).  you just need a better view.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;3. anyone ever casted a pet in befallen? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes and its useless.  a waste of daggers.  Dont do it<br/>
