<div id="ygrps-yiv-352134570">As far as I can see the only way to turn a profit in jewelcraft is by<br/>
selling to other players.  This means your going to have to make things that<br/>
the other players would like.  Things like Enchanted jewelry.  Since I can&#39;t<br/>
make any of the cool things yet, I havent made much money, except for once.<br/>
I made a Silver Rose Engagement ring.  It costs about 15 gold to make and I<br/>
sold it to another player for 2 platinums.  I have also been asked by other<br/>
players if I could make them a ring that Increases strength.  I had to tell<br/>
them &quot;no not yet.&quot;  :(  Since in order to make something that increases<br/>
strenght I think you need a metal that is Electrum or better and combine it<br/>
with Onyx.  Not that skilled yet!<br/>
<br/>

Something has been nagging me of late. Not that it would change anything in<br/>
my desire to master jewelry, but has any of you yet reached a skill level<br/>
where you gained more money than you put in in the first place by using<br/>
this craft?.<br/>
