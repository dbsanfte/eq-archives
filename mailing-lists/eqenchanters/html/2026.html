<b>Subject:</b> More on Twinking? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-290340899">First the safe question: <br/>
 <br/>
I am a level 12 enchanter, what gear/items do you think I should have?<br/>
Please answer this question as it is the one I am most interested in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now the others:<br/>
<br/>
How do you (as in every one of you, all of your opinions count) determine<br/>
that a player has twinked?    Is it by money?  I have had several hundred<br/>
plat at level 12. I have spent much time on my jewelry business and it is<br/>
booming.  Is it rare items?  Most players have grouped with those a few<br/>
levels above them.  What if you grouped with someone MANY levels above you<br/>
(say they needed someone with SOW or Invis)?  Wouldn&#39;t they give you a turn<br/>
at looting?  Didn&#39;t you stand toe to toe with them, fighting, and earn it?  <br/>
<br/>
What if you&#39;re a chicken and only fight blue/green&#39;s, getting little exp and<br/>
lots of loot.  Take that loot and turn it into better items.  If trading<br/>
with other players/NPC&#39;s was against the intent of Everquest, why did they<br/>
develop trade skill and an economy?  If trading is OK, why couldn&#39;t someone<br/>
take months to level and still trade for the upper items (outpacing what<br/>
most feel is usual for that level)?</div>
