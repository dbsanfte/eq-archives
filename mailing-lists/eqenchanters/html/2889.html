<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014974006">if it&#39;s a pet you need, I would suggest sticking with your summoned pet<br/>
since you know he won&#39;t turn on you in the middle of the fight.  Charming I<br/>
use more for crowd control or in a situation where I have someone backing me<br/>
up if it breaks at the wrong time.<br/>
<br/>
As for pets and weapons, it really doesn&#39;t do them any good (except make<br/>
them look cool sometimes :).  It used to be that giving you pet a dagger<br/>
would increase it&#39;s speed without affecting damage, but that is not the case<br/>
anymore.  Your pet will do the same damage at the same speed no matter what<br/>
it wields.  Eventually, however, you pet will gain the ability to dual<br/>
wield, in which case giving it two weapons will help, but I forget what<br/>
level they get it at.<br/>

<br/>
Is it better to use your pet at 12th or to charm? This is for charming a<br/>
yellow con to take out another yellow or even.<br/>
Will it be resisted to much after first getting it?<br/>
How much damage does a level 12 pet do?<br/>
I have been giving my pet rusty daggers.<br/>
Does this increase attack speed?<br/>
Does it influence the amount of damage dealt?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
