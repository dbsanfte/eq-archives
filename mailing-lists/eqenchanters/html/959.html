Bah? Only if you and others don&#39;t support it. Eqstratics and Not crazy have<br/>
already posted blurbs about the strike.<br/>
I will be logging today on every server and tellling any enchanters about<br/>
the strike. Go ahead and send email, go ahead and petition, but don&#39;t derail<br/>
a strike a lot of us are working hard to get going. <br/>

&gt;I think we all should send feedback as well as write up a bug report as to<br/>
&gt;the current nerfing of our class. As for a day we do not play our<br/>
&gt;Enchanter, BAH! Between people who dont know about the day, or ppl who just<br/>
&gt;dont care, there will be Enchanters playing period. What is most important<br/>
&gt;is Veriant hears our upset with the most recent changes, send em email,<br/>
&gt;send feedback and write up a bug report. The more people that do, the<br/>
&gt;chances are something will be done. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another thing along the same lines, I&#39;d like to know where Veriant is<br/>
&gt;telling us of these changes vs. just putting them in and us finding out as<br/>
&gt;we play. If anyone know&#39;s please post it.<br/>
