<div id="ygrps-yiv-895746572">my friend and I BOTH got charmed...at the SAME TIME yesterday in<br/>
Toxxulia forest by some Necro near the tunnel entrance waaaaayyyy back<br/>
inside.......he appeared upset that we had killed off his two guarding<br/>
skeletons...he cursed at them and said he wondered why he ever bothered to<br/>
ressurect them in the first place....we ran back and forth for about 3<br/>
minutes....it was hilarious...charm wore off..and on the way back to Erudin,<br/>
some necro at the fishing dock and his pet....began casting all sorts of<br/>
nasty spells on me....I tried to run...but was dead in no time...<br/>
<br/>
	there are A LOT of necros in that forrest, I&#39;ve found out...but<br/>
nothing worth hunting.....at least not at my level 10...<br/>

	*Yes, once my evil necro was charmed by Lady Shae in freeport <br/>
	*and went around<br/>
	*whacking everyone in sight til the charm wore off and Lady <br/>
	*Shae killed him.<br/>
<br/>
	Holy crap, that blows away my &quot;being charmed&quot; story.  <br/>
