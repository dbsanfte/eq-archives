<div id="ygrps-yiv-600187265">While adventuring we have found what looks like a gem named<br/>
Ice of Velious.  It was worth 3 gold at the store.  Just wondering<br/>
if anyone has seen this, and what it is if they have.<br/>
<br/>
I might tempt him into letting me try to make something out of it,<br/>
at least to see if it is combinable with metal.<br/>
