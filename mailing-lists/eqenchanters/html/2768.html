<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165937638">I have heard this happen where a person puts only 1 point in what they want to be their prime specialization, it goes up then stops completely until they put points in their remaining specialize skills. I didn&#39;t have a problem with just putting 1 point into specialize alteration, when it hit 51 I went back and trained all the others.<br/>
