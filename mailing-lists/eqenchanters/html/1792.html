&gt; Ahem, actually, if NPC prices are 14 to 15pp you should easily get 10pp.<br/>
&gt; While working up my jewelcraft skill I often dealt with comments about the<br/>
&gt; cost of the components used in the item I was selling. Granted, the sole<br/>
&gt; components used cost a fraction of what the sale price is, yet factoring in<br/>
&gt; failures, training to get to that skill level, and your time to get it<br/>
&gt; there I think it&#39;s more than fair! I usually bark back, well go work your<br/>
&gt; jewelcraft skill up and make it yourself if you dont like my prices. <br/>
<br/>

it (for instance if I am working an area and am selling at 5pp a piece<br/>
and they are selling for significantly more, I will nicely inform them<br/>
of what I am selling them for) I usually will adjust my prices for that<br/>
zone. However if they start the conversation with your prices are a<br/>
rip-off, that is one of the fastest ways to get yourself added to my<br/>
ignore list.<br/>

&gt; Try getting with all the jewelers, and get them all on the same page, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; to only help you, them, and the trade of jewelcraft. It does work, you just<br/>
&gt; have to keep after it and others to pass the word.<br/>

enchantress and had just taken up the skill), until everyone and their<br/>
brother started smithing (mainly high level guilds funding someone and<br/>
selling their wares at a bargain basement cost did it) we had a decent<br/>
system going where even &quot;journeyman&quot; smiths could at least break<br/>
even...  you see this in the higher level jewelry also ( who the hell<br/>
wants to play an enchanter up to level 24 just to enchant gold?) where<br/>
it is possible to more or less break even on all your sales, unless you<br/>
have a really poor run of luck. (Also note I have an unadvertised<br/>
special, i make &quot;wedding&quot; and &quot;engagement&quot; rings for almost cost if they<br/>
are really and truly to be used for a wedding(I don&#39;t advertise because<br/>
I have the feeling that many &quot;fake&quot; weddings may start occurring if I<br/>
do)<br/>
