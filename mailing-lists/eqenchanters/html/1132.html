<div id="ygrps-yiv-141171412">That has been my complaint all along...the stuff we make from jewelcraft<br/>
should be better that stuff found in dungeuons , cuz If iyt cost me 10 plat<br/>
to make an item ...and someone can get it in a dungeon , and can will sell<br/>
it for 7 plat,, there is no way I can make a profit, starting to think<br/>
blacksmithing is the way to go...at least people want to buy banded...only<br/>
too many people making it<br/>
-<br/>
<br/>
this prolly made no sense but bottom line is I agree with what brad<br/>
said......period.<br/>
