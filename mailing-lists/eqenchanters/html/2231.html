<div id="ygrps-yiv-701823642">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
Let me first say that I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for quite<br/>
awhile and am amazed at the helpfulness and expertise of many<br/>
of the contributors.  Many times after reading the EQEnchanter<br/>
list, I&#39;ve gotten an &#39;I never knew that!&#39; piece of information.<br/>
Which is refreshing after reading through the mess of sites like<br/>
Everlore packed with mis-information, boasting, and useless blather.<br/>
<br/>
So...a big thank-you to all of you who contribute.  I think I <br/>
speak for many who appreciate the sharing of your knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Now my question, I&#39;ve just entered lvl 16, and am confused <br/>
by how the Research spells work.  Can anyone point me to<br/>
a URL that has some detailed information?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
