<div id="ygrps-yiv-699780534">Maybe someone else has already posted this view on the group, in that case<br/>
forgive me.<br/>
<br/>
- We all take for granted Enchanters aren&#39;t the blitz kind of mage. <br/>
- Use of spells slots is already a bother by level 8. Either one has combat<br/>
related spells or buff/protect spells (can&#39;t do both).<br/>
- In a 6 men team, after rebuffing everyone in need, Im close to 0 mana<br/>
thus has to make the other wait. This one is irksome as enchant are<br/>
&quot;supposed&quot; to be the support kind.<br/>
<br/>
- Some spells are of little interest. eg &quot;enchant silver&quot;, as the game grow<br/>
older, magic items are more common and ours are not different from the one<br/>
in play. Another &quot;niche&quot; we can&#39;t fill anymore. This class has, and still<br/>
have, the ability to be &quot;different&quot;. All it needs are better focus. <br/>
<br/>
	So the general feeling here is we are not only fair on fields we are<br/>
supposed not to shine in, but also in the one we are supposed to. That we<br/>
are just a low level magician.<br/>
<br/>
	Still sitting in/strinking whatever , will most likely end up we look like<br/>
whiners.  <br/>
<br/>
	So, I agree with a well thought letter more than some action online. Both<br/>
can be done assuredly. But we also should add some ideas on this.<br/>
<br/>
	For my part :<br/>
<br/>
- Get rid of pets!. We all use pets solo, but why would an enchant had one<br/>
in the first place?. Pets are magician/necro thingy. I liked it better<br/>
without. We  can have various form of charm instead.<br/>
<br/>
- Add/increase/lower the cost of buff/debuff instead. We were supposed to<br/>
be able to fight if and only we wanted to. Mez/memory blur/enfeeble were<br/>
supposed to be or main dish. Recent changes are not in the proper direction. <br/>
<br/>
- Fix the spells. Has anyone ever see chaos feedback stun a mob?. Or<br/>
alliance lower the vendor&#39;s price even by 1cp?.<br/>
<br/>
- Make some physical enchantments!!. Its in the rules after all:).<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Ok, this is a rough and needs polishing<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;All of this has nothing to do with powergaming level mongering.  Add in the<br/>
&gt;fact we need to be agnostic or illusions are worthless, stupid quirks with<br/>
&gt;minor illusions, and the utter complete lack of any viable enchanting, and<br/>
&gt;you discover why people are quitting the class in droves.  I&#39;m glad you like<br/>
&gt;it, but most of us are not into such masochism.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

	Sorry about that but minor illus is a great spell. EG: You fight a kodi in<br/>
WC on your own. Taking the beast taxes almost all your mana, would you like<br/>
to use sentinel in case a Hill G comes by. No way, minor illus and presto a<br/>
chair meditates in the wild. No one ever botherd a chair/bed/postlamp/torch<br/>
so far. Plus it make very nice screenshots (I have mine between 2 griffs,<br/>
very nice)<br/>
