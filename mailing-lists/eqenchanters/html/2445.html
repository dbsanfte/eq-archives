<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743659786"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; One situation that hasn&#39;t been mentioned is PvP. Many of our spells while<br/>
&gt; seeming useless against critters you usually fight, are quite strong in a<br/>
&gt; PvP environment. Whenever travelling on Vallon Zek in non-friendly areas<br/>
&gt; (and us enchanters are the one class on the PvP-Teams server that MUST do<br/>
&gt; this) or going out to PK, I find myself using completely different spells<br/>
&gt; than usual combat. Some stay the same, but Strip Enchantments, for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>example,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is a must have for PvP. Low mana spell interrupting spells are also a must<br/>
&gt; have. Debuffs, while usually useless, can easily encumber a player, and<br/>
&gt; lower rank ones (which means less mana) are quite useful for this. Too bad<br/>
&gt; there is no fix for the abuses that charm can lead to, because when we<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; charm PvP, we were not only the masters of PvP, but were rightfully<br/>
 </span></blockquote>feared.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Lozi ~Hand of Chaos~, CT<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>...and since we&#39;re talking about mez so much, it should be pointed out that<br/>
its also our most valuable PvP spell as well, although I&#39;m fairly certain<br/>
that the duration is somewhat shorter when cast on another player.  Also<br/>
overlooked is both &#39;curse of the simple mind&#39; and &#39;mana seive&#39;, which when<br/>
used together can rapidly erase the opponents mana supply.  My PvP strategy<br/>
changes depending on the class that I&#39;m engaging, but I always begin a fight<br/>
with tashani-enthrall.... then if its a fighter type I begin debuffing and<br/>
if its a caster type I simple mind and mana seive mana seive mana seive.<br/>
Strip enchantments is very important yes, but never forget that you&#39;ll be<br/>
stripping your OWN debuffs as well, so always re-tashani after that<br/>
spell.... generally I dont strip enchantments for fighter types, but I LEAD<br/>
with it with clerics.<br/>
<br/>
some strategies at least...  I also agree completely that if there were a<br/>
fix for &#39;charm&#39; we&#39;d once again be the masters of PvP.  Why is it, then,<br/>
that a)MoBs can still charm players, and b)MoBs can charm MULTIPLE players?<br/>
Doesnt seem very fair...<br/>
