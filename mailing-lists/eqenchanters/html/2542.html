<div id="ygrps-yiv-41421824">Unrest is quite fine, but it depends on the time of day you play. The zone<br/>
needs 30+ people in it to be playable, with a group in the ghoul magi room.<br/>
That room is the key to Unrest, as pulling down the back stairs will usually<br/>
agro that room. It&#39;s also best to have a group in the tower and the bar if<br/>
one is to be camped as the other room will agro through the floor/ceiling.<br/>
Bats, the reanimated hand and a few things by the ghost room will see<br/>
through invis to undead, otherwise it&#39;s a necessary spell for moving around<br/>
in the house. Outside of primetime I never see enough people in there to<br/>
make it worthwhile, and in primetime it&#39;s camped.  If you don&#39;t mind the<br/>
faction hits (who needs to go to Surefall or Karana druid rings anyway :p),<br/>
or waiting for a spot to open up,  the treants in South Karana are cash and<br/>
experience city, just keep the level 30 and 31&#39;s outta your group. A bubble<br/>
of experience and 30pp an hour is minimum I ever made there (alot more with<br/>
just 4 level 24 casters). Last summer Cazic was quite fine to level in, but<br/>
now all I see in there are trains (all the fools from CB who never learned<br/>
to not make trains I think have gone to CT now). Was used to only seeing one<br/>
train there an hour, last time I was there saw em every 5 or 10 minutes<br/>
(about what Unrest been averaging too). I went to High Keep at 29 then<br/>
(never been there before and my guildmates recommended at) and hit 30 in 5<br/>
hours in the warrior room. Walk in, give the working with an enchanter 101<br/>
speech, start splitting the spawn, start yelling at groupmates not to attack<br/>
mezzed mobs (taunt them please until they attack like I said 3 times), split<br/>
the spawn nice and wide, relax and make experience.<br/>
