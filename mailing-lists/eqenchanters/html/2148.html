I believe. If you have killed Frostbite alot for the fish (bad doggie,<br/>
eating sacred fish), you will be KOS to anyone in that faction quickly, even<br/>
after illusion barbarian and benevolance. That means treating Everfrost as<br/>
KOS territory because of  guards being all over the place (though Tundra<br/>
Jack and Karg Icebear don&#39;t seem to be as angry at me as regular<br/>
barbarians). And forget about walking into Halas, not that there is much<br/>
there for an enchanter. That&#39;s my first KOS town faction, with I figure<br/>
Qeynos guards as being next by the time I get to 26 or 27 (20th level now).<br/>
Also, all the items except for the nut are Lore No Drop now I am all but<br/>
certain, so you have to do most of it yourself . If you can, have a friend<br/>
work on getting honeycombs, as this seems to be the most time consuming part<br/>
of the quest. I walk into Misty and immediatley /auction buying honeycombs<br/>
1pp, though I have heard of some people offering 3pp per honeycomb (pretty<br/>
good money for a newbie halfling if he&#39;s smart and holds on to them).<br/>
