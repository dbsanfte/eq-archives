<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520921082">This is a snippet from a post I sent earlier to the Enchanters mailing<br/>
list...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
The secret to a healthy living with jewelcraft is to define 2 separate<br/>
jewelcrafting modes. The first mode is training. In this mode, you equip<br/>
every charisma, intelligence, and wisdom enhancing item that you own, define<br/>
a set amount of platinum to devote to training, and train until that money<br/>
is gone. Sell every item that you create right back to the vendor to<br/>
purchase more material to train more.<br/>
<br/>
The second mode is profit. In this mode, you purchase a number of silver<br/>
bars (and electrum if you can enchant and craft it as well), a number of<br/>
each of the most popular stones (jade, amber, carnelian, jasper), and make<br/>
jewelry ONLY when you have a buyer for it. If people ask for items that you<br/>
don&#39;t have the materials for, make a note to carry a bit of that material in<br/>
the future and go get some to complete their order. People have been willing<br/>
to wait up to 45 minutes for me to fill their orders. Just keep them updated<br/>
to let them know you haven&#39;t forgotten them.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the major causes of low prices and market flooding we are<br/>
seeing is the crafter&#39;s inability to distinguish between these two modes.<br/>
After crafting to raise their skill they end up with a pack full of jewelry<br/>
that they have to find a buyer for, and more often than not will drop prices<br/>
just to get rid of it.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2cp...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wish that price-lists and standardized pricing really worked, but no<br/>
&gt; matter how hard we try, it doesn&#39;t have much chance of succeeding.  Why?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Enchanter Jerks - For whatever reason, there are those who insist on<br/>
&gt; ruining jewelcraft for the rest of us by charging little or nothing for<br/>
&gt; their wares or by undercutting us at every turn. These false enchanters<br/>
&gt; are just interested in earning a quick buck, not in jewelry as a long-term<br/>
&gt; and useful skill.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) Market Flooding - Even on Prexus (a fairly new server) the silver<br/>
&gt; market is already totally flooded.  People don&#39;t know or don&#39;t care about<br/>
&gt; the money you sink into the skill, they have seen on other servers or on<br/>
&gt; the current servers that the prices are low to the ground and refuse to<br/>
&gt; pay a reasonable amount for silver.  If we try to save the market, it will<br/>
&gt; have to be for electrum or higher.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) Non-Enchanter Items - It&#39;s even more frustrating to be undercut by a<br/>
&gt; non-enchanter selling a similar loot item for no money.   They paid<br/>
&gt; nothing to get it and can undercut us any day of the week.  Given the<br/>
&gt; option of paying 7-8 plat for an enchanter-made intelligence ring or 5-6<br/>
&gt; plat for a similar loot item with an extra armor class bonus, who will<br/>
&gt; choose the former? (example:  +3 charisma necklace - a couple plat to make<br/>
&gt; if no failures versus a doll that does the same thing - 7 gold to buy or<br/>
&gt; free to loot).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4) We can&#39;t make what they want - True, some jewelry (int, str, mana, etc)<br/>
&gt; sells decently.  But, so many more want mana earrings or intelligence<br/>
&gt; bracers or whatever that will never be an option for us.  (&quot;What earrings<br/>
&gt; do you have?&quot; &quot;Only Stamina ones&quot; &quot;Oh, sorry, I need _____ ones&quot;).  Then,<br/>
&gt; they go off in search of the loot item that will give them what they need.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does this mean we shouldn&#39;t try?  Of course not, but don&#39;t expect a<br/>
&gt; miracle because we set the price for jade mana rings at say 10 pp per ring<br/>
&gt; throughout the servers.  We need to educate people ... maybe a seminar or<br/>
&gt; something where we all get together and sell our wares at the standard<br/>
&gt; price and try to let the populace know why we sell them for that much and<br/>
&gt; how the +2s and such all add up to help them out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not interested in making a whole lot of money with jewelcraft (that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what my brewing skill is for), but I do want to make enough money to be<br/>
&gt; able to raise my skill.  For now, I mainly sell back unenchanted stuff to<br/>
&gt; vendors or sell/trade for gems with my guildmembers to get money for my<br/>
&gt; skill until I get to electrum.  Then, perhaps the market will be more<br/>
&gt; willing to buy my stuff.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those of you who can easily sell items for what they are worth ...<br/>
&gt; perhaps you can give a seminar to those of us who keep finding ourselves<br/>
&gt; with unsellable product and dozens of tells from people who find out the<br/>
&gt; price we charge and either say they don&#39;t have enough money or run away<br/>
&gt; from us laughing to their nearest loot monster.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We can save electrum if we start now.  Don&#39;t be discouraged, we just need<br/>
&gt; to teach people the worth of our products and come up with a valid reason<br/>
&gt; for them to buy at our prices.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening <br/>
