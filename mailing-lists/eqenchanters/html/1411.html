<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784291860">All this talk on practicing in 1H Blunt and seeing people use some of the <br/>
rare and upper level piercing weapons has me thinking.. I&#39;ve been using a <br/>
Worn Great Staff pretty exclusively for the past few levels (Currently at 9) <br/>
and is it worth me continuing using the 2H Blunt style or should I give it <br/>
up in favor of 1H or Piercing? I&#39;ve been doing fine using it with support <br/>
from my pet backing me up for melee. But are there better 2H Blunt weapons <br/>
down the road or should I invest quickly in a different weapon style to <br/>
insure I will have an interesting array of weapons in my future?<br/>
<br/>
But then again someone&#39;s post stated that why are Enchanters even getting <br/>
near the high level mobs. So maybe I shouldn&#39;t be fussing over weapons since <br/>
I won&#39;t be doing melee later anyways.. Any thoughts?<br/>
