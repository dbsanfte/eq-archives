<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002498148">Probably been covered plenty of times, I know... .but....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a level 9 enchanter and I&#39;m looking for a few places to level fast without<br/>
hurting my faction with Indigo Brotherhood (so Crushbone is out).  I know that I<br/>
could do the crushbone belt and shoulderpad quest to get some good exp from<br/>
buying the pads, but I&#39;m not really sure if that will hurt my faction or not.<br/>
<br/>
I really want to get to 12 (Charm  woo hoo).</div>
