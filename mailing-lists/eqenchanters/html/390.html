<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059779783">Good and bad news my brother Enchanters!<br/>
<br/>
Berserker Strenght is obtained by combining both left and right pages 30 of<br/>
Tasarin&#39;s grimoire, leaving 2 other slots empty in the tomb. Yes It seems<br/>
this is a research only spell, I am also assuming the Enchantment of Light<br/>
and Brilliance spells are as well. <br/>
This is all the info I have at this time, I do not know what skill level of<br/>
research is needed nor do I know where the pages were obtained from. When I<br/>
find out, I&#39;ll be sure to post it.<br/>
