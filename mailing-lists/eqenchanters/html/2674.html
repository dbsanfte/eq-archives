<br/>
Ulgarth, 	<br/>
	I like the easy questions.  Here are some answers.<br/>
<br/>
1.  At level 8(?) you will get Illusion Dark Elf.  This will make them like<br/>
you enough not to squish you. If you can&#39;t wait until then, you can invis<br/>
yourself and run quickly.<br/>
<br/>
2.  You can only have one pet at a time. Animated or charmed.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Charmed pets do follow commands.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Not sure what you are asking here.  The spell duration is short, maybe<br/>
15 secs or less.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Your pet stands on what you are looting because it is so dumb that it<br/>
can not understand simple commands like &quot;guard here&quot;.  It will always<br/>
happen.  On a reality note, your pet will follow invisible &quot;pathing&quot;.<br/>
Experiment with where you stand until you are able to loot with out your pet<br/>
being in the way.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Agnostic is the BEST choice you can make as an enchanter.  Choosing any<br/>
religion will be a hindrance later on.  <br/>
<br/>
7.  Practice &quot;timing&quot; your activities.  Use a second hand to know how long<br/>
your Mez line of spells lasts.  Be aware that every 6 seconds, the checks to<br/>
see if you are meditating or not and adjusts your mana bar appropriately.<br/>
This means that you can be medding during a battle, get up cast a spell, sit<br/>
down and med again, and if you were fast enough, not loose any mana<br/>
regeneration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I have a 5th level High Elf enchanter and have a few questions.  Sorry if<br/>
some sound pretty lame but I&#39;ve haven&#39;t spent much time with an enchanter<br/>
in the group.<br/>
<br/>
1&gt; How do I get into Neriak without a guard playing squish the elf with me? <br/>
2&gt; Can you have an animation and a charmed pet at the same time?.<br/>
3&gt; Do charmed pets follow commands?<br/>
4&gt; Mez never seems to do anytime for me.  What am I missing?<br/>
5&gt; Why does my pet always stand on what I&#39;m trying to loot?<br/>
6&gt; Is being agnostic going to cause grief later?<br/>
7&gt; Any other tips you might have would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

&gt;The Iksar spell was the first &#39;Quest&#39; spell but there are certain spells we<br/>
&gt;have to go into a particular place to get. <br/>
&gt;Example. <br/>
&gt;All our Pet spells starting with level 8 are in High Hold Keep. <br/>
&gt;All our Metal enchantment spells are in the library in Neriak. <br/>
&gt;Our Enchant Mana spells are either in OOT or the Brownie Village in Fay. <br/>
&gt;Our Breeze (Low level Clarity line) is in the city at Firona Vae <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For another they might be considered risky quests. <br/>
