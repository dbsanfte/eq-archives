<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084513217">I would like to compile a list of spell tactics that can be used either Solo or in a group. Basically, what spell combinations do you use, do you cast spells in conjunction with any other spell caster, Ect.. Basically expand on the post about what spells do you have memorized in your eight slots. Why do you use the ones that you do and wnat neat combinations have you found.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
