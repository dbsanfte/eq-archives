<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724289739">can some one tell me if this is normal or did i have a lucky streak?<br/>

str 55<br/>
sta 72<br/>
agi 90<br/>

well today was the first day i started jewlcraft so i was still lvl21 so i <br/>
decided to live dangerously i started will like 4 plat soi didnt figure i <br/>
would get anything acomplished so i bought one silver bar enchanted it and <br/>
then bought a jade  i tried one time and it worked and my lvl raised to 22 <br/>
(YIPPEE!!)   i sold the mana ring for 5 plat so i now have like 6 plat now  <br/>
so i start at malachite and i try it once and lvl up and become trivial and i <br/>
try lapiz lusal (or what ever its called) and i made two things and both <br/>
times i lvled up then i moved on and kept going  by the time i finished, <br/>
about an hour later i had gone from lvl21 - 26 and i am now on onyx and i <br/>
only failed 3 times   twice on the agate one and once on the onyx  then i ran <br/>
out of money?  is that good for a start??     the only thing special i did <br/>
was i was meditating will i crafted</div>
