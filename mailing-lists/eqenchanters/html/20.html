<b>Subject:</b> Using Charisma to make money <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281840585">I did an interesting thing over the weekend that I thought I would<br/>
share. It really applies to Enchanters because it uses Charisma. <br/>
<br/>
My Enchanter (8th level) has 95 Charisma and I have a necklace that adds<br/>
5 more. My friend is a Halfling Druid with a low Charisma (67-74 I<br/>
think). He reached 14th level and wanted to buy new spells. I wanted to<br/>
see what the price difference would be between him and me.  He was<br/>
buying spells that cost him about 5-6 platinum each. I could buy the<br/>
same spells for a little over 1 platinum less then he could. I offered<br/>
to buy the spells for him and split the difference. He bought 4 spells<br/>
and I saved him 2 platinum and I made 2 platinum in about 10 minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I was in Rivervale which is a small town and doesn&#39;t have all the<br/>
magic guilds, but I was able to buy spells for 2 more people I didn&#39;t<br/>
know (trusting souls, but I&#39;m honest) and split the difference as well.<br/>
I didn&#39;t make as much because they were buying lower level spells.  Next<br/>
I&#39;m going to try a big city such as Freeport. I think I could possibly<br/>
make 10 platinum in an hour or two. Let the people find the spell they<br/>
want and tell me which vendor has it and I go buy it.<br/>
<br/>
I thought this may help some of you Enchanters that need a little<br/>
platinum boost.</div>
