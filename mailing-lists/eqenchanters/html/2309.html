<b>Subject:</b> PVP Servers and the enchanter <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199804263">Just wondering, as I have never played on a PVP server....<br/>
<br/>
How much of the enchanter&#39;s roll is reduced on these servers?  Spells that would<br/>
be hard to use in NON-PK situations (ie normal grouping) - like Mezmerization,<br/>
all the Color series of stuns, grav flux (this one would be funny as hell if it<br/>
didn&#39;t get the entire party killed), etc.  What does this leave the enchanter<br/>
with?  Hope your tanks resist or do you go up and whack on your group member to<br/>
break the mes?<br/>
<br/>
Just seems like a different ball game on PVP servers...</div>
