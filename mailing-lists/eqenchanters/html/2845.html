<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272145894">Hi Zhian,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to hear you are having fun playing your enchanter. Other people<br/>
did a good job of answering things point by point and it&#39;s been a while<br/>
since I first started my enchanter so it&#39;s hard for me to remember my<br/>
original strategies. I know what you mean about all the spells though.  I<br/>
took a 3 month break and when I returned to my level 30 enchanter I couldn&#39;t<br/>
remember what some of the spells were!<br/>
<br/>
At some point your wife&#39;s wizard will start encountering some targets that<br/>
have decent magic resistance.  I always cast my magic debuff (Tashan line)<br/>
for a couple of reasons.  1st to help reduce resists and second to pull.<br/>
You may want to consider playing with a pet as every little bit of melee<br/>
helps in the early levels and it&#39;s another helper that may take some hits<br/>
when root breaks or one of you agros the target.  Also, you and your wife<br/>
will want to use your mana efficiently so there is less downtime so a pet<br/>
doing some damage means fewer spells and even some rest time while the pet<br/>
does his thing.  When using a pet to get it attacking you have to get<br/>
attacked (our pets don&#39;t take orders) for it to wake up and attack.  So, I<br/>
pull with Tashani, take a hit, and back off when my pet engages.  This still<br/>
works at level 31 in outside areas.  A very important spell for later is<br/>
your AOE stun (color shift line) which gives you enough time to cast<br/>
something with a reasonable cast time.  You won&#39;t get a pet off but you may<br/>
be able to get a gate, root, rune, or mez off.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the classes are able to level in the early levels up through the mid<br/>
teens without worrying too much about getting hit or how you kill the<br/>
targets.  But pretty soon you will start fighting monsters that will do some<br/>
real damage to you or your wife once they break root.  You will very much<br/>
want mez working at that point as you can mez/enthral, sit down to rest, and<br/>
finish target off at your discretion. Also, working on your skills ensures<br/>
you don&#39;t fizzle when it&#39;s life or death you get your next spell off to save<br/>
yourself or your wife.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how good a certain way of playing the game is you will find it<br/>
gets stale at some point without some other things to do.  You&#39;ll most<br/>
likely be in groups pretty soon so you&#39;ll want to get your group tactics<br/>
down before you get into dungeons.  When I was learning how to play my<br/>
enchanter, when I wanted to test a new strategy I would solo low greens (so<br/>
they couldn&#39;t even hit me usually) and practice my spells.  Lull/tashan/take<br/>
a hit/pet fights/DOT/nuke and either &quot;oh crap, run&quot; or &quot;yay! ding&quot;   8)<br/>
<br/>
have fun!<br/>

Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
I just hit 12th and am now overwhelmed by my spell options. I look at my<br/>
spell book and see alot of gems that have the same graphic and I haven&#39;t<br/>
learned them all yet.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason this is a bit more difficult for me is that I am primarily<br/>
grouped with my wife who plays a wizard. I have found that my primary<br/>
function is to Soothe anything but the one we want on a group spawn, she<br/>
roots and blasts while I wait for Root to break and cast WTYH, Choke and<br/>
Languid Pace.<br/>
<br/>
Offense / Defense: Abyssmal (have not been in melee long enough to get hit<br/>
very much).<br/>
<br/>
Evocation:Is so bad that I don&#39;t think it is above a 1 (if it has even<br/>
gotten that high as I have cast it so little).<br/>
<br/>
Conjuration: Whats that for? At 4th level, she had Root, and I had Fear<br/>
ready so she could root again.  At 8th I rooted / feared and that was it.<br/>
Now at 12th I WTYH. No need for a pet. I have yet to cast my pet spell. And<br/>
now that I have Charm.... I&#39;m not even sure I will ever use it.<br/>
Mezmerise uses conjuration I realize, but I have yet to have a need for it.<br/>
Color Flux has give me the time I need to get off a WTYH or fear as we have<br/>
been focusing on wandering mobs and 2 to 3 mob spawns.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even have time to cast Tashan as the mobs die so fast. I did in the<br/>
begining, but it seemed a waste of mana very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
What do you have as your standard spell line up at 12th?<br/>
Are you grouped with melee classes or other casters?<br/>
Should I take the time to summon a pet and Mez it for an hour to get my<br/>
skill up? Will I need it later in my career?<br/>
<br/>
My divination and Alteration are maxed. I love illusions (div) and buff<br/>
everyone I see normally. =)<br/>
<br/>
I know my wife and I will go far together with this combo, but I am worried<br/>
that I will lack the finess needed in a group of tanks when my guild goes on<br/>
raids and such. Anyone have any advice?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
