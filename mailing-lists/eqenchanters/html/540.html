<div id="ygrps-yiv-520242966">You did the right thing. If he wants all the critters to himself<br/>
he needs to be playing Baldur&#39;s Gate. Unfortunately, some <br/>
people don&#39;t have what&#39;s called &#39;da social skilz&#39;. That&#39;s why<br/>
they don&#39;t have no friends.. &#39;cept for their mamas...<br/>

Couldn&#39;t resist pulling that line from &#39;The Waterboy&#39;.. hehe..<br/>

&gt; I guess the exploit is still possible using the spell Camoflage.  I had a<br/>
&gt; run-in with a rather unfriendly and selfish player last night in Misty,<br/>
&gt; outside Rivervale.  Vyctor, by name, seemed to think that the Mooto (named<br/>
&gt; Goblin) spawning camp was all his. ...and despite my many attempts to try<br/>
&gt; and SHARE the spawns by rotating pulls, he would not budge....not reply.<br/>
&gt; Instead, I would try to &#39;steal&#39; a turn (after he had killed the last 2 or<br/>
&gt; 3) and he would reply by casting Camoflage on my, thus KILLING my<br/>
&gt; animation.  Exploit!  I immediately petitioned.  the Guide showed up a few<br/>
&gt; minutes later....and told me he was invisible and to continue playing as<br/>
&gt; usual.  I did.....Vyctor repeated his actions and killed my pet.  About 1<br/>
&gt; minute later, Meronn The Mischievious (a GM, not a Guide) appeared at the<br/>
&gt; camp and explained that he was &#39;Exploiting&#39; and could be banned for such<br/>
&gt; behavior.  Vyctor was not happy....challenged me to duel (which i declined<br/>
&gt; by ignoring) and I left.  Meanwhile, I get ridiculed for &#39;crying to a GM&#39;.<br/>
&gt; Bullshit!  This is an exploit...and I tried diplomatic resolution first.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To sum up, he was given a &#39;Formal warning that will be logged by<br/>
&gt; Verant&#39;....and I left with a very bad taste in my mouth....gated home to<br/>
&gt; Rivervale and fished to cool my nerves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How else should I have handled this?  I might have dueled for the &#39;camp<br/>
&gt; rights&#39; but he did not offer to duel until AFTER he was warned...and at<br/>
&gt; that point it was mere anger, not a solution to the original problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any input.<br/>
