<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948989556">well doesnt this just make everyone happy?.......<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
            Actually......Im glad there are so few enchanters....not only<br/>
that Im glad there are so few enchanters that are happy......Im working on<br/>
this char as my second char so I can go bak to my main char or even my<br/>
fletcher when I want to.......tell you the truth this is what I thikn the<br/>
key is for playing those difficult chars.......there are a FEW chars in EQ<br/>
that are EXTREMELY back loaded and never reach their potential becuase ppl<br/>
dont have the patience to play......this is not to say that there are not<br/>
bugs or problems with the class Im jsut saying that this is not the ONLY<br/>
tuff class in EQ......the Wizard is also a VERY difficult class.......I<br/>
played a wizard straight out of Release and the falling behind guild members<br/>
and leaders was my problem as well.....and this is when I started my<br/>
Druid......I FELL IN LOVE!!!&gt;.....the Druid or the Shaman have GOT TO BE the<br/>
BEST chars to playin EQ&gt;.......these guys are SO MUCH FUN!!!&gt;......but well<br/>
stick to the topic......but the enchanter has ssum draw backs and I dont<br/>
think the enchanter will begin to see their full potential unless they are<br/>
playing with A) a very organized very detailed group as to role playing and<br/>
thigns like that....(not RPing like acting, RPing like knowing your role in<br/>
the group combat scenario) which by the way I would like to say there are<br/>
four words that we beta testers have learned QUITE WELL!!!&gt;......KNOW YOUR<br/>
DAMN ROLE!!!!......this is sumthin that was implemented into the game as a<br/>
MAIN FUNCTION of game play......it is the enchanters ROLE to CONTROL THE<br/>
BOARD!!!.....the enchanter dusnt do DAMAGE.......the enchanter dusnt get to<br/>
HEAL......the enchater dusnt get to TRAVEL.....but the enchanter DOES get to<br/>
pick which monsters the group is going to fight and who fights<br/>
what.......NOW with all this said lets go bak to what this post<br/>
said.....people are unhappy with the char.....ALL THE BETTER FOR<br/>
US!!!&gt;......the less there are of us the MORE in demand we wil become as the<br/>
game goes on and as we learn more about the game as a whole and the chars<br/>
role in the group........when strategies start to arrise from good<br/>
enchatners learning thier role we will start to see and welcoming to the<br/>
art.......and on tat same note as to what was posted ........the Enchanters<br/>
are NOT buffers.......they are DEBUFFERS!!!....and yes your spells get<br/>
RESISTED alot......but at higher levels they wont.....and yes if your in a<br/>
group fighting reds.....you prolly WONT DO MUCH!!!&gt;.....jsut the way of the<br/>
enchanter.......till higher levels that is......just sum thigns to think<br/>
about.......<br/>
