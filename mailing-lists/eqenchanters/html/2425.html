<div id="ygrps-yiv-766775351">Memory blur is one of the most powerful spells in the game. It erases a mobs<br/>
&#39;hate list&#39; (also known as the shit list). There is no resist for this<br/>
spell, but extreme amounts of damage may take more than one memory blur to<br/>
erase. Not sure exactly what the limitation are, but short of someone taking<br/>
a best effort of going OOM on a target, one cast does the job. This spell<br/>
will, sooner or later, save you or your entire party&#39;s life(s). It won&#39;t get<br/>
you experience, but it will save you from losing it, which in my book is all<br/>
the same. After level 20, I have always kept this spell memorized. Useful<br/>
situations:<br/>
<br/>
1). You&#39;re travelling across South Karana (I always keep a pet up in that<br/>
zone) at level 22. A cyclops decides you would make a nice meal (they see<br/>
invis, so that won&#39;t help). Cyclops hits you, pet hits cyclops, you run out<br/>
of his agro range, but still in spell range. At about this time, the pet<br/>
dies like a good loyal pet. Memory blur the cyclops and walk on your merry<br/>
way short one pet, but with all experience intact for not dying.<br/>
<br/>
2). You have a wizard in your group that thinks that since his/her big burn<br/>
spell has recycled and he&#39;s/she&#39;s not OOM, he/she should cast again on the<br/>
target because that&#39;s his/her job. Mob thinks, hmmm, continue hitting this<br/>
warrior hitting me for 30 or 40 a time, or that guy/girl in the robe who<br/>
just whacked me for 300. Mob runs at wizard (and hopefully he&#39;s/she&#39;s not<br/>
stupid enough to run away) with tank in hot pursuit (hopefully), memory blur<br/>
the mob, and he turns right back at the tank having &#39;forgotten&#39; that the<br/>
wizard just did as much damage in 2 seconds as the tank will in the entire<br/>
fight. (becomes very useful the higher in level your burners go and this<br/>
becomes unavoidable)<br/>
<br/>
3). Kill stealing. Wizards think they can kill steal just because they can<br/>
do the most damage the fastest, but damage is highly overrated. When the<br/>
hate list is wiped, whoever does the most damage on the life that is LEFT<br/>
will get the kill. If it has 100 out of 1000 life, I memory blur, then nuke<br/>
it, I get the kill, not the person who did the 900 points of damage to it.<br/>
Personal call on this one, but if you /y and I&#39;m in the area and your target<br/>
is experience is for me, I usually will do this if I don&#39;t know you. Non<br/>
getting people very angry at you use of this is for powerlevelling<br/>
characters.<br/>
