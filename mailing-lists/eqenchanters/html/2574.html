<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018210323">When it comes to enchanting platinum or any metal I just tell them they can &#39;give&#39; me whatever they can afford. Many are &#39;younger&#39; adventurers who don&#39;t have huge bank rolls and it&#39;s good to be able to help them out. Charging obscene amounts for enchanting metal is ridiculous. Many people on veeshan will wait until I am in Freeport to get their platinum enchanted and my reputation as an honorable player in this manner has many people I haven&#39;t even met hand over hundreds of plat to me to buy them bars without a worry.<br/>
