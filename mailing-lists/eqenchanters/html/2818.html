&gt; I asked myself a question last night that I hope all of you will reply to<br/>
&gt; when I ask it of you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why did you choose the name of your character? What does it mean to you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, so that is 2 questions, shoot me. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This thought entered my mind as I sat last night trying to come up with a<br/>
&gt; name for my gnome enchanter. I do not like the name generator that Verant<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; kindly provides. Answering this question(s) became the real challenge and<br/>
&gt; gave my pixels a minor RP perspective that is truly lacking in this game.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; love the game, but the war for XP dominates the minds of 98.9% (&lt;~ note<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; pun?) of those that subscribe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, what follows is a breakdown of why I chose the names I did. I am<br/>
&gt; intrigued to see the results if all of you did the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personal history: I have been playing RPs since 73, and picked up<br/>
WhiteWolf<br/>
&gt; as the dominant favorite since 92.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Arakine Uktena, Woodelf Druid:<br/>
&gt; Arakine-<br/>
&gt; From the movie Dune. Arakis, desert planet. Paul says at one point &quot;We<br/>
shall<br/>
&gt; squeeze and squeeze until no Harkonin breathes Arakine air.&quot;.  The planet<br/>
&gt; itself is a desert filled with danger, yet has the potential to become a<br/>
&gt; lush garden paradise.<br/>
&gt; Uktena-<br/>
&gt; American Indian tribe, and a tribe of Werewolves from WhiteWolf&#39;s<br/>
&quot;Werewolf:<br/>
&gt; the Apocalypse!&quot;. Violent, bloody bastards that guard the spiritual foci<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; are the closest to the Spirits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Uthanatos, Gnome Enchanter:<br/>
&gt; No last name yet, but I will have a while before I need to worry about it.<br/>
&gt; ;-)<br/>
&gt; From WhiteWolf&#39;s &quot;Mage: the Ascension&quot;, Euthantos.  A Tradition of mages<br/>
&gt; that believe death should come to all. They are to help others to meet<br/>
Death<br/>
&gt; when they try to avoid it and have nothing left to give, or to preserve<br/>
Life<br/>
&gt; when their existence still has something to contribute to those around<br/>
them.<br/>
&gt; Also called Death Mages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This may apply to Necromancers, but to me the Enchanter class is the true<br/>
&gt; embodiment of the Euthanatos. They can ultimately control the outcome of<br/>
&gt; almost any battle so that the &quot;Life&quot; of the party is preserved (by being<br/>
&gt; competent) or they can hasten the grip of Death upon his fellows (by being<br/>
&gt; inept).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, there you have it. One step closer into the mind of Me. Reply if you<br/>
&gt; wish, I for one would enjoy reading it.<br/>
