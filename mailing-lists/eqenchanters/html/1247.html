<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023995094">I&#39;m sorry, but I *totally* disagree with you.  Something HAS to be done<br/>
about the farming that goes on.  Too many guilds and assholes sit around<br/>
camping GREEN MOBs so that they can get yet another item to sell at<br/>
exorbitant prices.  In my opinion, the new code is EXCELLENT and just what<br/>
is needed.  Why do you have to get that 2nd item &quot;just in case?&quot;  Go get it<br/>
again or buy it when you NEED it, not &quot;just in case.&quot;  There are too many<br/>
campers for &quot;just in case&quot; scenarios.  I say that the new patch is exactly<br/>
what is needed.<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First I need Brad McQuaid&#39;s E-mail address, if you have it,<br/>
&gt; please post it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not one to start a campaign and have never tried so, as they<br/>
&gt; say this is<br/>
&gt; a first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure how many of you keep up with changes that are<br/>
&gt; getting ready to<br/>
&gt; be made to the game, most are great and well needed, but one has<br/>
&gt; me a little<br/>
&gt; worried.  Its the change to help control the Camping in the game.<br/>
&gt;  Now don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get me wrong this need to be looked at and fixed and I think they<br/>
&gt; are on the<br/>
&gt; right path, but I have one big issue with it... read what he has to say at<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqss.stratics.com/">http://eqss.stratics.com/</a> June 3rd.  Go to the 2nd set of red text titled<br/>
&gt; Anti-Camping Update from Verant and come back here to hear what I have to<br/>
&gt; say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; O.K. So now you have read it.  I&#39;m sure you have you own idea how this is<br/>
&gt; going to affect you, but here is my issue with this. Limiting it<br/>
&gt; to one item<br/>
&gt; is bad in this way, I am not a camper that sits for hours to get<br/>
&gt; an item to<br/>
&gt; sell, I hunt to get my item and stay so my group gets what they came for<br/>
&gt; too.  Because these items are hard as hell to get ( had to sit 3<br/>
&gt; days to get<br/>
&gt; a Blood Stained tunic) if I happen to see another for sell, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; going to buy<br/>
&gt; it so I can have a spare.  Why do you need a spare, you ask?<br/>
&gt; Simple. Bodies<br/>
&gt; still vanish and Varent HATES (taking 4 days and massive mailing<br/>
&gt; to get) to<br/>
&gt; restore bodies from backup tape. Bodies still vanish for no good<br/>
&gt; reason and<br/>
&gt; they want to give 25th and higher level people crap replacement<br/>
&gt; kits.  There<br/>
&gt; are legitimate ways to  loose your body too.  Deep lava pits to name one.<br/>
&gt; We should be allowed to keep a spare of some thing in the bank if we wish.<br/>
&gt; Brad&#39;s plan would be great if it allowed you to have two of the<br/>
&gt; item and no<br/>
&gt; more until you sold or lost one of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Help me show him that two is the way to go with this.  Camping by super<br/>
&gt; powerful people so they can sell tons of these items because there is a<br/>
&gt; false supply and demand needs to be dealt with... allowing us to<br/>
&gt; have two of<br/>
&gt; a lore item will be just as good as allowing only one in this matter. But,<br/>
&gt; allowing two will help protect you from spending hours if not<br/>
&gt; days replacing<br/>
&gt; item when lost.  That item could be as close as the bank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any feedback would be gladly accepted, but please post it, do not send<br/>
&gt; directly to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thank you in advance for your help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
