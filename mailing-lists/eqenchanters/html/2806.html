<div id="ygrps-yiv-744615922">At 21 I could solo the aviaks in lake rathe or a rook in South Karana. Buff<br/>
me and pet, med to full, quickness on pet. Enthrall target. If not resisted,<br/>
tashini, languid pace, disempower then med till enthrall breaks, right at<br/>
edge of spell casting range. Cast choke as it comes in, let it hit me so the<br/>
pet gets on it, cast whirl at down 2 bubbles of health and back off. Recast<br/>
whirl is it comes at me, toss in a DD as mana available. Shouldn&#39;t be too<br/>
difficult to find a group doing harriers at 21 either. Me and a necro could<br/>
solo a harrier at 22. No clue on Kunark zones under 35. I did treants till<br/>
29, only druids you get KOS with are the ones in Surefall Glade and at East<br/>
and North Karana druid rings, have had no problems at any of the other druid<br/>
rings. When I need to be ported to North K by a druid I just invis myself<br/>
for the ride. Did the end of 29, 30, and into 31 in HighKeep, spent the rest<br/>
of 31 and some of 32 in Unrest in the ghost room. Went to Cazic till I was<br/>
34 (look for archon base or top groups or grid (sewer) groups). Hit Lguk at<br/>
34 and been there since, almost 45 now and doing my magic in Lord room.<br/>
