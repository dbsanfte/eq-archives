<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918554146">I realize this.  I have been an enchanter before, and used to use illusion<br/>
gnome simply because we looked cooler than my human norm.  This is not my<br/>
basis for my groundspeed observations.<br/>
<br/>
Example.  Zoning from high hold, My party walks and meets at the first sign<br/>
of the deep gorge in EK.  I cast Sow on everyone, then sit to med for a<br/>
brief sec, the party begins to run. I stand in time to see them round the<br/>
first corner and leave my field of vision.  I take off after them.  in the<br/>
middle of the gorge, I will encounter them, and they will be running at the<br/>
near same speed as me.  we will spend 30 seconds or so at the same place.<br/>
At the bottom of the gorge, I can then turn around, wait 3 seconds, and they<br/>
will become visible as they go running past me.  This is in a group of 4, 2<br/>
of which have a high speed connection to my dial up.  None of them are<br/>
encumbered.<br/>
<br/>
This test was done another time, but included a monk.  I made this change<br/>
when a monk emailed me saying that he never noticed outrunning anyone.  In<br/>
all tests with the monk, the monk was able to keep the same pace as I, if<br/>
not slightly faster.  The Gorge was not long enough to test the most tiny of<br/>
speed differences.<br/>
<br/>
Why do we use the Gorge in EK?  because it is very long, the size of some<br/>
zones, AND it forces people to travel the exact path.  <br/>
<br/>
These are my observations.<br/>
<br/>
Agility, up to 100, slightly increases ground speed.  Agility above 100 does<br/>
nothing extra.  If encumbered, and agility is still above 100, you still<br/>
slow to the same speed as someone who is encumbered by the same pounds at 50<br/>
agility.<br/>
<br/>
Weight from 0 to 50 seems to be the same.  Every pound over 50 seems to be a<br/>
slight decrease in speed.  Note that a change of 5 pounds is too slight to<br/>
notice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now for the disclaimer:  Having a 100 agility and a weight of 50 does not<br/>
let you run at sow speed, or even fast enough to outrun creatures that you<br/>
normally cannot outrun.  The Differences are very slight.  IN A NORMAL<br/>
SITUATION, WITH NORMAL MOVEMENT ACROSS A PLAIN, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO<br/>
DETECT A DIFFERENCE.  This is because you run a short bit, stop, turn, run a<br/>
short bit, turn.  Anyone who lags behind in a normal situation simply cuts<br/>
you off at a turn, making up the tiny bit of lost ground.  It is only<br/>
perceptible in long runs with no stopping in which everyone must follow the<br/>
EXACT same path.<br/>
<br/>
This thread began with someone asking why they, as an enchanter, could<br/>
outrun a warrior across the west karanas.  He did not say that he was at the<br/>
zone line and the other guy was only half way, he said that he was at the<br/>
zone line, they had both run the same time, but he made it several seconds<br/>
faster.  He said neither were encumbered, but he ( the enchanter ) somehow<br/>
outran the stronger warrior.<br/>
<br/>
Since I noticed that phenomenon some time ago, I have run the tests, whose<br/>
data you have been shown.  Each time I have said that the differences are<br/>
slight, and not normally noticeable.  They are not some idea to build a<br/>
character around ( I have won more than a few PP in footraces at guild<br/>
events ).  This is not something to even think about in the normal course of<br/>
adventuring, because it make NO difference in game terms.  It is merely<br/>
explaining a phenomena to someone who has asked a question.<br/>
<br/>
To put this in terms that some of you can understand, I am saying that a<br/>
dollar divided by 3 people is $0.333333333333333333333333333333333.  The<br/>
people who continue to write me ( off list ) angry emails telling me they<br/>
have never seen this, and since they are level 50 soandso, they must be<br/>
right, and I must be wrong in posting this, are saying that the correct<br/>
value is $0.33.  I continue to say, both are correct.  But if this is done<br/>
over the course of several billion dollars, a substantial amount will be<br/>
left unaccounted for.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this clears it up.</div>
