<div id="ygrps-yiv-205383695">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
I just hit 12th and am now overwhelmed by my spell options. I look at my<br/>
spell book and see alot of gems that have the same graphic and I haven&#39;t<br/>
learned them all yet.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason this is a bit more difficult for me is that I am primarily<br/>
grouped with my wife who plays a wizard. I have found that my primary<br/>
function is to Soothe anything but the one we want on a group spawn, she<br/>
roots and blasts while I wait for Root to break and cast WTYH, Choke and<br/>
Languid Pace.<br/>
<br/>
Offense / Defense: Abyssmal (have not been in melee long enough to get hit<br/>
very much).<br/>
<br/>
Evocation:Is so bad that I don&#39;t think it is above a 1 (if it has even<br/>
gotten that high as I have cast it so little).<br/>
<br/>
Conjuration: Whats that for? At 4th level, she had Root, and I had Fear<br/>
ready so she could root again.  At 8th I rooted / feared and that was it.<br/>
Now at 12th I WTYH. No need for a pet. I have yet to cast my pet spell. And<br/>
now that I have Charm.... I&#39;m not even sure I will ever use it.<br/>
Mezmerise uses conjuration I realize, but I have yet to have a need for it.<br/>
Color Flux has give me the time I need to get off a WTYH or fear as we have<br/>
been focusing on wandering mobs and 2 to 3 mob spawns.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even have time to cast Tashan as the mobs die so fast. I did in the<br/>
begining, but it seemed a waste of mana very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
What do you have as your standard spell line up at 12th?<br/>
Are you grouped with melee classes or other casters?<br/>
Should I take the time to summon a pet and Mez it for an hour to get my<br/>
skill up? Will I need it later in my career?<br/>
<br/>
My divination and Alteration are maxed. I love illusions (div) and buff<br/>
everyone I see normally. =)<br/>
<br/>
I know my wife and I will go far together with this combo, but I am worried<br/>
that I will lack the finess needed in a group of tanks when my guild goes on<br/>
raids and such. Anyone have any advice?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
