<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988011911">I am definitely no expert in PvP, but manage to hold my own.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll find that most of the time you are fighting people way over your<br/>
level or way under your level on Tallon.  For way over, unless you are at<br/>
full mana, full health, and they look hurt, it&#39;s best to Tashan and<br/>
Mesmerize and get out.  Enchanters aren&#39;t the best damage dealers.  Sure we<br/>
can hold our own, but you will usually lack the mana to finish an equal to<br/>
higher leveled melee type.  Spells only do 66% of damage to other players in<br/>
PvP, so usually you will run out of mana before they die, unless you are<br/>
being very efficient.  I fought against a higher level ranger one on one for<br/>
a long time, taking little damage, but eventually ran out of juice when I<br/>
was around level 20.  Ended with a mez and run.  Often with a lower level<br/>
caster, just a Mesmerize type spell and a Tashan is enough to scare them<br/>
away.  <br/>
<br/>
Now you will have enough mana to fight and kill the spell casters.  There<br/>
are a few good ways to do this.  Mesmerize is great (and it&#39;s upgrades).<br/>
Gives you time to think and even rearrage what spells you have ready. (How<br/>
intimidating is it for an opponant to stun you and sit down right in front<br/>
of you to mem spells?) When mezzed, hit them with Tashan or upgrade.  If you<br/>
are level 16 or higher, you can probably alternate between Chaotic Feedback<br/>
and Sanity Warp until they die (or other upgrades to DD spells).  Two more<br/>
great spells - Whirl til you Hurl and Eye of Confusion.  I always have those<br/>
memmed when PvPing.  Blind totally screws your opponent.  (they can&#39;t see,<br/>
can&#39;t &quot;hear&quot; messages on screen, and can&#39;t cast unless they have spells<br/>
hotkeyed).  Whirl total disables them.  They actually start spinning (love<br/>
that).  And you can blast away without &quot;waking them up.&quot;  Color flux is<br/>
great and is 1 sec casting interrupt.  You can color flux, nuke, color flux,<br/>
nuke, etc.  It gets really ugly when you cast Color shift in there too.<br/>
<br/>
Most of your fights will be group vs. group.  In that case, your sole job is<br/>
disabling.  Blind, WTYH, mezzing extras.  My guild did a small raid into<br/>
Runneye recently (just a group of six of us).  When we saw a full group of<br/>
lights at the entrance - Wham.  Area effect Mesmerization got them all.  &quot;Ok<br/>
which one do we kill first?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also, be very wary of faction.  Whoever gets the last hit (killing blow)<br/>
takes the faction hit.  Faction hits are bad.  Group with someone who<br/>
doesn&#39;t care about the hit (almost anybody but an enchanter).  Oh and it&#39;s<br/>
much much easier to PvP without a pet initially, because that little bugger<br/>
will alway interrupt your mezzes.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps some.<br/>
