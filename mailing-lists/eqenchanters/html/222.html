<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087303226">consider yourself lucky to have a higher level friend willing to get you that special item... I just love trying to hit something that&#39;s INVULNERABLE.<br/>
 <br/>
Does anyone know so far which 2H weapons does the most damage with little lag time? I know as spell casters, we rely mostly on our spells, but I it&#39;s fun to get my hand&#39;s dirty every once in a while :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve notice that guilds don&#39;t sell the complete spells for each level (ie Mercyl&#39;s Animation, and Enchant Silver (would love to try my luck at making magical jewelry)). Are these truely Uncommon/Rare as EverQuest Stratics say they are?<br/>

&gt;Greetings all,<br/>
&gt;I have read with great interest some of the rants on this here list and I<br/>
&gt;have to tell ya, y&#39;all are hilarious.  Everyone has their points and they<br/>
&gt;are good points.  2cp&#39;s worth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, on to the reply...<br/>
&gt;I was fortunate enuf to have a higher level friend who obtained for me the<br/>
&gt;ruined totem staff, there is a certain ghoul that has taken more of my lives<br/>
&gt;than anything else and I asked him to get it for me for the sole purpose of<br/>
&gt;retribution, big time!!  as for hitting other creatures with it, I hardly<br/>
&gt;use melee anymore, and I am only 10th lvl, but the Magic properties of this<br/>
&gt;fine weapon, the hitting of magical creatures, is well worth carrying it,<br/>
&gt;and besides, I could always sell it for the 3p+ I was offered for it from<br/>
&gt;the merchants.<br/>
