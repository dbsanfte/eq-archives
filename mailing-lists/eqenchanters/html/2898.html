<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725777753">This one I have seen used when a high level Bard was walking to the bank in<br/>
Kelethin.<br/>
&quot;Away beggar! You make me sick!&quot;<br/>
It caught my attention and I have never forgotten it. It was either hotkeyed<br/>
or he was using shift+up-arrow repeatedly. The bard had alot of people<br/>
following him into the bank. Hehe. This was about the time Lambient was new<br/>
and people knew he had to have money.<br/>
<br/>
That is the other things that annoys me. Just because you are mid-20s to 30s<br/>
everyone assumes you have plat to burn. We all know it isn&#39;t always true,<br/>
but tell that to a beggar! Heh. You have to save plat for your armor upgrade<br/>
and quest items to!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway..... oops, look what I started. LOL I love debates!<br/>

Ways to get rid of beggars (some actually performed):<br/>
<br/>
1.  say &quot;The begging skill is supposed to be used on NPC&#39;s, do I look like a<br/>
NPC to you?&quot;<br/>
2.  Challenge them to a duel<br/>
3.  Invite them, and port them to the middle of no where.  Say: Beg your way<br/>
out of that one.<br/>
4.  Ignore them<br/>
5.  Put on afk or feign afk<br/>
6.  Tell them the  POD gives away cool stuff and to beg something off of<br/>
him.<br/>
7.  say to them:  I know eq says I&quot;m lvl 30, but I&#39;m really lvl 3, do you<br/>
have any copper I can beg off of you?<br/>
8.  say:  Give me 5 good reasons you deserve this stuff more than that Orc<br/>
Pawn over there.<br/>
9.  start a conversation with yourself outloud about what a true newbie is<br/>
10.  ask them, Why does verant let ppl like you play a game like this<br/>
anyway?<br/>
<br/>
If you ask my eq husband, he will tell you I am actually a very nice person<br/>
and give stuff away all the time.  I get tired though, of every time I<br/>
decide to visit Gfay, I seem to get bombarded with ppl asking me for things<br/>
all the time.  And the WORST is when they ask me if they can have sow, and<br/>
then I say, i&#39;m sorry, i&#39;m an ench, they say, oo, well, can I have sow? uhh<br/>
lol<br/>
<br/>
Please dont take any of those lines personally, just jokin around.  Thanks<br/>
:)<br/>
