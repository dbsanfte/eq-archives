Blind will not stop it from attacking you in my experience<br/>
&lt;/snip&gt;<br/>
Using Sunbeam with my druid, I have had some experience with the Blind<br/>
spell. What I can tell you is that if you are within melee agro range, the<br/>
MoB will come after you. However, if you Tash, Stun, Blind and back out of<br/>
agro range it will wander around &quot;aimlessly&quot;. DD, DoT, enter agro to lead it<br/>
away from more help, etc. I do not have much experience with the Enchanter<br/>
side of the house, so I was wondering if an Enchanter can kill a mob with<br/>
this tactic alone (ie no pet).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Whirl is a stun, Once pet hits or you land a DD WTYH will break.<br/>
&lt;/snip&gt;<br/>
I was under the impression that when stunned, the MoB is stunned for the<br/>
duration no matter what you did to the mob (melee, DD, or DoT). I know when<br/>
my char gets stunned, it can&#39;t do squat until the &quot;You are no longer<br/>
stunned!&quot; message appears.<br/>
Or am I wrong here and the dogs, er gods, of Norrath don&#39;t treat this the<br/>
same for MoBs and Characters?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
As you get higher in level you will want to use Charm OVER having a pet,<br/>
this will allow you to take out TWO or more mobs with less mana. Remember to<br/>
refresh your charm if you have an extended battle.<br/>
&lt;/snip&gt;<br/>
Is this suggestion because of the mana drain from the Charm spell? I know a<br/>
MoB will hit for alot more than a Pet. The idea of a pet at 24 that hits in<br/>
the 50s is very appealing. What does an animation hit for at 24th?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thicken Mana revisited:<br/>
After you create a Vial-O-Mana, can you right click on it to regain that<br/>
mana? Or is it&#39;s only purpose for the Wu Gauntlets at this time?<br/>
<br/>
I am used to soloing with my Druid. Is there anyone that has soloed to<br/>
50th?Stupid people are very common so I try to avoid them as much as<br/>
possible. Low levels are bad enough, but to lose xp because of other&#39;s<br/>
stupidity is more than frustrating. If I die because of something I do, then<br/>
I learn and go on. Anyway, solo sugestions and experiences are very welcome.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
