<div id="ygrps-yiv-723000451">I dont think that any of the optional files will have a detrimental effect<br/>
on your computer.... everything un-kunark is designed to work on a computer<br/>
with the requirements for the original game.  Playing EQ on a 166 is pretty<br/>
painful, however, and I feel for you.  You might consider finding another 32<br/>
megs of ram somewhere... that will make the experience much more enjoyable,<br/>
and save you the half an hour zone times to boot.  One thing you should<br/>
notice that has been added is the ability to move the clip plane in closer<br/>
to your character... this can help you with game performance substantially<br/>
if you find yourself lagging a little more than you like.  You can reach<br/>
this on the second page of the display options within the game.  If that<br/>
doesnt help enough, try tuning off the sky, and lower the particle density.<br/>
If you can, turn on mip mapping (Glide based cards).<br/>
<br/>
For the most part... our class has been left alone beyond making our pets a<br/>
little slower with daggers (they changed the way weapon delay affects pets)<br/>
and taking fear & charm away from PvP situations (you cant charm or fear<br/>
another player).  You&#39;ll notice that our mez line of spells cast faster now,<br/>
what a wonderful improvement that was!  There have been some faction changes<br/>
with our illusions, I dont think we can wander around solA with illusion :<br/>
air elemental anymore.  The newbie guards that protect most city gates are<br/>
quite strong now... but I doubt you&#39;ll be attacking them anytime soon if<br/>
you&#39;ve been away for so long, just be assured that they will most likely be<br/>
there for you to run to when you get overwhelmed with rats or spiders.<br/>
<br/>
Something that makes me never want to give up this class : Last night I was<br/>
in my favorite solo hunting grounds (the oasis of marr spectre tower)...<br/>
sitting on the south shore with a necromancer of my level (hell level 45).<br/>
We were not grouped, but instead were fighting solo alongside each other.  I<br/>
would run across the water to grab some spectres, and enthrall one on the<br/>
beach for my necro friend while pulling the remaining 2-3 spectres over the<br/>
next sand dune.  I was able to kill 2 spectres quite easily in the time it<br/>
took my necro friend to kill the one I had left him.  As I left for the<br/>
night, his parting words were &#39;Now I see why they took charm out of PvP...<br/>
you would slay whole groups of people with ease.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
and he was right.<br/>

Subject: [eqenchanters] Return of an Enchanter<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hallo all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been on the list forever but haven&#39;t played in forever too... Just<br/>
went<br/>
&gt; out and bought a copy of the original game-my computer isn&#39;t smart enough<br/>
&gt; 166/32mb/4mb vid card-and I&#39;m wondering about the optional files offered<br/>
&gt; when you first start up a copy of the game and click the &#39;play online&#39;<br/>
&gt; button.(Not talking about the register Kunark button) I&#39;m wondering if<br/>
these<br/>
&gt; files are too much for my computer too handle, system spec wise, and what<br/>
&gt; they happen to contain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And yes, I&#39;m still going to play an Enchanter, again, even knowing how<br/>
&gt; annoying the class can be. I can&#39;t help it, Enchanters are without a doubt<br/>
&gt; the iconoclastic class in the game, the enigma to many, and seeing the<br/>
mana<br/>
&gt; speed up spells I&#39;m sure one of the most bothered classes-a&#39;la SoW-in the<br/>
&gt; game, which is fine with me most times because I love chatting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And Since I haven&#39;t played in about a year, I&#39;ll try to start up a debate!<br/>
&gt; What are the best and worst changes to the Enchanters as of late? What<br/>
makes<br/>
&gt; you spittin mad and what makes you want to never give up the class??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks,<br/>
