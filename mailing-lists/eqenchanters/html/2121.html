Evo is not really a nessecity, even at level 8.<br/>
&lt;Snip&gt;<br/>
Since the 8th level spell Chaotic Feedback is the upgrade for our 1st level<br/>
DD spell, and the 12th Level spell Choke is the upgrade to our 4th level DoT<br/>
spell do you mind telling me how you advanced in level without using them<br/>
that much?  Is it because you group all the time? I solo alot do to lag<br/>
issues, which makes me unreliable in groups. This makes things tough, but I<br/>
find it necessary to be able to rely on my current Rank of spells. This<br/>
means keeping all the Spell Abilities maxxed as quickly as possible.<br/>
I already see that Enchanters alternate upgrades to DD and Dot spells every<br/>
other Rank. That makes for an Interesting combination. I will play around<br/>
with that tonight.<br/>

AND STOP NUKING YOURSELF.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Since I am only 4th level and I do not have this spell yet, I&#39;m not nuking<br/>
myself. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;another rant&gt;<br/>
I have known something was not right and I just figured it out why it was<br/>
bothering me. Our Level 1 DD spell (and every DoT spell) is an Alteration<br/>
spell. Every DD spell afer 1st level except the AE DD spell at 39th level is<br/>
Evocation. Why the change? By this I mean why did it go from an Alteration<br/>
spell at 1st to an Evocation spell up until level 39 where it becomes an<br/>
Alteration spell, and then back to an Evocation spell?<br/>
<br/>
Also, why do we skip an upgrade to the 12th level DoT at 20th level? This is<br/>
the only level that this happens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, get me going and I can&#39;t stop. Expect alot of twisted questions<br/>
from me. Why? Because I like active lists. :-)<br/>

&quot;I hate not knowing why.  I can handle anything as long as I understand<br/>
why.&quot;</div>
