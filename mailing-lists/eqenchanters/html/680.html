<b>Subject:</b> Medium sized cloth armor in Freeport? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194392522">As the title says, is there anywhere in FP to purchase medium sized cloth<br/>
armor?  You would think being a human town there is, but so far all I can<br/>
find is 2 pieces for sale in North Ro.</div>
