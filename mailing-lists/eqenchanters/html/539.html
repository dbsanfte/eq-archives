<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793423990">you did the right thing.  Don&#39;t worry about assholes like that.  They ruin<br/>
the game and if people like you don&#39;t petition, they get away with it and<br/>
ruin it for more people.  And, judging by how he was harrassing you<br/>
afterwards, he&#39;s gonna get banned, not just filed away and forgotten.<br/>

I&#39;m just glad the GM showed up; they&#39;re rarely on Karana it seems.<br/>
