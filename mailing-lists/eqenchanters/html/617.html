<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164428780">*This brought<br/>
*a couple of questions to mind.  Would his charmed self have <br/>
*been able to<br/>
*attack other players?  I&#39;m thinking yes... but not sure.  What happens<br/>
*if he dies?  Do they loot him?  I&#39;m thinking no... but again not sure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, he could attack other players, since he was a &quot;MOB&quot; now.  Don&#39;t know if<br/>
they could loot him though. Good question. Anyone? Bueller?</div>
