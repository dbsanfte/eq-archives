&gt;         You still didn&#39;t answer my question, fellas....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         if it&#39;s LORE ITEM then what do you do with the Stein you already<br/>
&gt; have?  give it to someone to hold?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Generally (with the three I have done (1 was a friend, other 2 people<br/>
who wanted me to do it for a fee)) I trade them the stein, they give me<br/>
the fee, plus the 4 ingredients (I am not going to run all over north<br/>
for just a bit of cash)<br/>

&gt;         Also, is the Book  NO DROP or just LORE?  I forget....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         I&#39;d like to complete this quest again to sell one....I need the cash<br/>
&gt; badly to work on my jewelry some more...I spent over 200pp last night and<br/>
&gt; went from 43 to 48 in Jewelry.  ouch!!  that hurts!!<br/>
