<div id="ygrps-yiv-353676868">Lemme tell you right now.<br/>
Have any of you heard of Legends of Kesmai?<br/>
It was a Online Rpg game much like UO just not as good graphics. The Game was pretty damn big which put the feel for exploration in me and many others. Anyway the problem that many people had said about that was 1 There were never enough updates 1 a year if we were lucky. 2 The Better stuff we ask for and like make us invincible and all Takes all the fun out, Why the hell would you wanna level fast? I wanna have a character when i&#39;m 15 years of age to when i&#39;m age of 50 and still not maxed out in my level. It&#39;s much more fun, Realistic, The hell with all the whinin, P.s. There are spots in the game where people cheat to kill monsters without the monsters reaching them. These are called BUGS, And exploitation of these bugs can prevent on being band (I reported this specific one) I can think of two more which come to mind so i will report those too. It&#39;s not fun watching someone level faster by cheating their way to get exp. I mean seriously would you gain in real life exp. If you sat there doing the same thing over and over and over and over. Kill sit med Kill sit med. What&#39;s so experiencing about that?<br/>

&gt; I didnt mean to show any attitude here. I rarely die<br/>
&gt; with my enchanter<br/>
&gt; really. I&#39;ve been leveling faster than the people<br/>
&gt; who play with me. I agree<br/>
&gt; that some parts need to be revised and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; submitted my own list yesterday,<br/>
&gt; but the general idea I got from several e-mails<br/>
&gt; here, was that people wanted<br/>
&gt; to quit their enchanters because they dont level<br/>
&gt; fast enough. I dont want to<br/>
&gt; level too fast. I make sure I dont level too fast in<br/>
&gt; fact. I want to visit<br/>
&gt; all areas of the world that are at my level while I<br/>
&gt; still can. But that&#39;s my<br/>
&gt; own point of view. I didnt know about the agnostic<br/>
&gt; thing for illusions since<br/>
&gt; I am agnostic. That sucks, it&#39;s true. But I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; dark elfs being killed<br/>
&gt; by their own guards after killing Dorn too many<br/>
&gt; times. As a matter of fact,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard that most dark elf enchanters actually<br/>
&gt; end being hated by their<br/>
&gt; guards...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, you&#39;ll have to tell me where I&#39;m a masochist<br/>
&gt; because I dont get it.<br/>

&gt; You know, you have a good point, but you ruin it<br/>
&gt; with the attitude that<br/>
&gt; because we complain that our spells are ruined, and<br/>
&gt; we are not balanced with<br/>
&gt; other casters, that we are automatically level<br/>
&gt; hungry powergamers.  I think<br/>
&gt; it is you who miss the point.  I was one of the<br/>
&gt; earlier enchanters because<br/>
&gt; the class sounded so like what I wanted in the<br/>
&gt; manual.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Earlier, there were no animations, and they were all<br/>
&gt; in HK.  No problem.  We<br/>
&gt; adapted.<br/>
&gt; Okay, we got animations, now suddenly resists<br/>
&gt; mysteriously become worse.<br/>
&gt; Okay, again we adapted, and waited four our promised<br/>
&gt; Tashan upgrade.  We get<br/>
&gt; our Tashini, but wait, our most valuable spell is<br/>
&gt; suddenly made worthless.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All of this has nothing to do with powergaming level<br/>
&gt; mongering.  Add in the<br/>
&gt; fact we need to be agnostic or illusions are<br/>
&gt; worthless, stupid quirks with<br/>
&gt; minor illusions, and the utter complete lack of any<br/>
&gt; viable enchanting, and<br/>
&gt; you discover why people are quitting the class in<br/>
&gt; droves.  I&#39;m glad you like<br/>
&gt; it, but most of us are not into such masochism.<br/>

&gt; I had a level 16 dark elf necro that I started on<br/>
&gt; the first day of the<br/>
&gt; release. It took me 4 &#39;played&#39; days and a half to<br/>
&gt; get it to level 16. then I<br/>
&gt; gave it up. I have now a level 16 enchanter. It took<br/>
&gt; me 12 &#39;played&#39; days to<br/>
&gt; make it to 16... You think that&#39;s a problem for me?<br/>
&gt; I had so much more fun<br/>
&gt; playing an enchanter. What&#39;s the deal with this<br/>
&gt; level race? Sometimes I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; spend an hour travelling back and forth just to say<br/>
&gt; hi to a friend I havent<br/>
&gt; seen for a long time. Right now, I&#39;m hunting in<br/>
&gt; CrushBone and I barely make<br/>
&gt; any xp where I could be soloing in Lavastorm and<br/>
&gt; make a shit load of xp and<br/>
&gt; money..but what&#39;s the big deal? I enjoy playing<br/>
&gt; Everquest a lot more now.<br/>
&gt; Powergaming is so boring. So are those people who<br/>
&gt; start a race everytime  a<br/>
&gt; new server comes up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; my 2 cents,<br/>
