<div id="ygrps-yiv-417912335">Great tale, and I hope others of you are meeting with<br/>
such success.  I, too, have gained great fame as a<br/>
trainbuster.  I think that you have learned earier<br/>
than most how powerful and ench can be.  Just you wait<br/>
until you are busting trains in the planes with a<br/>
charmed forsaken revanant or loathing lich.  Now that<br/>
will make you some lifelong fans!<br/>
<br/>
With regards to you skeleton question, remember that<br/>
undead are not affacted by any illusions or<br/>
invisibility... hence the need for a special invis to<br/>
undead.<br/>
