<br/>
I will offer you some advice at your current skill level: Stop with silver<br/>
and start with electrum now. Work with electrum and malachite, as the<br/>
failures with that combo (3p) cost far less than a failure with silver and<br/>
pearl or higher. You will succeed fairly often, and this combo will raise<br/>
you all the way up to the mid 70&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of being undercut, I have convinced no less than half a dozen<br/>
others who were selling their items ridiculously cheap to raise their<br/>
prices. How? A number of ways really. My first /tell to them is along the<br/>
lines of my past success at selling such items at a substantially higher<br/>
price. If they are primarily greedy, this will usually suffice. I usually<br/>
follow that up with marketing advice, such as reminding everyone about the<br/>
added benefits of extra intelligence when you are trying to raise a trade<br/>
skill such as blacksmithing. If you can&#39;t sell a pair of +2 int rings for<br/>
15p, then either you aren&#39;t marketing very well, or the zone has been<br/>
spammed for too long by someone selling them for 3p each.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is, most people will raise their prices if you ask them<br/>
politely, suggest what the new price would be, and tell them that you have<br/>
been having success selling the items at that.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the jewelcrafting patch is the best thing to happen to me in the game<br/>
thus far. I started on Tuesday morning with 23p, and when I logged out last<br/>
night, I had almost 500p! Not a bad nest egg for a 16th level enchanter, eh?<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s awfully quiet out there today....you must have all had a good<br/>
&gt; weekend,<br/>
&gt; like I did....raised my jeweling skill from 22 to 38 over the past<br/>
&gt; week....any other success stories?  Is that a normal rate?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Working with jade and pearl now....the pearl rings are a hard sell...even<br/>
&gt; at 12pp each..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i noticed a lot of jewelers selling their wares for a lower cost then<br/>
&gt; mine...seems like I&#39;m getting cut....I&#39;ve been selling for about twice the<br/>
&gt; cost of materials...seems like a fair rule for prices (considering all the<br/>
&gt; factors and costs involved in getting skill high enough to even work with<br/>
&gt; the better stones)....but I saw a few people selling jade rings for<br/>
&gt; 6pp???!!!!   Ouch!  10pp is what I&#39;ve been selling them for.....and until<br/>
&gt; someone auctions a lower price, I had no problem getting that price.   It<br/>
&gt; pains me greatly to see it happen...so I politely ask the vendors to raise<br/>
&gt; the selling price a little....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any thoughts?<br/>
