Upcoming Enchanter Additions <br/>
EverQuest Enchanters got the lowdown from Verant Interactive&#39;s Geoffrey Zatkin about upcoming additions and fixes to the Enchanter class. Here&#39;s what will be updated: <br/>
Alliance will be upgraded possibly in next Mondays Update <br/>
A new Whirl Till You Hurl 2 spell is becoming available for us on Monday for use on creatures 30 + which will be more effective on them. <br/>
Avoid using any spell which causes stun whilst Whirling (CF, SW, Swarm, etc). Apparently next Monday the patch is going to reduce the chance of bash and stun breaking Whirl. For now though you may want to stick to rooting or DoT - Kiting if you can get a SoW. <br/>
Only Monsters of Level 30+ should have got the increased save against Blur. <br/>
This quote &quot;Enchanters are tricky, because of the power of their spells. At high levels they are SO deadly that we are having to tone down some of their spells.&quot; The Rune series of spells will now also provide AC bonus as well as HP absorption. They will stack with haze series.</div>
