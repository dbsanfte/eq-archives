<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554947496">Currently in both scenarios you will not get the loot.<br/>
<br/>
Scenario 1:<br/>
<br/>
This scenario involved causing your charmed Player (pet) to commit suicide <br/>
against a griffon.  You do not get the loot if you have the person die as <br/>
your pet.  Yes, you were in control of them, but you did not get the kill -- <br/>
therefore -- no loot.<br/>
<br/>
Scenario Two:<br/>
<br/>
This scenario involved having your charmed player (pet) kill another player.  <br/>
There is a bug in the pet system right now.  If your pet gets the final blow, <br/>
you will not be able to loot the person.  This is true of all pets <br/>
(enchanter/necro/magician/etc).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to loot the person, you will have to work a little harder than <br/>
that.</div>
