&gt; I have a friend dwarf who has found some strange pages on recently killed<br/>
&gt; orc centurions and oracles.  He sold them for somewheres around 6PP per<br/>
&gt; page (he had 2 of them)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These could be the pages and he found them on orcs at a camp in the<br/>
&gt; butcherblock mountains.<br/>
