<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093975876">South Karana will be the same group of people you saw in Lake Rathe, so if<br/>
you like them, go there. Unrest is a great area for low 20&#39;s to low 30&#39;s,<br/>
unfortunately on my server (Cazic Thule), Unrest is a ghost town. Upper Guk<br/>
is usually empty all the time, mainly do to the fact that right next to the<br/>
high blue/white con area you are in is either reds or greens, and most<br/>
groups  are casual with runners. The Temple of Cazic Thule I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
recommend until mid to high 20&#39;s as the best spots to hunt at low to mid<br/>
20&#39;s are dead ends in the maze, tight quarters to do crowd control in. High<br/>
Keep basement is a popular area to hunt, so you would almost always be<br/>
assured of finding a group (or more likely a list during primetimes), though<br/>
space is limited.<br/>

&gt; Hello fellow enchanters, its me again :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>

ideas on the best place?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Also:  Im a little low lvl yet, as far as i can tell, to do the quest for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the incandescent gloves and mask.  Does anyone know what they sell for? Or<br/>
