<div id="ygrps-yiv-292122135">To Whom It May Concern:<br/>
<br/>
I would first like to thank you for the new quest and the hard work you have<br/>
put into them, but concerning the Cleric quests I have some issues to raise.<br/>
<br/>
Though I can see several reasons why you might want a long spawn rate on the<br/>
items (avoid everyone getting all the items in a week, seeming not to be a<br/>
challenging, ect) it does not aid in your anti camping campaign nor prevent<br/>
players from taking advantage of the system.  The spawn rate on the items is<br/>
7 hours and has a static placement.  This does not prevent camping or those<br/>
who just time the spawn.  Case in point: After a fellow cleric got the icon<br/>
or ingot of the Reliant (one on the tree stump), I knew when it would spawn.<br/>
To try and make things far (i.e. not just pop in and grab it) I showed up at<br/>
the spot 3 hours before the spawn with no one else there I sat and waited.<br/>
So, there I sat and 5 minutes before the spawn a lower level cleric pops in<br/>
( Samari Boudreaux of the guild Champions of Norrath) and then takes the<br/>
item as it spawns even though I had asked her to back away and that I had<br/>
been waiting for 3 hours.<br/>
<br/>
So, add in that it will take another 7 hours to spawn, that I feel cheated,<br/>
that I wasted my time, I was angered by the situation as much as I was angry<br/>
that a fellow cleric that would act this way and that I could expect this<br/>
type of nonsense as many as 12 more times, and you have one very upset<br/>
Dwarf.  If others are feeling this way, if Samari did what she did because<br/>
she felt it was fair and the only way she could get one in the next day,<br/>
then the system needs changed.<br/>
<br/>
I will not pop in after timing something and take it if someone has spent<br/>
his or her time waiting on it.  Though I am know as a grumpy Dwarf<br/>
(role-play is such a release :)) I am not and will not be know as a thief.<br/>
I have worked hard for my reputation of being one of the best healers, being<br/>
honest and being fair.  I want to enjoy the game and help others enjoy the<br/>
game.  I make it a personal daily quest to aid 3 people I have never met<br/>
before, be it Resurrecting them, leading safely through a dangerous zone, or<br/>
healing them just in the nick or time.  As a 50th level cleric of Brell,<br/>
that is what makes the game fun for me.  I was delighted that there were<br/>
finally some true cleric quests, but after seeing how they are setup and<br/>
trying two of them, I see now they are going to cause arguments and<br/>
frustrations.<br/>
<br/>
I may not be a very elegant writer, but I hope I have laid this out in a<br/>
constructive way.  I hate to see so much of an effort put into the game to<br/>
make it better actually have a reverse affect.  With an excessively long<br/>
spawn and non-random spawning times, these quest will only cause more player<br/>
to player issues.<br/>
<br/>
In closing, I petitioned the event that happened to me and was contacted by<br/>
guide Delkath who said that he would forward my concerns upward and then<br/>
gave me this address to contact you directly.  He (I assume it was a he) was<br/>
kind in words and I was satisfied with the assistance.  Please consider<br/>
decreasing the spawn time and/or making it random.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Scott Murphy<br/>

P.S. this is CC not to rant, but to inform and hope for some constructive<br/>
feedback. Thanks.</div>
