hate to bust your bubble, but our pets suck, and they wont attack unless<br/>
we get hit, so an army of enchanters going into a camp, rooting, then<br/>
getting beat up so our pets can attack, then they die, then we die.<br/>

OK I will make an attempt to change the tone of this gourp.<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
I would like to form an enchanter Arm and march into battle with some<br/>
enemy race. What I invision is an entire army of invisible Enchanter<br/>
marching righ into the Enemy camp and out of no where summoning our pets<br/>
and routing every one in sight.∩┐╜ Imagine multiple squads of 6 suddenly<br/>
becoming 12∩┐╜ as we summon. Imagine marching to justwithin casting range<br/>
and rooting every enenmy then casting∩┐╜ DOT spells while another unit<br/>
moves in for with pets and finishes them up. If anyone of you would like<br/>
to experiment with this let me know. I also think that it would make<br/>
people think about the powers of enchanters. We do have some of the best<br/>
spells out there but we have to use them a little more creatively.<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
Thanks<br/>
