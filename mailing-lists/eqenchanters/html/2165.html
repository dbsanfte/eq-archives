The maximum you can put in at each level is determined by the skill cap for<br/>
your level.  I think the formulas include the following:<br/>
primary skills: (formula differs for monks, rogues dual wield, double<br/>
attack)<br/>
(level + 1) x 5<br/>
<br/>
secondary skills:<br/>
(level + 1) x 3<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know that formula for skill caps. At level 8 my Evocation skill cap will<br/>
be 45. As of now, I think I have trained 2 points into Evocation at level 1<br/>
and or 2. This would give me a skill of 3 or 4 right now at level 4. I still<br/>
have 10 training points to spend. At 8th I will have 20 more points (if I<br/>
don&#39;t spend them on something else) for a total of 30.<br/>
My questionwas meant to read:<br/>
At 8th level can I put all 30 points into Evocation or will I need to split<br/>
it up over more than one level?  e.g. 	Train once at 8th: 30 points into<br/>
Evocation<br/>
	or<br/>
	Train at 4th level: 10<br/>
	Train at 5th level: 5<br/>
	Train at 6th level: 5<br/>
	Train at 7th level: 5<br/>
	Train at 8th level: 5<br/>
	Evocation Skill: 33-34 points.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
