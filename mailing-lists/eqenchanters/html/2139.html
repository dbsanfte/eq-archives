Almost forgot!  Color Flux is your friend!<br/>

LOL! I just remembered a story I read from an Enchanter in Kelethin. He was<br/>
testing his new spells, and was trying out Color Flux.  He was attacking<br/>
something underneith the city itself which he pulled there from the forrest.<br/>
Shortly after hitting the Color Flux hot-key a few times he noticed<br/>
Merchants from the city above started jumping onto the ground around him.<br/>
HEH! He had enough time to think: WTF? when they started to beat the crap<br/>
out of him. It was a short battle.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this is fixed, but I would be careful using this in dungeons<br/>
that stack rooms. If you hit it while on 1st floor Befallen, you may end up<br/>
bringing the Elf Skeleton from the 3rd door up to the top floor.<br/>
I think this is similar to the Rogue ability Sense Traps. I works in your<br/>
general area, but does not take into account virtical displacement. Either<br/>
does Levitate (MoBs still know you are over their head at 50 feet and can<br/>
still punch you from the ground). Ah well.<br/>
<br/>
Or am I totally off as to why this may have happened.<br/>
