<div><font size="2">I&quot;m told that the enchanters spell - soothe - is pretty 
useless, and the druids harmony will beat it anytime.&nbsp; Depending on the 
camp, root can be helpful in pulling less mobs, also one I have used&nbsp;is 
Mesmerize (and series).&nbsp; When you cast these though, any other nearby 
associated mobs will come running, so be careful.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">Mesmerize is described as such (from eq.castersrealm.com)- lvl 
8-</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">
<p>Mesmerise when successfully cast upon the NPC target holds the monster is a 
mesmerised state for around 30 seconds. During this time any non-damage debuff 
may be cast upon the target. These include Tashan, the Weaken Series, or Slow 
Series. 
<p>An mesmerised target has a chance of having its Hate List wiped, similiar to 
the effects of Memory Blur. Just make sure you are beyond the frenzy range when 
it wears off to increase your chance of success. </p>
<p>Example:&nbsp; I use mes to pull when i kill guards in WC or the dwarves 
nearby.&nbsp; Each camp having two mobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the mob has high magic resistance, you might be able to tashan it first 
(both come running) and get one mez (or in my cast entrance) before they hit 
you.&nbsp; Your taking a change thou :p</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

  <div><br></div><tt>Ok, I hit 12th last night and am at the Nybrite camp. How 
  much exactly does<br>soothe reduce the agro range by? So far I have only been 
  able to take out<br>Kayla by the tree. Every time I try for Shayla (they are 
  all even fights<br>right now) I soothe Tay and Jay and even throw one on Shay, 
  back way up and<br>cast Tashan. Now it may have been a fluke, but&nbsp; my pet 
  engaged her too close<br>to Jay and ended up pulling her to. It still happened 
  when my pet didn&#39;t<br>attack her early. I have run to MM several times no 
  matter how many times I<br>try to pull Shay. Help? Druidic Harmony cannot be 
  beat at this camp. *sigh*<br><br><br>I was also told to try Cognoggin (13 
  warrior). Where is he located? I was<br>told by the gnomes in LFay, but will I 
  be able to pull him without any other<br>mobs coming after me? I know he is on 
  faerie faction, which I don&#39;t give a<br>hoot about, just like Gearheart and 
  the Queen. Anyone know a loc?<br><br><br>--<br>Uthanatos<br>Gnome
