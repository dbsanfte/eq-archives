<b>Subject:</b> Re: CHAR vs WIS vs INT .......STOP THE INSANIT Y!!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209070925">When you create an Enchanter, your two main attributes are Charisma and<br/>
Intelligence. They are highlighted green indicating the most import<br/>
attributes for the Enchanter. <br/>
<br/>
When I created my High Elf, I max&#39;d out my INT and dumped the rest into<br/>
CHA. I had not played an Enchanter so I wasn&#39;t sure how else to split<br/>
the stats.  I have another character at 16th level in which I did NOT<br/>
max out the two main stats because I had played this type of character<br/>
in beta and knew I needed some extra points in other attributes.<br/>

Just one last comment that many people have seemed to have missed....<br/>
CHA<br/>
effect many of the charm based spells yes that is true, the thing you<br/>
all<br/>
are forgeting is that many of enchanter spells even if not named CHARM<br/>
spell<br/>
are charm based, meaning that CHARISMA does have an effect on them,<br/>
which<br/>
spells fall under this catagory I am not sure but I have talked to a few<br/>
GM<br/>
and they have stated that many of our spells fall under this catagory.<br/>
