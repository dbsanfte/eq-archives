&gt; As i was reading another list they mentioned the silver coins. The<br/>
location<br/>
&gt; of all the coins except one are in pools of water. The one in Erudin is in<br/>
&gt; the fountain and is the only one i have seen, but then again i havent been<br/>
&gt; looking for them i didnt know what to do with it so it only took up space.<br/>
&gt; At least now i know where to go with it, as i find them i will let the<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; know where they are located.<br/>
