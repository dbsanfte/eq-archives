<div id="ygrps-yiv-320947273">I have gone with alteration myself. I have heard a lot of arguments for<br/>
conjuration over alteration, but I am quite happy with alteration. I&#39;ve been<br/>
in Lower Guk and Sol B almost exclusively since I hit level 34 and the main<br/>
time I go low on mana is when I am doing buffs, almost all alterations. The<br/>
only time with good groups I go low on mana fighting is when 5 or 6 critters<br/>
get pulled, keeping them under control does take a fair amount of mana. Most<br/>
groups evac or die in Lower Guk when they pull that many and don&#39;t have a<br/>
good chanter, I can settle for using 80% of my mana versus maybe 60% if I<br/>
had specialized in conjuration to keep the medding time down when I throw<br/>
500+ mana buffing. Downtime is what kills rate of experience, and I have yet<br/>
to have a fight where I had to go OOM or close to where the other casters<br/>
weren&#39;t as bad off or worse than I was.<br/>
