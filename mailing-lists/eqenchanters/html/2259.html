Religion will get in the way and the base race faction is often not enough <br/>
to make up for it.<br/>
Also faction modifiers like killing people they like will affect you.  You <br/>
may be seen as an Ogre killer of Bouncers but darn it your a murdering <br/>
scumbag who will be Killed On Sight!<br/>
Happily the Alliance series does help in this regard but  you may find <br/>
only the highest lelve versions are good enough.<br/>
Should be able to get you in close enough to do some Quests or kill <br/>
froglicks or something though.<br/>

Welcome James,<br/>
<br/>
(everyone feel free to correct me. :)  )<br/>
<br/>
Casting illusion Ogre will give you the _Base_ faction of an ogre.  My<br/>
assumption is take that base faction, and subtract all the faction hits <br/>
you<br/>
took from killing all of those bouncers (dont&#39; forget your religion), and <br/>
the<br/>
ending result will be the _Actual_ faction with the Ogre.  If you kill <br/>
enough<br/>
bouncers the illusion won&#39;t make a difference.  If you are still KOS try<br/>
casting alliance/benevolence, to increase faction.<br/>
<br/>
Check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a>  the descriptions of the spells there for<br/>
enchanters (and any other caster for that matter) are very good. :)<br/>
