&gt; a friend of mine just brought this to my attention, something i hadnt<br/>
&gt; thought of.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; if no one wants a nice item to get nerfed, dont post a spoiler on how to<br/>
&gt; get it. this item had been in game for a while, and only recently had it<br/>
&gt; been discovered and spoiled. now it&#39;s most likely gonna get nerfed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>um wrong the item has been in-game, maybe, but the quest to obtain it<br/>
was broken. Gregor used to give you an ogre head (which is for another<br/>
ogre quest, I think) instead of the barkeep compendium like he was<br/>
supposed to. verant has this perverse idea that anything useful is evil<br/>
so they nerf it (hmm, you think casters might actually want to get the<br/>
glowing stein? maybe!), and has an on-going crusade against enchanters<br/>
;) They are conspiring against us! Which leads to another question, why<br/>
in Gods name would and Ogre give out a int boosting item? HELLO! Ogres<br/>
are supposed to be stupid, and all their casters are wis based!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lesson to be learned: dont post spoilers. they only lead to an influx of an<br/>
&gt; item into the world at unbelievably high rates, later to be nerfed or<br/>
&gt; removed...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah if it can&#39;t be camped Verant might nerf it, and they profess to be<br/>
against camping!<br/>
