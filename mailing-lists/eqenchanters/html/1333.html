<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Even ignoring the advertising time you spend, the extra backpacks, all the<br/>
&gt; time you spend zoning back and forth to get metal and gems, all the time<br/>
&gt; meditating to charm the bars, etc., just think about how much money you<br/>
&gt; spent getting your skill up to the point at which you could make the items<br/>
&gt; you are selling. I know I personally spent about 350p getting my skill up<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; where it is...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Your selling to low. 6 plat should be bare min for those. Think of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cost<br/>
&gt; &gt; too you not only in terms of materials but in advertising, in holding<br/>
&gt; off<br/>
&gt; &gt; selling the stuff to an npc for immediate return, for storage in your<br/>
&gt; &gt; inventory. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;	I&#39;ve noticed that latency and packet loss will tremendously effect<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;my success/fail rate...so watch your meter...if it&#39;s over 600, don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;bother....<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;	btw, I made several pieces of jewelry last night..my first magical<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;items yet....and sold the bloodstone, Lapis, carnelian for 3pp<br/>
&gt; each...and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the Amber ones for 4pp....am I selling too low?  I still had to work at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;finding buyers...so my guess is that I was right on target...taking a<br/>
&gt; &gt; small<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;markup above the cost of materials...since the added bonus to stats was<br/>
&gt; &gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;2 or 3... </span></blockquote></div>
