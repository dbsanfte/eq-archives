<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271450177">Directions:<br/>
Find your way to the scryer room.<br/>
Head down the ramp from the scryer room. This leads to a rectangular room<br/>
with pillars. There is an exit across from the ramp. Take it and follow the<br/>
wall to your right.<br/>
The next &quot;room&quot; is the heart spider room. As the previous message said you<br/>
have to go underwater here to get to the monk.<br/>

&gt; I do, but its hard to explain......<br/>
&gt; there is a room called the spider room in upper. there is water below<br/>
&gt; this.....in the water, there is a passage that takes you to a<br/>
&gt; room with him<br/>
&gt; in there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; he is there with a pet, and another mob....i suggest taking a group<br/>
&gt; depending on your level.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This item looks aawesome but I have never seen a skeletal monk in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Upper guk before. Does anyone know where you find him?<br/>
