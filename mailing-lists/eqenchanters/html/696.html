<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634674915">i have the answer to your question, see, you were in highhold, but not in<br/>
the castle, you need to find the castle. you will know you found it, cause<br/>
its another zone. once inside, go through the little courtyard, into the<br/>
castle, then go straight, and go around a wall, on the otherside of the<br/>
wall, take a right, into a little room with a door in it, open the door, and<br/>
the guy is in there. Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; it&#39;s ust hard to get into highkeep. once there its cake. just walk around<br/>
&gt; and go to every room. there is one room with a door and a gaurd next to<br/>
it,<br/>

&gt; &gt;I found the guy once, to buy the 8th level animation spell. It&#39;s very<br/>
&gt; &gt;dangerous there, but not impossible. Invisibility is the key, as you<br/>
&gt; &gt;probably know since you were in the keep. The merchant is an Erudite,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and he&#39;s up on the second floor of the keep. I can&#39;t give specific<br/>
&gt; &gt;directions, as I was just running around until I found him, then gated<br/>
&gt; &gt;out immediately after I memorized the spell. I don&#39;t remember his name,<br/>
&gt; &gt;either, but he was the only Erudite I recall seeing there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Good luck.<br/>
