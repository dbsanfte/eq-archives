<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-660799494">For an &#39;experienced&#39; Enchanter stating that charisma is a waste to fledgling Enchanters floors me. To state it bluntly, you are a moron. Before you make an across the board statement like that lets take some things into consideration. First you charisma was at 187 which is the HIGH end. Trying to boost your charisma OVER 200 IS a waste since it pretty much caps at 200. Second, you are a 52nd lvl Chanter (must&#39;ve had VERY good groups).<br/>
the higher you are the more difficult it is for lower level mobs to resist a charm.<br/>
<br/>
In short guys and gals Charisma is a VERY important stat to an Enchanter and your Optimum working Cha for Charm/Mez/crowd control should be 150-200 based on your lvl. The higher the mobs you fight(white/yellow/red) the higher your cha should be.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for being harsh but that was just plain stupid ---&gt;&quot;charisma is totally or at least in part a waste.&quot;<br/>
