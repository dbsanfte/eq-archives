<div id="ygrps-yiv-4963302">For me, the debate about whether to wear charisma items or intelligence<br/>
items completely depends on what I will be doing.  If I&#39;m going to be<br/>
charming anything, charisma is 200 no question, but if I dont have charm<br/>
memorized and have a good group, I&#39;m more likely to boost my intelligence<br/>
but not let my charisma get too low (keep it 170+).<br/>
<br/>
Be sure that you carry a set of gold cats eye bracelets with you, which I<br/>
swap with the polished bone bracelets.  Get a pair of the +5 charisma<br/>
earrings from unrest (cheap) and some golden ear studs (+3 int, which you<br/>
can upgrade to batskull earrings when possible) for swapping.  For rings, I<br/>
swap between gold sapphire and platinum rose quartz.  In my hands I choose<br/>
between the stein of mogguk, a crude stein, a rod of insidious glamor, and a<br/>
sacrificial dagger (all fairly obtainable at level 30 I believe).  With<br/>
these items alone, you have a big boost to either intelligence or charisma.<br/>
