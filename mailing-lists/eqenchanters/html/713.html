<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169558696">I am sorry to say, chances are your invso failed, and the orc jumped you<br/>
right off. I&#39;ve had invso drop without notice before, as a matter a fact,<br/>
only twice since EQ went production (march 17) I&#39;ve had invso last for the<br/>
full durration.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m sorry if this message sounds bad, but i love the game, just a little<br/>
 </span></blockquote>upset right now.  I finally made 8th level, and so off I go to get my pet<br/>
spell.  I had read many reports on this list, so I thought myself prepared.<br/>
 After about an hour and a half trip from Felwithe, I finally reach High<br/>
Hold Pass.  My invisibility still going strong, I procede in a short<br/>
distance only to be rooted and killed by some #@!!@#$ orc who could see<br/>
invisible.  I came from Kithicor forest.  Was I just unlucky?  Is there<br/>
another better way in, other than through kithicor?  That place is insane.<br/>
How do they expect us to ever get a pet at this level?  I&#39;ve been hearing<br/>
Mages whine about have to research 24th level pets.  How about getting<br/>
screwed out of 8th level.  If my bitching is unfounded, please tell me.  I<br/>
will appologize.  If there is an easier way, or I just got unlucky, let me<br/>
know.  Please.<br/>
