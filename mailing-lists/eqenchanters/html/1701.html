<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018560430">The MUDs I worked on and played had two weapon enhancement skills that<br/>
would be interesting to see implemented.  One was Inset.  This was a<br/>
cross bewteen jewelcraft and black smithing as it allowed you to inset<br/>
a stone in to a weapon to imbue the weapon with the magical properties<br/>
of the stone.  The other was simply Enchant Weapon, which was a level<br/>
dependent damage enhancer.  As I recall the goal was to win a quest so<br/>
an immortal would enchant your (non-magical only) weapon and then you<br/>
could inset the Purple Shard from the Purple Snorklewacker.  Now that<br/>
was fun!<br/>
<br/>
By the way Lottie, is there any chance you do configuration management<br/>
for a large tech company in the Southwest?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The perfect enchanting item spell can be taken from<br/>
&gt; a MUD I used to play<br/>
&gt; on.  It is ALWAYS useful, has a limited duration,<br/>
&gt; and is a constant<br/>
&gt; supply of income.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Featherweight:<br/>
&gt; High mana cost(150 or so)<br/>
&gt; 20th level or so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reduces the weight of an item it is cast upon by<br/>
&gt; 1/2.  Lasts until the<br/>
&gt; player with the item logs off.  Item has to be in<br/>
&gt; the enchanter&#39;s hand<br/>
&gt; to have the spell cast upon it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People would pay out the wazoo for this, and once<br/>
&gt; you had a loyal<br/>
&gt; customer, they wouldn&#39;t go anywhere else.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Can you featherweight my rubicite, total stranger?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been wanting this one for a while.<br/>
