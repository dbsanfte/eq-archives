I was young and stupid, and<br/>
as soon as a language became available at the trainer, I would put a point<br/>
into it.  Not knowing what I know now that that first point roughly equals<br/>
your level in skill points.<br/>
<br/>
To make a very long and rambling first post short (he he, sorry), I am<br/>
looking for Gnoll, Goblin, Kobold, Fairie, Lizardman, Froglock, and Orc to<br/>
be trained to excellent on the Karana server.  If there is any kind hearted<br/>
enchanter there that would sell me these languages, and/or take the time to<br/>
train me in them, I would be most grateful.  If anyone can help, please send<br/>
me an email or an ingame tell.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just curious as I have little experience with languages....<br/>
can you increase your language ability by grouping with someone and then<br/>
using group talk to increase skill?  The other member of the group won&#39;t get<br/>
anything out of it, I know, but will you?<br/>
