<div id="ygrps-yiv-936401848">I submitted this editorial to EQ Enchanters a short while ago.  It was<br/>
posted but isn&#39;t linked right now for some reason.  Check out his site if<br/>
you haven&#39;t already as it is very useful and he puts alot of time/effort<br/>
into it I think.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/">http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/</a><br/>

So, you think you want to sell cheap jewelry?<br/>
Azara, level 8 high elf enchanter<br/>

I&#39;ve noticed a disturbing trend where jewelry prices are falling as more<br/>
enchanters delve into jewelcraft now that it has been revamped.  Using my<br/>
trusty jewelcraft chart (thank you EQ Enchanters) it is easy for me to<br/>
calculate what an items base cost is and charge accordingly.  The problem is<br/>
many people are selling the same items for just a tad more than base cost.<br/>
Here is an example:<br/>
<br/>
+2 Strength rings = 3125c<br/>
amber = 2p6g2s5c or 2625c<br/>
silver bar = 5g or 500c + time to enchant (about half my mana per bar)<br/>
<br/>
I sell these for 6p or 2 for 10p.  I know some people sell them for 5p which<br/>
is OK just not my choice of price.  The people that bother me are those that<br/>
sell for 4p or less.  Even at 4p there is a profit of only 9g per ring.<br/>
This brings me to my next problem (which is related): why do we fail SO MANY<br/>
times on items that are trivial to us?  It makes no sense to fail a<br/>
significant amount of time on a jewel/metal combination that is trivial.  If<br/>
there is no skill gain possible why not lower the chance of failure (about 5<br/>
fold)?  I wear two +2 wisdom rings when working to raise my wisdom and<br/>
hopefully lower my chance of failure.  At any rate with a jewelcraft skill<br/>
of around 40 I failed 4 times in a row with amber (a worst case I think), a<br/>
loss of about 12.5p.<br/>
<br/>
3125c per attempt * 4 failures = 12500c<br/>
9g profit per ring = 13 - 14 extra rings to make up losses (assuming no more<br/>
losses)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone so let&#39;s look at the 4p stength ring again.  Assuming<br/>
I make 9g per ring and then have 4 failures costing me 12.5p total, how many<br/>
sold rings does this equal?  About 14 rings!  And this is just to break even<br/>
assuming you have only those 4 failures (plus no more failures on the 14 to<br/>
make up for the previous failures).  Additionally, forgetting the 4 failures<br/>
for a second, by selling so cheaply you are setting yourself up for more<br/>
failures because you will need to make and sell more rings to build up a<br/>
decent amount of money.  But, the failure ratio is the same whether you sell<br/>
high and create a few rings or sell low and create a lot of rings.  Let&#39;s<br/>
assume a 30% failure rate (sad but true sometimes) for worst case and let&#39;s<br/>
say I want to amass 10p profits.<br/>
<br/>
# RINGS REQUIRED to AMASS 10p<br/>
failure rate = 30%<br/>
selling at 4p get 9g profit ea:<br/>
11 rings w/o failures - my target is to make 11 rings then<br/>
11 * 30% fail rate = 3 failures<br/>
3 remakes * 30% fail rate = 1 additional failure or remake (which hopefully<br/>
won&#39;t fail again!)<br/>
So, to make 10p profit you need to sell 11 rings w/o failures but we WILL<br/>
have failures.<br/>
But, we see statistically that we may fail 4 times for an additional cost of<br/>
12.5p.<br/>
Selling our 11 rings for 4p ea we get 44p.<br/>
Subtract the cost to make: 11 * 3.1p = 34.1p<br/>
Subtract the cost of failures: 4 * 3.1p = 12.4p<br/>
Total cost to make: 46.5p!!!!!<br/>
Resulting &quot;Profit&quot;: 2.5p LOSS<br/>
<br/>
Do you see???  You LOST money after making all those rings.  You went and<br/>
collected the jewels, enchanted the metal, and got yourself to level 8 so<br/>
that you can enchant and then you gave the jewelry away.....<br/>
<br/>
Now let&#39;s look at selling 6p per ring.<br/>
# RINGS REQUIRED to AMASS 10p<br/>
failure rate = 30%<br/>
selling at 6p get 2.9p profit ea:<br/>
4 rings w/o failures<br/>
4 * 30% fail rate = 1 failures or 1 remake (which hopefully won&#39;t fail<br/>
again!)<br/>
So, to make 10p profit you need to sell 4 rings w/o failures.<br/>
But, we see statistically that we may fail 1 time for a cost of 3.1p.<br/>
Selling our 4 rings for 6p ea we get 24p.<br/>
Subtract the cost to make: 4 * 3.1p = 12.4p<br/>
Subtract the cost of failures: 1 * 3.1p = 3.1p<br/>
Total cost to make: 15.6p<br/>
Resulting profit: about 10p<br/>
<br/>
So, to summarize:<br/>
Don&#39;t undersell your competitors if they are already selling for a<br/>
reasonable price.<br/>
There is no bonus for ramping up production.  Your fail rate is constant.<br/>
Therefore the more you make the more you will fail.<br/>
You will fail some of the time.  You need to make enough profit to pay for<br/>
the failures.<br/>
People want better jewelry which comes from higher priced gems.  You will<br/>
need LOTS more money to try them.<br/>
If you sell for too low a price you hurt not only yourself but the other<br/>
jewelcrafters as well.<br/>
You aren&#39;t doing ANYONE any favors selling low.  Don&#39;t subscribe to the &quot;you<br/>
just want to make money&quot; mentality.  A suitable response is &quot;you just want<br/>
to get more magic stuff&quot;.  Of course we want more money and they want<br/>
stuff....  that&#39;s why we have a trade skill to sell.  If you give it away<br/>
you won&#39;t get the prices back up.<br/>
<br/>
Case in point - let&#39;s look at giant snake fangs.  In the beginning they were<br/>
sold for the ridiculous price of 5p ea.  God I wish I could have been<br/>
selling them at that time.  This price came about I believe because you<br/>
could buy them for something like 6p from an NPC merchant.  Are they worth 5<br/>
or 6p?  I don&#39;t think so really.  A more reasonable price is 1p - they are<br/>
GOOD weapons for new people.  However, people started selling them to<br/>
players for 5gp ea (I have no idea why).  This is stupid as a person with<br/>
good charisma can sell them to NPCs for 4g8s.  Why in the world am I going<br/>
to waste my time wandering the zones to sell snake fangs for a 2s profit<br/>
each?  So I sell them to NPCs and get on with my life.  The point?  You who<br/>
want snake fangs could readily buy them from me if you make it somewhat<br/>
worth my while.  But if you expect me to kill Asps at great risk so you can<br/>
have a cool weapon for 2s profit to me after I just took 5 minutes or so to<br/>
try to sell it you are mistaken.  I tried and tried to sell fangs for 8g -<br/>
1p but everyone said &quot;everyone knows the price is 5g&quot;.  Not from me it&#39;s not<br/>
and if enough people would work together we could find a fair medium.  But<br/>
instead we have people who want to make a quick buck not looking to the<br/>
future.  If you are selling jewelry for a few gold more than it took to<br/>
make, with the current screwed up failure model (failing on trivial items)<br/>
you will either lose money or break even (most likely) and will not make<br/>
enough money to research the high end jewelcraft items.  In other words you<br/>
will work yourself out of the market because we will be able to sell only so<br/>
many low end items.  Yes, new characters/people will need low end/cheap<br/>
jewlery but the vast majority of the server will be ready for gold and<br/>
platinum enchanted rubies and diamonds but you will have enough money to be<br/>
dabbling in malachite electrum saying &quot;jewelcraft sucks, you can&#39;t make any<br/>
money. why doesn&#39;t anyone want my stuff...&quot;<br/>
