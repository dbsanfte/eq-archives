<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277427217">you guys notice one thing weird about us? seem everyone has some sort of<br/>
&quot;class&quot; only items except the enchanter? or perhaps i have not run into one<br/>
yet? I consider myself to know much about the magical items in this game<br/>
seeing as how i have a good majority of them heh. but no enchanter only<br/>
items? anyone run across one?</div>
