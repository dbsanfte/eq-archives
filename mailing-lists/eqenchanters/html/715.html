<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387040262">when i went, i went with a group and i was lvl 12. it was a much easier<br/>
trip. my onyl advice would be to put all your belongings in the bank, go<br/>
invis, cast invis in every zone. when you get to highkeep, get yer money<br/>
out of the bank, buy the spell, and gate back or whatever. i made my trip<br/>
from qeynos to highkeep, and we were on our way to freeport, so we bound at<br/>
highkeep, then at rivervale, and then at freeport.<br/>

&gt;I made the trip and had no problems, just lucky I guess.<br/>
&gt;I also gated back the moment I bought it, call me chicken but the thought of<br/>
&gt;walking back to get my corpse was to much.<br/>

&gt;Try,try again..<br/>
