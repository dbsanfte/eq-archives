Subject: [eqenchanters] Iksar and Smithing Questions...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I recently made an Iksar warrior and had a few questions for those of you<br/>
out there that have Iksar alternates/primary toons or are good friends with<br/>
someone that plays an Iksar.<br/>
<br/>
Can an Iksar become non-kos to good or evil races on Antonica or Faydwer?<br/>
<br/>
Since the newest upgrade to smithing, how much plat would it take to get a<br/>
175 or 200 in smithing? Estimate?<br/>
<br/>
Since Blood Water is the only water in Cabilis, does this work in a forge,<br/>
or does it have to be a Flask of Water?<br/>
<br/>
Can you Dye Cabilis Scale or only FS Plate?<br/>
<br/>
I realize these are OT and mostly smithing questions, but I am hoping<br/>
someone out there has some experience with this. All feedback is<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
