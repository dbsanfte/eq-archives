<div id="ygrps-yiv-447242758">Hallo all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on the list forever but haven&#39;t played in forever too... Just went <br/>
out and bought a copy of the original game-my computer isn&#39;t smart enough <br/>
166/32mb/4mb vid card-and I&#39;m wondering about the optional files offered <br/>
when you first start up a copy of the game and click the &#39;play online&#39; <br/>
button.(Not talking about the register Kunark button) I&#39;m wondering if these <br/>
files are too much for my computer too handle, system spec wise, and what <br/>
they happen to contain.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I&#39;m still going to play an Enchanter, again, even knowing how <br/>
annoying the class can be. I can&#39;t help it, Enchanters are without a doubt <br/>
the iconoclastic class in the game, the enigma to many, and seeing the mana <br/>
speed up spells I&#39;m sure one of the most bothered classes-a&#39;la SoW-in the <br/>
game, which is fine with me most times because I love chatting.<br/>
<br/>
And Since I haven&#39;t played in about a year, I&#39;ll try to start up a debate! <br/>
What are the best and worst changes to the Enchanters as of late? What makes <br/>
you spittin mad and what makes you want to never give up the class??<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
