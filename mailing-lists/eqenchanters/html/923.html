<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209915142">Remember, we are trying to have a sharing of ideas here. If the best you can<br/>
do is flame, you probably had nothing worthwhile to say to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing online games since &#39;89, and I believe a part of our lag is<br/>
due to having entire databases stored locally. We can debate data structures<br/>
and use of algorithms to our hearts content, but I still believe it is a<br/>
cause. It is possible to design a system that allows you to store data on a<br/>
server (to help avoid hacks) and still allow you to play any one of your<br/>
characters on any server. Think about it. There would be allot of benefits.<br/>
I still maintain having a character permanently tied to a specific server is<br/>
a serious design flaw in EQ. A flaw easily avoidable by anyone who wants to<br/>
compete with EQ. I still hope Verant allows us to transfer characters<br/>
between servers in the future, even if it involves a fee. Otherwise, we have<br/>
no intention of renewing our EQ subscriptions once something else becomes<br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
Now if someone wants to flame me further, I suggest:<br/>
<br/>
1) Use English. Maybe discover the wonders of paragraph structure and make<br/>
an attempt at grammar.<br/>
<br/>
2) Try to present a clear, concise logical rebuttal.<br/>
<br/>
3) Have the guts to sign your flame.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows, if these suggestions had been followed, the post might have been<br/>
worth reading.<br/>

Switching characters between servers is the stupidest idea anyone ever<br/>
thought of... how are you ever going to be able to contact friends you made<br/>
on one server? Of course YOU live near all your friends and can call them up<br/>
saying let&#39;s all go to this server but everyone doesn&#39;t have that option...<br/>
DO THEY? Think about it from a programming point of view, the transfering of<br/>
characters would leave many many loopholes and whereas a program similar to<br/>
uoextreme could jump in and give you 1000000 platium... hmm... You didn&#39;t<br/>
think things through did you? Okay, you still don&#39;t agree so here goes some<br/>
more... A new server comes up and everyone playing it is a newbie then all<br/>
the sudden verant let&#39;s us do this stupid server switching crap and<br/>
blacksmiths go over there selling everything at 5 times the cost they could<br/>
get on an established server. This would also let high level parties go to a<br/>
new server and camp all the huge monsters... Emporer Crush for example?<br/>
Let&#39;s look a bit deeper... How would a guild be able to keep in contact?<br/>
Talking between servers would cause ungodly 24 hour 7 days a week 365 days a<br/>
year LAG!!!!! Not to mention the constant character switching would cause<br/>
more lag therefore screwing up your playing anyways... So basically pick<br/>
your server and STICK TO IT!!!! Why are people always wanting to move? When<br/>
I first started playing I picked the server with the least amouth of people<br/>
on it... Bertoxx, and it still remains towards the bottom of the server list<br/>
and even if it had 2000 people playing all the time I would not switch<br/>
because all my friends on that server... so thank you and sorry if it<br/>
sounded like a flame because it was suppose to sound worse than that.<br/>
