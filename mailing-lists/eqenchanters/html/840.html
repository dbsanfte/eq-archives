only get offered a few plat i think.<br/>
They are corpse retrieval tools but last night on Ec&#39;i I got a message from<br/>
someone who had bouhgt one and couldn&#39;t figure out how to make it work. He<br/>
had tried right and left clicking, and having it in his hand slot. When I<br/>
zoned he was about to try with the person in his group and targetted. So<br/>
unless you have palt to spare I would hold off.<br/>
