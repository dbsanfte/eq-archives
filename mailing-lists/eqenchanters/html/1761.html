<b>Subject:</b> failures with trivial attempts <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-195851033">I&#39;ve mentioned this in my editorial and I posted as a bug the high failure<br/>
rates when working with combinations that are trivial.  I have a respectable<br/>
wisdom of 90 something and a skill level of 40 something (been playing other<br/>
characters so haven&#39;t leveled beyond 8 for a long... time) but I fail SO<br/>
OFTEN with onyx and lower.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a relationship with difficulty of attempt (even when trivial) and<br/>
the rate of failure?  In other words, will I continue to fail the same rate<br/>
on average with a particular trivial combination even after raising my skill<br/>
level by working on harder combinations first?  I think there&#39;s no<br/>
improvement to the failure rate on combinations that are pretty easy like<br/>
silver/onyx even as I improved my skill in the recent past.  With that in<br/>
mind, I don&#39;t know if I should work with unenchanted electrum and malachite<br/>
to improve my skill level if the rate of trivial failures remains constant.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info or advice you might have.  If this is something you<br/>
could ask someone or even better if there&#39;s a petition or list of<br/>
suggestions I would request one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
Subject: Rate of failure on trivial metal/gem combinations too high<br/>
What:  With a respectable wisdom of 90ish there are far too many failures<br/>
with trivial metal/gem combinations.  Failure rates are running 30% to 50%<br/>
working with trivial items.<br/>
<br/>
Proposal:  Drastically lower the rate of failure for trivial items<br/>
(something less than 10%) or eliminate failures for trivial items<br/>
completely.    OR    Leave fail rates where they are but if you fail making<br/>
a trivial combination you either get a non-magical item or you don&#39;t lose<br/>
anything and have to reenchant the metal or you just don&#39;t lose anything.<br/>
Again, these are only for when an item is trivial.<br/>
<br/>
Why:  It makes sense to expect a skill gain with the known chance of<br/>
failure.  It makes no sense to fail often when there is zero chance of skill<br/>
gain because the item is trivial.  If it IS trivial to make, why would a<br/>
craftsman fail so often?  Trivial = easy = no learning = no skill gain = low<br/>
failures<br/>
<br/>
What would happen:  Not really changing much except making the game more<br/>
fun.  There will still be the current rate of failure for non-trivial skill<br/>
gaining - so we won&#39;t be getting something for nothing.  This will make<br/>
business more fun and less frustrating.  If there are certain items that for<br/>
some reason should never be trivial then you could still fail at them and<br/>
still gain experience.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
