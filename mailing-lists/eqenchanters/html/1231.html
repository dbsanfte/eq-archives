<div id="ygrps-yiv-379225936">the best place you can go for soloing at this level is Lavastorm. It will<br/>
bring you at level 18 in no time. After 18, it&#39;s still good but not as good.<br/>
To get there, Take the boat to Freeport, go in East Commons, enter Nektulos<br/>
forest ( follow the right wall to get there )and turn into a dark elf then<br/>
follow the path straight all the way to lavastorm. as you enter lavastorm,<br/>
follow the right edge and you&#39;ll soon find the entrance of the Najena<br/>
dungeon. This is a great place to hunt. Xp is amazing on the lavas crawlers.<br/>
Loot is also pretty good ( although not extraordinary ). Hunt in Lavastorm<br/>
and zone in najena if there is any trouble.<br/>
Also, this place is full of darkies, ogres and trolls so if you like duels,<br/>
you&#39;ll have a good time.<br/>
Note: A magic weapon can help...try to buy or get a runed totem staff first.<br/>

<br/>
Hail Friends,<br/>
<br/>
I finally reached lvl 15! but I am at a loss now. I have traveled far, from<br/>
Erudin to Felwithe and currently hunt at the Sister camp in Lesser Faydark.<br/>
<br/>
For those that do not know, this is (well was until last patch) a great<br/>
place for loot and exp. I started hunting there at 12th and made my way to<br/>
15th quickly and after buying all my spells I still have 150pp in the bank.<br/>
<br/>
Well now this place is too easy for me and need a better place to reach 16th<br/>
preferably with good loot. I would like to solo to 16th but in safety. I<br/>
hear you say, don&#39;t we all!<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas where I could find such a place/camp?<br/>
