<b>Subject:</b> Is Jewelry worthless or what? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118693516">I found this web site that displays all the jewelry we can make up to<br/>
gold+ruby...Well it really looked worthless to me at first glance. After<br/>
thinking a bit, I thought: well, if that&#39;s all we can get in the game, then<br/>
players will buy it. Then I started a little research around and I found out<br/>
that you can find much more powerful magic items that we can ever make on<br/>
monsters...so what&#39;s the point? Who&#39;s gonna pay 150 plats to buy a +3 INT<br/>
ring if he can get +6 INT Helmet by camping at a certain place.<br/>
