<div id="ygrps-yiv-684625230">*Thats a quest item, not research.<br/>
*For my part, I have found an &#39;Illegible cantrip&#39; on an orc<br/>
*apprentice. Not sure what class&#39; research item that is,<br/>
*but I&#39;m pretty sure it isn&#39;t ours...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I turned that in to Jyleel before and it&#39;s not what he wants... he<br/>
wants the orc oracle scrolls, not the illegible cantrips.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I believe the illegible cantrips found on orc apprentices are indeed<br/>
research items, but, like you said, not for us, as Enchanters.</div>
