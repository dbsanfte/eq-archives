Along the lines of good fights for the low-20&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
My enchanter is 54th level (not higher mostly due to my casual game-play), and<br/>
spends a lot of time in the depths of the various Kunark dungeons or doing<br/>
planes raids.  All quite a bit of fun, but sometimes one needs a break.<br/>
<br/>
Well, recently, I&#39;ve been playing a Monk twink, and trying some of the places<br/>
that I never tried as an enchanter.  I have to say, I HIGHLY recommend Upper Guk<br/>
for someone of your level.  Our party of a warrior, a monk, and a cleric, were<br/>
able to clean up quite nicely there, and the loot drops are very good as well.<br/>
With an enchanter, we would have been completely unstoppable.  If your normal<br/>
party is a paladin, a druid, and an enchanter, you should be able to have a nice<br/>
little thing going, and with the experience bonus for Upper Guk implemented,<br/>
you&#39;ll see rapid advancement as well.<br/>
<br/>
Solusek A is also a very good place, but you might want a couple levels before<br/>
you start adventuring there.<br/>
<br/>
And given that the paladins are good tanks at lower levels, you&#39;d likely have<br/>
little problem with your group of three in either place.  The only obstacle I<br/>
really see is a lack of GOOD healing in emergency situations.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I always find dungeons to be more of a challenge as an enchanter.<br/>
Adventuring outdoors is usually pretty easy, and it&#39;s not terribly difficult to<br/>
separate creatures out, and make the true talents of the enchanter a moot<br/>
point.  Give some good dungeon delving a try, as it will REALLY hone your<br/>
skills, and show you exactly what an enchanter is capable of.  Single pulls are<br/>
all nice and good, but don&#39;t really give us a chance to shine.  *smile*<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just some thoughts.<br/>
