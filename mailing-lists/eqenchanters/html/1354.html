<div id="ygrps-yiv-984494636"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is there any truth to that rumor about making a skull staff?  I have<br/>
&gt;never seen one on E&#39;ci.  What&#39;s the story here folks?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i keep hearing there is a quest for it, and the guy (who i have seen) that<br/>
you go to after you get the quest is in S. Ro with an orc pet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;As far as armor, there is better than woven, if you have the money or<br/>
&gt;ability to get it yourself.  Gossimer and Damask are better than woven<br/>
&gt;in the cloth department. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>damask isnt better than woven from what i see. it weighs more and has the<br/>
same AC, unless it absorbs damage better?<br/>
<br/>
There are also mage-usable leather varieties<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;such as bear-hide and lupine.  I don&#39;t know where to get it, but bone<br/>
&gt;armor is available from some mobs out in the Karanas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the bone armor is on the ogres at their camp in west karana. they are tough<br/>
tho, all of them are amiable to you except their chief, who will KOS. they<br/>
blue to red to me at lvl 21. the bear and lupine hide stuff you can get in<br/>
qeynos hills from some poachers that the druids hate. chandra miller and<br/>
baobob miller. give them what they ask for (bear hides, wolf hides) and<br/>
some gold, and they&#39;ll give you the armor.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;For a one handed weapon, the new hot item is Dvinn&#39;s dagger, the<br/>
&gt;Dragoon Dirk.  If you aren&#39;t capable of doing Dvinn yourself get a big<br/>
&gt;group that will dommit to staying through enough spawns to get one for<br/>
&gt;everyone.  He is in the neighborhood of level 20 but hits much harder<br/>
&gt;than the average bear.  Go to Crushbone and see what you can do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he&#39;s just like Dorn in N. Ro. get a group of 4 or 5 lvl 17-20 people, with<br/>
a good cleric, and he&#39;s toast. =)<br/>
