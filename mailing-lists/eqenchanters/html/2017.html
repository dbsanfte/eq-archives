<div id="ygrps-yiv-130624011">You don&#39;t buy a bloodstone from him. You need to buy a bloodstone from a<br/>
gem vendor, and give it to him. By the way, what you want off the<br/>
shadowed men is Glowing Gloves. They also drop Shadowed Gloves, but you<br/>
do not want to give those to the quest npc, he&#39;d just take them and say<br/>
thanks.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hail there fellow enchanters (especially you gnomish ones)! Recently I<br/>
&gt; have been attempting to complete the quest in the temple for the<br/>
&gt; enchanter gloves, and I thought i&#39;d see if anyone here has completed<br/>
&gt; it.  I&#39;ve picked up the radiant gloves from cazic thule, which was a<br/>
&gt; lot easier than I expected (people often shout that radiant is dead in<br/>
&gt; the hall and he&#39;s got the gloves).  I know that if I camp the<br/>
&gt; shadowmen in west commons long enough I&#39;ll get the shadow gloves... as<br/>
&gt; long as they dont kill me too many times.  I&#39;m only 29 after all...<br/>
&gt; The other two pairs I hear I can buy from gypsies in lavastorm, so<br/>
&gt; thats not a big issue (I hope). Now, the problem.  When given the<br/>
&gt; quest, a bloodstone from tarn vislin is mentioned.  Now you probably<br/>
&gt; know tarn... he&#39;s the guy in high keep that sells the enchanter pets.<br/>
&gt; Well, he doesnt sell bloodstones.  When hailed he says &quot;Hi there!  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; tarn vislin, nice to meet you&#39; or something useless like that.  NOW,<br/>
&gt; do I need to get this bloodstone, or is it just added to the quest to<br/>
&gt; throw us<br/>
&gt; off?<br/>
&gt; Thanks in<br/>
&gt; advance!<br/>
