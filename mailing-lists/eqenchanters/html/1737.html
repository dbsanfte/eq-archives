<div id="ygrps-yiv-174978148">Hello.  I am new to the enchanter class and have just started Jewel Craft.<br/>
I was wondering if anyone knew of any sites out there on the WWW that are<br/>
dedicated to the Enchanter class ( sort of like the Necromancer&#39;s Hideout<br/>
for the Necros.)  I&#39;ve heard of a pricing list made out there somewhere that<br/>
tells what we as Jewelers should be able to get for our enchanted jewelry.<br/>
Any info on this would be extremely helpful.<br/>
