<b>Subject:</b> Question about Augmentation and Rune series.  Also Feedback. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461074669">Is it just me or do these not stack.  I was trying to cast Rune II last<br/>
night with Augmentation on and noticed I was not getting a Icon for Rune II.<br/>
I hope that maybe I was bugged lastnight because it doesn&#39;t seem right that<br/>
they dont stack.  One is a damage shield and the other is a Agi buff.  Any<br/>
one knowing anything about this please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Has Feedback been fixed yet I know there was a problem if the MOB died by<br/>
Feedback the corpse disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
SilverLock I was wondering is that the name of your character on EC&#39;I?  I<br/>
dont ever remember seeing you around there I keep track of most of the<br/>
higher level enchanters and know most of them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time all.<br/>
<br/>
