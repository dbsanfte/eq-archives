<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643495099">It&#39;s not just that most of our spells are alterations that you want to make<br/>
this your primary specialization. The spells you will be tossing in combat<br/>
will be mainly alterations. That is why alteration should be the primary<br/>
specialization. My method for specialization has been to put one point into<br/>
alteration specialization, wait till it hits 49 or 50 (took most of the way<br/>
to 21 or even just past), then go back to the nearest guild and put one<br/>
point in all the others and one more in alteration. I don&#39;t have an hour or<br/>
two to sit around and do nothing in the game, so this worked good for me. I<br/>
also noticed that the lower level alteration spells almost never raised the<br/>
skill whereas with the higher level spells it seemed to go up more often.<br/>

&gt; What they said.<br/>
&gt; Definitely put a point into each Specialize skill (one for each spell<br/>
&gt; skill) and then make sure you stop casting any spells other then the one<br/>
&gt; you want to eventually Master at about skill 40.  The reason is that you<br/>
&gt; want them all and that you cant get one above 50 until you have at least<br/>
&gt; put a point into each of them.<br/>
&gt; I also recommend Alteration. At the present time Baelsih at Castersrealm<br/>
&gt; is the only one who has a good page for viewing spells by skill type.  So<br/>
&gt; look at your spell list or hit his site and then view by the different<br/>
&gt; categories to see what spells you like and the skill they fit in.<br/>
&gt; You will find that most of our spells are Alteration.<br/>
&gt; Since Specialization will reduce mana cost if it works it should be for<br/>
&gt; spells you will cast often and when your mana may run out.  For example<br/>
&gt; combat spells or enchantments.<br/>
