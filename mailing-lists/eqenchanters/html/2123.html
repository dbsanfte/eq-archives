<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904686970">Another way to go is to forget about training in Jewelcraft a little while<br/>
since you won&#39;t have the cash at 8-12 anyway.  I was disturbed by how often<br/>
I was fizzling on Chaotic because I too solo and needed a spell I could<br/>
count on.  When your pet is about dead and you know you won&#39;t be able to<br/>
solo or park the monster with a reasonable degree of certainty it&#39;s nice to<br/>
nuke it to death.  Pour some points into Evocation.  Worry about jewelcraft<br/>
later.  If you&#39;ve read some of the messages in the other thread about<br/>
jewelcraft you&#39;ll see the amount of money we&#39;re talking to become a master -<br/>
10,000s of plat probably.  It&#39;s not worth trying to sell silver jewelry (at<br/>
least I wouldn&#39;t choose this over putting points into evocation).  You&#39;ll<br/>
sell a few here and there but most people will turn their nose&#39;s up at<br/>
silver jewelry.  Can&#39;t enchant electrum till 16 and won&#39;t have much money to<br/>
mess around with jewelcraft till then anyway.  I would recommend putting<br/>
points into melee stuff in the very beginning to help stay alive and then<br/>
don&#39;t be afraid to put some points into evocation at or before 8.  I hardly<br/>
ever fail on Chaotic Feedback at 13 now!<br/>

Evo is not really a nessecity, even at level 8.<br/>
&lt;Snip&gt;<br/>
Since the 8th level spell Chaotic Feedback is the upgrade for our 1st level<br/>
DD spell, and the 12th Level spell Choke is the upgrade to our 4th level DoT<br/>
spell do you mind telling me how you advanced in level without using them<br/>
that much?  Is it because you group all the time? I solo alot do to lag<br/>
issues, which makes me unreliable in groups. This makes things tough, but I<br/>
find it necessary to be able to rely on my current Rank of spells. This<br/>
means keeping all the Spell Abilities maxxed as quickly as possible.<br/>
I already see that Enchanters alternate upgrades to DD and Dot spells every<br/>
other Rank. That makes for an Interesting combination. I will play around<br/>
with that tonight.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
AND STOP NUKING YOURSELF.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Since I am only 4th level and I do not have this spell yet, I&#39;m not nuking<br/>
myself. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;another rant&gt;<br/>
I have known something was not right and I just figured it out why it was<br/>
bothering me. Our Level 1 DD spell (and every DoT spell) is an Alteration<br/>
spell. Every DD spell afer 1st level except the AE DD spell at 39th level is<br/>
Evocation. Why the change? By this I mean why did it go from an Alteration<br/>
spell at 1st to an Evocation spell up until level 39 where it becomes an<br/>
Alteration spell, and then back to an Evocation spell?<br/>
<br/>
Also, why do we skip an upgrade to the 12th level DoT at 20th level? This is<br/>
the only level that this happens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, get me going and I can&#39;t stop. Expect alot of twisted questions<br/>
 from me. Why? Because I like active lists. :-)<br/>

&quot;I hate not knowing why.  I can handle anything as long as I understand<br/>
why.&quot;</div>
