<div id="ygrps-yiv-245964424">Diff class guild have diff colors, so as far as enchanters go, <br/>
Qeynos has blue i think, <br/>
<br/>
but the best &quot;newbie&quot; robe is the gold Erudite robe which has +2 mana<br/>
instead of +1. The gnome may have similar stats, not sure... but I wore my<br/>
erudite yellow robe from level 11-29 when I finally went down to Befallen<br/>
and got my Gossimer robe.<br/>
<br/>
now if that frog would only spawn with his robe...<br/>
<br/>
heh<br/>
