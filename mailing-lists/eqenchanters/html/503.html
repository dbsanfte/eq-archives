<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557916288">Lavastorm Mountains. most critters give out stones when you kill them. This<br/>
is also a very good place to hunt in general from level 10 ( but not solo )<br/>
to level 16+.<br/>
the lava crawlers carry the best stones but they are level 15-16 and require<br/>
magic to hit. Lavastorm countains also 3 high level dungeons: najena, and<br/>
...cant remember the name of the others ( something like Nafulben and maybe<br/>
Solusek Ro ), but you dont want to go there anyway.<br/>
Make sure you have illusion Dark elf before you go there, because you will<br/>
have to cross Nektulos forest to reach lavastorm.<br/>
