 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s for sure!!  First time I noticed it was when my bard had built<br/>
up about 140 points with nothing at all to spend them on!!!  I used it<br/>
to increase swimming skill higher and then ran out of money!!  Still<br/>
got over 80 points I think after learning languages, basic trade<br/>
skills etc.  Sheesh!<br/>
<br/>
As for an enchanter type, well I now always use as many skill points<br/>
as I can on research to make sure it&#39;s maxxed on guildmaster training.<br/>
Still needs to make a lot of increases in the field, but I&#39;m so<br/>
depressed at how rare the pages are ... and so annoyed when the<br/>
paladin doing the ML loots a faded page and before I can say &quot;Yay, can<br/>
I have that please&quot; he goes and destroys it!  Grrrr.<br/>
