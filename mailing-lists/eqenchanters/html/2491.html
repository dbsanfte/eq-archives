<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640422603">Yup, It&#39;s not true.  The preacher spawned 3 times for us last night and we<br/>
were all over the room, including on the stage.<br/>
<br/>
There was also a Vox raid last night.  That was a lot of fun to listen to<br/>
as well.  I&#39;m getting exited for the times when I can go join. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also for the advice on Mesmerisation.  If I stay back towards the<br/>
stage, and the puller pulls to the front of the room I can mezz everything<br/>
without getting myself mezzed.  Though it was a bit annoying I can&#39;t<br/>
enthrall while they&#39;re all mezzed, but it did get us out of quite a few<br/>
sticky situations.  I was able to hold everything back while our casters<br/>
gated out and our tanks ran to the zone(gotta love having a bard with<br/>
invis song in the group, hehe), then zone myself (ugly pull. with all<br/>
casters oom and tanks lown on health.  bad picture.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!!!<br/>

.I don&#39;t think it is true. When we camped him a while<br/>
.back, once we cleared the room, we hang out on the<br/>
.stage and pulled to it from behind, from the entrance<br/>
.and sometimes the hallway. He spawned 4 out of first 5<br/>
.times, then not for the next 3, then again. So I<br/>
.suspect that it is random.<br/>

.&gt; Rumor has it though in the preacher room if you walk<br/>
.&gt; on the stage it will<br/>
.&gt; cause the Preacher not to spawn, Is this true?  He<br/>
.&gt; only spawned twice all<br/>
.&gt; day yesterday (and my group was very careful not to<br/>
.&gt; walk on the stage.<br/>
.&gt; heh).  Any truth in this? :)<br/>
