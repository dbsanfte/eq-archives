<br><font size="2" face="Courier New">My regular group (just 3 of us) is myself the enchantress, my husband <br>
druid, and our friend the paladin, all in the low 20&#39;s. &nbsp;Until <br>
recently, most fights found me doing tashani, choke, and maybe a <br>
slowdown on the incoming mob, getting in the mob&#39;s face so he&#39;d aggro <br>
on me and my pet would attack, then sitting on my butt waiting for <br>
choke to wear off and recasting if needed. &nbsp;On the rare occasions that <br>
we&#39;d get 2 mobs, I&#39;d mezz the extra. &nbsp;Our fights were efficient, but a <br>
tad boring. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Then one night my druid husband and I decided to try out the forest <br>
giants in Warsliks Woods. &nbsp;These guys hit hard, and we had no tank <br>
(Paladin off enjoying RL :) &nbsp;The strategy we came up with was such a <br>
nice change of pace. &nbsp;The druid pulled with snare (if resisted, he <br>
recast after my tashani), I tashani&#39;d, if that was enough to get the <br>
mob&#39;s attention, I let him aggro on me and engage pet, if not, I hit <br>
him with sanity warp. &nbsp;Once on my pet (or me) &nbsp;I&#39;d run off a bit <br>
(we both were SoW&#39;d) and the druid nuked and got the giant&#39;s <br>
attention. &nbsp;While he tried to catch the druid, I nuked and got him <br>
back after me. &nbsp;We&#39;d run back and forth, nuking, and generally <br>
confusing the poor guy, with my pet at it&#39;s back. &nbsp;Finally it would <br>
decide to run, but found snare interfering, and would just stand there <br>
while my pet and druid husband beat it down. &nbsp;After the battle, we&#39;d <br>
have 2 or 3 bubbles of mana left and full health, and this was after <br>
beating the low red ones. &nbsp;Yeah, we then had to sit and med a bit, but <br>
the battle was so much more fun playing dodge the giant. :)<br>
<br>
I had heard that druids and enchanters make good partners, now I know <br>
why.<br>
