When soloing always use an animation (later on you can use charm instead)...<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
How long does Charm work on each type of /Con? (e.g. green = 2 minutes/ Blue<br/>
= 1 minute/ even = 30 seconds/ white = 20 seconds/ yellow = 10 seconds/ Red<br/>
= Who the Hell do you think you are?!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Now just wait (med if you want to) and watch your animation&#39;s health... tank<br/>
for it when needed.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know that most casters suffer from MPS (Mage Panic Syndrome) and get<br/>
nervous when a MOB starts to play with him physically, disrupting spells and<br/>
other wise being mean.  The reason for this is that they have not meleed<br/>
very much. I have purposefully attacked an even fight without a pet for 2<br/>
reasons.<br/>
1) It increases your Melee skill<br/>
2) It increases you Attack and Defense skills.  Defense only increases if<br/>
you are physically hit. Getting hit now increases your ability not to later.<br/>
<br/>
I also make sure that when I get outmatched (me at 2 bubs of health with it<br/>
at half health) I have guards nearby to save my butt or I can make the zone.<br/>
<br/>
I am used to getting beat on in-game. I am mostly solo and I die ALOT. I am<br/>
used to it, so if I am going to die I may as well increase as much of my<br/>
skills as I can. Right?<br/>
