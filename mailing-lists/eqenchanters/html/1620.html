<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-771580719">While they didn&#39;t change WTYH I have started using it again. To my<br/>
suprise it is VERY efficient at my level (just hit 27).  I can keep a<br/>
blue mob stunned for the duration of the fight by chain casting WTYH. <br/>
Only useful if you are in a group, perhaps, but the result is quite<br/>
astounding.  Instead of burning 75 or 100 mana for DD of 95 to 149<br/>
damage, I can whirl twice so my tanks pound the snot out of it for more<br/>
damamge than I could have done with my attack spell.<br/>
<br/>
Mesmerization now mesmerizes the caster if you are in the AOE.  LAME! <br/>
Keep this one in your useless file for now.<br/>
