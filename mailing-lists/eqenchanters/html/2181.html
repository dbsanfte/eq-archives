<div id="ygrps-yiv-674437107">Something I noticed when I had a chance to play from my friend&#39;s house who<br/>
uses DSL.  When I went to purchase items from the vendor I was able to buy<br/>
them almost as fast as I could click the mouse.  Doing the same thing from<br/>
my normal connection, a 26.4 modem connection, there is half second lag<br/>
between when I buy something and when I see it appear in my inventory.<br/>
<br/>
We recently upgraded my wife&#39;s machine (she also plays EQ) from a K6200 with<br/>
24Mb RAM running a Monster3D to a Celeron 466 with 48Mb RAM running a<br/>
Monster3DII.  Differences there are zone load times cut in half and she<br/>
actually used to run slower than me when we ran together.  So, if she<br/>
/follow ed me she eventually would break follow cause she fell farther and<br/>
farther back.  Now she speeds right along.<br/>

The single biggest improvement to game speed I have seen personally was when<br/>
I upgraded my EIDE hard drive to an Ultra DMA hard drive. The difference in<br/>
zone load time was astounding.<br/>
