<div id="ygrps-yiv-619508408">Have to be very careful with pets in dungeons.  I died yesterday in<br/>
blackburrow when a huge train (20 or so gnolls including elites and<br/>
several guardsmen) bubbled up from the depths after a partymembers pet<br/>
(a necro&#39;s skel) wandered off and attacked something.  We eventually got<br/>
experience (seemed kind of funny getting exp out of the blue with us all<br/>
sitting/resting) which worried me but there were so many people in the<br/>
zone I thought the gnoll population was probably under control.  HaHaHa,<br/>
don&#39;t think so anymore.  They started trailing in and they just kept on<br/>
coming.  I made the decision to run too late.  I almost made it up but<br/>
an elite kept stunning me and then the gang would hit hit hit.  So,<br/>
don&#39;t let your pets wander off and attack as you may see more of the bad<br/>
guys at once than you intended.<br/>

&gt; the<br/>
&gt; pet is that nervous runnig around me, and is alwas really far from me,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; get into melee with everything that moves. Once i casted 4 pets<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; every 2 minutes i realized, oh the pet got lost somewhere i didnt even<br/>
&gt; hear<br/>
&gt; a taunting attacker... i run around there a lot, from one door to the<br/>
&gt; next,<br/>
&gt; and most times i dont even see, where my pet is, and where he gets<br/>
&gt; himself<br/>
&gt; slain this time. suggestions?<br/>

Burrow where I have spent a lot of time, my pet fequently gets left<br/>
behind. He does eventually make it out, but sometimes I have to go and<br/>
unstick him.<br/>
