<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643294273">Well the freeport Militia don&#39;t care about Religion, but any guard with Sir<br/>
in his name surely will as they are all paladins of Marr.  Unfortunately<br/>
there is a paladin in the bank.  I&#39;m not sure if the paladins will attack<br/>
based on religion the way the dark elf dragoons will, but be ready to run<br/>
for the zone if you try to test it out.<br/>

Greetings all!<br/>
<br/>
I am a relatively young Enchanter (level 5) and am seeking some knowledge.<br/>
How do the Illusion spells work?  I have both Illusion:Human and Illusion<br/>
Half-elf and have tested them out briefly.  I am a Dark Elf, so when I<br/>
changed to a human, I lost my Ultravision, making everything pitch black.<br/>
At least the Half-elves get infravision.  My questions are these:  If I<br/>
change to human, do I get the experience point bonus (or rather lose the XP<br/>
penalty for being a non-human)?  I&#39;ve heard that the Illusion spells do not<br/>
mask religious identity.  How safe would I be walking in Freeport with one<br/>
of the illusion spells active?  Would I still be KOS?  <br/>
<br/>
When that Race war server opens up, Enchanters are going to be the assassins<br/>
of Norrath.  Invisibility, charming someone and making them attack their own<br/>
guards, Illusion spells to walk among the enemy unnoticed...<br/>
