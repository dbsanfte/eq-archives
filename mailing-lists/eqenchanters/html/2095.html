<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105914847">Hi Bahir,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also new to the list, but I might be able to help a bit with the jewlrey<br/>
questions.  More feedback is welcome :)<br/>
<br/>
You can add more points into your Jewlrey Craft skill after the base 21 points,<br/>
but they&#39;ll cost you.  The skills list will show how much it will cost to<br/>
increase the skill (given you have points to spend on them).  I personally<br/>
prefer to increase my jewlrey skill by practicing making jewlrey instead of<br/>
spending the money on skill points.  That would be the reason I don&#39;t add more<br/>
points to jewlrey anymore.  My skill is still low (only at 35), but actually<br/>
making the jewlrey gives for getting the money you put into the skill back,<br/>
instead of spending the money for the points, and not seeing the money back..<br/>
Also, as an enchanter, money for making the jewlrey (or anything else for that<br/>
matter :)  ) isn&#39;t too hard to come by if you&#39;re patient.  We are the only<br/>
class that can complete the Stein of Mogguk quest easily, and the Stein is<br/>
worth quite a bit of money, (I just sold mine for 250pp).  I&#39;ve run this quest<br/>
twice now, and I&#39;m planning on doing it a few more times.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about the research question as I am only level 12 right now, but I<br/>
have saved some of my practice points for research.  My question is this:<br/>
Where do I find the pages for the research?  after days of hunting the<br/>
dervishes in North Ro I picked up one page (24 of Tasarin&#39;s left side).  Are<br/>
there any other places I might be able to pick these up quicker?<br/>

&gt; Hello all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am new to the list and have Jeweling questions for you.<br/>
&gt; My questions involves training points.<br/>
&gt; After you spend the max 21 points at the guild and you get to your next<br/>
&gt; level can you put those 5 into your Jewel Craft skill? Can you do this at<br/>
&gt; each level?<br/>
&gt; I realize you may not want to do this or advise it, but is it possible?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What reasons would you give for NOT putting your training points into Jewel<br/>
&gt; Craft at each level, even if you only put in 1 or 2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, after you reach 16th, how hard is it to do research and advance it?<br/>
&gt; Should I save points for Specialization?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
