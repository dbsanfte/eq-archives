<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641987911">There are plenty of places you can hunt post 50 without a cleric.  As <br/>
an enchanter I wouldn&#39;t unless you have 1.) plenty of peridots, and <br/>
2.) a shaman/druid who knows to watch your health first before <br/>
snare/slow/DoT/Nuke<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I&#39;ve been in a group where a necro kept me alive all night =)<br/>

&gt; It really depends on what level mob&#39;s you are fighting and where.  <br/>
Once you<br/>
&gt; get into level 50+ critters, rune IV is good for 3 maybe 4 hits. The <br/>
taunt<br/>
&gt; factor I haven&#39;t really had a problem with.I&#39;ve always used rune&#39;s <br/>
on<br/>
&gt; initial breaks of an area.  If needed in battle, don&#39;t chain cast it <br/>
as your<br/>
&gt; targets health starts to fall, wait till they are under half. By the <br/>
time<br/>
&gt; the spell goes off, they will be at 2 bubbles and the mob will be <br/>
frenzied<br/>
&gt; on them. At that point, the cleric&#39;s (you do have a cleric with you, <br/>
right?<br/>
&gt; if not, don&#39;t even think about fighting level 50+ critters) CH <br/>
should be<br/>
&gt; flying through the air. If the cleric says &#39;OOM&#39;, is dead, or is LD, <br/>
then<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re stuck with rune to keep someone alive. I used 8 Rune IV&#39;s to <br/>
keep a<br/>
&gt; ranger alive in hate once. Critter never turned on me once. About to <br/>
hit 52<br/>
&gt; and get Rune V, can hardly wait. I usually carry 80 peridots on me <br/>
and end<br/>
&gt; up giving a stack of 20 to a cleric sometime on any raid I&#39;m on.<br/>
