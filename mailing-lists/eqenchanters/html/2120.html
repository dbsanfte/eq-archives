I never tried the alliance spell when the Ogre was in there, he killed me<br/>
twice.<br/>

What race do you play? Are you agnostic?<br/>
I know that choosing an Evil god will make you KoS to the Ogre even if you<br/>
have Illusion: Human up since somehow by using &quot;The Force&quot; they can sense<br/>
the evil in you. Being Agnostic takes care of this problem though.<br/>
Can Alliance be resisted?  If so, then if cast on an NPC is it considered an<br/>
attack? This may explain why you &quot;sometimes&quot; may get attacked.<br/>
