<div id="ygrps-yiv-918809248">Im about to mess around with charm. Im almost level 12 :) I played a wizard<br/>
to level 34 and got bored of blast... blast again.. what next to do maybe..<br/>
hmm I know blast!!!! hehehee Well as I was saying I noticed at level 12 my<br/>
root for my wizard got resisted allot! At level 12 can I charm anything to<br/>
make it worth it?<br/>
<br/>
Also I have no EXP with useing a charm spell. Other then you know your pet<br/>
is going to want to kill you soon enough.. hehehehehe Ant insight on what to<br/>
do, and how I will be effected?<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I am told that Tashan can help not only to stop your char from getting<br/>
resisted but it also lenghens the time you hold the charm? Is this Bull to<br/>
put it lightly :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for puting up with my newbe questions :) and all the responce from my<br/>
last posting. You seem like a frendly bunch :)</div>
