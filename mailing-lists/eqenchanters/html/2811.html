<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219197592">Hi there 21.  I too stuggled at that lvl but here is what I finally <br/>
decided.<br/>
<br/>
We enchanters love variety and dont like to actually level, but there <br/>
are times in our lives we must group in a xp farm type environment to <br/>
force us to do so.<br/>
<br/>
For me that was high keep.  I sat in guard room and other rooms off <br/>
and on for days.  Literally.  I found it was basically bub every 4 <br/>
hours.  I know that sound mind bending painful boring, but you need <br/>
to advance at times and being in group where you dont die is the <br/>
answer sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Dont kill ogres if you have done or plan to do the stien of mogguk <br/>
quest for self or others and definately dont kill treants, bad karma <br/>
friend.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my advise is this, recognize why you dont level is disdain <br/>
for boredom, after all we have gazzillon spells and things we can do -<br/>
- how on earth do you expect us just to breeze and slow and tash <br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
BTW advice, dont use your evocation DDs, they are not useful for us <br/>
in groups and should not be used at all.  Other classes are much more <br/>
effective at dealing damage, mana and otherwise.  Keep in mind we are <br/>
not damage dealers but crowd control.<br/>
<br/>
Color flux, stun etc are great.. mez here enthral there.. no no no <br/>
charms yet.... slow sit med.. <br/>
<br/>
Relax realize by doing less and controling the crowd you doing the <br/>
job you will till you are 60, good time to practice, dont <br/>
underestimate the value of the tasks you do do well, cuz nobody is <br/>
your match in them.<br/>
