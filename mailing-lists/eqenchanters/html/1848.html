&gt;Ok heres the situation. At level 28 or 29 I went to nektulos Forest with<br/>
&gt;some friends and we killed Guards and corporals for loot. We sometimes drew<br/>
&gt;overpulls but beguile let us escape them, usually by charming a guard to<br/>
&gt;fight the corporal. Today we dicided to go to Solusek and as I waited for<br/>

&gt;green to me at level 32.<br/>
&gt;The Corporal on walking apst came at me and I tashani&#39;d him and tried to<br/>
&gt;beguile him. And failed. 8 times in a row. I killed it the old fashioned<br/>

&gt;all after tashani all resisted. Another 8 casts on Corporals also after<br/>
&gt;tashani everyone resisted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was mad as hell. This isn&#39;t a random number problem this is deliberately<br/>
&gt;making a mob that I should ahve a chance of charming IMMUNE to it. When I<br/>
&gt;travel solo I have a choice, I always go with a pet spell memmed or with<br/>
&gt;beguile. Usually beguile because my other spell mix is geared to flight<br/>
&gt;rather then fight. I used to be fairly certain that with 160 charisma I<br/>
&gt;could reasonably expect to succeed in a charm of a green. Now that faith is<br/>
&gt;gone. What other random mobs has Verant decided to make IMMUNE to one of<br/>

&gt;reasonably count on now totally uncertain? I could understand making charm<br/>
&gt;spells harder to resist, but thats not what happened. They made a certain<br/>
&gt;mob type Immune to them and if they did it for one they probably did it for<br/>
&gt;others.<br/>
&gt;I think we need to ask Verant to undo this change, Charm spells are the<br/>

one in particualr?<br/>
There are a couple of Magic immune MOBs out there.<br/>
Also I disagree that Charm is our core spell.</div>
