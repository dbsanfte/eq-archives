<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988469161">The maximum you can put in at each level is determined by the skill cap for<br/>
your level.  I think the formulas include the following:<br/>
primary skills: (formula differs for monks, rogues dual wield, double<br/>
attack)<br/>
(level + 1) x 5<br/>
<br/>
secondary skills:<br/>
(level + 1) x 3<br/>
<br/>
For magic users the magic skills are primary of course.  So, at level 10 for<br/>
example the skill cap for our magic skills is (10 + 1) x 5 = 55.  The skill<br/>
cap for our melee skills (and probly offense/defense?) at level 10 is (10 +<br/>
1) x 3 = 33.  This helps explain why we can&#39;t solo as easily at higher<br/>
levels.  You can be sure NPC melee types get better than (level + 1) x 5<br/>
caps for their levels.  I&#39;ve never seen numbers on this before but I&#39;d guess<br/>
they&#39;re more like (level + 1) x 8.  So, a yellow level 20 NPC (with you at<br/>
level 19) will stack up like this:<br/>
you: melee (19 + 1) x 3 = 60<br/>
monster: melee (20 + 1) x 8 = 168<br/>
<br/>
am I on track with my numbers?<br/>

Is there a maximum you can put into a non-trade skill when training? can I<br/>
put 30 points into Evocation all at one time?<br/>
