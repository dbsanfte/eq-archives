<b>Subject:</b> RE: about the new enchant items (long rant) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-565138867">Giving us the ability to enchant items would not add anything to our class<br/>
to unbalance it vs. other casting classes. It is just a continution of our<br/>
current enchant metals line. It is what our class is about. There are lots<br/>
of jewelcrafters out there that aren&#39;t enchanters, just as there will be a<br/>
lot of people who aren&#39;t enchanters crafting magic weapons and armor if we<br/>
get the ability to enchant ore in the future. This isn&#39;t an &#39;addition&#39; to<br/>
our class, this is finally delivering what was promised...<br/>

&gt; Party pooper, party pooper. Ok you know the song, this time I fill the<br/>
&gt; role<br/>
&gt; :).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	May I point out that the message said that the code was going to be<br/>
&gt; implemented, not that -we- enchanters are going to benefit from it. True,<br/>
&gt; it was stated in the book we could do it, but at no time in B4 it was in<br/>
&gt; effect, and, according to EQE, we received other benefits to make up for<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	As I see it, such thing would overbalance us (enchanters) in regard<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; other pure spell user classes. So either the benefit will be too small to<br/>
&gt; even consider it or too huge and Verant might take out something in return<br/>
&gt; to balance our classe again. Don&#39;t tell me we&#39;re nerfed now. We were,<br/>
&gt; true,<br/>
&gt; but that was sometime ago and from my point of view we are rather balanced<br/>
&gt; regarding other pure spell users. To sum up we have our &quot;niche&quot;. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	So, the idea is: By talking here, and offering Verant options to<br/>
&gt; consider<br/>
&gt; we may have a say in the matter and make our class fuller in the way -we-<br/>
&gt; see it. What I would like to see discussed here is : What can we give up<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; have a &#39;proper&#39; enchantment line of spells?. Or are we just to receive<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; new ability/spell/line of spells without giving up anything?. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	As stated above, I dont think we can&#39;t expect a &#39;useful&#39; line of<br/>
&gt; enchantment&#39;s spells unless we give up something in exchange. Thinking<br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; of Beta, there was a line of spells we didn&#39;t have but nonetheless still<br/>
&gt; managed to survive and prosper : Pet line of spells. Plus they don&#39;t fit<br/>
&gt; enchanters very well . On the other hand, this line form the very core of<br/>
&gt; most of our solo strategies so losing it wouldn&#39;t be a small thing. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	This is just an example, a topic&#39;s starter. Feel free to agree,<br/>
&gt; disagree<br/>
&gt; or tell me to shut up. Once again my aim to to talk things out here first<br/>
&gt; and offer something (petition/ EQE/ you name it) constructive to Verant<br/>
&gt; before we see something not implemented or half implemented in place.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best,<br/>
