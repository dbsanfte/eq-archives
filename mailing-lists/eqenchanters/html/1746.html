<div id="ygrps-yiv-211938373">Indeed it does. Forget which one exactally, but you can find him fishing on the shores of the lake if you are lucky enough to be online when the typical &quot;T-Port in 1 minute before spawn time. Blast the NPC to bits for the Rare loot with one cast. Gate out. Auction Rare Item.&quot; type person isn&#39;t online, as is all too common for this Unique Item on many servers. (I&#39;ve heard of one guy that has it timed to 15 seconds, and never misses the kill when he&#39;s on.) <br/>
<br/>
You should also know that it will ruin your faction with the Qeynos Guard, and that if he runs anywhere near the guards at Surefall they will come to his aid, not yours. <br/>
<br/>
That said, good luck taking out this 35th or so level gent and hope you never have to travel near any city or guard tower associated with Qeynos again.<br/>

&gt;I know Fishbone earrings come from a high level NPC, but does anyone know who/where/loc/level needed? Does &quot;it&quot; wander around a zone? I know I am no where near getting these, but I have a goal to get these for myself and my wife.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Thanks in advance.<br/>
