&gt; &gt; How long do things<br/>
&gt; &gt; usually stay charmed?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes as little as a few seconds, other times it<br/>
&gt; can last several minutes, enough to fight one or two<br/>
&gt; fights.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about this. If you charm a magical being, like a wisp, than have it<br/>
attack, would the thing it is fighting be able to hit it? This could be<br/>
used to take on much higher level creatures that couldn&#39;t hit magical. <br/>
Might be a sort of cheat. I don&#39;t know.<br/>
