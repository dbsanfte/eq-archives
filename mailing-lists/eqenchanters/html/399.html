<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803207137">I am also a 18th lvl Druid on E&#39;ci and I have the charming spells.....this<br/>
does werk for using bigger animals on things that are tombstone......I have<br/>
taken many a trip up to Halas to have fun with my charming<br/>
spells.....although I can solo Mammy calves no problem it is ALOT of fun to<br/>
charm two calves, have them fight eachother and after one goes down kill the<br/>
other one.......but this does work so I can see how it would be<br/>
possible.....<br/>
