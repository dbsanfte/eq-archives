 </span></blockquote>Your worry is not misplaced my friend. I fear very much you are setting<br/>
yourself up for big trouble later in your career. The &quot;older&quot; you become as<br/>
an enchanter the more you will be called upon to fullfill your primary<br/>
function in a group: crowd control. This is what we do. This is what we are.<br/>
I know it is entirely possible to level your wizard/enchanter combo to level<br/>
50 and beyond with never having learned to turn an overpull of 4+ mobs from<br/>
disaster into easy victory. Dont do it!!  At level 12 you should already be<br/>
working on learning this art. Mezz , tashan, colorstuns, memblur, teamwork;<br/>
these are your tools. Its a challenging and difficult thing to learn but<br/>
very satisfying. There is NOTHING like the thrill seeing a dungeon floor<br/>
littered with the bodies of your enemies and knowing YOU made this possible.<br/>
And hearing your groupmates say &quot;WOW!!&quot; and &quot;OOM hehe&quot; and &quot;you ROCK!&quot; etc<br/>
etc<br/>
