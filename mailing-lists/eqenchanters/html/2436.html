&gt; Negative:<br/>
&gt; Basically, not being able to choose your spells like this, makes you more of<br/>
&gt; a risk to the group, you are too undecided, and cant figure out exactly what<br/>
&gt; you want to do. You rely more on yourself for the entire battle then the<br/>
&gt; entire group as a whole. You need to start to rely on your team-mates and<br/>
&gt; realize that they too can handle situations. Also, i think you probably<br/>
&gt; soloed a lot in the mid teens to mid 20&#39;s, cause most of the line up of your<br/>
&gt; spells are good for soloing.<br/>

<br/>
If it helps, I group with the same group each night. The same people<br/>
day in and day out since level 10. They know how I play. I know how they<br/>
play. We work well together. <br/>
<br/>
I have almost never soloed. Maybe a day here and there, but 99% of my<br/>
EQ time has been with the same small group of people (about 15 different<br/>
people). I&#39;ve duoed with a ranger a bit fear kiting, but most of the time<br/>
it&#39;s 5 or 6 people groups or two groups.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see myself as undecided, I see myself as taking advantage<br/>
of all that is available to me. If there is no magician or druid<br/>
around (there is one druid and no magician in the circle of friends<br/>
I normally play with) I should be using feedback on the main tank, etc.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think you have great skill as an enchanter, but i dont think that being so<br/>
&gt; undecided and changing spells either during battle, or running out of mana<br/>
&gt; (i am sure you run out fast) during a battle because you wanna use all your<br/>
&gt; spells is the best way to play an enchanter.....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;d be surprised. In a given battle, I&#39;ll usually use 20% of my<br/>
mana. <br/>
<br/>
A large majority of battles are either Tash-&gt;Tepid-&gt;DoT med<br/>
for easy singles or Tash-&gt;Tepid-&gt;DoT-&gt;Debuff for hard singles<br/>
then sit back and med. The first sequence barely puts a dent in<br/>
my mana. The second takes a little over a bubble and I&#39;m usually able<br/>
to med up most of that by the end of the battle. <br/>
<br/>
Only time I&#39;m low on mana is after a battle where Augment needs <br/>
refreshed right after (I&#39;ve spent the last couple months primarily <br/>
in Kedge Keep where Augment needs to be up all the time). <br/>
<br/>
Caster battles that are singles, I&#39;ll usually use about 40%, mostly <br/>
because of multiple Whirls (flux/shift in Kedge pulls stupid little <br/>
fish on me so I don&#39;t do it). At the same point, the wizards or druids <br/>
are at half also so I&#39;m not slowing anyone down. But anyways, Strip <br/>
Enchant-&gt;Strip Enchanter-&gt;Tash, med back up, Whirl at half till dead <br/>
doesn&#39;t take too much mana either. With the barb warrior bashing and<br/>
the wizard stunning between nukes when Tishan&#39;s cycles plus me<br/>
whirling usually means no spells get off.<br/>
<br/>
Multiples, I do crowd control purely. If I can get Tash-&gt;Tepid off<br/>
on the main target, I do. But primary responsibility is to keep<br/>
the extras off. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anywayz, thats my opinons :) take it or leave it, its up to you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll take it of course *grin*. Any discussion is cool discussion<br/>
to me! This is just the way I play. I may not have to do as much<br/>
as I do do, but doing as much as possible while everyone else<br/>
does as much as possible enables groups to do crazy things that<br/>
other people might wait 3 or 4 levels to do. <br/>
<br/>
When I play with pickup groups, I definitely play simpler, mostly<br/>
because I spend most of my time saying &quot;all on one target please&quot;.<br/>
