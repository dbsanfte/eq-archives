&gt;Verant Guy #2:  Yeah, all the enchanters are protesting by not playing.<br/>
&gt;Verant Guy #1:  Really? We&#39;ll have to thank them later. Look! The<br/>
&gt;feedback list is cut in half today.  You sure this isnt&#39; a holiday?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  This is the opposite of what we need to do, although I could be<br/>
wrong.  It seems as though they are working through improving the classes<br/>
by way of taking the most used classes first and saving the least used ones<br/>
last.  Think of how many /petitions they would get if the major Wizard bomb<br/>
spell wasnt working!  Or if Spirit of the Wind suddenly worked like Fear.<br/>
Give them time... I think the thing we must remember is BALANCE... they<br/>
must BALANCE the classes, and I&#39;m sure they are aware of this and know what<br/>
they&#39;re doing.  Hell, they MADE the game... i&#39;m sure they will FIX it</div>
