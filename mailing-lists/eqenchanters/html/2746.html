  301<br><br><br>I love people who claim to know everything. And yes please tell 
  me that I am<br>wrong that I wanted to wear the Thaumaturgists robe over the 
  Yellow Erudite<br>robe when I played. Yes, I am wrong for wanting to wear a 
  different robe<br>than the one I had been wearing for 4 months. I suppose my 
  friend is also<br>wrong for actually liking the color. In the future I will be 
  sure to listen<br>and adhere to your personal preferences.<br><br>And I dont 
  care what drivel people spout about what stats do and what stats<br>dont. We 
  have proven time and time again that we notice a greater<br>performance when 
  stats are increased... we cannot state exactly why, but our<br>performance is 
  nonetheless greater.<br><br>I personally have a 200 charisma and a 200 
  intelligence and I am aiming to<br>increase my agility now. If i feel as if my 
  performance in game has not<br>changed with the increase, perhaps Ill try 
  Dexterity next, for the last<br>alternative would be stamina for more 
  hp.<br><br>I suppose you still believe in the fact that Wisdom is what 
  affects<br>Jewelcraft. I cannot dispute if it is correct or not, but I can 
  guarantee<br>that I jewelcraft with a wisdom of 128, and people who are 
  wearing their<br>&quot;wisdom gear&quot; to get near 200 wisdom around me are failing a 
  lot worse than<br>I am, and I have a 198 skill compared to their 
  200.<br><br>But again I appreciate your explaining to me the inner workings of 
  the game<br>and what I should and should not like, as Im sure many other 
  people on this<br>thread appreciate it as well.<br><br>People dont listen to 
  when people tell you what you need and dont need. Take<br>it into account, 
  play with different configurations, and stick with what you<br>like best. Its 
  a game... have fun.<br><br>Maelael <br>53rd

  Jeremy Caswell &lt;moghedan@...&gt;<br>Subject: RE: Digest Number 
  300<br><br>Actually, I did play in the beginning, when the gossamer robe cost 
  over a<br>hundred, if you found someone selling it, people dreamed about when 
  they<br>would one day have a FBR, and people wondered what that guy in the OOT 
  was<br>for, he was wearing a funny robe.&nbsp; No one had heard of the SMR 
  yet.&nbsp; <br><br>Now&nbsp; lets talk the merits of the Tham 
  robe...<br><br>Your senior robe is AC6... ( +2 mana, that&#39;s useful )<br>the 
  Tham robe is AC5 +3 agility&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Now&nbsp; unless you still 
  live in some dream world thinking that Agility has<br>some mystical function 
  in the game; even when everyone, including Brad<br>McQuiad, the producer of 
  the game says it does not; you must know that<br>agility really only affects 
  your AC.&nbsp; For Erudites, Humans, and other lower<br>agility races, at the 
  levels that you would wear the tham robe, it takes 4<br>agility to raise your 
  ac ONE point.&nbsp; 3 agility does not raise it one whit.<br>If you are Dark 
  elf or other higher agility race ( i.e. more than 75 )&nbsp; it<br>take 6 or 7 
  points of Agility to raise your AC ONE point.<br><br>Now keep in mind, agility 
  affects your total AC, not the AC on the item, and<br>that agility HAS NO 
  OTHER FUNCTION IN EQ OTHER THAN RAISING YOUR AC.&nbsp; (( For<br>anyone piping 
  up that Agility affects your channeling, get a gun and shoot<br>yourself, you 
  are hopeless ))<br><br>Now, here is the real kicker... based on your LEVEL ( 
  nope, still not your<br>agility, but keep that dream alive ), items add more 
  AC than they list in<br>their description.&nbsp; An ac 6 item adds 8-9 to your 
  real AC number.... a AC5<br>item adds like 6-7.&nbsp; ( I do not care what 
  real number it really is, like I<br>said, it is level based, not a linear 
  formula, and all results will vary<br>anyway)&nbsp; To add to your misery, 
  just like the Agility calc, it throws away<br>fractions, so 8.999 is 8 and 
  9.001 is 9.<br><br>Now&nbsp; for the most important reason to NOT wear the 
  tham robe... IT IS CRUD<br>BROWN.&nbsp; <br>If you cannot get a pure white 
  Gossamer robe, the pinnacle of fashion, get a<br>green senior, red senior, 
  Blue senior, or even a Purple Senior from the<br>necros in FP.&nbsp; Just do 
  not wear those gay ass yellow or violet senior robe.<br><br>Now&nbsp;&nbsp; if 
  you want to continue this conversation, please direct it 
  to<br>moghedan@..., and not this list.&nbsp; I will be happy to tell 
  you all<br>the ways you are wrong in private.<br><br>Moghedan
