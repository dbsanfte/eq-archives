<div id="ygrps-yiv-729377365">Jade is the only valuable item made from silver.  It does not become<br/>
trivial until skill level 40.  You should continue to make Jade until<br/>
skill 40.<br/>
<br/>
At that point you may consider waiting until level 16 to work with<br/>
enchanted Electrum before progressing any farther.  It is cheaper to<br/>
mix cheap stones with electrum than expensives stones with silver.  A<br/>
level 22 Enchanter gave me that advice and I&#39;m sticking by it.  Save<br/>
your money for a while and pump in a big chunk of change when you hit<br/>
16th.<br/>

&gt; Make harder rings.  There are at least 6 stones<br/>
&gt; harder than jade.  I am at<br/>
&gt; skill 28 and I am pretty much finished with Jade<br/>
&gt; rings.  Jade has given me<br/>
&gt; skills already and each stone will only give a few<br/>
&gt; points.  I also noticed<br/>
&gt; that your skill advances faster if you practice soon<br/>
&gt; after leveling, and<br/>
&gt; personally I always like to sit at a table to do my<br/>
&gt; work, and it seems to<br/>
&gt; cut down on the failures a bit<br/>

&gt; &gt;This really got me mad yesterday. I put as many<br/>
&gt; training points as I<br/>
&gt; &gt;could into Jewelcraft. I then sunk 40 platinum into<br/>
&gt; the skill. I sold<br/>
&gt; &gt;all the stuff I made and put it back into the<br/>
&gt; skill.  This got me to a<br/>
&gt; &gt;skill of 37 where I was combining Amber and silver.<br/>
&gt; I was in Freeport at<br/>
&gt; &gt;the time and my skill was rising very fast I<br/>
&gt; thought. Last night I sunk<br/>
&gt; &gt;over 70 platinum into the skill. I went up a notch<br/>
&gt; to using Jade and<br/>
&gt; &gt;enchanted silver to make Mana Rings.  In 20<br/>
&gt; attempts I made 13 rings and<br/>
&gt; &gt;got NO SKILL IMPROVEMENT AT ALL.  What gives?  Am I<br/>
&gt; doing something<br/>
&gt; &gt;wrong? I thought my 70 platinum investment would<br/>
&gt; get me to at least 40<br/>
&gt; &gt;skill or higher. Now I&#39;m broke, but I have yet to<br/>
&gt; sell the Jade rings<br/>
&gt; &gt;because I was tired and frustrated. If I can get<br/>
&gt; 7-8 platinum per ring I<br/>
&gt; &gt;should get most of my money back. I would<br/>
&gt; appreciate any help here guys.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also, I found my success rate making jewelry better<br/>
&gt; when I had full<br/>
&gt; &gt;mana. I don&#39;t know if this was just a coincidence<br/>
&gt; or not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks.<br/>
