<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065076959">I got different results than this. While working on jewelcraft last<br/>
night, making electrum malachite, I found that the merchant would buy<br/>
back unenchanted bracelets for about 2cp below component cost and<br/>
enchanted bracelets for about 1gp above component cost.<br/>
<br/>
I decided that it was still better not to enchant the metal, since I was<br/>
making about a hundred of them, and waiting on mana made things much<br/>
slower. Regardless, if you have a lot of time on your hands, and money<br/>
is an issue, it might be worthwhile to enchant the metal when<br/>
practicing.<br/>

		Just a note that enchanting the silver does not alter<br/>
the price you will<br/>
		get at a merchant for your jewellery.  Note that the<br/>
merchant might sell<br/>
		the item to a player for less than you would sell it to<br/>
them (i.e. the cost<br/>
		of a non enchanted item).<br/>
<br/>
		When you&#39;re improving your skill and just intending to<br/>
sell back the<br/>
		jewellery, you should try to not enchant the metal.<br/>
When you&#39;re making<br/>
		jewellery to order, then go ahead and enchant away.<br/>

difference to the success /<br/>

value of your goods.<br/>
