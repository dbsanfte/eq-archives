<div id="ygrps-yiv-660118798">Good Point.  What you choose for specialization is dependant on your play <br/>
style. It is RECOMMENDED that enchanters specialize in alteration, but if you <br/>
think another would be more useful, then specialize in that.  A <br/>
specialize:Conjuration would be useful as well for an enchanter who is strict <br/>
crowd control and doesn&#39;t buff/debuff as much.  Specialize:Alteration is simply <br/>
recommended mostly because most of the enchanters spells ARE Alteration.<br/>

&gt; The way I did it was to let the cards fall where they may. In other words, I<br/>
&gt; trained a point in each and played the way I normally play. If my<br/>
&gt; specialization:Evocation had made it first, then obviously it was the one<br/>
&gt; that was used most often, and should be the one that got the benefits of<br/>
&gt; specialization. As luck would have it, my playstyle emphasized Alteration,<br/>
&gt; so that&#39;s what my specialty is in. That actually surprised me, given the<br/>
&gt; fact that the Mesmerize line of spells is Conjuration, and I use those very<br/>
&gt; heavily. Anyway, I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that specializing in<br/>
&gt; Alteration might be a good idea for Enchanters, but it may not be for ALL<br/>
&gt; Enchanters.<br/>
