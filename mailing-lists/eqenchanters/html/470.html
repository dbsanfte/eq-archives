&gt; I know the place that sells silver,gold, etc bars. I know all the merchants<br/>
&gt; in the spellcaster&#39;s guild that sell some jewels.<br/>
&gt; Isnt there are real jewelry in Freeport? In Erudin, you can find all sorts<br/>
&gt; of stones at the jewelry, not only the spell components. But the trip is<br/>
&gt; kinda long to get a few jewels...<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe there is a blue house in North Freeport that sells all kinds of<br/>
mundane jewelry.  Its unmarked and right next to, maybe even attached to, a<br/>
simple two story house that is empty.  Its not too far from the Free Market.<br/>
I hope that helps...<br/>
