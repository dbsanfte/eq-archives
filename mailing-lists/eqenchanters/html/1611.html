<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146727057">Just thought I&#39;d &quot;share&quot; with you a site that has the <br/>
best collection of maps for zones I have ever seen.  <br/>
When I first joined the many lists I am on, I asked if <br/>
anyone had a map of the Freeport Sewers. Well, I just <br/>
stumbled upon it, and many more that I have never seen <br/>
before.<br/>
If you hate spoilers and want to learn an area by <br/>
experiencing it, don&#39;t go to the site.<br/>
I have yet to get a character over 6th level due to <br/>
boredome with a class, and hate running through an area <br/>
that I know knothing about and end up getting lost and <br/>
walking into 3 Mummies and 2 Zombies at 5th level (has <br/>
happened, just after a repop. :(  ). <br/>
anyway, the site:<br/>

I have new respect for Rangers.  This group has their <br/>
act together.<br/>
