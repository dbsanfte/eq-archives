<div id="ygrps-yiv-273980727">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list. I have some questions, hopefully not all of them have<br/>
been asked before. I&#39;m now level 20.<br/>
<br/>
1. Whirl till you Hurl - is this useful at all anymore ? I heard that it<br/>
used to be a 15 second guaranteed stun and enchanters did nothing but<br/>
whirl all day, and now it&#39;s nerfed to uselessness.<br/>
<br/>
2. Disempower and Enfeeblement. I cast both on myself, and lost 54 str and<br/>
71 agi. I can see that I can waste a tank in PvP with these spells but are<br/>
they useful against MOBS ? Do MOBs have str, agi and other stats, or just<br/>
ac and atk ? Currently I do not use these spells.<br/>
<br/>
3. I&#39;m still using mesmerize. Why is enthrall better ? Lower resists ? Longer<br/>
duration ? Btw, I find that against orcs in Highpass, Mesmerize would <br/>
consistently wipe hate lists, very useful when charmed orcs turn against you.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend highpass for fledgling enchanters 17-20. Get your highpass<br/>
guard faction up, and learn how to deal with huge fights. I loved all the<br/>
action you got there. Charm can really turn tables in those fights. Suddenly<br/>
their healer is smacking them instead of healing them. Or they are getting <br/>
backstabbed by orc scouts.<br/>
<br/>
4. What is the speed improvement of quickness and others in that line ? Does<br/>
the speed improvement of quickness increase as you rise in levels ? Does<br/>
the meditation boost of clarity increase as you rise in levels ? <br/>
<br/>
For lvl 20 enchanters out there, aviak guards in Lake Rathe, including those <br/>
that con even are very easy to solo. Get a magician summoned dagger for your <br/>
pet. This reduces its atk delay. Then give it quickness to make it really <br/>
abusive. Then berserker str. Draw a guard with tashani/languid pace/choke. <br/>
The pet is so powerful that the guard is down to 2 bubbles of life before it&#39;s <br/>
worked through the berserker str skin. The pet ends the fight with only 1 bubble <br/>
of life lost. I&#39;m pretty sure it outdamages any lvl 20 tank. The best pet does<br/>
max dmg 22. <br/>
