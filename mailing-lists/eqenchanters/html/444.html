<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Q1.02:   How do i get to this library in Neriak  alive?<br/>
&gt;A1.02:  To go there make shure to be invis until  you are inside the<br/>
&gt;library unless you are  a darkelf, as the patrolling guards in  commons<br/>
&gt;sometimes attack humans and erudits, even with illusion: darkelf casted, as<br/>
&gt;the illusion spell does  not seem to hide faction standing. Cast  illusion:<br/>
&gt;darkelf when standing before the NPC, but consider first to make shure  he<br/>
&gt;won&#39;t attack.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A1.02b : Once reaching the vendors, you can actually use minor illusion.<br/>
They do accepts lamps as customers.<br/>
