&gt; Hi All!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was reading on eq.castersrealm.com about research (gettin close to 16<br/>
&gt; and I REALLY want mesmerisation :)  ), I need to find page 26 of<br/>
&gt; Tsarin&#39;s Grimoire left and right for it.  Does anyone know where it<br/>
&gt; drops or where I might be able to buy it?  Also, Is the tome of Endless<br/>
&gt; Enchantments in the general Enchanter guild area or do I need to travel<br/>
&gt; to find this as well?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All research components are randomly dropped by any monsters that are above <br/>
level 16 for the approximate level of the spell to which it goes.  That sounded <br/>
confusing, let me try again.  Basically, level 16 - 20 monsters will randomly <br/>
drop level 16 spell components, level 20 - 25 will randomly drop level 20 spell <br/>
components, etc.  These aren&#39;t exact, but you get the idea.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also ran across the page on specialization, and it&#39;s got me curious<br/>
&gt; now..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This page says that the spell skills will cap at 50 skill and you can<br/>
&gt; then specialize in one.  I&#39;m level 14 right now, and All of my spell<br/>
&gt; skills are at 75 (except conjuration, which is at 36, uck, need to keep<br/>
&gt; working on that one).  Has something changed with specialization or am I<br/>
&gt; just not understanding something?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way this works:<br/>
Your spell ability has nothing to do with it.  You have one specialization <br/>
skill for each spell type (check your abilities list at your guild).  The first <br/>
specialization that reaches 51 becomes your specialization, and you can <br/>
increase that from then on.  Each of the other specializations will then cap at <br/>
50.<br/>
