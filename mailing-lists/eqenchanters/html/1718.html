 &gt; These could include, but are not limited to:<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; (ALCHEMY) (Too recently implemented for me to talk to enough Shamans to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>get a good idea on this one):<br/>
<br/>
 We should not get this one as it is a  Shaman special ability.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; (FLETCHING) Enchant Wood Staff:<br/>
 &gt; A Runed Oak Bow is mentioned in The Official Player&#39;s Guide, but no <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fletcher has the slightest idea of how to get a Bow Staff made into a magical <br/>
item, and we don&#39;t have the ability at this time. The resulting completed Bow <br/>
(with a higher difficulty rating then making a normal bow, of course) could <br/>
hit for 1-2 more damage or in line with Verant&#39;s &quot;any altering to a bow <br/>
decreases Attack Delay and Damage&quot; base, reduce both Damage and Delay Ratings <br/>
on a completed Bow in addition to any bought materials from merchants. Oak, <br/>
as the first wood that can be double cammed, would be the minimum affected, <br/>
and Ceramic and Steel Bow Staves need to be implemented to be fair to high <br/>
skill Fletchers.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Like Enchanters cant have a high skill at fletching?<br/>
 This skill actually already uses two amgic items to increase the effect and <br/>
is a good example of what we might be able to do.<br/>
 The Planing tool and Whittling blade could be created by us and a blacksmith.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; (TINKERING) ?:<br/>
 &gt; Any Gnomes out there know if this is even implemented yet? Or in working <br/>
 </span></blockquote>order, if so?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Works great but we still dont know how to make some items described in the <br/>
book :)<br/>
www.eqportal.com/tinkering<br/>
  I cant see Enchanting helping this skill any though.  It just would not <br/>
feel right to mix them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	On Alchemy, I am not saying we should gain the skill. It is the <br/>
providence of the Shaman and should remain as such. What I am saying is; as <br/>
we can enchant metal to aid in Jewelcrafting, a similar spell to aid in the <br/>
final product of Alchemy could be a possibility, and still fit in with <br/>
Verant&#39;s &quot;Enchant = Trade Skill&quot; base. Again, I still need information on the <br/>
skill from a Shaman or make one myself to get the information needed to make <br/>
an intelligent suggestion.<br/>
	On Fletching, by &quot;high skill&quot; I mean working in Darkwood or better, a <br/>
range of skill 100 ranks can&#39;t reasonably touch with a decent success rate. <br/>
(The god&#39;s know I should have gotten mine over 168 before they ruined the <br/>
skill with the patch that makes each rank cost 5 times more.)<br/>
	Furthermore, while each individual item used in Fletching does indeed <br/>
say &quot;MAGIC ITEM,&quot; the resulting product from Fletching is not. An Enchanted <br/>
Bow would add to the Fletching tools already in place (Blade, Tool, Cams, and <br/>
Strings) aiding their effects with magical power. Perhaps, as I suggested, <br/>
adding damage to make up for the reduction brought about by using the tools <br/>
or reducing delay time keeping with the &quot;adjustments to a bow have to cause <br/>
less damage and delay&quot;, even though Real World Cams are used for additional <br/>
power, i.e. damage, (or even make them a magical item, a bow that could cast <br/>
Snare [1st rank spell] would be an Archer&#39;s dream, but these would require <br/>
only the finest of materials [which haven&#39;t been implemented])<br/>
	On Tinkering, thanks for the link. It would appear that the skill <br/>
needs to actually be finished before any suggestion could be made. At this <br/>
time I have to agree that I don&#39;t see where Enchanting any of the materials <br/>
could be aidful, but there needs to be a lot of work done and final products <br/>
to examine before I&#39;d write it off completely.</div>
