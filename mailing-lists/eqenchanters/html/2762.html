<div id="ygrps-yiv-71244899">I always give my pet two REGULAR daggers I buy in the shops cost about 2 plat each, no biggie. From what I see with my pet (lvl 49), He is much more effective by having that extra piercing attack of 52 on top of when he doubles. Throw Swift like the wind on him and watch him work, He shreds giants, Cyclops and spectres with ease.</div>
