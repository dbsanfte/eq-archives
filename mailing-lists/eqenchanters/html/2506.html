<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028371946"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ok.. I just wondering where enchanters fit in here.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m new to the list and I would like to know how to play an enchanter at<br/>
&gt;lower levels.  I have a Paladin 30, Druid 30, and Enchanter 5.  I&#39;m finding<br/>
&gt;I get myself killed with the pet as much as it has saved me.  Enchanter has<br/>
&gt;been by far the hardest to play of the 3.  I know they are a group<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh, I personally dont recommend an enchanter soloing, although they can all<br/>
the way to level 50, mostly because of charm. Tho you can use a pet as well.<br/>
But it is true that we are extremely powerful solo classes, I can break<br/>
almost any spawn solo save for a few of the really mean ones. You can break<br/>
and camp virtually any camp in lower guk (still havent done King, Lord, or<br/>
Frenzy solo tho). But I have done sage, magi, hand, and even cleared live<br/>
tower and solod the crusader and priest (the entire tower had to be cleared)<br/>
<br/>
Seafuries are always fun and easy to solo. THe reason i dont recommend<br/>
soloing is because of efficiency. In a party an enchanter/cleric combo will<br/>
get you the most xp in the least amount of time. In a good party who knows<br/>
what they are doing, you never have to stop pulling. Because all the mobs<br/>
are mesd, the cleric is only healing 1 party member, and losing little mana.<br/>
Downtime is very rare.<br/>
<br/>
So i recommend partying since an enchanter amplifies a groups power, wait<br/>
til you are level 40-50 to solo and amaze you friends =)<br/>
