&gt;<br/>
&gt; after much research and failures, I finally got Mesmerization.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried to<br/>
&gt; use it a couple times last night but it did not seem to work too<br/>
&gt; well. Most<br/>
&gt; of the enemies resisted if not all of them. Any comment on this spell? is<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like it either.  Unless you are fighting blues and greens, this<br/>
spell will just get you killed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I still am missing one half of the page needed to make this spell, so I<br/>
can&#39;t comment on it.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, I&#39;ve been casting quickness on some tanks in my party and they were<br/>
&gt; unable to tell me how good / bad it is...anybody got some feedback on that<br/>
&gt; from tanks who pay attention?<br/>
&gt; thanks,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Any &quot;tank&quot; should immediately notice the effect of this spell.  It *greatly*<br/>
improves their attack time.  It seems to lower the speed of a weapon by<br/>
about 10 delay, which is quit a bit.<br/>
