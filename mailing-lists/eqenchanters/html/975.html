I read the descriptions at EQVault and back before they changed the spell<br/>
descriptions. Don&#39;t be a Verant apologizt they and everyone else knew the<br/>
stuns were broken and then isntead of fixing them they turned the breakage<br/>
into a feature. And stunning for 2 seconds would ahve disrupted their casts<br/>
as well. The only difference is that the new and improved stun is ONLY<br/>
useful on certain spell casting mobs. <br/>

&gt;&gt; Direct damage spells that ahve &quot;stuns&quot; that don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; work, yet cause us to ahve<br/>
&gt;&gt; total resists instead of partial ones and a higher<br/>
&gt;&gt; overall resist rate.<br/>

&gt;Where in the game does it say these spells are supposed to stun?  You<br/>
&gt;may have read this description on someone&#39;s web page, but I doubt<br/>
&gt;anyone at Verant said that it would stun.  I seem to recall them saying<br/>
&gt;that the spells would shock rather than stun.  The shock effect causes<br/>
&gt;a spellcaster to be interrupted.  Try it on a spell casting mob.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;gotten it to work on Orc oracles.  Hit one of the chaos flux types as<br/>
&gt;soon as you see their grubby little hands glow and you can fizzle their spell.<br/>
