<b>Subject:</b> Wolf&#39;s Eye Agate (where did it go?) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118042226">Subject says it all, I need help locating Wolf&#39;s Eye Agate... everywhere<br/>
that I knew it to be its not.  I also noticed that ruby is a lot more common<br/>
on vendors than it used to be, hmmm. Hope Wolf&#39;s eye is still for sell.<br/>
Thanks in advance for the assist.</div>
