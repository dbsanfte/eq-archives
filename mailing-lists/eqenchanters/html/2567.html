<div id="ygrps-yiv-736607703">Being Level 50, i need to ask you a question...I am level 41, and have been<br/>
working on getting my INT up, not my CHA.<br/>
my int is 189, and my cha is 135 with buff.<br/>
<br/>
I hear for the Planes you really need a high CHA, can you comment on this<br/>
Maelael?<br/>
<br/>
Thanx<br/>

&gt; I would just like to add that I tried to mes Choon, and he broke it within<br/>
3<br/>
&gt; seconds, SGs I have been able to mes long enough for me to get ahead to<br/>
&gt; zone.<br/>
&gt; However, Fire Giants and Ice Giants will break it immediately, it will say<br/>
&gt; they have been &quot;entranced&quot; but wont miss a swing. Seafury cyclops also<br/>
&gt; cannot be mesd for longer than 1 second. The Giant Wooly Spider in<br/>
&gt; Permafrost can be mesd. Youll also find that everything in the planes,<br/>
save<br/>
&gt; for Spite Golems, can be mez, but can be very tricky to get under control.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;On most things mez is a fixed duration. All giant class creatures are<br/>
&gt; highly<br/>
&gt; &gt;resistant to mez (lasts half as long as on other critters or less). Other<br/>
&gt; &gt;high level critters are immune to mez also.<br/>
