But I could be wrong.<br/>

If you are getting a magician to summon a weapon for your pet, go for<br/>
the lvl 1 summon dagger spell, its 3/21 but magical, if people are<br/>
accurate that only the speed matters then that is your best bet...  No<br/>
to mention if with you&#39;re a magician make sure he fire sheilds your pet,<br/>
they really kick butt with that...<br/>
