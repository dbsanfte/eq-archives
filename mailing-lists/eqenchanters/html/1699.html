<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224750907"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; They would<br/>
&gt; have to give us something REALLY good to make up for<br/>
&gt; taking away our pets if<br/>
&gt; they decided to do that. Although I can see it in<br/>
&gt; one place.  The Race Wars<br/>
&gt; server.  We will RULE the race war server.  With the<br/>
&gt; ablitity to blind,<br/>
&gt; root, and change forms we can effectivly be that<br/>
&gt; assassins of the Race War.<br/>
&gt; That, or if you choose we are the only class that<br/>
&gt; can travel anywhere and<br/>
&gt; not be attacked as some as someone sees us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I noticed one disturbing thing on Test Server though,<br/>
there were a TON of enchanters on it.  They were<br/>
mostly low lvl too, meaning other people are thinking<br/>
along the same lines we are.<br/>
