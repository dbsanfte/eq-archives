<div id="ygrps-yiv-357594468">I went though the trouble of doing a hail to a few NPCs at the guild in Freeport for my level 9 char and at the end where you say that you would like to take part in which ever quest the are talking about, I got a reply that my powers were too high.<br/>
One NPC is located outside under the teleporter to the guild and the other is in the guild at the bottom floor... the guy is at the bottom of the stairs, make a sharp left. (sorry, but i don&#39;t remember their names)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know of anyother quest that you don&#39;t have to be low level to start?<br/>

&gt;	If you are talking about specific quest for Enchanters I failed yet to<br/>
&gt;find one in Erudin. Now Im looking all over Freeport, rumour is there is an<br/>
&gt;Enchanter npc near the necro&#39;s guild<br/>
