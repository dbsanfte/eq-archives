<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-91548509">Got to agree with you here. Once I break up something into solo pulls<br/>
(lately it&#39;s been Lord/AM/Hand in Lower Guk), which with a good group<br/>
usually takes an hour (2 spawn cycles),  what am I supposed to do on the<br/>
singles we&#39;re pulling for the next four hours? Yes I stun them for most of<br/>
their short lifespan, but that&#39;s so little mana I can fit in a DD and still<br/>
be back to full mana by the next pull. Besides, evoke is trailing behind my<br/>
other skills (under 200 at level 44), I need to get work in on it when the<br/>
situation can handle it. Any spell casters that get pulled must go down hard<br/>
and ugly with DD&#39;s, after two stuns of course. If spell casting mobs get 2<br/>
spells off on my group after the initial pull, I consider that I did a poor<br/>
job on them. Never nuke early, never nuke often. And if you ever do get into<br/>
a situation where&#39;s there&#39;s 2 enchanters grouped together (rare, but I have<br/>
had it happen), one can do a little more nuking even. Enchanters are one of<br/>
the most flexible of the spellcasters, we can buff, debuff, crowd control,<br/>
and do damage, indirectly and directly. Know the situation and adapt to it.<br/>
I will add that when I need buff, it&#39;s the damage spell that has it&#39;s slot<br/>
taken by the buff spell.<br/>
