<div id="ygrps-yiv-409847043">Greetings.<br/>
<br/>
I have had two major self only quests I have been working on since this game<br/>
started in release.  They are quite silly ones, but ones that mean a lot to<br/>
me and ones that I have invested a lot of time and effort into.  These are<br/>
1. Being able to walk freely in my un-illusioned DE Agnostic form in every<br/>
city.  and 2. Mastering every language in the game to excellent.<br/>
<br/>
The first one I am 90% complete.  I can freely walk through felwithe (much<br/>
to the amazement of the high elf pcs), kelethin, kaladim, etc. etc.  I am<br/>
still working on Halas and Ak&#39;anon.  This has been done 100% -without- using<br/>
the guild note trick, purely from quests and killing the right combination<br/>
of mobs.  Something I take great pride in actually.<br/>
<br/>
The second one I have run into a brick wall.  The research languages are<br/>
easy to purchase in any zone, as so many people needed them, that everyone<br/>
and their brother now knows combine, old erudin, etc. etc.  Heck, the tank<br/>
in my group two nights ago offered to teach me Combine for 5pp during our<br/>
downtime.  The problem is the fringe languages.  I was young and stupid, and<br/>
as soon as a language became available at the trainer, I would put a point<br/>
into it.  Not knowing what I know now that that first point roughly equals<br/>
your level in skill points.<br/>
<br/>
To make a very long and rambling first post short (he he, sorry), I am<br/>
looking for Gnoll, Goblin, Kobold, Fairie, Lizardman, Froglock, and Orc to<br/>
be trained to excellent on the Karana server.  If there is any kind hearted<br/>
enchanter there that would sell me these languages, and/or take the time to<br/>
train me in them, I would be most grateful.  If anyone can help, please send<br/>
me an email or an ingame tell.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
