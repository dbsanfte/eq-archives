<div id="ygrps-yiv-198445487">Aradune send a couple system messages last night. He talked about some stuff that he had to some areas. I can&#39;t remeber what the names were of the places but I have no idea where they are. Could someone infor me on this? The names where like (someone)&#39;s Liar and (someone)&#39;s eye. He also said that they were for mid to high level players. Huh glad you are specific on that Brad. Woud that be level 25-50?</div>
