<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907586817">Saw this posted on EQ&#39;Lizer and wanted to confirm my suspicions that it is<br/>
misinformation. They are listed as going into the sleeve slot. As far as I<br/>
know, not only is there not a gem/metal combination that grants +3str/+3wis,<br/>
we can&#39;t make anything that fits into the sleeve slot.<br/>

Platinum Armband <br/>
Platinum armbands grant +3 strength and +3 wisdom. Unfortunately they do not<br/>
have any armor class. They can be made by a skilled jeweler.</div>
