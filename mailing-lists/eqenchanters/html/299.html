<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067872329">I have recently acheived level 8 and would like to be able<br/>
to summon a pet that doesn&#39;t con green to me. I have been<br/>
told that the only place to get Mircyl&#39;s Animation is in High<br/>
Hold Keep. I know the way is treacherous, and am asking for<br/>
help from my fellow enchanters. Attached below is a map of<br/>
High Hold Pass that I got off of one of the most incredible EQ<br/>
map sites I have seen to date. Unfortunately, almost everything<br/>
on the site is in Japanese. If one of you who has made the trip <br/>
could mark the path to take from Kithicor to the bank, then to<br/>
the vendor who sells the spells and maybe annotate a few <br/>
things to watch out for (like the prisoners past the bank), I, along<br/>
with all the up-and-coming enchanters out there, would be<br/>
very appreciative. <br/>
