<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086311137">Ways to get rid of beggars (some actually performed):<br/>
<br/>
1.  say &quot;The begging skill is supposed to be used on NPC&#39;s, do I look like a<br/>
NPC to you?&quot;<br/>
2.  Challenge them to a duel<br/>
3.  Invite them, and port them to the middle of no where.  Say: Beg your way<br/>
out of that one.<br/>
4.  Ignore them<br/>
5.  Put on afk or feign afk<br/>
6.  Tell them the  POD gives away cool stuff and to beg something off of<br/>
him.<br/>
7.  say to them:  I know eq says I&quot;m lvl 30, but I&#39;m really lvl 3, do you<br/>
have any copper I can beg off of you?<br/>
8.  say:  Give me 5 good reasons you deserve this stuff more than that Orc<br/>
Pawn over there.<br/>
9.  start a conversation with yourself outloud about what a true newbie is<br/>
10.  ask them, Why does verant let ppl like you play a game like this<br/>
anyway?<br/>
<br/>
If you ask my eq husband, he will tell you I am actually a very nice person<br/>
and give stuff away all the time.  I get tired though, of every time I<br/>
decide to visit Gfay, I seem to get bombarded with ppl asking me for things<br/>
all the time.  And the WORST is when they ask me if they can have sow, and<br/>
then I say, i&#39;m sorry, i&#39;m an ench, they say, oo, well, can I have sow? uhh<br/>
lol<br/>
<br/>
Please dont take any of those lines personally, just jokin around.  Thanks<br/>
:)<br/>

&gt; My favorite example of why I don&#39;t like beggars came after I happened to<br/>
&gt; pick up a Runed Totem Staff while passing through Lake Rathe. Now when I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; level 8 or 9 there was nothing in the game I wanted more than one of<br/>
those,<br/>
&gt; and I finally managed to loot one of my very own by the time I was 12 or<br/>
13.<br/>
&gt; I have long since moved on to other things, and getting this formerly-uber<br/>
&gt; staff from a gnoll in one shot made me realize just how much tougher I am<br/>
&gt; now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I kept the staff in my inventory, just because I thought some low-level<br/>
&gt; would be able to use it. The next day, in Felwithe, some level one person<br/>
&gt; asked if I could help them out. I usually just throw on a few buffs and<br/>
say<br/>
&gt; &quot;Okay, now you can go kill things to get money and experience&quot; but I<br/>
&gt; happened to have this staff and a generous mood.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I put the staff into a trade window, saying &quot;Here you go.&quot; The beggar<br/>
&gt; actually cancelled the trade and said &quot;Do you have anything better?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Needless to say, he didn&#39;t get any items or buffs after that.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; heh I agree.  I had someone come up to me in oasis last night and say &quot;Can<br/>
&gt; you buff me?&quot;  I had time so what the heck, I threw on UV, aug, str,<br/>
endure<br/>
&gt; magic, obscure, and even a rune III.  Did I get a thanks?  Nope, the<br/>
&gt; response was &quot;can&#39;t you sow me too?&quot;  Sigh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Next was the response from some people when I participated in a dragon<br/>
raid<br/>
&gt; with my guild.  I&#39;m level 35 so I raised some eyebrows when they saw me<br/>
&gt; there for Nagafen.  However, I was there just to hang out with my<br/>
guild,cast<br/>
&gt; clarity, and buff whenever my buffs were needed/wanted.  Many people were<br/>
&gt; thankful as I was the only enchanter at times.  Others though turned their<br/>
&gt; noses up (none in my guild of course ;)) at aug because it wasn&#39;t swift<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; the wind and endure magic because it wasn&#39;t a higher form of that buff.  I<br/>
&gt; cast 100p worth of RuneIIIs and received thanks for a few but not for<br/>
most.<br/>
&gt; A guildmate gave me a saphire so the cost worked out in the end but it<br/>
made<br/>
&gt; me sad to see the reaction of some strangers to my help.  I&#39;m not aware of<br/>
&gt; all of the spells that take components but if you didn&#39;t know it does cost<br/>
&gt; your friendly groupmates to cast some of those buffs.  If it&#39;s a normal<br/>
&gt; group type situation I am happy to spend 20 or 30p for a night keeping the<br/>
&gt; puller or primary tank Runed.  It&#39;s part of what I do.  Those who request<br/>
&gt; Rune and offer no thanks are the ones that get me though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then there are those who are confused why I&#39;m wearing such &quot;crappy<br/>
&gt; equipment&quot; when I&#39;m also wearing a Tranix crown.  Hehe, what kind of<br/>
&gt; question is that?  I&#39;m doing the best I can  8)   I was just very lucky my<br/>
&gt; guild asked me to roll on the crown during a FG raid and I won.  That was<br/>
&gt; another time I tagged along to cast clarity and didn&#39;t dream I would be<br/>
&gt; asked to roll on an item.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just remember to say please and thank you and it&#39;s so much more fun ;)<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; happy to buff people for free mana permitting if they only would say thank<br/>
&gt; you.  Many do and I say thanks!<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] (Re: to Mark ) and a rant (sorry ;-) )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night I had a level 3 wizard come up to me and inspect me 9(!!!!)<br/>
times<br/>
&gt; in about 2 minutes. It isn&#39;t like my equipment changed in that time...<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; he asked the question I knew was coming. &quot;Got any stuff you don&#39;t need, or<br/>
&gt; plat?&quot;  &lt;~ asked for PLAT! He then followed with &quot;I&#39;m new to EQ.&quot;.  You<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; got to be joking! A true newbie would not be asking for equipment, they<br/>
&gt; would be asking for what is safe to hunt here, and other basic questions.<br/>
My<br/>
&gt; reply was (after inspecting him 30 times or so rapidly) &quot;No, I need the<br/>
&gt; equipment I have as I am using it. There is no such thing as money I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; need, especially plat. Now go kill things for what you need like I did.&quot;<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; then got up and ran to my spawn point with SoW on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Beggars get under my skin in a heartbeat. I don&#39;t mind helping others; in<br/>
&gt; fact I enjoy it and give things away all the time. Nothing major, leather<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; druids, etc and buffs are free. I just can&#39;t stand seeing people standing<br/>
&gt; outside a bank for HOURS pestering every person that comes by for stuff<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; they could have spent that time leveling. One person I know had it<br/>
hotkeyed<br/>
&gt; it came out so fast and so repeatedly.<br/>
&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; Uthanatos<br/>
&gt; &quot;Warning label reads: Beggars are KoS, now what do you want?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Too bad Sentinel doesn&#39;t warn you when a beggar is around.&quot;<br/>
