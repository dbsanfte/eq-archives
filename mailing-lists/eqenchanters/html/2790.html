<div id="ygrps-yiv-252637665">I agree .. no traffic on this list lately.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could answer your questions but my enchantress was stuck at level<br/>
16 for 5 months, and now at level 21 for about 3 months .. so I am hardly an<br/>
expert at anything &#39;enchanting&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I bought the mana spells .. but have never used them.<br/>
<br/>
I have not figured out how to get any color spell to actually work without<br/>
resisting.<br/>
<br/>
I do know how to cast breeze and have done a bit of jewelcraft (skill 74)<br/>
but my enchantress has absolutely no money to buy jewels and metal bars ..<br/>
plus she can&#39;t do anything past electrum till she moves up in levels anyway<br/>
.. so that is stagnant too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I die everytime I take on a mob these days .. so .. she is parked for now.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully someone else can help you with spell lineups, etc.  Hello out<br/>
there!!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Looking at the list message history the last message posted before my<br/>
&gt; questions on 7/24 (that email is below for convienence) was on 7/7.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Did everyone spontaneously combust, exodus the list, quit eq, or go postal<br/>
&gt; and are now serving 30 years in the State Pen?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Pink Floyd is heard in the background* Is anybody out there?<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] New to List and a Few Questions....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hail all, I am new to the list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have played an enchanter before, but not past 8th level.  I am going to<br/>
&gt; create a gnome enchanter and I have a few questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At 12th level, how does Charisma effect the length of the Charm spell?<br/>
&gt; Is this effected by Tashan at all?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From 8th to 11th how well does this strategy work out on evens/yellows?<br/>
&gt; 1) Tashan<br/>
&gt; 2) Color Flux (after pet engages)<br/>
&gt; 3) Root or Blind / Fear<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From 12th on how well does this strategy work out on evens/yellows?<br/>
&gt; (Using highest level pet possible per level, fully buffed)<br/>
&gt; 1) Open with Tashan<br/>
&gt; 2) After Pet engages cast &quot;Whirl-Til&quot;<br/>
&gt; 3) Cast Choke (optional)<br/>
&gt; 4) Med til pet starts getting hit, cast &quot;Whirl&quot; again<br/>
&gt; 5) Repeat 4 til mob dies<br/>
&gt; This looks good on paper, but would it work in the game? Recast time on<br/>
&gt; &quot;Whirl&quot; a factor here?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What good are the vials created via Thicken Mana? Are they stackable if<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; use stackable vials? Can you use them in combat?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone figured out how to use the Gem Cutter? What benefit does this<br/>
&gt; actually have on Jewel Crafting?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
