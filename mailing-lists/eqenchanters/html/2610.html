You must be low level for the blur part of mes to work, at higher levels<br/>
they almost never forget who is mezzing them. But of course if you do hit a<br/>
successfull memblur, it will be as if you never fought. I believe the<br/>
memblur component of mez worked until around level 30ish. The higher mez are<br/>
supposed to have higher mem blur with them, but I always use entrance which<br/>
prolly isnt high enough for the level 40+ mobs i fight.<br/>
<br/>
If blur is sticking and not gaining you faction, throw a tashan(i)(ia)<br/>
towards the end of the fight to get you back on the list.<br/>
Its cheap and fast and puts you on its aggro.<br/>
