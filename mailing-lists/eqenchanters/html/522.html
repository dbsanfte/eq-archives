Let me say first off, your training points are VERY VERY valuable!! Use the<br/>
as wisely as you possible can. If you are not going to be serious about<br/>
jewel craft, dont use any there at all. I would highly suggest saving them<br/>
for Research and Speicalize and Dodge. As for Speicalize, once again, save<br/>
em if your about to get level 20 or already have, for at this time it is<br/>
broken. The way I understand it, specialize will allow you to raise your<br/>
schools of magic higher than currently available. As for Dodge, only put 1<br/>
training point to it, it will improve on it&#39;s own just fine if you keep<br/>
your melee skills up. As for the levels past 22, you will have very little<br/>
use for them excluding the luxuries such as languages, fishing (HA!) and<br/>
whatever. To comment about Research, it is the easiest skill to raise in<br/>
the game, yet hardest to find the pages we need to raise the skill. Unless<br/>
you want to be the last person to have the spells obtained by Research, I&#39;d<br/>
highly suggest pouring all the points you can into this and buying the tomb<br/>
of Endless Enchantments (the red book). As for keeping your different<br/>
schools of magic max ed, that is simple enough with proper attention to<br/>
your current skill and making sure they are max ed. I personally feel it is<br/>
a total waste of training points to put them toward anything that will max<br/>
out on its own with just a little effort.<br/>
