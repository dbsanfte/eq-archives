<div id="ygrps-yiv-848362098">Her name is Pyzgin, and she spawns by the undead ruins (if you camp on the<br/>
hill, she will spawn on the other side of the ruins).  Unless something has<br/>
changed in the last couple of months, Putrid skellies are her place holder, not<br/>
Tovax.  Also, she doesn&#39;t seem to spawn if you sit to close, so keep your<br/>
distance.  It takes about 2 hours of killing to get her to come.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck</div>
