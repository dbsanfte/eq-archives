<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045710467">Well, I have been in since P2 and I am on the P2 only message boards that<br/>
Verant posts on. From posts DIRECTLY from the magic guy, GZ, it is quite<br/>
evident that Charisma DOES affect most, if not all, of the enchanter spells.<br/>
How much? That is the current debate. You need to learn to accept the<br/>
opinions of others as that, and stop down playing everyone else. We are here<br/>
to try and learn from each other, so please keep it that way.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; well I hate to agree with sumone that is so definate but.......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         I have been playing since beta4 and have freinds that have been in<br/>
&gt; since phase 3......even Stratics and the EQVault (which are<br/>
&gt; authored by beta<br/>
&gt; testers!!!) tell us that charisma is the direct effect of merchant<br/>
&gt; sales.......the debates you are talking about are obviously on<br/>
&gt; webpages that<br/>
&gt; are NEWER or are made by ppl who are just lrearning the game and are made<br/>
&gt; based on assumtions of ingame actions......if you read EQSS and find out<br/>
&gt; what they say....... I quote straigth from the ATTRIBUTE section<br/>
&gt; on the left<br/>
&gt; hand side of the website......this is cut and copied for all you NON<br/>
&gt; belivers!!!   if you ppl will notice that ONLY the charm spell is effected<br/>
&gt; by CHARISMA!!!!........the ***&quot;CHARM&quot; LINE OF SPELLS ONLY***!!!!&gt;........<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     STRAIGHT FROM STRATICS ATRIBUTE PAGE!!!!      eqss.stratics.com<br/>
&gt; &quot;WISDOM (Mana for Priests, Resistance to Mind Spells, Tertiary<br/>
&gt; Skill Check)<br/>
&gt; WIS is the mana determinant for the priestly casters, and their derived<br/>
&gt; hybrids (Cleric, Shaman, Druid, Ranger, Paladin). It is bar none the most<br/>
&gt; important stat for the former three classes and a consideration for the<br/>
&gt; latter two. This attribute also affects your character&#39;s<br/>
&gt; resistance against<br/>
&gt; mind-affecting spells, such as Charm. In addition, WIS provides a last<br/>
&gt; chance to succeed at a failed skill roll. Although INT is the secondary<br/>
&gt; skill-up attribute for most skills, WIS may grant you to continue a failed<br/>
&gt; skill roll. Minimal as the chance may be, it is still the opportunity to<br/>
&gt; succeed on a roll one has already failed via skill check.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; INTELLIGENCE (Mana for Mages, Skill Gain)<br/>
&gt; INT is the mana determinant for the non-priestly casters (Wizard,<br/>
&gt; Enchanter,<br/>
&gt; Magician, Necromancer), their derived hybrid (Shadowknight), and also<br/>
&gt; determines how quickly one will gain skills. As such, it is<br/>
&gt; important to all<br/>
&gt; classes, but is especially so for the four non-priestly casters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; CHARISMA (Faction Standing, Merchant Prices, Charm Success)<br/>
&gt; CHA affects NPC prices--when both buying and selling--and also<br/>
&gt; how NPCs will<br/>
&gt; react to you. While generally not a stat that most people raise,<br/>
&gt; saving some<br/>
&gt; hard-earned platinum on that plate breastplate is always a nice<br/>
&gt; bonus. Also,<br/>
&gt; CHA is almost the INT of faction. By having high CHA, you reduce<br/>
&gt; the amount<br/>
&gt; of faction you need to have NPCs change their view toward you.<br/>
&gt; This can be a<br/>
&gt; nice bonus when questing. It is also a factor for Charm spells, which<br/>
&gt; notably affects the enchanter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;             OK so can we put this to rest until more thourough and<br/>
&gt; conclusive information can be posted or studied?......please ppl<br/>
&gt; we need sum<br/>
&gt; new topics.......<br/>
