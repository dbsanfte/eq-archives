<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761042469"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m 25 at the moment, and up until recently Whirl Until You Hurl has been <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve obviously only been around for a short while (which isn&#39;t an<br/>
insult, just any enchanter who was around in the first year of EQs life<br/>
will likely have PLENTY to say on this topic).  <br/>
<br/>
Whirl &#39;til you Hurl (WTYH as it&#39;s more commonly seen) used to be a VERY<br/>
powerful spell.  It was actually one of the few things that made<br/>
enchanters NOT totally suck (enchanters were a HORRIBLE class the first<br/>
few months, they really improved them a lot, but killed a couple of the<br/>
spells along the way).  They thought it was TOO powerful after 6-8 months,<br/>
and tuned it down a lot.  As it is now, it is a variable length single<br/>
target stun.  It lasts from about a second to 15 or so.  It is most<br/>
effective from 16-24ish, but on mobs 24 or higher, it starts to become<br/>
useless, and past 27 or so, it&#39;s completely worthless.<br/>
<br/>
ANY stun breaks it (this includes bashes from your pets, other tanks, etc,<br/>
as well as stun components of wizard spells (the things that cause an<br/>
interrupt) and your own DDs.  The biggest issue is bash, though.<br/>
<br/>
There is an upgrade, Drynn&#39;s Dizzying Draught, but this is THE single most<br/>
useless spell in an enchanters repetoire.  WTYH is actually more useful<br/>
than Drynn&#39;s, even at level 56 (where WTYH is next to useless, but DDD IS<br/>
useless, unless you feel you have too much mana and want to waste it<br/>
pointlessly).<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll get a better version of WTYH at, what, 55?  Lagarn&#39;s Lamentation,<br/>
which is a single target stun for 8 seconds, just like most other classes<br/>
(i.e. clerics) stuns.  Until then, you&#39;ll have to make do with your Area<br/>
Effect stuns at 8, 20, 44, 52, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Root, however, is still a great spell.  As are many in it&#39;s line... you&#39;ll<br/>
find that some of your low level spells stick with you long into your<br/>
upper levels... I STILL almost always have the 16th level Mesmerization<br/>
memorized (the AE mez), at level 56, as well as the level 20 AE stun.<br/>
<br/>
Lower level spells don&#39;t necessarily become obsolete, in some cases they<br/>
are much better than their higher level equivalents.  Root is great,<br/>
because it&#39;s very low mana and resists less at higher levels than the root<br/>
upgrades... I always use either Root or Immobilize... Root for the low<br/>
casting cost and resists, immobilize for the low casting time.  The ONLY<br/>
benefit that I&#39;ve seen from higher level roots is they have less chance to<br/>
break when DD spells hit the creature.  They don&#39;t seem to last longer (in<br/>
fact, my root usually lasts longer than high level root spells), though<br/>
some of the higher ones technically have a slightly longer maximum length,<br/>
because of the greater chance of resists on the higher level ones, they<br/>
break more easily, and rarely reach their maximums, while the low level<br/>
ones usually do.<br/>
<br/>
The low level stuns are good because they cast faster, cost less, resist<br/>
less, and have a smaller radius from you... there are times when a larger<br/>
radius AE stun is good, but overall, that just means more chance of<br/>
attracting attention you wouldn&#39;t have had otherwise... it&#39;s better to<br/>
just learn better placement with a smaller radius.  If I&#39;m chain stunning,<br/>
I&#39;ll load my lvl 20 and lvl 44 AE stuns (and if I really want to be sure,<br/>
the lvl 8 one as well, to fill in the gap).<br/>
<br/>
But remember, overall, lower level spells get resisted less than higher<br/>
level spells (cast by the same caster...  obviously, a lvl 12 enchanter<br/>
casting the lowest root spell will be resisted more than a lvl 60<br/>
enchanter casting the lowest level root spell).  They usually cast faster,<br/>
and often the difference in effect from the lower lvl spell to the higher<br/>
level spell isn&#39;t enough to warrant the costs in mana, time, and resists.<br/>
It is all situational, there are times you&#39;ll want the high ones memmed,<br/>
there are times you&#39;ll want the low ones memmed... I did SO much spell<br/>
juggling... I became a master at AE stunning, sitting down quickly,<br/>
dropping out a spell, memming the spell I need, standing, backing a<br/>
little, and trying to cast it before the stun broke.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters are one of the more interesting classes, I think... there are<br/>
SO many ways to do things, and to handle the same situation... you kind of<br/>
create your own style as you go, and in the end, very few enchanters ever<br/>
react the same to an identical situation.  You do, however, have to be<br/>
unafraid of death.  ;)<br/>
