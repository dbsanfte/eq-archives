<b>Subject:</b> Which spells to use? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-712522445">I&#39;m new to the list and was wondering if any of you could offer me some <br/>
insight on which spells to get at certain levels or which ones to avoid <br/>
(useless spells).  Is there also a list devoted to tracking down where all <br/>
spells are located?<br/>
<br/>
Final question:  Shallow breath seems to be a spell that we begin with.. why <br/>
is it for sale by merchants?  And does it do Damage Over Time or is it a one <br/>
time damage of 4 points or so..?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
