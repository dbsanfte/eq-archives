<div id="ygrps-yiv-969042554">Yeah, not sure if 37 is ok for there or not either, but most of it would be<br/>
blue/white around there I think.  Most of it is green (up to the pool room)<br/>
to me at 54.  There may be some hidden door with more blue, I think there<br/>
is, but to me the only blues I found was past the pool room (the big open<br/>
room with the port to CS).<br/>

What level were you though?  Most of the stuff in Skyshrine are VERY <br/>
hard for their level.  At 37 I&#39;m not sure how well you&#39;d do there...<br/>
<br/>
Stats you listed are for the Guardian Robe- and it is nice =) (but <br/>
ugly as sin - pink and dakrer blue)<br/>
<br/>
Other robe is the Sentry Robe (+11 AC +5 Str +5 Dex +9 Int +20 Mana )<br/>
<br/>
I was wrong below- the robe I should have listed in Charasis is the <br/>
Siren Scale Robe (+10 AC +10 Int +10 vsMg +10vsCold)<br/>
<br/>
There is a couple of robes in the Crystal Caverns that attainable at <br/>
that level (and very nice). Blackened Crystalline Robe (+8 AC +6 Int <br/>
+5 Cha +10 vsCold) is the easier and looks like the PoF Necro robe.  <br/>
the harder one comes off the Queen, and is called the Crystalline <br/>
Robes (+10 AC +2 Agi +6 Int +5 vsMg +10 vsCold +10 Mana).  Both very <br/>
nice.<br/>
<br/>
Course, the Sarnak Arcane Fetish is a fairly common drop, so it wont <br/>
be too expensive, and the robes I listed below are fairly easy to get <br/>
in trade items once the other people upgrade.  Lots of SMRs and FBCRs <br/>
available for pp (although SMRs are still somewhat pricey due to the <br/>
fact they are used in several epic quests).<br/>
<br/>

cant<br/>
&gt; remember if its the sentry or guardian I got mine after about 8 <br/>
hours of<br/>
&gt; helping my brothers group kill stuff.  I have warmly faction there <br/>
and I<br/>
&gt; would pull with slow to the group then blur.  The robe is 12ac 8int <br/>
45mana 5<br/>
&gt; stamina 8vs magic and cold or heat cant remember.  weight 0.0  Also <br/>
its all<br/>
&gt; classes and most races.  Although it is no-drop.<br/>

&gt; Okay, but she&#39;s a level 37 chanter- so unless she has some friends <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; high places, her chanter is an alt., or she&#39;s one heck of a trader, <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s not going to have access to some of this stuff.  In order <br/>
&gt; to contribute to the raid as an enchanter, you need to be:<br/>
&gt; -EBoots 44<br/>
&gt; -Sarnak Arcain Fetish 46-50<br/>
&gt; -Robe of the Foci 50-51 (if this is the HS robe- can&#39;t remember what <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s called)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The rest you should be able to get by fighting stuff your level or <br/>
&gt; below.  If this is how you normally play the game, here are some <br/>
&gt; recommendations for alternate equipment:<br/>
&gt; 1. Neck- Plat Saphire Necklace (7int 7str)<br/>
&gt; 2. Head- Nightshade wreath (1ac 5int 5 wis)<br/>
&gt; 3. Shoulders (embroidered black cape is a shoulder slot item, not <br/>
&gt; back)- Mantle of Mirth (2 int 2 wis shoulder item from droga, can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; remember the rest of the stats)<br/>
&gt; 4. Back- Mystic Cloak (listed in shoulder slot) or Molten Cloak<br/>
&gt; 5. Feet- Wolf Fur Slippers (just +mana, but no real upgrades until <br/>
&gt; EBoots)<br/>
&gt; 6. Robe- Should be able to have at least a Oracle. Dalnir, SMR, <br/>
FBCR, <br/>
&gt; Robe of the Foci are all upgrades.<br/>
