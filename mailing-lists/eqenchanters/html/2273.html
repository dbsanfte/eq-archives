<div id="ygrps-yiv-376063317">Solo hunting? Lavastorm is ok, you can hunt near Najena and zone if you have<br/>
a problem. Don&#39;t know how much gear you have, as you hit the harder things<br/>
you&#39;ll need a magic weapon. Yard trash in Unrest is also very good at this<br/>
level, there&#39;s about 6 spawn spots inside the maze just past the fountains<br/>
where you will be off the tracks. I think the regular aviaks (not the<br/>
guards) in front of the Arena in Lake Rathe should be ok, though they may be<br/>
too low. There&#39;s also a lizard man camp in Rathe Mountains (one outrunner<br/>
and 2 in camp). The Southern Ro dervish camps have an outrunner at each that<br/>
you can go back and forth between or join a group doing one of the camps<br/>
(the east one is preferable, there&#39;s a safe area near the grass where you<br/>
can pull to and no ghouls or dry bones will wander through). The solo dervs<br/>
may spawn a little tough on occasion, but you can kite those using fear.<br/>
Might be able to do the orc camp in misty thicket, not sure exactly how high<br/>
they are, but level 10-12 I think. If you can get  4 or 5 people together,<br/>
the orc camps in Rathe Mountains are great experience and loot. There&#39;s all<br/>
my good spots (good as in loot, experience, and rarely occupied).<br/>

&gt; I am level 12 and looking for some good hunting grounds, I think I&#39;m gunna<br/>
&gt; try lavastorm today so I&#39;ll see how that goes.  But where was everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; favorite hunting grounds at level 12?<br/>
