The following entry and related article can be found on EQVault today.  Note<br/>
the quote at the end.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Upcoming Enchanter Additions <br/>
EverQuest Enchanters got the lowdown from Verant Interactive&#39;s Geoffrey<br/>
Zatkin about upcoming additions and fixes to the Enchanter class. Here&#39;s<br/>
what will be updated: <br/>
Alliance will be upgraded possibly in next Mondays Update <br/>
A new Whirl Till You Hurl 2 spell is becoming available for us on Monday for<br/>
use on creatures 30 + which will be more effective on them. <br/>
Avoid using any spell which causes stun whilst Whirling (CF, SW, Swarm,<br/>
etc). Apparently next Monday the patch is going to reduce the chance of bash<br/>
and stun breaking Whirl. For now though you may want to stick to rooting or<br/>
DoT - Kiting if you can get a SoW. <br/>
Only Monsters of Level 30+ should have got the increased save against Blur. <br/>
This quote &quot;Enchanters are tricky, because of the power of their spells. At<br/>
high levels they are SO deadly that we are having to tone down some of their<br/>
spells.&quot; The Rune series of spells will now also provide AC bonus as well as<br/>
HP absorption. They will stack with haze series. <br/>
