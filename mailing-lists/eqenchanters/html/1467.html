<b>Subject:</b> Resistance after patch and what to do <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757862987">Might I suggest sending Veriant emails, sending feedback ingame, and even<br/>
petitioning about this, it has been unannounced, therefor a bug in my book.<br/>
Even if they intended in this change, it should be changed back. It&#39;s<br/>
insane green mob&#39;s should resist at all, let alone what we deal with after<br/>
the patch. So let them know, tell em you want it the way it was. <br/>
FYI, they also reduced the damage (to mana) from mana sieve GREATLY! Before<br/>
the patch, it would totally drain a lvl 39 wizard to out of mana. Now, it<br/>
takes a total of 4 cast to do the same. Also, the effect would last 3 to 5<br/>
min. preventing them from meditating in that time. Now they can meditate<br/>
right off. Once again, these changes were not announced, therefor a bug and<br/>
if not, it should be changed back to the way it was, or least made stronger<br/>
than it is after the patch.<br/>
