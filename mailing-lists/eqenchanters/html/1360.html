<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046830399">It&#39;s awfully quiet out there today....you must have all had a good weekend,<br/>
like I did....raised my jeweling skill from 22 to 38 over the past<br/>
week....any other success stories?  Is that a normal rate?<br/>
<br/>
Working with jade and pearl now....the pearl rings are a hard sell...even<br/>
at 12pp each..<br/>
<br/>
i noticed a lot of jewelers selling their wares for a lower cost then<br/>
mine...seems like I&#39;m getting cut....I&#39;ve been selling for about twice the<br/>
cost of materials...seems like a fair rule for prices (considering all the<br/>
factors and costs involved in getting skill high enough to even work with<br/>
the better stones)....but I saw a few people selling jade rings for<br/>
6pp???!!!!   Ouch!  10pp is what I&#39;ve been selling them for.....and until<br/>
someone auctions a lower price, I had no problem getting that price.   It<br/>
pains me greatly to see it happen...so I politely ask the vendors to raise<br/>
the selling price a little....<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
