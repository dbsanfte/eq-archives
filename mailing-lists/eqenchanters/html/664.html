Basically, as far as fractions go, if it&#39;s not aggerssive to you, and has<br/>
two leggs, chances are it&#39;ll mess your fraction up.  Good news is you gotta<br/>
kill TONS of em to actually screw it up. Bad news is, some are aggressive<br/>
and will still mess you fraction up, as well, being Enchanters and wanting<br/>
to keep in the good w/ all races, it&#39;s best to avoid anything of that sort. <br/>
