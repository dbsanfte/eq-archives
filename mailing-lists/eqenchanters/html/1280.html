<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054635070">Mine are close to that, but I was a bit lower on the silver stuff.<br/>
plus 2 silver, from 4plat to 6plat each<br/>
Jade rings 10plat<br/>
electrum jade on my server goes at a steady 20pp. Everyone just sticks<br/>
with that.<br/>
Also, WIS earings last night were a big seller. I sold about 20 of them,<br/>
at aroudn 8 to 10 pp each. They cost about 4 to make I think.<br/>

&gt; We need to start a dialog about what we are going to sell the new<br/>
&gt; jewellery<br/>
&gt; items for. I guess I will open up by stating what I was selling things<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; last night, and then all of you can comment as to whether it was too<br/>
&gt; high or<br/>
&gt; too low, and we will work from there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	All +2 silver stat boosters : 7p each or 2 for 13p<br/>
&gt; 	Jade silver rings : 9p each or 2 for 17p<br/>
&gt; 	Jade electrum bracers : 25p each or 2 for 45p<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This being only the 2nd day after the patch, I haven&#39;t tried marketing<br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; of the electrum items other than the obvious seller, which is the jade<br/>
&gt; bracer. With a skill of 79 I still get failures with electrum, and I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; trying to repay the guild for the money they pumped into me to raise<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; skill. Please add to this list and comment on prices!<br/>
