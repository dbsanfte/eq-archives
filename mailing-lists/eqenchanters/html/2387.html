<b>Subject:</b> Illusions- Why and Why not <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633477849">Hello...<br/>
   I have found that illusions work in conjunction with faction. For instance I&#39;m a gnome enchantress, my faction in steamfont and ak&#39;anon can go no higher and I&#39;ve found that no matter what form I take, skeleton or ogre, I&#39;m still amiable with everyone. I&#39;ve tried every form from lvl one to 24 and it never changers. I&#39;ve also found you can get the nest prices by using race illusion, benevolence, and charisma buff. I have tested this in many cities checking to make sure it was right. I&#39;ve also found that in some places no matter what you do you can&#39;t change you&#39;re faction at all with spells. Go to different zones and play around you&#39;ll see what I mean. Here&#39;s an example; in oasis at the inn I was attacked and I was in gnome form and the keeper did nothing, so I changed into human, he still did nothing, I cast benevolence on him, he then attacked the offend creature. I did this as part of my test, it was a low green so I wasn&#39;t worried but I think you kind of get what I&#39;m talking about....<br/>
