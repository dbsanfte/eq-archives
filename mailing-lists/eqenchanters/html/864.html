<b>Subject:</b> Weird thing that happens when I cast mesmorize <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-394362937">Previously when I casted it, the monster would just stand and no other monsters would react.<br/>
<br/>
Recently though, when I cast it and there are other monsters around, they come running while the mesmorized one just stands there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know why that happens?<br/>
