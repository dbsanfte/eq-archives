<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410628888">hi, <br/>
  I have a 30th level enchanter galadriana . mes uses conjuration as does <br/>
casting your pet.. i never used my pet much as there was no need for it <br/>
really.. but at 29 when i got group mes, much to my surprise, my conjuration <br/>
skills were so low, from never using it, that mes fizzled almost every time, <br/>
so now when i get time i just go to a safe area and mes everything in sight <br/>
to get my conjuration skills up.. so my advice it to cast your pet and your <br/>
mes as much as possible, so when you get higher and need the group mes spell <br/>
in order to fight in a dungeon or wherever, it will work and not fizzle, <br/>
because it can cost alot of lives if the timings not good and you fizzle <br/>
alot... <br/>
