&lt;&lt; The deal quite frankly is thsi. I can&#39;t play with my friends because theya<br/>
 re all outleveling me. When theya re online I play with them even though<br/>
 theya re 3-4 levles ahead of me and even though sometimes I am zero use to<br/>
 them because none of my spells stick. When they are offline I cannot findany<br/>
 groups to play so I am stuck attempting to solo which is incredibly slow and<br/>
 dangerous too.  This is the Second Wave of friends that has out leveled me.  <br/>

but allof my friends are 16 so now i cant hardly fight at all</div>
