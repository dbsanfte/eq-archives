<div id="ygrps-yiv-607407538">Howdy folks,<br/>
<br/>
Here is a list of items (along with my thoughts on them) Veriant have<br/>
opened for discussion on the PvP form of there web page. I&#39;d like to get<br/>
your thoughts about them, and possibly you could jot over and see what&#39;s<br/>
going on.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Experience loss on all deaths. Pro: Would give naked mage/monks<br/>
something to lose. Would open some strategies that are<br/>
    currently illegal (e.g. Snare the kiting druid). Con: Raises some<br/>
harassment issues with zone/bindpoint camping.<br/>
<br/>
           You&#39;ve got to be kidding?! I&#39;ve played +pvp since P4 beta, and<br/>
I&#39;ve never herd such a bad idea! How about making AC/HP/Saves worth more<br/>
with equipment? There is NO WAY to prevent bind killing, there are many<br/>
more reason why this is just totally unacceptable, I think that one is enough.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Binding in city-only for all classes. Pro: Should cut down on<br/>
bind-rushing. Con: Might upset casters a bit.<br/>
<br/>
	Uhhh, I thought this was just the opposite of what you were looking at<br/>
doing. Either way, taking away from one group to help<br/>
&quot;balance&quot; another group is just wrong. I think we&#39;re all willing to wait<br/>
for a true course of action to help resolve this, do it right<br/>
Veriant, no shortcuts please, I think we&#39;ve put up with enough of your<br/>
shortcut solutions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. &quot;Sick and Tired&quot;. Make people come back from death with the<br/>
&quot;Ressurection effect&quot;. roughly 50% hitpoints and zero mana. Pro:<br/>
Should eliminate the emainder of bind-rushing. Con: Would be a pain for<br/>
people who are fighting PvE at the time.<br/>
<br/>
	WOW A good idea! Sides, it would help increase the need for healer classes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. Changing loot to coin-only. Pro: Should make melee classes feel more at<br/>
ease. Con: Could make it very difficult for people to<br/>
obtain items from unfriendly areas. <br/>
<br/>
	Once again, your not thinking! You&#39;ve got to be nuts to go forward with<br/>
those one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5. Changeing loot to any item, in bag or otherwise. Though I still think<br/>
the casters come out on top of this one, I believe there is a<br/>
pretty large technology hurdle that has to be overcome for this to be<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
	What? Is Verant becoming a kool dood now? Frankly, I think allowing<br/>
looting of any kind needs to go. There are WAY too many ppl who dont have<br/>
the time to earn those items back, espically with the way you&#39;ve got the<br/>
system now. Once again, this is a VERY bad idea.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6. /CON. Making so that anyone above the level limit cons RED, anyone below<br/>
cons GREEN, and anyone in it cons<br/>
WHITE/BLACK.<br/>
<br/>
	Uhhhh, isn&#39;t this the way it works now? Pfffttt, either way, how about<br/>
just letting the user configure his /con, would be VERY easy to do, and<br/>
it&#39;d make everyone happy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	A side note for all servers, not just +PvP...Dont give faction hits for<br/>
NPC&#39;s that do not exist. A good example of this was<br/>
Shadowmen and the Temple of Ro, and currently even much longer, Heretic&#39;s<br/>
and Erudin. I think many many of us would of not<br/>
killed this or that if we knew what faction 420 was going to effect (or<br/>
whatever the number was). Painel (?) is another example,<br/>
many players have horid factions with Heretics&#39; completly unknowing we wont<br/>
be able to enter there city, yet to come.<br/>
