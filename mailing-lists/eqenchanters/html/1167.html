<b>Subject:</b> Enchanting items and recharging them LONG <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-804812201">Recently there has been some talk on the worthlesness of trade skills, specificaly Jewelry.  I couldn&#39;t agree more.  It costs me 6 plat to make a Jade ring, failing about half the time, so about 12plat per ring.  No one I know is willing to pay that for +5 mana.  I sure wouldn&#39;t.  Some suggestions have been to increase the effect.  I agree completely.  A better recent suggestion is to allow us to enchant magical spells into them.  This is a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
We already know some items in the game have charges.  We also just lost 2 spells, ench of brilliance and another similar spell.  If I cant go to a temple to have rabies cured after a battle with a mummy, but need to seek out the services of a PC cleric, why should other players not do the same thing for enchanters.  Let us have recharge spells in place of the ones we lost. <br/>
<br/>
In conjunction with this, allow us to make jewelry with one of the components being a scroll.  How many charges the item would have could be dependant upon the type of metal used.  1 for silver, 2 for electrum, etc.  It might be nice for a fighter to have a gate spell in a ring.  Silver, gem, scroll, and occasional failures could bring the cost of makeing such an item up to maybe 10 plat or so.  I played a fighter once who would have payed 15plat for a one time gate chance, when he was injured deep in a dungeon and all his party dead or gated.  There are 4 spaces in our jewelry kit, so even a spell that required components could have a component added to the recipe.  A levitate might be nice.<br/>
<br/>
Now I dont presume to say all spells should be able to be made into magic items.  Lets not give fighters pet spells anymore than we should get double attack.  If recharging is too powerful and makes magic too prevalent, let the item dissapear after its charges are gone.  That would increase demand on products.  <br/>
<br/>
Once again, for all I know, maybe this is already possible.  But if so, I haven&#39;t seen any books stating it.  All I know is that I have spent over 60 plat on a skill that I wouldn&#39;t even be willing to pay cost on an item I can make, much less pay enough to cover failures and profit.  Just an idea if anyone cares.</div>
