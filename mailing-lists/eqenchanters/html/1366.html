<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466073550">man, you guys are charging way to little for the rings of +2!!!<br/>
they cost us about 6pp to make one ring, and your going and selling for 6pp<br/>
or 7pp!<br/>
i sell mine for 12pp for 1 and 20pp for a set of 2!!<br/>
and they sell.<br/>
if i sell at your prices, and fail once, i am loosing money. do not bring<br/>
the market down, bring it up!</div>
