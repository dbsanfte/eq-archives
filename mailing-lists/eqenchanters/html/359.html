<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594413225">BUG ALERT!<br/>
<br/>
If you drop a bag containing items on the ground it vanishes. This was a<br/>
bug in beta and initial release. Verant claimed to have fixed this bug<br/>
once after the initial release, but I tried after they claimed to have<br/>
&quot;fixed&quot; the bug and it was still broke. I have not tried recently.<br/>
Frankly I don&#39;t want to lose another backpack<br/>

You can transfer items between two (or more) of your characters by one<br/>
of<br/>
two ways.  Note, some consider this twinking and a bad thing.  You can<br/>
use a<br/>
friend as a go between or just find an out of the way spot like a room<br/>
at an<br/>
inn.  Bring both of your charcters there.  Then have one character drop<br/>
the<br/>
goodies on the floor.  Quickly camp and bring your other character on<br/>
and<br/>
pick up the items.  If more than one item you can just drop them all on<br/>
the<br/>
ground (usually shows as one little bag but they&#39;re all there) or put in<br/>
container and drop container.  Not sure how long items dropped hang<br/>
around<br/>
but they do hang around long enough to make a switch of characters.<br/>
Down<br/>
side is if someone comes by and sees the bag on the ground while you&#39;re<br/>
in<br/>
between characters, they may help themselves to it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that you can give /consent to a player not currently in the<br/>
game,<br/>
making the possibility of having one of your characters loot another of<br/>
your<br/>
character&#39;s corpse.  I don&#39;t know if this is possible or not.<br/>
