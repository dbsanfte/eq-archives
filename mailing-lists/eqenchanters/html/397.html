<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409215414">Actuallly, from what I heard, our 32nd level friend was able<br/>
to kill the MOB by charming mammoths, sending them in, and <br/>
when they would die, cast whirl-til-you-hurl to keep the baddie<br/>
in place, then get another mammoth. I don&#39;t think he got up<br/>
close and personal with the MOB...<br/>
<br/>
About the illusion, I don&#39;t know...<br/>

&gt; Hail,<br/>
&gt; I read the post below about our 32nd level friend taking on a level 40 MOB<br/>
&gt; by using the illusion &quot;Fire elemental&quot; and was hitting for 80+ points.  I<br/>
&gt; have also noticed that when I cast the illusion Human ( I am a High Elf )<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; lose my ability to see in the dark.  With these observations in hand, am I<br/>
&gt; right to assume that we gain the abilities of our illusion as well?  I am<br/>
&gt; curious to know if my Wood-elf illusion will give me the ability to<br/>
&gt; &quot;forage&quot;.  It may be far fetched, but I have not seen anything being<br/>
&gt; discussed on this matter anywhere, &#39;cept for the brief mention of being a<br/>
&gt; Fire elemental.  Any input and thoughts on this matter would be greatly<br/>
&gt; appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am<br/>
&gt; Tovan<br/>
