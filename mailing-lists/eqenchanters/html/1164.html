<div id="ygrps-yiv-207133044">I have found the best method to blacksmithing is to max the amount of skill<br/>
points it will let you put in.  I believe this is to skill 24.  The first<br/>
thing you will want to start making is scalers and do so until you begin to<br/>
get the message this is too trivial for you.  Then move on to lantern molds<br/>
and when trivial move on to skewers.  Skewers will max out at around 115 or<br/>
could be 124 cant remember for sure.  If you are wanting to make banded<br/>
armor before then I would not try until you have around 80 skill.  At 80<br/>
skill the only 2 items I would attempt would be bracers and gorgets.  The<br/>
rest of the banded pieces wait till your at your skewer max, unless your not<br/>
worried about cost then begin at around 100 skill.  The best places to do<br/>
this is if you are in the gfay area do it at akanon in the steamfront zone;<br/>
if on the other continent do it in Freeport.  Count on you cost to reaching<br/>
the point where you are maxed on skewers to be around 150 - 200pp.<br/>
