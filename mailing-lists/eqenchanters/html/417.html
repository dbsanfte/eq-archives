<div id="ygrps-yiv-923451309">ok, i can help ya here, sorta. i came from qeynos to freeport, going<br/>
through highpass hold.<br/>
<br/>
you go up to east karana, i usually followed the coast in the plains<br/>
because i went that way to SplitPaw. when you get to the first bridge, the<br/>
one that takes you to the zone with splitpaw, dont take that bridge. <br/>
<br/>
follow the river to the second bridge. be careful of raiders that gather on<br/>
the coasts, they may con blue to you but they travel in large packs. when<br/>
you reach the second bridge(you willknow it&#39;s the right bridge, it is<br/>
fairly impressively built), cross it- you will zone. this is where if you<br/>
arent bad ass, you should cast invis on yourself. do NOT stop to fight<br/>
anything if you are below lvl 12. i suggest if you have bind, bind yourself<br/>
to this bridge, in case you die.<br/>
<br/>
over the bridge, past a farm on your right (keep it on your right), there<br/>
is a path. follow that path till you hit a valley. watch out for griffs and<br/>
other baddies.<br/>
<br/>
take the higher road (to the right) of the valley and follow it AAAALLLLL<br/>
the way to highpass hold. once you get into highpass hold, i beleive i<br/>
tried to stay to the left as much as possible trying to get around the<br/>
highpass maze. eventually you will get to highkeep, and inside there in one<br/>
of the rooms is someone selling all the animation spells.<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps.<br/>

&gt;ARGH! What is with you people???? Do you think that all enchanters <br/>
&gt;come from freeport??? Your directions for the 8th lvl animation spell <br/>
&gt;work only for the people that come from the freeport direction! What <br/>
&gt;about people from Qeynos and Erudin? They come from North (or east, <br/>
&gt;they are all the same) karanas, which helps us in no way at ALL.<br/>
