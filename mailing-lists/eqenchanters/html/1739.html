<div id="ygrps-yiv-589009747">I used memory blur for the first time last night and I have some questions.<br/>
<br/>
My party and I decided to try and tackle a hill giant. With all of us having<br/>
SoW and me having Memory Blur (MB) we didn&#39;t think we&#39;d have a problem, even<br/>
though we are all low-mid 20&#39;s. Well, we couldn&#39;t touch that hill giant with<br/>
spells even after my tashani. The tank was hysterical and wouldn&#39;t run close<br/>
enough for me to get off a MB to get the giant off him. In the end, everyone<br/>
but me zoned, so the hill giant comes straight for me. I start pushing the<br/>
MB key... Target out of range!... Target out of range!... You begin to cast<br/>
a spell.... A hill giant blinks. The hill giant then changed direction and<br/>
went about his merry way. Cool!<br/>
<br/>
Now that we know we can&#39;t take a hill giant, and bolstered by our experience<br/>
with the hill giant (noone died), we decided to try a griffon. This one<br/>
didn&#39;t go nearly as well. The griffon turned out to be just as magic<br/>
resistant as the hill giant, and a LOT faster. After unsuccessfully trying<br/>
our spells, the call went out for MB. The tank ran the griff near me and I<br/>
cast MB. A griffon blinks. Problem was, it kept chasing the tank! The tank<br/>
didn&#39;t like that news so he kept running for the zone. I chased him a bit to<br/>
try and get another cast of MB off. I guess at that point I was closer to<br/>
the griffon than the tank because it turned for me.<br/>
<br/>
You begin to cast a spell.<br/>
A griffon claws you for 96 points of damage!<br/>

You keep your concentration and finish the spell! (don&#39;t know how...)<br/>
A griffin blinks.<br/>
A griffon claws you for 78 points of damage!<br/>

You have been slain by a griffon!<br/>
<br/>
The question I have is, what is the correct way to use MB? Apparently, it<br/>
wipes the hate list, but if you are in the critter&#39;s aggro radius the<br/>
critter will just jump you again. Anyone have any strategies to share in<br/>
using Memory Blur?</div>
