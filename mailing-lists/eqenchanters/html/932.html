<b>Subject:</b> Enchanter Update? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-715320100">I know that they havemad changes to the Enchanter Class but What exactly have they changed. I have not noticed any changes as of yet and I am just wodering if all the debate and talk of strking is because people just don&#39;t like change or if it is actually as bad as people are saying. I have no problem protesting if I believe the change was not for good. I would really appreciate a run down on what they have changed. Someone made referance to spells that were weekened. What did the spell do before the update and what does it do now?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
