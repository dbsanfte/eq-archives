<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127637685">I watched every attempt. It never showed a skill increase. Make more? I<br/>
have no more money until I sell some Jade Rings for 8p each. I don&#39;t<br/>
wont to waste the money though if I&#39;m not going to get skill<br/>
improvements. I already put 40p plus sell back money into it to get to<br/>
37. Then I put another 70p without sell back money and got nothing.<br/>
That&#39;s too weird. It&#39;s kind of disappointing. I don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
Maybe I need to level some more. <br/>

Jewelcraft is not broken.  You can get up to skill 40 with jade before<br/>
it becomes trivial.  Perhaps it went up and you didn&#39;t notice?  Maybe<br/>
you just need to make some more.  :)<br/>
<br/>
The going rate for Jaded Silver rings sold to PCs is 8P, don&#39;t<br/>
undersell them or you&#39;ll ruin the business for all of us.  Sometimes I<br/>
give a 1P discount to people who buy 2.  And selling to your friends is<br/>
an all together different story anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It cost me probably 50 P to get to skill 40.,  that&#39;s 50 P earned from<br/>
monsters, not including sell back money.  I&#39;ve had some serious bad<br/>
luck streaks.  lots of failures with jade and pearl.<br/>
