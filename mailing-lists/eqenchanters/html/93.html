<div id="ygrps-yiv-765881630">I hate to break it to you, but even GZ (spell guy at Verant) has stated that<br/>
you will not see much effect with Alliance and that only the higher level<br/>
versions would give a noticeable effect. So basically, this spell *IS*<br/>
worthless. It DOES work (i.e. you see it say &quot;so-and-so seems more<br/>
friendly,&quot; but it&#39;s effect is so minimal to non-existent that it is just not<br/>
worth the money. I have never seen a change in price. I guess if you were on<br/>
the cusp of a faction change, it might put you over by that last single<br/>
&quot;point&quot; of faction that is needed, but in practice this is pointless. Don&#39;t<br/>
waste the money.<br/>
