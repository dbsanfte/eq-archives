<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253590739">actually, from what i have seen and heard, the highkeep gaurds are friendly<br/>
to dark elves. and, if you go to qeynos and kill jracol brestiage (a dark<br/>
elf that hangs out in front of the city), your faction with all of highpass<br/>
goes down (if you kill him 2 or 3 times, you can go to highkeep,t hey&#39;ll<br/>
kill you on sight).<br/>

&gt;I strongly advise you do not try using dark elf illusions in high hold for 2<br/>
&gt;reasons....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  Your probably only L8 and wont see it for another 4 levels <br/>
&gt;2.  The guards kill dark elves on sight I believe, and they are much worse<br/>
&gt;than the orcs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You were the victim of bad luck, i have made the trip with several L8<br/>
&gt;characters (and a L4 one once before the animations were added locally)and<br/>
&gt;have never had an orc see through my invisibility.  I have had it wear off,<br/>
&gt;but was able to run to the guards and survive.<br/>
