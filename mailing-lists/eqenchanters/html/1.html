<div id="ygrps-yiv-79081824">Hail!  <br/>
<br/>
I am named Cogg, and am a 7th level enchanter who resides on the Rallos Zek<br/>
server in my home town of Ak-Anon.  I have recently discovered that my most<br/>
needed spell, enchant silver, is located in Neriak, home to the frightening<br/>
dark elves!  Can anyone give me some suggestions as to how to get this spell?<br/>
<br/>
I have been jewelmaking since level2, and have achieved quite a high rate<br/>
of success with more advanced jewelry.  My skill is not great, but one<br/>
thing I have noticed is that I seem to have more success if I am sitting at<br/>
a chair with a table in front of me.  Does this bode true for you as well?<br/>
<br/>
