<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620700276">I&#39;ve had griffs fly right over me before.  Bad feeling when you hear<br/>
woosh woosh woosh over you.  I think it was extreme luck I didn&#39;t die<br/>
(wasn&#39;t invis with that char).  So I&#39;m guessing it was dumb luck not<br/>
inviso but who knows?<br/>

Ive walked under many griffins invisible.  Its possible some come with<br/>
the ability to see invisible, but I do not believe it to be the norm.  I<br/>
suppose I should use more caution in the future just incase.  I guess<br/>
now that I have my skills up, and invis is fairly reliable, I go a<br/>
little overboard on taking risks.<br/>

Griffins and some other creatures besides undead can see invisible PC&#39;s<br/>
do<br/>
not trust your invisibility to always work agains every creature. I<br/>
found<br/>
out the same way about Grifiins as you did. And i know that undead can<br/>
see<br/>
you if your invisible unless you have invisibility to undead. but,<br/>
invisibilty is not the best way to travel.<br/>

&gt; I gave up a level 16 dark-elf necro because their invisibility spell (<br/>
&gt; gather shadows ) was very unreliable. One sad evening, coming back<br/>
 from a<br/>
&gt; very long quest that brought me to Kerra Island and South Karana, I<br/>
got<br/>
&gt; hacked multiple times in Riverdale losing about 4 bubs of xp because<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; invis wore off on me randomly. I got really pissed off that at level<br/>
16, I<br/>
&gt; could not manage to cast a level 8 spell reliably and decided to start<br/>
&gt; another character more appropriate for travelling since I was very<br/>
much<br/>
into<br/>
&gt; research and quests.<br/>
&gt; With my enchantress, I got invisibility at level 4 and used it some<br/>
times.<br/>
&gt; It always seemed to work great but I might be wrong. Yesterday, I<br/>
found<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; that this invisibility spell is as bad as gather shadows as a %$#%^^%$<br/>
&gt; griffin nuked me a few seconds after I cast invisibility. Since then,<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; noticed the same kind on unreliability...but only since I made level<br/>
8...I<br/>
&gt; might be wrong.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I would like to know how&#39;s the enchanter&#39;s invisibility like<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; level 16 or 20 or more. CAN YOU COUNT ON IT?<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Skara, the pissed-off dark-elf Necro from Fennin-Ro<br/>
&gt; now known as Skara, the enchantress from Innoruuk<br/>
