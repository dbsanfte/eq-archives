<div id="ygrps-yiv-876144978">I have gotten the scrolls off of only on spawn location in CrushBone, the<br/>
Oracle in the side entrance of the castle, and I have received good returns<br/>
for giving these scrolls to him, A large lantern worth over 2gp&#39;s, a medium<br/>
wooden shield worth over 8 gp&#39;s,  I was only able to get 2 of them out of<br/>
maybe 6-7 oracles, but they are there, you also get some small amount of<br/>
cash and some exp. for them.  Hehe, being a enchanter has it&#39;s advantages<br/>
though, just tell your group if they aren&#39;t familiar with the quest that you<br/>
*NEED* the scrolls off of this MOB, hehe, they will usually give it to ya.<br/>
