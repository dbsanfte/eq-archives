<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-595196927">The perfect enchanting item spell can be taken from a MUD I used to play<br/>
on.  It is ALWAYS useful, has a limited duration, and is a constant<br/>
supply of income.<br/>
<br/>
Featherweight:<br/>
High mana cost(150 or so)<br/>
20th level or so.<br/>
<br/>
Reduces the weight of an item it is cast upon by 1/2.  Lasts until the<br/>
player with the item logs off.  Item has to be in the enchanter&#39;s hand<br/>
to have the spell cast upon it.<br/>
<br/>
People would pay out the wazoo for this, and once you had a loyal<br/>
customer, they wouldn&#39;t go anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can you featherweight my rubicite, total stranger?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wanting this one for a while.<br/>
