<b>Subject:</b> Re: on training past jade/silver and some other stuff <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-34303467">just a quick question, I was oninions or stats (if anyone has kept track or<br/>
tested it)  ,<br/>
<br/>
If I am at 40 jewelcraft, and want to train higher (only so I dont fail so<br/>
much on Jade...) will it be cheaper to train with the next stone (pearl I<br/>
think) and silver at 6 plat or so per attemptor with electrum and malachite<br/>
(or whatever the cheapest stone is) withc would run about 2plat 5 gold per<br/>
attempt I guess what I am asking when it comes down to it...will failures<br/>
with a stone that is out of my league raise my skill? and how far outta my<br/>
league is that first gem and electrum.<br/>
<br/>
on a side note...anyone have  a list or know a site that has the points at<br/>
which all the blacksmithing items become trivial?<br/>
