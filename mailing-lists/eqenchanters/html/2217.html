<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748220640">The last patch had decreased casting times for all the higher level spells<br/>
like Enthrall.   Check out Baelish&#39;s sight for more details on exactly what<br/>
the patch did for you.<br/>

 PATCH DAY<br/>
Patch Day again and some nice improvements including increased loot drops in<br/>
the planes, and an improvement for Enchanters with 2.5 second casting times<br/>
for all mesmerise series spells.<br/>
<br/>
The screaming terror bug causing 20 second full stuns has been fixed, and a<br/>
tad-late announcement about guards being buffed up has finally come forth.<br/>

&gt; Lately enthrall seems to have a much faster recast time.  I jus turned 32<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; I dont know if that has anything to do with it, but it went from a 5<br/>
second<br/>
&gt; recharge to a one second recharge.  Can anyone else confirm this?<br/>
