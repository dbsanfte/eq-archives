<div id="ygrps-yiv-96649593">To learn different languages, simply group with players of different<br/>
races. Each of you set your language to that of your specific race<br/>
(Halfling, Dark Elf, Thieves Cant, etc.). Then just group chat and<br/>
you&#39;ll start learning the languages. You&#39;ll get messages that state your<br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
This is great for those long boat rides.<br/>

WOW THANKS!  This is great information.  Would I have seen any of these<br/>
so far in my normal travels or are they stashed away some where?  I&#39;m<br/>
saving your message into my keep folder.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My friend told me he heard some texts are written in a foreign language<br/>
and you have to learn it somehow before you can understand.  He<br/>
mentioned needing to hear the language spoken once to understand and<br/>
that you sometimes would need to seek out an exotic creature that spoke<br/>
that language.  Not sure if rumor or conjecture but I thought I&#39;d offer<br/>
anyway.<br/>

We have 3 &quot;books&quot; that I have found, two are actually containers, and<br/>
they<br/>
are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1&gt; Book of Ancient Restoration - This has two slots for restoring<br/>
damaged<br/>
pages.<br/>
2&gt; Tome of Endless Enchantments - This is the thing to use for spell<br/>
research. You put in a page (or two for some spells), a parchment and a<br/>
quill and combine.<br/>
3&gt; The End of an Age - this is our &quot;recipe&quot; book. Basically it states<br/>
that<br/>
we need to assemble the tomes of several members of an ancient circle of<br/>
Keepers of the Craft. Two of which are Tasarian and Velishoul.<br/>

&gt; When I had my level 16 necro, I started some research ( barely<br/>
&gt; really ) and<br/>
&gt; went to the multiple guilds to buy some books. I&#39;ve noticed then that<br/>

&gt; 2...or maybe 3..not sure. Do we have less research ability or are our<br/>
