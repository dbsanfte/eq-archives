<div id="ygrps-yiv-273758535">It has been a while since I posted to this list due to <br/>
RL activities, but...<br/>
<br/>
I would look at the Enchant Item as a very easy spell to <br/>
implement if you made it a temp, group only effect as <br/>
with Invisibility.  Make it a fixed duration as with <br/>
Haze and Minor Shielding so it will last at least as <br/>
long as one *long* fight.  Another limitation would be <br/>
to have the effect cancelled when you log off.  That way <br/>
you will not have a flood of magic items, and newbies <br/>
will not be able to even think of taking on a magic only <br/>
creature.  Make it a Research only spell (therefore 16th <br/>
level).<br/>
Another thought is to make it more than one spell and <br/>
spread it over several levels starting at 16th like the <br/>
illusion line.<br/>
Weapon of Speed at 16th; Weapon of Acuracy at 20th; <br/>
Weapon of Might at 24th, Weapon of &lt;Suffocating Sphere&gt; <br/>
at 30th, etc.<br/>
Make them stackable, Divination, and high mana cost <br/>
(start at 120 per cast for the 16th rank spell).<br/>
This will make them available, wanted, but not abused.<br/>
I would not be willing to cast a high mana burn spell on <br/>
someone if they are not in my group, and I will not <br/>
group with a newbie just to cast this.  If you do, you <br/>
are asking for any newbie to petition you constantly, or <br/>
any level for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 Plat.<br/>
