&gt; <br/>
&gt; I aggree with this protest.  I have been getting<br/>
&gt; frustrated with the Enchanters myself though I still<br/>
&gt; play them.  Verant wants this to be a team game the<br/>
&gt; only problem is (which I run into alot) is that how<br/>
&gt; are we suppose to team and fight things that are a<br/>
&gt; challenge?  When I am in a group and we fight<br/>
&gt; something red I become useless I can&#39;t cast on them<br/>
&gt; so I have to go in and tank with everyone else and<br/>
&gt; have my pet help me at times.  If this is how I<br/>
&gt; wanted to play I would play a Shadow Knight.  I have<br/>
&gt; a hard enough time trying to cast on things that are<br/>
&gt; blue too me.  I even have things that are green to<br/>
&gt; me resist my spells at times.  I think they should<br/>
&gt; fix this also.  alteast make Tashan help more if you<br/>
&gt; cast it you should be able to cast on res things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To clear up the spell stunning issue.  In a patch<br/>
&gt; about 3 weeks ago they had a post on the patch<br/>
&gt; server and the news section that said.  Spells that<br/>
&gt; were to Stun (ie. Chaotic Feedback, Sanity Warp,<br/>
&gt; Smite a Cleric spell line and others) will instead<br/>
&gt; interupt the targets casting.  I would rather it<br/>
&gt; stun since these spells take sooooo long to cast as<br/>
&gt; it is and Colour Flux is better for this.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They do need to do some serious work on the<br/>
&gt; Enchanter to make them a some what playable race. <br/>
&gt; With every patch something seems to get worse with<br/>
&gt; them.  Illusions broken (I know it was a accident<br/>
&gt; but it still took them about 2 weeks to fix it)<br/>
&gt; which is a major part of a enchanter.  They also<br/>
&gt; need to add some sort of enchant weapon and if it is<br/>
&gt; in the game now hidding it will be useless by the<br/>
&gt; time you are level 16 to 20 since you will either<br/>
&gt; have money to buy a weapon or you can go find a<br/>
&gt; magic weapon by this level.  Also fixing Jewel<br/>
&gt; crafting would be nice since it is a joke right now<br/>
&gt; 150 plat to make a +3 int item where I can get a<br/>
&gt; braclet at mid twentys that give 3 int and wiz.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also a question what books tell what pages make<br/>
&gt; which spells?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope that this clears up the Stun issue and<br/>
&gt; everyone needs to protest to make this worth while. <br/>
