<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-540634389">just wondering but when you have a charmed whatever when you zone the charm goes away doesn&#39;t it? and also if that charmed whatever is attacking something and the charm wears off does it keep fighting whatever it is or does it come straight back after you?</div>
