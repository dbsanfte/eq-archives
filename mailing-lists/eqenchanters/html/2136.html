<div id="ygrps-yiv-979878533">So far I&#39;ve only used it on the Fire Elementals in Lavastorm, I haven&#39;t done a<br/>
lot of experementation with it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on getting more CHR items as well, being DE I didn&#39;t get a very high<br/>
base CHR.  I think without the gear I have so far my CHR is only 80. :(  the CHR<br/>
buff I get later will help that.<br/>
<br/>
Another CHR question.  I was lucky enough to find a crude stein for sale on a<br/>
merchant in Feerot, only cost me 7pp and some change.  It&#39;s not for sale there<br/>
anymore.  I&#39;ve heard the only way you&#39;re supposed to be able to get one is<br/>
through a quest.  Does anyone know what quest gives the crude stein?  I see<br/>
people auctioning them occasionally for 30 to 70pp.  I could use the money, so I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind running the quest to get another one.  (too bad they&#39;re lore and<br/>
can only be held in the secondary hand.  There&#39;s been times that carrying 2 of<br/>
them would have come in very handy.)<br/>

&gt; The great debate. Charm is wonderful for controlling a bad situation, but it<br/>
&gt; can be very dangerous to use solo (very effective when it works).  A Charm&#39;s<br/>
&gt; duration, as I understand it, is a random time determined when you cast on a<br/>
&gt; critter and based your the critter&#39;s level, your level and your CHR.  Every<br/>
&gt; &quot;round&quot; there after the critter get a &quot;roll&quot; to see if they break the charm<br/>
&gt; (again based on their level, your level and your CHR).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is no set length however.  I experimented with Orc Pawns in EC when I<br/>
&gt; was around level 16.  I have about a 110 CHR at the time (not very good by<br/>
&gt; the way).  Duration was everything from 2 seconds to 5 minutes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m level 12 and I just got Charm and I&#39;m wondering if the duration will<br/>
&gt; &gt; increase as I go up in level?  I know charisma is an important factor<br/>
&gt; &gt; for this spell, and right now, with all my charisma gear on I have about<br/>
&gt; &gt; 99 chr.  Right now Charm only lasts a few seconds, not long enough to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything useful with it..  Should I just hold on to it for a few levels<br/>
&gt; &gt; and use it later?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
