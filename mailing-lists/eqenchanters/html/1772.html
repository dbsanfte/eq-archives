<div id="ygrps-yiv-151537889">Something else you can do is offer a trade.  In High Pass Hold a vendor<br/>
sells the animation spells for levels 8 and up.  This is the only place to<br/>
get them.  Just like Neriak is a tough place for a high elf, High Pass is<br/>
tough for a Dark elf.  You might want to pick up two of those spells when<br/>
you go to High Pass and then offer a Dark elf a trade for enchant silver.<br/>
If I was a Dark elf on a regular server, I&#39;d charge you 15 plat to get that<br/>
spell for you.  On the hell known as Tallon Zek, you&#39;d never get it.<br/>
