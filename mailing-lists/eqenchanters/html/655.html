<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074169311">Actually, charming PCs with a pet is one of the best tactics on the PvP <br/>
server.  The player becomes charmed, the pet registers it as an attack on its <br/>
owner and attacks the person casting charm, and then the PC (as your pet) <br/>
registers this as an attack on you and attacks the pet.  <br/>
<br/>
You can let them duke it out until the PC kills its own pets and damages <br/>
itself in the process.  Then you can root him/her (releasing him/her from the <br/>
charm) and finish him/her with ease.<br/>
<br/>
It is a cruel tactic, but we enchanters don&#39;t win with the straight strength <br/>
of our spells.  It is the creative way we utilize them that gives us our <br/>
advantage.<br/>
<br/>
This tactic generally only works as an offensive tactic (i.e. Humans <br/>
attacking Dark Elves, Dark Elves attacking Humans, Gnomes attacking High <br/>
Elves, High Elves attacking Gnomes, etc etc)) because Charm takes too long to <br/>
cast once you are under attack.</div>
