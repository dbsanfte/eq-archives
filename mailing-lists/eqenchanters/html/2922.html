<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728548918">Have you tried Sol A?  I really like that zone quite a bit.  Plenty of nice<br/>
items.  You could do a 3 person group pretty good in there.  Cleric,<br/>
yourself and a ranger is nice for snare and melee damage.  Also for tracking<br/>
some of those rare spawns.  A few nice pieces there, Runed Lava Pendant, Imp<br/>
Skin Gloves, Obsidian Hoop (3 Int 3agil and some AC I think).  Also Unrest<br/>
Tower and bar could be nice IF you can find a few good people to group with<br/>
as it can be quite a challenge if your group does not know what they are<br/>
doing.  The bar has the 2ac 5 charisma earrings there, very nice I still use<br/>
1 at lvl 53.  Well good luck and lets keep the msg&#39;s coming.<br/>

Here is a question then. I&#39;ve been groving from 20 to 25 in the lake of ill<br/>
omen, easy exp, I only die now when...well, I haven&#39;t died in quiet a while!<br/>
The down side is...bored. Ran a shadow knight from 1-8 just to take a break.<br/>
Tonight my lv 25 enchanter will be at Castle Mistmoore for the Halloween<br/>
bash (Our guild, the Nameless of Norath, on the nameless server, is hosting<br/>
a server wide raid).  I need somewhere interesting and good for growth to<br/>
hunt. But with enough people to not spend a long time standing around<br/>
looking for a group. Should I stay in Castle Mistmoore? Or go else where? Or<br/>
what?<br/>
<br/>
Vroc, Enchanter on the Nameless<br/>
