<div id="ygrps-yiv-618311902">I agree with both your opinion on the ease of acquiring the Glowing Stein<br/>
and that Verant&#39;s proposed fix is not a good idea. I like your idea of<br/>
making existing ones no drop and changing the quest reward. However, I don&#39;t<br/>
believe you can put the GS in either hand right now. I tried to equip both<br/>
the Glowing Stein and my Crude Stein right after I got my GS, and couldn&#39;t<br/>
equip them both.<br/>

&gt; i&#39;m sorry, but people who are complaining about this change... please shut<br/>
&gt; up about it. it&#39;s a freaking plus 10 INT, plus 5 DEX, plus 20 Sv Disease<br/>
&gt; item. in other words, an AWESOME item. it was too too too easy to get, and<br/>
&gt; we could hold it in either hand. there was NO penalty for using/having it.<br/>
&gt; i think it&#39;s a good idea that they are going to introduce some sort of<br/>
&gt; penalty for having it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; do i think it&#39;s a good idea that they have to change it now? no. they<br/>
&gt; should have thought of it before they made the quest so damn easy. if they<br/>
&gt; had made it as hard as the GBS to get, then i wouldnt expect there to be<br/>
&gt; any penalty for having it. but since it was easy as hell, i would have.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; my idea is to leave the ones that are in the world as is, except make them<br/>
&gt; no drop. then anyone else who does the quest gets the new one, not the old<br/>
&gt; one. THAT would be the smart thing to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; sorry for the rant.<br/>
