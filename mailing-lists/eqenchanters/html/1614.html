<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205449969">Root spell : all purpose lifesaver. Works very well when you team up with a<br/>
wizard (Tashan+root then leave the nuker do his job) or facing some<br/>
annoying mobs who just have this tendency to run for cover. It would have<br/>
normally be replaced by WTYH at later stage but that spell has been tweaked<br/>
and is of no use.<br/>
<br/>
Cancel magic : remove good and bad spells on you or others. Very useful<br/>
against  targets who uses damaging shields (eg fire elm in lavastorm).<br/>
Defensively great when you go against necro (befallen). Not aggro. Great<br/>
pvp spell <br/>
<br/>
Soothe : used in conjonction with mez to weed out opposition. Motsly useful<br/>
against camps or in dungeons. Soothe is not aggro, so against a party you<br/>
soothe one, mez (later enthrall) another which draw the rest of the crowd<br/>
to you and pet (or party). So, if alone, you can face a lone opponent<br/>
instead of a three mob. <br/>

&gt;Dragon Bones in Steamfont where I am fighting right now are also pretty<br/>
