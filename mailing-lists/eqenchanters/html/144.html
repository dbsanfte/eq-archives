<div id="ygrps-yiv-287924962">you can&#39;t raise your stats ever.  But you can get magical items that<br/>
will raise them I guess.  Charisma makes a HUGE difference when buying<br/>
and selling.  I have a dark elf with low charisma and enchant silver for<br/>
example cost 4p 5g something.  I haven&#39;t bought it with higher charisma<br/>
yet (have to get high enough before I attempt to impersonate a dark elf<br/>
and go in there).  With my high elf and a charisma of 102 I&#39;m selling<br/>
cracked staffs for 1p 3g? something like that.  Well over a plat anyway.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure my dark elf would get less than a plat for that same<br/>
item.  Think of the differences when you want a spell that&#39;s 30+ plat or<br/>
armor for 100s or 1000s of plat!<br/>

How important is charisma? I only have 76, is there a way to raise it?<br/>
If not will it be that impotant down the road that I should ditch this<br/>
character for a new one with more charisma? I&#39;d hate to do that, I&#39;m<br/>
almost to level 7, but if it&#39;s going to hamper me down the road...<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what ya think, thanks,<br/>
