<div id="ygrps-yiv-121201159">I&#39;m not sure if this will help much, but I was in Permafrost the other day for about 5 hours, and I went home with about 10 different pages... you might want to try there, but watch out for the ice giants :)<br/>

Can anyone tell me how willful one has to be to use the staff of writhing?  A friend of mine picked one up somewhere north and let me use it for a while, but it wouldnt cast for me at level 21...<br/>

    I got 24 recently... and haven&#39;t been able to find Velishoul&#39;s Tome pages 8 and 9 on anything. Everywhere I go, I shout for them, and no one ever seems to have them... Anyone know of any mobs that drop these frequently?<br/>
