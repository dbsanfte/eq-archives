<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-501844791">to play on that even....how about sum illusion spells that would temporarily<br/>
turn you into those fighter, rogues, wizard types........illusion spell that<br/>
would put a sword and shield in youre hands......and cover you in full<br/>
plate......if you fought in it it wouldnt help you but at first appearance<br/>
you would look increidbly formidable.....I think that would be a GREAT spell<br/>
to have......twould definatly be alot of fun........or maybe a spell that<br/>
would turn you into a bard......you would be able to play 3 mystic songs of<br/>
illusion so that it LOOKED like you were playing a song and it LOOKED like<br/>
it is having an effect but it wouldnt.......that would be VERY<br/>
COOL&gt;!!!!.....Im going to do a feedbak tonite.......this was a VERY good<br/>
idea bro!!!!<br/>
