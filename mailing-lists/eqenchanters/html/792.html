<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539293232">Hail fellow Enchanters,<br/>
Last night after taking down a Kodiak I got a Rune of Proximity as loot. It looks<br/>
stange and though it must be a quest item. When I went to sell some stuff, I tryed<br/>
selling that too but, being a quest item I belived, I would get nothing for it. To my<br/>
surprise an Innkeeper offered me nearly 2pp for it!<br/>
Does anyone have any idea what this rune is for?<br/>
