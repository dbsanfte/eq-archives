There would just be another form of camping and getting items.  With big<br/>
guilds, <br/>
each character can hold one of those extra items and they can still sell<br/>
them at<br/>
high rates.<br/>
<br/>
So I go with the restriction of only having 1 lore item deal.<br/>

&gt;for a little bit are new characters that are totally buffed out with<br/>
&gt;extremely high end magic weapons, magic items, and plate armor.  Is this<br/>
&gt;wrong?  Depends on how you play the game and is probably fun for some<br/>
&gt;people.  But I think much of the challenge goes out of the game.  I&#39;ve<br/>

In text muds anyway, I&#39;ve done that (but not in EQ).  The reasoning (for me<br/>
anyway) is you play your main character<br/>
and most likely its very painful cause your learning the areas and whatever<br/>
else.  There&#39;s<br/>
a sense of non-efficiency (if your a powergamer type).  Then the thought<br/>
is, &quot;Man, if I could <br/>
do this all over again, it would be so much better and faster&quot;.  I think<br/>
its kinda a silly thought<br/>
(even though I think that sometimes), cause YOUR CHARACTER IS ALREADY<br/>
THERE! Why would I want to<br/>
do it over again?<br/>
<br/>
But the challenge is perfecting the PROCESS of getting to a certain level<br/>
and not the actual level and doing it <br/>
the most efficient way possible to become a &#39;master of that game&#39; type of<br/>
player.  Then you could say, &quot;I got my guy to level 20 in a DAY!!&quot;, and<br/>
other powergamer people would repect you and be in awe.<br/>
