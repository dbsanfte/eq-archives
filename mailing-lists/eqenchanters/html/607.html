<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698018733">where are you coming from? i went from qeynos with a large group of lvl 11-12 people. it was hard only because of the karannas (east karanna the hardest, got killed by lions and griffons). heed the above advice- put all your stuff in the bank and just take it out when you get to highkeep. run the whole way, dont stop to fight anything. i was lvl 12 when i made the trip, so i bound myself to every zone i made it to.<br/>

I will be making the trip from Felwithe, not sure of the way but have gone to the docks.<br/>
I have not taken the boat to Freeport yet, but I assume that is the way to go initially. I will be looking for maps for my journey today and hope to start this evening. Is High Hold near Halas? <br/>

        Finally made it to level 8(half bubble up, half bubble down for 4 hours)<br/>
        and started looking for Mircyl&#39;s Animation Pet spell.<br/>
        <br/>
        Is it True you can only get this spell at High Hold Pass?<br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
    <br/>
    this is true. all the pet spells for enchanters from level 8 and above are at highkeep in highhold pass. they have a bank there, too, so i suggest you put all your belongings in the bank and go the whole way invis. also, i suggest you but not only the lvl 8, but the lvl 12 and 16 as well (put them in the bank, they should be there after you log out and back on)<br/>
