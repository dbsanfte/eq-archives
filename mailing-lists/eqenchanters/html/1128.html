<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108901850">I&#39;ve read that the haze line will stack... what exactly does this mean?  It<br/>
certainly wont stack with mist.  <br/>
<br/>
Also last night I mesmerized a carrion ghoul out of a train in unrest,<br/>
quite a ways above me on the level chart.  The most interesting thing was<br/>
tat not only did he stop in his tracks he was STUNNED!  I use this spell<br/>
quite often (as YOU should) and it seems as though the stun is quite<br/>
random, and fairly rare.  Dont ask me how I hit that MOB with it though, I<br/>
havent figured that one out yet, I ws notified that this ghould was at<br/>
least level 20, 7 levels above me.</div>
