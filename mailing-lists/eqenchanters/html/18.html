<div id="ygrps-yiv-525240947">I had a friend that offered to go get the spell for me, but he didn&#39;t<br/>
know Neriak as well as me.  Instead of him spending over 2 hours I spent<br/>
45 minutes with his help. I guess if I let him go get the spell for me<br/>
that would be better role-playing. <br/>

the only problem with your way is that i think it doesnt take any skill<br/>
or thought (not meaning no disrespect to you ).a part of the game is<br/>
getting the spells with the char that needs it by using illision<br/>
spells,ect. or buying from one that can get it .  probably my main<br/>
problem is that reminds me too much of Ultima online and the game abuse<br/>
that came so easly there . <br/>
