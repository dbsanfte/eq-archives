<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqenchanters] Hi everyone <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759056761">Hello and welcome.  The nearest tiny daggers are in Erudin I believe.  None<br/>
to be found in Qeynos as far as I know.  I don&#39;t know if this is the best<br/>
use of spells but this is what I did.<br/>
<br/>
1. Summon and buff pet.<br/>
2. Tashan<br/>
3. Suffocating Sphere<br/>
4. Get hit and let pet pull it off me.<br/>
5. Fear it<br/>
6. Beat it down as it runs<br/>
7. Recast fear and Sphere as necessary.<br/>
8. Try in vain to issue the pet a &quot;get off what I&#39;m tring to loot&quot; command.<br/>

&gt; hunting with a friend in Qeynos Hills right now, I&#39;m 4th level. I really<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing, usually here is what combat is like, I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been lucky enough to get in a group yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Summon and Buff Pet<br/>
&gt; 2. Tashan<br/>
&gt; 3. Suffacating Sphere<br/>
&gt; 4. Enfeeblement<br/>
&gt; 5. Watch Animation beat up critter, sometimes help.<br/>
&gt; 6. Run away recast Animation and help finish it off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Those are pretty much all the spells I use, with the exception of Minor<br/>
&gt; Guard, Haze and Strengthen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have found that the best exp for me is to kill the diseased stuff and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>turn<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; in thier pelts for alot of exp and a cure of course, that&#39;s really nice. I<br/>
&gt; turned in a fleshy orb once, but she handed it back and said to go to<br/>
&gt; Freeport, though I have no idea where that is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are there any problems with what I&#39;m doing? Please give me any advice you<br/>
&gt; can, I would love to hear it, I don&#39;t wanna get stuck in a way of doing<br/>
&gt; things only to find out that it will be wrong when I get higher in levels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS: Where in Qeynos do I buy The daggers for the Animation spells? I lookf<br/>
&gt; for hours, and go very lost.<br/>
