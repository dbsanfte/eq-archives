<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737772270">Cant wait, pullilng back into port in the morning so hopefully can get a few<br/>
drops this weekend.  I felt like such a loot hound when I kept asking what<br/>
does this one drop what does this one drop.  I think I will print up a list<br/>
before I go.  I hate asking all the time, dont guess I need to know just<br/>
curious.  I was reading the boards about the Enchanter robe and Absor was<br/>
saying that he didnt think the robe was supose to use a Peridot when you<br/>
casted and he was going to &quot;look into it.&quot;  I hope so  I wish our robe would<br/>
cast something useful that we would never have to mem again. <br/>

Actually we&#39;ve seen the opposite.  The horses seem to drop a TON of <br/>
caster stuff.  We&#39;ve had all of 6 pieces of cleric items, lots of <br/>
rogue and warrior items, TONS of SK stuff, a few mage pieces, a high <br/>
number of enchanter items, a couple of wiz items, NO necro stuff, lots <br/>
of shaman items, and NO monk items, plus a couple of all/all stuff <br/>
like the belt, stonewood mail (30 ac + some other stats), another <br/>
GREAT wis belt and a wis bracer.<br/>
<br/>
Go for the wolves and the horses and all the named you can pull <br/>
(except Ail the Elder- silence sucks) and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll start to see <br/>
similar drops.  The named have a decent chance to drop a BP/Legs/Robe <br/>
(although we&#39;ve gotten a few gloves off em too).<br/>

&gt;   Has anyone here done much in Plane of Regrowth?  I have went twice <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt;   last week and stayed for 12 hours once and about 8 hours another <br/>
time.  Only<br/>
&gt;   saw two caster items drop (got both of them btw =P) a pair of <br/>
Enchanter<br/>
&gt;   gloves 5ac , 9int, 9agil, 35mana , 2vs all except magic which is <br/>
1vs and a<br/>
&gt;   belt 4ac 40hps 40mana.  But to spend 20 hours in a plane and only <br/>
see 2<br/>
&gt;   (TWO!) pieces of caster gear drop is pathetic.  While I was there <br/>
I saw<br/>
&gt;   countless pieces of Cleric and Warrior pieces drop.  Anyone else <br/>
seeing this<br/>
&gt;   as well?  This place is really big and maybe my groups are just <br/>
not pulling<br/>
&gt;   the right mobs or we are not in the right area I have no idea.  <br/>
Just seemed<br/>
&gt;   a bit strange to me.<br/>

&gt;   &gt;Heya all,<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Well, me too was wondering about the lifelyness of this group! <br/>
But finally<br/>
&gt;   I<br/>
&gt;   &gt;got soms mail.<br/>

&gt;   &gt;I am also new here, so I just want to say hello too.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Pleased to meet everyone.  I think I posted once before ages ago <br/>
to<br/>
&gt;   this list, but otherwise I don&#39;t post much.  It is a lot quieter <br/>
than<br/>
&gt;   the bards list I belong to, but that&#39;s the most active of them all <br/>
I<br/>
&gt;   think.  And not just because there&#39;s a lot of complaints right now<br/>
&gt;   either!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Hope to hear more from everyone!<br/>
