<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089108317">That is because of the mem blur effect of Mez i believe,   that is how i do <br/>
FP guards witha partner,   :o)    tashani, debuff, and be sure to mem blur <br/>
before they die,  95% of the time no faction hit :o)<br/>
<br/>
same with Mez (and Charm), it has a roll again mem blur, sometimes it blurs <br/>
sometimes not.<br/>
<br/>
I know that charm blurs everytime (whipes damage), because this is how <br/>
classes without Memblur can powerlevel. IE Bards mostly<br/>
<br/>
Mez seems to be just a roll against it,<br/>
<br/>
Now as for Stun ,  i&#39;m not sure on that, i&#39;ve never had a &quot;no faction&quot; hit <br/>
from just usein Stun<br/>
