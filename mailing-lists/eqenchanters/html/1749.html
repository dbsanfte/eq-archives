&gt; First of all you are silly to have tried a Hill giant and a Griffon, both<br/>
&gt; levle 35 mobs with a party full of mid 20&#39;s characters. Nothing you throw<br/>
&gt; will ever stick to a deep red, relative levels matters far more then magic<br/>
&gt; resistance or tashani.  Other then that yes to use memory blur you need to<br/>
&gt; make sure the mob is outside of the agro range.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I used memory blur for the first time last night and I have some<br/>
&gt; questions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My party and I decided to try and tackle a hill giant. With all of us<br/>
&gt; having<br/>
&gt; &gt;SoW and me having Memory Blur (MB) we didn&#39;t think we&#39;d have a problem,<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; &gt;though we are all low-mid 20&#39;s. Well, we couldn&#39;t touch that hill giant<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt;spells even after my tashani. The tank was hysterical and wouldn&#39;t run<br/>
&gt; close<br/>
&gt; &gt;enough for me to get off a MB to get the giant off him. In the end,<br/>
&gt; everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;but me zoned, so the hill giant comes straight for me. I start pushing<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;MB key... Target out of range!... Target out of range!... You begin to<br/>
&gt; cast<br/>
&gt; &gt;a spell.... A hill giant blinks. The hill giant then changed direction<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;went about his merry way. Cool!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Now that we know we can&#39;t take a hill giant, and bolstered by our<br/>
&gt; experience<br/>
&gt; &gt;with the hill giant (noone died), we decided to try a griffon. This one<br/>
&gt; &gt;didn&#39;t go nearly as well. The griffon turned out to be just as magic<br/>
&gt; &gt;resistant as the hill giant, and a LOT faster. After unsuccessfully<br/>
&gt; trying<br/>
&gt; &gt;our spells, the call went out for MB. The tank ran the griff near me and<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;cast MB. A griffon blinks. Problem was, it kept chasing the tank! The<br/>
&gt; tank<br/>
&gt; &gt;didn&#39;t like that news so he kept running for the zone. I chased him a bit<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;try and get another cast of MB off. I guess at that point I was closer to<br/>
&gt; &gt;the griffon than the tank because it turned for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You begin to cast a spell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;A griffon claws you for 96 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; &gt;A griffon claws you for 96 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; &gt;A griffon kicks you for 34 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; &gt;You keep your concentration and finish the spell! (don&#39;t know how...)<br/>
&gt; &gt;A griffin blinks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;A griffon claws you for 78 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; &gt;A griffon claws you for 89 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; &gt;A griffon bashes you for 28 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; &gt;You are stunned!<br/>
&gt; &gt;You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>
&gt; &gt;You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>
&gt; &gt;You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>
&gt; &gt;You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>
&gt; &gt;A griffin claws you  for 56 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; &gt;A griffon kicks you for 32 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; &gt;You have been slain by a griffon!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The question I have is, what is the correct way to use MB? Apparently, it<br/>
&gt; &gt;wipes the hate list, but if you are in the critter&#39;s aggro radius the<br/>
&gt; &gt;critter will just jump you again. Anyone have any strategies to share in<br/>
&gt; &gt;using Memory Blur?<br/>
