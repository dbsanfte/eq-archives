<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511571246">The SMR can be camped in a full group at 40, though IMO the camp is boring<br/>
as all get out. A full group at 45 pulling it to Lord is much more fun and<br/>
experience. Seen quite a few Ishva robes lately, full group at 40 should be<br/>
able to do it, but the Ishva is a 28 hour or so spawn, so do it if you have<br/>
a porter who can drop you in to north karana an hour or two before. Froglok<br/>
Bonecaster robes seem quite popular too, that&#39;s from a level 53 frog in Old<br/>
Sebilis. Me, I&#39;ve been clearing Hate hoping some Insidious will drop. Got<br/>
gloves and boots, haven&#39;t seen a robe drop yet &lt;sigh&gt; .<br/>
