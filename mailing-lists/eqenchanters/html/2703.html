<div id="ygrps-yiv-554231689">hmm ok my 2 cents on lull/harmony/mez.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 32 Paladin (sooth)<br/>
I have a 32 Druid (harmony)<br/>
and an 8 enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
what I have done to pull camps is use both lull and mez to break the camp.<br/>
<br/>
Harmony reduced agro range to near 0, and extremely rare if any save.<br/>
(ourdoor only though)<br/>
<br/>
Lull/Sooth/Calm will reduce agro range depending on level of spell.<br/>
Obviously Sooth reduces the agro range better than Lull.  When they resist<br/>
they don&#39;t always agro, most of the time they do.<br/>
<br/>
Mez has already been described.<br/>
<br/>
ok, now what I have done for some camps is to Lull everything and pull.  Now<br/>
if one saves and pulls a partial camp, I mez the ones that come after us.  <br/>
<br/>
*notes on lull*  Make sure you Lull/sooth the furthest back.  If an agro<br/>
most monster past a lulled one.. they will agro as well.  If you do it<br/>
right, and it works, lull the back ones.. pull the front, and mez the ones<br/>
agro if more than one come.<br/>
<br/>
Harmony is the best though, but playing all 3 characters, I have used them<br/>
all.. Lull and mez is a poor mans substitute for Harmony.  I have used the<br/>
combo successfully in an indoor dungeon though.  Lull one and pull another..<br/>
if they resist lull then mez till the tanks take them out.  BTW lull line<br/>
does not work on an agro mob.  Good luck, has anyone else done it this way?</div>
