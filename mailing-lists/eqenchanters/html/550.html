<div id="ygrps-yiv-217864226">Don&#39;t get frustrated.  Some people are just so immature that they&#39;ll try<br/>
to stomp on you at any opportunity.  Everything you did was right. <br/>
EXCEPT:  You should have reported him again afterwards for his whining<br/>
about you going to a GM.  That&#39;s also classified as abuse.  :)<br/>
