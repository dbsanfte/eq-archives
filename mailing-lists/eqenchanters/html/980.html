<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519158197">I aggree with this protest.  I have been getting frustrated with the Enchanters myself though I still play them.  Verant wants this to be a team game the only problem is (which I run into alot) is that how are we suppose to team and fight things that are a challenge?  When I am in a group and we fight something red I become useless I can&#39;t cast on them so I have to go in and tank with everyone else and have my pet help me at times.  If this is how I wanted to play I would play a Shadow Knight.  I have a hard enough time trying to cast on things that are blue too me.  I even have things that are green to me resist my spells at times.  I think they should fix this also.  alteast make Tashan help more if you cast it you should be able to cast on res things.<br/>
<br/>
To clear up the spell stunning issue.  In a patch about 3 weeks ago they had a post on the patch server and the news section that said.  Spells that were to Stun (ie. Chaotic Feedback, Sanity Warp, Smite a Cleric spell line and others) will instead interupt the targets casting.  I would rather it stun since these spells take sooooo long to cast as it is and Colour Flux is better for this.  <br/>
<br/>
They do need to do some serious work on the Enchanter to make them a some what playable race.  With every patch something seems to get worse with them.  Illusions broken (I know it was a accident but it still took them about 2 weeks to fix it) which is a major part of a enchanter.  They also need to add some sort of enchant weapon and if it is in the game now hidding it will be useless by the time you are level 16 to 20 since you will either have money to buy a weapon or you can go find a magic weapon by this level.  Also fixing Jewel crafting would be nice since it is a joke right now 150 plat to make a +3 int item where I can get a braclet at mid twentys that give 3 int and wiz.  <br/>
<br/>
Also a question what books tell what pages make which spells?<br/>
<br/>
I hope that this clears up the Stun issue and everyone needs to protest to make this worth while.    <br/>
