Silver before that, hire an inkie to buy it for you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.  Animations are in permanent &quot;guard me&quot; mode, but a charmed pet will<br/>
follow all normal pet commands except &quot;get lost&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not sure.  Mez and the like are the strong points of the Enchanter class.<br/>
Even at L5, you should notice that it saves your life quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
It basically stuns a mob for 24 seconds OR until the mob gets attacked or<br/>
takes damage.  You can only use it on something that doesn&#39;t have a DOT on<br/>
it and is not under attack by your pet or a party member.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it as a spell that says &quot;don&#39;t do anything until I&#39;m ready to<br/>
deal with you&quot;.  Use it:<br/>
 - If you accidentally get more than one foe, to make one wait while you<br/>
kill the other.<br/>
 - If your pet dies while soloing, to make your target wait while you mem<br/>
the animation spell and summon another pet.<br/>
 - If you&#39;re about to run to the guards, to give yourself a 24 second<br/>
headstart.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5&gt; Why does my pet always stand on what I&#39;m trying to loot?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s starved for attention.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6&gt; Is being agnostic going to cause grief later?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.  Being agnostic is usually the best choice.  Having a religion will<br/>
affect your faction even when you have an illusion up, which is a bad<br/>
thing.<br/>
