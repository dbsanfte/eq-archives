<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677096845">Make harder rings.  There are at least 6 stones harder than jade.  I am at<br/>
skill 28 and I am pretty much finished with Jade rings.  Jade has given me<br/>
skills already and each stone will only give a few points.  I also noticed<br/>
that your skill advances faster if you practice soon after leveling, and<br/>
personally I always like to sit at a table to do my work, and it seems to<br/>
cut down on the failures a bit<br/>

&gt;This really got me mad yesterday. I put as many training points as I<br/>
&gt;could into Jewelcraft. I then sunk 40 platinum into the skill. I sold<br/>
&gt;all the stuff I made and put it back into the skill.  This got me to a<br/>
&gt;skill of 37 where I was combining Amber and silver. I was in Freeport at<br/>
&gt;the time and my skill was rising very fast I thought. Last night I sunk<br/>
&gt;over 70 platinum into the skill. I went up a notch to using Jade and<br/>
&gt;enchanted silver to make Mana Rings.  In 20 attempts I made 13 rings and<br/>
&gt;got NO SKILL IMPROVEMENT AT ALL.  What gives?  Am I doing something<br/>
&gt;wrong? I thought my 70 platinum investment would get me to at least 40<br/>
&gt;skill or higher. Now I&#39;m broke, but I have yet to sell the Jade rings<br/>
&gt;because I was tired and frustrated. If I can get 7-8 platinum per ring I<br/>
&gt;should get most of my money back. I would appreciate any help here guys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I found my success rate making jewelry better when I had full<br/>
&gt;mana. I don&#39;t know if this was just a coincidence or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks.<br/>
