<b>Subject:</b> RE: Charm question: <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-46626685">Maybe I can help answer this one with some hearsay and rumors that appear to<br/>
be true.  I&#39;ve played with charm quite a bit.  Not the Enchanter charm, but<br/>
the druid version that only works against animals.  My other char is a level<br/>
26 druid and I used charm quite a bit from level 14-18 (before I found<br/>
Lavastorm)  Anyways...those are my credentials and here&#39;s my findings:<br/>
<br/>
The Charisma modifier only affects the initial charm.  *cast charm* [EQ<br/>
checks charisma] *charm holds*  Charm has about 4 settings...ultra short<br/>
(less than 5 seconds)...short (20 seconds)...medium (4-5 minutes)...looooong<br/>
(10-15 minutes).  The level of the mob in relation to the caster seems to be<br/>
a factor (green mobs are easier to charm and hold longer).  <br/>
<br/>
So, you ask, what the hell good is a mob that is 4 levels below what I&#39;m<br/>
trying to fight?  Gather round friends because here is the answer:<br/>
<br/>
Buffs/debuffs<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the druid spell list...level 19 (one rank above charm<br/>
animals), they receive a spell called Feral Spirit.  This is a pet buff that<br/>
is supposed to help make your pet fight a bit above what it could normally.<br/>
This isn&#39;t to give you an advantage in an &#39;even&#39; fight...this is to make<br/>
that &#39;even&#39; fight possible.  Enchanters are blessed with buffs that do even<br/>
more than this to help out their weak charmed pet.<br/>
<br/>
I can see all of the raised hands ready to ask, &quot;Why in the heck would I<br/>
charm a monster to fight when I can summon my pet?&quot;  Okay...this is part of<br/>
the hearsay that I was talking about.  Your summoned pet will take a piece<br/>
of the action for itself.  A charmed pet doesn&#39;t (as far as I know).  You<br/>
can use a charmie to help you get 2 or 3 other kills and then when your<br/>
charmie is low and ready to die...release it (/pet as you were) and kill it<br/>
for full xp!  A charmed pet will also respond to /pet commands.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyways...I hope this helps answer a few question about charm that might be<br/>
out there.  I&#39;m totally open to any feedback on this...this is just what<br/>
I&#39;ve heard here and there and what I&#39;ve been able to figure out myself using<br/>
charm animals as a druid...</div>
