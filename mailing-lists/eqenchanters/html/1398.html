<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088279359">As I am about to reach my 16th rank....I am anxiously preparing for<br/>
Research....<br/>
<br/>
How many training points are recommended before I start combining pages?<br/>
And what is the maximum you can train to in the Guild?  I have both sides<br/>
of Tasharins page 23...and I don&#39;t want to fail my first research<br/>
attempt...as they were not easy to acquire.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice will be appreciated.<br/>
