&gt; Personally I&#39;d love to be able to enchant items, but I also have to agree<br/>
&gt; that since we&#39;ve come this close to being balanced with the other classes<br/>
&gt; (that arent fucked up), we might be asking for trouble.  I thought of the<br/>
&gt; problem of there being a sudden surge of magical weapons in norrath and<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; that could completely flood a possible market quite quickly, but I suppose<br/>
&gt; that could be solved by making enchant : item, ore, weapon very high level<br/>
&gt; spells, and either a lore item/quest item or in a difficult place (or<br/>
&gt; unobvious) place to get it.  Then will it make us that much tougher?  Well<br/>
&gt; you can certainly imagine there will be a few more people interested in<br/>
&gt; playing enchanters, and personally I think I see enough enchanters now<br/>
(I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; like to be the only one really).  We&#39;d be in very high demand, but we have<br/>
&gt; gotten that from some other spells like clarity (IMHO our greatest asset<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; unlike SoW).  Yeas well you can see how scattered my thinking is today so<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m shuttin up.  You can pick that apart.<br/>

&gt; btw, what do you think of the last name Zilla?  I think its cheezy myself<br/>
&gt; but many seem to like the idea... any suggestions?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Giving us the ability to enchant items would not add anything to our<br/>
class<br/>
&gt; &gt; to unbalance it vs. other casting classes. It is just a continution of<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; &gt; current enchant metals line. It is what our class is about. There are<br/>
lots<br/>
&gt; &gt; of jewelcrafters out there that aren&#39;t enchanters, just as there will be<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot of people who aren&#39;t enchanters crafting magic weapons and armor if<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; &gt; get the ability to enchant ore in the future. This isn&#39;t an &#39;addition&#39;<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; our class, this is finally delivering what was promised...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Party pooper, party pooper. Ok you know the song, this time I fill the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; role<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; :).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; May I point out that the message said that the code was going to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; implemented, not that -we- enchanters are going to benefit from it.<br/>
&gt; True,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it was stated in the book we could do it, but at no time in B4 it was<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; effect, and, according to EQE, we received other benefits to make up<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As I see it, such thing would overbalance us (enchanters) in regard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other pure spell user classes. So either the benefit will be too small<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; even consider it or too huge and Verant might take out something in<br/>
&gt; return<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to balance our classe again. Don&#39;t tell me we&#39;re nerfed now. We were,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; true,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but that was sometime ago and from my point of view we are rather<br/>
&gt; balanced<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding other pure spell users. To sum up we have our &quot;niche&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, the idea is: By talking here, and offering Verant options to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; consider<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we may have a say in the matter and make our class fuller in the<br/>
&gt; way -we-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; see it. What I would like to see discussed here is : What can we give<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a &#39;proper&#39; enchantment line of spells?. Or are we just to receive<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; new ability/spell/line of spells without giving up anything?.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As stated above, I dont think we can&#39;t expect a &#39;useful&#39; line of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enchantment&#39;s spells unless we give up something in exchange. Thinking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of Beta, there was a line of spells we didn&#39;t have but nonetheless<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; managed to survive and prosper : Pet line of spells. Plus they don&#39;t<br/>
fit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enchanters very well . On the other hand, this line form the very core<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; most of our solo strategies so losing it wouldn&#39;t be a small thing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is just an example, a topic&#39;s starter. Feel free to agree,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; disagree<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or tell me to shut up. Once again my aim to to talk things out here<br/>
&gt; first<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and offer something (petition/ EQE/ you name it) constructive to<br/>
Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; before we see something not implemented or half implemented in place.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Best,<br/>
