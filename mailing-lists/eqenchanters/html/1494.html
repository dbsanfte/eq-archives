<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877161924">You should practice in the order of cost of stone.  Malachite will<br/>
probably get you 15 points or more, but I wouldn&#39;t know because I<br/>
trained with my guildmaster for 21 points. With the next 10 stones or<br/>
so you can get 2 skill points each before they become trivial, assuming<br/>
you do them in order. Starting with Wolfs Eye Agate or Jade it<br/>
increases to 3 points of skill per stone.  Not all the stones are<br/>
readily purchasable so you may have to do 4, 6 or even more points with<br/>
a more expensive stone.<br/>
<br/>
Baelish has the stones listed in order on his site.  Print out this<br/>
page and refer to it as you practice.<br/>

&gt; There are thousands of opinions on the &quot;best way&quot; to<br/>
&gt; go <br/>
&gt; about raising your skill and making money at the<br/>
&gt; same <br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; My question is this:<br/>
&gt; If I do not train more than 5 points into Jewel<br/>
&gt; Craft, <br/>
&gt; and raise it by experience instead (for the RP<br/>
&gt; aspect of <br/>
&gt; learning hands on :) )is it beneficial to use silver<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; bars and Quarts/Malachite to increase skill?<br/>
&gt; At level 21 (max trainable at the guild) what gems<br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; not help raise JC skill?  <br/>
&gt; What is the order of stone progression exactly. ie<br/>
&gt; what <br/>
&gt; does &quot;start with Carnelian and work your way up&quot;<br/>
&gt; mean?<br/>
&gt; Can you give me a list? Star Rose Quarts, Carnelian,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jasper, ?, ?, ?  <br/>
&gt; Thanks for reading my frustrated rant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Off topic, I was in N.Ro last night and I have never<br/>
&gt; had <br/>
&gt; as much fun killing Skeles. Before I had to go sell<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; had bagged 18 skeles in 30 minutes as the zone was <br/>
&gt; completely cleared and repopped twice. I started<br/>
&gt; with no <br/>
&gt; money after just coming from the bank and had 5gp<br/>
&gt; equiv. <br/>
&gt; in copper and silver before I had to go sell. I hope<br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; do it again tonight. hehe.<br/>
