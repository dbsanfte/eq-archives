&gt;Sorry for the long winded questions but I am a bit confused about research.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For Tasarins the pages do indeed coem in halves. They appear to be torn from<br/>
a book and will show a definate tear along one side or another. If you have<br/>
enough pages you will eventually see that there are two different graphics<br/>
for Tasarins pages.  <br/>
<br/>
For Velishouls the pages are numbered consecutively, with some pages being<br/>
faded.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have not first invested the money at the trainer tog et the research<br/>
skill as high as possible do so it will save you time and money in the long<br/>
run. At that point you want to seek 23, 24 etc just to practice to raise the<br/>
skill. Be aware that only mesmerizarion (which i rarely use at level 30) is<br/>
research, disempower and levitate are both available for sale.  <br/>
In fact the only two spells I can recall actually having to research so far<br/>
are tepid deeds and Mesmerization. <br/>
