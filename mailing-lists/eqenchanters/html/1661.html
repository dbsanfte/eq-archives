<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894900826">I recently hit level 16 with my enchanter, and got some great new spells<br/>
like Chase the Moon, Sanity Warp, etc...but I have noticed a drastic<br/>
increase in the frequency my spells are resisted. Green cons consistantly<br/>
resist Sanity Warp, the same monsters that I killed with Chaotic Feedback<br/>
when they were blue cons. I have begun using Tashan again (Ever since level<br/>
10 or so, I stopped using it), and Tashan seems to help the situation. I<br/>
just think it is strange that I am having such a problem with monsters<br/>
resisting more powerful spells, when lesser spells seemed to work on them<br/>
great at lower levels. For instance, wisps now con green, but often resist<br/>
Sanity Warp. I was murdering wisps with Chaotic Feedback just two levels<br/>
ago. Same thing is happening with monsters I am just now starting to fight<br/>
alot, like crocs in the Oasis, undead in Unrest, and Borer and Scythe<br/>
Beetles in the Karanas. I am at a loss. Anyone else experience this kind of<br/>
thing?<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t wait for Tashani...<br/>
