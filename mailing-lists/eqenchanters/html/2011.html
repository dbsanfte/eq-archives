 </span></blockquote>Ack!!  My Level 10 Enchanter just bought a Turtle Shell Helmet for 2pp a couple<br/>
of nights ago.  (Well 1.7pp + a raw silk helm)  Now I&#39;m Twinked!!  *Malkin<br/>
hangs his head in shame.   I&#39;ve never thought much of twinkies, as a matter of<br/>
fact, I started all of my characters on different servers.   Oh well, such is<br/>
life,  Fat chance that I&#39;m giving up the helm.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

BTW 2pp was a heck of a deal wasn&#39;t it?</div>
