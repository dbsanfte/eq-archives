<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqenchanters] Cabilis faction <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839585049">ok I think I understand now.<br/>
 <br/>
with illusion iksar and benovolence the warlord is Threatening which I<br/>
believe will still get me attacked if I try to talk to him or stay too<br/>
close.<br/>
 <br/>
So, from what I&#39;ve read I want to kill greenies to raise my faction to<br/>
dubious with illusion and benevolence so that I can turn in stuff to further<br/>
raise my faction.<br/>
 <br/>
Poor little greenies, there&#39;s going to be a slaughterfest this weekend ;)<br/>

This is why Enchanters are so very good at doing Quests. <br/>
Everyone else has to rely on Hide or Invis. <br/>
Do your Illusion and Benevolence from a distance and see how he cons. <br/>
If he is dubious or apprehensive your probably safe to turn it in. <br/>
If he is still Scowling ready to attack then kill more goblins or Iksar<br/>
outcasts or Sarnak to raise your faction. <br/>
I have not done this part with my enchanter yet as he is too low level to<br/>
enjoy Kunark. <br/>
My Iksar however sees the Legion of cabilis go up with those kills and I am<br/>
pretty sure that includes the Warlords. <br/>
If not then hopefully your Illusion and Alliance series are good enough to<br/>
raise the faction enough not to be KOS. <br/>
I never rely on Invis as my first line of defense when dealing with<br/>
merchants or Quests. <br/>
Even if it lets you do the trade if the trade did not make you well enough<br/>
you still risk being killed after the fact. <br/>
