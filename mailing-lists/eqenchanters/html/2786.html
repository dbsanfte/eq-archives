<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167379053">108 is a faded page, level 29 research items drop from level 29-34 critters.<br/>
Some may drop on big chargers and avocets in South Karana. Other spots to<br/>
check are Highkeep, Lost Temple of Cazic Thule, and the lower level areas of<br/>
Lower Guk. Just walk into the zone and /auction for em, will come to you,<br/>
clarity included (if you are level 29 already). Offer two or three plat<br/>
each, more if you really desperate.  Also, check vendors EVERYWHERE. I&#39;ve<br/>
bought more level 44 research items off of vendors already than I ever found<br/>
of 39 stuff hunting in Lower Guk and Sol B. I also advertise regularly in my<br/>
guild precisely what items I need which I have found is the best way to get<br/>
them. The main thing is to let people know what you need because if it<br/>
doesn&#39;t sell to a vendor for more than FS will, most people will just poof<br/>
it or let it rot.<br/>
