<div id="ygrps-yiv-877289311">I wonder if we are making it too difficult.  What if you could now get a<br/>
&quot;Lore Item&quot; unless the total # of that item in your group &lt; # of people in<br/>
the group that could use it?  Then, also, once a character has sold one of<br/>
an item, they could not get another?</div>
