<div id="ygrps-yiv-73631853">To be honest, its quite easy (if not time consuming) to get your faction up<br/>
in calibis...  I suggest making a decent pet and hanging around not too too<br/>
far away from the city entrance in the Warslik Woods, killing hundreds and<br/>
hundreds of the little goblins that frequent the area.  They are extremely<br/>
plentiful, and even the whelps provide faction with both the Legion of<br/>
Calibis and Firona Vie.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re feeling these are too weak, you can always go to the other goblin<br/>
camps between the overthere and calibis (in Warslik woods).  At one camp, a<br/>
goblin will spawn names Dragoth(?) the Destroyer, which conned yellow to a<br/>
level 32 ranger that came by after me and a friend were slaughtered by him<br/>
and were sitting around contemplating what to do about him.  Let me know if<br/>
you want more particulars about this goblin... he&#39;s an easy spawn to find<br/>
and also easy to make appear after not much time... you just need to be in<br/>
the right area.<br/>
<br/>
There is also some Iksar bandit camps in this zone, but you will lose<br/>
faction with another faction which I believe is the shadowknight guild in<br/>
calibis, although you still gain factions with the Legions of Calibis.<br/>

&gt; spittin mad:<br/>
&gt; Illusion Iksar - The Iksar can see right through it making this spell<br/>
almost<br/>
&gt; useless in it&#39;s current form.  The only way I can see to make the spell<br/>
work<br/>
&gt; is to raise your faction with the Iksar so they won&#39;t kill you.  But if<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; are going to go to all this work what&#39;s the point of the spell in the<br/>
first<br/>
&gt; place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The faction for Agnostic enchanters needs to be raised so that they are at<br/>
&gt; least dubious with this illusion.  I was able to get my faction up to<br/>
&gt; &quot;Threateningly&quot; by using illusion Iksar and benevolence so I know it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; possible to raise faction above KOS, just a pain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; never give up my enchanter:<br/>
&gt; breeze, clarity line - I&#39;m the hit of any caster party<br/>
&gt; mez line - nothin feels better than ordering the party when to start/stop<br/>
&gt; attacking MOBs so you can park them<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hallo all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been on the list forever but haven&#39;t played in forever too... Just<br/>
went<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; out and bought a copy of the original game-my computer isn&#39;t smart enough<br/>
&gt; 166/32mb/4mb vid card-and I&#39;m wondering about the optional files offered<br/>
&gt; when you first start up a copy of the game and click the &#39;play online&#39;<br/>
&gt; button.(Not talking about the register Kunark button) I&#39;m wondering if<br/>
these<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; files are too much for my computer too handle, system spec wise, and what<br/>
&gt; they happen to contain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And yes, I&#39;m still going to play an Enchanter, again, even knowing how<br/>
&gt; annoying the class can be. I can&#39;t help it, Enchanters are without a doubt<br/>
&gt; the iconoclastic class in the game, the enigma to many, and seeing the<br/>
mana<br/>
&gt; speed up spells I&#39;m sure one of the most bothered classes-a&#39;la SoW-in the<br/>
&gt; game, which is fine with me most times because I love chatting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And Since I haven&#39;t played in about a year, I&#39;ll try to start up a debate!<br/>
&gt; What are the best and worst changes to the Enchanters as of late? What<br/>
makes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; you spittin mad and what makes you want to never give up the class??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
