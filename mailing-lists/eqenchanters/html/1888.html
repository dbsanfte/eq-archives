<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-241272478">I dotn care weather the stein works or not anymore, the fact is that if you<br/>
got one then you will still have an item that does plus 10 to int and all<br/>
the other crap, if you dont have one. well, you should have gotten one<br/>
before the patch, and you still can, I got 2 of them tonight for the first<br/>
time ever, took me about 4 hours. but now when it changes into a weapon, who<br/>
cares, you still have the stats, and show me a weapon that is better???? at<br/>
least for now that is attainable. basically, stop complaining about it, and<br/>
go get one already, its not that hard yet, and we cant guess how hard it<br/>
will be afterwards if we dont know yet.<br/>
