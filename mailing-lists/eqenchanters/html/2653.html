<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050290402">Wisps in NK are always good for cash.<br/>
<br/>
Lightstones sell to the Gypsies for 1pp+ and if you give the Greater<br/>
Lightstones to Mrysila (?) you get a research book you can sell back to her<br/>
for about 9pp (and some experience as well).<br/>
<br/>
Not sure how safe a place to hunt NK is at level 12 though - probably OK if<br/>
the Griffawns don&#39;t agro on you.</div>
