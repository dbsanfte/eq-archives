<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341939346">You have an extremely good point, my friend......<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;m in no hurry...although, at times...as my friends level so far<br/>
above me that it is no longer desirable to group....that I long to &#39;catch<br/>
up&#39;....thus...I have to find new &#39;friends&#39; to group with...which, btw, has<br/>
not been a problem.  I still chat and trade with my higher-level<br/>
friends...and I suspect at one point, the difference in levels will be less<br/>
of a consequence...as the penalty decreases (as far as exp splitting).<br/>

	I had a level 16 dark elf necro that I started on the first day of<br/>
the<br/>
	release. It took me 4 &#39;played&#39; days and a half to get it to level<br/>
16. then I<br/>
	gave it up. I have now a level 16 enchanter. It took me 12 &#39;played&#39;<br/>
days to<br/>
	make it to 16... You think that&#39;s a problem for me? I had so much<br/>
more fun<br/>
	playing an enchanter. What&#39;s the deal with this level race?<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll<br/>
	spend an hour travelling back and forth just to say hi to a friend I<br/>
havent<br/>
	seen for a long time. Right now, I&#39;m hunting in CrushBone and I<br/>
barely make<br/>
	any xp where I could be soloing in Lavastorm and make a shit load of<br/>
xp and<br/>
	money..but what&#39;s the big deal? I enjoy playing Everquest a lot more<br/>
now.<br/>
	Powergaming is so boring. So are those people who start a race<br/>
everytime  a<br/>
	new server comes up.<br/>
