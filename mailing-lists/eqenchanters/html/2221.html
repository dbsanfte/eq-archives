<b>Subject:</b> Strategy <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325689435">Eventually, all enchanters find out that their pet can&#39;t tank. I have<br/>
developed a strategy which will prolong the life of our beloved pets and<br/>
make our use of mana more efficient. However, this will only work if the mob<br/>
you are soloing is not one of those &quot;cons blue but hits like a red&quot; types.<br/>
First, u tashan, then you do your Dot. Then, u wait for the pet to have half<br/>
hp, and then cast the big dd spell. This will draw the mob toward you. Here<br/>
is the most important part. You must begin running in a circle, hitting jump<br/>
every once in a while. The mob will chase u and hit u less then it woud if u<br/>
were standing in one place. While this is going on, your pet is getting free<br/>
hits on the mob and should quickly finish it. Note: as much as you&#39;d want<br/>
to, do NOT use debuffs other than tashan. You must cast your 3 spells<br/>
quickly, before the pet gets so low on hp that the mob will finish it. Once<br/>
again, this will only work if the mob you are fighting is blue. You must<br/>
have an open area to work with, I&#39;d say at least 15ft radius. I am currently<br/>
using this one in Lavastorm and its very mana efficient.  Good luck.<br/>

&gt;Oasis is great for orcs grouped and crocs solo<br/>
&gt;So Ro would be good for the derv camps and drybones<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;West Commons is good.  Are wisps still blue at 12? think they are.  The<br/>

&gt;Beholder would be ok for minos grouped and muddite minors solo<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The karanas (west I suppose) should have some bandits and the like<br/>

&gt;Unrest would be pushing it for death beetles and tormented dead with a<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;You&#39;ll notice I didn&#39;t mention much in the way of dungeons cause I like the<br/>
&gt;open spaces.  But befallen would probly be ok and if in a decent group<br/>

&gt;I was wondering if charmed pets get exp when they kill something. Do they<br/>
&gt;get it every time or just if they make the last hit? Any info would be<br/>
&gt;appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I am a lvl12 enchanter and am wondering what sort of places I can<br/>

&gt;&gt;Jewelry skill will cap at 200 so that no platinum items become trivial.<br/>
&gt;&gt;There is no level cap for trade skills. Main skills are capped at<br/>
&gt;&gt;(5xlevel)+5, but trade skills do not have this level limitation. Two<br/>
&gt;&gt;different meanings of skill caps. Hope this clears up the confusion.<br/>
