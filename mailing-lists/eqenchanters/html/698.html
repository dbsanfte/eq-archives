<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087792416">the friendlist and probably other options data is located in the file<br/>
eqoptions1.opt in yout Everquestdirectory.<br/>
<br/>
I encountered the problem that i couldn&#39;t add another name because the game<br/>
said you have already 20 friends in your list, please delete one you do not<br/>
use. But I didn&#39;t remember the name of the guys that made a new char and<br/>
were not online with the old in my list, and there for I never saw the name<br/>
when typing /friends all... and did not remember, as well there were some<br/>
typo names in.<br/>
<br/>
Ok what i did is: open the file eqoptio0ns1.opt with notepad, and on the<br/>
second very long line you see all the friends names, and i took notes. I do<br/>
not advice to edit the names, as the files formate is binary, and if you do,<br/>
the file will be probably corrupt.<br/>
<br/>
But you can write them down for later ingame editing, to regain free slots.<br/>
And - if you transfer this file to the everquest directory of a second<br/>
installation, you will probably have your friendlist and so on there as<br/>
well. I did not try this, and if you do make copys of the files before<br/>
overwriting.<br/>
<br/>
Thw character specific data is probaply in the file &lt;charname&gt;.opt -<br/>
socialbuttons, hotkeylist... everything that changes with the char. And you<br/>
can try to copy this file as well to the directory of a nother installation<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
The files are binary, but the format is simple, and it shouldn&#39;t be a great<br/>
thing to make an offgame optioneditor to manipulate the files. As the data<br/>
included is not vital in the sense, that you could cheat something by<br/>
changing your friendslist, I don`&#39;t think Verant would oppose such a simple<br/>
tool.<br/>
<br/>
I already /bug &#39;ed the problem with editing the friendslist when you forgot<br/>
the old names, and people are no longer online to see the name, but there<br/>
was no reaction from Verant.<br/>
<br/>
In the file dgb.dat you have a logfile of your logins and logouts, a tool<br/>
can easyly analyze these lines vor you offgame.<br/>
<br/>
In guilds.dat (binary) the are all Guildnames in the game listed, and<br/>
charnames, not shure if guildmasters... should be analyzed.<br/>
<br/>
the file equname.txt contains your station loginname.<br/>
<br/>
Ok thats what i can say from a short look, Perhaps someone likes to take out<br/>
his compiler, and creates a nices offgame minitool to view an edit this data<br/>
conveniently.<br/>
