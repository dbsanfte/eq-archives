<div id="ygrps-yiv-92968586">Here&#39;s a short editorial posted on EQ Enchanter in reference to jewlery<br/>
pricing with a nice reference to the United Blacksmiths of Britannia (ultima<br/>
online).  I thought it would be nice to post here so more people might see<br/>
it and comment.  Notice this was written by Alaya of Fenin Ro.<br/>

Standardized Jewelry Pricing is Needed Now! by Alaya of Fenin Ro<br/>
<br/>
Hail fellow Enchanters!  A long time ago, in a galaxy few now remember with<br/>
fondness...  It is the Dark Ages. Lord British rules the land on a shard<br/>
called Atlantic. There were many trades in this land, and although some were<br/>
mind-numbingly repetitive, the citizens of the land still ground out their<br/>
trade, day by day, hoping and wishing for the gods to grant them a higher<br/>
level of skill. One such trade was Blacksmithing. As the months went on, it<br/>
became known to the people that Blacksmithing had been touched by the hand<br/>
of the gods, and now the hard working tradesmen could make armor and weapons<br/>
better than those in any store. Inevitably, the trade became more<br/>
popular...the supply rose...the prices of the items dropped, and the<br/>
tradesmen who had worked for their skill were not happy.  Then came the<br/>
United Blacksmiths of Britannia. The UBB (as it came to be known) was a<br/>
coalition of these tradesmen, and they brought honor to the trade. They<br/>
established a uniform pricing system, fair and reasonable, so that most<br/>
could afford their quality wares, and the tradesmen would still be rewarded<br/>
for their hard-won skill. I would like to propose something similar for us,<br/>
in this new land called Norrath. As we, The Enchanters, are the ones that<br/>
control the Jewelry trade, perhaps we can come to agreement on what pricing<br/>
is fair and reasonable to our patrons, while still allowing for us to make a<br/>
good profit for our trouble. As Azara outlined in the editorial &quot;So You Want<br/>
To Sell Cheap Jewelry?&quot;, we are in danger of allowing our craft to fall<br/>
victim to price slashing and subsequent deflation. Baelish has already done<br/>
us the favor of creating a centralized location for us to exchange ideas and<br/>
gather information. I propose a new section to the Everquest Enchanters, the<br/>
Jewelry price chart, for completed items. The prices can be debated and<br/>
agreed upon in the forum. If we do not take this step, I fear our craft,<br/>
which we have already put so much time and money in to, will soon be<br/>
worthless...or at least, worth much less. Thank you for your time, Alaya,<br/>
Enchantress and Jewelcrafter, Fennin Ro.</div>
