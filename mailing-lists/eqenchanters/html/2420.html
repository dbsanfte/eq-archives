Wizzy stuns are the same there, I think.  I have NEVER had a color flux<br/>
break my mezzes.  Last night I mezzed a Lava Duct Crawler which was all<br/>
alone, and immediately color fluxed it, stunning it.  I did this completely<br/>
for the purpose of having an example for you.  after about 20 seconds I<br/>
color fluxed again.  after about 30 more seconds I let my group tear it<br/>
apart.  Color Flux does not break mez.<br/>
