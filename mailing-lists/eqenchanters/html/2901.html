<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474363949">Ok, I hit 12th last night and am at the Nybrite camp. How much exactly does<br/>
soothe reduce the agro range by? So far I have only been able to take out<br/>
Kayla by the tree. Every time I try for Shayla (they are all even fights<br/>
right now) I soothe Tay and Jay and even throw one on Shay, back way up and<br/>
cast Tashan. Now it may have been a fluke, but  my pet engaged her too close<br/>
to Jay and ended up pulling her to. It still happened when my pet didn&#39;t<br/>
attack her early. I have run to MM several times no matter how many times I<br/>
try to pull Shay. Help? Druidic Harmony cannot be beat at this camp. *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was also told to try Cognoggin (13 warrior). Where is he located? I was<br/>
told by the gnomes in LFay, but will I be able to pull him without any other<br/>
mobs coming after me? I know he is on faerie faction, which I don&#39;t give a<br/>
hoot about, just like Gearheart and the Queen. Anyone know a loc?<br/>
