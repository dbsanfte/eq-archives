<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389789768">I generally cast Alacrity on my melee group members and tepid deeds and <br/>
disempower on the critters.  Disempower seems to work better than enfeeblment <br/>
as far as I&#39;ve seen for getting the mobs to fit for less damage.  If I&#39;m <br/>
trying to save mana and have a bunch of creatures though I usually stick to <br/>
Alacrity, and enthrall what we&#39;re not fighting and when we go to fight the <br/>
creature casting tepid deeds.  The speed buffs/debuffs are a big help.</div>
