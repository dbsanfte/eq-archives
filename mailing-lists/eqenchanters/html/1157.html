<div id="ygrps-yiv-70675648">I am starting to do blackmithing wiht my enchanter, and was wondering if<br/>
anyone knew of a decent site to get correct info on what to make at diffrent<br/>
skill levels.<br/>
cuz I spent no points just sharpening when I get rusty weapons ...figured I<br/>
could make a buck or two if I could figure out best way to raise skill ...<br/>
thanks in advance<br/>

electrum at...might be nice to earn money from more than mana rings</div>
