<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005867294">It&#39;s broke! I&#39;ve used it often and found it&#39;s effects on Rellos Zek to be<br/>
just text. I&#39;ll get the message a player or mob has been mes&#39;d but it just<br/>
keep&#39;s after it. I am sad to say this spell is broken obviously. It is<br/>
suppose to be an AE version of Mesmerize, but has fallen short. Frankly I<br/>
am so happy with the recent changes it wouldn&#39;t bother me a bit if it<br/>
wasn&#39;t fixed till after speclization or some other things are that effect<br/>
more than just one class (directly).</div>
