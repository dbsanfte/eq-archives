<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119914680">correct. Your pet won&#39;t hit a darn thing unless it hits you first, or<br/>
swings at you.  Are pets are a lot safer in that sense then other pets<br/>
are. the problem withour pets is usually after the battle. one gnoll<br/>
wanders off half dead, and your pet gives chase, but you can&#39;t call your<br/>
pet back! So he chases the gnoll off, whacking at it heels until it runs<br/>
into a group of friends, which quickly spank the pet, and coming looking<br/>
for the owner.  Watch for this! save a little mana Always for crowd<br/>
control at the end :)<br/>

&gt; hit hit.  So,<br/>
&gt; *don&#39;t let your pets wander off and attack as you may see more <br/>
&gt; *of the bad<br/>
&gt; *guys at once than you intended.<br/>
&gt; *<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I Thought that our Enchanter pets didn&#39;t listen to the pet commands<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; necro and magician pets do?   I tried most of the /pet soandso things<br/>
&gt; and it<br/>
&gt; just had a mind of its own, much like a pet cat :P<br/>
