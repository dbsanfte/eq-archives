&gt; &gt;comparable to those of a wizard, we DO have the <br/>
&gt; &gt;second best nuke set in the game. The only person <br/>
&gt; &gt;that can outdo us on mana:damage as well as max <br/>
&gt; &gt;damage is a wizard. We&#39;re number 2 at nuking just <br/>
&gt; &gt;like everything else :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ah.. and there&#39;s the rub. You picked the two spell attributes that can be<br/>
&gt; found on a spell list and are basing the spells&#39; usefulness on those hard<br/>
&gt; numbers. I agree that our mana:damage ratio and max damage are good. I<br/>
&gt; just hit level 34 and must admit that it&#39;s nice to do 270+ damage with a<br/>
&gt; nuke. After you cast that nifty new nuke a few times you start to realize<br/>
&gt; that that&#39;s just not our job. Two major reasons for that conclusion:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our nukes are INCREDIBLY resistable. They are all-or-nothing, and since<br/>
&gt; they have both a damage and a stun component, the critter gets TWO chances<br/>
&gt; to save. A successful save against either component = NO DAMAGE. It&#39;s nice<br/>
&gt; to dump 160 mana into a nuke and have absolutely nothing to show for it<br/>
&gt; except most of a bubble of mana gone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our nukes have terribly long recast times. Stand next to a wizard and try<br/>
&gt; to fire off your best nuke as fast as he can fire off his. One of the<br/>
&gt; critical factors you forgot to figure in was damage:time. We don&#39;t come<br/>
&gt; close to any of the other classes in that measurement. You might not<br/>
&gt; notice it right in a lot of situations, but next time you&#39;re in the AoF<br/>
&gt; room in Cazic and one of the lizards starts running right after you nuke<br/>
&gt; it and you&#39;re waiting for that button to light back up you&#39;ll come to<br/>
&gt; understand.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to add to this list...<br/>
