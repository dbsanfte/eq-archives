<div id="ygrps-yiv-17359821">Well, I didn&#39;t realize it, but my wife wanted to play a cleric, so I <br/>
gave her my best stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Also, as to the no drop Temple stuff, the screen shot clips from <br/>
AllaKhazam&#39;s web site shows them all as tradeable. I will attempt to <br/>
complete the quests with my druid and my guildmates just like I did <br/>
for the Cleric quest pieces.<br/>
<br/>
I made 3rd level last night. It feels good to be able to melee a mob <br/>
to death with a dagger and Shallow Breathe. I know it won&#39;t last, but <br/>
I will enjoy it while I can. =)<br/>
