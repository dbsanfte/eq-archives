<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275364092">Well...<br/>
<br/>
1.  when you defeat someone in PvP, you may search their corpse and retrieve<br/>
all of their money and one item (except for protected slots)<br/>
<br/>
2.  we cannot do a lot of damage with our spells, not like a true &#39;damage&#39;<br/>
class... our DD spells are feeble and our DoT spells... well... necromancers<br/>
laugh at them all the time.  Since we cant take away hit points, there is no<br/>
way we could finish off any class with a great deal of hit points.<br/>
<br/>
3.  we cannot melee.  enough said there.<br/>
<br/>
4.  our pets are weak and easily hit.  their only purpose is to keep<br/>
monsters from chasing us when we run away.<br/>
<br/>
5.  well yes we have some debuffing spells.  Should we use this tactic in<br/>
PvP, we will end up with no mana and a feeble opponent who can still kick<br/>
our 500 HP butts.<br/>
<br/>
6.  We can still charm monsters to assist us to attack, yes.  Unfortunately<br/>
this is another one of our &#39;ubertaunt&#39; spells and if we cant keep that MoB<br/>
charmed until our opponent is dead, our opponent can sit and laugh as our<br/>
former pet beats us into the ground.<br/>
<br/>
I hesitate to mention this, but at least we still have the<br/>
Mesmerize/enthrall/ect line of spells.  This is our one last bastion of<br/>
effective spells in PvP.  Everyone touch wood now.  I&#39;m really not happy at<br/>
all with these latest nerfs, but I am one gnome and one gnome cannot fight<br/>
verant.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK.  From the recent posts, a lot of people are upset about the changes to<br/>
&gt; enchanters in pvp.  My question is why?  I have not tried pvp and have no<br/>
&gt; reference.  Isn&#39;t the point still to kill npc&#39;s for loot and exp?  In pvp,<br/>
&gt; does that change?  I mean, Do you get loot or exp from fighting other<br/>
&gt; players?<br/>
