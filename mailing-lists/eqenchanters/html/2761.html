<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-347307277">Enchanter pets begin to bash and kick at low levels (cant remember when),<br/>
and dual wield at level 29.  I believe that at level 39 they gain double<br/>
attack.<br/>
<br/>
One question that I have, that probably cant be answered, is : Why is it<br/>
that I can summon a pet, who appears with sword and shield in hand, and give<br/>
it a single dagger... causing it to dual wield daggers?  Where is it getting<br/>
the second dagger from?  I&#39;ve also seen some pets that are dual wielding 2H<br/>
weapons (hang around a spectre killing group with pets and you&#39;ll likely see<br/>
this happen...) This includes enchanter pets... I&#39;ve personally had a pet<br/>
that was two floating scythes.<br/>
<br/>
Even after the pet-nerf, I still enjoy using my pet to solo @ level 45.<br/>
Although its more exciting to use the charm methods to fight solo, there is<br/>
something to be said for having a pet that you know will never turn on you.<br/>
I&#39;d also like to point out to the younger enchanters out there that if you<br/>
summon a pet, for goodenss sakes use every buff you possibly can on them<br/>
(shade line, speed + line, strengthen, feedback)... and if you have a cleric<br/>
in your group be sure that he/she buffs it as though it were any other tank.<br/>
Our pets have minimal hit points but other than that fact are efficient<br/>
little slice and dicers.  I would also like to point out that the entire<br/>
reason for the pet nerf a few months back was because our pets were FAR<br/>
tougher than any other pet at high levels (when properly prepared with low<br/>
delay weapons and &#39;swift like the wind&#39;).... imagine how cheated the mages<br/>
felt!<br/>

&gt; On one post I read on an enchanter board before it said that enchanter<br/>
pets<br/>
&gt; can duel wield<br/>
