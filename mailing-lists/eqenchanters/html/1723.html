<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-615877429">I have started a new enchanter on the newest server.  I just to level 10<br/>
last night and began working on my jewelcraft skill.  I put my 20 skill<br/>
points in and began working on malachite rings.  I failed 5 times, no biggie<br/>
expected something like that, but then I made one and got a trivial message.<br/>
I then made a lapis necklace and got the same trivial message.  I failed on<br/>
a malachite and got a skill raise.<br/>
 <br/>
Something screwy going on.<br/>
 <br/>
I did a petition and the guide had me do a feedback as well.  Supposedly<br/>
there were no changes to jewelcraft.  Buyer Beware ).<br/>
