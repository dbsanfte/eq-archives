<div id="ygrps-yiv-816204615">okay, Black pearls are looted off of Aviak Avocets, and Centaur<br/>
Corsers....they are very rare loot. I have yet to find one on a Griffon.<br/>
approx sale of a black pearl is 300 to 400pp on Bristlebane server.<br/>

&gt; don&#39;t think any are sold.  I looted one of a griffin once.  It was a freak<br/>
&gt; find as I was level 10 at the time.  Was walking along and *pop* this<br/>
&gt; griffin corpse appears at my feet.  I was looking around trying to figure<br/>
&gt; out what was going on and *poof* it disappeared.  I was sad till a few<br/>
&gt; seconds later it reappeared at which point I pounced on it.  Got a<br/>

&gt; for the gem so I sold it.  Sigh, didn&#39;t know how rare they are since you<br/>
&gt; only can find them from loot supposedly.  Anyhow, got one off a griffin.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m guessing the max quality of looted gem is based on the level of the<br/>
&gt; monster.  No gurruantee you&#39;ll get a good gem but at least possiblity is<br/>
&gt; there?  So, perhaps other NPCs that are similar level or higher will also<br/>
&gt; have black pearls?<br/>

&gt; Hey guys, i was wondering if anyone knew of a vendor that sells black<br/>
&gt; pearls.  That are supposedly rare, but caster&#39;s realm didn&#39;t include these<br/>
&gt; on the NPC drops so I was thinking maybe someone sells them.   Any clue?<br/>
