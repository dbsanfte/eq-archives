<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqenchanters] I&#39;m makin fireworks, I finally got my Froglok  Ton Totem! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-94195887">I probably killed about 5-6 ton warriors, which seemed to be only willing to<br/>
drop the pieces of totem, very reminiscent of the metal things I used to<br/>
find in the steamfront mountains when I was a newbie.... aah those were the<br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
I actually avoided the city like the plague... level 45 and remembering frog<br/>
swarms in low guk tends to keep me away from large groups of them.  I<br/>
started my search there, however, and while its a beautiful city I got very<br/>
frustrated without a tracker, and tired of looking in each building over and<br/>
over again..... just too many frogs to kill!<br/>
<br/>
Eventually I settled down near the bandit camp (2600, 0) and killed some<br/>
Iksar brigands for a while... but this didnt seem to be bringing any ton<br/>
warriors as I had heard it would.  Here is my &#39;trick&#39;... there is a place<br/>
near to the brigand camp (read:I could see the smoke from the fire) that<br/>
seemed to have a great deal of roaming beasties in it (mosquitoes,<br/>
insatiable spermy tooth things, skeletons, and hello whats this?  is that a<br/>
frog?).  I made a decent pet, gave him a targ shield cause he looks so cool<br/>
that way, and proceeded to kill everything that wandered past.  I probably<br/>
did this for about 2-3 hours and saw about 3-4 ton warriors, as well as<br/>
puh-lenty of mosquitoes an other swamp creatures.  Finally, I was<br/>
exasperated, I had friends coming that wanted a tour of kunark, and I was<br/>
sitting to med to full before leaving when a ton warrior crept up behind me<br/>
and lo and behold, he had brought me a totem for my time.<br/>
<br/>
Let me see if I wrote down the exact location of this spot I sat in...<br/>
check at 2194, 237, -6.05 and see if its close to the brigand camp and if<br/>
there are lots of roamers peddling through.  There should be a tree or 3<br/>
fairly close and you&#39;re within a few steps of some swamp water.  This is<br/>
where I sat and killed everything, I believe, and if you dont have a tracker<br/>
its definately the highest traffic place I found after almost a week in the<br/>
swamp.  I find it funny that I actually did have a tracker with me a few<br/>
times, and I found more ton warriors sitting at this spot than I did running<br/>
around the zone on the trail of a ton.  I also think it helps to be totally<br/>
exasperated and plan on leaving in 5 minutes... at least that seemed to help<br/>
me :)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; congrats!  I have the other 3 pieces (like many people I&#39;m sure).<br/>
&gt; Approximately how many ton warriors did you have to kill for the totem to<br/>
&gt; drop?  And did you find them only in the city in Swamp of no hope?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Use caution when turning in your items.  There is more than one kind of<br/>
&gt; shaman powder.  Probably if you use identify it will say &quot;Nok Shaman<br/>
&gt; Powder&quot;.  I mention this as a friend has two &quot;shaman powder&quot; items, one<br/>
&gt; black the other white.  I have only black powder which came from a Nok<br/>
&gt; Shaman so I believe black is the correct one.<br/>
