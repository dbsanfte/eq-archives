<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512133474">I have searched back a couple digests, and haven&#39;t<br/>
found an answer and figured this would be quicker.<br/>
I am an Enchanter on the Karana server, and have<br/>
a Jewelery skill lvl of about 41.  I have been <br/>
making enchanted jeweler for a while, but don&#39;t <br/>
really have a firm grasp on what kind of base <br/>
prices I should be charging.  Here is a list of <br/>
prices I am charging now.  Could I get some<br/>
feedback on what others are charging, and maybe<br/>
set up a Merchants Co-operative to set prices for<br/>
our market on Karana.  <br/>
<br/>
+2 Agility rings 3pp<br/>
+2 Dexterity Braclets 4pp<br/>
+2 int rings 5pp<br/>
+2 strength rings 6pp<br/>
Jaded Silver rings 7pp<br/>
<br/>
I usually give up to 1pp off if someone buys 2 at<br/>
a time.  Just wondering what the rest of you sell<br/>
for.  I don&#39;t want to undercut the market, but <br/>
then again I Don&#39;t want to sell to high.<br/>
<br/>
I think if we set up a Jewelery Co-operative we <br/>
may be able to set higher prices for our wares.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
