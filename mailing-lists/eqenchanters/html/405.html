<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528421828">Well as some know I am a lvl 23 enchanter on Xegony server have have been<br/>
doing a few test with Charisma and our spells being resisted. My natural CHA<br/>
is 90. With a magic amulet of plus 5 CHA and sympathetic aura I have a CHA<br/>
of 117. I have noticed that I am resisted almost 30% less then when I do not<br/>
have any Charisma altering spell/items on, so if you all have any other<br/>
information regarding this please let me know.<br/>
