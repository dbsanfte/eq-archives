<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311119416">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Some friends of mine were lucky enough to get into a competition to win a<br/>
wedding.  They have had a really rough trot $$ wise of late and have had to<br/>
put off the deal a couple of times before.  They are keen to get married,<br/>
but need votes on the net to win the comp..<br/>
<br/>
Could you all please go and vote for Glen and Melissa at:<br/>
<br/>

Not something I&#39;d normally ask about but they really do deserve a good turn<br/>
= )<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
