<b>Subject:</b> RE: Question about Augmentation and Rune series.  Also Feedback. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-437125243">I dont remember what the mana is on it I hit 29 last night.  I had a friend<br/>
teleport me to Erudin to buy my spells then I logged out.  I was able to<br/>
make a feedback on my first try failed the other 2 times I tried.  If I<br/>
remember correctly it is 75 mana.  It is a damage shield if you are hit the<br/>
Mob takes 11 damage from what I can see I tried it on a Black Wolf and it<br/>
was only able to hit me once so that was the extent of my test on it.  I did<br/>
bug the fact that Rune and Agumentation was not stacking but I was having<br/>
wierd things happen to me last night so I was hoping that it was just<br/>
lastnight and that maybe it does stack but the icon does not show.  I will<br/>
try it more tonight though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	Give me a message tonight I will be on about 11:30 pst tonight I can give<br/>
you the info on it then.  If you are looking for one I know most of the<br/>
higher level Enchanters.  I believe I know someone who has one.  I can find<br/>
out if he has one.  I also am looking for a Strip Enchantment if you have<br/>
one or know anyone who does.  Give me a message later tonight if you are on.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s spelled Sylverlokk, and yes I&#39;m on E&#39;ci, only level 29 though.<br/>
&gt; I will test them when I can, If they don&#39;t stack thats a bug it<br/>
&gt; seems to me<br/>
&gt; and should be bugged and feedbacked.<br/>
&gt; Can you give me some details about feedback like how much mana it<br/>
&gt; costs and<br/>
&gt; what it does?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Is it just me or do these not stack.  I was trying to cast Rune II last<br/>
&gt; &gt;night with Augmentation on and noticed I was not getting a Icon<br/>
&gt; for Rune II.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I hope that maybe I was bugged lastnight because it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
&gt; right that<br/>
&gt; &gt;they dont stack.  One is a damage shield and the other is a Agi<br/>
&gt; buff.  Any<br/>
&gt; &gt;one knowing anything about this please let me know.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Has Feedback been fixed yet I know there was a problem if the MOB died by<br/>
&gt; &gt;Feedback the corpse disappeared.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;SilverLock I was wondering is that the name of your character on EC&#39;I?  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;dont ever remember seeing you around there I keep track of most of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;higher level enchanters and know most of them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks for your time all.<br/>
