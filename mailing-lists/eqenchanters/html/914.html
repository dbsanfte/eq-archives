EG : Dervish ring in NRO are sold around 2-5gp and they increase DX by 2.<br/>
Far less than the accrued cost one enchanter has to pay to make one himself.<br/>

Unless a major overhaul of jerwelry is underway, I think this craft is a<br/>
sure money drain. On the other hand smithing appears to be quite lucratvie<br/>
in the end. I don&#39;t know what kind of money they have to pour in in the<br/>
first place. Still that won&#39;t prevent me from trying to master the craft.<br/>
The doctor says this has to do with the intake of caffein.<br/>

&gt;I found this web site that displays all the jewelry we can make up to<br/>
&gt;gold+ruby...Well it really looked worthless to me at first glance. After<br/>
&gt;thinking a bit, I thought: well, if that&#39;s all we can get in the game, then<br/>
&gt;players will buy it. Then I started a little research around and I found out<br/>
&gt;that you can find much more powerful magic items that we can ever make on<br/>
&gt;monsters...so what&#39;s the point? Who&#39;s gonna pay 150 plats to buy a +3 INT<br/>
&gt;ring if he can get +6 INT Helmet by camping at a certain place.<br/>
