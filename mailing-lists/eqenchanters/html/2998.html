<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574502678">maybe i&#39;m just rich then, i never use anything but rune 5 now, and i <br/>
pretty much don&#39;t carry any less than 60-80 periodots.<br/>
  and other than runeV what else whould you want on your robe?  cause that <br/>
Reclaim magic on the shoes is the biggest joke i think i&#39;ve ever seen. i <br/>
just can&#39;t think of anything better than a rune spell to put on the robe.<br/>
<br/>
  I just know that i&#39;m glad at least rune4 is on there cause doing these <br/>
like VS and Trak where eveyone wants rune that will be helpful (their <br/>
dots/life taps eat the rune first)...  hehe in fact during Trak usually have <br/>
a golem charmed and keep myself alive with rune... hehe<br/>
<br/>
  As for Naggy and Vox... you get to fight over who tashes, and then after <br/>
that all you can really do is mana seive (only takes 2 chanters to take all <br/>
his/her mana)<br/>
<br/>
  Personally if i could change anything about enchanters.. i&#39;d give us <br/>
something that wasn&#39;t magic based ... like make our dots disease based or <br/>
give a poison DD  or something other than magic. cause when that chanter <br/>
BotB comes around  it&#39;s gonna be a joke to watch.<br/>
