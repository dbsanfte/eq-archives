&gt; How about this. If you charm a magical being, like a wisp, than have it<br/>
&gt; attack, would the thing it is fighting be able to hit it? This could be<br/>
&gt; used to take on much higher level creatures that couldn&#39;t hit magical.<br/>
&gt; Might be a sort of cheat. I don&#39;t know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, you can.  The caveat is that they will not fight deep reds. I tried to<br/>
get a wisp to attack a Griffin for the hell of it, but no dice, it just<br/>
ignored my commands.  On the other hand, I use a wisp to take out Kodiaks<br/>
all the time - it is quite hilarious to watch!<br/>
