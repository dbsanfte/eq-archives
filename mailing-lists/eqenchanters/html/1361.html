<div id="ygrps-yiv-174579031">I sell +2 stat rings for 6pp or 2 for 11, +3cha necklaces for 8. only<br/>
because that is going price around Freeport. I haven&#39;t had any requests for<br/>
anything higher, other than ruby, but I don&#39;t know where to find that in<br/>
Freeport. I might run to Highpass tonight and look there.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s awfully quiet out there today....you must have all had a good<br/>
weekend,<br/>
&gt; like I did....raised my jeweling skill from 22 to 38 over the past<br/>
&gt; week....any other success stories?  Is that a normal rate?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Working with jade and pearl now....the pearl rings are a hard sell...even<br/>
&gt; at 12pp each..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i noticed a lot of jewelers selling their wares for a lower cost then<br/>
&gt; mine...seems like I&#39;m getting cut....I&#39;ve been selling for about twice the<br/>
&gt; cost of materials...seems like a fair rule for prices (considering all the<br/>
&gt; factors and costs involved in getting skill high enough to even work with<br/>
&gt; the better stones)....but I saw a few people selling jade rings for<br/>
&gt; 6pp???!!!!   Ouch!  10pp is what I&#39;ve been selling them for.....and until<br/>
&gt; someone auctions a lower price, I had no problem getting that price.   It<br/>
&gt; pains me greatly to see it happen...so I politely ask the vendors to raise<br/>
&gt; the selling price a little....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any thoughts?<br/>
