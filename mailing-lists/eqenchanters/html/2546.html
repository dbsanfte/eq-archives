<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162610848">In a small group in high 20&#39;s we held the hand room and pulled the bar, but<br/>
inside the house color flux/shift will cause a lot of problems agrressing<br/>
things in other rooms. The basement doesn&#39;t have this problem.<br/>
The ghost room is good for level 29-35. The ghost himself is 35 I am pretty<br/>
sure (had a hard time getting spells to stick at 31). In the area spawn<br/>
greater dark bones, barbed bones, skeletal monks , mortuary fungus,<br/>
festering hags, and tentacle and dark terrors (blue to yellow at 31). I lost<br/>
track of the number of times enthrall, color flux/shift, and charm saved our<br/>
lives here. Standing and waiting for enough mana to regen to cast color flux<br/>
and stunning 4 things is not something I ever want to have to do again<br/>
(someone did something really stupid). It&#39;s a great room to really show the<br/>
power of an enchanter. My main charm targets were the hags (they are great<br/>
pets), though the yellow tentacle terror which I then convinced the group to<br/>
let solo a white one was the biggest pet I had there.<br/>
