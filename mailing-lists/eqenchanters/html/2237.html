Each specialisation skill will cap at 50.  Seriously dont specialise in<br/>
anything but alteration.<br/>
<br/>
What I would recommend is you train 1 poitn in each then cast a level 1 alt<br/>
spell like weaken on yourself until you get 51 in it.<br/>

&gt; Hi All!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was reading on eq.castersrealm.com about research (gettin close to 16<br/>
&gt; and I REALLY want mesmerisation :)  ), I need to find page 26 of<br/>
&gt; Tsarin&#39;s Grimoire left and right for it.  Does anyone know where it<br/>
&gt; drops or where I might be able to buy it?  Also, Is the tome of Endless<br/>
&gt; Enchantments in the general Enchanter guild area or do I need to travel<br/>
&gt; to find this as well?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also ran across the page on specialization, and it&#39;s got me curious<br/>
&gt; now..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This page says that the spell skills will cap at 50 skill and you can<br/>
&gt; then specialize in one.  I&#39;m level 14 right now, and All of my spell<br/>
&gt; skills are at 75 (except conjuration, which is at 36, uck, need to keep<br/>
&gt; working on that one).  Has something changed with specialization or am I<br/>
&gt; just not understanding something?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
