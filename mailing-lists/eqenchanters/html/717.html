I am sorry to hear that you ran into trouble..  But I must admit that I have<br/>
never found an Orc that can see invisible  ( I may be wrong, its just that I<br/>
have never ran into one).  What server are you on?  I am on the Rathe Server<br/>
and would be happy to assist you in obtaining your Animation.  Here is<br/>
another Thought for you also:  You may want to use the Dark Elf illusion,<br/>
the Orcs in CrushBone do not attack me when I am using the DE illusion so<br/>
perhaps the Orcs in Highpass will not either..  But I would still use<br/>
INVIS..<br/>
<br/>
Narcos<br/>
Lvl 16 Enchanter  (if I can keep from dying haha)<br/>
