<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885185686">Exactly. Earlier in the message about bugs he posted something about male <br/>
barbs not showing shields... Pardon me but does that really effect game <br/>
play? I think it looks cool when they have a bow and a sword, looking like <br/>
dual wielding newbies. Some people just need to look around the bugs and <br/>
just play, Verant fixed all really bad bugs. And with every patch you can <br/>
expect some bugs to come up, like the illusion bugs. I don&#39;t play my <br/>
enchanter anymore, so I never knew it wouldn&#39;t work. And when they patch <br/>
something they only test what is going in... Not every single little detail, <br/>
like enchanter&#39;s illusion spells effects. If they did that we would get a <br/>
new patch every 3 months and still be like we were in pre beta testing.<br/>

&gt;Swap Character between Servers? Are you crazy?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is an onlline world that is consistently changing what good would<br/>
&gt;moving a character to anohter server do? So your friends are not on the <br/>
&gt;same<br/>
&gt;server as you.. create a new character on that server and play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3) The inability to swap characters between different servers is stupid,<br/>
&gt; &gt;hopefully Microsoft learns from that major EQ mistake. (I&#39;d still like to<br/>
&gt; &gt;play with all my friends and co-workers on the same server, instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt;spread out over 4 servers, pity EQ doesn&#39;t realize how critical this<br/>
&gt;feature<br/>
&gt; &gt;is to allot of us - who the hell wants to start over? Hint: we&#39;d pay to <br/>
&gt;get<br/>
&gt; &gt;our chars moved over Verant.) The correct implementation would have been<br/>
&gt; &gt;&lt;log-in:choose character:choose server:play&gt; not what it is now. Major<br/>
&gt;brain<br/>
&gt; &gt;fart here.<br/>
