<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328897698">ahh, I understand now.  Use your teammember who is far enough away from you<br/>
that if you mes his area it won&#39;t hit you.  There were some area effect<br/>
spells which I would cast at my fellow tank (as a wizard) and the area would<br/>
center on him.  He wouldn&#39;t be hurt but the creatures attacked him in<br/>
response instead of me.<br/>

I discovered this last night.  What a lifesaver!  I was in the Alchemist<br/>
room in Permafrost and constantly mezzing myself, not fun especially with<br/>
the pulls we were getting.  I accidentally had my tank targetted and he<br/>
happened to be on the opposite side of the room.  I used that the rest of<br/>
the night. :)<br/>
