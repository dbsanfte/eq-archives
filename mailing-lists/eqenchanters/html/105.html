<div id="ygrps-yiv-747115003">When I had my level 16 necro, I started some research ( barely really ) and<br/>
went to the multiple guilds to buy some books. I&#39;ve noticed then that all<br/>
guild have about 5 volumes for research, except the enchanters who have only<br/>
2...or maybe 3..not sure. Do we have less research ability or are our<br/>
various research books in a lot of various places just like our spells?<br/>
