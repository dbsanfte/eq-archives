<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063565940">Yes, save skill points for research definately.  You dont want to waste<br/>
those hard-earned pages on getting your skill up to 20 when you can simply<br/>
train in it.  I&#39;m not sure of the amounts of skill points you can train in<br/>
at those levels, however.<br/>
<br/>
Expect to ruin the faded pages, they are generally the more difficult items<br/>
to research (and generally for the spell you want the most).  Dont worry<br/>
about your skill points though, once you&#39;ve recieved dodge it will go up<br/>
rather quickly and doesnt necessarily warrant training in that beyond the<br/>
initial point (which you NEED to train).  I am level 46, and generally train<br/>
in one of the 2 dragon languages.<br/>

Subject: [eqenchanters] Skill points<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi all;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been taking a break from my Enchanter lately, but I have a few<br/>
&gt; questions on skill points. After I hit 8th, I put 10 points into evocation<br/>
&gt; since the spell itself sucks alot of mana. Now When I look forward, I see<br/>
&gt; research at 16 and nothing again til 20 for specialization, then dodge at<br/>
&gt; 22, then nothing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now if what I read is correct at 16, 17, 18, and 19 I can train 1 point<br/>
into<br/>
&gt; research for each level. At 20 I can put as many points into it as I wish.<br/>
&gt; Is this correct?<br/>
&gt; Do I save my points and pump research to the max at 20 (70 minus the 5 for<br/>
&gt; specialization)?<br/>
&gt; How hard is it to be successful at 16 with a skill of 1?<br/>
&gt; My primary char is collecting lefts, rights, faded pages, etc. so that I<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; increase skill but I would like to know my odds for when I actually start<br/>
&gt; using the pages for research.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>
