&gt; Hi people,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t care. At least for now until we know more.  Not meaning to be<br/>
&gt; rude as I think we have good information to pass back and forth on other<br/>
&gt; topics.  But, this is beginning to remind me of arguments with my wife<br/>
&gt; about who would take out the trash or what exactly did I mean when I<br/>
&gt; said &lt;blank&gt;. Now, let&#39;s not confuse this with the &quot;your computer means<br/>
&gt; more to you than me&quot; fights cause those are in another league and they<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t understand hehe<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, this is the kind of thread that discourages people from being a<br/>
&gt; part of mailing lists.  I said..., no you meant..., no I meant and you<br/>
&gt; are saying..., he said that you said..., etc. my ears are ringing<br/>
&gt; already<br/>

&gt; &gt;I love how EVERYONE has opinoins but no one can state a fact<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m glad you have the honesty to say everyone, you certainly arnt<br/>
&gt; contributing any.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; .....or even<br/>
&gt; &gt;calculate anything tangible and informative<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not sure what you mean by this, I&#39;ve heard several people say that<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; had significantly fewer resists after making a character with a higher<br/>
&gt; chr<br/>
&gt; than a prior one with a lower chr.  To me, this is far more &#39;tangible<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; informative&#39; than saying that Stratics says something, ergo it must be<br/>
&gt; true.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; .........ppl just argur for the<br/>
&gt; &gt;sake of the arguement I think<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of couse, arguing is fun. =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ......oh well....until Stratics proves to be<br/>
&gt; &gt;wrong or has falsified information I will continue to read their site<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;take it to heart<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Firstly, I never even suggested that Stratics falsified information.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; talked with eqss people in the chat rooms in beta, and grouped with one<br/>
&gt; early in retail.  They&#39;re good, honest people.  However, they are *not*<br/>
&gt; perfect.  You want an example of wrong info on the sight?  Okie dokie.<br/>
&gt; If<br/>
&gt; you look under thier class reference chart, you&#39;ll see that barbarians<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; large sized creatures, and it will say that, for example, high elves are<br/>
&gt; small/medium.  Now, the thing is, barbarians are capable of wearing<br/>
&gt; medium<br/>
&gt; armor too.  The simple fact is, Verant has not released a great deal of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &#39;number crunching&#39; information, so I&#39;m likely to at least pay attention<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; someone who comes up with new information rather than dismissing it out<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; hand do to its not being known beforehand.  *All* the information that<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; once stratics was once this way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ......and by the by.......MANY of the authors of EQ are<br/>
&gt; &gt;directly involved with GMs and what not....just becuase they arent<br/>
&gt; Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt;EMPLOYEES dusnt mean they dont have inside information.......<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll admit befuddlement as to what you mean when you say &quot;many of the<br/>
&gt; authors of EQ are directly involved with EQ...&quot;.  I assume you mean that<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; authors of EQSS or perhaps EQVault there rather than EQ.  I&#39;m quite<br/>
&gt; certain<br/>
&gt; that the authors of EQ are involved with the GMs. ;)  However, neing<br/>
&gt; friends<br/>
&gt; with the admins of CoN, I can assure you that GMs do *not* give out<br/>
&gt; specific<br/>
&gt; number crunching values to anyone.  Seriously, how do you mean that they<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; involved?<br/>
