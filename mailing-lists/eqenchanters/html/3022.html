<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; While it is asserted by some that Magicians are masters of the<br/>
&gt; summoned pet I am here to dispute such rubbish. It should be obvious<br/>
&gt; to anyone that Enchanters have the best pets. &quot;Scoff, scoff&quot; you say?<br/>
&gt; You think our animations are puny, stupid and lack the scintillating<br/>
&gt; conversation offered by other casters&#39; pets? If I were speaking of the<br/>
&gt; default Enchanter pet line, the (insert lame anagram-created name<br/>
&gt; here)&#39;s Animation, you would be correct. However, we have a deluxe<br/>
&gt; line of enchanter pets that people seem to forget about, each with<br/>
&gt; their own strengths and weaknesses. One immediate advantage you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; note is that we can have up to five pets at a time. Let us examine<br/>
&gt; each in turn:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Warrior<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: Celerity and an alcoholic beverage or promise of<br/>
&gt; lots of shiny metal objects.<br/>
&gt; Pros: Strong attack/defense, it will usually last long enough for you<br/>
&gt; to zone or gate to safety.<br/>
&gt; Cons: A tendency to get you trained by mobs, Auto-Attack always seems<br/>
&gt; to be on, &quot;/Pet Back Off&quot; command appears to be bugged.<br/>
&gt; The toughest of our pet line but often the most troublesome. The<br/>
&gt; warrior pet comes in many shapes and sizes. I prefer the barbarian<br/>
&gt; warrior pet combo. With a warrior pet it&#39;s generally best to just turn<br/>
&gt; them loose and stand back. They ignore most commands and tend to pull<br/>
&gt; when you&#39;re least ready. Hearty, strong, and stupid (but within<br/>
&gt; acceptable limits), the warrior is best used in dungeons and other<br/>
&gt; tight fighting spots. Make sure you stand upwind of it though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ranger<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: Clarity and words of encouragement, or free rezzes.<br/>
&gt; Pros: Nice multipurpose pet; can track, forage, and cast spells, some<br/>
&gt; fighting ability.<br/>
&gt; Cons: Tends to die a lot, poor self image.<br/>
&gt; Great for outdoor hunting if you can&#39;t manage to summon a druid pet.<br/>
&gt; The ranger pet is good for quests. It is excellent at locating that<br/>
&gt; rare spawn. Like following a bloodhound without any depth perception<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll go careening all over the zone, often passing much more<br/>
&gt; interesting spawns, but eventually you will run your quarry to<br/>
&gt; ground...unless it de-spawns in the meantime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Paladin<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: Clarity and tell it you&#39;re on a mission from the<br/>
&gt; gods.<br/>
&gt; Pros: Decent fighting ability, great one shot heal, very<br/>
&gt; self-sacrificial.<br/>
&gt; Cons: Holier than thou.<br/>
&gt; The paladin is great for those areas where you need to burn a pet to<br/>
&gt; achieve your ends, such as holding off a group of berserk undead while<br/>
&gt; you loot that special spawn and gate to safety. Also useful for<br/>
&gt; purchasing things and turning in quest items in those good cities<br/>
&gt; where you&#39;ve &quot;accidently&quot; killed one too many<br/>
&gt; sacred fish or annoying halflings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shadowknight<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: Clarity and save it from villagers with pitchforks<br/>
&gt; and torches.<br/>
&gt; Pro: Decent fighting ability, nasty one shot DD, can summon its own<br/>
&gt; pet, few if any ethical hangups.<br/>
&gt; Cons: Will sell you out to villagers with pitchforks and torches, few<br/>
&gt; if any ethical hangups.<br/>
&gt; The shadowknight pet is the very definition of a double-edged sword.<br/>
&gt; Handy in a fight and utterly ruthless, it may trip you up trying to<br/>
&gt; elbow its way out the door to the zone exit. Their best use is for<br/>
&gt; activities too repulsive for paladins but too tough for rangers. Never<br/>
&gt; turn your back on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bards<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: An audience.<br/>
&gt; Pros: Mana song make Enchanters feel like they have Clarity.<br/>
&gt; Cons: It&#39;s a bard.<br/>
&gt; The bard pet is mostly useful for enhancing other pets. Otherwise they<br/>
&gt; run too fast, tend to aggro everything in hearing range and clutter up<br/>
&gt; your text buffer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rogues<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: It will choose it own components.<br/>
&gt; Pros: Able to enter wretched hives of scum and villainy (Felwithe,<br/>
&gt; Rivervale, etc.).<br/>
&gt; Cons: Have an aggressive form of &quot;/autosplit others&quot;.<br/>
&gt; The Rogue pet is your ultimate stealth pet. When you need to get into<br/>
&gt; and out of hostile territory without having your pet aggro everything<br/>
&gt; in sight, summon a rogue. They seldom cause trains and gods save any<br/>
&gt; mob that turns its back on a rogue pet to smash your beautiful face.<br/>
&gt; It is generally unwise to accept food or drink from rogue pets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Necromancers<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: Phat l00t.<br/>
&gt; Pros: Just ask, they&#39;ll tell you about them for hours.<br/>
&gt; Cons: Talk in an arcane argot called d00dspeak (and you thought gnoll<br/>
&gt; was bad).<br/>
&gt; One of the most powerful pets available to you but also the hardest to<br/>
&gt; summon. The necromancer pet is virtually self-sufficient to the point<br/>
&gt; of not even needing you. Use this pet to kill other people&#39;s pets,<br/>
&gt; break spawns or make you feel really inadequate. They may challenge<br/>
&gt; you to a duel, sometimes even during a pull.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wizards<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: Clarity and flammable targets.<br/>
&gt; Pros: Your own personal nuclear arsenal.<br/>
&gt; Cons: Fragile, they make rangers seem robust.<br/>
&gt; If you like quick brutal fights with long down times then the wizard<br/>
&gt; pet is for you. Best for eliminating that singular uber-mob in a loud,<br/>
&gt; colorful fashion, the wizard pet is a self driven auto-cannon with<br/>
&gt; fire-and-forget capability. They are death<br/>
&gt; machines right up until a mob actually gets close enough to lay<br/>
&gt; hands/claws/fangs upon it or they go &quot;oom&quot;. Then wizards tend to die.<br/>
&gt; Fast. They also make great taxis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Magicians<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: Clarity and patience.<br/>
&gt; Pros: Wal-Mart in a robe.<br/>
&gt; Cons: Slow recast time after link death.<br/>
&gt; While the magician pet can summon additional &quot;lesser&quot; pets and deal<br/>
&gt; out direct damage spells, perhaps its best use is as your own private<br/>
&gt; supply wagon. Need food and drink? The mage summons it. Need more<br/>
&gt; bandages? Tap the mage. Magic weapons for newbie pets? You know who.<br/>
&gt; It is best if you allow your magician pet to summon an elemental pet<br/>
&gt; as this will extend its lifespan by an order of magnitude. Besides the<br/>
&gt; mob will then have to chew through two pets to get to you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Druid<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: Clarity and a donation to Green Peace.<br/>
&gt; Pros: As ranger without actually being a ranger.<br/>
&gt; Cons: Fleas.<br/>
&gt; The druid pet is &quot;the&quot; outdoors specialist. Curiously, a druid pet<br/>
&gt; fights best while running away which is a tactic that takes a little<br/>
&gt; getting use to. Not recommended for Enchanters with heart or lung<br/>
&gt; problems. The druid is marvelously self-sufficient but not as<br/>
&gt; annoyingly so as the necromancer. They are also great for travel. Need<br/>
&gt; to get to some godsforsaken spot on Norrath? There is probably a druid<br/>
&gt; ring within a zone or two of it. A word of caution, if you enjoy<br/>
&gt; killing bears, wolves, and treants then letting a druid transport you<br/>
&gt; can turn into a one-way trip.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shaman<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: Clarity and a donation to the &quot;magical herb fund&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Pros: They&#39;re not bards.<br/>
&gt; Cons: Always pawing through something&#39;s entrails trying to divine<br/>
&gt; lotto numbers.<br/>
&gt; The shaman pet is the pet you summon to enhance other pets. A shaman<br/>
&gt; excels at making your other pets stronger, faster and tougher. It can<br/>
&gt; also cast some offensive spells and even fight if pressed. And it does<br/>
&gt; it without being a bard. It also can create potions that duplicate the<br/>
&gt; more useful spells or just see and hear cool colors. Be watchful of<br/>
&gt; their pets as they may try to bury your wand or rod in the backyard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cleric<br/>
&gt; Components Needed: Clarity and a donation to the local temple.<br/>
&gt; Pros: Your own personal M*A*S*H.<br/>
&gt; Cons: Chance of a jihad.<br/>
&gt; The cleric pet is another great support pet. It has incredible healing<br/>
&gt; abilities and can generally cure all that ails you. A good choice when<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re going after undead or attacking a leper colony. When summoning<br/>
&gt; a cleric pet one should be mindful of which god the cleric pet<br/>
&gt; represents as this can make the difference between receiving the<br/>
&gt; blessings of a higher power or eternal damnation or both.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Monk<br/>
&gt; Components Need: Celerity and seven divine truths.<br/>
&gt; Pros: Low maintenance, self repairing.<br/>
&gt; Cons: Has a tendency to faint during bad pulls.<br/>
&gt; The monk pet is ideal for Enchanters who travel light. One seldom has<br/>
&gt; to equip a monk pet and it will actually complain if you give it too<br/>
&gt; much coin. For the quick, surgical strike summon a monk pet. The monk<br/>
&gt; is also extremely handy if you need wooden boards or bricks cut in<br/>
&gt; two.<br/>
