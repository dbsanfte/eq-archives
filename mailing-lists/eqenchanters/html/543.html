<div id="ygrps-yiv-176102004">Kill stealing is not &quot;illegal.&quot; It&#39;s a fact of life in the game.<br/>
Although I do hope they change the way looting is handled.<br/>
<br/>
I have a warrior type character that fights in Crushbone. I start a<br/>
fight and take all the damage from Orcs only to have a mage blast the<br/>
orc with 2 spells that do 80 points damage each and kills it. He then<br/>
gets the loot and exp. That&#39;s wrong.  It should be a combination of who<br/>
takes most of the damage and does the most damage. Something needs<br/>
changed<br/>

agreed. you did the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
case in point of petitioning:<br/>
<br/>
a few nights ago on cazic-thule, a lvl 13 bard named Reverith was<br/>
training<br/>
Sand Giants in North Ro. he&#39;d grab 2 of them, and have them chase him<br/>
all<br/>
over North Ro. he would either zone or die every time, but not until<br/>
after<br/>
he trained the giants onto dozens of people. i beleive 30 or 40 people<br/>
petitioned about it, and i havent seen him on since.<br/>
<br/>
another issue i&#39;ve had is with kill stealing. one player constantly<br/>
steals<br/>
kills from me. he just plain doesnt like me, and i believe it was<br/>
because i<br/>
shouted he was a kill thief (after he tried to steal one of my kills,<br/>
then<br/>
challenged me to a duel which i did not accept, after which he promptly<br/>
stole my next kill). from that time on he&#39;s decided to steal any kill i<br/>
am<br/>
getting while i solo and he is around. i petitioned it but to no avail.<br/>
so<br/>
the only thing i can do is wait till one day when he needs help, and i<br/>
can<br/>
watch him die =)<br/>

&gt;You did the right thing. If he wants all the critters to himself<br/>
&gt;he needs to be playing Baldur&#39;s Gate. Unfortunately, some <br/>
&gt;people don&#39;t have what&#39;s called &#39;da social skilz&#39;. That&#39;s why<br/>
&gt;they don&#39;t have no friends.. &#39;cept for their mamas...<br/>

&gt;Couldn&#39;t resist pulling that line from &#39;The Waterboy&#39;.. hehe..<br/>
