<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342398889">Folks, I thought we all had this quoting thing down. Only quote the message<br/>
you are reffering to, not a whole digest. Just paged through a novel for 3<br/>
messages that took tops one page of writing. Enchanters are the thinking<br/>
persons class, please show this fact when you post and keep the digests down<br/>
to a novellete not novel sized. Thanks.<br/>
