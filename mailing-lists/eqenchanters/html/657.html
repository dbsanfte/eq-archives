<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032889191">Just a warning to those folks in the qeynos area.  There is a Dark Elf<br/>
rogue that ppears in the newbie zone at night there that is blue to lvl<br/>
12 folks. Seems like the right thing to do to get rid of this guy,<br/>
right? Dark Elf, Rogue, night, hehe. when killed however, this guy<br/>
lowers your faction stance with the Guards and merchants of High Hold!<br/>
Not sure how bad, cause I havent gone back to the keep yet, but I am<br/>
sure it wont be good.</div>
