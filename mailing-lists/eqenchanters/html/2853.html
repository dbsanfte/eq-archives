<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171296557">You get the Nitrates from a guy in Surfall and give them to the zookeeper in<br/>
the Akaon zoo.<br/>
This works great for the kolandi quest but helps if you have a friend Druid<br/>
who can teleport you to Steamfont and both bind in Surefall.<br/>
The tonic is lore so you can only have one.<br/>
Halfling illusion is in the guildhall in Erudin.<br/>
Languid Pace helps your Roots last longer because htey save less often.<br/>
Tashan helps there too since htey have a lower save.</div>
