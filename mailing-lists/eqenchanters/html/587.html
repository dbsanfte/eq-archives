&gt;Mesmerization a research spell? I have it now, bought it in Ak&#39;Anon,<br/>
&gt;very useful spell btw, not many people really understand it.<br/>

&gt;It does two things, stuns a mob for about 30 seconds or until it takes<br/>
&gt;DAMAGE, very important there as you can still debuff the mob without<br/>
&gt;taking off the stun effect. Secondly, and most importantly, it ERASES a<br/>
&gt;mobs hate list at the moment its cast. Think about it.<br/>
&gt;I use it for soloing yellows all the time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All correct except wrog spell, you are refering to the lvl 4 spell called<br/>
mesmerize. The lvl 16 spell called mesmerization is believed to be a<br/>
research spell. IT is an area attack version of mesmerize.<br/>
