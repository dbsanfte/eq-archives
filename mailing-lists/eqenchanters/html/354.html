<div id="ygrps-yiv-38207938">You can transfer items between two (or more) of your characters by one of<br/>
two ways.  Note, some consider this twinking and a bad thing.  You can use a<br/>
friend as a go between or just find an out of the way spot like a room at an<br/>
inn.  Bring both of your charcters there.  Then have one character drop the<br/>
goodies on the floor.  Quickly camp and bring your other character on and<br/>
pick up the items.  If more than one item you can just drop them all on the<br/>
ground (usually shows as one little bag but they&#39;re all there) or put in<br/>
container and drop container.  Not sure how long items dropped hang around<br/>
but they do hang around long enough to make a switch of characters.  Down<br/>
side is if someone comes by and sees the bag on the ground while you&#39;re in<br/>
between characters, they may help themselves to it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that you can give /consent to a player not currently in the game,<br/>
making the possibility of having one of your characters loot another of your<br/>
character&#39;s corpse.  I don&#39;t know if this is possible or not.<br/>

&gt;how do you transfer items between charecters then? dont you have to log off<br/>
&gt;with one to log in with the other?<br/>
&gt;or are you using a friend for this?<br/>
