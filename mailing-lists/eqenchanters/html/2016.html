<div id="ygrps-yiv-143854609">Hail there fellow enchanters (especially you gnomish ones)!<br/>
<br/>
Recently I have been attempting to complete the quest in the temple for the enchanter gloves, and I thought i&#39;d see if anyone here has completed it.  I&#39;ve picked up the radiant gloves from cazic thule, which was a lot easier than I expected (people often shout that radiant is dead in the hall and he&#39;s got the gloves).  I know that if I camp the shadowmen in west commons long enough I&#39;ll get the shadow gloves... as long as they dont kill me too many times.  I&#39;m only 29 after all...  The other two pairs I hear I can buy from gypsies in lavastorm, so thats not a big issue (I hope).  <br/>
<br/>
Now, the problem.  When given the quest, a bloodstone from tarn vislin is mentioned.  Now you probably know tarn... he&#39;s the guy in high keep that sells the enchanter pets.  Well, he doesnt sell bloodstones.  When hailed he says &quot;Hi there!  I&#39;m tarn vislin, nice to meet you&#39; or something useless like that.  NOW, do I need to get this bloodstone, or is it just added to the quest to throw us off?<br/>
