<div><font size="2">I agree with you about the difference between mez and 
lull.&nbsp; But from what I&#39;ve seen, lull will usualy aggro the mob that resists 
it, resulting in all his buddies comming after you too.&nbsp;However, if he 
doesn&#39;t resist, neither he nor any of his buddies will aggro.&nbsp; Mez, on the 
other hand, will make the guy you targeted stand there, but all his buddies will 
come flying.&nbsp; Also, as long as you don&#39;t cast anything on the mezed 
creature after you mez it (including DoTs beforehand), the mind wipe is usually 
quite reliable.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><br><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Mez is basically a stun type 
  spell.</font> <br><font face="sans-serif" size="2">However it is a stun that lasts 
  longer then other stuns but breaks the moment the critter takes damage.</font> 
  <br><font face="sans-serif" size="2">You can use Mez to then debuff the target 
  while they just stand there but once it wears off they usually come after 
  you.</font> <br><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Sometimes MEz will wipe the hate 
  list from the target and if your out of agro range they will just wander off. 
  &nbsp;This happens more often with the lower level creatures. &nbsp;It is a 
  4th level spell after all.</font> <br><br><font face="sans-serif" size="2">The 
  lull line, last I heard were not supposed to agro the target on a resist most 
  of the time. &nbsp;It was just something that is to happen once in 
  awhile.</font> <br><font face="sans-serif" size="2">I have not used it in a long 
  time as I rarely play and when I do I rarely camp.</font> <br><font
 face="sans-serif" size="2">However I have cast it several times on creatures. 
  &nbsp;The problem with the spell is it narrows the aggro range but does not 
  eliminate it so nearby critters will still come. &nbsp;Also it is a short 
  duration spell.</font> <br><font face="sans-serif" size="2">However if it works 
  then you pull the others in the camp and are far enough away the guy you 
  lulled will not come after you, even after lull wears off.</font> <br><font
 face="sans-serif" size="2">With Mez he most likely will come.</font> <br><br><font

 size="2">&gt;<br>&gt;Basically, if you need to break a camp where the critters 
  are close<br>&gt;together, use mez and memblur, or get a bard, druid, or 
  ranger to do<br>&gt;it while you take care of any messes if they 
  fail.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has been my experience that 
  you have to lull (sooth, calm) the mobs<br>&gt;&gt; farthest away fist. If an 
  agro mob runs past on the has been soothed the<br>&gt;&gt; sooth wears of and 
  they both come<br>&gt;<br>This post comes at just the right time. &nbsp;Last 
  night myself and a paly were<br>working the gobbie camp in BB near dagnors. 
  &nbsp;Tring to mez the gobbies got<br>resisted consistantly. &nbsp;I was 
  wondering if maybe I should have used lull.<br>As I also play a ranger I have 
  used harmany alot and love it. From my<br>reading it seems mez is a form of 
  lull that lasts longer and works in<br>combat. &nbsp;Am I wrong in this? 
  &nbsp;<br><br>It is quite the rush when it gets busy mezing and telling the 
  paly what to<br>hit and what to leave alone. &nbsp;I think I&#39;m finally getting 
  how to use Mez.<br>Still need lots of practice but thanks for the advice 
  offered so far.<br><br>Ulgarth &nbsp;
