<div id="ygrps-yiv-23464858">Wisps are still blue at 13, so Eurids Crossing is a good zone, as well as East<br/>
and West Commons.<br/>
Bandits in West Karana, or raiders in a full group (N Karana)<br/>
Dervs are camped, but plentiful.  I much prefer bandits.<br/>
Smugglers in the Qeynos Sewers are tailor made for Enchanters.  Loot&#39;s not<br/>
great though.  If you get a party, hit the shark pit right next door.<br/>
Greater Skellies on the undead island (OOT) are fantastic experience and worth<br/>
1-5gp per shot.  I have not encountered one that wasn&#39;t level 13, and I&#39;ve<br/>
killed about 20 of them so far.  Your Exp bar will visiblely move each kill.<br/>
I heard Aqua Gobs in OOT are good loot as well.<br/>
If you have a magic weapon, try Lavastorm in a group.<br/>
<br/>
So many places to hunt, so little time.  Hope this helps.</div>
