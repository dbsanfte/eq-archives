<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176476053">I can say that I have travelled all the way from North Felwithe to South<br/>
Qeynos without losing any items. I didn&#39;t take the scenic route, so I can&#39;t<br/>
say anything about zones not on a straight-line path between the two<br/>
destinations.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; i was looking through some of my links on enchanter sites when i found<br/>
&gt; this passage<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; &quot;In other news: Yes, the new jewelry patch is everything we could have<br/>
&gt; asked for, BUT.  I highly recommend you be careful selling and crafting<br/>
&gt; items.  Magical items crafted under the new patch WILL vanish if you enter<br/>
&gt; certain zones.  Qnos is one of these areas, I have no doubt there are<br/>
&gt; others.  Craft at your own risk, and I do advise you notify everyone you<br/>
&gt; sell to to be careful where they go.&quot;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; this is disturbing news, and perhaps a flaw? or not true, has anyone<br/>
&gt; experienced this problem? or know anything about it?<br/>
