<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969517488">I&#39;ve done it 4 times and will do it again twice tonight.  This is to replace <br/>
the 4 I sold or traded, will have one for myself and one for the druid who is <br/>
helps me gather the ingredients.<br/>
The 4 steins have really raked in untold riches, by my count 4000 platinum, a <br/>
pair of dwarven workboots, Shimmering orb, the list goes on and on.  <br/>
<br/>
After doing it 4 times I decided to go to kaladim and see how my faction <br/>
decline was progressing.  I found the guards glowered at me dubiously <br/>
including the king himself.  I went out to the chessboard, ruins, etc and <br/>
bought 90 bone chips for 1g each from the people hunting and turned them in a <br/>
few at a time to improve my faction.  After that, the king regarded me <br/>
indifferently but the guards still regarded me dubiously.  What if another <br/>
new quest pops up that requires us to go to Kaladim?  I don&#39;t want to think <br/>
about it.  After I get the 2 steins tonight I will charge 2000 platinum to <br/>
complete the quest for someone provided they gather the ingredients <br/>
themselves.   For weeks i&#39;m gonna save up bonechips till I have about 300 and <br/>
go back to turn them in if the guy deals with me anymore.  Hell, i&#39;m not even <br/>
sure if its worth 2000 plat for the hits anymore....<br/>
