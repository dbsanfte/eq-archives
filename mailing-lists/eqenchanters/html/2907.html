<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847349346">I would stick with LoIO. On the South zone wall near the Sarnak Fortress is<br/>
a tower with 4 goblin warriors or warlords in it. While facing the south<br/>
wall and looking at the tower from the hill (which is a roaming path for<br/>
Sarnak Recruits, Icebones, and Gobbies so do not fight there) to the left is<br/>
a small leveled area up a bit on the hill. This is a prefect pull-to spot. I<br/>
have seen people pull to the stones along the wall base, but when they run,<br/>
they run straight to the tower, and wandering Sarnak and Gobbies run<br/>
&quot;through&quot; that tower and agro onto you as well. Lots of PC corpses all over<br/>
down there once. =(<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my wife and I went from 26 to 29 down there at that one spot in a<br/>
week. Sarnak Recruits are 23 to 26 I believe, so you should do great there.<br/>
They wander across the valley floor and across the hill opposite you. No<br/>
need to wander very far even with the zone at 80+ people.<br/>
<br/>
Stick it out, you will be much happier once you level. The xp cannot be<br/>
beat. I was bored to tears, but the rest of Kunark is not solo friendly for<br/>
the 25-33 range. Roughly. Frontier mountains was a fun zone but VERY<br/>
dangerous because of all the wandering mobs.<br/>
<br/>
Warsilks Woods. I hate this zone.<br/>
<br/>
Dalnir&#39;s Crypt. Great zone for a good group. Will get you to 35ish easy.<br/>
Only problem is getting there through Warsilks Woods. You will understand<br/>
why if you ever try to get there. Loot is good to.<br/>
<br/>
I made 30th in Ak&#39;Anon on the Cargo Clockwork. Pull it with a spiderling or<br/>
clockwork spider, and you will not get any interfeerence from the nearby<br/>
gnomes. The Cargo is 30th level every time and runs as if snared and is an<br/>
easy kite and will give you enought time to summon a pet. It hits for a max<br/>
of 77, and can hit pretty fast. MR isn&#39;t too bad, my druid at 29 would be<br/>
almost oom when it would die. Not sure if you can kite it as a Chanter, but<br/>
worth a try. When is dies, a driver pops out, but he does not agro on you.<br/>
Do not kill him as it is a big Gnome hit. You want to do the FA quest,<br/>
right? Heh.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting.<br/>

Subject: [eqenchanters] Hunting at 24, bored with Lake<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although lake of Ill omen is great exp, I am bored rotten with the place.<br/>
Time to go back to the mainland for awhile I&#39;m thinking, but where should an<br/>
enchanter at 24 go? Where can I hunt where we enchanters can find a group<br/>
yet I can still solo while waiting?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Dan<br/>
