<div id="ygrps-yiv-58445523">I have made 5 so far, sold 4.  Wear it on your face and broadcast every hour <br/>
a price of 220 to 250pp, It will sell eventually and make more than all of <br/>
your other jewelry sales combined.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful though and look at your connection before clicking that combine <br/>
button.  The other day I clicked the button and was disconnected a <br/>
millisecond after.  When I logged back in I was out the components and alas, <br/>
no veil.  I realize I may have failed and not seen the message but who knows. <br/>
I had a 102 skill at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Also, don&#39;t get your metals mixed up.  If you are making lots of electrum <br/>
make darn sure you put a silver bar in your kit.  I accidentally put an <br/>
electrum bar in and somehow suceeded with my 102 skill.  Thank god I suceeded <br/>
because if I had failed I might have done the same thing again!  That was 5 <br/>
days ago and I still haven&#39;t been able to sell the thing, I&#39;m wearing it <br/>
around because it is a *Very* nice item, no matter what your class.  Anybody <br/>
know a fair price for these? I&#39;m askin 250pp but who knows it may be a little <br/>
low.<br/>
