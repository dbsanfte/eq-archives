<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821599576">I was about to say..  The dias that the Preacher and Placeholder spawn on my<br/>
cause you problems.  Maybe you&#39;re getting the &quot;You cannot see your target.&quot;<br/>
message?  I&#39;ve used Mesmerization from a loooong way off.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll definately do that. :)  It might have been the hilly terrain I was on<br/>
&gt; interferring with the distance factor.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve been breaking the spawn in the preacher room good enough that the<br/>
&gt; preacher (when and if he spawns) is usually up there alone when he spawns.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s the fun pulls from back stage, and the other rooms around us that<br/>
&gt; sometimes get a little big. :)  I suppose I could back up toward the stage<br/>
&gt; a bit for those though..  I&#39;ll play with it a bit more and see how it<br/>
&gt; goes. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the help!! :)<br/>
