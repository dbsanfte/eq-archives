<b>Subject:</b> fun with charm <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-705046618">for those of you who use charm more often then our little pet. try this next<br/>
time.<br/>
charm a creature that can weild a weapon. after the creature is charmed,<br/>
take a rusty weapon out of<br/>
your inventory (if you have one) and give it to your newly charmed<br/>
creature... it will appear in his hands, and he will use it to fight with. I<br/>
just find this fun :) so i thought i would share it with all of you<br/>
