<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223096613">There is one shaman, can&#39;t remember where off the top of my head, that <br/>
doesn&#39;t like agnostic people in illusion... only one I&#39;ve found- it <br/>
wasn&#39;t all that fun getting...  I died in about 20 seconds.  He&#39;s not <br/>
around any of the quest MOBs or food/supply merchants.<br/>
