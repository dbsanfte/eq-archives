Okie, take this with a grain of salt, becasue I haven&#39;t verified it..<br/>
<br/>
Talking to an enchanter friend of mine over the water-cooler at work, and<br/>
he gave me the following info about a gemcutter that he borrowed.<br/>
<br/>
Take one gem (he was using rubies), with it in the cursor right click on<br/>
the gemcutter.<br/>
The gem should now be &quot;A fine ruby&quot; (or whatever)<br/>
Combine the fine ruby as you would any other gem + metal ( he was making<br/>
plat ruby veils)<br/>
Aparently the fine gems make the same items as the regular one, but have a<br/>
lower trivial and therefore higher success rate..<br/>
<br/>
Should be easy enough to verify, as it&#39;s not destructive and doesnt involve<br/>
combing the gemcutter with anything, and you can always try with a cheap<br/>
gem.. Anyone got one in the bank?<br/>

Time to go and support your friendly neighborhood tinker, me thinks :)<br/>
