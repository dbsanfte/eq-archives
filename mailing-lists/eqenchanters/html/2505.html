<br/>
Do the spectre fighting in the oasis, on the lake side closest to the south<br/>
ro zone.  I dont know how well this will work in other areas.  Take bat<br/>
wings with you (or illusion air elemental), you need to levitate.  Of<br/>
course, get as ready as you can with buffs and get your charisma as HIGH as<br/>
it will go(mine is normally around 180), and its best if you can get a SoW<br/>
though it isnt needed really (every little bit helps though, but I do it all<br/>
the time without).<br/>
<br/>
The Pull : pull as only an enchanter can... get close to the spectre island,<br/>
and tashani the nearest spectre.  A whole lot of them will come, if the<br/>
island is fully spawned expect at least 3 and as many as 6 or 7.  I havent<br/>
been able to solo more than 5 yet but I&#39;m still trying!  Run back to the<br/>
spot on the lakeshore closest to Sro zone.<br/>
<br/>
The Fight : Making sure you have the lead spectre targetted, enthrall it as<br/>
soon as it hits land (this takes some practice).  one down.  as the rest of<br/>
them come closer to you, run over the &#39;ditch&#39; to the second hill.  The<br/>
spectres cant float across so it takes them more time to get to you.  I can<br/>
enthrall 2 more as they go thru the ditch.  Hopefully you&#39;re down to 2<br/>
spectres coming for you.  Go over the hill and run over the second &#39;ditch&#39;.<br/>
Use the same method that you used on the first &#39;ditch&#39;, charm one (you<br/>
should have plenty of time).  Run STRAIGHT at the uncharmed one and let it<br/>
hit you as you run past it, to get your new pet angry at it.  They will<br/>
fight, and this is a good time to go and re-enthrall the first spectre you<br/>
enthralled.  I usually run back to near the fight to make sure my pet is<br/>
winning.  The remainder of the fight is all about timing.  Once the first<br/>
spectre dies, enthrall your pet and then wait for the next spectre to wake<br/>
up and charm it.    Send it after your previous pet(which is likely almost<br/>
dead so its a short fight), and reenthrall the first spectre you enthralled.<br/>
There may be a angry spectre chasing after you now, but you have a handy<br/>
spectre pet that is quite healthy, so get them fighting.  Make sure your pet<br/>
wins this fight, and when he does, enthrall him and let him heal to halfway<br/>
or even more.  You&#39;re down to 2 spectres now, and you want them to have a<br/>
close fight, as you&#39;re probably getting quite low on mana.  Meditate until<br/>
one of the spectres wakes up, and charm him.  Then the spectres fight, and<br/>
you make sure your pet wins.  Enthrall your pet, and meditate until you have<br/>
enough mana to nuke it to death.<br/>
<br/>
The Strategy : 1.  Learn to use the &#39;ditch&#39;!  You can always get a ways<br/>
ahead of spectres using the ditches(dunes, I guess) in the oasis.  Sometimes<br/>
you have to use both ditches to get enough space between you and the<br/>
spectres to charm, but I&#39;ve found that I have enough time to cast &#39;cajoling<br/>
whispers&#39; as soon as they are in range if they have to go thru the ditch.<br/>
                      2.  Learn to love charm!  If you think the fight is<br/>
taking too long, dont be afraid to re-charm your pet.  If it resists its<br/>
still your pet so there is no fear of breaking the charm yourself, but a<br/>
short charm will force you to fall back on strategy 1 a lot more often.<br/>
                      3.  Dont be afraid to run away!  It took me many<br/>
(game) days of practice (and several deaths) to get good at doing this....<br/>
dont expect to be able to do it right the first time.  Its also common<br/>
courtesy to inform anyone near you of what you&#39;re doing, so that they dont<br/>
a)get killed or b)&#39;help out&#39; by taking away your spectres or waking one up<br/>
that is particularily mad at you.  You&#39;ll gain back any experience you lose<br/>
once you get good at this, so dont be TOO edgy, but its usually pretty<br/>
obvious when you are in over your head.<br/>
<br/>
The Spells :<br/>
Tashani - No explaination needed, any time you&#39;re going to do damage, use it<br/>
Color Flux - Good for getting those extra 3 steps ahead of anything<br/>
Enthrall - Most mana efficient mes spell IMHO<br/>
Entrance - A few extra seconds of sleepy MoBs never hurts<br/>
Immobilize - for the wizard in all of us, and handy on the last spectre<br/>
Cajoling Whispers - A charming spell, use your best for the lasting pets<br/>
Chase the Moon - Uh oh, here come 3 spectres but I only wanted 2<br/>
Anarchy - Die Die Die<br/>
<br/>
Any comments on my strategy here are welcome... this works fine for me, and<br/>
has since level 40.  Me and another enchanter often take turns doing this<br/>
late at night, and between us there arent enough spectres to go around :)<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>

&gt; I read the post about soloing 5 spectres and was intrigued.  please let me<br/>
&gt; hear your strategy Cogg.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. Enchanters cant do near as much damage as wizzards, necros or nearly<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; for reasons outlined in previous post.  Just wanted to add what a huge<br/>
taunt<br/>
&gt; our damage spells accutually are.  It is a penalty for casting them.  Its<br/>
&gt; just not the purpose of an enchanter or even a good enchanter strategy<br/>
