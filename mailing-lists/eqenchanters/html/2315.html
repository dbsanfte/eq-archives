<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018454538">Ok, here are my findings as well..<br/>
My skill is 200, when making items with plat, I ALWAYS buff my wis, so far<br/>
my current buffed wis is 151. Do note, I haven&#39;t focused on keeping my int<br/>
buffed max vs. my wis.  I recently have made some  very hard items, my<br/>
failure rate was less than 20% and in some cases 0% failure (depending on<br/>
each gem). In additional buffs, I always buff every stat I can (being a<br/>
level 50 Enchanter we get a couple). Now dont get me wrong, some days, I<br/>
cant make a plat sapphire necklace to save my life. Usually I&#39;ll zone after<br/>
3-5 tries and try again in the next zone, this usually breaks the bad run<br/>
on luck, or whatever. The bottom line, least to me, wis does play a part,<br/>
but so do ALL of our stats, Im sure. <br/>
Also, along the same lines in another subject, I&#39;ve herd a CHA of 130+ is<br/>
when charm really kicks in. So, if the same applies to wis, it would stand<br/>
to reason, we shouldn&#39;t see much if any with a wis of 130 or less.</div>
