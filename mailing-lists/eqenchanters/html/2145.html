Here Ye! Here Ye! The Suicide Charm of Death!<br/>
<br/>
If you want to seriously destroy everything in your path charm a lava beetle<br/>
and give it swift like the wind.  Quad attacks for 90 to 120 each.  The only<br/>
problem is you die instantly once the charm wears off so try and let beetle<br/>
monster die in combat.<br/>
<br/>
Good fun if you have some exp to waste.<br/>

&gt; Maybe I can help answer this one with some hearsay and rumors that appear<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be true.  I&#39;ve played with charm quite a bit.  Not the Enchanter charm,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; the druid version that only works against animals.  My other char is a<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; 26 druid and I used charm quite a bit from level 14-18 (before I found<br/>
&gt; Lavastorm)  Anyways...those are my credentials and here&#39;s my findings:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Charisma modifier only affects the initial charm.  *cast charm* [EQ<br/>
&gt; checks charisma] *charm holds*  Charm has about 4 settings...ultra short<br/>
&gt; (less than 5 seconds)...short (20 seconds)...medium (4-5<br/>
minutes)...looooong<br/>
&gt; (10-15 minutes).  The level of the mob in relation to the caster seems to<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; a factor (green mobs are easier to charm and hold longer).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, you ask, what the hell good is a mob that is 4 levels below what I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; trying to fight?  Gather round friends because here is the answer:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Buffs/debuffs<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you look at the druid spell list...level 19 (one rank above charm<br/>
&gt; animals), they receive a spell called Feral Spirit.  This is a pet buff<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; is supposed to help make your pet fight a bit above what it could<br/>
normally.<br/>
&gt; This isn&#39;t to give you an advantage in an &#39;even&#39; fight...this is to make<br/>
&gt; that &#39;even&#39; fight possible.  Enchanters are blessed with buffs that do<br/>
even<br/>
&gt; more than this to help out their weak charmed pet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can see all of the raised hands ready to ask, &quot;Why in the heck would I<br/>
&gt; charm a monster to fight when I can summon my pet?&quot;  Okay...this is part<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the hearsay that I was talking about.  Your summoned pet will take a piece<br/>
&gt; of the action for itself.  A charmed pet doesn&#39;t (as far as I know).  You<br/>
&gt; can use a charmie to help you get 2 or 3 other kills and then when your<br/>
&gt; charmie is low and ready to die...release it (/pet as you were) and kill<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; for full xp!  A charmed pet will also respond to /pet commands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyways...I hope this helps answer a few question about charm that might<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; out there.  I&#39;m totally open to any feedback on this...this is just what<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard here and there and what I&#39;ve been able to figure out myself<br/>
using<br/>
&gt; charm animals as a druid...<br/>
