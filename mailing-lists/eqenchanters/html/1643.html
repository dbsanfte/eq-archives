<b>Subject:</b> Enchanting items <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-183895058">As far as enchanting items, we won&#39;t know until we see it.  They had some<br/>
Enchantment of brilliance spells which were supposed to make the item give<br/>
off light.  I&#39;d like to see a level 8 or level 12 spell which temporarily<br/>
makes a weapon able to hit magical creatures.  We have a damage shield spell<br/>
(Feedback) so I doubt if that would be an enchantment (unless it was lower<br/>
level).  Any old school D&D players remember the spell &quot;Permanence&quot;?  Make<br/>
that a level 44 or 49 spell so our temporary weapon enchantments would last<br/>
forever.  It would be neat to make a sword flame temporarily and give extra<br/>
damage.  I wonder if we&#39;d have to hold the weapon as we cast the spell.  All<br/>
we know now is that it will be done, but I honestly have no clue what will<br/>
actually be implemented.<br/>
