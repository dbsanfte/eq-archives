<b>Subject:</b> whirl <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-807486502">I recently got the whirl spell...wow, great spell.  But, I was<br/>
wondering, what sorts of things make it break?  It never seems to<br/>
last very long, certainly much shorter than root does.  <br/>
I&#39;d like to know what actions to tell my group members not to do when<br/>
it is in effect, to make it last as long as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Does CF or Choke kill it?  What about wizard dd spells, bash, or monk<br/>
attacks?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
