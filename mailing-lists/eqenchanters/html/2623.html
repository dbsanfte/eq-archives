Subject: [eqenchanters] running speed<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the way i understand it agility has nothing to do with it (as long as your<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; hurt or encumbered that is) - it&#39;s the connection speed and most<br/>
importantly<br/>
&gt; your computer (including such things as CPU, videocard and RAM) - now for<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; experiences<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i have 4 accounts and 3 computers running off a cable modem - my computer<br/>
is a<br/>
&gt; celeron 450, 196 ram and voodoo3 - my roommate has a p2 300,  64 ram and a<br/>
rage<br/>
&gt; pro card - the third computer is a p2 200, 128ram and a pos video card<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i&#39;m a level 29 half elf bard - he&#39;s a level 31 half elf ranger - while<br/>
going<br/>
&gt; through the karanas i have to follow him or after a few mins he&#39;ll be out<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; range of my song and i&#39;ll leave him in the dust - now we decided to play<br/>
around<br/>
&gt; with it a little bit and when i log onto my account on his computer i<br/>
never lose<br/>
&gt; him but when i&#39;m on mine i have to watch him using 3rd person per and i<br/>
stop and<br/>
&gt; wait when i see my song pulse not hit him - now when i log on with the 3rd<br/>
&gt; computer i always have to wait and make sure i don&#39;t leave them behind so<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; usually just play on that computer and have my computer&#39;s char follow me<br/>
instead<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; now i know it&#39;s not lag as we&#39;re all running on the same network and since<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; switch computers to test a few things out my conclusion is that the only<br/>
things<br/>
&gt; that make people go faster is a better computer/connection - now i know<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; might not be enough evidence for everyone but it was enough to convience<br/>
both me<br/>
&gt; and my roommate but i dunno - maybe we&#39;re just weird<br/>
