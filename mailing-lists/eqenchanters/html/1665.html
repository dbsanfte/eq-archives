<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122013025">This used to be *the* way than they changed our lower level spells to<br/>
give partial resists. Heh, no offense, but I laugh when people whine<br/>
about how &quot;hard&quot; it got suddenly, I had to deal with that my whole<br/>
career =)<br/>

&gt; I recently hit level 16 with my enchanter, and got some great new spells<br/>
&gt; like Chase the Moon, Sanity Warp, etc...but I have noticed a drastic<br/>
&gt; increase in the frequency my spells are resisted. Green cons consistantly<br/>
&gt; resist Sanity Warp, the same monsters that I killed with Chaotic Feedback<br/>
&gt; when they were blue cons. I have begun using Tashan again (Ever since level<br/>
&gt; 10 or so, I stopped using it), and Tashan seems to help the situation. I<br/>
&gt; just think it is strange that I am having such a problem with monsters<br/>
&gt; resisting more powerful spells, when lesser spells seemed to work on them<br/>
&gt; great at lower levels. For instance, wisps now con green, but often resist<br/>
&gt; Sanity Warp. I was murdering wisps with Chaotic Feedback just two levels<br/>
&gt; ago. Same thing is happening with monsters I am just now starting to fight<br/>
&gt; alot, like crocs in the Oasis, undead in Unrest, and Borer and Scythe<br/>
&gt; Beetles in the Karanas. I am at a loss. Anyone else experience this kind of<br/>
&gt; thing?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t wait for Tashani...<br/>
