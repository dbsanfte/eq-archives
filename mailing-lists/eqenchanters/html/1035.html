<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-880214677">Ok, <br/>
<br/>
Being a newbie to the whole MUD/D&D/Everquest thing I rushed  online created a character and started playing.<br/>
<br/>
What I did not know about were the 20 bonus points that you can put into STR, STA, AGI DEX....<br/>
<br/>
Should I have been allowed to continue?<br/>
Were the places to put them chosen for me if I do not place them somewhere?<br/>
Can I go back and choose now?<br/>
Or am I now Zahlhedren the permenantly Crippled Enchanter of Norrath?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance...</div>
