Lets try the strike first and if that doesn&#39;t work then we do a petition<br/>
marathon. <br/>
But I ahve to say that if that is the attitudes of the Gm&#39;s I won&#39;t be<br/>
playing anymore anyway. <br/>

&gt;&gt;Verant Guy #1: 	Hmm, sure is quiet in here.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Verant Guy #2:  Yeah, all the enchanters are protesting by not playing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Verant Guy #1:  Really? We&#39;ll have to thank them later. Look! The<br/>
&gt;&gt;feedback list is cut in half today.  You sure this isnt&#39; a holiday?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Exactly.  This is the opposite of what we need to do, although I could be<br/>
&gt;wrong.  It seems as though they are working through improving the classes<br/>
&gt;by way of taking the most used classes first and saving the least used ones<br/>
&gt;last.  Think of how many /petitions they would get if the major Wizard bomb<br/>
&gt;spell wasnt working!  Or if Spirit of the Wind suddenly worked like Fear.<br/>
&gt;Give them time... I think the thing we must remember is BALANCE... they<br/>
&gt;must BALANCE the classes, and I&#39;m sure they are aware of this and know what<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re doing.  Hell, they MADE the game... i&#39;m sure they will FIX it<br/>
&gt;<br/>
