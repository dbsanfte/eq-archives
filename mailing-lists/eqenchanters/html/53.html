<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024748826">What kind of skill level does one need to do these stones?  I&#39;m at about<br/>
20, trained as much as I could, and haven&#39;t really had the money to<br/>
practice any more.  Money&#39;s been a pretty consistent problem for me.  I<br/>
think I may just be doing things wrong, but I&#39;m saving every gemstone I<br/>
snag from those earth elementals to try to keep going.<br/>
<br/>
Also, do the illusion spells always blink before they go down?  Or will<br/>
they drop unexpectedly like invisibility(very annoying)?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The following is what i have gatherd in my tavels :<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Emerald = fire protection<br/>
&gt; jade= mana<br/>
&gt; pearl= poison protection<br/>
&gt; periodot= cold protection<br/>
&gt; topaz= poison protection<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; if anyone knows of any others please let us all know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; also the strength of the item is related to the metal used (i.e. enchanted silver<br/>
&gt; grants +4 normally except with regards to the mana ring then it gives a +5 for<br/>
&gt; some reason)<br/>
