I didn&#39;t know about primary and secondary saving throws. I assumed for<br/>
cha dependant spells like mez, charm, lull, there was a single saving throw <br/>
that was based on your level, level of target, MR of target and your cha. You<br/>
are saying that there are two seperate throws ? Could you elaborate ?<br/>
<br/>
I understand that for variable duration spells, MOBs get a saving throw every<br/>
tick. For root, they additionally get a saving throw everytime damage is done.<br/>
For charm, I believe the saving throw is dependant on your cha. I&#39;ve<br/>
had the misfortune of having sympathetic aura fade during battle, and having<br/>
charm break almost immediately afterwards. I would guess that every tick, your<br/>
charmed pet looks at your cha and makes a saving throw, instead of just<br/>
remembering your cha when you first charmed it. Anybody confirm or deny ?<br/>
<br/>
Btw, some high level enchanters in my guild were questioning the role of cha, <br/>
since they see very little variation in resists over a large range of cha. But <br/>
at lvl 27, with cha 150, I certainly notice if sympathetic aura is missing. <br/>
Suddenly my AE mez is getting resisted by more than 1 lizard. Maybe this changes<br/>
at high levels ? Or maybe 140 is a break point of some sort ?<br/>
