&gt;Basically, if you need to break a camp where the critters are close<br/>
&gt;together, use mez and memblur, or get a bard, druid, or ranger to do<br/>
&gt;it while you take care of any messes if they fail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;      It has been my experience that you have to lull (sooth, calm) the mobs<br/>
&gt;&gt; farthest away fist. If an agro mob runs past on the has been soothed the<br/>
&gt;&gt; sooth wears of and they both come<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This post comes at just the right time.  Last night myself and a paly were<br/>
working the gobbie camp in BB near dagnors.  Tring to mez the gobbies got<br/>
resisted consistantly.  I was wondering if maybe I should have used lull.<br/>
As I also play a ranger I have used harmany alot and love it. From my<br/>
reading it seems mez is a form of lull that lasts longer and works in<br/>
combat.  Am I wrong in this?  <br/>
<br/>
It is quite the rush when it gets busy mezing and telling the paly what to<br/>
hit and what to leave alone.  I think I&#39;m finally getting how to use Mez.<br/>
Still need lots of practice but thanks for the advice offered so far.<br/>
