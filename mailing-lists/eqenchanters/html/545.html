<b>Subject:</b> Qyenos Merchant that sells tiny daggers? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-76809625">I have traveled for many days and nights, and fought off countless perils to reach the Human city of Qyenos. It it very different than my home city of Ak&#39;anon but I find myself drawn to explore and learn. Since I have decided to stay in Qyenos for a while I will need an animation to protect myself from the smelly gnolls. Can any fellow enchanters tell me the location of the merchant in Qyenos that will sell me tiny daggers?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Kindly<br/>
