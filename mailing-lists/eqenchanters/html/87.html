That&#39;s a shame if it&#39;s true but I think it will be addressed later.∩┐╜ So,<br/>
I&#39;ll keep on trucking.∩┐╜ I mainly started an enchanter to craft magical<br/>
jewelry but it&#39;s been fun so far.∩┐╜ Other classes have broken/dumb spells<br/>
by the way - many of my necro spells are broken or UTTERLY useless.∩┐╜<br/>
Sight graft - see through targets eyes - interesting but....<br/>
∩┐╜<br/>
I&#39;ve seen Tashan II in my travels∩┐╜ I know Tashan is supposed to lower<br/>
MOBs magic resistance so that might help more?<br/>

Hail and well met,<br/>
<br/>
I am a 7th level Enchanter working hard to raise my levels. I just<br/>
received<br/>
this from another mailing list I&#39;m subscribed to and must say that I am<br/>
a<br/>
little disheartened.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think - Eregil<br/>

&gt; OK, for all of you interested in trying an Enchanter .... don&#39;t.∩┐╜ At<br/>
least<br/>
&gt; not yet.∩┐╜ I am having so much frustration with this class I am on the<br/>
verge<br/>
&gt; of not playing it for a while.∩┐╜ Here&#39;s the highlights:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.∩┐╜ Spells are not correctly implemented i.e.∩┐╜ Sentinel is a spell<br/>
which<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; suppose to watch the area around an Enchanter while meditating,<br/>
&gt; unfortunately it lasts only 2-3 seconds.<br/>
&gt; 2. Even NPCs which are blue risky to me resist my spells (combat and<br/>
&gt; enchantment) on a 50/50 basis.∩┐╜ Gambles do it even more frequently.<br/>
&gt; 3. None of my spells ... not even enchanter only spells spells like<br/>
&gt; Mesmorize and Soothe work on anything that is Tomb to me, they are<br/>
resisted<br/>
&gt; 100% of the time, making me worthless in large groups 50% of the time!<br/>
&gt; 4. Current enchanter buff spells are a joke ... confirmed by many of<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; fellow enchanters whom have the same complaint.<br/>
&gt; 5. 12th level animation spell does not always summon a 12th level<br/>
animation<br/>
&gt; ... several times a 4th level pops in.<br/>
&gt; 6. No current plans to add Weapon or Armor enchanting spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sigh, I just spent 20mins in an Enchanter chat room and had my worst<br/>
fears<br/>
&gt; confirmed.∩┐╜ Enchanters who are over 17th level were stating they still<br/>
run<br/>
&gt; into the same frustrations as they did when they were 8th level.∩┐╜ The<br/>
old<br/>
&gt; hold out &quot;if I can just make it to the next spell ranking&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to<br/>
&gt; do any good.∩┐╜ Every one of them had the same level of frustration as<br/>
I.<br/>
All<br/>
&gt; of them stated they had fallen behind their friends and guild members<br/>
on a<br/>
&gt; level basis even though they had put in several more hours of game<br/>
play.<br/>
A<br/>
&gt; 21st level enchanter in the room, who just restarted as a cleric and<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; already 7th level, stated &quot;night and day difference&quot; between playing<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; different classes.∩┐╜ Now I am not complaing becuase I need to be a<br/>
&quot;power<br/>
&gt; character&quot;, but two somple facts remain: I cannot solo and groups<br/>
benefit<br/>
&gt; very little or, in the case of a large group fighting tomb monsters,<br/>
not<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; all.∩┐╜ Without some enhanced buffing spells or newer combat spells I am<br/>
&gt; afraid the majority of my contribution to the guild will be for<br/>
magical<br/>
&gt; jewelry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks, I needed to get this off my chest.<br/>

&gt; PS Nekoj it looks like your experience in Beta 4 with Enchanters has<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; changed for the first 8 levels - my guess is they never play balanced<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
