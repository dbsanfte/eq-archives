<b>Subject:</b> Finally 15 but where now? <br/>

<br/>
I finally reached lvl 15! but I am at a loss now. I have traveled far, from Erudin to Felwithe and currently hunt at the Sister camp in Lesser Faydark.<br/>
<br/>
For those that do not know, this is (well was until last patch) a great place for loot and exp. I started hunting there at 12th and made my way to 15th quickly and after buying all my spells I still have 150pp in the bank.<br/>
<br/>
Well now this place is too easy for me and need a better place to reach 16th preferably with good loot. I would like to solo to 16th but in safety. I hear you say, don&#39;t we all!<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas where I could find such a place/camp?<br/>
