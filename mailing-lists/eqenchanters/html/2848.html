<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938740463">Well, after the wonderful responces to my previous question, I have more for<br/>
you. =)<br/>
<br/>
1) Is an Agnostic DE Enchanter KoS in Erudin?<br/>
I was late getting beck to the office over lunch and had just received the<br/>
Erud&#39;s Tonic from the Erudite in the library using illusion Halfelf and<br/>
Alliance. I am &quot;parked&quot; in front of the illusion merchant on the 2nd floor<br/>
and bound at the wood bridge in NK.<br/>
<br/>
2) Where is illusion Halfling?<br/>
<br/>
2) Is it possible to chain cast WTYH while your pet kills a mob as you med<br/>
up to continue casting WTYH?<br/>
<br/>
3) Or is it safer to root, fear?<br/>
<br/>
4) Does Languid Pace effect movement rate of the mob when it is in &quot;run<br/>
mode&quot; or only attack speed?<br/>
<br/>
5) For the Coin of Tash:<br/>
	Do you only give the combined coin to the next npc(s) or do you need to<br/>
give them gold to?<br/>
	How much xp does it give at 12th level?<br/>
	Is it like all the Temple quests and gives no xp anymore or do you get xp<br/>
at each person the &quot;changes&quot; the coin?<br/>
<br/>
I will think up more as time passes. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
