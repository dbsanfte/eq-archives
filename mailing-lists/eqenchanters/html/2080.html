<div id="ygrps-yiv-2787496">At the bottom is a message I received from another list.  It details how to<br/>
complete the quest.  I takes me 4 hours or so to do.  Another good source<br/>
for info on most quests is www.everlore.com.  <br/>

See Gregor in the inn near the dock in east Freeport who wants some<br/>
items in exchange for a brewers book.  <br/>
<br/>
He will tell you to collect four items.  <br/>
<br/>
Some nuts from the Ocean of Tears.  They<br/>
are for sale on the first dock you come to for about 2gp.  <br/>
<br/>
Another item is Honey Jum from Rivervale.  Get three<br/>
honeycombs from Bixies, auctions, or merchants and give them with<br/>
30gp (3pp usually works) to the alchemist opposite the armoror<br/>
(the one with Mangler the dog) in RV.  She will give you the Honey<br/>
Jum.<br/>
<br/>
Off to Sunny Qeynos.  In the pool under the temple (flying saucer)<br/>
there is koalindl fish that you need to kill and get a corpse.  This<br/>
is tricky as it ruins your faction.  I created a lvl 1 warrior (mule) <br/>
and had no trouble killing the fish.  Just check that the fish has a <br/>
corpse as loot then change to your enchanter.  Loot the corpse and <br/>
grab the fish.<br/>
<br/>
Erud&#39;s Tonic is in Erudin, not surprisingly.  Buy an Innoruk&#39;s Kiss of<br/>
Death from the Blue Hawk Inn and go to the library.  Give IKD to<br/>
Sinekin Highbrow on the top level and you get Erud&#39;s Tonic.<br/>
<br/>
Back to Gregor in Freeport.  I start by Alliancing him but that may<br/>
not be necessary.  Give him all four items.  After he gets them all he will<br/>
give you the brewer&#39;s book. Now the fun part.<br/>
<br/>
Travel to Oggok.  Yes you are KOS there (except for some DEs).  NO<br/>
problem, you ARE an enchanter after all.  Illus Dark Elf and invis<br/>
yourself from South Ro until you get to Oggok.  Go and see Clurg the<br/>
bar Tender.  He is in the Meet and Drink Tewby bar.  Alliance him and <br/>
give him the book ... you should get the<br/>
Stein of Moggok in return.  Gate your butt out of there )<br/>
<br/>
Great quest, great item, great fun.  EVERY enchanter should do this<br/>
quest )</div>
