<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648195026">Hmm, my friend in an 18&#39;th level paladin with 55 magical resisance, without<br/>
spells, and he has never been effected by a spell from an evil eye, and we<br/>
have fought many of them in E Karana (Im a 13th lvl gnomish enchanter with<br/>
very high int, lots of mana :). Soo, I think that if Borzz was on the first<br/>
level of RunnyEye somehow, we might be able to kill him, especially if my<br/>
cleric friend had the endure magic spell by then. I have never been any<br/>
deeper than the first level of RunneyEye, how is it difficulty wise?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Just to Clarify:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know Borxx is a VERY high level Evil-Eye (25-35??). I was just saying<br/>
&gt;that I have seen him on the main level in RunnyEye and you don&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt;go down into the dungeon to run into him. Magik&#39;s email just confirms<br/>
&gt;this as he states a friend zoned into RunnyEye from Beholder and got<br/>
&gt;zapped by Borxx.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The original email stated:<br/>
&gt;&quot;Borxx ... can be found in the bottom of the dungeon ...&quot; </span></blockquote></div>
