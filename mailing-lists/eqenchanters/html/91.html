<b>Subject:</b> My experiences with stones and jewelry... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-583177852">Hello, I am a fellow Gnome Enchanter by the name of Loreweaver on the Mithaniel Marr server. (lvl 13 as of now).<br/>
<br/>
I have been practicing jewelry for a while now and have a skill level of around 40.  Here is what I have done to develop my skill:<br/>
<br/>
At first, I put around 5 skill points in, and started with Malachite and silver.  I failed a LOT and only went up about 3 skill points the whole time I was using these gems (20+ attempts gave me 4 successes and 3 skill points) so I decided to dump all of my skill points into it.  I leveled about 4 times and dumped about 15 points in, but after that they wouldnt let me put any more in.  So...<br/>
<br/>
Now I am working with Carnelian and Rose Quartz.  My skill has improved MUCH more than the first few times, and I boast a skill of 39 or 40.  Carnelian is not very expensive (relatively) and the wedding ring sells for a little over a plat, so if you are successful you only lose a few gold.  I suggest making Carnelian wedding rings until around skill lvl 40, and continue with the more expensive gems from there.<br/>
<br/>
Experiences with enchanted silver:<br/>
I am kinda excited but wondering when my extreme luck will fail me.  I have made 4 magical items in all, two with jade, one with pearl and one with topaz, and did not fail once.  I sold them for over double the values of the gems, and made some money to fail some more with Amber ;(<br/>
<br/>
I think that once I get to around lvl 50 skill I will start to experiment with electrum, and by the time I get to lvl 16 I will be able to enchant it.  With the higher quality metals, selling enchanted items could be very profitable.<br/>
<br/>
Thats all I have for now, and I also have a question:<br/>
Does anyone know where to find Jade quality and higher gems on creatures?  I have heard rumors of Kaladim&#39;s mines.  Can anyone confirm this?<br/>
<br/>
PS  Runed Totem Staff rocks.  If only I had practiced 2H blunt before ;(<br/>
