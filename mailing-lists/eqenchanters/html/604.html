<div id="ygrps-yiv-898677482">&#39;Lo, all.  Just wanted to share something I learned about jewelry...<br/>
<br/>
I borrowed some plat from a friend, killed some dervs, and collected about 90 plat that I was gonna use totally for jewelcraft.  I started with a skill of 31 and ended up at 37, because of something really stupid in the game.  I made lots, and I mean LOTS of wedding rings. (carnelian plus silver).  Not ONE point raised into jewelcraft.  After sinking over 50 plat in making stupid wedding rings, and not seeing any improvement (no, it did not give me the &quot;trivial&quot; message) I decided that I was probably wasting my time, but I continued and changed gems for a little variety.  Star Rose Quartz started raising my skill quickly, then became trivial, then I moved to Amber and silver, and kept raising my skill, then jade, when my money ran out (ya I sold everything back except my magic jade rings, gonna sell them to PCs).

<br/>
figure if I hadn&#39;t made any carnelian, I would be around skill level 43, but I am at skill lvl 37.<br/>
<br/>
Moral...  DONT make Carnelian Wedding Rings if you want skill, I think its a bug and you don&#39;t get any.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has gotten skill from Carnelian and Silver, please reply...<br/>
