<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276549641">Thanks for some of the best info I&#39;ve seen on this list thus far, Rob. <br/>
Hope you keep posting, so that those of us who are still learning have a<br/>
chance to profit from your experience.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a 90 Charisma as a gnome, and find my spells MUCH more<br/>
effective than I did back when I was a gnome with about an 80 charisma<br/>
or so (i.e. less resists and such).  I think this has convinced me to<br/>
look for +charisma jewelry at my soonest opportunity.  I hadn&#39;t made the<br/>
connection, and just figured that they had changed the way enchanters<br/>
work.  I still can&#39;t touch Tombstone monsters, but I do all right so<br/>
long as they&#39;re yellow or below.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and invisibility is GOD.  It has saved my butt numerous times<br/>
(Highhold, Crushbone, and several others).  I&#39;m level 10 at this point,<br/>
and have only died about 4 times so far, mostly due to the party not<br/>
listening to me when I saw something they didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t wait for level 12, as I&#39;m sure Charm makes a WORLD of difference. <br/>
Those legionniares certainly seem to beat the living tar out of my pet<br/>
quite a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Well, thanks again for the info.  Hope I can do so again.<br/>

P.S. - I&#39;ve seen the oncoming rush of a train containing Emperor<br/>
Crushbone, the Prophet, Lord What-is-face, AND Dvinn, and had them run<br/>
right on by, thanks to timely Invisibility.  Can&#39;t convince ME it isn&#39;t<br/>
powerful.<br/>

&gt; Mesmerize is two things: A &quot;shit list&quot; wipe and a 15 sec stun. If someone<br/>
&gt; attacks during that 15 secs, then they are now on top of the list. I usually<br/>
&gt; cast Tashan, CF and Choke, then Mes to get them pissed at the tank instead<br/>
&gt; of me. Lull is used to shrink their aggro radius so that you can<br/>
&gt; theoretically pull only one creature at a time. The problem is that it is<br/>
&gt; VERY unpredictable as to length, so I use charm instead (in a group) and<br/>
&gt; have one of them help our group beat the crap out of their buddies, then we<br/>
&gt; take out the pet when s/he gets pissed.<br/>
