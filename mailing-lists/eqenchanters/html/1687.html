<br/>
Why are we even talking about this before we can understand what they have<br/>
in mind?<br/>
Any one that &quot;overhears&quot; our messages will start getting doubts whether to<br/>
let us enchant weapons / Items or not in the first place. From what I read<br/>
here I am getting doubts myself!<br/>
<br/>
Lets see what they have in mind and then discuss it. I think Greg Short<br/>
(Baelish) whom seems to have a direct line with Verant, understand what is<br/>
proposed, let us know and then discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
Well thats my 2 coppers worth!<br/>
