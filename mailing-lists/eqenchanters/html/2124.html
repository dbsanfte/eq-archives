&gt;That&#39;s because he is an ogre outcast.  He was hated in Oggok and shunned, <br/>
&gt;because he was too smart.  The barbarian saved him from Guk when he was <br/>

So is the female Barbarian next to him. So, if you are a DE and are NOT <br/>
Agnostic, you will have real trouble completing this quest.<br/>
