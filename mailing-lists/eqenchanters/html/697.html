<div id="ygrps-yiv-753291922">I have been reading and trying to catch up on this list from the beginning,<br/>
and now that I have been caught up for some time now I think I will say a<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
My character&#39;s name is Gwynn and she is on Bristlebane.  I have seen two<br/>
others on Bristlebane, is there anymore and what are your character&#39;s name?<br/>
<br/>
I love the enchanter.  I have to say I was having doubts when I bought the<br/>
8th level spells and most were pretty much useless, but the 12th level<br/>
spells renewed my faith in the class.  I have to say that Whirl to you Hurl<br/>
is the best combat non damage spell there is.  But I must say minor illusion<br/>
is the most useful of all, I think have overlooked it&#39;s greatness.<br/>
<br/>
A full set of cloth armor can be purchased in two places in Erudin.  The is<br/>
a female vendor near the supply shop and a below the balcony of the temple<br/>
of Quellious.<br/>
<br/>
Pillage does exist.  I was in Greater Faydark, I had just gated back after<br/>
purchasing the 8th level animation spell.  The second message I recieved<br/>
after gating in was an auction of the spell Pillage.  I inquired when told<br/>
it was an enchanter spell.  The seller said he had completed a paladin quest<br/>
in Erudin &quot;hundreds of times&quot; and that is was a random quest reward.  I<br/>
certainly didn&#39;t have the 3p and some odd gold that the vendors offered him<br/>
let alone whatever &quot;finders fee&quot; he would put on it.  I didn&#39;t know how rare<br/>
it was.  I wish I could remember the characters name.<br/>
<br/>
I was also wondering what enchanter spell only are sold in Erudin.<br/>
