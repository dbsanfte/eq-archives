<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220558815">Small Enchancement to this if the bards aren&#39;t near any other NPC that would<br/>
get you is to use one of your colour stun spells in the combo.<br/>
<br/>
Easy way to solo even the Ghoul Magi is to buff a pet up then just cycle<br/>
stuns while the pet rips a new one into the mob...<br/>
<br/>
Just make sure the target is all on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Although with the new entrance and dazzle times dd/stun/mes/dd/stun/mes nuke<br/>
combo&#39;s are certainly the way to tackle high level single mobs.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; A little piece of my own advice. =)  Do with it what you want.  As<br/>
&gt; Personally I dont enjoy jumping around and running from MOB&#39;s.  I do let<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; pet tank, against Blues. Who hit for around 50 points.  (ouch!)<br/>
&gt; I am lvl 29. And my 29th Animation (w/ his 2 daggers) and Augmentation,<br/>
&gt; Obscure, Stregnthen. Really kick&#39;s some ass.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am killing the Intown Bards. (Woah big time faction loss) To get to 30.<br/>
My<br/>
&gt; Rotation is as follows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tashan/Root/Languid Pace/Suffocate/Sanity Warp/Suffocate/Sanity warp.  At<br/>
&gt; this point he&#39;s nearly dead.. and I either Melee him and try to get the<br/>
last<br/>
&gt; stroke in, or just DD him again.  But usually i&#39;m at about 40% manna when<br/>
&gt; i&#39;m done, and nearly full health.  I&#39;ve check&#39;d my pets health after the<br/>
&gt; battle, he&#39;s usualy just a tad below half life. I have lost a pet in doing<br/>
&gt; this, but I also was resisted on nearly every spell... *shivers*  That<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t fun.  BUT, I did use nearly the same strategy against the Hermit in<br/>
&gt; S. Karana. from lvl 22-27. Work&#39;d perfect, Never lost a pet. And I didnt<br/>
die<br/>
&gt; during ALL those levels.  *smiles* Gotta love that lil bonus.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Eventually, all enchanters find out that their pet can&#39;t tank. I have<br/>
&gt; developed a strategy which will prolong the life of our beloved pets and<br/>
&gt; make our use of mana more efficient. However, this will only work if the<br/>
mob<br/>
&gt; you are soloing is not one of those &quot;cons blue but hits like a red&quot; types.<br/>
&gt; First, u tashan, then you do your Dot. Then, u wait for the pet to have<br/>
half<br/>
&gt; hp, and then cast the big dd spell. This will draw the mob toward you.<br/>
Here<br/>
&gt; is the most important part. You must begin running in a circle, hitting<br/>
jump<br/>
&gt; every once in a while. The mob will chase u and hit u less then it woud if<br/>
u<br/>
&gt; were standing in one place. While this is going on, your pet is getting<br/>
free<br/>
&gt; hits on the mob and should quickly finish it. Note: as much as you&#39;d want<br/>
&gt; to, do NOT use debuffs other than tashan. You must cast your 3 spells<br/>
&gt; quickly, before the pet gets so low on hp that the mob will finish it.<br/>
Once<br/>
&gt; again, this will only work if the mob you are fighting is blue. You must<br/>
&gt; have an open area to work with, I&#39;d say at least 15ft radius. I am<br/>
currently<br/>
&gt; using this one in Lavastorm and its very mana efficient.  Good luck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;  &gt;Oasis is great for orcs grouped and crocs solo<br/>
&gt;  &gt;So Ro would be good for the derv camps and drybones<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;West Commons is good.  Are wisps still blue at 12? think they are.  The<br/>
&gt; derv<br/>
&gt;  &gt;camp would be good with a group and you would be helpful for them to<br/>
&gt; control<br/>
&gt;  &gt;bad pulls.  Also with a small group can easily handle full kodiaks.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;Beholder would be ok for minos grouped and muddite minors solo<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;The karanas (west I suppose) should have some bandits and the like<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;Unrest would be pushing it for death beetles and tormented dead with a<br/>
&gt;  &gt;partner<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;You&#39;ll notice I didn&#39;t mention much in the way of dungeons cause I like<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;  &gt;open spaces.  But befallen would probly be ok and if in a decent group<br/>
&gt; upper<br/>
&gt;  &gt;guk near the exit.<br/>

&gt;  &gt;I was wondering if charmed pets get exp when they kill something. Do<br/>
they<br/>
&gt;  &gt;get it every time or just if they make the last hit? Any info would be<br/>
&gt;  &gt;appreciated.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;Also, I am a lvl12 enchanter and am wondering what sort of places I can<br/>
&gt; hunt<br/>
&gt;  &gt;at for the next few lvls. I am currently near No Ro and Oasis, but am<br/>
&gt;  &gt;thinking that there&#39;s got to be an alternative.<br/>

&gt;  &gt;&gt;Jewelry skill will cap at 200 so that no platinum items become trivial.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;There is no level cap for trade skills. Main skills are capped at<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;(5xlevel)+5, but trade skills do not have this level limitation. Two<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;different meanings of skill caps. Hope this clears up the confusion.<br/>
