<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020261339">Has anyone here done much in Plane of Regrowth?  I have went twice in the<br/>
last week and stayed for 12 hours once and about 8 hours another time.  Only<br/>
saw two caster items drop (got both of them btw =P) a pair of Enchanter<br/>
gloves 5ac , 9int, 9agil, 35mana , 2vs all except magic which is 1vs and a<br/>
belt 4ac 40hps 40mana.  But to spend 20 hours in a plane and only see 2<br/>
(TWO!) pieces of caster gear drop is pathetic.  While I was there I saw<br/>
countless pieces of Cleric and Warrior pieces drop.  Anyone else seeing this<br/>
as well?  This place is really big and maybe my groups are just not pulling<br/>
the right mobs or we are not in the right area I have no idea.  Just seemed<br/>
a bit strange to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pleased to meet everyone.  I think I posted once before ages ago to<br/>
this list, but otherwise I don&#39;t post much.  It is a lot quieter than<br/>
the bards list I belong to, but that&#39;s the most active of them all I<br/>
think.  And not just because there&#39;s a lot of complaints right now<br/>
either!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear more from everyone!<br/>
