<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-619644192">In my many wanderings of old and new characters I see <br/>
others running around wearing very nice white, blue, and <br/>
black robes. I have seen people /auction Damask robes <br/>
and looking for another that I can&#39;t remember the name <br/>
of.  <br/>
I just hit 5th last night (without using a pet up to <br/>
now :) ) and would like to see a list of all the <br/>
different robes available and their stats.  I have a set <br/>
of Damask pants (thanks to my wife) and would like a <br/>
complete set.  Anyone who knows what pieces are out <br/>
there and what the benies are, please let me know.<br/>
Also, you can spoile me as to where to acquire them <br/>
too. :)<br/>
