<b>Subject:</b> are strength affecting spells worth it? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-711292675">Does anyone know if spells like enfeeblement really help?  If all they do is lower strength, <br/>
that is pointless.  I had an ogre once with 150str and he didn&#39;t do anymore damage than <br/>
an elf with 50str.  I would hate to be wasting mana just to make it so an orc could carry <br/>
less before i kill him.</div>
