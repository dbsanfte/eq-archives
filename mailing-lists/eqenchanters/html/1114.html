<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161673705">I was playing yesterday and noticing something pretty bad.<br/>
<br/>
Previously my chaotic feedback would always do 44 damage (when i was lv9).<br/>
Now (lv10) when I was casting it on<br/>
mobs on wisp isle (non-wisp-mobs actually like snakes and spiders) it does<br/>
almost like a random amount of damage.<br/>
<br/>
One time it even did 3! which isn&#39;t a good ratio to 45 mana.<br/>
Another time it did 18 and concequently because of the low damage, the<br/>
spider killed me.  It only had a few pixels of health left too and<br/>
certainly 27 more damage would have killed it.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else noticed this?  Did I miss something along the line of patches?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
