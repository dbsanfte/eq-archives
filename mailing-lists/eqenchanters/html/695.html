&gt;I found the guy once, to buy the 8th level animation spell. It&#39;s very<br/>
&gt;dangerous there, but not impossible. Invisibility is the key, as you<br/>
&gt;probably know since you were in the keep. The merchant is an Erudite,<br/>
&gt;and he&#39;s up on the second floor of the keep. I can&#39;t give specific<br/>
&gt;directions, as I was just running around until I found him, then gated<br/>
&gt;out immediately after I memorized the spell. I don&#39;t remember his name,<br/>
&gt;either, but he was the only Erudite I recall seeing there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good luck.<br/>
