<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064961837">I agree i decided to make items for my guild and only for people who had<br/>
been customers<br/>
before, i gave up pricing at the bottom of the price pool, i found some<br/>
people selling at cost just to make it hard on the rest of us to make<br/>
money(was actually told this by an enchanter wandering in north ro whoes<br/>
name i wont disclose), pretty bad i&#39;d say.<br/>

&gt; I accidentally overwrote working on someone elses reply - it will be going<br/>
&gt; back up when I get home from my night shift.  Just so you know...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a side issue I have given up on ever trying to achieve standardised<br/>
&gt; pricing.  It just will never happen.  EQ is a very different tradeskill<br/>
&gt; related game since so many people trade magic items for their wares, and<br/>
&gt; currency can come in many many forms of equipment.  I am now a follower of<br/>
&gt; the &quot;if both sides are happy&quot; principle.  To me if both people are happy in<br/>
&gt; a trade then good for them.  But trying to force people to use standard<br/>
&gt; prices simply will not happen - I have tried on my server and people just<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t listen - good thing only two of us can work in plat right now heh.<br/>
