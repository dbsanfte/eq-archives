<div id="ygrps-yiv-614094668">Well...  if all you needed to do was sneak past the guards to buy the scroll<br/>
you might be ok.  But if I were the dark elves I would probably put some<br/>
guards on the key places like the enchant metal scrolls.  It would be very<br/>
scary I think sneaking in there and a real problem if you die 8)<br/>

I am not a DE, but I want to begin making enchanted jewellry.  Any<br/>
suggestions as to acquiring Enchant Silver on Tallon/Vallon Zek?  I am<br/>
*not* going to make a mule character, but, is it possible, at lvl 8, to<br/>
use invisibility to sneak into Neriak, purchase the spell, and get out?<br/>
Is it advisable to wait  until level 12 and the DE illusion?  Or, is<br/>
neither approach safe, and should I just try to find a dark one willing<br/>
to betray their race for some platinum?<br/>
