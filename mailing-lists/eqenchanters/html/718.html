&gt; I am sorry to hear that you ran into trouble..  But I must admit that I have<br/>
&gt; never found an Orc that can see invisible  ( I may be wrong, its just that I<br/>
&gt; have never ran into one).  What server are you on?  I am on the Rathe Server<br/>
&gt; and would be happy to assist you in obtaining your Animation.  Here is<br/>
&gt; another Thought for you also:  You may want to use the Dark Elf illusion,<br/>
&gt; the Orcs in CrushBone do not attack me when I am using the DE illusion so<br/>
&gt; perhaps the Orcs in Highpass will not either..  But I would still use<br/>
&gt; INVIS..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ll have to use invis, really.  The orcs from Crushbone are working<br/>
on an alliance with teh Dark Elves, which is why the CB orcs don&#39;t<br/>
attack you with the DE Illusion up.  Other orcs have no qualms about<br/>
eating Dark Elves for breakfast.<br/>

&quot;Maybe I was mean<br/>
 but I really don&#39;t think so<br/>
 You asked if I&#39;m scared and I<br/>
 said so&quot;<br/>
