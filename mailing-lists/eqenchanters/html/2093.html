<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does one bad apple ruin the bunch?  Well, some may say no but the reality<br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; that there are lots of bad apples on racewar.  Having charm makes<br/>
&gt; enchanters <br/>
&gt; on TZ one trick ponies.  I have heard more bitching about being charmed<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; set on NPCs than any other thing.  For those who don&#39;t know, if you charm <br/>
&gt; someone and set him on a NPC, you can&#39;t loot him.  So why do it?   Because<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t want to fight the guy?  Mez is just as good. Mez him and leave.<br/>

	Well it certainly hurts those of us Enchanters who never used this<br/>
tactic.  It hurts the enchanters who would charm enemy team members and send<br/>
them against on another.  But the problems with charm and fear weren&#39;t just<br/>
children being mean, there were legitimate bugs associated with those<br/>
spells.  The &quot;good&quot; teams would routinely have an elven caster charm a dark<br/>
team member while the shorties and humans could beat on him.  Also, when<br/>
feared, any character at any level could attack the feared player.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
learn of that until discussion of the nerf came out.  If they modified the<br/>
spells so that Charmed PC&#39;s could only attack other PC&#39;s, that would be<br/>
fine, because I never sent someone against an NPC (except once I sent a<br/>
naked human mage named Belgarsomething against a blue cistern asp in Oasis -<br/>
Not a Sand Giant).  <br/>
<br/>
	Charm was mostly used by the fair enchanters to bring the players<br/>
back to teammates for them to destroy.  Charm was also a valuable deterrant<br/>
from Pkers.  If you could threaten them with it, they would leave.  Now, my<br/>
enchanter could never hope to be alone and hunt.  I would need to have<br/>
others with me (usually a good idea anyway, but it sucks to feel so<br/>
helpless).  Solo - Mes and run is all we can do.  Only under perfect<br/>
circumstances could we go one on one against any other class and survive.<br/>
Fear was a great tool for PvP enchanters, because you could have the pet<br/>
engaged on them, debuffed so that they were slowed, then feared so that they<br/>
ran and the pet kept attacking. <br/>
<br/>
	There are too many discussions about what is fair and not fair in<br/>
PvP.  It&#39;s Player vs. Player.  And I chose to be an enchanter because I<br/>
could charm.  You chose to be a druid so you could have SoW, Kite, Teleport,<br/>
burn, Charm animals, Turn into a wolf, buff, Heal, give damage shields and<br/>
...Man I hate druids!  (Just kidding)  But my point is that we chose our<br/>
classes based on the skills and abilities of those classes.  To simply<br/>
remove them because others don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair is wrong.  Do I bitch when<br/>
a druid snares me and casts DoT and burns the hell out of me while running<br/>
at twice my normal speed anyway?  No.  They can do that.  That&#39;s what druids<br/>
do.  If Verant said that snare can no longer be cast on other players how<br/>
would you react?  You&#39;d be mad, but there are still plenty of other druidic<br/>
tools to choose from.  Enchanters had Fear and Charm as their two main tools<br/>
for solo protection in the PvP environment.  Verant refused to take the time<br/>
necessary to fix the problems associated with these bugs and found it easier<br/>
to nuke a class altogether.  That is why we are mad.<br/>

	WTYH is viable, but one resist and you&#39;re gone.  The duration is<br/>
also a bit short on this.  And the recycle time is long.  Give PvP<br/>
enchanters old school WTYH and you&#39;re talking.  Eye of Confusion is our best<br/>
PvP spell now.  Give us an upgrade to that!  To take without giving or<br/>
fixing just makes people mad.  Can you at least see why the legitimate<br/>
enchanters are mad?<br/>

&gt; Have a sense of fair play and don&#39;t be a one trick pony.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	*snip*<br/>
<br/>
	Absolutely.  If that&#39;s all you could do as an enchanter, then you<br/>
aren&#39;t worth the price of a tiny dagger.  But if you were a good, skilled<br/>
enchanter on PvP, you just had the rug pulled out from under you.<br/>
Charm/Fear/Mind control are central aspects to the enchanter class.  To<br/>
simply remove them is crippling.<br/>
<br/>
	Enchanters in a group vs. Group PvP situation are still mighty<br/>
adversaries.  I&#39;d bet on the group with the enchanter almost every time.<br/>
But Solo, we simply do not have the damage dealing ability to kill another<br/>
player.  With the worst direct damage, worst DoT, and worst pet, we cannot<br/>
reduce their hit points.  All the high level enchanters can attest to this.<br/>
How often does an enchanter over level 30 burn?  Not often.  We are a<br/>
support class that makes our allies much more powerful than they would be<br/>
otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
	Verant can easily say &quot;Well you knew all this from the start.  You<br/>
knew that your direct damage spells would take twice as long to cast and<br/>
would use more mana and do less damage.  You knew that you have one line of<br/>
damage over time spells that also takes a significant time to cast for<br/>
limited effect.  You knew that your pets were uncommandable and often have<br/>
less hit points than a giant wasp drone.  You knew these things from the<br/>
start and still chose your character.&quot;  True.  But we also &quot;knew&quot; that we<br/>
had Fear and Charm, but you took them away without warning.  You changed the<br/>
rules Verant.  How can we be expected to remain happy if you constantly<br/>
change the rules?<br/>
