<div id="ygrps-yiv-534699691">When I&#39;ve made the scary run from North Ro to the innothule swamp<br/>
(through Oasis and South Ro) I&#39;ve been invisible but there is an orc<br/>
camp at the south end of Oasis (before zoning to South Ro) with Orcs<br/>
that are ready to attack everytime I go past.  The main culprit there is<br/>
an Orc Priest.  There are other creatures as well, some even blue or<br/>
green, that see me when invisible.  Giant spiders for example.<br/>

I can confirm that some Orcs can see invisible. Had one charge our group<br/>
as<br/>
we where going to purchase more animated sword spells and we verified<br/>
everyone&#39;s outdoor camo was still up as the critter charged. The<br/>
question I<br/>
have is this: Is the Orc seeing invisible due to a spell cast by an Orc<br/>
or<br/>
by other means (npc&#39;s, players, etc.). Just curious as to the origin, as<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen the source of this irritation. Strongly recommend you do<br/>
not<br/>
make the trip alone.<br/>
