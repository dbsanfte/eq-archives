<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219768481">I think it&#39;s always been like that. it&#39;s probably why you&#39;ll notice that in<br/>
each city, the zone points are safe. you can go in Neriak, every zone you&#39;ll<br/>
pass will lead you to a safe point with no guard.<br/>

recently i have been noticing something strange about illusions. maybe not<br/>
strange, maybe its suppose to be this way, but i wanted to see if anyone<br/>
else noticed this, or is it just happening to me?<br/>
when i cast an illusion on myself. lets say Dark Elf, then i cross zones,<br/>
the illusion is gone???? and i have to quickly recast before anyone sees me?<br/>
why does the issusion disapeas between zones??? is this a normal thing? I<br/>
have not gone to the dark elf city because of this, because if i change back<br/>
into a high elf between zones in the middle of the dark elf city, i know i<br/>
will not be getting my body back?<br/>
any suggestions?<br/>
