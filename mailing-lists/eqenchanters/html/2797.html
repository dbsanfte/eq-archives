Of course you have to take anything Verant says with a grain of salt, <br/>
so you may want to keep your cha high, but in my exp with my low cha <br/>
halfling(50 cha) if the charm sticks it can last as long as someone <br/>
with a real high cha.<br/>
&lt;/snip&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Heh. My 1st Druid was a Halfling on Bertoxx. When I cast the 14th <br/>
level charm animal spell (I was 17th) for the 1st time, I cast on a <br/>
very green puma to test it out. It lasted long enough for me to sit <br/>
down. I had base charisma at the time. Later, after getting a Crude <br/>
Stein, (2) +7 Cha bracelets, and the GOOD Halfling-only Raider cap <br/>
(+10 Cha) I tried again at 19th level (Cha was 104 this time as I put <br/>
points into cha at creation) while in NK. I cast on a Griffawn (blue)<br/>
and it lasted over 90 seconds. I did /pet as you were  and it <br/>
wandered off. After the &quot;your charm spell has broken&quot; message, I went <br/>
out again and cast on another fawn (even) and the same thing happened.<br/>
<br/>
Unless there has been a hidden nerf Charisma does have an effect, in <br/>
my experience, or its effect on saves has diminishing returns the <br/>
higher it gets. Just like Int of 212 gives 12 extra points of mana, <br/>
one for each point over 200. Also keep in mind &quot;Magic Numbers&quot; like <br/>
75, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200.  An Erudite Necro with no extra <br/>
points in Agi has an AC of 1, but if you put points in Agi and raise <br/>
it to 75, that same neco will have an AC of 12 when you appear in <br/>
Norrath the first time (no armor or buffs). I know as I tested this <br/>
when I heard the rumors about it. What happens to an Agi over 200 I <br/>
have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
I love debates. Keep it going! Hehe.<br/>
