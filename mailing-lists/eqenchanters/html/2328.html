<div id="ygrps-yiv-404523657">Well, I would say that you either killed a green mob with your pet or it was<br/>
actually your pet that died.  You get no experience from a charmed mob&#39;s<br/>
death.  I can&#39;t recall any times when my pet killed a blue or better than I<br/>
did not get any exp from it.<br/>

&gt; Could one of you guys take the time please to explain how xp and charmed<br/>
&gt; critters relates?<br/>
&gt; I made level 12 today, and I was playing around with charm.  I<br/>
&gt; noticed that<br/>
&gt; a lot of the time, I didn&#39;t get any xp when my pet&#39;s target died.  What&#39;s<br/>
&gt; happening?<br/>
