&gt;well I hate to agree with sumone that is so definate but.......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;        I have been playing since beta4 and have freinds that have been in<br/>
&gt;since phase 3......even Stratics and the EQVault (which are authored by<br/>

&gt;sales.......the debates you are talking about are obviously on webpages<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The problem of course being is that neither Stratics or EQVault are in any<br/>
way affiliated with Verant.  Neither have any &#39;inside&#39; information that<br/>
guarantees that all information contained therein is accurate.  For example,<br/>
I would recommend reading EQVault&#39;s guide to jewelcraft.  It is one of the<br/>
remarkably worst pieces of prose I&#39;ve ever had the privelidge to read.  It<br/>
make Hubbard&#39;s Battlefield Earth look like Ulysses.  ;)  Now, I&#39;m not saying<br/>
that charisma necessarily affects resists in any way shape or form, I dont<br/>
have any data on the matter (and I&#39;ve been playing eq since the begining of<br/>
phase 3).  If some people are experiencing a great deal fewer resists, it&#39;s<br/>
entirely possible that there&#39;s an undocumented chr effect.<br/>
