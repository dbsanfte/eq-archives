<div id="ygrps-yiv-485791302">Ground speed is affected by agility and your current weight.  is not easily<br/>
noticed except with SoW or Selo&#39;s, since it magnifies the effect.  I first<br/>
noticed the problem with my enchanter, a human, and a human cleric...<br/>
neither were encumbered, but my enchanter was running much faster than the<br/>
cleric.  the only difference was his higher strength had him carrying more<br/>
pounds.  My Druid wood elf and a wood elf ranger, same agility.... druid was<br/>
faster, less weight.  my druid vrs one with a agility buff, the agi buff one<br/>
was slightly faster, but when I got my agi to 100, I could keep up with the<br/>
buffed one, (in the 120s).  We did those while at the same weight.... done<br/>
at different weights, the heavy one always lagged behind.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusions...<br/>
Weight is deciding factor... encumbrance only decreases your agility to slow<br/>
you down, but each pound slows you as well.<br/>
Agility is a factor, but only to 100... which is max groundspeed at 0 weight<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have 101 agility, SoW, and keep my weight around 55 pounds.  I can run<br/>
circles around anyone in my guild, even the other shamans and druids.</div>
