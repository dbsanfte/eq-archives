<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760477915">Just one last comment that many people have seemed to have missed.... CHA<br/>
effect many of the charm based spells yes that is true, the thing you all<br/>
are forgeting is that many of enchanter spells even if not named CHARM spell<br/>
are charm based, meaning that CHARISMA does have an effect on them, which<br/>
spells fall under this catagory I am not sure but I have talked to a few GM<br/>
and they have stated that many of our spells fall under this catagory.<br/>

&gt;&quot;WISDOM (Mana for Priests, Resistance to Mind Spells, Tertiary Skill Check)<br/>
&gt;WIS is the mana determinant for the priestly casters, and their derived<br/>
&gt;hybrids (Cleric, Shaman, Druid, Ranger, Paladin). It is bar none the most<br/>
&gt;important stat for the former three classes and a consideration for the<br/>
&gt;latter two. This attribute also affects your character&#39;s resistance against<br/>
&gt;mind-affecting spells, such as Charm. In addition, WIS provides a last<br/>
&gt;chance to succeed at a failed skill roll. Although INT is the secondary<br/>
&gt;skill-up attribute for most skills, WIS may grant you to continue a failed<br/>
&gt;skill roll. Minimal as the chance may be, it is still the opportunity to<br/>
&gt;succeed on a roll one has already failed via skill check.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;INTELLIGENCE (Mana for Mages, Skill Gain)<br/>
&gt;INT is the mana determinant for the non-priestly casters (Wizard,<br/>
