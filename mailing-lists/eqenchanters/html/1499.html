I&#39;m all for something like this. Anyone else that feels the same, lets try<br/>
and get ourselves organized on as many servers as possible, and see what we<br/>
can do....<br/>

&gt; Here&#39;s a short editorial posted on EQ Enchanter in reference to jewlery<br/>
&gt; pricing with a nice reference to the United Blacksmiths of Britannia<br/>
(ultima<br/>
&gt; online).  I thought it would be nice to post here so more people might see<br/>
&gt; it and comment.  Notice this was written by Alaya of Fenin Ro.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Standardized Jewelry Pricing is Needed Now! by Alaya of Fenin Ro<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hail fellow Enchanters!  A long time ago, in a galaxy few now remember<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; fondness...  It is the Dark Ages. Lord British rules the land on a shard<br/>
&gt; called Atlantic. There were many trades in this land, and although some<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; mind-numbingly repetitive, the citizens of the land still ground out their<br/>
&gt; trade, day by day, hoping and wishing for the gods to grant them a higher<br/>
&gt; level of skill. One such trade was Blacksmithing. As the months went on,<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; became known to the people that Blacksmithing had been touched by the hand<br/>
&gt; of the gods, and now the hard working tradesmen could make armor and<br/>
weapons<br/>
&gt; better than those in any store. Inevitably, the trade became more<br/>
&gt; popular...the supply rose...the prices of the items dropped, and the<br/>
&gt; tradesmen who had worked for their skill were not happy.  Then came the<br/>
&gt; United Blacksmiths of Britannia. The UBB (as it came to be known) was a<br/>
&gt; coalition of these tradesmen, and they brought honor to the trade. They<br/>
&gt; established a uniform pricing system, fair and reasonable, so that most<br/>
&gt; could afford their quality wares, and the tradesmen would still be<br/>
rewarded<br/>
&gt; for their hard-won skill. I would like to propose something similar for<br/>
us,<br/>
&gt; in this new land called Norrath. As we, The Enchanters, are the ones that<br/>
&gt; control the Jewelry trade, perhaps we can come to agreement on what<br/>
pricing<br/>
&gt; is fair and reasonable to our patrons, while still allowing for us to make<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; good profit for our trouble. As Azara outlined in the editorial &quot;So You<br/>
Want<br/>
&gt; To Sell Cheap Jewelry?&quot;, we are in danger of allowing our craft to fall<br/>
&gt; victim to price slashing and subsequent deflation. Baelish has already<br/>
done<br/>
&gt; us the favor of creating a centralized location for us to exchange ideas<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; gather information. I propose a new section to the Everquest Enchanters,<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Jewelry price chart, for completed items. The prices can be debated and<br/>
&gt; agreed upon in the forum. If we do not take this step, I fear our craft,<br/>
&gt; which we have already put so much time and money in to, will soon be<br/>
&gt; worthless...or at least, worth much less. Thank you for your time, Alaya,<br/>
&gt; Enchantress and Jewelcrafter, Fennin Ro.<br/>
