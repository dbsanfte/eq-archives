<div id="ygrps-yiv-231000447">Well, I don&#39;t know how other jeweler&#39; days went, but I spent the entire<br/>
night strapped to the Qeynos gate, making jewelery, and the surprise of<br/>
the night? Ruby masks!  I would commission the work, they would buy the<br/>
gems. I made 7 masks last night at the cost of only silver to me, and<br/>
made approx 20plat per mask.  Seems those high up characters with money<br/>
to burn don&#39;t have a lot of stuff for the face.</div>
