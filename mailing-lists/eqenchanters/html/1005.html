<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086443161">well it&#39;s quite simple really..<br/>
1) Hunt close to a zone point except if you have spirit of the wolf. <br/>
2) Always be the first to run in a party, at least before your tanks.<br/>
3) keep the mob off you by using mesmerize every 3 or 4 spells you cast ( do<br/>
that with your pet too ).<br/>
4) soloing becomes much easier at level 12 when you get whirl till you<br/>
hurl..your pet can then stay alive more than 10 second,<br/>
5) do not solo. we are not a soloing class. I havent soloed since level 5.<br/>
6) to make a lot of xp, try parties of 2. With the debufs you can make any<br/>
yellow a blue or a green, and while you focus on that, your partner can<br/>
easily take care of the monster.<br/>
7) in large parties ( 6 people ), when attacking one big red...well stay<br/>
aside because you are useless anyway,<br/>
8) in large parties, when attacking a bunch of blues to yellow, try to<br/>
switch target quite often so you will have a better overall effect over the<br/>
battle and no monster will especially get mad at you and come for you. Also<br/>
keep charm handy in case your pet dies. Always warn your group that you<br/>
might charm a monster BEFORE battle, and always warn them that the charmed<br/>
creature will eventually come back for you and no taunting will get it off<br/>
you so they have to watch and protect you. Let them also know how mesmerize<br/>
works so they dont attack stunned creatures<br/>
9) One big life saver: do not panic! most spellcasting class have one thing<br/>
to do when some monster start pounding on you: RUN! but not us! Stay calm!<br/>
if you&#39;re under 2 bubs of hp you&#39;ll die if you run anyway. cast root ( fast<br/>
to cast ) right after an attack, back off, cast mesmerize and then RUN LIKE<br/>
HELL. That saved me a million times.<br/>
10) explore to find nice hunting areas suitable for your level and close to<br/>
a zone. One of my favorites recently has been lavastorm mountains, near the<br/>
najena entrance. Lots of xp, lots of loot, and a very close zone point.<br/>
11) Ah! I forgot! USE THE LURE METHOD. Do not run into mob, make it come to<br/>
you at a safe point, even if you have to run 30s with it on your tail before<br/>
you get there.<br/>
12) play with the mouse! arrow keys dont allow to turn around quickly enough<br/>
<br/>
my 12 cents,<br/>
