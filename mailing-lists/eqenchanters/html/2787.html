<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059729121">Hail all, I am new to the list.<br/>
<br/>
I have played an enchanter before, but not past 8th level.  I am going to<br/>
create a gnome enchanter and I have a few questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At 12th level, how does Charisma effect the length of the Charm spell?<br/>
Is this effected by Tashan at all?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From 8th to 11th how well does this strategy work out on evens/yellows?<br/>
1) Tashan<br/>
2) Color Flux (after pet engages)<br/>
3) Root or Blind / Fear<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From 12th on how well does this strategy work out on evens/yellows?<br/>
(Using highest level pet possible per level, fully buffed)<br/>
1) Open with Tashan<br/>
2) After Pet engages cast &quot;Whirl-Til&quot;<br/>
3) Cast Choke (optional)<br/>
4) Med til pet starts getting hit, cast &quot;Whirl&quot; again<br/>
5) Repeat 4 til mob dies<br/>
This looks good on paper, but would it work in the game? Recast time on<br/>
&quot;Whirl&quot; a factor here?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What good are the vials created via Thicken Mana? Are they stackable if you<br/>
use stackable vials? Can you use them in combat?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone figured out how to use the Gem Cutter? What benefit does this<br/>
actually have on Jewel Crafting?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
