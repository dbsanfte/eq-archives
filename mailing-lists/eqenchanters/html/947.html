<div id="ygrps-yiv-975294508">hmm I forgot the whole point of the discussion here... My point is that the<br/>
enchanter is one of the greatest class to play because it&#39;s fun!<br/>

I had a level 16 dark elf necro that I started on the first day of the<br/>
release. It took me 4 &#39;played&#39; days and a half to get it to level 16. then I<br/>
gave it up. I have now a level 16 enchanter. It took me 12 &#39;played&#39; days to<br/>
make it to 16... You think that&#39;s a problem for me? I had so much more fun<br/>
playing an enchanter. What&#39;s the deal with this level race? Sometimes I&#39;ll<br/>
spend an hour travelling back and forth just to say hi to a friend I havent<br/>
seen for a long time. Right now, I&#39;m hunting in CrushBone and I barely make<br/>
any xp where I could be soloing in Lavastorm and make a shit load of xp and<br/>
money..but what&#39;s the big deal? I enjoy playing Everquest a lot more now.<br/>
Powergaming is so boring. So are those people who start a race everytime  a<br/>
new server comes up.<br/>
<br/>
my 2 cents,<br/>
