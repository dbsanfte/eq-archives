Invis is likely to be the fist &#39;Divination&#39; school spell a new Enchant has.<br/>
If one is discovering town has has mana to spare, either use it or any form<br/>
of Minor Ill (same school) to boost this field. It looks like to me Invis<br/>
does not &#39;early flick&#39; as often once Divination is better. End length is<br/>
the same apparently<br/>

&gt;When you first get invis, your skill in that spell school likely sucks.<br/>
&gt;You need to max it to get invis to work reliably.  I was able to have my<br/>
&gt;high elf enchanter cruise through most of Neriak invis and survive.<br/>
&gt;well, until that dark elf enchanter cast see invis on a guard :)<br/>

&gt;I gave up a level 16 dark-elf necro because their invisibility spell (<br/>
&gt;gather shadows ) was very unreliable. One sad evening, coming back from<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;very long quest that brought me to Kerra Island and South Karana, I got<br/>
&gt;hacked multiple times in Riverdale losing about 4 bubs of xp because my<br/>
&gt;invis wore off on me randomly. I got really pissed off that at level 16,<br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;could not manage to cast a level 8 spell reliably and decided to start<br/>
&gt;another character more appropriate for travelling since I was very much<br/>
&gt;into<br/>
&gt;research and quests.<br/>
&gt;With my enchantress, I got invisibility at level 4 and used it some<br/>
&gt;times.<br/>
&gt;It always seemed to work great but I might be wrong. Yesterday, I found<br/>
&gt;out<br/>
&gt;that this invisibility spell is as bad as gather shadows as a %$#%^^%$<br/>
&gt;griffin nuked me a few seconds after I cast invisibility. Since then,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;noticed the same kind on unreliability...but only since I made level<br/>
&gt;8...I<br/>
&gt;might be wrong.<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I would like to know how&#39;s the enchanter&#39;s invisibility like at<br/>
&gt;level 16 or 20 or more. CAN YOU COUNT ON IT?<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
