<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511356815">The one most frustrating thing about jewelcraft (ok there are two) is the<br/>
high incidence of failure even when the stone is trivial.  Eventually you<br/>
will get to the point where carnelian, star rose quartz, and amber are<br/>
trivial but people will still want +2 int, +2 wis, or +2 str rings.  It is<br/>
here that it really becomes frustrating because even though the stones are<br/>
trivial you will still fail a decent amount of time (worst case maybe 30%)<br/>
at which time you are out over 2p.<br/>
<br/>
The other frustrating thing is the fall in prices people are charging/expect<br/>
to pay.  More and more items are being created which is rasing supply to<br/>
meet the demand.<br/>
<br/>
I put 21 points into the skill and it cost about 40p to move up to the high<br/>
30s with high 90s wis and 110ish int.<br/>
<br/>
good luck though!<br/>

you defiantly picked the wrong trade, but there is a list at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest">http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest</a> that gives you the price and effect of<br/>
making magic jewelry. the lower the cost of the gem, the easier it is to<br/>
work with.<br/>
