&gt; I suggest bribing another dark elf to buy it for you....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thats what I did.  I found a Shadow Knight that was willing to make a trade.<br/>
One Mino Axe delivered to him in West Commonlands for One Enchant Silver.  Not<br/>
the most honorable way for a high-elf to get his spell, but the craft is more<br/>
important than the pride.<br/>
<br/>
I actually aved about a plat on the transaction.  I happened to get a mino axe<br/>
while hunting with extremely higher level friends.  I sold it for 5, found<br/>
someone to make the trade, and bought another for 4 and then traded even for<br/>
the spell which probably would have cost me about the same. Most of the<br/>
Teir&#39;Dal will put away the racial differences to make a few coins or get a<br/>
decent trade I&#39;ve found.  Just be careful to whom you give it. Make sure<br/>
he/she brings the Enchantment spell to you before you give him/her the money.<br/>
