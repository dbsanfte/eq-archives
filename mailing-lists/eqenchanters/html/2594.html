<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-365692666">I didn&#39;t look in Neriak when I bought all my metal spells.  I can say, I didn&#39;t find it in Felwithe or Freeport.  I don&#39;t recall looking in Ak&#39;Anon.  I did find it in Erudin in the Enchanter guild.  I believe it was on the normal illusion vender.<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;new&quot; illusions, I would like to see Verant put in a special stackable Illusion: Opposite Sex.  I can&#39;t see any game use for it, but I think it would be kinda neat.<br/>

&gt;I can also now confirm that Illusion:Erudite has absolutely no effect<br/>
&gt;except putting the spell icon in the corner.  There really ought to be an<br/>
&gt;&quot;Illusion: Change Face&quot; spell that would randomize the character graphic,<br/>
&gt;(and an &quot;Illusion: Leather/Chain/Plate&quot; series that gave some AC and made<br/>
&gt;it look like you were wearing armor).  Ah, well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Next question: is Illusion: Halfling available anywhere outside of Erudin?<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m Currently based in Freeport (though camped in Highkeep after getting<br/>
&gt;my pet), and would like to avoid the trip.  I was hoping to find it in<br/>
&gt;Neriak, but didn&#39;t see it.<br/>
