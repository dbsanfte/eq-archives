<div id="ygrps-yiv-868122369">Wrong, the line of spell has both uses. <br/>
<br/>
Either to get rid of DOT spells or siphon off mob&#39;s buff. What is really<br/>
greaty with it is that you can use them on mobs and they wont register it<br/>
as an attack, leaving them open for tashan line after that.<br/>

&gt;cancel magic is an offensive spell, not defensive.  So many people mistake <br/>
&gt;the use of this spell.  Imagine being in a duel with a cleric.  I bet hes <br/>
&gt;surprised when you cancel magic his +400 hp buffs away.  same for npcs your <br/>
&gt;fighitng, use cancel magic on the spells that are helping them.  It&#39;s an <br/>
&gt;offensive spell, and was designed that way.<br/>
