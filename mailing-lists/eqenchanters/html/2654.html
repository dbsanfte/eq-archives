<b>Subject:</b> Cabilis faction <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-407233815">Ok... I&#39;ve been working on faction in Cabilis.. as it was, I could not enter<br/>
at all before... I&#39;m human, and follow the ways of Mithaniel Marr (which made<br/>
the basis of my decision of servers, I might add :) , when I started my first<br/>
character, my paladin, who also follows mith marr).<br/>
<br/>
Troopers and Crusaders were RtA.  Iksar illusion and Benevolance brought either/or<br/>
up the Threateningly.<br/>
<br/>
So, I started hunting out outcast iksar in the Field of Bone.. I found that<br/>
they gave LegionOfCabilis faction (wasn&#39;t sure what that was, think now that<br/>
it&#39;s the trooper guards?), and BroodOfSomething faction (I think this is Sarnaks?),<br/>
but lost faction with TheForsaken... I wasn&#39;t too worried about this, as I asked<br/>
and was told it was just the iksar outcast (Marauders, manslayers, etc) faction...<br/>
but I have heard a few times recently that people believed it was the SK or<br/>
necro faction in Cabilis... OUCH.  I&#39;m just HOPING this isn&#39;t the case.<br/>
<br/>
But, now I have troopers at threateningly with iksar illusion, and dubious with<br/>
benevolance... but the crusaders, hierophants, and the banker of course, are<br/>
all RtA.  I can benevolance them, and I can still get it to threateningly (which<br/>
leads me to believe that TheForsaken is NOT their faction, but that&#39;s not conclusive),<br/>
but then I&#39;m threateningly with both troopers and crusaders... maybe with all<br/>
the other residents, not sure.  I think I&#39;m dubious with the standard resident<br/>
with benevolance on a trooper, but didn&#39;t test it with benevolance on a crusader.<br/>
 So, in theory, as long as I kept moving fast, if everything was threateningly,<br/>
I could go through the city safely, as long as I didn&#39;t get TOO close to anything,<br/>
or stay near them long.  But, I&#39;m not going to try that.  :)<br/>
<br/>
So, anyone have any more definitive info on this?  Also, the banker is RtA,<br/>
but way green at 50.  Can I still bank with him, assuming he or someone near<br/>
doesn&#39;t attack me?<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s enough babble from me.<br/>
