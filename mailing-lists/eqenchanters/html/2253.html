Kill goblins in butcher, aqua goblins, do the &quot;Muffins for Pandros&quot; quest<br/>
with about 2000 muffins (yes 2000), do &quot;Pirate Earrings&quot; quest and &quot;Pirate<br/>
Bracers&quot; quest, and finally do &quot;Ogre Heads&quot; quest in kaladim itself.<br/>

You have two strikes against you.  1) religion (for some odd reason all NPCs<br/>
instantly know your religion regardless of your illusion) 2) race (dwarves,<br/>
high elves, wood elves, gnomes, barbarians, and some humans are all KOS to<br/>
you).  You will have to raise your faction as high as it can go with the<br/>
stormguard before your illusions will work (due to your religion).<br/>

Crushbone:<br/>
There is a very convoluted way to get the free faction by doing crushbone.<br/>
You kill stuff in crushbone.  You take the hits with the Indigo Brotherhood.<br/>
You turn in orc picks to gain that faction back but lose it with<br/>
stormguard(dwarves) and emerald warriors(wood elves).  You then go and kill<br/>
aqua goblins in oot to gain back the stormguard and emerald warriors.  Whew.<br/>
Long complex way, but in the end you will get positives in everything.<br/>

Hey all!<br/>
<br/>
Another question. :)  Is there a way to raise your faction with the<br/>
Ogguk Guards, Merchants, and/or Clurg?  Say you&#39;re KOS there, and are<br/>
not an enchanter so you can&#39;t cast an illusion.  Is it at all possible?<br/>
I&#39;ve checked every everquest website that I know of for the faction hits<br/>
for the various monsters and I don&#39;t see anything about raising or<br/>
lowering faction with these groups.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m KOS in Kaladim with or without illusions, and Alliance doesn&#39;t<br/>
help.  Anything I can/should do to raise faction with them as well?  I<br/>
wasn&#39;t able to find a whole lot about the Kaladim Guards.  What group do<br/>
they belong to?<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least: this is for any DE enchanters out there.<br/>
Crushbone:  Should I or shouldn&#39;t I?  The only faction I will lose is<br/>
with the Warriors Guild in Neriak (Indigo Brotherhood), and I will gain<br/>
a lot of faction where I&#39;m currently KOS.  BUT I don&#39;t necessairly want<br/>
to make myself KOS in my own hometown either..  comments?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I&#39;m not agnostic.  Makes things a bit tougher, but that&#39;s<br/>
what keeps the game fun. :)<br/>
