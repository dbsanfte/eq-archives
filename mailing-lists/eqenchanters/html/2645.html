Illusion Iksar - The Iksar can see right through it making this spell almost<br/>
useless in it&#39;s current form.  The only way I can see to make the spell work<br/>
is to raise your faction with the Iksar so they won&#39;t kill you.  But if you<br/>
are going to go to all this work what&#39;s the point of the spell in the first<br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
The faction for Agnostic enchanters needs to be raised so that they are at<br/>
least dubious with this illusion.  I was able to get my faction up to<br/>
&quot;Threateningly&quot; by using illusion Iksar and benevolence so I know it&#39;s<br/>
possible to raise faction above KOS, just a pain.<br/>
<br/>
never give up my enchanter:<br/>
breeze, clarity line - I&#39;m the hit of any caster party<br/>
mez line - nothin feels better than ordering the party when to start/stop<br/>
attacking MOBs so you can park them<br/>

Subject: [eqenchanters] Return of an Enchanter<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hallo all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on the list forever but haven&#39;t played in forever too... Just went<br/>
<br/>
out and bought a copy of the original game-my computer isn&#39;t smart enough <br/>
166/32mb/4mb vid card-and I&#39;m wondering about the optional files offered <br/>
when you first start up a copy of the game and click the &#39;play online&#39; <br/>
button.(Not talking about the register Kunark button) I&#39;m wondering if these<br/>
<br/>
files are too much for my computer too handle, system spec wise, and what <br/>
they happen to contain.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I&#39;m still going to play an Enchanter, again, even knowing how <br/>
annoying the class can be. I can&#39;t help it, Enchanters are without a doubt <br/>
the iconoclastic class in the game, the enigma to many, and seeing the mana <br/>
speed up spells I&#39;m sure one of the most bothered classes-a&#39;la SoW-in the <br/>
game, which is fine with me most times because I love chatting.<br/>
<br/>
And Since I haven&#39;t played in about a year, I&#39;ll try to start up a debate! <br/>
What are the best and worst changes to the Enchanters as of late? What makes<br/>
<br/>
you spittin mad and what makes you want to never give up the class??<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
