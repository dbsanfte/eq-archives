	I hope you&#39;re friend has a good reason for taking the faction hit<br/>
(like he is already KOS there).  If not, just create a mule character and<br/>
use it to kill the fish.<br/>
	For my mule, I create a human fighter and max out the str.  Then I<br/>
hunt in front of Qeynos to hit lvl 2.  This is just for comfort, a lvl 1 has<br/>
a better than even chance of making the kill.  After that, just go kill<br/>
fishes until a corpse is found.  Log out.  Log back in with your main<br/>
character and loot the corpse.  No fuss. No muss.  No KOS.  <br/>
	If someone is working with you, have them get the mule and buff them<br/>
(including enduring breath).  <br/>
	I just can&#39;t see a reason to ruin good faction when there is such an<br/>
easy alternative.  Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

I started the quest to get my own stein last night.  I&#39;m a 13 high elf<br/>
enchanter on Povar.  <br/>
<br/>
The jumjum juice is Lore but NOT no drop.  The honeycombs took me about 5<br/>
minutes to get myself by killing bixies in Mistythicket (you need 3).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently working on the fish.  I have a friend who was willing to take<br/>
the faction hits for killing the fish in Qeynos.  The fish are no drop so<br/>
have to loot them yourself.  After 3 fish still nothing has dropped.  He<br/>
hopped out of the water after the last fish and the paladins came running<br/>
 from all over the area to kill him hehe.  He took a 365hp hit and died.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully will get a fish and can move on to Erud&#39;s Tonic which I believe is<br/>
Lore, No Drop.<br/>
<br/>
So we have:<br/>
nuts - not no drop, not lore<br/>
jumjum - not no drop, lore<br/>
fish - no drop, lore - major bad faction hit per attempt at getting fish<br/>
tonic - no drop, lore<br/>
<br/>
Azara, Povar<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Also, all the items except for the nut are Lore No Drop now I am all but<br/>
certain, so you have to do most of it yourself . If you can, have a friend<br/>
work on getting honeycombs, as this seems to be the most time consuming part<br/>
of the quest. I walk into Misty and immediatley /auction buying honeycombs<br/>
1pp, though I have heard of some people offering 3pp per honeycomb (pretty<br/>
good money for a newbie halfling if he&#39;s smart and holds on to them).<br/>
