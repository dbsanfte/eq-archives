perhaps in a basement group, but the zone needs to be fairly populated to<br/>
work well.  This is a good spot for pick-up groups if you play on peak or<br/>
near-peak hours.  The mistmoore courtyard (up along the edge) is good too,<br/>
but finding a group there is spotty.  If you think Unrest trains are bad,<br/>
wait until you fight in Mistmoore.  Still, both zones have places that you<br/>
can fight without being in the train path.<br/>
<br/>
Cazic is okay too - there&#39;s usually a group forming or looking for new<br/>
members, and your level is perfect for the maze.  Don&#39;t fight in the<br/>
courtyard or you&#39;ll get trained often - go into the maze, pick a dead-end,<br/>
and pull to there.<br/>
<br/>
SK is crowded and annoying, but there&#39;s always aviaks and centaurs to kill<br/>
and people to team up with.<br/>
<br/>
Upper Guk is amazing experience, but you need to have a group already, as<br/>
nobody hangs out there looking for a group.  Likewise Permafrost, and the<br/>
Goblin ruins or Iksar bandit cave in Warsliks Woods.  You&#39;re at the high<br/>
end of the level range for Kurn&#39;s tower.<br/>
<br/>
Gargoyles in OOT are profitable, and you can often find a partner to hunt<br/>
them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just took the long run to Qeynos and that is so I can hunt in SK<br/>
&gt; where everyone has told me I should kill Treants or Avaiks. (I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really want to kill treants, as I like being able to port to Druid<br/>
&gt; rings)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You won&#39;t fight treants anyway - they&#39;re insanely camped, all the time.<br/>
Out of curiosity, why Qeynos?  WK is a BIG zone - Highkeep and Grobb are<br/>
both closer to SK than Qeynos, and there are vendors in SK so you don&#39;t<br/>
often need a city.<br/>
