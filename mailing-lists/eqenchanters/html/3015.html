<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My regular group (just 3 of us) is myself the<br/>
&gt; enchantress, my husband <br/>
&gt; druid, and our friend the paladin, all in the low<br/>
&gt; 20&#39;s.  Until <br/>
&gt; recently, most fights found me doing tashani, choke,<br/>
&gt; and maybe a <br/>
&gt; slowdown on the incoming mob, getting in the mob&#39;s<br/>
&gt; face so he&#39;d aggro <br/>
&gt; on me and my pet would attack, then sitting on my<br/>
&gt; butt waiting for <br/>
&gt; choke to wear off and recasting if needed.  On the<br/>
&gt; rare occasions that <br/>
&gt; we&#39;d get 2 mobs, I&#39;d mezz the extra.  Our fights<br/>
&gt; were efficient, but a <br/>
&gt; tad boring.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then one night my druid husband and I decided to try<br/>
&gt; out the forest <br/>
&gt; giants in Warsliks Woods.  These guys hit hard, and<br/>
&gt; we had no tank <br/>
&gt; (Paladin off enjoying RL :)  The strategy we came up<br/>
&gt; with was such a <br/>
&gt; nice change of pace.  The druid pulled with snare<br/>
&gt; (if resisted, he <br/>
&gt; recast after my tashani), I tashani&#39;d, if that was<br/>
&gt; enough to get the <br/>
&gt; mob&#39;s attention, I let him aggro on me and engage<br/>
&gt; pet, if not, I hit <br/>
&gt; him with sanity warp.  Once on my pet (or me)  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; run off a bit <br/>
&gt; (we both were SoW&#39;d) and the druid nuked and got the<br/>
&gt; giant&#39;s <br/>
&gt; attention.  While he tried to catch the druid, I<br/>
&gt; nuked and got him <br/>
&gt; back after me.  We&#39;d run back and forth, nuking, and<br/>
&gt; generally <br/>
&gt; confusing the poor guy, with my pet at it&#39;s back. <br/>
&gt; Finally it would <br/>
&gt; decide to run, but found snare interfering, and<br/>
&gt; would just stand there <br/>
&gt; while my pet and druid husband beat it down.  After<br/>
&gt; the battle, we&#39;d <br/>
&gt; have 2 or 3 bubbles of mana left and full health,<br/>
&gt; and this was after <br/>
&gt; beating the low red ones.  Yeah, we then had to sit<br/>
&gt; and med a bit, but <br/>
&gt; the battle was so much more fun playing dodge the<br/>
&gt; giant. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had heard that druids and enchanters make good<br/>
&gt; partners, now I know <br/>
&gt; why.<br/>
