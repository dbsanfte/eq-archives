<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444384453">Well, if this were the case, Enchanters would be on the end of the list to<br/>
&quot;balance&quot;.  There are what, all of 3 enchanters over 35 on all servers?  One<br/>
did hit 50, but if you look at his hours played, that was an extra-ordinary<br/>
effort.<br/>
<br/>
If there is logic behind the &quot;tweaking&quot; that enchanters have undergone, the<br/>
only one I can think of is they dont want to implement actual enchanting, so<br/>
they are letting the class die off.<br/>

has anyone considered the possibility that Verant is &#39;balancing the<br/>
races/classes&#39; in order to slow us from leveling?  By &#39;us&#39; I mean all<br/>
classes, not just enchanters.   As some people are now approaching the<br/>
level cap (50) and may soon stop playing. (once a goal is reached so as<br/>
leveling....although the cap will be raised with the expansion, I have<br/>
read.   The longer we play, the more money they get from us for monthly<br/>
services.<br/>
<br/>
just a thought...<br/>
