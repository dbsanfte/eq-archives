<b>Subject:</b> You and your nerfs... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395063494">Face it, guys, EQ is a multiplayer game where the main fun comes from<br/>
grouping with human people to take down NPCs. Killing other people is a very<br/>
small part of EQ; the people on Non-pvp servers almost never have to atk<br/>
another person. Hmm...now you can&#39;t use some spells on other people... So<br/>
what? If its very important for you to be able to destroy other real people<br/>
in combat, there are plenty of other games (like Quake) that let you do<br/>
that, and you don&#39;t have to worry about your rocket launcher getting nerfed.<br/>
I am surprised at how much grief these new changes have caused. After all,<br/>
you can still charm NPCs, you can still color flux camps of monsters, you<br/>
can still cast fear on that orc. Sure, that big bad ogre warrior might kick<br/>
your butt in pvp. But when that warrior is in your group (which he most<br/>
likely will be, as opposed to dueling u), he will be praying for your next<br/>
spell as he watches the monster he is fighting rip him apart. Finally, you<br/>
can still pvp. You can still win. Some classes can&#39;t pvp at all. Thus, my<br/>
friends, I wish you good hunting and good luck.<br/>

&gt;In case you hadn&#39;t noticed it yet, we&#39;ve also lost the ability to cast the<br/>
&gt;color flux/shift/ect line of spells on other players.  hmmm... so that<br/>
