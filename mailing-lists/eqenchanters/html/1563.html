&gt;someone had the page but no luck!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>heh, I&#39;ve almost given up on this one, had finally found the left half<br/>
around 22 and was able to find a right half off of someone(paid 3p for it<br/>
though, had to outbid for it), failed miserably and havent been able to find<br/>
either half since.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, strengthen is extremely cheap and still worth the cast to last for<br/>
a while longer.<br/>
<br/>
Just for refernce I found the page on an aviak in Lake Rathtear.<br/>
