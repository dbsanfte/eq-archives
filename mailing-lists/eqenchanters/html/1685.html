<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-373866976">Why are we even talking about temporary enchantments?  Wouldn&#39;t you<br/>
prefer to create permanently enchanted objects?  At leaset thew would<br/>
have market value.  Selling a temporary enchantment is even worse than<br/>
selling summoned weapons.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Party pooper, party pooper. Ok you know the song,<br/>
&gt; this time I fill the role<br/>
&gt; &gt;:).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; May I point out that the message said that the<br/>
&gt; code was going to be<br/>
&gt; &gt;implemented, not that -we- enchanters are going to<br/>
&gt; benefit from it. True,<br/>
&gt; &gt;it was stated in the book we could do it, but at no<br/>
&gt; time in B4 it was in<br/>
&gt; &gt;effect, and, according to EQE, we received other<br/>
&gt; benefits to make up for<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As I see it, such thing would overbalance us<br/>
&gt; (enchanters) in regard of<br/>
&gt; &gt;other pure spell user classes. So either the<br/>
&gt; benefit will be too small to<br/>
&gt; &gt;even consider it or too huge and Verant might take<br/>
&gt; out something in return<br/>
&gt; &gt;to balance our classe again. Don&#39;t tell me we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; nerfed now. We were, true,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but that was sometime ago and from my point of view<br/>
&gt; we are rather balanced<br/>
&gt; &gt;regarding other pure spell users. To sum up we have<br/>
&gt; our &quot;niche&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, the idea is: By talking here, and offering<br/>
&gt; Verant options to consider<br/>
&gt; &gt;we may have a say in the matter and make our class<br/>
&gt; fuller in the way -we-<br/>
&gt; &gt;see it. What I would like to see discussed here is<br/>
&gt; : What can we give up to<br/>
&gt; &gt;have a &#39;proper&#39; enchantment line of spells?. Or are<br/>
&gt; we just to receive this<br/>
&gt; &gt;new ability/spell/line of spells without giving up<br/>
&gt; anything?.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As stated above, I dont think we can&#39;t expect a<br/>
&gt; &#39;useful&#39; line of<br/>
&gt; &gt;enchantment&#39;s spells unless we give up something in<br/>
&gt; exchange. Thinking back<br/>
&gt; &gt;of Beta, there was a line of spells we didn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; but nonetheless still<br/>
&gt; &gt;managed to survive and prosper : Pet line of<br/>
&gt; spells. Plus they don&#39;t fit<br/>
&gt; &gt;enchanters very well . On the other hand, this line<br/>
&gt; form the very core of<br/>
&gt; &gt;most of our solo strategies so losing it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be a small thing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is just an example, a topic&#39;s starter. Feel<br/>
&gt; free to agree, disagree<br/>
&gt; &gt;or tell me to shut up. Once again my aim to to talk<br/>
&gt; things out here first<br/>
&gt; &gt;and offer something (petition/ EQE/ you name it)<br/>
&gt; constructive to Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt;before we see something not implemented or half<br/>
&gt; implemented in place.<br/>

&gt; &gt;still going up<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would be hapy to lose our pets.<br/>
&gt; I went up to 9th level before seriously using a pet.<br/>
&gt; Give us spells so we are wanted in a group even at<br/>
&gt; low levels so that we can<br/>
&gt; always find a group and I&#39;ll happily give up my pet<br/>
&gt; for good.  Even take<br/>
&gt; charm if ya like.<br/>
&gt; However Enchantments I see as a form of trade skill<br/>
&gt; and people will want you<br/>
&gt; to create tehm for them at little or no cost but<br/>
&gt; tehn when it comes to<br/>
&gt; partying ask waht you can do in a fight.<br/>
&gt; That are give you a pity spot in the party to keep<br/>
&gt; those temp enchantments<br/>
&gt; coming.  I dont see Enchantments having such a huge<br/>
&gt; effect on our class no<br/>
&gt; matter what form they take.<br/>
