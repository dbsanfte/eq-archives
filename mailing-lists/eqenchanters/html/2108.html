I forgot to mention that the web page doesn&#39;t mention that 2 of the<br/>
components (the Koalindl fish and the Eruds Tonic) required to complete the<br/>
first half of the quest (make the bartenders compendum) are no drop, as is<br/>
the compendum.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A fellow guild member also told me to turn in the items to the Freeport<br/>
Bartender one at a time as giving all 4 at once sometimes doesn&#39;t result in<br/>
anything. I also was given conflicting advice that if you cast Alliance on<br/>
him from the &quot;patron&quot; side of the bar that the Ogre will(not) attack you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm/ deny either of these?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
