<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729064493">Ok, here&#39;s what I know bout Invisiblity...<br/>
Yes it fails a lot, at lvl 4 and at lvl 20. Get use to it, seems they took<br/>
it down quite a few notches early after they went into production. Also,<br/>
some creatures can see invso, so invso or not, they&#39;ll attack if they see<br/>
you as a threat, depending on your fraction and diffculty level. I would<br/>
suggest traveling while invso as if it&#39;s not on, running or going around<br/>
guards/creatures that would normally attack if at all possible. Use your<br/>
illusion when you can, then cast invso on yourself, it&#39;ll let you stack it<br/>
and guards will defend you that are fooled by the illusion. <br/>
<br/>
As for Jewelcraft, here&#39;s what I know<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stone			Silver				Electrum			Skill<br/>
Jade			+5 mana ring			?				30+<br/>
malieche(?)		non-magical			+2 sv posion bracers		35+<br/>
Lapis Lazuli		non-magical			+2 sv disease earings	41+<br/>
<br/>
Do note, the listed skill is not the bottom requirement, it&#39;s what I had<br/>
when I first tried making the item, so it may be possible to craft them<br/>
with lower skill, but not by much Im sure. <br/>
I am currently 49 skill and am working up my bank to get back to it. I&#39;ll<br/>
post more when I have the info.<br/>
