<div id="ygrps-yiv-335172461">I&#39;m not sure of the specific times for the mez line, although they get<br/>
longer as they improve (as they should).  You may be interested to know,<br/>
however, that any figures you read are reduced in PvP, like all spells.<br/>
Color flux line I&#39;ve timed at 3 for flux, 5 for sphere, and 8 for spray, and<br/>
they do NOT break an enthrall but they will act as a taunt against unaggro<br/>
mobs.<br/>

Subject: [eqenchanters] Mez and stun<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anybody have information about the lengths of the mez and stun lines<br/>
?<br/>
&gt; I heard in-game that mez is 15 sec, enthrall 30, entrance 45 and dazzle<br/>
60.<br/>
&gt; The enchanter spell list on Baelish&#39;s site says mez 30, enthrall 30,<br/>
&gt; entrance 50-60, dazzle 120, which I find more believable. Anybody measure<br/>
&gt; with a stopwatch ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, as far as I can tell, this line of spells is fixed duration, i.e,<br/>
MOB<br/>
&gt; does not get any saving throws to break early like the root line. True ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stun line : Color Flux 3 sec, Color Shift 7 sec, Color Skew 8 sec. Is the<br/>
&gt; stun duration fixed ? In my experience, some MOBs seem to be more<br/>
susceptible<br/>
&gt; to staying stunned longer. Like lizards in CT seemed to stay stunned<br/>
forever<br/>
&gt; with even flux.<br/>
