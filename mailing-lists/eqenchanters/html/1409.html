<div id="ygrps-yiv-280347140">I think in general often used skills go up quickly while those not so often<br/>
used skills don&#39;t.  I think if I don&#39;t use piercing for a couple of levels<br/>
for example and then come back to it when I make a level it takes a while<br/>
before I see a skill increase.  Maybe when we go to train at the guild we<br/>
bring that skill to the forefront like it has been recently used alot.  My<br/>
theory doesn&#39;t answer why if you put one point in there sometimes aren&#39;t any<br/>
increases.  Maybe there&#39;s a critical point that needs to be passed based on<br/>
skill level, character level, etc.  So, for some skills 1 point into that<br/>
skill might be enough depending on what level you decide to try that but<br/>
other skills need lots more points to &quot;catch up&quot; the skill to your current<br/>
level if you wait till you are medium or higher level?<br/>
<br/>
food for thought,<br/>

Yes, and if you want to increase your skills be sure to train at your guild<br/>
as much as you can.  a person with 1 skill wont improve as fast as a person<br/>
with 15 skill, trust me I spent a whole level tring to improve my piercing<br/>
 from 1 and there was no change, next level I trained it up to around 20 and<br/>
I noticed my skills begin to rise shortly after.<br/>

&gt;I didn&#39;t get a 1h blunt weapon (cracked staff) until I turned like level<br/>
&gt;10, but I didn&#39;t practice it much.<br/>
&gt;I think my skill is (1).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My piercing and 2h blunt are good though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Should I try hard and increase it?<br/>
&gt;You can only increase mele skills on blues or above, right?<br/>
