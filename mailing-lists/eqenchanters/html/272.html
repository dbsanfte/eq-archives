<div id="ygrps-yiv-141902411">I have found this to be untrue and have even petitioned it.  Here is what the<br/>
GM told me.<br/>
<br/>
Since your pet is only defensive, he doesn&#39;t take any xp from you if you solo<br/>
or are in a group.  I was wondering why I was getting tons of xp when fighting<br/>
creatures that conned yellow to me so I asked.  Can someone please try to<br/>
confirm this as well.  Just ask a GM.<br/>
<br/>
2nd, also according to the GM&#39;s that I spoke to... buffing your pet is a waste<br/>
of mana.  I use to buff my pet all the time but really didn&#39;t see any<br/>
improvement.  Again, I hope someone can confirm this since my information is<br/>
based off of my perceptions and what the GM&#39;s tell me.<br/>
<br/>
Well I hope this helps.<br/>

I read on stratics or vault (hehe, I know it&#39;s not the gospel now) that<br/>
pets take exp from the master not from the group.  So, if enchanter x is<br/>
grouped with or without a pet he takes the same amount of experience.<br/>
Why would it differ from when you solo?<br/>
<br/>
There are x points from a creature<br/>
When you solo w/o a pet you take x points<br/>
When you group w/o a pet you take (complicated formula based on level<br/>
and maybe damage we&#39;ll call K for unknown) your K share of x points<br/>
When you solo with a pet you take (x - pet points)<br/>
When you group with a pet you take (your K share of x points - pet<br/>
points).<br/>
<br/>
Now, the thing that might affect this is if damage inflicted affects exp<br/>
share.  If this is true and your pet is dishing out the damage you and<br/>
your pet will split more points than if you were w/o a pet not hitting<br/>
as often so doing less damage.  Also, it could be if the pet hits last<br/>
he is just doing even more damage which adds to your amount of damage<br/>
inflicted.<br/>
<br/>
Or, your pet counts as another party member in which case maybe you<br/>
should get your pet killed before finishing the monster?  Too many<br/>
unknowns...<br/>
