<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579633618">Well I have been lurking this group for a while now and decided to send in a post and say hi.  Also I would like to comment on a post that I read in regards to the location of the Animation Spell Vendor in High Pass.<br/>
First off it is on the first floor, not the second.  Once you zone into the Keep you will cross a small court yard, you will see a small flight of stairs leading into the keep.  Go up these stairs and into the keep..  Now the vendor is located on the Left side of this main corridor that you entered, he is also behind a closed door.  So start exploring entrances on the left side of the corridor and it will not take you long to find him.  Also avoid the &quot;Lower&quot; sections of this keep, there are some bad NPC&#39;s and gob&#39;s in there.</div>
