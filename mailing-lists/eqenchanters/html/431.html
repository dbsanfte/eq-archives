<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218163005">I saw this posted on the eq vault and thought maybe some people here<br/>
don&#39;t see the vault every day and would find this useful...<br/>

One thing I&#39;ll add about learning other languages, when I&#39;m grouped and<br/>
the group is healing/meditating I switch to one of my other languages<br/>
and use a button I have set up to say the same phrase over and over.  In<br/>
this way the group is learning some of my special languages.  Make sure<br/>
to switch back to common when finished!  You don&#39;t want to be calling<br/>
for help or announcing a train and have your group see &quot;safsa fga the<br/>
trxzn&quot;<br/>

About Spell Research <br/>
The Arch Magi himself, Verant&#39;s Geoffrey Zatkin, sent me an email<br/>
describing the little known trade skill of Spell Research. Here&#39;s what<br/>
he had to say: <br/>
	Spell Research is a trade skill, similar in theory to tailoring<br/>
and cooking. Specific items are inserted in to a container, combining to<br/>
produce a new item. <br/>
	All magi begin researching spells at level 16. To do spell<br/>
research, you will need a Tome specific to your class - these can be<br/>
purchased in your guild hall. <br/>
*	Wizards use a Lexicon<br/>
*	Mages use an Elemental Grimoire<br/>
*	Enchanters use a Tome of Endless Enchantments<br/>
*	Necromancers use a Book of Dark Bindings <br/>
	Research instruction books can also be purchased in your guild<br/>
hall. All instruction books are written in languages other than common.<br/>
To learn the fundamentals of a language, you must train one point in the<br/>
language with your guild master. Once you have learned the fundamentals,<br/>
you will be able to advance your linguistic skills through use - usually<br/>
by listening to someone speak in that language. <br/>
	Research instruction books will list the components needed to<br/>
produce a scroll. Spell components can be found scattered throughout the<br/>
world - they appear randomly on different creatures, so you will not<br/>
have to &#39;camp&#39; a spot to get a certain component. Components can be<br/>
stored and traded - ask around - 13 of the 14 classes out there will not<br/>
be able to use the research component that you need. <br/>
	Research components are usually found on intelligent creatures,<br/>
or on creatures that are innately magical.</div>
