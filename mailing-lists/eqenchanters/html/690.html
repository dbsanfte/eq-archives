<b>Subject:</b> Re: Medium Sized Cloth Armor in Freeport <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-944866868">As you face the Freeport bank there is a shop to your right.  They have a<br/>
beautiful collection of very fashionable clothes there that are designed to<br/>
fit a human-sized individual.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;As the title says, is there anywhere in FP to purchase medium sized cloth<br/>
&gt;armor?  You would think being a human town there is, but so far all I can<br/>
&gt;find is 2 pieces for sale in North Ro. </span></blockquote></div>
