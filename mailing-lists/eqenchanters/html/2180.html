I upgraded my EIDE hard drive to an Ultra DMA hard drive. The difference in<br/>
zone load time was astounding.<br/>

&gt; WOW! That is a really long time.  I almost always am back before the<br/>
&gt; primary<br/>
&gt; looting rights have expired.  I am curious, what hardware do you use?  I<br/>
&gt; use<br/>
&gt; a PIII 450 with a 770ultra card and I have cable modem service. <br/>

&gt; 	For my mule, I create a human fighter and max out the str.  Then I<br/>
&gt; hunt in front of Qeynos to hit lvl 2.  This is just for comfort, a lvl 1<br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; a better than even chance of making the kill.  After that, just go kill<br/>
&gt; fishes until a corpse is found.  Log out.  Log back in with your main<br/>
&gt; character and loot the corpse.  No fuss. No muss.  No KOS.<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would do this, but it takes me 2 minutes to log out, and another 3<br/>
&gt; minutes<br/>
&gt; to log back in as the primary. By that amount of time, someone else has<br/>
&gt; looted the corpse or it has been &quot;eaten&quot; by the system.<br/>
