&gt; Why not Baels? I have gotten about 5 steins for other people, and I admit,<br/>
&gt; I feel kinda bad about it, but I have made decent money doing it. The<br/>
&gt; nicest person I helped complete the quest gave me 120 platinum and 6<br/>
&gt; research-only spells for bringing him merely an ingredient. This was an<br/>
&gt; Enchanter that couldnt get a Koalindl fish from Qeynos because his faction<br/>
&gt; with the Priests of Life was already KOS. Now that I know what others are<br/>
&gt; charging, I will insist that others be at least as nice as that person<br/>
was.<br/>
&gt; In my opinion, high level Enchanters (level 30+) have a great outlet for<br/>
&gt; making money. Not only can they brave the terrors of high level dungeons<br/>
&gt; and usually get some nice loot, but their jewelcraft skill is also high<br/>
&gt; enough that they are starting to make back the tons and tons of platinum<br/>
&gt; they dumped into improving the skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This Stein quest is a great way to make money for those Enchanters that<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; at the awkward 20th - 30th levels, where jewelcraft is still right around<br/>
&gt; the low to mid 100&#39;s, and you are still dumping money into it to become<br/>
&gt; good with gold and platinum. It burns me up when non-enchanters tell me<br/>
&gt; &quot;Man, Enchanters have it made. You have jewelcraft AND this Stein quest.&quot;<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; want to slap them in their stupid face. I have spent over 600 platinum on<br/>
&gt; jewelcraft and my skill is about 108 or so. 600 platinum. To other level<br/>
&gt; 20&#39;s that may not be much. But that is ALOT of money to me. ALOT more<br/>
&gt; platinum than I have MADE with jewelcraft.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe im not being as economical as I could be. If some of you other<br/>
&gt; Enchanters around my level have some advice on other ways to make money,<br/>
&gt; besides fighting your group members for scraps in dungeons, or hoping to<br/>
&gt; make decent coin fighing Aviaks and Centaurs, or surviving the trains in<br/>
&gt; Unrest, let me know, I would love to hear your advice :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is getting long, so i will sum up. This Stein quest may be an<br/>
&gt; Enchanter only quest, but thats what gives it such profit potential for<br/>
us.<br/>
&gt; I think it is a great way for 20th - 30th level Enchanters to make some<br/>
&gt; decent money and work on their jewelcraft, or buy some decent armor and<br/>
&gt; spells.  Sorry this is so long, and thanks for reading this far!<br/>

&gt; &gt;As I said before - I don&#39;t think we should get them for anyone!<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; i dont see going to get someone a stein a kindness. it&#39;s a service, one<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; they cant perform, ever. they need us. watch what happens if someone<br/>
asks<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; you to do it for them, and you say no. more often than not, when i was<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; asked and i said no, i was given rude remarks, as though it&#39;s my DUTY<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;go<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; get someone a stein. sorry, i dont want to waste my time fetching items<br/>
&gt; &gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; people, it&#39;s not why i play the game...<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; a kindness would be giving someone food, or doing something else for<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that they can normally do, but are under a circumstance where they<br/>
cannot<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; for now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; just MHO.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I have never charged anyone for a kindness.  I think charging to help<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; someone<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;is wrong.  But then...we all have our views.<br/>
