<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263633611">Yes it is possible. At 12lvl Last night I completed the Quest for <br/>
the Stine.  Clurg was indiferent to me and did not respond to my <br/>
hails so I held my breath and gave him the book anyway. And lo <br/>
and behold I got a stien.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;gate&gt; back to Freeport.  Appear and try to /auction the stine and <br/>
noone wanted to pay more than 100pp for it. That sounds too low <br/>
for me, so I was wondering if anyone has tried to sell them over <br/>
in Kel. Was thinking that maybe sence Kel was on another <br/>
contonet away from the quest I could get the 200pp for the stine <br/>
that I need.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else sold a stine lately?  is 200pp outragious? anyone <br/>
had luck selling the stine out side of Freeport/Commons?<br/>
<br/>
Keeping everyone up to date.<br/>
