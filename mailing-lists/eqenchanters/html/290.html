<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-365036064">I did a bit of research with my level 16 necro at the time. My enchanter is<br/>
still level 8 but from what I&#39;ve read so far, the research seems to work in<br/>
a very different way. Has anybody tried research with mages and wizards? is<br/>
it different also?<br/>
for necros, it&#39;s based on words ( like Word of divination ) that you need to<br/>
combine and for Enchanters, it seems to be based on pages of Lost Books that<br/>
need to be restored.</div>
