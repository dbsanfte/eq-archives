 </span></blockquote>Well, I cant say Ive tried extensivly... but, I have tried to mes the<br/>
guardian, and regular swirlpine horses to no avail. Like I said tho I havent<br/>
tried it extensively, but I have asked numerous 50 enchanters across the<br/>
Veeshan server and most have told me they cannot be mesd. If they CAN be<br/>
mesd it will take many attempts to get one because of the seahorses ultra<br/>
high MR.<br/>
<br/>
But we have also killed Phinigel without mes or charm. It&#39;s not easy, and we<br/>
did have a few deaths, but a good group of 18-24 people can take him and his<br/>
guards at once.<br/>
<br/>
When we go to Kedge again, I will attempt mes once more... i mean hell, if I<br/>
can mes an Ashenbone Drake in Hate, i can mes a stupid seahorse right? =)<br/>
<br/>
Ill let you know next time I kill the big fish.<br/>

As a relatively newbie enchanter I have some spell questions, sorry if they <br/>
seem stupid:<br/>
<br/>
If your pet is attacking while you cast mes will it continue to attack and <br/>
break mes or will it stop?<br/>
<br/>
Does lull have any use during battle? Or is it just good for an initial pull<br/>
<br/>
from a camp?<br/>
<br/>
I know an MoB is a monster, but what does MoB stand for?<br/>
<br/>

Welcome to the list, and to the subtle power that is an enchanter&#39;s life.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;ll break mez.  I&#39;m used to playing a necro, so not having pet control<br/>
is frustrating.  It seems likely (and from what I&#39;ve seen of higher-level<br/>
enchanters) that you simply stop casting your animation spell in a lot of<br/>
group situations - charm one as needed.  When soloing or in a duo or trio,<br/>
you maybe can instruct your tanks to assist your pet.<br/>

Subject: Level 20 research pages .. and evil eye .. questions<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the best mobs to look for to get Tasarin&#39;s pages 30 and 312<br/>
for beserker strength and color shift spells.  Since I fail repeatedly at<br/>
making them, and I see no one auctioning these pages, at this rate I will be<br/>
level 30 before I have them.  <br/>
<br/>
And looking ahead a bit as well, where should I go for the level 24 research<br/>
pages as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I was level 18 when I found out that Jonah and other Lake Rathe mobs give<br/>
level 16 ones out like candy.  Now those pages (for 16) are all I ever see<br/>
anywhere (I practically throw them away I have so many), but there must be<br/>
other treasure troves like Jonah for level 20 and 24 spells too (I hope). <br/>
<br/>
My poor (and I mean &#39;broke&#39;) level 21 enchantress has CHA and INT both just<br/>
over 130.  I am working hard on jewelcraft to try to fill in my (bare) ear<br/>
slots, and wrist slots in particular, but she currently sports damask or<br/>
leather or cloth underwear. A second question I have is .. at what level can<br/>
I successfully do Evil Eyes in the gorge (given the above stats, and with a<br/>
magic resist of 57).  <br/>
<br/>
My druid, with a partner druid, has a lot of trouble with them at level<br/>
25/26 (magic resist at base 25) but since evil eyes are enchanters, I hoped<br/>
we might be more successful at earlier levels? <br/>
<br/>
 I (my enchanter) often group with a level 21 cleric but I think we might<br/>
need another tank type to help out (unless my pet can take on that role?)<br/>
Evil eyes often seem to have both an animation and a mino pet, and they<br/>
throw blindness, fear, debuffs and charm on us. Can be wild there. Fun but I<br/>
am going steadily backwards with my druid so far.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help you can give me. I enjoy this list very much. <br/>

MoB is an old acronym for Mobile Offensive something or other I think.<br/>
Yes your pet will continue to attack and break Mez.<br/>
Lull is designed for pulls but the longer lasting versions lower a <br/>
monsters yell for help radius so can keep them from bringing others once <br/>
the battle has begun.<br/>
However they must be cast before combat and don&#39;t last very long so best <br/>
use is to help break a camp.<br/>

Mez the pet first.  If you then pop the eye before the mez wears off the <br/>
pet should pop.<br/>
I have done this in east karana with the Evil Eye that wanders there.<br/>
We had a party and killed the eye fast.<br/>
