<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967775666">Actually our pet will attack if we strike a creature. As soon as we hit they will join in. And Yes out pets are week but we can move in and  attack then back off and cast more spells. I didn&#39;t go into detail since there are many other tactics that we can use. Such as ambuses and things of that sort. Take a squad of six enchanters and park them outside the dark elf city and become a tree with minor illusion and pick them off with spells. They may know where one or two of us are but it is a good tactic. I have used to to get revenge on a PKer and he was dumbfounded. Every time he got near his body I would cast root and the Chaos Flux him several times  My killing him was a great joy since he was a wizard 1 level higher than me. He never really caught onto what had been hapening because I waited for him to start looting his corpse and then hit him with all  I had. he would get up and look around but nobody was there except a few trees (one of Which was me) Upon subsequesnt attemps to get his corpses He would carfully scout the area looking for anyone in sight. Once he even waited five minutes to loot just to make sure none stumbled by but even then I nailed him. <br/>

    hate to bust your bubble, but our pets suck, and they wont attack unless we get hit, so an army of enchanters going into a camp, rooting, then getting beat up so our pets can attack, then they die, then we die.<br/>

        OK I will make an attempt to change the tone of this gourp.<br/>
         <br/>
        I would like to form an enchanter Arm and march into battle with some enemy race. What I invision is an entire army of invisible Enchanter marching righ into the Enemy camp and out of no where summoning our pets and routing every one in sight.  Imagine multiple squads of 6 suddenly becoming 12  as we summon. Imagine marching to justwithin casting range and rooting every enenmy then casting  DOT spells while another unit moves in for with pets and finishes them up. If anyone of you would like to experiment with this let me know. I also think that it would make people think about the powers of enchanters. We do have some of the best spells out there but we have to use them a little more creatively.<br/>
         <br/>
        Thanks<br/>
