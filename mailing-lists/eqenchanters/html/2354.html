<div id="ygrps-yiv-926013208">I don&#39;t think any of the woven will give you the leather look.  In upper<br/>
Guk, however, there is the ancient Croc which can drop 2 nice leather look<br/>
items.  If you are a dark elf, there is a Troll in Neriak&#39;s 3rd gate who is<br/>
part of a quest.  He drops the &quot;Happy Love Bracers.&quot;  Lousy no drop items<br/>
(AC 1 wt. 5.0) BUT they look like green plate mail bracers.  We still want<br/>
that Frost Goblin skin that mages can wear.  That gives the chest leather<br/>
look.  <br/>
