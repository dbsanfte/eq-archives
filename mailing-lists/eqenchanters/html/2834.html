<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244530179">I was in Sebilis over the weekend with my 47 Enchanter (went with my 55<br/>
shaman all day Saturday for the first time).<br/>
<br/>
At level 47, 202 CHA and 193 INT, I found my 47 Enchanter suprisingly<br/>
effective. I got resisted on Enthrall about 10% of the time, maybe 20%. I<br/>
had two groups in Disco room and I was the only enchanter. Died once when we<br/>
had a 5 pull, but handled them long enough for all but one of the two<br/>
clerics to survive. That was the only mishapp in about 4 hours. Ilis<br/>
resisted a bit, but that was the only high one. Some needed to leave, so I<br/>
took a group to the zone out and we fought there for 4 more hours or so.<br/>
<br/>
The monk would pull to the corridor near zone out, and we&#39;d pull them into<br/>
the room. A couple of times, he got 4 casters and they were messin up his<br/>
FD. Instead of allowing him to die, I hit em with AE Mez. Did this about 5<br/>
times. Each time, I about died, but never lost a member. I never once tried<br/>
to charm tho. Might try that next time, but I&#39;d rather mez and let the tanks<br/>
take em out when they can get to em.<br/>
<br/>
Charming is fun tho, worth a death or two.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and my afternoon in Sebilis, I got half my level done in 47...2.5<br/>
bubbles of xp. And that&#39;s gropued with everyone else 51-54...<br/>

I have been hunting in Sebelis some and have some ideas to share on <br/>
charms.<br/>
<br/>
First let me say my tactics are for sure not perfect or to be used in <br/>
all situations but I think they are better than the ones I used when <br/>
I started.<br/>
<br/>
On multi pulls of say 3 to 4 froggies in Sebelis.  I use a Fasination <br/>
right off.  I ask the tanks to attack any that are not mezd or it did <br/>
not stick to.<br/>
<br/>
If more than one is not mezed, often they all are mezed, but <br/>
sometimes one or two resist.  I recast fascination.  Let them start <br/>
to work on the mob fist selected.<br/>
<br/>
Then I try to pick out a non caster type from the remaing mobs (non <br/>
wiz or shammy) and tash him and cast charm on him.  While I wait for <br/>
the fasinatioins to bust I root the mobs not charmed.<br/>
<br/>
Once it is broken I immediately cast dazzle on it or them.<br/>
<br/>
Then I tell my pet to attack the mob they are working on.  If not too <br/>
late i slow it.  But at minium i tash it.  I tash any remaining mobs <br/>
and then med a tad.  Maybe suck some mana from target if he is caster <br/>
type.<br/>
<br/>
Charming the baddie being tanked or one of the ae mezed ones is a <br/>
tactic I recommend on higher lvl baddies.<br/>
<br/>
I find charm is almost an essential tool now.  I am very excited <br/>
about the new charm I will get at 53 and cannot wait)<br/>
