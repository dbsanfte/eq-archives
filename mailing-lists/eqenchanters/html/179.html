<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084603078">the steel staff is the same stats as the Runed Totem staff .......its easier<br/>
to get.....it ISNT magic which sux.....but you also can buy it and you dont<br/>
have to risk your life to get one......plus what the hell dus 5 hitpoints do<br/>
for you when you fighting things that hit for 25 each time they hit<br/>
you......?.....and what dus 5 mana points do for you when you have<br/>
400?......hehe kinda silly I think.....same as those stupid totems that ppl<br/>
find....Ive had all of the totems I can handle and they suck!!!!......imn my<br/>
