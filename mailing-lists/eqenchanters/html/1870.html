<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954202615">i&#39;m sorry, but people who are complaining about this change... please shut<br/>
up about it. it&#39;s a freaking plus 10 INT, plus 5 DEX, plus 20 Sv Disease<br/>
item. in other words, an AWESOME item. it was too too too easy to get, and<br/>
we could hold it in either hand. there was NO penalty for using/having it.<br/>
i think it&#39;s a good idea that they are going to introduce some sort of<br/>
penalty for having it.<br/>
<br/>
do i think it&#39;s a good idea that they have to change it now? no. they<br/>
should have thought of it before they made the quest so damn easy. if they<br/>
had made it as hard as the GBS to get, then i wouldnt expect there to be<br/>
any penalty for having it. but since it was easy as hell, i would have.<br/>
<br/>
my idea is to leave the ones that are in the world as is, except make them<br/>
no drop. then anyone else who does the quest gets the new one, not the old<br/>
one. THAT would be the smart thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
sorry for the rant.<br/>
