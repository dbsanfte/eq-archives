<div id="ygrps-yiv-153189954">I don&#39;t know about you guys but i am Happy about the<br/>
tashan reducin... You have no clue how useful this<br/>
spell is. Normally an orc leggione is read to me and I<br/>
cast tashan on him succesfully almost always.. with<br/>
this spell and root i can kill it solo with a pet of<br/>
course and sometimes help. Tashan rocks cause it<br/>
lowers MOB Major More than you think. And with this<br/>
new patch i can get even better things... I thing this<br/>
is a major cool thing especially with faster casting<br/>
and lower mob cause i use this spell on almost every<br/>
critt especially in groups cause when a wizard can&#39;t<br/>
get any spells through my tashan spell will hlep him<br/>
major. COOL!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Not to be argumentative, but if you don&#39;t play an<br/>
&gt; enchanter why<br/>
&gt; &gt;do you post to this list?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then why are you? Being argumentative that is? Or<br/>
&gt; nosy? If he wants to post<br/>
&gt; so what? Also where does he say he isn&#39;t an<br/>
&gt; enchanter?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Why do you care about the mechanics of Whirl and<br/>
&gt; Mem Blur?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just curious. And what direct knowledge do you have<br/>
&gt; of the use of<br/>
&gt; &gt;these spells.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am sure you all have seen the list of spells. <br/>
&gt; But I really wanted to make<br/>
&gt; &gt;so comments.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Players will no longer crash when an extremely<br/>
&gt; long group message is<br/>
&gt; &gt;received.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Preventing the from crashing is always a good<br/>
&gt; thing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Added the ability to pull one item &quot;charge&quot; from<br/>
&gt; a stack by holding down<br/>
&gt; &gt;the &quot;Control&quot; key when left-clicking on the stack.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;For anyone who has ever tried to advance in a trade<br/>
&gt; skill this is a welcomed<br/>
&gt; &gt;change.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- After casting a spell at an NPC, if the target<br/>
&gt; were lost before the spell<br/>
&gt; &gt;made contact, the caster would crash.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This is a declaritive statement.  Did they fix it<br/>
&gt; or are they just<br/>
&gt; &gt;acknowleding it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- The &quot;/ignore&quot; command will now ignore emotes<br/>
&gt; also.<br/>
&gt; &gt;- The chat command &quot;/e&quot; will trigger &quot;/emote&quot;<br/>
&gt; instead of exiting to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;character selection screen.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Can&#39;t argue with change for the better.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- We have added new sound tracks to the Planes,<br/>
&gt; Crushbone, Guk, Mistmoore,<br/>
&gt; &gt;Steamfont, and the Estate of Un<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I would rather have the bug worked on over the<br/>
&gt; soundtracks but that is just<br/>
&gt; &gt;my own opinion.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- We have reduced the amount of experience lost<br/>
&gt; when dying by 50%.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This would have helped me 2 weeks ago when I hit<br/>
&gt; level 14, 13 different<br/>
&gt; &gt;times.  Probably my favorite of the non enchanter<br/>
&gt; changes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- A number of new quests have been added to various<br/>
&gt; zones.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;But the question is do they actually work?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Magician pets (elemental) will now cast minor<br/>
&gt; spells (to make up for their<br/>
&gt; &gt;lack of kick)<br/>
&gt; &gt;- New Magician spells on vendors and some Magician<br/>
&gt; spells have moved to<br/>
&gt; &gt;different vendors<br/>
&gt; &gt;- New Magician weapons for Summon Fang & Spear of<br/>
&gt; Warding & Dagger of<br/>
&gt; &gt;Symbols<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t play an enchanter but I am sure that they<br/>
&gt; will like this.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- New enchanter whirl spell (check the vendors)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Does anyone know what level this is for?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Whirl now works on MOBS better than it did on the<br/>
&gt; last patch.<br/>
&gt; &gt;- The saving throw against Memory Blur and Atone<br/>
&gt; was reduced (harder to save<br/>
&gt; &gt;against) from the last patch.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;THEY LISTENED!  I am suprised.  Although they<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t put it back to where it<br/>
&gt; &gt;was, I am happy.  Really it could be a sham, the<br/>
&gt; change could be only one<br/>
&gt; &gt;percentage point of resist and it would still be<br/>
&gt; true.  BUT they did listen<br/>
&gt; &gt;to us and made an attempt to apiece us.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- AC added to the Rune Series (Enchanter)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Don&#39;t have it yet but at least it isn&#39;t a<br/>
&gt; downgrade.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Alliance series works better (Enchanter)<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Enchanter Attack Speed spells now have longer<br/>
&gt; durations (Quickness,<br/>
&gt; &gt;Alacrity, etc.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Tashan (the entire Enchanter series) is now<br/>
&gt; quicker to cast, costs less<br/>
&gt; &gt;mana, and is harder to save against.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;What took so long?  These should not have been<br/>
&gt; patches after the game was<br/>
&gt; &gt;released.  Tashan has always been pretty useless<br/>
&gt; along with Alliance.  And I<br/>
&gt; &gt;told that the speed spells weren&#39;t worth the mana<br/>
&gt; for what you got.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- New bard songs have been added to the vendors<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Paladins lose the spell Bravery, and gain the<br/>
&gt; spell Valor<br/>
&gt; &gt;- ShadowKnights and Necromancers gain the Word of<br/>
&gt; Spirit spell (replacing<br/>
&gt; &gt;Word of Shadow for the ShadowKnight)<br/>
&gt; &gt;- ShadowKnights lose Haunting Corpse and gain<br/>
&gt; Summon Dead<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Necromancers and ShadowKnights get a new spell -<br/>
&gt; Shadow Vortex.<br/>
&gt; &gt;- ShadowKnights lose Intensify Death (replaced by<br/>
&gt; Shadow Vortex)<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Rangers lose Shield of Barbs and gain Shield of<br/>
&gt; Brambles<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Good for them....  =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Shorter stun effects will no longer remove longer<br/>
&gt; stun effects (Bash won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;get rid of whirl, for example)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Another example of Feedback in action.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;- Spell components are now stackable<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Again what took so long.  Why were they ever<br/>
&gt; created not stackable?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Don&#39;t let this stop any of your feedback or<br/>
&gt; petitions.  Tonight send a<br/>
&gt; &gt;feedback giving thanks for the improvements, but<br/>
&gt; also tell them what needs<br/>
&gt; &gt;to be improved.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;------<br/>
&gt; &gt;When the people we love are stolen from us, the way<br/>
&gt; to have them live on is<br/>
&gt; &gt;to never stop loving them.  Buildings burn, people<br/>
&gt; die, but real love is<br/>
&gt; &gt;forever.  -- The Crow<br/>
