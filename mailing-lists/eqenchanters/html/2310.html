How much of the enchanter&#39;s roll is reduced on these servers?  Spells that<br/>
would<br/>
be hard to use in NON-PK situations (ie normal grouping) - like<br/>
Mezmerization,<br/>
all the Color series of stuns, grav flux (this one would be funny as hell if<br/>
it<br/>
didn&#39;t get the entire party killed), etc.  What does this leave the<br/>
enchanter<br/>
with?  Hope your tanks resist or do you go up and whack on your group member<br/>
to<br/>
break the mes?<br/>

I can&#39;t speak for Rallos Zek where everyone can hurt everyone else within 4<br/>
levels of their level, but on Tallon the &quot;cross-teaming&quot; enchanters have a<br/>
more difficult time because they can&#39;t use those spells.  However, I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure that on Rallos, the spells won&#39;t hurt your party members but<br/>
will hurt their pets (go figure) making them go aggro on you.  Maybe it<br/>
works the same way on the Race war zeks, but I&#39;ve never cross-teamed so I<br/>
don&#39;t really worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
Funny story:  There was a huge battle in South and North Karana of the<br/>
Lights vs. the Darks (the Lights being the 3 other teams - Team shortie:<br/>
Dwarves, gnomes, halflings - Team elf: High elves, half-elves, wood elves -<br/>
Team Blind: Humans, Erudites, Barbarians).  After a great battle on the<br/>
South Karana bridge, the lights retreated into North Karana or were killed<br/>
in South Karana, and the Darks moved into North Karana to give chase.<br/>
During these big 50 on 50 battles I always fight under an illusion.  It is<br/>
much easier for them to target an Ogre or a dark elf, than to realize that<br/>
gnome is really a dark elf.  So I zone in and begin AE Mesmerization,<br/>
stopping a good many of them.  Then Enthralling the ones not actively<br/>
engaged.  After a few AE mezzes, a shorty sends me a tell &quot;Easy on the AE<br/>
spells&quot;  - He still thought I was the illusioned race and was hitting him<br/>
accidentally!  After Enthralling him two more times (ha ha) he figured out<br/>
what I was really doing.  Later on he told me he had to do a /guildstatus<br/>
Drexia to figure it out.  During the whole night, he was the only one to<br/>
figure it out.  That tells you how safe we can be under illusion.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never been attacked running through High Pass (that is solid Lightie<br/>
territory) thanks to illusion.  And had no trouble buying spells from Erudin<br/>
or completing the Stein quest.  The team PvP servers are so much fun.<br/>
