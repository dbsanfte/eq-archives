<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179565031">OK.  From the recent posts, a lot of people are upset about the changes to<br/>
enchanters in pvp.  My question is why?  I have not tried pvp and have no<br/>
reference.  Isn&#39;t the point still to kill npc&#39;s for loot and exp?  In pvp,<br/>
does that change?  I mean, Do you get loot or exp from fighting other<br/>
players?  <br/>
