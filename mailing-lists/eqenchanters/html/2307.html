&gt;Subject: Re: how to fight PVP without charm fear??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll give you my personal strategies, but I&#39;ve only won about 50/50, as<br/>
&gt;there are some VERY skilled PK&#39;s on RZ (I.E. Alec of darkenbane for<br/>
&gt;example).  Really I believe that equally skilled enchanter vs. necromancer<br/>
&gt;means quite a lot of pain for both parties, and ANY other class would fall<br/>
&gt;more easily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am level 35, and these are DUELLING spells, since these isnt a general<br/>
&gt;purpose spell bank and you&#39;ll never catch me with these particular spells<br/>
&gt;memorized while I&quot;m fighting most MoBs<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. spells I memorize<br/>
&gt;tashani<br/>
&gt;curse of the simple mind<br/>
&gt;mana seive<br/>
&gt;entrance<br/>
&gt;root<br/>
&gt;tepid deeds<br/>
&gt;chaos flux<br/>
&gt;anarchy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This assumes that I&#39;ve been able to call a pet, give it a dagger, and buff<br/>
&gt;it with alcrity, obscure, rune3, and feedback.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2. spells cast<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The first thing you HAVE to do is entrance the skelly pet.  if you dont do<br/>
&gt;this your own pet will simply fight the necros pet, and most likely lose.<br/>
&gt;Then tasani the necro, followed by entrancing him.  Cast curse of the simple<br/>
&gt;mind on him, sit and forget curse of the simple mind and memorize strip<br/>
&gt;enchantment.  As soon as this spell is available stand up and cast it on him<br/>
&gt;twice.  Enthrall the pet again.  If the necro is STILL entranced, hit<br/>
&gt;him/her with a mana seive or two until they begin casting on you.  (A wise<br/>
&gt;necro will cast a small DoT on himself to prevent being entranced, so be<br/>
&gt;careful).... entrance the necro again.  sit and med until he wakes up.  at<br/>
&gt;this point it becomes a matter of mana remaining, and I usually choose to<br/>
&gt;blast blast blast (no DoT for me to cast, I dont care for them in PvP) but<br/>
&gt;you can continue to enthrall the pet.  NOTE: if your OWN pet is attacking<br/>
&gt;the necromancer you wont be able to entrance him, but really you wont need<br/>
&gt;to... in THIS situation Tepid Deeds is one debuff you HAVE to cast on him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3. spells I&#39;ve found to be useless when they&#39;d be great in PvP if they<br/>
&gt;worked<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;a)Whirl spells - too short, slow casting, slow recast time... a damn shame<br/>
&gt;this could be a great spell.<br/>
&gt;b)charm and fear - damn verant, damn you to HELL.  I was killed by a level<br/>
&gt;50 wizard after being feared by a Necro NPC, now why can MoBs fear us but we<br/>
&gt;cant fear us?<br/>
&gt;c)DoT - Personally, too slow for me, although the damage to mana ratio is<br/>
&gt;quite good<br/>
&gt;d)weaken debuffs - its a casting fight.  I definately use these when<br/>
&gt;fighting a melee class, ESPECIALLY monks<br/>
&gt;e)color flux line - handy for PvP but I&#39;m afraid to hit my pet so I dont use<br/>
&gt;it.  If I have no pet this is a spell I use constantly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d really love to hear other enchanter strategies for PvP, I know there are<br/>
&gt;flaws in my strategy but this has worked for me so I dont alter it too much.<br/>
&gt;Of course this guide is a perfect situation, and I know that if we&#39;re caught<br/>
&gt;unawares we can be toast rather quick... of course I think we&#39;re the best<br/>
&gt;class for getting away alive as well, too bad we dont have shadow step<br/>
&gt;too!!!<br/>
