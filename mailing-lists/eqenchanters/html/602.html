&gt; Hi fellow enchanters,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ive some questions on fighting strategies with the pet, and the actual<br/>
&gt; how-to:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. my pet went into melee with some unwanted mob, and i have a safe<br/>
&gt; position<br/>
&gt; and want the pet to come back to keep it alive, but i found no way to<br/>
&gt; to get<br/>
&gt; the pet to do so? I just watch the pet getting slain and another 3<br/>
&gt; dagger<br/>
&gt; going lost.. any suggestions?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	[Hapke, Matthew]  NOpe. No suggestions. This is the life of our<br/>
animations. Young , Dumb, and fealress.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. In group fighting with possibly more than one mob, i try to tag the<br/>
&gt; different monsters to cast my really fine enchanter spells, clicking<br/>
&gt; directly on the chest or head of a monster, and what did i tag? ... my<br/>
&gt; pet,<br/>
&gt; my partymembers... everything clickable in around the next five<br/>
&gt; miles... but<br/>
&gt; not the monster i want. F8 always tags my pet.. its quite useless.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes<br/>
&gt; i loose lots of seconds runnig forth and back or around the battle to<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; the mob tagged. The same with 3 orcs running towards us... strategy is<br/>
&gt; clear, just root, flux or mesmerize to control 2 of them and wait<br/>
&gt; until the<br/>
&gt; party slain the first... but the run nearly one orc inside the other,<br/>
&gt; chances to tag them in time to cast...zero. its a stupid handling<br/>
&gt; prob...and<br/>
&gt; that stupid pet is always in the line of sight. Suggestions?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	[Hapke, Matthew]  Click on the health bar of the group member<br/>
who is fighting the mob you want to attack, then type /assist  The<br/>
client will then target your group member&#39;s target. Very useful for<br/>
enchanters! You should teach your whole group this command so they can<br/>
concentrate on one Mob at a time, while you  mes the others and make<br/>
them wait their turn =)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. anyone ever casted a pet in befallen? i am getting mad about that,<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; pet is that nervous runnig around me, and is alwas really far from me,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; get into melee with everything that moves. Once i casted 4 pets<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; every 2 minutes i realized, oh the pet got lost somewhere i didnt even<br/>
&gt; hear<br/>
&gt; a taunting attacker... i run around there a lot, from one door to the<br/>
&gt; next,<br/>
&gt; and most times i dont even see, where my pet is, and where he gets<br/>
&gt; himself<br/>
&gt; slain this time. suggestions?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	[Hapke, Matthew]  This happens in all the dungeons. In Black<br/>
Burrow where I have spent a lot of time, my pet fequently gets left<br/>
behind. He does eventually make it out, but sometimes I have to go and<br/>
unstick him.<br/>
