<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116002495">You know, you have a good point, but you ruin it with the attitude that<br/>
because we complain that our spells are ruined, and we are not balanced with<br/>
other casters, that we are automatically level hungry powergamers.  I think<br/>
it is you who miss the point.  I was one of the earlier enchanters because<br/>
the class sounded so like what I wanted in the manual.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier, there were no animations, and they were all in HK.  No problem.  We<br/>
adapted.<br/>
Okay, we got animations, now suddenly resists mysteriously become worse.<br/>
Okay, again we adapted, and waited four our promised Tashan upgrade.  We get<br/>
our Tashini, but wait, our most valuable spell is suddenly made worthless.<br/>
<br/>
All of this has nothing to do with powergaming level mongering.  Add in the<br/>
fact we need to be agnostic or illusions are worthless, stupid quirks with<br/>
minor illusions, and the utter complete lack of any viable enchanting, and<br/>
you discover why people are quitting the class in droves.  I&#39;m glad you like<br/>
it, but most of us are not into such masochism.<br/>

I had a level 16 dark elf necro that I started on the first day of the<br/>
release. It took me 4 &#39;played&#39; days and a half to get it to level 16. then I<br/>
gave it up. I have now a level 16 enchanter. It took me 12 &#39;played&#39; days to<br/>
make it to 16... You think that&#39;s a problem for me? I had so much more fun<br/>
playing an enchanter. What&#39;s the deal with this level race? Sometimes I&#39;ll<br/>
spend an hour travelling back and forth just to say hi to a friend I havent<br/>
seen for a long time. Right now, I&#39;m hunting in CrushBone and I barely make<br/>
any xp where I could be soloing in Lavastorm and make a shit load of xp and<br/>
money..but what&#39;s the big deal? I enjoy playing Everquest a lot more now.<br/>
Powergaming is so boring. So are those people who start a race everytime  a<br/>
new server comes up.<br/>
<br/>
my 2 cents,<br/>
