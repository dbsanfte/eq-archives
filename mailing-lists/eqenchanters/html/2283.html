<br/>
Be very very careful if you are fighting near the entrance to Najena.  This has<br/>
happened to me and a friend of mine.  After being ambushed by 3 fire elementals<br/>
while looting my corpse (I just got all my armor, but my bags were on my<br/>
corpse)  I ran to the zone to Najena because there was no way I was going to<br/>
live otherwise.  Instead of zoning into the hallway where you&#39;re supposed to end<br/>
up, I ended up in a room full of Magicians and pets and was immediately killed.<br/>
I had to petition to get my corpse (which took 2 hours).  The GM that helped me<br/>
was very nice and pulled my corpse out to safety for me.  When this happened to<br/>
a friend of mine the GM&#39;s weren&#39;t quite so nice.  They didn&#39;t believe that he<br/>
just zoned in to avoid a monster they believed he was &quot;exploring&quot; in Najena (at<br/>
level 12!).  It took him 2 hours of arguing with a GM before he got his corpse<br/>
back.  Both GM&#39;s mentioned that this does happen occasionally at that zone edge<br/>
(the second GM said my friend&#39;s corpse was on the wrong side of the room :(  ).<br/>
I have no idea if or when they plan on fixing it. :(<br/>
<br/>
Has this happened to anyone else?<br/>

&gt; Solo hunting? Lavastorm is ok, you can hunt near Najena and zone if you have<br/>
&gt; a problem. Don&#39;t know how much gear you have, as you hit the harder things<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll need a magic weapon. Yard trash in Unrest is also very good at this<br/>
&gt; level, there&#39;s about 6 spawn spots inside the maze just past the fountains<br/>
&gt; where you will be off the tracks. I think the regular aviaks (not the<br/>
&gt; guards) in front of the Arena in Lake Rathe should be ok, though they may be<br/>
&gt; too low. There&#39;s also a lizard man camp in Rathe Mountains (one outrunner<br/>
&gt; and 2 in camp). The Southern Ro dervish camps have an outrunner at each that<br/>
&gt; you can go back and forth between or join a group doing one of the camps<br/>
&gt; (the east one is preferable, there&#39;s a safe area near the grass where you<br/>
&gt; can pull to and no ghouls or dry bones will wander through). The solo dervs<br/>
&gt; may spawn a little tough on occasion, but you can kite those using fear.<br/>
&gt; Might be able to do the orc camp in misty thicket, not sure exactly how high<br/>
&gt; they are, but level 10-12 I think. If you can get  4 or 5 people together,<br/>
&gt; the orc camps in Rathe Mountains are great experience and loot. There&#39;s all<br/>
&gt; my good spots (good as in loot, experience, and rarely occupied).<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am level 12 and looking for some good hunting grounds, I think I&#39;m gunna<br/>
&gt; &gt; try lavastorm today so I&#39;ll see how that goes.  But where was everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; favorite hunting grounds at level 12?<br/>
