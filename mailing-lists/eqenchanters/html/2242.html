&gt; Just curious as I have little experience with languages....<br/>
&gt; can you increase your language ability by grouping with someone and then<br/>
&gt; using group talk to increase skill?  The other member of the group won&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; anything out of it, I know, but will you?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, this is the most efficient way of increaseing your language skill.<br/>
Just get a group together, and spam eachother in the language you wish to teach<br/>
them.  Here&#39;s another hint.  You can teach a person up to 1 in skill better<br/>
than yours, so if you put a point in, you can teach your freind to 2.  Then you<br/>
zone.  He teaches you to 3.  Zone.  You teach him to 4.  Etc.</div>
