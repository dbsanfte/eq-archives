<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944273280">YOUR IN OUR WORLD NOW!!!......hehe<br/>
<br/>
            Well I can only tell you WHY I chose to be a Dark Elf as opposed<br/>
to all the other races.....I cant tell you ABOUT the pros and cons of all<br/>
cuase I havent played them all but......ok we have Dark Elf, High Elf,<br/>
Gnome, Human, and Erudite.....I chose the Dark Elf.....heres why.....The<br/>
second rank of spell for the Enchanter allows both invisibility as well as<br/>
the ability to morph yourlsef into a Half Elf and a Human......so this right<br/>
here sold it for me......what better tehn a char that can go into ANY<br/>
TOWN!!&gt;....as a Half Elf you can go into anytown.....and as a Dark Elf you<br/>
can go into all three evil towns.......that was it right there.....that is<br/>
the whole BIG DEAL for me.....HAHAHAH!!!.....<br/>
but seriously.....this to me would allow for an enchanter to shine.....the<br/>
Dark Elf has both high Charisma and semi high intelligence......these make<br/>
for great enchanters......you bump the wisdom and the charisma a little more<br/>
with your bonus attributes and you have your self the IDEAL enchatner fit<br/>
for jewelcrafting......which is where Im going with this.....heres why I<br/>
DIDNT pick any of the other races.......the HighElf and the Gnome are lumped<br/>
into the same categorie here.......all of Faydwer is WAAAAYYYY over<br/>
crowded.....I dont know what its like now but within the second week of<br/>
release there were over 162 players in Greater Faydark......and ths was<br/>
during OFF peak times.......Human.....well I personalyl feel that if your<br/>
gonna play EQ then dont play a human......by all means ppl if you wanna play<br/>
a human play UO.....this is a game of FANTASY and altered races.......BE<br/>
THOSE ALTERED RACES!! (only human I will make is a human Necromancer out of<br/>
Freeport)......ok so then lastly we have the Erudite and I personally would<br/>
have gone with this race as a second choice......if I wouldnt have gone evil<br/>
I would have gone with this char.......BUT I didnt like the location.....I<br/>
actually muled some (no flames please, I worked for my equipment either way<br/>
its mine) stuff over to my enchanter to get him started so I needed a much<br/>
better locationa nd since I have a 16th lvl Druid in<br/>
Rivervale.......Nektulos Forest just seemed like the right<br/>
logistics.......so those were my reasons.......have fun.....YOU WILL LOVE<br/>
THIS GAME!!!!<br/>
