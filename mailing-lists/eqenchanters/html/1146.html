<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470000247">I would ask what will be done to improve skills like cooking.  Will<br/>
better food be better for you at some point?  The other point I think<br/>
people were making was the fact that in several cases it is easy to<br/>
obtain magical equivalents from MOBs that a PC might make.  Jewelry<br/>
obtained naturally (hehe I like that term for killing everything that<br/>
moves) often has better enchantments than what can reasonably be made.<br/>
If it costs 100s of plat for a magic item to be made that players are<br/>
routinely obtaining from monsters, THAT is the main complaint I think.<br/>
<br/>
Cooking - if a person is fed the same by cupcakes and iron rations it<br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense to buy the more expensive item.  Is there a<br/>
difference?  I don&#39;t think so, but I might be missing something.  I<br/>
really hope there is a difference at some point.  Then, all the cool<br/>
things that can be cooked will mean something.<br/>
<br/>
Smithing - similar problems to jewelcraft.  Takes a long while and<br/>
commitment to become proficient at smithing (like anything else I guess)<br/>
but it&#39;s not too hard to obtain magical armor from monsters that<br/>
outperforms, is lighter than player made armor.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this isn&#39;t true at higher levels, but of course making higher<br/>
level stuff costs more to obtain the raw materials.  Unless...  you<br/>
obtain the materials naturally.  You can get ore from the muddites in<br/>
beholder maze and gems from monsters in various places so that might be<br/>
something to consider too.<br/>

Trade Skills:<br/>
The trade skills certainly could (and will) be made better, but the<br/>
whole<br/>
point of a player-driven economy is that an item is only worth what<br/>
another<br/>
player will pay for it -- it has no innate worth (other than the bare<br/>
minimum, which is what a merchant will pay for it). I&#39;d rather hear a<br/>
complaint that the items created via Jewellcrafting should have better<br/>
stats so that it would demand a better price (which in some cases may be<br/>
true) than that the trade is broke because it costs more to create the<br/>
item<br/>
then an NPC merchant will buy it back for.<br/>
