<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576726800">Unfortunately, there are no quests for spells for an enchanter, at least<br/>
until the high, high levels.  I wish there had been a quest like the cleric<br/>
one, but, hey, that is the breaks...  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone, Naeeldar is a respected and common poster on the Necro boards...<br/>
he is 40th something level last I checked, so he knows the basics of being<br/>
an Int caster extremely well.  He also has a vast store of knowledge in<br/>
general EQ, and is an excellent person to ask questions.<br/>
<br/>
The Tome of Endless Enchantments will handle all of your research needs...<br/>
The Book of Ancient Restoration was left over from Beta, but has no real<br/>
function that has been identified as of yet.<br/>
