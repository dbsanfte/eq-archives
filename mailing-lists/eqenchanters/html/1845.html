<div id="ygrps-yiv-296347113">Why not Baels? I have gotten about 5 steins for other people, and I admit,<br/>
I feel kinda bad about it, but I have made decent money doing it. The<br/>
nicest person I helped complete the quest gave me 120 platinum and 6<br/>
research-only spells for bringing him merely an ingredient. This was an<br/>
Enchanter that couldnt get a Koalindl fish from Qeynos because his faction<br/>
with the Priests of Life was already KOS. Now that I know what others are<br/>
charging, I will insist that others be at least as nice as that person was.<br/>
In my opinion, high level Enchanters (level 30+) have a great outlet for<br/>
making money. Not only can they brave the terrors of high level dungeons<br/>
and usually get some nice loot, but their jewelcraft skill is also high<br/>
enough that they are starting to make back the tons and tons of platinum<br/>
they dumped into improving the skill. <br/>
<br/>
This Stein quest is a great way to make money for those Enchanters that are<br/>
at the awkward 20th - 30th levels, where jewelcraft is still right around<br/>
the low to mid 100&#39;s, and you are still dumping money into it to become<br/>
good with gold and platinum. It burns me up when non-enchanters tell me<br/>
&quot;Man, Enchanters have it made. You have jewelcraft AND this Stein quest.&quot; I<br/>
want to slap them in their stupid face. I have spent over 600 platinum on<br/>
jewelcraft and my skill is about 108 or so. 600 platinum. To other level<br/>
20&#39;s that may not be much. But that is ALOT of money to me. ALOT more<br/>
platinum than I have MADE with jewelcraft.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe im not being as economical as I could be. If some of you other<br/>
Enchanters around my level have some advice on other ways to make money,<br/>
besides fighting your group members for scraps in dungeons, or hoping to<br/>
make decent coin fighing Aviaks and Centaurs, or surviving the trains in<br/>
Unrest, let me know, I would love to hear your advice :-)<br/>
<br/>
This is getting long, so i will sum up. This Stein quest may be an<br/>
Enchanter only quest, but thats what gives it such profit potential for us.<br/>
I think it is a great way for 20th - 30th level Enchanters to make some<br/>
decent money and work on their jewelcraft, or buy some decent armor and<br/>
spells.  Sorry this is so long, and thanks for reading this far!<br/>

&gt;As I said before - I don&#39;t think we should get them for anyone!<br/>

&gt;&gt; i dont see going to get someone a stein a kindness. it&#39;s a service, one<br/>
&gt;&gt; they cant perform, ever. they need us. watch what happens if someone asks<br/>
&gt;&gt; you to do it for them, and you say no. more often than not, when i was<br/>
&gt;&gt; asked and i said no, i was given rude remarks, as though it&#39;s my DUTY to<br/>
&gt;go<br/>
&gt;&gt; get someone a stein. sorry, i dont want to waste my time fetching items<br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;&gt; people, it&#39;s not why i play the game...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; a kindness would be giving someone food, or doing something else for them<br/>
&gt;&gt; that they can normally do, but are under a circumstance where they cannot<br/>
&gt;&gt; for now.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; just MHO.<br/>

&gt;&gt; (let&#39;s see who reaches 30 first, heh)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I have never charged anyone for a kindness.  I think charging to help<br/>
&gt;&gt; someone<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;is wrong.  But then...we all have our views.<br/>
