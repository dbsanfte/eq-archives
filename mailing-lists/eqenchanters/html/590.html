<b>Subject:</b> Re: Runed totem staff magic? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829749853">The EASY way to get a runed totem staff is goto Lake Rathe Tear. It&#39;s<br/>
connected to the Mountians of Rathe or South Karana zones. There is a spawn<br/>
near the South Karana zone entrance of 11 gnolls. High shaman gnolls spawn<br/>
there that very often drop runed totem staffs. The camp there spawns undead<br/>
by night, gnolls by day. It supports lvl&#39;s 7-22. Enjoy!!<br/>
