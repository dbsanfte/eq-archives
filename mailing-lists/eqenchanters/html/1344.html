  Subject: [eqenchanters] something i found<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  i was looking through some of my links on enchanter sites when i found this passage<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;In other news: Yes, the new jewelry patch is everything we could have asked for, BUT.  I highly recommend you be careful selling and crafting items.  Magical items crafted under the new patch WILL vanish if you enter certain zones.  Qnos is one of these areas, I have no doubt there are others.  Craft at your own risk, and I do advise you notify everyone you sell to to be careful where they go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  this is disturbing news, and perhaps a flaw? or not true, has anyone experienced this problem? or know anything about it?<br/>
