<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020775382">this post dates indeed. I was around level 13 or 14 at the time. I&#39;ve<br/>
changed my tactics quite a lot since.<br/>
the major change would be that when I solo, I dont use debuffs at all<br/>
anymore. I use tashan, dot, whirl, damage, whirl, damage, etc..<br/>
when I fight with a group, I dont whirl anymore, I root instead. Root lasts<br/>
longer and keeps all spellcasters safe. if you have a level 20 wizard in<br/>
your group, the monster wont live long anyway.<br/>
when fighting big reds, I always cast Tashan ( now that it&#39;s less resisted )<br/>
so that fellow wiz and mages can do more damage. I also cast berserker<br/>
strength and quickness on all the tanks right before the fight. That usually<br/>
takes care of most of my mana. Also when fighting reds, I use memory blur a<br/>
lot. I&#39;ve saved many people with that. When this nasty centaur courser comes<br/>
on your wizard and start pounding on it for 74 damage, that&#39;s a great way to<br/>
save him, much more reliable and much quicker than taunting. spellcasters<br/>
should also always root a monster when a fellow spellcaster is attacked<br/>
directly. I have a macro that YELLS to my group BACK OFF! STOP ATTACKING!<br/>
That is when the fight is turning too nasty. I hit this macro, give them 5<br/>
seconds and blur the memory of the enemy. That works great for centaurs and<br/>
aviaks, wouldnt work with agro monsters though..<br/>
<br/>
About your fear technique, it&#39;s cool, I&#39;ve done that too but you really have<br/>
to do this in a safe place. At the time, I tried that on a young kodiak in<br/>
west commons and ended with a horde of adult ones on me! Dont even try that<br/>
in dungeons. Also, I recommend not using pets in dungeons, especially our<br/>
pets. you cant tell them to stop attacking. I had my pet chasing a froglok<br/>
in Guk for a long time, and at some point, it died. About one minute later,<br/>
I see from a distance a huge mob coming my way, I was dead in instants, hit<br/>
about 10 times for 45 damage by 10 high level ( at the time ) frogloks. That<br/>
is an extreme case but it happens. also, charm is much better in dungeons.<br/>
my 2 more cents,<br/>

Sorry to be replying to such an old post, but I don&#39;t<br/>
check my mail often. This is not meant to be a flame<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; well it&#39;s quite simple really..<br/>
&gt; 1) Hunt close to a zone point except if you have<br/>
&gt; spirit of the wolf. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A fine tactic, works well. I&#39;d say that for any class<br/>
EXCEPT the enchanter it&#39;s almost necessary. For the<br/>
enchanter, it isn&#39;t necessary at all. Safer true, you<br/>
can&#39;t always be sure what&#39;s going to happen, or how<br/>
much mana you&#39;re going to be down, but not really<br/>
necessary as long as you keep your wits, and fight<br/>
smart.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) Always be the first to run in a party, at least<br/>
&gt; before your tanks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Umm, never. I&#39;m usually one of the last to run. While<br/>
they&#39;re running, I&#39;m busy mesmerizing, fearing, etc.<br/>
the mobs to give us a chance of making it out alive.<br/>
Don&#39;t be such a fraidy cat.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) keep the mob off you by using mesmerize every 3<br/>
&gt; or 4 spells you cast ( do<br/>
&gt; that with your pet too ).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sound advice, better yet don&#39;t burn so much mana that<br/>
you&#39;ve taunted the sucker on you so badly in the first<br/>
place, less downtime too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4) soloing becomes much easier at level 12 when you<br/>
&gt; get whirl till you<br/>
&gt; hurl..your pet can then stay alive more than 10<br/>
&gt; second,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So many people overlook Fear, Level 4, it basically<br/>
has the same effect as whirl, you just don&#39;t stay in<br/>
the same place.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5) do not solo. we are not a soloing class. I havent<br/>
&gt; soloed since level 5.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve solo&#39;d plenty, level 13 now and going strong.<br/>
Against yellow mobs, several blues, whatever. You can<br/>
solo just fine, better even than most classes in my<br/>
opinion, but then, hey what do I know?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6) to make a lot of xp, try parties of 2. With the<br/>
&gt; debufs you can make any<br/>
&gt; yellow a blue or a green, and while you focus on<br/>
&gt; that, your partner can<br/>
&gt; easily take care of the monster.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely true. I solo a lot like I said, but my<br/>
preference is to have one or two other good people<br/>
along. The reason? Less downtime, I usually have a<br/>
good amount of mana left over after the fight, instead<br/>
of being down to one exit bubble left :) I call it the<br/>
exit bubble because it&#39;s the one that I only actually<br/>
use if my intent is to &#39;exit stage left&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 7) in large parties ( 6 people ), when attacking one<br/>
&gt; big red...well stay<br/>
&gt; aside because you are useless anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This point I concede, but there are a few things you<br/>
can still do. Hit it with Tashan, whack it, try to<br/>
taunt it enough so that it tries to hit you, and your<br/>
pet joins in, even resisted spells are a taunt. Better<br/>
yet, charm something nearby to get into the action and<br/>
help out a bit, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 8) in large parties, when attacking a bunch of blues<br/>
&gt; to yellow, try to<br/>
&gt; switch target quite often so you will have a better<br/>
&gt; overall effect over the<br/>
&gt; battle and no monster will especially get mad at you<br/>
&gt; and come for you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a large battle your tanks should all be fighting<br/>
the same mob, the rest is up to you to control. If<br/>
there&#39;s anything an Enchanter excels at, it is crowd<br/>
control. Even if your party could take all the mobs on<br/>
at once, there&#39;ll be fewer chances and less downtime,<br/>
if you keep the ones you aren&#39;t currently fighting,<br/>
out of the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Also<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; keep charm handy in case your pet dies.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or your pet spell, same reason.<br/>
<br/>
 Always warn<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your group that you<br/>
&gt; might charm a monster BEFORE battle, and always warn<br/>
&gt; them that the charmed<br/>
&gt; creature will eventually come back for you and no<br/>
&gt; taunting will get it off<br/>
&gt; you so they have to watch and protect you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is true no taunting will get it off of you, that&#39;s<br/>
what blur, and/or mesmerize are for. I tell my party<br/>
just to keep an eye out, and let me handle it. Tashan,<br/>
Color Flux, back up, Mesmerize. Works every time,<br/>
well, usually :)<br/>
<br/>
Let them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; also know how mesmerize<br/>
&gt; works so they dont attack stunned creatures<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A must in every party. I try to simplify it for the<br/>
stupid warriors in the group :) I tell them all to use<br/>
/assist and never target a mob on their own. I pick<br/>
out &lt;insert name of tanktype who has some brains&gt;<br/>
to be the targetter, he&#39;s the only one who is allowed<br/>
to target a mob, everyone else must assist him. Leaves<br/>
me free to do my thing :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 9) One big life saver: do not panic! most<br/>
&gt; spellcasting class have one thing<br/>
&gt; to do when some monster start pounding on you: RUN!<br/>
&gt; but not us! Stay calm!<br/>
&gt; if you&#39;re under 2 bubs of hp you&#39;ll die if you run<br/>
&gt; anyway. cast root ( fast<br/>
&gt; to cast ) right after an attack, back off, cast<br/>
&gt; mesmerize and then RUN LIKE<br/>
&gt; HELL. That saved me a million times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d agree with everything you have said here, except<br/>
for the last &quot;RUN LIKE HELL&quot; part. Panic is useless,<br/>
an enchanter who shows fear is a dead enchanter. I&#39;d<br/>
like to point out, that in most cases, once a creature<br/>
has been mesmerized it won&#39;t come back after you, so<br/>
running isn&#39;t really necessary. Be prudent and back<br/>
off to a place you feel safe at, but no need to be too<br/>
worried.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 10) explore to find nice hunting areas suitable for<br/>
&gt; your level and close to<br/>
&gt; a zone. One of my favorites recently has been<br/>
&gt; lavastorm mountains, near the<br/>
&gt; najena entrance. Lots of xp, lots of loot, and a<br/>
&gt; very close zone point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Haven&#39;t been there, sounds like fun. Though your<br/>
insistence on zoning sounds like you might rather be a<br/>
wizard. They do more damage you know, and most of the<br/>
ones I&#39;ve met enjoy waiting for zones to load as much<br/>
as you sound like you do. MOST of the time, you don&#39;t<br/>
need to zone, we are one of the few classes who can<br/>
say that, if not the only.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 11) Ah! I forgot! USE THE LURE METHOD. Do not run<br/>
&gt; into mob, make it come to<br/>
&gt; you at a safe point, even if you have to run 30s<br/>
&gt; with it on your tail before<br/>
&gt; you get there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a party this is pretty much usually the case<br/>
anyways in my experience. If you&#39;re soloing however,<br/>
casting minor illusion will help keep any unwanted<br/>
mobs from being too interested about the bag and the<br/>
bear fighting each other :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 12) play with the mouse! arrow keys dont allow to<br/>
&gt; turn around quickly enough<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No comment, as I stuck my nose in to talk about<br/>
enchanters.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; my 12 cents,<br/>
&gt; Skara<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Finally in response to the post that mentioned getting<br/>
kicked by blues, here&#39;s how to solo a yellow. :) Not<br/>
the only way btw, just one of the safest.<br/>
<br/>
Pet up, all buffs on, find a lone yellow, take your<br/>
time at this, better to be sure it&#39;s just one, than to<br/>
pull several yellows on your butt. No undead, not for<br/>
this tactic anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Tashan<br/>
back up once attacked, let pet into the fight.<br/>
&lt; be quick here, you don&#39;t want the pet to die if you<br/>
can help it &gt;<br/>
Choke, or best DoT you have<br/>
Fear<br/>
run behind whacking it for a while, then back off<br/>
before fear wears off, pet&#39;s still going at it.<br/>
Tashan<br/>
Wait til the instant the mob turns on your pet again.<br/>
Choke<br/>
Fear<br/>
at this point take stock because your mana will be<br/>
kind of low, if you really don&#39;t think this is going<br/>
well, now is the time to run, while it&#39;s currently<br/>
running from you. Most of the time, things should be<br/>
pretty smooth up til now, here&#39;s where you start<br/>
taking a few chances.<br/>
If you decide to stick it out, remember to always keep<br/>
that last bubble for a final mesmerize or two if the<br/>
first is resisted, you should have taken little or no<br/>
damage yet, pet might be down a bit, especially if you<br/>
didn&#39;t quite time it right, but the mob will be down a<br/>
lot, and you still have that DoT working away at its<br/>
hp&#39;s.<br/>
Run behind it whacking it, if you have a little mana<br/>
left over, give it a chaotic feedback brainsmoldering<br/>
kick, and then wade in and start taking the brunt of<br/>
the damage when the fear wears off, circling around so<br/>
your pet&#39;s still hitting it in the back.<br/>
By now it should be dead.<br/>
If, however, you take more than half damage, cast<br/>
mesmerize, stop attacking, it&#39;ll turn on your pet,<br/>
back way up, look at it&#39;s health, chances are very<br/>
good that if it isn&#39;t dead yet, it soon will be. Throw<br/>
a final spell at it to finish it off, wade in and give<br/>
it those last couple whacks, or if you have neither<br/>
the hp, mana, or backbone left, finally run to a<br/>
gaurd, chances are it&#39;ll be so damaged it won&#39;t be<br/>
able to keep up with you. Keep that last bit of mana<br/>
around for a final mesmerize if it can though, just in<br/>
case.<br/>
Finally if it still isn&#39;t dead, is running after you<br/>
and hitting you, your pet has died, and the gaurd or<br/>
zone is too far away, face the mob.<br/>
Don&#39;t attack, mesmerize. interrupted. mesmerize.<br/>
interrupted. mesmerize.<br/>
a &lt;mob&gt; has been mesmerized.<br/>
Go find a safe place to rest, do a quick med and cast<br/>
minor illusion, think about how you timed everything,<br/>
what you could have done differently and try it again<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
All that was a worse case scenario soloing a yellow<br/>
mob. In most cases, after the second round of Choke,<br/>
Fear, whack away at it&#39;s back, it&#39;ll be dead right<br/>
around the time when the second Fear runs out. For a<br/>
blue mob, the first round should be plenty.<br/>
<br/>
This is for level 12 to 15, haven&#39;t gotten to 16 yet.<br/>
For level 4 to 11 substitute Suffocating Sphere for<br/>
Choke, and cast it a bit more often, everything else<br/>
should be about the same.<br/>
