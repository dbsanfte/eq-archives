&gt;<br/>
&gt;They sell in shops for 6k plat or so but if you try and sell them there you<br/>
&gt;only get offered a few plat i think.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they fixed that and they now sell for like 15 plat in stores.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;They are corpse retrieval tools but last night on Ec&#39;i I got a message from<br/>
&gt;someone who had bouhgt one and couldn&#39;t figure out how to make it work. He<br/>
&gt;had tried right and left clicking, and having it in his hand slot. When I<br/>
&gt;zoned he was about to try with the person in his group and targetted. So<br/>
&gt;unless you have palt to spare I would hold off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it doesnt find someone&#39;s body specifically, it find the nearest corpse, i<br/>
believe (this is what i was told).<br/>
