<div id="ygrps-yiv-443179335">Greetings all.<br/>
<br/>
After talking with an AOL user today, I realized that <br/>
many of them don&#39;t know about a program that will <br/>
disable the Idle timer.  The &quot;click OK or you will be <br/>
booted&quot; message.<br/>
Below is a web page that has one for download.  If you <br/>
don&#39;t like this one, the seach string to enter into your <br/>
browser is: &quot;aol timer&quot;.<br/>
Some of the sites this search brings up will want you to <br/>
pay for it.  If you find those, keep looking.  Remember <br/>
to scan for viruses and use Dr. Solomons for Trojan <br/>
detection.<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

long.  :P</div>
