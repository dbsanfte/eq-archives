<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179926891">I wish that price-lists and standardized pricing really worked, but no<br/>
matter how hard we try, it doesn&#39;t have much chance of succeeding.  Why?<br/>
<br/>
1) Enchanter Jerks - For whatever reason, there are those who insist on<br/>
ruining jewelcraft for the rest of us by charging little or nothing for<br/>
their wares or by undercutting us at every turn. These false enchanters are<br/>
just interested in earning a quick buck, not in jewelry as a long-term and<br/>
useful skill.  <br/>
<br/>
2) Market Flooding - Even on Prexus (a fairly new server) the silver market<br/>
is already totally flooded.  People don&#39;t know or don&#39;t care about the money<br/>
you sink into the skill, they have seen on other servers or on the current<br/>
servers that the prices are low to the ground and refuse to pay a reasonable<br/>
amount for silver.  If we try to save the market, it will have to be for<br/>
electrum or higher.<br/>
<br/>
3) Non-Enchanter Items - It&#39;s even more frustrating to be undercut by a<br/>
non-enchanter selling a similar loot item for no money.   They paid nothing<br/>
to get it and can undercut us any day of the week.  Given the option of<br/>
paying 7-8 plat for an enchanter-made intelligence ring or 5-6 plat for a<br/>
similar loot item with an extra armor class bonus, who will choose the<br/>
former? (example:  +3 charisma necklace - a couple plat to make if no<br/>
failures versus a doll that does the same thing - 7 gold to buy or free to<br/>
loot).<br/>
<br/>
4) We can&#39;t make what they want - True, some jewelry (int, str, mana, etc)<br/>
sells decently.  But, so many more want mana earrings or intelligence<br/>
bracers or whatever that will never be an option for us.  (&quot;What earrings do<br/>
you have?&quot; &quot;Only Stamina ones&quot; &quot;Oh, sorry, I need _____ ones&quot;).  Then, they<br/>
go off in search of the loot item that will give them what they need.  <br/>
<br/>
Does this mean we shouldn&#39;t try?  Of course not, but don&#39;t expect a miracle<br/>
because we set the price for jade mana rings at say 10 pp per ring<br/>
throughout the servers.  We need to educate people ... maybe a seminar or<br/>
something where we all get together and sell our wares at the standard price<br/>
and try to let the populace know why we sell them for that much and how the<br/>
+2s and such all add up to help them out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not interested in making a whole lot of money with jewelcraft (that&#39;s<br/>
what my brewing skill is for), but I do want to make enough money to be able<br/>
to raise my skill.  For now, I mainly sell back unenchanted stuff to vendors<br/>
or sell/trade for gems with my guildmembers to get money for my skill until<br/>
I get to electrum.  Then, perhaps the market will be more willing to buy my<br/>
stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who can easily sell items for what they are worth ...<br/>
perhaps you can give a seminar to those of us who keep finding ourselves<br/>
with unsellable product and dozens of tells from people who find out the<br/>
price we charge and either say they don&#39;t have enough money or run away from<br/>
us laughing to their nearest loot monster.<br/>
<br/>
We can save electrum if we start now.  Don&#39;t be discouraged, we just need to<br/>
teach people the worth of our products and come up with a valid reason for<br/>
them to buy at our prices.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening<br/>
