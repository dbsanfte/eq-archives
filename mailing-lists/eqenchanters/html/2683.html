<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108945541"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;1&gt; How do I get into Neriak without a guard playing squish the elf with me?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Getting into any city that is KoS is never really very difficult. I usually<br/>
cast invis on myself, with both the Illusion spell of the race of the city,<br/>
and my highest alliance spell, which is currently collaberation. Zone in,<br/>
illusion, cast collaberation on the first guard I see... done, now im<br/>
usually at least apprehensive to them.<br/>
<br/>
2&gt; Can you have an animation and a charmed pet at the same time?.<br/>
<br/>
Nope, but Ill say this, your pet is very reliable... your charmed pet<br/>
however, can be very powerful.<br/>
<br/>
3&gt; Do charmed pets follow commands?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can tell them commands<br/>
<br/>
4&gt; Mez never seems to do anytime for me.  What am I missing?<br/>
<br/>
You must be soloing at level 5 like I was =) Mez is a GREAT spell, and the<br/>
enchanters way of life. It is used on the mobs that you are NOT fighting.<br/>
If your tank pulls 4 mobs, instead of getting beat to death, mes the 3 that<br/>
you are not fighting, and they will stand their and wait their turn for<br/>
death.<br/>
Careful tho, mesmerize (lvl 4), lasts only 15 seconds, your higher level<br/>
entrance spells will last much longer.<br/>
<br/>
5&gt; Why does my pet always stand on what I&#39;m trying to loot?<br/>
<br/>
He wants to follow you. Hes dumb.<br/>
<br/>
6&gt; Is being agnostic going to cause grief later?<br/>
<br/>
Religion is not a big thing right now, and in general agnostic has allowed<br/>
many players a greater freedom. I choose to worship a diety, because I think<br/>
its neat to show my religion... besides im an enchanter, and can get into<br/>
any city anyway.<br/>
The only thing I might warn, is agnostic sometimes makes your own kind<br/>
indifferent and not want to talk to you nicely and offer quests for you.<br/>
That and the fact of Verant starting to put in diety specific items. So if<br/>
an item drops for an enc and its a diety, you wont be able to use it... only<br/>
one item like this has been found at this time.<br/>
<br/>
7&gt; Any other tips you might have would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

200p for a stein is a good price.  people will still pay around 250.  The<br/>
trick is to happen to be in the right place at the right time.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
had much luck at times in greater feydark GF trying to sell things and other<br/>
times you happen to meet the right person and trade a bunch of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a stein and are trying to sell it, remember that you can get the<br/>
next stein prepared while you still have the first stein.  You can hold a<br/>
stein, the compendium from Gregor, and items to make the compendium at the<br/>
same time.  So, as soon as you sell the 1st stein you are ready to hit Ogguk<br/>
to make the next one because when you do sell there will probably be 2<br/>
people who want it at the same time of all things.<br/>

Yes it is possible. At 12lvl Last night I completed the Quest for <br/>
the Stine.  Clurg was indiferent to me and did not respond to my <br/>
hails so I held my breath and gave him the book anyway. And lo <br/>
and behold I got a stien.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;gate&gt; back to Freeport.  Appear and try to /auction the stine and <br/>
noone wanted to pay more than 100pp for it. That sounds too low <br/>
for me, so I was wondering if anyone has tried to sell them over <br/>
in Kel. Was thinking that maybe sence Kel was on another <br/>
contonet away from the quest I could get the 200pp for the stine <br/>
that I need.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else sold a stine lately?  is 200pp outragious? anyone <br/>
had luck selling the stine out side of Freeport/Commons?<br/>
<br/>
Keeping everyone up to date.<br/>

<br/>
Ulgarth, 	<br/>
	I like the easy questions.  Here are some answers.<br/>
<br/>
1.  At level 8(?) you will get Illusion Dark Elf.  This will make them like<br/>
you enough not to squish you. If you can&#39;t wait until then, you can invis<br/>
yourself and run quickly.<br/>
<br/>
2.  You can only have one pet at a time. Animated or charmed.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Charmed pets do follow commands.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Not sure what you are asking here.  The spell duration is short, maybe<br/>
15 secs or less.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Your pet stands on what you are looting because it is so dumb that it<br/>
can not understand simple commands like &quot;guard here&quot;.  It will always<br/>
happen.  On a reality note, your pet will follow invisible &quot;pathing&quot;.<br/>
Experiment with where you stand until you are able to loot with out your pet<br/>
being in the way.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Agnostic is the BEST choice you can make as an enchanter.  Choosing any<br/>
religion will be a hindrance later on.  <br/>
<br/>
7.  Practice &quot;timing&quot; your activities.  Use a second hand to know how long<br/>
your Mez line of spells lasts.  Be aware that every 6 seconds, the checks to<br/>
see if you are meditating or not and adjusts your mana bar appropriately.<br/>
This means that you can be medding during a battle, get up cast a spell, sit<br/>
down and med again, and if you were fast enough, not loose any mana<br/>
regeneration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I have a 5th level High Elf enchanter and have a few questions.  Sorry if<br/>
some sound pretty lame but I&#39;ve haven&#39;t spent much time with an enchanter<br/>
in the group.<br/>
<br/>
1&gt; How do I get into Neriak without a guard playing squish the elf with me? <br/>
2&gt; Can you have an animation and a charmed pet at the same time?.<br/>
3&gt; Do charmed pets follow commands?<br/>

one thing to remember about purchasing spells is there are some which can&#39;t<br/>
be purchased.  In this respect questing for spells is also known as<br/>
research.  Bummer there&#39;s no exp for researching a spell I don&#39;t think<br/>
(haven&#39;t made one yet) but you can make your own spells.<br/>
 <br/>
Enchanters use pages (often there&#39;s a left and right half) and faded pages.<br/>
The faded pages have to be restored before you use them.  Restoring is done<br/>
in one kind of container and combining pages is done in another (both found<br/>
in your guild probably on the tiny dagger merchant).<br/>
 <br/>

By quest spells I mean quests you can do to bypass buying the spells.<br/>
Clerics have a few of these quests and I&#39;m sure other classes do to. It&#39;s<br/>
just a lot easier if you can quest for your spell at the low levels when<br/>
restarting on another server. Thanks for the info though. <br/>

What spell quest have you EVER seen that is easier than purchasing the<br/>

<br/>
1st level spells are expensive without twinking, 8th are expensive, 12th<br/>
mildly expensive.  Aside from those levels, they cost a lot but you should<br/>
be earning a whole lot more than they cost.<br/>
<br/>
However, the time and risk spent on a quest are almost always greater than<br/>

&gt; Enchanters use pages (often there&#39;s a left and right half) and faded<br/>
pages.<br/>
&gt; The faded pages have to be restored before you use them.  Restoring is<br/>
done<br/>
&gt; in one kind of container and combining pages is done in another (both<br/>
found<br/>
&gt; in your guild probably on the tiny dagger merchant).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Um.... I&#39;ve been using a single book, the tomb of endless enchantments I<br/>
believe, to do both my research and my restoration of faded pages.  It never<br/>
fails, except when it doesnt work.<br/>
