<div id="ygrps-yiv-819617051">Try crag spiders in East Karana.  If you buff your pet with Quickness just<br/>
before the fight (along with your other buffs) and lead off with enthrall,<br/>
tashani, languid pace, choke they are pretty easy.  Try to keep it on your<br/>
pet so you don&#39;t get poisoned and if you have the money use rune to help<br/>
your pet.  Worked for me :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, this technique works on the Ogre Raiders on the island in Timorous<br/>
Deep that you get to by taking the barrel barge from Oasis.  There you don&#39;t<br/>
have to worry about poison, too.  Just go between the one at the dock and<br/>
the one standing on the rocks.  Be careful though, as this hurts faction<br/>
with The Overthere.<br/>

Subject: [eqenchanters] 21st lvl<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noted that a few others out there said they got stuck at 16 and<br/>
21st lvl.<br/>
<br/>
I am a High Elf enchanter and i&#39;m stuck at 1bub into 21st lvl. I<br/>
have tried the kunark zones but can&#39;t seem to find a group. I have<br/>
tried to solo but my skill at it sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Please help me.<br/>
I need to know where I should be hunting. I just took the long run<br/>
to Qeynos and that is so I can hunt in SK where everyone has<br/>
told me I should kill Treants or Avaiks. (I don&#39;t really want to kill<br/>
treants, as I like being able to port to Druid rings)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</div>
