<div id="ygrps-yiv-523858850">I hunt in Lake Rathe, hunting Aviak Guards, But i dont use a pet..   What i <br/>
do is Choke them out of the tree.. then root.  then do a Sanity warp or two.  <br/>
sit and med. when he attacks me again, i&#39;ll root back off, choke again and <br/>
med.  he attacks : root,  a sanity warp or two.  <br/>
<br/>
I do this about 4 or 5 times and the bird is dead. and i&#39;ve lost maybe a <br/>
bubble or 2 of health.  But my mana&#39;s all used up.  its a sure way to kill <br/>
without a pet.<br/>
