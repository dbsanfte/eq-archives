<div id="ygrps-yiv-405692628">Um, I think I violated a cardinal rule as I made a general statement<br/>
about this thread that didn&#39;t apply to everyone.  So, I&#39;m sending this<br/>
right after the last one.<br/>
<br/>
All I&#39;m concerned about are the &quot;no you&#39;re wrong&quot; messages not the<br/>
&quot;here&#39;s what I tried and saw&quot; messages.  There has been some good info<br/>
on this thread with people letting us know what they&#39;ve discovered by<br/>
experimentation, etc.  I was mainly referring to the &quot;no you&#39;re wrong<br/>
it&#39;s this way&quot; messages.  Sorry for the generalization.  Hopefully this<br/>
will arrive shortly after the other one!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Shawn<br/>

<br/>
Hi people,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care. At least for now until we know more.  Not meaning to be<br/>
rude as I think we have good information to pass back and forth on other<br/>
topics.  But, this is beginning to remind me of arguments with my wife<br/>
about who would take out the trash or what exactly did I mean when I<br/>
said &lt;blank&gt;. Now, let&#39;s not confuse this with the &quot;your computer means<br/>
more to you than me&quot; fights cause those are in another league and they<br/>
just don&#39;t understand hehe<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is the kind of thread that discourages people from being a<br/>
part of mailing lists.  I said..., no you meant..., no I meant and you<br/>
are saying..., he said that you said..., etc. my ears are ringing<br/>
already<br/>
<br/>

&gt;I love how EVERYONE has opinoins but no one can state a fact<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you have the honesty to say everyone, you certainly arnt<br/>
contributing any.<br/>
<br/>
.....or even<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;calculate anything tangible and informative<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not sure what you mean by this, I&#39;ve heard several people say that<br/>
they&#39;ve<br/>
had significantly fewer resists after making a character with a higher<br/>
chr<br/>
than a prior one with a lower chr.  To me, this is far more &#39;tangible<br/>
and<br/>
informative&#39; than saying that Stratics says something, ergo it must be<br/>
true.<br/>
<br/>
.........ppl just argur for the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;sake of the arguement I think<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of couse, arguing is fun. =)<br/>
<br/>
......oh well....until Stratics proves to be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;wrong or has falsified information I will continue to read their site<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;take it to heart<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Firstly, I never even suggested that Stratics falsified information.<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
talked with eqss people in the chat rooms in beta, and grouped with one<br/>
early in retail.  They&#39;re good, honest people.  However, they are *not*<br/>
perfect.  You want an example of wrong info on the sight?  Okie dokie.<br/>
If<br/>
you look under thier class reference chart, you&#39;ll see that barbarians<br/>
are<br/>
large sized creatures, and it will say that, for example, high elves are<br/>
small/medium.  Now, the thing is, barbarians are capable of wearing<br/>
medium<br/>
armor too.  The simple fact is, Verant has not released a great deal of<br/>
the<br/>
&#39;number crunching&#39; information, so I&#39;m likely to at least pay attention<br/>
to<br/>
someone who comes up with new information rather than dismissing it out<br/>
of<br/>
hand do to its not being known beforehand.  *All* the information that<br/>
is<br/>
once stratics was once this way.<br/>
<br/>
......and by the by.......MANY of the authors of EQ are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;directly involved with GMs and what not....just becuase they arent<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Verant<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;EMPLOYEES dusnt mean they dont have inside information.......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll admit befuddlement as to what you mean when you say &quot;many of the<br/>
authors of EQ are directly involved with EQ...&quot;.  I assume you mean that<br/>
the<br/>
authors of EQSS or perhaps EQVault there rather than EQ.  I&#39;m quite<br/>
certain<br/>
that the authors of EQ are involved with the GMs. ;)  However, neing<br/>
friends<br/>
with the admins of CoN, I can assure you that GMs do *not* give out<br/>
specific<br/>
number crunching values to anyone.  Seriously, how do you mean that they<br/>
are<br/>
involved?<br/>
