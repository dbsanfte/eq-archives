<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095076676">&lt;another rant&gt;<br/>
I have known something was not right and I just figured it out why it was<br/>
bothering me. Our Level 1 DD spell (and every DoT spell) is an Alteration<br/>
spell. Every DD spell afer 1st level except the AE DD spell at 39th level is<br/>
Evocation. Why the change? By this I mean why did it go from an Alteration<br/>
spell at 1st to an Evocation spell up until level 39 where it becomes an<br/>
Alteration spell, and then back to an Evocation spell?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well the reason that the level 1 spell is Alt is that it is not a DD spell<br/>
it is the first of the Dot spells.  Try it on yourself it does the first<br/>
damage then about 20 more after that.  The first Evoc spell / DD spell is<br/>
at level 8.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, why do we skip an upgrade to the 12th level DoT at 20th level? This is<br/>
the only level that this happens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is not the only level that this happens when you hit 29 get use to<br/>
your DOT since it the last one you get till you hit 49.<br/>
