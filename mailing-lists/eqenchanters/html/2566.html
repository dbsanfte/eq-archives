<div id="ygrps-yiv-88951916">I would just like to add that I tried to mes Choon, and he broke it within 3<br/>
seconds, SGs I have been able to mes long enough for me to get ahead to<br/>
zone.<br/>
However, Fire Giants and Ice Giants will break it immediately, it will say<br/>
they have been &quot;entranced&quot; but wont miss a swing. Seafury cyclops also<br/>
cannot be mesd for longer than 1 second. The Giant Wooly Spider in<br/>
Permafrost can be mesd. Youll also find that everything in the planes, save<br/>
for Spite Golems, can be mez, but can be very tricky to get under control.<br/>
