:)Ah, you learn well grasshopper.<br/>
:)<br/>
:)The point was (I have a 18th level enchanter on another server with 90+<br/>
:)skill in jewelcraft), at skill level 20, malachite should not be trivial.<br/>
:)But I got a message saying it was when I made the item.  The very NEXT time<br/>
:)I tried making the malachite I got the skill raise.  I know you learn when<br/>
:)you fail, but you shouldnt learn if it is trivial.<br/>
