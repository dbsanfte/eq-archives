In the old world, Unrest isn&#39;t bad - find a group that&#39;s camping a room<br/>
inside and be prepared for feast or famine pulls.  South Karana is a<br/>
hellhole filled with 12 year olds who forget they&#39;re playing a game for<br/>
fun (but if you spent time in Lake Rathe, you&#39;re probably prepared for<br/>
that).  Rathe Mountains has a few spots that are good if you get a good<br/>
group (but that&#39;s hard to find there) - specifically the giant skelly camp<br/>
just south of the Feerott zone.<br/>
<br/>
Much better than these is Lake of Ill Omen, which has goblins for 20-26 or<br/>
so and then Sarnaks for 24-30.  Also, I&#39;ve had better luck there finding<br/>
groups that know how to (or can be taught to) assist and work together<br/>
than I have in Cazic, S Karana, Unrest, or Mistmoore.<br/>
<br/>
If you get bored there, forest giants in Warsliks are L20-25 or so and can<br/>
be nice for a group around your level.  You&#39;re probably just past the<br/>
perfect range for Kurn&#39;s Tower in Field of Bones, but you may still find<br/>
some decent XP there.<br/>
