<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787524239">When pricing these items, pay less attention to how much it costs to<br/>
make them, and more attention to the following two things. First, it cost us<br/>
a LOT of money to get our skills up to where they are, and we should be able<br/>
to recuperate the training costs in a timely fashion. Second, price the<br/>
items based on what they are worth, NOT what it costs you to make them. When<br/>
you put a price on your silver amber rings (+2 str), just think about how<br/>
much people are paying for flesh bands that offer the same increase, and not<br/>
the fact that it only costs about 3p to make one. If we put too low a price<br/>
on these items, remembering that items do not EVER go away, it won&#39;t be long<br/>
at all before EVERYONE has all they need and we will be left with a<br/>
worthless trade skill. Just my 2 coppers...<br/>

&gt; Mine are close to that, but I was a bit lower on the silver stuff.<br/>
&gt; plus 2 silver, from 4plat to 6plat each<br/>
&gt; Jade rings 10plat<br/>
&gt; electrum jade on my server goes at a steady 20pp. Everyone just sticks<br/>
&gt; with that.<br/>
&gt; Also, WIS earings last night were a big seller. I sold about 20 of them,<br/>
&gt; at aroudn 8 to 10 pp each. They cost about 4 to make I think.<br/>

&gt; We need to start a dialog about what we are going to sell the new<br/>
&gt; jewellery<br/>
&gt; items for. I guess I will open up by stating what I was selling things for<br/>
&gt; last night, and then all of you can comment as to whether it was too high<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; too low, and we will work from there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	All +2 silver stat boosters : 7p each or 2 for 13p<br/>
&gt; 	Jade silver rings : 9p each or 2 for 17p<br/>
&gt; 	Jade electrum bracers : 25p each or 2 for 45p<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This being only the 2nd day after the patch, I haven&#39;t tried marketing<br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; of the electrum items other than the obvious seller, which is the jade<br/>
&gt; bracer. With a skill of 79 I still get failures with electrum, and I am<br/>
&gt; trying to repay the guild for the money they pumped into me to raise my<br/>
&gt; skill. Please add to this list and comment on prices!<br/>
