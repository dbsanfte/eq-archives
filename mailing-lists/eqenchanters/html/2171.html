dont waste practice points on evocation. dump one or two points into it and<br/>
spend a night in a newbie area using the spell. it would be a waste to put<br/>
points into something that is easily raised by going out and casting it.<br/>

&gt;You can dump them all in at once.  I still think its a bad idea though.<br/>

What is there to put the points into if not Evocation? Aside from 20 into<br/>
Jewel Craft as I have already primed it with one point, I will have 10<br/>
Training points to spend at 8th level.<br/>
What do we get that I would need to save the points for? After 8th, by the<br/>
time I hit 16th, I will have 60 more training points. And then until 20th I<br/>
can only spend 1 point in research at 16-19. I think this is correct.<br/>
I could prime my 1H Blunt and 2H Blunt, but I am waiting a bit on those as I<br/>
do not have either of those weapons yet. If I do change from piercing to 1H<br/>
or 2H Blunt by 8th I will still have 8 points to spend. Should I save them?<br/>
<br/>
Bahir as of right now with Skill points (I hope the formatting doesn&#39;t get<br/>
messed up.)<br/>
