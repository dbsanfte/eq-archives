&gt; A fellow guild member also told me to turn in the items to the Freeport<br/>
&gt; Bartender one at a time as giving all 4 at once sometimes doesn&#39;t result in<br/>
&gt; anything. I also was given conflicting advice that if you cast Alliance on<br/>
&gt; him from the &quot;patron&quot; side of the bar that the Ogre will(not) attack you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can anyone confirm/ deny either of these?<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>

alliance, it&#39;s a non-aggro spell anyway.</div>
