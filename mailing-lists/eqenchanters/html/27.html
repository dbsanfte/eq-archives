<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078013533">I ran across something recently.  Not all stones are available<br/>
everywhere.  For example, Jade, used in conjunction with enchanted<br/>
silver to make a +5 mana ring, is not available anywhere near Nerriak<br/>
that I know of.  (I play a dark elf)  So.  I suggest that we compile a<br/>
list of stones and where they can be bought.  I am starting the list<br/>
now, with a list of stones and where they can be bought.  If anyone else<br/>
would like to respond, I will happily add to the list, and publish it<br/>
here about once a week.<br/>
