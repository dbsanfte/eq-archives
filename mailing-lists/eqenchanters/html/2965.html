<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300128351">Quite awhile ago, when I was playing a different enchanter, someone <br/>
explained to me how to use charm when soloing.  I tried using this <br/>
technique (level 15 at the time) and just died a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have a new enchanter who just made level 16 and I&#39;d like to try <br/>
again, but I think I need to understand more details of the <br/>
technique.  As I recall....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Find a mob to charm, with another of similar level not to far away.  <br/>
Stand as far back as you can and cast Tashan.  At this point do I <br/>
back up while waiting for the gems to refresh?  Then cast charm on <br/>
the approaching mob.  Find the other mob, and tell the charmed pet to <br/>
attack it.  Should I cast something on the other mob now, to give my <br/>
pet a little advantage?  Perhaps choke? Sit back and med (but then I <br/>
can&#39;t tell the health of either).  After charmed mob beats up other <br/>
mob, tell it to guard here and back off.  When charm breaks kill it - <br/>
but what should I use to kill it?  What do I do if charm wears off <br/>
early and both mobs come after me.  Recharm?  This is what usually <br/>
resulted in my death before.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All help greatly appreciated.<br/>
