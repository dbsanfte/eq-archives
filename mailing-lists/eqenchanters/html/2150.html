<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790157020">The problem that everyone is having with casting Alliance is related to<br/>
Line-of-Sight.  They added some code a ways back to keep casters from<br/>
abusing <br/>
quick xp gains from monsters inside buildings and on the other side of<br/>
walls.  The counter is in the way and EQ thinks it&#39;s a wall so you won&#39;t be<br/>
able to cast from the <br/>
<br/>
side opposite him unless you stand on the counter or get on the same side as<br/>
him.</div>
