<div id="ygrps-yiv-377918171">In regards to the mist series of spells:<br/>
In one of the recently posted &quot;conversations with GZ&quot; (as I like to call them),<br/>
he seems to equate 6 - 10 points of AC with a &quot;level&quot; of MOB.<br/>
ie.   a 200AC mob is one con level lower than a 190 AC mob.<br/>
This doesn&#39;t seem to jibe with PC AC, does this seem accurate in everyone&#39;s<br/>
experience?<br/>
I have been a firm believer in the &quot;every little bit helps&quot; theory.<br/>
