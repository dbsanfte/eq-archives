<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245333507">seems to be a good time to discuss specialization, now that it is<br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
We can choose one primary specialization.  Which do you guys plan to<br/>
choose?  Alteration seems to be the obvious choice for enchanters, as<br/>
most of our bread and butter spells are of that type.  However, our DD<br/>
spells are evocation and our illusions are divination.  Do any of you<br/>
think that these spells are more important?  Is it possible that an<br/>
enchanter specializing in evocation could go toe to toe with a wizard? <br/>
Or is the spell delay issue still going to be a problem?  Do any of you<br/>
spend your entire existence in an illusion form, such as elemental or<br/>
spirit wolf?<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s all put in our two coppers on specialization, shall we?<br/>
