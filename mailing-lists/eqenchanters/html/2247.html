<div id="ygrps-yiv-543317096">you guys are confusing me hehe.<br/>
i am level 32 now, when i could specialize, i put one point into<br/>
each...alteration, conjeration, etc....<br/>
my skill in each one has been going up, what do you guys mean by<br/>
specializing in just one?<br/>
i am doing all of them....why should i choose one, and stick to only casting<br/>
from that circle of magic?<br/>
in my opinion, put one point in each, then forget about it, let the computer<br/>
take care of it as you cast spells. i know mine is doing great!<br/>

&gt; Good Point.  What you choose for specialization is dependant on your play<br/>
&gt; style. It is RECOMMENDED that enchanters specialize in alteration, but if<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; think another would be more useful, then specialize in that.  A<br/>
&gt; specialize:Conjuration would be useful as well for an enchanter who is<br/>
&gt; strict<br/>
&gt; crowd control and doesn&#39;t buff/debuff as much.  Specialize:Alteration is<br/>
&gt; simply<br/>
&gt; recommended mostly because most of the enchanters spells ARE Alteration.<br/>
