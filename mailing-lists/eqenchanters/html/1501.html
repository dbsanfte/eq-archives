<div id="ygrps-yiv-334580698">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
	This isn&#39;t the first time we talked this through on this group. I would<br/>
like to point out once again that we have many reasons to work on jewellry.<br/>
The main one being money, but it doesnt have to be that. If someone decide<br/>
it&#39;s ok to lose money on gems because it&#39;s part of the process of learning<br/>
the ropes of the trade, who am I to argue?. <br/>
<br/>
	Whatever price you see others /auctionning before ripping their head off<br/>
start asking them first why they chose to do so.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some good points made here but let me add a few of my own...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been practicing my jewel craft all the time since the patch came<br/>
&gt;out.  I agree that people sell to cheaply.  Usually if I see someone<br/>
&gt;selling for cheap I tell them how much I sell for and how much money I<br/>
&gt;have and they thank me and raise their prices.  My price list is as<br/>
&gt;follows:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Vs. jewelry with no AC                2X cost<br/>
&gt;Cat&#39;s eye &quot;Charisma&quot; Necklace           5  pp.<br/>
&gt;Bloodstone &quot;Stamina&quot; Earrings            12 pp. for two<br/>
&gt;Onyx &quot;Dexterity&quot; Bracers                12 pp. for two<br/>
&gt;Jasper &quot;Wisdom&quot; Rings                   12 pp. for two<br/>
&gt;Carnelian &quot;Agility&quot; Rings               12 pp. for two<br/>
&gt;Star Rose Quartz &quot;Intelligence&quot; Rings   12 pp. for two<br/>
&gt;Amber &quot;Strength&quot; Rings                  16 pp. for two<br/>
&gt;Jaded &quot;Mana/hp/ac&quot; Rings                15 pp. apiece<br/>
&gt;Topaz &quot;vs disease/ac&quot; Necklace          12 pp.<br/>
&gt;Opal &quot;Stamina/Agility&quot; Rings            40 pp. apiece<br/>
&gt;Ruby &quot;Strength/Wisdom&quot; Veil             300 pp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These are my prices.  I have made over 700 pp. since the patch and am<br/>
&gt;still going strong.  I have put about 300 pp. back into jewel crafting<br/>
&gt;though.  100 pp. has bought me some good equipment and the remianing 300<br/>
&gt;pp. is still in my bank account.  People will pay these prices, I have<br/>
&gt;sold many of all listed above except Topaz Opal and Ruby.  While trying<br/>
&gt;to sell the Ruby veil many people have told me that it usually goes for<br/>
&gt;250 pp.  Anyone here sell it for that much? And, how do you do it?  Let&#39;s<br/>
&gt;take the price of Ruby. With all my charisma equipment on i have 113<br/>
&gt;charisma and can buy Ruby for 130 pp.  We all know it is easy to fail on<br/>
&gt;something that is trivial to us so let&#39;s say i have a customer who wants<br/>
&gt;a Ruby veil.  So I go buy a Ruby for 130 pp. and I fail. Now I am<br/>
&gt;screwed.  IF I get lucky (or don&#39;t get unlucky) and make it the next<br/>
&gt;time, I still lose 10 pp.  Why would anyone risk doing this?????<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Back to my prices.  Here&#39;s the thing, I will accept almost any amount<br/>
&gt;down to 2x cost, but i don&#39;t tell the customer that.  It&#39;s all a part of<br/>
&gt;being a good salesman.  If they won&#39;t pay or don&#39;t have the money to<br/>
&gt;afford stuff at my prices I haggle with them. THAT IS how you make money.<br/>
&gt;And it makes them feel special for you having taken money off the price<br/>
&gt;for you.  Not once has someone said to me &quot;Oh, you can sell it for<br/>
&gt;cheaper? So you were trying to rip me off or something?&quot; They just don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;care. They want the item and will pay whatever you ask to get it.  Just<br/>
&gt;my advice, hope you all are rich someday.<br/>
