<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I&#39;m staked out in unrest myself, just made lvl 25 
there. I found if you are in skel form and invis undead only werebats will go 
after you. I have not died there since I started doing that, in fact I walk all 
over the house unscathed ,except the basement =p.. I&#39;ve been to ct and guk but 
it&#39;s almost impossible to get a group in those areas, may just be a bertoxx 
thing... Anyway if you got the patience to learn the in and out of unrest you 
can lvl fast and rule the area, people will beg you to join their groups. I 
actually get swamped with tells when I log on and zone into unrest =).. Do what 
you think is best for you though, and have fun =)...</font></div>

  guys!<br><br>I&#39;m real close to lvl 24 now and I&#39;m wondering where I should be 
  fighting.<br>I&#39;m loving permafrost, but I want to move on soon.&nbsp; (Don&#39;t 
  even say<br>Highkeep, I hate that place.. :) ).&nbsp; I checked out Sol A, but 
  there<br>weren&#39;t enough people there at the time that could group with me 
  (mostly<br>lvl 35 and up).&nbsp; the mobs there looked great, and I found a 
  couple nice<br>places to set up camp, but it might be tough to get a group 
  going in that<br>situation.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?&nbsp; I&#39;m really 
  loving the dungeon scene.<br>big pulls, mez, and tons of exp and good 
  loot.&nbsp; Anybody have any favorite<br>dungeons that would be good for my 
  level? :)<br><br>Thanks!<br>Ezrae Dreamstealer<br>Lvl 23 DE
