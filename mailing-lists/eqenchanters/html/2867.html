<div id="ygrps-yiv-372584451">Mez does have a mind wipe effect, yes.  Usually, if you cast it on a<br/>
creature, then don&#39;t do anything (like debuff) it will forget about you<br/>
(unless you&#39;re still in it&#39;s aggro range).  Every now and then it doesn&#39;t<br/>
work, plus it&#39;s more resistable then Mind Wipe, but it&#39;s usually pretty<br/>
reliable.<br/>

Does Mesmerize (single target level 4 spell) have a mind wipe effect to it?<br/>
Last night I was at the GFay 3 spawn bandit camp and with a bad pull, I had<br/>
2 on me. Bandit #2 spawned as the #1 was running at me. =(  I killed #1<br/>
which leveled me to 8th (yay!) and had 1 bubble of health, and my pet was<br/>
dead. I turned off my attack and tried to mes. I forgot to Tashan, so by the<br/>
time it stuck, I had a sliver of life left. I backed up the hill (30 to 40<br/>
feet) and sat down to med and get enough mana for a fear and also to heal up<br/>
as I didn&#39;t have bandages either. When my &quot;Your Mesmerize spell has worn<br/>
off.&quot; message came up I didn&#39;t move trying to get one last tick of health /<br/>
mana, and waiting to get whacked to auto stand up. It never happened.<br/>
<br/>
Did I just back up to far for the agro to kick in? Or did the Mesmerize wipe<br/>
me from the hate list as I hadn&#39;t actually hit the bandit in melee?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, btw I have looted 3 vials of elven blood from the bandits that have<br/>
woodelf graphic models. This is for the new armor, but I can&#39;t remember<br/>
which ones.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your replies in advance.<br/>
