&gt; Indeed it does. Forget which one exactally, but you can find him fishing<br/>
on the shores of the lake if you are lucky enough to be online when the<br/>
typical &quot;T-Port in 1 minute before spawn time. Blast the NPC to bits for the<br/>
Rare loot with one cast. Gate out. Auction Rare Item.&quot; type person isn&#39;t<br/>
online, as is all too common for this Unique Item on many servers. (I&#39;ve<br/>
heard of one guy that has it timed to 15 seconds, and never misses the kill<br/>
when he&#39;s on.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You should also know that it will ruin your faction with the Qeynos Guard,<br/>
and that if he runs anywhere near the guards at Surefall they will come to<br/>
his aid, not yours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That said, good luck taking out this 35th or so level gent and hope you<br/>
never have to travel near any city or guard tower associated with Qeynos<br/>
again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I believe its on one of the fisherman in the qeynos hills<br/>

&gt; &gt;I know Fishbone earrings come from a high level NPC, but does anyone know<br/>
who/where/loc/level needed? Does &quot;it&quot; wander around a zone? I know I am no<br/>
where near getting these, but I have a goal to get these for myself and my<br/>
wife.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Thanks in advance.<br/>
