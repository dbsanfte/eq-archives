The deal quite frankly is thsi. I can&#39;t play with my friends because theya<br/>
re all outleveling me. When theya re online I play with them even though<br/>
theya re 3-4 levles ahead of me and even though sometimes I am zero use to<br/>
them because none of my spells stick. When they are offline I cannot findany<br/>
groups to play so I am stuck attempting to solo which is incredibly slow and<br/>
dangerous too.  This is the Second Wave of friends that has out leveled me. <br/>

&gt;I had a level 16 dark elf necro that I started on the first day of the<br/>
&gt;release. It took me 4 &#39;played&#39; days and a half to get it to level 16. then I<br/>
&gt;gave it up. I have now a level 16 enchanter. It took me 12 &#39;played&#39; days to<br/>
&gt;make it to 16... You think that&#39;s a problem for me? I had so much more fun<br/>
&gt;playing an enchanter. What&#39;s the deal with this level race? Sometimes I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;spend an hour travelling back and forth just to say hi to a friend I havent<br/>
&gt;seen for a long time. Right now, I&#39;m hunting in CrushBone and I barely make<br/>
&gt;any xp where I could be soloing in Lavastorm and make a shit load of xp and<br/>
&gt;money..but what&#39;s the big deal? I enjoy playing Everquest a lot more now.<br/>
&gt;Powergaming is so boring. So are those people who start a race everytime  a<br/>
&gt;new server comes up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;my 2 cents,<br/>
