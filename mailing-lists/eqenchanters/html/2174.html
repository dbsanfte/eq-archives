<b>Subject:</b> Jewel Craft Prices <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069781590">Ok, I know this is a sensitive subject and ultimately subject to what server<br/>
you are on and the prices accepted by the general public on that server.<br/>
However, so as to not undersell my product to the populace of Norrath, can<br/>
anyone give me a general guide for items made and lowest price you would<br/>
sell them for? I realize Silver may not sell for much on the established<br/>
servers and on PVP+ they would rather kill you for your wears, as if you<br/>
would sell them anyway. I am merely looking for a &quot;suggested retail price&quot;.<br/>
Also what zones result in the best prices?<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that I saw was that Jewel Craft caps at 200 with Gold being<br/>
Trivial then. Is this true? I thought there was no cap on trade skills.<br/>
