<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761123163">Tinik Gutenungrie<br/>
<br/>
Tinik I got from basically hitting random keys on my keyboard until I got<br/>
something, then just twisted and warped it until I got something that<br/>
sounded decent :)<br/>
<br/>
Guntenungrie I picked because at the time I was working heavily on my baking<br/>
skill, plus it sounded gnomish.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I asked myself a question last night that I hope all of you will reply to<br/>
&gt; when I ask it of you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why did you choose the name of your character? What does it mean to you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, so that is 2 questions, shoot me. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This thought entered my mind as I sat last night trying to come up with a<br/>
&gt; name for my gnome enchanter. I do not like the name generator that Verant<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, what follows is a breakdown of why I chose the names I did. I am<br/>
&gt; intrigued to see the results if all of you did the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personal history: I have been playing RPs since 73, and picked up<br/>

&gt; Uktena-<br/>
&gt; American Indian tribe, and a tribe of Werewolves from WhiteWolf&#39;s<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Uthanatos, Gnome Enchanter:<br/>
&gt; No last name yet, but I will have a while before I need to worry about it.<br/>
&gt; ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;From WhiteWolf&#39;s &quot;Mage: the Ascension&quot;, Euthantos.  A Tradition of mages<br/>

 </span></blockquote>them.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Also called Death Mages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This may apply to Necromancers, but to me the Enchanter class is the true<br/>
&gt; embodiment of the Euthanatos. They can ultimately control the outcome of<br/>
&gt; almost any battle so that the &quot;Life&quot; of the party is preserved (by being<br/>
&gt; competent) or they can hasten the grip of Death upon his fellows (by being<br/>
&gt; inept).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, there you have it. One step closer into the mind of Me. Reply if you<br/>
&gt; wish, I for one would enjoy reading it.<br/>
