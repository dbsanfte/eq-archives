<div id="ygrps-yiv-816427274">I&#39;m sorry but i totally disagree with you.<br/>
Enchanters are almost useless Jeweling is THEIR skill<br/>
sure others can do jewelry and i knowlots of people<br/>
do. All they do is get an enchanter to cast spells for<br/>
em. I don&#39;t think any other classes should &quot;Enchant&quot;<br/>
cause &quot;Enchanting&quot; is for &quot;Enchanters&quot; get my point? <br/>
Anyway I think you are way off on this and it&#39;s a<br/>
horrible idea cause than i would have too much<br/>
competition and the people wouldn&#39;t buy fromme if they<br/>
could make it. Instead i think enchanters could get a<br/>
few more spells that would give charges on certiant<br/>
things... and it didn&#39;t have to have bars it could<br/>
merely be cast on an certiant item that can use<br/>
diffrent types of charges and can be filled with<br/>
diffrent types of charges &lt;get me?&gt; like a baulb I put<br/>
buncha charges in it, and use em all than put more.<br/>
Course it should take a lot of mana and maybe a<br/>
certiant item &lt;cheap perhaps? cause charges suck&gt;.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recently posted a reply to an earlier idea of<br/>
&gt; being able to enchant spells into jewelry.  Most<br/>
&gt; people liked it, and there were a few problems. <br/>
&gt; Even some of my friends flamed me in person, saying<br/>
&gt; it would be way too powerful.  I would like to amend<br/>
&gt; my idea a little.  Who knows, maybe someone at<br/>
&gt; verrant will see it and like it, or even laugh at<br/>
&gt; it.  Either would at least show they are interested<br/>
&gt; in our input.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First problem was with non-enchanters not being able<br/>
&gt; to make such items.  Non-enchanters are severly<br/>
&gt; crippled when it comes to jewelry anyway.  The<br/>
&gt; solution is the same.  Get an enchanter to enchant<br/>
&gt; the metal. And who says you would have to be able to<br/>
&gt; cast the spell involved in enchanting it into<br/>
&gt; jewelry?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next problem is having too powerful items too<br/>
&gt; soon in the game.  If some 8th level enchanter could<br/>
&gt; make a Rune ring just because he had people giving<br/>
&gt; him money to get a high jewelry skill, that could be<br/>
&gt; a problem.  A high level friend or guild giving you<br/>
&gt; hundreds of plat to get skill up is wrong.  An easy<br/>
&gt; solution would be to make spells require a higher<br/>
&gt; level of metal than the related enchant metal spell.<br/>
&gt;  For example:  An eight or ninth level spell could<br/>
&gt; only be enchanted into electrum or higher, because<br/>
&gt; enchant silver is an eigth level spell.  So in order<br/>
&gt; to put a Rune spell into a ring (level 16) you would<br/>
&gt; need to use gold.  This would require a 24th level<br/>
&gt; caster.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This could also affect how many charges an item had.<br/>
&gt;  An item with the lowest possible type of metal<br/>
&gt; would have only one charge.  If an higher type metal<br/>
&gt; was used, it could have more charges depending upon<br/>
&gt; the level of metal involved.  This would limit high<br/>
&gt; level spells requiring platinum to only one charge. <br/>
&gt; Once again, items could either be made rechargable,<br/>
&gt; or could be made to dissapear after last charge is<br/>
&gt; used, which would lower the amount of magic items in<br/>
&gt; the world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or, to spread jewelry out amoungst the classes, dont<br/>
&gt; require an enchant metal spell, merely require the<br/>
&gt; jeweler be able to cast the spell.  That way only<br/>
&gt; clerics could put clerical spells in jewelry.  Makes<br/>
&gt; much more sense.  Perhaps the enchant metal spells<br/>
&gt; could add bonuses an item might not have without. <br/>
&gt; Maybe even bards could be jewelers, effectively<br/>
&gt; using bard songs instead of spells.  This would<br/>
&gt; exclude non-casting classes, but you cant have<br/>
&gt; everything.  If being a jeweler was the most<br/>
&gt; important thing to you, it would be more important<br/>
&gt; than being a warrior, and you should choose you<br/>
&gt; class accordingly.  However, to most people, trade<br/>
&gt; skills are secondary, and class is primary.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This may be way too powerful.  I dont mean to make<br/>
&gt; enchanters a super-class.  I dont claim to know more<br/>
&gt; than anyone else.  Less actually.  I only play a<br/>
&gt; level 14 enchanter.  And, I think he is plenty<br/>
&gt; powerful.  If anyone needs help, let it be the<br/>
&gt; warriors, they need it.  I&#39;m just trying to help the<br/>
&gt; trade skill.  Maybe the enchanters board is the<br/>
&gt; wrong place for this post, but until now, Jewelry<br/>
&gt; seems to have been our baby.  Anyway, feel free (as<br/>
&gt; always) to agree, disagree, help, or flame away.  I<br/>
&gt; am happy for any suggestions.<br/>
