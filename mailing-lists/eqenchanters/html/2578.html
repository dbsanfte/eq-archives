<div id="ygrps-yiv-725870991">Actually the easiest way to get there is the following:<br/>
<br/>
Cross the &quot;C&quot; plank at the entrance of Guk from the swamp.  Make a left and<br/>
go until you cant go forward anymore.  Follow the room to the right- on the<br/>
far side of the room you will see a hall going off to your right.  Facing<br/>
forward at the start of this hallway you see a door to your left (this is<br/>
where the froglok Squire spawns)- go through that door and into the room on<br/>
your left.  You are now in the &quot;Plank Room&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Cross the plank room and you will see a room with a whole in the floor<br/>
(ladder going down to the floor below).  Jump down this hole and face the<br/>
only exit from the room below.  You can get to the first entrance to Lower<br/>
guk by makeing a right, however, the Froklog priest is just down the hall<br/>
to your left.<br/>
<br/>
The hallyway will turn right then left again then pass through a small room<br/>
with one foggie in it (no other exits from this room).  Next will be a room<br/>
with a number of exits and 3 or 4 frogs.  Hang a right in this room and<br/>
head dow nthe hall.  It  will curve around in a &quot;U&quot; shape (kinda) then make<br/>
an abrupt left.  The room in front of you now has a pit with 4 spawns, and<br/>
alclove on either side of the pit with a frog in each, and the hall<br/>
continuing on the far side- welcome to the Froglok Priest Room.<br/>
