 </span></blockquote>Mez (and WTYH for that matter) has a 2.5 second cast time.  If you cast<br/>
immediately after seeing the &quot;hits YOU&quot; message, you should be able to get<br/>
it off at least half the time.  If there&#39;s only one.<br/>

Better yet, if you have a wizzie or cleric (or 30+ Paladin) in your group,<br/>
warn them in advance that this will happen and they should keep a stunning<br/>
spell memmed.  In combat, just /g &quot;please stun this unpleasant green<br/>
thing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Root is another very good option, either from another caster that can&#39;t<br/>
stun, or cast it yourself, as it casts in 2.0 seconds rather than 2.5.<br/>
Once rooted, step back and mez away (or step back and leave it rooted, for<br/>
that matter). <br/>
<br/>
In fact, in the hands of a competent group without an enchanter, root is<br/>
actually an effective small-crowd control method.  It doesn&#39;t touch what<br/>
an enchanter can do, but with just a very small amount of maneuvering room<br/>
it can take 2-3 MoBs out of the combat.<br/>
