<div id="ygrps-yiv-431412734">I made the trip and had no problems, just lucky I guess.<br/>
I also gated back the moment I bought it, call me chicken but the thought of<br/>
walking back to get my corpse was to much.<br/>

Try,try again..<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m sorry if this message sounds bad, but i love the game, just a little<br/>
 </span></blockquote>upset right now.  I finally made 8th level, and so off I go to get my pet<br/>
spell.  I had read many reports on this list, so I thought myself prepared.<br/>
After about an hour and a half trip from Felwithe, I finally reach High Hold<br/>
Pass.  My invisibility still going strong, I procede in a short distance<br/>
only to be rooted and killed by some #@!!@#$ orc who could see invisible.  I<br/>
came from Kithicor forest.  Was I just unlucky?  Is there another better way<br/>
in, other than through kithicor?  That place is insane.  How do they expect<br/>
us to ever get a pet at this level?  I&#39;ve been hearing Mages whine about<br/>
have to research 24th level pets.  How about getting screwed out of 8th<br/>
level.  If my bitching is unfounded, please tell me.  I will appologize.  If<br/>
there is an easier way, or I just got unlucky, let me know.  Please.<br/>
