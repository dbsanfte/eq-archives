<br/>
When soloing always use an animation (later on you can use charm instead)...<br/>
they are your main damage dealer.  They can&#39;t take much damage so you need<br/>
to watch them closely.  One of the best things about being an Enchanter is<br/>
that you have many options.  This is one such option at level 4:<br/>
<br/>
Start with Tashan from a distance and follow ASAP with Suffocating Sphere<br/>
before the critter reaches you (you can usually get both spells off if you<br/>
are far enough away).    The critter should be on you and your animation on<br/>
the critter, so back off a bit and let your pet tank.  Next debuf the<br/>
critter futher with Enfeeblement (this strength debuf along with the DOT<br/>
strength debuf will lower the average total damage the critter will do).<br/>
Now just wait (med if you want to) and watch your animation&#39;s health... tank<br/>
for it when needed.  When the critter is  almost dead cast your DOT again to<br/>
finish it off (or if your Evocation is high enough use your DD).  I&#39;m making<br/>
the assumtion you&#39;ve already buffed yourself and your Animation before this.<br/>
<br/>
Another option in a safe area is to follow the same line except cast fear<br/>
when you&#39;re done debuffing... the pet will follow and hit the critter while<br/>
it&#39;s running away.  Rinse and repeat until dead.<br/>
