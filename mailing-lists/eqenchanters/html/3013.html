 </span></blockquote>I found that Zazlan and Shezlie Furscale really don&#39;t like me.  I came <br/>
from the Lake of Ill Omen, swam my way to W. Cabilis, and climbed onto <br/>
land at the right side docks while heading to the Field of Bone.  I <br/>
stuck to the right, trying to avoid as many buildings as possible.  <br/>
While running (with SoW) I saw 2 Iksars running.  I first thought that <br/>
is was 2 PCs and ingnored them, till they started beating on me.  I <br/>
made it to the zone, but died on the other side from some disease.  On <br/>
my CR, I used illusion and invis and made it safely.  I looted my <br/>
corpse then started to head out.  Oh, there&#39;s the bone chip quest <br/>
trooper, I&#39;ll just hand over a few chips, afterall he views me kindly <br/>
and the crusaders at the lake were indifferent.  Here trooper, take <br/>
this chip. Hey why is this Crusader pet beating on me?  Abort giving <br/>
of the chips, time to run - oops too late. :(  Guess the Crusaders at <br/>
the Field of Bone still hate me.  Interesting how their faction is <br/>
different.<br/>
