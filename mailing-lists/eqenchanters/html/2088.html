<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218015528">That would be nice, but its not the case. At NO POINT does ANY platinum<br/>
jewlery become trivial. My skill is 190 at the moment. At 191 gold and Opal<br/>
will become trivial, and that is that. No other metal - gem combination<br/>
will be trivial after gold and Opal (Maybe gold and Ruby becomes trivial at<br/>
some point between 192 and 200, but I seriously doubt it). So get ready to<br/>
fail alot when you hit 191 and level 34. Platinum jewelry is a pain in the<br/>
ass, and it sure hurts the pocketbook when you fail...<br/>
