<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056832477">First of all thanks for the replies on Rune I.<br/>
<br/>
I still have a question on research though.<br/>
<br/>
I was on baelish&#39;s EQ Enchanter site looking at the research section, it says That for level 16 spells I need page 23 for levitate 24 for disempower and 26 for Mesmerization. <br/>
<br/>
 My problem is that I have had all these pages, put them in the book(one at a time) and hit combine. I get the message those items in that combination failed to produce anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was then told I have to have the left and right pages, but under the page description It says just page 23 or page 24 of Tasarins Grimoire.<br/>
<br/>
What am I doing wrong?<br/>
I also was not allowed to put any practices into Research.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long winded questions but I am a bit confused about research.<br/>
