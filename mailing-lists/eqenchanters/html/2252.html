There is a way of resetting them. I do not remember exactly how. But it is<br/>
something with a tiny NPC in Cazic Thule I think. And it costs something<br/>
like an expensive gem. I have heard it truncates them all to 49. Not sure of<br/>
the details. Should be pretty common knowledge though.<br/>

(This has been a big discussion amongst Magicians. Turned out to be<br/>
Evocation up to lvl 45 then Conjuration.)<br/>

Renden, Enchanter (on Tunare)<br/>
Also Zaltil, Magician (on Innoruuk)</div>
