&gt; So far I&#39;ve only used it on the Fire Elementals in Lavastorm, I haven&#39;t done a<br/>
&gt; lot of experementation with it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m working on getting more CHR items as well, being DE I didn&#39;t get a very high<br/>
&gt; base CHR.  I think without the gear I have so far my CHR is only 80. :(  the CHR<br/>
&gt; buff I get later will help that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another CHR question.  I was lucky enough to find a crude stein for sale on a<br/>
&gt; merchant in Feerot, only cost me 7pp and some change.  It&#39;s not for sale there<br/>
&gt; anymore.  I&#39;ve heard the only way you&#39;re supposed to be able to get one is<br/>
&gt; through a quest.  Does anyone know what quest gives the crude stein?  I see<br/>
&gt; people auctioning them occasionally for 30 to 70pp.  I could use the money, so I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t mind running the quest to get another one.  (too bad they&#39;re lore and<br/>
&gt; can only be held in the secondary hand.  There&#39;s been times that carrying 2 of<br/>
&gt; them would have come in very handy.)<br/>

Crude Stiens are plain old loot items from Ogre Bouncers.  You can usually obtain<br/>
one by heading down there and looking for high level players who kite the guards.<br/>
Since they are lore, you can probably get one for free.</div>
