<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031121034">Invis is variable, but as your skill increases it becomes more reliable. I<br/>
often have it last for 30 mins or more at level 14. If it is going to wear<br/>
off soon, it usually does so within the first minute or so. I usually just<br/>
cast it and wait for a min or so and if it holds, then it will almost always<br/>
hold for at least 15 mins.<br/>

&gt; I gave up a level 16 dark-elf necro because their invisibility spell (<br/>
&gt; gather shadows ) was very unreliable. One sad evening, coming back from a<br/>
&gt; very long quest that brought me to Kerra Island and South Karana, I got<br/>
&gt; hacked multiple times in Riverdale losing about 4 bubs of xp because my<br/>
&gt; invis wore off on me randomly. I got really pissed off that at level 16, I<br/>
&gt; could not manage to cast a level 8 spell reliably and decided to start<br/>
&gt; another character more appropriate for travelling since I was<br/>
&gt; very much into<br/>
&gt; research and quests.<br/>
&gt; With my enchantress, I got invisibility at level 4 and used it some times.<br/>
&gt; It always seemed to work great but I might be wrong. Yesterday, I<br/>
&gt; found out<br/>
&gt; that this invisibility spell is as bad as gather shadows as a %$#%^^%$<br/>
&gt; griffin nuked me a few seconds after I cast invisibility. Since then, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; noticed the same kind on unreliability...but only since I made level 8...I<br/>
&gt; might be wrong.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I would like to know how&#39;s the enchanter&#39;s invisibility like at<br/>
&gt; level 16 or 20 or more. CAN YOU COUNT ON IT?<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
