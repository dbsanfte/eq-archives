<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905336068">I agree in theory to a nuke at the end being innocuous.  But for full <br/>
crowd control you must be scared and ready, and to mem that DD takes <br/>
away from the crowd control.  Take a typical mem block<br/>
<br/>
gate, theft of thought, fasination, dazzle, color stun, charm, tash, <br/>
root.<br/>
<br/>
Other often swapted out spells would be boon of clear mind, auggie, <br/>
slow.<br/>
<br/>
I try not to have buff memed for any longer than I need it.  I often <br/>
select the gem to mem it in based on the immediate risk in the battle.<br/>
<br/>
For example,  I never un mem dazzle or ae mez.  But I might un mem <br/>
charm or gate for buffs if it seems relatively safe at the moment.  <br/>
If it is very unsafe i will unmem root perhaps if others have it.  I <br/>
will explain to group I am unmemming root.  I see root as an <br/>
important crowd control spell.<br/>
<br/>
My whole job, as I am beginning to see it, is Crowd Control.  If the <br/>
others don&#39;t have the damaging protential needed to do the job then I <br/>
need a new group.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, to load a evoc DD embraces an impatience I just dont think <br/>
I can afford.<br/>
<br/>
Longer battles are the norm.  FM or higher mana than normal is the <br/>
norm.<br/>
<br/>
But when stuff goes bad.  Micro, Mini, or massive mistake or train.  <br/>
I end up using tons of mana fast.  The benefit is no evac, or cr.  <br/>
Those are my goals.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a whole new type of thinking to extremes needed for <br/>
effective CC in places that are ultra filled with 45 plus baddies.<br/>
<br/>
Much the same as our conversion at 35, I think at 51 and up there is <br/>
a new .. come to jesus .. LOL sorta speak... in terms of our <br/>
priorities.<br/>
<br/>
I too have memd other spells for fun in battles.  I almost always <br/>
regret it.  Stuff just goes wrong often in pulls.  It is the norm.  <br/>
When I say norm I mean it will happen every hour or so that if not on <br/>
your toes the team will have someone die or need to evac or some <br/>
other bad time consuming thing.<br/>
