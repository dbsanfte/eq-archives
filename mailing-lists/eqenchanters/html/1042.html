<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378411803">well I heard that wisdom helps a lot with failures both in jewelry and<br/>
spells. For my character, I maxed out intelligence to 142 and I&#39;ve put the<br/>
remaining 5 in charisma. If I need more charisma later, there are spells for<br/>
it. I can also make rings for only when I sell or buy. If I was to redo my<br/>
character, I would probably put some points in wisdom instead of charisma.<br/>
Stamina is kind of useless. You get more hp which can help a bit at low<br/>
level, but you really dont care about it at high levels. If everything goes<br/>
well, you wont get hit in a fight or just a bit. If it turns wrong, your<br/>
extra points from charisma wont save you, but extra mana given by<br/>
intelligence will. In the long run, high charisma is not an issue. You get<br/>
spells at level 20 that give you a high enough charisma ( at least I would<br/>
guess, I&#39;m just at 18 ).<br/>
Now choosing Quellious instead of Agnostic was a bad idea. Although I didnt<br/>
know about it, so I guess I&#39;m lucky I didnt pick it up. I had a high level<br/>
dark-elf necro before and I was tired to get KOS all the time, so when I had<br/>
the opportunity to pick agnostic, I jumped on it.<br/>
restarting your char? level 9 is still pretty low. You can make it back in a<br/>
week or a week and a half. Higher levels take time. If you want to restart<br/>
it, restart it now! Level 12 is the level at which enchanters really start<br/>
to shine ( just a bit ). As long as you&#39;re under that, it&#39;s ok. Level 11 was<br/>
a nightmare for me, but since I passed 12, I&#39;ve been flying through levels.<br/>
my 2 cents,<br/>

I originally put a bunch of my skill points in wisdom (17) - don&#39;t ask me<br/>
why, I can&#39;t think of a good reason.  Plus<br/>
I chose Quellious instead of agnostic.  I didn&#39;t know about that one.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m level 9 now and it took a while and a bunch of effort to get there and<br/>
I&#39;m finally realizing my mistake.  I&#39;m sure if I had to do it again I could<br/>
do it quicker though.<br/>
<br/>
First question: Would it be possible to have two characters on the same<br/>
account with the same name or would you have to delete one first?<br/>
<br/>
Second question: Does not having a really high chr hurt your character alot<br/>
in the long run?  If I would do it again, I would put starting points into<br/>
int, chr and sta.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad you can&#39;t transfer spell books :(<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering what the recommendation is.  I plan on having a full and<br/>
fruitful life for my enchanter and wondering if starting over now while I&#39;m<br/>
only lv9 is better than going on to much greater levels with a &#39;screwed up<br/>
character&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance to all the wise enchanters out there.<br/>
