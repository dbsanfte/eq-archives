<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870284504">You guys are just calling it lazy but are missing the overall picture.<br/>
It takes time to make a change and often one bit of code is entwined with <br/>
another so then you should debug and test it.  Also depending on how they <br/>
coded it this could be a very major change to make.  If they left it in <br/>
then in the meantime they are granting an exploit.  The big picture is <br/>
this.  Who do they take care of first&gt;  The enchanters by leaving it as is <br/>
until they can fix it or the rest of the player base by taking it out now? <br/>
 The majority rules so taking it out is the best move for the greatest <br/>
good. Don&#39;t call it lazy programming to get these spells off the PVP <br/>
process, call it a regrettable need to serve the greatest good.  Oh and <br/>
don&#39;t go calling this just an enchanter nerf either.  That also shows <br/>
narrow focus instead of a view of the whole picture, were not the only <br/>
ones with these spells.<br/>
And to say losing them reduces us to just poor nukers is really so much <br/>
Hyperbolae.  I doubt anyone  on this list believes that.<br/>
<br/>
I applaud and accept the change.<br/>
Now if they don&#39;t fix it you can call that lazy programming if you want <br/>
but remember that working on this would cut back on programming resources <br/>
elsewhere.  Our enchantments for  example.....<br/>
Programming resources are finite and have to be rationed somewhere.  I <br/>
don&#39;t hear any qualified programmer&#39;s volunteering to pitch in for free on <br/>
this list.  Until you do watch the rock throwing.<br/>

Yup, Dispell only works on another player if they are grouped with you <br/>
now.<br/>
Again a lazy change for this is great on all levels cept +PvP server where<br/>
someone wants to fight. Heck our lvl 50 Cleric took on 2 lvl 50 necros,<br/>
killed one and sent the other running with  bub of health left thanks to<br/>
this change. LOL again, way to be the lazy dog Veriant.<br/>
