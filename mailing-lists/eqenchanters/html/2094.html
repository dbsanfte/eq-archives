<div id="ygrps-yiv-614020342">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the list and have Jeweling questions for you.<br/>
My questions involves training points.<br/>
After you spend the max 21 points at the guild and you get to your next<br/>
level can you put those 5 into your Jewel Craft skill? Can you do this at<br/>
each level?<br/>
I realize you may not want to do this or advise it, but is it possible?<br/>
<br/>
What reasons would you give for NOT putting your training points into Jewel<br/>
Craft at each level, even if you only put in 1 or 2.<br/>
<br/>
Also, after you reach 16th, how hard is it to do research and advance it?<br/>
Should I save points for Specialization?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
