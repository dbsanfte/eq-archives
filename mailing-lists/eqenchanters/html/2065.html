<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742662064">hehe, it&#39;s kind of funny.  I put one character away and dust off another one<br/>
when some neat new things get added.  I hadn&#39;t played my enchanter since way<br/>
before they made some improvements so am loving it from when I played her in<br/>
March.  Haven&#39;t played my necro since about July so I&#39;m kind of out of touch<br/>
with the big changes that have been happening and the taking away of spells<br/>
etc.  I was just plunking away with my warrior for the last couple months<br/>
till I made 20.  Now I&#39;m back with my enchanter and it&#39;s great fun.  I<br/>
realized I hadn&#39;t bought about half my spells so that helped and for some<br/>
reason I had never gottem my level 8 pet spell so THAT&#39;s why my pet always<br/>
conned green to me at level 8  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow I solo&#39;d a few yellow spiders and wasps in misty thicket last night<br/>
and had great fun.  I do have a hard time remembering I don&#39;t have 700hp<br/>
anymore and that I can&#39;t ignore the cries of my character as she gets<br/>
clobbered as long a time as I could get away with it with my warrior.  I<br/>
successfully used sooth to pull 1 goblin at a time out of the camp.  That is<br/>
so cool, I remember how much trouble it was pulling the entire orc camp with<br/>
my warrior.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, sorry to hear we lost some stuff but I&#39;m havin fun.  And if they<br/>
screw up the class enough temporarilly I&#39;ll have to switch back to one of my<br/>
other characters until it gets fixed again.  But in the meantime I&#39;m not<br/>
noticing any big problems yet and I&#39;m making headway with my enchantress.<br/>

I must appologize for my apparent flame.  I know the charm spell for necros<br/>
was crap anyway.  I guess I&#39;m just jealous that my enchanter is wanted so<br/>
much for in a group then my necro is.  But it is alot easier to kite with my<br/>
enchanter then my necro now.  Just charm one mob and set it against another.<br/>
When the one thats being teamed up is dead and your pet is almost dead then<br/>
its very easy to kill it and get exp for both.  And I was hunting in Unrest<br/>
the other night and my life suck wouldnt work on a werebat but the enchanter<br/>
in our group (same lvl as me)had no problem casting on it.<br/>
<br/>
I appologize to the list.<br/>

did you ever try to use it? it was the level 12 enchanter charm spell that<br/>
necros got at 24. that spell couldnt be used to charm any MOB over level<br/>
25. if you cast the spell on a mob over 25, you got a message saying you<br/>
cant do it with this spell. by the time you got the spell at 24, it&#39;s<br/>
useless considering the other spells you got.<br/>
<br/>
and i get sick of necros complaining about how they get resisted just like<br/>
everyone else now. life tap gets resisted now. good. necros were too<br/>
powerful with life tap almost always sticking and being able to kite. now<br/>
they get resisted just like wizzies and mages. i&#39;ve played all 4, and even<br/>
NOW my enchanter STILL gets resisted more.<br/>
