&gt;I had a lot of trouble too.  Blue things were resisting and EVERYTHING<br/>
&gt;seemed to be coming after me.  In a group of 5 players I was the sole<br/>
&gt;target of interest.  Two big ugly deaths after the patch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t really notice an increase in resists, cause I get resisted alot<br/>
anyway, but I did die two times :(<br/>
The second time was the worst.  There was a ton of people around and like 5<br/>
things randomly decided to train on me.<br/>
But the thing is that stuff ramdonly trains on me all the time, so for me<br/>
it was business as usual.<br/>
<br/>
If stuff is more aggressive to us and resists more, hehe, I&#39;m in for it.<br/>
I&#39;ll keep an eye out tonite and if I find anything, I&#39;ll post it.<br/>
