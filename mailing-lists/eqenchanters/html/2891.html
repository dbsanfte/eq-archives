 </span></blockquote>Indeed, steamfont is a great place to spend L9-12 or so.  Watch for the<br/>
minotaur hero who comes out to that area and will kill you quickly.  Also,<br/>
if incompetent people are hunting the mino caves, you can get pretty bad<br/>
slaver trains or a L30 necro (whose name I currenty forget) pulled from<br/>
the cave.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also recommend Kurn&#39;s tower in Field of Bone starting around level 10.<br/>
The scalebone skellies in there are L8 or so, the greater skellies are<br/>
12-14, and the greater scalebones 11-13.  You&#39;ll find challenges here up<br/>
to level 22 or so.  Some of the other Kunark newbie areas (Warsliks, Lake<br/>
of Ill Omen) are also pretty sweet.  The only problem is you can&#39;t use<br/>
Cabilis facilities until L20, so take a lot of supplies to last you<br/>
between trips to the evil outpost or FV.<br/>
