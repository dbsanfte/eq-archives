<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140097440">I am a 9th level Enchanter from Felwithe, I have heard you guys talk about quests sometimes, but i cant ever seem to find any except that first one in Felwith (which i never did, because i cant get the flask to give to the smith anyway)<br/>
where are there more quests? and what items do you get from them???<br/>
