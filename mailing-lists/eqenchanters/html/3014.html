<b>Subject:</b> finally some fun fighting <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179197748">My regular group (just 3 of us) is myself the enchantress, my husband <br/>
druid, and our friend the paladin, all in the low 20&#39;s.  Until <br/>
recently, most fights found me doing tashani, choke, and maybe a <br/>
slowdown on the incoming mob, getting in the mob&#39;s face so he&#39;d aggro <br/>
on me and my pet would attack, then sitting on my butt waiting for <br/>
choke to wear off and recasting if needed.  On the rare occasions that <br/>
we&#39;d get 2 mobs, I&#39;d mezz the extra.  Our fights were efficient, but a <br/>
tad boring.  <br/>
<br/>
Then one night my druid husband and I decided to try out the forest <br/>
giants in Warsliks Woods.  These guys hit hard, and we had no tank <br/>
(Paladin off enjoying RL :)  The strategy we came up with was such a <br/>
nice change of pace.  The druid pulled with snare (if resisted, he <br/>
recast after my tashani), I tashani&#39;d, if that was enough to get the <br/>
mob&#39;s attention, I let him aggro on me and engage pet, if not, I hit <br/>
him with sanity warp.  Once on my pet (or me)  I&#39;d run off a bit <br/>
(we both were SoW&#39;d) and the druid nuked and got the giant&#39;s <br/>
attention.  While he tried to catch the druid, I nuked and got him <br/>
back after me.  We&#39;d run back and forth, nuking, and generally <br/>
confusing the poor guy, with my pet at it&#39;s back.  Finally it would <br/>
decide to run, but found snare interfering, and would just stand there <br/>
while my pet and druid husband beat it down.  After the battle, we&#39;d <br/>
have 2 or 3 bubbles of mana left and full health, and this was after <br/>
beating the low red ones.  Yeah, we then had to sit and med a bit, but <br/>
the battle was so much more fun playing dodge the giant. :)<br/>
<br/>
I had heard that druids and enchanters make good partners, now I know <br/>
why.<br/>
