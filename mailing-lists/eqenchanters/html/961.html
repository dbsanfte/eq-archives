wodering if all the debate and talk of strking is because people just don&#39;t<br/>
like change or if it is actually as bad as people are saying. I have no<br/>
problem protesting if I believe the change was not for good. I would really<br/>
appreciate a run down on what they have changed. Someone made referance to<br/>
spells that were weekened. What did the spell do before the update and what<br/>
does it do now?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Whirl till you hurl was our only Unique type spell. It stunned a mob and<br/>
allowed us to keep fighting them. Totally nerfed it now stuns them only<br/>
until theya re stunned, which occurs with all our direct damage spells,<br/>
which our pet does, which all tanks basically do, etc. Also there is now a<br/>
random chance to break free each hit. Basically you waste 55 mana for 2<br/>
seconds of stunning.<br/>
<br/>
Memory Blur. No damage, no stun, all it did was remove a mobs shit list. If<br/>
it was ana gro mob it would still come after you if you were in range. This<br/>
was however sueful for saving the lives of group members targeted by giants<br/>
or stuff, or getting a frenzied mob of a caster because it was unresistable.<br/>
After the change I cast it on a Dry bone skellie that was about 4 levles<br/>
above me and it wouldn&#39;t get off the tank who died. I soon followed. Spell<br/>
value is now zero since if its resistable why not just use mesmerize which<br/>
is also resistable and at least ahs a stun effect as well.<br/>
<br/>
Removement of the Enchantment of light and brilliance.<br/>
<br/>
Direct damage spells that ahve &quot;stuns&quot; that don&#39;t work, yet cause us to ahve<br/>
total resists instead of partial ones and a higher overall resist rate.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on but I am pressed for time.<br/>
