<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271737386">My wife has been telling me that for the last couple of <br/>
days her Bard has been killed by MOBS the con blue to <br/>
her @ 10th level (ie. zombies, madmen, Orcs) in North <br/>
Ro.  Prior to this she was able to take on 2-3 blues at <br/>
once but now 1 blue gives her a run for the zone most <br/>
times.<br/>
I do not know if this is true for my Enchanter per say.<br/>
My pets are dieing faster, but I usually don&#39;t die. <br/>
Anyone else notice Blues being tougher? Or is that a <br/>
Level 10 thing?<br/>
