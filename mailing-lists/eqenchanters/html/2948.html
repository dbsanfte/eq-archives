<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604272320">I looked up the Illusion Iksar quest and the scroll is no longer no drop.<br/>
That being the case, if I ever get the other 2 pieces for it (the powder and<br/>
the tiger skin) I will complete the quest and get you the scroll.<br/>
I was ambushed by 4 ton warriors while at the iksar brigand camp in the<br/>
Swamp of No Hope last night. The 2nd one dropped the totem. =) I was also<br/>
ambushed by a Froglok Vis Shaman. He dropped a &quot;Wing of Xegony&quot; that looks<br/>
like a BIM with a number in the bottom right. Anyone know what this is for?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
