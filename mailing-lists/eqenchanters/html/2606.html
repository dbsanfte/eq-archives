<div id="ygrps-yiv-354327303">I think it more has to do with whether the spell is considered to be<br/>
offensive or not.<br/>
  certain spells, such as strip enchantment are not considered to be<br/>
offensive. If you are trying to get the faction I might recommend<br/>
tossing a DoT on the mob, which will give you a damage point or two. As<br/>
for the DD spells, it is because our spells are all or nothing. Also you<br/>
can enthrall than nuke a mob, if it don&#39;t hit, the mob stays mezzed, if<br/>
it does, the mobs wakes up and chases you down. It&#39;s the enchanter<br/>
equivalent of root bombing =)<br/>

&gt; I was grouped with a few people killing bandits the other day and noticed<br/>
&gt; that I wasn&#39;t getting faction from most of them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d been using mostly mez and color flux, with the very occasional tashan,<br/>
&gt; choke, chaotic feedback, and some charming when I was FM and wanted to toy<br/>
&gt; with them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, it seemed that mezzing them, even if it broke prematurely, did not get<br/>
&gt; me on the faction list.  I got XP but no faction for those I only mezzed.<br/>
&gt; Tashan, charm, and damage spells all got me faction UNLESS I mezzed<br/>
&gt; afterward.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This makes some sense (but is annoying) due to the mem blur component of<br/>
&gt; mez.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, it seemed that a resisted color flux didn&#39;t get me faction and a<br/>
&gt; successful flux did.  That struck me as odd.  In addition, whirl didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get me any faction.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone else experience lack of faction for stun spells?  They definitely<br/>
&gt; aggro critters - why shouldn&#39;t they get you on the faction list as well?<br/>
&gt; In some cases, this will be an advantage, but mostly I WANT the faction<br/>
&gt; from things I&#39;m fighting.<br/>
