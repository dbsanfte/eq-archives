<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138684072">I can&#39;t say what will happen if I give him all the ingredients at once because<br/>
both times I did it separately and it worked fine.<br/>
<br/>
I never tried the alliance spell when the Ogre was in there, he killed me<br/>
twice. :(  I did notice however the ogre leaves at night (game time) and a dark<br/>
elf and a dwarf show up in his place.  They were indifferent to me, so I<br/>
completed that part of the quest when they were in there.<br/>

&gt; I forgot to mention that the web page doesn&#39;t mention that 2 of the<br/>
&gt; components (the Koalindl fish and the Eruds Tonic) required to complete the<br/>
&gt; first half of the quest (make the bartenders compendum) are no drop, as is<br/>
&gt; the compendum.<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A fellow guild member also told me to turn in the items to the Freeport<br/>
&gt; Bartender one at a time as giving all 4 at once sometimes doesn&#39;t result in<br/>
&gt; anything. I also was given conflicting advice that if you cast Alliance on<br/>
&gt; him from the &quot;patron&quot; side of the bar that the Ogre will(not) attack you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can anyone confirm/ deny either of these?<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
