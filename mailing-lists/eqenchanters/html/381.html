<b>Subject:</b> Re: ILLUSION QUESTIONS <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138621544">recently i have been noticing something strange about illusions. maybe not<br/>
strange, maybe its suppose to be this way, but i wanted to see if anyone<br/>
else noticed this, or is it just happening to me?<br/>
when i cast an illusion on myself. lets say Dark Elf, then i cross zones,<br/>
the illusion is gone???? and i have to quickly recast before anyone sees me?<br/>
why does the issusion disapeas between zones??? is this a normal thing? I<br/>
have not gone to the dark elf city because of this, because if i change back<br/>
into a high elf between zones in the middle of the dark elf city, i know i<br/>
will not be getting my body back?<br/>
any suggestions?<br/>
