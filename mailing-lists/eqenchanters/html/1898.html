&gt; just wondering if this list still existed... havent gotten any mail from it<br/>
&gt; lately...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; oh, and can anyone tell me where to find Yiz Pon? i mean, REALLY find him,<br/>

lot of time in West Karana, and have heard many people offering money if he is<br/>
seen.  I would suggest that this is a good place to start looking.</div>
