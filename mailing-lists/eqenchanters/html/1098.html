<div id="ygrps-yiv-358447815">He responded and said his statement regarding not playing an enchanter<br/>
was a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t being arguementative.  I am, however, overly tired of people<br/>
who don&#39;t have experience as enchanters saying things as if they were a fact.<br/>
I read his post in detail, and gave everything he had to say consideration.<br/>
I appreciate the input that he has made.  I was QUITE suspect when he<br/>
said he didn&#39;t play an enchanter, however.  I was interested in the nature of<br/>
his<br/>
experience with enchanters, so I could understand where he was coming from.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that you were being argumentative without having read his post.<br/>
If you will read his email, you will the the line i have quoted below in it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t play an enchanter but I am sure that they will like this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I say again, not trying to be argumentative, just clear.  But if you wish to be<br/>
argumentative, Im game.<br/>

&gt;Not to be argumentative, but if you don&#39;t play an enchanter why<br/>
&gt;do you post to this list?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then why are you? Being argumentative that is? Or nosy? If he wants to post<br/>
so what? Also where does he say he isn&#39;t an enchanter?<br/>

&gt;I am sure you all have seen the list of spells.  But I really wanted to make<br/>
&gt;so comments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Players will no longer crash when an extremely long group message is<br/>
&gt;received.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Preventing the from crashing is always a good thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Added the ability to pull one item &quot;charge&quot; from a stack by holding down<br/>
&gt;the &quot;Control&quot; key when left-clicking on the stack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For anyone who has ever tried to advance in a trade skill this is a welcomed<br/>
&gt;change.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- After casting a spell at an NPC, if the target were lost before the spell<br/>
&gt;made contact, the caster would crash.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is a declaritive statement.  Did they fix it or are they just<br/>
&gt;acknowleding it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- The &quot;/ignore&quot; command will now ignore emotes also.<br/>
&gt;- The chat command &quot;/e&quot; will trigger &quot;/emote&quot; instead of exiting to the<br/>
&gt;character selection screen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can&#39;t argue with change for the better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- We have added new sound tracks to the Planes, Crushbone, Guk, Mistmoore,<br/>
&gt;Steamfont, and the Estate of Un<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would rather have the bug worked on over the soundtracks but that is just<br/>
&gt;my own opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- We have reduced the amount of experience lost when dying by 50%.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This would have helped me 2 weeks ago when I hit level 14, 13 different<br/>
&gt;times.  Probably my favorite of the non enchanter changes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- A number of new quests have been added to various zones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But the question is do they actually work?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Magician pets (elemental) will now cast minor spells (to make up for their<br/>
&gt;lack of kick)<br/>
&gt;- New Magician spells on vendors and some Magician spells have moved to<br/>
&gt;different vendors<br/>
&gt;- New Magician weapons for Summon Fang & Spear of Warding & Dagger of<br/>
&gt;Symbols<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t play an enchanter but I am sure that they will like this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- New enchanter whirl spell (check the vendors)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone know what level this is for?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Whirl now works on MOBS better than it did on the last patch.<br/>
&gt;- The saving throw against Memory Blur and Atone was reduced (harder to save<br/>
&gt;against) from the last patch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;THEY LISTENED!  I am suprised.  Although they didn&#39;t put it back to where it<br/>
&gt;was, I am happy.  Really it could be a sham, the change could be only one<br/>
&gt;percentage point of resist and it would still be true.  BUT they did listen<br/>
&gt;to us and made an attempt to apiece us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- AC added to the Rune Series (Enchanter)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t have it yet but at least it isn&#39;t a downgrade.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Alliance series works better (Enchanter)<br/>
&gt;- Enchanter Attack Speed spells now have longer durations (Quickness,<br/>
&gt;Alacrity, etc.)<br/>
&gt;- Tashan (the entire Enchanter series) is now quicker to cast, costs less<br/>
&gt;mana, and is harder to save against.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What took so long?  These should not have been patches after the game was<br/>
&gt;released.  Tashan has always been pretty useless along with Alliance.  And I<br/>
&gt;told that the speed spells weren&#39;t worth the mana for what you got.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- New bard songs have been added to the vendors<br/>
&gt;- Paladins lose the spell Bravery, and gain the spell Valor<br/>
&gt;- ShadowKnights and Necromancers gain the Word of Spirit spell (replacing<br/>
&gt;Word of Shadow for the ShadowKnight)<br/>
&gt;- ShadowKnights lose Haunting Corpse and gain Summon Dead<br/>
&gt;- Necromancers and ShadowKnights get a new spell - Shadow Vortex.<br/>
&gt;- ShadowKnights lose Intensify Death (replaced by Shadow Vortex)<br/>
&gt;- Rangers lose Shield of Barbs and gain Shield of Brambles<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good for them....  =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Shorter stun effects will no longer remove longer stun effects (Bash won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;get rid of whirl, for example)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another example of Feedback in action.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Spell components are now stackable<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again what took so long.  Why were they ever created not stackable?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t let this stop any of your feedback or petitions.  Tonight send a<br/>
&gt;feedback giving thanks for the improvements, but also tell them what needs<br/>
&gt;to be improved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
