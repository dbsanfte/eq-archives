&gt; &gt; If your pet is attacking while you cast mes will it continue to attack and<br/>
&gt; &gt; break mes or will it stop?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nope, our pets have no brains and will continue to attack, breaking mez<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you need to mez and get your pet off, in a situation where the pet is<br/>
attacking a mob that is stuck on someone else, you CAN mem blur your pet, making<br/>
him back, then mez/enthrall/etc the mob.  This will work, as I have done this<br/>
many times with my pet, and other group members pets.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Does lull have any use during battle? Or is it just good for an initial<br/>
&gt; pull<br/>
&gt; &gt; from a camp?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its only good for a)initial pull and b)suicide since its highly resistable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hehe, you&#39;re not kidding!  Anyone have any suggestions on breaking a spawn?<br/>
I&#39;ve found the lull series not too dependable.  If it resists, a good amount of<br/>
times the MoB&#39;s will aggro, and I will pull a whole camp, resulting in one or<br/>
more deaths.  If I have a druid in my group I&#39;ve been having them use harmony<br/>
instead of me trying anything.  Too much bad luck for me.  Any suggestions?  I<br/>
know enchanters are supposed to be as good as anyone else at breaking spawns.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I know an MoB is a monster, but what does MoB stand for?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mobile Object, Moving Object, or something akin to that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cogg<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS.  there are no stupid questions.<br/>
