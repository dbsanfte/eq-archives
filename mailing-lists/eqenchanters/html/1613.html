<div id="ygrps-yiv-408346358">1 get root the most useful spell in the whole game<br/>
when in battle.<br/>
2 try and hunt wisps, they are everywhere but you can<br/>
finde em in east common west common, island inbetween<br/>
erudin and queynos. lotsa other places i&#39;m sure too.<br/>
They give good exp till like level 12.<br/>
They are pretty easy, ifyour an enchanter than your<br/>
pet can damage it.<br/>
Best tactic is to cast tashan get hit than fear it<br/>
till pet almost kills it than finish it off.<br/>
&lt;if you finish off more likely to have good stone and<br/>
WILL have better exp&gt;<br/>

&gt; anything else, so I don&#39;t know if I should buy Root,<br/>
&gt; Soothe, or Cancel Magic first when I get enough.<br/>
&gt; Anyone have any suggestions? Also, could someone<br/>
&gt; give me a suggestion as to where to fight? I do not<br/>
&gt; want to go to Crushbone, but the Dragon Bones in<br/>
&gt; Steamfont where I am fighting right now are also<br/>
&gt; pretty boring. I do not want to take a month to get<br/>
&gt; to the next spell circle like I did this time, can<br/>
&gt; anyone help me out?<br/>
