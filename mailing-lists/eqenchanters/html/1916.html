<b>Subject:</b> Where are Tinny daggers in Qeynos? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-136707062">Hy all,<br/>
<br/>
I have a little problem as i created erudite enchanter and after first 8 lv<br/>
i crossed a ocean without many tinny daggers.<br/>
WHERE i can find tinny daggers in qeynos? i dont wish to travel back to<br/>
erudin or to freeport as some enchanters suggested when i asked them in<br/>
game. I cannot belive that is possible that in qeynos dont exist seller of<br/>
tinny dagers, it is so big city there must be one seller but maybe hard to<br/>
find i spent nearly a day searching but i dont find it. Please if you know<br/>
where it is to share it with this list so that a enchanters dont have to<br/>
travel to other side of ocean or to freeport to get daggers.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
<br/>
Dilith  8 lv Enchanter, Soulsek Ro</div>
