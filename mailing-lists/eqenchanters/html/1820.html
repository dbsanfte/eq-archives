<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142309955">Fellow Enchanter&#39;s and Jewellers:<br/>
<br/>
I have been asked by a few of my allies for some <br/>
fine jewellery that would giev them some <br/>
resistence to magic.  As of now, my skill is not<br/>
that high, and I can only make enchanted topaz<br/>
necklaces.  After examining some charts on <br/>
jewellery, i have found that Wolf&#39;s Eye Agate will<br/>
indeed make an item that will help you versus<br/>
magic, when combined with silver.  Would anyone<br/>
happen to know where a tradesman such as I could <br/>
purchase, or find, some of this stone.  I have<br/>
not been successful in locating it in Erudin or<br/>
in Qeynos as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
Any help in this matter would be appreciated.<br/>
