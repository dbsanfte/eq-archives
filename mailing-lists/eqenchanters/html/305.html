The pets are also in the keep, on the main floor, to the left as you come<br/>
in, I think.<br/>

Subject: [eqenchanters] High Hold Pass<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I have recently acheived level 8 and would like to be able<br/>
&gt;to summon a pet that doesn&#39;t con green to me. I have been<br/>
&gt;told that the only place to get Mircyl&#39;s Animation is in High<br/>
&gt;Hold Keep. I know the way is treacherous, and am asking for<br/>
&gt;help from my fellow enchanters. Attached below is a map of<br/>
&gt;High Hold Pass that I got off of one of the most incredible EQ<br/>
&gt;map sites I have seen to date. Unfortunately, almost everything<br/>
&gt;on the site is in Japanese. If one of you who has made the trip<br/>
&gt;could mark the path to take from Kithicor to the bank, then to<br/>
&gt;the vendor who sells the spells and maybe annotate a few<br/>
&gt;things to watch out for (like the prisoners past the bank), I, along<br/>
&gt;with all the up-and-coming enchanters out there, would be<br/>
&gt;very appreciative.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;Oh, here is the link to that webisite...<br/>
