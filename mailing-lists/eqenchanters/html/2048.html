<div id="ygrps-yiv-425689273">My philosophy is I&#39;m in the game to have fun.  Sometimes that means<br/>
powerleveling, sometimes roleplaying, sometimes questing, sometimes just<br/>
socializing.  I&#39;m not a hardcore leveler or roleplayer or quester all of the<br/>
time.  Depends on how I feel that day, how much patience I have, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So with that philosophy in mind, I don&#39;t have an issue with one of my<br/>
characters receiving help from another.  I would be embarrassed to be<br/>
running around in all plat jewelry, silken green drape, and a nice staff<br/>
under level 20 or so.  But, if I had one or two particullarly nice items<br/>
 from another character or friend that helps my fledgling character then that<br/>
works for me.  I&#39;m not on a crusade to crawl on my knees with every<br/>
character scraping coppers together as I start out.  I like to meet people,<br/>
fight, solve quests, roleplay a little bit, and most importantly have fun.<br/>
<br/>
If you understand your class (meaning you didn&#39;t level too fast) and can be<br/>
helpful in a group or help another solo&#39;er in an unobtrusive way then I<br/>
think that&#39;s a good way to go.  By helping another solo&#39;er I mean helping<br/>
them finish off a monster that is kicking their butt or casting buffs on<br/>
strangers, etc.  If my +intelligence platinum jewelry I earned from a<br/>
totally different character provides me the opportunity to do things like<br/>
that better and make the game more enjoyable for me by skipping the<br/>
invention of the wheel every time I start out so be it.<br/>
<br/>
So, there are purists for roleplay, questing, item acquisition, etc.  Each<br/>
of us will be more/less strict on how &quot;pure&quot; we are in each area.  Sometimes<br/>
I read through quests on web sites or check item stats.  Sometimes I trade<br/>
items from one character to another or even some money.  It all goes back to<br/>
what is fun.  EQ isn&#39;t a job or a professional endeavor with set rules.<br/>
There&#39;s no right/wrong way to do it (insofar as not hurting other players<br/>
gaming experience-enjoyment).  So some readers refuse to twink and others<br/>
are wondering what is the big deal.<br/>
<br/>
just have fun  ;)<br/>

My *personal* opinion.  Twinking is defined by a character receiving<br/>
money or items (s)he hasn&#39;t *earned*.  If you can go kill a bunch of<br/>
skeletons and sell the bone chips for a hefty amount - so be it.  That<br/>
character did the &quot;work&quot;, that character performed the sale<br/>
transaction, that character got the benefits.  Having another (usually<br/>
higher) character &quot;help&quot; would be twinking.<br/>

Just my 2 coppers<br/>
