<div id="ygrps-yiv-59679169">OK, what happened here?<br/>
I just scanned a list of Enchanter spells and see we get out first Evocation<br/>
spell at 8th level and it&#39;s mana cost is a whopping 45. Chaotic Feedback has<br/>
a long recovery time, has a poor Mana/Damage ratio, and will fizzle like<br/>
crazy early on.<br/>
At 8th level the skill will max at 45. If you haven&#39;t spent training points<br/>
in it each level, it will be a very time consuming action of getting this<br/>
skill to where you don&#39;t fizzle just thinking about casting it. Does anyone<br/>
have a quick solution to raise this skill quickly besides standing around<br/>
casting it on yourself? At level 8 I will have 30 training points to spend<br/>
as I have 10 left still. If I max my Jewelcraft at 21 and pump the remaining<br/>
9 into Evocation I will still suck but it will not take me nearly as long as<br/>
if I started with a &quot;0&quot;. Yes, I made the mistake of priming it with 1 point<br/>
within my first 2 levels before I saw when we get the first Evocation spell.<br/>
<br/>
I spent 15 minutes last night incresing my Divination from 1 to 23 while<br/>
casting Sense Magic (mana drain of 5). I also spent time increasing<br/>
Abjuration from 3 to 18 last night with Minor Shielding. Recovery time was<br/>
ok, but the thought of this for evocation gives me a headache. It could take<br/>
your entire night of self-casting to get this maxxed. This assumes you<br/>
intend on not wanting to die in combat after 9 fizzles in a row and becoming<br/>
OOM while a Green MoB kicks the crud out of you.<br/>
<br/>
Am I crazy, or should we have a low level Evocation spell? Even if it does<br/>
nothing like Sense Magic, I would spend the $ to get it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have thoughts on this?<br/>
