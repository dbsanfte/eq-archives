<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939915868">Zealott is correct..  You have to at least put one training point into Each<br/>
Specialization Skill before you can get over 50 in one particular spec<br/>
skill.<br/>
I went into Alteration personally and just trained one point in all spec<br/>
skills and just my normal casting got ALT past 50 before any of the others<br/>
even got close.  But if you are worried then you may just want to train in<br/>
the particular skill you want and wait until it is leveled up almost to 50<br/>
before training in the other skills.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
