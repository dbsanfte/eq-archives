<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I got mine there very fast, but I was lucky I think 
because one enchanter in my guild has been there for 3 weeks on and off and 
hasn&#39;t gotten one yet :( I think that Verant needs to make the Ton warrior&#39;s a 
little more abundant! I also thought I was lucky so I went back for another and 
didn&#39;t see one for 4 hours, and all it had was ton warrior piece of a totem. 
That piece of crap wont do anything for you when you do the quest. :&#92;
