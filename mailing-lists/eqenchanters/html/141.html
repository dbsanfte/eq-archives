<b>Subject:</b> CHAR vs WIS vs INT .......STOP THE INSANITY!!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231452687">well I hate to agree with sumone that is so definate but.......<br/>
<br/>
        I have been playing since beta4 and have freinds that have been in<br/>
since phase 3......even Stratics and the EQVault (which are authored by beta<br/>
testers!!!) tell us that charisma is the direct effect of merchant<br/>
sales.......the debates you are talking about are obviously on webpages that<br/>
are NEWER or are made by ppl who are just lrearning the game and are made<br/>
based on assumtions of ingame actions......if you read EQSS and find out<br/>
what they say....... I quote straigth from the ATTRIBUTE section on the left<br/>
hand side of the website......this is cut and copied for all you NON<br/>
belivers!!!   if you ppl will notice that ONLY the charm spell is effected<br/>
by CHARISMA!!!!........the ***&quot;CHARM&quot; LINE OF SPELLS ONLY***!!!!&gt;........<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    STRAIGHT FROM STRATICS ATRIBUTE PAGE!!!!      eqss.stratics.com<br/>
&quot;WISDOM (Mana for Priests, Resistance to Mind Spells, Tertiary Skill Check)<br/>
WIS is the mana determinant for the priestly casters, and their derived<br/>
hybrids (Cleric, Shaman, Druid, Ranger, Paladin). It is bar none the most<br/>
important stat for the former three classes and a consideration for the<br/>
latter two. This attribute also affects your character&#39;s resistance against<br/>
mind-affecting spells, such as Charm. In addition, WIS provides a last<br/>
chance to succeed at a failed skill roll. Although INT is the secondary<br/>
skill-up attribute for most skills, WIS may grant you to continue a failed<br/>
skill roll. Minimal as the chance may be, it is still the opportunity to<br/>
succeed on a roll one has already failed via skill check.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
INTELLIGENCE (Mana for Mages, Skill Gain)<br/>
INT is the mana determinant for the non-priestly casters (Wizard, Enchanter,<br/>
Magician, Necromancer), their derived hybrid (Shadowknight), and also<br/>
determines how quickly one will gain skills. As such, it is important to all<br/>
classes, but is especially so for the four non-priestly casters.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CHARISMA (Faction Standing, Merchant Prices, Charm Success)<br/>
CHA affects NPC prices--when both buying and selling--and also how NPCs will<br/>
react to you. While generally not a stat that most people raise, saving some<br/>
hard-earned platinum on that plate breastplate is always a nice bonus. Also,<br/>
CHA is almost the INT of faction. By having high CHA, you reduce the amount<br/>
of faction you need to have NPCs change their view toward you. This can be a<br/>
nice bonus when questing. It is also a factor for Charm spells, which<br/>
notably affects the enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
            OK so can we put this to rest until more thourough and<br/>
conclusive information can be posted or studied?......please ppl we need sum<br/>
new topics.......<br/>
