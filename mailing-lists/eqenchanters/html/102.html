<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574004204">Invisibility by nature is unreliable.  If you are invisible, still keep away<br/>
from any harmful creature.  Instead, when you want to have a minimal chance<br/>
that you will be killed, cast it and hope.<br/>
<br/>
I use invisibility to travel through Highpass Hold, and across East Karana<br/>
when I don&#39;t want to encounter some of the nasties in there.<br/>
<br/>
As to duration, it can last from a few seconds to several minutes.  I have<br/>
had it last over 20 minutes, and it usually lasts from about 5 minutes to 10<br/>
minutes.  If a creature spots you and is unfriendly, then invis will not<br/>
stop it from hitting you.  Once spotted, and on that creatures hate list,<br/>
neither invis nor minor illusion will stop you from being attacked.<br/>
<br/>
Still, all in all it is a useful spell.  If you must travel in hated lands,<br/>
by all means use it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

&gt;I gave up a level 16 dark-elf necro because their invisibility spell (<br/>
&gt;gather shadows ) was very unreliable. One sad evening, coming back from a<br/>
&gt;very long quest that brought me to Kerra Island and South Karana, I got<br/>
&gt;hacked multiple times in Riverdale losing about 4 bubs of xp because my<br/>
&gt;invis wore off on me randomly. I got really pissed off that at level 16, I<br/>
&gt;could not manage to cast a level 8 spell reliably and decided to start<br/>
&gt;another character more appropriate for travelling since I was very much<br/>

&gt;With my enchantress, I got invisibility at level 4 and used it some times.<br/>
&gt;It always seemed to work great but I might be wrong. Yesterday, I found out<br/>
&gt;that this invisibility spell is as bad as gather shadows as a %$#%^^%$<br/>
&gt;griffin nuked me a few seconds after I cast invisibility. Since then, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;noticed the same kind on unreliability...but only since I made level 8...I<br/>
&gt;might be wrong.<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I would like to know how&#39;s the enchanter&#39;s invisibility like at<br/>
&gt;level 16 or 20 or more. CAN YOU COUNT ON IT?<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
