&gt; I wouldn&#39;t recommend doing Hateplane with less than 200 CHA, and usually I<br/>
&gt; do Fearplane with 200, but it is not quite as important there as<br/>
everything<br/>
&gt; resists a lot less.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hate has some nasty trains, I remember getting a Spite and 4 clerics of<br/>
&gt; Innoruuk on a pull. We were able to ice the 4 clerics until the spite went<br/>
&gt; down, then picked the clerics off one by one, and those things are very<br/>
&gt; difficult to get mes to stick. Weve also pulled a train of 8 mobs in Hate<br/>
&gt; that we successfully defeated, 200 Charisma is the best gun you can have<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt; I know many guilds on our server that would have called evac but we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; usually up for a good challenge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Items can usually get your int/cha pretty high. I am working now with<br/>
&gt; 204cha/176int, but with a few items Ill be able to get over 200/200.<br/>
&gt; (adorning grace adds +40 to cha)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Being Level 50, i need to ask you a question...I am level 41, and have<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; &gt;working on getting my INT up, not my CHA.<br/>
&gt; &gt;my int is 189, and my cha is 135 with buff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I hear for the Planes you really need a high CHA, can you comment on this<br/>
&gt; &gt;Maelael?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanx<br/>
