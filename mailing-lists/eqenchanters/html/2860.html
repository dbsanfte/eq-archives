<b>Subject:</b> Hi everyone <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635253964">I wanted to say hi and that I just started an Enchanter. I was wondering if <br/>
I could get some advice from all of you out there. I&#39;m Erudian, but I am <br/>
hunting with a friend in Qeynos Hills right now, I&#39;m 4th level. I really <br/>
don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing, usually here is what combat is like, I haven&#39;t <br/>
been lucky enough to get in a group yet.<br/>
<br/>
1. Summon and Buff Pet<br/>
2. Tashan<br/>
3. Suffacating Sphere<br/>
4. Enfeeblement<br/>
5. Watch Animation beat up critter, sometimes help.<br/>
6. Run away recast Animation and help finish it off.<br/>
<br/>
Those are pretty much all the spells I use, with the exception of Minor <br/>
Guard, Haze and Strengthen.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that the best exp for me is to kill the diseased stuff and turn <br/>
in thier pelts for alot of exp and a cure of course, that&#39;s really nice. I <br/>
turned in a fleshy orb once, but she handed it back and said to go to <br/>
Freeport, though I have no idea where that is.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any problems with what I&#39;m doing? Please give me any advice you <br/>
can, I would love to hear it, I don&#39;t wanna get stuck in a way of doing <br/>
things only to find out that it will be wrong when I get higher in levels.<br/>
<br/>
PS: Where in Qeynos do I buy The daggers for the Animation spells? I lookf <br/>
for hours, and go very lost.<br/>
