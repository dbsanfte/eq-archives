<div id="ygrps-yiv-960125716"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;5&gt; Why does my pet always stand on what I&#39;m trying to loot?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as far as i can tell, pet always tries to stand at your loc plus a bit on <br/>
each axis (or mebbe it was minus...been a while since i messed with it) so <br/>
it will always stand in the same direction relative to you...<br/>
try walking to the other side of the corpse, and it should get out of your <br/>
way...<br/>
also worth watching when resting near walls and such, since pets sometimes <br/>
go wandering if they cant stand where they want to...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;6&gt; Is being agnostic going to cause grief later?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>depends on how much verant decides to do with the religion specific items...<br/>
unless they do a lot of them, odds are pretty good that whichever religion <br/>
you pick is gonna be wrong too tho, so probably not worth worrying about...<br/>
(i picked Brell before the benefits of agnostic were discovered, and it <br/>
hasn&#39;t seemed to be too big a problem so far)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;7&gt; Any other tips you might have would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>biggest piece of advice i would give, is figure out Mez, and learn to time <br/>
it....<br/>
