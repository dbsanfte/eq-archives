<div id="ygrps-yiv-201317617">I agree with your assessment that most twinked players<br/>
can&#39;t play for squat.  The reason is that they leveld<br/>
too fast and did not get to learn the intricacies of<br/>
their new class.<br/>
<br/>
At level 34 with my enchanter I took a break to play a<br/>
druid.  Of course I dressed that druid very well and<br/>
hit level 20 within a couple of weeks, playing solo<br/>
all the while.  Around level 20 you hit the point<br/>
where you need to group to make adequate progress.  I<br/>
did not know how to play in a group as a healer, so I<br/>
went back to my enchanter.  I&#39;m at level 45 now with<br/>
the enchanter and doubt that I will go back to that<br/>
twinked druid.<br/>
<br/>
Even still, I don&#39;t consider twinking to be cheating. <br/>
I earned all of that equipment.  Now players buying<br/>
stuff on EBAY...  that&#39;s a different issue.<br/>

&gt; I personnally have never looked at twinking as<br/>
&gt; cheating, more just of<br/>
&gt; shortcutting. I do tend to avoid playing with<br/>
&gt; twinked people as I have found<br/>
&gt; that most of them can&#39;t play for squat. They tend to<br/>
&gt; consider themselves<br/>
&gt; invulnerable, as most monsters near their level are<br/>
&gt; quite easy to kill. At<br/>
&gt; some point (Brad has said this and I have seen it in<br/>
&gt; action), the monsters<br/>
&gt; you are fighting catch up to whatever gear you have,<br/>
&gt; and then you must rely<br/>
&gt; on teamwork and play skill to survive. And if the<br/>
&gt; twinkees (generally) had<br/>
&gt; that to begin with, they could go out and get level<br/>
&gt; appropriate gear and<br/>
&gt; survive. &lt;gets down off his soapbox and awaits the<br/>
&gt; flames while waiting for<br/>
&gt; an on topic thread to start&gt;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now that the lifetap spells of necro&#39;s are<br/>
&gt; resistable, are people finding<br/>
&gt; it even easier to find a group?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Twinking is having one of your high level<br/>
&gt; characters gain<br/>
&gt; &gt; equipment/items/money and then transfer it to one<br/>
&gt; of your lower level<br/>
&gt; &gt; characters.  One method of doing this is to &quot;drop&quot;<br/>
&gt; the items on the<br/>
&gt; ground,<br/>
&gt; &gt; log out, log in with your other character and<br/>
&gt; &quot;find&quot; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another method is to pay another player to hold<br/>
&gt; the items while you log<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; and back in with your other character.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Many regard twinking as cheating as far as &quot;that<br/>
&gt; character&quot; did not earn<br/>
&gt; &gt; those items.<br/>
