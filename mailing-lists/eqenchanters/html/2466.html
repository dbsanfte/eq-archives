<b>Subject:</b> A question about the Tashania quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-653100806">I know every detail of the quest to get the Tashania spell, but one part<br/>
worries me. I am currently KOS to most faction groups in Neriak (even with<br/>
Illusion: Dark Elf and Benevolence) because of my religion (Erollisi Marr)<br/>
and a few unfortunate run-ins with the Neriak Guard population. One part of<br/>
the Tashania quest reqiuires that I see Mizr N&#39;Mar in the Neriak Library to<br/>
get my glowing coin of Tash converted into a gleaming coin of Tash. Will I<br/>
be able to do this without dropping invis? Being invis is basically the<br/>
only way I can roam Neriak unmolested, and I am usure if initiating a trade<br/>
with an NPC will cause my invisibility to drop. I am pretty sure that would<br/>
be the case, and being killed by angry NPCs in the Neriak Library really<br/>
doesnt appeal to me...<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate some advice from anyone that has completed this quest.<br/>
Am I right to think that initiating a trade with an NPC will make you<br/>
appear? If so, does anyone know what faction group Mizr and the surrounding<br/>
NPCs belong to? And is there anyway that I can raise my faction with this<br/>
group? Any help would be appreciated :)<br/>
