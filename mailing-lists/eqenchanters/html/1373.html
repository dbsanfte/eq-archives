<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593023379">Right ok I have to get into this conversation RIGHT NOW.  I am a 14th lvl<br/>
enchanter on Rallos Zek, and either the market on the care bear servers is<br/>
much healthier or I&#39;m really having a LOT of bad luck.  I&#39;m lucky if I can<br/>
sell a new silver jaded ring for 10 plat, and those bloodstone earrings are<br/>
really my main staple since everyone wants earrings these days.  For all<br/>
you people with +1000 plat in the bank.. well I&#39;d really like to hear your<br/>
methods of achieving this... I&#39;m ALWAYS hovering under 20 platinum before I<br/>
blow it all on Jewels and metals... and I&#39;ve never had more than 30 pat<br/>
total inthe bank!  WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT I&#39;M NOT?!?  You have obviously<br/>
some secrets that I am completely unaware of, and I&#39;d sure like some hints.<br/>
 Currently my enc is around crushbone since Kelethin is a good place for<br/>
materials (but BAD for markets) and I find its difficult to find a good<br/>
place to &#39;hang around&#39; off of faywer (gnomes arent as loved as they should<br/>
be).  I suppose some of this has to do with being on RAllos Zek and I<br/>
should assume some level of difficulty but I really would like to explore<br/>
this skill to its fullest.  PLEASE?<br/>

&gt;&gt;I sell platinum for 100p per stat, and gold for around 50p (some items<br/>
&gt;&gt;less).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Rare stuff I sell for 150p per attempt ( they supply gem ) and 2000p if I<br/>
&gt;&gt;succeed.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I currently have over 25,000p in the bank.<br/>
