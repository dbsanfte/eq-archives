<div id="ygrps-yiv-2295618">As you are on Faydwer, I would recommend Butcherblock...you can kill skunks,<br/>
spiders, goblins...then dwarf skels, basilisks and bats.,..finally move onto<br/>
the chessboard for undead pawns around level 10 or slightly earlier grouped.<br/>
Alternatively, go to the Nybright camp in LFay around lvl 10...good xp and<br/>
they drop bronze weapons which sell for around 2pp each to merchants.  You<br/>
could try Crushbone around level 8 but it tends to get very crowded and with<br/>
DVinn and Crush around, you are likely to get killed by a train or two.<br/>
