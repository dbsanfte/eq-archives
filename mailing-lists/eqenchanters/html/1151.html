When I was playing my necro in Paw I got in over my head when a captain<br/>
came to join the fun I was having with 2 nobles.  Luckily for me a group<br/>
was near and a nice enchanter cast mesmorize on the offending MOBs.  I<br/>
went unconscious in the process so wasn&#39;t attacking them to make them<br/>
made again.  I ran away once I could stand up and one of their party<br/>
healed me a bit so I could go faster than a crawl.  Mes saved me thanks<br/>
to a helpful enchanter.<br/>

well it took me quite some time to get this spell...now I have it.<br/>
and it does not do a thing. I used it plenty of times in unrest<br/>
yesterday<br/>
night on a horde of green death beetles. Nothing! <br/>
Occasionnaly one would resist and come for me, that&#39;s all!<br/>
What&#39;s the deal? Anybody has some info on this spell?<br/>
