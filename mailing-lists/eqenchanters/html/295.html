<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370706378">I have a friend dwarf who has found some strange pages on recently killed<br/>
orc centurions and oracles.  He sold them for somewheres around 6PP per<br/>
page (he had 2 of them)<br/>
<br/>
These could be the pages and he found them on orcs at a camp in the<br/>
butcherblock mountains.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; for necros, it&#39;s based on words ( like Word of divination ) that you<br/>
&gt;need<br/>
&gt;&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; combine and for Enchanters, it seems to be based on pages of Lost Books<br/>
&gt;&gt; that<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; need to be restored.<br/>
