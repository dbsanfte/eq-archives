i think the biggest reasons they dont have switching between servers are:<br/>
<br/>
1) it would require one machine to house all the characters for all the<br/>
servers. that would get bogged down quicker than the login server now.<br/>
<br/>
2) the world of EQ has a money and item system that is well balanced.<br/>
switching characters between servers would cause an unbalancing of this.<br/>
believe it or not, there is an economy in Norrath. if you ever lost your<br/>
corpse, you know what i mean. they wont give you everything you lost unless<br/>
they can find it somewhere else in the game or on another corpse that was<br/>
lost, for you. they wont ever just conjure one up and give it to you.<br/>
