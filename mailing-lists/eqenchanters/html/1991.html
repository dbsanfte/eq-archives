<div id="ygrps-yiv-827891907">As i was reading another list they mentioned the silver coins. The location<br/>
of all the coins except one are in pools of water. The one in Erudin is in<br/>
the fountain and is the only one i have seen, but then again i havent been<br/>
looking for them i didnt know what to do with it so it only took up space.<br/>
At least now i know where to go with it, as i find them i will let the list<br/>
know where they are located.</div>
