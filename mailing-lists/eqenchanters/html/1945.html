&gt; Hi everyone, i am new to the world of enchanters (not to Norrath itself,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have played a cleric, warrior and magician to around lvl 20).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am embarking on this new adventure with a group of my friends, all<br/>
&gt; starting new characters, on a new server, so as to help us resist the<br/>
&gt; twink temptation...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, could some of you wisened enchanters give me some thoughts on<br/>
&gt; starting my character?  Race?  Attributes?  Spells to avoid?  Should I<br/>
&gt; be a jeweler?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>

Your first stop should be to this site<br/>

It should answer the majority of your questions.  I&#39;ve been playing a High Elf<br/>
myself, and I&#39;ve found it to be a great class for Enchanters.  Gnomes would be<br/>
great too if Verant would fix tinkering (Watch out about Charisma though,  It<br/>
really means a lot to an Enchanter)  I&#39;m a charmer, more than anything else so I&#39;d<br/>
rank Charisma over intelligence, but thats more of a personal preferance as they<br/>
are both extremly important.</div>
