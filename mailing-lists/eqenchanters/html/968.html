<div id="ygrps-yiv-543209716">I play two characters. One which is solo / independent from y friends...a<br/>
Dwarven Rogue.<br/>
The other, my enchanter, is played with a dedicated group.  We all play together<br/>
on a regular<br/>
schedule and consequently there is no divergence.  Not everyone can do this I<br/>
guess.  But I did<br/>
have to travel for work for a week and had NO trouble catching up a level solo<br/>
when I returned.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The deal quite frankly is thsi. I can&#39;t play with my friends because theya<br/>
 re all outleveling me. When theya re online I play with them even though<br/>
 theya re 3-4 levles ahead of me and even though sometimes I am zero use to<br/>
 them because none of my spells stick. When they are offline I cannot findany<br/>
 groups to play so I am stuck attempting to solo which is incredibly slow and<br/>
 dangerous too.  This is the Second Wave of friends that has out leveled me.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i agree with you  i play pretty regularly and i am at lvl 8 i am having fun<br/>
but allof my friends are 16 so now i cant hardly fight at all<br/>
