 </span></blockquote>I am far more concerned with our debuffs then damage spells. We will never<br/>
be as powerful as a wizard and so if a group is choosing absed on damage<br/>
dealing capabilities we would lose that battle anyway. No waht I would like<br/>
is for our whirls to go back to working, for our Memory blur to not be<br/>
resistable, for our debuffs t actually affect the creature and for them to<br/>
be castable on deep reds as well. The thing I would change with our damage<br/>
spells is Either make the secondary stun effect REAL or remove it. It is the<br/>
dual effect that causes our resistances to skyrocket supposedly. Personally<br/>
I would not mind a lesser damage ratio if chaotic feedback actually did its<br/>
job of stunning. I would alos like it if the Enfeeble line did mor ehten 4<br/>
extra strength loss at levle 20 over level 4.<br/>
I stacked these spells on myself and they really made a difference. I was<br/>
encumbered etc. But mobs don&#39;t get encumbred, and I ahve yet to see any real<br/>
damage reduction. <br/>
<br/>
My list:<br/>
1) Restore Whirl till you hurl to full effectiveness. If you need to make<br/>
this spell into a line of spells each of which is useful over a range of<br/>
levles then fine but they are our bread and butter spells and should never<br/>
be research required and should always have the same mana/stun ratio. If you<br/>
double the mana usage then the stun length had better double too, or the<br/>
ability to be resisted go way down. <br/>
<br/>
2) memory Blur should again be irresistable. I cast this on a Dry Bone<br/>
SKellie alst night that was 4 levels above me to get it to stop killing my<br/>
tank. Resisted. Tank died, I soon followed. <br/>
<br/>
3) Debuffs that matter.  A wizard can cast a single spell and do damage to<br/>
multiple creatures. If I want to debuff I have to debuff individually and it<br/>
costs A LOT of mana to debuff a single creature to the point where anyone<br/>
will notice. Make us some area affect debuffs, or lower the mana<br/>
cost/refresh time of our debuffs so we can cast on multiple targets in a<br/>
single battle. <br/>
<br/>
4) Area Affect Point blank Tashaan, nuff said.<br/>
<br/>
5) Charm should put an Icon on the screen that we cna cancel just like any<br/>
other buff thus breaking the control. Since we are required to have Tashan<br/>
memorized, and charm basically requires us to memorize and cast invisibility<br/>
to use as well we are down to 5 spell slots. Making Charm put an icon up<br/>
which we could cancel will give us one extra spell slot and also be<br/>
beneficial to the dev teams favortie characters, Druids. <br/>
<br/>
6) Item or Place enchantment spells.  How about circles of warding? Resist<br/>
bonuses? <br/>
<br/>
7) Buffs that can extend the length of other classes buffs.<br/>
<br/>
8) Stackable buffs and debuffs. Why cna necros stack their Dots but ours can&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, you&#39;ve got my list:<br/>
&gt;1) Damage spells should at least do some damage when resisted following<br/>
&gt;similar rules as the wizard spells with a lesser ratio to keep a balance<br/>
&gt;with the wizards that are a nuke-only class,<br/>
&gt;2) Our spells should not jump from a 20-30% resistance to a full 100%<br/>
&gt;resistance ( from reds with one level above yellow to reds with two levels<br/>
&gt;above yellow ), there should be a nicer ramp so that an enchanter is not<br/>
&gt;completely useless in a group of 6 people attacking one strong red target.<br/>
