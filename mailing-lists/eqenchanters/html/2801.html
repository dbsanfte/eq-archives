<div id="ygrps-yiv-562499910">Is it possible to get to 200 int/cha (both at the same time) before you can<br/>
get into the planes?<br/>
<br/>
My level 22 enchanter is at 165 cha (which seems to be working great), but<br/>
only 143 int.  She&#39;s a dark elf.  Yah yah, I know.  Dark elves aren&#39;t the<br/>
best choice.  But I just won&#39;t play any other race of caster.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have 200 int and 150 charisma on your enchanter.  I dont<br/>
&gt; believe it is a good investment to lower your int to gain more<br/>
&gt; charisma since at this point and having done some tests it seems to<br/>
&gt; me that it all pretty much works the same after 150 charisma.<br/>
&gt; However, if you can improve it without sacrificing INT by all means<br/>
&gt; do so.  In the end, I suppose it is all a moot point if you can get<br/>
&gt; to 200 int, 200 cha.<br/>
