&gt; As far as enchanting items, we won&#39;t know until we see it.  They had some<br/>
&gt; Enchantment of brilliance spells which were supposed to make the item give<br/>
&gt; off light.  I&#39;d like to see a level 8 or level 12 spell which temporarily<br/>
&gt; makes a weapon able to hit magical creatures.  We have a damage shield<br/>
spell<br/>
&gt; (Feedback) so I doubt if that would be an enchantment (unless it was lower<br/>
&gt; level).  Any old school D&D players remember the spell &quot;Permanence&quot;?  Make<br/>
&gt; that a level 44 or 49 spell so our temporary weapon enchantments would<br/>
last<br/>
&gt; forever.  It would be neat to make a sword flame temporarily and give<br/>
extra<br/>
&gt; damage.  I wonder if we&#39;d have to hold the weapon as we cast the spell.<br/>
All<br/>
&gt; we know now is that it will be done, but I honestly have no clue what will<br/>
&gt; actually be implemented.<br/>
