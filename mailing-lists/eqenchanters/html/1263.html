<b>Subject:</b> Yet another question about charm <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-392736872">I had an expierence yesterday in blackburrow.<br/>
<br/>
I charmed a gnoll for the heck of it and had it attack a scrawny gnoll.<br/>
Well, the scrawny got hurt and started<br/>
running.  A while later like 4 various gnolls came running back and<br/>
attacked me which my group promptly smited.  Thank goodness for groups.<br/>
<br/>
So now I know to root the thing before it starts running.<br/>
<br/>
The question I have is what if the pet I have gets hurt and starts running?<br/>
Actually, would the pet even do that?  If so, would a train start?<br/>
<br/>
Also, a tad bit off topic.  I got a bronze long sword.  Just wondering what<br/>
I can auction one off for (if its even worth trying to auction off that is)<br/>
Thanks<br/>
