<div id="ygrps-yiv-408177277">let me think back ........(it was one of the first spells i bought at 8th) ....... aaaa yes i remember now.  There is a library in the 3RD GATE area of the city (the furthest zone in)  after you pass the main gate ( dont worry you will know it ) there are 2 main passages  one angling left and the other to the right . take the left passage i belive and you will see a black building with pillars , the vendor is on the first floor . he is the middle vendor .   rule of thumb  , check the spured (in common section) , then the library, than maybe the dead (passage on the outside of the library leads to the dead , you will know you are going the right direction if you pass ghouls) .</div>
