<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628029051">No, you cannot put any more practice points in after 21, as this would upset the system. The cost of making jewelery is much more than putting points in and spending say... 6 platinum a point at later levels. Making jewelery you would have to spend possibly hundreds of platinum to get a point or two.<br/>
