<b>Subject:</b> Color Shift in PvP situations (possible bug) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487465674">Howdy fellow Enchanters,<br/>
<br/>
I was dueling a Necro last night on the Erollisi Marr server with my level<br/>
29 Enchanter, Timn. I was casting Color Shift on him,<br/>
hoping to stun him and stop his casting. But I noticed that when I cast it,<br/>
nothing would happen. If he had been affected by the spell,<br/>
I would have seen &quot;Soandso is stunned by scintilating colors.&quot; If he had<br/>
resisted the spell, I would have seen &quot;Soandso resisted the<br/>
Color Shift spell.&quot; I saw neither of these messages.<br/>
<br/>
I didnt see any message at all when i cast it. I thought I might have been<br/>
in error, maybe i had memorized the wrong spell. So we<br/>
tried it again, and i made absolutely sure I had Color Shift memorized.<br/>
Sure enough, we tested it out, and he wasnt stunned. The<br/>
spell had no effect on him whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
I have used Color Shift in duels quite a few times, and until recently it<br/>
has worked splendidly! But this was the first time I had dueled<br/>
since the Temple of Solusek Ro patch...perhaps that has something to do<br/>
with it? Can anyone offer any input in this matter? Has<br/>
this been going on for awhile, and I just haven&#39;t heard about it? I check<br/>
caster related sites quite frequently, and have never seen<br/>
anything regarding this problem.<br/>

&quot;There are some who call me . . . Timn?&quot;</div>
