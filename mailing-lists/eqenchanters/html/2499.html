<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150830162">I don&#39;t think this is true either.  I wanted a Runed Circlet so I went and<br/>
camped it.  I sat right on the stage waiting for him to spawn.  Killed on<br/>
PH, surfed the net a bit on my second computer, and them the Preacher<br/>
spawned right in front of my with the RC and a Velishoul&#39;s Page (how<br/>
convenient!).<br/>
<br/>
There has always been rumors of anti-camping code in EQ, but I don&#39;t know of<br/>
a single location in the game where it&#39;s been proven.<br/>

&gt; Rumor has it though in the preacher room if you walk on the stage it will<br/>
&gt; cause the Preacher not to spawn, Is this true?  He only spawned twice all<br/>
&gt; day yesterday (and my group was very careful not to walk on the stage.<br/>
&gt; heh).  Any truth in this? :)<br/>
