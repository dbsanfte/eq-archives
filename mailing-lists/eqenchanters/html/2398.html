<br/>
I saw a few posts yesterday claiming that stun series do not break<br/>
enthrall/mes? That information is wrong. Stun breaks mes every single time,<br/>
unless it is resisted, which is why color series arent necessarily a good<br/>
thing to use while messing. However, a good tactic to save the party and you<br/>
some damage, is when pulling 3 or 4 mobs, Color Skew is nice to hit before<br/>
you start enthralling (especially when they are after you). In this way you<br/>
can enthrall 2 of them before the stun wears off, leaving only one more to<br/>
deal with. IMO this is much better than starting with an AE mes, since AE<br/>
mes breaks at the same time and they all come tearing after you.<br/>
<br/>
Also yes tashan (tashani, tashania), put you on a high aggro list. Another<br/>
hated spell is our slow line (tepid deeds, shiftless deeds = high aggro). I<br/>
typically throw both of these on at the beginning of the fight putting me on<br/>
the high aggro list. Which is why I also have memory blur up at all times.<br/>
Cast that and usually it will forget you... very rarely Ill have to cast it<br/>
2x.<br/>
<br/>
Mes series have fairly fixed durations... approx 15 sec mes, 30sec enthrall,<br/>
60sec entrance, 120sec dazzle. Take off all your MR buffs, and cast them on<br/>
yourself and time them. Dazzle kept me stunned for 128 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
And this is not verified, but some monsters do seem to have a slightly<br/>
faster stun break. But thats not been proven. Large creatures you cant even<br/>
stun tho, (cyclops, giants, etc), and some creatures break mes instantly<br/>
(ice giants, fire giants, swirlspine seahorses)<br/>
