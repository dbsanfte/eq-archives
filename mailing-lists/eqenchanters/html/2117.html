&gt; I can&#39;t say what will happen if I give him all the ingredients at once<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; both times I did it separately and it worked fine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I never tried the alliance spell when the Ogre was in there, he killed me<br/>
&gt; twice. :(  I did notice however the ogre leaves at night (game time) and a<br/>
&gt; dark<br/>
&gt; elf and a dwarf show up in his place.  They were indifferent to me, so I<br/>
&gt; completed that part of the quest when they were in there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I forgot to mention that the web page doesn&#39;t mention that 2 of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; components (the Koalindl fish and the Eruds Tonic) required to complete<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; first half of the quest (make the bartenders compendum) are no drop, as<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; the compendum.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A fellow guild member also told me to turn in the items to the Freeport<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bartender one at a time as giving all 4 at once sometimes doesn&#39;t result<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything. I also was given conflicting advice that if you cast Alliance<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; him from the &quot;patron&quot; side of the bar that the Ogre will(not) attack<br/>
&gt; you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Can anyone confirm/ deny either of these?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks.<br/>
