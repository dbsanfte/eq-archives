<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518918087">The way I did it was to let the cards fall where they may. In other words, I<br/>
trained a point in each and played the way I normally play. If my<br/>
specialization:Evocation had made it first, then obviously it was the one<br/>
that was used most often, and should be the one that got the benefits of<br/>
specialization. As luck would have it, my playstyle emphasized Alteration,<br/>
so that&#39;s what my specialty is in. That actually surprised me, given the<br/>
fact that the Mesmerize line of spells is Conjuration, and I use those very<br/>
heavily. Anyway, I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that specializing in<br/>
Alteration might be a good idea for Enchanters, but it may not be for ALL<br/>
Enchanters.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s not just that most of our spells are alterations that you want to<br/>
&gt; make<br/>
&gt; this your primary specialization. The spells you will be tossing in combat<br/>
&gt; will be mainly alterations. That is why alteration should be the primary<br/>
&gt; specialization. My method for specialization has been to put one point<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; alteration specialization, wait till it hits 49 or 50 (took most of the<br/>
&gt; way<br/>
&gt; to 21 or even just past), then go back to the nearest guild and put one<br/>
&gt; point in all the others and one more in alteration. I don&#39;t have an hour<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; two to sit around and do nothing in the game, so this worked good for me.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; also noticed that the lower level alteration spells almost never raised<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; skill whereas with the higher level spells it seemed to go up more often.<br/>

&gt; &gt; What they said.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Definitely put a point into each Specialize skill (one for each spell<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill) and then make sure you stop casting any spells other then the one<br/>
&gt; &gt; you want to eventually Master at about skill 40.  The reason is that you<br/>
&gt; &gt; want them all and that you cant get one above 50 until you have at least<br/>
&gt; &gt; put a point into each of them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I also recommend Alteration. At the present time Baelsih at Castersrealm<br/>
&gt; &gt; is the only one who has a good page for viewing spells by skill type.<br/>
&gt; So<br/>
&gt; &gt; look at your spell list or hit his site and then view by the different<br/>
&gt; &gt; categories to see what spells you like and the skill they fit in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You will find that most of our spells are Alteration.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since Specialization will reduce mana cost if it works it should be for<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells you will cast often and when your mana may run out.  For example<br/>
&gt; &gt; combat spells or enchantments.<br/>
