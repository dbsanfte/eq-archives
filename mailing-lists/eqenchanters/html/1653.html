<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325882097">Truthfully you should have started with electrum/malachite as soon as<br/>
silver/jade was trivial. At a skill of 38 I had about a 50% success rate<br/>
with electrum/malachite which was cheaper than a 70% success rate with<br/>
silver/pearl. You can continue with electrum/malachite all the way to the<br/>
mid 70&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, I too noticed at least with high level gems that a 5 gold or so<br/>
&gt; profit could be made by selling back to the vendor an enchanted silver<br/>
&gt; piece of jewelry. Does not help much if you fail, but still beats losing<br/>
&gt; money on those items that don&#39;t sell well (at least not for what they are<br/>
&gt; worth) but are helpful for raising skill (like silver pearl rings and<br/>
&gt; such).  I&#39;m almost to opal and am about to switch over to electrum (even<br/>
&gt; though I can&#39;t enchant it yet). Wish me luck ... I&#39;ll need it!<br/>

&gt; 	I got different results than this. While working on jewelcraft last <br/>
&gt; night, making electrum malachite, I found that the merchant would buy <br/>
&gt; back unenchanted bracelets for about 2cp below component cost and <br/>
&gt; enchanted bracelets for about 1gp above component cost. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I decided that it was still better not to enchant the metal, since I<br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; making about a hundred of them, and waiting on mana made things much <br/>
&gt; slower. Regardless, if you have a lot of time on your hands, and money <br/>
&gt; is an issue, it might be worthwhile to enchant the metal when <br/>
&gt; practicing. <br/>

&gt; 	                Just a note that enchanting the silver does not<br/>
&gt; alter <br/>
&gt; the price you will <br/>
&gt;                 get at a merchant for your jewellery.  Note that the <br/>
&gt; merchant might sell <br/>
&gt;                 the item to a player for less than you would sell it to <br/>
&gt; them (i.e. the cost <br/>
&gt;                 of a non enchanted item). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	                When you&#39;re improving your skill and just intending<br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; sell back the <br/>
&gt;                 jewellery, you should try to not enchant the metal. <br/>
&gt; When you&#39;re making <br/>
&gt;                 jewellery to order, then go ahead and enchant away. <br/>
