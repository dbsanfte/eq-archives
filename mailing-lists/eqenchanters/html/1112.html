Trade Skills:<br/>
The trade skills certainly could (and will) be made better, but the whole<br/>
point of a player-driven economy is that an item is only worth what another<br/>
player will pay for it -- it has no innate worth (other than the bare<br/>
minimum, which is what a merchant will pay for it). I&#39;d rather hear a<br/>
complaint that the items created via Jewellcrafting should have better<br/>
stats so that it would demand a better price (which in some cases may be<br/>
true) than that the trade is broke because it costs more to create the item<br/>
then an NPC merchant will buy it back for.<br/>
<br/>

Faithfully yours,<br/>
