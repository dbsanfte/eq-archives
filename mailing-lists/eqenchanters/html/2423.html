&gt; Subject: Level 20 research pages .. and evil eye .. questions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know the best mobs to look for to get Tasarin&#39;s pages 30 and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>312 for beserker strength and color shift spells.  Since I fail repeatedly<br/>
at making them, and I see no one auctioning these pages, at this rate I will<br/>
be level 30 before I have them.<br/>
<br/>
My best luck for finding these was in Oasis on deepwater crocodiles. Easiest<br/>
option would be to do a /auction for the pages you want in the zone. I<br/>
usually offer 2pp for these. Lizards from the maze in Cazic Thule are also<br/>
good for these pages and the level 24 spell research pages (now if I can<br/>
just find about 10 faded velishouls so I can make feedback, finding all<br/>
kinds of necro research stuff off the level 31-33 goblin warriors in<br/>
HighKeep, but few enchanter items).<br/>
<br/>

&gt; And looking ahead a bit as well, where should I go for the level 24<br/>
 </span></blockquote>research pages as well.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; My poor (and I mean &#39;broke&#39;) level 21 enchantress has CHA and INT both<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just over 130.  I am working hard on jewelcraft to try to fill in my (bare)<br/>
ear slots, and wrist slots in particular, but she currently sports damask or<br/>
leather or cloth underwear. A second question I have is .. at what level can<br/>
I successfully do Evil Eyes in the gorge (given the above stats, and with a<br/>
magic resist of 57).<br/>
<br/>
At 24, I was soloing (no pet either) EE&#39;s without a problem. Under that,<br/>
your damage output may not be sufficient. Due to the charming the EE&#39;s do, I<br/>
would recommend not using a pet on them. Had a stein in one hand and a Skull<br/>
of Jhentra in the other (weapon, what&#39;s a weapon? really haven&#39;t used one<br/>
after level 22). Buff up with endure magic. Enthrall the pet, burn the EE<br/>
into the ground (WTYH is actully useful here), then mem blur the pet when<br/>
the eye is dead. Very important to tell anyone you are with not to touch the<br/>
pet (watching it slash itself for 32k always impresses people the first time<br/>
they see it). In the gorge, nearby critters will come and assist anything<br/>
you fight which is why the mino&#39;s jump in. The king room in the gorge (the<br/>
room with the big stone altar type thing and the 2 EE spawn spots) also has<br/>
some horrrible pathing issues. Putting up a pet there always attracted the<br/>
whole room on to me. It is one of those non pet friendly areas.<br/>
