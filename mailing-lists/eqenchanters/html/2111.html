<div id="ygrps-yiv-974446570">Evo is not really a nessecity, even at level 8.  My suggestion would be to stop<br/>
casting it on yourself.  (that hurts)  At least go to the Freeport/Commons<br/>
newbie area and whack Orc Pawns/skellies with it.  You get a nice faction<br/>
adjustment, and maybe even some cloth or rusty weopons to sell.  Why target<br/>
yourself?  Otherwise, I raised mine by only using it in situations where it<br/>
wasn&#39;t a neccesity, like when you&#39;re soloing a low blue.  By doing this, I<br/>
managed get Evo to a useable state by level 10 1/2, and I maxed it by level 12.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
AND STOP NUKING YOURSELF.</div>
