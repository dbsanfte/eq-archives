&gt;&gt; - Poison. Meditating is NOT sitting. I wish someone told me that before.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Just figured it out after I saw the poison effect wore off and watched the<br/>
&gt;&gt; hp grows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When you meditate, you *do* sit, so I&#39;m not sure what this statement means.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It does means =you do not sit=!. For poison&#39;s purpose anyway. Sitting hp<br/>
recover rating is 2hp/tick an help flushing poison out of system faster.<br/>
Meditating rate is 1hp/tick and doesn&#39;t help with poison. Try it, find out<br/>
by yourself.<br/>

&gt;&gt; - Jewelry. Jewel&#39;s prices are related to the level of one&#39;s skill. At<br/>
&gt;&gt; jewelry 30 I sold rose quartz wedding ring at 133sp (+cp), made 31 and<br/>
&gt;&gt; price went up 152 (+cp). Almost no loss :P. I noticed something similar<br/>
&gt;&gt; earlier (I worked lvl 9-13 on my own before buying the rest of the lvls<br/>
&gt;&gt; from a teacher). So maybe jewelry is not so bugged in the first place. If<br/>
&gt;&gt; anyone else can confirm/infirm this I would appreciate (test sales before<br/>
&gt;&gt; and after a 10th is reached)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Most likely you just sold to a different vendor that liked you better. If<br/>
&gt;this is not the case, it would be a MUCH needed change.  Another would be to<br/>
&gt;raise the benefit of the enchantment based on your jewelcraft skill, so<br/>
&gt;someone with a skill of 100 could make a MUCH better item than someone at a<br/>
&gt;skill of 30.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	After working my way up to lvl 31, I would be a complete twit not to sell<br/>
only at best possible price, I only like losing gp that much. Both sales<br/>
were made at the same place/vendor/time/patch version (if you need to know<br/>
the routine, I buy 4 silvers bars in one place (WF). Go play/hunt in<br/>
EC/Befallen and once I get enough money for the need of the day sell with<br/>
the Erudite vendor in EC (Im Erudite too). Buy one gem/sale the result if<br/>
any/buy another one until out of money or silver bars)...Plus, as said<br/>
before, I noticed something similar between 10 and 11 but at the time<br/>
figured it as an oddity. <br/>
<br/>
	Alliance : It never says in the rules it is the spell&#39;s purpose. Please<br/>
state your sources. At this moment I have to test if it helps on quests/talks.<br/>
<br/>
	Jade : Just to make sure after new patch, I went through all vendors in<br/>
mage guild in Freeport. No one has any jade for sale. Most likely it was<br/>
due to player&#39;s loot.<br/>
