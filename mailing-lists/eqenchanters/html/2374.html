<div id="ygrps-yiv-259234139">Yes, the enchanter is a group class, you can turn a party of 5 into a<br/>
nonstop killing machine. The power of an enchanter doesn&#39;t really shine<br/>
until later levels, tho they do quite nicely at earlier levels. What I mean<br/>
by that is people can party for a long time and take other classes or an<br/>
enchanter, it may not matter much to them.<br/>
<br/>
But major runs at high levels, you end up hearing this &quot;our enchanters are<br/>
not online, so we wont be able to go to the planes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, our class is just like clerics. You cannot do planes, dragons,<br/>
phinigel, well at all without your enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
But I would suggest grouping, because understanding how to be most effective<br/>
in a group is important in these later levels when your group has 24 people.<br/>
Solo at higher levels... take on full rooms of blue mobs, take on live<br/>
tower, the ghoul sage or magi, etc solo when you are 50...because you will<br/>
be one of the few classes that actually can.<br/>
