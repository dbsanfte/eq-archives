<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121170642">I am from Flewithe, and still in that general area doing all my exploring<br/>
there, I am half way to level 11, and i want to get the spell Alliance to<br/>
have for when i travel to new areas. i can not seem to find in in Felwithe,<br/>
i am sure its there, can anyone tell me where? i would greatly appreciate<br/>
it. and also, if you cast Alliance on a guard...like a darkelf guard, will<br/>
he attack you?<br/>
