<b>Subject:</b> Re: More on Twinking? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-23283904">My *personal* opinion.  Twinking is defined by a character receiving<br/>
money or items (s)he hasn&#39;t *earned*.  If you can go kill a bunch of<br/>
skeletons and sell the bone chips for a hefty amount - so be it.  That<br/>
character did the &quot;work&quot;, that character performed the sale<br/>
transaction, that character got the benefits.  Having another (usually<br/>
higher) character &quot;help&quot; would be twinking.<br/>

Just my 2 coppers<br/>
