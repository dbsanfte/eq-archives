<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027049607">heh, thanks man. i would be 19 by now if i hadnt died 3 times in one night<br/>
at unrest... i have a newfound hatred for hags... i&#39;m just patiently<br/>
waiting to hit 20 so i can get my last name. =)<br/>
<br/>
by the way, if anyone is into research and is level 16 or above, and knows<br/>
reliable clerics and tanks, go to unrest. lots of pages to be found, lots<br/>
of words as well (for whoever uses em). also lots of loot. you can split 3<br/>
ways and get 5 gold each on some MOBs, as wel as brass armor, bronze and FS<br/>
weapons, magic items... and it&#39;s easy to not die if your party knows what<br/>
they are doing (or if you dont get trained on, my 3 deaths were due to<br/>
someone training undead knights and hags to the zone point).<br/>
