of the time, it will just stun and not wipe the hate list.<br/>

&gt; The rat may not have a long duration on the hate list.  It&#39;s possible<br/>
&gt; that different monsters have differing memory lengths.  have you tried<br/>
&gt; this same experiment on a higher level mob?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Try this:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Stash your weapon (use your fists). Hit a low level<br/>
&gt; &gt; mob (I used a non-agressive rat).  The rat will<br/>
&gt; &gt; turn and attack you.  Cast mesmerize, stop your<br/>
&gt; &gt; attack and back away.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When I did this, the rat eventually woke up and just<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; walked right by me.  This seems to me to indicate<br/>
&gt; &gt; that I was cleared from his &#39;hate list&#39;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anybody have any other explanation for this? </span></blockquote></div>
