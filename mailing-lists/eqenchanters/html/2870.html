<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Mez does have a mind wipe component but it is only good at lower levles.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Up till 20 it works pretty reliably (meaning if your attacked it is because your in aggro range or did something after to get you back on the Hate list) and after that it becomes less reliably. &nbsp;The wipe is a separate save and possibly effected by charisma.</font>

Does Mesmerize (single target level 4 spell) have a mind wipe effect to it?<br>
Last night I was at the GFay 3 spawn bandit camp and with a bad pull, I had<br>
2 on me. Bandit #2 spawned as the #1 was running at me. =( &nbsp;I killed #1<br>
which leveled me to 8th (yay!) and had 1 bubble of health, and my pet was<br>
dead. I turned off my attack and tried to mes. I forgot to Tashan, so by the<br>
time it stuck, I had a sliver of life left. I backed up the hill (30 to 40<br>
feet) and sat down to med and get enough mana for a fear and also to heal up<br>
as I didn&#39;t have bandages either. When my &quot;Your Mesmerize spell has worn<br>
off.&quot; message came up I didn&#39;t move trying to get one last tick of health /<br>
mana, and waiting to get whacked to auto stand up. It never happened.<br>
<br>
Did I just back up to far for the agro to kick in? Or did the Mesmerize wipe<br>
me from the hate list as I hadn&#39;t actually hit the bandit in melee?<br>
<br>
Oh, btw I have looted 3 vials of elven blood from the bandits that have<br>
woodelf graphic models. This is for the new armor, but I can&#39;t remember<br>
which ones.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your replies in advance.<br>
