<div id="ygrps-yiv-607149718">If your charisma is high enough you won&#39;t really lose money making<br/>
non-magical stuff to work on your skill.  From my experiments I found I<br/>
was losing 2 coppers when buying/selling non magical stuff.  With a<br/>
skill of 21, Jasper was safe for me to work.  Carnelian (the next step<br/>
up on the merchant I saw) was too hard for me.<br/>
<br/>
by the way I haven&#39;t seen any of my posts show up today, are people<br/>
getting these?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;.. but I suppose that you can sell them for more...with a base<br/>
skill of 21, I dont want to waste money making non-magic rings. With<br/>
which<br/>
stone do you think I can start practice with? do I have to start from<br/>
malachite? can I start with Onyx? or even more expensive stones? thanks<br/>
for<br/>
the help.<br/>
Also, can you tell me which rings you found out are the best to sell to<br/>
players?<br/>
