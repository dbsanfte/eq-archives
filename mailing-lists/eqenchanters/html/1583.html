It&#39;s spelled Sylverlokk, and yes I&#39;m on E&#39;ci, only level 29 though.<br/>
I will test them when I can, If they don&#39;t stack thats a bug it seems to me<br/>
and should be bugged and feedbacked.<br/>
Can you give me some details about feedback like how much mana it costs and<br/>
what it does?<br/>

&gt;Is it just me or do these not stack.  I was trying to cast Rune II last<br/>
&gt;night with Augmentation on and noticed I was not getting a Icon for Rune II.<br/>
&gt;I hope that maybe I was bugged lastnight because it doesn&#39;t seem right that<br/>
&gt;they dont stack.  One is a damage shield and the other is a Agi buff.  Any<br/>
&gt;one knowing anything about this please let me know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has Feedback been fixed yet I know there was a problem if the MOB died by<br/>
&gt;Feedback the corpse disappeared.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;SilverLock I was wondering is that the name of your character on EC&#39;I?  I<br/>
&gt;dont ever remember seeing you around there I keep track of most of the<br/>
&gt;higher level enchanters and know most of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for your time all.<br/>
