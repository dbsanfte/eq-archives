<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894579006">Well acoording to verant it was because when they gave magi pets weapons the<br/>
delay factor plus duel wield madde them to powerful. If anything else though<br/>
it would of been the necro pets though. You could send one of them into exe<br/>
room and have them solo it all bythemself. Sage too except for the sage<br/>
iteself.<br/>

&gt;Even after the pet-nerf, I still enjoy using my pet to solo @ level 45.<br/>
&gt;Although its more exciting to use the charm methods to fight solo, there is<br/>
&gt;something to be said for having a pet that you know will never turn on you.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d also like to point out to the younger enchanters out there that if you<br/>
&gt;summon a pet, for goodenss sakes use every buff you possibly can on them<br/>

&gt;reason for the pet nerf a few months back was because our pets were FAR<br/>
&gt;tougher than any other pet at high levels (when properly prepared with low<br/>

&gt;&gt; On one post I read on an enchanter board before it said that enchanter<br/>
&gt;pets<br/>
