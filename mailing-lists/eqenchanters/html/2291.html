&gt;yup, one at least... If you are hit while zoning into Lavastorm from <br/>
&gt;Solusek<br/>
&gt;B there is a chance you will be thrust into the lava in Lavastorm.  When <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;return to Lavastorm from Nek Forest you will find your corpse sitting near<br/>
&gt;the zone there... this only happened to me once but a groupmember said that<br/>
&gt;this had happened to him also and wasnt that surprising.<br/>

&gt; &gt; There are a number of places where being hit at the zone border plops <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; somewhere else in the next zone.  Here&#39;s some that I know of:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unrest to Dagnar&#39;s Cauldron:<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you are hit on your way out of Unrest you may fall &quot;below&quot; the world.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You will find yourself in the water under the land which goes around the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lake.  When this happened to my wife I suggested she swim off the edge.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t do that!  She fell for 10,000 points of damage and I had to get my<br/>
&gt; &gt; necro to locate her corpse (which was beneath the land near 0,0).  <br/>
&gt;Without<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; necro we would have never found it.  Meanwhile we had petitioned a GM <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt; &gt; was sad when he finally got to us because my wife had already looted her<br/>
&gt; &gt; corpse otherwise he would have res&#39;ed her.  When the same thing happened<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; me I knew not to swim of the edge but what to do?  I swam to the middle<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; climbed up the island.  Once you do this you can swim back to the land <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; climb up.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oasis to No Ro:<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you are hit hard enough (sand giant, etc.) on your way out of Unrest<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; may find yourself near the inn but the kicker is you will fall for some<br/>
&gt; &gt; small amount of damage.  It&#39;s not much but if you were almost dead you<br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt; &gt; be dead after you fall.  This is a change from a while back where you<br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt; &gt; bounce back into Oasis at full health (which was kind of cool).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Beholder Maze to Runneyeye:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Had to run from a train that was led into the entrance of Runneyeye.  <br/>
&gt;Got<br/>
&gt; &gt; hit going through apparently and died.  My corpse was not on either side<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the zone.  I managed to find it in Runneye in the first alcove to the <br/>
&gt;left<br/>
&gt; &gt; by the little stream.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone know of others?<br/>

&gt; &gt; On fighting in Lavastorm:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Be very very careful if you are fighting near the entrance to Najena.<br/>
&gt;This<br/>
&gt; &gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt; happened to me and a friend of mine.  After being ambushed by 3 fire<br/>
&gt; &gt; elementals<br/>
&gt; &gt; while looting my corpse (I just got all my armor, but my bags were on my<br/>
&gt; &gt; corpse)  I ran to the zone to Najena because there was no way I was <br/>
&gt;going<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; live otherwise.  Instead of zoning into the hallway where you&#39;re <br/>
&gt;supposed<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; end<br/>
&gt; &gt; up, I ended up in a room full of Magicians and pets and was immediately<br/>
&gt; &gt; killed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had to petition to get my corpse (which took 2 hours).  The GM that<br/>
&gt;helped<br/>
&gt; &gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; was very nice and pulled my corpse out to safety for me.  When this<br/>
&gt;happened<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; a friend of mine the GM&#39;s weren&#39;t quite so nice.  They didn&#39;t believe <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; just zoned in to avoid a monster they believed he was &quot;exploring&quot; in<br/>
&gt;Najena<br/>
&gt; &gt; (at<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 12!).  It took him 2 hours of arguing with a GM before he got his<br/>
&gt; &gt; corpse<br/>
&gt; &gt; back.  Both GM&#39;s mentioned that this does happen occasionally at that <br/>
&gt;zone<br/>
&gt; &gt; edge<br/>
&gt; &gt; (the second GM said my friend&#39;s corpse was on the wrong side of the room<br/>
&gt;:(<br/>
&gt; &gt; ).<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have no idea if or when they plan on fixing it. :(<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has this happened to anyone else?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Solo hunting? Lavastorm is ok, you can hunt near Najena and zone if <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a problem. Don&#39;t know how much gear you have, as you hit the harder<br/>
&gt;things<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;ll need a magic weapon. Yard trash in Unrest is also very good at<br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level, there&#39;s about 6 spawn spots inside the maze just past the<br/>
&gt;fountains<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; where you will be off the tracks. I think the regular aviaks (not the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guards) in front of the Arena in Lake Rathe should be ok, though they<br/>
&gt;may<br/>
&gt; &gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; too low. There&#39;s also a lizard man camp in Rathe Mountains (one<br/>
&gt;outrunner<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and 2 in camp). The Southern Ro dervish camps have an outrunner at <br/>
&gt;each<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you can go back and forth between or join a group doing one of the <br/>
&gt;camps<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (the east one is preferable, there&#39;s a safe area near the grass where<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can pull to and no ghouls or dry bones will wander through). The solo<br/>
&gt; &gt; dervs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; may spawn a little tough on occasion, but you can kite those using <br/>
&gt;fear.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Might be able to do the orc camp in misty thicket, not sure exactly <br/>
&gt;how<br/>
&gt; &gt; high<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they are, but level 10-12 I think. If you can get  4 or 5 people<br/>
&gt;together,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the orc camps in Rathe Mountains are great experience and loot. <br/>
&gt;There&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my good spots (good as in loot, experience, and rarely occupied).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am level 12 and looking for some good hunting grounds, I think I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; gunna<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try lavastorm today so I&#39;ll see how that goes.  But where was<br/>
&gt;everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; favorite hunting grounds at level 12?<br/>
