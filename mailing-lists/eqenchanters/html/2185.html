<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038141652">I had a problem on the boat the other day twice, the problem was that when I<br/>
was taking the ride from Butcher to FP just as I was about to complete the<br/>
loading to FP I would be dropped.  When I finally got back in I would land<br/>
on the boat JUST before it would zone back into the OOT, this happend 2<br/>
times and wasted an hour of two of my time.  After I petitioned because I<br/>
was swimming back to FP and realized I couldn&#39;t zone swimming they summoned<br/>
me back, I should have petitioned the first time because they were extremely<br/>
nice about it.<br/>

&gt; reason I got off the boat was because a GM standing on the Pier in<br/>
&gt; Freeport<br/>
&gt; teleported me from OOT after I petitioned.<br/>
&gt; YOU have been SUMMONED by the GODS!!!!    &lt;~ I will never forget this<br/>
