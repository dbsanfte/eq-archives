<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771349945">I&#39;ve noted that a few others out there said they got stuck at 16 and <br/>
21st lvl.<br/>
<br/>
I am a High Elf enchanter and i&#39;m stuck at 1bub into 21st lvl. I <br/>
have tried the kunark zones but can&#39;t seem to find a group. I have <br/>
tried to solo but my skill at it sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Please help me.<br/>
I need to know where I should be hunting. I just took the long run <br/>
to Qeynos and that is so I can hunt in SK where everyone has <br/>
told me I should kill Treants or Avaiks. (I don&#39;t really want to kill <br/>
treants, as I like being able to port to Druid rings)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</div>
