<div id="ygrps-yiv-210404796"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="4" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Trebuchet MS">Hi everyone, 
<br> &nbsp;I am in the process of attempting to start my epic quest. (again) When I 
<br>created Galadriana, I was pretty much clueless about what religion I should 
<br>pick and so forth. I for some reason chose Rodcet Nife, well what a mistake 
<br>THAT was. I cast illusion drybone on myself.. but the spec&#39;s killed me 
<br>because of my god.. next time I casted improved invis on myself and got thru 
<br>everything &nbsp;including the spec&#39;s BUT &nbsp;as soon as I cast collaboration on 
<br>reania the other guild masters instantly killed me, because of my religion. 
<br> &nbsp;I am currently working on the crate quest in qeynos to up my faction with 
<br>opaldarkbriar, and I&#39;ve smacked old Neclo Rheslar in west karana several 
<br>times too. (opal is the necro guildmaster under freeport) . Does anyone have 
<br>any tips or hints or any suggestions as to what I can do that could help me 
<br>start this part of my epic so i dont get killed every single time??
<br>
<br>thanks,
