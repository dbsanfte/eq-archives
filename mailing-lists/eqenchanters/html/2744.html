Wear what you want. Everyone will have an opinion. Only one really counts.<br/>

I love people who claim to know everything. And yes please tell me that I am<br/>
wrong that I wanted to wear the Thaumaturgists robe over the Yellow Erudite<br/>
robe when I played. Yes, I am wrong for wanting to wear a different robe<br/>
than the one I had been wearing for 4 months. I suppose my friend is also<br/>
wrong for actually liking the color. In the future I will be sure to listen<br/>
and adhere to your personal preferences.<br/>
<br/>
And I dont care what drivel people spout about what stats do and what stats<br/>
dont. We have proven time and time again that we notice a greater<br/>
performance when stats are increased... we cannot state exactly why, but our<br/>
performance is nonetheless greater.<br/>
<br/>
I personally have a 200 charisma and a 200 intelligence and I am aiming to<br/>
increase my agility now. If i feel as if my performance in game has not<br/>
changed with the increase, perhaps Ill try Dexterity next, for the last<br/>
alternative would be stamina for more hp.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you still believe in the fact that Wisdom is what affects<br/>
Jewelcraft. I cannot dispute if it is correct or not, but I can guarantee<br/>
that I jewelcraft with a wisdom of 128, and people who are wearing their<br/>
&quot;wisdom gear&quot; to get near 200 wisdom around me are failing a lot worse than<br/>
I am, and I have a 198 skill compared to their 200.<br/>
<br/>
But again I appreciate your explaining to me the inner workings of the game<br/>
and what I should and should not like, as Im sure many other people on this<br/>
thread appreciate it as well.<br/>
<br/>
People dont listen to when people tell you what you need and dont need. Take<br/>
it into account, play with different configurations, and stick with what you<br/>
like best. Its a game... have fun.<br/>

Actually, I did play in the beginning, when the gossamer robe cost over a<br/>
hundred, if you found someone selling it, people dreamed about when they<br/>
would one day have a FBR, and people wondered what that guy in the OOT was<br/>
for, he was wearing a funny robe.  No one had heard of the SMR yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Now  lets talk the merits of the Tham robe...<br/>
<br/>
Your senior robe is AC6... ( +2 mana, that&#39;s useful )<br/>
the Tham robe is AC5 +3 agility   <br/>
<br/>
Now  unless you still live in some dream world thinking that Agility has<br/>
some mystical function in the game; even when everyone, including Brad<br/>
McQuiad, the producer of the game says it does not; you must know that<br/>
agility really only affects your AC.  For Erudites, Humans, and other lower<br/>
agility races, at the levels that you would wear the tham robe, it takes 4<br/>
agility to raise your ac ONE point.  3 agility does not raise it one whit.<br/>
If you are Dark elf or other higher agility race ( i.e. more than 75 )  it<br/>
take 6 or 7 points of Agility to raise your AC ONE point.<br/>
<br/>
Now keep in mind, agility affects your total AC, not the AC on the item, and<br/>
that agility HAS NO OTHER FUNCTION IN EQ OTHER THAN RAISING YOUR AC.  (( For<br/>
anyone piping up that Agility affects your channeling, get a gun and shoot<br/>
yourself, you are hopeless ))<br/>
<br/>
Now, here is the real kicker... based on your LEVEL ( nope, still not your<br/>
agility, but keep that dream alive ), items add more AC than they list in<br/>
their description.  An ac 6 item adds 8-9 to your real AC number.... a AC5<br/>
item adds like 6-7.  ( I do not care what real number it really is, like I<br/>
said, it is level based, not a linear formula, and all results will vary<br/>
anyway)  To add to your misery, just like the Agility calc, it throws away<br/>
fractions, so 8.999 is 8 and 9.001 is 9.<br/>
<br/>
Now  for the most important reason to NOT wear the tham robe... IT IS CRUD<br/>
BROWN.  <br/>
If you cannot get a pure white Gossamer robe, the pinnacle of fashion, get a<br/>
green senior, red senior, Blue senior, or even a Purple Senior from the<br/>
necros in FP.  Just do not wear those gay ass yellow or violet senior robe.<br/>
<br/>
Now   if you want to continue this conversation, please direct it to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:moghedan@...">moghedan@...</a>, and not this list.  I will be happy to tell you all<br/>
the ways you are wrong in private.<br/>
