<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194808374"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;my opinion is that if an enchanter is getting hit, something &gt;is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unless you play it really safe (which means you&#39;ll never get to experience the<br/>
REAL fun of being an enchanter... i.e. the rush to survive an unsurvivably situation,<br/>
instead of evacing... I usually get to call evacs, and I don&#39;t go unless there<br/>
is NO way, and there very rarely is no way), I don&#39;t see how an enchanter could<br/>
NOT be hit a lot... for me, my goal is to keep everything that&#39;s not being hit<br/>
by the main tank out of the fight, and NOT hitting the healers... leaving the<br/>
healers free to heal at need.  Mostly, this involves mezzing them, but there<br/>
will be resists, so if that involves making them all mad at just me and beating<br/>
on me, fine.  Perfect... the madder they are at me, the less chance they&#39;ll<br/>
run at the healer when he casts, and the more clumped they are.  At lvl 53,<br/>
I can cast with 3 to 8 things beating on me, if I don&#39;t panic.  And the clerics<br/>
I usually work with are pretty good, they&#39;ll help me out with a stun on the<br/>
ones hitting me.  But, that&#39;s just me.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On another topic has anyone else tried using AE stuns and AE spells to kill<br/>
<br/>
&gt;large pulls instead of mezzing?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep... do this in Charasis a lot.  Though it works better with 2 enchanters,<br/>
maybe 3 if you have them, and at least 2 wizards, more if you can.  In Charasis,<br/>
I think our biggest pull was 18 or so at once... most were lvl 48+ mobs, about<br/>
a quarter were 51+.  A lot of them harm touched, but we used a paladin with<br/>
invuln to do that particular pull.  :)  It&#39;s great, just watching the yellow<br/>
text fly by.<br/>
<br/>
But, on pulls like that, the enchanters will usually what&#39;s hit if anything<br/>
is.. and once you lose one enchanter, things start slipping... you lose the<br/>
other, might as well evac or be sure your will is signed, and start sending<br/>
tells to a necromancer with summon corpse.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I will say, though, I have found that, even though you see a TON of yellow xp<br/>
messages, it still seems to go faster with a group of 6 going through normally<br/>
(not sitting in one spot, but moving through).<br/>
