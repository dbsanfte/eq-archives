&gt; Evo is not really a nessecity, even at level 8.<br/>
&gt; &lt;Snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since the 8th level spell Chaotic Feedback is the upgrade for our 1st level<br/>
&gt; DD spell, and the 12th Level spell Choke is the upgrade to our 4th level DoT<br/>
&gt; spell do you mind telling me how you advanced in level without using them<br/>
&gt; that much?  Is it because you group all the time? I solo alot do to lag<br/>
&gt; issues, which makes me unreliable in groups. This makes things tough, but I<br/>
&gt; find it necessary to be able to rely on my current Rank of spells. This<br/>
&gt; means keeping all the Spell Abilities maxxed as quickly as possible.<br/>
&gt; I already see that Enchanters alternate upgrades to DD and Dot spells every<br/>
&gt; other Rank. That makes for an Interesting combination. I will play around<br/>
&gt; with that tonight.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seriously,  I&#39;m currently level 13 with my Enchanter, and I solo frequently<br/>
(Every morning for about an hour).  I try to group at night, when I have a<br/>
chance to play at night.  Lag and disconnects also give me headaches (I&#39;ve got<br/>
to lower my modem speed)  Anyway, at level 13,  I still use my level 4 DoT.<br/>
The level 12 version burns to much mana, although I&#39;m slowly migrating to it,<br/>
and it will fully replace it when I hit 14.  Since Level 4, I&#39;ve kept to the<br/>
same strategy when soloing.<br/>
<br/>
Pull with Tashen (If mob cons white or is high MR) otherwise I pull with<br/>
enfeeble<br/>
Enfeeble (if not already done)<br/>
Suff. Sphere.<br/>
Back off<br/>
Wait till pet starts getting whacked (takes about 20 seconds)<br/>
Engage mob<br/>
Auto attack<br/>
Stun<br/>
Suff Sphere<br/>
Repeat Stuns when spell cycles<br/>
<br/>
When you hit the part of the battle when you are meleeing and stunning (and<br/>
tanking for your pet) you can throw in your DD spell for practice.  This still<br/>
works for me, and it will turn Young Kodiaks into pussy cats.  A high<br/>
blue/white will cost you about a bubble of mana at level 10.  Truthfully, I am<br/>
nuking a bit more since I hit 12, but the mana cost is pretty trivial at this<br/>
point, and of course my Evo is maxed out.  Another caveat,  this is a very bad<br/>
tactic against Spell Casters, and Poisonous Critters, but thats a topic for<br/>
another E-Mail.<br/>
<br/>
As for group combat,  DD spells are the first to go.  They are quickly replaced<br/>
with Soothe and/or/then mem-blur.   I find mem-blur to be useless solo since<br/>
most of what I attack is KoS to me anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,  feel free to respond with anymore questions or comments,<br/>
because work is slow today.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers</div>
