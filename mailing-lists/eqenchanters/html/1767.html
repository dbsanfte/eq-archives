<div id="ygrps-yiv-601140723">I would recommend asking a dark elf to get it for you.  While it&#39;s true you<br/>
can wait for your dark elf illusion spell and invis yourself to the guards<br/>
you won&#39;t know the way through the maze that is neriak.  The library is in a<br/>
zone called &quot;The 3rd Gate&quot; which is two zones in from the 1st neriak city<br/>
zone.  You probably won&#39;t want to be wandering around in there any longer<br/>
than necessary so trying to find your way won&#39;t be much fun knowing your<br/>
spells could fail at any time.  Many new dark elves ask for help navigating<br/>
through the city.<br/>
<br/>
With the change a while back to allow multiple copies of spells to be<br/>
carried you may find someone to sell it to you.  I&#39;d make a button to<br/>
/auction Buying enchant silver spell and let a savvy businessperson help you<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
good luck to you,<br/>

Hi everyone-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on the list for the last week or so and have found your<br/>
discussions very valuable as a beginning jeweler.  Last night I made level 8<br/>
and would like to obtain the Enchant Silver spell. It is my understanding<br/>
the<br/>
spell is located in the Library in Neriak, a place to which I haven&#39;t been.<br/>
<br/>
My question is: as a high-elf enchanter, am I KOS in Neriak? (I&#39;m betting<br/>
probably so...) If so, what strategies did you use to obtain the spell? I<br/>
have<br/>
not seen anyone in in Greater Faydark selling the spell on the Erollisi Marr<br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
Your comments will be most helpful. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
