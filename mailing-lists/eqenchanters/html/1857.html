<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948343491">You have to have good faction in several places to complete this quest.<br/>
That&#39;s why this is almost considered an enchanter-only quest. At least 2 of<br/>
the components, and the final ending require a certain amount of faction<br/>
with the NPC involved. You willl still get the experience, faction, and cash<br/>
reward (if any) with insufficient faction, but you will not get the<br/>
resulting item. This bit me when I went to get Erud&#39;s Tonic. I didn&#39;t<br/>
realize that my Illusion:Erudite had worn off, therefore I didn&#39;t get the<br/>
tonic when I gave Sinnkin the Innoruk&#39;s Kiss of Death.<br/>
