<b>Subject:</b> ok all.....I just have one request of all of you........ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-163858829">plese stop referring to the Guides as GMs......thre IS a difference and this<br/>
game has tried to keep them VERY seperate.....when you use the term &quot;GM&quot; you<br/>
get alot of ppl confused.....so if its sumoen that youve talked to IN GAME<br/>
most likely its a GUIDE not a GM.......GMs are direct employees of Verant<br/>
and are HARDLY ever in game to help ppl they are in game to adjust things<br/>
and search out bad code to fix it IN GAME.......but thats it.....they<br/>
usually NEVER interact with players so Im pretty sure your referring to the<br/>
GUIDES ....NOT the GMs.....again thnx for the clarification......<br/>
