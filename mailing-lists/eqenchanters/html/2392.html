It&#39;s an extract from the spells.dat file.  GZ has said that there are some<br/>
inaccuracies, and that the game code does some additinal modification of<br/>
the numbers, so don&#39;t trust it too far.  Still, it seems right on in a lot<br/>
of specifics.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I heard in-game that mez is 15 sec, enthrall 30, entrance 45 and dazzle 60.<br/>
&gt; The enchanter spell list on Baelish&#39;s site says mez 30, enthrall 30, <br/>
&gt; entrance 50-60, dazzle 120, which I find more believable. Anybody measure <br/>
&gt; with a stopwatch ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>darkflame says mezmerize is 4 ticks (24 secs), enthrall is 8 ticks (48<br/>
secs), mezmerization is 4 again, entrance is 12 (1 min 12 sec) and dazzle<br/>
16 (1 min 36 sec).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not timed it, but it seems about right, at least for the lower-level<br/>
ones.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, as far as I can tell, this line of spells is fixed duration, i.e, MOB<br/>
&gt; does not get any saving throws to break early like the root line. True ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as I can tell, yes.  It is broken by any damage, of course.  Yes,<br/>
stun breaks mez.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Stun line : Color Flux 3 sec, Color Shift 7 sec, Color Skew 8 sec.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Stun is different.  It&#39;s not a length of spell effect, it&#39;s an instant<br/>
effect of &quot;stun&quot;, with a numeric value.  Flux is 4000, Shift is 6000, Skew<br/>
8000.  The stun effect with our DDs is always value 1.<br/>
<br/>
My theory is that there&#39;s a stun-recovery rate somewhere between 1000 and<br/>
4000 per second, varying per target, perhaps based on target&#39;s STA or<br/>
other stat.<br/>
<br/>
Searching on monster &quot;spells&quot; with effect Stun, it seems Air Elemental<br/>
stun has a value of 3000 + 60*lvl (max 5000), and basilisk&#39;s stone breath<br/>
is 12000 stun points.<br/>
