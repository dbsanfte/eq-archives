<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297170745">I have to throw me two cents in here,   and say  Get used to it. people (not <br/>
all but alot) are morons.... when it comes to enchanters espessialy at your <br/>
level.. when your in Cazic or Paw at mid twenties or even MM is when people <br/>
actually figure out &quot;hey so that&#39;s what enchnaters are good for&quot; i was at <br/>
cazic last night doiong Throne Room and we got spawned on three times while <br/>
doing pulls, total overall there were about 8-9mobs each time and with <br/>
finesse the group fell in love with me... we got exp out the waaazzuuu <br/>
because they woulda had to zone otherwise each time it happend, i cheat to i <br/>
get my CHA up high and use a level 16 spell mezmerization.<br/>
And i always have them go for whatever mob has a pet first just becuase i <br/>
can mem blur the pet afterwards to make it pop.<br/>
   Later when you get higher up you&#39;ll endup being the one who calls the <br/>
shots when multi mobs arrive.<br/>
   Sad thind is that you&#39;ll quit bitchin about why peeps don&#39;t know how to <br/>
use a chanter and start complainin about caster type groups only wanting you <br/>
for clarity (meaning that&#39;s all your good for) when it&#39;s just the oppisite.<br/>
<br/>
  As far as soloing my advise is pets are okay and all if your group needs <br/>
another tank type, but if i were you i&#39;d get your charisma up as high as you <br/>
can.... because when it comes to solo the Charm line of spells is the way to <br/>
go. I can solo stuff easy with that and chase the moon  heh,  i can&#39;t wait <br/>
for level 35 cause i&#39;m gonna play with specs :o). If you wanna solo use your <br/>
charm line of spells  ie charm beguile... blah blah  those wiil help you <br/>
alot. i solo when i can&#39;t find a group all the time useing this spell :o) <br/>
and later on in the game, ie. lvl 40+ enchanter can solo multi mobs with <br/>
only a few spells...... a 46lvl enchanter in my guild solos multi (up to 4 <br/>
from what i&#39;ve seen) useing Charm and Fear line of spells, charms one fears <br/>
the others cept one, lets it hit him then fears it while the other spec goes <br/>
to town....you can also mez the other two roamin specs...<br/>
<br/>
all in all chanters are a pretty nice charater to play but i personnaly <br/>
chose this class because of the group emphasis...<br/>
