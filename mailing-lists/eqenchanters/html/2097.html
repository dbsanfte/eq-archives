<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724376503">Jewelcraft training question:<br/>
I&#39;m thinking you can&#39;t train in a trade skill above skill level 21<br/>
regardless of level.  Here&#39;s some text from &quot;Casters Realm&quot;:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a><br/>
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>
If you start early without much money you will want to max your skill to 21<br/>
at the guild with practise points.  After this you have to make items to<br/>
raise skill.  <br/>
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>
In other words you can&#39;t put any skill points into Jewelcraft after skill<br/>
level 21 even if you have points to spare and money.<br/>
<br/>
Research training questions:<br/>
This is taken from a research info site, &quot;Mythiran Tower&quot;:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mythiran.com/">http://www.mythiran.com/</a><br/>
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>
Q: What&#39;s the deal with research at level 16? It only allowed me to put ONE<br/>
practice into the Research skill when I made level 16! How can I improve<br/>
this skill?<br/>
<br/>
A:Sorry, folks, but at level 16 through level 18 you are only allowed that<br/>
ONE practice. Something to do with that spell circle. But never fear! Once<br/>
you break level 19 you can put 4 or 5 in there (depending upon your magic<br/>
class), then once at 20, the skies the limit...<br/>
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/>
Also, there is a way to practice your research w/o using real components:<br/>

Hi Bahir,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also new to the list, but I might be able to help a bit with the jewlrey<br/>
questions.  More feedback is welcome :)<br/>
<br/>
You can add more points into your Jewlrey Craft skill after the base 21<br/>
points,<br/>
but they&#39;ll cost you.  The skills list will show how much it will cost to<br/>
increase the skill (given you have points to spend on them).  I personally<br/>
prefer to increase my jewlrey skill by practicing making jewlrey instead of<br/>
spending the money on skill points.  That would be the reason I don&#39;t add<br/>
more<br/>
points to jewlrey anymore.  My skill is still low (only at 35), but actually<br/>
making the jewlrey gives for getting the money you put into the skill back,<br/>
instead of spending the money for the points, and not seeing the money<br/>
back..<br/>
Also, as an enchanter, money for making the jewlrey (or anything else for<br/>
that<br/>
matter :)  ) isn&#39;t too hard to come by if you&#39;re patient.  We are the only<br/>
class that can complete the Stein of Mogguk quest easily, and the Stein is<br/>
worth quite a bit of money, (I just sold mine for 250pp).  I&#39;ve run this<br/>
quest<br/>
twice now, and I&#39;m planning on doing it a few more times.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about the research question as I am only level 12 right now,<br/>
but I<br/>
have saved some of my practice points for research.  My question is this:<br/>
Where do I find the pages for the research?  after days of hunting the<br/>
dervishes in North Ro I picked up one page (24 of Tasarin&#39;s left side).  Are<br/>
there any other places I might be able to pick these up quicker?<br/>

&gt; Hello all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am new to the list and have Jeweling questions for you.<br/>
&gt; My questions involves training points.<br/>
&gt; After you spend the max 21 points at the guild and you get to your next<br/>
&gt; level can you put those 5 into your Jewel Craft skill? Can you do this at<br/>
&gt; each level?<br/>
&gt; I realize you may not want to do this or advise it, but is it possible?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What reasons would you give for NOT putting your training points into<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Craft at each level, even if you only put in 1 or 2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, after you reach 16th, how hard is it to do research and advance it?<br/>
&gt; Should I save points for Specialization?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
