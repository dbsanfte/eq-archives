<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112134871">Welp, I been wrong before. I&#39;ve always been atleast as high or higher than<br/>
people with JBoots that I hang with. And at 52, no one can outrun me but a<br/>
bard since soW maxed out at 50 I believe.<br/>

As a shaman, i can say that the Journeyman boots are<br/>
not always slower.  My shaman is 29th and a lvl 50 mag<br/>
with journeyman boots could easily outrun me.  I was<br/>
following him and he had to stop every now and then<br/>
for me to catch up.  I asked him how he was gong so<br/>
fast and he said all he had was journeyman boots.  I<br/>
was not encumbered and it was not a lag thing.  I am<br/>
inclined to think that the sow effect you recieve from<br/>
the journeyman boots is actually based on the level of<br/>
the person wearing them.  i.e. if journeyman had the<br/>
effect of a lvl 9 sow then my 29 shaman would be<br/>
pretty upset that he can&#39;t outrun that mage :)<br/>
<br/>
Just some more info.<br/>
