<b>Subject:</b> My 2 cents on the status of EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024232936">This game has such serious bugs it should never have left beta. My favorite<br/>
issues:<br/>
<br/>
1)Barbarians who can&#39;t see the shield they are equipped with (might we have<br/>
working basic graphics in a graphics game?).<br/>
<br/>
2) Enchanters who get constantly get screwed - remember how long it took<br/>
them to undo the damage they recently did to the Illusion spells? another 2<br/>
months to get merchant/skill code fixed? (Hello, is anyone out there testing<br/>
software before releasing it anymore? the broken illusions would definitely<br/>
have been caught in any test, it was that big a bug.)<br/>
<br/>
3) The inability to swap characters between different servers is stupid,<br/>
hopefully Microsoft learns from that major EQ mistake. (I&#39;d still like to<br/>
play with all my friends and co-workers on the same server, instead of<br/>
spread out over 4 servers, pity EQ doesn&#39;t realize how critical this feature<br/>
is to allot of us - who the hell wants to start over? Hint: we&#39;d pay to get<br/>
our chars moved over Verant.) The correct implementation would have been<br/>
&lt;log-in:choose character:choose server:play&gt; not what it is now. Major brain<br/>
fart here.<br/>
<br/>
4) Lack of GM&#39;s. As an example, there is one GM on the Veeshan server (per<br/>
the Guides, who can do almost nothing), he/she was away this weekend, end<br/>
result no GM available. Basically being understaffed to the point of being<br/>
unstaffed. (You get away with any game mechanics/language/etc. abuses you<br/>
like, no one who can do anything about it is watching -- and good luck<br/>
trying to get a last name once you hit level 20 when there is no GM online<br/>
for days at a time.)<br/>
<br/>
I could go on, but this game really needed a few more months of beta testing<br/>
before releasing. Lets hope that either Verant corrects things quickly or<br/>
that their competition learns from EQ&#39;s impressive list of screw-ups and we<br/>
can move on to something better - and there is definitely massive room for<br/>
improvement.<br/>
