<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070525641">Hey Horchata, enthrall is a good spell, (entrance is better)<br/>
and yes it does have the properties of a memblur, but its not %100.<br/>
I thought they nerfed mesmerize way back level 30 mobs kept attacking after<br/>
i mesd them. Its because the higher level they are above the spell level,<br/>
the more chance they resist the memblur part. Anyway when fighting level<br/>
35-53 mobs<br/>
youll find the mes series doesnt quite wipe the hate list, and will find<br/>
yourself attacked very often. Memblur isnt %100 either but its chance for<br/>
success are much higher. If a mob is in combat how do you wipe its hate if<br/>
it aggros you or a caster? Enthrall may only make it angry with you.<br/>
<br/>
When travelling thru lower guk my spell list was comprised mainly of<br/>
1. Buff (speed, clarity, personal buffs, insight, etc...)<br/>
2. Random slot (Suffocate, Discordant Mind, 2ndary buff slot, charm,<br/>
pillage enchantment, mesmerization, or when fighting very hard battles a<br/>
second mes (enthrall).<br/>
3. Entrance<br/>
4. Tashania<br/>
5. Color Shift<br/>
6. Color Skew<br/>
7. Mem Blur<br/>
8. Tepid Deeds<br/>
<br/>
When soloing non stunnable targets its usually<br/>
<br/>
1. Buff Slot<br/>
2. Discordant Mind or Choke <br/>
3. Entrance<br/>
4. Tashania<br/>
5. Berserker Spirit<br/>
6. Random Slot (Color series if mob is stunnable)<br/>
7. Mem Blur<br/>
8. Tepid/Shiftless Deeds<br/>
<br/>
when in lower guk solo, I usually have no buff slot to make room for both<br/>
Color Shift and Color Skew in case I need to cycle stun a mob. (i.e.<br/>
crusader, priest, cavalier, dar knight, kor wizzie, etc...)<br/>
