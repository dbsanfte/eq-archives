<div id="ygrps-yiv-722719996">I have been hunting in Sebelis some and have some ideas to share on <br/>
charms.<br/>
<br/>
First let me say my tactics are for sure not perfect or to be used in <br/>
all situations but I think they are better than the ones I used when <br/>
I started.<br/>
<br/>
On multi pulls of say 3 to 4 froggies in Sebelis.  I use a Fasination <br/>
right off.  I ask the tanks to attack any that are not mezd or it did <br/>
not stick to.<br/>
<br/>
If more than one is not mezed, often they all are mezed, but <br/>
sometimes one or two resist.  I recast fascination.  Let them start <br/>
to work on the mob fist selected.<br/>
<br/>
Then I try to pick out a non caster type from the remaing mobs (non <br/>
wiz or shammy) and tash him and cast charm on him.  While I wait for <br/>
the fasinatioins to bust I root the mobs not charmed.<br/>
<br/>
Once it is broken I immediately cast dazzle on it or them.<br/>
<br/>
Then I tell my pet to attack the mob they are working on.  If not too <br/>
late i slow it.  But at minium i tash it.  I tash any remaining mobs <br/>
and then med a tad.  Maybe suck some mana from target if he is caster <br/>
type.<br/>
<br/>
Charming the baddie being tanked or one of the ae mezed ones is a <br/>
tactic I recommend on higher lvl baddies.<br/>
<br/>
I find charm is almost an essential tool now.  I am very excited <br/>
about the new charm I will get at 53 and cannot wait)<br/>
