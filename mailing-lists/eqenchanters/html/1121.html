<b>Subject:</b> multiple casting of tashan <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-86394076">First I would like to say I love my enchanter.  Just made 12th and it rocks.  Me and a friend can easily kill red orcs thanks to tashan and whirl.  Im not sure what effect earlier nerfing did, but it appears fixed now.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to my question.  Can you cast tashan multiple times on a mob and have it be additive?  I tried it with a yellow orc, and was able to charm him.  Boy that was cool.  Im just not sure if I&#39;m wasting mana or if hitting a guy twice with tashan is really helpful?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The same question can be applied to choke.  Will 2 castings on the same mob by the same person cause twice the damage?  Or does a second casting just start the damage over again?</div>
