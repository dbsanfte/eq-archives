<div id="ygrps-yiv-812702130">I&#39;m a Dark Elf, with Innoruk as my deity.  It&#39;s definately harder that way. :)<br/>
I still can&#39;t go to Kaladim with any illusions, I need to stay invis all through<br/>
Butcherblock.  I&#39;m ok so far everywhere else I&#39;ve went, I think the only towns I<br/>
haven&#39;t been to with this character are Ak&#39;Anon and Grobb.  I&#39;m planning on<br/>
checking out AkAnon tonight.  I figure since I&#39;m on that side of the world right<br/>
now I&#39;ll grab all the coins of Tash that I can.  Someday I&#39;ll be able to use<br/>
them :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never had Alliance &quot;resisted&quot;, but when I cast on some NPC&#39;s it says I<br/>
cannot see my target even though I&#39;m standing right next to them, and the spell<br/>
doesn&#39;t take hold..  I think I read somewhere that Alliance is a non aggro spell<br/>
as well, so it shouldn&#39;t cause them to attack.  I&#39;ll have to check into that one<br/>
again. :)<br/>

&gt; I never tried the alliance spell when the Ogre was in there, he killed me<br/>
&gt; twice.<br/>

&gt; What race do you play? Are you agnostic?<br/>
&gt; I know that choosing an Evil god will make you KoS to the Ogre even if you<br/>
&gt; have Illusion: Human up since somehow by using &quot;The Force&quot; they can sense<br/>
&gt; the evil in you. Being Agnostic takes care of this problem though.<br/>
&gt; Can Alliance be resisted?  If so, then if cast on an NPC is it considered an<br/>
&gt; attack? This may explain why you &quot;sometimes&quot; may get attacked.<br/>
