<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106692747">I was using a great worn staff for a while for a weapon but recently<br/>
switched back to my giant snake fang cause its faster and I group with<br/>
tanks now who deal the damage.<br/>
<br/>
The damage is 5 and I do from 1-11 or so.<br/>
<br/>
With the great worn staff, the damage is 6 and I think I did a max of 13<br/>
maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Someone was auctioning a fine steel staff and ruined totem staff.  They<br/>
both have a damage of 9 and a delay like<br/>
38 or something.<br/>
<br/>
Does the 9 mean it does 4 more max damage or is there some sort of<br/>
proportion thing with strength factored in?<br/>
Also, is the delay linear meaning a delay of 10 is twice as fast as a delay<br/>
of 20?<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys use as weapons?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
