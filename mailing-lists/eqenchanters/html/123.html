<div id="ygrps-yiv-494402207">We have 3 &quot;books&quot; that I have found, two are actually containers, and they<br/>
are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1&gt; Book of Ancient Restoration - This has two slots for restoring damaged<br/>
pages.<br/>
2&gt; Tome of Endless Enchantments - This is the thing to use for spell<br/>
research. You put in a page (or two for some spells), a parchment and a<br/>
quill and combine.<br/>
3&gt; The End of an Age - this is our &quot;recipe&quot; book. Basically it states that<br/>
we need to assemble the tomes of several members of an ancient circle of<br/>
Keepers of the Craft. Two of which are Tasarian and Velishoul.<br/>

&gt; When I had my level 16 necro, I started some research ( barely<br/>
&gt; really ) and<br/>
&gt; went to the multiple guilds to buy some books. I&#39;ve noticed then that all<br/>
&gt; guild have about 5 volumes for research, except the enchanters<br/>
&gt; who have only<br/>
&gt; 2...or maybe 3..not sure. Do we have less research ability or are our<br/>
&gt; various research books in a lot of various places just like our spells?<br/>
