&gt; cannot see my target even though I&#39;m standing right next to them, and the<br/>
&gt; spell<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t take hold..  I think I read somewhere that Alliance is a non aggro<br/>
&gt; spell<br/>
&gt; as well, so it shouldn&#39;t cause them to attack.  I&#39;ll have to check into that<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; again. :)<br/>

won&#39;t work if you do.  You have to go around or over the counter to cast it.<br/>

I have cast alliance of everything from random monsters (which did nothing) to <br/>
even that Ogre Paladin.  I&#39;ve never been attacked because of it.<br/>
