<div id="ygrps-yiv-646719780">um whatever, be sad about enchanters and know that Verrant seems to not<br/>
care about enchanters but is instead improving other classes.  You will<br/>
see no improvement to the enchanter class and the problems you&#39;ve<br/>
mentioned with spells probably won&#39;t ever be fixed...<br/>
<br/>
Now, to help you understand what I meant in my previous post, take the<br/>
above statement and make all the negative things positive.  I take all<br/>
the complaining about enchanters to be the top statement and my previous<br/>
post to be the opposite, which is characterized by the statement<br/>
below...<br/>
<br/>
be HAPPY about enchanters and know that Verrant seems to CARE about<br/>
enchanters but is instead improving other classes FIRST.  You will see<br/>
improvementS to the enchanter class and the problems you&#39;ve mentioned<br/>
with spells probably WILL be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Now, be positive and let Verrant know how you feel.  Give them<br/>
constructive feedback and let them know you are unhappy.<br/>
