<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-819589140">Orcs in the Rathe Mountain are great to solo at 16. Go in from the ferrott,<br/>
take the first right just inside the zone. There&#39;s a plateau in the middle<br/>
of the open area. One end of the plateau has an orc camp on it with 3 orcs,<br/>
the other hand has a paladin camp. Alliance the paladins, illusion human or<br/>
high elf if you are a dark elf, enthrall one of the orcs (vital to enthrall<br/>
the cleric if there is one, because he will cast on your pet and pull the<br/>
pet), run the other two to the paladins who will kill them. Repeat if need<br/>
be. At 16, I could then keep the camp beat down, plus there&#39;s a gypsy vendor<br/>
by the paladins for when you get loaded down. The orcs drop bronze weapons<br/>
and rawhide armor. Good cash and experience till 17 or 18.<br/>
