<div id="ygrps-yiv-955560734">I think for now I&#39;m going to stay in Guk, or Rathe Mtns.  Both zones are rarely<br/>
crowded, and the lower level mobs that I can kill are rarely camped.  I&#39;m<br/>
getting sick of the crowded zones.  Befallen is OK, but it seemed a bit crowded<br/>
for me.  My only experience with Najena was when I zoned in and ended up in a<br/>
room full of magicians and pets and promptly got killed and almost lost my<br/>
corpse for good.  I do want to go there in a few more levels though.<br/>
<br/>
Question about Soloing:  Now that I&#39;m 16 it&#39;s been very difficult for me to<br/>
solo, even with a pet.  My new level 16 spells use tons of mana, and I end up<br/>
either running out before I kill the mob, or coming very close to it.  Either<br/>
way I end up medding and healing for a long time between kills.  It hardly seems<br/>
efficient.  Any suggestions on soloing at level 16?<br/>

&gt; Gossimer armor can be found in Unrest, rarely in Runnyeye, but 2 good spots<br/>
&gt; to find gossimer are Befallen and Najena. However it isnt as easy as guk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Im glad to see someone appreciates Upper Guk... I loved that place and Lower<br/>
&gt; as well...<br/>
