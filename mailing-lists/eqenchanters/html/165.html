&gt;I love how EVERYONE has opinoins but no one can state a fact<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you have the honesty to say everyone, you certainly arnt<br/>
contributing any.<br/>
<br/>
.....or even<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;calculate anything tangible and informative<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not sure what you mean by this, I&#39;ve heard several people say that they&#39;ve<br/>
had significantly fewer resists after making a character with a higher chr<br/>
than a prior one with a lower chr.  To me, this is far more &#39;tangible and<br/>
informative&#39; than saying that Stratics says something, ergo it must be true.<br/>
<br/>
.........ppl just argur for the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;sake of the arguement I think<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of couse, arguing is fun. =)<br/>
<br/>
......oh well....until Stratics proves to be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;wrong or has falsified information I will continue to read their site and<br/>
&gt;take it to heart<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Firstly, I never even suggested that Stratics falsified information.  I&#39;ve<br/>
talked with eqss people in the chat rooms in beta, and grouped with one<br/>
early in retail.  They&#39;re good, honest people.  However, they are *not*<br/>
perfect.  You want an example of wrong info on the sight?  Okie dokie.  If<br/>
you look under thier class reference chart, you&#39;ll see that barbarians are<br/>
large sized creatures, and it will say that, for example, high elves are<br/>
small/medium.  Now, the thing is, barbarians are capable of wearing medium<br/>
armor too.  The simple fact is, Verant has not released a great deal of the<br/>
&#39;number crunching&#39; information, so I&#39;m likely to at least pay attention to<br/>
someone who comes up with new information rather than dismissing it out of<br/>
hand do to its not being known beforehand.  *All* the information that is<br/>
once stratics was once this way.<br/>
<br/>
......and by the by.......MANY of the authors of EQ are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;directly involved with GMs and what not....just becuase they arent Verant<br/>
&gt;EMPLOYEES dusnt mean they dont have inside information.......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll admit befuddlement as to what you mean when you say &quot;many of the<br/>
authors of EQ are directly involved with EQ...&quot;.  I assume you mean that the<br/>
authors of EQSS or perhaps EQVault there rather than EQ.  I&#39;m quite certain<br/>
that the authors of EQ are involved with the GMs. ;)  However, neing friends<br/>
with the admins of CoN, I can assure you that GMs do *not* give out specific<br/>
number crunching values to anyone.  Seriously, how do you mean that they are<br/>
involved?<br/>
<br/>
