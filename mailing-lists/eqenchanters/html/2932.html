&gt;a server wide raid).  I need somewhere interesting and good for growth to<br/>
&gt;hunt. But with enough people to not spend a long time standing around<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I strongly urge you to fight in dungeons with a group.  Eshew safe , easy<br/>
experience places for the most part. Try to find a regular group that plays<br/>
at the same time you do and hit places that will test and sharpen your crowd<br/>
control skills! You will need these skills  later in life. Mistmore is good<br/>
because its dangerous :) Unrest, Sola, Cazik-Thule and Guk all come to mind<br/>
in the old world.<br/>
