<br><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Does anyone know the best mobs to look for to get Tasarin&#39;s pages 30 and 312 for beserker strength and color shift spells. &nbsp;Since I fail repeatedly at making them, and I see no one auctioning these pages, at this rate I will be level 30 before I have them. &nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">And looking ahead a bit as well, where should I go for the level 24 research pages as well. &nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">I was level 18 when I found out that Jonah and other Lake Rathe mobs give level 16 ones out like candy. &nbsp;Now those pages (for 16) are all I ever see anywhere (I practically throw them away I have so many), but there must be other treasure troves like Jonah for level 20 and 24 spells too (I hope). </font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">My poor (and I mean &#39;broke&#39;) level 21 enchantress has CHA and INT both just over 130. &nbsp;I am working hard on jewelcraft to try to fill in my (bare) ear slots, and wrist slots in particular, but she currently sports damask or leather or cloth underwear. A second question I have is .. at what level can I successfully do Evil Eyes in the gorge (given the above stats, and with a magic resist of 57). &nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">My druid, with a partner druid, has a lot of trouble with them at level 25/26 (magic resist at base 25) but since evil eyes are enchanters, I hoped we might be more successful at earlier levels? </font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;I (my enchanter) often group with a level 21 cleric but I think we might need another tank type to help out (unless my pet can take on that role?) &nbsp;Evil eyes often seem to have both an animation and a mino pet, and they throw blindness, fear, debuffs and charm on us. Can be wild there. Fun but I am going steadily backwards with my druid so far.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Thanks for any help you can give me. I enjoy this list very much. </font>
