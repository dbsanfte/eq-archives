<div id="ygrps-yiv-52793903">after much research and failures, I finally got Mesmerization. I&#39;ve tried to<br/>
use it a couple times last night but it did not seem to work too well. Most<br/>
of the enemies resisted if not all of them. Any comment on this spell? is<br/>
the level 20 color shift better? different?<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve been casting quickness on some tanks in my party and they were<br/>
unable to tell me how good / bad it is...anybody got some feedback on that<br/>
from tanks who pay attention?<br/>
thanks,<br/>
Skara</div>
