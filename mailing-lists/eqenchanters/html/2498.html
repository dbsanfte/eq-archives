There is nothing like the feeling of pure power you get when standing in<br/>
Upper or Lower Guk, the zone to Mistmoore or any other train happy place,<br/>
casting Mesmirization and seeing 16 mobs stop in their tracks.  Ususally the<br/>
other players stand there dumbfounded for several seconds thinking &quot;Woah...&quot;<br/>
before you say &quot;Everyone on the Glyphed.&quot;  You can chain cast Mesmerization<br/>
and keep the whole train stopped until your group has mowed through them<br/>
all.  It&#39;s a defining skill of the Enchanter and it really sucks IMO that<br/>
you can&#39;t do it.<br/>
