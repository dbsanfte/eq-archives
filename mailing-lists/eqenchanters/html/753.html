<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;If you are invisible and wondering if things can see you, /con them.  If<br/>
&gt;it says &quot;Ready to Attack&quot; stay away, it can see you.  If it says &quot;looks<br/>
&gt;at you indifferently&quot; you are OK.  When I right clicked on a vendor to<br/>
&gt;buy/sell my inviso went away and I was surprised!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;duration I&#39;ve heard is either extremly short or very long.  If you wait<br/>
&gt;a moment to see if the spell will wear off before proceeding this is<br/>
&gt;probably safer.<br/>
