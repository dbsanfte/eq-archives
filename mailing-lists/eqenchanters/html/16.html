<b>Subject:</b> Getting The Enchant Silver Spell <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220636594">First, the Enchant Silver spell is located in the Library and NOT the<br/>
guild hall. Most people look in the guild hall and can&#39;t find the spell<br/>
and they get frustrated. I did this myself.<br/>
<br/>
I created a new Dark Elf with HIGH charisma so the spell would be<br/>
cheapest. I traveled to Freeport which is very easy to do. I had a<br/>
friend help me transfer 5 platinum to my newbie dark elf. I then killed<br/>
myself so I would be sent back to Neriak. I then bought the spell and<br/>
ran back to Freeport again. Once again I had my friend help me transfer<br/>
the spell and left over money to my good character.<br/>
<br/>
DO NOT buy more then one spell. I was going to buy a few spells at 4p<br/>
and sell for 8-10p. Sounded good to me as I knew many people that wanted<br/>
the spell.  When I bought the second spell the vendor took my money and<br/>
never gave me the spell. There is a bug so that if you buy a spell you<br/>
already have on your person you don&#39;t get it.<br/>

DIRECTIONS TO FREEPORT <br/>
When you leave the entrance to Neriak stay against the left wall. When<br/>
you come to the water just swim across it. Stay against the left wall<br/>
until you reach the zone. You will then zone into East Commonlands.<br/>
Again, stay against the left wall to the next zone which is Freeport.</div>
