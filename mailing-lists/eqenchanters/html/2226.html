&gt;I would just like to add that the new mes series change rocks!<br/>
&gt;Goodbye mesmerize forever! See, I used to always use enthrall, but I would<br/>
&gt;add mes to my list as a back up in case enthrall was resisted, so i didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have to wait 5 seconds for a recast. I also used both when fighting tough<br/>
&gt;battles such as the Ghoul Lord or King. AE mesmerization is reserved for<br/>
&gt;trains, and weaker mobs. I learned my lesson when I tried to AE mesmerize 5<br/>
&gt;Imp Protectors. With everyone resisting and knocking me dead in a little<br/>
&gt;over 1 round (they were all red to me at the time). Instead, when fighting<br/>
&gt;really tough battle I pick them off 1 at a time, that way if it is resisted<br/>
&gt;I only have to deal with 1 mob attacking me at a time. And with 4 other <br/>
&gt;Imps<br/>
&gt;beating on my party I need to act quickly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So now I have Entrance as my main spell, and Enthrall as a back up, and in <br/>
&gt;1<br/>
&gt;level I will be using Dazzle/Entrance. I can&#39;t wait to use dazzle, because<br/>
&gt;entrance has kept most things entranced for 60+ seconds.<br/>
