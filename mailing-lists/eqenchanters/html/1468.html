<b>Subject:</b> Re: Resistance after patch and what to do <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287872796"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;FYI, they also reduced the damage (to mana) from mana sieve GREATLY! Before<br/>
&gt;the patch, it would totally drain a lvl 39 wizard to out of mana. Now, it<br/>
&gt;takes a total of 4 cast to do the same. Also, the effect would last 3 to 5<br/>
&gt;min. preventing them from meditating in that time. Now they can meditate<br/>
&gt;right off. Once again, these changes were not announced, therefor a bug and<br/>
&gt;if not, it should be changed back to the way it was, or least made stronger<br/>
&gt;than it is after the patch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>actually, that change was announced, in the patch update thing... the<br/>
resistance on the other hand, i will feedback/petition about if it keeps<br/>
happening (on the chance that last night was just a bad night).<br/>
