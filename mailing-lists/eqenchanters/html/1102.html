<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946556957">I have noticed that too since the patch... I think it&#39;s a bug more than<br/>
anything. I does not say the root spell is resisted but the target breaks<br/>
out of it in a second or two.<br/>

Hail<br/>
<br/>
Well I think I&#39;m actually gonna keep my guy with the Quellious god.  Thanks<br/>
for the info about wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question though.  I was on kerra (wisp) isle fighting wisps and I<br/>
was the &#39;rooter&#39;.  The first few, I would root and a few seconds later they<br/>
would be moving.  Then after those first few, when I rooted, it sticked and<br/>
they never moved the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the root spell also not work when I&#39;m trying to get a gnoll that<br/>
is running away in BB but most of the time it does.<br/>
<br/>
Does root have a random duration or something or sometimes doesn&#39;t take<br/>
affect?  <br/>
Has anyone else have these troubles?<br/>
