<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493087470">200p for a stein is a good price.  people will still pay around 250.  The<br/>
trick is to happen to be in the right place at the right time.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
had much luck at times in greater feydark GF trying to sell things and other<br/>
times you happen to meet the right person and trade a bunch of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a stein and are trying to sell it, remember that you can get the<br/>
next stein prepared while you still have the first stein.  You can hold a<br/>
stein, the compendium from Gregor, and items to make the compendium at the<br/>
same time.  So, as soon as you sell the 1st stein you are ready to hit Ogguk<br/>
to make the next one because when you do sell there will probably be 2<br/>
people who want it at the same time of all things.<br/>

Yes it is possible. At 12lvl Last night I completed the Quest for <br/>
the Stine.  Clurg was indiferent to me and did not respond to my <br/>
hails so I held my breath and gave him the book anyway. And lo <br/>
and behold I got a stien.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;gate&gt; back to Freeport.  Appear and try to /auction the stine and <br/>
noone wanted to pay more than 100pp for it. That sounds too low <br/>
for me, so I was wondering if anyone has tried to sell them over <br/>
in Kel. Was thinking that maybe sence Kel was on another <br/>
contonet away from the quest I could get the 200pp for the stine <br/>
that I need.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else sold a stine lately?  is 200pp outragious? anyone <br/>
had luck selling the stine out side of Freeport/Commons?<br/>
<br/>
Keeping everyone up to date.<br/>
