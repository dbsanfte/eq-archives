<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906980644">On thing that hasn&#39;t been said yet, which I find extremely useful.  Is <br/>
to root the MOB that you pet is attacking.  This way, if charm breaks, <br/>
you only have one attacking you instead of two.  Of course, there are <br/>
times that root and charm seem to break right at the same time....<br/>
<br/>
This may be a bit mana intesive, but I&#39;d rather kill one then have to <br/>
mes the other (or mem blur) than have 2 MOBs beating on me for <br/>
extended periods of time.<br/>
