<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025838642">I don&#39;t think it is true. When we camped him a while<br/>
back, once we cleared the room, we hang out on the<br/>
stage and pulled to it from behind, from the entrance<br/>
and sometimes the hallway. He spawned 4 out of first 5<br/>
times, then not for the next 3, then again. So I<br/>
suspect that it is random.<br/>

&gt; on the stage it will<br/>
&gt; cause the Preacher not to spawn, Is this true?  He<br/>
&gt; only spawned twice all<br/>
&gt; day yesterday (and my group was very careful not to<br/>
&gt; walk on the stage.<br/>
&gt; heh).  Any truth in this? :)<br/>
