<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177062285">*Yes, if you are charmed you can Wail other players and kill them, your <br/>
*turned into a NPC basically, Except players dont really regard <br/>
*you as huch <br/>
*of a treat =) UNTIL your hitting them, i&#39;ve seen a guy <br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that a kick? You are running along doing your thing then boom, your<br/>
char is out of your control and all you can do is watch the screen in<br/>

I heard the hag in Unrest loves to charm people, and I know from firsthand<br/>
experience that Meldrath the Malevolent, the master of the mighty minotaur<br/>
mines, loves to charm as well.</div>
