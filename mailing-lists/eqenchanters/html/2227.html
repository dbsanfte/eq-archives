<br/>
I have found myself at level 16, not using my latest most powerful spells.<br/>
It is obvious to me that I can use Mesmerize (shorter casting time, less<br/>
mana) in more situations than Enthrall. I would rather cast 5 Suffocating<br/>
Sphere than 2 Choke (less aggravating, I have found). I didn&#39;t even start<br/>
using Fear regularly until I saw what Chase the Moon could do.<br/>
<br/>
Being in a group it is usually my role to save the poor wizard overburning.<br/>
To halt the fight before an escape. I often need to cast 2 or three spells<br/>
in a hurry just as everything is falling apart. And that is at the end of<br/>
the fight. Not much mana, not much time. Lower level spells are better!<br/>
<br/>
I understand that there are uses for the stronger spells. But in the common<br/>
situation where you are hunting blacks and yellows in a group, numbers are<br/>
usually the main concern. Be it trains, be it bad pulls.<br/>
<br/>
Comments?<br/>
