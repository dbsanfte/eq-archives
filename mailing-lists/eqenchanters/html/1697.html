<b>Subject:</b> RE: about the new enchant items (long rant) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-324992738">Just for the sake of discussion then: Can an enchanter solo without a pet?<br/>
at all levels? and If so, with what tactics? What have you all tested?<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be willing to loose the extremely useful pet series of spells<br/>
until I can figure out how to make up for the loss of the &quot;baby tank&quot; in<br/>
combat. To me it is what makes soloing bearable. Lets face it, while I would<br/>
prefer to be in a group, there are times where it is either solo or don&#39;t<br/>
play.<br/>

&gt;Party pooper, party pooper. Ok you know the song, this time I fill the role<br/>
&gt;:).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; May I point out that the message said that the code was going to be<br/>
&gt;implemented, not that -we- enchanters are going to benefit from it. True,<br/>
&gt;it was stated in the book we could do it, but at no time in B4 it was in<br/>
&gt;effect, and, according to EQE, we received other benefits to make up for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; As I see it, such thing would overbalance us (enchanters) in regard of<br/>
&gt;other pure spell user classes. So either the benefit will be too small to<br/>
&gt;even consider it or too huge and Verant might take out something in return<br/>
&gt;to balance our classe again. Don&#39;t tell me we&#39;re nerfed now. We were, true,<br/>
&gt;but that was sometime ago and from my point of view we are rather balanced<br/>
&gt;regarding other pure spell users. To sum up we have our &quot;niche&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, the idea is: By talking here, and offering Verant options to consider<br/>
&gt;we may have a say in the matter and make our class fuller in the way -we-<br/>
&gt;see it. What I would like to see discussed here is : What can we give up to<br/>
&gt;have a &#39;proper&#39; enchantment line of spells?. Or are we just to receive this<br/>
&gt;new ability/spell/line of spells without giving up anything?.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As stated above, I dont think we can&#39;t expect a &#39;useful&#39; line of<br/>
&gt;enchantment&#39;s spells unless we give up something in exchange. Thinking back<br/>
&gt;of Beta, there was a line of spells we didn&#39;t have but nonetheless still<br/>
&gt;managed to survive and prosper : Pet line of spells. Plus they don&#39;t fit<br/>
&gt;enchanters very well . On the other hand, this line form the very core of<br/>
&gt;most of our solo strategies so losing it wouldn&#39;t be a small thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is just an example, a topic&#39;s starter. Feel free to agree, disagree<br/>
&gt;or tell me to shut up. Once again my aim to to talk things out here first<br/>
&gt;and offer something (petition/ EQE/ you name it) constructive to Verant<br/>
&gt;before we see something not implemented or half implemented in place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would be hapy to lose our pets.<br/>
I went up to 9th level before seriously using a pet.<br/>
Give us spells so we are wanted in a group even at low levels so that we can<br/>
always find a group and I&#39;ll happily give up my pet for good.  Even take<br/>
charm if ya like.<br/>
However Enchantments I see as a form of trade skill and people will want you<br/>
to create tehm for them at little or no cost but tehn when it comes to<br/>
partying ask waht you can do in a fight.<br/>
That are give you a pity spot in the party to keep those temp enchantments<br/>
coming.  I dont see Enchantments having such a huge effect on our class no<br/>
matter what form they take.<br/>
