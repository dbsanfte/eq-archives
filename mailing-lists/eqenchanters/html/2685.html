<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670896605">Not knowing who to ask, and you people seem so nice, can someone help me<br/>
with  problem i am having.  I will be getting married soon, and we want to<br/>
have the wedding in the Erudin Palace.  My problem is that an Ogre friend of<br/>
mine swears he will be KOS there.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if this is true, or if there are other races that r KOS<br/>
there?  Or of a better place to hold a wedding with a very diverse group?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this isn&#39;t the best board to post this on, so forgive me )<br/>
