&lt;&lt; Yes I have learned for a long time that as enchanters we don&#39;t need root.<br/>
 Mes is the way to go. It&#39;s faster, more reliant, and lasts longer. If a mob<br/>
 is running for friends, mes will stop em dead in their tracks. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I use root regularly if I am in a group with no druids or rangers.  In <br/>
dungeons in particular I when you don&#39;t want any runners I keep it up in case <br/>
they run and even cast on them when they&#39;re about half down on health to keep <br/>
them from running.  I have a warrior friend that I hunt with sometimes and <br/>
when it&#39;s just the two of us it&#39;s definitly handy.  <br/>
<br/>
I think all spells have their uses depending on the makeup of your group : ) <br/>
