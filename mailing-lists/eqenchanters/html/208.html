<div id="ygrps-yiv-445937983">First, I have a level 10 Enchanter, so I&#39;m still using the lvl 8<br/>
spells...<br/>
<br/>
For fighting Solo, I always use a pet.  Even if it sucks up 1/4 to 1/3<br/>
of the XP, it&#39;s still better than dying.  Plus, mana regenerates faster<br/>
then HP...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that for me, at least, root doesn&#39;t last long enough to use<br/>
it as the first spell.  I tend to start with a Suffocating Sphere, for<br/>
the DOT effect, and then enfeeble, then Chaotic Feedback, and then<br/>
Root.  Then wait a bit, and then Chaotic feedback again.<br/>
<br/>
`Course, all that&#39;s only if I&#39;m fighting something REALLY big, a yellow<br/>
or so.  I&#39;ll beat up on Decaying Skeletons and Skeletons all day, just<br/>
me and my pet, no magic needed.<br/>

&gt; I was curious what strategies everyone is using when fighting solo?  I<br/>
&gt; tend to Root them, cast Chaotic Feedback, meditate (heh), cast Chaotic<br/>
&gt; Feedback and repeat until out of mana. After this I hope their dead or<br/>
&gt; almost dead. If not I run like heck!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I like grouping as much as possible, but the people I&#39;ve been grouping<br/>
&gt; with lately just don&#39;t seem to get it.  They want to fight Tombstone<br/>
&gt; creatures when everyone is half healed and low on mana. They also don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; let me bring out one creature at a time for the group to wallop. Instead<br/>
&gt; they jump all 4-5 Orcs at a camp, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got tired of dying so I have been playing solo some more.<br/>
