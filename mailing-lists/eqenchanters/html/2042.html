<div id="ygrps-yiv-242576127">Howdy folks!<br/>
<br/>
Welp, I feel I too must speak out about this recent change of Enchanters<br/>
not being able to cast charm or fear against a player. First let me say, I<br/>
disagree that it makes Enchanters useless in PvP now weather solo, or<br/>
grouped. First off, in a PvP fight, I&#39;d prefer having my pet vs. being able<br/>
to charm the other player. Now fear itself will be missed but it is still<br/>
mostly possible to win a PvP fight playing an Enchanter.<br/>
Now lets get down and dirty as to what and why this change came about. I am<br/>
sure most of you know that have good PvP experience, fearing another player<br/>
can very easily be used to exploit. Now that they have removed fear, and<br/>
charm from PvP, here&#39;s what was happening. Lets say a level 30 Enchanter<br/>
cast fear on a level 30 Magician, the player would run uncontrollably in<br/>
fear right? Well yes, but also that PC would in a sense become an NPC for<br/>
the duration the fear spell is in effect, thus allowing ANY player to cast<br/>
upon them, say 2 or 3 lvl 50&#39;s waiting in the wings for fear to go off. Now<br/>
let us also keep in mind, doing this to a player is cheating, but good ole&#39;<br/>
Veriant couldn&#39;t do anything about it unless they saw the player cast fear<br/>
so his friends could attack as well (God know&#39;s even if everyone in the<br/>
world thinks your a rat, Veriant has to see you being one themselves b4<br/>
they&#39;ll do a single thing). Also, keep in mind, it is policy that Veriant<br/>
give a player the 5 strike rule. Meaning you get 3 verbal warnings, on your<br/>
4th, you are suspended for using an exploit such as this for oh, say maybe<br/>
a week. Then the 5th warning your gone forever by them banning you. I must<br/>
say this is a complete joke first off. For it takes an act of God himself<br/>
to SEE everyone using this exploit because ppl would not do it over and<br/>
over knowing the other player petitioned and a GM MIGHT be watching this<br/>
time. Also, for you ppl who have programming experience, just consider how<br/>
much of a nightmare this bug is to fix (thus is why it&#39;s been around<br/>
forever, just not many ppl knew about it to begin with). Also on that note,<br/>
keep in mind, I&#39;ve herd about players having 5+ warnings and Veriant not<br/>
doing a thing with them. It seems GM&#39;s are giving ppl warning without<br/>
actually telling them they are getting one (oh ya this is a major surprise).<br/>
The bug with charm in PvP is this, well this is one problem they also had<br/>
an almost impossible time resolving so they just removed it. Lets say the<br/>
same lvl 30 Enchanter attacks a lvl 26 Magician (heh yes Im just picking on<br/>
Magicians this morn), all is fine right? The Enchanter is within the 4<br/>
level limit and no problems right? Well the Enchanter charms the Magician,<br/>
making the Magician a pet, yet not an NPC. BUT what it does do is make the<br/>
Magician a lvl 30 pet, allowing the 3 level 34 wizards waiting in the wings<br/>
to attack the Magician. This is much more complicated than the fear bug,<br/>
and just as hard to resolve. Again I am sure there were other reason as<br/>
well, but the bottom line is Veriant didn&#39;t see a clear path in fixing<br/>
this, so they just removed it from the game. In my view  that is totally<br/>
lame and completely unacceptable. Frankly I can live without either in PvP<br/>
and always have, but the point is here they are removing abilities in the<br/>
game just due to the fact it&#39;s easier to remove it than to fix it. Ya ya<br/>
ya, chances are in a year or so they&#39;ll fix it and give the two abilities<br/>
back to us, but that just proves my point even more.<br/>
Now dont get me wrong, I love Everquest and PvP. The reason for my post is<br/>
just to public ally say that I find Veriants decision on this dead wrong<br/>
and should be resolved in a different way than cutting abilities due to<br/>
mangled code they have to deal with. It&#39;s like they are saying, sorry I am<br/>
too lazy to properly address this, so I&#39;ll just cut out one of your prime<br/>
abilities instead (again, although I personally didn&#39;t depend on this<br/>
myself). Do however keep in mind that we are NOT usless now due to this<br/>
change, for personally I never used fear or charm to fight in PvP, it just<br/>
seemed a waste of time while you could be doing damage, or mes&#39;n then<br/>
draining there mana.<br/>
I would like to ask each and everyone of you to protest this change and ask<br/>
Veriant to fix the real problem so we have our intended abilities to do<br/>
battle with. There are some things that are just unacceptable that they do,<br/>
and I believe this path is one of them. Let them know you are against this<br/>
and want our abilities back!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
