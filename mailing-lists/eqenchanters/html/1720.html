<div id="ygrps-yiv-298711479">This is debateable, but the effect is anywhere between 5 seconds and 5 minutes (I&#39;ve had it seem to last a while).  It casts very fast like tashan, but its recast rate is terribly slow.  I suppose this is to compensate for the extremely low mana usage of it... were it fast recasting, we could sit in a fight and keep the MOb stunned steadily while our friends beat it silly.  It has saved my life several times.<br/>

  How long does this spell&#39;s effect last, and how long does it take to cast/recast? </span></blockquote></div>
