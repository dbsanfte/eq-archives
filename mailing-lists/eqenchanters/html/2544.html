<div id="ygrps-yiv-782439592">Heh, i disagree... unrest could be handled by 12-18 players  who are working <br/>
together, all in the mid 20&#39;s (except possibly the ghost room). The key is <br/>
to know when you are gonna aggro other rooms, and split the spawns amongst <br/>
multiple parties. I would suggest a minimum of 2 enchanters for this, as <br/>
sometimes the pulls will get large. Good monk pullers are critical also(2 as <br/>
well, very well buffed), and at least 3 or 4 clerics. Once inside the house <br/>
just make sure to keep the trouble areas clear (in front of the magi room, <br/>
outside the hand room, and the bar/tower). It would be impossible to hold <br/>
all 4 of the major loot spawns on the second floor at once, but two could be <br/>
held at any given time. holding the pit/bloodpool would be very easy as <br/>
well, i have not quite gotten into the ghost room but i suspect it could be <br/>
done by people in that level range.<br/>

&gt;Unrest is quite fine, but it depends on the time of day you play. The zone<br/>
&gt;needs 30+ people in it to be playable, with a group in the ghoul magi room.<br/>
&gt;That room is the key to Unrest, as pulling down the back stairs will <br/>
&gt;usually<br/>
&gt;agro that room. It&#39;s also best to have a group in the tower and the bar if<br/>
&gt;one is to be camped as the other room will agro through the floor/ceiling.<br/>
&gt;Bats, the reanimated hand and a few things by the ghost room will see<br/>
&gt;through invis to undead, otherwise it&#39;s a necessary spell for moving around<br/>
&gt;in the house. Outside of primetime I never see enough people in there to<br/>
&gt;make it worthwhile, and in primetime it&#39;s camped.  If you don&#39;t mind the<br/>
&gt;faction hits (who needs to go to Surefall or Karana druid rings anyway :p),<br/>
&gt;or waiting for a spot to open up,  the treants in South Karana are cash and<br/>
&gt;experience city, just keep the level 30 and 31&#39;s outta your group. A bubble<br/>
&gt;of experience and 30pp an hour is minimum I ever made there (alot more with<br/>
&gt;just 4 level 24 casters). Last summer Cazic was quite fine to level in, but<br/>
&gt;now all I see in there are trains (all the fools from CB who never learned<br/>
&gt;to not make trains I think have gone to CT now). Was used to only seeing <br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt;train there an hour, last time I was there saw em every 5 or 10 minutes<br/>
&gt;(about what Unrest been averaging too). I went to High Keep at 29 then<br/>
&gt;(never been there before and my guildmates recommended at) and hit 30 in 5<br/>
&gt;hours in the warrior room. Walk in, give the working with an enchanter 101<br/>
&gt;speech, start splitting the spawn, start yelling at groupmates not to <br/>
&gt;attack<br/>
&gt;mezzed mobs (taunt them please until they attack like I said 3 times), <br/>
&gt;split<br/>
&gt;the spawn nice and wide, relax and make experience.<br/>
