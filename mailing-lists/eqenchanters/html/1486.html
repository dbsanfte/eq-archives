<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842466412">cancel magic is an offensive spell, not defensive.  So many people mistake <br/>
the use of this spell.  Imagine being in a duel with a cleric.  I bet hes <br/>
surprised when you cancel magic his +400 hp buffs away.  same for npcs your <br/>
fighitng, use cancel magic on the spells that are helping them.  It&#39;s an <br/>
offensive spell, and was designed that way.<br/>
