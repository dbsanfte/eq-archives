<div id="ygrps-yiv-648068981">Yes, those prices are a bit on the low side. As I stated in a previous post,<br/>
sell the items for what they are worth, not what it costs to make them. I<br/>
have seen flesh bands, which are loot-only items that give +2 to strength,<br/>
sell regularly for 15-20p. That would be stretching it for the rings we<br/>
could make, but I would suggest a minimum of 7p for the items that add 2 to<br/>
stats.<br/>

		I&#39;ve noticed that latency and packet loss will tremendously<br/>
effect<br/>
	my success/fail rate...so watch your meter...if it&#39;s over 600, don&#39;t<br/>
	bother....<br/>

		btw, I made several pieces of jewelry last night..my first<br/>
magical<br/>
	items yet....and sold the bloodstone, Lapis, carnelian for 3pp<br/>
each...and<br/>
	the Amber ones for 4pp....am I selling too low?  I still had to work<br/>
at<br/>
	finding buyers...so my guess is that I was right on target...taking<br/>
a small<br/>
	markup above the cost of materials...since the added bonus to stats<br/>
was only<br/>
	2 or 3...</div>
