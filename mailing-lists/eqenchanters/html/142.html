<div id="ygrps-yiv-204279249">Hi, thanks for the post about Jewelcraft.  Do you have anything you<br/>
might like to add for my page on jewelcraft?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
if you have prices, where you find materials, etc. I would be very<br/>
interested in adding that info.  I haven&#39;t had a chance to look on other<br/>
sites etc. to consolidate info yet which I&#39;ll do pretty soon.  I&#39;d like<br/>
to have merchant locations in the various cities, good places to find<br/>
gems in loot, etc.  And of course skill levels, fails/successes for<br/>
various components.  If you look at the page you&#39;ll see the info I&#39;ve<br/>
been collecting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

As for Jewelcraft, here&#39;s what I know<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stone			Silver				Electrum<br/>
Skill<br/>
Jade			+5 mana ring			?<br/>
30+<br/>
malieche(?)		non-magical			+2 sv posion<br/>
bracers		35+<br/>
Lapis Lazuli		non-magical			+2 sv disease<br/>
earings	41+<br/>
<br/>
Do note, the listed skill is not the bottom requirement, it&#39;s what I had<br/>
when I first tried making the item, so it may be possible to craft them<br/>
with lower skill, but not by much Im sure. <br/>
I am currently 49 skill and am working up my bank to get back to it.<br/>
I&#39;ll<br/>
post more when I have the info.<br/>
