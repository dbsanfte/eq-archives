<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830578275">quick FYI:<br/>
<br/>
I spend hours in Upper Guk over the weekend trying to get this woven armor (I may not be fighting the<br/>
right stuff).  I finally got a pair of sleeves.  The sleeves did not show up on my character if I took<br/>
my robe off.  I am going to stay down there for a while (GREAT exp!) and see if I can get a full set.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s going to show up, but it&#39;s decent armor anyways.<br/>

&gt; Are we talking CHEST items here?  If so, I am THERE baby....<br/>
&gt; I have lots of leather and plate look stuff but if I take my robe off I&#39;ve still got that mini dark<br/>
&gt; elf red bikini top... grrrr<br/>

&gt; Any armor equipable by your true race will show up on another race you have<br/>
&gt; taken the form of. Only problem is that you are a caster, and cant wear<br/>
&gt; much other than cloth or magical armor. Only think I can think of that will<br/>
&gt; give you a nice armored look is Woven armor, and the ribcage armor from the<br/>
&gt; Goblin Alchemist in Misty Thicket. Both appear as leather on your character.<br/>
