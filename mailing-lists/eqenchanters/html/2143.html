I just posted a message in response to someone else on that one, hopefully<br/>
you&#39;ve received it by now.<br/>

I can&#39;t think of a reason NOT to use your animation while soloing (or a<br/>
charmed pet).  You can still attack the mob and increase your skills while<br/>
saving you from too much down time.  Why die when you don&#39;t have to?<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, when you get up in level and things start hitting for 50+<br/>
twice a round, you won&#39;t be able to take damage of even a green /con much<br/>
less something that will give you experience.  Your life at level 20 and up<br/>
changes dramatically.  While it is still possible to solo, it is definately<br/>
more difficult... the down time is just too long.  Now I almost always try<br/>
to get a &quot;real pet&quot; (a PC fighter type) and I use charm when needed (on over<br/>
pulls).<br/>
<br/>
With a good party Charm is the best.  Lets say the puller mistakenly gets<br/>
three critters.  I Mes/Enthral the furthest away, Tashani and Charm the one<br/>
not engaged by the rest of the party, send the charmed pet against the<br/>
engaged critter, sit and med while waiting for either the charm to break or<br/>
the enthralled critter to wake up.  Usually the engaged critter doesn&#39;t last<br/>
long so I send the charmed pet to the enthralled one.  Makes a diffucult<br/>
pull really easy.  We are the life of the party :)<br/>
