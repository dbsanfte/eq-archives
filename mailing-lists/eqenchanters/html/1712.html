<div id="ygrps-yiv-311978187">I have been told that you can also get them in High Hold which is a little<br/>
closer than Felwithe.  I haven&#39;t been there so I don&#39;t know for sure, but I<br/>
was told they are on the person standing next to they guy that sells our<br/>
animation spells.  Hope that helps.<br/>
