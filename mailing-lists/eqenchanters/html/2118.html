<div id="ygrps-yiv-89463935">RE: [eqenchanters] Stein Quest&gt; Every time I did it I gave all the<br/>
ingredients to him at once. As a high elf, I never had a problem with the<br/>
ogre, who actually cons better to me than the barkeep does. Aren&#39;t factions<br/>
screwy things?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because he is an ogre outcast.  He was hated in Oggok and shunned,<br/>
because he was too smart.  The barbarian saved him from Guk when he was<br/>
young, though, and they have been friends since.  He is not quite a typical<br/>
ogre.  I&#39;m not sure exactly what faction he is, but he hates Enchanters in<br/>
Ogre form.  : )  And DE form.<br/>
