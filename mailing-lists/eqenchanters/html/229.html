<div id="ygrps-yiv-318272843">I&#39;d just like to say that &quot;somewhere online,&quot; too long ago for me too<br/>
remember, I read that because an enchanter&#39;s type of magic is primarily<br/>
one that affects the targets &#39;perception&#39; of things that charisma did<br/>
play a part in the effectiveness of it. Thinking about it now, that<br/>
doesn&#39;t really seem to hold water, but without hearing otherwise it<br/>
seemed to make sense.<br/>
