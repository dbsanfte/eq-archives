&gt; Does anybody know where I can find Woven Armour?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can these Items only be obtained by looting or is there a Merchant<br/>
&gt; that sells them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t seem to find them anywhere on Faydwer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in Advance<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They are carried by Froglocks in Guk.  I purchased mine in Innothule<br/>
by standing at the zone entrance and auctioning.  If you are a good<br/>
race, Innothule is still fairly safe - there are no guards between the<br/>
zone and Guk.  I bought a tunic and 3 smaller pieces for 10pp.  Don&#39;t<br/>
know if that is a good price or not, but that&#39;s what it was going for<br/>
when I went.<br/>
