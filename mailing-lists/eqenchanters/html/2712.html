fact) killing goblins and sarnaks in Warsliks, Overthere, and Lake of Ill<br/>
Omen.  Goblins give Firona Vie and Legion of Cabilis, Sarnaks give me ONLY<br/>
Cabilis faction.  This may vary in other zones however, or there may be<br/>
some limit at work where I can&#39;t get any more FV faction from Sarnaks.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re just after faction to get to dubious with the troopers, a good<br/>
place is the newbie area in Warsliks Woods (SE part of zone).  lots of<br/>
goblin whelps, scouts, and watchers - just run around taking a whack at<br/>
each and letting your pet finish the job.<br/>

&gt; Any ball-park figure on how MANY kills are needed?  I&#39;d really like<br/>

It took about 250 (wild guess) to get to dubious with the Troopers.  <br/>
Since then I&#39;ve killed another hundred fifty or so goblins and sarnaks,<br/>
turned in 2.5 backpacks full of bone chips and over a hundred watcher<br/>
torches.  I&#39;m now amiable to the troopers, dubious to at least some<br/>
vendors, and still ready to attack by the crusaders.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard third-hand reports of people turning in 1500 and 2000 bone<br/>
chips before being non-KOS to the crusaders.  This isn&#39;t too surprising,<br/>
as it&#39;s a 4-at-a-time &quot;quest&quot;, so that&#39;s only 500 points of faction.<br/>
