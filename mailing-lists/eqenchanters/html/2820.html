<b>Subject:</b> Items for sale / Trade on Fennin <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269767744">I am retiring my DE Cleric as I have lost intrest in him. If you need <br/>
equip for a Cleric, or know someone that does.....<br/>
<br/>
On Fennin Ro I have a Complete set of Small Bronze Armor (minus <br/>
neck piece) which is the best plate next to quest armor, Shining Star <br/>
of Light (CLR/PAL only), and Cleric Temple Quest Vambraces, Boots, <br/>
and Greaves.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking to trade for Pure caster Robes (FBR or better) and Int <br/>
Gear (Stein of Moggok, etc), Enchanter Temple Quest items, Charisma <br/>
gear (Crude Stein, player made bracelets, etc.), Jagged Bands, <br/>
Adamantite Bands, Moonstone Rings, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to post to the board, send me an email directly, <br/>
and we can see if we can get a deal made. I will have a complete <br/>
list after tonight of what I have for sale. <br/>
