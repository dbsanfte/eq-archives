&gt;In response to jeweling, you have to practice it to make it go up. This is <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;long, tedious, and expensive process. I made some money back on electrum<br/>
&gt;jade, but not enough to cover my losses. By the time I could do Gold, I was<br/>
&gt;able to make back some of the 1000+p that I lost raising Jewelcraft. But<br/>
&gt;once I hit level 35 and started working in plat, it was over. I made all my<br/>
&gt;cash back, and I have plenty of money to spend buying items for myself and<br/>
&gt;all my friends. I have spent thousands on other people, and thousands on<br/>
&gt;myself, and I still have thousands in the bank, and I don&#39;t peddle that<br/>
&gt;much, I let people come to me. And Ive been stuck at skill 191 for months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Most of the skill points of an Enchanter should be saved for Research. You<br/>
&gt;can practice like 1 per level from 16-19, and then 5 per level for every<br/>
&gt;level 20 and above. If you plan on raising this skill from practice alone<br/>
&gt;good luck. Some of those spell pages are really hard to come by. Chances <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;you will not find pages for your spell level until you are a few levels<br/>
&gt;higher, or perhaps even the next spell rank. The pages for a level 16 spell<br/>
&gt;are found on level 16-19 mobs. So if you just turned 16, unless you are<br/>
&gt;fighting whites, yellows, or reds, you will not find your pages. Currently <br/>
&gt;i<br/>
&gt;am still seeking level 44 pages, but there are few level 44 mobs in the<br/>
&gt;game. I have still never seen a 49 research page, but considering the<br/>
&gt;relatively few 49+ mobs Ive killed thats understandable. Will have to get <br/>
&gt;49<br/>
&gt;pages from the planes. (it is possible for a guk wizard, or a guk knight to<br/>
&gt;have one, as they get up to 50 i believe.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have spent many practice points into research, and I plan on spending my<br/>
&gt;max 5 per level if i have to. Theres no way Im gonna get spell components <br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;a 49 spell and risk losing it. I have heard there is a practice book you <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;use with ordinary components, but that was broken the last time I tried.<br/>
&gt;Although it may be well worth looking into. I may go back there myself and<br/>
&gt;see if I can get my skill up.<br/>
