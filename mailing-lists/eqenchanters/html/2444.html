<div id="ygrps-yiv-946844270">Are there large differences in the charisma of some posters here?  I think<br/>
that would affect the chances of two people using the same spells having<br/>
different results?<br/>

Enthrall is not a guaranteed memory blur, it has a chance of doing so.<br/>
Fighting in the warrior room in HighKeep at level 30 against yellow to red<br/>
/con goblin warriors, the memory blur aspect seems to almost not exist.<br/>
Enthrall is crowd control (we don&#39;t want to fight you now, take a number,<br/>
we&#39;ll be right with you) and Memory Blur is, in this situation, combat<br/>
control (forget that the cleric just healed that tank for 600 health and go<br/>
back to swinging at the tank, will you?). In the spell descriptions at<br/>
EQ.castersrealm.com, the Mezmorize line is mentioned as having a good chance<br/>
of wiping the hate list only if you are outside the MOB&#39;s agresso range when<br/>
the spell wears off.  Enthrall when resisted will also put you at or near<br/>
the top of the MOB&#39;s hate list, while an inneffective Memory Blur doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to have this taunt factor. At 37, you are using Entrance over Enthrall,<br/>
right? And if not, what have you encountered that makes the difference?<br/>
