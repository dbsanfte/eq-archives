<div id="ygrps-yiv-857134649">well I dont know if this is true or not but I have heard ALOT of rumor that<br/>
trade skills CAN be CHARACTER specific.....in otherwords the game randomly<br/>
chooses your actual SKILL OVER ALL in that trade when you start......just<br/>
like in RL sum ppl are just NATURALLY good at making things and sum JUST<br/>
ARENT!!!......I have heard that this is a factor in the game ......so you<br/>
might just be one of the lucky ones that found the trade that is PERFECT for<br/>
you.......I WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR LUCK!!!!&gt;......keep at it.....and<br/>
hell try harder stones......maybe you can make other stuff with your<br/>
luck......<br/>
