<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486643318">I wouldn&#39;t recommend doing Hateplane with less than 200 CHA, and usually I<br/>
do Fearplane with 200, but it is not quite as important there as everything<br/>
resists a lot less.<br/>
<br/>
Hate has some nasty trains, I remember getting a Spite and 4 clerics of<br/>
Innoruuk on a pull. We were able to ice the 4 clerics until the spite went<br/>
down, then picked the clerics off one by one, and those things are very<br/>
difficult to get mes to stick. Weve also pulled a train of 8 mobs in Hate<br/>
that we successfully defeated, 200 Charisma is the best gun you can have up<br/>
there.<br/>
I know many guilds on our server that would have called evac but we&#39;re<br/>
usually up for a good challenge. <br/>
<br/>
Items can usually get your int/cha pretty high. I am working now with<br/>
204cha/176int, but with a few items Ill be able to get over 200/200.<br/>
(adorning grace adds +40 to cha)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Being Level 50, i need to ask you a question...I am level 41, and have been<br/>
&gt;working on getting my INT up, not my CHA.<br/>
&gt;my int is 189, and my cha is 135 with buff.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I hear for the Planes you really need a high CHA, can you comment on this<br/>
&gt;Maelael?<br/>
