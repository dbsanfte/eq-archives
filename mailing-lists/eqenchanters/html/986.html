<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492929917">1. I know what alliance does, You are using it wrong,<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you now it&#39;s not broken, someone starting a<br/>
rumor that it&#39;s supposed to lower prices... wrong.<br/>
Try and Experiement (Illus maybe?). ;-)<br/>
Ok All the illusions i get IE Half elf dark elf etc...<br/>
Are VERY Useful, If going on a journey and you run out<br/>
of food or need a quest item. And no one can get it in<br/>
your group because of gaurds kos. Poof your the race.<br/>
Even to get supplies. Also to sell things.<br/>
Anyway The minor illusion i do now agree that they<br/>
screwed it up because now it&#39;s worthless (Unless in<br/>
pvp server to jump human)<br/>
Now it&#39;s just something we can&#39;t use monsters can see<br/>
you even with minor illusion on.<br/>
We were never meant to do major damage. I do agree<br/>
though the spell they should make more effective<br/>
Atleast is the Tashan type spells, So after the spell<br/>
cast we can fight things even harder than we can<br/>
handle. Enchanter should beable to make it possible<br/>
for a group of level 5&#39;s to kill something VERY red to<br/>
them instead of their spells getting resisted the<br/>
whole time. <br/>
Anyway i&#39;m blabbering too much.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Maybe someone else has already posted this view on<br/>
&gt; the group, in that case<br/>
&gt; forgive me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - We all take for granted Enchanters aren&#39;t the<br/>
&gt; blitz kind of mage. <br/>
&gt; - Use of spells slots is already a bother by level<br/>
&gt; 8. Either one has combat<br/>
&gt; related spells or buff/protect spells (can&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; both).<br/>
&gt; - In a 6 men team, after rebuffing everyone in need,<br/>
&gt; Im close to 0 mana<br/>
&gt; thus has to make the other wait. This one is irksome<br/>
&gt; as enchant are<br/>
&gt; &quot;supposed&quot; to be the support kind.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Some spells are of little interest. eg &quot;enchant<br/>
&gt; silver&quot;, as the game grow<br/>
&gt; older, magic items are more common and ours are not<br/>
&gt; different from the one<br/>
&gt; in play. Another &quot;niche&quot; we can&#39;t fill anymore. This<br/>
&gt; class has, and still<br/>
&gt; have, the ability to be &quot;different&quot;. All it needs<br/>
&gt; are better focus. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	So the general feeling here is we are not only fair<br/>
&gt; on fields we are<br/>
&gt; supposed not to shine in, but also in the one we are<br/>
&gt; supposed to. That we<br/>
&gt; are just a low level magician.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Still sitting in/strinking whatever , will most<br/>
&gt; likely end up we look like<br/>
&gt; whiners.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	So, I agree with a well thought letter more than<br/>
&gt; some action online. Both<br/>
&gt; can be done assuredly. But we also should add some<br/>
&gt; ideas on this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	For my part :<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Get rid of pets!. We all use pets solo, but why<br/>
&gt; would an enchant had one<br/>
&gt; in the first place?. Pets are magician/necro thingy.<br/>
&gt; I liked it better<br/>
&gt; without. We  can have various form of charm instead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Add/increase/lower the cost of buff/debuff<br/>
&gt; instead. We were supposed to<br/>
&gt; be able to fight if and only we wanted to.<br/>
&gt; Mez/memory blur/enfeeble were<br/>
&gt; supposed to be or main dish. Recent changes are not<br/>
&gt; in the proper direction. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Fix the spells. Has anyone ever see chaos feedback<br/>
&gt; stun a mob?. Or<br/>
&gt; alliance lower the vendor&#39;s price even by 1cp?.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Make some physical enchantments!!. Its in the<br/>
&gt; rules after all:).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, this is a rough and needs polishing<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --------------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt;All of this has nothing to do with powergaming<br/>
&gt; level mongering.  Add in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;fact we need to be agnostic or illusions are<br/>
&gt; worthless, stupid quirks with<br/>
&gt; &gt;minor illusions, and the utter complete lack of any<br/>
&gt; viable enchanting, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;you discover why people are quitting the class in<br/>
&gt; droves.  I&#39;m glad you like<br/>
&gt; &gt;it, but most of us are not into such masochism.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; -------------------------------<br/>
&gt; 	Sorry about that but minor illus is a great spell.<br/>
&gt; EG: You fight a kodi in<br/>
&gt; WC on your own. Taking the beast taxes almost all<br/>
&gt; your mana, would you like<br/>
&gt; to use sentinel in case a Hill G comes by. No way,<br/>
&gt; minor illus and presto a<br/>
&gt; chair meditates in the wild. No one ever botherd a<br/>
&gt; chair/bed/postlamp/torch<br/>
&gt; so far. Plus it make very nice screenshots (I have<br/>
&gt; mine between 2 griffs,<br/>
&gt; very nice)<br/>
