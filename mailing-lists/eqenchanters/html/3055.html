<div id="ygrps-yiv-204328366">You&#39;ll find it on the same person that sells the gate/bind type spells.<br/>
You may find it on other vendors as well.<br/>

Hey all,<br/>
I&#39;ve become lvl 24 (I didn&#39;t play for just over a week after splitting<br/>
up <br/>
with the person who bought the game and paid for my account...).<br/>
Anyway, I <br/>
can&#39;t find Major Shielding anywhere, and I&#39;d reeeeally like that!<br/>
It says on everlore that it should be available at the same places that <br/>
sell the other shielding spells but I&#39;ve tried both Qeynos  and Freeport<br/>
<br/>
and can&#39;t find it :o/  Anyone know exactly where it should be available?<br/>
I also cant find Invigor, which is also a general availability <br/>
spell...  the other few I haven&#39;t got need to be researched, or bought<br/>
in <br/>
Neriak, so I&#39;ll wander off in that direction later today.<br/>
Oh yeah... in Queynos, only ONE of the npc&#39;s sold lvl 24 spells!  ONE!<br/>
And <br/>
it was the very last one I checked!  Is there a gang of <br/>
chanter-spell-seller-kidnappers about? :o/<br/>
<br/>
I was bored last night after buying the spells available so I stood at<br/>
the <br/>
ec tunnel and gave all the widdle under-20&#39;s breeze, cloud and<br/>
Sympathetic <br/>
Aura... ain&#39;t i kind? :oP<br/>
