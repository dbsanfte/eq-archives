<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315159079">A very good technique I have used for soloing spiders in Nurga is to mez 1,<br/>
get my pet on the other, and then run back and mem wipe the 1st one.  One<br/>
thing IΓÇÖve found with mem wipe is it seems to work better if I cast it right<br/>
next to the target rather than from a ways away.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, the calm line doesnΓÇÖt work for breaking up the spider pairs as<br/>
they seem to run over each othersΓÇÖ spawn point in the process of coming at<br/>
me thereby waking up the one I calmed.  Also, casting calm is asking for<br/>
trouble when a resist comes.  Mez line seems to be more consistent.<br/>

- Still looking for mana sieve by the way...  lemme know if you can sell me<br/>
one!<br/>

&gt; I&quot;m told that the enchanters spell - soothe - is pretty useless, and<br/>
&gt; the druids harmony will beat it anytime.  Depending on the camp, root<br/>
&gt; can be helpful in pulling less mobs, also one I have used is Mesmerize<br/>
&gt; (and series).  When you cast these though, any other nearby associated<br/>
&gt; mobs will come running, so be careful.<br/>
<br/>
As a paladin, necro, or enchanter, I&#39;ve never had luck with<br/>
soothe/calm/rest the dead.  I tend to try them when I get a new one, but<br/>
haven&#39;t found one that is worth beans.<br/>
<br/>
Harmony works to pull singles if you&#39;re outdoors and have a druid/ranger.<br/>
The Bard spell works to pull singles.  The enchanter/cleric/necro versions<br/>
are pretty useless.<br/>
<br/>
Mez or root work to keep one mob out when you pull the rest, and then to<br/>
keep mobs busy while you kill one at a time.  It&#39;s not the same as single<br/>
pulls, but it&#39;s what we&#39;re good at.<br/>
