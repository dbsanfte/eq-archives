<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058773438">I would strongly recommend against starting jewelcraft without 1st putting<br/>
in 21 practice points.  While the gems may be fairly inexpensive to start<br/>
the cost of silver bars at 5gp ea is not.  Another thing to consider is that<br/>
your customers aren&#39;t too interested in the jewelry that is made from the<br/>
beginning gems (at least not until electrum or higher maybe).  If you try to<br/>
advertise a resistance to cold or heat item invariably you will get a /tell<br/>
asking how much AC the item also has.  Gems that give stat bonuses including<br/>
AC are way up the list of gems.  I haven&#39;t been able to sell a single<br/>
resistance to something item at any price.  People are interested mainly in<br/>
+2 str or wis or intel items.<br/>
<br/>
So, I would put all 21 points in to begin with and only work enchanted<br/>
silver so you can sell everything you make to players.  I can&#39;t remember<br/>
exactly where a skill of 21 puts you on the gems.  So, I would start at<br/>
around hematite and make something to see if you get the &quot;this item is<br/>
trivial...&quot; message.  If you make it and don&#39;t see that message then that<br/>
particular gem is ok for you.  If you do see that message move on to the<br/>
next higher priced gem.  The other message of course is &quot;you don&#39;t have the<br/>
skill for this...&quot; which may or may not mean you tried something too hard.<br/>
The MOST frustrating thing about trades in general is the ridiculous fail<br/>
rate on items that are trivial to you.  In my humble opinion if an item is<br/>
trivial you either shouldn&#39;t fail at it or you shouldn&#39;t lose your materials<br/>
when you do fail.  I&#39;m not saying they should change trades so that you<br/>
never lose your stuff.  I&#39;m saying they should change it so that you only<br/>
lose your stuff when an item would mean a chance at a skill gain for you.<br/>
It&#39;s not fair to know you won&#39;t get a skill gain on a trivial item and then<br/>
fail on that item 4 times in a row.  With amber for example that is around<br/>
3.1p per failure.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to refer to my editorial on EQ Enchanters about cheap jewelry<br/>
pricing but it&#39;s not listed today for some reason (was up yesterday).  As<br/>
someone else mentioned that is a great site for enchanters:<br/>

<br/>
So, I&#39;ll post my editorial in a separate post here.<br/>
<br/>
good luck,<br/>

There are thousands of opinions on the &quot;best way&quot; to go <br/>
about raising your skill and making money at the same <br/>
time.<br/>
My question is this:<br/>
If I do not train more than 5 points into Jewel Craft, <br/>
and raise it by experience instead (for the RP aspect of <br/>
learning hands on :) )is it beneficial to use silver <br/>
bars and Quarts/Malachite to increase skill?<br/>
At level 21 (max trainable at the guild) what gems will <br/>
not help raise JC skill?  <br/>
What is the order of stone progression exactly. ie what <br/>
does &quot;start with Carnelian and work your way up&quot; mean?<br/>
Can you give me a list? Star Rose Quarts, Carnelian, <br/>
Jasper, ?, ?, ?  <br/>
Thanks for reading my frustrated rant.<br/>
<br/>
Off topic, I was in N.Ro last night and I have never had <br/>
as much fun killing Skeles. Before I had to go sell I <br/>
had bagged 18 skeles in 30 minutes as the zone was <br/>
completely cleared and repopped twice. I started with no <br/>
money after just coming from the bank and had 5gp equiv. <br/>
in copper and silver before I had to go sell. I hope to <br/>
do it again tonight. hehe.<br/>
