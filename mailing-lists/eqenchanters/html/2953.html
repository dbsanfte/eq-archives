<b>Subject:</b> Stats over 200 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-827520055">The only stat that I have ever seen as being useless to be over 200 is<br/>
int/wis for a caster, as every point over 200 is only one point of mana. No<br/>
other stat has been investigated/explained as much as those. From my<br/>
experiences working with a warrior for example, there is a noticeable<br/>
difference when str is over 200 for melee damage, which continues to rise as<br/>
str rises. Nobody from VI has ever said exactly what cha will have what<br/>
effect on success/failure rate of what spells. I normally work with a 206<br/>
cha, though I do raise it to 213 when on the planes. I have not noticed any<br/>
major difference in Hate/Fear between myself and the other main enchanter I<br/>
work with in those places, who has a 185 cha. We bounced a forsaken reverent<br/>
back and forth with 4 or 5 resisted dazzles each once. I personally will<br/>
sacrifice some int (or any other stat) for the sake of getting my cha as<br/>
high as possible when I think it&#39;s called for. If I&#39;m having a bad streak of<br/>
luck mezzing (and who hasn&#39;t? usually, it&#39;s the blue ones that get lucky now<br/>
and then and won&#39;t mezz), I&#39;ll switch out items to boost my cha a bit.<br/>

&gt; True but it&#39;s not something you would want to sacrifice say hp or ac items<br/>

&gt;   From what I&#39;ve experienced and what I&#39;ve been told, having more than 200<br/>
 </span></blockquote>charisma, while not being necessary in any situation, can still be useful.<br/>
The simple fact is that the returns for &gt;200 in any stat is greatly<br/>
diminished, but not non-existant.  Simply put, an enchanter with 255<br/>
charisma has a better chance of charming/dazzling something in the Plane of<br/>
Fear than an enchanter with 200 charisma.<br/>

&gt;   At least this is what I&#39;ve been told by those who frequent the areas.<br/>

&gt;     I believe I read some where that anything over 200 on stats is a<br/>
