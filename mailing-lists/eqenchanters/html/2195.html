&gt; &gt;&gt;Greater Skellies on the undead island (OOT) are fantastic experience and<br/>
&gt; worth<br/>
&gt; 1-5gp per shot.  &lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am wondering, do these greater skellies help each other?  In other words,<br/>
&gt; do they cause trains or do groups attack all at once?  Thanks in advance for<br/>
&gt; the info.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes and no.  Skellies will help each other, much like spiders will.  It is easy<br/>
to avoid this since they are not static spawns.  They will drop and wander.<br/>
The shores are safe and I have never been jumped there.  Its kind of eerie<br/>
fighting within visual range of Spectres though.  Fortunately, their aggro<br/>
range is small, and they do not wander..  I spent all of last night there (on<br/>
Brell) with a 20ish monk, and a 20ish Mage.  They were soloing the gargoyles<br/>
while I took out the Skellies.  It was truelly one of the most pleasurable EQ<br/>
experiences I had.  2 hours, a boat load of cash and exp, and not once did I<br/>
even come close to meeting my maker.  Heck, I didn&#39;t even lose my pet.<br/>
GOODBYE OASIS!<br/>

To be fair, the loot still didn&#39;t compare to Karana bandits though.<br/>

Cheers</div>
