<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752855320">I use this one occasionally depending on where I am and what is being pulled. <br/>
 Recently we had a goblin get away from us in Solusek.  (We had two not quite <br/>
full groups in the area of the Foreman/Predetor between levels of 24 and 31)  <br/>
So as soon as the one got away I memorized Mesmerisation.  <br/>
<br/>
And boy was I glad that I did.<br/>
<br/>
With the number of people there and the goblin finding well over a dozen <br/>
buddies to bring back to the Foreman room there would have been no way to <br/>
effectively enthrall each individual one knowing that it was kind of a free <br/>
for all in killing them all off.  I was able to mesmerize most of them and I <br/>
did it a few times as they killed everything off.  And I was standing in the <br/>
corner farthest from the one I had targeted so I only accidentally mesmerized <br/>
myself once.  <br/>
<br/>
Never seen anything like that and live to tell about it : ) <br/>
