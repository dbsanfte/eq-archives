<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-607929218">These are problems better addressed by solutions outside of who can loot<br/>
what.<br/>
<br/>
Let the lower person you are helping loot the corpse.  My vision of<br/>
greens not providing special items ocurrs at the point someone loots not<br/>
at the MOB&#39;s death.  That is, if a 2 member group kills a monster the<br/>
lower member who gained experience should be the one who loots to get<br/>
the special item.  So this already would be a bit of a loophole now that<br/>
I think about it.  Oh well, still better than now.<br/>
<br/>
If you need to kill greens to get items after you die and are trying to<br/>
get to your corpse that&#39;s ok to get a little weapon or something I<br/>
think.  Only big items should get the treatment.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m driving at is give people who should be hunting that level of<br/>
MOBs the chance.  Why should godlike characters hang out at ridiculously<br/>
easy locations (for them) just because that&#39;s where the cool items<br/>
spawn?  If you want to help out a buddy that&#39;s cool, let your buddy loot<br/>
the item, now he has one of that item, and off you go to new hunting<br/>
grounds.  Currently we have groups parked at whatever place gives the<br/>
most lucrative loot and they take kill after kill (I.E. the wizards<br/>
mentioned earlier in another post on this thread) for the express<br/>
purpose of building cash.  Get out and see the world, find a spot more<br/>
appropriate to your level, and give fledgling characters the same chance<br/>
you had to hunt those area and get meaningful experience.<br/>
<br/>
All of this sort of comes down to how you play the game.  For some, it&#39;s<br/>
a game to kill kill kill and that&#39;s great for those people.  Others it&#39;s<br/>
something else, different for each player.  But wherever the different<br/>
play styles cross over we have an issue like this one that people<br/>
disagree on.  We all need money and neat items, low characters and high.<br/>
No right answer here, just some thoughts on how this could be helped.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for discussion,<br/>

And how would you propose this works if a group has a wide range of<br/>
levels?  I take my friend to Crushbone to get a shiny brass shield and<br/>
he can&#39;t get it because my level is too high.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I won&#39;t be able to get some items until they are green to me<br/>
simply because I&#39;m not able to compete with high damage classes like<br/>
Wizards.  Have you tried to compete with a wiz against a single mob? <br/>
They can just unload on it and you are out of luck.<br/>
