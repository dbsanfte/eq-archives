<div id="ygrps-yiv-301275136">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
    After posting my last list of combinations of jewlery combinations I got several suggestions to try using multiple bars of metal.<br/>
Some suggested that it would change the type of jewelry produced.<br/>
<br/>
The following combination,<br/>
1 Bar of Silver + 1 Bar of Silver + 1 Malachite =<br/>
&quot;Those items did not combine in those quatities to produce anything!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
    Yes, I separated the two bars of silver to take up two slots.  Perhaps it would work with other stones or maybe other metals, but not with silver and Malachite.<br/>
