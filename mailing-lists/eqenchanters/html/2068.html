<div id="ygrps-yiv-125161901">I have trouble selling the Stein for a worthy amount of money.  Most buyers<br/>
do not want to pay more than 100p. Not only that, but many players already<br/>
have the stein and would not buy it anyway.  As for being on the power list,<br/>
Money can only get you so much.  I guess that if you had enough, you could<br/>
PAY others to group with you and kill the MOBs that you couldn&#39;t...<br/>

Any class that can get unlimited money at lvl 12 (Stein quest) is definetly<br/>
high up on the power list.</div>
