<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282835905">Well I&#39;ve had Rune I for some time now and I havent been using it much. I<br/>
always keep it memmed in case of trouble for me and a partner but when I<br/>
want to save somebody, a blur is much more efficient. I&#39;ve been hunting<br/>
centaurs yesterday and sometimes 2 will come..well I would just blur one<br/>
away and if one of my tanks was getting hit too much I would cast blur on<br/>
the enemy and he would switch to somebody else. Actually mesmerize would<br/>
have worked too in this case. Rune I lasts about one hit or two in melee.<br/>
Maybe it would be useful if there were no time limit.<br/>

Just so I understand, Rune I does consume a stone each time you cast<br/>
it, right?  I should carry a supply of these stones around?<br/>
<br/>
Is there any reason to prefer netted over cloth?  same ac but it is<br/>
magic.  Does magic armor make any difference to getting hit?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

&gt; 1. Rune I is a great spell, its a lot like divine<br/>
&gt; aura (cleric).  More or<br/>
&gt; less it grants invunerability for a short time which<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure you can<br/>
&gt; imagine is quite handy.  A good spell to have!<br/>
