<div id="ygrps-yiv-319382818">it seems to me that the first magic rings you can make cost around 2 or 3<br/>
plats to make.. but I suppose that you can sell them for more...with a base<br/>
skill of 21, I dont want to waste money making non-magic rings. With which<br/>
stone do you think I can start practice with? do I have to start from<br/>
malachite? can I start with Onyx? or even more expensive stones? thanks for<br/>
the help.<br/>
Also, can you tell me which rings you found out are the best to sell to<br/>
players?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Honestly, it&#39;s a great idea.  Unfortunately, it takes SO much cash, that<br/>
you&#39;ll have a problem convincing someone to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I do:  Go wisp hunting.  I have a necro that I team up with<br/>
in the East and Wect commons.  At 8th level (maybe 4th too, I&#39;m not<br/>
sure) Enchanter pets can hit magic.  :)  With two spellcasters, and two<br/>
pets, as long as you can pull the wisps one at a time, you shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have any problems.  Also, pulling to a predesignated spot is great,<br/>
because then as long as your partner can watch you incoming, he can tell<br/>
you if there&#39;s anything else on you.  Good incase you start a train,<br/>
then you can zone right away.  :)<br/>
