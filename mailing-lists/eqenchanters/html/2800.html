<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256724050">What I should of said is:<br/>
<br/>
If you have 200 int and 150 charisma on your enchanter.  I dont <br/>
believe it is a good investment to lower your int to gain more <br/>
charisma since at this point and having done some tests it seems to <br/>
me that it all pretty much works the same after 150 charisma.  <br/>
However, if you can improve it without sacrificing INT by all means <br/>
do so.  In the end, I suppose it is all a moot point if you can get <br/>
to 200 int, 200 cha.</div>
