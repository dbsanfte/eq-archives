<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228022729">I read(on EQ developement board) that Specialization will work through<br/>
using your spells naturally....ie, if you use a spell requiring Alteration,<br/>
the Specialization will get a &#39;hit&#39; in the Alteration area...and through<br/>
use, it will effect how MUCH MANA you use to cast that particular line of<br/>
spells....<br/>

If you want to max conjuration, which I reccomend, walk through the newbie<br/>
area mesmerizing everything in sight.  See, mesmerization uses conjuration<br/>
for some reason.  I generally start a fight with mes, not that I need to<br/>
use<br/>
it, but just for the practice, as well as the free debuffs.<br/>
<br/>
As far as pierce and 2hb, do both.  You have the intelligence, and since it<br/>
only goes up a lousy 3 points a level, you can keep both at max fairly<br/>
easily.<br/>
<br/>
Save those training points for specilization (when implemented), research,<br/>
and any trade skills.<br/>
<br/>
In all, I think you have more than enough points to prime evocation or 2hb<br/>
some, it depends whether you want to take the time to max skills through<br/>
use, or use the points for a quick fix.<br/>

  I just have a few questions regarding skill points and their allocation.<br/>
  How have all of you spent your practices? I am lvl 8 now, and up to this<br/>
point have maxed out my Jewelcraft (21), spent one on Meditate, one on<br/>
Piercing (at lvl 1 a mistake I know), and have saved the rest.<br/>
  My spellcasting skills are all maxed except for Conjuration and<br/>
Evocation.<br/>
<br/>
  Have any of you maxed out your Conjuration skill?  I just don&#39;t cast my<br/>
animations THAT often. I spent over 40 daggers just creating Pendril&#39;s<br/>
Animation and then Reclaiming Energy immediately and my Conjuration skill<br/>
is<br/>
<br/>
still only 25 (as opposed to 45).  Is this a problem? Does skill affect<br/>
anything other than fizzles? Will my animation be stronger? I guess I&#39;m<br/>
just<br/>
<br/>
wondering if its worth dumping some points into. As for Evocation, I can<br/>
just now get Chaotic Feedback and so far have a skill of a whopping 3.  The<br/>
mana cost is just too much for me to use it extensively now, so my skill<br/>
rise is mired in slow motion. Is this worth skill points, or will increased<br/>
mana levels later on allow me to raise it for free?  Also, my 2h blunt<br/>
skill<br/>
<br/>
is only a 5, but I have been doing well with my Giant Snake Fang thus far.<br/>
Does piercing become inferior to the point of uselessness later on? Seems<br/>
like everyone and their dog has a staff.  I like my speedy attacks and hate<br/>
to waste any points, but this is another area that could use help.<br/>
I had originally wanted to save my points for Research, Specialization and<br/>
whatever Languages I would need for Research, but now think I might need to<br/>
use SOME of them at least before then.<br/>
I know there&#39;s no hard and fast rules, just wondering what everyone else&#39;s<br/>
thinking was, and what they may have done.<br/>
