&gt; These could include, but are not limited to:<br/>

&gt; (ALCHEMY) (Too recently implemented for me to talk to enough<br/>
&gt;Shamans to get a good idea on this one):<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LIke Enchanters cant have a high skill at fletching?<br/>
This skill actually already uses two amgic items to increase the effect and<br/>
is a good example of what we might be able to do.<br/>
The Planing tool and Whittiling blade could be created by us and a<br/>
blacksmith.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Any Gnomes out there know if this is even implemented<br/>
&gt;yet? Or in working order, if so?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Works great but we still dont know how to make some items described in the<br/>
book :)<br/>

<br/>
I cant see Enchanting helping this skill any though.  It just would not feel<br/>
right to mix them.</div>
