<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998295803">I accidentally overwrote working on someone elses reply - it will be going<br/>
back up when I get home from my night shift.  Just so you know...<br/>
<br/>
As a side issue I have given up on ever trying to achieve standardised<br/>
pricing.  It just will never happen.  EQ is a very different tradeskill<br/>
related game since so many people trade magic items for their wares, and<br/>
currency can come in many many forms of equipment.  I am now a follower of<br/>
the &quot;if both sides are happy&quot; principle.  To me if both people are happy in<br/>
a trade then good for them.  But trying to force people to use standard<br/>
prices simply will not happen - I have tried on my server and people just<br/>
won&#39;t listen - good thing only two of us can work in plat right now heh.<br/>
