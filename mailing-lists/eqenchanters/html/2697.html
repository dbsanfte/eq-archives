<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016304461">Faded pages are the toughest thing to research. To make it more confusing,<br/>
three spells use faded salil&#39;s writ pages, the left side of page 60 (Insipid<br/>
Weakness), the right side of 90 (Mana Sieve), and the left side of 288 (Mind<br/>
Wipe). For my guildmate at level 51 with a 149 research skill unfading these<br/>
is not trivial yet, though making the level 44 spells is trivial. They may<br/>
or may not sell to a vendor for different prices, I haven&#39;t had the chance<br/>
to check this yet, and if not, then there may be no way to tell them apart<br/>
while faded.<br/>
