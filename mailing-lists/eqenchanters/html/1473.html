I noticed a huge change particularly because of my playstyle. I almost<br/>
exclusively group with a cleric and monk yet the day before the patch they<br/>
were offline. So I decided to solo for the first time in over 12 levels.<br/>
Gulp.  Well It worked well. I was able to take aviak rooks solo fairly<br/>
easily. I got bored so I went to the ruins in Qeynos hills and sat around<br/>
casting quickness and berserker strength on people there.  So one time 3<br/>
dread skels and 2 putrids spawn and I jump in to save some people. It takes<br/>
a long long time but slowly they beat my health down as I allow the lower<br/>
levels time to kill them. Battle is over I have 3 bubbles of health. Now I<br/>
am level 28 and these are level 10-12 mobs. <br/>
<br/>
Jump to yesterday. My friends still aren&#39;t online. I&#39;m still at the ruins.<br/>
Same thing happens only with 2 dreads and one putrid. This time No ones<br/>
around and someone wants me to clear the sight so they can get to their corpse. <br/>
I step in and blam I start getting hit. Same 19 level difference but now I<br/>
am getting a LOT more 1 or 2 point hits then yesterday. A LOT. In fact I<br/>
can&#39;t even get a cast off for a period of over a minute and in about 1/5 the<br/>
time that it took the day before my health is now down 2 bubbles. This is<br/>
with only 2 dreads and 1 putrid as opposed to 3 dreads and 2 putrids the day<br/>
before that took 5 times as long to do the same damage and whom I could<br/>
EASILY cast through all their beatings on me because they rarely hit.  <br/>
<br/>
So point one I think the ATK values for mobs have gone up. Second point.<br/>
During the fight yesterday I actually got resisted twice by greens and that<br/>
hasn&#39;t happened in a long time. As you get out of the teens your resists<br/>
drop and I would say getting a green to resist occurs once in 30 casts.<br/>
Yesterday it was once in 8 to 10 casts.<br/>

&gt;I sure did get resisted a lot last night too.  I had just gotten my level 14<br/>
&gt;spells so wasn&#39;t sure what to see (talking as a shaman right now sorry).  I<br/>
&gt;was resisted on green stuff and blue stuff quite a bit last night to my<br/>
&gt;surprise.<br/>

&gt;did anyone else notice a lot of resisted spells after the patch while<br/>
&gt;playing last night? i certainly did... green aviaks were resisting ALL of<br/>
&gt;my spells, so i left ther and went to permafrost, and i got a bunch of<br/>
&gt;resists (at the wrong time, when else =)) there as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;just wondering if i was just having bad luck last night...<br/>
