<div id="ygrps-yiv-215227446">We&#39;re not nukers, so this spell isn&#39;t really all that needed anyway.  I used<br/>
Chaotic Feedback very infrequently until level 12 because of the amount of<br/>
mana it took.  At level 12 I followed the same tactics I always used, but I<br/>
tried to finish off the critter with CF.  By level 14 I had Evocation maxed.<br/>
<br/>
On a similar thread I didn&#39;t start using Sanity Warp (level 16 DD) until<br/>
level 20.  Generally speaking I only use our DD spells to interrupt other<br/>
spell casters.<br/>

&gt; OK, what happened here?<br/>
&gt; I just scanned a list of Enchanter spells and see we get out first<br/>
Evocation<br/>
&gt; spell at 8th level and it&#39;s mana cost is a whopping 45. Chaotic Feedback<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; a long recovery time, has a poor Mana/Damage ratio, and will fizzle like<br/>
&gt; crazy early on.<br/>
&gt; At 8th level the skill will max at 45. If you haven&#39;t spent training<br/>
points<br/>
&gt; in it each level, it will be a very time consuming action of getting this<br/>
&gt; skill to where you don&#39;t fizzle just thinking about casting it. Does<br/>
anyone<br/>
&gt; have a quick solution to raise this skill quickly besides standing around<br/>
&gt; casting it on yourself? At level 8 I will have 30 training points to spend<br/>
&gt; as I have 10 left still. If I max my Jewelcraft at 21 and pump the<br/>
remaining<br/>
&gt; 9 into Evocation I will still suck but it will not take me nearly as long<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; if I started with a &quot;0&quot;. Yes, I made the mistake of priming it with 1<br/>
point<br/>
&gt; within my first 2 levels before I saw when we get the first Evocation<br/>
spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I spent 15 minutes last night incresing my Divination from 1 to 23 while<br/>
&gt; casting Sense Magic (mana drain of 5). I also spent time increasing<br/>
&gt; Abjuration from 3 to 18 last night with Minor Shielding. Recovery time was<br/>
&gt; ok, but the thought of this for evocation gives me a headache. It could<br/>
take<br/>
&gt; your entire night of self-casting to get this maxxed. This assumes you<br/>
&gt; intend on not wanting to die in combat after 9 fizzles in a row and<br/>
becoming<br/>
&gt; OOM while a Green MoB kicks the crud out of you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Am I crazy, or should we have a low level Evocation spell? Even if it does<br/>
&gt; nothing like Sense Magic, I would spend the $ to get it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone else have thoughts on this?<br/>
