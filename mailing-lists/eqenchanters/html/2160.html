<div id="ygrps-yiv-180512333">don&#39;t think any are sold.  I looted one of a griffin once.  It was a freak<br/>
find as I was level 10 at the time.  Was walking along and *pop* this<br/>
griffin corpse appears at my feet.  I was looking around trying to figure<br/>
out what was going on and *poof* it disappeared.  I was sad till a few<br/>
seconds later it reappeared at which point I pounced on it.  Got a feather,<br/>
about 5p, and a black pearl.  I was so excited when the NPC offered me 21p<br/>
for the gem so I sold it.  Sigh, didn&#39;t know how rare they are since you<br/>
only can find them from loot supposedly.  Anyhow, got one off a griffin.<br/>
I&#39;m guessing the max quality of looted gem is based on the level of the<br/>
monster.  No gurruantee you&#39;ll get a good gem but at least possiblity is<br/>
there?  So, perhaps other NPCs that are similar level or higher will also<br/>
have black pearls?<br/>

Hey guys, i was wondering if anyone knew of a vendor that sells black<br/>
pearls.  That are supposedly rare, but caster&#39;s realm didn&#39;t include these<br/>
on the NPC drops so I was thinking maybe someone sells them.   Any clue?<br/>
