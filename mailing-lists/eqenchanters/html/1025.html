<br/>
- Topaz : I&#39;ve been toying back into the gems list just to check out any<br/>
differences. But this time there was a supply of Topaz nearby. With one gem<br/>
and one silver I got : &quot;you cant combine things with the current<br/>
proportion&quot; or something like that . Has anyone tried ever 2 bars and one<br/>
topaz?.<br/>
<br/>
- Minor Illus : I&#39;ve heard lot of ppl complaining this one was broken?!?.<br/>
As of last Wenesday, it saved my butt time and again. Last eg: In Befallen,<br/>
Guidor Modot (sp) go on rampage and clear level one of all unlucky players.<br/>
It never bothered a pack of bone (me, meditating) and bone&#39;s trusty pet. I<br/>
had lvl 1 all for myself for sometime after that. <br/>
<br/>
This spell is faster, wears off after, and is cheaper on mana than Sentinel.<br/>
