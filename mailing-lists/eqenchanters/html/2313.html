<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924929326">Just wanted to tell all you want to be Jewelers a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I am a level 34 Enchanter on Bristlebane Server. Name is Aeramus Brainblaster<br/>
<br/>
I recently got my skill to 200....yes, it took me over 4000pp to do it too.<br/>
now, at skill 200 you should be able to make everything...or so you would think.....i am letting you know that no Plat items are tivial, nor are they easy to make.<br/>
I was lucky enough to run a GM quest which rewarded me 25 Black Pearls.  now, a plat BP ring usually sells for about 1000pp. from my 25 black pearls i have made 10 rings....and had 12 failures.....<br/>
i gave some to my Guild cause they helped with the GM quest. so i have 6 left in my INV.<br/>
i have tried to make 6 Platinum Ruby veils, which usually sell for 900pp, and from the 6, i succeeded in making 2! i kept one for me, and i also made myself 2 Jasper plat rings, wis plus6<br/>
<br/>
for those who dont know, Wisdom helps in success rate of jewelcraft, so, i just upped my WIS 19 points for jewelcraft, and all the stats above are with that boost and my success rate is not good. it makes my WIS 126.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to let you guys know a bit about jewelcrafting, if you have any questions, feel free to reply.<br/>
<br/>
Its hard to sell to people, when they want a plat item, and you tell them there is a chance there will be a failure.......took me a while to figure out what to say to get them to trust me.<br/>
