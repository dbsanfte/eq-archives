<div id="ygrps-yiv-91490150">Maybe I am just loyal to the class but I refuse to do this quest for anyone.<br/>
This is an enchanter quest and I have found it kind of apalling how every<br/>
enchanter left right and center is using it as a get rich quick scheme<br/>
instead of keeping the items a little more in house.<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping enormously they make the steins no-drop, although this won&#39;t<br/>
correct the complete abuse of this quest which has occurred by some<br/>
enchanters out there.<br/>
