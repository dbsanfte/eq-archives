if you fail when attempting to mesmerize will this activate them and<br/>
send them after you?<br/>

Yes they are very different. Mesmerize is a great spell for solo or<br/>
groups.<br/>
It basically stuns the creature for up to 30 seconds, allowing you to<br/>
step<br/>
back and cast, get away, or in a group scenario, you can mesmerize one<br/>
or 2<br/>
of the 3 creatures attacking your group, allowing the others to kill the<br/>
one that remains unstunned. Do note, once u hit it, or cast a DD or DoT<br/>
(Direct Damage or Damage over Time) spell on it, it&#39;s no longer stunned.<br/>
Lull makes the creatures less aggressive for a VERY short period of time<br/>
(2-4 seconds). This is useful when wanting to attack a camp of 2 or more<br/>
creatures they you couldn&#39;t handle alone or grouped with others. <br/>
Personally I didn&#39;t bother with Lull, but soon as I got Soothe (a better<br/>
Lull) my group and I started taking camps we would of normally gotten<br/>
slaughtered. My routine was, Soothe 2 of the 3 in the camp, while<br/>
another<br/>
magic user would have the 3rd targeted. Once I Soothed the 2 (with out<br/>
them<br/>
resisting) I announced go, they would cast on the 3rd pulling it out of<br/>
the<br/>
camp so we could fight it with out the other 2 attacking us all at once.<br/>
VERY important, Soothe only last 3-7 seconds, giving just enough time to<br/>
Soothe 2 and pull a 3rd, so do not waste time and make it as fast as you<br/>
can else you&#39;ll end up pulling 2 or 3 vs. just 1.<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt;Is mesmerize a better Lull spell or is it totally different?  I always<br/>
&gt;here people say &quot;Use Lull.&quot;  I always use mesmerize.  Is that bad?  If<br/>
&gt;they are different could you explain why?  Thanks,<br/>
