<div id="ygrps-yiv-660064087">Just a cut and paste from EQCasters.  I hope you don&#39;t mind Baelish :)<br/>

<br/>
MORE ON THE GLOWING STEIN&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;SMALL&gt;More<br/>
details for you on the stein.  The new &lt;B&gt;Stein of Moggok&lt;/B&gt; as well as<br/>
being a 7/43 1 Hand Blunt Weapon does still retain the &lt;B&gt;Glowing Stein&lt;/B&gt;<br/>
bonuses of +10 Int +5 Dex +10 HP and +20 sv Disease.&lt;P&gt;<br/>
GM&#39;s have confirmed the Quest difficulty is also being increased when the<br/>
new item is implemented.  One great side effect of this is that you can now<br/>
wield the stein in a primary melee slot (since its primary only) and be<br/>
safe from the charm-morph bug.&lt;P&gt;<br/>
This is actually an improvement of the item.  Those lucky enough to have<br/>
both a Glowing Black Sphere and a Stein have hit the jackpot now.  Complete<br/>
safety near charming monsters and 19 int.  Combining with the Crude Stein<br/>
is also popular with Enchanters.&lt;P&gt;<br/>
I would advise getting a stein before the patch if you want one though<br/>
because Verant&#39;s definition of &quot;harder&quot; can be an understatement (eg: Plane<br/>
of Fear)</div>
