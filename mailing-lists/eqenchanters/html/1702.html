<div id="ygrps-yiv-240152341">So, last night Raloon and I were hanging out just outside Permafrost,<br/>
waiting for our group to get together. We were getting kinda bored,<br/>
so I challenged him to a duel to pass the time, see what his spells<br/>
did, etc.,. We were messing around for about 15 or 20 minutes, he<br/>
eventually casts fear on me and I start running to the Ice Giants<br/>
(this isn&#39;t the bug, but I&#39;ll share anyway), then mezzes me before<br/>
I hit them, scaring the pants off me. When the charm wore off, I<br/>
walked up to him meditating and gave him a round kick to the head.<br/>
He had it coming.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, so then we start messing around with charm and beguile and<br/>
what-not. He charms me and walks me around and makes me say stupid<br/>
things, then he tries `/pet get lost&#39;. I find myself at the character<br/>
selection screen with my Monk in Halas. I log back in and have lost<br/>
half a bubble of XP, have no items, and it sure looks like I&#39;ve<br/>
died and gone to Halas. DOH!<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, when he issued that command I slashed myself (interesting,<br/>
since I&#39;m a monk) for 32000 points of damage (beware my nails of<br/>
doom!). The duel was ended with my untimely death, and Raloon was<br/>
/highly/ apologetic. But I can&#39;t really blame him, who&#39;d have<br/>
thought that would happen? It doesn&#39;t happen on NPCs after all.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;d been a little more willing to lose some more XP we would<br/>
have tried Reclaim Energy on me next. It&#39;d be kinda funny if he<br/>
could InstaKill me and replenish his mana at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
So, there you go, my tale of woe, and now you know, never have an<br/>
enchanter for a foe.<br/>
