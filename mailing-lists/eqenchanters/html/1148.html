<div id="ygrps-yiv-468870768">well it took me quite some time to get this spell...now I have it.<br/>
and it does not do a thing. I used it plenty of times in unrest yesterday<br/>
night on a horde of green death beetles. Nothing! <br/>
Occasionnaly one would resist and come for me, that&#39;s all!<br/>
What&#39;s the deal? Anybody has some info on this spell?<br/>
