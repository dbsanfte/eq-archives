<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034814689">The best place for levels 8 through 12 I believe are the Misty Thickets.  <br/>
Great experience from the Goblins, Orcs, and as you get into the upper parts <br/>
of this range Motto the named Goblin.  There are also Bears, Young Kodiaks, <br/>
Giant Scarabs, and Giant Wasps for the occasional amusement.  There are some <br/>
fun quests you can complete while you are working your way through these <br/>
levels as well.  Good Luck.<br/>
