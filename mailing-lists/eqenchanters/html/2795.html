<div id="ygrps-yiv-252084566">well, and this is from a druids point of view mind you, that cha only<br/>
affects if the spell will stick and (according Verant) from then on the<br/>
charm has to go through a saving roll every so often and that the spell<br/>
caster&#39;s stats have nothing to do with the saving roll(duration) on the<br/>
charm.  Of course you have to take anything Verant says with a grain of<br/>
salt, so you may want to keep your cha high, but in my exp with my low cha<br/>
halfling(50 cha) if the charm sticks it can last as long as someone with a<br/>
real high cha.<br/>
