Well the reason that the level 1 spell is Alt is that it is not a DD spell<br/>
it is the first of the Dot spells.  Try it on yourself it does the first<br/>
damage then about 20 more after that.  The first Evoc spell / DD spell is<br/>
at level 8.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
The information source was EQCasters Spell list. Baelish has it as a DD<br/>
spell.  Also, I do not remember ever seeing this spell do more damage after<br/>
the initial cast when casting on myself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
This is not the only level that this happens when you hit 29 get use to<br/>
your DOT since it the last one you get till you hit 49.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;&gt;<br/>
My bad. Thank you.</div>
