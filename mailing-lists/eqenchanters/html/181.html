 </span></blockquote>For the most part I agree.  Whether or not the totem staff is worth it is<br/>
very largely dependant on your level.  If you&#39;re using the 2H blunt skill,<br/>
you should go something like worn great -&gt; fine steet great -&gt; rune totem.<br/>
Eventually, you really will need to get the totem however, there are just<br/>
too many magic only mobs once you get much higher than 15.  Certainly, the<br/>
magic flag is the only real advantage it has over the fine steel.<br/>
    On the other hand, one of the perks of being a magic slinger is a nice<br/>
high intelligence.  Later on, I know there are daggers that are very, very<br/>
nice, and I&#39;ve heard that some of the better staffs out there are 1H&#39;ers.  I<br/>
would really recommend trying to keep all your weapon skills up.  Once you<br/>
get to the point where you&#39;re maxing them out (prolly around level 8ish), it<br/>
becomes very, very easy to keep them that way, allowing you to always use<br/>
the best you can find.  However, if you&#39;re only going to use one weapon<br/>
skill, I would recommend two handed blunt.  Magical weapons in the other<br/>
skills are either very hard to find or hideously expensive.<br/>
