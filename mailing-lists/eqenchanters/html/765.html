<div id="ygrps-yiv-449556394">Acutally it is not a PVP only tactic. What you do is send one person out to<br/>
attract the attention of a really nasty creature and attack it. They then<br/>
run back to the ambush site and then the Enchaters all attack. The only use<br/>
for the Minor illusion spell in this case is to play in character.. it very<br/>
well know that when you attack a monster and run it will hunt you down. So<br/>
you can use this tactic to attack creatures that con red and be pretty sure<br/>
that you will live.<br/>
<br/>
Yes you are right about invisibility working also but I like the minor<br/>
illusion since the decoy character can spot the ambush location.  If they<br/>
get twisted around. It would be bad if he ran to the wrong area :-(<br/>
<br/>
As I said in the original post yes it would be a group of 6 enchanters.<br/>
Actually I believe that the Enchanters are more powerful thatn they are<br/>
givin credit for and when you have 6 Enchaters each with an animation spell<br/>
and all the others nice effects I believe that they would come out ahead.<br/>
<br/>
I have tested this tactic with a few other enchanters and I must admit that<br/>
it worked rather well. and it was very fun to listen to people in Toxxulia<br/>
Forest speak about the trees that attacked..<br/>
<br/>
The best thing about playing as an enchanter is that you have to combine<br/>
your spells in different ways to truely bring out the power of this class/<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Well, such a tactic is definitely PvP because a NPC you either want to<br/>
&gt;fight or don&#39;t. If you do you walk up to it and bash it, cause waiting<br/>
&gt;for it to wander into your ambush will take forever, and if you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;you walk away from it, or run as the case may be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But for the record, minor illusion is a self only spell, invisibility<br/>
&gt;would work better. Though a group of skeleton arms lieing on the ground<br/>
&gt;to ambush some unsuspecting group on Rallos Zek sounds interesting,<br/>
&gt;they&#39;d all have to be enchanters, and a group of enchanters without any<br/>
&gt;other classes would get wiped as soon as the &#39;victims&#39; realized what<br/>
&gt;was up, and started whacking those mysterious skeleton arms.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I have been playing an enchanter for 7 Levels now<br/>
&gt;&gt; and I must admit that the enchanter is one of the<br/>
&gt;&gt; best classes in the game.  I am very interested in<br/>
&gt;&gt; jiong up with 5 other enchanters and taking the show<br/>
&gt;&gt; on the road. WIht out unique spells we are perfectly<br/>
&gt;&gt; suited to be spys or ever assasins for hire. We can<br/>
&gt;&gt; lure enemies into an area as the rest of the group<br/>
&gt;&gt; hides using minor illusion and then poof we can<br/>
&gt;&gt; attack. They will never know what hit them. What do<br/>
&gt;&gt; you think?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; PS<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not talking about blidly PKing people I am just<br/>
&gt;&gt; talking about stratigies for use with any enemy.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
