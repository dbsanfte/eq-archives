Enchanter Quests from Sol Temple<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First guy, named Sultin<br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;hail Sultin&#39;<br/>
Sultin says &#39;I am Sultin - keeper of the three [Incandescent]s of power and the [Rod] of Insidious Glamour.  If you are an Enchanter, perhaps we can deal. <br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;tell me of the Incandescent of power&#39;<br/>
Sultin says &#39;There are three Incandescent items of power - [Wand], [Mask] and [Gloves].  Are you [interested] in any of them? <br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;i am interested in the wand&#39;<br/>
Sultin says &#39;Ahh, the Incandescent Wand.  If you will get the components to make another, I will give you mine. I will need a Pouch of Silver Dust, found on the dusty Werebat in the Estate of Unrest.  I will also need a Silver wand, found on a Silvered Guard in the Temple of Cazic Thule.  This wand will not be enchanted - you will need to pay Esmirella of the Northern Karana Gypsy Camp 50 gold to enchant it for you.  When the Wand is fully enchanted, bring it and the pouch to me and I will give you the Incandescent Wand. <br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;i am interested in the mask&#39;<br/>
Sultin says &#39;An item of power - the Incandescent Mask.  If you will bring me the components to make another, I will give you an Incandescent Mask.  I will need a Glowing Mask, found on the skeletal monk in the caverns of Guk.  I will also need all three Runes of Fortune.  One Rune can be found on the Dark Elf Enynti in the Chasm below Castle Mistmoore.  The other two can each be purchased for 50 golden coins each - one from Mizr N`Mar in the Neriak City Library and the other from Madam Serena in the city of Qeynos.  Bring me all three Runes and the Glowing Mask and I will give you your reward. <br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;i am interested in the gloves&#39;<br/>
Sultin says &#39;My personal favorite - Incandescent Gloves.  If you bring me the components to make another pair, I will give you my gloves.  Incandescent Gloves are made by sewing together four other sets of gloves.  Glowing Gloves can be found on our mortal enemies - the Shadowed Men.  Radiant Gloves can be found on Radiant in the mazes of Cazic Thule.  Enchanted and Gleaming gloves can  be purchased for 50 golden coins from Tizina of the Lavastrom Gypsies and a bloodstone from Tarn Vislin of HighKeep.  Bring me all four sets of gloves and I will give you a pair of Incadescent ones. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
You say, &#39;tell me of the rod&#39;<br/>
Sultin says &#39;I am keeper of the Rod of Insidious Glamour - a device of guile and deceit.   The rod will increase the Charisma of whomever holds it.  Are you [interested] in obtaining the [rod]? <br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;i am interested in the rod&#39;<br/>
Sultin says &#39;If I am to give you this rod, you must bring me the parts to make another.  I will need the Golden Rod from the froglok priest in Guk, as well as a Shining Stone from our mortal enemies, the Shadowed Men.  Once you have obtained the Shining Stone, you will need to get it enchanted.  Cynthia of the Rathe Mountain Gypsy Clan will enchant the Shining Stone for you - give it to her with 50 golden coins.  When the Stone is fully enchanted, bring it and the rod to me and I will give you a Rod of Insidious Glamour. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Next guy, named Romar Sunto<br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;hail Romar Sunto&#39;<br/>
Romar Sunto says &#39;I am Romar Sunto, servant of Solusek Ro.  I am searching for the [Coin] of the mighty enchanter [Tash] - if you are interested in helping me to acquire it, I will [reward] you with a powerful spell.  I am also dispenser of [Darkwood Staves] - sometimes also called the Staff of Ro. <br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;tell me of the coin of Tash&#39;<br/>
Romar Sunto says &#39;Tash had a collection of ten antique silver coins that were left in different cities across the world.  If you were to collect all 10 coins, I would give you a [Coin Pouch] that would let you combine them into the maser Coin of Tash.  If you are interested, I will sell you a copy of the Tome of Tash, detailing where the coins were reportedly left, for a mere 50 gold. <br/>
Romar Sunto says &#39;I will lend you this coin pouch - put all 10 antique silver coins into it and combine them into the Coin of Tash.  (received a pouch with 10 slots), Gave Romar 50gp for a book, this book is full of riddles of where to find the coins (this wont be easy). Seems like one in every city. but where?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;what is this reward&#39;<br/>
Romar Sunto says &#39;I will reward you with a scroll for the spell Tashania - for personal use, of course. <br/>
<br/>
You say, &#39;tell me of the Darkwood staves&#39;<br/>
Romar Sunto says &#39;Bring me a Lambent Stone from a Hill Gant, a Sand Giant or a Griffon and I will give you a Darkwood Staff.</div>
