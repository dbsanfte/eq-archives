<b>Subject:</b> Enchant Silver on Team PvP when not a DE <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045216446">I am not a DE, but I want to begin making enchanted jewellry.  Any<br/>
suggestions as to acquiring Enchant Silver on Tallon/Vallon Zek?  I am<br/>
*not* going to make a mule character, but, is it possible, at lvl 8, to<br/>
use invisibility to sneak into Neriak, purchase the spell, and get out?<br/>
Is it advisable to wait  until level 12 and the DE illusion?  Or, is<br/>
neither approach safe, and should I just try to find a dark one willing<br/>
to betray their race for some platinum?</div>
