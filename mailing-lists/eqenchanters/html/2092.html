<div id="ygrps-yiv-884205553">Ok I just have to give my 2c since I play(ed) a 22 enchanter on Fenin Ro and <br/>
currently play a Human druid on Tallon Zek.<br/>
<br/>
First here is a little background from a human team perspective on this <br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago when I started playing on the server, the evil team was by <br/>
far the largest, and they still are.  They owned everything from the oasis to <br/>
South Karana, Lavastorm, Nektulos and the Commonlands at times.  The humans <br/>
and other races owned everything else pretty much.  Since they controlled <br/>
Lake Rathe, they leveled pretty darn quickly to the point they are at now.   <br/>
Now they have moved  into EK to camp the druid ring and kite HGs and such.  <br/>
<br/>
In order to address this encroachment and superior numbers, pretty much all <br/>
of the non evil races have learned to tolerate each other with the exception <br/>
of some gnomes (you never know how they&#39;re going to act).  This places the <br/>
evils into a seige type mentality.  Many of them constantly complain about <br/>
how we&#39;re supposed to be fighting amongst ourselves.  In addition, I believe <br/>
many DE enchanters are kids who joined this server to mess with people and <br/>
generally piss them off.  They believe they are &#39;Roleplaying&#39; an evil by <br/>
using tactics which will be illustrated in the following story.<br/>
<br/>
One day I was rather miffed at the fact that I teleported into a druid ring <br/>
in Ek only to be attacked and killed by an enchanter, wizard and cleric.  <br/>
This stuff happens so it isn&#39;t normally a big deal but hey I&#39;m a druid and <br/>
they are killing my people so I got on guildchat.  I grouped up with a <br/>
cleric, monk and another druid (bout 13 levels lower).  We gated into the EK <br/>
ring and took them by surprise.  We immediately jumped on Touch the enchanter <br/>
with the monk,  but he managed to gate while the monk was pounding on him.  <br/>
We snared the cleric and chased him down.  The wizard wasn&#39;t anywhere to be <br/>
found.   <br/>
<br/>
We decided to relocate to med up and keep the enemy off guard.  While running <br/>
up the river I see Touch binding wounds on the bank.  I then realized he was <br/>
looting his corpse.  The monk must have kicked him at the last instant, <br/>
teleporting his dead body.  Touch jumps up and runs into the water, accusing <br/>
us of corpse camping.  We hadn&#39;t fired a shot, it isn&#39;t our guild&#39;s way.   We <br/>
had another scrap, Touch managed to charm our monk who was chasing me around <br/>
but we routed them again.  By this time two other people had shown up, a <br/>
ranger and a druid and things were winding down.  We had left when the ranger <br/>
started messaging me that Touch had charmed  him and set him on Sir Morgan.  <br/>
I said that sucked sorry I had to log.   Then the ranger messaged me again <br/>
saying Touch had corpse camped him and charmed him again, sending him against <br/>
Sir Morgan AND that he had lost experience for both deaths.  I&#39;m not sure I <br/>
believe the experience thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Does one bad apple ruin the bunch?  Well, some may say no but the reality is <br/>
that there are lots of bad apples on racewar.  Having charm makes enchanters <br/>
on TZ one trick ponies.  I have heard more bitching about being charmed and <br/>
set on NPCs than any other thing.  For those who don&#39;t know, if you charm <br/>
someone and set him on a NPC, you can&#39;t loot him.  So why do it?   Because <br/>
you don&#39;t want to fight the guy?  Mez is just as good. Mez him and leave.  <br/>
<br/>
There are TONS of tactics you can try for  one on one pvp, all of which would <br/>
make your opponent mincemeat.  Pet,   whirl/med cycle comes to mind.  With <br/>
Mez you have all the time in the world to choose the way to play it.   <br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t survive on Tallon without Charm? We won&#39;t miss you.<br/>
Have a sense of fair play and don&#39;t be a one trick pony.<br/>
