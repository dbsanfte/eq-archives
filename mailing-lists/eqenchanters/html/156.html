<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742415232">Thanks!  If you can find Jasper I think this is a good gem for skill<br/>
level 21-22.  Carnelian, one step up on the jeweler I saw is too hard<br/>
for me as of yet I think.  I know it&#39;s more likely for your skill to go<br/>
up when you do harder things, but it&#39;s too expensive to fail  :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, more helpful info:<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know, a person who sells gems (actually more than<br/>
one) are in the mage guild place in west freeport.  There&#39;s one outside<br/>
by the birdguy and there&#39;s one or more inside upstairs I think.  A<br/>
person who sells bars of silver, etc. is in north freeport. If you go to<br/>
the bank area and leave the marketplace area there will be a building in<br/>
front of you and you have to turn left or right.  The door close by to<br/>
the left goes into a room where a lady is selling jewelry and bars.<br/>
I&#39;ll add this to the page as well.  Happily the prices are identical<br/>
even though I&#39;m dealing with humans now and my quoted prices were from<br/>
Felwithe (high elves)<br/>

FYI, regarding your jewelry website....<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned in my post to the group,  I&#39;ve also maxed my skill in<br/>
training points (21?) and have not yet seen a raise in skill after about<br/>
5<br/>
successes(non &#39;trivial&#39;) and 3 successes (trivial at my level) and 2<br/>
failures.....so your formula seems right on...2 of 10 attempts failed at<br/>
my<br/>
level.  i was, of course, using enchanted silver, too...and have not<br/>
yielded a magical item yet.  I am using cat&#39;s eye at this point, as the<br/>
lapis and hematite gives me &#39;trivial at your skill level&#39; messages.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the carnelian/silver combo will make a wedding ring.  I&#39;ve made one<br/>
of<br/>
two attempts at that.<br/>
