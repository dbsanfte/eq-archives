<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908772791">At level 30 (will get out of it one of these days), I have been running<br/>
around with a 152 cha. When a 29th+  level shaman is around, I have him keep<br/>
his cha buff up on me as it is slightly better than Sympathetic Aura. I can<br/>
take it to over 170 (with an unacceptable int loss). I seem to recall<br/>
reading here once about a 2nd break on prices at 170 cha, but this was not<br/>
the case when I took mine higher (had it to 180 with the high level cha buff<br/>
tossed on me by a level 49 or 50 enchanter). At 152, beguile lasted long<br/>
enough on a yellow or red /con to finish off a deep red MOB (a poorly timed<br/>
pull by someone else got dropped on us).<br/>
