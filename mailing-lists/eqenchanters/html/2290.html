<div id="ygrps-yiv-312549868">I have never seen this happen at Najena in Lavastorm, soon as I see more<br/>
than one FE jump in (or even one when I&#39;m level 12 or so), I hit that zone<br/>
running and screaming. Did have a similar thing happen to me leaving<br/>
Runnyeye for the Gorge one day, haven&#39;t explored that enough to even know<br/>
where I was, just memmed gate and cast. This happenned without being hit, I<br/>
think I bumped into someone on other side of zone and got transported. Had a<br/>
friend leave Permafrost one day (with a few Ice Goblns beating on him) and<br/>
get tossed up a hillside in Everfrost, then die from the fall. Took a bard<br/>
quite a bit of time to help him find his corpse.<br/>

&gt; There are a number of places where being hit at the zone border plops you<br/>
&gt; somewhere else in the next zone.  Here&#39;s some that I know of:<br/>
