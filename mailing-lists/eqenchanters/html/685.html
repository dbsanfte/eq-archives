<div id="ygrps-yiv-320496457">it&#39;s a personal choice,  I think...use them where you might need them, but<br/>
don&#39;t use often enough to raise.<br/>
<br/>
I used a couple in Sense Heading, since I&#39;ve only seen one raise point that<br/>
occured through use..the rest I&#39;ve put into jewelry.   ...and one in<br/>
Meditate at lvl 8, of course.<br/>

  I just have a few questions regarding skill points and their allocation.<br/>
  How have all of you spent your practices? I am lvl 8 now, and up to this<br/>
point have maxed out my Jewelcraft (21), spent one on Meditate, one on<br/>
Piercing (at lvl 1 a mistake I know), and have saved the rest.<br/>
  My spellcasting skills are all maxed except for Conjuration and<br/>
Evocation.<br/>
  Have any of you maxed out your Conjuration skill?  I just don&#39;t cast my<br/>
animations THAT often. I spent over 40 daggers just creating Pendril&#39;s<br/>
Animation and then Reclaiming Energy immediately and my Conjuration skill<br/>
is<br/>
still only 25 (as opposed to 45).  Is this a problem? Does skill affect<br/>
anything other than fizzles? Will my animation be stronger? I guess I&#39;m<br/>
just<br/>
wondering if its worth dumping some points into. As for Evocation, I can<br/>
just now get Chaotic Feedback and so far have a skill of a whopping 3.  The<br/>
mana cost is just too much for me to use it extensively now, so my skill<br/>
rise is mired in slow motion. Is this worth skill points, or will increased<br/>
mana levels later on allow me to raise it for free?  Also, my 2h blunt<br/>
skill<br/>
is only a 5, but I have been doing well with my Giant Snake Fang thus far.<br/>
Does piercing become inferior to the point of uselessness later on? Seems<br/>
like everyone and their dog has a staff.  I like my speedy attacks and hate<br/>
to waste any points, but this is another area that could use help.<br/>
I had originally wanted to save my points for Research, Specialization and<br/>
whatever Languages I would need for Research, but now think I might need to<br/>
use SOME of them at least before then.<br/>
I know there&#39;s no hard and fast rules, just wondering what everyone else&#39;s<br/>
thinking was, and what they may have done.<br/>
