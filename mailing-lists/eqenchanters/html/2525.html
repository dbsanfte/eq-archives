  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Last night I went to Quenos to try and purchase a 
  rune from Madam Serena.&nbsp; Apparently, she had heard of me from SOMEONE 
  (I&#39;m not naming names) and refused to speak with me, simply took my 
  money.&nbsp; Not a single illusion would change her mind, nor would any of my 
  &#39;you like me&#39; spells.&nbsp; In an act of desperation I attempted to charm her 
  with my magical spells, but apparently she is UNcharmable (I used a full mana 
  dump trying).&nbsp; For those not knowing why I did this... pets always 
  consider amicable, and a charmed NPC is always happy to trade with me.&nbsp; 
  Unfortunately, Leutenant something-or-rather saw what I was trying to do 
  (after I had meditated back to full and was trying to charm her again) and hit 
  me, VERY hard.&nbsp; So now not only do I have to find some way to make Madam 
  Serena like me but I have a grudge with that hard hitting guy.&nbsp; Do I have 
  to go spend a week in BlackBurrow killing wimpy gnolls or is there some other 
  faster way to make Madam Serena interested in dealing with me?</font></div>
