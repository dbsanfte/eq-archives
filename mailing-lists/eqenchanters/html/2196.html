<div id="ygrps-yiv-131717674">Yes, but the way I interpreted what he was saying is there is no<br/>
*level* skill cap on trade skills, meaning even a level 1 can become a<br/>
&quot;master&quot; jeweler provided he was twinked enough to have the cash to<br/>
purchase the metals and gems and put in the practice.  Where as the<br/>
&quot;regular&quot; skills such as your fighting and casting skills do have a<br/>
cap depeding on your EXP level.<br/>
