It&#39;s good to see that you are practicing your language skills, but perhaps<br/>
you should learn to write before you call other people dumb.<br/>

&gt; haha man, you took that persoanlly didnt you?<br/>
&gt; for those who have a slow machine to really wanna wonder about running<br/>
&gt; speeds, get your clarity, go to a shaman, and say<br/>
&gt; &quot;clarity for sow&quot; it seems to work every time, and then you dont have to<br/>
&gt; worry bout your machines speed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; geeze, if you cant admit that dicussing computer stats in relation to<br/>
&gt; running speed is a dumb thread, then you really out to examine your 2<br/>
&gt; cents<br/>
&gt; worth.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; lets discuss casting time in relation to computer speed and particle<br/>
&gt; density<br/>
&gt; on &quot;off&quot;, &quot;low&quot;, Med&quot;, and &quot;high&quot;<br/>
&gt; yea, that about the dumbness of this thread.<br/>
