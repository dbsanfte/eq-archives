<b>Subject:</b> RE: Stein Quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-740358378">I started the quest to get my own stein last night.  I&#39;m a 13 high elf<br/>
enchanter on Povar.  <br/>
<br/>
The jumjum juice is Lore but NOT no drop.  The honeycombs took me about 5<br/>
minutes to get myself by killing bixies in Mistythicket (you need 3).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently working on the fish.  I have a friend who was willing to take<br/>
the faction hits for killing the fish in Qeynos.  The fish are no drop so<br/>
have to loot them yourself.  After 3 fish still nothing has dropped.  He<br/>
hopped out of the water after the last fish and the paladins came running<br/>
 from all over the area to kill him hehe.  He took a 365hp hit and died.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully will get a fish and can move on to Erud&#39;s Tonic which I believe is<br/>
Lore, No Drop.<br/>
<br/>
So we have:<br/>
nuts - not no drop, not lore<br/>
jumjum - not no drop, lore<br/>
fish - no drop, lore - major bad faction hit per attempt at getting fish<br/>
tonic - no drop, lore<br/>
<br/>
Azara, Povar<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Also, all the items except for the nut are Lore No Drop now I am all but<br/>
certain, so you have to do most of it yourself . If you can, have a friend<br/>
work on getting honeycombs, as this seems to be the most time consuming part<br/>
of the quest. I walk into Misty and immediatley /auction buying honeycombs<br/>
1pp, though I have heard of some people offering 3pp per honeycomb (pretty<br/>
good money for a newbie halfling if he&#39;s smart and holds on to them).<br/>
