Hi all, i&#39;ve not introduced myself... just joined this list last week and <br/>
as there haven&#39;t been any posts.. well, that&#39;s my reason for not doing it <br/>
before now :o)<br/>
I&#39;ve only just started playing EQ in the last few weeks, i&#39;m a Gnome <br/>
Enchantress on The Rathe server.<br/>
Doing pretty well, I&#39;m lvl 14 now and a large loan from a friend has <br/>
ensured that I&#39;ve been able to get almost all my spells and lots of decent <br/>
kit :o)<br/>
Anyway, so far I&#39;ve played... in North Freeport for the first few lvl&#39;s, <br/>
Misty Thicket up till 7 or 8, then West Commons up until now, killing <br/>
Dervs.  I&#39;ve pretty much stopped getting exp from killing them now (in <br/>
groups of 6 usually), so have been dumped in Oasis... but so far everything <br/>
iv&#39;e come across is green or red :o(<br/>
Does anyone have any tips for the best place to be located at this <br/>
lvl?  Obviously I&#39;d like to get to 16 soon to get breeze but at the rate <br/>
I&#39;m going, I&#39;m either going to not move from low lvl 14, or go down to 13 <br/>
if I get killed any more in oasis :o(<br/>
Thanks a lot,<br/>
<br/>
