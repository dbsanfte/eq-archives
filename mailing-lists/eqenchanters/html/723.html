<div id="ygrps-yiv-304534425">I believe the duration of Invisiblity is random, I&#39;ve had it last for a<br/>
super long time, and other times it&#39;s gone before I can count to 50.<br/>
Had an a little sight seeing adventure in Castle Mistmoore when I found<br/>
that out :) Took me two days to get my body back, I was VERY deep<br/>
inside when the invisibilty wore off.<br/>
As for Highhold, I went at 8th level and passed right by that orc while<br/>
Invisible with him none the wiser that I was there. My best guess is<br/>
that indeed your invisiblity ran out, it happens quite abruptly, you<br/>
don&#39;t usually even see it blink.<br/>

&gt; I am sorry to say, chances are your invso failed,<br/>
&gt; and the orc jumped you<br/>
&gt; right off. I&#39;ve had invso drop without notice<br/>
&gt; before, as a matter a fact,<br/>
&gt; only twice since EQ went production (march 17) I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; had invso last for the<br/>
&gt; full durration.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;m sorry if this message sounds bad, but i love<br/>
&gt; the game, just a little<br/>
&gt; upset right now.  I finally made 8th level, and so<br/>
&gt; off I go to get my pet<br/>
&gt; spell.  I had read many reports on this list, so I<br/>
&gt; thought myself prepared.<br/>
&gt;  After about an hour and a half trip from Felwithe,<br/>
&gt; I finally reach High<br/>
&gt; Hold Pass.  My invisibility still going strong, I<br/>
&gt; procede in a short<br/>
&gt; distance only to be rooted and killed by some<br/>
&gt; #@!!@#$ orc who could see<br/>
&gt; invisible.  I came from Kithicor forest.  Was I just<br/>
&gt; unlucky?  Is there<br/>
&gt; another better way in, other than through kithicor? <br/>
&gt; That place is insane.<br/>
&gt; How do they expect us to ever get a pet at this<br/>
&gt; level?  I&#39;ve been hearing<br/>
&gt; Mages whine about have to research 24th level pets. <br/>
&gt; How about getting<br/>
&gt; screwed out of 8th level.  If my bitching is<br/>
&gt; unfounded, please tell me.  I<br/>
&gt; will appologize.  If there is an easier way, or I<br/>
&gt; just got unlucky, let me<br/>
&gt; know.  Please.<br/>
