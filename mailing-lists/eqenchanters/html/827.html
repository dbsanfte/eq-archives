<div id="ygrps-yiv-850825813">I noticed that unlike most pets, the level 12 was immediately blue and green<br/>
to me, although I have succeeded in getting a white one on rare occasions. I<br/>
also noticed that it only takes 1 dagger to create ( or did, I haven&#39;t<br/>
played in a week or so ) so I didn&#39;t complain too much. I usually have no<br/>
problems, just attack, cast whirl, and let your weaker pets hack away<br/>
without being hit.<br/>

&gt;Has anyone noticed a nerfing of our pets in the past few days? Last night<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;wisp isle (where I used to hang out alot to get the money for my 12th level<br/>
&gt;spells) my pet was dying before I could finish casting my opening spells.<br/>
&gt;This used to happen only rarely, but last night I was only able to keep the<br/>
&gt;pet 2 times out of 11. After looking at the log, it appears that the pets<br/>
&gt;had far fewer hp than normal. I understand that sometimes you just get a<br/>
&gt;weak pet, but with so many consecutively? BTW, I had gotten killed in a<br/>
&gt;Kerra spider snafu and had lost 12th level, so the pet I was using was the<br/>
&gt;8th level one that I was very familiar with, and had been using to harvest<br/>
&gt;wisps earlier.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Which brings me to my 2nd question. Does anyone know how the 12th level pet<br/>
&gt;spell works? What I mean is, it doesn&#39;t appear to create a randomly strong<br/>
&gt;pet like the 8th level spell does. The first 4 pets I cast conned green to<br/>
&gt;me. The next few conned blue to me. I had heard that you could get a pet<br/>
&gt;that cons white to you at 12th level, but I didn&#39;t see one last night. As a<br/>
&gt;matter of fact, the level 8 pets that I had to use after losing my level<br/>
&gt;seemed to do better than my level 12 pets. My conjuration is in the low<br/>
&gt;50&#39;s, so it&#39;s not maxed, but it&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. Anyone else<br/>
