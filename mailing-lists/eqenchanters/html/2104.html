&gt; I am new to the list and have Jeweling questions for you.<br/>
&gt; My questions involves training points.<br/>
&gt; After you spend the max 21 points at the guild and you get to your next<br/>
&gt; level can you put those 5 into your Jewel Craft skill? Can you do this at<br/>
&gt; each level?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, and no<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I realize you may not want to do this or advise it, but is it possible?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; What reasons would you give for NOT putting your training points into<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jewel<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Craft at each level, even if you only put in 1 or 2.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no reason, if I could I certainly would... I spend most of my points in<br/>
languages now<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, after you reach 16th, how hard is it to do research and advance it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its hard, but dont worry you&#39;ll be doing it for a long long time<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should I save points for Specialization?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only one point per each specialization.  I suggest that you decide what you<br/>
want to specialize in ( I hear most enchanters specialize in alteration, I<br/>
know I did).  When you get level 16, train one point into each<br/>
specialization, and then go outside and cast a spell from your &#39;main&#39;<br/>
specialization repeatedly, until specialize:alteration (or conjur, evoc,<br/>
whatever) reaches 51... then no other specializations will beat it and you<br/>
can go about your daily business.<br/>
