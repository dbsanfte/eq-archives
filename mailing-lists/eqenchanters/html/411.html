<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-394361554">actually I have heard a good theory that has werked eversince I tried<br/>
it.......DONT TRAIN until your JUST about to level......then run over to the<br/>
guild master and train EVERYTHING you can in your magics FIRST up to the<br/>
MAX........what this dus is allows ALL your magic skillls to be maxed at<br/>
every level....most of them will be due to your own use but I know as a<br/>
Druid I hardly use Divination and Conjuration......actually I use them alot<br/>
its just they are tuff to get up cuase I got them late and didnt practice<br/>
much.......but if you max everything out RGHT before you level youll be<br/>
maxed all the time.....and wont have much training to do....then you can<br/>
save your opoints and things for stuff like RESEARCH!!!&gt;....and<br/>
SPECIALIZATION!!!.......hope this helps....<br/>
