<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022767204">I strongly advise you do not try using dark elf illusions in high hold for 2<br/>
reasons....<br/>
<br/>
1.  Your probably only L8 and wont see it for another 4 levels <br/>
2.  The guards kill dark elves on sight I believe, and they are much worse<br/>
than the orcs.<br/>
<br/>
You were the victim of bad luck, i have made the trip with several L8<br/>
characters (and a L4 one once before the animations were added locally)and<br/>
have never had an orc see through my invisibility.  I have had it wear off,<br/>
but was able to run to the guards and survive.<br/>

I am sorry to hear that you ran into trouble..  But I must admit that I have<br/>
never found an Orc that can see invisible  ( I may be wrong, its just that I<br/>
have never ran into one).  What server are you on?  I am on the Rathe Server<br/>
and would be happy to assist you in obtaining your Animation.  Here is<br/>
another Thought for you also:  You may want to use the Dark Elf illusion,<br/>
the Orcs in CrushBone do not attack me when I am using the DE illusion so<br/>
perhaps the Orcs in Highpass will not either..  But I would still use<br/>
INVIS..<br/>
