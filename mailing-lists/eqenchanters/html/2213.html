<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394173641">This was against none agro and agro things I used these spells.  I do it<br/>
from a distance they come.  I was in Sol A the other night in the gabbie<br/>
room I used mind wipe and I am amiable normally.  Everything including the<br/>
guard guys by the gate and the vendor came at me.<br/>

&gt;it&#39;s supposed to wipe their hate list... while none of the blurs are 100%<br/>
&gt;effective, i&#39;ve never had a mob aggro on me after casting it (though i<br/>
&gt;never cast it on a mob tat ISNT aggro to me)<br/>

&gt;&gt;first off what is the diffence between these too they seem to do the same<br/>
&gt;&gt;thing for me.  Also why if you cast these spells does it agro eveything<br/>
&gt;&gt;around you?  I though it was suppose to be a blur.  I dont remember blanket<br/>
&gt;&gt;agroing things before last patch did they screw it up or did I just get<br/>
&gt;&gt;lucky and it didnt agro them?  I didnt get Mind Wipe till after the patch<br/>
&gt;&gt;but it did the same thing too me agroing everything it hit onto me.<br/>
