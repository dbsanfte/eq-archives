<div id="ygrps-yiv-268208661">I had that happen the other night in Solusek.  Couldn&#39;t help but get too <br/>
close and got myself and half the gobs in the room resisted.  I use the area <br/>
mes sparingly.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I agree with you on everything except one. If my party is fighting 3 or <br/>
more<br/>
 creatures I don&#39;t bother with Enthrall. My mainstay in that case is<br/>
 mesmerization. I was in a party in Permafrost the other day and the tank<br/>
 pulled 14(!) assorted ice goblins. There were some hairy moments in that<br/>
 battle with lack of communication between 2 of the tanks, but then score at<br/>
 the end was Party:14 Goblins:0. Don&#39;t underestimate that AE mesmerize, just<br/>
 don&#39;t stand too close.. hehe. &gt;&gt;</div>
