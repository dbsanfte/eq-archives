&gt;&gt; did anyone else notice a lot of resisted spells after the patch while<br/>
&gt;&gt; playing last night? i certainly did... green aviaks were resisting ALL of<br/>
&gt;&gt; my spells, so i left ther and went to permafrost, and i got a bunch of<br/>
&gt;&gt; resists (at the wrong time, when else =)) there as well.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; just wondering if i was just having bad luck last night...<br/>
