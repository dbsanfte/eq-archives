<div id="ygrps-yiv-192465622">In response to jeweling, you have to practice it to make it go up. This is a<br/>
long, tedious, and expensive process. I made some money back on electrum<br/>
jade, but not enough to cover my losses. By the time I could do Gold, I was<br/>
able to make back some of the 1000+p that I lost raising Jewelcraft. But<br/>
once I hit level 35 and started working in plat, it was over. I made all my<br/>
cash back, and I have plenty of money to spend buying items for myself and<br/>
all my friends. I have spent thousands on other people, and thousands on<br/>
myself, and I still have thousands in the bank, and I don&#39;t peddle that<br/>
much, I let people come to me. And Ive been stuck at skill 191 for months.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the skill points of an Enchanter should be saved for Research. You<br/>
can practice like 1 per level from 16-19, and then 5 per level for every<br/>
level 20 and above. If you plan on raising this skill from practice alone<br/>
good luck. Some of those spell pages are really hard to come by. Chances are<br/>
you will not find pages for your spell level until you are a few levels<br/>
higher, or perhaps even the next spell rank. The pages for a level 16 spell<br/>
are found on level 16-19 mobs. So if you just turned 16, unless you are<br/>
fighting whites, yellows, or reds, you will not find your pages. Currently i<br/>
am still seeking level 44 pages, but there are few level 44 mobs in the<br/>
game. I have still never seen a 49 research page, but considering the<br/>
relatively few 49+ mobs Ive killed thats understandable. Will have to get 49<br/>
pages from the planes. (it is possible for a guk wizard, or a guk knight to<br/>
have one, as they get up to 50 i believe.)<br/>
<br/>
I have spent many practice points into research, and I plan on spending my<br/>
max 5 per level if i have to. Theres no way Im gonna get spell components on<br/>
a 49 spell and risk losing it. I have heard there is a practice book you can<br/>
use with ordinary components, but that was broken the last time I tried.<br/>
Although it may be well worth looking into. I may go back there myself and<br/>
see if I can get my skill up.<br/>
