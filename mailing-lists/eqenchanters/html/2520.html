<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470075562">Rune series is great. Not only do you have a better chance of regaining your<br/>
concentration and getting mes off, but you are also saving your cleric a<br/>
little mana on the heals for your *crunchy* self. At level 50 Rune III is<br/>
always up, as soon as its off, right back up.<br/>
<br/>
Also don&#39;t forget the power of tepid deeds. If you slow the monsters while<br/>
they are mesd, if someone accidentally breaks mes, or if they come out<br/>
before you have a chance to recast, you have plenty of time to cast between<br/>
their hits. <br/>
Heh, tanks in Gukbottom used to think I cast it so they wouldnt get hit as<br/>
much (which I did), but more importantly, so i could cast between swings<br/>
fairly easily. =)<br/>
