<br/>
	First of all thanks for the replies on Rune I.<br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	I still have a question on research though.<br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	I was on baelish&#39;s EQ Enchanter site looking at the research<br/>
section, it says That for level 16 spells I need page 23 for levitate 24 for<br/>
disempower and 26 for Mesmerization.∩┐╜<br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	∩┐╜My problem is that I have had all these pages, put them in the<br/>
book(one at a time) and hit combine. I get the message those items in that<br/>
combination failed to produce anything.<br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	I was then told I have to have the left and right pages, but under<br/>
the page description It says just page 23 or page 24 of Tasarins Grimoire.<br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	What am I doing wrong?<br/>
	I also was not allowed to put any practices into Research.<br/>
	∩┐╜<br/>
	Sorry for the long winded questions but I am a bit confused about<br/>
research.<br/>
