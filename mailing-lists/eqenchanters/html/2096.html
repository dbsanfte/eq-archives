I personally prefer to increase my jewlrey skill by practicing making<br/>
jewlrey instead of<br/>
spending the money on skill points.  My skill is still low (only at 35), but<br/>
actually<br/>
making the jewlrey gives for getting the money you put into the skill back,<br/>
instead of spending the money for the points, and not seeing the money<br/>
back..<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, but I had an Enchanter before (7th level) and never made a profit<br/>
at it or even came close to breaking even because of the failure rate. Even<br/>
if I did succeed I still took a loss. So in my mind, if I can increase my<br/>
Jewel Craft at the guild at a &quot;loss&quot; and have it go up each time I spend a<br/>
training point instead of hoping the next attempt at creating something new<br/>
will improve it still at a loss, then the guild way is a better way.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure about the research question as I am only level 12 right now,<br/>
but I<br/>
have saved some of my practice points for research.  My question is this:<br/>
Where do I find the pages for the research?  after days of hunting the<br/>
dervishes in North Ro I picked up one page (24 of Tasarin&#39;s left side).  Are<br/>
there any other places I might be able to pick these up quicker?<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oasis and Lavastorm are the places I have seen words, other than vendors.<br/>
Fire Elementals, Lava Basalisks and and other nasties drop them.  However, I<br/>
would just Auction into the zone to see if anyone is selling the words you<br/>
need/want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want the Levitate spell, Druids sell it as Druids do not research any<br/>
oth their spells. Not sure if any other spells can be bought like this<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Good Hunting.<br/>
