<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099830128">Assuming you have Kunark:<br/>
I agree that Lake of Ill omen is the place to go around 22.  My enchanter<br/>
has leveled from 20 to 26 in that zone and can easily keep going there until<br/>
30.<br/>
 <br/>
Some good spots at 22 in the lake are:<br/>
first binding:  probly best to bind at the lake / mountain zone since this<br/>
is close to area where you will find groups<br/>
solo - dunno very dangerous solo and the zone is pretty big<br/>
small group - healer and tank partners - on west lake shore toward south or<br/>
south lake shore toward west (hint: clouds go west)<br/>
full group - outside sarnak fortress near bridge or in front of fortress or<br/>
pulling to lake / mtn zone<br/>
 <br/>
once you hit the upper 20s head to frontier mountains for brutes and<br/>
mountain giants in full group.  At 26 they con from blue to red.<br/>
 <br/>
Finally on Kunark, don&#39;t be fooled by thinking Firona Vie is the place for<br/>
you since it&#39;s the first zone you hit in the new world assuming you come on<br/>
the boat.  That zone is a nightmare and you&#39;ll easily die to a host of<br/>
things till you are around 30.  I&#39;m sure some people have made it work but<br/>
honestly the lake of ill omen is so much less stressful and rewarding.<br/>
 <br/>
No Kunark:<br/>
full group in upper guk or cazic thule.  enchanters are sought in CT for<br/>
train stopping abilities and there are lots of lizards.<br/>
I recommend these place only if you don&#39;t have Kunark.  If you have the<br/>
expansion go to the new lands!<br/>
 <br/>
hope that helps a bit.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Hello fellow enchanters, its me again :)  <br/>
 <br/>
I am now level 22 and looking to leave Lake Rathe and head out to level<br/>
elsewhere.  I am told to head to SK or to Unrest.  Does anyone have any<br/>
ideas on the best place?<br/>
 <br/>
Also:  Im a little low lvl yet, as far as i can tell, to do the quest for<br/>
the incandescent gloves and mask.  Does anyone know what they sell for? Or<br/>
even what lvl I should wait until to do the quest?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again guys!<br/>
