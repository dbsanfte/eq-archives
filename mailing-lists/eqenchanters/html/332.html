<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177828369">Have you tried to combine two bars or three bars of enchanted silver with<br/>
one jewel? I think I heard somewhere that with one bar, you get a ring, with<br/>
two an earring and with three a necklace/amulet...I wouldnt swear though...<br/>

Ok, I have been keeping track of different combinations of jewels and this<br/>
is my list thus far in response to The Wanderer&#39;s post.<br/>
All of the below were made with Enchanted Bar&#39;s of silver.<br/>
<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Malachite     =         Silver Malachite Ring<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Labis Lazuli =         Silver Labis Lazuli<br/>
Ring<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Turquoise     =         Silver Turquois<br/>
Bracelet<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Hematite      =         Silver Hematite Ring<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Cat&#39;s Eye Agate =  Silver Cat&#39;s Eye Necklace<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Bloodstone   =         Silver Bloodstone<br/>
Earring<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Onyx             =          Silver Onyx<br/>
Bracelet<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Jasper          =          Silver Jasper Ring<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Carnelian      =         Silver Carnelian<br/>
Wedding Ring<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Star Rose Quartz = Silver Rose Engagement Ring<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Amber          =          Silver Amber Ring<br/>
<br/>
Notice even though I used enchanted siver for all of the above no magical<br/>
jewelry was produced.  Apparently a more expensive type of metal must be<br/>
used to get magic jewelry out of the above stones.<br/>
Below is a short list of the magic jewelry that I have created using<br/>
enchanted silver.<br/>
<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Jade           = Jaded Silver Ring,<br/>
Effect: MANA +5<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Pearl           = Silvered Pearl Ring,<br/>
Effect: VS POISON +4<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Topaz         = Topaz Silver Necklace,<br/>
Effect: VS DISEASE +4<br/>
<br/>
Also I was wondering why there are four slots in the jewelry kit.  So I<br/>
briefly tried a couple attempts using multiple stones.  Since both attempts<br/>
were unsuccesful and this type of experimenting is expensive I discontinued<br/>
this experiment until later.  These are the failed attempts:<br/>
<br/>
1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Malachite + 1 Lapis Lazuli = &quot;These<br/>
combinations and quantities  of items fail to combine to produce anything.&quot;<br/>
1 Bar of Silver + 1 Lapis Lazuli + 1 Turquoise = &quot;These combinations and<br/>
quantities of items fail to combine to produce anything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can add to this list, please feel free.<br/>
Also, if anyone can tell me how the skill cap is calculated for jewelcraft I<br/>
would like to know, I have a level 14 Enchanter who has a 30 in jewelcraft.<br/>
After hitting 30 my skill has not risen even after numerous attempts to<br/>
raise it.  Am I maxed for my level?<br/>
