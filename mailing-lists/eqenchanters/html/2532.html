know that one? hehe<br/>
<br/>
If you charm a mob, they will like you or ANY of your<br/>
friends, and let you compelte quests.  Just be<br/>
careful!  make sure to have gate memmed too =)<br/>

&gt;   Last night I went to Quenos to try and purchase a<br/>
&gt; rune from Madam Serena.  Apparently, she had heard<br/>
&gt; of me from SOMEONE (I&#39;m not naming names) and<br/>
&gt; refused to speak with me, simply took my money.  Not<br/>
&gt; a single illusion would change her mind, nor would<br/>
&gt; any of my &#39;you like me&#39; spells.  In an act of<br/>
&gt; desperation I attempted to charm her with my magical<br/>
&gt; spells, but apparently she is UNcharmable (I used a<br/>
&gt; full mana dump trying).  For those not knowing why I<br/>
&gt; did this... pets always consider amicable, and a<br/>
&gt; charmed NPC is always happy to trade with me. <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, Leutenant something-or-rather saw<br/>
&gt; what I was trying to do (after I had meditated back<br/>
&gt; to full and was trying to charm her again) and hit<br/>
&gt; me, VERY hard.  So now not only do I have to find<br/>
&gt; some way to make Madam Serena like me but I have a<br/>
&gt; grudge with that hard hitting guy.  Do I have to go<br/>
&gt; spend a week in BlackBurrow killing wimpy gnolls or<br/>
&gt; is there some other faster way to make Madam Serena<br/>
&gt; interested in dealing with me?<br/>
