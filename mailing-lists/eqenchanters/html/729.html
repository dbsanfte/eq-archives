<div id="ygrps-yiv-800547537">I have been playing an enchanter for 7 Levels now and I must admit that the enchanter is one of the best classes in the game.  I am very interested in jiong up with 5 other enchanters and taking the show on the road. WIht out unique spells we are perfectly suited to be spys or ever assasins for hire. We can lure enemies into an area as the rest of the group hides using minor illusion and then poof we can attack. They will never know what hit them. What do you think? <br/>
<br/>
PS <br/>
I&#39;m not talking about blidly PKing people I am just talking about stratigies for use with any enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Mushin</div>
