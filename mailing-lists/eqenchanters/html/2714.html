chips going for 4pp per stack in a lot of places, it&#39;s not a cheap road.<br/>
<br/>
4 Bone chips to Trooper Mozo in Field of bone give faction with:<br/>
LegionOfCabilis (troopers)<br/>
CabilisResidents (merchants and bankers, I hope)<br/>
ScaledMystics (shaman guild?)<br/>
CrusadersOfGreenmist (crusaders, I assume)<br/>
Swifttails (monk guild?)<br/>
<br/>
Same for 3 watcher torches to Captain Gideen in SE corner of Warsliks<br/>
Woods (he is trooper faction, so once you can talk to Mozo, you can talk<br/>
to him). About half or more goblin watchers carry a torch, and you can<br/>
tell which ones because they leave a smoke trail.<br/>
<br/>
Beware when turning in the watcher torches - there is a crusader who<br/>
wanders close enough to see you, and if he does you&#39;ll be killed by<br/>
Gideen before the crusader even gets to you.  I presume it&#39;s the same with<br/>
mozo, but I was very careful when turning things in after that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.  4 stacks of 4 works just fine, you get 4 completion messages.  I&#39;ve<br/>
not tried a stack of 16 (or 4 stacks of 20), but I know it didn&#39;t work<br/>
when I tried it for the neriak red wine &quot;quest&quot; some months ago.<br/>
