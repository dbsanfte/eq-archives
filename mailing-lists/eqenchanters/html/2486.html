&gt; I use this one occasionally depending on where I am and what is being<br/>
&gt; pulled. <br/>
&gt;  Recently we had a goblin get away from us in Solusek.  (We had two not<br/>
&gt; quite <br/>
&gt; full groups in the area of the Foreman/Predetor between levels of 24 and<br/>
&gt; 31)  <br/>
&gt; So as soon as the one got away I memorized Mesmerisation.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And boy was I glad that I did.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With the number of people there and the goblin finding well over a dozen <br/>
&gt; buddies to bring back to the Foreman room there would have been no way to <br/>
&gt; effectively enthrall each individual one knowing that it was kind of a<br/>
&gt; free <br/>
&gt; for all in killing them all off.  I was able to mesmerize most of them and<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; did it a few times as they killed everything off.  And I was standing in<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; corner farthest from the one I had targeted so I only accidentally<br/>
&gt; mesmerized <br/>
&gt; myself once.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Never seen anything like that and live to tell about it : ) <br/>
