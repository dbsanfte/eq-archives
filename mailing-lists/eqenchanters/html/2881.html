<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966950113">Hi all;<br/>
<br/>
I have been taking a break from my Enchanter lately, but I have a few<br/>
questions on skill points. After I hit 8th, I put 10 points into evocation<br/>
since the spell itself sucks alot of mana. Now When I look forward, I see<br/>
research at 16 and nothing again til 20 for specialization, then dodge at<br/>
22, then nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Now if what I read is correct at 16, 17, 18, and 19 I can train 1 point into<br/>
research for each level. At 20 I can put as many points into it as I wish.<br/>
Is this correct?<br/>
Do I save my points and pump research to the max at 20 (70 minus the 5 for<br/>
specialization)?<br/>
How hard is it to be successful at 16 with a skill of 1?<br/>
My primary char is collecting lefts, rights, faded pages, etc. so that I can<br/>
increase skill but I would like to know my odds for when I actually start<br/>
using the pages for research.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
