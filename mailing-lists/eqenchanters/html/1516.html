<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913870645">Ah Robequest!  Such is the life of the enchanter, as it is with most magic<br/>
classes I suppose (except those nasty clerics... its not fair!)<br/>
<br/>
Level 5 you should still be wearing a Jr. or Sr. apprentice robe... these<br/>
are NO-DROP items, so when that lvl 8 PK sees you he wont be interested in<br/>
your wares(I play on Zek).  I have seen no end to the amout of level 10 and<br/>
less characters wearing the Flowing Black Robe, or Thamurgists robe, when<br/>
its impossible that they got them themselves.  Now sure some get them as<br/>
gifts, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that I suppose, but wouldnt you<br/>
treasure that robe more if you&#39;d actually EARNED it?<br/>
<br/>
The Thamurgists robes can be found in Befallen, down deep in its bowels, but<br/>
dont go looking for it until you&#39;re at least 15 and in a nice sized group.<br/>
The Flowing Black Robe is well beyond the reach of a level 5 character, so I<br/>
wouldnt worry about it just yet.... Also, if you get a chance head to Guk<br/>
for armours... you&#39;ll find many woven pieces inside if you are persistent,<br/>
and these are perfect for a magic user.  You&#39;ll find this task fairly easy<br/>
on any server except Rallos Zek, where the ogres and trolls will eat you<br/>
alive if you&#39;re not a dark elf.  I went in as a gnome disguised as a dark<br/>
elf, and everything was fine until my illusion wore out mid fight, as trolls<br/>
apparently dont like illusions very much.  It was all I could do to<br/>
pacify/entertain them with minor illusion and charm to keep myself out of<br/>
their stew pot!<br/>

&gt; &gt; In my many wanderings of old and new characters I<br/>
&gt; &gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; others running around wearing very nice white, blue,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; black robes. I have seen people /auction Damask<br/>
&gt; &gt; robes<br/>
&gt; &gt; and looking for another that I can&#39;t remember the<br/>
&gt; &gt; name<br/>
&gt; &gt; of.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just hit 5th last night (without using a pet up to<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; now :) ) and would like to see a list of all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; different robes available and their stats.  I have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; set<br/>
&gt; &gt; of Damask pants (thanks to my wife) and would like a<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; complete set.  Anyone who knows what pieces are out<br/>
&gt; &gt; there and what the benies are, please let me know.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, you can spoile me as to where to acquire them<br/>
&gt; &gt; too. :)<br/>
