<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535652352">I play Stargazer Erudite Enchanter on Fennin Ro almost exclusively.  <br/>
I have a Barbarian Shaman level 5 also on Fennin Ro but he&#39;s just <br/>
sitting there waiting for me to get bored playing my enchanter.  <br/>
<br/>
In my frustration with the lack of role-playing on Fennin Ro, I started<br/>
a bard on the PvP server and ran him up to lvl 4 or 5, but the first<br/>
couple of times I took him out of the newbie zone I found groups of <br/>
level 8 dark elves sitting there PKing over and over again without so <br/>
much as a nod to rp&#39;ing so I gave that up.<br/>

How many of you are playing multiple characters at the same time?<br/>
I played first a dark elf necro up to level 16..<br/>
my main character is now an enchanter level 20..I&#39;ve been playing her a lot<br/>
but since Saturday ( which is when I leveled ) I havent been fighting at<br/>
all, I&#39;m in one of those travelling / meeting people mood.<br/>
Anyway, this morning I started a bard...I dont why ...I completely gave up<br/>
my necro when I started to play my enchanter. I dont want to do that this<br/>
time, but sometimes I get bored and I need something new...<br/>
