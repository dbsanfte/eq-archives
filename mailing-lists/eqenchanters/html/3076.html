<div><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a virus in my address book which sent 
itself to all.&nbsp; My apologies.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t know I had it until someone 
emailed me that I&#39;d sent it to them.&nbsp; I knew I hadn&#39;t mailed them anything, 
but you don&#39;t have to with this &#39;party&#39; virus. </font></div>

should probably e-mail everyone in your address book to warn 
them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></font></html></div>
