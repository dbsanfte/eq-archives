&gt; I was wondering if an enchanter-specific website was out there.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Twink: To give items or cash to a player of a level who would have<br/>
&gt; &gt;absolutely no chance of getting them at that level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I personnally have never looked at twinking as cheating, more just of<br/>
&gt; &gt;shortcutting. I do tend to avoid playing with twinked people as I have<br/>
&gt; found<br/>
&gt; &gt;that most of them can&#39;t play for squat. They tend to consider themselves<br/>
&gt; &gt;invulnerable, as most monsters near their level are quite easy to kill. At<br/>
&gt; &gt;some point (Brad has said this and I have seen it in action), the monsters<br/>
&gt; &gt;you are fighting catch up to whatever gear you have, and then you must rely<br/>
&gt; &gt;on teamwork and play skill to survive. And if the twinkees (generally) had<br/>
&gt; &gt;that to begin with, they could go out and get level appropriate gear and<br/>
&gt; &gt;survive. &lt;gets down off his soapbox and awaits the flames while waiting for<br/>
&gt; &gt;an on topic thread to start&gt;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So now that the lifetap spells of necro&#39;s are resistable, are people<br/>
&gt; finding<br/>
&gt; &gt;it even easier to find a group?<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Twinking is having one of your high level characters gain<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; equipment/items/money and then transfer it to one of your lower level<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; characters.  One method of doing this is to &quot;drop&quot; the items on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;ground,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; log out, log in with your other character and &quot;find&quot; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Another method is to pay another player to hold the items while you log<br/>
&gt; &gt;out<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and back in with your other character.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Many regard twinking as cheating as far as &quot;that character&quot; did not earn<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; those items.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
