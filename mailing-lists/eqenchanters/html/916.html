<div id="ygrps-yiv-29373338">This is the most well thought out post of this whole discussion.... What we<br/>
need to do is do exactly this, get an intelligent, thought out list of<br/>
&#39;complaints&#39;, send it to Verant, and some of the bigger EQ sites...<br/>

&gt; Ok I&#39;ve read a lot of things about protesting for the Enchanter&#39;s<br/>
&gt; cause...lots of ideas on how to protest but shouldn&#39;t we come up with a<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; of balance issues that we can send to Verant.<br/>
&gt; The main issue seems to be the resistibility of our spells. Here is what I<br/>
&gt; think. All our spells are tested against Magic Resistance where other<br/>
&gt; classes spells are tested against Fire or Cold Resistance. If you are in<br/>
&gt; Lavastorm Mountain, all your fire based spell wont even harm a green<br/>
&gt; creature. So the trade off is that our spells can affect creatures of any<br/>
&gt; kind. The problem is that most of the magic-users get an extremely good MR<br/>
&gt; due to spells. Another problem is the fact that our damage spells dont do<br/>
&gt; any damage when resisted. Right now, our spells are almost never resisted<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; greens, rarely by blues, rarely by whites ( although I could not cast a<br/>
&gt; single spell on Dorn when he was white to me ), sometimes resisted by<br/>
&gt; yellows, resisted 20-30% of the time by the reds that are one level above<br/>
&gt; yellows and resisted 100% by all other reds.<br/>
&gt; Here is my list of suggestions:<br/>
&gt; 1) Damage spells should at least do some damage when resisted following<br/>
&gt; similar rules as the wizard spells with a lesser ratio maybe to keep a<br/>
&gt; balance with those easy-to-kill wizards,<br/>
&gt; 2) Our spells should not jump from a 20-30% resistance to a full 100%<br/>
&gt; resistance, there should be a nicer ramp so that an enchanter is not<br/>
&gt; completely useless in a group of 6 people attacking one strong red target.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I dont have other suggestions because I personnaly think that enchanter is<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; very strong class. I have an enchanter level 16 now and I had a necro<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; 16 before and my enchanter is almost as good in solo ( nothing can beat<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; triple dots+feign death+let pet finish the critter combo of the necro ),<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; much much better ( much more useful would be the word ) in groups. I am<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; annoyed that sometimes I have to watch my friends kill reds for me while I<br/>
&gt; cant even cast a spell to help except buffs.<br/>

&gt; I agree, I think that we should all assemble on one day, in one area. Then<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; petition for a GM. While we wait, we send alot of FEEDBACK reports, asking<br/>
&gt; Verant to finally balance the enchanter. When the GM comes, he/she will<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; that we are serious (hopefully). Tell me what you think.<br/>
