<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404925388">Add 2p to each of those prices. That&#39;s what I sell them for, and I don&#39;t<br/>
have any problems. Just use those prices as a guideline though. If someone<br/>
is nice and polite, knock off a little. If they are rude and demanding,<br/>
don&#39;t budge an inch.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note: Do NOT make any enchanted jewelry unless you have a buyer<br/>
for it. People not following that simple guideline are largely responsible<br/>
for the plummeting prices. (I.E., Tradesman makes 10 +2 int rings. Sells 2<br/>
right off the bat for 8p each. 2 hours later he still has 8 rings. He drops<br/>
his price to 7p each. No takers. An hour later, frustrated and just wanting<br/>
to unload the things he drops his price to 5p each. Sells 4 of em. Still has<br/>
4. Does a special auction at 3p each to free up his inventory slots. Now<br/>
EVERYONE expects those +2 int rings to sell for 3p. Get the picture?)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry... kinda ranted a little there...<br/>

&gt; I have searched back a couple digests, and haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; found an answer and figured this would be quicker.<br/>
&gt; I am an Enchanter on the Karana server, and have<br/>
&gt; a Jewelery skill lvl of about 41.  I have been <br/>
&gt; making enchanted jeweler for a while, but don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; really have a firm grasp on what kind of base <br/>
&gt; prices I should be charging.  Here is a list of <br/>
&gt; prices I am charging now.  Could I get some<br/>
&gt; feedback on what others are charging, and maybe<br/>
&gt; set up a Merchants Co-operative to set prices for<br/>
&gt; our market on Karana.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; +2 Agility rings 3pp<br/>
&gt; +2 Dexterity Braclets 4pp<br/>
&gt; +2 int rings 5pp<br/>
&gt; +2 strength rings 6pp<br/>
&gt; Jaded Silver rings 7pp<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I usually give up to 1pp off if someone buys 2 at<br/>
&gt; a time.  Just wondering what the rest of you sell<br/>
&gt; for.  I don&#39;t want to undercut the market, but <br/>
&gt; then again I Don&#39;t want to sell to high.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think if we set up a Jewelery Co-operative we <br/>
&gt; may be able to set higher prices for our wares.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
