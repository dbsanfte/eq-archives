<div id="ygrps-yiv-772618918">uh, no they took care of that &quot;abuse&quot; long ago, or didn&#39;t you know that<br/>
monsters can run through walls if need be. They also can see through<br/>
walls and thus can cast at you through them, not to mention that if they<br/>
do get &quot;stuck&quot; they now teleport to you.<br/>

&gt; The problem that everyone is having with casting Alliance is related to<br/>
&gt; Line-of-Sight.  They added some code a ways back to keep casters from<br/>
&gt; abusing<br/>
&gt; quick xp gains from monsters inside buildings and on the other side of<br/>
&gt; walls.  The counter is in the way and EQ thinks it&#39;s a wall so you won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; able to cast from the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; side opposite him unless you stand on the counter or get on the same side as<br/>
&gt; him.<br/>
