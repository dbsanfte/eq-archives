&gt; The real complaint is that I know players who have spent 500p or more<br/>
&gt; on a sacrificial dagger for the melee hand and 2000p for the mug.  now<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve wasted money they could have spent elsewhere.  I have no<br/>
&gt; concern about the quest being made more difficult.  they should do<br/>
&gt; that, indeed.  Changing the nature of an object people have spent their<br/>
&gt; entire fortunes on is unfair and will lead to many outraged players.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If any type of Mage has 2500pp to drop on two items, I don&#39;t think money is<br/>
a major concern.  How do you fight with a Stien anyway?  Is it a new melee<br/>
catagory?  I can see the message now &quot;Your skill in Bar Room Brawls has<br/>
increased (36)&quot;</div>
