<div id="ygrps-yiv-731326690">Since my charisma is in the 150&#39;s I really don&#39;t have a resist problem. In<br/>
Sol A, I was having about an 85% success rate with the assorted fire/inferno<br/>
gobs. We were routinely taking those 6-8 at a time. Experiment with it some<br/>
more, I think you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised once you learn its area of<br/>
effect.<br/>

&gt; I had that happen the other night in Solusek.  Couldn&#39;t help but get too <br/>
&gt; close and got myself and half the gobs in the room resisted.  I use the<br/>
&gt; area <br/>
&gt; mes sparingly.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I agree with you on everything except one. If my party is fighting 3 or<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt;  creatures I don&#39;t bother with Enthrall. My mainstay in that case is<br/>
&gt;  mesmerization. I was in a party in Permafrost the other day and the tank<br/>
&gt;  pulled 14(!) assorted ice goblins. There were some hairy moments in that<br/>
&gt;  battle with lack of communication between 2 of the tanks, but then score<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt;  the end was Party:14 Goblins:0. Don&#39;t underestimate that AE mesmerize,<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt;  don&#39;t stand too close.. hehe. &gt;&gt;<br/>
