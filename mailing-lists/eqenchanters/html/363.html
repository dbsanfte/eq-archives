<div id="ygrps-yiv-513255869">Hello, I am a fellow enchanter and I am looking for a favor. I play<br/>
Qumen an 8th level High Elf Enchanter on the Innoruuk server. What I am<br/>
looking for is for someone to help finance my selected trade of jewel<br/>
craft. I have a skill of 25 and have run into one small stumbling block,<br/>
cash flow. If someone is willing to help with financing I would be<br/>
willing to share magic items, profits, or any other arrangement that we<br/>
can agree upon. Wouldn&#39;t it be neat to start a trade guild to help<br/>
newbie jewelers with this problem. I am sure I am not the first with<br/>
this experience.</div>
