<div id="ygrps-yiv-94241715">Without magic or some special effect, ground speed is the same for all<br/>
unencumbered individuals.  It SEEMS faster with a smaller race than a<br/>
larger race, because your perception is actually different.  Ogres seem<br/>
slow as all get out because they are really big, and everything looks<br/>
tiny to them, including the ground.  They don&#39;t cover as much<br/>
proportional to their size as a gnome, so it seems like the gnome is<br/>
zipping along and the ogre is plodding, when, in fact, they are going<br/>
the exact same speed.<br/>
<br/>
As an enchanter, you can see the effects.  Cast illusion gnome, for<br/>
those of you cursed with being other than a gnome, and see how fast you<br/>
seem to move.  With the exact same weight, agility, etc, change form to<br/>
an ogre, and see how slow you seem to go.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a matter of perception.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in a party, if you&#39;re travelling from point A to point B without<br/>
benefit of a druid, shaman, or bard, in a situation with no client or<br/>
server side lag, notice how the group does not drift apart as you run.<br/>
<br/>
Just my observations.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ground speed is affected by agility and your current weight.  is not easily<br/>
&gt; noticed except with SoW or Selo&#39;s, since it magnifies the effect.  I first<br/>
&gt; noticed the problem with my enchanter, a human, and a human cleric...<br/>
&gt; neither were encumbered, but my enchanter was running much faster than the<br/>
&gt; cleric.  the only difference was his higher strength had him carrying more<br/>
&gt; pounds.  My Druid wood elf and a wood elf ranger, same agility.... druid was<br/>
&gt; faster, less weight.  my druid vrs one with a agility buff, the agi buff one<br/>
&gt; was slightly faster, but when I got my agi to 100, I could keep up with the<br/>
&gt; buffed one, (in the 120s).  We did those while at the same weight.... done<br/>
&gt; at different weights, the heavy one always lagged behind.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Conclusions...<br/>
&gt; Weight is deciding factor... encumbrance only decreases your agility to slow<br/>
&gt; you down, but each pound slows you as well.<br/>
&gt; Agility is a factor, but only to 100... which is max groundspeed at 0 weight<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have 101 agility, SoW, and keep my weight around 55 pounds.  I can run<br/>
&gt; circles around anyone in my guild, even the other shamans and druids.<br/>
