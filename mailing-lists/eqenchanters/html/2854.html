&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Is an Agnostic DE Enchanter KoS in Erudin?<br/>
&gt;I was late getting beck to the office over lunch and had just received the<br/>
&gt;Erud&#39;s Tonic from the Erudite in the library using illusion Halfelf and<br/>
&gt;Alliance. I am &quot;parked&quot; in front of the illusion merchant on the 2nd floor<br/>
&gt;and bound at the wood bridge in NK.<br/>

I tested this myself a while ago and I seem to recall that for the<br/>
most part I wasn&#39;t KoS there.  I didn&#39;t check every NPC in Erudin, but<br/>
I remember being safe near the guards.  Unless faction has changed<br/>
recently, you should be ok.<br/>
<br/>
But just to confuse things, watch out if there are any visiting snooty<br/>
elves around.  I think I spotted one somewhere, may have been the<br/>
enchanter guild.  All the normal erudites were dubious to me.  There&#39;s<br/>
a sneaky high elf sitting up there that is KoS, so be careful.<br/>
