Speaking of charm, a friend of mine was charmed by an evil eye (I think<br/>
that was monster).  From his perspective he got a message that said he<br/>
had lost control and his character was directed off toward a group of<br/>
players.  Happily he regained control before nearing them.  This brought<br/>
a couple of questions to mind.  Would his charmed self have been able to<br/>
attack other players?  I&#39;m thinking yes... but not sure.  What happens<br/>
if he dies?  Do they loot him?  I&#39;m thinking no... but again not sure.<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>
