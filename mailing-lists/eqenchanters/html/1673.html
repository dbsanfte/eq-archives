This is the way all enchanters spells are and were. We were once nerfed and<br/>
then to compensate us for the hard tiem we had at low levle all spells below<br/>
level 16 were made partially resistable. Normally our spells are pass or<br/>
fail no partial damage, and have a higher rate of resists then other<br/>
classes. learn to love tashan and learn to wait about 2 levles to use your<br/>
new spells. It&#39;s worth it in the long run, provided you aren&#39;t playing the<br/>
enchanter as a poor mans wizard.<br/>

&gt;I recently hit level 16 with my enchanter, and got some great new spells<br/>
&gt;like Chase the Moon, Sanity Warp, etc...but I have noticed a drastic<br/>
&gt;increase in the frequency my spells are resisted. Green cons consistantly<br/>
&gt;resist Sanity Warp, the same monsters that I killed with Chaotic Feedback<br/>
&gt;when they were blue cons. I have begun using Tashan again (Ever since level<br/>
&gt;10 or so, I stopped using it), and Tashan seems to help the situation. I<br/>
&gt;just think it is strange that I am having such a problem with monsters<br/>
&gt;resisting more powerful spells, when lesser spells seemed to work on them<br/>
&gt;great at lower levels. For instance, wisps now con green, but often resist<br/>
&gt;Sanity Warp. I was murdering wisps with Chaotic Feedback just two levels<br/>
&gt;ago. Same thing is happening with monsters I am just now starting to fight<br/>
&gt;alot, like crocs in the Oasis, undead in Unrest, and Borer and Scythe<br/>
&gt;Beetles in the Karanas. I am at a loss. Anyone else experience this kind of<br/>
&gt;thing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can&#39;t wait for Tashani...<br/>
