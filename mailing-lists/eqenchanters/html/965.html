 </span></blockquote>Where in the game does it say these spells are supposed to stun?  You<br/>
may have read this description on someone&#39;s web page, but I doubt<br/>
anyone at Verant said that it would stun.  I seem to recall them saying<br/>
that the spells would shock rather than stun.  The shock effect causes<br/>
a spellcaster to be interrupted.  Try it on a spell casting mob.  I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten it to work on Orc oracles.  Hit one of the chaos flux types as<br/>
soon as you see their grubby little hands glow and you can fizzle their spell.<br/>
