&gt;   I am in the process of attempting to start my epic<br/>
&gt; quest. (again) When I <br/>
&gt; created Galadriana, I was pretty much clueless about<br/>
&gt; what religion I should <br/>
&gt; pick and so forth. I for some reason chose Rodcet<br/>
&gt; Nife, well what a mistake <br/>
&gt; THAT was. I cast illusion drybone on myself.. but<br/>
&gt; the spec&#39;s killed me <br/>
&gt; because of my god.. next time I casted improved<br/>
&gt; invis on myself and got thru <br/>
&gt; everything  including the spec&#39;s BUT  as soon as I<br/>
&gt; cast collaboration on <br/>
&gt; reania the other guild masters instantly killed me,<br/>
&gt; because of my religion. <br/>
&gt;   I am currently working on the crate quest in<br/>
&gt; qeynos to up my faction with <br/>
&gt; opaldarkbriar, and I&#39;ve smacked old Neclo Rheslar in<br/>
&gt; west karana several <br/>
&gt; times too. (opal is the necro guildmaster under<br/>
&gt; freeport) . Does anyone have <br/>
&gt; any tips or hints or any suggestions as to what I<br/>
&gt; can do that could help me <br/>
&gt; start this part of my epic so i dont get killed<br/>
&gt; every single time??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thanks, <br/>
