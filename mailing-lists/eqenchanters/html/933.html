<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000009969">Whirl til you hurl used to be a reliable, 15 seconds of monster stunning.<br/>
As long as the spell was not resisted (and it was resisted at the same<br/>
fairly high rate of most of our spells) it was 99% reliable.  Some things<br/>
such as certain bard songs could break it.  This made an enchanter of great<br/>
value to a group.<br/>
 <br/>
Now however, assuming you get past the resist<br/>
1.  Any stun breaks whirl (including bashes from warriors)<br/>
2.  Any of the Chaotic Feedback line of spells break whirl.<br/>
3.  Any hit as a 1 in (either 12 or 20 I suspect 12) chance to break whirl<br/>
4.  Mob gets a saving throw every tick or so (6seconds) to break whirl<br/>
5.  Level limits on how high of monster you can whirl.<br/>
 <br/>
Now, add this up, and you get whirl being essentially a higher mana, no AE<br/>
color flux, as its duration is now close to 2-5 seconds.  It goes from being<br/>
the best L12 spell to being essentially worthless.  Admittedly, it is<br/>
overpowering at higher levels, but that could have been fixed by the level<br/>
limits alone.  This from a class which is the hardest in the game to level,<br/>
fewest in number, and now least useful in a group.<br/>

Subject: [eqenchanters] Enchanter Update?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know that they havemad changes to the Enchanter Class but What exactly<br/>
have they changed. I have not noticed any changes as of yet and I am just<br/>
wodering if all the debate and talk of strking is because people just don&#39;t<br/>
like change or if it is actually as bad as people are saying. I have no<br/>
problem protesting if I believe the change was not for good. I would really<br/>
appreciate a run down on what they have changed. Someone made referance to<br/>
spells that were weekened. What did the spell do before the update and what<br/>
does it do now?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks<br/>
