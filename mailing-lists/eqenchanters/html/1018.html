<div id="ygrps-yiv-670495430">Hail and that sort!<br/>
<br/>
Seems this email group is going adrift. Let me first insert my 2c into this<br/>
whole mess, then you can flame me or we move forward or whatever.<br/>
I play a level 30 Enchanter on Rellos Zek server (+PvP). To start let me<br/>
say I have been playing EQ since the phase 4 beta. Then I was playing as an<br/>
Oger Warrior (up to level 20) and an Enchanter (up to level 5).  Many of<br/>
the spells did not work for Enchanters then at all, but it was still a very<br/>
interesting class to play.<br/>
Now I am currently guild ed with over 50+ members of all classes and races<br/>
across the board and have grouped with every class, even other Enchanters.<br/>
Through out my characters life, I spent most of it playing solo, yes solo,<br/>
prolly 80% solo.  That is just my preference, not how things worked out.<br/>
First, let me say soloing an Enchanter is as tough, maybe the hardest to<br/>
solo, yet other classes have just as much of a hard time soloing (least<br/>
some of them).  It all comes down to keeping buff&#39;s on, or whatever you can<br/>
do for your class.  Early on, I found we are the most resisted class in the<br/>
game, there for I made Tashan my first spell I cast on a mob period, even<br/>
recast if it&#39;s resisted for it rarely draw&#39;s the attention of the mob.  I<br/>
also noticed, the mob&#39;s would always be happy w/ my pet if I backed outta<br/>
the fight a bit, thus killing my pet pretty quickly.  To give my pet a rest<br/>
from tanking, I&#39;d cast my DoT (Damage over Time), maybe a weaken or<br/>
enfeeble, then step into the fight, taking the hits from the mob. If you<br/>
work your attack to where you take half, the pet takes half (half to you is<br/>
2-3 bubbles of health), you&#39;ll always come out the victor. The key was to<br/>
split the damage from the mob between you and your pet.  Another thing that<br/>
helped greatly is knowing when any character class solo&#39;s, they should<br/>
stick to blue con&#39;s, they pay less exp compared to the rest, but once you<br/>
find your grove, you&#39;ll always come out far ahead. As for even fights,<br/>
gambles, and tombstones, save them for when you group. If your not fighting<br/>
those when your grouped (3+ party members and a well rounded group I might<br/>
add) your either going after special items, or wasting your time (heh or<br/>
just enjoying the sights of the game). Just remember, each class has there<br/>
pluses and minuses and a particular way of applying them.  Currently, when<br/>
I solo, I start off with Tashani, Suffocate, whirl, Chaos Flux, whirl,<br/>
Chaos Flux... and so on.  When I first cast, I&#39;ll pull the mob to a<br/>
semi-safe area so it is less likely I&#39;ll be jumped by another mob in the<br/>
fight.  Once it hits me, I&#39;ll back off always, allowing my pet to keep it&#39;s<br/>
attention, giving myself plenty of room to get suffocate and whirl off.  At<br/>
times, whirl will be resisted, so I&#39;ll either step in, take a few hits, and<br/>
try to cast a DD (Direct Damage) spell, or whirl again depending on how<br/>
hard I&#39;m being hit.  I think this highlights the importance of keeping your<br/>
melee skills up. I use 2h blunt normally, but also keep my hand to hand and<br/>
piercing skills up.  I will have all of them max for my level usually by<br/>
the 2nd or 3rd bubble into the level.  As well, I keep my different schools<br/>
of magic max ed out as well, Conjuration being the hardest to keep up.  In<br/>
the cases I am overwhelmed by a mob, or more than one mob, I&#39;ll use<br/>
Enthrall (or Mesmerize) to &#39;stun&#39; the 2nd mob, finish off the first with my<br/>
pet, then either run like the wind while the pet hold&#39;s off the 2nd, or<br/>
finish it as well.  This also helps keeping my conj. max ed.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I&#39;d like to stress, each class has it&#39;s strengths, and<br/>
weaknesses, as well, each has a particular style to being played.  It has<br/>
been stated by many people who know the design of the game that Enchanters<br/>
are the most powerful class in the game. Personally I feel this is a pretty<br/>
vague statement, although I do tend to believe this to be true, possibly at<br/>
level 50, possibly at one point, which, I do not know. Either way,<br/>
Enchanters do have it rough, as do many other classes, it all comes down to<br/>
how do you want to play. Do you want to be on the front lines, taking the<br/>
hits, saving the magic wielding classes from attack? Would you prefer<br/>
sitting in the back, keeping a sharp eye on your friends health, keeping<br/>
the up and fighting? Yet maybe you prefer a different approach. Weather a<br/>
Warrior, Cleric, or even an Enchanter, we all have abilities that are<br/>
unique, it comes down to how you want to play, and apply them for yourself,<br/>
or your group. <br/>
On a side note, I dont know where this subject came from on switching<br/>
servers, it seems to be popular on this group as well as others.  It also<br/>
seems that many of you assume that everything will be transferred when a<br/>
character is moved. Im sure that is a possibility, who know what<br/>
restrictions they will place upon us if they do allow us to switch.  Either<br/>
case, I see no harm what so ever allowing people to switch server, even the<br/>
one&#39;s mentioned here are very weak reasons for not allowing people to move.<br/>
 Many of us have friends on other servers, as well some of us play on the<br/>
more popular servers finding them full from time to time. Wouldn&#39;t you like<br/>
the ability to play your character, weather the server is full, or you just<br/>
wanna play with your friends? Frankly I think this should be allowed, with<br/>
certain limitations applied. Possibly the loss of your bank, only what you<br/>
carry may be moved to the other server, possibly nothing but the character<br/>
alone.  Also note, there are events only on some servers that are not on<br/>
others (player run, role play and so on) that people did not know existed<br/>
when they first bought the game, and wish to join them but not start from<br/>
scratch. As for you people who feel, you picked it, stick w/ it, I&#39;ve gotta<br/>
say you people have a total lack of consideration for others and your own<br/>
self worth. Let me ask you this, have you ever purchased something you<br/>
found you had no need for and returned it for something else? Well that<br/>
would be the same lines of me saying you bought it, live with it.  Argue<br/>
all you like, but making a blunt statement of live with it, has got to be<br/>
the most inconsiderate comments by far. We all dont live in your world, and<br/>
what&#39;s right for you may not be right for someone else.  Frankly, people as<br/>
yourself are one of the biggest reasons I elected to play +PvP, and I can<br/>
say thank god your not at the design controls of Everquest, you must be a<br/>
programmer from UO.<br/>
Let me finish this rant by opening some lines of communication. First I<br/>
totally agree that Enchanters took a very hard hit here recently on the<br/>
spell changes. I too have sent emails, feedback, and even submitted a<br/>
couple bug reports over this, along with making a few open comments in a<br/>
petition. We have many methods of sending our concerns to Veriant about in<br/>
game changes, and pulling together and all sending in the same to them<br/>
helps greatly! Having a &#39;black&#39; day or not playing a day I think is an end<br/>
all extreme, and outright impossible. There are just to many people who do<br/>
not read the message boards, or whatnot that something like this would have<br/>
an effect on outside of yourself not playing the character of your choice.<br/>
Why make things worse on yourself, for obviously the in game changes have<br/>
caused enough upset. Play on, if you wish to do some kind of in game act,<br/>
possibly everyone meet in a common place all races could travel to, and set<br/>
forth a petition for a GM to hear from the entire group in a meeting in<br/>
game. This would have the same effect, as well as bring Enchanters<br/>
together, let us all gain from one another experiences and possibly<br/>
share/tade info, languages, and research items.  Sorry, but I do not feel<br/>
avoiding my Enchanter on a particular day will have any effect on Veriant<br/>
at all. As I mentioned before, we have 4 methods of communicating our<br/>
concerns to Veriant, I say use them all in cases such as this, that is what<br/>
is herd, and read, and helps Veriant understand how we feel about what<br/>
changes they bring about in our world.<br/>
Now, on a more class related note, I&#39;ve found Tomb pages 43 and 44. I&#39;ve<br/>
never seen them posted anywhere about so I&#39;ve no clue what they combine to<br/>
make for when I attempted to do so, I failed. My research skill is current<br/>
46, so either they are much higher than my current skill, or I&#39;ve herd if<br/>
the spell they make is of higher level than myself, I will always fail.<br/>
Either way, I feel this is very good news and I have high hopes of finding<br/>
more new research items/spells that are now known.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your ear and listening to my 2c,<br/>
