<div id="ygrps-yiv-561693829">At 24th (with maxed divination skill) I know, Illuison Earth Elemental will<br/>
last 30 minutes. They now seem to last more than long enough to do whatever<br/>
you need to do under them.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a few general questions about the Illusion spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember before the patch that extended the length of time an illusion<br/>
&gt; stayed in place, it lasted a few minutes. How long do they last now?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1. WTH: doesn&#39;t seem to be as great as it used to be, but I still find it<br/>
useful. I find it more effective than root when one or more people need to<br/>
back off from melee. You must remember to have your tanks kick instead of<br/>
bash when you cast this (which is the main problem because your animation<br/>
will always bash). And if you&#39;re fighting a caster, you can still WTH till<br/>
it drops.<br/>
<br/>
2. These also stack with choke. Again, better for PvP, but they do drop the<br/>
probablity of a MOB hitting for max damage.<br/>
<br/>
3.Enthrall lasts ALOT longer than mezmerize. Up to 50 seconds, depending on<br/>
MOB level, ones 25 and over it seems to last a shorter time on.<br/>
<br/>
4. The speed boost does not rise as you advance in levels, but the duration<br/>
of the spell does. The medition boost of clarity does raise with levels.<br/>
<br/>
I like to enthrall first, tashani, pace, disempower, meditate, then choke it<br/>
as it comes in. At 18 with a necro or a magician partner, you can start<br/>
doing rooks in S Karana. At 22 (it&#39;s iffy at 21) an enchanter and a necro<br/>
can do harriers. Then at 23, it&#39;s lumberjack time.<br/>

&gt; 1. Whirl till you Hurl - is this useful at all anymore ? I heard that it<br/>
&gt; used to be a 15 second guaranteed stun and enchanters did nothing but<br/>
&gt; whirl all day, and now it&#39;s nerfed to uselessness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Disempower and Enfeeblement. I cast both on myself, and lost 54 str and<br/>
&gt; 71 agi. I can see that I can waste a tank in PvP with these spells but are<br/>
&gt; they useful against MOBS ? Do MOBs have str, agi and other stats, or just<br/>
&gt; ac and atk ? Currently I do not use these spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. I&#39;m still using mesmerize. Why is enthrall better ? Lower resists ?<br/>
