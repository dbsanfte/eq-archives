<div id="ygrps-yiv-119655266">With 103 charisma I buy raw materials, make items, and sell finished<br/>
items for a 2 copper loss.  I am currently working with Jasper so have a<br/>
few steps to go before I can begin work with Jade or other &quot;magical&quot;<br/>
level gems.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if electrum with Malachite is the place to start after mastering<br/>
silver (not there yet) when are the 1st &quot;magical&quot; gem combinations in<br/>
that metal?  Is it from the beginning or near Jade again?<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
Shawn<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Something has been nagging me of late. Not that it would change anything<br/>
in<br/>
my desire to master jewelry, but has any of you yet reached a skill<br/>
level<br/>
where you gained more money than you put in in the first place by using<br/>
this craft?.<br/>
<br/>
- please separate unenchanted and enchanted items made.<br/>
<br/>
Ibnabeth /Karana<br/>
(running a 7% steady loss from the start - not taking in account failed<br/>
attempts) <br/>
