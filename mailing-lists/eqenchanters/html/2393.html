<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222407184">Stun does not effect any of the Mez linbe of spells.... you may see the <br/>
msg that they have been stunned but it doesn&#39;t break the entrall or dazzle <br/>
or whatever...  also stun only acts as a taunt do to the mobs who haven&#39;t <br/>
bein personally attacked,  meaning your puller may have brought 4 mobs back <br/>
but only hit one... so only one has any real aggro when you stun it ticks <br/>
off the ones that don&#39;t have a specific aggro.<br/>
   Also i have a question,  heh  has anyone else noticed that if you are the <br/>
first to cast... (and no matter what you cast) tashan, tashani, tashania...  <br/>
is seems the Mobs  tend to like you alot...  but only if i&#39;m the first the <br/>
cast....  (this is without any taunt type spells cast on it). has anyone <br/>
else noticed this or am i dreamin?  hehe<br/>
   One last this i really like this e-mail list it helps me get more info <br/>
than anyother place due to real applications of things said... thanks guys<br/>
