<div id="ygrps-yiv-477881337">heyas all i was just curious what you all thought about these two spells<br/>
beign removed from the game. I mean we are supposed to be enchanters right<br/>
but the only things we can enchant or metals which seem to not do to much<br/>
for us considering they sell for less then they cost for us to make them.<br/>
Are the peopl at EQ going to give us other enchantments maybe something that<br/>
lets us add a fire effect or a ice effect to a weapon something that will at<br/>
least be of service to us. I dont know i may be wrong on this but i dont<br/>
find it fair for are enchantment spells to be taken away we are supposed to<br/>
be enchanters not another form or wizard<br/>
