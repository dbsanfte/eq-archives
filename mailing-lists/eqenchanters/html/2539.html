I signed up for &#39;free DSL&#39; a while back.  My computer drive was totally <br/>
messed up by the &#39;trial download&#39; and I have had to buy/install a new one <br/>
.. losing half my &#39;life&#39; in the process.  NEVER AGAIN!<br/>

  Hi..<br/>
    This will be the only spam you ever receive from me and the only reason <br/>
I&#39;m sending this one is cause it&#39;s for free dsl and everyone wants free dsl <br/>
right =)? I know I could use a faster hook up and it&#39;s $60 a month for dsl <br/>
connection to the net for me here. I signed up and it seems cool and no <br/>
real adds to speak of at the moment. Well enough said, they&#39;re working on a <br/>
first com first serve basis so if you interested don&#39;t wait to long. Just <br/>
click the link below. Have fun guys..<br/>
