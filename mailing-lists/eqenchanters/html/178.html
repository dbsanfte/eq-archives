<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504460266">not to name any names but since they are char nbames and I dont know if they<br/>
exist stilli ngame or not......but Tormod and Nosferum are two taht come to<br/>
mind as a freind and I played with those two quite often in Beta up in<br/>
Halas......great guys by the way.....but they were VERY helpful in the3ir<br/>
info and had told us on many occcasions of friends that they had and ppl<br/>
they knew that were around from teh beginning which wwould be the ORIGINAL<br/>
beta testers......these two guys are both authors of EQSS essays and guides<br/>
and they were a couple of the BEST players I hugn out with in<br/>
Beta.......money talks and BS walks......I WATCHED these guys put the<br/>
numbers down and if anyone can SHOW you how good they are or just WHAT<br/>
certain strategies do for you......I will certainly belive this over what<br/>
ppl have &quot;heard&quot;......and as for Stratics not being PERFECT.....I didnt say<br/>
they were perfect......but a majority of thier INFO is pretty DAMN close<br/>
except for minor details here and there......the fact that they dont have<br/>
&quot;Large/Medium&quot; for armor under barbarians.....heh....it might just be a<br/>
typo.......point being....I could email you sumthin that said &quot;I just<br/>
finished a study saying this this and this skill are better then aynthign<br/>
else becuase of this this and that.....blah blah blah&quot;.......and you could<br/>
belive it or not belive it........but if you actually see teh essay printed<br/>
up and PUBLIC you better belive sumone has gone thru the time to be as<br/>
detailed and informative as possible......and most of th stuff that Stratics<br/>
puts up is pretty good .......whats the real problem here ppl......just GO<br/>
WITH IT!!!......why is there always a need to PROVE the ppl wrong......I<br/>
dont know just seems like ppl are more worried about putting things down and<br/>
arguing facts.....instead of just playing the game......part of this game is<br/>
number crunching especially for an analytical mind like mine who plays paper<br/>
games.......but Im tellin you the more detailed you get in your numbers the<br/>
less enjoyment you will gain playing the actual game......dont play the<br/>
NUMBER GAME....play the EVERQUEST GAME!!!......I learned this thrui<br/>
beta.....I had the hardest time dealing with the numbers of different chars<br/>
and what to play and what not to play due to this and that .......well SCREW<br/>
IT!!!.......youll end up frustrated and without direction....find what YOU<br/>
WANT TO PLAY and just go play it......as soon as I did this I fell in love<br/>
with my char and I havent worried about numbers since........my rants over<br/>
guys you can wake up now!!!.....I SAID GET YOUR HEADS OFF THE<br/>
KEYBOARD!!!!.....hehehehe...your gonna have lines in your face.....<br/>
