<div id="ygrps-yiv-83510772">I myself found this line very unreliable until pacify. It reduces agro<br/>
range, it does not eliminate it. You have to know the exact pathing to use<br/>
it well. If you do cast the spell on a critter, then pull one over it,<br/>
whatever you have calmed will most likely come also. You should start on the<br/>
farthest one in pathing and work toward you, pulling the closest. Harmony,<br/>
while much more reliable, is outdoor only. I&#39;ve used pacify to split spider<br/>
camps in the Dreadlands and also  in Lower Guk to pull safe hall spawns solo<br/>
(had to something while waiting for a group). When the spell is resisted and<br/>
the target doesn&#39;t agro, I will toss mem blur. It can be slow, it can be<br/>
unsuccessful, but when it does work, you will amaze your group. Especially<br/>
in a dungeon situation, I just tell the puller if it&#39;s less than 5, pull it,<br/>
we can handle it. And in anywhere near a good group, we do.<br/>
