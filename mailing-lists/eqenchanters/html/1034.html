<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606344645">Just beginning to discover their usefullness?  We have already discovered their<br/>
usefullness but as soon as we utilize it you take it away from us.  As soon<br/>
as we have developed stragies that work well in parties you remove our effectiveness.<br/>
 What a load of &lt;irreverant words removed here&gt;.<br/>

&quot;&lt;SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE&gt;: Aradune: If I offended any enchanters last night, it<br/>
was not my intent,<br/>
rather it was to encourage you to explore your unique classes abilities, which<br/>
are very important<br/>
in dungeons such as Mistmoore and other caster-heavy areas.&quot;<br/>
&quot;&lt;SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE&gt;: Aradune: so my apologies if you took offense, but I do<br/>
believe that<br/>
enchanters are a very valuable but very unique class, and people are just beginning<br/>
to discover<br/>
their usefullness. hang in there:)&quot;<br/>
