&gt;Hi!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m level 12 and I just got Charm and I&#39;m wondering if the duration will<br/>
&gt;increase as I go up in level?  I know charisma is an important factor<br/>
&gt;for this spell, and right now, with all my charisma gear on I have about<br/>
&gt;99 chr.  Right now Charm only lasts a few seconds, not long enough to do<br/>
&gt;anything useful with it..  Should I just hold on to it for a few levels<br/>
&gt;and use it later?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ezrae<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t find it useful until about level 18-20 then I began to use it all<br/>
the time and maxed out my charisma. I used it extensively after that and yes<br/>
on average it does last longer but its never foolproof and you should have<br/>
some plan for bad breaks. <br/>
