<br/>
&gt;The only way not to get resisted and works 100% of the time is to get up<br/>
&gt;real close.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does that really work?  Resists based on distance?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I do tend to forget often that I am not a tank too and melee a lot, but that<br/>
&gt;is ok as we share damage together.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, I do the same thing.  Often I mele a bit too much and get put<br/>
back in my place.<br/>
I don&#39;t stay there long though, cause next fight (after I&#39;m healed), I&#39;m<br/>
meleing again.<br/>
The bad thing is, usually as soon as I step in and I don&#39;t even have to<br/>
start meleing, the mob just turns to<br/>
attack me and I get hit for too much damage.  With my ruined totem staff,<br/>
its just too hard to resist meleing.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if many other enchanters mele too much also?<br/>
