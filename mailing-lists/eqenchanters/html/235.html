<div id="ygrps-yiv-691000172">Hail,<br/>
I would like to impart with some knowledge I have gleamed tonight.<br/>
I, a level 10 Enchanter, was grouped with 2 level 16 friends and a level<br/>
14.....and I was GAINING EXP!!!!  woohoo, yeehaa and all that.  Please post<br/>
if there are other out there with similar experiences, i was under the<br/>
impression that there was a 5 level limit on this, starting at level 5 ( 3<br/>
for under that ), does anyone know the true cap for this, or is this a bug i<br/>
should not exploit?<br/>
