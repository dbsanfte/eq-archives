<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401234358">Ok heres the situation. At level 28 or 29 I went to nektulos Forest with<br/>
some friends and we killed Guards and corporals for loot. We sometimes drew<br/>
overpulls but beguile let us escape them, usually by charming a guard to<br/>
fight the corporal. Today we dicided to go to Solusek and as I waited for my<br/>
friends someone pulled the corporal and two guards. All three were dark<br/>
green to me at level 32.<br/>
The Corporal on walking apst came at me and I tashani&#39;d him and tried to<br/>
beguile him. And failed. 8 times in a row. I killed it the old fashioned way<br/>
and thenwhen my friends came we experimented. $ casts on Dark green guards<br/>
all after tashani all resisted. Another 8 casts on Corporals also after<br/>
tashani everyone resisted. <br/>
<br/>
I was mad as hell. This isn&#39;t a random number problem this is deliberately<br/>
making a mob that I should ahve a chance of charming IMMUNE to it. When I<br/>
travel solo I have a choice, I always go with a pet spell memmed or with<br/>
beguile. Usually beguile because my other spell mix is geared to flight<br/>
rather then fight. I used to be fairly certain that with 160 charisma I<br/>
could reasonably expect to succeed in a charm of a green. Now that faith is<br/>
gone. What other random mobs has Verant decided to make IMMUNE to one of the<br/>
Major spells we Enchanters rely on? How many deaths am I going to face<br/>
discovering these little changes. I feedbacked it.<br/>
I petitioned it. I got a tell from a GM or Guide that siad they couldn&#39;t<br/>
discuss game mechanic changes but there was something in the news file. I<br/>
logged out to check the news file and didn&#39;t see anything so is there anyone<br/>
out there who can enlighten me as too what the guide or Gm was referring to?  <br/>
And what benefit did we get in exchange for making a spell that we could<br/>
reasonably count on now totally uncertain? I could understand making charm<br/>
spells harder to resist, but thats not what happened. They made a certain<br/>
mob type Immune to them and if they did it for one they probably did it for<br/>
others. <br/>
I think we need to ask Verant to undo this change, Charm spells are the core<br/>
of the Enchanter class and screwing around with them in that manner is<br/>
crazy. Thanks. Any help or comments are appreciated.  <br/>
