Personally I really like this skill they implemented,<br/>
And me well i think i&#39;m gonna put it in alteration<br/>
cause some of my Damage spells are alteration most of<br/>
my changing spells +root and group spells are<br/>
alteration. And Enchanters ARE supposed to control the<br/>
battles and morhp it to what they wan&#39;t. It would be<br/>
cool to cast faster and cheaper. Course you do have a<br/>
good point evocation is our major damage spells and<br/>
costs lots of mana and is needed for soloing. course<br/>
at higher levels it&#39;s really high to solo but for<br/>
enchanter&#39;s they can solo, so if you like soloing go<br/>
for evo. If you like to do both go ahead and put it in<br/>
Evo cause while everyoe is attackin you still have<br/>
&lt;Time&gt; which is the key part to this skill to cast<br/>
your debuff spells. Evo is slow and costly in mana.<br/>
for those of you that like to just go groups a lot<br/>
more than solo go ahead on alteration but me<br/>
personally i&#39;m gonna go through all spells and see<br/>
what skill they take than decide.<br/>
Also is there a list i can find to find all the<br/>
advantages an minor illusion has? Ie:<br/>
Darkelf get&#39;s ultra vision<br/>
Humans get&#39;s Bonus exp? I think?<br/>
i&#39;m not even sure but i think there is SOMEHOW an<br/>
advantage to each kind of race like the fire elemental<br/>
having super damage.<br/>
I could use a list like this.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; seems to be a good time to discuss specialization,<br/>
&gt; now that it is<br/>
&gt; available.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We can choose one primary specialization.  Which do<br/>
&gt; you guys plan to<br/>
&gt; choose?  Alteration seems to be the obvious choice<br/>
&gt; for enchanters, as<br/>
&gt; most of our bread and butter spells are of that<br/>
&gt; type.  However, our DD<br/>
&gt; spells are evocation and our illusions are<br/>
&gt; divination.  Do any of you<br/>
&gt; think that these spells are more important?  Is it<br/>
&gt; possible that an<br/>
&gt; enchanter specializing in evocation could go toe to<br/>
&gt; toe with a wizard? <br/>
&gt; Or is the spell delay issue still going to be a<br/>
&gt; problem?  Do any of you<br/>
&gt; spend your entire existence in an illusion form,<br/>
&gt; such as elemental or<br/>
&gt; spirit wolf?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s all put in our two coppers on specialization,<br/>
&gt; shall we?<br/>
