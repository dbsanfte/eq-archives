<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010963645">my suggestion to you, stay on silver for a while with pearl and topaz, a bit<br/>
expansive, but you will get to sell them back at least instead of having<br/>
constant failures. that is what i did, after those were done, i went on to<br/>
electrum and that black circle stone (forgot the name)<br/>
my skill is now 61 and i am very happy :)<br/>
every now and then i try a jade with electrum, i succedded once so it was<br/>
worth the attempt.<br/>
just remember if your not trivial at it, and you keep making it, it pays you<br/>
back, you only lose like 2gp on the sell back, and you can keep on buying<br/>
and trying.<br/>
another thing, i only buy one stone at a time, because if it becomes trivial<br/>
to me on that attempt, why the hell did i buy 5 more of them? now you sell<br/>
them back, and lost money.<br/>
i buy one, create it, sell it, buy another, create it, sell it...etc....<br/>
works for me :)<br/>
as soon as its trivial, i dont go to next stone, i skip a stone.<br/>

&gt; my skill level is still at 41......  I&#39;ve moved to electrum some<br/>
&gt; time ago....as Jade became trivial and the gems are hard to find (or far<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; travel to) in the Rare category....ie. Jade, Pearl and above<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; with about 20 to 25 attempts with Electrum and malachite, I suceeded<br/>
&gt; about 3 or 4 times....and not ONCE have I gotten a skill increase....<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going back to Pearl and Topaz with SILVER, I suppose....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve mentioned this in my editorial and I posted as a bug the high<br/>
&gt; failure<br/>
&gt; rates when working with combinations that are trivial.  I have a<br/>
&gt; respectable<br/>
&gt; wisdom of 90 something and a skill level of 40 something (been<br/>
&gt; playing other<br/>
&gt; characters so haven&#39;t leveled beyond 8 for a long... time) but I<br/>
&gt; fail SO<br/>
&gt; OFTEN with onyx and lower.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is there a relationship with difficulty of attempt (even when<br/>
&gt; trivial) and<br/>
&gt; the rate of failure?  In other words, will I continue to fail the<br/>
&gt; same rate<br/>
&gt; on average with a particular trivial combination even after raising<br/>
&gt; my skill<br/>
&gt; level by working on harder combinations first?  I think there&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; improvement to the failure rate on combinations that are pretty easy<br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; silver/onyx even as I improved my skill in the recent past.  With<br/>
&gt; that in<br/>
&gt; mind, I don&#39;t know if I should work with unenchanted electrum and<br/>
&gt; malachite<br/>
&gt; to improve my skill level if the rate of trivial failures remains<br/>
&gt; constant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any info or advice you might have.  If this is something<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; could ask someone or even better if there&#39;s a petition or list of<br/>
&gt; suggestions I would request one of the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Subject: Rate of failure on trivial metal/gem combinations too high<br/>
&gt; What:  With a respectable wisdom of 90ish there are far too many<br/>
&gt; failures<br/>
&gt; with trivial metal/gem combinations.  Failure rates are running 30%<br/>
&gt; to 50%<br/>
&gt; working with trivial items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Proposal:  Drastically lower the rate of failure for trivial items<br/>
&gt; (something less than 10%) or eliminate failures for trivial items<br/>
&gt; completely.    OR    Leave fail rates where they are but if you fail<br/>
&gt; making<br/>
&gt; a trivial combination you either get a non-magical item or you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; lose<br/>
&gt; anything and have to reenchant the metal or you just don&#39;t lose<br/>
&gt; anything.<br/>
&gt; Again, these are only for when an item is trivial.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why:  It makes sense to expect a skill gain with the known chance of<br/>
&gt; failure.  It makes no sense to fail often when there is zero chance<br/>
&gt; of skill<br/>
&gt; gain because the item is trivial.  If it IS trivial to make, why<br/>
&gt; would a<br/>
&gt; craftsman fail so often?  Trivial = easy = no learning = no skill<br/>
&gt; gain = low<br/>
&gt; failures<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What would happen:  Not really changing much except making the game<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; fun.  There will still be the current rate of failure for<br/>
&gt; non-trivial skill<br/>
&gt; gaining - so we won&#39;t be getting something for nothing.  This will<br/>
&gt; make<br/>
&gt; business more fun and less frustrating.  If there are certain items<br/>
&gt; that for<br/>
&gt; some reason should never be trivial then you could still fail at<br/>
&gt; them and<br/>
&gt; still gain experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
