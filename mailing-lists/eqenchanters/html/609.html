<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357562374">Jewelcraft is not broken.  You can get up to skill 40 with jade before<br/>
it becomes trivial.  Perhaps it went up and you didn&#39;t notice?  Maybe<br/>
you just need to make some more.  :)<br/>
<br/>
The going rate for Jaded Silver rings sold to PCs is 8P, don&#39;t<br/>
undersell them or you&#39;ll ruin the business for all of us.  Sometimes I<br/>
give a 1P discount to people who buy 2.  And selling to your friends is<br/>
an all together different story anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It cost me probably 50 P to get to skill 40.,  that&#39;s 50 P earned from<br/>
monsters, not including sell back money.  I&#39;ve had some serious bad<br/>
luck streaks.  lots of failures with jade and pearl.<br/>
