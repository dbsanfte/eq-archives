<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565182975">I didnt mean to show any attitude here. I rarely die with my enchanter<br/>
really. I&#39;ve been leveling faster than the people who play with me. I agree<br/>
that some parts need to be revised and I&#39;ve submitted my own list yesterday,<br/>
but the general idea I got from several e-mails here, was that people wanted<br/>
to quit their enchanters because they dont level fast enough. I dont want to<br/>
level too fast. I make sure I dont level too fast in fact. I want to visit<br/>
all areas of the world that are at my level while I still can. But that&#39;s my<br/>
own point of view. I didnt know about the agnostic thing for illusions since<br/>
I am agnostic. That sucks, it&#39;s true. But I&#39;ve seen dark elfs being killed<br/>
by their own guards after killing Dorn too many times. As a matter of fact,<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that most dark elf enchanters actually end being hated by their<br/>
guards...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you&#39;ll have to tell me where I&#39;m a masochist because I dont get it.<br/>

You know, you have a good point, but you ruin it with the attitude that<br/>
because we complain that our spells are ruined, and we are not balanced with<br/>
other casters, that we are automatically level hungry powergamers.  I think<br/>
it is you who miss the point.  I was one of the earlier enchanters because<br/>
the class sounded so like what I wanted in the manual.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier, there were no animations, and they were all in HK.  No problem.  We<br/>
adapted.<br/>
Okay, we got animations, now suddenly resists mysteriously become worse.<br/>
Okay, again we adapted, and waited four our promised Tashan upgrade.  We get<br/>
our Tashini, but wait, our most valuable spell is suddenly made worthless.<br/>
<br/>
All of this has nothing to do with powergaming level mongering.  Add in the<br/>
fact we need to be agnostic or illusions are worthless, stupid quirks with<br/>
minor illusions, and the utter complete lack of any viable enchanting, and<br/>
you discover why people are quitting the class in droves.  I&#39;m glad you like<br/>
it, but most of us are not into such masochism.<br/>

I had a level 16 dark elf necro that I started on the first day of the<br/>
release. It took me 4 &#39;played&#39; days and a half to get it to level 16. then I<br/>
gave it up. I have now a level 16 enchanter. It took me 12 &#39;played&#39; days to<br/>
make it to 16... You think that&#39;s a problem for me? I had so much more fun<br/>
playing an enchanter. What&#39;s the deal with this level race? Sometimes I&#39;ll<br/>
spend an hour travelling back and forth just to say hi to a friend I havent<br/>
seen for a long time. Right now, I&#39;m hunting in CrushBone and I barely make<br/>
any xp where I could be soloing in Lavastorm and make a shit load of xp and<br/>
money..but what&#39;s the big deal? I enjoy playing Everquest a lot more now.<br/>
Powergaming is so boring. So are those people who start a race everytime  a<br/>
new server comes up.<br/>
<br/>
my 2 cents,<br/>
