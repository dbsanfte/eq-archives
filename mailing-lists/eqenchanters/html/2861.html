<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941890316">Hi and welcome to the group!<br/>
<br/>
First off, you cant buy tiny daggers in quenos, you&#39;ll have to stock up in<br/>
erudin.  As far as your combat goes, that is about what you should be doing<br/>
at your level yes, dont worry about finding a group unless one is handily<br/>
available, and then you&#39;ll still be doing the same thing except you probably<br/>
wont use a pet.  Dont be afraid of shallow breath also... suffocating sphere<br/>
is a Damage over Time spell and multiple casts of it are somewhat redundant.<br/>
I would suggest suffocating sphere should be your first damage spell, all<br/>
subsequent damage spells should be Direct Damage (shallow breath).  You will<br/>
also want to get friendly with the spell &#39;mesmerize&#39;, its use is the staple<br/>
of the enchanter class.  Use it when your pet has died, to get some distance<br/>
or time so that you can recast your pet with no worries.  Simply put, it is<br/>
a 24 second stun spell which will break as soon as the target is hit with<br/>
damage or when the duration expires.  Dont overlook Color Flux also as a<br/>
great way to get a few steps ahead of a monster that is in your face.... but<br/>
dont use this spell near a guard or NPC that you would like to stay on good<br/>
terms with.<br/>
<br/>
Once you reach level 8, you&#39;re able to buy  root which will help you on your<br/>
way, as well as chaotic feedback which is a nice little Direct Damage spell.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, I hope these suggestions help you in some way.  It sounds like<br/>
you are doing not too bad though, so dont be afraid to hold onto whatever<br/>
works for you.<br/>

Subject: [eqenchanters] Hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wanted to say hi and that I just started an Enchanter. I was wondering<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; I could get some advice from all of you out there. I&#39;m Erudian, but I am<br/>
&gt; hunting with a friend in Qeynos Hills right now, I&#39;m 4th level. I really<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing, usually here is what combat is like, I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been lucky enough to get in a group yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Summon and Buff Pet<br/>
&gt; 2. Tashan<br/>
&gt; 3. Suffacating Sphere<br/>
&gt; 4. Enfeeblement<br/>
&gt; 5. Watch Animation beat up critter, sometimes help.<br/>
&gt; 6. Run away recast Animation and help finish it off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Those are pretty much all the spells I use, with the exception of Minor<br/>
&gt; Guard, Haze and Strengthen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have found that the best exp for me is to kill the diseased stuff and<br/>
turn<br/>
&gt; in thier pelts for alot of exp and a cure of course, that&#39;s really nice. I<br/>
&gt; turned in a fleshy orb once, but she handed it back and said to go to<br/>
&gt; Freeport, though I have no idea where that is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are there any problems with what I&#39;m doing? Please give me any advice you<br/>
&gt; can, I would love to hear it, I don&#39;t wanna get stuck in a way of doing<br/>
&gt; things only to find out that it will be wrong when I get higher in levels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS: Where in Qeynos do I buy The daggers for the Animation spells? I lookf<br/>
&gt; for hours, and go very lost.<br/>
