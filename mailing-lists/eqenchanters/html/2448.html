<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541331864">I quit using the lull series because it wasnt dependable. However I have<br/>
broken camps with mes before. There are different ways to do it, and Im not<br/>
sure if you are talking about dungeon or outdoor camps, (dungeon a little<br/>
more difficult to break).<br/>
<br/>
Here is a 3 spawn outdoor camp example.<br/>
<br/>
Cast mes for pulling. You mes one, and 2 come running from the camp. They<br/>
both hit you and your pet engages one. Have your party pull one quickly off<br/>
of your pet and bring it a safe distance away and start whacking it. Once<br/>
both are off you (one on your pet, one on the party), memblur the initial<br/>
target that was mesd. Now he will stay at the camp.<br/>
<br/>
Now watch your pet. He shouldnt be able to win against the mob, if he does<br/>
you are prolly too high level for the camp =). Stay a distance away until<br/>
pet is almost dead. Now cast mes. Once your pet dies, the mob is mesd. Then<br/>
memblur, walk back to your party. Now the camp is back to normal minus 1<br/>
mob.<br/>
<br/>
Wait the proper amount of time, then pull with mes again. Memblur the mesd<br/>
one, kill the other one. Wait a few more minutes, pull and kill the last<br/>
one. Now you have a perfectly spaced camp.<br/>
<br/>
In dungeons usually you dont have the luxury to pick a good place to fight,<br/>
and must fight an entire room. I have broken and killed many rooms solo<br/>
(Executioner, Cavalier, Sage, Live Tower, etc...) Always cast mes first,<br/>
this reduces the number you face. The problem now is you will prolly still<br/>
be facing 2-4 mobs that are now on you. (hopefully you cast runeiii and<br/>
berserker on your pet) this will allow him to take enough damage so that you<br/>
can mes. If everything is going good, then awesome , kill them. If however<br/>
you are low on mana, pet getting a whoopin... go ahead and settle for<br/>
killing one or two, now gate.<br/>
<br/>
Run back down to spot, make a pet, buff up, and start again with 1 or 2 mobs<br/>
less. Gate is not preferred, cause its fun to clear an entire room, but its<br/>
a good backup. If you are down to 1 or 2 mobs and pet about dead, save your<br/>
last bub of mana, mes one, let your pet die, mes the other...(at this point<br/>
depending if you can memblur do it, rest and rebuff, if you cant leave the<br/>
room, keep meditating and casting mes until your fom. This will take a long<br/>
time because of casting 2 mes constantly. However once you rebuff you can<br/>
kill one, and meditate again since your pet doesnt know the 2nd is aggro =)<br/>
<br/>
anyways just some tips.<br/>

Hey Horchata, enthrall is a good spell, (entrance is better)<br/>
and yes it does have the properties of a memblur, but its not %100.<br/>
I thought they nerfed mesmerize way back level 30 mobs kept attacking after<br/>
i mesd them. Its because the higher level they are above the spell level,<br/>
the more chance they resist the memblur part. Anyway when fighting level<br/>
35-53 mobs<br/>
youll find the mes series doesnt quite wipe the hate list, and will find<br/>
yourself attacked very often. Memblur isnt %100 either but its chance for<br/>
success are much higher. If a mob is in combat how do you wipe its hate if<br/>
it aggros you or a caster? Enthrall may only make it angry with you.<br/>
<br/>
When travelling thru lower guk my spell list was comprised mainly of<br/>
1. Buff (speed, clarity, personal buffs, insight, etc...)<br/>
2. Random slot (Suffocate, Discordant Mind, 2ndary buff slot, charm,<br/>
pillage enchantment, mesmerization, or when fighting very hard battles a<br/>
second mes (enthrall).<br/>
3. Entrance<br/>
4. Tashania<br/>
5. Color Shift<br/>
6. Color Skew<br/>
7. Mem Blur<br/>
8. Tepid Deeds<br/>
<br/>
When soloing non stunnable targets its usually<br/>
<br/>
1. Buff Slot<br/>
2. Discordant Mind or Choke <br/>
3. Entrance<br/>
4. Tashania<br/>
5. Berserker Spirit<br/>
6. Random Slot (Color series if mob is stunnable)<br/>
7. Mem Blur<br/>
8. Tepid/Shiftless Deeds<br/>
<br/>
when in lower guk solo, I usually have no buff slot to make room for both<br/>
Color Shift and Color Skew in case I need to cycle stun a mob. (i.e.<br/>
crusader, priest, cavalier, dar knight, kor wizzie, etc...)<br/>

Subject: Spell lineup<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters more so than any other class have so many options to choose from<br/>
depending on the situation that different spell lineups are needed for each<br/>
situation. Am I breaking up a spawn? Am I in a situation where trains will<br/>
have to be dealt with or are we off the tracks? Are we outdoors taking on<br/>
one solo creature? Other classes pretty much keep the same spells memorized<br/>
no matter what the situation. We can do different things depending on the<br/>
situation, and have a variety of spells to choose from to do so. There are<br/>
situations where 8 spell slots just don&#39;t seem to be enough and I find<br/>
myself constantly switching out spells.<br/>
<br/>
One situation that hasn&#39;t been mentioned is PvP. Many of our spells while<br/>
seeming useless against critters you usually fight, are quite strong in a<br/>
PvP environment. Whenever travelling on Vallon Zek in non-friendly areas<br/>
(and us enchanters are the one class on the PvP-Teams server that MUST do<br/>
this) or going out to PK, I find myself using completely different spells<br/>
than usual combat. Some stay the same, but Strip Enchantments, for example,<br/>
is a must have for PvP. Low mana spell interrupting spells are also a must<br/>
have. Debuffs, while usually useless, can easily encumber a player, and<br/>
lower rank ones (which means less mana) are quite useful for this. Too bad<br/>
there is no fix for the abuses that charm can lead to, because when we could<br/>
charm PvP, we were not only the masters of PvP, but were rightfully feared.<br/>

Subject: Enthrall vs Memory Blur<br/>
<br/>
Enthrall is not a guaranteed memory blur, it has a chance of doing so.<br/>
Fighting in the warrior room in HighKeep at level 30 against yellow to red<br/>
/con goblin warriors, the memory blur aspect seems to almost not exist.<br/>
Enthrall is crowd control (we don&#39;t want to fight you now, take a number,<br/>
we&#39;ll be right with you) and Memory Blur is, in this situation, combat<br/>
control (forget that the cleric just healed that tank for 600 health and go<br/>
back to swinging at the tank, will you?). In the spell descriptions at<br/>
EQ.castersrealm.com, the Mezmorize line is mentioned as having a good chance<br/>
of wiping the hate list only if you are outside the MOB&#39;s agresso range when<br/>
the spell wears off.  Enthrall when resisted will also put you at or near<br/>
the top of the MOB&#39;s hate list, while an inneffective Memory Blur doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to have this taunt factor. At 37, you are using Entrance over Enthrall,<br/>
right? And if not, what have you encountered that makes the difference?<br/>

Are there large differences in the charisma of some posters here?  I think<br/>
that would affect the chances of two people using the same spells having<br/>

its also our most valuable PvP spell as well, although I&#39;m fairly certain<br/>
that the duration is somewhat shorter when cast on another player.  Also<br/>
overlooked is both &#39;curse of the simple mind&#39; and &#39;mana seive&#39;, which when<br/>
used together can rapidly erase the opponents mana supply.  My PvP strategy<br/>
changes depending on the class that I&#39;m engaging, but I always begin a fight<br/>
with tashani-enthrall.... then if its a fighter type I begin debuffing and<br/>
if its a caster type I simple mind and mana seive mana seive mana seive.<br/>
Strip enchantments is very important yes, but never forget that you&#39;ll be<br/>
stripping your OWN debuffs as well, so always re-tashani after that<br/>
spell.... generally I dont strip enchantments for fighter types, but I LEAD<br/>
with it with clerics.<br/>
<br/>
some strategies at least...  I also agree completely that if there were a<br/>
fix for &#39;charm&#39; we&#39;d once again be the masters of PvP.  Why is it, then,<br/>
that a)MoBs can still charm players, and b)MoBs can charm MULTIPLE players?<br/>
Doesnt seem very fair...<br/>

Just curious, here.  I&#39;ve heard that when PCs get charmed, they use the<br/>
spell in the 8th slot to attack other PCs.  What would happen if a charmed<br/>
PC charmed another PC?  Or is it even possible?<br/>

&gt; Blur is definitely a good thing, even at level 50.<br/>

&gt;<br/>

&gt; charm), here is my usual lineup.  it has not changed,<br/>

&gt; where to find things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1 Memory Blur<br/>
&gt; 2 Tepid Deeds, or whatever your best slow spell is<br/>

My enchanter generally has charisma 185.  Most often, when a<br/>
enthralled/entranced monster wakes up he jumps on me, unless the tanking<br/>
types have taunted it first.<br/>

&gt; Are there large differences in the charisma of some posters here?  I think<br/>
&gt; that would affect the chances of two people using the same spells having<br/>
&gt; different results?<br/>

&gt; Enthrall is not a guaranteed memory blur, it has a chance of doing so.<br/>
&gt; Fighting in the warrior room in HighKeep at level 30 against yellow to red<br/>
&gt; /con goblin warriors, the memory blur aspect seems to almost not exist.<br/>
&gt; Enthrall is crowd control (we don&#39;t want to fight you now, take a number,<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ll be right with you) and Memory Blur is, in this situation, combat<br/>
&gt; control (forget that the cleric just healed that tank for 600 health and<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; back to swinging at the tank, will you?). In the spell descriptions at<br/>
&gt; EQ.castersrealm.com, the Mezmorize line is mentioned as having a good<br/>
chance<br/>
&gt; of wiping the hate list only if you are outside the MOB&#39;s agresso range<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; the spell wears off.  Enthrall when resisted will also put you at or near<br/>
&gt; the top of the MOB&#39;s hate list, while an inneffective Memory Blur doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seem to have this taunt factor. At 37, you are using Entrance over<br/>
Enthrall,<br/>
&gt; right? And if not, what have you encountered that makes the difference?<br/>
