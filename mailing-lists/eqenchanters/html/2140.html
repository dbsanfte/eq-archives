Noble Hunters:   Contact Kogna and Guntrik in the warriors guild of Oggok,<br/>
you must speak to Kogna first and tell him you are a mighty warrior of the<br/>
guild he will mention something about the Noble Hunters of Humans and Elves.<br/>
Go find Guntrik, also in warrior guild hall.  He will give you the rest of<br/>
the quest info.  Kill Noble Hunters of Humans and Elves, return to him any<br/>
house crests or an item that says where the Hunters sleep and he will reward<br/>
you.  Your reward is sometimes the Crude Stein.<br/>

Crude Stiens are plain old loot items from Ogre Bouncers.  You can usually<br/>
obtain<br/>
one by heading down there and looking for high level players who kite the<br/>
guards.<br/>
Since they are lore, you can probably get one for free.</div>
