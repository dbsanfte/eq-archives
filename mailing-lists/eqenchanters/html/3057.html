<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327970999">Hey all,<br/>
I&#39;m 25 at the moment, and up until recently Whirl Until You Hurl has been <br/>
great, stopping the mobs in their tracks for a while, long enough to get a <br/>
few hits in... but now it&#39;s only lasting 2 - 10 seconds on avaerage (on <br/>
Gnolls at the spires in SK, which con white-red to me).<br/>
Is there an upgrade to this spell, or anything similar available that I&#39;ve <br/>
missed?  I cant see any other spell that does similar for higher lvl&#39;s... <br/>
Root is an even lower lvl than this so I presume that&#39;s going to be even <br/>
less useful.<br/>
Thanks :o)<br/>
