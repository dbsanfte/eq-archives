<b>Subject:</b> Re: Medium sized cloth armor in Freeport? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636230447">I believe I bought mine in North Freeport.  Don&#39;t those gnomes sell Medium<br/>
cloth at the Marketplace?  Little blue building with a forge outside it for<br/>
some odd reason.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As the title says, is there anywhere in FP to purchase medium sized cloth<br/>
&gt; armor?  You would think being a human town there is, but so far all I can<br/>
&gt; find is 2 pieces for sale in North Ro.<br/>
<br/>
