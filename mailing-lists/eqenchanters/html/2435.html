<div id="ygrps-yiv-464992121">I have positive and negative things to say about how you play your<br/>
enchanter...i will start with the negative so we all end on a good note...<br/>
<br/>
Negative:<br/>
Basically, not being able to choose your spells like this, makes you more of<br/>
a risk to the group, you are too undecided, and cant figure out exactly what<br/>
you want to do. You rely more on yourself for the entire battle then the<br/>
entire group as a whole. You need to start to rely on your team-mates and<br/>
realize that they too can handle situations. Also, i think you probably<br/>
soloed a lot in the mid teens to mid 20&#39;s, cause most of the line up of your<br/>
spells are good for soloing.<br/>
<br/>
Positive:<br/>
Not many people can truely understand the enchanter, and you have mastered<br/>
every single type of situation and what spells to use for the situations. A<br/>
group with you will not have problems getting the spells they need, or the<br/>
kills they need as long as you recognize the situation (which you have<br/>
mastered)  I too switch my spells often depending on the situation, but you<br/>
have an art here that is interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, to sum up my opinion...remember this is only an opinion e-mail<br/>
heheh<br/>
I think you have great skill as an enchanter, but i dont think that being so<br/>
undecided and changing spells either during battle, or running out of mana<br/>
(i am sure you run out fast) during a battle because you wanna use all your<br/>
spells is the best way to play an enchanter.....<br/>
<br/>
Anywayz, thats my opinons :) take it or leave it, its up to you.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my Usual lineup:  Invis (for breaking<br/>
&gt; &gt; charm),Rune III, Tashani, Tepid Deeds, Insipid Weakness, Enthrall,<br/>
Beguile, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Clarity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow. I&#39;m surprised people keep Clarity memmed, let alone having enough<br/>
&gt; slots to keep invis memmed just to break charm!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m always strapped for slots. I constantly swap around spells while<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m playing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My usual line-up is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tashani (always there)<br/>
&gt; Tepid Deeds<br/>
&gt; Mem Blur (always there)<br/>
&gt; Beguile or Rune III if fighting stuff in the 40&#39;s or no cleric<br/>
&gt; Enthrall (always there)<br/>
&gt; Mesmerization or Enduring Breath if in Kedge<br/>
&gt; Color Shift/misc buff slot (feedback if no druid or magician else I keep<br/>
&gt;                             the next buff I need to rebuff in here)<br/>
&gt; Color Flux or Choke if not in a shift/flux place<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I get time in a bigger battle, I&#39;ll swap out tepid deeps for<br/>
&gt; Insipid Weakness then swap out Insipid Weakness for Listless Power<br/>
&gt; but most of the time stuff is near dead before I swap Insipid Weakness<br/>
&gt; for Listless Power so I normally just swap back to Tepid Deeds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the next pull is a caster, I put Strip Enchantment in for Tepid Deeds.<br/>
&gt; If the place isn&#39;t flux/shift friendly, I&#39;ll swap out choke for<br/>
&gt; strip enchantment and put Whirl (to interrupt casters) in<br/>
&gt; for the misc buff slot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the only time I&#39;m not swapping spells like mad is when there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a shaman AND a druid/magician with me in a place where flux/shift is<br/>
&gt; bad. The shaman does the dotting and the druid/magician does the<br/>
&gt; damage shielding and I can stick with some buffing and crowd<br/>
&gt; control.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the only time I mem DD is when I want the wizard or<br/>
&gt; druid to laugh at me *Grin*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My hotkey slots get confusing for me too. I try to keep it:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bank 1 (main combat)<br/>
&gt; 1) Mem Blur always<br/>
&gt; 2) Beginning of battle spell (usually either Tepid deeds or strip ench)<br/>
&gt; 3) Enduring breath or mesmerization (emergencies usually)<br/>
&gt; 4) Enthrall always<br/>
&gt; 5) Tashani always<br/>
&gt; 6) Interrupt casters (either shift or whirl when I swap it in) or DoT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (When flux/shifting, I do one with a hotkey the other with a mouse)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bank 2 (charm combat)<br/>
&gt; 1) Pet back off<br/>
&gt; 2) Pet guard here<br/>
&gt; 3) Beguile<br/>
&gt; 4) Pet attack<br/>
&gt; 5) Tashani<br/>
&gt; 6) Pet follow me<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bank 3 (common non-combat stuff)<br/>
&gt; 1) Spell book<br/>
&gt; 2) Invite/Follow<br/>
&gt; 3) Sit (so shift-3 3 will get me medding)<br/>
&gt; 4) Bind Wounds<br/>
&gt; 5) Camp<br/>
&gt; 6) Walk/Run (mostly so I can walk when I have SoW and others don&#39;t)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bank 4 (Walking around I leave it here by habit because I /who all a lot)<br/>
&gt; 1) Sense Heading<br/>
&gt; 2) Loc<br/>
&gt; 3) Corpse<br/>
&gt; 4) /who all Amicus (my guild)<br/>
&gt; 5) /who all friends<br/>
&gt; 6) Disband<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bank 5 (assists)<br/>
&gt; 1) Assist (general)<br/>
&gt; 2) Assist Lenn<br/>
&gt; 3) Assist Locie<br/>
&gt; 4) Assist Faelloran<br/>
&gt; 5) Assist Aindolmer<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bank 6 is empty.<br/>
