<b>Subject:</b> Mez and stun <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592409387">Does anybody have information about the lengths of the mez and stun lines ?<br/>
I heard in-game that mez is 15 sec, enthrall 30, entrance 45 and dazzle 60.<br/>
The enchanter spell list on Baelish&#39;s site says mez 30, enthrall 30, <br/>
entrance 50-60, dazzle 120, which I find more believable. Anybody measure <br/>
with a stopwatch ?<br/>
<br/>
Also, as far as I can tell, this line of spells is fixed duration, i.e, MOB<br/>
does not get any saving throws to break early like the root line. True ?<br/>
<br/>
Stun line : Color Flux 3 sec, Color Shift 7 sec, Color Skew 8 sec. Is the<br/>
stun duration fixed ? In my experience, some MOBs seem to be more susceptible<br/>
to staying stunned longer. Like lizards in CT seemed to stay stunned forever<br/>
with even flux.<br/>
