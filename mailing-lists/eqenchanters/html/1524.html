<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786454615">Well, <br/>
<br/>
After almost hitting the delete character key(thank god I didn&#39;t), I finally made it to level 16.<br/>
<br/>
I just have a few questions,<br/>
<br/>
When is the Rune 1 spell really worth using? I  cast it on myself and it lasted an incredibly long time Just wandering around. I cast it a second time and as soon as I got into any fighting it wore off very fast. Kind of an expensive spell for the time it lasts. Just looking for some feedback and maybe some situations to use it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Second question is about research. What book to I need to buy? and for the first three spells is there a left and right half to one page? or do I just put one page in ?<br/>
