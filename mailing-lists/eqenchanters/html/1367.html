<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531606305">I agree, though not quite as high. I have 1065 platinum in the bank<br/>
right now, and had about 20plat last week at this time.  I sell the int<br/>
and wis rings at 10p, STR rings at 12p, and so on.<br/>
Also, GREAT way to make money? go to South Karanas and start auctioning<br/>
to buy Black pearls. Monks and rogues eat up that blackeded pearl ring!<br/>
Another aweseom way to make money once some electrum start to become<br/>
trivial is to look for 25 - 50 lvl clerics, Shamen, Druids, Paladins,<br/>
and shoot em a quick tell about your ruby mask, and to only respond if<br/>
interested.  I been selling these masks at least one or two a night for<br/>
300pp or more.  People at high levels treat money ALOT differently then<br/>
people at lower levels, and they will toss 300plat without thinking into<br/>
a ruby mask.  Not any skill increase, but I am saving up a big nest egg<br/>
so I can go broke again with Gold at 24 =)<br/>

&gt; man, you guys are charging way to little for the rings of +2!!!<br/>
&gt; they cost us about 6pp to make one ring, and your going and selling<br/>
&gt; for 6pp<br/>
&gt; or 7pp!<br/>
&gt; i sell mine for 12pp for 1 and 20pp for a set of 2!!<br/>
&gt; and they sell.<br/>
&gt; if i sell at your prices, and fail once, i am loosing money. do not<br/>
&gt; bring<br/>
&gt; the market down, bring it up!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
