&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just started an Erudite Enchanter, and having a blast. Some of these<br/>
&gt; questions are probably asked often, so if there&#39;s a FAQ or other source<br/>
&gt; that answers them, please feel free to point me there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Is there any armor available that gives the look of plate, chain, or at<br/>
&gt; least leather?  I&#39;d like to be a little less naked when taking the form of<br/>
&gt; a class that doesn&#39;t have robe graphics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots.  I have 2 or 3 pairs of leggings that look like leather (blue on a<br/>
gnome), and there is the rare item or 2 that will offer you the look of<br/>
plate (golden chitin bracer for one).  For tunics, I recommend the green<br/>
silken drape, which shows up as a green shirt, or a robe of the keeper,<br/>
which shows up as a red shirt.<br/>

&gt; 2) Do any of the illusions provide racial abilities (wood elf forage, dark<br/>
&gt; elf hide, etc. in addition to sight improvements?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They all do apparently.  all of the elemental forms have the most obvious<br/>
abilities built in (levitation, water breath, fire shield, strength), I<br/>
believe that illusion human DOES provide an XP bonus as well.  I didnt know<br/>
that as a barbarian I could slam though...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) How does Alliance work?  Does it always raise one faction level (e.g.<br/>
&gt; dubious to apprehensive)?  Does it decrease faction with negative faction<br/>
&gt; groups (e.g. if I cast it on a deathfist orc, will it make me less liked<br/>
&gt; by the commons residents)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No negative faction involved.  Also, I&#39;ve noticed that you can use the<br/>
alliance line of spells on several different faction groups and not lose the<br/>
faction you gained with the first that you cast it on.  I have a wand that<br/>
has effect:alliance and I regularily cast it on everything around me (just<br/>
for the visual effect).  If I go from dubious to indifferent with freeport<br/>
guards, and then from indifferent to amiable with the nearest merchant, I&#39;m<br/>
still indifferent with the guards.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4) At what level can I go into the evil cities?  My gnome necro can go<br/>
&gt; into Neriak - can my agnostic enchanter go there in gnome form?  Can I go<br/>
&gt; into Grobb or Oggok in dark elf form, or must I wait for ogre/troll form?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As soon as you get illusion - dark elf you can go everywhere in Norrath<br/>
(except watch that shadowknight guild).  As an agnostic you arent limited by<br/>
religion.<br/>
