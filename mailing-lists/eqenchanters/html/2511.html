<div id="ygrps-yiv-323593775"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; at the very least hang around and make our lives difficult<br/>
&gt; &gt; and at worst kill me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bummer.  Is it a matter of where you stand in the room, or do they wander<br/>
&gt; enough that it&#39;s simply luck?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are wandering NPC guards on the level above you, so using AE stun is<br/>
risky.  I have been using it when absolutely necessary provided I have SoW<br/>
up.  The gards only hit for 50-60, so if I have SoW I can zone without<br/>
dying, and more importantly the guards do not agro on the rest of my group,<br/>
only me.  Last night I played without stun memmed and it was a major<br/>
inconvenience.  Actually this same problem would probably present itself if<br/>
I was fighting in the tower in Unrest...  Those mobs agro through the floor<br/>
and ceiling very, very easily.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Mez (and WTYH for that matter) has a 2.5 second cast time.  If you cast<br/>
&gt; immediately after seeing the &quot;hits YOU&quot; message, you should be able to get<br/>
&gt; it off at least half the time.  If there&#39;s only one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Better yet, if you have a wizzie or cleric (or 30+ Paladin) in your group,<br/>
&gt; warn them in advance that this will happen and they should keep a stunning<br/>
&gt; spell memmed.  In combat, just /g &quot;please stun this unpleasant green<br/>
&gt; thing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had a cleric last night (for a change), but he was often LOM and medding<br/>
for heals.  BTW these things aren&#39;t green - they&#39;re high blue to red, with<br/>
most being red.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Root is another very good option, either from another caster that can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stun, or cast it yourself, as it casts in 2.0 seconds rather than 2.5.<br/>
&gt; Once rooted, step back and mez away (or step back and leave it rooted, for<br/>
&gt; that matter).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Root&#39;s also a good idea.  It&#39;s not a spell that I memorize very often<br/>
though.  I tend to select mez/charm/stun type spells before a &quot;brute force&quot;<br/>
root.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In fact, in the hands of a competent group without an enchanter, root is<br/>
&gt; actually an effective small-crowd control method.  It doesn&#39;t touch what<br/>
&gt; an enchanter can do, but with just a very small amount of maneuvering room<br/>
&gt; it can take 2-3 MoBs out of the combat.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BTW - my group last night sure loved me.  The paladin and monk were pulling<br/>
three red mobs at a time.  At first they were a hair&#39;s breadth away from<br/>
zoning at all times, but as the evening progressed they go relatively<br/>
comfortable with pulling three reds..  I was able to mes the pretty easily.<br/>
