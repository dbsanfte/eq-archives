<div id="ygrps-yiv-823887920">Hi guys!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m real close to lvl 24 now and I&#39;m wondering where I should be fighting.<br/>
I&#39;m loving permafrost, but I want to move on soon.  (Don&#39;t even say<br/>
Highkeep, I hate that place.. :) ).  I checked out Sol A, but there<br/>
weren&#39;t enough people there at the time that could group with me (mostly<br/>
lvl 35 and up).  the mobs there looked great, and I found a couple nice<br/>
places to set up camp, but it might be tough to get a group going in that<br/>
situation.  Any other suggestions?  I&#39;m really loving the dungeon scene.<br/>
big pulls, mez, and tons of exp and good loot.  Anybody have any favorite<br/>
dungeons that would be good for my level? :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
