<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374570347">i must admit, i enjoyed reading your story, and you have my regards for your<br/>
death, but from my understanding of the spell, it just wipes YOU from the<br/>
Mob&#39;s hate list, untill later when we get that &quot;Blanket of Forgetfulness&quot;<br/>
spell which i think wipes all members in your party or all creatures in the<br/>
AOE.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I used memory blur for the first time last night and I have some<br/>
questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My party and I decided to try and tackle a hill giant. With all of us<br/>
having<br/>
&gt; SoW and me having Memory Blur (MB) we didn&#39;t think we&#39;d have a problem,<br/>
even<br/>
&gt; though we are all low-mid 20&#39;s. Well, we couldn&#39;t touch that hill giant<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; spells even after my tashani. The tank was hysterical and wouldn&#39;t run<br/>
close<br/>
&gt; enough for me to get off a MB to get the giant off him. In the end,<br/>
everyone<br/>
&gt; but me zoned, so the hill giant comes straight for me. I start pushing the<br/>
&gt; MB key... Target out of range!... Target out of range!... You begin to<br/>
cast<br/>
&gt; a spell.... A hill giant blinks. The hill giant then changed direction and<br/>
&gt; went about his merry way. Cool!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now that we know we can&#39;t take a hill giant, and bolstered by our<br/>
experience<br/>
&gt; with the hill giant (noone died), we decided to try a griffon. This one<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t go nearly as well. The griffon turned out to be just as magic<br/>
&gt; resistant as the hill giant, and a LOT faster. After unsuccessfully trying<br/>
&gt; our spells, the call went out for MB. The tank ran the griff near me and I<br/>
&gt; cast MB. A griffon blinks. Problem was, it kept chasing the tank! The tank<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t like that news so he kept running for the zone. I chased him a bit<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; try and get another cast of MB off. I guess at that point I was closer to<br/>
&gt; the griffon than the tank because it turned for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You begin to cast a spell.<br/>
&gt; A griffon claws you for 96 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; A griffon claws you for 96 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; A griffon kicks you for 34 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; You keep your concentration and finish the spell! (don&#39;t know how...)<br/>
&gt; A griffin blinks.<br/>
&gt; A griffon claws you for 78 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; A griffon claws you for 89 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; A griffon bashes you for 28 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; You are stunned!<br/>
&gt; You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>
&gt; You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>
&gt; You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>
&gt; You cannot cast spells while stunned!<br/>
&gt; A griffin claws you  for 56 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; A griffon kicks you for 32 points of damage!<br/>
&gt; You have been slain by a griffon!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The question I have is, what is the correct way to use MB? Apparently, it<br/>
&gt; wipes the hate list, but if you are in the critter&#39;s aggro radius the<br/>
&gt; critter will just jump you again. Anyone have any strategies to share in<br/>
&gt; using Memory Blur?<br/>
