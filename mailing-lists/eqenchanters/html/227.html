    Could we please refrain from quoting an entire thread of e-mails?  I understand the need to quote what we are replying to but some of the messages have become ridiculous.  There are some replies which contain 2 or 3 lines of fresh interesting text and then quote 60 or 70 lines of old messages.  This becomes a real pain for us digest subscribers (having to sift through an enormous amount of tripe).  So I am _asking_ please only quote what is neccessary to your reply, usually the &quot;Re: Blah&quot; subject line is enough for people to put together what thread it is a reply to and the quoted text is wasted space.  Thanks for listening :)<br/>
