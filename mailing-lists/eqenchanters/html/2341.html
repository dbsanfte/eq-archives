taken the form of. Only problem is that you are a caster, and cant wear<br/>
much other than cloth or magical armor. Only think I can think of that will<br/>
give you a nice armored look is Woven armor, and the ribcage armor from the<br/>
Goblin Alchemist in Misty Thicket. Both appear as leather on your character.</div>
