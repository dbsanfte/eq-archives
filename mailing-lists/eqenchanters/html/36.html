<div id="ygrps-yiv-874848836">Greetings I am Ageron Gnome Enchanter. I am very fond of my chosen profession, and hope to start jewlery craft soon. I find it almost impossible to make enough coin to buy my 8th level spells, and I hear Learning to make Jewlery is very expensive. It sounds like some enchanters out there have coins to spare. Can I ask how you are generating money? What creatures are you slaying to support yourselves?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
