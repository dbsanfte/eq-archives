<b>Subject:</b> Level 8 Finally <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034327025">Well, I finally made level 8, and I mus tsay I love the spells! I bought Alliance, Chaotic Feedback, Lesser Shielding, and Eye Of Confusion. They are all great. However, I didn&#39;t have enough money for anything else, so I don&#39;t know if I should buy Root, Soothe, or Cancel Magic first when I get enough. Anyone have any suggestions? Also, could someone give me a suggestion as to where to fight? I do not want to go to Crushbone, but the Dragon Bones in Steamfont where I am fighting right now are also pretty boring. I do not want to take a month to get to the next spell circle like I did this time, can anyone help me out?<br/>
