<div id="ygrps-yiv-726572607">Hell no, Enchanters Rule<br/>
They can Go solo whenever they wan&#39;t.<br/>
Their pets are awesome, My enchanter can solo and join<br/>
groups. The only reason they say enchanters are good<br/>
for groups is cause they are, they mold the battle to<br/>
what they want it to become. They can weaken and fear,<br/>
root and strength and haze. But if you goto<br/>
eqenchanters website you will see under the strategies<br/>
section that there are a lot of ways enchanters can go<br/>
solo with their pets. Whats fun about enchanters is<br/>
that they can Screw with the monsters while killing<br/>
them. Example: Orc Leggion that is red to me,<br/>
MEzmerize, Tashan, Root, Chaotic sphere, Suffocating<br/>
sphere, Mezmerice Root Etc... Except you can cast more<br/>
attack spells inbetween . This is how i killed them.<br/>
Anyway I had no pet then i&#39;m sure i could have killed<br/>
it with less risk of dying with my pet. I&#39;ll tell you<br/>
now they are not that great till you hit about level 4<br/>
or 8 than you notice things but at 12 with your charm<br/>
spell you can have fun.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not in EQ yet, but I&#39;m seriously considering it.<br/>
&gt;  Main question I have is <br/>
&gt; whether it&#39;s really worthwhile/fun/possible to play<br/>
&gt; the enchanter class solo? <br/>
&gt;  Stuff I&#39;ve read so far kinda says that if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; not in a group, you&#39;re not <br/>
&gt; goin anywhere...<br/>
