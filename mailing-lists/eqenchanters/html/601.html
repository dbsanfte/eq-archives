<b>Subject:</b> Is Jewelcraft Broke? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-476181487">This really got me mad yesterday. I put as many training points as I<br/>
could into Jewelcraft. I then sunk 40 platinum into the skill. I sold<br/>
all the stuff I made and put it back into the skill.  This got me to a<br/>
skill of 37 where I was combining Amber and silver. I was in Freeport at<br/>
the time and my skill was rising very fast I thought. Last night I sunk<br/>
over 70 platinum into the skill. I went up a notch to using Jade and<br/>
enchanted silver to make Mana Rings.  In 20 attempts I made 13 rings and<br/>
got NO SKILL IMPROVEMENT AT ALL.  What gives?  Am I doing something<br/>
wrong? I thought my 70 platinum investment would get me to at least 40<br/>
skill or higher. Now I&#39;m broke, but I have yet to sell the Jade rings<br/>
because I was tired and frustrated. If I can get 7-8 platinum per ring I<br/>
should get most of my money back. I would appreciate any help here guys.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I found my success rate making jewelry better when I had full<br/>
mana. I don&#39;t know if this was just a coincidence or not.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</div>
