<div id="ygrps-yiv-242289940">Then i&#39;m lost, cause i have never had a stun break a Entrance..  it still <br/>
last for the ful min 20 secs (give or take a few seconds), trust me i <br/>
usually group with people who don&#39;t knwo how to pul  and they end up <br/>
bringing several back with them and it&#39;s never broken it from what i&#39;ve <br/>
seen....   plus i tryed to test it out in SolB the other day i entranced one <br/>
and stood right next to it and cast stun.  He stayed there for over a min, <br/>
wish all my stuns lasted that long. But maybe i&#39;m bugged   heh, i don&#39;t know<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yesterdays mes/stun thread...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I saw a few posts yesterday claiming that stun series do not break<br/>
&gt; &gt; enthrall/mes? That information is wrong. Stun breaks mes every single<br/>
&gt;time,<br/>
&gt; &gt; unless it is resisted, which is why color series arent necessarily a <br/>
&gt;good<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing to use while messing. However, a good tactic to save the party and<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I completely disagree.  Many times I&quot;ve had one or two MoBs enthralled, and<br/>
&gt;with the third beating on me I&#39;ll throw a color flux at it... stunning all <br/>
&gt;3<br/>
&gt;targets.  Both of the MoB that were enthralled continue to be enthralled.  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;generally like to stand in the middle of my enthralled targets with no<br/>
&gt;target selected, so that as soon as I get hit I can start casting enthrall<br/>
&gt;or stun.  Not to mention it makes it obvious to my tanks that there is no<br/>
&gt;threat from the &#39;enchantress area&#39;<br/>
