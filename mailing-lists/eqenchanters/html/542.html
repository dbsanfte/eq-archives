I guess the exploit is still possible using the spell Camoflage.  I had<br/>
a<br/>
run-in with a rather unfriendly and selfish player last night in Misty,<br/>
outside Rivervale.  Vyctor, by name, seemed to think that the Mooto<br/>
(named<br/>
Goblin) spawning camp was all his. ...and despite my many attempts to<br/>
try<br/>
and SHARE the spawns by rotating pulls, he would not budge....not reply.<br/>
Instead, I would try to &#39;steal&#39; a turn (after he had killed the last 2<br/>
or<br/>
3) and he would reply by casting Camoflage on my, thus KILLING my<br/>
animation.  Exploit!  I immediately petitioned.  the Guide showed up a<br/>
few<br/>
minutes later....and told me he was invisible and to continue playing as<br/>
usual.  I did.....Vyctor repeated his actions and killed my pet.  About<br/>
1<br/>
minute later, Meronn The Mischievious (a GM, not a Guide) appeared at<br/>
the<br/>
camp and explained that he was &#39;Exploiting&#39; and could be banned for such<br/>
behavior.  Vyctor was not happy....challenged me to duel (which i<br/>
declined<br/>
by ignoring) and I left.  Meanwhile, I get ridiculed for &#39;crying to a<br/>
GM&#39;.<br/>
Bullshit!  This is an exploit...and I tried diplomatic resolution first.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up, he was given a &#39;Formal warning that will be logged by<br/>
Verant&#39;....and I left with a very bad taste in my mouth....gated home to<br/>
Rivervale and fished to cool my nerves.<br/>
<br/>
How else should I have handled this?  I might have dueled for the &#39;camp<br/>
rights&#39; but he did not offer to duel until AFTER he was warned...and at<br/>
that point it was mere anger, not a solution to the original problem.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input.<br/>
