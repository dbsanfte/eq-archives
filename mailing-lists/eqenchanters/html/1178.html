<div id="ygrps-yiv-407091008">For those of you out there who haven&#39;t been using mesmerize, not only have<br/>
you missed one of the most useful spells in the game, you have made your<br/>
time adventuring unnecessarily difficult. To grasp the effects of mesmerize,<br/>
just think about what its name implies. What it does is &#39;distract&#39; the<br/>
critter (i.e., makes em start daydreaming). This is the &#39;stun&#39; effect of<br/>
this spell. NOTE: If you attack the critter while it is &#39;stunned&#39;, it will<br/>
no longer be &#39;stunned&#39;, and you will have just wasted your spell, because it<br/>
will begin attacking you once again. That would be akin to seeing a friend<br/>
of yours daydreaming, so you punch em in the shoulder to &#39;bring em back&#39;.<br/>
This is where I assume most go wrong with this spell. While the critter is<br/>
&#39;stunned&#39; he is dead to the world. He doesn&#39;t care what&#39;s going on, as long<br/>
as it doesn&#39;t involve him. If the critter is normally non-agressive, when he<br/>
comes back from la-la-land, he will just go his merry way. If he is normally<br/>
aggressive, and you are still in his aggression range, he will attack you<br/>
once again. And the tricky situation: If the critter is a normally<br/>
non-aggressive swarmer (wisps, fire beetles, spiderling, etc.) and you are<br/>
fighting one of its kind, you can kill the one you are currently attacking<br/>
without disturbing the critter who was mesmerized. HOWEVER, if you change<br/>
targets to another of the same type of critter, the previously mesmerized<br/>
critter registers this attack and will join in. (Example: You are fighting 3<br/>
wisps. You mesmerize one. You are now fighting 2. You can kill the one you<br/>
are currently fighting, but when you attack the 2nd one, the mesmerized wisp<br/>
will join in again.)<br/>
<br/>
This is an incredibly useful spell. Play around with it, I think all of you<br/>
will like it.<br/>

P.S. I just made level 16, so I haven&#39;t had much chance to play around with<br/>
the AE version. I&#39;ll let y&#39;all know if it is as useful as the single target<br/>
one...</div>
