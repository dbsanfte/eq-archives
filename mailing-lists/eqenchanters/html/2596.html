<b>Subject:</b> not getting faction from fights <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-278296334">I was grouped with a few people killing bandits the other day and noticed<br/>
that I wasn&#39;t getting faction from most of them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d been using mostly mez and color flux, with the very occasional tashan,<br/>
choke, chaotic feedback, and some charming when I was FM and wanted to toy<br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
So, it seemed that mezzing them, even if it broke prematurely, did not get<br/>
me on the faction list.  I got XP but no faction for those I only mezzed.  <br/>
Tashan, charm, and damage spells all got me faction UNLESS I mezzed<br/>
afterward.<br/>
<br/>
This makes some sense (but is annoying) due to the mem blur component of<br/>
mez.<br/>
<br/>
However, it seemed that a resisted color flux didn&#39;t get me faction and a<br/>
successful flux did.  That struck me as odd.  In addition, whirl didn&#39;t<br/>
get me any faction.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else experience lack of faction for stun spells?  They definitely<br/>
aggro critters - why shouldn&#39;t they get you on the faction list as well?  <br/>
In some cases, this will be an advantage, but mostly I WANT the faction<br/>
from things I&#39;m fighting.<br/>
