<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655783415">Oasis is so crowded,  and not the best learning place to learn how to be a<br/>
good enchanter for your later lvls (20 through 60, depending where you hunt<br/>
from 55 to 60).  If I were you I would suggest going to Unrest behind the<br/>
house.  Never hunt in front of the house too many trains.  The back side of<br/>
the house is good place for your lvl and you can solo there too until you<br/>
can get a group.  Learn your spells and what they actually do.  You will be<br/>
one step ahead of everyone else anyways because,  at least on my server,<br/>
most enchanters are power leveled up these days and that&#39;s one class if you<br/>
dont know what you are doing you cant fake it.<br/>

Hi all, i&#39;ve not introduced myself... just joined this list last week and <br/>
as there haven&#39;t been any posts.. well, that&#39;s my reason for not doing it <br/>
before now :o)<br/>
I&#39;ve only just started playing EQ in the last few weeks, i&#39;m a Gnome <br/>
Enchantress on The Rathe server.<br/>
Doing pretty well, I&#39;m lvl 14 now and a large loan from a friend has <br/>
ensured that I&#39;ve been able to get almost all my spells and lots of decent <br/>
kit :o)<br/>
Anyway, so far I&#39;ve played... in North Freeport for the first few lvl&#39;s, <br/>
Misty Thicket up till 7 or 8, then West Commons up until now, killing <br/>
Dervs.  I&#39;ve pretty much stopped getting exp from killing them now (in <br/>
groups of 6 usually), so have been dumped in Oasis... but so far everything <br/>
iv&#39;e come across is green or red :o(<br/>
Does anyone have any tips for the best place to be located at this <br/>
lvl?  Obviously I&#39;d like to get to 16 soon to get breeze but at the rate <br/>
I&#39;m going, I&#39;m either going to not move from low lvl 14, or go down to 13 <br/>
if I get killed any more in oasis :o(<br/>
Thanks a lot,<br/>
<br/>
