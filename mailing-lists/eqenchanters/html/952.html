<div id="ygrps-yiv-823634804">We all appreciate participation in the list.<br/>
BUT! In the future would you please refrain from quoting the<br/>
entire digest in your message?  Nothing worse than a digest to<br/>
digest feedback loop.  Well, okay, maybe a festering hag train is worse,<br/>
but only slightly )<br/>
<br/>
Now to contribute instead of just complain )<br/>
<br/>
My enchanter is only 10th level, and I have not found it difficult to gain this<br/>
level solo<br/>
or with group assistance.  My tactics change drastically whether Im solo  or in<br/>
group,<br/>
of course.  Perhaps I will become severely disable when I hit the range of 14 -<br/>
18th.<br/>
But, while some spells don&#39;t work the way I would like them to, I am still happy<br/>
overall<br/>
with the class.  Not a knock on necro players, but I didn&#39;t want to play one,<br/>
and if they are<br/>
&quot;tougher&quot; than me, no big deal.  Being able to contribute in a group is another<br/>
issue entirely.<br/>
I can&#39;t always contribute directly against a deep red, but I can engage it first<br/>
and contribute my<br/>
pet, and I can buff the party to some extent and keep wandering yellows from<br/>
fouling the mix.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty happy with my role as it is.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as an aside. I have grouped with a couple of 9th and 10th level wizards,<br/>
and in all occasions,<br/>
I habe ended confornations with more life and more mana than they have. Don&#39;t<br/>
know what this<br/>
REALLY means in the end, but the mobs were always more willing to target me than<br/>
them if I stepped<br/>
in.<br/>
