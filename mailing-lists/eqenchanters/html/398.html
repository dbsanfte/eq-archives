<div id="ygrps-yiv-686146776">yes from everything that has been posted on the illusion spells you DO take<br/>
on the special abilities of the illusion as you turn........so that goes for<br/>
all races.....dark elf for ultravision.....troll illusion for faster regen<br/>
rate.....the woodelf idea was great for foraging, but not sure if it allows<br/>
you to use the races special SKILLS.....just actual abilities........such as<br/>
the Fire El hitting for 80 points......<br/>
