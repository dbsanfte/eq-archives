<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878690334"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ok, i have this big problem...I am a level 11 enchanter and my offense<br/>
&gt;and defense skills arent even at (40) yet!  (the cap is 60).  I fight<br/>
&gt;alot...with my staff...and still the skill just about never ever goes<br/>
&gt;up.  For example the offense, defense skill went up 1 number the whole<br/>
&gt;time i was level 10.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>if your near 40 and the cap is 60, and you are only level 10 I would<br/>
suggest that you are doing quite well, considering skills can continue to<br/>
rise at least until level 50</div>
