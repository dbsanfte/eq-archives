<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-349953217">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
	I have just started a high elf enchanter on Tunare, having grown<br/>
tired of my monk, and I have heard many bad things about enchanters.  So,<br/>
I have a few questions...<br/>
<br/>
	1) Is there a list somewhere of spells that are unimplemented or<br/>
just plain worthless?  I have heard rumors that the faction adjustment<br/>
spells such as Alliance do not actually do anything.<br/>
<br/>
	2) I have heard many problems with regards to tougher monsters<br/>
resisting spells.  Is this only apparent at higher levels?  I am currently<br/>
5th level, and while my spells are resisted occasionally, I can still affect<br/>
red creatures reasonably.<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks for your help, in advance.  I&#39;m trying to tell if I&#39;m going<br/>
to regret the time I spend advancing my character in the long run.<br/>
