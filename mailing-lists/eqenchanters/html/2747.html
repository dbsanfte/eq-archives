<div id="ygrps-yiv-104999146">heh, i&#39;ve bought crappie robes to change up apperance too,  the games <br/>
about fun,   burning each other over with robe is better (really when both <br/>
aren&#39;t the biggest help) is retarded.<br/>
<br/>
please don&#39;t throw in burns at each other, it clogs up my mail.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and at level 22,  there is a nice place in SK, IF (lol) you can get it,   <br/>
The Hermit,  small house surrouded by brick wall.   Very nice exp and at <br/>
level 22 is when enchanter can solo him well.<br/>
<br/>
  Make a pet,  he hits you fear,  and he&#39;s traped in the walls surounding <br/>
his house,<br/>
<br/>
  if you can get a partner   craig spiders and stuff are nice too in east <br/>
Karana.<br/>
<br/>
those are just a two more i can think of to add onto there lists,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lol oh wait,   off of easy K,   there is a zone call  kings goruge (my <br/>
spelling sucks)  there are Evileyes there,  at 22, you and one or two level <br/>
22 buddies can have a feild day with exp and they also drop the PBB.  yes <br/>
they are camped alot,  BUT  nothing ventured nothing gained   adn they are <br/>
