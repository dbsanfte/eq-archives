<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476973224">Griffins and some other creatures besides undead can see invisible PC&#39;s do<br/>
not trust your invisibility to always work agains every creature. I found<br/>
out the same way about Grifiins as you did. And i know that undead can see<br/>
you if your invisible unless you have invisibility to undead. but,<br/>
invisibilty is not the best way to travel.<br/>

&gt; I gave up a level 16 dark-elf necro because their invisibility spell (<br/>
&gt; gather shadows ) was very unreliable. One sad evening, coming back from a<br/>
&gt; very long quest that brought me to Kerra Island and South Karana, I got<br/>
&gt; hacked multiple times in Riverdale losing about 4 bubs of xp because my<br/>
&gt; invis wore off on me randomly. I got really pissed off that at level 16, I<br/>
&gt; could not manage to cast a level 8 spell reliably and decided to start<br/>
&gt; another character more appropriate for travelling since I was very much<br/>
into<br/>
&gt; research and quests.<br/>
&gt; With my enchantress, I got invisibility at level 4 and used it some times.<br/>
&gt; It always seemed to work great but I might be wrong. Yesterday, I found<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; that this invisibility spell is as bad as gather shadows as a %$#%^^%$<br/>
&gt; griffin nuked me a few seconds after I cast invisibility. Since then, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; noticed the same kind on unreliability...but only since I made level 8...I<br/>
&gt; might be wrong.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I would like to know how&#39;s the enchanter&#39;s invisibility like at<br/>
&gt; level 16 or 20 or more. CAN YOU COUNT ON IT?<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; now known as Skara, the enchantress from Innoruuk<br/>
