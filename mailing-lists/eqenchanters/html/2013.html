&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Twinking is having one of your high level characters gain<br/>
&gt;&gt; equipment/items/money and then transfer it to one of your lower level<br/>
&gt;&gt; characters.  One method of doing this is to &quot;drop&quot; the items on the<br/>
&gt;ground,<br/>
&gt;&gt; log out, log in with your other character and &quot;find&quot; them.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Another method is to pay another player to hold the items while you log<br/>
&gt;out<br/>
&gt;&gt; and back in with your other character.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Many regard twinking as cheating as far as &quot;that character&quot; did not earn<br/>
&gt;&gt; those items.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
