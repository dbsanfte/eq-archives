<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944330210">Hail fellow Enchanters -<br/>
<br/>
This list is a great resource! Thanks for all the tips and advice. I just<br/>
wanted to make a suggestion to cut down the size of some of these messages:<br/>
If at all possible, try to just include the relevant lines from a message<br/>
you&#39;re responding to; it makes it much clearer and easier to follow that<br/>
way. I know not everyone has nice fancy mail editors, but if you can do it<br/>
you should.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be the &quot;netiquette&quot; guy or anything, just trying to make<br/>
this easier to read for everyone... a couple of the past messages have<br/>
quoted the *entire* digest - yikes!<br/>
<br/>
Enchant on...<br/>
