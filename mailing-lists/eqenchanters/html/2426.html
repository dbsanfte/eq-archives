<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314656047">I tried to complete this quest this weekend and didn&#39;t have the faction for<br/>
it.  Not even with Illusion Troll and benevolence.  I tried handing in<br/>
Lumpkin&#39;s head and the bracers anyway, but got the &quot;Do more for Troll<br/>
Shadowknights blah blah blah&quot;  Maybe if I did the bone chips a few times...<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, Ratraz was about level 20 or so, but can hit fairly hard (30&#39;s<br/>
and 40&#39;s with a few double attacks).  He would usually drop a few gold, his<br/>
Warclub, the Bracers, his head, and sometimes another random item like a<br/>
silver ring or a research page.  Lumpkin dropped his head and a rusty<br/>
halbard.  I only killed him once.  Faction hits for Ratraz are much easier<br/>
to repair than for Lumpkin.  Ratraz is Dread Guard Inner, Dread Guard outer,<br/>
and Dark Bargainers.  All three of which can be repaired by giving the<br/>
scribe in the library red wine.  Lumpkin was Foreign Quarter Trolls.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never seen a way to increase that faction.  Good thing about Ratraz is that<br/>
his warclub is a pretty good 1H blunt (6 damage 32 delay), looks different,<br/>
and sells to vendors for around 5+ plat.  For 5 plat you can buy a lot of<br/>
red wine if you catch my meaning.<br/>
