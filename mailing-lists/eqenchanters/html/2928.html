&gt;quiet a while! The down side is...bored. Ran a shadow knight from 1-8<br/>

&gt;Tonight my lv 25 enchanter will be at Castle Mistmoore for the<br/>
&gt;Halloween bash (Our guild, the Nameless of Norath, on the nameless<br/>
&gt;server, is hosting a server wide raid).  I need somewhere interesting<br/>
&gt;and good for growth to hunt. But with enough people to not spend a<br/>
&gt;long time standing around looking for a group. Should I stay in Castle<br/>
&gt;Mistmoore? Or go else where? Or what?<br/>

thought it was one of the better zones in the game, and certainly<br/>
inside the castle itself one of the prettiest.<br/>
<br/>
But now it&#39;s just empty whenever I go to play, and with nothing<br/>
suitable nearby and not being able to gate around the world, I can&#39;t<br/>
really go anymore :-(<br/>
<br/>
A good alternative I also enjoyed was inside Cazic Thule.  A great<br/>
place to really get into proper mezzing and develop those skills<br/>
nicely!!  Can have some bad trains when it&#39;s busy though, but pick<br/>
your spot carefully and you&#39;ll be safe.<br/>
