<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Last night I went to Quenos to try and purchase a 
rune from Madam Serena.&nbsp; Apparently, she had heard of me from SOMEONE (I&#39;m 
not naming names) and refused to speak with me, simply took my money.&nbsp; Not 
a single illusion would change her mind, nor would any of my &#39;you like me&#39; 
spells.&nbsp; In an act of desperation I attempted to charm her with my magical 
spells, but apparently she is UNcharmable (I used a full mana dump 
trying).&nbsp; For those not knowing why I did this... pets always consider 
amicable, and a charmed NPC is always happy to trade with me.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, Leutenant something-or-rather saw what I was trying to do (after 
I had meditated back to full and was trying to charm her again) and hit me, VERY 
hard.&nbsp; So now not only do I have to find some way to make Madam Serena like 
me but I have a grudge with that hard hitting guy.&nbsp; Do I have to go spend a 
week in BlackBurrow killing wimpy gnolls or is there some other faster way to 
make Madam Serena interested in dealing with me?</font></div>
