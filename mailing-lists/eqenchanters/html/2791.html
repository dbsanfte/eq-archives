<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006449368">Never saw these questions, but i&quot;m a lvl 52 Enchanter on EMarr with about 60 <br/>
days played So I guess I&quot;ll answer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At 12th level, how does Charisma effect the length of the Charm spell?<br/>
Higher your CHA, better chance it will last longer.. Its all random.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is this effected by Tashan at all?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It reduces their resists so that your charm has a CHANCE to last a little <br/>
longer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;From 8th to 11th how well does this strategy work out on evens/yellows?<br/>
&gt;1) Tashan<br/>
&gt;2) Color Flux (after pet engages)<br/>
&gt;3) Root or Blind / Fear<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do NOT waste the manna on Blind. on NPC&#39;s.<br/>
Root.. *shrugs* ok.. WTH a lil better for that lvl.<br/>
<br/>
Fear? ONly if your pet is SOw&#39;d or the MOB is snared (snare and scare)other <br/>
wise your pet wont really land many blows, but the mob will be running away <br/>
and around ALOT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;From 12th on how well does this strategy work out on evens/yellows?<br/>
&gt;(Using highest level pet possible per level, fully buffed)<br/>
&gt;1) Open with Tashan<br/>
&gt;2) After Pet engages cast &quot;Whirl-Til&quot;<br/>
&gt;3) Cast Choke (optional)<br/>
&gt;4) Med til pet starts getting hit, cast &quot;Whirl&quot; again<br/>
&gt;5) Repeat 4 til mob dies<br/>
&gt;This looks good on paper, but would it work in the game? Recast time on<br/>
&gt;&quot;Whirl&quot; a factor here?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I havn&#39;t used it in a LONG time, but its a fairly quick recast, but the <br/>
spell never lasted long for me. Remember you CAN buff your pet up, AC, STR <br/>
Spells. Or other ppls spells. lvl 29 he can Dual Weild. Give him 2 weapons. <br/>
What I would suggest, it to get the mob as mad at you as you can.. have the <br/>
mob chasing you (run in circles) while the pet bash&#39;s hits, and taunts him <br/>
off you, when he&#39;s off you, reagro with a good blast.  Rinse Repeat<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What good are the vials created via Thicken Mana? Are they stackable if<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;use stackable vials? Can you use them in combat?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WASTE OF TIME, MONEY AND MANNA. Dont buy them.. Yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Has anyone figured out how to use the Gem Cutter? What benefit does this<br/>
&gt;actually have on Jewel Crafting?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one knows about the Gem Cutter Yet. So No clue.<br/>
