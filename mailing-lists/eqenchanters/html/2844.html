 </span></blockquote>Yup, Enchanters get more spells than any other class.  You learn pretty<br/>
quickly which spells you always have in the same slots (and hotkeyed) and<br/>
which ones you rotate in and out as needed.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, you&#39;ll have mez/enthrall on the same hotkey forever, and<br/>
it&#39;ll always be memmed.  Probably color flux/shift as well.  For lower<br/>
levels, choke and the brain smolder spell will likely be memmed almost<br/>
always.<br/>
<br/>
Spells like soothe and alliance aren&#39;t used in combat, so get in the habit<br/>
of making sure you have the right one memmed before casting.  <br/>
<br/>
Pick a slot for languid pace and another for wtyh, and learn which is<br/>
which.<br/>

&gt; Languid Pace.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re using root/blast as a strategy, why bother with wtyh and languid<br/>
pace?  Just blast &#39;em!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Offense / Defense: Abyssmal (have not been in melee long enough to get hit<br/>
&gt; very much).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This can be a problem later.  Offense is no big deal, but you should get<br/>
in the habit of taking a few hits once in awhile to keep defense up.  As<br/>
an enchanter, you WILL attract mobs sometimes, and it&#39;s very important to<br/>
be able to survive a few seconds of something beating on you.<br/>

&gt; gotten that high as I have cast it so little).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Replace WTYH and languid pace with your DD spell.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Mezmerise uses conjuration I realize, but I have yet to have a need for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is so foreign to my experience that I don&#39;t know where to start.<br/>
Root just didn&#39;t last long enough at low levels for me to use as crowd<br/>
control, so mez was VERY important for any overpull.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should I take the time to summon a pet and Mez it for an hour to get my<br/>
&gt; skill up? Will I need it later in my career?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you need it later, then practice it later.  The nice thing about spell<br/>
skills is that they can be practiced without combat.  A warrior who lets<br/>
his 2HS get behind has to fight tough critters with weak skills to get it<br/>
up.  A caster who lets conjuration fall behind can practice on her pet.<br/>

&gt; that I will lack the finess needed in a group of tanks when my guild goes on<br/>
&gt; raids and such. Anyone have any advice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If this is a worry for you, spend some time in groups.  Not only do you<br/>
make friends, you learn another aspect to the game. <br/>
