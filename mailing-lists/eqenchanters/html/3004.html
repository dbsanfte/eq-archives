<div id="ygrps-yiv-224835399">It really depends on what level mob&#39;s you are fighting and where.  Once you<br/>
get into level 50+ critters, rune IV is good for 3 maybe 4 hits. The taunt<br/>
factor I haven&#39;t really had a problem with.I&#39;ve always used rune&#39;s on<br/>
initial breaks of an area.  If needed in battle, don&#39;t chain cast it as your<br/>
targets health starts to fall, wait till they are under half. By the time<br/>
the spell goes off, they will be at 2 bubbles and the mob will be frenzied<br/>
on them. At that point, the cleric&#39;s (you do have a cleric with you, right?<br/>
if not, don&#39;t even think about fighting level 50+ critters) CH should be<br/>
flying through the air. If the cleric says &#39;OOM&#39;, is dead, or is LD, then<br/>
you&#39;re stuck with rune to keep someone alive. I used 8 Rune IV&#39;s to keep a<br/>
ranger alive in hate once. Critter never turned on me once. About to hit 52<br/>
and get Rune V, can hardly wait. I usually carry 80 peridots on me and end<br/>
up giving a stack of 20 to a cleric sometime on any raid I&#39;m on.<br/>
