<div id="ygrps-yiv-579640645">So why couldn&#39;t you Mesmerize 2 and pull the third?  It sounds like from<br/>
what you said it would make more sense.  Instead of only having 3-7<br/>
seconds you would have 30.  Wouldn&#39;t this work?<br/>

&gt; Yes they are very different. Mesmerize is a great spell for solo or<br/>

&gt; (Direct Damage or Damage over Time) spell on it, it&#39;s no longer stunned.<br/>
&gt; Lull makes the creatures less aggressive for a VERY short period of time<br/>
&gt; (2-4 seconds). This is useful when wanting to attack a camp of 2 or more<br/>
&gt; creatures they you couldn&#39;t handle alone or grouped with others. <br/>
&gt; Personally I didn&#39;t bother with Lull, but soon as I got Soothe (a better<br/>
&gt; Lull) my group and I started taking camps we would of normally gotten<br/>
&gt; slaughtered. My routine was, Soothe 2 of the 3 in the camp, while another<br/>
&gt; magic user would have the 3rd targeted. Once I Soothed the 2 (with out<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; resisting) I announced go, they would cast on the 3rd pulling it out of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; camp so we could fight it with out the other 2 attacking us all at once.<br/>
&gt; VERY important, Soothe only last 3-7 seconds, giving just enough time to<br/>
&gt; Soothe 2 and pull a 3rd, so do not waste time and make it as fast as you<br/>
&gt; can else you&#39;ll end up pulling 2 or 3 vs. just 1.<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Is mesmerize a better Lull spell or is it totally different?  I always<br/>
&gt; &gt;here people say &quot;Use Lull.&quot;  I always use mesmerize.  Is that bad?  If<br/>
&gt; &gt;they are different could you explain why?  Thanks,<br/>
