<b>Subject:</b> Skeletons and our spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093977721">Hi,<br/>
  I am an 8th level gnomish enchanter.  Do our normal spells around this<br/>
level work on skeletons?  The last few times I have engaged them, I have<br/>
cast things like Enfeeble and Mesmerize.  The spells were not resisted, but<br/>
there was no indication of a spell effect, as is normally stated when these<br/>
spells take effect (e.g. &#39;Your target has been Mesmerized&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what this means? I think the spells may have worked, but I<br/>
am not positive.  Can anyone shed any light?  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
