<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812314698">Some strategies.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, first one clarification, If your NOT grouped, it doesnt matter<br/>
whether you pet makes the last blow or not, it still takes a small slice<br/>
of the xp.  If your grouped and your pet makes the kill, it takes the<br/>
xp.  (serious pain)<br/>
<br/>
What i usually do is<br/>
1.  Tashan - This pissed off the bad guy and gets him running after me.<br/>
2.  Sit til he takes ne swing at me, then back off and let my pet take<br/>
it.<br/>
3.  Choke or other DOT spell.  Its important to cast these early, as<br/>
they take time to work to their best advantage.<br/>
4.  If its a tough mob, a languid pace, and or enfeeble<br/>
5.  Now I tend to melee the monster a bit to keep my pet alive.  Since<br/>
it has a languid pace on it, its not going to hit me often. I try and<br/>
keep a balance between using mana and health.  More mana of course as<br/>
its much easier to recover.<br/>
<br/>
Finishing strategies<br/>
1.  Second choke.  Its usually fatal after a few seconds<br/>
2.  Chaotic feedback.  i tend to avaoid this due to its poor mana/damage<br/>
ratio<br/>
3.  Fear.  This is deadly in conjunction with a pet.  basically the<br/>
monster runs and the pet beats on it.  The risk is you need to know the<br/>
running patterns of the monster, it running through a camp will get you<br/>
killed.<br/>
4.  whirl. I generally save this for tough battles with harder hitting<br/>
stuff.  Very effective when followed by a choke<br/>
<br/>
Other tips.<br/>
<br/>
Stand well back when you cast, as it really ups how much the monster<br/>
hates you. (Choke causes much less hate than the less powerful chaotic<br/>
feedback for some reason)<br/>
<br/>
Know where the zone is at all times.  Its always possible for another<br/>
monster to jump in, and the best defence there is knowing where to run.<br/>
<br/>
Mesmerization - use this if two mosters jump you.  Then hit the other<br/>
monster hard with the damage spells.<br/>
<br/>
Soothe - learn how to use this effectively on camps.  It takes practice.<br/>

Strategies when fighting solo, eh?<br/>
1. I cast my highest lvl pet (i am a 13th Gnome Enchanter, so I summon<br/>
the<br/>
12th lvl pet, Kali&#39;s (sp?))<br/>
2. Cast Lesser shielding on myself, and Mist (or Haze) and Strength on<br/>
me<br/>
and my pet.<br/>
3. Meditate to full mana/hp<br/>
4. Attack:<br/>
<br/>
The spells I like to have memorized at lvl 13 are:<br/>
Lesser Shielding<br/>
Strength<br/>
Mist<br/>
Suffocating Sphere<br/>
Chaotic Feedback<br/>
Whirl till ya Hurl  (necessary.  definitely)<br/>
Lull<br/>
Gate.<br/>
<br/>
After you buff yourself you can dememorize the buffs and memorize things<br/>
that can help you escape or debuffs, like Mesmerize, Fear, Eye of<br/>
Confusion,<br/>
Color Flux, Enfeeblement, etc.... here it is really a preference.  I<br/>
prefer<br/>
Eye of Confusion, Mesmerize, and Enfeeblement.<br/>
<br/>
When attacking, I cast Enfeeblement, then back off and let my pet hit it<br/>
for<br/>
a little, then cast Suffocating Sphere and Whirl in succession.  If the<br/>
Whirl was successful, cast Chaotic until dead unless yer pet is roughing<br/>
it<br/>
up, then save the mana and watch the pet deal damage.  Try to get a<br/>
chaotic<br/>
to finish it so yer pet doesn&#39;t steal exp from the kill.<br/>
<br/>
If the creatures proves too strong, and resists many spells or is<br/>
crushing<br/>
your pet, back off and you have several options. Try casting Eye of<br/>
Confusion and run, cast Fear and run, whirl and run, get a good head<br/>
start<br/>
and run for the guards, or you can gate, depending on where you are<br/>
bound.<br/>
If you are close to a zone point or guard, by all means run there.  Most<br/>
creatures will not be able to overtake you if you have a lead and jump<br/>
every<br/>
5 or 10 seconds to keep your lead. (dont run out of stamina though!)<br/>
<br/>
Rinse and repeat steps 3 and 4.<br/>

PS.  If you do group, get someone with a reliable ISP if at all possible<br/>
;).<br/>
I grouped with two rangers yesterday and we were attacking cutthroats.<br/>
Our<br/>
three person party could take on two or three cutthroats at once and<br/>
still<br/>
live (we did it earlier in the day) but as I was casting to lure one of<br/>
them, one of the rangers went linkdead, and another cutthroat spawned.<br/>
The<br/>
two cutthroats made short work of us, as the remaining ranger could only<br/>
handle one at a time.  The Thug that zoned in was white/black to me, and<br/>
killed my pet quickly and then hit me, bashed me, stunning me, and<br/>
killed me<br/>
in about 7 hits.  (When the linkdead ranger rejoined, he said his ISP<br/>
had<br/>
disconnected him. It happened again later that night.)<br/>

&gt;I was curious what strategies everyone is using when fighting solo?  I<br/>
&gt;tend to Root them, cast Chaotic Feedback, meditate (heh), cast Chaotic<br/>
&gt;Feedback and repeat until out of mana. After this I hope their dead or<br/>
&gt;almost dead. If not I run like heck!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I like grouping as much as possible, but the people I&#39;ve been grouping<br/>
&gt;with lately just don&#39;t seem to get it.  They want to fight Tombstone<br/>
&gt;creatures when everyone is half healed and low on mana. They also don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;let me bring out one creature at a time for the group to wallop.<br/>

&gt;I got tired of dying so I have been playing solo some more.<br/>
