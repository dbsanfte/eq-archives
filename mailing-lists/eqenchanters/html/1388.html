<div id="ygrps-yiv-16032125">Hail<br/>
Since I had such a great time trying to get the pet animation spells from<br/>
highpass, I decided to write a <br/>
bit of a story.  I&#39;m not a story writer and since english class in school,<br/>
I haven&#39;t written anything like this.<br/>
Its pretty cheezy, but I hope you enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
The question is about the pets.  How do you tell how many hp they have?<br/>
Also does anyone know the percentages<br/>
of getting a pet that cons white to you rather than blue?  I&#39;m level 12.  I<br/>
summoned like 5 pets or so and only<br/>
1 so far was white to me.<br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
I was in town by the vendor who wasn&#39;t doing business the day before.  <br/>
&quot;Hail shopkeep, might thee be interested in my wares?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Indeed, Azboklin.&quot;<br/>
*cha-ching*<br/>
Ahh, the nice feeling of receiving the profit from an adventure.  <br/>
<br/>
It was a most amazing day outside.  Just yesterday there were horrible<br/>
storms ravaging Qeynos.  &quot;Today is THE DAY!&quot;, I yelled out.  It was<br/>
certainly the day - I felt it in my bones, those rare ever so sought after<br/>
spells will be mine...<br/>
<br/>
First stop - the bank.<br/>
&quot;Hail Ken CopperHold.  I would like to use my bank box&quot;<br/>
&quot;Ah, nice to see you again, Azboklin.  It would be my pleasure&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You see...my destination is, well, not a nice place, and who knows the<br/>
tretcheries which lie ahead?  In another words - certain death.  Being the<br/>
schreud adventurer that I am, I always try to cut my losses.  I quickly<br/>
deposited my money and my armor.  I even tried to put my robe in the bank<br/>
but I forgot during my initiation into<br/>
the enchanter&#39;s guild it was magically bound to me and couldn&#39;t drop it.<br/>
In just a few hours I will be out in the wide world of Norrath with the<br/>
wind flowing freely though my robe...<br/>
<br/>
After buying a bit food and milk, I visited my master.  The enchanters<br/>
guildmaster of all qeynos.<br/>
&quot;Bless me o wise sage, for I am about to embark on the great journey of the<br/>
enchanters.  One which all enchanters<br/>
must make&quot;<br/>
&quot;Aye, you seek HighPass Hold Keep for spells.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yes sir, I do&quot;<br/>
&quot;May the power of quellious be with you my son, and may thy journey be<br/>
straight and true&quot;<br/>
&quot;Oh thank you master.  I will not fail.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, the pleasures of gating...<br/>
A little voice said, &quot;Welcome to qeynos hills&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The familar sites of BlackBurrow.  The foul evil gnolls would have to wait,<br/>
for now marks the beginning of my journey.  After a quick meditation and<br/>
invisibility, I set out for west karana.  In my previous travels, I have<br/>
seen markings on stones saying that is the way.<br/>
<br/>
I ran to w. karana without incident.  I then located the stone and followed<br/>
the road.  All goes well as invisibilty was still going strong.<br/>
<br/>
Oh no!  Somehow I lost the road.  &quot;Don&#39;t panic, just head east&quot; a friend<br/>
tells me.<br/>
<br/>
A little voice tells me, &quot;Welcome to North Karana&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
North Karana!!  What place is this?  I thought East Karana was next.  After<br/>
dealing with my confusion, I notice there&#39;s a river.  A river must<br/>
eventually lead to a bridge, no?  Excellent, in the distance I did see a<br/>
bridge.<br/>
<br/>
How odd, there are many a small fellow on the bridge.  I asked, &quot;Do you<br/>
know where I might find HighPass Hold?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Aye&quot;, he says.  &quot;A bit north east from here is a bridge you must go over.<br/>
Then you will be on your way.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Thank you kind sir&quot; and with that I was off.<br/>
<br/>
Over the rolling hills of the great North Karanas I traveled.  Who would<br/>
have thought it was so beautiful?.... ACK!!! I forgot to make myself<br/>
invisible.  Ohhhh nnooo, a lion comming straight for me!  The lion<br/>
claws sure did hurt.  No worries, I casted root.  That should solve our<br/>
little problem.  It resisted!  I try again.  Whew, it worked.  I ran as<br/>
fast as my feet would carry me, and quite fast indeed since that little fellow<br/>
blessed my legs with speed.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, a nice safe place to become invisible again.  Casting...  Nooooo, more<br/>
clawing... A wolf no less!  I give another go trying to solve this dispute<br/>
with no violence (especially since I had no weapons) but the lion reengages<br/>
his attack.  Tis not a good situation for our hero...<br/>
<br/>
(Note: For some reason I didn&#39;t have mesmerize memorized which was a<br/>
horrible thing to do.  That would have saved<br/>
me from the lion anyway)<br/>
<br/>
The all too familiar sights of the entrance of BlackBurrow.  I thanked<br/>
Quellios for bringing me back safely to allow me to start my journey over<br/>
again...<br/>
<br/>
I started off to goto west karana again.  This time though, I just headed<br/>
straigh east from the entrance like my friend suggested earlier.  After<br/>
fading away into oblivion, I run like the wind to the east.  I go for many<br/>
miles<br/>
until I reach north karana and this time I made sure I was still invisible.<br/>
 I run still, due east to east karana, totally ignoring my dead body lying<br/>
somewhere in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Success! The wood bridge the little fellow mentioned earlier.  I saw<br/>
another sign for highpass.  I followed the road being VERY careful to<br/>
always be invisible for there are evil beings in this place.  Unlike the<br/>
plains, this place is covered in a layer of gloom and darkness.<br/>
<br/>
After following the road for what seemed like days, I came upon a monstrous<br/>
pass in the mountains.  It must have<br/>
taken the ancient Norrithians ages to carve it out.  I travelled though the<br/>
pass without even peep out of a gnoll or any beastie for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
AT LAST.  HighHold Pass keep.  It seems like quite the complicated town, so<br/>
I ask someone,<br/>
&quot;Might you know the way to the bank?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Sure, I am headed there myself now&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My new friend knew this area well, for he ran through the passages at<br/>
amazing speed and we lost each other once or twice.  I was scared going<br/>
into the town because I have heard horror stories of the guards<br/>
automatically killing fellow enchanters on sight.<br/>
<br/>
I found out quickly that the guards didn&#39;t actually attack, but they glared<br/>
at me when I passed.  Reaching the bank was much easier than I had expected<br/>
with my friends help.  I was about to ask him if he knew where the rare<br/>
spells were, but he said there was an emergency and his friend was in<br/>
trouble and had to go.<br/>
<br/>
So there I was, standing all alone at the bank.  I promptly withdrew my<br/>
money and searched for the single most important vendor in my life.  I went<br/>
into a library of sorts.  There was a door next to the ancient manuscripts<br/>
and I entered.  LO AND BEHOLD, the vendor I seeked was sitting next to a<br/>
stack of books, quietly translating them<br/>
into a very strange lanaguge.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hail&quot; I said.<br/>
&quot;I suppose you are after the enchanter pet spells?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Aye, I am.  I have been through a distant and perilous journey to get<br/>
here.  I hope you do have them.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Indeed, you are in luck.  I have just received a new box of scrolls from<br/>
the scribe&quot;<br/>
&quot;Excellent.  I shall want to purchase a few of them...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
