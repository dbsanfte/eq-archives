<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277922185">*speaking of wisps....are these creatures found in Commonlands?  and are<br/>
*they not the ones that hold the coveted gems that we so often <br/>
*seek?  i&#39;ve<br/>
*not seen one in a long time, but last time I did, they /con red to<br/>
*me....I&#39;ve since gained a few levels, though...what level are they?<br/>
<br/>
Wisps are creatures hit only by magic, from which can be gained lightstones.<br/>
I don&#39;t think they carry any other stones or gems, but I could be wrong...</div>
