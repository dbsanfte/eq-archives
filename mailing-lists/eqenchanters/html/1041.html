<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015360523">I originally put a bunch of my skill points in wisdom (17) - don&#39;t ask me<br/>
why, I can&#39;t think of a good reason.  Plus<br/>
I chose Quellious instead of agnostic.  I didn&#39;t know about that one.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m level 9 now and it took a while and a bunch of effort to get there and<br/>
I&#39;m finally realizing my mistake.  I&#39;m sure if I had to do it again I could<br/>
do it quicker though.<br/>
<br/>
First question: Would it be possible to have two characters on the same<br/>
account with the same name or would you have to delete one first?<br/>
<br/>
Second question: Does not having a really high chr hurt your character alot<br/>
in the long run?  If I would do it again, I would put starting points into<br/>
int, chr and sta.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad you can&#39;t transfer spell books :(<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering what the recommendation is.  I plan on having a full and<br/>
fruitful life for my enchanter and wondering if starting over now while I&#39;m<br/>
only lv9 is better than going on to much greater levels with a &#39;screwed up<br/>
character&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance to all the wise enchanters out there.<br/>
