<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074732184">I have recently aquired a rune of howling from a goblin... can anyone tell<br/>
me what these are for?  It is worth over 2 plat at an npc, and no-one<br/>
responds to my offers to sell it.  Can I make this into a ring?  Has anyone<br/>
tried with enchanted silver?  Also is a lightstone ring possible?<br/>
