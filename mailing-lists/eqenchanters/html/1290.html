<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144873948">I am not positive this coralates, but let me tell you my secret for<br/>
keeping my loses down.<br/>
<br/>
First off, as you get higher and higher, this failure rate drops right<br/>
off. I did not fail a single ring last night at 88 skill.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the random number generator is dead against us, and sometimes<br/>
it is really for us. So what I do is fish. I fish through al the really<br/>
bad droughts of no successes, and when things feel like I am getting<br/>
lots more success, I break out my kit until it goes downhill again, then<br/>
start over.  Now, I am not sure that fishing and jewelry are in any way<br/>
related, certainly sas skills they are not. But as a programmer mysel;f,<br/>
I would most likely be using the same routiens for every skill&#39;s random<br/>
numbers, and hence my theory of the fishing for jewelery =)<br/>

&gt; With a skill of 52 I failed 6 out of 11 attempts at making jaded<br/>
&gt; silver<br/>
&gt; rings which, as you all know, become trivial at 40.  Is anyone else<br/>
&gt; having the same experience?  I had a wisdom of 101 and intelligence of<br/>
&gt; 132 at the time.<br/>
