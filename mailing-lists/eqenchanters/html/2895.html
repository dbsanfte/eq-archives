<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129013266">heh I agree.  I had someone come up to me in oasis last night and say &quot;Can<br/>
you buff me?&quot;  I had time so what the heck, I threw on UV, aug, str, endure<br/>
magic, obscure, and even a rune III.  Did I get a thanks?  Nope, the<br/>
response was &quot;can&#39;t you sow me too?&quot;  Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Next was the response from some people when I participated in a dragon raid<br/>
with my guild.  I&#39;m level 35 so I raised some eyebrows when they saw me<br/>
there for Nagafen.  However, I was there just to hang out with my guild,cast<br/>
clarity, and buff whenever my buffs were needed/wanted.  Many people were<br/>
thankful as I was the only enchanter at times.  Others though turned their<br/>
noses up (none in my guild of course ;)) at aug because it wasn&#39;t swift like<br/>
the wind and endure magic because it wasn&#39;t a higher form of that buff.  I<br/>
cast 100p worth of RuneIIIs and received thanks for a few but not for most.<br/>
A guildmate gave me a saphire so the cost worked out in the end but it made<br/>
me sad to see the reaction of some strangers to my help.  I&#39;m not aware of<br/>
all of the spells that take components but if you didn&#39;t know it does cost<br/>
your friendly groupmates to cast some of those buffs.  If it&#39;s a normal<br/>
group type situation I am happy to spend 20 or 30p for a night keeping the<br/>
puller or primary tank Runed.  It&#39;s part of what I do.  Those who request<br/>
Rune and offer no thanks are the ones that get me though.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are those who are confused why I&#39;m wearing such &quot;crappy<br/>
equipment&quot; when I&#39;m also wearing a Tranix crown.  Hehe, what kind of<br/>
question is that?  I&#39;m doing the best I can  8)   I was just very lucky my<br/>
guild asked me to roll on the crown during a FG raid and I won.  That was<br/>
another time I tagged along to cast clarity and didn&#39;t dream I would be<br/>
asked to roll on an item.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember to say please and thank you and it&#39;s so much more fun ;)  I&#39;m<br/>
happy to buff people for free mana permitting if they only would say thank<br/>
you.  Many do and I say thanks!<br/>

Subject: [eqenchanters] (Re: to Mark ) and a rant (sorry ;-) )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Last night I had a level 3 wizard come up to me and inspect me 9(!!!!) times<br/>
in about 2 minutes. It isn&#39;t like my equipment changed in that time... then<br/>
he asked the question I knew was coming. &quot;Got any stuff you don&#39;t need, or<br/>
plat?&quot;  &lt;~ asked for PLAT! He then followed with &quot;I&#39;m new to EQ.&quot;.  You have<br/>
got to be joking! A true newbie would not be asking for equipment, they<br/>
would be asking for what is safe to hunt here, and other basic questions. My<br/>
reply was (after inspecting him 30 times or so rapidly) &quot;No, I need the<br/>
equipment I have as I am using it. There is no such thing as money I don&#39;t<br/>
need, especially plat. Now go kill things for what you need like I did.&quot;  I<br/>
then got up and ran to my spawn point with SoW on.<br/>
<br/>
Beggars get under my skin in a heartbeat. I don&#39;t mind helping others; in<br/>
fact I enjoy it and give things away all the time. Nothing major, leather to<br/>
druids, etc and buffs are free. I just can&#39;t stand seeing people standing<br/>
outside a bank for HOURS pestering every person that comes by for stuff when<br/>
they could have spent that time leveling. One person I know had it hotkeyed<br/>
it came out so fast and so repeatedly.<br/>
&lt;/snip&gt;<br/>

&quot;Too bad Sentinel doesn&#39;t warn you when a beggar is around.&quot;<br/>
