<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683715207">Same here....<br/>
<br/>
	started a Rogue on Fennon Ro....got to level 6...gave up due to<br/>
crowdedness on the server...<br/>
<br/>
	moved over to The Rathe (i know, still crowded)...and started my<br/>
enchanter...am up to 13 now...but last weekend I started a Halfling<br/>
Cleric...leveled up to 5 in 2 days...easily.....and got smithing up to level<br/>
15...and not all from guild training either...hehe<br/>
<br/>
	I like the option of playing the pure caster (enchanter) OR the<br/>
hybrid class ....<br/>
<br/>
	In fact, this came up recently in our guild about playing more then<br/>
one character and having them (all, none, or limit to 2 or 3?) in the guild<br/>
officially....<br/>

	How many of you are playing multiple characters at the same time?<br/>
	I played first a dark elf necro up to level 16..<br/>
	my main character is now an enchanter level 20..I&#39;ve been playing<br/>
her a lot<br/>
	but since Saturday ( which is when I leveled ) I havent been<br/>
fighting at<br/>
	all, I&#39;m in one of those travelling / meeting people mood.<br/>
	Anyway, this morning I started a bard...I dont why ...I completely<br/>
gave up<br/>
	my necro when I started to play my enchanter. I dont want to do that<br/>
this<br/>
	time, but sometimes I get bored and I need something new...<br/>
