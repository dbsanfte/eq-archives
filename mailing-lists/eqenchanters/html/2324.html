<div id="ygrps-yiv-803879551">Getting to a level now where I would like to go find this item and I am<br/>
looking for any information on getting the necro who carries it, Pyzgim (sp)<br/>
to spawn in Q Hills. As I understand it, Tovax is the placeholder, but it is<br/>
it just luck and beating Tovax up repeatedly to get the other to spawn or is<br/>
something else involved ? I have only seen one of these since release and<br/>
would like to to take a few guildmembers out on a hunt for it.<br/>
