<div id="ygrps-yiv-549472940">It was a long night, but one that had seen me finish 30th level, and get<br/>
almost a fifth of the way into my 31st.  I was in Cazic Thule, and the<br/>
remaining members of an alligator slaying party had joined up with a<br/>
couple of intrepid adventurers at the temple commonly referred to as<br/>
&quot;Four Corners&quot;, in the same area that the Tae Avatar apparently spawns. <br/>
There for nothing more than a quick profit and to sharpen my skills, the<br/>
constant action and loot of the lizardmen was a welcome change from<br/>
alligators.<br/>
<br/>
One of our rangers was out scouting the area, looking for opponents<br/>
worthy of our party, when he found one.  His words came to our ears,<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m bringing the clay golem and a couple of lizards.&quot;  I stood from my<br/>
meditation, near a state of FOM, relying on Clarity to get me the<br/>
remaining bit of mana I had yet to recover.  My Rune intact, my defenses<br/>
up, I prepared myself and moved to a position where I could better<br/>
occupy the lizards while my party dispatched the golem, as per standard<br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
After casting Alacrity on the other ranger that was with us, I turned<br/>
the direction I knew the scout would be coming from, monsters close<br/>
behind.  Sure enough, he rounded the corner, followed by two lizardmen,<br/>
and then the clay golem.  My confidence turned to sheer horror as nearly<br/>
two dozen additional lizardmen quickly appeared.<br/>
<br/>
The party stood transfixed, not knowing what to think of such an<br/>
overwhelming force.  I&#39;m sure I heard the cleric of Tunare with us<br/>
whisper a brief prayer to his goddess to make our death swift and<br/>
painless.<br/>
<br/>
I could hear nothing over the hissing of the lizardmen as they descended<br/>
upon our party.  The scout turned around, and uttered an<br/>
incomprehensible oath of panic and frustration.  His next cry was<br/>
&quot;RUN!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We had no Spirit of the Wolf to speed our strides, and I knew that I, as<br/>
well as one of my companions, would most likely get lost trying to get<br/>
through the Maze.  As if that weren&#39;t enough, I was weighed down by a<br/>
good twenty stones of loot more than I could easily carry, even with my<br/>
enchantment of strength.  Retreat was an option, but at this point, not<br/>
a very good one.  Thinking quickly, I replied, &quot;NO!  Do not attack, but<br/>
stand!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Upon saying that, the horde was upon them.<br/>
<br/>
The magician gated.  I can hardly blame him.  I may well have done the<br/>
same had Gate been among the spells I kept memorized.<br/>
<br/>
I began casting as quickly as I could.  After my first spell, tiny motes<br/>
of light mesmerized many of our opponents.  Several resisted.  Upon my<br/>
second attempt, some more of them stared blankly, unmoving, but one<br/>
broke free of the crowd and charged me.  I was able to Enthrall it, but<br/>
at the cost of my Rune.  In the meantime, I saw our cleric backing away<br/>
from the mesmerized mass, pursued by a half dozen additional lizardmen.<br/>
<br/>
Quickly, I cast yet another Mesmerization spell, and thankfully, none of<br/>
them resisted my magic.  &quot;Run now!&quot; I cried.<br/>
<br/>
The cleric then gated.  The rangers stopped to look to me.  &quot;GO!&quot; was<br/>
all I said as I sat to open my spellbook.  Quickly, I memorized Gate,<br/>
and stood again.  As I did so, one of the creatures broke free of my<br/>
enchantment and charged.  By now, the rangers were nowhere in sight,<br/>
having obeyed my frantic shouts.  I began to cast as the lizard reached<br/>
me.  It&#39;s claws raked through my robes and armor spells, tearing apart<br/>
the protective charms the cleric of Tunare had cast earlier.  I was<br/>
jostled around, a lizardman hissing in my face, and behind him, I could<br/>
see his companions breaking free of my spells, the Golem turning it&#39;s<br/>
glowing eyes to my tiny body, a blasphemy upon the unholy powers that<br/>
had created it.  As the monsters turned as one to charge, I closed my<br/>
eyes, completed my spell, and opened them to the welcome sight of the<br/>
Southern Desert of Ro where I was bound, still alive and intact.<br/>
<br/>
My companions, as well, survived the ordeal, even getting lost in the<br/>
Maze.  I was most relieved to hear this, as I had done enough corpse<br/>
retrievals to make a mortician sick that evening.<br/>
<br/>
The point of this?  Always insure that your party trusts the enchanter. <br/>
And as an enchanter, always insure that you warrant your party&#39;s trust. <br/>
I am Lotwilla Verditius, Enchantress of the Eldritch Collective, and Law<br/>
Writer for the Lords of Light, and if my party&#39;s blood is to stain the<br/>
soil of Norrath, mine will be there with it.<br/>
<br/>
I am good at what I do because I truly hate to bleed.</div>
