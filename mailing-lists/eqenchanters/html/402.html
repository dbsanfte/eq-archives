<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913314951">Dear fellow enchanters,<br/>
<br/>
to keep the amount of postings in this list low, to avoid postings always asking the same questions, and to store valid infos, i suggest to create a FAQ mail that can be reposted at least once a week (just a suggestion) that includes answers to the most frequently asked questions on that mailing list. <br/>
<br/>
I also suggest to add a revision number for the following purpose: everyone having additional informations, or realising that inforation on that list is prooved to be incorrect is invited to repost the list with the changed information increasing the revision number by one. <br/>
Please make shure that the information you add or change is valid. Additionally add a line to the bottom of the list, containing date, your email and paragraph nummers you changed or added, e.g.<br/>
<br/>
04/27/99 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pfi@...">pfi@...</a> added question 1.01-1.20, changed question 2.47<br/>
<br/>
Anyone realising that there are 2 versions of this FAQ with the same revisionnumber and created by diffrent people at the same time, is invited to post the next revision number of this FAQ containing the compiled information of the two latter.<br/>
<br/>
If you just want to comment on the FAQ or ask, please change the subject of the mail<br/>
to &quot;Question on Enchanter FAQ rev.47&quot; or &quot;Comments on Enchanter FAQ&quot; to avoid mixing<br/>
up with the original list.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway this is just a suggestion, if there are negativ comments, we may drop the subject.<br/>
(Sorry for my bad english, as i&#39;m not a native speaker)<br/>

Section 1: Questions concerning location of enchanter spells<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Q1.01: <br/>
Where can i find the &quot;Enchant: &lt;metall&gt;&quot; spells?<br/>
A1.01: <br/>
The only place you can buy them is Neriak, Third Gate, Library (Building with large white steps), groundfloor, second NPC from the left. <br/>
<br/>
Q1.02: <br/>
How do i get to this library in Neriak alive?<br/>
A1.02: <br/>
To go there make shure to be invis until you are inside the library unless you are a darkelf, as the patrolling guards in commons sometimes attack humans and erudits, even with illusion: darkelf casted, as the illusion spell does not seem to hide faction standing. Cast illusion: darkelf when standing before the NPC, but consider first to make shure he won&#39;t attack.<br/>
<br/>
Q1.03: <br/>
Where can i find enchanter animation spells for lvl 8 and above?<br/>
A1.03: <br/>
They can only be found in High Hold Keep<br/>
<br/>
Q1.04: <br/>
How do i get to High Hold Keep alive?<br/>
A1.04:<br/>
<br/>
After entering from Kithicor, stick to the main path.  Now, when you get to a bridge, DO NOT CROSS.  The path continues if you look to the right. Eventually you will reach a Y.  You can see buildings to the right, you want to go left into the mines.  Cross through and you should come out in front of the keep.  In the mines, if I remember right, do not go through the square opening, go the other way. This pretty much goes with what I see on the map.  Stay invised, do not cross the bridge, and stay away from orcs and gnolls.  <br/>

Section 2: Questions concerning functionality of enchanter spells<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Q2.01: <br/>
Are there any enchant: ore or other spells available that will affect weapons?<br/>
<br/>
A2.01:<br/>
Other than the enchantment of brilliance line of spells no spells are known that affect weapons. there are rumours that these spells will be implemented one day.<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Section 3: Questions concerning spell research<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Q3.01: <br/>
When can i start researching and what do i need to start?<br/>
A3.01: <br/>
All magi begin researching spells at level 16. To do spell research,you will need a Tome specific to your class - these can be purchased in your guild hall. <br/>
Wizards use a Lexicon<br/>
Mages use an Elemental Grimoire<br/>
Enchanters use a Tome of Endless Enchantments<br/>
Necromancers use a Book of Dark Bindings <br/>
<br/>
Q3.02: <br/>
Are there any instruction books available?       <br/>
A3.02: <br/>
Research instruction books can also be purchased in your guild hall. All instruction books are written in languages other than common. Research instruction books will list the components needed to produce a scroll. Spell components can be found scattered throughout the world - they appear randomly on different creatures, so you will not have to &#39;camp&#39; a spot to get a certain component. Components can be stored and traded - ask around - 13 of the 14 classes out there will not be able to use the research component that you need. <br/>
<br/>
Q3.03: <br/>
How can i learn other languages?<br/>
A3.03: <br/>
To learn the fundamentals of a language, you must train one point in the language with your guild master. Once you have learned the fundamentals, you will be able to advance your linguistic skills through use - usually by listening to someone speak in that language. <br/>
As a tip form a group with different races, or persons speaking the desired language, everyone switching to his native language or the one he can teach, customize a social button with a gsay phrase of 3 to 4 lines, and start everyone to hit this button over and over spamming the others with that phrase in the other languages, maybe while fishing or any other relax time,<br/>
and note your skill going up in the languages spoken by the others.<br/>
<br/>
Q3.04: <br/>
Where do i find research components?<br/>
A3.04: <br/>
Research components are usually found on intelligent creatures, or on creatures that are innately magical. <br/>
<br/>
Q3.05:<br/>
Has there any spell ever been researched successfully? Or is the skill broken?<br/>
A3.05: <br/>
Berserker Strenght is obtained by combining both left and right pages 30 of Tasarin&#39;s grimoire, leaving 2 other slots empty in the tomb.<br/>

Q5.01: <br/>
I want to learn jewellcrafting what do i need basically?<br/>
A5.01: <br/>
Basically you need to purchase a jewellcrafting kit at about 1.5pg depending on your race/charisma and a lot of money, or alternativly 1 better 2 sponsors :-) It is advisable to train as much skillpoint as possible into the skill at your guild (about 21), as these advancements are far less expensive then failure as all ingredients cost the hell.<br/>
<br/>
Q5.02: <br/>
How do i advance my skill in jewellcrafting?<br/>
A5.02: <br/>
Start with cheapest gems and advance with your skill-lvl, using the following recommondation list. When you hit the lvl 23 e.g. start with silver + bloodstone for further advancements. The column mag.effects states whether the object can be magical when enchanting silverbar before crafting.<br/>
