<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768832142">For all the enchanters west of Highhold there is a very good method to earn<br/>
 some much need platinum for raising you jewelcraft skill.<br/>
<br/>
everyone who has been reading this list know about highhold pass and such...<br/>
and if you go there and buy ore...you can sel it to the locals in Halas or<br/>
qeynos<br/>
or anywhere is between because bug Dumb Barbarian Warrior Blacksmith<br/>
will get his butt whopped in HH where as a invis enchanter can just waltz in<br/>
<br/>
SELL ORE<br/>
SELL ORE<br/>
SELL ORE<br/>
<br/>
and if you get bored with that try your hand at balcksmithing..people will<br/>
pay<br/>
 decent for studs etc...if you want to raise you blacksmithing a bit...I<br/>
have am<br/>
thinking that enchant ore is a posibility for future spell..<br/>
