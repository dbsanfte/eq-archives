<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297869885">So I&#39;m planning on starting an Erudin enchanter.  I&#39;ve been going to a lot<br/>
of sources, studying jewelcraft, etc.  I thought it would be a good time to<br/>
ask opinions of people here where I should spend my first few levels.  I<br/>
hear the isle we start on is a pit and I should get off it as soon as I can,<br/>
but I suppose I need to know if I should just stop at Qeynos hills or keep<br/>
going all the way to the Steamfont newbie area? &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks.</div>
