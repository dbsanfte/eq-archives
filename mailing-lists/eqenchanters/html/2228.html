<div id="ygrps-yiv-716727055">At level 16 you should try your hardest to obtain Mesmerization. I still use<br/>
that one at level 26.<br/>
<br/>
As for your &#39;lower spells are better&#39; strategy, that will hold true for a<br/>
while, but not forever. You will reach a point with most of your lower level<br/>
spells where they will not be able to affect the creature you are fighting.<br/>
For Charm and Mesmerize, I believe that limit is at level 25, but don&#39;t hold<br/>
me to that. It DOES sound like you have a good start into realizing what the<br/>
enchanter is about. It gets tiring reminding people that we aren&#39;t<br/>
wannabe-wizards. Safe hunting!<br/>

&gt; Fellow Enchanters,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have found myself at level 16, not using my latest most powerful spells.<br/>
&gt; It is obvious to me that I can use Mesmerize (shorter casting time, less<br/>
&gt; mana) in more situations than Enthrall. I would rather cast 5 Suffocating<br/>
&gt; Sphere than 2 Choke (less aggravating, I have found). I didn&#39;t even start<br/>
&gt; using Fear regularly until I saw what Chase the Moon could do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Being in a group it is usually my role to save the poor wizard<br/>
&gt; overburning.<br/>
&gt; To halt the fight before an escape. I often need to cast 2 or three spells<br/>
&gt; in a hurry just as everything is falling apart. And that is at the end of<br/>
&gt; the fight. Not much mana, not much time. Lower level spells are better!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand that there are uses for the stronger spells. But in the<br/>
&gt; common<br/>
&gt; situation where you are hunting blacks and yellows in a group, numbers are<br/>
&gt; usually the main concern. Be it trains, be it bad pulls.<br/>
