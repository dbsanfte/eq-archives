<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194563091">I don&#39;t think that is true sir.  I have a human monk with 138 agility, and<br/>
he never carries more than 14 pounds, but he cannot run noticeably faster<br/>
than anyone else.<br/>

&gt; Ground speed is affected by agility and your current weight.  is not easily<br/>
&gt; noticed except with SoW or Selo&#39;s, since it magnifies the effect.  I first<br/>
&gt; noticed the problem with my enchanter, a human, and a human cleric...<br/>
&gt; neither were encumbered, but my enchanter was running much faster than the<br/>
&gt; cleric.  the only difference was his higher strength had him carrying more<br/>
&gt; pounds.  My Druid wood elf and a wood elf ranger, same agility.... druid was<br/>
&gt; faster, less weight.  my druid vrs one with a agility buff, the agi buff one<br/>
&gt; was slightly faster, but when I got my agi to 100, I could keep up with the<br/>
&gt; buffed one, (in the 120s).  We did those while at the same weight.... done<br/>
&gt; at different weights, the heavy one always lagged behind.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Conclusions...<br/>
&gt; Weight is deciding factor... encumbrance only decreases your agility to slow<br/>
&gt; you down, but each pound slows you as well.<br/>
&gt; Agility is a factor, but only to 100... which is max groundspeed at 0 weight<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have 101 agility, SoW, and keep my weight around 55 pounds.  I can run<br/>
&gt; circles around anyone in my guild, even the other shamans and druids.<br/>
