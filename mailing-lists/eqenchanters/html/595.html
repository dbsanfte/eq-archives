<b>Subject:</b> Re: Pet fighting strategies - questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-922551557">Hi fellow enchanters,<br/>
<br/>
ive some questions on fighting strategies with the pet, and the actual<br/>
how-to:<br/>
<br/>
1. my pet went into melee with some unwanted mob, and i have a safe position<br/>
and want the pet to come back to keep it alive, but i found no way to to get<br/>
the pet to do so? I just watch the pet getting slain and another 3 dagger<br/>
going lost.. any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
2. In group fighting with possibly more than one mob, i try to tag the<br/>
different monsters to cast my really fine enchanter spells, clicking<br/>
directly on the chest or head of a monster, and what did i tag? ... my pet,<br/>
my partymembers... everything clickable in around the next five miles... but<br/>
not the monster i want. F8 always tags my pet.. its quite useless. Sometimes<br/>
i loose lots of seconds runnig forth and back or around the battle to get<br/>
the mob tagged. The same with 3 orcs running towards us... strategy is<br/>
clear, just root, flux or mesmerize to control 2 of them and wait until the<br/>
party slain the first... but the run nearly one orc inside the other,<br/>
chances to tag them in time to cast...zero. its a stupid handling prob...and<br/>
that stupid pet is always in the line of sight. Suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
3. anyone ever casted a pet in befallen? i am getting mad about that, the<br/>
pet is that nervous runnig around me, and is alwas really far from me, and<br/>
get into melee with everything that moves. Once i casted 4 pets because<br/>
every 2 minutes i realized, oh the pet got lost somewhere i didnt even hear<br/>
a taunting attacker... i run around there a lot, from one door to the next,<br/>
and most times i dont even see, where my pet is, and where he gets himself<br/>
slain this time. suggestions?<br/>
