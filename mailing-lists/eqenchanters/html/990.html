<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620296413">OH OH! I GOT AN IDEA!<br/>
We Can have a Running Marathon to show that we are all<br/>
determined enchanter&#39;s. We should choose 1 server and<br/>
all enchanters from all servers (If diffrent make a<br/>
new lvl 1 enchanter) and run from Erudin all the way<br/>
to The Other End of Felwith to Show our determination.<br/>
hehe now that would be Fun and would help our cause.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Verant Guy #1: 	Hmm, sure is quiet in here.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Verant Guy #2:  Yeah, all the enchanters are<br/>
&gt; protesting by not playing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Verant Guy #1:  Really? We&#39;ll have to thank them<br/>
&gt; later. Look! The<br/>
&gt; &gt;feedback list is cut in half today.  You sure this<br/>
&gt; isnt&#39; a holiday?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Exactly.  This is the opposite of what we need to<br/>
&gt; do, although I could be<br/>
&gt; wrong.  It seems as though they are working through<br/>
&gt; improving the classes<br/>
&gt; by way of taking the most used classes first and<br/>
&gt; saving the least used ones<br/>
&gt; last.  Think of how many /petitions they would get<br/>
&gt; if the major Wizard bomb<br/>
&gt; spell wasnt working!  Or if Spirit of the Wind<br/>
&gt; suddenly worked like Fear.<br/>
&gt; Give them time... I think the thing we must remember<br/>
&gt; is BALANCE... they<br/>
&gt; must BALANCE the classes, and I&#39;m sure they are<br/>
&gt; aware of this and know what<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re doing.  Hell, they MADE the game... i&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; they will FIX it<br/>
