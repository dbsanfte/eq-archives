<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293933108">thanks for the great info (thanks to others who posted how to raise faction<br/>
too).<br/>
 <br/>
the only hitch to this is how do you turn stuff in when you are KOS to begin<br/>
with?  I attempted to turn in items to the warlord on the balcony in the<br/>
lake of ill omen and as soon as I left clicked on him with the item on the<br/>
cursor I became visible as he killed me.  At 170 a shot I lasted about 3<br/>
hits heh.  Did I just have bad luck, did I do something wrong, or has this<br/>
generally worked for people?<br/>
 <br/>
thanks!<br/>

If the banker is Scowling Ready to Attack I don&#39;t think you can bank with<br/>
him.  Especially since here are two bankers right next to each other. <br/>
Do the newbie quests as those raise all guild factions I believe. <br/>
Field of Bone hand in Scorpion Pincers <br/>
Lake of Ill Omen hand in Sarnak hatchling brains (Also can hand in those to<br/>
the Necro guild) <br/>
Warsliks Wood it is Goblin watcher torches or beads <br/>
Lake of Ill Omen it is froglok tongues. <br/>
One of the Troopers in Field of Bone near the city gate also takes 4 bone<br/>
chips. <br/>
All of these are 4 item at a time quests. <br/>
<br/>
After you have done those 4 a bit and you probably need Iksar and<br/>
benevolence to turn them in, but invis might work. <br/>
Then do the cuirskin quest. <br/>
Gate a backpack full of hides off scaled wolf pups and go to the merchant<br/>
near the monk guild. <br/>
Ask to preform a small service (spell preform or perform, I forget) and get<br/>
a special pack to put the hides in then combine them and hand it back. <br/>
This I believe raises resident faction. <br/>
