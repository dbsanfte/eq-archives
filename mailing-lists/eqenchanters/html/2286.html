Charisma has nothing to do with jeweling.  Most people<br/>
claim that wisdom is the key, although recent articles<br/>
may have suggested dex is involved.  I am a jeweler<br/>
with max skill and I practice at 191wis and 180int.<br/>
<br/>
As far as costs go,1000p should get you up to 100<br/>
skill.  The jump from electrum to gold (117-142 or so)<br/>
will cost you a couple thousand more.  Maxing your<br/>
skill at 200 is likely to cost 50,000 or more.  Lots<br/>
of fun.  As long as you are charging reasonable rates<br/>
for your product, you will be able to pay for your<br/>
practice out of your profits.<br/>
