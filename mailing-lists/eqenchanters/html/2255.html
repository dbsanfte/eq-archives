<div id="ygrps-yiv-489173586">On the topic of specialization, tho it is only recommended that Enchanters<br/>
specialize in alteration, it is HIGHLY recommended from myself. And Im sure<br/>
many other high level enchanters would agree with me. <br/>
<br/>
True, some people say conjuration may be good with mes and all, but honestly<br/>
that is our cheapest line of spells. If you really want to be a good<br/>
enchanter specialize in alteration, at higher levels youll be casting so<br/>
many alteration spells youll be happy for the slightly lower mana cost. <br/>
<br/>
Ive had to cast clarity and celerity on over 2 parties worth of people, and<br/>
Its hard to keep that demand up, and when I get swift like wind it will be<br/>
worse. I try to reserve all my casting to my specialization skill, (slow,<br/>
and if i need to do dmg i use my dots since they are alteration) In kedge<br/>
you will learn that the enchanter needs to cast augmentation on EVERYONE,<br/>
and last week i had 18 ppl to augment. The extra mana you save on 2 personal<br/>
buffs is at least minorly helpful (cha/agi). <br/>
<br/>
There was a time when I laughed at other casters because everytime they were<br/>
oom, i still had over 50-60, but since weve been hitting giants, imps,<br/>
kedge, (and very soon the planes), i have always been the lowest mana<br/>
because of the buffs (and I always drain my mana on buffing because it is<br/>
well worth the cost)<br/>
<br/>
So specialize alteration, youll be happy you did when you are able to cast<br/>
2400 mana worth of buffs on only 1900.<br/>
