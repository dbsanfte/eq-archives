<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-461797725">1. there is no Enchanter&#39;s recipe book for spells. This is good and bad, <br/>
good that you don&#39;t have to learn any other languages to read the recipe <br/>
books, bad because you have no idea what spell will be created unless you <br/>
find the information before hand. Also, on this note, i&#39;ve read that the <br/>
higher the page number, the higher the level the spell will be created.<br/>
<br/>
2. the mixing of the hate list people are talking about is 99% likely a <br/>
typo, I have seen &#39;nixing the hate list&#39; to describe Mesmerize&#39;s action and <br/>
the letter m is right next to n on the keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
3. crack rock is a lore item and will not combine with any metal to create <br/>
any type of item. nobody else has found any other weird item, pearl of odus, <br/>
light stones, etc to create any jewelry. apparently only generic stones <br/>
create jewelry. save the crack rocks to get mobs addicted to it so they <br/>
won&#39;t attack you because they want to buy your crack supply. a mob can never <br/>
have enuf crack and they know only Enchatners have the secret recipe to make <br/>
it. that&#39;s why mobs rage on us sooo much if we don&#39;t give them some crack <br/>
before the first draw of blood, at that point it is too late to offer the <br/>
crack since their passion is no longer focused on the smokin but on using <br/>
your head for their upcoming lawn bowling tournament. of course, the crack <br/>
recipe is only sold in Neriak, look for the merchant talking in elder <br/>
tier&#39;del about the frankenstein remote control xray robot death machine that <br/>
lives in his liver. use the keyword &#39;skeezer&#39; to get the conversation <br/>
rollin.<br/>
<br/>
4. there has been an update to jewelry on the test server and this will soon <br/>
be patched to the rest of the servers. jade+silver now makes a +5 mana and <br/>
+5 ac and it can only get better with higher grades of metal!<br/>
<br/>
5. if you haven&#39;t heard by now, Alliance is now actually useful. cast it on <br/>
others that you are buying/selling from when the items cost/sell more than a <br/>
plat to save yourself some money. if you already have wickedly high chr, you <br/>
might not notice any affect because you are at the best price level and <br/>
can&#39;t get any further increases in your buying/selling power. combining a <br/>
race illusion with Alliance may or may not improve your prices/keep you safe <br/>
from psycho guards, an email I got from GZ states that using Alliance and <br/>
race illusions together can and will get your better deals, more quests, or <br/>
keep you safe from certain psycho guards. this means that using both spells <br/>
at once doesn&#39;t always give enough of a boost in your overall faction to <br/>
notice the difference, which makes sense because if both spells &#39;had&#39; to <br/>
raise your level at least by one that&#39;d end up making that combo a tad too <br/>
powerful.<br/>
<br/>
6. if you have a spare minute or two, send a short thank you email to GZ at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Gzatkin@...">Gzatkin@...</a> for helping Enchanters get their spells tweaked so that <br/>
the hardest class isn&#39;t also the most frustrating class to play. GZ is the <br/>
head magic man at VI, in case you didn&#39;t know, and his main character is an <br/>
Enchatner so he has a special affinity for the class. he also Usually <br/>
answers politely asked and rational questions within a few days too as long <br/>
as you don&#39;t constantly pester him. can&#39;t say that bout UO!<br/>
<br/>
qrent`grammar is a tool of fascism`qent<br/>
<br/>
all information is correct as far as I know; however, since I am not the 2nd <br/>
coming of Christ(least that&#39;s what my dr keeps telling me), I have been <br/>
known to make the occasional innacurate statement.<br/>
