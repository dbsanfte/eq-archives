<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-926574894">I walked right in to the Library with my human level 5 enchanter and the<br/>
invisibility spell.  I was quite paranoid and recast it within the city<br/>
between zones, but the hard part of the journey was really only trying to<br/>
avoid the undead in the forest. (Got jumped by skeletons and saved by a<br/>
nearby darkelf.)  I just did it this time, without eq or money, to see if I<br/>
could do it.  The guard in the Neriak bank made me a little leary of trying<br/>
to buy it right on that trip ;P<br/>
