<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858485555">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
First I need Brad McQuaid&#39;s E-mail address, if you have it, please post it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not one to start a campaign and have never tried so, as they say this is<br/>
a first.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how many of you keep up with changes that are getting ready to<br/>
be made to the game, most are great and well needed, but one has me a little<br/>
worried.  Its the change to help control the Camping in the game.  Now don&#39;t<br/>
get me wrong this need to be looked at and fixed and I think they are on the<br/>
right path, but I have one big issue with it... read what he has to say at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqss.stratics.com/">http://eqss.stratics.com/</a> June 3rd.  Go to the 2nd set of red text titled<br/>
Anti-Camping Update from Verant and come back here to hear what I have to<br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
O.K. So now you have read it.  I&#39;m sure you have you own idea how this is<br/>
going to affect you, but here is my issue with this. Limiting it to one item<br/>
is bad in this way, I am not a camper that sits for hours to get an item to<br/>
sell, I hunt to get my item and stay so my group gets what they came for<br/>
too.  Because these items are hard as hell to get ( had to sit 3 days to get<br/>
a Blood Stained tunic) if I happen to see another for sell, I&#39;m going to buy<br/>
it so I can have a spare.  Why do you need a spare, you ask?  Simple. Bodies<br/>
still vanish and Varent HATES (taking 4 days and massive mailing to get) to<br/>
restore bodies from backup tape. Bodies still vanish for no good reason and<br/>
they want to give 25th and higher level people crap replacement kits.  There<br/>
are legitimate ways to  loose your body too.  Deep lava pits to name one.<br/>
We should be allowed to keep a spare of some thing in the bank if we wish.<br/>
Brad&#39;s plan would be great if it allowed you to have two of the item and no<br/>
more until you sold or lost one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Help me show him that two is the way to go with this.  Camping by super<br/>
powerful people so they can sell tons of these items because there is a<br/>
false supply and demand needs to be dealt with... allowing us to have two of<br/>
a lore item will be just as good as allowing only one in this matter. But,<br/>
allowing two will help protect you from spending hours if not days replacing<br/>
item when lost.  That item could be as close as the bank.<br/>
<br/>
Any feedback would be gladly accepted, but please post it, do not send<br/>
directly to me.<br/>
<br/>
I thank you in advance for your help.<br/>
<br/>
Scott<br/>
