<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286181102">Thanks for your lecture... Im sure criticizing the intelligence of others<br/>
will ensure that they never hit &quot;reply to all&quot; by accident again.<br/>
<br/>
And obviously you did not play the game when it game out. Who would wear a<br/>
Thaumaturgist Robe? I would have because it was better than my Senior Yellow<br/>
Apprentice robe, which I was very proud of btw, one of the few dark elves<br/>
that actually went to Erudin to get one (they were in Akanon as well, but<br/>
Gnomes were few and far between on the mainland) I wore that yellow robe to<br/>
level 29 when I finally got my Gossimer robe.<br/>
<br/>
There are still friends of mine that are just beginning eq, who Im sure<br/>
would love to wear a Thaumaturgists robe.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now  I understand that when reading your postings in Digest format, it is<br/>
&gt;possible to forget when replying, and to send the WHOLE digest out again...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it happens, I did it once, and posted a sorry.  <br/>
<br/>
What I am pissed about is that it was replied to FIVE FREAKING TIMES, and<br/>
none of you had the sense to trim the reply.  I hate to break it too you,<br/>
but enchanter is the smartest class to play in all EQ.  I can understand one<br/>
mistake, I can see past two, after that...  ( deletes and does not continue<br/>
this thought )<br/>
<br/>
Then, you begin to argue what robes are what... <br/>
<br/>
Tham Robe, AC5, 3 Agi   befallen...   why would you wear this?  3 Agi is<br/>
less than what is needed to give you the AC6 of a silk robe, or a senior<br/>
robe<br/>
Gossamer  AC8, from befallen, beautiful white color<br/>
Keeper AC8 2 Int... from temple of Ro<br/>
FBR   AC8 3 Int, 5 sta   from najena<br/>
Green silk drape, from one of the Sol Dungeons<br/>
SMR   lower guk<br/>
<br/>
also robe of ishiva and a few others that you will never see... Kunark<br/>
mostly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Graffe has started posting the updates on his wizard site on the<br/>
wizard board... very nice.  Any chance you can do the same Baelish?  Make it<br/>
easier to see what is up.<br/>
