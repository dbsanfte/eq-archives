<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103021948">you heard right, that is the only known location so far, though i do have a<br/>
theory.<br/>
I have recently found a place called Castle (something)mist. This castle is<br/>
inhabited only by Dark ELf (Or drow as i like to call them)<br/>
I was invisible when i went here, but my theory is that this place might<br/>
also sell it :/ I am not sure though.<br/>
I did not want to stick around long enough for my inviso to wear off. not<br/>
only were there Drow, but Gargoyles as well, and everything conned Red to me<br/>
:/ and i am level 10 now. So i wount be going back there anytime soon!<br/>

&gt; Hi, I am new to the list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can anyone please tell me the locations of the enchant metal spells. I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; been told Neriak, but I can&#39;t believe that that is the only location.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any help.<br/>
