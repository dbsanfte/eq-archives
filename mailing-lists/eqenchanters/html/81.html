<div id="ygrps-yiv-418849399">Just to Clarify:<br/>
<br/>
I know Borxx is a VERY high level Evil-Eye (25-35??). I was just saying<br/>
that I have seen him on the main level in RunnyEye and you don&#39;t have to<br/>
go down into the dungeon to run into him. Magik&#39;s email just confirms<br/>
this as he states a friend zoned into RunnyEye from Beholder and got<br/>
zapped by Borxx.<br/>
<br/>
The original email stated:<br/>
&quot;Borxx ... can be found in the bottom of the dungeon ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>

I have a Halfling Cleric friend that is level 22......he was coming thru<br/>
Beholder with two eyes in tail and zoned.......when he zoned he had full<br/>
health bar......he zoned into Runnyeye and Borxx was stadning in front<br/>
of<br/>
him and hit him with a lightning spell......the msg said you have been<br/>
hit<br/>
but lighting please wait......he was blasted bak 10 STEPS!!!.....into<br/>
the<br/>
Beholder Zone BAKWARDS!!!......and when he rezoned he watched his<br/>
hitpoints<br/>
go from FULL to a SLIVER OF A BAR!!!!!.......Borrxx is like level 35 but<br/>
if<br/>
youd like to try him be my guest......and I as well have a 16th lvl<br/>
Druid in<br/>
Rivervale......but the entrance is NOT what Im talking about....the<br/>
front<br/>
part and upstaris is VERY easy......and you can get thru it<br/>
easily....with<br/>
NO TROUBLE&gt;.....but go any further inside and your toast.......TRUST ME<br/>
ON<br/>
THIS!!!<br/>
