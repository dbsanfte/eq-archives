<div id="ygrps-yiv-784739183">Almost forgot!  Color Flux is your friend!  Use it, but be careful of what<br/>
is around you because it is an Area Effect spell.  Say, for example, you are<br/>
fighting a black bear in WC and you Color Flux it as all good Enchanters do.<br/>
But you didn&#39;t notice the asp that slithered near by after you started the<br/>
fight and got caught in the CF area.  The CF may or may not have worked on<br/>
the asp, but either way you will have a pissed off snake in your face fairly<br/>
quickly.  At level 4 your are done for.<br/>

&gt; &gt; do you mind telling me how you advanced in level without using them<br/>
&gt; &gt; that much?  Is it because you group all the time?<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When soloing always use an animation (later on you can use charm<br/>
instead)...<br/>
&gt; they are your main damage dealer.  They can&#39;t take much damage so you need<br/>
&gt; to watch them closely.  One of the best things about being an Enchanter is<br/>
&gt; that you have many options.  This is one such option at level 4:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Start with Tashan from a distance and follow ASAP with Suffocating Sphere<br/>
&gt; before the critter reaches you (you can usually get both spells off if you<br/>
&gt; are far enough away).    The critter should be on you and your animation<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the critter, so back off a bit and let your pet tank.  Next debuf the<br/>
&gt; critter futher with Enfeeblement (this strength debuf along with the DOT<br/>
&gt; strength debuf will lower the average total damage the critter will do).<br/>
&gt; Now just wait (med if you want to) and watch your animation&#39;s health...<br/>
tank<br/>
&gt; for it when needed.  When the critter is  almost dead cast your DOT again<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; finish it off (or if your Evocation is high enough use your DD).  I&#39;m<br/>
making<br/>
&gt; the assumtion you&#39;ve already buffed yourself and your Animation before<br/>
this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another option in a safe area is to follow the same line except cast fear<br/>
&gt; when you&#39;re done debuffing... the pet will follow and hit the critter<br/>
while<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s running away.  Rinse and repeat until dead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
