<div id="ygrps-yiv-811281892">I have heard that enchanters can do every quest in the game with the aid <br/>
of illusion spells and benevolence. Since I&#39;m nearing level 20 I&#39;m <br/>
thinking I&#39;d like to try some of the better quests. Does anyone have any <br/>
recommendations for good quests? Perhaps the Grobb Cleaver?<br/>
