<div id="ygrps-yiv-493774330">Greetings all,<br/>
I have read with great interest some of the rants on this here list and I<br/>
have to tell ya, y&#39;all are hilarious.  Everyone has their points and they<br/>
are good points.  2cp&#39;s worth.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to the reply...<br/>
I was fortunate enuf to have a higher level friend who obtained for me the<br/>
ruined totem staff, there is a certain ghoul that has taken more of my lives<br/>
than anything else and I asked him to get it for me for the sole purpose of<br/>
retribution, big time!!  as for hitting other creatures with it, I hardly<br/>
use melee anymore, and I am only 10th lvl, but the Magic properties of this<br/>
fine weapon, the hitting of magical creatures, is well worth carrying it,<br/>
and besides, I could always sell it for the 3p+ I was offered for it from<br/>
the merchants.<br/>
