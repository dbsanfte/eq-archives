<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171426130">I agree with you on everything except one. If my party is fighting 3 or more<br/>
creatures I don&#39;t bother with Enthrall. My mainstay in that case is<br/>
mesmerization. I was in a party in Permafrost the other day and the tank<br/>
pulled 14(!) assorted ice goblins. There were some hairy moments in that<br/>
battle with lack of communication between 2 of the tanks, but then score at<br/>
the end was Party:14 Goblins:0. Don&#39;t underestimate that AE mesmerize, just<br/>
don&#39;t stand too close.. hehe.<br/>

&gt; I generally cast Alacrity on my melee group members and tepid deeds and <br/>
&gt; disempower on the critters.  Disempower seems to work better than<br/>
&gt; enfeeblment <br/>
&gt; as far as I&#39;ve seen for getting the mobs to fit for less damage.  If I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; trying to save mana and have a bunch of creatures though I usually stick<br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; Alacrity, and enthrall what we&#39;re not fighting and when we go to fight the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; creature casting tepid deeds.  The speed buffs/debuffs are a big help.<br/>
