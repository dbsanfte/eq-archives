This Program would allow Users to Create their Own EQ Server for play, Ie: <br/>
(UOX, FuseRun for Ultima Online).  Granted I know not the specifics of such <br/>
a program except what is being shown by the creators, however Verant is <br/>
trying to stop this creation.  In my opinion and other players near me, this <br/>
would be a blessing, Cutting out the Internet for play with a few friends on <br/>
a IPX or what not.<br/>
<br/>
Please view this site and make your own opinions. Should you agree with us, <br/>
please email Verant (there is a link) And Inform them of your opinion as we <br/>
have done.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for Letting me hop on the Soap box for a moment.<br/>
