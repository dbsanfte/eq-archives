<div id="ygrps-yiv-501218023">Well, I&#39;m 18th DE and curious.  So I spent an evening...killed almost 100<br/>
goblins and sarnaks, with appropriate faction increases.  Even found<br/>
out there are at least three different goblin factions.   (News to me...)<br/>
<br/>
Well, even after that and with Alliance cast, the guards are still scowling.<br/>
Any ball-park figure on how MANY kills are needed?  I&#39;d really like<br/>
to turn in the couple of dozen brains and torches.  ;)<br/>

&gt; Not only goblins, but sarnaks as well... both will increase your Firona<br/>
Vie<br/>
&gt; faction, as well as your factions with the Legions of Calibis (Iksar<br/>
&gt; Troopers).<br/>
