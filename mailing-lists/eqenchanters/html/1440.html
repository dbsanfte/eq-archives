<div id="ygrps-yiv-143921044">Hail friends...<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve all been quiet lately....must be having a lot of fun, as I am.<br/>
Research has added a new element to keep me occupied....and now that I&#39;ve<br/>
passed the level 16 mark (made 17 last night), Enchanting Electrum is a new<br/>
challenge as well...<br/>
<br/>
But my questions are:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Does anyone know what the &quot;Effect&quot; (if any) is from the Blackened Wand?<br/>
has anyone tried Identify Item on it to see if the Effect shows up?  I<br/>
obtained this recently, but the Effect area is left blank.  ?<br/>
<br/>
2. I&#39;d like to be able to equip the above Wand, but that would mean a<br/>
switch from my 2H Totem to a 1H Blunt.  The best I&#39;ve seen is a Staff Of<br/>
Writhing.  Any idea where I might obtain one?  Known locations to hunt?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
May Tunare bless you and the power of Polaris possess you!<br/>
