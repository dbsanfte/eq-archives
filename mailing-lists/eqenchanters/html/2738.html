People, check your sources before listening to Jeremy Caswell.<br/>
I am going to be curt.<br/>
<br/>
A. Agility does do more than raise your AC in this game.  If you play a<br/>
melee class, and you get it up to 152 like my level 43 monk on TZ has it,<br/>
you will see a drastic increase in your dodging and riposte.  When<br/>
pulling, i use all my AC equimpent, and when fighting I use my agility to<br/>
equipment. So to say that agility is completely useless just amplifies<br/>
ones ignorance.  Now if one were to qualify...saying that for most caster<br/>
based classes, it has a relatively insignificant effect, that would be<br/>
more correct.<br/>
<br/>
B.  The formula calculating you AC based on your agility IS linear, and is<br/>
dependent on your level.  Granted it is based on a few variables, but once<br/>
these are defined, the final AC value is static.<br/>
<br/>
C. and for the supposedly most important reason not to wear the robe:<br/>
color... well there is no accounting for taste.  Wear whatever color you<br/>
wish, and people, just have fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck all<br/>

&gt; Actually, I did play in the beginning, when the gossamer robe cost over a<br/>
&gt; hundred, if you found someone selling it, people dreamed about when they<br/>
&gt; would one day have a FBR, and people wondered what that guy in the OOT was<br/>
&gt; for, he was wearing a funny robe.  No one had heard of the SMR yet.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now  lets talk the merits of the Tham robe...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your senior robe is AC6... ( +2 mana, that&#39;s useful )<br/>
&gt; the Tham robe is AC5 +3 agility   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now  unless you still live in some dream world thinking that Agility has<br/>
&gt; some mystical function in the game; even when everyone, including Brad<br/>
&gt; McQuiad, the producer of the game says it does not; you must know that<br/>
&gt; agility really only affects your AC.  For Erudites, Humans, and other lower<br/>
&gt; agility races, at the levels that you would wear the tham robe, it takes 4<br/>
&gt; agility to raise your ac ONE point.  3 agility does not raise it one whit.<br/>
&gt; If you are Dark elf or other higher agility race ( i.e. more than 75 )  it<br/>
&gt; take 6 or 7 points of Agility to raise your AC ONE point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now keep in mind, agility affects your total AC, not the AC on the item, and<br/>
&gt; that agility HAS NO OTHER FUNCTION IN EQ OTHER THAN RAISING YOUR AC.  (( For<br/>
&gt; anyone piping up that Agility affects your channeling, get a gun and shoot<br/>
&gt; yourself, you are hopeless ))<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, here is the real kicker... based on your LEVEL ( nope, still not your<br/>
&gt; agility, but keep that dream alive ), items add more AC than they list in<br/>
&gt; their description.  An ac 6 item adds 8-9 to your real AC number.... a AC5<br/>
&gt; item adds like 6-7.  ( I do not care what real number it really is, like I<br/>
&gt; said, it is level based, not a linear formula, and all results will vary<br/>
&gt; anyway)  To add to your misery, just like the Agility calc, it throws away<br/>
&gt; fractions, so 8.999 is 8 and 9.001 is 9.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now  for the most important reason to NOT wear the tham robe... IT IS CRUD<br/>
&gt; BROWN.  <br/>
&gt; If you cannot get a pure white Gossamer robe, the pinnacle of fashion, get a<br/>
&gt; green senior, red senior, Blue senior, or even a Purple Senior from the<br/>
&gt; necros in FP.  Just do not wear those gay ass yellow or violet senior robe.<br/>
