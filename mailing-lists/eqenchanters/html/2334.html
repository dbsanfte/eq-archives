<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278913444"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;1) Is there any armor available that gives the look of plate, chain, or at<br/>
&gt;&gt;least leather?  I&#39;d like to be a little less naked when taking the form of<br/>
&gt;&gt;a class that doesn&#39;t have robe graphics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something that looks pretty nice is a green silk drape.  It looks like a<br/>
green tunic when you illusion to another form.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;2) Do any of the illusions provide racial abilities (wood elf forage, dark<br/>
&gt;&gt;elf hide, etc. in addition to sight improvements?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe you get sight abilities with illusion elf, troll, etc.  I wonder<br/>
if the human illusion gives increased exp...?  I used illusion human for<br/>
this purpose but am unsure if it made a difference<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;3) How does Alliance work?  Does it always raise one faction level (e.g.<br/>
&gt;&gt;dubious to apprehensive)?  Does it decrease faction with negative faction<br/>
&gt;&gt;groups (e.g. if I cast it on a deathfist orc, will it make me less liked<br/>
&gt;&gt;by the commons residents)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing to note here in addition to what others have said.  You can have<br/>
alliance (not sure about benevolence) cast on only one target &quot;group&quot; at a<br/>
time.  In other words if you alliance a guard you are good with all guards<br/>
in the target guard&#39;s group.  However, if you then decide to alliance a<br/>
merchant you lose the alliance on the guard group so keep track of who you<br/>
target.  Finally, a counter between you and your target counts as a wall and<br/>
will block your spell.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;4) At what level can I go into the evil cities?  My gnome necro can go<br/>
&gt;&gt;into Neriak - can my agnostic enchanter go there in gnome form?  Can I go<br/>
&gt;&gt;into Grobb or Oggok in dark elf form, or must I wait for ogre/troll form?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I got my stein at level 12 (as a high elf enchanter) by doing the quest.  I<br/>
was able to use illusion dark elf and alliance to get into Oggok and get the<br/>
stein.  However, on a recent trip at level 16 I used illusion dark elf and<br/>
although I didn&#39;t get killed no one would deal with me even using alliance.<br/>
I got a message to the effect of &quot;enchanters aren&#39;t welcome here.&quot;  I think<br/>
they might have changed some things to make getting the stein harder.<br/>
Either that or I did something to ruin my faction with every Ogre in the<br/>
city (cept for the banker fortunately).<br/>
