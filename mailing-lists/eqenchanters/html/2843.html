<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Another reason this is a bit more difficult for me is that I am primarily<br/>

&gt;roots and blasts while I wait for Root to break and cast WTYH, Choke and<br/>
&gt;Languid Pace.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds smart to me. You are on your way to becoming a great solo/duo<br/>
Enchanter. In your early years, you are going to find that you will be<br/>
using a few spells in particular, while some others hardly ever make it<br/>
from the spellbook to the memmed strip. This is the case if you are going<br/>
to be grouped with the wife alot, since your primary goal beyond crowd<br/>
control is to keep the frail wizard from taking a dirt nap.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Offense / Defense: Abyssmal (have not been in melee long enough to get hit<br/>
&gt;very much).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is going to be a big problem for you later in life. You HAVE to get<br/>
that defense up my friend, because at high levels, you are going to get hit<br/>
ALOT. Offense isnt a big deal. I think the last time I melee&#39;d anything was<br/>
30 levels ago.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Evocation:Is so bad that I don&#39;t think it is above a 1 (if it has even<br/>
&gt;gotten that high as I have cast it so little).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about this, it is a good idea to at least<br/>
try and nuke a bit as you increase in level, so that your Evoke skill<br/>
increases as you go along. My Evocation is in the 230&#39;s, and I cant<br/>
remember the last time I fizzled on a nuke. This will be pretty useful when<br/>
there is no Mage or Wizard in the group. Later, when you start hunting<br/>
things that beat the tar out of you in 3 hits, its going to be necessary to<br/>
sit back while the tanks soak up damage. The tanks will probably be a<br/>
little peeved if you are the only caster and you arent nuking :)  But if<br/>
you plan on grouping with your wife alot, you wont have a need to<br/>
nuke...regardless, its still a good idea to increase the skill quick as you<br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Conjuration: Whats that for? At 4th level, she had Root, and I had Fear<br/>
&gt;ready so she could root again.  At 8th I rooted / feared and that was it.<br/>
&gt;Now at 12th I WTYH. No need for a pet. I have yet to cast my pet spell. And<br/>
&gt;now that I have Charm.... I&#39;m not even sure I will ever use it.<br/>
&gt;Mezmerise uses conjuration I realize, but I have yet to have a need for it.<br/>
&gt;Color Flux has give me the time I need to get off a WTYH or fear as we have<br/>
&gt;been focusing on wandering mobs and 2 to 3 mob spawns.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Conjure...this is arguably your most important skill. Mesmerize and<br/>
Mesmerization are going to be the most important spells in your arsenal<br/>
soon. When you start to go into dungeons, or densely packed outdoor areas<br/>
(Aviaks in South Karana, Derv Camps etc...), your puller is going to come<br/>
back with two or three mobs at times. Your job will be to put the mobs the<br/>
party isnt fighting to sleep. Crowd control is an art form, and you are<br/>
going to have to learn it sooner or later, because this is going to be job<br/>
one for you.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t even have time to cast Tashan as the mobs die so fast. I did in the<br/>
&gt;begining, but it seemed a waste of mana very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, later in life, mobs will have alot higher magic resistances. At<br/>
level 53, this spell (Tashania, its lvl 44 equivalent)  is ALWAYS on my<br/>
memmed strip.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Should I take the time to summon a pet and Mez it for an hour to get my<br/>
&gt;skill up? Will I need it later in my career?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go to the newbie grounds and mez bats and rats and whatnot for a couple<br/>
hours. Your conjuration skill is absolutely essential later on. You will<br/>
use your Mesmerize line more than you can possibly imagine ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My divination and Alteration are maxed. I love illusions (div) and buff<br/>
&gt;everyone I see normally. =)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kind of Enchanter. Mana is free, so my buffs are too :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know my wife and I will go far together with this combo, but I am worried<br/>
&gt;that I will lack the finess needed in a group of tanks when my guild goes on<br/>
&gt;raids and such. Anyone have any advice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you are on your way to being a good solo or duo Enchanter, but<br/>
you need to learn crowd control. Instead of Soothe, try having the wife<br/>
nuke one in a group of 2 or 3 mobs. As they charge her, put one to sleep.<br/>
Then the other. You both may die every now and again, buts its a helluva<br/>
lot better to die learning crowd control at level 12 than at level 42 in<br/>
dungeons, when an Enchanter is the key to keeping the entire group alive.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the most fun (and hardest) class to play in the game. You are<br/>
going to have a blast!<br/>
