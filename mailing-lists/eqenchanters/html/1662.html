<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885430027">Yes, this was a very big and very annoying problem for me as well.  The<br/>
reason is that<br/>
you just entered a new circle, so you are not as good with the new spells as<br/>
with the<br/>
older ones.  The best thing for you to do is to max out your spell skills by<br/>
repeatedly casting a cheap level 1 spell until you get your skills maxed.<br/>
<br/>
Permafrost is great for levelling fast and making good money at your level.<br/>
Level 17-19 went by quickly for me, I spent pretty much the whole time in<br/>
PF.<br/>

&gt;I recently hit level 16 with my enchanter, and got some great new spells<br/>
&gt;like Chase the Moon, Sanity Warp, etc...but I have noticed a drastic<br/>
&gt;increase in the frequency my spells are resisted. Green cons consistantly<br/>
&gt;resist Sanity Warp, the same monsters that I killed with Chaotic Feedback<br/>
&gt;when they were blue cons. I have begun using Tashan again (Ever since level<br/>
&gt;10 or so, I stopped using it), and Tashan seems to help the situation. I<br/>
&gt;just think it is strange that I am having such a problem with monsters<br/>
&gt;resisting more powerful spells, when lesser spells seemed to work on them<br/>
&gt;great at lower levels. For instance, wisps now con green, but often resist<br/>
&gt;Sanity Warp. I was murdering wisps with Chaotic Feedback just two levels<br/>
&gt;ago. Same thing is happening with monsters I am just now starting to fight<br/>
&gt;alot, like crocs in the Oasis, undead in Unrest, and Borer and Scythe<br/>
&gt;Beetles in the Karanas. I am at a loss. Anyone else experience this kind of<br/>
&gt;thing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can&#39;t wait for Tashani...<br/>
