<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930414828">No if they took away a wizzies fast casting DD spells and replaced them<br/>
all with DD like an enchanters, or took away a magicians ability to<br/>
summon a pet, these are the sort of nerfs that are unacceptable,  necros<br/>
and charm was never a very good mix (hell by the time they got it they<br/>
could use it for about 4 levels before the mobs were immune to it)<br/>
Enchanters are *the* charming class, and share Fear line with necros<br/>
nerfing the necros fear was a bad thing too. don&#39;t mess with the class<br/>
core abilities, it really irks people off!</div>
