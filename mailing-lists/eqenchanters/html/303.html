<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The bank is in the keep itself, which is another zone entirely.  Inside<br/>
&gt; the keep is safe (unless your a dark elf) EXCEPT for the basement.<br/>
&gt; Coincidently, the bank is in the basement, and is as far as I would go<br/>
&gt; as all the hostiles conned red to me at 16.<br/>
