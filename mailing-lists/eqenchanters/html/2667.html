<div id="ygrps-yiv-941803068">I have a 5th level High Elf enchanter and have a few questions.  Sorry if<br/>
some sound pretty lame but I&#39;ve haven∩┐╜t spent much time with an enchanter<br/>
in the group.<br/>
<br/>
1&gt; How do I get into Neriak without a guard playing squish the elf with me? <br/>
2&gt; Can you have an animation and a charmed pet at the same time?.<br/>
3&gt; Do charmed pets follow commands?<br/>
4&gt; Mez never seems to do anytime for me.  What am I missing?<br/>
5&gt; Why does my pet always stand on what I&#39;m trying to loot?<br/>
6&gt; Is being agnostic going to cause grief later?<br/>
7&gt; Any other tips you might have would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

&gt;The Iksar spell was the first &#39;Quest&#39; spell but there are certain spells we<br/>
&gt;have to go into a particular place to get. <br/>
&gt;Example. <br/>
&gt;All our Pet spells starting with level 8 are in High Hold Keep. <br/>
&gt;All our Metal enchantment spells are in the library in Neriak. <br/>
&gt;Our Enchant Mana spells are either in OOT or the Brownie Village in Fay. <br/>
&gt;Our Breeze (Low level Clarity line) is in the city at Firona Vae <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For another they might be considered risky quests. <br/>
