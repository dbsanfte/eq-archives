<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084923941">Our pets don&#39;t listen, but at level 12 we get the spell Charm which<br/>
brings new pets under our control. The charmed pets DO listen, so learn<br/>
your pet commands.  Charming is great to do when you are in a group and<br/>
don&#39;t really need an animation.  when fighting two monsters at once,<br/>
Charm one monster and tell it to attack the other.  By the time charm<br/>
wears off you should have dispatched the first, or come close, so you<br/>
can then focus on the one you had charmed.  Its also pretty good for a<br/>
laugh to see monsters fighting each other.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  if your pet gets killed while still charmed, you lose all the<br/>
loot it may have had.  try not to get the pet killed unless you are<br/>
ding so strategically.<br/>

&gt; hit hit.  So,<br/>
&gt; *don&#39;t let your pets wander off and attack as you<br/>
&gt; may see more <br/>
&gt; *of the bad<br/>
&gt; *guys at once than you intended.<br/>
&gt; *<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I Thought that our Enchanter pets didn&#39;t listen to<br/>
&gt; the pet commands that<br/>
&gt; necro and magician pets do?   I tried most of the<br/>
&gt; /pet soandso things and it<br/>
&gt; just had a mind of its own, much like a pet cat :P<br/>
