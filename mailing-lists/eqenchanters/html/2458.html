<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704219101">I have had a lot of fun and amazing experience 13-15<br/>
in Unrest, killing the yard beasts (I am 15 now). Solo<br/>
there can be tricky at 13, but doable at 14+. Get<br/>
couple more people and it is non-stop killing (and<br/>
non-stop experienc). As an enchantress, I find my<br/>
talents particularly useful there, since the beetles<br/>
and other undead aggro so easily. Mes them, charm<br/>
them, it is just a lot of fun. My philosophy is that<br/>
enchanters shine in a group in dungeons (speakning<br/>
from my wizard experience grouping with enchanters on<br/>
dungeon crawls). My goal is to try to stay in dungeons<br/>
from now on :) And contrary to some previous posters,<br/>
finding a group to join has not been that difficult.<br/>
Teaching them to fight &quot;enchanter-style&quot; is a<br/>
different matter though :)<br/>
