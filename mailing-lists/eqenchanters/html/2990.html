<div id="ygrps-yiv-536386144">I think they have a right to be though, don&#39;t you? I was reading all the<br/>
responses to Absor&#39;s post on Enchanters and some of the other classes and I<br/>
think I am the only one who doesn&#39;t really care that some (ok, near all) the<br/>
SoV mobs have such high MR and many , many are unmezzable.  So what its a<br/>
few zones, there are so many other places to go you cant complain about a<br/>
handful of zones that we cant mez in.  Granted I am only 54 but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
really bother me.  I also got a kick out of how many people were bitching<br/>
about wanting new Illusions.  Yeah, I think some of the reasons they give<br/>
for not giving us new Illusions are pretty much crap and wish they would<br/>
just be honest.  But I could really give a poo if we don&#39;t get anymore.  Not<br/>
unless they don&#39;t have some sort of use to them (faction, stat +&#39;s that are<br/>
worth the time/manna it takes to cast).<br/>
