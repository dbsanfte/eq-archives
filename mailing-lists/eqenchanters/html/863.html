<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086039973">Well, personally I started making mana rings when my skill was around 27.<br/>
I failed about half the time, it was expensive, but I pretty much broke<br/>
even with the rings that I did make.  Either way, you could probably make a<br/>
mana ring NOW, but expect a few failures before you have one in your hands.</div>
