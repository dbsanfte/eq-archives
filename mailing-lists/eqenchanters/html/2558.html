&gt; &gt; Heh, i disagree... unrest could be handled by 12-18 players  who are<br/>
&gt; &gt; working<br/>
&gt; &gt; together, all in the mid 20&#39;s (except possibly the ghost room). The key <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; to know when you are gonna aggro other rooms, and split the spawns <br/>
&gt;amongst<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt;	Hmm, you want a druid in wolf form pulling.  In wolf form, NOTHING<br/>
&gt;is agro on you.  You can look around completely safe.  Plus you will NEED<br/>
&gt;harmony if you are going to pull anything in there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	10 to 20 is yard trash..<br/>
&gt;	20 to 25 grouped first floor<br/>
&gt;	24 to 30 second floor<br/>
&gt;	30 to 35 is basement and second floor<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Those are rough guidelines.  But a cleric and druid makes life MUCH<br/>
&gt;easier.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>heh, you like living don&#39;t ya?<br/>
for me, 10-14 was YT<br/>
15-18 first floor<br/>
19-23 second floor<br/>
and at 23 i was grouped in the pit/bloodpool area.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;	I&#39;ve taken 2 of my characters to 30 there.. a druid and paladin.<br/>
&gt;For the level&#39;s, unrest has some of the best loot and exp. in the game.  If<br/>
&gt;your below 30, don&#39;t even think about going to the basement or tower room,<br/>
&gt;one hag will take you out fast if your aren&#39;t well prepared for her.  Hags<br/>
&gt;are wizard, they don&#39;t have a lot of HP, but they are way dangerous to<br/>
&gt;fight.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just keep stunning them. Hags don&#39;t have very high MR it seems, at 23 i was <br/>
able to semi-reliably stun them (cleric stuns). They go down quick. group i <br/>
had for the pit was 25 enchanter, 27 warrior, 27 monk, 26 bard, 23 cleric.<br/>
<br/>
  Most rooms don&#39;t pull other rooms, the exceptions are, the bar room<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;will pull the tower and the other way around.  LOL, you can see the feet of<br/>
&gt;people walking around when your in the bar room.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yeah, but the roamers right outside certain rooms will trigger other rooms. <br/>
Distinction withhout difference.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; all 4 of the major loot spawns on the second floor at once, but two <br/>
&gt;could<br/>
&gt; &gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; held at any given time. holding the pit/bloodpool would be very easy as<br/>
&gt; &gt; well, i have not quite gotten into the ghost room but i suspect it could<br/>
&gt; &gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; done by people in that level range.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;	[ET1 TURNER]<br/>
&gt;	It is rare to see anyone under 30 in the ghost room, very rare.  If<br/>
&gt;your not at lease upper 20&#39;s, be prepared to die LOTS if you try to go into<br/>
&gt;the basement.  If it is you first time in unrest, take a high level friend<br/>
&gt;who knows the dungeon.  Trains are VERY common.  If you know where to play<br/>
&gt;(back wall, gazebo, etc) life can be much safer.  Make sure person who goes<br/>
&gt;in with you can trust.  ONE stupid person can wipe whole parties out.  BTW,<br/>
&gt;NO area effect spells.  I once watch a bard do an area effect song, he <br/>
&gt;lived<br/>
&gt;about 20 seconds, party 25 seconds, the zone was completely wiped out in<br/>
&gt;about 1 minute.  An area affect spell can pull 2nd floor as well as the<br/>
&gt;basement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as long as the group knows what they are doing (i.e. no AE unless you are <br/>
damn sure you are safe) unrest is fairly safe and train free. problem comes <br/>
when there is the other stupid people around. thats why it&#39;s great at late <br/>
night. few idiots=few trains.<br/>
