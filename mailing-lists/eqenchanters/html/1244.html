<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141851067">I started working with electrum and malachite immediately after jade (38<br/>
skill). I am now at 53 and still have not received a &#39;trivial&#39; message on<br/>
them. I succeed better than half the time and my skill is skyrocketing. Hope<br/>
your luck with it will be as good as mine has been.<br/>

&gt; just a quick question, I was oninions or stats (if anyone has kept track<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; tested it)  ,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I am at 40 jewelcraft, and want to train higher (only so I dont fail so<br/>
&gt; much on Jade...) will it be cheaper to train with the next stone (pearl I<br/>
&gt; think) and silver at 6 plat or so per attemptor with electrum and<br/>
&gt; malachite<br/>
&gt; (or whatever the cheapest stone is) withc would run about 2plat 5 gold per<br/>
&gt; attempt I guess what I am asking when it comes down to it...will failures<br/>
&gt; with a stone that is out of my league raise my skill? and how far outta my<br/>
&gt; league is that first gem and electrum.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; on a side note...anyone have  a list or know a site that has the points at<br/>
&gt; which all the blacksmithing items become trivial?<br/>
