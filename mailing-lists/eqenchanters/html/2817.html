<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184557823">I asked myself a question last night that I hope all of you will reply to<br/>
when I ask it of you.<br/>
<br/>
Why did you choose the name of your character? What does it mean to you?<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so that is 2 questions, shoot me. =)<br/>
<br/>
This thought entered my mind as I sat last night trying to come up with a<br/>
name for my gnome enchanter. I do not like the name generator that Verant so<br/>
kindly provides. Answering this question(s) became the real challenge and<br/>
gave my pixels a minor RP perspective that is truly lacking in this game. I<br/>
love the game, but the war for XP dominates the minds of 98.9% (&lt;~ note the<br/>
pun?) of those that subscribe.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what follows is a breakdown of why I chose the names I did. I am<br/>
intrigued to see the results if all of you did the same.<br/>
<br/>
Personal history: I have been playing RPs since 73, and picked up WhiteWolf<br/>
as the dominant favorite since 92.<br/>
<br/>
Arakine Uktena, Woodelf Druid:<br/>
Arakine-<br/>
From the movie Dune. Arakis, desert planet. Paul says at one point &quot;We shall<br/>
squeeze and squeeze until no Harkonin breathes Arakine air.&quot;.  The planet<br/>
itself is a desert filled with danger, yet has the potential to become a<br/>
lush garden paradise.<br/>
Uktena-<br/>
American Indian tribe, and a tribe of Werewolves from WhiteWolf&#39;s &quot;Werewolf:<br/>
the Apocalypse!&quot;. Violent, bloody bastards that guard the spiritual foci and<br/>
are the closest to the Spirits.<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Uthanatos, Gnome Enchanter:<br/>
No last name yet, but I will have a while before I need to worry about it.<br/>
;-)<br/>
From WhiteWolf&#39;s &quot;Mage: the Ascension&quot;, Euthantos.  A Tradition of mages<br/>
that believe death should come to all. They are to help others to meet Death<br/>
when they try to avoid it and have nothing left to give, or to preserve Life<br/>
when their existence still has something to contribute to those around them.<br/>
Also called Death Mages.<br/>
<br/>
This may apply to Necromancers, but to me the Enchanter class is the true<br/>
embodiment of the Euthanatos. They can ultimately control the outcome of<br/>
almost any battle so that the &quot;Life&quot; of the party is preserved (by being<br/>
competent) or they can hasten the grip of Death upon his fellows (by being<br/>
inept).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, there you have it. One step closer into the mind of Me. Reply if you<br/>
wish, I for one would enjoy reading it.<br/>
