<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000099660">Two things are taken into consideration when a critter is trying to resist<br/>
your charm spell. The first is magic resist, and Tashan/Tashani/Tashania<br/>
help tremendously there. The second thing that will influence their chance<br/>
to resist is your charisma. If you are going to be serious about being an<br/>
enchanter and using our charm/crowd control tools, you need to boost your<br/>
charisma as high as you can.<br/>
<br/>
The reason that both of these can also increase the duration of a charm is<br/>
because charm has no set length. A critter gets a chance to resist every few<br/>
seconds. Every successive try is given a little better chance to succeed,<br/>
but the tashan spell and your charisma are still used in the calculation.<br/>
<br/>
Make sense?<br/>

&gt; Im about to mess around with charm. Im almost level 12 :) I played a<br/>
&gt; wizard<br/>
&gt; to level 34 and got bored of blast... blast again.. what next to do<br/>
&gt; maybe..<br/>
&gt; hmm I know blast!!!! hehehee Well as I was saying I noticed at level 12 my<br/>
&gt; root for my wizard got resisted allot! At level 12 can I charm anything to<br/>
&gt; make it worth it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also I have no EXP with useing a charm spell. Other then you know your pet<br/>
&gt; is going to want to kill you soon enough.. hehehehehe Ant insight on what<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; do, and how I will be effected?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S. I am told that Tashan can help not only to stop your char from<br/>
&gt; getting<br/>
&gt; resisted but it also lenghens the time you hold the charm? Is this Bull to<br/>
&gt; put it lightly :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for puting up with my newbe questions :) and all the responce from<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; last posting. You seem like a frendly bunch :)<br/>
