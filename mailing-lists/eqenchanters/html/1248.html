<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040944522">agreed. dont go somewhere where you will lose your body and cant retrieve<br/>
it. if you lose your body from a bug, report it. when you get new armor,<br/>
dont go selling your old stuff, keep it just in case. then go get it again.<br/>
this new anti-camp idea is just what the game needed. it will keep items<br/>
RARE the way they should be, and it&#39;ll make the game back to the way it was<br/>
when it started, ie mystique and awe at getting a new item, instead of<br/>
saying &quot;oh i can just go buy it from some character&quot;.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m sorry, but I *totally* disagree with you.  Something HAS to be done<br/>
&gt;about the farming that goes on.  Too many guilds and assholes sit around<br/>
&gt;camping GREEN MOBs so that they can get yet another item to sell at<br/>
&gt;exorbitant prices.  In my opinion, the new code is EXCELLENT and just what<br/>
&gt;is needed.  Why do you have to get that 2nd item &quot;just in case?&quot;  Go get it<br/>
&gt;again or buy it when you NEED it, not &quot;just in case.&quot;  There are too many<br/>
&gt;campers for &quot;just in case&quot; scenarios.  I say that the new patch is exactly<br/>
&gt;what is needed.<br/>
