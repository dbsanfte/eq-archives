<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156973856">I hate to tell you this, but while most of the people here have good<br/>
points, they simply do not apply to the Brell Server.  Brell is a mixture of<br/>
Fennin refugees who got fed up after the paladin massacre, a few from other<br/>
servers looking for a more stable economy after the pottery nerf, and<br/>
finally, the most stupid group of should have been ogres in all of<br/>
everquest.  I do not know why, but for some reason, every 12 yr. old with a<br/>
55 IQ is naturally attracted to Brell.  And, un fortunately, all of the<br/>
first 2 groups are the high levels on our server.  My tale of woe, I fought<br/>
and clawed my enchanter from the first days of the server up the level 15,<br/>
mostly in groups.  It took me a week to climb him from 15 to 16, mostly<br/>
around the West Commonlands.  I made 17 for 30 seconds in the 3rd floor of<br/>
befallen in a small group, when a group member attacked a green and sent it<br/>
running.  We all died, and I discovered that you cannot lose more than one<br/>
full level of experience in less than 24 hours.  I spent the next 6 months<br/>
disgustedly trying to reclaim what I had lost ( I did spend 2 weeks here, 3<br/>
weeks there trying new characters ).  I tried Unrest, but I could not find a<br/>
group that could follow orders.  I had a group in the West Commonlands made<br/>
of 2 druids, 2 other enchanters, and a mage.  I would buff the mage pet, as<br/>
no one else in the group would, and then Mesmerization the Dervish Camp, and<br/>
charm a derv to fight the others.  Then I would Debuff as nessicary, mainly<br/>
on the thugs.  I watched the other group members as they chain casted choke,<br/>
and the mage cut lose with AoE spells.  Then they had the gall to yell at me<br/>
for not nuking, not meleeing, wanted me to stop charming, because it<br/>
confused them, and finally to stop wasting mana on mes.  This coming from<br/>
people, two of whom were enchanters.  I finally ran to Everfrost, and soloed<br/>
the odd orc shaman or orc mountaineer, with massive downtime after each<br/>
kill, getting to just below 17 again.  Then I made for a guild event in<br/>
Freeport, dying 3 times to one spell each time in Kithkor.  I lost close to<br/>
a full bubble of exp. each time.  <br/>
	That night, I created a druid.  I do not believe you will see me in<br/>
enchanter garb in Brell again.  My suggestion to you is the same, save<br/>
yourself the trouble... you cannot get a steady group on Brell... for some<br/>
reason it just doesn&#39;t happen.  Your guildmates will not be the right level<br/>
to group with you, and the pickup groups on Brell are beyond useless.  Brell<br/>
is a solo server, unless you are in tight with one of the first two groups I<br/>
mentioned.  Might as well get a soloable class.<br/>
