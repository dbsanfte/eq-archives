<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614846315">I have a question for you all...<br/>
As a gnome chanter, will it be worth while to become a smith? Do gnomes even<br/>
have (or is it planned) culrural armor coming out in another patch? I would<br/>
be very willing to start smithing if my chanter could wear chain.<br/>
I guess my next question would be how much plat does it take to get up to<br/>
Master Smith? To 200 form 100?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
