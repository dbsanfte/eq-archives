<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210656974">I have a question about Gypsy Medallion : AC 2, +9 cha, +10 disease.<br/>
Supposedly it&#39;s off Korvick the Cursed in North Karana. Anybody have further<br/>
details - where does he spawn, placeholder, is he rare spawn ?, is it rare drop ?, <br/>
or any other suggestions. I&#39;m planning to wear a plat cat&#39;s eye necklace when<br/>
I can make plat jewellry, but that&#39;s only +9 cha. Seems like Gypsy Medallion is<br/>
the very best neck item for enchanters. True ?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently wearing a Split Paw Tooth Necklace AC 2, +5 cha, +5 poison.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
