<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016654450">This is a great list!  Thanks for compiling it for us.<br/>
<br/>
You are not maxed for your level. Trade skills do not max out by level.<br/>
 You can raise it as high as you can afford to practice with the tools<br/>
of the trade.<br/>
<br/>
For most trades there is som eorder in which you should do things, as<br/>
your skill will develop most cost effectively in this manner.  For<br/>
jewel craft you can get up to 2 skill points with each stone (with<br/>
silver), if you do them in order of cheapest to most expensive.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t note the whole list, as I started at skill of 21.  FOr skill<br/>
points 31 and 32, use carnelian, for points 33 and 34, use rose quartz,<br/>
for 35 and 36 use Amber, etc.  up to Black Pearl.  Then you should be<br/>
able to start over with electrum.  I haven&#39;t gotten that far yet, so I<br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
If you try to use a stone below your level, it tells you that that<br/>
stone is too trivial for you.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I have been keeping track of different<br/>
&gt; combinations of jewels and this<br/>
&gt; is my list thus far in response to The Wanderer&#39;s<br/>
&gt; post.<br/>
&gt; All of the below were made with Enchanted Bar&#39;s of<br/>
&gt; silver.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Malachite     =       <br/>
&gt;  Silver Malachite Ring<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Labis Lazuli =        <br/>
&gt; Silver Labis Lazuli<br/>
&gt; Ring<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Turquoise     =       <br/>
&gt;  Silver Turquois<br/>
&gt; Bracelet<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Hematite      =       <br/>
&gt;  Silver Hematite Ring<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Cat&#39;s Eye Agate = <br/>
&gt; Silver Cat&#39;s Eye Necklace<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Bloodstone   =        <br/>
&gt; Silver Bloodstone<br/>
&gt; Earring<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Onyx             =    <br/>
&gt;      Silver Onyx<br/>
&gt; Bracelet<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Jasper          =     <br/>
&gt;     Silver Jasper Ring<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Carnelian      =      <br/>
&gt;   Silver Carnelian<br/>
&gt; Wedding Ring<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Star Rose Quartz =<br/>
&gt; Silver Rose Engagement Ring<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Amber          =      <br/>
&gt;    Silver Amber Ring<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Notice even though I used enchanted siver for all of<br/>
&gt; the above no magical<br/>
&gt; jewelry was produced.  Apparently a more expensive<br/>
&gt; type of metal must be<br/>
&gt; used to get magic jewelry out of the above stones.<br/>
&gt; Below is a short list of the magic jewelry that I<br/>
&gt; have created using<br/>
&gt; enchanted silver.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Jade           = Jaded<br/>
&gt; Silver Ring,<br/>
&gt; Effect: MANA +5<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Pearl           =<br/>
&gt; Silvered Pearl Ring,<br/>
&gt; Effect: VS POISON +4<br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Topaz         = Topaz<br/>
&gt; Silver Necklace,<br/>
&gt; Effect: VS DISEASE +4<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also I was wondering why there are four slots in the<br/>
&gt; jewelry kit.  So I<br/>
&gt; briefly tried a couple attempts using multiple<br/>
&gt; stones.  Since both attempts<br/>
&gt; were unsuccesful and this type of experimenting is<br/>
&gt; expensive I discontinued<br/>
&gt; this experiment until later.  These are the failed<br/>
&gt; attempts:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Malachite + 1 Lapis<br/>
&gt; Lazuli = &quot;These<br/>
&gt; combinations and quantities  of items fail to<br/>
&gt; combine to produce anything.&quot;<br/>
&gt; 1 Bar of Silver + 1 Lapis Lazuli + 1 Turquoise =<br/>
&gt; &quot;These combinations and<br/>
&gt; quantities of items fail to combine to produce<br/>
&gt; anything.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If anyone can add to this list, please feel free.<br/>
&gt; Also, if anyone can tell me how the skill cap is<br/>
&gt; calculated for jewelcraft I<br/>
&gt; would like to know, I have a level 14 Enchanter who<br/>
&gt; has a 30 in jewelcraft.<br/>
&gt; After hitting 30 my skill has not risen even after<br/>
&gt; numerous attempts to<br/>
&gt; raise it.  Am I maxed for my level?<br/>
