&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone noticed a nerfing of our pets in the past few days? Last<br/>
&gt; night on<br/>
&gt; wisp isle (where I used to hang out alot to get the money for my 12th<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; spells) my pet was dying before I could finish casting my opening<br/>
&gt; spells.<br/>
&gt; This used to happen only rarely, but last night I was only able to keep<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; pet 2 times out of 11. After looking at the log, it appears that the<br/>
&gt; pets<br/>
&gt; had far fewer hp than normal. I understand that sometimes you just get a<br/>
&gt; weak pet, but with so many consecutively? BTW, I had gotten killed in a<br/>
&gt; Kerra spider snafu and had lost 12th level, so the pet I was using was<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; 8th level one that I was very familiar with, and had been using to<br/>
&gt; harvest<br/>
&gt; wisps earlier.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which brings me to my 2nd question. Does anyone know how the 12th level<br/>
&gt; pet<br/>
&gt; spell works? What I mean is, it doesn&#39;t appear to create a randomly<br/>
&gt; strong<br/>
&gt; pet like the 8th level spell does. The first 4 pets I cast conned green<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; me. The next few conned blue to me. I had heard that you could get a pet<br/>
&gt; that cons white to you at 12th level, but I didn&#39;t see one last night.<br/>
&gt; As a<br/>
&gt; matter of fact, the level 8 pets that I had to use after losing my level<br/>
&gt; seemed to do better than my level 12 pets. My conjuration is in the low<br/>
&gt; 50&#39;s, so it&#39;s not maxed, but it&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. Anyone else<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; any similar experiences?<br/>
