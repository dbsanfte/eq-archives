You really shouldn&#39;t bother with pearl. When Jade is trivial switch to<br/>
electrum jewerly at the lowest priced stone for skill raises. I got to 36 on<br/>
jade/silver and am now stuck till I can get the electrum spell and others.<br/>
Giving me time to save up money though. However in EQq as in the real world<br/>
it takes money to make money and those that had the hundreds of plat to plow<br/>
into the skill BEFORE the patch are the only ones who are going to make a<br/>
big killling at the skill. The price is and continues to drop till it will<br/>
be cost ofr materials plus some minor nominal amount. <br/>

&gt;It&#39;s awfully quiet out there today....you must have all had a good weekend,<br/>
&gt;like I did....raised my jeweling skill from 22 to 38 over the past<br/>
&gt;week....any other success stories?  Is that a normal rate?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Working with jade and pearl now....the pearl rings are a hard sell...even<br/>
&gt;at 12pp each..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i noticed a lot of jewelers selling their wares for a lower cost then<br/>
&gt;mine...seems like I&#39;m getting cut....I&#39;ve been selling for about twice the<br/>
&gt;cost of materials...seems like a fair rule for prices (considering all the<br/>
&gt;factors and costs involved in getting skill high enough to even work with<br/>
&gt;the better stones)....but I saw a few people selling jade rings for<br/>
&gt;6pp???!!!!   Ouch!  10pp is what I&#39;ve been selling them for.....and until<br/>
&gt;someone auctions a lower price, I had no problem getting that price.   It<br/>
&gt;pains me greatly to see it happen...so I politely ask the vendors to raise<br/>
&gt;the selling price a little....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any thoughts?<br/>
