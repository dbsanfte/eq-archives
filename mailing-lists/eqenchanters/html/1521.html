&gt; I wish that price-lists and standardized pricing really worked, but no<br/>
&gt; matter how hard we try, it doesn&#39;t have much chance of succeeding.<br/>
&gt; Why?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Enchanter Jerks - For whatever reason, there are those who insist<br/>
&gt; on ruining jewelcraft for the rest of us by charging little or nothing<br/>
&gt; for their wares or by undercutting us at every turn. These false<br/>
&gt; enchanters are just interested in earning a quick buck, not in jewelry<br/>
&gt; as a long-term and useful skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Market Flooding - Even on Prexus (a fairly new server) the silver<br/>
&gt; market is already totally flooded.  People don&#39;t know or don&#39;t care<br/>
&gt; about the money you sink into the skill, they have seen on other<br/>
&gt; servers or on the current servers that the prices are low to the<br/>
&gt; ground and refuse to pay a reasonable amount for silver.  If we try to<br/>
&gt; save the market, it will have to be for electrum or higher.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) Non-Enchanter Items - It&#39;s even more frustrating to be undercut by<br/>
&gt; a non-enchanter selling a similar loot item for no money.   They paid<br/>
&gt; nothing to get it and can undercut us any day of the week.  Given the<br/>
&gt; option of paying 7-8 plat for an enchanter-made intelligence ring or<br/>
&gt; 5-6 plat for a similar loot item with an extra armor class bonus, who<br/>
&gt; will choose the former? (example:  +3 charisma necklace - a couple<br/>
&gt; plat to make if no failures versus a doll that does the same thing - 7<br/>
&gt; gold to buy or free to loot).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4) We can&#39;t make what they want - True, some jewelry (int, str, mana,<br/>
&gt; etc) sells decently.  But, so many more want mana earrings or<br/>
&gt; intelligence bracers or whatever that will never be an option for us.<br/>
&gt; (&quot;What earrings do you have?&quot; &quot;Only Stamina ones&quot; &quot;Oh, sorry, I need<br/>
&gt; _____ ones&quot;).  Then, they go off in search of the loot item that will<br/>
&gt; give them what they need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does this mean we shouldn&#39;t try?  Of course not, but don&#39;t expect a<br/>
&gt; miracle because we set the price for jade mana rings at say 10 pp per<br/>
&gt; ring throughout the servers.  We need to educate people ... maybe a<br/>
&gt; seminar or something where we all get together and sell our wares at<br/>
&gt; the standard price and try to let the populace know why we sell them<br/>
&gt; for that much and how the +2s and such all add up to help them out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not interested in making a whole lot of money with jewelcraft<br/>
&gt; (that&#39;s what my brewing skill is for), but I do want to make enough<br/>
&gt; money to be able to raise my skill.  For now, I mainly sell back<br/>
&gt; unenchanted stuff to vendors or sell/trade for gems with my<br/>
&gt; guildmembers to get money for my skill until I get to electrum.  Then,<br/>
&gt; perhaps the market will be more willing to buy my stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those of you who can easily sell items for what they are worth ...<br/>
&gt; perhaps you can give a seminar to those of us who keep finding<br/>
&gt; ourselves with unsellable product and dozens of tells from people who<br/>
&gt; find out the price we charge and either say they don&#39;t have enough<br/>
&gt; money or run away from us laughing to their nearest loot monster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We can save electrum if we start now.  Don&#39;t be discouraged, we just<br/>
&gt; need to teach people the worth of our products and come up with a<br/>
&gt; valid reason for them to buy at our prices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening<br/>
