<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289877594"><br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">In response to your question.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Mem Blur is hard to resist and is useful for a fight that went really bad with a non aggro critter.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Like Mez it only works with a coordinated group that wont continue attacking.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Like most spells at the level you get it the thing fizziles too often and costs too much mana. &nbsp;However later on you can easily have that much mana left when you realize the fight will go very bad.</font>
<br>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Use Mem Blur to make the target forget who he was mad at and then the fight might be over as he wanders off and you or your group recover.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Use it the same way to break up trains. &nbsp;Even on aggro or assists it stops them for a second or two and that can give the fleeing people the extra edge to get away. &nbsp;Sometimes if you hit the trailing edge of a train or a slow critter then they just wander off isntead of hearing the cries for assist or seeingthe target in thier aggro range.</font>
<br>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Use Mem Blur to pull a monster off a Tank or anyone else who it has frenzied on and is getting pummeled. &nbsp;Just tell them to stop attacking, Mem Blur and then it will go after whomever hits it next or is naturally high on it&#39;s hate list.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">I have saved several clerics, wizards, tanks, and myself with that use.</font>
