<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320745606">It is my guess that they have traded out total resistance of the spell<br/>
for lower possible damage.  But it appears that this partial damage<br/>
begins at a lower level of resistance than total resistance did before.<br/>
This is just guesstimation from my couple of hours of experience<br/>
with the new patch, tho.<br/>
I haven&#39;t had Chaotic Feedback go below 20 damage yet.<br/>

I was playing yesterday and noticing something pretty bad.<br/>
<br/>
Previously my chaotic feedback would always do 44 damage (when i was lv9).<br/>
Now (lv10) when I was casting it on<br/>
mobs on wisp isle (non-wisp-mobs actually like snakes and spiders) it does<br/>
almost like a random amount of damage.<br/>
<br/>
One time it even did 3! which isn&#39;t a good ratio to 45 mana.<br/>
Another time it did 18 and concequently because of the low damage, the<br/>
spider killed me.  It only had a few pixels of health left too and<br/>
certainly 27 more damage would have killed it.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else noticed this?  Did I miss something along the line of patches?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
