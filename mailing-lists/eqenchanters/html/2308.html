<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828615463">Golden rule of being an enchanter in PvP:  Never be alone.<br/>
We can effectively dismantle an opponent without ever harming him damage<br/>
wise.  It helps to have a partner with you to deal damage.  In group vs.<br/>
group PvP, nothing tips the balance factor like an enchanter.  You want to<br/>
focus on disabling through Mesmerize, Blind, and Stun (color flux, color<br/>
shift) while the others do damage.<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
Back when I was level 19, I was running from Neriak when an Erudite wizard<br/>
(con&#39;s yellow) is running down the path.  Mesmerize him as he tries to cast<br/>
a spell.  His spell is interrupted, I start to memorize some PvP spells.  A<br/>
Dark Elf wizard was following the Erudite as well, and he comes up and<br/>
blasts the Mezzed Erudite, waking him up.  Crap.  I get my face out of my<br/>
spell book, and get rooted.  (I guess he thought I was going to fight like a<br/>
mob).  Mez - interrupt.  The dark elf wizzie blasts the Erudite again.  Mez<br/>
- interrupt.  Dark elf casts...  Until the Erudite dropped.  Neither of us<br/>
took a bit of damage.  The only spell he got off was root.  And the only<br/>
spell I cast was Mesmerize (although I cast it several times).<br/>
<br/>
Another Example:<br/>
Last night my guildmates and I did a raid into Runneye.  We had a full<br/>
group.  2 Warriors, 1 Cleric, 1 Necro, 1 Wizzie, 1 Enchanter (me).  Level<br/>
24-29 all of us.  We gated into North Karana and saw a massively decked out<br/>
Barbarian shaman.  Tashan.  Whril til you hurl.  By the way WTYH is<br/>
wonderful in PvP.  The players will actually spin around.  I see my skin<br/>
combust and a human wizzie is nuking me.  Quick Enthrall shuts him up.  We<br/>
finish the shaman and the cleric loots, gaining a nice magic item and over<br/>
30 plat in cash.  The wizzie that had attacked me runs away.  After a<br/>
productive night of gaining XP (but we didn&#39;t get the Blackened Iron<br/>
Broadsword) we had to leave Runneye and ran into another full party of<br/>
Lights.  Area effect Mesmerization.  Then we picked them off one by one.<br/>
(Well we got two of them, the rest ran.  Then a VERY red wizard killed our<br/>
level 29 wizard, but was out of the range of any of the rest of us.  Evac<br/>
called for and those of us with Gate, gated.  The warriors made it back to<br/>
South karana with no troubles.  But in these battles, I just do what I<br/>
normally do when hunting mobs.  Disable them.  Keep them from hurting my<br/>
group and my group will finish them off one by one.<br/>
