<div id="ygrps-yiv-94423517">Wow, interesting point.  I on the other hand use Enthrall.  It not only wipes<br/>
the hate list but also stuns the MOB in it&#39;s tracks and interrupts casting.  I<br/>
use this daily and it has saved myself, and my groups cleric countless times.<br/>
Sort of a Swiss Army Knife of a spell. I feel that this is the single most<br/>
important spell in my lineup.  Here&#39;s my Usual lineup:  Invis (for breaking<br/>
charm),Rune III, Tashani, Tepid Deeds, Insipid Weakness, Enthrall, Beguile, and<br/>
Clarity.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any input on the use of Enthrall?<br/>

&gt; Memory Blur is amazing. I too keep it on hand at all times, Ive even been<br/>
&gt; able to memblur a sand giant while it was hitting and watched him forget who<br/>
&gt; I was and start waltzing the other direction... whew.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I use it all the time while invising to places that see thru invis, running<br/>
&gt; thru lower guk, urd shaman sees me breaks invis and starts beating on me.<br/>
&gt; Mes...Memblur, memblur again, continue on way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Memblur does not always work %100. It works the same way as the monk feign I<br/>
&gt; believe. 35 mobs and under works all the time, above that has some chance of<br/>
&gt; resistability. Ive thought about replacing it with reocc amnesia, but the<br/>
&gt; recast on that is horrendous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Remember that these spells are aggro spells if they are resisted, so if you<br/>
&gt; ae mindwipe a group, dont think they wont come after you. We had an<br/>
&gt; enchanter try to attempt this in Hateplane, only to find he was beat to a<br/>
&gt; pulp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Memblur also saves the enchanter, when tashania/tepid deeds at the beginning<br/>
&gt; mobs get really angry and unless you have an incredible taunter theyll come<br/>
&gt; for you. Memblur and they will go back to the tank. Also while fighting<br/>
&gt; multiples I always mes/tashania/tepid deeds, then cast memblur a few times<br/>
&gt; on the mob and hell usually never come after you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even if you keep a mob mes&#39;d for a long time cause the battle has gone a<br/>
&gt; long time, youll be up on his &quot;to kill&quot; list, so make sure mem blur at least<br/>
&gt; once after a warrior hits it to break mes. This is mandatory in places like<br/>
&gt; Hateplane and Fearplane, and helps a lot in lower guk as well.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Im looking into that stun breaking mes thing, I did a test and it seemed<br/>
&gt; like it didnt break it, but i could swear Ive broken it before with stuns in<br/>
&gt; L Guk.<br/>
&gt; Ill keep tryin.<br/>
