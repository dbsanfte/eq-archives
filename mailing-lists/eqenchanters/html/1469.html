<div id="ygrps-yiv-380447499">Id love to go test this out, but guess what, after the hardware &quot;maintenence&quot; <br/>
this morning, the 10 minutes I was able to connect i had worse packet loss <br/>
and promptly went linkdead.  Guess what, I cant connect to the login server <br/>
now.  Big surprise.  maybe if we have 3 more of these they can finish <br/>
unpluging their routers so nothing works at all.  GAH!<br/>
