<div id="ygrps-yiv-35903288">I&#39;m going to reply to both of you.<br/>
<br/>
My enchanter has long since maxed his jewelcraft<br/>
skill.  I put the maximum practices in before<br/>
starting, 21 points.  As with all trade skills, afdter<br/>
you reach skill 21 you can never again train at your<br/>
guildmaster.  Training can come through experience in<br/>
the field.  This means failures, and lots of them. <br/>
Successes count for skill too, but they don&#39;t the<br/>
wallet so I am not too worried about those.<br/>
<br/>
I want to give you an idea of what the trade is going<br/>
to cost you to master.  You can get to trivial on<br/>
silver items for less than 200p in practice (read that<br/>
as money lost due to failures).  You will get up to<br/>
100 skill at about 1000p.  Now start the big numbers. <br/>
Getting up to the point that the first gold item<br/>
becomes trivial could cost you another 1000p or even<br/>
2000p in failures.   Getting from 150 to 195 is going<br/>
to cost you in the tens of thousands.  my last few<br/>
points, from 195 to 200, cost easily 5,000p in<br/>
failures each, maybe more.<br/>
<br/>
Scary proposition, eh?  Just remmeber that you will be<br/>
making money along the way.  You can&#39;t do jewlecraft<br/>
as a hobby. If you are going to do it, you need to<br/>
hawk your wares.  Else you will not be able to afford<br/>
to practice.<br/>
<br/>
As to the previous responder, don&#39;t waste too many<br/>
practices on languages, enchanters don&#39;t need them. <br/>
You can take language classes from other players to<br/>
learn languages.<br/>
