<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340314964">Rune 4 is lame it should be rune 5 on the robes.....<br/>
anyways yeah.... on a vox/naggy raid u should be doing<br/>
the following on vox mana seive all to hell trust me<br/>
it does work we do it with the clerics on the PoH and<br/>
the clerics we fight almost never ever get a heal off<br/>
and we dont even stun them anymore just have us ToT<br/>
and Mana Seive them.... for naggy you need to target<br/>
him and /assist of naggy then it will target who he is<br/>
attacking then just chain cast rune 3 (yes rune 3<br/>
cause 4 is expensive) and your raid should go fine as<br/>
long as everyone else knows what they are doing<br/>
