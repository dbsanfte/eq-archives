<b>Subject:</b> Enchanters and the Charisma vs Int Battle <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-141970538">I am Jouleblu Diamond of the sever Cazic-Thule, 52 Enchantress of <br/>
high elf decent.  I have spent the last 2 days in the Plane of Hate <br/>
working on obtaing my last few items of Isiduous armor, bane of all <br/>
armor to obtain.  I would rather it be on Lord Nagafen or deep in the <br/>
bowels of Sebelis or Chardok than this plane.  After clearing the SW <br/>
as most of you know, clerics get sleepy and most dont have the energy <br/>
for more, much less clearing out Maesto/INNY or even more revs, <br/>
sigh.  But such is our quest for armor it seems.<br/>
<br/>
I am fairly flexible with the abitlity to be 218 int or 248 charisma <br/>
and can adjust these depending on perceived need.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday in PoH I was 248 charisma and all loaded for bear as I <br/>
often am on a new planes trip.  Today I was 200 int and only 187 <br/>
charisma.  And, to my surprise I was equally able to mez the mobs and <br/>
critters.  I did only attempt charms on 4 occassions more or less <br/>
each day and noticed no perceptable differnce.<br/>
<br/>
I am slowly arriving at the conclusion that charisma is totally or at <br/>
least in part a waste.  I am most sad about this because I have <br/>
enormous pp invested in the finest of cha gear.  But alas, the <br/>
conclusion is not new; I have suspected this for some time now, but <br/>
did not want to admit it to myself.<br/>
<br/>
I know much has been written on this matter but from the perspective <br/>
of this enchanter, given one day at 248 cha and one day at 187, dont <br/>
break your neck getting the cha.  Get the good solid int, mana items, <br/>
then AC.  I regret to report this for I feel our class has been <br/>
grossly misled by the gods and our wasted armor for some time now<br/>
<br/>
Good Gold, is never as good as bad Platinum,<br/>
<br/>
   Words to live by....<br/>

       I am sincerely yours,<br/>
