<div id="ygrps-yiv-743334849">Oh yeah forgot about lava storm.  Group with a druid.  They have snare and<br/>
you can use your fear spell.  You will find that in outdoor zones<br/>
Ranger/Enchanter, Druid/Enchanter, Shadow Knight/Enchanter and to a lesser<br/>
extent Necromancer/Enchanter (because the necro really doesn&#39;t need you) all<br/>
these combinations are great.  My favorite is actually Ranger/Enchanter<br/>
because there is allways a ranger out there looking for a group.  Let the<br/>
Ranger snare and you fear, make sure the Ranger backs out when fear is off<br/>
or your down time will increase quite a bit while he tries to heal himself<br/>
after fights.<br/>

I know all of this is the opposite of what I told you about grouping in<br/>
dungeons to learn, but this is very good exp too.  Not so much at your lvl,<br/>
but after 29 or so when outdoor mobs start having enough HPS to make it<br/>
worth while to use the mana on fearing them.<br/>

At level 14 you might take your group up to lavastorm mountains. Its not as<br/>
heavily hunted and ideal for your level group. You might try sticking your<br/>
head in najena and trying the mobs near the entrance. I agree strongly with<br/>
the previous respondent about getting into dungeons as much as possible.<br/>
Practice your crowd control skills You&#39;ll be glad you did later in life.<br/>
Seeing a dungeon floor littered with  enemy corpses and knowing  you were<br/>
the difference between this outcome and a party wipeout/evac is quite a<br/>
thrill :)<br/>

&gt; Hi all, i&#39;ve not introduced myself... just joined this list last week and<br/>
&gt; as there haven&#39;t been any posts.. well, that&#39;s my reason for not doing it<br/>
&gt; before now :o)<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve only just started playing EQ in the last few weeks, i&#39;m a Gnome<br/>
&gt; Enchantress on The Rathe server.<br/>
&gt; Doing pretty well, I&#39;m lvl 14 now and a large loan from a friend has<br/>
&gt; ensured that I&#39;ve been able to get almost all my spells and lots of decent<br/>
&gt; kit :o)<br/>
&gt; Anyway, so far I&#39;ve played... in North Freeport for the first few lvl&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; Misty Thicket up till 7 or 8, then West Commons up until now, killing<br/>
&gt; Dervs.  I&#39;ve pretty much stopped getting exp from killing them now (in<br/>
&gt; groups of 6 usually), so have been dumped in Oasis... but so far<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; iv&#39;e come across is green or red :o(<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any tips for the best place to be located at this<br/>
&gt; lvl?  Obviously I&#39;d like to get to 16 soon to get breeze but at the rate<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going, I&#39;m either going to not move from low lvl 14, or go down to 13<br/>
&gt; if I get killed any more in oasis :o(<br/>
&gt; Thanks a lot,<br/>
