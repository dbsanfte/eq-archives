1&gt; Is it the skull of Shen&#39;Tra or Jhen&#39;Tra?  Shen&#39;Tra is a high level monk<br/>
quest, Jhen&#39;Tra is still very much a heatedly debated topic and no one<br/>
really knows what it is for.<br/>
<br/>
2&gt; Words are research items for a ANOTHER magi class.  We use pages for<br/>
research.  I believe that Wizards use Runes, and I&#39;m not sure who uses<br/>
Words.  Trade with someone that has pages or sell it outright for 3 to 5pp<br/>
to a PC.<br/>
<br/>
3&gt; That rumor is for the Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra, but is totally unconfirmed as I<br/>
have yet to hear of anyone that has actually accomplished this, even though<br/>
everyone claims it to be true.<br/>

    Hey all fellow enchanters,<br/>
        I joind a very powerfull group and went into PAW last night,,,,<br/>
there for a long time, had a great spawn killing pattern,<br/>
    always killing Named shamans, and commanders. GREAT Exp!<br/>
    anyway, i found a few interesting things, and i was wondering if anyone<br/>
knew anything about them? perhaps they are quest items? or something else.<br/>
<br/>
    1) Skull of (damn, i forget his name, i&#39;ll post it when i get<br/>
it...sorry) but i got a skull, and it wont sell, i was not going to sell it,<br/>
thats just how i test it to see if its anything more.<br/>
<br/>
    2) Words of Tyranny:: its a parchement? i think its part of a<br/>
researchable spell, but i cannot read it, since i cannot research yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    3)  thisis not a found item, but something a Mage told me that was in<br/>
our party. he said he heard rumors of being able to mount a certain skull on<br/>
the Totem staff??? can anyone confirm this??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Thanx!!!<br/>
