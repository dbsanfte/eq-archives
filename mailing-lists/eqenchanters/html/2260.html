<div id="ygrps-yiv-136805103">I am an Erudite Enchantress who is NOT agnostic and I have no problems walking about any of the evil cities under the appropriate guise. I also shop or use the bank in them whenever needed. Is there someone or some specific shop that any of you go to which results in the shopkeeps seeing through your illusions?<br/>
