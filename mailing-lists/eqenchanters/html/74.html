 </span></blockquote>            I have been playing this game since beta phase 4 and I have<br/>
found that this game is NOTHING like UO.....in UO there were a very many<br/>
unuseable and WORTHLESS spells and skills......BUT THIS IS NOT<br/>
UO!!!&gt;......and Verant has been VERY good about making sure that EVERYTHING<br/>
in this game is WORTH something!!.....even as a Necromancer....there is a<br/>
spell called Vampyric Embrace.....everyone in beta and still today in<br/>
release thinks that this spell is broken becuase it doesnt work.....but it<br/>
turns out that the spell DOES work its just that you cant wield a weapon<br/>
while your using that spell......so you must cast it and then disarm<br/>
yourself so that you may TOUCH your opponent......so my point is that just<br/>
cuase YOU (not you as in Keith....sorry bro....but YOU as in the populous)<br/>
arent seeing how it is effecting your char doesnt mean that its<br/>
worthless......Verant and the EQ ppl have PROVED time and again that<br/>
EVERYTHING in Norath so far is of SOME use......and is WORTH<br/>
something.....so keep trying and Im sure well get something soon.......on<br/>
the other hand ....it might just be BROKEN.....in which case if you bug it<br/>
enuf it will be fixed.......dont just rant guys.....you have to tell sumone<br/>
when sumthin is wrong.....<br/>
