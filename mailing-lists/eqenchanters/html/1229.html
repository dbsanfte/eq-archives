<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261199859">I&#39;ve read in a lot of places that spellcasters had a hard time at the start<br/>
( up to level 5 lets say ). Well, I have ( or had ) a mage level 12, a necro<br/>
level 9, a necro level 16 and an enchanter level 20, and it didnt seem that<br/>
tough to me. Necros were definitely the easiest to play with a &quot;strong&quot; pet<br/>
at level 1 and since melee and hp matter more at those low levels and you<br/>
can absorb them. But I did pretty good with my enchanter and my mage also.<br/>
At level 4, I could buy all my enchanter spells!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I started a bard last night ( tank class ). Well after 6 hours of<br/>
endless fight, here are the stats:<br/>
I just made Level 5,<br/>
I&#39;ve bought all my songs and my first instrument ( hand drum ),<br/>
I have about 8 plats in the bank,<br/>
I have about half of the cloth armor pieces with one banded torso part (<br/>
whatever those tanks call that ).<br/>
<br/>
So now, I dont think I did that well before... Anyway, here is what really<br/>
surprised me. Remember at our low levels how it&#39;s fight then meditate ( or<br/>
pretend to hehe ), fight then meditate, etc... I fought that for tanks it<br/>
was fight and sit and fight and sit..no no no! I had to sit about 3 to 4<br/>
times because my hp went under a bubble and that&#39;s for the whole 6 hours! I<br/>
died a few times ( one by falling from Kelethim ). The only backdraw on that<br/>
is that I could barely raise my skills to their max in that timeframe.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m not trying to do a race here, but you guys should try a tank<br/>
sometimes, it&#39;s not bad at all ( well yes, warrior is! ). I may create a<br/>
druid also. I&#39;m getting bored of the same spells and characters.<br/>
