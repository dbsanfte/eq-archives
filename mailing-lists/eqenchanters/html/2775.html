<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616194989">As the others have stated the best spot for the warriors to spawn is around the Iksar bandit camp. It is almost straight out from the entrance of the valley to the field of bone. To increase my odds at having a Ton spawn I just pulled everything that I saw to me with Tash and let my pet shred it, I had a Ton in about 2 minutes and about 10 minutes after that I had one with the totem.<br/>
