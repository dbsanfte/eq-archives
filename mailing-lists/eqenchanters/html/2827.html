<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324184767">generally What I do is cast second of the stun series, immediately followed by a<br/>
casting (as soon as it regens) of my Best DD spell.  By the time it hits And the<br/>
spells cycle my stun is ready to go again, and a tepid series never hurts<br/>
either.<br/>

&gt; (lately it&#39;s been Lord/AM/Hand in Lower Guk), which with a good group<br/>
&gt; usually takes an hour (2 spawn cycles),  what am I supposed to do on the<br/>
&gt; singles we&#39;re pulling for the next four hours? Yes I stun them for most of<br/>
&gt; their short lifespan, but that&#39;s so little mana I can fit in a DD and still<br/>
&gt; be back to full mana by the next pull. Besides, evoke is trailing behind my<br/>
&gt; other skills (under 200 at level 44), I need to get work in on it when the<br/>
&gt; situation can handle it. Any spell casters that get pulled must go down hard<br/>
&gt; and ugly with DD&#39;s, after two stuns of course. If spell casting mobs get 2<br/>
&gt; spells off on my group after the initial pull, I consider that I did a poor<br/>
&gt; job on them. Never nuke early, never nuke often. And if you ever do get into<br/>
&gt; a situation where&#39;s there&#39;s 2 enchanters grouped together (rare, but I have<br/>
&gt; had it happen), one can do a little more nuking even. Enchanters are one of<br/>
&gt; the most flexible of the spellcasters, we can buff, debuff, crowd control,<br/>
&gt; and do damage, indirectly and directly. Know the situation and adapt to it.<br/>
&gt; I will add that when I need buff, it&#39;s the damage spell that has it&#39;s slot<br/>
&gt; taken by the buff spell.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I mildly disagree that our DD&#39;s are not usefull in a group. Im not<br/>
&gt; saying<br/>
&gt; &gt; im a nuke happy enchanter, I know what my job is;  buffing, debuffing and<br/>
&gt; &gt; mezzing =) . There is no bigger thrill for me than pulling my party<br/>
&gt; through<br/>
&gt; &gt; an &quot;imposible&quot;  pull with skillfull mezzing and hearing them say &quot;You<br/>
&gt; &gt; ROCK!&quot;. However there are times in a group when your crowd control<br/>
&gt; abilities<br/>
&gt; &gt; are not needed. If  your loaded with mana and a mob is getting low on<br/>
&gt; health<br/>
&gt; &gt; why not toss a nuke in there to hurry things along? Other classes are more<br/>
&gt; &gt; efficient at DD of course but often arent present in my groups, we tend to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be pretty melee oriented.  Use ALL of your abilities and stay flexible =)<br/>
