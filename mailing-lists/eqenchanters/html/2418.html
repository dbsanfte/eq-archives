<div id="ygrps-yiv-903414228">I&#39;m on Fennin, and I HAD these spells as extras, don&#39;t know if I still do or<br/>
not. Lower level centaurs in SK are good for those spells, in my experience<br/>
(they are also good for experience if you can get into a group that knows<br/>
what they are doing).<br/>
 <br/>
EEs should be around 22ish in a group, 24ish solo if not 26.<br/>

Does anyone know the best mobs to look for to get Tasarin&#39;s pages 30 and 312<br/>
for beserker strength and color shift spells.  Since I fail repeatedly at<br/>
making them, and I see no one auctioning these pages, at this rate I will be<br/>
level 30 before I have them.  <br/>
 <br/>
And looking ahead a bit as well, where should I go for the level 24 research<br/>
pages as well.  <br/>
 <br/>
I was level 18 when I found out that Jonah and other Lake Rathe mobs give<br/>
level 16 ones out like candy.  Now those pages (for 16) are all I ever see<br/>
anywhere (I practically throw them away I have so many), but there must be<br/>
other treasure troves like Jonah for level 20 and 24 spells too (I hope). <br/>
 <br/>
My poor (and I mean &#39;broke&#39;) level 21 enchantress has CHA and INT both just<br/>
over 130.  I am working hard on jewelcraft to try to fill in my (bare) ear<br/>
slots, and wrist slots in particular, but she currently sports damask or<br/>
leather or cloth underwear. A second question I have is .. at what level can<br/>
I successfully do Evil Eyes in the gorge (given the above stats, and with a<br/>
magic resist of 57).  <br/>
 <br/>
My druid, with a partner druid, has a lot of trouble with them at level<br/>
25/26 (magic resist at base 25) but since evil eyes are enchanters, I hoped<br/>
we might be more successful at earlier levels? <br/>
 <br/>
 I (my enchanter) often group with a level 21 cleric but I think we might<br/>
need another tank type to help out (unless my pet can take on that role?)<br/>
Evil eyes often seem to have both an animation and a mino pet, and they<br/>
throw blindness, fear, debuffs and charm on us. Can be wild there. Fun but I<br/>
am going steadily backwards with my druid so far.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for any help you can give me. I enjoy this list very much. <br/>
