From the first page of the site on www.flash.net/~wongster, I can get into<br/>
the application form just fine right now.  Tribe is an officer in the guild,<br/>
but I usually deal with Nasir (although I do know Tribe).  Try one more time<br/>
and if you still have trouble with it, I can ask talk to them when I get<br/>
on-line tonight and find out what the story is.<br/>
