<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536725792">I couldn&#39;t agree more!  Right now I am spending many<br/>
days sitting in the king room in Sol B, and for the<br/>
most part all I do is Clarity and Celerity, and a<br/>
shiftless deeds now and then.  If things get hairy, I<br/>
do use mesmerization or Entrance, but heck! I&#39;ve in<br/>
the same time cast 4 clarity&#39;s and two celerity;s...<br/>

&gt; On the topic of specialization, tho it is only<br/>
&gt; recommended that Enchanters<br/>
&gt; specialize in alteration, it is HIGHLY recommended<br/>
&gt; from myself. And Im sure<br/>
&gt; many other high level enchanters would agree with<br/>
&gt; me. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; True, some people say conjuration may be good with<br/>
&gt; mes and all, but honestly<br/>
&gt; that is our cheapest line of spells. If you really<br/>
&gt; want to be a good<br/>
&gt; enchanter specialize in alteration, at higher levels<br/>
&gt; youll be casting so<br/>
&gt; many alteration spells youll be happy for the<br/>
&gt; slightly lower mana cost. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ive had to cast clarity and celerity on over 2<br/>
&gt; parties worth of people, and<br/>
&gt; Its hard to keep that demand up, and when I get<br/>
&gt; swift like wind it will be<br/>
&gt; worse. I try to reserve all my casting to my<br/>
&gt; specialization skill, (slow,<br/>
&gt; and if i need to do dmg i use my dots since they are<br/>
&gt; alteration) In kedge<br/>
&gt; you will learn that the enchanter needs to cast<br/>
&gt; augmentation on EVERYONE,<br/>
&gt; and last week i had 18 ppl to augment. The extra<br/>
&gt; mana you save on 2 personal<br/>
&gt; buffs is at least minorly helpful (cha/agi). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There was a time when I laughed at other casters<br/>
&gt; because everytime they were<br/>
&gt; oom, i still had over 50-60, but since weve been<br/>
&gt; hitting giants, imps,<br/>
&gt; kedge, (and very soon the planes), i have always<br/>
&gt; been the lowest mana<br/>
&gt; because of the buffs (and I always drain my mana on<br/>
&gt; buffing because it is<br/>
&gt; well worth the cost)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So specialize alteration, youll be happy you did<br/>
&gt; when you are able to cast<br/>
&gt; 2400 mana worth of buffs on only 1900.<br/>
