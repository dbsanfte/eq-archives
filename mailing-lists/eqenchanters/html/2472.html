<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqenchanters] A question about the Tashania quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-582522929">The vendors in the librarty are pretty impartial. When<br/>
I ran the quest, I had horrid faction with the guards<br/>
as well, So I stripped and gave it a whirl.  I invised<br/>
all the way to the library, then gave Mar his money<br/>
and stuff, and had no trouble. I gated out right from<br/>
there.<br/>

&gt; spell, but one part<br/>
&gt; worries me. I am currently KOS to most faction<br/>
&gt; groups in Neriak (even with<br/>
&gt; Illusion: Dark Elf and Benevolence) because of my<br/>
&gt; religion (Erollisi Marr)<br/>
&gt; and a few unfortunate run-ins with the Neriak Guard<br/>
&gt; population. One part of<br/>
&gt; the Tashania quest reqiuires that I see Mizr N&#39;Mar<br/>
&gt; in the Neriak Library to<br/>
&gt; get my glowing coin of Tash converted into a<br/>
&gt; gleaming coin of Tash. Will I<br/>
&gt; be able to do this without dropping invis? Being<br/>
&gt; invis is basically the<br/>
&gt; only way I can roam Neriak unmolested, and I am<br/>
&gt; usure if initiating a trade<br/>
&gt; with an NPC will cause my invisibility to drop. I am<br/>
&gt; pretty sure that would<br/>
&gt; be the case, and being killed by angry NPCs in the<br/>
&gt; Neriak Library really<br/>
&gt; doesnt appeal to me...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would appreciate some advice from anyone that has<br/>
&gt; completed this quest.<br/>
&gt; Am I right to think that initiating a trade with an<br/>
&gt; NPC will make you<br/>
&gt; appear? If so, does anyone know what faction group<br/>
&gt; Mizr and the surrounding<br/>
&gt; NPCs belong to? And is there anyway that I can raise<br/>
&gt; my faction with this<br/>
&gt; group? Any help would be appreciated :)<br/>
