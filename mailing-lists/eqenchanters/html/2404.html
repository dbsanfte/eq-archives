I completely disagree.  Many times I&quot;ve had one or two MoBs enthralled, and<br/>
with the third beating on me I&#39;ll throw a color flux at it... stunning all 3<br/>
targets.  Both of the MoB that were enthralled continue to be enthralled.  I<br/>
generally like to stand in the middle of my enthralled targets with no<br/>
target selected, so that as soon as I get hit I can start casting enthrall<br/>
or stun.  Not to mention it makes it obvious to my tanks that there is no<br/>
threat from the &#39;enchantress area&#39;<br/>
