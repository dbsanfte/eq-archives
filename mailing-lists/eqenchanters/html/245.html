kinda bored and you want to actually EARN sumthin of your own.......you can<br/>
get yoruself 5platinum and go visit Karg Icebear in Everfrost.......he makes<br/>
polar bear cloaks that can be worn by anyone.....they give +10 to cold<br/>
resist and offer a 5ac which is better then the leather cloak.....my Druid<br/>
