<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889459840">Oasis is great for orcs grouped and crocs solo<br/>
So Ro would be good for the derv camps and drybones<br/>
<br/>
West Commons is good.  Are wisps still blue at 12? think they are.  The derv<br/>
camp would be good with a group and you would be helpful for them to control<br/>
bad pulls.  Also with a small group can easily handle full kodiaks.<br/>
<br/>
Beholder would be ok for minos grouped and muddite minors solo<br/>
<br/>
The karanas (west I suppose) should have some bandits and the like<br/>
<br/>
Unrest would be pushing it for death beetles and tormented dead with a<br/>
partner<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll notice I didn&#39;t mention much in the way of dungeons cause I like the<br/>
open spaces.  But befallen would probly be ok and if in a decent group upper<br/>
guk near the exit.<br/>

I was wondering if charmed pets get exp when they kill something. Do they<br/>
get it every time or just if they make the last hit? Any info would be<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am a lvl12 enchanter and am wondering what sort of places I can hunt<br/>
at for the next few lvls. I am currently near No Ro and Oasis, but am<br/>
thinking that there&#39;s got to be an alternative.<br/>

&gt;Jewelry skill will cap at 200 so that no platinum items become trivial.<br/>
&gt;There is no level cap for trade skills. Main skills are capped at<br/>
&gt;(5xlevel)+5, but trade skills do not have this level limitation. Two<br/>
&gt;different meanings of skill caps. Hope this clears up the confusion.<br/>
