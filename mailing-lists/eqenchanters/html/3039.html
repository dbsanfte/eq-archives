 </span></blockquote>I seem to remember that Kurn&#39;s tower was pretty fun at<br/>
that level. Another possibility would include the<br/>
Karanas (Norht at this level I think.) Good place to<br/>
get some cash and easy exp. would be killing wisps at<br/>
Erud&#39;s crossing, esp if you have a magic weapon.<br/>
Previous poster&#39;s points about Unrest are well taken.<br/>
Dungeons are fun if you are a chanter, and good<br/>
practice. Befallen 3rd floor would probably be still<br/>
ok for you as well. Maybe Crushbone in the castle.<br/>
What level is Kerra these days? Upper Guk would be<br/>
great, if you could find a group.<br/>
