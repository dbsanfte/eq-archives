<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129748379">Well, the problem is, we cant document any pattern between those who<br/>
complain they always get resisted and those who dont.  well, except for<br/>
3 level higher reds, who resist all of us.  And yes, much of the<br/>
information on Stratics is crap, as well as EQvault.  Much is also very<br/>
good, but im not going to say there arent undocumented features just<br/>
cause Eqvault says so.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The problem of course being is that neither Stratics or EQVault are in<br/>
any<br/>
way affiliated with Verant.  Neither have any &#39;inside&#39; information that<br/>
guarantees that all information contained therein is accurate.  For<br/>
example,<br/>
I would recommend reading EQVault&#39;s guide to jewelcraft.  It is one of<br/>
the<br/>
remarkably worst pieces of prose I&#39;ve ever had the privelidge to read.<br/>
It<br/>
make Hubbard&#39;s Battlefield Earth look like Ulysses.  ;)  Now, I&#39;m not<br/>
saying<br/>
that charisma necessarily affects resists in any way shape or form, I<br/>
dont<br/>
have any data on the matter (and I&#39;ve been playing eq since the begining<br/>
of<br/>
phase 3).  If some people are experiencing a great deal fewer resists,<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
entirely possible that there&#39;s an undocumented chr effect.<br/>
