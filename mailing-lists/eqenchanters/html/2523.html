<div id="ygrps-yiv-328667361">You didn&#39;t mention what room you were in, I have fought in the warrior and<br/>
raider room there and have never had a problem with color flux/shift pulling<br/>
the guards down. It&#39;s been my habit to walk into there and spread out the<br/>
spawn with enthrall so we were only killing one goblin at a time though.<br/>
