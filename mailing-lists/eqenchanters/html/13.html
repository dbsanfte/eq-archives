<b>Subject:</b> Jewelcrafting and the Enchanters Role in Norath!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455124720">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
        My name is Dymond and I play a DE Enchanter on E&#39;ci.......I just<br/>
recently made 8th lvl and acquired my EVER so desired Enchant Silver<br/>
spell......I have put 15 pnts into jewelcrafting and have an extra 10 or so<br/>
points to put into my other skills to max them out......I have acquired a<br/>
full suit of cloth and intend on taking a couple different chars to Upper<br/>
Guk this weekend as to acquire sum mage specific armor but I am interested<br/>
in a few topics of hot discussion......I have heard alot about the Enchanter<br/>
and what they can do but one thing I notice is the choice of spells we have<br/>
and that most of them are either debuffers or animation controlling<br/>
spells.....in other words spells that control the NPCs actions.......so my<br/>
first question is one of strategy......do you ppl have a certain line of<br/>
spells that you cast first, second,<br/>
third?......soloing?......grouped?......I play a 16th lvl Druid as well and<br/>
his main role in a group is to scout and fetch as we have tracking and a<br/>
good number of buff spells.....so in a group with him Im used to being in<br/>
the thick of it from teh beginning and eventually fading into the melee or<br/>
just being the CALL BOY......back line guy calling orders and<br/>
directions......so my point to this is just what role dus the enchanter play<br/>
aside from controlling the frenzy?......dmg?....or is this more of a silent<br/>
bak line char?.......no realy power, no realy damage......but in large<br/>
groups and dungeoning where there are multiple targets we become the<br/>
MAESTRO!!!&gt;.......and SECOND!!!......as I stated in the beginning I have put<br/>
a good portion of sum starting points into Jewelcrafting and would like ANY<br/>
and all information on this subject......even if you think its CRAP and just<br/>
small stuff that you have found yourself but dusnt relaly make all the<br/>
differnece.....TELL ME!!!&gt;.....these are the small points that make you<br/>
stick out......Id like to have any replies to either of these questions<br/>
either by reply or by posting to this list.......ANY AND ALL INFO<br/>
WANTED!!!!!!<br/>
