<div id="ygrps-yiv-521559785">One thing more thing that as a Dark Elf enchanter that I just found out. If<br/>
you change to a form in your home city that your guards don&#39;t like then you<br/>
ARE KOS on site. Found this out the very hard way. Got my newbie level 4<br/>
illusions, Human and Half-elf.  Human just conned me at dubious. Half-elf<br/>
and I was dead in two swipes. Ouch.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 4) At what level can I go into the evil cities?  My gnome necro can go<br/>
&gt; &gt; into Neriak - can my agnostic enchanter go there in gnome form?  Can I<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; &gt; into Grobb or Oggok in dark elf form, or must I wait for ogre/troll<br/>
form?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As soon as you get illusion - dark elf you can go everywhere in Norrath<br/>
&gt; (except watch that shadowknight guild).  As an agnostic you arent limited<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; religion.<br/>
