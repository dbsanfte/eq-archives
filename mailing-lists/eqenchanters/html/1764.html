<b>Subject:</b> A question about Enchant Silver <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-700102016">Hi everyone-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on the list for the last week or so and have found your<br/>
discussions very valuable as a beginning jeweler.  Last night I made level 8<br/>
and would like to obtain the Enchant Silver spell. It is my understanding the<br/>
spell is located in the Library in Neriak, a place to which I haven&#39;t been.<br/>
<br/>
My question is: as a high-elf enchanter, am I KOS in Neriak? (I&#39;m betting<br/>
probably so...) If so, what strategies did you use to obtain the spell? I have<br/>
not seen anyone in in Greater Faydark selling the spell on the Erollisi Marr<br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
Your comments will be most helpful. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
