<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013705743">Evil eye are a blast, just make sure you have whirl and colour flux up<br/>
(colour shift if you&#39;ve got it).  Mes pet, as someone else stated, quicken<br/>
pet, make sure to have endure magic resist up as well as all other buffs.<br/>
Start off with Tashani, then immediately DD and run into range, Colour<br/>
Flux, (Colour Shirt,) WTYH, DD, repeat until dead.  They die fast.  I did<br/>
one or two at 23, but it wasn&#39;t an easy battle by any means.  I&#39;d image<br/>
they are pretty easy at 24 with the new spells.</div>
