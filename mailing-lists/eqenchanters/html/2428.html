<div id="ygrps-yiv-780922388">Memory Blur is amazing. I too keep it on hand at all times, Ive even been<br/>
able to memblur a sand giant while it was hitting and watched him forget who<br/>
I was and start waltzing the other direction... whew.<br/>
<br/>
I use it all the time while invising to places that see thru invis, running<br/>
thru lower guk, urd shaman sees me breaks invis and starts beating on me.<br/>
Mes...Memblur, memblur again, continue on way.<br/>
<br/>
Memblur does not always work %100. It works the same way as the monk feign I<br/>
believe. 35 mobs and under works all the time, above that has some chance of<br/>
resistability. Ive thought about replacing it with reocc amnesia, but the<br/>
recast on that is horrendous.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that these spells are aggro spells if they are resisted, so if you<br/>
ae mindwipe a group, dont think they wont come after you. We had an<br/>
enchanter try to attempt this in Hateplane, only to find he was beat to a<br/>
pulp.<br/>
<br/>
Memblur also saves the enchanter, when tashania/tepid deeds at the beginning<br/>
mobs get really angry and unless you have an incredible taunter theyll come<br/>
for you. Memblur and they will go back to the tank. Also while fighting<br/>
multiples I always mes/tashania/tepid deeds, then cast memblur a few times<br/>
on the mob and hell usually never come after you.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you keep a mob mes&#39;d for a long time cause the battle has gone a<br/>
long time, youll be up on his &quot;to kill&quot; list, so make sure mem blur at least<br/>
once after a warrior hits it to break mes. This is mandatory in places like<br/>
Hateplane and Fearplane, and helps a lot in lower guk as well.<br/>

Im looking into that stun breaking mes thing, I did a test and it seemed<br/>
like it didnt break it, but i could swear Ive broken it before with stuns in<br/>
L Guk.<br/>
Ill keep tryin.<br/>
