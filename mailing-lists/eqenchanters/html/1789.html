<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782884298">Ahem, actually, if NPC prices are 14 to 15pp you should easily get 10pp.<br/>
While working up my jewelcraft skill I often dealt with comments about the<br/>
cost of the components used in the item I was selling. Granted, the sole<br/>
components used cost a fraction of what the sale price is, yet factoring in<br/>
failures, training to get to that skill level, and your time to get it<br/>
there I think it&#39;s more than fair! I usually bark back, well go work your<br/>
jewelcraft skill up and make it yourself if you dont like my prices. The<br/>
KEY is getting all jewelers on the same page and charging the same or close<br/>
to the same prices. Until that happens, you&#39;ll have to deal with a much<br/>
less margin to reinvest into your trade.<br/>
Try getting with all the jewelers, and get them all on the same page, it&#39;s<br/>
to only help you, them, and the trade of jewelcraft. It does work, you just<br/>
have to keep after it and others to pass the word.<br/>
