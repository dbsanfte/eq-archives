<div id="ygrps-yiv-680570644">my skill level is still at 41......  I&#39;ve moved to electrum some<br/>
time ago....as Jade became trivial and the gems are hard to find (or far to<br/>
travel to) in the Rare category....ie. Jade, Pearl and above<br/>
<br/>
	with about 20 to 25 attempts with Electrum and malachite, I suceeded<br/>
about 3 or 4 times....and not ONCE have I gotten a skill increase.... <br/>
	I&#39;m going back to Pearl and Topaz with SILVER, I suppose....<br/>

<br/>
	I&#39;ve mentioned this in my editorial and I posted as a bug the high<br/>
failure<br/>
	rates when working with combinations that are trivial.  I have a<br/>
respectable<br/>
	wisdom of 90 something and a skill level of 40 something (been<br/>
playing other<br/>
	characters so haven&#39;t leveled beyond 8 for a long... time) but I<br/>
fail SO<br/>
	OFTEN with onyx and lower.<br/>
<br/>
	Is there a relationship with difficulty of attempt (even when<br/>
trivial) and<br/>
	the rate of failure?  In other words, will I continue to fail the<br/>
same rate<br/>
	on average with a particular trivial combination even after raising<br/>
my skill<br/>
	level by working on harder combinations first?  I think there&#39;s no<br/>
	improvement to the failure rate on combinations that are pretty easy<br/>
like<br/>
	silver/onyx even as I improved my skill in the recent past.  With<br/>
that in<br/>
	mind, I don&#39;t know if I should work with unenchanted electrum and<br/>
malachite<br/>
	to improve my skill level if the rate of trivial failures remains<br/>
constant.<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks for any info or advice you might have.  If this is something<br/>
you<br/>
	could ask someone or even better if there&#39;s a petition or list of<br/>
	suggestions I would request one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
	Subject: Rate of failure on trivial metal/gem combinations too high<br/>
	What:  With a respectable wisdom of 90ish there are far too many<br/>
failures<br/>
	with trivial metal/gem combinations.  Failure rates are running 30%<br/>
to 50%<br/>
	working with trivial items.<br/>
<br/>
	Proposal:  Drastically lower the rate of failure for trivial items<br/>
	(something less than 10%) or eliminate failures for trivial items<br/>
	completely.    OR    Leave fail rates where they are but if you fail<br/>
making<br/>
	a trivial combination you either get a non-magical item or you don&#39;t<br/>
lose<br/>
	anything and have to reenchant the metal or you just don&#39;t lose<br/>
anything.<br/>
	Again, these are only for when an item is trivial.<br/>
<br/>
	Why:  It makes sense to expect a skill gain with the known chance of<br/>
	failure.  It makes no sense to fail often when there is zero chance<br/>
of skill<br/>
	gain because the item is trivial.  If it IS trivial to make, why<br/>
would a<br/>
	craftsman fail so often?  Trivial = easy = no learning = no skill<br/>
gain = low<br/>
	failures<br/>
<br/>
	What would happen:  Not really changing much except making the game<br/>
more<br/>
	fun.  There will still be the current rate of failure for<br/>
non-trivial skill<br/>
	gaining - so we won&#39;t be getting something for nothing.  This will<br/>
make<br/>
	business more fun and less frustrating.  If there are certain items<br/>
that for<br/>
	some reason should never be trivial then you could still fail at<br/>
them and<br/>
	still gain experience.<br/>
<br/>
	thanks,<br/>
