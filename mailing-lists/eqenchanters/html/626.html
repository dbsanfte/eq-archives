<br/>
I got 4 skill points in a row with carelian from 21-24 in like 2 min.<br/>
so i dont think its a bug but maybe you were just to good for it to make<br/>
a diff.<br/>
<br/>
just my 2 cents worth :))<br/>

&gt; jewelry... I borrowed some plat from a friend, killed some dervs, and<br/>
&gt; collected about 90 plat that I was gonna use totally for jewelcraft.<br/>
&gt; I started with a skill of 31 and ended up at 37, because of something<br/>
&gt; really stupid in the game.  I made lots, and I mean LOTS of wedding<br/>
&gt; rings. (carnelian plus silver).  Not ONE point raised into<br/>
&gt; jewelcraft.  After sinking over 50 plat in making stupid wedding<br/>
&gt; rings, and not seeing any improvement (no, it did not give me the<br/>
&gt; &quot;trivial&quot; message) I decided that I was probably wasting my time, but<br/>
&gt; I continued and changed gems for a little variety.  Star Rose Quartz<br/>
&gt; started raising my skill quickly, then became trivial, then I moved to<br/>
&gt; Amber and silver, and kept raising my skill, then jade, when my money<br/>
&gt; ran out (ya I sold everything back except my magic jade rings, gonna<br/>
&gt; sell them to PCs). I figure if I hadn&#39;t made any carnelian, I would be<br/>
&gt; around skill level 43, but I am at skill lvl 37. Moral...  DONT make<br/>
&gt; Carnelian Wedding Rings if you want skill, I think its a bug and you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t get any. If anyone has gotten skill from Carnelian and Silver,<br/>
&gt; please reply... Loreweaver </span></blockquote></div>
