<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286365823">Uhh.. You and your friend, no matter what level he is should easily be<br/>
able to take the necro by the dock.  When I was level 4, a level 7 wiz,<br/>
another level 4 something, and myself took him and his pet VERY easily. <br/>
Unless you were already way low on your hit points.<br/>

&gt; 	*and went around<br/>
&gt; 	*whacking everyone in sight til the charm wore off and Lady <br/>
&gt; 	*Shae killed him.<br/>
