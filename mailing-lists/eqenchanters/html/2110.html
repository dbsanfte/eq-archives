Only one point per each specialization.  I suggest that you decide what you<br/>
want to specialize in ( I hear most enchanters specialize in alteration, I<br/>
know I did).  When you get level 16, train one point into each<br/>
specialization, and then go outside and cast a spell from your &#39;main&#39;<br/>
specialization repeatedly, until specialize:alteration (or conjur, evoc,<br/>
whatever) reaches 51... then no other specializations will beat it and you<br/>
can go about your daily business.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Will Channeling hit 51 before the one you intend on getting there? Or does<br/>
it advance slower because it is not an &quot;official&quot; circle of spells like<br/>
Evocation or Alteration which focus directly on those specific<br/>
Specializations, and have no &quot;Channeling&quot; spell to be cast?<br/>
