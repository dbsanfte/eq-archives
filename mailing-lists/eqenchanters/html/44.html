<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384833777">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I started a high elf enchanter this weekend and enjoyed playing in<br/>
Greater Feydark.  The loot is better I think which is important for<br/>
saving money for your upper level spells.  Neriak, the dark elf city is<br/>
the other place I&#39;ve started a character and know well.  It is a long<br/>
walk in (three zones - forest to foriegn to commons to 3rd gate) to get<br/>
to the inner part of the city which is sometimes too long for me.<br/>
You&#39;ll die at the hands of NPCs alot as a dark elf but it&#39;s sure nice<br/>
seeing in the dark!  I&#39;m used as a scout alot.<br/>
<br/>
Near Felwithe:<br/>
The giant wasp drones are a great source of income; selling their wings<br/>
brings me 1 silver apiece (with 110 charisma).  Also, the orcs in this<br/>
area are wimpy.  Orcs are a great source of weapons and cloth armor<br/>
(which you can wear).  Weapons will sell for half a gold to more than a<br/>
gold all the way up to almost 1 plat for a cracked staff.  Cloth armor<br/>
sells for 1.5 to 2 gold a piece I think.<br/>
