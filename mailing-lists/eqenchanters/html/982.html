<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083007684">Hello,<br/>
I have been following the threads here and i have to agree with most of what everone is saying..  And I am going to try not to repeat everything that has already been stated..  But I would like to point out the things that bug me the most about my Enchanter..<br/>
<br/>
1.  Monsters resisting all my spells..  I had a Yellow one resist Tashan 6 times in a row.. So when it comes to grouping and fighting harder level mob&#39;s then I can either join the fray with my Awesome 2H Blunt abilites (this is a joke) or i can try to increase a fighters attack speed (which btw uses alot of mana and has a very short duration)........( I realize this has been stated  before but it is one that I strongly agree with)<br/>
<br/>
2.  Illusions - I used the Dark Elf illusion the other day and decided to go check out the Dark Elf city..  So I cast the illusion and Invis&#39;d myself, knowing that when I zoned the illusion would be gone..  So I make it into the city and zone into the second part..  I reapply DE illusion and reapplied Invis..  So I run past the Priest of Discord and through the first little Gate, as I am crossing the bridge my invis goes away and a Guard attacks me (mind you that I do have the DE illusion spell on) So in a panic I jump into the water and hit my GATE hotkey and was able to gate out..  Whew..  So when I pop up in Freeport I am thinking WTF??  so I scroll back up my text box to see what exactly happened, well it turns out that when I appeared the Guard says something about My worshipping False Gods and attacked..  So all this being said --  I don&#39;t think that NPC&#39;s should have the ability to tell what god we are aligned with while using an illusion spell.. perhaps we should just be neutral.. <br/>
<br/>
Also in regards to Aradune&#39;s post today which I will post exactly as it appeared on The Rathe Server: (I am looking at a screenshot I took of it)<br/>
&quot;&lt;SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE&gt;: Aradune: If I offended any enchanters last night, it was not my intent, rather it was to encourage you to explore your unique classes abilities, which are very important in dungeons such as Mistmoore and other caster-heavy areas.&quot;<br/>
&quot;&lt;SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE&gt;: Aradune: so my apologies if you took offense, but I do believe that enchanters are a very valuable but very unique class, and people are just beginning to discover their usefullness. hang in there:)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmm  I wonder if he has ever played an Enchanter (why are we the chosen ones to discover our &quot;unique abilities&quot;? Everyone else seems to know theirs)??  My usefullness to my team USE to be to Whirl til it Hurled Mobs to keep the Tanks from taking a beating, but as we all know that has been fixed.  So now I am truly wondering what part do I play on a Team.. I guess I could team up with people a lower level than myself so that my spells would be effective.  I don&#39;t know, but I am not going to give up.  I think there are some problems that need to be addressed and I agree with the person that suggested listing the problems along with valid solutions to each problem and sending it to Verrant..  Perhaps a form type letter that each of us could copy and Email so that they would see just how many people were concerned over the matter.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish you all well, and good huntings.<br/>
