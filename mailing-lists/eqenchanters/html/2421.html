<b>Subject:</b> Happy Love Bracers <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986030034">These bracers are AC1, have a plate look, and a funny name.  They are also a<br/>
quest item... a favored item for Trolls.  The quest requires the happy love<br/>
bracers from ratraz and the head of guard lumpkin from the Ogre/troll<br/>
foreign quarter of Neriak.  Other guard will help lumpkin, so let him wander<br/>
deep into the empty buildings/tunnel behind the neon screen.  Ratraz also<br/>
drops a head on occasion, this one does not work...must be lumpkin&#39;s head.<br/>
Take the bracers and the head to Hukulk in the Grobb Shadowknight guild.<br/>
You need excellent faction with the nightkeep and may have to do his other<br/>
lower quests first.  ( My advice is to bring lots of bone chips... you get<br/>
faction and a rusty 2 handed sword that will pay off the cost of the<br/>
chips... also killing the spore guardian in Innothule nets you a 2 dex, 2<br/>
int mask usable by any evil race, really nice for a lower level DE Necro,<br/>
100pp in Oasis.)  finally,  after all this, you get the Helm of Hukulk, a<br/>
strength and stamina increasing helm, steel plate look, and usable by those<br/>
lovable trolls.  You will be able to sell this in Innothule for a small<br/>
profit considering the time involved... but the risk of ILL: Troll wearing<br/>
off and the potential of failure ( conflicting reports... some enchanters<br/>
claim to have never been able to get the helm, no matter what) means that<br/>
this quest might be best suited to leaving to the Trolls... we do not have<br/>
to do EVERY quest.</div>
