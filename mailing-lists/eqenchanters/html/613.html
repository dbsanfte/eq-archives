<b>Subject:</b> Re: interesting Items in PAW this I found <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806030511">Hey all fellow enchanters,<br/>
    I joind a very powerfull group and went into PAW last night,,,, there for a long time, had a great spawn killing pattern, <br/>
always killing Named shamans, and commanders. GREAT Exp!<br/>
anyway, i found a few interesting things, and i was wondering if anyone knew anything about them? perhaps they are quest items? or something else.<br/>
<br/>
1) Skull of (damn, i forget his name, i&#39;ll post it when i get it...sorry) but i got a skull, and it wont sell, i was not going to sell it, thats just how i test it to see if its anything more.<br/>
<br/>
2) Words of Tyranny:: its a parchement? i think its part of a researchable spell, but i cannot read it, since i cannot research yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3)  thisis not a found item, but something a Mage told me that was in our party. he said he heard rumors of being able to mount a certain skull on the Totem staff??? can anyone confirm this??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx!!!<br/>
