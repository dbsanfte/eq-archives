<div id="ygrps-yiv-564397794">My character is an Erudite. I picked this race because they have the best<br/>
stats and being an enchanter, I dont mind that much not having infravision<br/>
or ultravision. What was important in my choice also is that Erudin is about<br/>
the only place in Norrath that I&#39;ve never been to ( I had several other<br/>
characters before ). About pros and cons, being an enchanter has some pros<br/>
and cons, but being an Erudite has mostly pros, with one big con: the<br/>
starting area really sucks and you have to take a boat everytime you need to<br/>
go back home.<br/>
