<div id="ygrps-yiv-865231846">Among the best sources of information I know of is at eq.castersrealm.com .<br/>
They have complete spell lists with pretty accurate descriptions for every<br/>
class.<br/>
<br/>
As well as trade skill info.<br/>
<br/>
I really try to avoid spoiler info if I can, however, with the spells as<br/>
undocumented as they are (you only get to know the name and what it costs<br/>
you, beyond that, your in the dark), I gave in on spell lists.<br/>
<br/>
However, the best info you gain on your spells will be through experience...<br/>
knowing overall what the spells do is a start, but no site can give you the<br/>
type of knowledge that experience does (which is why anyone who suddenly<br/>
comes upon an account for a lvl 30-52 enchanter is usually really bad at<br/>
it... after 54 or 55, though, it becomes a lot easier, and I&#39;ve known people<br/>
who jumped in at 54 and did well... but between 30 and low-mid 50s, it&#39;s<br/>
VITAL to have a lot of experience behind you to be effective... those are<br/>
also THE most fun levels.  :)  They are really what makes an enchanter an<br/>
enchanter... after 54, everything changes. :&#92;  )<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; does anyone have a guide/know of a website which lists spells and their<br/>
&gt; relations?<br/>
&gt; For example &quot;Mesmerize &gt; Enthrall &gt; Mesmerization &gt; Entrance&quot;....<br/>
&gt; it&#39;d just<br/>
