<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879449646">I m writing down my skill levels every time a skill improves, so I have an overview on which skill to work more. What I ve seen recently is a strange behavior in some skills.<br/>
<br/>
I know that the combat skill is maxed at (level +1) * 3, and the magic skills at (level+1) * 5.<br/>
<br/>
But what about Offense and Defense ? Those are important, and if you neglect them you will be very sorry at higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
I ve seen the following from lvl 10 to lvl 13:<br/>
<br/>
level 10: Defense 45<br/>
level 11: Defense 48<br/>
level 12: Defense 51<br/>
level 13: Defense 54<br/>
<br/>
So, these numbers would indicate a (level+5) * 3<br/>
<br/>
I cant really believe this. Are we really that weak in defense ? At higher levels every critter will hit us for max damage. If somebody knows if this is correct, please reply.<br/>
<br/>
When the Mobs have (level+1) * 5 and we have only 3, this would be dissapointing.</div>
