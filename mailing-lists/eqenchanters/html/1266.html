<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-967391258">I have had great luck selling so far this morning. Selling the new mana<br/>
bracelets for 20p each isn&#39;t a problem. Also, those plus two rings are<br/>
like tailor made for whoeevre needs what, and they sell quick now!  Been<br/>
selling them for between 2 plat up to 6 plat.  I sold CHA bracelets this<br/>
morning for 18plat for a pair plus one CHR necklace. (plus 11CHR total)<br/>
All in all, some great stuff!  I was alsot able to sell a pair of AGI<br/>
Electrum rings for 16plat a pair.  Basically just going by the double<br/>
price law seems to be working finally!<br/>

&gt; Does anyone want to work together to make a price list for selling<br/>
&gt; the new jewelry to players?  Some of it is quite good, so we can <br/>
&gt; probably get a decent amount for even the smaller stuff.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; jade rings (the old kind even) selling for up to 13p on some servers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/">http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/</a> has the updated list of<br/>
&gt; what the new jewelry makes after last nighs patch if you are<br/>
&gt; interested.<br/>
