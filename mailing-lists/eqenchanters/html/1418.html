<b>Subject:</b> Illusion Troll:  regenerate health? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086984427">I have recently obtained 20th level, and learned the spell illusion troll.  <br/>
<br/>
I have done some few tests, and appear to recover health no faster than normal with it on.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know for sure (i.e. done tests yourself recently) that it speeds up healing?</div>
