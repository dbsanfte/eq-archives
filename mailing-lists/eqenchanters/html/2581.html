<div id="ygrps-yiv-162313443">He is 29th or 30th level. There&#39;s 2 frogs that come with him when pulled<br/>
that are mid to high 20&#39;s. Tsu shamans and knights are also in that area of<br/>
Guk, it&#39;s a great spot for exp for a group in high 20&#39;s low 30&#39;s. Got taken<br/>
there myself by some guild members who know the zone well, it wasn&#39;t that<br/>
far from the Shin Lord room (Ghoulbane dropper), which is also a great area<br/>
for high 20&#39;s to get exp (Shin Lord is level 30, everything else was low<br/>
20&#39;s to 25 or 26).<br/>
