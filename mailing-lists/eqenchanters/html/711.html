<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837757865">Transfering from server to server would get disorienting, sort of like<br/>
hopping between alternate worlds. It wouldn&#39;t bother powergamers much,<br/>
since any-old-spawn-spot will do, but I for one wouldn&#39;t like it. Not<br/>
to mention the fact that keeping player info on the servers makes it a<br/>
little more difficult for hackers to get their hands on the binaries.<br/>
Not impossible I don&#39;t think, but so far I&#39;ve yet to see a valid hack<br/>
and hope I never will.<br/>

I realize it&#39;s a tough thing to give up some play time away from your<br/>
favorite character. Take it as a chance to start up a new character,<br/>
try a different race, a different class, a whole new persona. Try to<br/>
expand your experience, don&#39;t limit it by playing the same thing<br/>
everywhere you go. As a look on the brighter side, go play with you&#39;re<br/>
friends on the other server and don&#39;t look at it as being tied down,<br/>
look at it as being set free.<br/>
My two cents.<br/>

&gt; So If I understand you correctly, I have a set of<br/>
&gt; character slots on each<br/>
&gt; server? I would have preferred having just one set<br/>
&gt; of slots and being able<br/>
&gt; to move them from server to server. I recently found<br/>
&gt; out some friends I<br/>
&gt; hadn&#39;t heard from in a while are playing but on a<br/>
&gt; different server. Kinda<br/>
&gt; stinks. Finding a consistent group to play with is<br/>
&gt; hard enough without being<br/>
&gt; &quot;tied down&quot; like this.<br/>
