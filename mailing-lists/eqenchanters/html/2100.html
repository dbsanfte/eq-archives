<div id="ygrps-yiv-68644498">Spend the  initial points then forget about it.  The trade skills are <br/>
supposed to be hard and time consuming to master.  Otherwise everyone <br/>
would be a master at all the skills.<br/>
DEFINITELY save some points for Specialization.  You must put a point into <br/>
one to kick it off and you must have put a point into each of them to get <br/>
one past the 50 mark.<br/>
Research can be practiced fairly easily with just spare pages you pick up <br/>
and the practice runes the gypsies instruct you in.<br/>
One thing I have not tried yet but keep planning on is to find out <br/>
recipe&#39;s for the other classes and try to research their spells.  I hear <br/>
it will always fail but I might still get some improvement out of it.<br/>

Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the list and have Jeweling questions for you.<br/>
My questions involves training points.<br/>
After you spend the max 21 points at the guild and you get to your next<br/>
level can you put those 5 into your Jewel Craft skill? Can you do this at<br/>
each level?<br/>
I realize you may not want to do this or advise it, but is it possible?<br/>
<br/>
What reasons would you give for NOT putting your training points into <br/>
Jewel<br/>
Craft at each level, even if you only put in 1 or 2.<br/>
<br/>
Also, after you reach 16th, how hard is it to do research and advance it?<br/>
Should I save points for Specialization?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
