<div id="ygrps-yiv-759483968">I had great luck in North Karanna with Pincer beetles.  There are alot of<br/>
griffawns, griffeenes, and a few griffons not to mention Hill Giants.<br/>
However, if you fight near the guard tower near the gypsies the guards can<br/>
help you out.  I died twice in a few levels, once to a second wisp that<br/>
snuck up on me when killing the first wisp and once by a hill giant that I<br/>
was watching fight two guards.  I was drawn to attack it because it only had<br/>
the teeniest sliver of life left after workin the guards but of course I was<br/>
stupid and took 2 hits and died without landing a single point of damage.<br/>
Too bad I didn&#39;t remember my damage shield heh.  Anyway, if you don&#39;t mind<br/>
killing bears and wolves there are LOTS of them in NK too.  Not too many<br/>
people, high level people who can occassionly help you, and places to sell<br/>
nearby for non evil people I believe.  Wolves and bears would probably be<br/>
better around 12 and pincer beetles as you hit 13 or 14.  Be careful of<br/>
borer and scythe beetle which will help the pincers if you get to close.<br/>

I found North Ro to be great from 12-14 where I am now. Spiders, Scarabs <br/>
are great to solo and numerous. Want to group? Jump in on one of the many <br/>
Derv hunting parties for some REAL good experience, and pretty darn good <br/>
loot too.<br/>
