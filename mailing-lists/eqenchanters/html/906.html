<div id="ygrps-yiv-116972366">Switching characters between servers is the stupidest idea anyone ever <br/>
thought of... how are you ever going to be able to contact friends you made <br/>
on one server? Of course YOU live near all your friends and can call them up <br/>
saying let&#39;s all go to this server but everyone doesn&#39;t have that option... <br/>
DO THEY? Think about it from a programming point of view, the transfering of <br/>
characters would leave many many loopholes and whereas a program similar to <br/>
uoextreme could jump in and give you 1000000 platium... hmm... You didn&#39;t <br/>
think things through did you? Okay, you still don&#39;t agree so here goes some <br/>
more... A new server comes up and everyone playing it is a newbie then all <br/>
the sudden verant let&#39;s us do this stupid server switching crap and <br/>
blacksmiths go over there selling everything at 5 times the cost they could <br/>
get on an established server. This would also let high level parties go to a <br/>
new server and camp all the huge monsters... Emporer Crush for example? <br/>
Let&#39;s look a bit deeper... How would a guild be able to keep in contact? <br/>
Talking between servers would cause ungodly 24 hour 7 days a week 365 days a <br/>
year LAG!!!!! Not to mention the constant character switching would cause <br/>
more lag therefore screwing up your playing anyways... So basically pick <br/>
your server and STICK TO IT!!!! Why are people always wanting to move? When <br/>
I first started playing I picked the server with the least amouth of people <br/>
on it... Bertoxx, and it still remains towards the bottom of the server list <br/>
and even if it had 2000 people playing all the time I would not switch <br/>
because all my friends on that server... so thank you and sorry if it <br/>
sounded like a flame because it was suppose to sound worse than that.<br/>
