<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862228251">first off what is the diffence between these too they seem to do the same<br/>
thing for me.  Also why if you cast these spells does it agro eveything<br/>
around you?  I though it was suppose to be a blur.  I dont remember blanket<br/>
agroing things before last patch did they screw it up or did I just get<br/>
lucky and it didnt agro them?  I didnt get Mind Wipe till after the patch<br/>
but it did the same thing too me agroing everything it hit onto me.<br/>
