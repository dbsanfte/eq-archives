<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260831342">When I soloed at 21 i forget about the whole mez, debuff thing. Disempower <br/>
does just about nothing on a npc anyways. instead i just buffed pet, pulled <br/>
with tashan, whirl, choke, whirl, DD, whirl, DD, whirl.... til dead.  if a <br/>
mob is stunned the whole fight theres no need to debuff. I dunno but for me i <br/>
thought this was much more efficient than the debuff method.  Hermit in south <br/>
karana is a good solo spot.  too often aviaks will jump you so i didnt solo <br/>
them much. also roaming mobs in overthere right outside the outpost are <br/>
pretty good at this level<br/>
