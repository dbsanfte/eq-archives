Um... hon, i need to talk to you... in Barbarian.<br/>
Heh.<br/>
<br/>
Question #2:<br/>
I saw on Baelish&#39;s site (I think) that the number of typed lines spammed<br/>
will influence how fast you improve the language skill.<br/>
e.g. less lines:<br/>
<br/>
1 /g This is a neat language!<br/>
<br/>
will improve your skill less that if you are spammed the full window of 5(?)<br/>
available lines in the hot-key:<br/>
<br/>
1 /g blah   	vs:	  	1 /g 	what<br/>
2 /g blah				2	language<br/>
3 /g blah				3	am<br/>
4 /g blah				4	I<br/>
5 /g blah				5 	learning?<br/>
<br/>
Is this because each /g command within the script executes a seperate<br/>
language check? Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;Not knowing the full answer just pisses me off!<br/>
Don&#39;t give me a &quot;hint&quot; that leads to lost time<br/>
and energy that could be spent taking advantage<br/>
of stupid people.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Just curious as I have little experience with languages....<br/>
&gt; can you increase your language ability by grouping with someone and then<br/>
&gt; using group talk to increase skill?  The other member of the group won&#39;t<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, this is the most efficient way of increaseing your language skill.<br/>
Just get a group together, and spam eachother in the language you wish to<br/>
teach<br/>
them.  Here&#39;s another hint.  You can teach a person up to 1 in skill better<br/>
than yours, so if you put a point in, you can teach your freind to 2.  Then<br/>
you<br/>
zone.  He teaches you to 3.  Zone.  You teach him to 4.  Etc.</div>
