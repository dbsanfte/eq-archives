<div id="ygrps-yiv-849738726"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I have a few questions, some of which I think I know the answers to.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(hopefully someone can shed a new light on them for me).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;1. In what ways does CHA effect our characters?  A GM hinted around that it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>effects some spells in some way or another, but she would not confirm<br/>
anything...<br/>
<br/>
CHA lowers your buying price, and raises your selling price. It also<br/>
modifies your chance of Charm/Alliance type spells taking affect.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2. What effects the Duration of a spell?  anyone every notice that if a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>level 14 druid SOW&#39;s you that it doesn&#39;t last no where near as long as if a<br/>
level 30 or so does it?<br/>
<br/>
A lot of spells have a level based component. Spells like SoW and our Haze<br/>
series have a duration based on  your level(at lvl 10 it lasts 10 rounds, at<br/>
30 it lasts 30 rounds). DD and DoT spells damage components are level<br/>
based(at level 10 it does 20 points at level 30 it does 40 points).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3. Does anyone know what determines our &quot;Hit-percentages&quot; at higher levels<br/>
 </span></blockquote>when transformed (using an illusion) say into a Fire Ele?  (or any illusion<br/>
where we can become a Mob of some type)  is it our 2H blunt that determines<br/>
hit or miss?  Hand-to-hand? etc...<br/>
<br/>
If you are still using a weapon, it would be whatever weapon skill is<br/>
relivent.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;4. Does anyone know of any illusion spells that we may aquire besides the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Race type ones (Dwarf, Human, High Elf, Troll, etc..) and these I have<br/>
list - (Tree, Earth Ele, Skeleton, Air Ele, Water Ele, Fire Ele, Dry Bone,<br/>
Spirit Wolf) So do you know of any that I have not listed?<br/>
<br/>
Most if not all Illusion spells can be found in Erudin Palace in the<br/>
Enchanter Guild or in the Libarary. I haven&#39;t had the need/desire to go and<br/>
catalog all the spells there... yet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well I think I have asked enough questions for today, I sure hope to get<br/>
 </span></blockquote>some good feedback and would like to thank you ahead of time..<br/>
