<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269834658">*Kill stealing is not &quot;illegal.&quot; It&#39;s a fact of life in the game.<br/>
*Although I do hope they change the way looting is handled.<br/>
<br/>
Read the GM FAQ on the main EQ site, www.everquest.com  The issue of<br/>
killstealing is an offense if the person doing the killstealing is<br/>
continuously doing it to one person to harrass them.<br/>
<br/>
Stalking/Harassment - following a player around after that player has asked<br/>
to be left alone, continually vulching and kill stealing from the same<br/>
person, and in general focusing unwelcome attention upon another player over<br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, that&#39;s all they mention as abuse, but I know what you mean,<br/>
about people who time their attacks to do the most damage or just don&#39;t<br/>
listen when you tell them you&#39;ve got it and to back off.  They really make<br/>
the game frustrating.</div>
