FYI, regarding your jewelry website....<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned in my post to the group,  I&#39;ve also maxed my skill in<br/>
training points (21?) and have not yet seen a raise in skill after about 5<br/>
successes(non &#39;trivial&#39;) and 3 successes (trivial at my level) and 2<br/>
failures.....so your formula seems right on...2 of 10 attempts failed at my<br/>
level.  i was, of course, using enchanted silver, too...and have not<br/>
yielded a magical item yet.  I am using cat&#39;s eye at this point, as the<br/>
lapis and hematite gives me &#39;trivial at your skill level&#39; messages.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the carnelian/silver combo will make a wedding ring.  I&#39;ve made one of<br/>
two attempts at that.<br/>
