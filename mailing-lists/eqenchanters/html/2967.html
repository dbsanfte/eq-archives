<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999809553"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Quite awhile ago, when I was playing a different enchanter, someone <br/>
&gt; explained to me how to use charm when soloing.  I tried using this <br/>
&gt; technique (level 15 at the time) and just died a lot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I have a new enchanter who just made level 16 and I&#39;d like to try <br/>
&gt; again, but I think I need to understand more details of the <br/>
&gt; technique.  As I recall....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Find a mob to charm, with another of similar level not to far away.  <br/>
&gt; Stand as far back as you can and cast Tashan.  At this point do I <br/>
&gt; back up while waiting for the gems to refresh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I use this technique to gain extra casting time in many situations while<br/>
soloing.  As soon as your spell goes off start moving away from your target.<br/>
You can even be facing away from the target so you&#39;re running forward<br/>
instead of backward.  Just before your spell gems become available again,<br/>
stop and start turning.  The reason for turning is that the client does not<br/>
send a message to the server right away when you just stop movement, it only<br/>
does this at certain intervals, but if you turn, this data is sent to the<br/>
server immediately.  You&#39;ll have less chance of being interrupted by doing<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Then cast charm on <br/>
&gt; the approaching mob.  Find the other mob, and tell the charmed pet to <br/>
&gt; attack it.  Should I cast something on the other mob now, to give my <br/>
&gt; pet a little advantage?  Perhaps choke? Sit back and med (but then I <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t tell the health of either).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I usually throw a choke on and then watch the healths of your pet and the<br/>
other mob.  You can be medding and still check helths.  Tapping F1 twice<br/>
will target your pet, then you can type /assist to get your pet&#39;s target.<br/>
If you have a /assist hotkey, you can toggle between your pet and the other<br/>
mob with it, since they are each other&#39;s target.  You&#39;ll probaby want to get<br/>
up and move away from the fight from time to time.  The other mob will come<br/>
towards you every once in a whie, moving the  fight closer to you, and once<br/>
it&#39;s close enough it will start hitting you, especially if you&#39;re sitting.<br/>
Throw another choke or even a DD in there if you need to to make sure your<br/>
pet will win.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; After charmed mob beats up other <br/>
&gt; mob, tell it to guard here and back off.  When charm breaks kill it - <br/>
&gt; but what should I use to kill it?  What do I do if charm wears off <br/>
&gt; early and both mobs come after me.  Recharm?  This is what usually <br/>
&gt; resulted in my death before.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you get both mobs on you, stun them, take a few steps away (as descibed<br/>
above) and recharm.  Or if need be, stun, mez then recharm.<br/>
<br/>
