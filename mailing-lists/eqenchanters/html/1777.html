<div id="ygrps-yiv-780776644">Just wondering but has anyone else noticed this on the Mythiran Tower website (straight cut and paste) &quot;I realize this list is far from complete, and I understand animated hands drop the enchanter recipe books&quot; any idea if this is true or not and if so where in the heck are animated hands?</div>
