buff they use is see invisible. Its a risky trip true. As soon as you zone<br/>
run forward there is a wall and guards that may protect you. MAY. Good luck<br/>
it does get easier later on and the trip is sort of a rite of passage for<br/>
all enchanters.<br/>

spell.  I had read many reports on this list, so I thought myself prepared.<br/>
After about an hour and a half trip from Felwithe, I finally reach High Hold<br/>
Pass.  My invisibility still going strong, I procede in a short distance<br/>
only to be rooted and killed by some #@!!@#$ orc who could see invisible.  I<br/>
came from Kithicor forest.  Was I just unlucky?  Is there another better way<br/>
in, other than through kithicor?  That place is insane.  How do they expect<br/>
us to ever get a pet at this level?  I&#39;ve been hearing Mages whine about<br/>
have to research 24th level pets.  How about getting screwed out of 8th<br/>
level.  If my bitching is unfounded, please tell me.  I will appologize.  If<br/>
there is an easier way, or I just got unlucky, let me know.  Please.<br/>
