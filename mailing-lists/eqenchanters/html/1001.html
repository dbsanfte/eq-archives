&gt;around... And besides, you won&#39;t be able to switch servers there anyways! <br/>
&gt;that and other and just play the game. Look at UO, you can&#39;t switch servers <br/>
&gt;there... Can you??? Hell no and people still play it, you can&#39;t switch<br/>

<br/>
Man, whats with you and switching servers?  Think of it as in Star Trek.<br/>
They have the<br/>
prime directive, not to interfere with other cultures.  Well, EQ isn&#39;t that<br/>
extreme, but<br/>
if you have a server that&#39;s been around for a year, you&#39;ll have a whole<br/>
bunch of lv50<br/>
guys switching to the new server bringing thousands and thousands of plat<br/>
(among other things)<br/>
<br/>
That does two things, money/items leaving the old server screws up the<br/>
economy there, and money<br/>
going into the new server screws up the economy there.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thats because its a non-issue.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose for a moment you had good communiation with your friends before<br/>
starting a character.<br/>
Then you could all pick a server and thats that.<br/>

About the protest.  I share the same concerns as every other enchanter so<br/>
I&#39;m going to join<br/>
in.  I&#39;m just wondering about that letter we should all send to verant.<br/>
Did anyone actually write<br/>
one?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
