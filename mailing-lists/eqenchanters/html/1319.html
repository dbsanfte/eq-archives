&gt; aha!!!! that&#39;s the answer i wanted! thank you =) so, my only question left<br/>
&gt; is, how does specialization go up (i assume when you cast the spell, both<br/>
&gt; the discipline and the specialization go up?) and where can i learn<br/>
&gt; specialization?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Before the patch it was offered to me at the Enchanter&#39;s guild in<br/>
Felwithe, so I assume it is still there.  Did you scroll through all<br/>
the skills and still not find it?  It should be offerered by your<br/>
guildmaster.  Whether it goes up through use or solely through<br/>
training I do not know, but the patch message seemed to suggest<br/>
only by training?  I&#39;m not level 20 yet so I don&#39;t know for sure.<br/>
Here is the example from the patch message:<br/>
<br/>
Example: Mildred the Magnificent (Wizard) has a 50 skill in both her<br/>
Specialize:<br/>
Evocation and her Specialize: Abjuration. Mildred decides that she wants<br/>
to be<br/>
an Evocation specialist. She goes to her guildmaster and trains one<br/>
point in<br/>
Specialize: Evocation. She now was a 51 skill in Specialize: Evocation.<br/>
No other<br/>
specialize skill will be able to go higher than 50. <br/>
