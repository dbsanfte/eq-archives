<br/>
This is an onlline world that is consistently changing what good would<br/>
moving a character to anohter server do? So your friends are not on the same<br/>

&gt;hopefully Microsoft learns from that major EQ mistake. (I&#39;d still like to<br/>
&gt;play with all my friends and co-workers on the same server, instead of<br/>
&gt;spread out over 4 servers, pity EQ doesn&#39;t realize how critical this<br/>
