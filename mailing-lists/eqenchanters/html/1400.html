Good luck.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Greetings all!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a relatively young Enchanter (level 5) and am seeking some knowledge.<br/>
&gt; How do the Illusion spells work?  I have both Illusion:Human and Illusion<br/>
&gt; Half-elf and have tested them out briefly.  I am a Dark Elf, so when I<br/>
&gt; changed to a human, I lost my Ultravision, making everything pitch black.<br/>
&gt; At least the Half-elves get infravision.  My questions are these:  If I<br/>
&gt; change to human, do I get the experience point bonus (or rather lose the XP<br/>
&gt; penalty for being a non-human)?  I&#39;ve heard that the Illusion spells do not<br/>
&gt; mask religious identity.  How safe would I be walking in Freeport with one<br/>
&gt; of the illusion spells active?  Would I still be KOS?  <br/>
