Screw that. The other classes are nowhere near as broke as we are yet they<br/>
don&#39;t get gimped. What about thsoe 6 level 16 necros who take down a sand<br/>
gaint? Could 6 levle 16&#39;s of any other class do that? I think not. Why?<br/>
Because they have an Unresistable spell. And its a damage spell too. So why<br/>
is Verant screwing with removing our non damaging unresistable spell when<br/>
Necros get one that allows them to do stuff no other class can?<br/>
Favoritsm perhaps?<br/>

&gt;um whatever, be sad about enchanters and know that Verrant seems to not<br/>
&gt;care about enchanters but is instead improving other classes.  You will<br/>
&gt;see no improvement to the enchanter class and the problems you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;mentioned with spells probably won&#39;t ever be fixed...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, to help you understand what I meant in my previous post, take the<br/>
&gt;above statement and make all the negative things positive.  I take all<br/>
&gt;the complaining about enchanters to be the top statement and my previous<br/>
&gt;post to be the opposite, which is characterized by the statement<br/>
&gt;below...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;be HAPPY about enchanters and know that Verrant seems to CARE about<br/>
&gt;enchanters but is instead improving other classes FIRST.  You will see<br/>
&gt;improvementS to the enchanter class and the problems you&#39;ve mentioned<br/>
&gt;with spells probably WILL be fixed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, be positive and let Verrant know how you feel.  Give them<br/>
&gt;constructive feedback and let them know you are unhappy.<br/>

&gt;is that supposed to make sus feel better??  that fact that they are<br/>
&gt;making us <br/>
&gt;stinkier and making other classes better?<br/>
