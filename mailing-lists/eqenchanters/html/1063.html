<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039429335">Ok, just did a quick log to check out the last patch.<br/>
<br/>
- Alliance. Try illus human + alliance on a vendor (Freeport) (I play<br/>
Erudite) Price did not go down. . Tried the same on the Erudite gemseller<br/>
in EC, same result. So this is obviously not this spell&#39;s use. Still at it,<br/>
I have other ideas to test.<br/>
<br/>
- Poison. Meditating is NOT sitting. I wish someone told me that before.<br/>
Just figured it out after I saw the poison effect wore off and watched the<br/>
hp grows.<br/>
<br/>
- Jewelry. Jewel&#39;s prices are related to the level of one&#39;s skill. At<br/>
jewelry 30 I sold rose quartz wedding ring at 133sp (+cp), made 31 and<br/>
price went up 152 (+cp). Almost no loss :P. I noticed something similar<br/>
earlier (I worked lvl 9-13 on my own before buying the rest of the lvls<br/>
from a teacher). So maybe jewelry is not so bugged in the first place. If<br/>
anyone else can confirm/infirm this I would appreciate (test sales before<br/>
and after a 10th is reached)<br/>
