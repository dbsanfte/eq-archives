<br/>
I personnally have never looked at twinking as cheating, more just of<br/>
shortcutting. I do tend to avoid playing with twinked people as I have found<br/>
that most of them can&#39;t play for squat. They tend to consider themselves<br/>
invulnerable, as most monsters near their level are quite easy to kill. At<br/>
some point (Brad has said this and I have seen it in action), the monsters<br/>
you are fighting catch up to whatever gear you have, and then you must rely<br/>
on teamwork and play skill to survive. And if the twinkees (generally) had<br/>
that to begin with, they could go out and get level appropriate gear and<br/>
survive. &lt;gets down off his soapbox and awaits the flames while waiting for<br/>
an on topic thread to start&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
So now that the lifetap spells of necro&#39;s are resistable, are people finding<br/>
it even easier to find a group?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Twinking is having one of your high level characters gain<br/>
&gt; equipment/items/money and then transfer it to one of your lower level<br/>
&gt; characters.  One method of doing this is to &quot;drop&quot; the items on the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ground,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; log out, log in with your other character and &quot;find&quot; them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another method is to pay another player to hold the items while you log<br/>
 </span></blockquote>out<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; and back in with your other character.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many regard twinking as cheating as far as &quot;that character&quot; did not earn<br/>
&gt; those items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
