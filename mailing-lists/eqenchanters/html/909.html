FIRST ENCHANTER TO 50 (AT LEAST I THINK SO)     7:08PM PST- Kellindil<br/>
Another member of the Fires of Heaven member guild has reached level 50.<br/>
Zamtil Litmaz, the gnomish enchanter, got it earlier today. He&#39;s the first<br/>
enchanter to reach 50 that I know of. Here&#39;s a screenshot of him in his<br/>
spiffy new robe: Zamtil<br/>
<br/>
ps.  any enchanters on The Rathe server that would like to group with me?<br/>
I&#39;ve only ONCE grouped with a fellow enchanter and would enjoy the<br/>
commisserable.<br/>
<br/>
Fistlebane, High Elf Enchanter of the 12th level.  ...currently slumming<br/>
around Freeport/Commonlands area.</div>
