<div id="ygrps-yiv-507581515">the way i understand it agility has nothing to do with it (as long as your not<br/>
hurt or encumbered that is) - it&#39;s the connection speed and most importantly<br/>
your computer (including such things as CPU, videocard and RAM) - now for my<br/>
experiences<br/>
<br/>
i have 4 accounts and 3 computers running off a cable modem - my computer is a<br/>
celeron 450, 196 ram and voodoo3 - my roommate has a p2 300,  64 ram and a rage<br/>
pro card - the third computer is a p2 200, 128ram and a pos video card<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m a level 29 half elf bard - he&#39;s a level 31 half elf ranger - while going<br/>
through the karanas i have to follow him or after a few mins he&#39;ll be out of<br/>
range of my song and i&#39;ll leave him in the dust - now we decided to play around<br/>
with it a little bit and when i log onto my account on his computer i never lose<br/>
him but when i&#39;m on mine i have to watch him using 3rd person per and i stop and<br/>
wait when i see my song pulse not hit him - now when i log on with the 3rd<br/>
computer i always have to wait and make sure i don&#39;t leave them behind so i<br/>
usually just play on that computer and have my computer&#39;s char follow me instead<br/>
<br/>
now i know it&#39;s not lag as we&#39;re all running on the same network and since we<br/>
switch computers to test a few things out my conclusion is that the only things<br/>
that make people go faster is a better computer/connection - now i know this<br/>
might not be enough evidence for everyone but it was enough to convience both me<br/>
and my roommate but i dunno - maybe we&#39;re just weird</div>
