<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573039140">Ever since I started playing Everquest I have found that whenever something good is found it is changed  removed or made incredibly hard. Why don&#39;t they remove the FBR&#39;s?, I see alot of them around.  <br/>
<br/>
The same thing with Runed Totem Staffs, I could not wait to reach a level high enough so I could get one to sell to re-coup the 20pp I paid for mine.<br/>
NOPE...LORE.<br/>
<br/>
Jewel Craft? don&#39;t get me going,  no NPC yet has come close to giving me the money to get my skill very high. <br/>
<br/>
Quests?.. As soon as I made my character I tried to do the quest in my guild.. what does he say? Um..ah no on second thought I will do it myself..what a joke... and it is still like that. I then hear about the stein.oh sounds cool mabye I will try a quest again... I complete the myriad of tasks only to recieve nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Still open minded and willing to take such a large faction hit,  I start to try again only to see it is now going to be made more difficult and is no longer the magic beer mug(don&#39;t get that one either). <br/>
<br/>
And the real kicker <br/>
<br/>
The in-ability of GM&#39;s to solve any problem I have had, the biggest being the fact I was allowed to create my character without using my 30 extra points. This from people whom I assume would have the ability to create any level character they wanted, or at least know where to direct me. Instead I am told I am SOL. This game consumes way to much time to have been released with such bugs.<br/>
<br/>
I give up..going back to power gaming or better yet back to Shooters. <br/>
<br/>
At least I gave RPG&#39;s a chance.<br/>
