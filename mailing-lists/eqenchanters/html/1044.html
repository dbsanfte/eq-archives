<b>Subject:</b> Re: Rune I, Jade, and Brilliance <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-59239386">1. Rune I is a great spell, its a lot like divine aura (cleric).  More or<br/>
less it grants invunerability for a short time which I&#39;m sure you can<br/>
imagine is quite handy.  A good spell to have!<br/>
<br/>
2.  Jade is also available in Akanon, at the jeweler immediately beside the<br/>
bankers, as are all other stones except perhaps black pearls or wolfs eye<br/>
agate.  The metals are available in the room nearest the bank.<br/>
<br/>
3.  I have recently aquired a level 44 spell : Brilliance and want to know<br/>
what it does.  This sounds a lot like the &#39;enchantment of brilliance&#39; spell<br/>
which was supposedly removed from the game.  Has anyone USED this spell?<br/>
If I get a good offer I may sell it, it is quite a ways from where I am<br/>
(lvl wise) and I can probably get it again.  You can /tell me on Rallos Zek<br/>
if you are interested.<br/>

&gt;Can anyone give me a good description of how Rune spells work and a<br/>
&gt;strategy for using them effectivel?.  At 2GP per cats eye agate, I<br/>
&gt;don;t want to use the spell the wrong way.<br/>
