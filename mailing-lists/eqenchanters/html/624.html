<div id="ygrps-yiv-568393118">Yes, if you are charmed you can Wail other players and kill them, your <br/>
turned into a NPC basically, Except players dont really regard you as huch <br/>
of a treat =) UNTIL your hitting them, i&#39;ve seen a guy charmed before and he <br/>
was wailing someone, and i just turn&#39;d and ran. I&#39;m not sure on the looting <br/>
tho.. i&#39;d assume that you couldnt, but dunno.<br/>
