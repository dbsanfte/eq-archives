<b>Subject:</b> Exp at 35, gear at 50, hunting without a cleric 50+ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053305964">I spent 34-50 pretty much entirely in Lower Guk. Post Kunark, it has mobs to<br/>
be pulled aplenty. My first stop was Supplier room (at 34) to get a light<br/>
burlap sack. As a bonus, I got a guildy a TBB there. At 35, you can handle<br/>
breaking Sage/cav/exe/sav camp. 27 mobs every 29 minutes. Once you and your<br/>
group get it together, after the first pull, it will all be single pulls.<br/>
Outside Karnor&#39;s in Dreadlands is also great exp 35-45. A full group at 35<br/>
outside Karnors can kill just about anything in the zone. Or go into the<br/>
Yeti caves on the north side of the zone.<br/>
<br/>
I personnally will not go into Karnor&#39;s Castle, Sebilis, or Chardok without<br/>
a cleric in the group. Other places can be done 50+ for exp without a<br/>
cleric, but not those. You can do Efreeti without a cleric 50+, the front<br/>
spawns in the Hole are also good exp til 53 and do able without a cleric.<br/>
<br/>
Gear at 50 : This is what I had at 50, I did go with my guild to Hate at 48<br/>
and started getting Insidious, not sure if that&#39;s an option for you.<br/>
