<div><font size="2">Does anyone know the best mobs to look for to get Tasarin&#39;s 
pages 30 and 312 for beserker strength and color shift spells.&nbsp; Since I 
fail repeatedly at making them, and I see no one auctioning these pages, at this 
rate I will be level 30 before I have them.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">And looking ahead a bit as well, where should I go for the 
level 24 research pages as well.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">I was level 18 when I found out that Jonah and other Lake 
Rathe mobs give level 16 ones out like candy.&nbsp; Now those pages (for 16) are 
all I ever see anywhere (I practically throw them away I have so many), but 
there must be other treasure troves like Jonah for level 20 and 24 spells too (I 
hope). </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">My poor (and I mean &#39;broke&#39;) level 21 enchantress has CHA and 
INT both just over 130.&nbsp; I am working hard on jewelcraft to try to fill in 
my (bare) ear slots, and wrist slots in particular, but she currently sports 
damask or leather or cloth underwear. A second question I have is .. at what 
level can I successfully do Evil Eyes in the gorge (given the above stats, and 
with a magic resist of 57).&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">My druid, with a partner druid, has a lot of trouble with them 
at level 25/26 (magic resist at base 25) but since evil eyes are enchanters, I 
hoped we might be more successful at earlier levels?&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">&nbsp;I (my enchanter) often group with a level 21 cleric but 
I think we might need another tank type to help out (unless my pet can take on 
that role?)&nbsp; Evil eyes often seem to have both an animation and a mino pet, 
and they throw blindness, fear, debuffs and charm on us. Can be wild there. Fun 
but I am going steadily backwards with my druid so far.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">Thanks for any help you can give me. I enjoy this list very 
much. </font></div>
