<div id="ygrps-yiv-273408091"><br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">This is why Enchanters are so very good at doing Quests.</font>

<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">I have not done this part with my enchanter yet as he is too low level to enjoy Kunark.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">My Iksar however sees the Legion of cabilis go up with those kills and I am pretty sure that includes the Warlords.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">If not then hopefully your Illusion and Alliance series are good enough to raise the faction enough not to be KOS.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">I never rely on Invis as my first line of defense when dealing with merchants or Quests.</font>

thanks for the great info (thanks to others who posted how to raise faction<br>
too).<br>
 <br>
the only hitch to this is how do you turn stuff in when you are KOS to begin<br>
with? &nbsp;I attempted to turn in items to the warlord on the balcony in the<br>
lake of ill omen and as soon as I left clicked on him with the item on the<br>
cursor I became visible as he killed me. &nbsp;At 170 a shot I lasted about 3<br>
hits heh. &nbsp;Did I just have bad luck, did I do something wrong, or has this<br>
generally worked for people?<br>
 <br>
thanks!<br>

If the banker is Scowling Ready to Attack I don&#39;t think you can bank with<br>
him. &nbsp;Especially since here are two bankers right next to each other. <br>
Do the newbie quests as those raise all guild factions I believe. <br>
Field of Bone hand in Scorpion Pincers <br>
Lake of Ill Omen hand in Sarnak hatchling brains (Also can hand in those to<br>
the Necro guild) <br>
Warsliks Wood it is Goblin watcher torches or beads <br>
Lake of Ill Omen it is froglok tongues. <br>
One of the Troopers in Field of Bone near the city gate also takes 4 bone<br>
chips. <br>
All of these are 4 item at a time quests. <br>
<br>
After you have done those 4 a bit and you probably need Iksar and<br>
benevolence to turn them in, but invis might work. <br>
Then do the cuirskin quest. <br>
Gate a backpack full of hides off scaled wolf pups and go to the merchant<br>
near the monk guild. <br>
Ask to preform a small service (spell preform or perform, I forget) and get<br>
a special pack to put the hides in then combine them and hand it back. <br>
This I believe raises resident faction. <br>
