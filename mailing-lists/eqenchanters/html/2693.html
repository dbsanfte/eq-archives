<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907906860"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Mez is basically a stun type spell.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">However it is a stun that lasts longer then other stuns but breaks the moment the critter takes damage.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">You can use Mez to then debuff the target while they just stand there but once it wears off they usually come after you.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Sometimes MEz will wipe the hate list from the target and if your out of agro range they will just wander off. &nbsp;This happens more often with the lower level creatures. &nbsp;It is a 4th level spell after all.</font>
<br>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">The lull line, last I heard were not supposed to agro the target on a resist most of the time. &nbsp;It was just something that is to happen once in awhile.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">I have not used it in a long time as I rarely play and when I do I rarely camp.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">However I have cast it several times on creatures. &nbsp;The problem with the spell is it narrows the aggro range but does not eliminate it so nearby critters will still come. &nbsp;Also it is a short duration spell.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">However if it works then you pull the others in the camp and are far enough away the guy you lulled will not come after you, even after lull wears off.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">With Mez he most likely will come.</font>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Basically, if you need to break a camp where the critters are close<br>
&gt;together, use mez and memblur, or get a bard, druid, or ranger to do<br>
&gt;it while you take care of any messes if they fail.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has been my experience that you have to lull (sooth, calm) the mobs<br>
&gt;&gt; farthest away fist. If an agro mob runs past on the has been soothed the<br>
&gt;&gt; sooth wears of and they both come<br>
&gt;<br>
 </span></blockquote>This post comes at just the right time. &nbsp;Last night myself and a paly were<br>
working the gobbie camp in BB near dagnors. &nbsp;Tring to mez the gobbies got<br>
resisted consistantly. &nbsp;I was wondering if maybe I should have used lull.<br>
As I also play a ranger I have used harmany alot and love it. From my<br>
reading it seems mez is a form of lull that lasts longer and works in<br>
combat. &nbsp;Am I wrong in this? &nbsp;<br>
<br>
It is quite the rush when it gets busy mezing and telling the paly what to<br>
hit and what to leave alone. &nbsp;I think I&#39;m finally getting how to use Mez.<br>
Still need lots of practice but thanks for the advice offered so far.<br>
