<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;not quite. Mesmerize stuns ( any attack will unstun ) and mixes the hate<br/>
&gt;list of the target, but does not remove it like memory blur.<br/>
&gt;Skara &lt;Elite&gt; on Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try this:<br/>
Stash your weapon (use your fists). Hit a low level <br/>
mob (I used a non-agressive rat).  The rat will <br/>
turn and attack you.  Cast mesmerize, stop your <br/>
attack and back away.  <br/>
<br/>
When I did this, the rat eventually woke up and just <br/>
walked right by me.  This seems to me to indicate <br/>
that I was cleared from his &#39;hate list&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody have any other explanation for this?</div>
