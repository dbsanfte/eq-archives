<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036784471">Oh that reminded me.  A helpful person casted invis on me and my pet<br/>
suicided.  Same thing happened to my friend.  Sort of related, my pet<br/>
suicided once when I hid as a necro (hiding skill).  If you switch to an<br/>
external view will you see your self (or not I guess) when invisible and<br/>
then see when you aren&#39;t anymore?<br/>

Invisibility by nature is unreliable.  If you are invisible, still keep<br/>
away<br/>
 from any harmful creature.  Instead, when you want to have a minimal<br/>
chance<br/>
that you will be killed, cast it and hope.<br/>
<br/>
I use invisibility to travel through Highpass Hold, and across East<br/>
Karana<br/>
when I don&#39;t want to encounter some of the nasties in there.<br/>
<br/>
As to duration, it can last from a few seconds to several minutes.  I<br/>
have<br/>
had it last over 20 minutes, and it usually lasts from about 5 minutes<br/>
to 10<br/>
minutes.  If a creature spots you and is unfriendly, then invis will not<br/>
stop it from hitting you.  Once spotted, and on that creatures hate<br/>
list,<br/>
neither invis nor minor illusion will stop you from being attacked.<br/>
<br/>
Still, all in all it is a useful spell.  If you must travel in hated<br/>
lands,<br/>
by all means use it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

&gt;I gave up a level 16 dark-elf necro because their invisibility spell (<br/>
