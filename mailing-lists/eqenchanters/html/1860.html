&gt; I&#39;ve done it 4 times and will do it again twice tonight.  This is to<br/>
replace<br/>
&gt; the 4 I sold or traded, will have one for myself and one for the druid who<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; helps me gather the ingredients.<br/>
&gt; The 4 steins have really raked in untold riches, by my count 4000<br/>
platinum, a<br/>
&gt; pair of dwarven workboots, Shimmering orb, the list goes on and on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After doing it 4 times I decided to go to kaladim and see how my faction<br/>
&gt; decline was progressing.  I found the guards glowered at me dubiously<br/>
&gt; including the king himself.  I went out to the chessboard, ruins, etc and<br/>
&gt; bought 90 bone chips for 1g each from the people hunting and turned them<br/>
in a<br/>
&gt; few at a time to improve my faction.  After that, the king regarded me<br/>
&gt; indifferently but the guards still regarded me dubiously.  What if another<br/>
&gt; new quest pops up that requires us to go to Kaladim?  I don&#39;t want to<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; about it.  After I get the 2 steins tonight I will charge 2000 platinum to<br/>
&gt; complete the quest for someone provided they gather the ingredients<br/>
&gt; themselves.   For weeks i&#39;m gonna save up bonechips till I have about 300<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; go back to turn them in if the guy deals with me anymore.  Hell, i&#39;m not<br/>
even<br/>
&gt; sure if its worth 2000 plat for the hits anymore....<br/>
