<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you guys know that Boon of the 
Garou stacks with other illusions. I still hunt in Dreadlands at 48 so I need to 
be careful of the dragon Gone&#39;. I found if I cast Boon then cast illusion 
woodelf the dragon will see me as indifferent instead of kos. I still get the 
100 dex boost and proc lifetap but I look like and get the faction of a woodelf. 
Just thought I&#39;d toss that in. DON&#39;T pass that on to anyone else I don&#39;t want 
Verant to nerf that little trick... =)</font></div>

 size="4" FAMILY="SANSSERIF">Hi everyone, <br>&nbsp;I am in the process of 
  attempting to start my epic quest. (again) When I <br>created Galadriana, I 
  was pretty much clueless about what religion I should <br>pick and so forth. I 
  for some reason chose Rodcet Nife, well what a mistake <br>THAT was. I cast 
  illusion drybone on myself.. but the spec&#39;s killed me <br>because of my god.. 
  next time I casted improved invis on myself and got thru <br>everything 
  &nbsp;including the spec&#39;s BUT &nbsp;as soon as I cast collaboration on 
  <br>reania the other guild masters instantly killed me, because of my 
  religion. <br>&nbsp;I am currently working on the crate quest in qeynos to up 
  my faction with <br>opaldarkbriar, and I&#39;ve smacked old Neclo Rheslar in west 
  karana several <br>times too. (opal is the necro guildmaster under freeport) . 
  Does anyone have <br>any tips or hints or any suggestions as to what I can do 
  that could help me <br>start this part of my epic so i dont get killed every 
  single time?? <br><br>thanks, <br>Galadriana Dimystic <br>level 52
