&gt;in groups and should not be used at all.  Other classes are much more<br/>
&gt;effective at dealing damage, mana and otherwise.  Keep in mind we are<br/>
&gt;not damage dealers but crowd control.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I mildly disagree that our DD&#39;s are not usefull in a group. Im not saying<br/>
im a nuke happy enchanter, I know what my job is;  buffing, debuffing and<br/>
mezzing =) . There is no bigger thrill for me than pulling my party through<br/>
an &quot;imposible&quot;  pull with skillfull mezzing and hearing them say &quot;You<br/>
ROCK!&quot;. However there are times in a group when your crowd control abilities<br/>
are not needed. If  your loaded with mana and a mob is getting low on health<br/>
why not toss a nuke in there to hurry things along? Other classes are more<br/>
efficient at DD of course but often arent present in my groups, we tend to<br/>
be pretty melee oriented.  Use ALL of your abilities and stay flexible =)<br/>
