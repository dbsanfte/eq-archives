<div id="ygrps-yiv-510601866">speaking of spell line ups, I have different line ups for everything i do.<br/>
<br/>
I have a line up for soloing easy green dungeons,<br/>
a line up for soloing hard dungeons/seafuries/etc<br/>
a line up for going on giant raids<br/>
a line up for doing kedge<br/>
a line up for the planes<br/>
and a line up for grouping in a normal party<br/>
<br/>
One key spell that wasnt mentioned in the list offered was the color series.<br/>
These things can be life savers. Having 2+ stuns memd can keep a group of<br/>
MoBs stunned for an entire fight without swinging once. This is a mana<br/>
costly tactic and not good for steady pulling, but when used with good<br/>
judgement can be extremely effective.<br/>
<br/>
in some cases these line ups are drastically different, <br/>
learn what works best as an enchanter in which situation,<br/>
and change out spells depending on group makeup, i.e.<br/>
if a shaman is in the party he will most likely be doing Togors, so ditch<br/>
that slow spell. <br/>

I tried to complete this quest this weekend and didn&#39;t have the faction for<br/>
it.  Not even with Illusion Troll and benevolence.  I tried handing in<br/>
Lumpkin&#39;s head and the bracers anyway, but got the &quot;Do more for Troll<br/>
Shadowknights blah blah blah&quot;  Maybe if I did the bone chips a few times...<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, Ratraz was about level 20 or so, but can hit fairly hard (30&#39;s<br/>
and 40&#39;s with a few double attacks).  He would usually drop a few gold, his<br/>
Warclub, the Bracers, his head, and sometimes another random item like a<br/>
silver ring or a research page.  Lumpkin dropped his head and a rusty<br/>
halbard.  I only killed him once.  Faction hits for Ratraz are much easier<br/>
to repair than for Lumpkin.  Ratraz is Dread Guard Inner, Dread Guard outer,<br/>
and Dark Bargainers.  All three of which can be repaired by giving the<br/>
scribe in the library red wine.  Lumpkin was Foreign Quarter Trolls.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never seen a way to increase that faction.  Good thing about Ratraz is that<br/>
his warclub is a pretty good 1H blunt (6 damage 32 delay), looks different,<br/>
and sells to vendors for around 5+ plat.  For 5 plat you can buy a lot of<br/>
red wine if you catch my meaning.<br/>

Blur is definitely a good thing, even at level 50. <br/>
It&#39;s a &#39;get out of jail free&#39; card.  (Do people play<br/>
monopoly anymore?)<br/>
<br/>
While I use different spells in the planes (buff and<br/>
charm), here is my usual lineup.  it has not changed,<br/>
other than upgrades to similar spells, from level 30<br/>
to 50.  I always use them in the same order, so I know<br/>
where to find things.<br/>
<br/>
1 Memory Blur<br/>
2 Tepid Deeds, or whatever your best slow spell is<br/>
3 Chaos FLux, Anarchy... whatever your DD spell is<br/>
4 Root  (best one again)<br/>
5 mesmerize, enthrall, etc.<br/>
6 tashan (i, ia)<br/>
7 mesmerization  (area effect, and yes I have both)<br/>
8 utility...  rotates for buffs.  can be charm or rune<br/>
during combat.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; Which is why I also have memory<br/>
&gt; &gt; blur up at all times.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cast that and usually it will forget you... very<br/>
&gt; &gt; rarely Ill have to cast it 2X<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can any of you advise on good tactics for using<br/>
&gt; Memory<br/>
&gt; Blur? I am level 12 enchantress and have not found<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; that useful. It seems with so many spells and so few<br/>
&gt; slots, there is always another spell i can use more.<br/>
&gt; But seeing a high level enchanter has it memorized<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; all times makes me wonder. So, what are good uses<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; Memory Blur? Thanks :)<br/>

Memory Blur is amazing. I too keep it on hand at all times, Ive even been<br/>
able to memblur a sand giant while it was hitting and watched him forget who<br/>
I was and start waltzing the other direction... whew.<br/>
<br/>
I use it all the time while invising to places that see thru invis, running<br/>
thru lower guk, urd shaman sees me breaks invis and starts beating on me.<br/>
Mes...Memblur, memblur again, continue on way.<br/>
<br/>
Memblur does not always work %100. It works the same way as the monk feign I<br/>
believe. 35 mobs and under works all the time, above that has some chance of<br/>
resistability. Ive thought about replacing it with reocc amnesia, but the<br/>
recast on that is horrendous.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that these spells are aggro spells if they are resisted, so if you<br/>
ae mindwipe a group, dont think they wont come after you. We had an<br/>
enchanter try to attempt this in Hateplane, only to find he was beat to a<br/>
pulp.<br/>
<br/>
Memblur also saves the enchanter, when tashania/tepid deeds at the beginning<br/>
mobs get really angry and unless you have an incredible taunter theyll come<br/>
for you. Memblur and they will go back to the tank. Also while fighting<br/>
multiples I always mes/tashania/tepid deeds, then cast memblur a few times<br/>
on the mob and hell usually never come after you.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you keep a mob mes&#39;d for a long time cause the battle has gone a<br/>
long time, youll be up on his &quot;to kill&quot; list, so make sure mem blur at least<br/>
once after a warrior hits it to break mes. This is mandatory in places like<br/>
Hateplane and Fearplane, and helps a lot in lower guk as well.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Im looking into that stun breaking mes thing, I did a test and it seemed<br/>
like it didnt break it, but i could swear Ive broken it before with stuns in<br/>
L Guk.<br/>
Ill keep tryin.<br/>
