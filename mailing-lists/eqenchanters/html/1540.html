<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542908812">Okay, I&#39;m replying to this before reading the rest of the digest, or<br/>
admittedly, even this whole message.  However, I KNOW I have something<br/>
to say on this.<br/>
<br/>
I wish to preface this reply.  I&#39;m a 20th level Enchanter, after a<br/>
marathon session last weekend(made 2 levels).  I&#39;ve done quite well with<br/>
jewelcraft, and as much as it hasn&#39;t made me rich, it HAS allowed me to<br/>
always have the money I need, and to continue with my trade.  I&#39;m never<br/>
wanting for funds, even when I have to lay out 20 or 30 platinum for<br/>
cat&#39;s eye agates for that damn Rune spell, which is GREAT when cast<br/>
repeatedly on your tank.  Makes red creatures a cinch, usually.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on the E&#39;Ci server, and my name&#39;s Lotwilla.  I&#39;ve seen the trend in<br/>
jewel-craft devaluation, and taken some steps to remedy it.  Every<br/>
Sunday at 3 PM PST, I gather as many enchanters as possible, and we have<br/>
meetings in Freeport to discuss our trade, pricing, and how to make a<br/>
profit at it.  So far, I&#39;ve reached in the neighborhood of 30<br/>
enchanters, and all have agreed to take steps to see that our trade does<br/>
not go sour.  Freeport is easy to reach from just about anywhere, and<br/>
the tunnels make a GREAT meeting place for all enchanters, including our<br/>
dark-elf peers that can&#39;t walk brazenly into every place in the city. <br/>
I&#39;ll address things below.  Also, sorry if this message is long, but I&#39;m<br/>
a bit long-winded.<br/>
 <br/>
The prices that I encourage to those who attend the meetings are as<br/>
follows.  8 plat for all silver items that are less than jade, 10<br/>
platinum for jade rings, and on up from there.  Usually at least double<br/>
the cost of the materials, if not more.  Electrum, 15 platinum for items<br/>
up to jade, 20 platinum for jade and topaz, and on up.  I haven&#39;t gotten<br/>
into pricing for gold, as there is already a set amount for it.  On our<br/>
server, they seem to go for 30 per item, or 50 for a pair.  Honestly,<br/>
I&#39;d like to see the discount for a pair go away.  There&#39;s no reason for<br/>
it.  Anyone willing to shell out 50 platinum is just as willing to shell<br/>
out 60.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wish that price-lists and standardized pricing really worked, but no<br/>
&gt; matter how hard we try, it doesn&#39;t have much chance of succeeding.  Why?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Enchanter Jerks - For whatever reason, there are those who insist on<br/>
&gt; ruining jewelcraft for the rest of us by charging little or nothing for<br/>
&gt; their wares or by undercutting us at every turn. These false enchanters are<br/>
&gt; just interested in earning a quick buck, not in jewelry as a long-term and<br/>
&gt; useful skill.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Honestly, you often cannot deal with these people.  I&#39;ve found that a<br/>
little education goes a long way, but when someone is stubborn, you just<br/>
hope that one or a dozen people aren&#39;t enough to ruin it for everyone. <br/>
Where I run into problems is the higher-level enchanters selling simple<br/>
items too cheap.  I sell my jaded electrum bracelets for 20 platinum. <br/>
The &quot;heavy hitters&quot; on our server sell them for 15.  This makes it hard<br/>
for me to make as much of a profit.  What I&#39;ve tried to express is that<br/>
we&#39;re not selling the materials, but our skills.  Unfortunately, I&#39;ve<br/>
met with little success thus far, so I just keep plugging along.  And a<br/>
bit of encouragement, I still have little problem selling for good<br/>
prices.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) Market Flooding - Even on Prexus (a fairly new server) the silver market<br/>
&gt; is already totally flooded.  People don&#39;t know or don&#39;t care about the money<br/>
&gt; you sink into the skill, they have seen on other servers or on the current<br/>
&gt; servers that the prices are low to the ground and refuse to pay a reasonable<br/>
&gt; amount for silver.  If we try to save the market, it will have to be for<br/>
&gt; electrum or higher.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sadly, this will not change.  Silver items are cheap, and easy to<br/>
craft.  Therefore, all enchanters will just have to work through this. <br/>
Luckily, the target market of levels 8 to about 15 level is plentiful,<br/>
and so fairly easy to sell to.  I find myself selling very few silver<br/>
items, however, and often refer people to lower level enchanters who I<br/>
know are trying to make a profit at the craft.  I&#39;ve even given<br/>
customers money so they could afford to buy items from younger<br/>
enchanters at reasonable prices.  This does 2 things.  It encourages the<br/>
younter enchanters to sell for good prices, and shows the people that I<br/>
give the money to that it is a very important issue.  I&#39;ve had nothing<br/>
but positive results from this method, and a few platinum here and there<br/>
really doesn&#39;t touch my bank account.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) Non-Enchanter Items - It&#39;s even more frustrating to be undercut by a<br/>
&gt; non-enchanter selling a similar loot item for no money.   They paid nothing<br/>
&gt; to get it and can undercut us any day of the week.  Given the option of<br/>
&gt; paying 7-8 plat for an enchanter-made intelligence ring or 5-6 plat for a<br/>
&gt; similar loot item with an extra armor class bonus, who will choose the<br/>
&gt; former? (example:  +3 charisma necklace - a couple plat to make if no<br/>
&gt; failures versus a doll that does the same thing - 7 gold to buy or free to<br/>
&gt; loot).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The factor here is the slot that you use.  I know of no ring items that<br/>
give plus 2 intelligence.  The key here is to know your market, and know<br/>
what to sell to people.  On this note, I don&#39;t use the auction channel,<br/>
except to get attention.  I never quote prices over auction, and ALWAYS<br/>
sell TO people that I find, offering them items that will best suit<br/>
them.  In addition, I&#39;m not afraid to tell someone that they&#39;re better<br/>
off with something else if, in fact, they are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4) We can&#39;t make what they want - True, some jewelry (int, str, mana, etc)<br/>
&gt; sells decently.  But, so many more want mana earrings or intelligence<br/>
&gt; bracers or whatever that will never be an option for us.  (&quot;What earrings do<br/>
&gt; you have?&quot; &quot;Only Stamina ones&quot; &quot;Oh, sorry, I need _____ ones&quot;).  Then, they<br/>
&gt; go off in search of the loot item that will give them what they need.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At least half of the time, if someone is looking to buy something, you<br/>
can sell them something else that will be as useful to them.  Consider<br/>
what you CAN make, and offer them the best you can.  Once again, though,<br/>
you have to know when you should not waste your time, and when you have<br/>
to walk away from a potential sale.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does this mean we shouldn&#39;t try?  Of course not, but don&#39;t expect a miracle<br/>
&gt; because we set the price for jade mana rings at say 10 pp per ring<br/>
&gt; throughout the servers.  We need to educate people ... maybe a seminar or<br/>
&gt; something where we all get together and sell our wares at the standard price<br/>
&gt; and try to let the populace know why we sell them for that much and how the<br/>
&gt; +2s and such all add up to help them out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We can do this by educating ourselves.  You&#39;re never going to educate<br/>
everyone on a server, but you can sure touch a good number of<br/>
enchanters, and if you get the ones you touch educating other people,<br/>
the effect will be exponential.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not interested in making a whole lot of money with jewelcraft (that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what my brewing skill is for), but I do want to make enough money to be able<br/>
&gt; to raise my skill.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I sure am, and I do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For those of you who can easily sell items for what they are worth ...<br/>
&gt; perhaps you can give a seminar to those of us who keep finding ourselves<br/>
&gt; with unsellable product and dozens of tells from people who find out the<br/>
&gt; price we charge and either say they don&#39;t have enough money or run away from<br/>
&gt; us laughing to their nearest loot monster.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am known to spend a half hour with a client, and that is how I think<br/>
of them, consulting with them on what they need.  Often, this will lead<br/>
to sales of at least 30 platinum, on up to over 100.  In addition, I<br/>
offer a ten percent commission to ANYONE who brings me business. <br/>
Finally, I make sure people will come back to me when they need<br/>
something new.  You&#39;re never going to sell to everyone, but you can sure<br/>
make a tidy bit if you make the effort to establish a client base.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We can save electrum if we start now.  Don&#39;t be discouraged, we just need to<br/>
&gt; teach people the worth of our products and come up with a valid reason for<br/>
&gt; them to buy at our prices.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Any time someone asks me &quot;Why do you charge so much?&quot;, I inform them of<br/>
two things.  Many items we make are unique to our craft, and are hard to<br/>
find, and that I&#39;ve spent well over 900 platinum on improving my skill<br/>
to the point where I can make what I do.  Some people don&#39;t get it.  I<br/>
let them walk away.  More often, people shell out the cash, and come<br/>
back for more later.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thanks for listening<br/>
&gt; Dietrich (Prexus server)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You didn&#39;t address one major issue: enchanters enchanting metal for<br/>
non-enchanters.  I do NOT do this.  I&#39;ve done it twice in the past, and<br/>
it would take very certain circumstances for me to do it again.  One<br/>
time was for a friend of mine, who paid me extremely well for 100 silver<br/>
bars.  The other time, I enchanted one silver bar, and charged a<br/>
platinum for the spell.  In my opinion, metals should not be enchanted<br/>
unless you are charging at least double the price of the metal bar you<br/>
are enchanting FOR THE SPELL ALONE.  Nobody else can do it, and if this<br/>
strategy is adopted, it makes it difficult for other classes to be<br/>
competetive with us.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve had enough, if you even bothered to read this<br/>
far.  Thanks for your time!<br/>
