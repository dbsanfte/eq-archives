<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718381433">Ok I&#39;ve read a lot of things about protesting for the Enchanter&#39;s<br/>
cause...lots of ideas on how to protest but shouldn&#39;t we come up with a list<br/>
of balance issues that we can send to Verant.<br/>
The main issue seems to be the resistibility of our spells. Here is what I<br/>
think. All our spells are tested against Magic Resistance where other<br/>
classes spells are tested against Fire or Cold Resistance. If you are in<br/>
Lavastorm Mountain, all your fire based spell wont even harm a green<br/>
creature. So the trade off is that our spells can affect creatures of any<br/>
kind. The problem is that most of the magic-users get an extremely good MR<br/>
due to spells. Another problem is the fact that our damage spells dont do<br/>
any damage when resisted. Right now, our spells are almost never resisted by<br/>
greens, rarely by blues, rarely by whites ( although I could not cast a<br/>
single spell on Dorn when he was white to me ), sometimes resisted by<br/>
yellows, resisted 20-30% of the time by the reds that are one level above<br/>
yellows and resisted 100% by all other reds.<br/>
Here is my list of suggestions:<br/>
1) Damage spells should at least do some damage when resisted following<br/>
similar rules as the wizard spells with a lesser ratio maybe to keep a<br/>
balance with those easy-to-kill wizards,<br/>
2) Our spells should not jump from a 20-30% resistance to a full 100%<br/>
resistance, there should be a nicer ramp so that an enchanter is not<br/>
completely useless in a group of 6 people attacking one strong red target.<br/>
<br/>
I dont have other suggestions because I personnaly think that enchanter is a<br/>
very strong class. I have an enchanter level 16 now and I had a necro level<br/>
16 before and my enchanter is almost as good in solo ( nothing can beat the<br/>
triple dots+feign death+let pet finish the critter combo of the necro ), and<br/>
much much better ( much more useful would be the word ) in groups. I am just<br/>
annoyed that sometimes I have to watch my friends kill reds for me while I<br/>
cant even cast a spell to help except buffs.<br/>

I agree, I think that we should all assemble on one day, in one area. Then<br/>
we <br/>
petition for a GM. While we wait, we send alot of FEEDBACK reports, asking <br/>
Verant to finally balance the enchanter. When the GM comes, he/she will see <br/>
that we are serious (hopefully). Tell me what you think.<br/>
