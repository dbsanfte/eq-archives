 </span></blockquote>Using lull/soothe/calm as an enchanter (and seeing a cleric try to use<br/>
them) and calm/rest the dead as a necro, I&#39;ve never had good consistent<br/>
results.  They seem to be suicide spells designed to pull an entire camp<br/>
fairly often.<br/>
<br/>
Consensus among people I group with is that this line of spells is<br/>
near-useless.  Both bard lament and druid/ranger harmony work very well,<br/>
however.  The difference seems to be the type of resist (lament and<br/>
harmony are never or almost never resisted), amount of aggression<br/>
reduction (lament and harmony reduce aggro range to 0 so you can pull<br/>
past/walk by the target and be safe, lull/rest/etc just reduce the range a<br/>
small amount), and what happens on a resist (lament and harmony let you<br/>
recast, lull/rest/etc aggro the mob). Oh, and harmony is (small) AE so you<br/>
can use it around some corners.  Dunno about lament.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, if you need to break a camp where the critters are close<br/>
together, use mez and memblur, or get a bard, druid, or ranger to do<br/>
it while you take care of any messes if they fail.<br/>

&gt; farthest away fist. If an agro mob runs past on the has been soothed the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It will work occasionially, especially if the mobs aren&#39;t close together.<br/>
But it fails often enough (and pulls the whole camp on a resist) that it&#39;s<br/>
safer to use mez.  IMO at least.<br/>
