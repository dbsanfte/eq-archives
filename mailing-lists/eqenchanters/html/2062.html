<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817201475">did you ever try to use it? it was the level 12 enchanter charm spell that<br/>
necros got at 24. that spell couldnt be used to charm any MOB over level<br/>
25. if you cast the spell on a mob over 25, you got a message saying you<br/>
cant do it with this spell. by the time you got the spell at 24, it&#39;s<br/>
useless considering the other spells you got.<br/>
<br/>
and i get sick of necros complaining about how they get resisted just like<br/>
everyone else now. life tap gets resisted now. good. necros were too<br/>
powerful with life tap almost always sticking and being able to kite. now<br/>
they get resisted just like wizzies and mages. i&#39;ve played all 4, and even<br/>
NOW my enchanter STILL gets resisted more.<br/>

&gt;Why was the charm spell useless for Necro&#39;s?∩┐╜ it worked the same as the<br/>
&gt;enchanters, right?∩┐╜ Necro&#39;s over the last couple months have gotten hammered<br/>
&gt;big time.∩┐╜ The charm and fear nerf changes nothing in non PVP∩┐╜situations<br/>
&gt;(which probably counts for 95% of the time).∩┐╜ My necro would be very happy<br/>
&gt;if his DOT&#39;s worked corectly in non PVP, or his life suck, or his Pet, or<br/>
&gt;Feign Death.∩┐╜ Be thankful.<br/>
