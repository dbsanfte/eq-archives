First off, loved the stats and their apparent LACK of enchanter data...<br/>
still, nicely put out there.  As far as enchanters being a solo class, EVERY<br/>
class is a solo class until level 10ish.  After that, being an enchanter is<br/>
HARD work!  The most important thing about these hard levels is that you<br/>
learn to play an enchanter... no other class requires as much learning as<br/>
ours (IMHO).  For god sakes, get into a GROUP during these levels!  But for<br/>
solo... I didnt really notice the solo-ability of being an enchanter until I<br/>
was about level 38 or so, at which point I realized we can solo like no<br/>
other class.  We dont have to kite, ensnare, fear, or root... we have the<br/>
mesmerize line and the charm line.  These 2 spell disciplines are all we<br/>
need to solo, and solo extremely well!  I dont know if you read one of<br/>
Smed&#39;s recent posts about watching an enchanter solo 5 spectres, but that<br/>
could have been me.  I&#39;ll tell you my strategy for that, if you ask nicely<br/>
:)  Its fun AND easy!<br/>
<br/>
And really... what other class can make a pet that hits for over 100?  well,<br/>
bard I guess but I wouldnt want to be near THAT.<br/>
