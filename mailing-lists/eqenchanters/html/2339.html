<div id="ygrps-yiv-538904997">Couple shots in the arm today if you didnt notice. Read first on EQvault but<br/>
copied from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a> :)  Personally I find most<br/>
interesting the change to &#39;DDD&#39;.  It shall be interesting to see if this<br/>
spell makes its way back into peoples hotkey bank... imho it seems like more<br/>
of a PvP spell now (mana drain on Mobs?  whats the point?)<br/>
<br/>
yup nothing &#39;nerfed&#39; though, unless you were really attatched to &#39;sense<br/>
magic&#39;<br/>

<br/>
- Mana costs for enchanting metals has been reduced.<br/>
- Dyn&#39;s Dizzying Draught has been altered slightly. It now reduces AC,<br/>
Agility, and drains mana as well as spinning the target.<br/>
- Blanket of Forgetfullness has received a minor upgrade.<br/>
- &quot;Reoccurring Amnesia&quot; has had its casting time reduced.<br/>
- &quot;Yaulp&quot; and &quot;Augmentation&quot; should now stack.<br/>
- &quot;Sense Magic&quot; has been replaced in all cases by the &quot;True North&quot; spell. If<br/>
you have already inscribed the &quot;Sense Magic&quot; spell, the spell icon will now<br/>
automatically reflect &quot;True North&quot;.</div>
