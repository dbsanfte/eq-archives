<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368241450">I just tried to enchant some jewelery and was disapointed. I thought <br/>
all gems would create some type of magic item when combined with an <br/>
enchanted bar of metal. <br/>
 I would like to see which gems you have used to create magic items <br/>
and the effect produced.  Also, the different strenghts afforded to <br/>
by the type of metal used in the construction.  Even a suggested <br/>
retail price. <br/>
