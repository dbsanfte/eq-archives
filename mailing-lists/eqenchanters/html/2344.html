<div id="ygrps-yiv-912357489">Certain MOBS that take a long time to take down and are hard to interupt really<br/>
benefit from reducing their mana pool.  The only MOB that I&#39;m taking about here<br/>
is Vox.  Her channelling skill is so high now that even with 18-20 tanks<br/>
bashing/slamming/kicking and mauling her flesh, she will still get a 10 second<br/>
casting time complete heal off that a level 50 cleric sometimes get interupted<br/>
when he/she gets bumped by players pets.  If you can get 3 or so enchanters<br/>
using mana sieve on her. she&#39;ll only get one Complete Heal off- otehrwise.......<br/>
not a prestty site.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that - it&#39;s a PvP oriented spell.  I think the upgrades were meant to<br/>
help the Zek server enchanters after charm/fear were removed.<br/>
<br/>
PRevious post:<br/>
Personally I find most interesting the change to &#39;DDD&#39;.  It shall be interesting<br/>
to see if this spell makes its way back into peoples hotkey bank... imho it<br/>
seems like more of a PvP spell now (mana drain on Mobs?  whats the point?)</div>
