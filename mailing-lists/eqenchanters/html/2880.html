<div id="ygrps-yiv-96350797">Here are my opinions on the enchanter in PvP<br/>
<br/>
First of all, you will be better off to not have a pet at all, as for us,<br/>
the battle is won or lost in the first 10 seconds (Lead with tash/enthrall).<br/>
Our pets do attack the other person as soon as we are hit.  Charm is out<br/>
except in the arenas (I believe, we dont do much arena PvP on Rallos), but<br/>
charmed pets are quite a bit superior to our own pets in every way except<br/>
for loyalty.  I still remember the time a +3 level druid attacked me in the<br/>
oasis while I was fighting a hill giant.... a miraculously successful charm<br/>
on the HG completely caught him off guard and after rooting him to take the<br/>
abuse he was short work. *grin*<br/>
<br/>
If you have the luxury of selecting your spells before a duel, it will be<br/>
dependant on who you are duelling.  For example, if you are fighting a melee<br/>
type you will want to use our weakness/disempower/suffocation spells as they<br/>
will quickly make your opponent overweight and quite slow moving... a wizard<br/>
on the other hand would be in a bit of trouble if you mem your early DD<br/>
spells (fast cast and spell interrupting) with mana seive to make sure they<br/>
dont have enough mana to finish you off.  A good strategy with casters is<br/>
tash/quickDD/mez/slowDD/quickDD/mez/slowDD/quickDD/mez/ect.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, rune, shade, and your personal armour as well as your +cha buff<br/>
(augmentation doesnt hurt also, a little extra ac).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how our slowing spells (tepid deeds ect) work with casters but,<br/>
when applied to a melee, prove to be quite effective.  Blinding spells are<br/>
pretty inneffective as most classes have their crucial attack spells<br/>
hotkeyed, but its a good way to confuse a melee and get a few steps away<br/>
from them... but very resistable.  Another useful series are our color flux<br/>
line, good for interrupting casters as well.<br/>
<br/>
As an extra note, if you happen to have the rod of insidious glamour, its<br/>
effect (alliance) can be chain cast on your opponent to give them quite a<br/>
headache (read:LAG) and give you an opportunity to get away... just dont<br/>
look into the light and you will be all right.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering what some enchanter strategies are when dueling on a non-PvP<br/>
&gt; server (like Povar).  What have you found that works and what doesn&#39;t<br/>
work?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know charm is out but how bout some other spells?<br/>
&gt; Do our pets attack the other person once we have been hit?<br/>
&gt; Do charmed pets work better (at all)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks for your views,<br/>
&gt; Shawn<br/>
