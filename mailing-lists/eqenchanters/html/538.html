<div id="ygrps-yiv-940932285">I posted a message yesterday, but have yet to see a response.<br/>
Does anyone know what creatures we need to be fighting to <br/>
find the pages for our research? Someone posted which pages<br/>
combine to make what spell, but didn&#39;t mention how to get them.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure we are all eagerly awaiting this info...</div>
