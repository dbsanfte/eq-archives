Yes I have learned for a long time that as enchanters we don&#39;t need root.<br/>
Mes is the way to go. It&#39;s faster, more reliant, and lasts longer. If a mob<br/>
is running for friends, mes will stop em dead in their tracks.<br/>
<br/>
Another alternative to the dd/stun/mes/dd/stun/mes nuke combo is<br/>
mes/tashania/tepid(shiftless)/dd/mes/dd/mes/dd/mes/dd<br/>
<br/>
tepid has been a lifesaver for me many times, especially those times when we<br/>
took on 2 frenzies and a bloodthirsty. I don&#39;t always tepid for the tanks, I<br/>
do it when they need the help. But If I&#39;m the only one aggroed on a<br/>
potentially dangerous mob (entrance/tashania will do it), that mob is gonna<br/>
get tepid. When and if they break mes, Ive got a 60+ delay mob that will<br/>
never interrupt my 2.5 casting time :)<br/>

btw I went to paw yesterday, and I seriously do not recommend 35ish-40ish<br/>
parties in the old Ren Rex area. There are enchanter mobs all over the place<br/>
just waiting to charm. Turned our level 50 tank on us a couple times. But<br/>
Paw is not as bad as I gathered from the posts, we cleared the entire<br/>
dungeon with 50sk, 48enc, 35wiz, 50cleric, 50cleric, and it was extremely<br/>
easy.<br/>
<br/>
And for those of you who ever used the water as an escape from Lenrils spot,<br/>
<br/>
it has been modified. Them damn snakes will attack you under there, by the<br/>
time our party surfaced we had 3 snakes aggroed on us.<br/>

&gt;Easy way to solo even the Ghoul Magi is to buff a pet up then just cycle<br/>
&gt;stuns while the pet rips a new one into the mob...<br/>

&gt;Just make sure the target is all on their own.<br/>
