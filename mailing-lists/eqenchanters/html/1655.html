<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766533099">If you are making jewelry with the higher stones to fill a demand for the<br/>
items, then by all means, continue to do so. If you are crafting items<br/>
merely for the skill gain involved you are better off starting electrum in<br/>
the high 30&#39;s. Even though the fail rate is slightly higher, the cost of<br/>
failing an electrum/malachite bracer is 2p 7g, while the cost of failing a<br/>
silver/pearl ring is 5p 3g. You will be failing the electrum/malachite more<br/>
often, but not twice as often as the silver/pearl. The cost disparity only<br/>
gets greater as you climb up the stone ladder with silver...<br/>

&gt; and more money back from NPCs by doing it this way, plus my guildmembers<br/>
&gt; like those +disease/+ac necklaces :).  I love the thrill of making truly<br/>
&gt; new jewelry with gems I&#39;ve never worked with before (and probably won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; again).  Only four stinkin&#39; levels to go before I can enchant electrum :(<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Truthfully you should have started with electrum/malachite as soon<br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; silver/jade was trivial. At a skill of 38 I had about a 50% success rate <br/>
&gt; with electrum/malachite which was cheaper than a 70% success rate with <br/>
&gt; silver/pearl. You can continue with electrum/malachite all the way to the <br/>
&gt; mid 70&#39;s. <br/>
