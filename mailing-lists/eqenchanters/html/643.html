Oh yes, you can be chamed by a mob, happened to me earlier tonight. Lasted<br/>
for a VERY long time, I killed two people in my group, and when the mob<br/>
reset, it reset me with it, standing next to em. Now, the good news is the<br/>
effect wears off slowly, the icon showing you are charmed is still there<br/>
but you can slowing turn about, then moments later move about. I got aways<br/>
from the mob before it finally completly broke.  Oh and yes, my friends did<br/>
lose exp for me killing them.<br/>
