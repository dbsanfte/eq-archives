<div id="ygrps-yiv-153308921">Enchanters more so than any other class have so many options to choose from<br/>
depending on the situation that different spell lineups are needed for each<br/>
situation. Am I breaking up a spawn? Am I in a situation where trains will<br/>
have to be dealt with or are we off the tracks? Are we outdoors taking on<br/>
one solo creature? Other classes pretty much keep the same spells memorized<br/>
no matter what the situation. We can do different things depending on the<br/>
situation, and have a variety of spells to choose from to do so. There are<br/>
situations where 8 spell slots just don&#39;t seem to be enough and I find<br/>
myself constantly switching out spells.<br/>
<br/>
One situation that hasn&#39;t been mentioned is PvP. Many of our spells while<br/>
seeming useless against critters you usually fight, are quite strong in a<br/>
PvP environment. Whenever travelling on Vallon Zek in non-friendly areas<br/>
(and us enchanters are the one class on the PvP-Teams server that MUST do<br/>
this) or going out to PK, I find myself using completely different spells<br/>
than usual combat. Some stay the same, but Strip Enchantments, for example,<br/>
is a must have for PvP. Low mana spell interrupting spells are also a must<br/>
have. Debuffs, while usually useless, can easily encumber a player, and<br/>
lower rank ones (which means less mana) are quite useful for this. Too bad<br/>
there is no fix for the abuses that charm can lead to, because when we could<br/>
charm PvP, we were not only the masters of PvP, but were rightfully feared.<br/>
