<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049307750">I have to agree in one area at least, my spells are resisted almost<br/>
always by &#39;tomb&#39; beasts, which seemed to me was the purpose of spells<br/>
like mesmerise and fear. Maybe I should try using the Tashan spell first<br/>
on red NPC&#39;s but in battle w/more than one that&#39;s a large use of time<br/>
and mana.</div>
