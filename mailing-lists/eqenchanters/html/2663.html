&gt; Yes it is possible. At 12lvl Last night I completed the Quest for<br/>
&gt; the Stine.  Clurg was indiferent to me and did not respond to my<br/>
&gt; hails so I held my breath and gave him the book anyway. And lo<br/>
&gt; and behold I got a stien.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;gate&gt; back to Freeport.  Appear and try to /auction the stine and<br/>
&gt; noone wanted to pay more than 100pp for it. That sounds too low<br/>
&gt; for me, so I was wondering if anyone has tried to sell them over<br/>
&gt; in Kel. Was thinking that maybe sence Kel was on another<br/>
&gt; contonet away from the quest I could get the 200pp for the stine<br/>
&gt; that I need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone else sold a stine lately?  is 200pp outragious? anyone<br/>
&gt; had luck selling the stine out side of Freeport/Commons?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keeping everyone up to date.<br/>
