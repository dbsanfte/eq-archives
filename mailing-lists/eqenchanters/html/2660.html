<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqenchanters] appropriate levels for Kunark <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-552379273">Something to remember about Kunark, there are areas appropriate for every<br/>
level.  As you work your way out from Cabilis in each adjoining zone the<br/>
area nearest the city is a newbie area and gets tougher the farther away you<br/>
get.<br/>
<br/>
So, for the purposes of faction adjustments, greenies in the newbie area are<br/>
doable from level 1.<br/>
<br/>
Hunting for experience should be fine for any level but I have personal<br/>
experience from mid teens on with a non Iksar character.  I&#39;ve leveled<br/>
quickly/easily through the upper teens and low twenties with my enchanter in<br/>
Lake of Ill Omen.  I&#39;ve leveled very quickly in the upper 20s with my<br/>
warrior in the lake and Swamp of No Hope.<br/>
<br/>
I think some people come to Kunark and hunt in the nightmare that is Firona<br/>
Vie (FV).  This zone is very dangerous (in my experience) and I&#39;m stressed<br/>
out when I spend much time in there.  My warrior at 26 was a quick bite for<br/>
most of the things zooming around in that zone and Verant got smart allowing<br/>
monsters to cruise around at the tops of the zone walls so there are few<br/>
safe spots.  It&#39;s a rewarding zone if you are in a good/tough group but<br/>
death is quick to come if you get in over your head.  Most things see<br/>
through invis and there are some really mean creatures that are very hard to<br/>
outrun.  Because of all this I think people get the idea all zones in Kunark<br/>
are the same.  But they aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The field of bone, warsilk woods, swamp of no hope, and lake of ill omen are<br/>
pretty nice and mostly quiet.  People who have the expansion but stay in<br/>
lake rathe, cazic thule, and especially oasis are missing out big time on<br/>
much nicer places.  Many times in the swamp of no hope I&#39;ve been the only<br/>
person or one of a handful (that I never ran into).  There are still fairly<br/>
easy blue things to my 28 warrior in the swamp.<br/>
<br/>
I like it not crowded but I&#39;d also like to see a few more people here and<br/>
there to group with.  If you are on Povar, have the expansion, and would<br/>
like help getting to Kunark and are in the level range of 18-30 I can talk<br/>
you to firona vie from oasis or butcher.  Non-evils can be bound in FV but<br/>
I&#39;m not familiar with how things work for evil races (other than knowing<br/>
they get bound in &quot;Overthere&quot;.  If you can bind yourself then no worries.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have not done this part with my enchanter yet as he is too low level to <br/>
&gt; enjoy Kunark.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This surprises me.  Kunark is a bit tough for teens and under (mostly due<br/>
to travel danger, as there are places that would be good once you get L12<br/>
and can bind), but once you&#39;re high enough level to even have<br/>
Illusion:Iksar, it&#39;s a fine place. I&#39;ve been having a blast killing<br/>
goblins, sarnaks, forest giants, brutes, cacti, etc. in the Overthere,<br/>
Warslik&#39;s Woods, and Lake of Ill Omen with my L25 necro.<br/>
