<div id="ygrps-yiv-460743865">Basically.  It looks that way from what I can see of the map.  Anyway,<br/>
just in case its off, here are brief directions.<br/>
<br/>
After entering from Kithicor, stick to the main path.  Now, when you get<br/>
to a bridge, DO NOT CROSS.  The path continues if you look to the right.<br/>
Eventually you will reach a Y.  You can see buildings to the right, you<br/>
want to go left into the mines.  Cross through and you should come out<br/>
in front of the keep.  In the mines, if I remember right, do not go<br/>
through the square opening, go the other way.<br/>
<br/>
This pretty much goes with what I see on the map.  Stay invised, do not<br/>
cross the bridge, and stay away from orcs and gnolls.  Its not that hard<br/>
to do.<br/>

So, I get to the keep by going through the guard house?<br/>
