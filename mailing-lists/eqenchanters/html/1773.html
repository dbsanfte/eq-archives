 &gt;     I&#39;m thinking this is a typo in your Subject line and you mean a Pearl<br/>
 &gt; Shard. The Pearl Shard is a Magician Spell Research item for some of their<br/>
 &gt; midlevel spells and I&#39;ve never heard of any jewelry being constructed from<br/>
 it.<br/>
 &gt;     If, however, you actually DO mean to ask about a Peral Shard, then<br/>
 I&#39;ve<br/>
 &gt; not the slightest idea having never used such personally. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    The Pearl Shard, Jade Shard, and Ice of Vellious are all items use for <br/>
Mage Research. Hmm, starting around the 20&#39;s if I remember right.<br/>
    As an Enchanter/Jeweler they haven&#39;t much use to you other then as trade <br/>
items for Enchanter Research Pages. You could sell it at low cost to a <br/>
merchant, but it works out much better when you trade something you got for <br/>
FREE for something that you would have to pay someone else for. Trading <br/>
Research Materials is like trading baseball cards, (or Magic Cards for the <br/>
younger set); you both got what the other wants cheap, you trade and both <br/>
walk away happy with no loss of money out of their pocket.<br/>
    So save those Words and Runes. Carry a couple with you in the field or in <br/>
town and every once in a while auction that you&#39;re looking to trade spell <br/>
research stuff with other classes. Never know when someone will kill a <br/>
critter that you didn&#39;t, but it had the page you need for that spell you&#39;ve <br/>
been hunting after for 4 weeks. </span></blockquote></div>
