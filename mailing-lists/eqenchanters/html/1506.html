level of visual equipment we get.. not that big a deal, but would be nice ;)<br/>

Subject: [eqenchanters] enchanter only robes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although I could by this point easily have an FBR or something of the sort,<br/>
I stick with my Gold Senior Apprentice robe, just because it&#39;s enchanter<br/>
only. Think of it as &#39;Enchanter Pride&#39;. I think that there should be some<br/>
decent enchanter only robes, which of course would be quest items, and no<br/>
trade/ no drop, and lore. This goes for the other spellcasting classes as<br/>
well.<br/>
