<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971716650">Qinie is right about the lvl 16 mesmerization.  It is<br/>
THE spell for enchanters.  Learn to use it well and<br/>
you will be a hero.  But it does not replace the<br/>
single mob mesmerize.  I always have both memorized. <br/>
Keep in mind that mesmerization will hit you too if<br/>
you are in the radius, so make sure you have someone<br/>
to watch your back or group gate you out.<br/>
<br/>
Up until the last patch I still used the level 4<br/>
version of mesmerize.  It cast fast and was not<br/>
resisted frequently.  Most importantly it only cost 20<br/>
mana.  YOu could chain cast on a bunch of things<br/>
almost indefinitely, with time to meditate between<br/>
casts.  Now that the higher level ones cast at the<br/>
same speed I am trying out the higher level ones. <br/>
Entrance works quite well and lasts more than one<br/>
minute.  I just got Dazzle (49) and have not yet been<br/>
able to decide if it is worth 125 mana.<br/>
<br/>
The first time you save your group from a massive<br/>
train with mesmerization, you are going to have an<br/>
instant fan club.  I get constant requests in game to<br/>
go help some group or other break the spawn in some<br/>
nasty place.  Most of the highest level camps are<br/>
extremely difficult to break in to without an<br/>
enchanter.  By level 29 (clarity) you will become a<br/>
much more popular party member.  Just be patient!<br/>
<br/>
As for general spell levels, yes, when you first get<br/>
new spells they are not very effective.  I generally<br/>
had to use the previous rank of spells for a couple<br/>
levels beyonf when I received the new ones.  But, in<br/>
general, the new spells are more mana efficient, so<br/>
once they are becoming effective, you should start<br/>
using them.  good luck!<br/>

&gt; As for your &#39;lower spells are better&#39; strategy, that<br/>
&gt; will hold true for a<br/>
&gt; while, but not forever. You will reach a point with<br/>
&gt; most of your lower level<br/>
&gt; spells where they will not be able to affect the<br/>
&gt; creature you are fighting.<br/>
&gt; For Charm and Mesmerize, I believe that limit is at<br/>
&gt; level 25, but don&#39;t hold<br/>
&gt; me to that. It DOES sound like you have a good start<br/>
&gt; into realizing what the<br/>
&gt; enchanter is about. It gets tiring reminding people<br/>
&gt; that we aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; wannabe-wizards. Safe hunting!<br/>
