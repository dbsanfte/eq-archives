<div id="ygrps-yiv-284283788"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;recently I tried 3 ingredient experiments though, I used cheap gems so I<br/>
&gt;would not waste the money that I do not have :)<br/>
&gt;I tried Silver with cheap gems, with pixie dust (I have like 20 pixie dust<br/>
&gt;so I figured why not) I figured pixie dust would work, cause you can<br/>
&gt;probably mix the dust into the metal but it did not work :(<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve got an idea, but it will take participation.  Perhaps we can each try<br/>
combinine 3 items one time, and this way we will get a wide spread of<br/>
materials.  Verant must have put 4 slots in the jewelers bag for some<br/>
reason...  weapons certainly dont fit in them so try anything... I have<br/>
tried bone chips (dont combine), bat wings (dont combine), and multiple<br/>
gems (never works).  I dont see what combining gems or metal with pelts<br/>
could do.  I may try a rusted blackbox next... also I was wondering if<br/>
there was any way of combining coins to perhaps make a bar of metal ,i.e. 4<br/>
banks filled with 20 cp each may produce a copper bar?  This doesnt really<br/>
sound valid as that many sp=8gp when they can be purchased for 5, but could<br/>
this be an untried idea?  let me know!<br/>
