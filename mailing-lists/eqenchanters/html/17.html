<div id="ygrps-yiv-862282254">the only problem with your way is that i think it doesnt take any skill or thought (not meaning no disrespect to you ).a part of the game is getting the spells with the char that needs it by using illision spells,ect. or buying from one that can get it .  probably my main problem is that reminds me too much of Ultima online and the game abuse that came so easly there .</div>
