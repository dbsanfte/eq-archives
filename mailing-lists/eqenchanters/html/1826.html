<div id="ygrps-yiv-457875609">I completed my Stein quest!!  I suffered a miserable death on the first<br/>
attempt, however...as the named Ogres (not Bouncers) did not care for my<br/>
choice of diety....<br/>
<br/>
I recommend staying invis until you reach Clurg....<br/>
<br/>
Benevolence is mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had at least a dozen requests to help people do this quest....<br/>
If I remember correctly, the Book is No Drop, right? so how can we help?<br/>
or is it just a Lore Item?<br/>
either way...I know the Stein is Lore...so we will not be able to get<br/>
another....right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has been able to assist others in this quest, what are you<br/>
charging?  50pp?  100pp?<br/>
