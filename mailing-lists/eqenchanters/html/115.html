<br/>
To anyone who may not already know this,<br/>
<br/>
    From my personal experience with Everquest I have found that the<br/>
economy works greatly in your favor.  When you purchase something at a<br/>
low level (suck as armor) you are not investing much since you can get<br/>
most of your money back by selling it.  <br/>
    Robes are different however.  After seeing the Gold Sr. Apprentice<br/>
Robe (I am an Enchanter), I decided I really needed it.  After long hours<br/>
of work I had finally saved up the five platinum to purchase it. So I did.<br/>
    Unfortunately, I hadn&#39;t observed the asterisk next to it which means<br/>
it can&#39;t be dropped, traded or sold.  I was informed of this asterisk by<br/>
a GM after complaining i couldn&#39;t get any money out of it.<br/>
    I wanted to take a trip to High Hold Pass but didn&#39;t want to risk<br/>
anything.  So... I through all of my equipment into my bank account.  But<br/>
wait, I can&#39;t put my 5 platinum robe in there.  Which brings up a good<br/>
question.  Why can&#39;t you drop non-dropable items in your bank account. <br/>
No one else can access it anyway.  I have not yet found better chest<br/>
protection but when I do the value of my Sr. Apprentice Robe will have<br/>
gone from 5 platinum to 0 copper.  <br/>
    So in conclusion I would suggest to avoid buying robes at all<br/>
possible cost.  They have no value once in your hands and you can&#39;t even<br/>
store them away for a rainy day. <br/>
     On a side note my brother, a wizard, bought a Sr. Apprentice Robe<br/>
and when he tried to put his guild robe in the bank he remembered as the<br/>
the screen read &quot;This item cannot be dropped, traded or sold.&quot; So he<br/>
destroyed it only to find out he was still wearing his guild tunic.  <br/>
     Thanks for your time.  Any feedback is welcome,<br/>

P.S.  Please excuse the poor writing skills.  I have chose to invest my<br/>
points in other areas.</div>
