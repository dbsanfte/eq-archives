<div id="ygrps-yiv-250061780">Thank you every one for your input on jewelery<br/>
prices.  I wish I could get prices like Rallos Zek<br/>
on Karana.  I have trouble getting 5pp for int rings<br/>
and 7pp for Jaded silver.   I seen a Jaded silver<br/>
for sale by a NPC merchant and the price was close<br/>
to 14 or 15 pp.  I think we should be able to match<br/>
NPC prices pretty close, but on Karana, everyone<br/>
wants really cheap stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to recover your failed attempts this way.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder if we can do anything about this.  Any ideas<br/>
Karana players?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks agian for all your ideas and input on the trade.<br/>
<br/>
