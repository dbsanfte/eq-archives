<p><font SIZE="2">Specialization: Alteration. It will save you in the long run. Just check thru eqcasters, and how many spells are alteratioin. Speed buffs are alteration and will save you huge amounts of mana when you have to cast these a lot. Clarity is also Alteration, as is many other buffs that I use: Adorning Grace, Augmentation. You want to do some damage instead of just being mes/buff guy? Now you can use Grasping Embrace if you want, because it will not cost the full 200 damage as all enc dots are Alteration. They lowered the cost of enchant spells, but its still a time saver when making a lot of plat jewellry to specialize in alteration.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="2">And with pets, they take most weapons except 2 handers. I used to give my pet fs spears, but apparently that doesnt seem to work anymore. But maces, warhammers, broadswords, longswords, daggers, snake fangs, etc work. Oh whips dont seem to work either. It does not increase damage or delay at all, (pets have a standard damage, even str buffs dont affect them), but it does allow higher end pets to use duel wield so they can quad attack for 52 damage.</font></p>
