<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868895375">My 44 pet kick ass with Celerity, Strength, and Shade. (and a fs dagger if<br/>
poss) I have never been a good solo since I have partied a lot. But I<br/>
recently learned that I can solo if I think of my pet as my normal party<br/>
tanks. <br/>
Because of our pets low ac and low hp, tepid deeds/shiftless deeds is a<br/>
must!<br/>
I let the pet tank and after he starts getting hit hard Ill DD for 528, then<br/>
quickly cast memblur (the target has a 75 delay with shiftless so you can<br/>
cast between hits very easily) If your pet looks low, just join in the fight<br/>
and cycle Color Skew/Color Shift. You can keep the target completely<br/>
stunned.<br/>

Subject: Re: Strategy<br/>
<br/>
A little piece of my own advice. =)  Do with it what you want.  As <br/>
Personally I dont enjoy jumping around and running from MOB&#39;s.  I do let my <br/>
pet tank, against Blues. Who hit for around 50 points.  (ouch!)<br/>
I am lvl 29. And my 29th Animation (w/ his 2 daggers) and Augmentation, <br/>
Obscure, Stregnthen. Really kick&#39;s some ass.<br/>
<br/>
I am killing the Intown Bards. (Woah big time faction loss) To get to 30. My<br/>
<br/>
Rotation is as follows.<br/>
<br/>
Tashan/Root/Languid Pace/Suffocate/Sanity Warp/Suffocate/Sanity warp.  At <br/>
this point he&#39;s nearly dead.. and I either Melee him and try to get the last<br/>
<br/>
stroke in, or just DD him again.  But usually i&#39;m at about 40% manna when <br/>
i&#39;m done, and nearly full health.  I&#39;ve check&#39;d my pets health after the <br/>
battle, he&#39;s usualy just a tad below half life. I have lost a pet in doing <br/>
this, but I also was resisted on nearly every spell... *shivers*  That <br/>
wasn&#39;t fun.  BUT, I did use nearly the same strategy against the Hermit in <br/>
S. Karana. from lvl 22-27. Work&#39;d perfect, Never lost a pet. And I didnt die<br/>
<br/>
during ALL those levels.  *smiles* Gotta love that lil bonus.<br/>

Eventually, all enchanters find out that their pet can&#39;t tank. I have<br/>
developed a strategy which will prolong the life of our beloved pets and<br/>
make our use of mana more efficient. However, this will only work if the mob<br/>
you are soloing is not one of those &quot;cons blue but hits like a red&quot; types.<br/>
First, u tashan, then you do your Dot. Then, u wait for the pet to have half<br/>
hp, and then cast the big dd spell. This will draw the mob toward you. Here<br/>
is the most important part. You must begin running in a circle, hitting jump<br/>
every once in a while. The mob will chase u and hit u less then it woud if u<br/>
were standing in one place. While this is going on, your pet is getting free<br/>
hits on the mob and should quickly finish it. Note: as much as you&#39;d want<br/>
to, do NOT use debuffs other than tashan. You must cast your 3 spells<br/>
quickly, before the pet gets so low on hp that the mob will finish it. Once<br/>
again, this will only work if the mob you are fighting is blue. You must<br/>
have an open area to work with, I&#39;d say at least 15ft radius. I am currently<br/>
using this one in Lavastorm and its very mana efficient.  Good luck.<br/>

 &gt;get it every time or just if they make the last hit? Any info would be<br/>

 &gt;&gt;Jewelry skill will cap at 200 so that no platinum items become trivial.<br/>
 &gt;&gt;There is no level cap for trade skills. Main skills are capped at<br/>
 &gt;&gt;(5xlevel)+5, but trade skills do not have this level limitation. Two<br/>
 &gt;&gt;different meanings of skill caps. Hope this clears up the confusion.<br/>

<br/>
Small Enchancement to this if the bards aren&#39;t near any other NPC that would<br/>
get you is to use one of your colour stun spells in the combo.<br/>
<br/>
Easy way to solo even the Ghoul Magi is to buff a pet up then just cycle<br/>
stuns while the pet rips a new one into the mob...<br/>
<br/>
Just make sure the target is all on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Although with the new entrance and dazzle times dd/stun/mes/dd/stun/mes nuke<br/>
combo&#39;s are certainly the way to tackle high level single mobs.<br/>
