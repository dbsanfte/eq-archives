  <div><br></div><tt><br>Well, last night I decided to see how hard it is to 
  train Jewlcraft After<br>200. (skill was 201 went up making some jewelry for a 
  friend.) So from 201<br>to 206 how much money do you think I lost? Actually 
  nothing.&nbsp; I made some<br>money, I enchanted every bar and I was making 
  money selling it back to<br>vendor (vendor bought gold ruby rings back for 
  147pp and some change, cost<br>131p and change 10p and change for the gem and 
  bar respectively) So I made<br>about 5p of each one.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t keep track 
  of 201 to 203 but from 203 to 206<br>I made 240 Gold Ruby Rings selling them 
  all back to the vendor, I think I<br>failed 6 times.&nbsp; While I was making 
  these I would /auction some of the 4int<br>2str earrings and 4str 2int 
  earrings.&nbsp; Dont like to mess with plat to order.<br>The only time I do 
  plat is when I loot some Fire Opals and then just try my<br>luck.&nbsp; Anyone 
  else trying to raise it past 200?&nbsp; I know Plat malachite is<br>cheaper 
  each attempt but the mana to enchant the bars was killing me ( I<br>tried 20 
  with no increases). <br><br>Any ideas, Suggestions, or Experiences 
  here?<br><br>Teenimu<br>Enchanter Tunare Server<br>53 Season<br><br>Btw my int 
  was 213 while doing these.<br>And wisdom of below 100 not sure what it 
  was.&nbsp; But I don&#39;t believe in the<br>wisdom theory. I think Abashi on one 
  of his recent posts dispelled this.<br>Unless your a wisdom based 
  caster/player then your skill goes off this. <br>-----Original

  Re: [eqenchanters] Jewelry<br><br><br>Heh, haven&#39;t we all tried 
  this?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thing is, once you reach a certain skill<br>level (I think 
  21), it<br>says in all red &quot;You must learn advanced skills in this trade&quot; 
  which means<br>you gotta do it the hard<br>way.&nbsp; Do the stein quest
