Rod of Insidious Glamour: (increases charisma) He needs a golden rod (from a<br/>
froglok priest in guk) and an enchanted shining stone. The enchanted shining<br/>
stone is made from a shining stone from shadow men, take that stone to<br/>
Cynthia, a gypsie in the rathe mountains and give it and 50gp to get it<br/>
enchanted. Then go to Highkeep and get the stone transmuted. The two steps<br/>
for getting the stone each raise faction with beta neutral and can be done<br/>
separately from the rest of the quest for those who just need a faction<br/>
boost<br/>

<br/>
Incandescent Gloves: He needs to sew together four other sets of gloves to<br/>
make these. Glowing Gloves from Shadowed Men, Radiant Gloves from Radiant in<br/>
the mazes of Cazic Thule and Enchanted and Gleaming gloves. For Gleaming<br/>
Gloves you have to give Tarn Vislin in Highkeep a bloodstone he will then<br/>
give you Gleaming gloves. Bring 50gp to Tizina of the Lavastorm Gypsies. She<br/>
will then hand you the Enchanted Gloves.<br/>

Incandescent Mask:  He needs a Glowing Mask, found on the skeletal monk in<br/>
the caverns of Guk (I have also been told you can get one on the froglock<br/>
scryer) and all three Runes of Fortune. One Rune can be found on the Dark<br/>
Elf Enynti in the Chasm below Castle Mistmoore. The other two can each be<br/>
purchased for 50 golden coins each - one from Mizr N`Mar in the Neriak City<br/>
Library and the other from Madam Serena in Qeynos.<br/>
