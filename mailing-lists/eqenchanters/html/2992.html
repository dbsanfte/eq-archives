i think what they are tryin to get across is that enchanters can do more <br/>
than just mez, i&#39;m a crazy a$$ chanter often goin deep into Kael with just a<br/>
<br/>
few people and a charm spell. course when you get up to higher levels charm <br/>
doesn&#39;t resist :o)  (7th ilse in air /drool)<br/>
<br/>
also  personally i think Rune is prolly the best spell to put on a robe as <br/>
long as the recast isn&#39;t over 20second (i don&#39;t remeber recast time heh)  <br/>
but there are so many times where i&#39;m left manaless after 5 runes, and it&#39;s <br/>
such a nice spell to have on your people on big raids.  i can&#39;t think of a <br/>
better spell to put on it cept maybe rune5.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway i know nothing is gonna please everyone... but when you used to <br/>
being the only chanter to buff 30-40 people, the only thing you want is <br/>
Shissar to last about 10 mins longer   (cause recasting that on 30+ peeps <br/>
gets annoying fast).<br/>

&gt;I think they have a right to be though, don&#39;t you? I was reading all the<br/>
&gt;responses to Absor&#39;s post on Enchanters and some of the other classes and I<br/>
&gt;think I am the only one who doesn&#39;t really care that some (ok, near all) <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;SoV mobs have such high MR and many , many are unmezzable.  So what its a<br/>
&gt;few zones, there are so many other places to go you cant complain about a<br/>
&gt;handful of zones that we cant mez in.  Granted I am only 54 but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;really bother me.  I also got a kick out of how many people were bitching<br/>
&gt;about wanting new Illusions.  Yeah, I think some of the reasons they give<br/>
&gt;for not giving us new Illusions are pretty much crap and wish they would<br/>
&gt;just be honest.  But I could really give a poo if we don&#39;t get anymore.  <br/>
&gt;Not<br/>
&gt;unless they don&#39;t have some sort of use to them (faction, stat +&#39;s that are<br/>
&gt;worth the time/manna it takes to cast).<br/>
