if at all possible.  To each his own...<br/>

Well, I have played many characters, even the ones that started in GFay and<br/>
Steamfont when I first got EQ I ran at level 1 to Freeport. Later, after<br/>
getting to 5th, they all ended up in Misty Thicket til around 14th. At that<br/>
time Paw was still low level and I would plow through it with a buddy or 2<br/>
til 17th. *sigh* Those were the days. Then it was on to Highpass or bouncing<br/>
around in the Karanas. I am not looking to fight over orc spawns in EC, WC<br/>
or Misty, and from what I have seen, Steamfont is relatively empty, unless<br/>
the high levels are camping Meldrath, the Hero, or Renoux(sp?) for the rogue<br/>
epic quest.<br/>
<br/>
Steamfont is a self-sustaining zone up to 12 I believe. Quiet, not crowded,<br/>
and lag isn&#39;t terrible there. Plus if you are lucky and a Druid or Shaman is<br/>
camping guards, they will buff you.<br/>
<br/>
*About here is the rant.. sorry. It is not directed at Mark either btw. Just<br/>
venting. =)*<br/>
<br/>
Personally, guard camping is rather stupid. There are enough things to whack<br/>
on besides guards and they don&#39;t ruin faction. People that kill guards are<br/>
setting themselves up so they cannot complete quests worth completing.<br/>
People really need to put the RP back into this game.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to not notice how many people are actually in any zone I am in as I<br/>
have my OOC, shout, and auction filters off unless I am selling or buying.<br/>
The game is much more enjoyable without k3wl dood3 speech, ooc arguments<br/>
over classes that suck for xxx reason, and people that want handouts<br/>
spamming the channels that they are new and need uber equipment or PL<br/>
sessions. Since Gfay is a main location for this, I can see why most people<br/>
avoid it like the plague, and with low level KSing and CB being a pain in<br/>
the a$$ over camping rights and KSing as well.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I had a level 3 wizard come up to me and inspect me 9(!!!!) times<br/>
in about 2 minutes. It isn&#39;t like my equipment changed in that time... then<br/>
he asked the question I knew was coming. &quot;Got any stuff you don&#39;t need, or<br/>
plat?&quot;  &lt;~ asked for PLAT! He then followed with &quot;I&#39;m new to EQ.&quot;.  You have<br/>
got to be joking! A true newbie would not be asking for equipment, they<br/>
would be asking for what is safe to hunt here, and other basic questions. My<br/>
reply was (after inspecting him 30 times or so rapidly) &quot;No, I need the<br/>
equipment I have as I am using it. There is no such thing as money I don&#39;t<br/>
need, especially plat. Now go kill things for what you need like I did.&quot;  I<br/>
then got up and ran to my spawn point with SoW on.<br/>
<br/>
Beggars get under my skin in a heartbeat. I don&#39;t mind helping others; in<br/>
fact I enjoy it and give things away all the time. Nothing major, leather to<br/>
druids, etc and buffs are free. I just can&#39;t stand seeing people standing<br/>
outside a bank for HOURS pestering every person that comes by for stuff when<br/>
they could have spent that time leveling. One person I know had it hotkeyed<br/>
it came out so fast and so repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Ok I am done. If you read this far, thank you. If you agree with me, Yay!.<br/>
If you don&#39;t, well... you will burn in Hades! j/k. =)<br/>

&quot;Warning label reads: Beggars are KoS, now what do you want?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Too bad Sentinel doesn&#39;t warn you when a beggar is around.&quot;</div>
