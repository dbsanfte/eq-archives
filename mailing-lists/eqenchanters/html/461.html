<div id="ygrps-yiv-11690670">Has anyone tried using metals other than the bars, such as copper<br/>
amulets or silver studs and combined them with anything?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps those things could be used as the third ingerdient.<br/>

&gt; &gt;recently I tried 3 ingredient experiments though, I<br/>
&gt; used cheap gems so I<br/>
&gt; &gt;would not waste the money that I do not have :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;I tried Silver with cheap gems, with pixie dust (I<br/>
&gt; have like 20 pixie dust<br/>
&gt; &gt;so I figured why not) I figured pixie dust would<br/>
&gt; work, cause you can<br/>
&gt; &gt;probably mix the dust into the metal but it did not<br/>
&gt; work :(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got an idea, but it will take participation. <br/>
&gt; Perhaps we can each try<br/>
&gt; combinine 3 items one time, and this way we will get<br/>
&gt; a wide spread of<br/>
&gt; materials.  Verant must have put 4 slots in the<br/>
&gt; jewelers bag for some<br/>
&gt; reason...  weapons certainly dont fit in them so try<br/>
&gt; anything... I have<br/>
&gt; tried bone chips (dont combine), bat wings (dont<br/>
&gt; combine), and multiple<br/>
&gt; gems (never works).  I dont see what combining gems<br/>
&gt; or metal with pelts<br/>
&gt; could do.  I may try a rusted blackbox next... also<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if<br/>
&gt; there was any way of combining coins to perhaps make<br/>
&gt; a bar of metal ,i.e. 4<br/>
&gt; banks filled with 20 cp each may produce a copper<br/>
&gt; bar?  This doesnt really<br/>
&gt; sound valid as that many sp=8gp when they can be<br/>
&gt; purchased for 5, but could<br/>
&gt; this be an untried idea?  let me know!<br/>
