<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090086514">I still havent bought it but from what I&#39;ve read, it just improves your<br/>
faction a bit. So a dark elf guard would still attack you, but some dwarf<br/>
merchant that does not like elves might sell to you for a bad price instead<br/>
of not selling and another merchant that was selling to you for a bad price<br/>
might give you a better price.<br/>

I am from Flewithe, and still in that general area doing all my exploring<br/>
there, I am half way to level 11, and i want to get the spell Alliance to<br/>
have for when i travel to new areas. i can not seem to find in in Felwithe,<br/>
i am sure its there, can anyone tell me where? i would greatly appreciate<br/>
it. and also, if you cast Alliance on a guard...like a darkelf guard, will<br/>
he attack you?<br/>
