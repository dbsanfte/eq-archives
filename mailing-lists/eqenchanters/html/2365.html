<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578994420">Gossamer also drops from the necros in Befallen- mostly on the 3rd floor.<br/>
And in Unrest, the hags drop it- so 16 is a bit low, unless you are buying<br/>
it...<br/>
<br/>
Previous Post:<br/>
Unrest is one place I&#39;ve found a fair bit of gossamer myself, which seems<br/>
to<br/>
be treasured by the spell casting hags that wander around there.  I wouldnt<br/>
try to take any from them at level 16 myself however...</div>
