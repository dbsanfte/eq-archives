<div id="ygrps-yiv-873294845">Ok here&#39;s my findings so far on research...<br/>
<br/>
You cannot research spells that are beyond your current characters level.<br/>
Being a level 15, even with research at 150, 255 or whatever, you will<br/>
always fail on a level 16+ spell you are trying to combine from research.<br/>
Also, your research skill level is also checked. I have NO clue what so<br/>
ever, but hearing someone with a skill of 17, researching a level 16 spell<br/>
gets an increase is a good foundation to start with. I myself keep pouring<br/>
my training points into research, currently I have around 33-38 skill in<br/>
research and will continue to burn points in it. I did get two tomb pages,<br/>
43 and 44 that I failed on trying to combine them. I&#39;ve recently gotten<br/>
pages 55 and 77 as well. I assume the tomb page numbers increase when the<br/>
level of the spell increases, but again, I do not know for sure.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never seen a skill gain from all the spells I&#39;ve made (color shift, mes,<br/>
endure magic, strip enchantment, tepid deeds, levitate, and disempower), I<br/>
always get the message it&#39;s trivial for my skill and make a spell from<br/>
combining the pages. All my skill is from training.<br/>
	I would suggest two routes for you on research, do it with the intent of<br/>
supplying everyone you can with the spells you make, using training points<br/>
to help push the skill up into the level needed for the research you want<br/>
to do. This is the case I am following, I charge two pages for one<br/>
completed spell, nor full market price for it. Else you can let someone<br/>
else pursue research and supply you with the spells they come up with.<br/>
Sooner or later, we&#39;ll all have the spells from research, just a question<br/>
how important it is to you at the time. I am one of three I know of on<br/>
Rellos Zek that are working research very hard and have a very good supply<br/>
of pages coming in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
