<div id="ygrps-yiv-708800577">I was wondering if anyone had any advice on what stun spell to use when you<br/>
*can&#39;t* use the color flux series.  At the moment I&#39;m fighting in the High<br/>
Keep basement against the picklaws and AE is out.  I can successfully use<br/>
color flux 5 out of 6 times, but that 6th time the guards come and at the<br/>
very least hang around and make our lives difficult and at worst kill me.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is standard enchanter fare - occassionally I get a gob on me and<br/>
need to mez.  Normally *BAM* Color Flux, step back, mez, no problem.<br/>
Without color flux I&#39;m having to just stand there and take it and keep<br/>
pounding the mez key until one gets through.  Is there no better<br/>
alternative?<br/>
