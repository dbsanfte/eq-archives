<div id="ygrps-yiv-224338076">I can&#39;t say that I have ever had a problem with the ogre.  I didn&#39;t even<br/>
know to keep an eye out for him.  As a matter of habit, I illus to what ever<br/>
race is home to a city, and have always been a human in freeport.  I have<br/>
not had a problem turning in all four items at once (done it 5 times). <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Every time I did it I gave all the ingredients to him at once. As a high<br/>

than the barkeep does. Aren&#39;t factions screwy things?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because he is an ogre outcast.  He was hated in Oggok and shunned,<br/>
because he was too smart.  The barbarian saved him from Guk when he was<br/>
young, though, and they have been friends since.  He is not quite a typical<br/>
ogre.  I&#39;m not sure exactly what faction he is, but he hates Enchanters in<br/>
Ogre form.  : )  And DE form.<br/>
