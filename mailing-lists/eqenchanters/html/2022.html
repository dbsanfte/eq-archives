<b>Subject:</b> kialo nuts <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810200342">has anyone recently had a problem acquiring kiola nuts from sister island?<br/>
i went to sister island last night and i couldn&#39;t get any of the sisters to<br/>
sale to me.<br/>
tried all 3 buildings and they just conned (indifferent as a half-elf) and<br/>
that&#39;s it...<br/>
they would not open a merchant trade screen for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
also, has anyone found any kialo nuts anywhere else?<br/>
the quest does mention that some are found in the karanas or qeynos (i can&#39;t<br/>
remember off hand)<br/>
<br/>
btw, i&#39;ve done the quest before as an enchanter on another server.</div>
