<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329781878">Some longwinded directions to the animation vendor in High Keep.<br/>
<br/>
I assume you know how to get to High Hold Pass.  It is surrounded by<br/>
Kithicor and East Karana.  Try one of the websites or just ask again if<br/>
you can&#39;t manage to find one of these places.<br/>
<br/>
If you are coming from the Qeynos direction you will enter at the West<br/>
Gate.  On the east end of East Karana is a huge ramp that climbs up in<br/>
to the mountains.  Climb the ramp to zone into the West Gate of High<br/>
Hold Pass.  Gnolls in the level 16 20 range spawn at this gate.  Invis<br/>
is the way to go.  The easiest way to get to the Keep if you are not<br/>
familiar with the area is to stay on the main path (Don&#39;t go up any<br/>
ramps) and take all left turns.  You will pass a log cabin that is a<br/>
saloon (Maybe the Golden Rooster) and this should tell you you are<br/>
close.  Following the next turn should bring you to the front of a<br/>
castle, High Keep.  Eventually you will learn there is a faster way<br/>
that lets you skip that loop with the saloon, but until you are healthy<br/>
enough to learn the terrain without getting stomped by a gnoll, follow<br/>
the left hand wall.<br/>
<br/>
Those of you coming from Freeport/Neriak will approach through<br/>
Kithicor.  At the West end of Kithicor you will find a mountain zone<br/>
entrance to High Pass.  Orcs spawn at this end and they should be<br/>
approximately the same level as the gnolls, if not a little bit higher.<br/>
 These guys spawn right on the path so if there is no one there killing<br/>
them off, you will HAVE to be invis to get through with out a scuffle. <br/>
Follow the main path until you come to a wooden bridge.  Don&#39;t cross<br/>
the bridge but rather take a 90 degree turn to the right and look down<br/>
the hill.  The path continues here.  Going down the hill you will see a<br/>
store called Serpent Supply.  Just skip it and follow the path up to<br/>
the left.  You will soon enter a cave, and this i sa good time to stop<br/>
and look around.  if you take a left inside the cave you end up in a<br/>
small room with 3 bandits who will quickly dispatch you if you are<br/>
under level 16 or so.  Take a right instead, going up a small hill and<br/>
then down the otherside in to the hold.<br/>
<br/>
Now all you Westerners and Easterners are in the same place, looking at<br/>
the front of the Keep.  Go in to the keep and enter by going either<br/>
left or right, they both end up in the same place as you go around the<br/>
wall to zone into High Keep.  The Keep is not entirely safe because<br/>
there are some level 24 to 30 goblins in the basement as well as some<br/>
crazed prisoners in the jail next to the bank.<br/>
<br/>
As you enter the zone you findyourself in a courtyard with a vendor and<br/>
a beggar and another gate in front of you.  Again you can go either way<br/>
around the wall (has a HIGH KEEP sign) to get inside.  There is a<br/>
hallway to the left and right with a staircase going up and another<br/>
wall in front of you to go around.  This time you can only go to the<br/>
left.  That&#39;s your clue that you are in the right place.  After going<br/>
left around the wall you can go straight to the vendor by going through<br/>
the first door on the left.  There is a door in this room you must<br/>
open, then you will find a bard and enchanter vendor a couple rooms<br/>
back.  If you need to go to the bank it is downstairs.   from the point<br/>
where you went arounfd the wall to the left, go to the right wall and<br/>
enter the inn through either of the two doors.  take a left and then<br/>
another left and go down the stairs.  at the bottom of the stairs take<br/>
a right and you should see the bank on your right.  Do your business<br/>
and go back upstairs.  Don&#39;t open the door and don&#39;t go down another<br/>
level of steps.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully that should get you there.<br/>
