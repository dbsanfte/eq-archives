<div id="ygrps-yiv-559806441">The otnly way that will ever work is if every player of every class gets <br/>
together and says DAMNITT VERANT STOP THE NERFS. I currently play 3 classes <br/>
that have gotten nerfed fairly badly. Every time that class would rally <br/>
together send the emails, send the feedback, all to no avail cause all the <br/>
other classes were supporting the nerf not realizing they were next. If you <br/>
really want to do something about the nerfing you need to get everyone <br/>
together. Just my 2 bits..<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Howdy folks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Welp, I feel I too must speak out about this recent change of Enchanters<br/>
&gt;not being able to cast charm or fear against a player. First let me say, I<br/>
&gt;disagree that it makes Enchanters useless in PvP now weather solo, or<br/>
&gt;grouped. First off, in a PvP fight, I&#39;d prefer having my pet vs. being able<br/>
&gt;to charm the other player. Now fear itself will be missed but it is still<br/>
&gt;mostly possible to win a PvP fight playing an Enchanter.<br/>
&gt;Now lets get down and dirty as to what and why this change came about. I am<br/>
&gt;sure most of you know that have good PvP experience, fearing another player<br/>
&gt;can very easily be used to exploit. Now that they have removed fear, and<br/>
&gt;charm from PvP, here&#39;s what was happening. Lets say a level 30 Enchanter<br/>
&gt;cast fear on a level 30 Magician, the player would run uncontrollably in<br/>
&gt;fear right? Well yes, but also that PC would in a sense become an NPC for<br/>
&gt;the duration the fear spell is in effect, thus allowing ANY player to cast<br/>
&gt;upon them, say 2 or 3 lvl 50&#39;s waiting in the wings for fear to go off. Now<br/>
&gt;let us also keep in mind, doing this to a player is cheating, but good ole&#39;<br/>
&gt;Veriant couldn&#39;t do anything about it unless they saw the player cast fear<br/>
&gt;so his friends could attack as well (God know&#39;s even if everyone in the<br/>
&gt;world thinks your a rat, Veriant has to see you being one themselves b4<br/>
&gt;they&#39;ll do a single thing). Also, keep in mind, it is policy that Veriant<br/>
&gt;give a player the 5 strike rule. Meaning you get 3 verbal warnings, on your<br/>
&gt;4th, you are suspended for using an exploit such as this for oh, say maybe<br/>
&gt;a week. Then the 5th warning your gone forever by them banning you. I must<br/>
&gt;say this is a complete joke first off. For it takes an act of God himself<br/>
&gt;to SEE everyone using this exploit because ppl would not do it over and<br/>
&gt;over knowing the other player petitioned and a GM MIGHT be watching this<br/>
&gt;time. Also, for you ppl who have programming experience, just consider how<br/>
&gt;much of a nightmare this bug is to fix (thus is why it&#39;s been around<br/>
&gt;forever, just not many ppl knew about it to begin with). Also on that note,<br/>
&gt;keep in mind, I&#39;ve herd about players having 5+ warnings and Veriant not<br/>
&gt;doing a thing with them. It seems GM&#39;s are giving ppl warning without<br/>
&gt;actually telling them they are getting one (oh ya this is a major <br/>
&gt;surprise).<br/>
&gt;The bug with charm in PvP is this, well this is one problem they also had<br/>
&gt;an almost impossible time resolving so they just removed it. Lets say the<br/>
&gt;same lvl 30 Enchanter attacks a lvl 26 Magician (heh yes Im just picking on<br/>
&gt;Magicians this morn), all is fine right? The Enchanter is within the 4<br/>
&gt;level limit and no problems right? Well the Enchanter charms the Magician,<br/>
&gt;making the Magician a pet, yet not an NPC. BUT what it does do is make the<br/>
&gt;Magician a lvl 30 pet, allowing the 3 level 34 wizards waiting in the wings<br/>
&gt;to attack the Magician. This is much more complicated than the fear bug,<br/>
&gt;and just as hard to resolve. Again I am sure there were other reason as<br/>
&gt;well, but the bottom line is Veriant didn&#39;t see a clear path in fixing<br/>
&gt;this, so they just removed it from the game. In my view  that is totally<br/>
&gt;lame and completely unacceptable. Frankly I can live without either in PvP<br/>
&gt;and always have, but the point is here they are removing abilities in the<br/>
&gt;game just due to the fact it&#39;s easier to remove it than to fix it. Ya ya<br/>
&gt;ya, chances are in a year or so they&#39;ll fix it and give the two abilities<br/>
&gt;back to us, but that just proves my point even more.<br/>
&gt;Now dont get me wrong, I love Everquest and PvP. The reason for my post is<br/>
&gt;just to public ally say that I find Veriants decision on this dead wrong<br/>
&gt;and should be resolved in a different way than cutting abilities due to<br/>
&gt;mangled code they have to deal with. It&#39;s like they are saying, sorry I am<br/>
&gt;too lazy to properly address this, so I&#39;ll just cut out one of your prime<br/>
&gt;abilities instead (again, although I personally didn&#39;t depend on this<br/>
&gt;myself). Do however keep in mind that we are NOT usless now due to this<br/>
&gt;change, for personally I never used fear or charm to fight in PvP, it just<br/>
&gt;seemed a waste of time while you could be doing damage, or mes&#39;n then<br/>
&gt;draining there mana.<br/>
&gt;I would like to ask each and everyone of you to protest this change and ask<br/>
&gt;Veriant to fix the real problem so we have our intended abilities to do<br/>
&gt;battle with. There are some things that are just unacceptable that they do,<br/>
&gt;and I believe this path is one of them. Let them know you are against this<br/>
&gt;and want our abilities back!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you,<br/>
