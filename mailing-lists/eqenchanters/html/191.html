<b>Subject:</b> Solo Fighting Strategies <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-383123746">I was curious what strategies everyone is using when fighting solo?  I<br/>
tend to Root them, cast Chaotic Feedback, meditate (heh), cast Chaotic<br/>
Feedback and repeat until out of mana. After this I hope their dead or<br/>
almost dead. If not I run like heck!<br/>
<br/>
I like grouping as much as possible, but the people I&#39;ve been grouping<br/>
with lately just don&#39;t seem to get it.  They want to fight Tombstone<br/>
creatures when everyone is half healed and low on mana. They also don&#39;t<br/>
let me bring out one creature at a time for the group to wallop. Instead<br/>
they jump all 4-5 Orcs at a camp, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I got tired of dying so I have been playing solo some more.</div>
