<b>Subject:</b> Leveling past 40 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654879465">I&#39;m looking for good places to level past level 40.  This is my 3rd <br/>
post 40 character, and I&#39;d rather not level in SolB or Guk, and I&#39;ve <br/>
never PLed doing guards, however, this may be an option as I just<br/>
want <br/>
to level quickly.  I&#39;m also looking for places where I can solo<br/>
<br/>
Ideas I can come up with (although I don&#39;t know much about them <br/>
eperience wise from a below 50 perspective):<br/>
<br/>
CoM- grouped<br/>
Overthere- solo or small group (but really don&#39;t like this area)<br/>
Kaesorea- grouped, MOBs from 25ish to level 40 (Xalgoz)<br/>
Temple of Droga- grouped, not sure on the level range of things here<br/>
Mines of Nurga- not sure at all on the level range here<br/>
Frontier Mountains- group or solo<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the level range of MOBs in these zones?  I killed a <br/>
bunch of stuff in these zones when the expansion first came out, but <br/>
with the exception of CoM at 51/52 I didn&#39;t get experience from any<br/>
of <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a little background, all the characters I&#39;ve played from start <br/>
to 50+ were all before Kunark, and while I&#39;ve camped items in each of <br/>
these zones with various people (so I do know the layouts), I&#39;ve<br/>
never <br/>
done it for exp.  I also don&#39;t know what agro on pulling is like.<br/>
<br/>
Any help on those who&#39;ve leveled there would be great!  Thanks!</div>
