<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320179605">I just joined the list today so I don&#39;t know what all you have discussed.<br/>
But I do know that losing our pet would be a HUGH detriment to our class and<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine what they would give us to compinsate.  I don&#39;t think I<br/>
could have ever done enough damage to kill an Orc Centurian.  Featherweight<br/>
would be very cool but would help others a lot more than us.  They would<br/>
have to give us something REALLY good to make up for taking away our pets if<br/>
they decided to do that. Although I can see it in one place.  The Race Wars<br/>
server.  We will RULE the race war server.  With the ablitity to blind,<br/>
root, and change forms we can effectivly be that assassins of the Race War.<br/>
That, or if you choose we are the only class that can travel anywhere and<br/>
not be attacked as some as someone sees us.<br/>
