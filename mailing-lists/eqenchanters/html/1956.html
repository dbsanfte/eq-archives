<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130620338">Greetings,<br/>
Race is a matter of persoanl preference.<br/>
I believe a Enchanter should learn and master all trade skills and generally<br/>
be the trade person in a group.  More so in cases like yours.<br/>
It is not important who makes a item, only that you have access to it.  So<br/>
unless you like creating items and are willing and able to invest in the<br/>
skill (time and money) your group should focus on one to handle each trade<br/>
skill that you would like.<br/>
Enchanters are the best choice because they have a high Int so leanr quicker<br/>
then say a Warrior and then the Enchanter spells let you buy and sell<br/>
cheaper then any other class in more places.  Enchanters will use the<br/>
Pottery, Jewelry, and tailoring skills so far and likely more.  Blacksmithng<br/>
helps cut the costs on Pottery and Tinkering a bit and is useful for making<br/>
armor and someday weapons.  I expect it to be useful for an Enchanter down<br/>
the line in making magic weapons but this wont likely be soon.<br/>
I would not start off with a trade skill until 8th level and not invest<br/>
heavily unless I had cash available.  This depends on your style and group.<br/>
Save and don&#39;t sell the parts you get that can be used as raw materials if<br/>
you can so that when your ready it will be cheaper to get started.<br/>
Jewelry can be found at www.eqportal.com/jewelry (I think but the correct<br/>
link is on the initial page).<br/>
Tinkering is working just fine and most of what the manual says is in the<br/>
game.  However so far no one has discovered the recipe yet for some items<br/>
like fireworks (a little dissapointing in the effect if you ask me) or<br/>
collapsible fishing poles. Not even sure if the thermal cloak or goggles are<br/>
in the game yet.<br/>
Tinkering can be found at www.eqportal.com/tinkering<br/>
Thre is a trade skill page I have a link to in the initial page as well for<br/>
a tinkering site (not hosted by me so I don&#39;t recall the url without my<br/>
notes or bookmarks.)  It is not designed to be a spoiler but more of a<br/>
teaching tool.<br/>
<br/>
My recommendation is to get Strengthen early and cast it often. Minor<br/>
Illusion is good for resting.  Save the pet spell until you can afford the<br/>
cash for summoning regularly.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hi everyone, i am new to the world of enchanters (not to Norrath itself,<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I have played a cleric, warrior and magician to around lvl 20).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I am embarking on this new adventure with a group of my friends, all<br/>
&gt;&gt; starting new characters, on a new server, so as to help us resist the<br/>
&gt;&gt; twink temptation...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway, could some of you wisened enchanters give me some thoughts on<br/>
&gt;&gt; starting my character?  Race?  Attributes?  Spells to avoid?  Should I<br/>
&gt;&gt; be a jeweler?<br/>
