<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032052026">I have most of the best weaps for enchanters in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Observer Staff, Sacrifical Dagger, and Staff of Writhing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give my perspective:  1 handed weapons have an incredibly good bonus in<br/>
that you can use a shimmering orb, or glowing black sphere in your other<br/>
hand.  Whilt generally speaking I group for my exp, I occassionally do fight<br/>
solo, and join in with my pet or after Ihave finished kiting it near death.<br/>
Jboots help for that.<br/>
<br/>
Now Ob Staff and Sac Dagger are both good cos they have the 5 int bonus.<br/>
The damage is low on the dagger, but its twice as fast so itbalances out.<br/>
On that basis alone I would rather have the dagger than the ob staff anyday<br/>
of the week since i have the second melee spot then.<br/>
<br/>
The staff of writhing is also EXCELLENT.  9 dmg 1 handed weap, speed is<br/>
decent too.  I dont know what level the special kicks in at, BUT the thing<br/>
abou the special is not the damage but the 2 sec casting stun it gives.<br/>
Really helpful later on when you are doing spell casters if one decides it<br/>
wants to beat on you, as they sometimes do.   It&#39;s major downside is the chr<br/>
mask.  Which makes life of the charmer suck unless you wear a star ruby veil<br/>
which gives you 9 cha, or have the level 49 spell which gives you 40 cha.<br/>
<br/>
Overall I think 1h pierce or 1h blunt is the way to go, but the ob staff is<br/>
excellent for the mid levels - 15 to 25.   Take yur pick, and keep all your<br/>
weaps maxedif possible, just rotate them as they max in each level.<br/>
