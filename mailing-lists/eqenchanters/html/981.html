All of the lag that you see when you play Everquest is internet traffic.  It<br/>
does not have anything to do (at least presently) with Verant&#39;s servers, or<br/>
your internet connection (you can play at 2Kb/sec with no lag).  I am not<br/>
going to just throw this out here, and ask you to believe, but here are some<br/>
concrete facts:<br/>
Up until about a week ago, I was playing over a modem, and connected at<br/>
44Kbits/s (roughly 5Kbytes/sec.)  I have a program called SyGate that allows<br/>
my roomate to be online through our network.  Both of us were able to play<br/>
on ONE dial-up line, simutaneously, with no lag on either end.  Verant&#39;s<br/>
network code is extremely efficient.  Hit F11 and look at the data transfers<br/>
when you are in-game.  You will see that most of the time the game is<br/>
transferring under 1Kb/sec!  In heavily populated zones, you will see around<br/>
1.5 to 2kb/s of transfer.  Having seen other networked games (and being a<br/>
network tech) I can really appreciate the code behind their networking.<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of moving characters to other servers, I disagree with you<br/>
again.  In order to form a community, and establish at least SOME degree of<br/>
role playing, in my opinion you need to keep each &quot;world&quot;, or server,<br/>
totally seperate from the others.  No player interaction, no moving<br/>
characters, nothing.  This is why Verant did NOT allow chars to move from<br/>
server to server.  It destroys the sense of community on your server.  I bet<br/>
you can name one of the 5 highest leveled characters on your server, just as<br/>
everyone knows who Mark McGuire is.  Now what if some stranger appeared on<br/>
earth and was phenominal at hitting, and bashed 60 home runs in a season,<br/>
and nobody (NOBODY) had heard of him before.  If that happened frequently<br/>
(and it would), what kind of community is that?<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have been civil, I feel I must inform others of some things (not<br/>
you Manuel):<br/>
<br/>
1. If you don&#39;t know anything about networking, don&#39;t speculate about lag!<br/>
Mr Core Leader assumes that the network talk between servers would cause mad<br/>
lag... that is not true at all.  Those machines are most definitely<br/>
networked together, and have an extremely high bandwidth network to send<br/>
tiny insignificant messages on.  Rule out lag on that.<br/>
<br/>
2. If you don&#39;t know anything abotu programming, don&#39;t speculate about how<br/>
&quot;loopholes&quot; would appear if this happened or that happened.  Again Mr Core<br/>
Leader assumes that Verant would write code that accepted third party<br/>
packets, processed them, and give characters unique items and &quot;100000 plat&quot;.<br/>
If Verant changed their mind about switching chars between servers (and I<br/>
hope they do not), they would not write code that allowed other machines to<br/>
interact with that.  They would simply query the server on which the char<br/>
exists (or a global database if they decide to store the characters on a<br/>
non-world server) and get the information.  Having Static IP&#39;s, they could<br/>
rule out any packets with a non-Verant header.  Easily done, I might add.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the rants here, but it gets old reading message after message of<br/>
garbage.<br/>

&gt; Remember, we are trying to have a sharing of ideas here. If the best you<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; do is flame, you probably had nothing worthwhile to say to begin with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been playing online games since &#39;89, and I believe a part of our lag<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; due to having entire databases stored locally. We can debate data<br/>
structures<br/>
&gt; and use of algorithms to our hearts content, but I still believe it is a<br/>
&gt; cause. It is possible to design a system that allows you to store data on<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; server (to help avoid hacks) and still allow you to play any one of your<br/>
&gt; characters on any server. Think about it. There would be allot of<br/>
benefits.<br/>
&gt; I still maintain having a character permanently tied to a specific server<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; a serious design flaw in EQ. A flaw easily avoidable by anyone who wants<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; compete with EQ. I still hope Verant allows us to transfer characters<br/>
&gt; between servers in the future, even if it involves a fee. Otherwise, we<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; no intention of renewing our EQ subscriptions once something else becomes<br/>
&gt; available.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now if someone wants to flame me further, I suggest:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Use English. Maybe discover the wonders of paragraph structure and make<br/>
&gt; an attempt at grammar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Try to present a clear, concise logical rebuttal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) Have the guts to sign your flame.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Who knows, if these suggestions had been followed, the post might have<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; worth reading.<br/>

&gt; Switching characters between servers is the stupidest idea anyone ever<br/>
&gt; thought of... how are you ever going to be able to contact friends you<br/>
made<br/>
&gt; on one server? Of course YOU live near all your friends and can call them<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; saying let&#39;s all go to this server but everyone doesn&#39;t have that<br/>
option...<br/>
&gt; DO THEY? Think about it from a programming point of view, the transfering<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; characters would leave many many loopholes and whereas a program similar<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; uoextreme could jump in and give you 1000000 platium... hmm... You didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think things through did you? Okay, you still don&#39;t agree so here goes<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; more... A new server comes up and everyone playing it is a newbie then all<br/>
&gt; the sudden verant let&#39;s us do this stupid server switching crap and<br/>
&gt; blacksmiths go over there selling everything at 5 times the cost they<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; get on an established server. This would also let high level parties go to<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; new server and camp all the huge monsters... Emporer Crush for example?<br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s look a bit deeper... How would a guild be able to keep in contact?<br/>
&gt; Talking between servers would cause ungodly 24 hour 7 days a week 365 days<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; year LAG!!!!! Not to mention the constant character switching would cause<br/>
&gt; more lag therefore screwing up your playing anyways... So basically pick<br/>
&gt; your server and STICK TO IT!!!! Why are people always wanting to move?<br/>
When<br/>
&gt; I first started playing I picked the server with the least amouth of<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; on it... Bertoxx, and it still remains towards the bottom of the server<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; and even if it had 2000 people playing all the time I would not switch<br/>
&gt; because all my friends on that server... so thank you and sorry if it<br/>
&gt; sounded like a flame because it was suppose to sound worse than that.<br/>
