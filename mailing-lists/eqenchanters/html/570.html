<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443815124">I have heard that successes and failures in jewelry are affected by your Wisdom level.  My Enchanter has a jewelcraft skill of 33 and a Wisdom of about 75+-.  I&#39;ve found that I can make most of the silver jewelry, even the topaz, with more success than failures.  Every once in a while I&#39;ll have a bad luck streak and fail 5 times in a row with something easy like Rose Quartz, but for the most part I have success.  <br/>
    When you are posting success or failure rates try posting your Wisdom level and skill level so we can compare.<br/>
