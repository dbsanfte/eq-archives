<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269799776">Due to the continual Nerfing of the Enchanter class there has been a call to<br/>
have a day where no one plays thier Enchanter characters.  This Enchanter<br/>
boycott is tentatively scheduled for May 22cnd. If you are at all concerned<br/>
with the contunual degradation of the Enchanters spells especially the bread<br/>
and butter spells like Mez, Memory Blur, and Whirl please tell all your<br/>
friends about thsi and pass it along. And don&#39;t play your Enchanter on May<br/>
22cnd. Maybe we can send a message to Verant that we are tired of losing<br/>
abilties.<br/>
