start, and you die before you can complete the transaction.<br/>

I don&#39;t have Hide, so I can&#39;t speak for that, but I thought Sneak was the<br/>
skill that allowed invisible questing and purchasing.  Could be wrong<br/>
there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This surprises me.  Kunark is a bit tough for teens and under (mostly due<br/>
to travel danger, as there are places that would be good once you get L12<br/>
and can bind), but once you&#39;re high enough level to even have<br/>
Illusion:Iksar, it&#39;s a fine place. I&#39;ve been having a blast killing<br/>
goblins, sarnaks, forest giants, brutes, cacti, etc. in the Overthere,<br/>
Warslik&#39;s Woods, and Lake of Ill Omen with my L25 necro.<br/>
