<div id="ygrps-yiv-410495217">The great debate. Charm is wonderful for controlling a bad situation, but it<br/>
can be very dangerous to use solo (very effective when it works).  A Charm&#39;s<br/>
duration, as I understand it, is a random time determined when you cast on a<br/>
critter and based your the critter&#39;s level, your level and your CHR.  Every<br/>
&quot;round&quot; there after the critter get a &quot;roll&quot; to see if they break the charm<br/>
(again based on their level, your level and your CHR).<br/>
<br/>
There is no set length however.  I experimented with Orc Pawns in EC when I<br/>
was around level 16.  I have about a 110 CHR at the time (not very good by<br/>
the way).  Duration was everything from 2 seconds to 5 minutes.<br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m level 12 and I just got Charm and I&#39;m wondering if the duration will<br/>
&gt; increase as I go up in level?  I know charisma is an important factor<br/>
&gt; for this spell, and right now, with all my charisma gear on I have about<br/>
&gt; 99 chr.  Right now Charm only lasts a few seconds, not long enough to do<br/>
&gt; anything useful with it..  Should I just hold on to it for a few levels<br/>
&gt; and use it later?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
