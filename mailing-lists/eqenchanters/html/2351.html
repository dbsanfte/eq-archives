<div id="ygrps-yiv-78530780">from the GetPaid4 members agreement:<br/>
<br/>
      NO SPAM; DAMAGES <br/>
      GetPaid4 reserves the right to terminate any account which it believes, in its sole discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise responsible for any spam or other unsolicited bulk e-mail, including, but not limited to, instant messages, chatrooms, newsgroups, ICQ and IRC. Any account which is terminated for violating this provision of the terms of use will not be paid for any amounts due at the time of termination or thereafter and may not be allowed to participate in the Service or any other future GetPaid4 online community. In addition, because damages are often difficult to quantify, if actual damages cannot be reasonably calculated then you agree to pay GetPaid4 liquidated damages of five dollars ($5.00 U.S.D.) for each piece of spam or unsolicited bulk e-mail transmitted from or otherwise connected with your account, otherwise you agree to pay GetPaid4&#39;s actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. <br/>

        I&#39;ve found an intriguing new method for making money simply for being at <br/>
    your computer. I know a lot of sites like this have catches, but this one has <br/>
    worked for me and can work for you.<br/>
        Its easy. You just sign up at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.getpaid4.com/?soulsmiter">http://www.getpaid4.com/?soulsmiter</a> and <br/>
    open an advertisement bar when you are online.<br/>
<br/>
    -Up to $30 a month for being online.<br/>
    -Added to that is a % of what people you have referred earn (This is where <br/>
    lots of money is can be earned).<br/>
    -Surprisingly no limit to how many people you can refer.<br/>
    -The tree of referrals goes down 7 levels! <br/>
    -This means you get money from the people you refer and the people they refer <br/>
    and so on.<br/>
    -Remember, the internet pays well for advertisement; you might as well take <br/>
    advantage of it :)<br/>

    Amazingly, someone I know makes $10,000 a year from his referall network. <br/>
    This is an opportunity that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked.<br/>
