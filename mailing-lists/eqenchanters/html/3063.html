<div id="ygrps-yiv-300893195">Hi,<br/>
does anyone have a guide/know of a website which lists spells and their <br/>
relations?<br/>
For example &quot;Mesmerize &gt; Enthrall &gt; Mesmerization &gt; Entrance&quot;.... it&#39;d just <br/>
be useful to know which spells are upgrades of other spells...  this is <br/>
semi related to an earlier post I made :o)<br/>
I&#39;m sort of thinking about setting up a website with cross-references for <br/>
all the spell lists... so you have one page with them listed by lvl, <br/>
another with them listed by relation (as above), another with them listed <br/>
by their outcome (ie a list of stun spells, buffs, debuffs etc).  This may <br/>
have already been done... if anyone knows of such a site, please let me know?<br/>
Thanks :o)<br/>
