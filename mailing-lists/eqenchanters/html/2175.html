<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026760124">I have also noticed a big difference in prices on different servers.  Example:<br/>
On Brell Serilis the Stein of Mogguk goes for 250 to 300pp on Antonica (more<br/>
exensive on the other continents).  On Nameless I saw someone auctioning the<br/>
Stein for 150pp on the Faydwer continent.  I&#39;d be curious to see what price<br/>
differences are with the jewlrey.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I know this is a sensitive subject and ultimately subject to what server<br/>
&gt; you are on and the prices accepted by the general public on that server.<br/>
&gt; However, so as to not undersell my product to the populace of Norrath, can<br/>
&gt; anyone give me a general guide for items made and lowest price you would<br/>
&gt; sell them for? I realize Silver may not sell for much on the established<br/>
&gt; servers and on PVP+ they would rather kill you for your wears, as if you<br/>
&gt; would sell them anyway. I am merely looking for a &quot;suggested retail price&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Also what zones result in the best prices?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another thing that I saw was that Jewel Craft caps at 200 with Gold being<br/>
&gt; Trivial then. Is this true? I thought there was no cap on trade skills.<br/>
