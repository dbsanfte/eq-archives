<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950616024">Thanks for your post but I too respectfully disagree.  Many locations in<br/>
the game are frustrating to play and are crowded not because people<br/>
think it&#39;s a fun place to be but instead are there simply to collect as<br/>
many copies of an expensive item or as much loot as possible.  I would<br/>
have loved to hunt North Ro when I was growing up but it was soooooo<br/>
crowded I went elsewhere.  Our group would attack a derv and someone<br/>
else would cast a spell for 80 or 100 damage cutting us out.  If those<br/>
who are there are getting experience from killing the dervs then great<br/>
but if they are there for easy loot and the creatures are green then not<br/>
so great.<br/>
<br/>
Another trend I&#39;m seeing on Povar now that the server has been around<br/>
for a little bit are new characters that are totally buffed out with<br/>
extremely high end magic weapons, magic items, and plate armor.  Is this<br/>
wrong?  Depends on how you play the game and is probably fun for some<br/>
people.  But I think much of the challenge goes out of the game.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been in a couple of groups now where people weren&#39;t interested in any<br/>
turns to loot because they just were there to kill, kill, kill for<br/>
experience.  Wrong?  Again, if it&#39;s fun for you then no.  It certainly<br/>
doesn&#39;t ruin my time but to me it seems to make the process of leveling<br/>
hollow.<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
First I need Brad McQuaid&#39;s E-mail address, if you have it, please post<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not one to start a campaign and have never tried so, as they say<br/>
this is<br/>
a first.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how many of you keep up with changes that are getting ready<br/>
to<br/>
be made to the game, most are great and well needed, but one has me a<br/>
little<br/>
worried.  Its the change to help control the Camping in the game.  Now<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
get me wrong this need to be looked at and fixed and I think they are on<br/>
the<br/>
right path, but I have one big issue with it... read what he has to say<br/>
at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqss.stratics.com/">http://eqss.stratics.com/</a> June 3rd.  Go to the 2nd set of red text<br/>
titled<br/>
Anti-Camping Update from Verant and come back here to hear what I have<br/>
to<br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
O.K. So now you have read it.  I&#39;m sure you have you own idea how this<br/>
is<br/>
going to affect you, but here is my issue with this. Limiting it to one<br/>
item<br/>
is bad in this way, I am not a camper that sits for hours to get an item<br/>
to<br/>
sell, I hunt to get my item and stay so my group gets what they came for<br/>
too.  Because these items are hard as hell to get ( had to sit 3 days to<br/>
get<br/>
a Blood Stained tunic) if I happen to see another for sell, I&#39;m going to<br/>
buy<br/>
it so I can have a spare.  Why do you need a spare, you ask?  Simple.<br/>
Bodies<br/>
still vanish and Varent HATES (taking 4 days and massive mailing to get)<br/>
to<br/>
restore bodies from backup tape. Bodies still vanish for no good reason<br/>
and<br/>
they want to give 25th and higher level people crap replacement kits.<br/>
There<br/>
are legitimate ways to  loose your body too.  Deep lava pits to name<br/>
one.<br/>
We should be allowed to keep a spare of some thing in the bank if we<br/>
wish.<br/>
Brad&#39;s plan would be great if it allowed you to have two of the item and<br/>
no<br/>
more until you sold or lost one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Help me show him that two is the way to go with this.  Camping by super<br/>
powerful people so they can sell tons of these items because there is a<br/>
false supply and demand needs to be dealt with... allowing us to have<br/>
two of<br/>
a lore item will be just as good as allowing only one in this matter.<br/>
But,<br/>
allowing two will help protect you from spending hours if not days<br/>
replacing<br/>
item when lost.  That item could be as close as the bank.<br/>
<br/>
Any feedback would be gladly accepted, but please post it, do not send<br/>
directly to me.<br/>
<br/>
I thank you in advance for your help.<br/>
<br/>
Scott<br/>
