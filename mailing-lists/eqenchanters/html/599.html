<div id="ygrps-yiv-725350281">[Darrin King] Firstly: Congrats on the level!  I have about 3 Enchanters and<br/>
they are a tough class to level, but I&#39;m sure we all know that.  <br/>
 <br/>
 Finally made it to level 8(half bubble up, half bubble down for 4 hours)<br/>
and started looking for Mircyl&#39;s Animation Pet spell.<br/>
<br/>
Is it True you can only get this spell at High Hold Pass?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
[Darrin King] From what I&#39;ve been told, aye.  I do know that many Enchanter<br/>
spells are spread out, and that some can only be found in Neriak or Erudin,<br/>
but apparently I&#39;ve heard that Mircyl&#39;s is in High Hold.. grrrr</div>
