 Subject: Re: Enchanting Item Spells<br/>
 <br/>
 The MUDs I worked on and played had two weapon enhancement skills that would <br/>
be interesting to see implemented.  One was Inset.  This was a cross between <br/>
jewelcraft and black smithing as it allowed you to inset a stone in to a <br/>
weapon to imbue the weapon with the magical properties of the stone.  The <br/>
other was simply Enchant Weapon, which was a level dependent damage enhancer. <br/>
 As I recall the goal was to win a quest so an immortal would enchant your <br/>
(non-magical only) weapon and then you could inset the Purple Shard from the <br/>
Purple Snorklewacker.  Now that was fun!<br/>
 <br/>
By the way Lottie, is there any chance you do configuration management for a <br/>
large tech company in the Southwest?<br/>

	On the subject of an Enchantment Series of spells. Having run RPGs <br/>
for over 20 years and helping design a couple as well, everyone has to <br/>
remember one highly important word. BALANCE. Classes have to be balanced so <br/>
no one has a major edge over another. Spells have to be balanced for the same <br/>
reason. Weapons, Armor, etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
	Personally, I wouldn&#39;t mind a &quot;true&quot; full set of enchantment spells <br/>
fitting in with what Verant already has in place. However, this would require <br/>
some additional work on their part beyond the simple addition of the spells <br/>
to the Enchanter&#39;s spell book. The current beginnings of the Enchant Series <br/>
is for use for a specific Trade Skill, and that Trade Skill only. <br/>
Furthermore, these spells are gained at 8, 16, 24, and 34, giving a 8, 8, 8, <br/>
and 10 level spread between acquiring as most Enchanters know. With a full <br/>
Enchant Series of spells Verant could include other Trade skills also, thus <br/>
keeping with their &quot;Enchant for Trade Skills only&quot; basis that they have <br/>
already established with their current base of spell options.<br/>
	These could include, but are not limited to:<br/>
<br/>
		(ALCHEMY) (Too recently implemented for me to talk to enough <br/>
Shamans to get a good idea on this one):<br/>
<br/>
		(BAKING): Enchant Food:<br/>
			Baking isn&#39;t one of the Trade Skills I&#39;ve practiced <br/>
yet, but food that last longer then over the counter, or has temporary <br/>
Statistic altering included would certainly perk up my ears. Not to mention <br/>
that their could suddenly be lines forming at the ovens for a chance to make <br/>
an Ogre Cookie that could offer +1 STR for 20 minutes (avg. duration of a <br/>
midlevel buff spell). Better Bakers would be making better items then the <br/>
Cookie and reap the benefits of higher alterations.<br/>
<br/>
		(BLACKSMITHING) Enchant Ore:<br/>
			From the Norrath Book, Guide to Blacksmithing, <br/>
&quot;Talented Blacksmiths can create weapons, armor, and other useful items.&quot;<br/>
			In reality, those same Talented Blacksmiths can <br/>
create Studs, Steel Bonings, Large Lanterns, Baking Parts, Sewing Kits, and <br/>
Banded Armor. (The Lockpicks [for Rouges] and Toolbox [for Tinkering] <br/>
formulas are still bugged). And the Skill is capped at 175 (I&#39;ve heard). Even <br/>
if the &quot;Talented Blacksmiths can create weapons&quot; isn&#39;t implemented, magical <br/>
Studs, Bonings, and Banded for Armor would still be helpful to the Trade <br/>
Skill use. Simple increase in Armor Class, or reduced weight, or a <br/>
combination of both would be helpful to those who buy the armor (Druids, <br/>
being limited to nonmetal, and Rangers/Rouges, being limited to Banded until <br/>
they can get Rubicite, others are truly just limited by their income to the <br/>
best of my knowledge, however, I could be wrong not having played every class <br/>
yet). Or perhaps even a small magical effect, giving off light equal to that <br/>
of a fire beetle would make Humans happy to not have to carry a fir beetle <br/>
eye and make corpse finding in the dark easier for them.<br/>
			And for the far off day when those &quot;Talented <br/>
Blacksmiths&quot; finally get the ability to craft Plate and Weapons, after the <br/>
Skill has more work completed on it, the same effects could be carried over, <br/>
or new ones added at the discretion of the development team.<br/>
			For those asking, &quot;Why Enchant Ore and not just <br/>
Enchant the Metal Sheets they use to make Banded?&quot;; As a GM I have no problem <br/>
forcing a player to make an extra skill check even if for a trivial item like <br/>
making Sheets out of the Ore they use for their craft if it will drain some <br/>
loot out of the economy, they are bound to fail sometime. Also, Enchant Ore <br/>
allows magical Studs and Boning to be made where Enchant Metal would not. <br/>
(That whole &quot;Balance and sense of fair play thing.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
		(BREWING) Enchant Brew:<br/>
			Not a lot of experience with Brewing. (Even less <br/>
planned after it got crushed in a recent patch.) But I&#39;m sure there are a few <br/>
Brewmasters out there that would gladly make suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
		(FLETCHING) Enchant Wood Staff:<br/>
			A Runed Oak Bow is mentioned in The Official Player&#39;s <br/>
Guide, but no Fletcher has the slightest idea of how to get a Bow Staff made <br/>
into a magical item, and we don&#39;t have the ability at this time. The <br/>
resulting completed Bow (with a higher difficulty rating then making a normal <br/>
bow, of course) could hit for 1-2 more damage or in line with Verant&#39;s &quot;any <br/>
altering to a bow decreases Attack Delay and Damage&quot; base, reduce both Damage <br/>
and Delay Ratings on a completed Bow in addition to any bought materials from <br/>
merchants. Oak, as the first wood that can be double cammed, would be the <br/>
minimum affected, and Ceramic and Steel Bow Staves need to be implemented to <br/>
be fair to high skill Fletchers.<br/>
<br/>
		(POTTERY) (No ideas):<br/>
<br/>
		(TAILORING) (SEE BLACKSMITHING):<br/>
			Another possibility for this Skill could be Enchant <br/>
Pelt with similar results as suggested in Blacksmithing.<br/>
<br/>
		(TINKERING) ?:<br/>
			Any Gnomes out there know if this is even implemented <br/>
yet? Or in working order, if so?<br/>
<br/>
	The above ideas are merely fitting in with Verant&#39;s current &quot;Enchant <br/>
= Trade Skill&quot; Base and in no way are meant to suggest that further Enchant <br/>
spells should be excluded, (perhaps mirroring the Magician Create Series). <br/>
They ARE meant to fit smoothly in with what is already in place and accepted <br/>
as the norm. Furthermore, they are meant to have no greater impact on the <br/>
backbone of adventuring, COMBAT!, then the current Jewelcrafting Skill <br/>
results.<br/>
<br/>
	Further suggestions and fine tuning are welcome.<br/>
<br/>
	Flames? Well, I know how to hit Delete just as fast as the next guy, <br/>
so don&#39;t bother ;-)</div>
