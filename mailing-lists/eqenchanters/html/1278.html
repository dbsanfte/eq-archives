<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073834811">We need to start a dialog about what we are going to sell the new jewellery<br/>
items for. I guess I will open up by stating what I was selling things for<br/>
last night, and then all of you can comment as to whether it was too high or<br/>
too low, and we will work from there.<br/>
<br/>
	All +2 silver stat boosters : 7p each or 2 for 13p<br/>
	Jade silver rings : 9p each or 2 for 17p<br/>
	Jade electrum bracers : 25p each or 2 for 45p<br/>
<br/>
This being only the 2nd day after the patch, I haven&#39;t tried marketing much<br/>
of the electrum items other than the obvious seller, which is the jade<br/>
bracer. With a skill of 79 I still get failures with electrum, and I am<br/>
trying to repay the guild for the money they pumped into me to raise my<br/>
skill. Please add to this list and comment on prices!</div>
