for an Enchanter.  For mid to high 20s, warsliks and Lake of Ill Omen are<br/>
pretty darned good.  Through the low 30s, I found Cazic to be about the<br/>
right challenge - nothing compares to helping a decent group mow through<br/>
an 8-lizard pull from the upper Tae.  Paw has a few good spots too.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, all of these places seem to have enough traffic that you can<br/>
find pick-up groups.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having trouble now (L35) finding a place as reliable as Cazic for<br/>
challenging pick-up groups.  Sometimes SolB has 2 or 3 groups and it&#39;s<br/>
easy to get into one, sometimes it&#39;s empty.  Crystal Caverns is also<br/>
very good for dungeon design, but spotty for finding a group.  I don&#39;t<br/>
much like Frontier Mountains or Overthere - I find outdoor fighting<br/>
somewhat boring.<br/>
<br/>
Where did everyone go after Cazic?<br/>

&gt; My enchanter is 54th level (not higher mostly due to my casual game-play), and<br/>
&gt; spends a lot of time in the depths of the various Kunark dungeons or doing<br/>
&gt; planes raids.  All quite a bit of fun, but sometimes one needs a break.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, recently, I&#39;ve been playing a Monk twink, and trying some of the places<br/>
&gt; that I never tried as an enchanter.  I have to say, I HIGHLY recommend Upper Guk<br/>
&gt; for someone of your level.  Our party of a warrior, a monk, and a cleric, were<br/>
&gt; able to clean up quite nicely there, and the loot drops are very good as well.<br/>
&gt; With an enchanter, we would have been completely unstoppable.  If your normal<br/>
&gt; party is a paladin, a druid, and an enchanter, you should be able to have a nice<br/>
&gt; little thing going, and with the experience bonus for Upper Guk implemented,<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll see rapid advancement as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Solusek A is also a very good place, but you might want a couple levels before<br/>
&gt; you start adventuring there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And given that the paladins are good tanks at lower levels, you&#39;d likely have<br/>
&gt; little problem with your group of three in either place.  The only obstacle I<br/>
&gt; really see is a lack of GOOD healing in emergency situations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personally, I always find dungeons to be more of a challenge as an enchanter.<br/>
&gt; Adventuring outdoors is usually pretty easy, and it&#39;s not terribly difficult to<br/>
&gt; separate creatures out, and make the true talents of the enchanter a moot<br/>
&gt; point.  Give some good dungeon delving a try, as it will REALLY hone your<br/>
&gt; skills, and show you exactly what an enchanter is capable of.  Single pulls are<br/>
&gt; all nice and good, but don&#39;t really give us a chance to shine.  *smile*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, just some thoughts.<br/>
