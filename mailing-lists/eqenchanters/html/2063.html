<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507039180">I must appologize for my apparent flame.  I know the charm spell for necros<br/>
was crap anyway.  I guess I&#39;m just jealous that my enchanter is wanted so<br/>
much for in a group then my necro is.  But it is alot easier to kite with my<br/>
enchanter then my necro now.  Just charm one mob and set it against another.<br/>
When the one thats being teamed up is dead and your pet is almost dead then<br/>
its very easy to kill it and get exp for both.  And I was hunting in Unrest<br/>
the other night and my life suck wouldnt work on a werebat but the enchanter<br/>
in our group (same lvl as me)had no problem casting on it.<br/>
<br/>
I appologize to the list.<br/>

did you ever try to use it? it was the level 12 enchanter charm spell that<br/>
necros got at 24. that spell couldnt be used to charm any MOB over level<br/>
25. if you cast the spell on a mob over 25, you got a message saying you<br/>
cant do it with this spell. by the time you got the spell at 24, it&#39;s<br/>
useless considering the other spells you got.<br/>
<br/>
and i get sick of necros complaining about how they get resisted just like<br/>
everyone else now. life tap gets resisted now. good. necros were too<br/>
powerful with life tap almost always sticking and being able to kite. now<br/>
they get resisted just like wizzies and mages. i&#39;ve played all 4, and even<br/>
NOW my enchanter STILL gets resisted more.<br/>
