<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536319006">The first stone that yields magic results with silver is Jade.  You<br/>
should NOT just start with jade.  The most cost effective way to build<br/>
your skill is to go from the cheapest stone up to the most expensive. <br/>
With jewlecraft you can increase your skill 2 points per stone before<br/>
being forced to move up to the next level.  The reason it is most cost<br/>
effective to do it this way is that you are more likely to succeed,<br/>
which means you can sell the product back to the vendor for 5% loss or<br/>
less, depending on your Charisma.  I don;t have the game open now<br/>
(obviously) so I can&#39;t tell you which stone to use at skill 25.  You<br/>
can, however, count backwards because I do know the skill levels for<br/>
jade are 37 and 38, Amber is 35 and 36, Rose Quartz is 33 and 34,<br/>
carnelian 31-32, etc.  Count down two points per stone to the level you<br/>
need to use.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
And in case you care, I just got up to skill 36 but I failed my first<br/>
attempt at jade.  Gotta collect 4 more PLat to try again!<br/>

&gt; it seems to me that the first magic rings you can<br/>
&gt; make cost around 2 or 3<br/>
&gt; plats to make.. but I suppose that you can sell them<br/>
&gt; for more...with a base<br/>
&gt; skill of 21, I dont want to waste money making<br/>
&gt; non-magic rings. With which<br/>
&gt; stone do you think I can start practice with? do I<br/>
&gt; have to start from<br/>
&gt; malachite? can I start with Onyx? or even more<br/>
&gt; expensive stones? thanks for<br/>
&gt; the help.<br/>
&gt; Also, can you tell me which rings you found out are<br/>
&gt; the best to sell to<br/>
&gt; players?<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; Honestly, it&#39;s a great idea.  Unfortunately, it<br/>
&gt; takes SO much cash, that<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll have a problem convincing someone to do it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s what I do:  Go wisp hunting.  I have a necro<br/>
&gt; that I team up with<br/>
&gt; in the East and Wect commons.  At 8th level (maybe<br/>
&gt; 4th too, I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; sure) Enchanter pets can hit magic.  :)  With two<br/>
&gt; spellcasters, and two<br/>
&gt; pets, as long as you can pull the wisps one at a<br/>
&gt; time, you shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have any problems.  Also, pulling to a predesignated<br/>
&gt; spot is great,<br/>
&gt; because then as long as your partner can watch you<br/>
&gt; incoming, he can tell<br/>
&gt; you if there&#39;s anything else on you.  Good incase<br/>
&gt; you start a train,<br/>
&gt; then you can zone right away.  :)<br/>
