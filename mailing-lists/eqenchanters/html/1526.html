<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-45955358">Rune is sort of like the enchanter version of a hit point buff.  It<br/>
gives you invulnerability for a certain amount of damage.  I have read<br/>
that Rune 1 is about 125 points of damage.  It will generally last<br/>
until you have been hit for that amount, and then disappears.  When it<br/>
disappears  You start taking normal damage instead of the blow being<br/>
absorbed by your magical shield.  It also seems to go away after a long<br/>
while if you take no damage at all.  I use Rune anytime I&#39;m in new<br/>
territory or I&#39;m doing something risky.  If your group&#39;s healer has run<br/>
out of mana you can cast rune on your tank to keep him alive a bit<br/>
longer.<br/>
<br/>
First spells for reserach require left and right halves of pages 23, 24<br/>
and 26, respectively.  Put each matched pair in the Tome of Endlesss<br/>
Enchantments and combine.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; After almost hitting the delete character key(thank<br/>
&gt; god I didn&#39;t), I finally made it to level 16.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just have a few questions,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When is the Rune 1 spell really worth using? I  cast<br/>
&gt; it on myself and it lasted an incredibly long time<br/>
&gt; Just wandering around. I cast it a second time and<br/>
&gt; as soon as I got into any fighting it wore off very<br/>
&gt; fast. Kind of an expensive spell for the time it<br/>
&gt; lasts. Just looking for some feedback and maybe some<br/>
&gt; situations to use it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Second question is about research. What book to I<br/>
&gt; need to buy? and for the first three spells is there<br/>
&gt; a left and right half to one page? or do I just put<br/>
&gt; one page in ?<br/>
