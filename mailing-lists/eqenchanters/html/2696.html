<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684461729">I&#39;ve been camping the sage in lower guk for his items (cinch cord, got,<br/>
runed cowl no gots yet) and especially the last few days the wan knights<br/>
(level 33-36) seem to have great success resisting my entrance (cha<br/>
171-190). Had another enchanter in there one day and he had the same<br/>
problem. One guy in the group suggested it was related to my level at the<br/>
time (37), but I said no, the yellow and red /con zol&#39;s entrance no problem,<br/>
it&#39;s just the wan&#39;s seem to resist more. At 39 now &lt;cheer&gt;, I am still<br/>
getting resists on the wan&#39;s with entrance, but can charm them without<br/>
difficulty. Are they just one of the tough to crowd control mob&#39;s?<br/>
