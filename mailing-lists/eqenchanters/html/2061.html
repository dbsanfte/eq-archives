&gt; Why was the charm spell useless for Necro&#39;s?  it worked the same as the<br/>
&gt; enchanters, right?  Necro&#39;s over the last couple months have gotten hammered<br/>
&gt; big time.  The charm and fear nerf changes nothing in non PVP situations<br/>
&gt; (which probably counts for 95% of the time).  My necro would be very happy<br/>
&gt; if his DOT&#39;s worked corectly in non PVP, or his life suck, or his Pet, or<br/>
&gt; Feign Death.  Be thankful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The problem with the Necro Charm is that they could only charm creatures that<br/>
are less powerful than their pet.   I haven&#39;t had Dot problems in a long time.<br/>
The resist on life taps and fiegn death do suck though.  My heart goes out to<br/>
you there.<br/>
<br/>
