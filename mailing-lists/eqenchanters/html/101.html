<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480735278">I gave up a level 16 dark-elf necro because their invisibility spell (<br/>
gather shadows ) was very unreliable. One sad evening, coming back from a<br/>
very long quest that brought me to Kerra Island and South Karana, I got<br/>
hacked multiple times in Riverdale losing about 4 bubs of xp because my<br/>
invis wore off on me randomly. I got really pissed off that at level 16, I<br/>
could not manage to cast a level 8 spell reliably and decided to start<br/>
another character more appropriate for travelling since I was very much into<br/>
research and quests.<br/>
With my enchantress, I got invisibility at level 4 and used it some times.<br/>
It always seemed to work great but I might be wrong. Yesterday, I found out<br/>
that this invisibility spell is as bad as gather shadows as a %$#%^^%$<br/>
griffin nuked me a few seconds after I cast invisibility. Since then, I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed the same kind on unreliability...but only since I made level 8...I<br/>
might be wrong.<br/>
Anyway, I would like to know how&#39;s the enchanter&#39;s invisibility like at<br/>
level 16 or 20 or more. CAN YOU COUNT ON IT?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
