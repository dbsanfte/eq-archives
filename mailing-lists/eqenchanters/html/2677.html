 </span></blockquote>What spell quest have you EVER seen that is easier than purchasing the<br/>
same-level spell?  More intellectually rewarding?  perhaps.  Easier?  No<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
1st level spells are expensive without twinking, 8th are expensive, 12th<br/>
mildly expensive.  Aside from those levels, they cost a lot but you should<br/>
be earning a whole lot more than they cost.<br/>
<br/>
However, the time and risk spent on a quest are almost always greater than<br/>
hunting things with good loot and buying the spell.<br/>
