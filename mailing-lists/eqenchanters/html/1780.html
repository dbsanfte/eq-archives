<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292075829">Had to comment about prices, for I&#39;ve found the up and coming jewelcrafter<br/>
charges a little less than usual. Anyway, here are my baseline prices:<br/>
<br/>
Anything with silver 20pp + gem cost (20pp due to I do not wish to work<br/>
with silver, use to charge 10pp)<br/>
with electrum 30pp + gem cost<br/>
with gold 100pp + gem cost<br/>
with plat  400pp + gem cost<br/>
<br/>
All the master jewelers have the same prices pretty much on Rellos Zek. I<br/>
am sure on other servers prices can shift a bit.<br/>

&gt;I have searched back a couple digests, and haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt;found an answer and figured this would be quicker.<br/>
&gt;I am an Enchanter on the Karana server, and have<br/>
&gt;a Jewelery skill lvl of about 41.  I have been <br/>
&gt;making enchanted jeweler for a while, but don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;really have a firm grasp on what kind of base <br/>
&gt;prices I should be charging.  Here is a list of <br/>
&gt;prices I am charging now.  Could I get some<br/>
&gt;feedback on what others are charging, and maybe<br/>
&gt;set up a Merchants Co-operative to set prices for<br/>
&gt;our market on Karana.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;+2 Agility rings 3pp<br/>
&gt;+2 Dexterity Braclets 4pp<br/>
&gt;+2 int rings 5pp<br/>
&gt;+2 strength rings 6pp<br/>
&gt;Jaded Silver rings 7pp<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I usually give up to 1pp off if someone buys 2 at<br/>
&gt;a time.  Just wondering what the rest of you sell<br/>
&gt;for.  I don&#39;t want to undercut the market, but <br/>
&gt;then again I Don&#39;t want to sell to high.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think if we set up a Jewelery Co-operative we <br/>
&gt;may be able to set higher prices for our wares.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
