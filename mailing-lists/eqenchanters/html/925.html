<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-721870240">I think we all should send feedback as well as write up a bug report as to<br/>
the current nerfing of our class. As for a day we do not play our<br/>
Enchanter, BAH! Between people who dont know about the day, or ppl who just<br/>
dont care, there will be Enchanters playing period. What is most important<br/>
is Veriant hears our upset with the most recent changes, send em email,<br/>
send feedback and write up a bug report. The more people that do, the<br/>
chances are something will be done. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing along the same lines, I&#39;d like to know where Veriant is<br/>
telling us of these changes vs. just putting them in and us finding out as<br/>
we play. If anyone know&#39;s please post it.<br/>
