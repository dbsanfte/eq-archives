<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048024915">Have any of you noticed character attributes having a significant<br/>
effect on trade skills?  I have this theory that, perhaps, your str and<br/>
dex ( maybe a few more ) have a very noticable effect on such things.<br/>
<br/>
	This came about after comparing experiences with an Erudin Wizard<br/>
friend of mine using Tailoring.  At the time, I was playing a Monk, so<br/>
both my Str and Dex were significantly better than his, and I seemed to<br/>
be having much greater success than he was, with both Tailoring and Fishing,<br/>
of all things.<br/>
<br/>
	So... as an experiment, i have created a high elf enchanter with<br/>
the following statistics:<br/>
	Str 55 Sta 65 Agl 85 Dex 95 Wis 95 Int 102 Cha 95<br/>
<br/>
	This character operates under the assumption that Str does not<br/>
play a vital role in jewelcraft.  I&#39;ve found the Int to still be within<br/>
reasonable levels, regarding spell use.  (Although I seem to be getting<br/>
more resisted results than I remember from my other high elf enchanter.<br/>
Has anyone noted a Int to Spell resistance correlation?)<br/>
<br/>
	Anyway, I just thought I&#39;d ask around.  It might be worthwhile to<br/>
add, when posting success rates, your character&#39;s stats.  Just a thought, and<br/>
I have seen some stats mentioned on some of the trade skill guides.  Just not<br/>
all of them.<br/>
