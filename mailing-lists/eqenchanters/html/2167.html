<div id="ygrps-yiv-646468612">Last time I had one of these in my hands, they were No Drop. Paladins spawn<br/>
in front of Guk (slowly) and drop these often when they die. If you don&#39;t<br/>
mind the faction hits from good towns and have some friends who don&#39;t mind<br/>
them either (trolls, ogres, and DE non enchanters are great for this), you<br/>
can pull the paladins in the Rathe Mountains (enter from Ferroott, turn<br/>
right, on mesa) that are now used for the paladin armor quests. Very hard to<br/>
pull only one and they vary in level alot (from around 10 to over 20).<br/>
Memory blur can be quite effective to pull only the ones you want. Good loot<br/>
and experience if you don&#39;t mind never being able to enter a &#39;good&#39; town<br/>
again.<br/>
