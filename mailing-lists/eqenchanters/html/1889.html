<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027562752">The real complaint is that I know players who have spent 500p or more<br/>
on a sacrificial dagger for the melee hand and 2000p for the mug.  now<br/>
they&#39;ve wasted money they could have spent elsewhere.  I have no<br/>
concern about the quest being made more difficult.  they should do<br/>
that, indeed.  Changing the nature of an object people have spent their<br/>
entire fortunes on is unfair and will lead to many outraged players.<br/>

&gt; I dotn care weather the stein works or not anymore,<br/>
&gt; the fact is that if you<br/>
&gt; got one then you will still have an item that does<br/>
&gt; plus 10 to int and all<br/>
&gt; the other crap, if you dont have one. well, you<br/>
&gt; should have gotten one<br/>
&gt; before the patch, and you still can, I got 2 of them<br/>
&gt; tonight for the first<br/>
&gt; time ever, took me about 4 hours. but now when it<br/>
&gt; changes into a weapon, who<br/>
&gt; cares, you still have the stats, and show me a<br/>
&gt; weapon that is better???? at<br/>
&gt; least for now that is attainable. basically, stop<br/>
&gt; complaining about it, and<br/>
&gt; go get one already, its not that hard yet, and we<br/>
&gt; cant guess how hard it<br/>
&gt; will be afterwards if we dont know yet.<br/>
