<div id="ygrps-yiv-664482623">I also did really well fighting Scarabs and Tarantulas in North Ro at that<br/>
level.  With a pet and root you should be able to solo the yellows there.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you&#39;re up for the hike (and while you&#39;re at it questing) Try<br/>
blackburrow.  At level 9 I did the Stein of Mogguk quest for the first time.<br/>
To increase my faction in Qeynos (there were a few that would kill me without<br/>
illusions) I fought in Blackburrow until level 10.  With a group you can handle<br/>
the Elite Knoll Guards.  They drop excellent loot and are great exp (they will<br/>
con red to you).  You can also sell in Surefall with illusion wood elf and<br/>
alliance, and get excellent prices.  Sure beats the run back to Qeynos :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you can find a mule to do the Rivervale part of the quest (if you&#39;re<br/>
planning on doing the stein quest that is) Try the halfling camps in Nektulos.<br/>
Great exp, not too much loot though.  You should be able to solo the lowest<br/>
level camp with Soothe and a pet.  If you can get a group try one of the higher<br/>
level halfling camps.  With soothe you will be able to handle them one at a<br/>
time.  (side note:  I killed a LOT of halflings, and when I got my illusion<br/>
halfling at level 12 I wasn&#39;t KOS in rivervale after casting alliance on the<br/>
one NPC that was still threatening to me.  I stopped killing halflings at the<br/>
camps around level 12 though..)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps :)<br/>

&gt; I think the Orc camps in South Ro would be perfect at your level.  With one<br/>
&gt; other person you could hold a camp with out a problem.  When you are ready<br/>
&gt; you can then move right to the near by Derv camp.  The only problem is<br/>
&gt; actually getting there at your level; the North half of So Ro can be<br/>
&gt; dangerous.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Probably been covered plenty of times, I know... .but....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a level 9 enchanter and I&#39;m looking for a few places to level fast<br/>
&gt; without<br/>
&gt; &gt; hurting my faction with Indigo Brotherhood (so Crushbone is out).  I know<br/>
&gt; that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could do the crushbone belt and shoulderpad quest to get some good exp<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; buying the pads, but I&#39;m not really sure if that will hurt my faction or<br/>
&gt; not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I really want to get to 12 (Charm  woo hoo).<br/>
