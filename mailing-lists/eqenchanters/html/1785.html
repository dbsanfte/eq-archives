<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102232362">The cause of the problem is too much supply and jewelcrafters willingly<br/>
selling too cheaply.  I tried to sell some +2 str rings for 10p a pair or 1<br/>
for 6p and I finally had to stop putting the price on my auction because the<br/>
only response I was getting was either very rude &quot;ya right loser. no one<br/>
will pay that&quot; or somewhat rude &quot;lol, your competitors have much better<br/>
prices&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Some nights it&#39;s fun but I&#39;m pretty much sick of it to be honest.  People<br/>
are so much more rude lately and it&#39;s almost not worth it to sell silver<br/>
anymore.<br/>

Thank you every one for your input on jewelery<br/>
prices.  I wish I could get prices like Rallos Zek<br/>
on Karana.  I have trouble getting 5pp for int rings<br/>
and 7pp for Jaded silver.   I seen a Jaded silver<br/>
for sale by a NPC merchant and the price was close<br/>
to 14 or 15 pp.  I think we should be able to match<br/>
NPC prices pretty close, but on Karana, everyone<br/>
wants really cheap stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to recover your failed attempts this way.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder if we can do anything about this.  Any ideas<br/>
Karana players?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks agian for all your ideas and input on the trade.<br/>
