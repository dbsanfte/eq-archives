<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566620146">Most EQ webpages dedicated to enchanting seem to be in debate over this<br/>
issue.  I have seen none suggesting Int and Wis are involved.  As of<br/>
right now its ovbiously a mystery.  Either the formula is complex, with<br/>
multiple factors, or so bugged that noone can tell for sure.  Please try<br/>
and be a little more open of differing opinions, and a little less<br/>
convinced that you are right and everyone else is wrong.<br/>

You guys who think charisma affects spells in any way obviously are<br/>
newbies because if you had read any eq web pages<br/>
you;d know it only affects the way towns, merchants, guards and others<br/>
view you.  the only thing its good for is<br/>
Merchant prices higher CHA = Lower prices for you and Higher prices when<br/>
u sell.<br/>
I believe Int or Wis is what affects the chance of resisting<br/>
