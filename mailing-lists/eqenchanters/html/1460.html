<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-7963460">me too! i got 25 at the aviaks, ran to permafrost to meet 2 other people. i<br/>
got killed twice, once right after getting my corpse the first time, buy<br/>
trains that ran by me and expressly came back to get ME (ignoring the<br/>
cleric and monk in my party). i lost a bubble and the level, but luckily<br/>
the exp is good there and i got it back quick... <br/>
<br/>
i still think SOMETHING got jacked from the patch...<br/>

&gt;seemed to be coming after me.  In a group of 5 players I was the sole<br/>
&gt;target of interest.  Two big ugly deaths after the patch.<br/>
