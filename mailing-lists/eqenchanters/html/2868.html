<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-750060423">While I have a list of forums that have a lot of useful info, it&#39;s a bit difficult,<br/>
as an enchanter, to find relavent bits, especially considering it&#39;s originally<br/>
rogue based... <br/>
<br/>
I searched high and low for a decent EZBoard enchanter forum, and could find<br/>
none.. <br/>
<br/>
First, if anyone knows of one (I know there are non-ezboard ones, like castersrealm,<br/>
etc, but they have various problems, the main one being they are all blocked<br/>
by my firewall.  ;)  ), please let me know...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, in an attempt to fill this void, I&#39;ve started a basic forum to do<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It is entirely default ATM, if a few people start visiting it, I&#39;ll add a bit,<br/>
and if it looks useful, I&#39;ll go all out.  I think that info will still show<br/>
up here and other places (and should, as I have kept up on the other classes<br/>
quests because it&#39;s both useful info, interesting, and sometimes information<br/>
from quests mix together), but if we could have a place more specific to enchanters,<br/>
instead of feeding off the few relevant posts on sites not dedicated to the<br/>
class, it would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Again, we&#39;ll see where it goes... if nothing else, I have quiet a bit of knowledge<br/>
about EQ, enchanters, and a few other things, so could at least share info with<br/>
a few people if it doesn&#39;t take off.  :)  Or learn something myself...<br/>
<br/>
For now, the biggest issue is obviously this quest.. I&#39;m going to post what<br/>
I&#39;ve learned from scouring various sites (which is one reason I did this...<br/>
there was no site that has all this info on it, in one place) there soon...<br/>
it&#39;ll be a good spot, for now, to find all relevant known info.<br/>
<br/>
*shrug*  We&#39;ll see.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see a few of you there.</div>
