<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805896474">Hehe, this is quite the thread I started.<br/>
<br/>
As the magnet I am, I was adventuring in BlackBurrow.  Eventually I meet up<br/>
with a few not so friendly gnolls who like to show me their pointy claws.<br/>
Usually the result of a train someone else brought in.  I then try to cast<br/>
color flux and most of the time I can cast it even when attacked by a few<br/>
of them.<br/>
<br/>
During the time I try to cast color flux I don&#39;t actually fight back<br/>
1) I won&#39;t do any considerable damage and<br/>
2) fighting will add me deeper in their hate list<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a good idea<br/>
<br/>
The question is what to do after the color flux spell.  If I don&#39;t tashan<br/>
them first, I usually have a horrible rate of resists.  I usually just run<br/>
around and hopefully they switch targets and most of the time they do.  I<br/>
know this isn&#39;t a good solution.<br/>
<br/>
The question is what do you guys do in a situation such as this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
