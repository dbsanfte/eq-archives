<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820199063">*Has anyone noticed a nerfing of our pets in the past few days? <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I took a hiatus for a few days from my enchanters and when I went back<br/>
in last night I noticed that my pet died VERY quickly, 3 times in a row, 3<br/>
diff. pets.  Each died long before they had in previous days, all vs. equals<br/>
(white) or lessers (blues).  <br/>
