  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font><font face="Arial"
 size="2"></font><br></div><tt><br>I asked myself a question last night that I 
  hope all of you will reply to<br>when I ask it of you.<br><br>Why did you 
  choose the name of your character? What does it mean to you?<br><br>Ok, so 
  that is 2 questions, shoot me. =)<br><br>This thought entered my mind as I sat 
  last night trying to come up with a<br>name for my gnome enchanter. I do not 
  like the name generator that Verant so<br>kindly provides. Answering this 
  question(s) became the real challenge and<br>gave my pixels a minor RP 
  perspective that is truly lacking in this game. I<br>love the game, but the 
  war for XP dominates the minds of 98.9% (&lt;~ note the<br>pun?) of those that 
  subscribe.<br><br>Anyway, what follows is a breakdown of why I chose the names 
  I did. I am<br>intrigued to see the results if all of you did the 
  same.<br><br>Personal history: I have been playing RPs since 73, and picked up 
  WhiteWolf<br>as the dominant favorite since 92.<br><br>Arakine Uktena, Woodelf 
  Druid:<br>Arakine-<br>From the movie Dune. Arakis, desert planet. Paul says at 
  one point &quot;We shall<br>squeeze and squeeze until no Harkonin breathes Arakine 
  air.&quot;.&nbsp; The planet<br>itself is a desert filled with danger, yet has the 
  potential to become a<br>lush garden paradise.<br>Uktena-<br>American Indian 
  tribe, and a tribe of Werewolves from WhiteWolf&#39;s &quot;Werewolf:<br>the 
  Apocalypse!&quot;. Violent, bloody bastards that guard the spiritual foci 
  and<br>are the closest to the 
  Spirits.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Uthanatos, Gnome 
  Enchanter:<br>No last name yet, but I will have a while before I need to worry 
  about it.<br>;-)<br>From WhiteWolf&#39;s &quot;Mage: the Ascension&quot;, Euthantos.&nbsp; A 
  Tradition of mages<br>that believe death should come to all. They are to help 
  others to meet Death<br>when they try to avoid it and have nothing left to 
  give, or to preserve Life<br>when their existence still has something to 
  contribute to those around them.<br>Also called Death Mages.<br><br>This may 
  apply to Necromancers, but to me the Enchanter class is the true<br>embodiment 
  of the Euthanatos. They can ultimately control the outcome of<br>almost any 
  battle so that the &quot;Life&quot; of the party is preserved (by being<br>competent) or 
  they can hasten the grip of Death upon his fellows (by 
  being<br>inept).<br><br><br>Well, there you have it. One step closer into the 
  mind of Me. Reply if you<br>wish, I for one would enjoy reading 
  it.<br><br>--<br>Arakine<br>Fennin<br><br>aka<br><br>--<br>Uthanatos<br>Fennin<br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
