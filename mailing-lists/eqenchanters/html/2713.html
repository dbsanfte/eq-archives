Well, you are probably right about killins sarnaks as I havent killed many<br/>
of them myself (I just remembered there was good faction involved with<br/>
them).  Where are you turning in the watcher torches?  I carried a couple of<br/>
backpacks around with me, hoping there was someplace in Calibis that I could<br/>
turn them in, but alas Calibis is overrun with crusaders and they didnt take<br/>
kindly to my presence.  I&#39;d also be interested in what factions there are in<br/>
Calibis, although I&#39;ve heard that the bone chip collecting trooper is a good<br/>
friend of &lt;all&gt; the internal Calibis factions.<br/>
<br/>
Also, have you tried turning in 4 stacks of 4 bone chips?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not only goblins, but sarnaks as well... both will increase your<br/>
&gt; &gt; Firona Vie faction, as well as your factions with the Legions of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Calibis (Iksar Troopers).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are you sure?  I&#39;ve spent a lot of time with my gnecro (level 24 - 29, in<br/>
&gt; fact) killing goblins and sarnaks in Warsliks, Overthere, and Lake of Ill<br/>
&gt; Omen.  Goblins give Firona Vie and Legion of Cabilis, Sarnaks give me ONLY<br/>
&gt; Cabilis faction.  This may vary in other zones however, or there may be<br/>
&gt; some limit at work where I can&#39;t get any more FV faction from Sarnaks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re just after faction to get to dubious with the troopers, a good<br/>
&gt; place is the newbie area in Warsliks Woods (SE part of zone).  lots of<br/>
&gt; goblin whelps, scouts, and watchers - just run around taking a whack at<br/>
&gt; each and letting your pet finish the job.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, even after that and with Alliance cast, the guards are still<br/>
scowling.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any ball-park figure on how MANY kills are needed?  I&#39;d really like<br/>
&gt; &gt; to turn in the couple of dozen brains and torches.  ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It took about 250 (wild guess) to get to dubious with the Troopers.<br/>
&gt; Since then I&#39;ve killed another hundred fifty or so goblins and sarnaks,<br/>
&gt; turned in 2.5 backpacks full of bone chips and over a hundred watcher<br/>
&gt; torches.  I&#39;m now amiable to the troopers, dubious to at least some<br/>
&gt; vendors, and still ready to attack by the crusaders.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard third-hand reports of people turning in 1500 and 2000 bone<br/>
&gt; chips before being non-KOS to the crusaders.  This isn&#39;t too surprising,<br/>
&gt; as it&#39;s a 4-at-a-time &quot;quest&quot;, so that&#39;s only 500 points of faction.<br/>
