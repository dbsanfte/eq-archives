<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013200639">I got 2 skill points with carneilan.  Up until jade, or perhaps the<br/>
stone just before Jade, you can get 2 points per stone before it<br/>
becomes trivial, assuming you have used the previous stone up to<br/>
trivial.  I belive at Jade or Amber you can start getting 3 points per<br/>
stone.  Jade became trivial for me at skill 40.  I put 21 practice<br/>
points into the trade before starting.<br/>

&gt; ONE point raised into jewelcraft.  After sinking<br/>
&gt; over 50 plat in making stupid wedding rings, and not<br/>
&gt; seeing any improvement (no, it did not give me the<br/>
&gt; &quot;trivial&quot; message) I decided that I was probably<br/>
&gt; wasting my time, but I continued and changed gems<br/>
&gt; for a little variety.  Star Rose Quartz started<br/>
&gt; raising my skill quickly, then became trivial, then<br/>
&gt; I moved to Amber and silver, and kept raising my<br/>
&gt; skill, then jade, when my money ran out (ya I sold<br/>
&gt; everything back except my magic jade rings, gonna<br/>
&gt; sell them to PCs). I<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; figure if I hadn&#39;t made any carnelian, I would be<br/>
&gt; around skill level 43, but I am at skill lvl 37.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Moral...  DONT make Carnelian Wedding Rings if you<br/>
&gt; want skill, I think its a bug and you don&#39;t get any.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If anyone has gotten skill from Carnelian and<br/>
&gt; Silver, please reply...<br/>
