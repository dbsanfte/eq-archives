&gt;So what do they look like?  Will they just say Velishoul&#39;s Page 3? What<br/>
&gt;can we expect here?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The research items we use look like a page that has been tworn down the<br/>
middle, leaving the right or left half, you need both halves in order to<br/>
attempt to combine them. We also use tombs that have page numbers, they<br/>
look like a full page. They are combined in sequence, ie. tomb pages 8 and<br/>
9 are needed to attempt a combine of them to make a spell that can be scribed.<br/>
As for other classes, necro&#39;s use words, so do magicians and wizards use<br/>
runes.<br/>
