<div id="ygrps-yiv-538701365">Nope,  I&#39;ve successfully enthralled what&#39;s on the stage from a distance<br/>
with no problem.  It helps when we&#39;re initially breaking the room. :)  I<br/>
also use Tashani to pull off the stage as well. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be playing again tonight, so I&#39;ll let you guys know how it goes. :)<br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it though in the preacher room if you walk on the stage it will<br/>
cause the Preacher not to spawn, Is this true?  He only spawned twice all<br/>
day yesterday (and my group was very careful not to walk on the stage.<br/>
heh).  Any truth in this? :)<br/>

.I was about to say..  The dias that the Preacher and Placeholder spawn on my<br/>
.cause you problems.  Maybe you&#39;re getting the &quot;You cannot see your target.&quot;<br/>
.message?  I&#39;ve used Mesmerization from a loooong way off.<br/>

.&gt; I&#39;ll definately do that. :)  It might have been the hilly terrain I was on<br/>
.&gt; interferring with the distance factor.<br/>
.&gt; We&#39;ve been breaking the spawn in the preacher room good enough that the<br/>
.&gt; preacher (when and if he spawns) is usually up there alone when he spawns.<br/>
.&gt; It&#39;s the fun pulls from back stage, and the other rooms around us that<br/>
.&gt; sometimes get a little big. :)  I suppose I could back up toward the stage<br/>
.&gt; a bit for those though..  I&#39;ll play with it a bit more and see how it<br/>
.&gt; goes. :)<br/>
.&gt;<br/>
.&gt; Thanks for the help!! :)<br/>
