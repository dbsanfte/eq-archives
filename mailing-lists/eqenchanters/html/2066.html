<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-196675324">heh, sorry if my responses are coming off as flames as well, i&#39;m just<br/>
writing these inbetween working so i am goin quick =)<br/>
<br/>
i havent played my necro since the patch, i actually havent played him<br/>
since the kiting nerf. my enchanter was much more needed with my guild so i<br/>
concentrated on him for a long time. it just sometimes befuddles me that<br/>
people say we are too powerful because of our charm and mezzing. if you<br/>
boil down to it, all we CAN do effectively at high levels is crowd control.<br/>
debuff, mez the rest of the MOBs, and charm if there is a huge pull. i<br/>
never nuke anymore, we arent a nuking class.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ll be the first to admit, up until recently, necros have been a solo<br/>
class. but they can be excellent in groups. the DOTs they can stack while i<br/>
mem blur the target so it doesnt go after the necro is a great combo, with<br/>
both our pets beating on it. i can take out yellows with one necro that way.<br/>
<br/>
i am just happy i dont have a PVP enchanter. as much as i am sure i&#39;d find<br/>
a way around the latest nerf, it would be an adjustment to not have charm<br/>
in a fight. does anyone know if charm is on the PVP servers at all? (ie,<br/>
can we still charm MOBs?) if so, charm a mob and have it attack a player if<br/>
that&#39;s possible =)<br/>

&gt;I must appologize for my apparent flame.  I know the charm spell for necros<br/>
&gt;was crap anyway.  I guess I&#39;m just jealous that my enchanter is wanted so<br/>
&gt;much for in a group then my necro is.  But it is alot easier to kite with my<br/>
&gt;enchanter then my necro now.  Just charm one mob and set it against another.<br/>
&gt;When the one thats being teamed up is dead and your pet is almost dead then<br/>
&gt;its very easy to kill it and get exp for both.  And I was hunting in Unrest<br/>
&gt;the other night and my life suck wouldnt work on a werebat but the enchanter<br/>
&gt;in our group (same lvl as me)had no problem casting on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I appologize to the list.<br/>
