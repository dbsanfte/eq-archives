<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751973765">I&#39;ve tried it a bit at 18th against blue mobs (aqua gobs to be specific)<br/>
and found out it was possible. Expect to run a lot more though :).<br/>
<br/>
	The main damage dealer is now our DOT (chocke in that case), and a huge<br/>
amount of color flux. The strategy I used was :<br/>
<br/>
	- Choke the mob to pull it <br/>
	- Tashan it (best if you can do it while the mob is on the way)<br/>
	- Color flux after being engaged<br/>
	- Root then Mez the beast (enthrall looked too expensive). Let DOT do his<br/>
stuff<br/>
<br/>
	Quick med from a safe distance. Once DOT is over, start again or use San<br/>
warp & wpn to end its misery. Since I was in cauldron I couldn&#39;t use fear<br/>
or chase the moon strategy for obvious reasons. The important spell is<br/>
color flux as its so fast you can use it even engaged (but make sure you<br/>
are not attacking the beast though). <br/>
<br/>
	Of course there is still the old reliable Charm to use if you can spot two<br/>
blue beasts nearby. The charmed mob then act as our pet. And flux can help<br/>
if it wears off.<br/>
<br/>
	Things which can go wrong : <br/>
- Other mobs engage you. Flux and run like hell<br/>
- Mob unroot while you med and decides to go see someplace else<br/>
<br/>
	As I started this I would like to emphasize again the loss of pet line is<br/>
only something I came up with as an example should Verant decides to take<br/>
something out of us in exchange of a meaningful &#39;enchantment&#39; line of<br/>
spells and ask us our view. Better offer Verant something we -players-<br/>
discussed first hand before crying foul after they put new code into place. <br/>

&gt;Just for the sake of discussion then: Can an enchanter solo without a pet?<br/>
&gt;at all levels? and If so, with what tactics? What have you all tested?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wouldn&#39;t be willing to loose the extremely useful pet series of spells<br/>
&gt;until I can figure out how to make up for the loss of the &quot;baby tank&quot; in<br/>
&gt;combat. To me it is what makes soloing bearable. Lets face it, while I would<br/>
&gt;prefer to be in a group, there are times where it is either solo or don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;play.<br/>
