<div id="ygrps-yiv-569122226">So alteration seems to be the suggestion.  I accidently specialized in<br/>
alteration and was upset till I read this thread.  Now I see it makes sense.<br/>
One thing I haven&#39;t seen mentioned though is that from my experience (and<br/>
that of a Shaman friend) you must put 1 point into each specialization<br/>
discipline before any of them will go up.  My friend put a point only in the<br/>
one he wanted and never saw an increase until he took my advice and put<br/>
point into all the others.<br/>
 <br/>
If you think about it though this makes sense.  You should specialize in<br/>
whatever you do the most which is determined by your style.  So, as you cast<br/>
your most common spell for your style you will get increases in that<br/>
specialization.  I cast Tashani ro pull and during battles when I&#39;m mezing<br/>
so that was my most common spell.<br/>

<br/>
Ok where do I specialize in. I know people have there own thoughts on what<br/>
to do. If you could please tell me what you think and why. So that way I can<br/>
make a good choice I wont regret! <br/>
 <br/>
I will thank you now for your help! <br/>
