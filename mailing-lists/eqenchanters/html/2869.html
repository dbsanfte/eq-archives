  Forum</div>
  <div><br></div><br>
  <p><tt>While I have a list of forums that have a lot of useful info, it&#39;s a 
  bit difficult,<br>as an enchanter, to find relavent bits, especially 
  considering it&#39;s originally<br>rogue based... <br><br>I searched high and low 
  for a decent EZBoard enchanter forum, and could find<br>none.. <br><br>First, 
  if anyone knows of one (I know there are non-ezboard ones, like 
  castersrealm,<br>etc, but they have various problems, the main one being they 
  are all blocked<br>by my firewall.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; ), please let me 
  know...<br><br><br>Otherwise, in an attempt to fill this void, I&#39;ve started a 
  basic forum to do<br>this.<br><br><a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/bhallsofillusion">http://pub28.ezboard.com/bhallsofillusion</a><br><br>It 
  is entirely default ATM, if a few people start visiting it, I&#39;ll add a 
  bit,<br>and if it looks useful, I&#39;ll go all out.&nbsp; I think that info will 
  still show<br>up here and other places (and should, as I have kept up on the 
  other classes<br>quests because it&#39;s both useful info, interesting, and 
  sometimes information<br>from quests mix together), but if we could have a 
  place more specific to enchanters,<br>instead of feeding off the few relevant 
  posts on sites not dedicated to the<br>class, it would be 
  helpful.<br><br>Again, we&#39;ll see where it goes... if nothing else, I have 
  quiet a bit of knowledge<br>about EQ, enchanters, and a few other things, so 
  could at least share info with<br>a few people if it doesn&#39;t take off.&nbsp; 
  :)&nbsp; Or learn something myself...<br><br>For now, the biggest issue is 
  obviously this quest.. I&#39;m going to post what<br>I&#39;ve learned from scouring 
  various sites (which is one reason I did this...<br>there was no site that has 
  all this info on it, in one place) there soon...<br>it&#39;ll be a good spot, for 
  now, to find all relevant known info.<br><br>*shrug*&nbsp; We&#39;ll see.&nbsp; 
  <br><br>Hope to see a few of you there.<br></tt></p></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
