<div id="ygrps-yiv-565938584">Hail,<br/>
I read the post below about our 32nd level friend taking on a level 40 MOB<br/>
by using the illusion &quot;Fire elemental&quot; and was hitting for 80+ points.  I<br/>
have also noticed that when I cast the illusion Human ( I am a High Elf ) I<br/>
lose my ability to see in the dark.  With these observations in hand, am I<br/>
right to assume that we gain the abilities of our illusion as well?  I am<br/>
curious to know if my Wood-elf illusion will give me the ability to<br/>
&quot;forage&quot;.  It may be far fetched, but I have not seen anything being<br/>
discussed on this matter anywhere, &#39;cept for the brief mention of being a<br/>
Fire elemental.  Any input and thoughts on this matter would be greatly<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
