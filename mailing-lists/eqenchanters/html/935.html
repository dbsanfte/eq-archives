<b>Subject:</b> Verant&#39;s business sense <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970917019">has anyone considered the possibility that Verant is &#39;balancing the<br/>
races/classes&#39; in order to slow us from leveling?  By &#39;us&#39; I mean all<br/>
classes, not just enchanters.   As some people are now approaching the<br/>
level cap (50) and may soon stop playing. (once a goal is reached so as<br/>
leveling....although the cap will be raised with the expansion, I have<br/>
read.   The longer we play, the more money they get from us for monthly<br/>
services.<br/>
<br/>
just a thought...<br/>
