<br/>
Pros:  ULTRAVISION.  I love it, it&#39;s so awesome...  Good stats, high<br/>
int, can wear both small and medium, the look cool.<br/>
<br/>
Cons:  Everyone hates them, but being an enchanter, at 4th level you<br/>
start getting the humanoid illusion spells, so that&#39;s not much of a<br/>
problem.  Nerriak is one of the most confusing cities EVER.  And<br/>
Nektulos Forest, right outside Nerriak, is also very confusing, easy to<br/>
get lost in there...<br/>
<br/>
I still wouldn&#39;t change it, though.  I&#39;ve learned the city, and the<br/>
forest (I&#39;m 9th level), and I can travel anywhere with the illusion<br/>
spells.<br/>
