<b>Subject:</b> Question about multiple characters <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108248017">How many of you are playing multiple characters at the same time?<br/>
I played first a dark elf necro up to level 16..<br/>
my main character is now an enchanter level 20..I&#39;ve been playing her a lot<br/>
but since Saturday ( which is when I leveled ) I havent been fighting at<br/>
all, I&#39;m in one of those travelling / meeting people mood.<br/>
Anyway, this morning I started a bard...I dont why ...I completely gave up<br/>
my necro when I started to play my enchanter. I dont want to do that this<br/>
time, but sometimes I get bored and I need something new...<br/>
