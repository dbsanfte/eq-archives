<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-432251216">Mem blur clears your targets memory, but if they are aggressive they are<br/>
just going to go back to attacking.  Now why the hill giant didnt go back to<br/>
attacking you, just tack it up to luck, I ran the whole distance of west<br/>
karana with a hill giant on my tail a couple of times....not fun until after<br/>
you zone<br/>
<br/>
You may want to try cyclops, but use mem blur as a switch, not a last ditch<br/>
effort to run.  Say its pounding the crap out of your rogue, and the cleric<br/>
is doing best he can to heal him.  Really helps to be in tune with your<br/>
group here(not saying you arent, I dont know).  Make sure they understand<br/>
the tactics you are going to use and what to do when you say &#39;&lt;name&gt; STOP&#39;.<br/>
The rogue quits attacking, cast mem blur and your mob will start in on<br/>
whoever starts doing more damage(ie tell any wizzies not to nuke when you<br/>
say this).  Have the rogue to wait a bit for damage to set in before he goes<br/>
back to attacking, you dont wait him back up at the top of the hate list too<br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
Mem blur is also handy to use for your &#39;puller&#39;, since the best puller could<br/>
bring back the mob debuffed and ready to put out of its new found misery,<br/>
but this also sets them top priority on the &#39;things to kill&#39; memo.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure it will work on nonaggresive linked mobs, I find mes/enthrall more<br/>
useful since we are going to attack them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
If you find someone in your group is taking alot more damage then others on<br/>
a regular basis or if you are heading into a long battle, this spell works<br/>
wonders.  A large number of mobs are already aggresive, especially after<br/>
youve killed a number of them, so the tactic of making it think you were<br/>
never there isnt too reliable.<br/>
<br/>
Big warning on using it however, if someone cast a DoT on the mob and you<br/>
mem blur, its just going to die and disappear.  No exp, no body, nothing but<br/>
a bunch of tired and upset adventurers.  This already happens with DoT by<br/>
itself from time to time, but try to keep from using it when the mob is low<br/>
health.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps, hopefully someone will point out any mistakes I have here.<br/>
