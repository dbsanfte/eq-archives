<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259523399">There are a number of places where being hit at the zone border plops you<br/>
somewhere else in the next zone.  Here&#39;s some that I know of:<br/>
<br/>
Unrest to Dagnar&#39;s Cauldron:<br/>
If you are hit on your way out of Unrest you may fall &quot;below&quot; the world.<br/>
You will find yourself in the water under the land which goes around the<br/>
lake.  When this happened to my wife I suggested she swim off the edge.<br/>
Don&#39;t do that!  She fell for 10,000 points of damage and I had to get my<br/>
necro to locate her corpse (which was beneath the land near 0,0).  Without a<br/>
necro we would have never found it.  Meanwhile we had petitioned a GM and he<br/>
was sad when he finally got to us because my wife had already looted her<br/>
corpse otherwise he would have res&#39;ed her.  When the same thing happened to<br/>
me I knew not to swim of the edge but what to do?  I swam to the middle and<br/>
climbed up the island.  Once you do this you can swim back to the land and<br/>
climb up.<br/>
<br/>
Oasis to No Ro:<br/>
If you are hit hard enough (sand giant, etc.) on your way out of Unrest you<br/>
may find yourself near the inn but the kicker is you will fall for some<br/>
small amount of damage.  It&#39;s not much but if you were almost dead you will<br/>
be dead after you fall.  This is a change from a while back where you would<br/>
bounce back into Oasis at full health (which was kind of cool).<br/>
<br/>
Beholder Maze to Runneyeye:<br/>
Had to run from a train that was led into the entrance of Runneyeye.  Got<br/>
hit going through apparently and died.  My corpse was not on either side of<br/>
the zone.  I managed to find it in Runneye in the first alcove to the left<br/>
by the little stream.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know of others?<br/>

On fighting in Lavastorm:<br/>
<br/>
Be very very careful if you are fighting near the entrance to Najena.  This<br/>
has<br/>
happened to me and a friend of mine.  After being ambushed by 3 fire<br/>
elementals<br/>
while looting my corpse (I just got all my armor, but my bags were on my<br/>
corpse)  I ran to the zone to Najena because there was no way I was going to<br/>
live otherwise.  Instead of zoning into the hallway where you&#39;re supposed to<br/>
end<br/>
up, I ended up in a room full of Magicians and pets and was immediately<br/>
killed.<br/>
I had to petition to get my corpse (which took 2 hours).  The GM that helped<br/>
me<br/>
was very nice and pulled my corpse out to safety for me.  When this happened<br/>
to<br/>
a friend of mine the GM&#39;s weren&#39;t quite so nice.  They didn&#39;t believe that<br/>
he<br/>
just zoned in to avoid a monster they believed he was &quot;exploring&quot; in Najena<br/>
(at<br/>
level 12!).  It took him 2 hours of arguing with a GM before he got his<br/>
corpse<br/>
back.  Both GM&#39;s mentioned that this does happen occasionally at that zone<br/>
edge<br/>
(the second GM said my friend&#39;s corpse was on the wrong side of the room :(<br/>
).<br/>
I have no idea if or when they plan on fixing it. :(<br/>
<br/>
Has this happened to anyone else?<br/>
