<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002834408">There are thousands of opinions on the &quot;best way&quot; to go <br/>
about raising your skill and making money at the same <br/>
time.<br/>
My question is this:<br/>
If I do not train more than 5 points into Jewel Craft, <br/>
and raise it by experience instead (for the RP aspect of <br/>
learning hands on :) )is it beneficial to use silver <br/>
bars and Quarts/Malachite to increase skill?<br/>
At level 21 (max trainable at the guild) what gems will <br/>
not help raise JC skill?  <br/>
What is the order of stone progression exactly. ie what <br/>
does &quot;start with Carnelian and work your way up&quot; mean?<br/>
Can you give me a list? Star Rose Quarts, Carnelian, <br/>
Jasper, ?, ?, ?  <br/>
Thanks for reading my frustrated rant.<br/>
<br/>
Off topic, I was in N.Ro last night and I have never had <br/>
as much fun killing Skeles. Before I had to go sell I <br/>
had bagged 18 skeles in 30 minutes as the zone was <br/>
completely cleared and repopped twice. I started with no <br/>
money after just coming from the bank and had 5gp equiv. <br/>
in copper and silver before I had to go sell. I hope to <br/>
do it again tonight. hehe.<br/>
