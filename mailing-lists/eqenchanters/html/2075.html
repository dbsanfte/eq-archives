<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787291616">It has been my experience on VZ that mesmerize and enthrall last about one<br/>
quarter as long maximum against a player as against a NPC. They are alot of<br/>
mana to simply disrupt spell casting. Enchanter DD&#39;s have the worst<br/>
mana-damage ratio in the game because we do so much more (grouped in a<br/>
dungeon I don&#39;t even keep damage spells memorized). Sanity warp is 100 mana<br/>
for a base 143 damage whereas a wizard spell of the same level is 110 mana<br/>
for 180 damage. I can&#39;t see how changing the effect of fear turning a player<br/>
into NPC status would be that hard. And as for charming someone and having<br/>
them attack a deep red, well, don&#39;t tick off an enchanter. I will admit this<br/>
has probably been much abused. Probably less than zone camping (attacking<br/>
someone as they zone, before they have regained control). A week or two ago<br/>
Abashi (GM on VZ) did a broadcast on this. Three people I was grouped with<br/>
at the time each related how this had happenned to them numerous times. No<br/>
one has yet to tell me about being feared/charmed and taken out by PC&#39;s.<br/>
This was an easy fix, not a good one.<br/>

I hesitate to mention this, but at least we still have the<br/>
Mesmerize/enthrall/ect line of spells.  This is our one last bastion of<br/>
effective spells in PvP.  Everyone touch wood now.  I&#39;m really not happy at<br/>
all with these latest nerfs, but I am one gnome and one gnome cannot fight<br/>
verant.</div>
