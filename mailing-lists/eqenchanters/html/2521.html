<div id="ygrps-yiv-905539303"><br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">This refers to a Throwing weapon.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Pine needles are listed as a throwing weapon on the EQItems site (though the database is messed up). &nbsp;Look at the stats for them to see what I mean.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Dam/Delay 1/33</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Weight 0.1</font>
<br>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">This is either a very odd arrow or a throwing weapon.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Essentially it is a light weight pulling weapon only if it is as described.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">I doubt it is worth the trip to find out if this is incorrect. &nbsp;I seem to recall seeing them myself but did not get them. &nbsp;However that was many months ago so not only could I be remembering wrong it could have changed as well.</font>
<br><font size="2" face="sans-serif">I doubt it is a bow though.</font>
