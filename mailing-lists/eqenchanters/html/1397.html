<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647756205">Greetings all!<br/>
<br/>
I am a relatively young Enchanter (level 5) and am seeking some knowledge.<br/>
How do the Illusion spells work?  I have both Illusion:Human and Illusion<br/>
Half-elf and have tested them out briefly.  I am a Dark Elf, so when I<br/>
changed to a human, I lost my Ultravision, making everything pitch black.<br/>
At least the Half-elves get infravision.  My questions are these:  If I<br/>
change to human, do I get the experience point bonus (or rather lose the XP<br/>
penalty for being a non-human)?  I&#39;ve heard that the Illusion spells do not<br/>
mask religious identity.  How safe would I be walking in Freeport with one<br/>
of the illusion spells active?  Would I still be KOS?  <br/>
<br/>
When that Race war server opens up, Enchanters are going to be the assassins<br/>
of Norrath.  Invisibility, charming someone and making them attack their own<br/>
guards, Illusion spells to walk among the enemy unnoticed...<br/>
