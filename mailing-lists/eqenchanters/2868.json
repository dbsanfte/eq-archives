I think that info will still show<br/>\nup here and other places (and should, as I have kept up on the other classes<br/>\nquests because it&#39;s both useful info, interesting, and sometimes information<br/>\nfrom quests mix together), but if we could have a place more specific to enchanters,<br/>\ninstead of feeding off the few relevant posts on sites not dedicated to the<br/>\nclass, it would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, we&#39;ll see where it goes... if nothing else, I have quiet a bit of knowledge<br/>\nabout EQ, enchanters, and a few other things, so could at least share info with<br/>\na few people if it doesn&#39;t take off.  :)  Or learn something myself...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, the biggest issue is obviously this quest.. I&#39;m going to post what<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned from scouring various sites (which is one reason I did this...<br/>\nthere was no site that has all this info on it, in one place) there soon...<br/>\nit&#39;ll be a good spot, for now, to find all relevant known info.<br/>\n<br/>\n*shrug*  We&#39;ll see.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see a few of you there.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
