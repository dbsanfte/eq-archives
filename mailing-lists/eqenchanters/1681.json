I thought of the<br/>\n&gt; problem of there being a sudden surge of magical weapons in norrath and<br/>\nhow<br/>\n&gt; that could completely flood a possible market quite quickly, but I suppose<br/>\n&gt; that could be solved by making enchant : item, ore, weapon very high level<br/>\n&gt; spells, and either a lore item/quest item or in a difficult place (or<br/>\n&gt; unobvious) place to get it.  Then will it make us that much tougher?  Well<br/>\n&gt; you can certainly imagine there will be a few more people interested in<br/>\n&gt; playing enchanters, and personally I think I see enough enchanters now<br/>\n(I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; like to be the only one really).  We&#39;d be in very high demand, but we have<br/>\n&gt; gotten that from some other spells like clarity (IMHO our greatest asset<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; unlike SoW).  Yeas well you can see how scattered my thinking is today so<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m shuttin up.  You can pick that apart.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cogg - Rallos Zek (20)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; btw, what do you think of the last name Zilla?

It is just a continution of<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; &gt; current enchant metals line. It is what our class is about. There are<br/>\nlots<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of jewelcrafters out there that aren&#39;t enchanters, just as there will be<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lot of people who aren&#39;t enchanters crafting magic weapons and armor if<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get the ability to enchant ore in the future. This isn&#39;t an &#39;addition&#39;<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our class, this is finally delivering what was promised...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: XIII [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dlepriol@...\">dlepriol@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 21, 1999 3:18 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [eqenchanters] about the new enchant items (long rant)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: XIII &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dlepriol@...\">dlepriol@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Party pooper, party pooper. Ok you know the song, this time I fill the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; role<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; :).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; May I point out that the message said that the code was going to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; implemented, not that -we- enchanters are going to benefit from it.<br/>\n&gt; True,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it was stated in the book we could do it, but at no time in B4 it was<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effect, and, according to EQE, we received other benefits to make up<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I see it, such thing would overbalance us (enchanters) in regard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other pure spell user classes. So either the benefit will be too small<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even consider it or too huge and Verant might take out something in<br/>\n&gt; return<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to balance our classe again. Don&#39;t tell me we&#39;re nerfed now. We were,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; true,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but that was sometime ago and from my point of view we are rather<br/>\n&gt; balanced<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding other pure spell users. To sum up we have our &quot;niche&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, the idea is: By talking here, and offering Verant options to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consider<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we may have a say in the matter and make our class fuller in the<br/>\n&gt; way -we-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see it. What I would like to see discussed here is : What can we give<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have a &#39;proper&#39; enchantment line of spells?. Or are we just to receive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new ability/spell/line of spells without giving up anything?.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As stated above, I dont think we can&#39;t expect a &#39;useful&#39; line of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enchantment&#39;s spells unless we give up something in exchange. Thinking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Beta, there was a line of spells we didn&#39;t have but nonetheless<br/>\nstill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; managed to survive and prosper : Pet line of spells. Plus they don&#39;t<br/>\nfit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enchanters very well . On the other hand, this line form the very core<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; most of our solo strategies so losing it wouldn&#39;t be a small thing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is just an example, a topic&#39;s starter. Feel free to agree,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disagree<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or tell me to shut up. Once again my aim to to talk things out here<br/>\n&gt; first<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and offer something (petition/ EQE/ you name it) constructive to<br/>\nVerant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before we see something not implemented or half implemented in place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ibnabeth / Karana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still going up<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are you?
