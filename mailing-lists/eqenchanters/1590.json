I had a friend<br/>\n&gt;teleport me to Erudin to buy my spells then I logged out.  I was able to<br/>\n&gt;make a feedback on my first try failed the other 2 times I tried.  If I<br/>\n&gt;remember correctly it is 75 mana.  It is a damage shield if you are hit the<br/>\n&gt;Mob takes 11 damage from what I can see I tried it on a Black Wolf and it<br/>\n&gt;was only able to hit me once so that was the extent of my test on it.  I did<br/>\n&gt;bug the fact that Rune and Agumentation was not stacking but I was having<br/>\n&gt;wierd things happen to me last night so I was hoping that it was just<br/>\n&gt;lastnight and that maybe it does stack but the icon does not show.  I will<br/>\n&gt;try it more tonight though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tGive me a message tonight I will be on about 11:30 pst tonight I can give<br/>\n&gt;you the info on it then.  If you are looking for one I know most of the<br/>\n&gt;higher level Enchanters.  I believe I know someone who has one.  I can find<br/>\n&gt;out if he has one.  I also am looking for a Strip Enchantment if you have<br/>\n&gt;one or know anyone who does.
