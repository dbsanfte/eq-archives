I looted one of a griffin once.  It was a freak<br/>\n&gt; find as I was level 10 at the time.  Was walking along and *pop* this<br/>\n&gt; griffin corpse appears at my feet.  I was looking around trying to figure<br/>\n&gt; out what was going on and *poof* it disappeared.  I was sad till a few<br/>\n&gt; seconds later it reappeared at which point I pounced on it.

I was so excited when the NPC offered me 21p<br/>\n&gt; for the gem so I sold it.  Sigh, didn&#39;t know how rare they are since you<br/>\n&gt; only can find them from loot supposedly.  Anyhow, got one off a griffin.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m guessing the max quality of looted gem is based on the level of the<br/>\n&gt; monster.  No gurruantee you&#39;ll get a good gem but at least possiblity is<br/>\n&gt; there?  So, perhaps other NPCs that are similar level or higher will also<br/>\n&gt; have black pearls?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Azara, Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Scott Davidson Lenker [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slenker@...\">slenker@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 12:13 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] black pearl<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Scott Davidson Lenker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slenker@...\">slenker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hey guys, i was wondering if anyone knew of a vendor that sells black<br/>\n&gt; pearls.  That are supposedly rare, but caster&#39;s realm didn&#39;t include these<br/>\n&gt; on the NPC drops so I was thinking maybe someone sells them.
