Is it because you group all the time? I solo alot do to lag<br/>\n&gt; issues, which makes me unreliable in groups. This makes things tough, but I<br/>\n&gt; find it necessary to be able to rely on my current Rank of spells. This<br/>\n&gt; means keeping all the Spell Abilities maxxed as quickly as possible.<br/>\n&gt; I already see that Enchanters alternate upgrades to DD and Dot spells every<br/>\n&gt; other Rank. That makes for an Interesting combination. I will play around<br/>\n&gt; with that tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Seriously,  I&#39;m currently level 13 with my Enchanter, and I solo frequently<br/>\n(Every morning for about an hour).  I try to group at night, when I have a<br/>\nchance to play at night.  Lag and disconnects also give me headaches (I&#39;ve got<br/>\nto lower my modem speed)  Anyway, at level 13,  I still use my level 4 DoT.<br/>\nThe level 12 version burns to much mana, although I&#39;m slowly migrating to it,<br/>\nand it will fully replace it when I hit 14.  Since Level 4, I&#39;ve kept to the<br/>\nsame strategy when soloing.<br/>\n<br/>\nPull with Tashen (If mob cons white or is high MR) otherwise I pull with<br/>\nenfeeble<br/>\nEnfeeble (if not already done)<br/>\nSuff. Sphere.<br/>\nBack off<br/>\nWait till pet starts getting whacked (takes about 20 seconds)<br/>\nEngage mob<br/>\nAuto attack<br/>\nStun<br/>\nSuff Sphere<br/>\nRepeat Stuns when spell cycles<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you hit the part of the battle when you are meleeing and stunning (and<br/>\ntanking for your pet) you can throw in your DD spell for practice.  This still<br/>\nworks for me, and it will turn Young Kodiaks into pussy cats.  A high<br/>\nblue/white will cost you about a bubble of mana at level 10.  Truthfully, I am<br/>\nnuking a bit more since I hit 12, but the mana cost is pretty trivial at this<br/>\npoint, and of course my Evo is maxed out.  Another caveat,  this is a very bad<br/>\ntactic against Spell Casters, and Poisonous Critters, but thats a topic for<br/>\nanother E-Mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for group combat,  DD spells are the first to go.  They are quickly replaced<br/>\nwith Soothe and/or/then mem-blur.   I find mem-blur to be useless solo since<br/>\nmost of what I attack is KoS to me anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,  feel free to respond with anymore questions or comments,<br/>\nbecause work is slow today.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
