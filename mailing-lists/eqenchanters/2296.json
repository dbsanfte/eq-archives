With a pet and root you should be able to solo the yellows there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you&#39;re up for the hike (and while you&#39;re at it questing) Try<br/>\nblackburrow.  At level 9 I did the Stein of Mogguk quest for the first time.<br/>\nTo increase my faction in Qeynos (there were a few that would kill me without<br/>\nillusions) I fought in Blackburrow until level 10.  With a group you can handle<br/>\nthe Elite Knoll Guards.  They drop excellent loot and are great exp (they will<br/>\ncon red to you).  You can also sell in Surefall with illusion wood elf and<br/>\nalliance, and get excellent prices.  Sure beats the run back to Qeynos :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you can find a mule to do the Rivervale part of the quest (if you&#39;re<br/>\nplanning on doing the stein quest that is) Try the halfling camps in Nektulos.<br/>\nGreat exp, not too much loot though.  You should be able to solo the lowest<br/>\nlevel camp with Soothe and a pet.  If you can get a group try one of the higher<br/>\nlevel halfling camps.  With soothe you will be able to handle them one at a<br/>\ntime.  (side note:  I killed a LOT of halflings, and when I got my illusion<br/>\nhalfling at level 12 I wasn&#39;t KOS in rivervale after casting alliance on the<br/>\none NPC that was still threatening to me.  I stopped killing halflings at the<br/>\ncamps around level 12 though..)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEzrae<br/>\nDark Elf Enchanter of the 14th Season (heh still :)  have to take a little<br/>\nbreak. no internet connection at home :(  )<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter Frank wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Peter Frank&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pfrank@...\">pfrank@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think the Orc camps in South Ro would be perfect at your level.  With one<br/>\n&gt; other person you could hold a camp with out a problem.  When you are ready<br/>\n&gt; you can then move right to the near by Derv camp.  The only problem is<br/>\n&gt; actually getting there at your level; the North half of So Ro can be<br/>\n&gt; dangerous.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rizzin Diamoure<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 28, 1999 8:07 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqenchanters] Hunting Grounds<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Probably been covered plenty of times, I know... .but....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a level 9 enchanter and I&#39;m looking for a few places to level fast<br/>\n&gt; without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hurting my faction with Indigo Brotherhood (so Crushbone is out).
