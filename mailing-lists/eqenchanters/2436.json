You rely more on yourself for the entire battle then the<br/>\n&gt; entire group as a whole. You need to start to rely on your team-mates and<br/>\n&gt; realize that they too can handle situations. Also, i think you probably<br/>\n&gt; soloed a lot in the mid teens to mid 20&#39;s, cause most of the line up of your<br/>\n&gt; spells are good for soloing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Please don&#39;t leave the entire contents of the post before yours at the<br/>\n bottom of your posts. People reading on the digest have to scroll a lot<br/>\n because of it *grin*]<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it helps, I group with the same group each night. The same people<br/>\nday in and day out since level 10. They know how I play. I know how they<br/>\nplay. We work well together. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have almost never soloed. Maybe a day here and there, but 99% of my<br/>\nEQ time has been with the same small group of people (about 15 different<br/>\npeople). I&#39;ve duoed with a ranger a bit fear kiting, but most of the time<br/>\nit&#39;s 5 or 6 people groups or two groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see myself as undecided, I see myself as taking advantage<br/>\nof all that is available to me. If there is no magician or druid<br/>\naround (there is one druid and no magician in the circle of friends<br/>\nI normally play with) I should be using feedback on the main tank, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Basically, to sum up my opinion...remember this is only an opinion e-mail<br/>\n&gt; heheh<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I appreciate the input *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think you have great skill as an enchanter, but i dont think that being so<br/>\n&gt; undecided and changing spells either during battle, or running out of mana<br/>\n&gt; (i am sure you run out fast) during a battle because you wanna use all your<br/>\n&gt; spells is the best way to play an enchanter.....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;d be surprised. In a given battle, I&#39;ll usually use 20% of my<br/>\nmana. <br/>\n<br/>\nA large majority of battles are either Tash-&gt;Tepid-&gt;DoT med<br/>\nfor easy singles or Tash-&gt;Tepid-&gt;DoT-&gt;Debuff for hard singles<br/>\nthen sit back and med. The first sequence barely puts a dent in<br/>\nmy mana. The second takes a little over a bubble and I&#39;m usually able<br/>\nto med up most of that by the end of the battle. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnly time I&#39;m low on mana is after a battle where Augment needs <br/>\nrefreshed right after (I&#39;ve spent the last couple months primarily <br/>\nin Kedge Keep where Augment needs to be up all the time). <br/>\n<br/>\nCaster battles that are singles, I&#39;ll usually use about 40%, mostly <br/>\nbecause of multiple Whirls (flux/shift in Kedge pulls stupid little <br/>\nfish on me so I don&#39;t do it). At the same point, the wizards or druids <br/>\nare at half also so I&#39;m not slowing anyone down. But anyways, Strip <br/>\nEnchant-&gt;Strip Enchanter-&gt;Tash, med back up, Whirl at half till dead <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take too much mana either. With the barb warrior bashing and<br/>\nthe wizard stunning between nukes when Tishan&#39;s cycles plus me<br/>\nwhirling usually means no spells get off.<br/>\n<br/>\nMultiples, I do crowd control purely. If I can get Tash-&gt;Tepid off<br/>\non the main target, I do. But primary responsibility is to keep<br/>\nthe extras off. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anywayz, thats my opinons :) take it or leave it, its up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll take it of course *grin*. Any discussion is cool discussion<br/>\nto me! This is just the way I play. I may not have to do as much<br/>\nas I do do, but doing as much as possible while everyone else<br/>\ndoes as much as possible enables groups to do crazy things that<br/>\nother people might wait 3 or 4 levels to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I play with pickup groups, I definitely play simpler, mostly<br/>\nbecause I spend most of my time saying &quot;all on one target please&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPini Uldar<br/>\n38 Enchanter<br/>\nTunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
