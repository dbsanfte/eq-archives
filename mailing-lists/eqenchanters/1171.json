It ERASES the hate list and I<br/>\ncan prove it, on any mob. Don&#39;t know where you got<br/>\nthat mixing thing from.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry this, pick a mob, any mob that doesn&#39;t aggro just<br/>\nby being close to it, beetles for instance. Have your<br/>\nparty attack it for a while til it gets down to like<br/>\nhalf health, make it really angry, let the wizard root<br/>\nand nuke a bit. Now tell them all to stop attacking,<br/>\nonce they do, mesmerize it.<br/>\nNow stand around and watch, if all it did was mix the<br/>\nhate list, it will attack somebody in the party once<br/>\nthe stun effect wears off. Instead the mob will wander<br/>\noff as if nothing had happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
