I have found that my primary<br/>\n&gt;function is to Soothe anything but the one we want on a group spawn, she<br/>\n&gt;roots and blasts while I wait for Root to break and cast WTYH, Choke and<br/>\n&gt;Languid Pace.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds smart to me. You are on your way to becoming a great solo/duo<br/>\nEnchanter. In your early years, you are going to find that you will be<br/>\nusing a few spells in particular, while some others hardly ever make it<br/>\nfrom the spellbook to the memmed strip. This is the case if you are going<br/>\nto be grouped with the wife alot, since your primary goal beyond crowd<br/>\ncontrol is to keep the frail wizard from taking a dirt nap.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Offense / Defense: Abyssmal (have not been in melee long enough to get hit<br/>\n&gt;very much).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is going to be a big problem for you later in life. You HAVE to get<br/>\nthat defense up my friend, because at high levels, you are going to get hit<br/>\nALOT. Offense isnt a big deal. I think the last time I melee&#39;d anything was<br/>\n30 levels ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Evocation:Is so bad that I don&#39;t think it is above a 1 (if it has even<br/>\n&gt;gotten that high as I have cast it so little).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about this, it is a good idea to at least<br/>\ntry and nuke a bit as you increase in level, so that your Evoke skill<br/>\nincreases as you go along. My Evocation is in the 230&#39;s, and I cant<br/>\nremember the last time I fizzled on a nuke. This will be pretty useful when<br/>\nthere is no Mage or Wizard in the group. Later, when you start hunting<br/>\nthings that beat the tar out of you in 3 hits, its going to be necessary to<br/>\nsit back while the tanks soak up damage. The tanks will probably be a<br/>\nlittle peeved if you are the only caster and you arent nuking :)  But if<br/>\nyou plan on grouping with your wife alot, you wont have a need to<br/>\nnuke...regardless, its still a good idea to increase the skill quick as you<br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Conjuration: Whats that for? At 4th level, she had Root, and I had Fear<br/>\n&gt;ready so she could root again.  At 8th I rooted / feared and that was it.<br/>\n&gt;Now at 12th I WTYH. No need for a pet. I have yet to cast my pet spell. And<br/>\n&gt;now that I have Charm.... I&#39;m not even sure I will ever use it.<br/>\n&gt;Mezmerise uses conjuration I realize, but I have yet to have a need for it.<br/>\n&gt;Color Flux has give me the time I need to get off a WTYH or fear as we have<br/>\n&gt;been focusing on wandering mobs and 2 to 3 mob spawns.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Conjure...this is arguably your most important skill. Mesmerize and<br/>\nMesmerization are going to be the most important spells in your arsenal<br/>\nsoon. When you start to go into dungeons, or densely packed outdoor areas<br/>\n(Aviaks in South Karana, Derv Camps etc...), your puller is going to come<br/>\nback with two or three mobs at times. Your job will be to put the mobs the<br/>\nparty isnt fighting to sleep. Crowd control is an art form, and you are<br/>\ngoing to have to learn it sooner or later, because this is going to be job<br/>\none for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t even have time to cast Tashan as the mobs die so fast. I did in the<br/>\n&gt;begining, but it seemed a waste of mana very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, later in life, mobs will have alot higher magic resistances. At<br/>\nlevel 53, this spell (Tashania, its lvl 44 equivalent)  is ALWAYS on my<br/>\nmemmed strip.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Should I take the time to summon a pet and Mez it for an hour to get my<br/>\n&gt;skill up? Will I need it later in my career?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Go to the newbie grounds and mez bats and rats and whatnot for a couple<br/>\nhours. Your conjuration skill is absolutely essential later on. You will<br/>\nuse your Mesmerize line more than you can possibly imagine ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My divination and Alteration are maxed. I love illusions (div) and buff<br/>\n&gt;everyone I see normally. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My kind of Enchanter. Mana is free, so my buffs are too :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I know my wife and I will go far together with this combo, but I am worried<br/>\n&gt;that I will lack the finess needed in a group of tanks when my guild goes on<br/>\n&gt;raids and such. Anyone have any advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like you are on your way to being a good solo or duo Enchanter, but<br/>\nyou need to learn crowd control. Instead of Soothe, try having the wife<br/>\nnuke one in a group of 2 or 3 mobs. As they charge her, put one to sleep.<br/>\nThen the other. You both may die every now and again, buts its a helluva<br/>\nlot better to die learning crowd control at level 12 than at level 42 in<br/>\ndungeons, when an Enchanter is the key to keeping the entire group alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the most fun (and hardest) class to play in the game.
