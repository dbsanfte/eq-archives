Try it, find out<br/>\nby yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; - Jewelry. Jewel&#39;s prices are related to the level of one&#39;s skill. At<br/>\n&gt;&gt; jewelry 30 I sold rose quartz wedding ring at 133sp (+cp), made 31 and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; price went up 152 (+cp). Almost no loss :P. I noticed something similar<br/>\n&gt;&gt; earlier (I worked lvl 9-13 on my own before buying the rest of the lvls<br/>\n&gt;&gt; from a teacher). So maybe jewelry is not so bugged in the first place. If<br/>\n&gt;&gt; anyone else can confirm/infirm this I would appreciate (test sales before<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and after a 10th is reached)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Most likely you just sold to a different vendor that liked you better. If<br/>\n&gt;this is not the case, it would be a MUCH needed change.  Another would be to<br/>\n&gt;raise the benefit of the enchantment based on your jewelcraft skill, so<br/>\n&gt;someone with a skill of 100 could make a MUCH better item than someone at a<br/>\n&gt;skill of 30.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tAfter working my way up to lvl 31, I would be a complete twit not to sell<br/>\nonly at best possible price, I only like losing gp that much. Both sales<br/>\nwere made at the same place/vendor/time/patch version (if you need to know<br/>\nthe routine, I buy 4 silvers bars in one place (WF). Go play/hunt in<br/>\nEC/Befallen and once I get enough money for the need of the day sell with<br/>\nthe Erudite vendor in EC (Im Erudite too). Buy one gem/sale the result if<br/>\nany/buy another one until out of money or silver bars)...Plus, as said<br/>\nbefore, I noticed something similar between 10 and 11 but at the time<br/>\nfigured it as an oddity. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tAlliance : It never says in the rules it is the spell&#39;s purpose. Please<br/>\nstate your sources. At this moment I have to test if it helps on quests/talks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJade : Just to make sure after new patch, I went through all vendors in<br/>\nmage guild in Freeport. No one has any jade for sale. Most likely it was<br/>\ndue to player&#39;s loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIbnabeth / Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
