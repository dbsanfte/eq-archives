It also<br/>\nmodifies your chance of Charm/Alliance type spells taking affect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2. What effects the Duration of a spell?  anyone every notice that if a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>level 14 druid SOW&#39;s you that it doesn&#39;t last no where near as long as if a<br/>\nlevel 30 or so does it?<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of spells have a level based component. Spells like SoW and our Haze<br/>\nseries have a duration based on  your level(at lvl 10 it lasts 10 rounds, at<br/>\n30 it lasts 30 rounds). DD and DoT spells damage components are level<br/>\nbased(at level 10 it does 20 points at level 30 it does 40 points).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3.

(or any illusion<br/>\nwhere we can become a Mob of some type)  is it our 2H blunt that determines<br/>\nhit or miss?
