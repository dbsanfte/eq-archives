Overwieght also reduces your<br/>\nagility.<br/>\nRunning Speed is *slightly* affected by the client side speed. If you stick<br/>\ntwo people in a race, one on a high end machine, and one on a low end<br/>\nmachine that lags (is choppy, like a 233) due to machine speed (not &#39;net<br/>\nlatency), the faster machine will be slightly faster running.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done no testing at the 100 agility mark. It would be interesting to<br/>\ntest though. In the manual, which is nearly 95% inaccurate, it says agility<br/>\ndetermines how fast you can run, yes.

I first<br/>\n&gt; noticed the problem with my enchanter, a human, and a human cleric...<br/>\n&gt; neither were encumbered, but my enchanter was running much faster than the<br/>\n&gt; cleric.  the only difference was his higher strength had him carrying more<br/>\n&gt; pounds.  My Druid wood elf and a wood elf ranger, same agility.... druid<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; faster, less weight.  my druid vrs one with a agility buff, the agi buff<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; was slightly faster, but when I got my agi to 100, I could keep up with<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; buffed one, (in the 120s).  We did those while at the same weight.... done<br/>\n&gt; at different weights, the heavy one always lagged behind.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Conclusions...<br/>\n&gt; Weight is deciding factor... encumbrance only decreases your agility to<br/>\nslow<br/>\n&gt; you down, but each pound slows you as well.<br/>\n&gt; Agility is a factor, but only to 100... which is max groundspeed at 0<br/>\nweight<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have 101 agility, SoW, and keep my weight around 55 pounds.  I can run<br/>\n&gt; circles around anyone in my guild, even the other shamans and druids.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Save 75% on Products!<br/>\n&gt; Find incredible deals on overstocked items with Free shipping!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4013/8/_/451658/_/958395530/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4013/8/_/451658/_/958395530/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nMake new friends, find the old at Classmates.com:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4052/8/_/451658/_/958402754/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4052/8/_/451658/_/958402754/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
