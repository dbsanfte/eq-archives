Even if it sucks up 1/4 to 1/3<br/>\nof the XP, it&#39;s still better than dying.  Plus, mana regenerates faster<br/>\nthen HP...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that for me, at least, root doesn&#39;t last long enough to use<br/>\nit as the first spell.  I tend to start with a Suffocating Sphere, for<br/>\nthe DOT effect, and then enfeeble, then Chaotic Feedback, and then<br/>\nRoot.  Then wait a bit, and then Chaotic feedback again.<br/>\n<br/>\n`Course, all that&#39;s only if I&#39;m fighting something REALLY big, a yellow<br/>\nor so.  I&#39;ll beat up on Decaying Skeletons and Skeletons all day, just<br/>\nme and my pet, no magic needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nE<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Miko, Jeff&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Miko, Jeff&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JMiko@...\">JMiko@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was curious what strategies everyone is using when fighting solo?  I<br/>\n&gt; tend to Root them, cast Chaotic Feedback, meditate (heh), cast Chaotic<br/>\n&gt; Feedback and repeat until out of mana. After this I hope their dead or<br/>\n&gt; almost dead. If not I run like heck!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I like grouping as much as possible, but the people I&#39;ve been grouping<br/>\n&gt; with lately just don&#39;t seem to get it.  They want to fight Tombstone<br/>\n&gt; creatures when everyone is half healed and low on mana. They also don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; let me bring out one creature at a time for the group to wallop. Instead<br/>\n&gt; they jump all 4-5 Orcs at a camp, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I got tired of dying so I have been playing solo some more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n&quot;There is no spoon.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-The Matrix</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
