I play<br/>\nQumen an 8th level High Elf Enchanter on the Innoruuk server. What I am<br/>\nlooking for is for someone to help finance my selected trade of jewel<br/>\ncraft. I have a skill of 25 and have run into one small stumbling block,<br/>\ncash flow. If someone is willing to help with financing I would be<br/>\nwilling to share magic items, profits, or any other arrangement that we<br/>\ncan agree upon. Wouldn&#39;t it be neat to start a trade guild to help<br/>\nnewbie jewelers with this problem. I am sure I am not the first with<br/>\nthis experience.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
