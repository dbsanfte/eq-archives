As far as your combat goes, that is about what","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1941890316\">Hi and welcome to the group!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, you cant buy tiny daggers in quenos, you&#39;ll have to stock up in<br/>\nerudin.  As far as your combat goes, that is about what you should be doing<br/>\nat your level yes, dont worry about finding a group unless one is handily<br/>\navailable, and then you&#39;ll still be doing the same thing except you probably<br/>\nwont use a pet.  Dont be afraid of shallow breath also... suffocating sphere<br/>\nis a Damage over Time spell and multiple casts of it are somewhat redundant.<br/>\nI would suggest suffocating sphere should be your first damage spell, all<br/>\nsubsequent damage spells should be Direct Damage (shallow breath).  You will<br/>\nalso want to get friendly with the spell &#39;mesmerize&#39;, its use is the staple<br/>\nof the enchanter class.  Use it when your pet has died, to get some distance<br/>\nor time so that you can recast your pet with no worries.  Simply put, it is<br/>\na 24 second stun spell which will break as soon as the target is hit with<br/>\ndamage or when the duration expires.  Dont overlook Color Flux also as a<br/>\ngreat way to get a few steps ahead of a monster that is in your face.... but<br/>\ndont use this spell near a guard or NPC that you would like to stay on good<br/>\nterms with.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you reach level 8, you&#39;re able to buy  root which will help you on your<br/>\nway, as well as chaotic feedback which is a nice little Direct Damage spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, I hope these suggestions help you in some way.  It sounds like<br/>\nyou are doing not too bad though, so dont be afraid to hold onto whatever<br/>\nworks for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg - RZ 46 (finally!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Chris Anderson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darksfallen@...\">darksfallen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 15, 2000 11:45 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqenchanters] Hi everyone<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wanted to say hi and that I just started an Enchanter. I was wondering<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; I could get some advice from all of you out there. I&#39;m Erudian, but I am<br/>\n&gt; hunting with a friend in Qeynos Hills right now, I&#39;m 4th level. I really<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing, usually here is what combat is like, I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; been lucky enough to get in a group yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Summon and Buff Pet<br/>\n&gt; 2. Tashan<br/>\n&gt; 3. Suffacating Sphere<br/>\n&gt; 4. Enfeeblement<br/>\n&gt; 5. Watch Animation beat up critter, sometimes help.<br/>\n&gt; 6. Run away recast Animation and help finish it off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Those are pretty much all the spells I use, with the exception of Minor<br/>\n&gt; Guard, Haze and Strengthen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have found that the best exp for me is to kill the diseased stuff and<br/>\nturn<br/>\n&gt; in thier pelts for alot of exp and a cure of course, that&#39;s really nice. I<br/>\n&gt; turned in a fleshy orb once, but she handed it back and said to go to<br/>\n&gt; Freeport, though I have no idea where that is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are there any problems with what I&#39;m doing? Please give me any advice you<br/>\n&gt; can, I would love to hear it, I don&#39;t wanna get stuck in a way of doing<br/>\n&gt; things only to find out that it will be wrong when I get higher in levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS: Where in Qeynos do I buy The daggers for the Animation spells? I lookf<br/>\n&gt; for hours, and go very lost.<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
