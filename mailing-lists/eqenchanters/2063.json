I know the charm spell for necros<br/>\nwas crap anyway.  I guess I&#39;m just jealous that my enchanter is wanted so<br/>\nmuch for in a group then my necro is.  But it is alot easier to kite with my<br/>\nenchanter then my necro now.  Just charm one mob and set it against another.<br/>\nWhen the one thats being teamed up is dead and your pet is almost dead then<br/>\nits very easy to kill it and get exp for both.  And I was hunting in Unrest<br/>\nthe other night and my life suck wouldnt work on a werebat but the enchanter<br/>\nin our group (same lvl as me)had no problem casting on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appologize to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tim Borelli [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timb@...\">timb@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 18, 1999 3:34 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqenchanters] Latest nerf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Tim Borelli &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timb@...\">timb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ndid you ever try to use it? it was the level 12 enchanter charm spell that<br/>\nnecros got at 24. that spell couldnt be used to charm any MOB over level<br/>\n25. if you cast the spell on a mob over 25, you got a message saying you<br/>\ncant do it with this spell. by the time you got the spell at 24, it&#39;s<br/>\nuseless considering the other spells you got.<br/>\n<br/>\nand i get sick of necros complaining about how they get resisted just like<br/>\neveryone else now. life tap gets resisted now. good. necros were too<br/>\npowerful with life tap almost always sticking and being able to kite. now<br/>\nthey get resisted just like wizzies and mages. i&#39;ve played all 4, and even<br/>\nNOW my enchanter STILL gets resisted more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:23 PM 11/18/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Jeremy Cobb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeremy@...\">jeremy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Why was the charm spell useless for Necro&#39;s?∩┐╜ it worked the same as the<br/>\n&gt;enchanters, right?∩┐╜ Necro&#39;s over the last couple months have gotten<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hammered<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;big time.∩┐╜ The charm and fear nerf changes nothing in non PVP∩┐╜situations<br/>\n&gt;(which probably counts for 95% of the time).∩┐╜ My necro would be very happy<br/>\n&gt;if his DOT&#39;s worked corectly in non PVP, or his life suck, or his Pet, or<br/>\n&gt;Feign Death.∩┐╜ Be thankful.<br/>\n&gt;∩┐╜<br/>\n&gt;∩┐╜<br/>\n&gt;Foladenn Darkinmore- Necromancer, Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt;Denina- Enchanter, Rodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-------------------<br/>\ntim borrelli<br/>\nlead character animator<br/>\n&quot;I dont suffer from insanity, I enjoy every minute of it...&quot;<br/>\nVolition, Inc.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timmyland@...\">timmyland@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.timmyland.com\">http://www.timmyland.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
