Bandit #2 spawned as the #1 was running at me. =(  I killed #1<br/>\nwhich leveled me to 8th (yay!) and had 1 bubble of health, and my pet was<br/>\ndead. I turned off my attack and tried to mes. I forgot to Tashan, so by the<br/>\ntime it stuck, I had a sliver of life left. I backed up the hill (30 to 40<br/>\nfeet) and sat down to med and get enough mana for a fear and also to heal up<br/>\nas I didn&#39;t have bandages either. When my &quot;Your Mesmerize spell has worn<br/>\noff.&quot; message came up I didn&#39;t move trying to get one last tick of health /<br/>\nmana, and waiting to get whacked to auto stand up. It never happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I just back up to far for the agro to kick in? Or did the Mesmerize wipe<br/>\nme from the hate list as I hadn&#39;t actually hit the bandit in melee?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, btw I have looted 3 vials of elven blood from the bandits that have<br/>\nwoodelf graphic models. This is for the new armor, but I can&#39;t remember<br/>\nwhich ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your replies in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nUthanatos<br/>\n8th Facet in the Jewel of Norrath<br/>\nFennin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
