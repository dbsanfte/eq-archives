The only MOB that I&#39;m taking about here<br/>\nis Vox.  Her channelling skill is so high now that even with 18-20 tanks<br/>\nbashing/slamming/kicking and mauling her flesh, she will still get a 10 second<br/>\ncasting time complete heal off that a level 50 cleric sometimes get interupted<br/>\nwhen he/she gets bumped by players pets.  If you can get 3 or so enchanters<br/>\nusing mana sieve on her. she&#39;ll only get one Complete Heal off- otehrwise.......<br/>\nnot a prestty site.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that - it&#39;s a PvP oriented spell.  I think the upgrades were meant to<br/>\nhelp the Zek server enchanters after charm/fear were removed.<br/>\n<br/>\nPRevious post:<br/>\nPersonally I find most interesting the change to &#39;DDD&#39;.  It shall be interesting<br/>\nto see if this spell makes its way back into peoples hotkey bank... imho it<br/>\nseems like more of a PvP spell now (mana drain on Mobs?  whats the point?)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
