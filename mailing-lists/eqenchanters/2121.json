Is it because you group all the time? I solo alot do to lag<br/>\nissues, which makes me unreliable in groups. This makes things tough, but I<br/>\nfind it necessary to be able to rely on my current Rank of spells. This<br/>\nmeans keeping all the Spell Abilities maxxed as quickly as possible.<br/>\nI already see that Enchanters alternate upgrades to DD and Dot spells every<br/>\nother Rank. That makes for an Interesting combination. I will play around<br/>\nwith that tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nAND STOP NUKING YOURSELF.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nSince I am only 4th level and I do not have this spell yet, I&#39;m not nuking<br/>\nmyself. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;another rant&gt;<br/>\nI have known something was not right and I just figured it out why it was<br/>\nbothering me. Our Level 1 DD spell (and every DoT spell) is an Alteration<br/>\nspell. Every DD spell afer 1st level except the AE DD spell at 39th level is<br/>\nEvocation. Why the change? By this I mean why did it go from an Alteration<br/>\nspell at 1st to an Evocation spell up until level 39 where it becomes an<br/>\nAlteration spell, and then back to an Evocation spell?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, why do we skip an upgrade to the 12th level DoT at 20th level? This is<br/>\nthe only level that this happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, get me going and I can&#39;t stop. Expect alot of twisted questions<br/>\nfrom me. Why? Because I like active lists. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBahir<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I hate not knowing why.  I can handle anything as long as I understand<br/>\nwhy.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
