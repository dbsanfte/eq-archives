I have gotten about 5 steins for other people, and I admit,<br/>\n&gt; I feel kinda bad about it, but I have made decent money doing it. The<br/>\n&gt; nicest person I helped complete the quest gave me 120 platinum and 6<br/>\n&gt; research-only spells for bringing him merely an ingredient. This was an<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter that couldnt get a Koalindl fish from Qeynos because his faction<br/>\n&gt; with the Priests of Life was already KOS. Now that I know what others are<br/>\n&gt; charging, I will insist that others be at least as nice as that person<br/>\nwas.<br/>\n&gt; In my opinion, high level Enchanters (level 30+) have a great outlet for<br/>\n&gt; making money. Not only can they brave the terrors of high level dungeons<br/>\n&gt; and usually get some nice loot, but their jewelcraft skill is also high<br/>\n&gt; enough that they are starting to make back the tons and tons of platinum<br/>\n&gt; they dumped into improving the skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This Stein quest is a great way to make money for those Enchanters that<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; at the awkward 20th - 30th levels, where jewelcraft is still right around<br/>\n&gt; the low to mid 100&#39;s, and you are still dumping money into it to become<br/>\n&gt; good with gold and platinum. It burns me up when non-enchanters tell me<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Man, Enchanters have it made. You have jewelcraft AND this Stein quest.&quot;<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; want to slap them in their stupid face. I have spent over 600 platinum on<br/>\n&gt; jewelcraft and my skill is about 108 or so. 600 platinum. To other level<br/>\n&gt; 20&#39;s that may not be much. But that is ALOT of money to me. ALOT more<br/>\n&gt; platinum than I have MADE with jewelcraft.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe im not being as economical as I could be. If some of you other<br/>\n&gt; Enchanters around my level have some advice on other ways to make money,<br/>\n&gt; besides fighting your group members for scraps in dungeons, or hoping to<br/>\n&gt; make decent coin fighing Aviaks and Centaurs, or surviving the trains in<br/>\n&gt; Unrest, let me know, I would love to hear your advice :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is getting long, so i will sum up. This Stein quest may be an<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter only quest, but thats what gives it such profit potential for<br/>\nus.<br/>\n&gt; I think it is a great way for 20th - 30th level Enchanters to make some<br/>\n&gt; decent money and work on their jewelcraft, or buy some decent armor and<br/>\n&gt; spells.
