It helps to have a partner with you to deal damage.  In group vs.<br/>\ngroup PvP, nothing tips the balance factor like an enchanter.  You want to<br/>\nfocus on disabling through Mesmerize, Blind, and Stun (color flux, color<br/>\nshift) while the others do damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:<br/>\nBack when I was level 19, I was running from Neriak when an Erudite wizard<br/>\n(con&#39;s yellow) is running down the path.  Mesmerize him as he tries to cast<br/>\na spell.  His spell is interrupted, I start to memorize some PvP spells.  A<br/>\nDark Elf wizard was following the Erudite as well, and he comes up and<br/>\nblasts the Mezzed Erudite, waking him up.  Crap.  I get my face out of my<br/>\nspell book, and get rooted.  (I guess he thought I was going to fight like a<br/>\nmob).  Mez - interrupt.  The dark elf wizzie blasts the Erudite again.  Mez<br/>\n- interrupt.  Dark elf casts...  Until the Erudite dropped.  Neither of us<br/>\ntook a bit of damage.  The only spell he got off was root.  And the only<br/>\nspell I cast was Mesmerize (although I cast it several times).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother Example:<br/>\nLast night my guildmates and I did a raid into Runneye.  We had a full<br/>\ngroup.  2 Warriors, 1 Cleric, 1 Necro, 1 Wizzie, 1 Enchanter (me).  Level<br/>\n24-29 all of us.  We gated into North Karana and saw a massively decked out<br/>\nBarbarian shaman.  Tashan.  Whril til you hurl.  By the way WTYH is<br/>\nwonderful in PvP.  The players will actually spin around.  I see my skin<br/>\ncombust and a human wizzie is nuking me.  Quick Enthrall shuts him up.  We<br/>\nfinish the shaman and the cleric loots, gaining a nice magic item and over<br/>\n30 plat in cash.  The wizzie that had attacked me runs away.  After a<br/>\nproductive night of gaining XP (but we didn&#39;t get the Blackened Iron<br/>\nBroadsword) we had to leave Runneye and ran into another full party of<br/>\nLights.  Area effect Mesmerization.  Then we picked them off one by one.<br/>\n(Well we got two of them, the rest ran.  Then a VERY red wizard killed our<br/>\nlevel 29 wizard, but was out of the range of any of the rest of us.  Evac<br/>\ncalled for and those of us with Gate, gated.  The warriors made it back to<br/>\nSouth karana with no troubles.  But in these battles, I just do what I<br/>\nnormally do when hunting mobs.  Disable them.  Keep them from hurting my<br/>\ngroup and my group will finish them off one by one.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrexia<br/>\n26th Dark elf Enchantress<br/>\nTallon Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
