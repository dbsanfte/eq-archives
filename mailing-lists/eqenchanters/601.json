I then sunk 40 platinum into the skill. I sold<br/>\nall the stuff I made and put it back into the skill.  This got me to a<br/>\nskill of 37 where I was combining Amber and silver. I was in Freeport at<br/>\nthe time and my skill was rising very fast I thought. Last night I sunk<br/>\nover 70 platinum into the skill. I went up a notch to using Jade and<br/>\nenchanted silver to make Mana Rings.  In 20 attempts I made 13 rings and<br/>\ngot NO SKILL IMPROVEMENT AT ALL.  What gives?  Am I doing something<br/>\nwrong? I thought my 70 platinum investment would get me to at least 40<br/>\nskill or higher. Now I&#39;m broke, but I have yet to sell the Jade rings<br/>\nbecause I was tired and frustrated. If I can get 7-8 platinum per ring I<br/>\nshould get most of my money back. I would appreciate any help here guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I found my success rate making jewelry better when I had full<br/>\nmana. I don&#39;t know if this was just a coincidence or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
