Star Rose Quarts, Carnelian, <br/>\nJasper, ?, ?, ?  <br/>\nThanks for reading my frustrated rant.<br/>\n<br/>\nOff topic, I was in N.Ro last night and I have never had <br/>\nas much fun killing Skeles. Before I had to go sell I <br/>\nhad bagged 18 skeles in 30 minutes as the zone was <br/>\ncompletely cleared and repopped twice. I started with no <br/>\nmoney after just coming from the bank and had 5gp equiv. <br/>\nin copper and silver before I had to go sell. I hope to <br/>\ndo it again tonight. hehe.<br/>\n--<br/>\nArtimis<br/>\nEnchanter 1st Rank<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
