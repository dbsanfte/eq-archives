I like your idea of<br/>\nmaking existing ones no drop and changing the quest reward. However, I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve you can put the GS in either hand right now. I tried to equip both<br/>\nthe Glowing Stein and my Crude Stein right after I got my GS, and couldn&#39;t<br/>\nequip them both.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tTim Borelli [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timb@...\">timb@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, August 19, 1999 9:31 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqenchanters] Stein - No more - Addendum<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Tim Borelli &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timb@...\">timb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i&#39;m sorry, but people who are complaining about this change... please shut<br/>\n&gt; up about it. it&#39;s a freaking plus 10 INT, plus 5 DEX, plus 20 Sv Disease<br/>\n&gt; item. in other words, an AWESOME item. it was too too too easy to get, and<br/>\n&gt; we could hold it in either hand. there was NO penalty for using/having it.<br/>\n&gt; i think it&#39;s a good idea that they are going to introduce some sort of<br/>\n&gt; penalty for having it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; do i think it&#39;s a good idea that they have to change it now? no. they<br/>\n&gt; should have thought of it before they made the quest so damn easy. if they<br/>\n&gt; had made it as hard as the GBS to get, then i wouldnt expect there to be<br/>\n&gt; any penalty for having it. but since it was easy as hell, i would have.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; my idea is to leave the ones that are in the world as is, except make them<br/>\n&gt; no drop. then anyone else who does the quest gets the new one, not the old<br/>\n&gt; one.
