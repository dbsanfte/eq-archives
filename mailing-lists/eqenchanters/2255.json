And Im sure<br/>\nmany other high level enchanters would agree with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrue, some people say conjuration may be good with mes and all, but honestly<br/>\nthat is our cheapest line of spells. If you really want to be a good<br/>\nenchanter specialize in alteration, at higher levels youll be casting so<br/>\nmany alteration spells youll be happy for the slightly lower mana cost. <br/>\n<br/>\nIve had to cast clarity and celerity on over 2 parties worth of people, and<br/>\nIts hard to keep that demand up, and when I get swift like wind it will be<br/>\nworse. I try to reserve all my casting to my specialization skill, (slow,<br/>\nand if i need to do dmg i use my dots since they are alteration) In kedge<br/>\nyou will learn that the enchanter needs to cast augmentation on EVERYONE,<br/>\nand last week i had 18 ppl to augment. The extra mana you save on 2 personal<br/>\nbuffs is at least minorly helpful (cha/agi). <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time when I laughed at other casters because everytime they were<br/>\noom, i still had over 50-60, but since weve been hitting giants, imps,<br/>\nkedge, (and very soon the planes), i have always been the lowest mana<br/>\nbecause of the buffs (and I always drain my mana on buffing because it is<br/>\nwell worth the cost)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo specialize alteration, youll be happy you did when you are able to cast<br/>\n2400 mana worth of buffs on only 1900.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Maelael 48 Enchanter, Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
