The first is magic resist, and Tashan/Tashani/Tashania<br/>\nhelp tremendously there. The second thing that will influence their chance<br/>\nto resist is your charisma. If you are going to be serious about being an<br/>\nenchanter and using our charm/crowd control tools, you need to boost your<br/>\ncharisma as high as you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason that both of these can also increase the duration of a charm is<br/>\nbecause charm has no set length. A critter gets a chance to resist every few<br/>\nseconds. Every successive try is given a little better chance to succeed,<br/>\nbut the tashan spell and your charisma are still used in the calculation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nQinie Isil&#39;Goren<br/>\n27 Enchanter<br/>\nMith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tJames [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tFriday, December 17, 1999 7:10 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqenchanters] Charm<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;James&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Im about to mess around with charm. Im almost level 12 :) I played a<br/>\n&gt; wizard<br/>\n&gt; to level 34 and got bored of blast... blast again.. what next to do<br/>\n&gt; maybe..<br/>\n&gt; hmm I know blast!!!! hehehee Well as I was saying I noticed at level 12 my<br/>\n&gt; root for my wizard got resisted allot! At level 12 can I charm anything to<br/>\n&gt; make it worth it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also I have no EXP with useing a charm spell. Other then you know your pet<br/>\n&gt; is going to want to kill you soon enough.. hehehehehe Ant insight on what<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; do, and how I will be effected?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S. I am told that Tashan can help not only to stop your char from<br/>\n&gt; getting<br/>\n&gt; resisted but it also lenghens the time you hold the charm? Is this Bull to<br/>\n&gt; put it lightly :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for puting up with my newbe questions :) and all the responce from<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; last posting. You seem like a frendly bunch :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
