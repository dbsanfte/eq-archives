GZ has said that there are some<br/>\ninaccuracies, and that the game code does some additinal modification of<br/>\nthe numbers, so don&#39;t trust it too far.  Still, it seems right on in a lot<br/>\nof specifics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I heard in-game that mez is 15 sec, enthrall 30, entrance 45 and dazzle 60.<br/>\n&gt; The enchanter spell list on Baelish&#39;s site says mez 30, enthrall 30, <br/>\n&gt; entrance 50-60, dazzle 120, which I find more believable.

Yes,<br/>\nstun breaks mez.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Stun line : Color Flux 3 sec, Color Shift 7 sec, Color Skew 8 sec.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Stun is different.  It&#39;s not a length of spell effect, it&#39;s an instant<br/>\neffect of &quot;stun&quot;, with a numeric value.  Flux is 4000, Shift is 6000, Skew<br/>\n8000.  The stun effect with our DDs is always value 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy theory is that there&#39;s a stun-recovery rate somewhere between 1000 and<br/>\n4000 per second, varying per target, perhaps based on target&#39;s STA or<br/>\nother stat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSearching on monster &quot;spells&quot; with effect Stun, it seems Air Elemental<br/>\nstun has a value of 3000 + 60*lvl (max 5000), and basilisk&#39;s stone breath<br/>\nis 12000 stun points.<br/>\n--<br/>\nMark Rafn    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dagon@...\">dagon@...</a>    &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dagon.net/\">http://www.dagon.net/</a>&gt;   !G</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
