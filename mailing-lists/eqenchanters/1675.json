It is just a continution of our<br/>\ncurrent enchant metals line. It is what our class is about. There are lots<br/>\nof jewelcrafters out there that aren&#39;t enchanters, just as there will be a<br/>\nlot of people who aren&#39;t enchanters crafting magic weapons and armor if we<br/>\nget the ability to enchant ore in the future. This isn&#39;t an &#39;addition&#39; to<br/>\nour class, this is finally delivering what was promised...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tXIII [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dlepriol@...\">dlepriol@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, July 21, 1999 3:18 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@onelist.com\">eqenchanters@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqenchanters] about the new enchant items (long rant)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: XIII &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dlepriol@...\">dlepriol@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Party pooper, party pooper. Ok you know the song, this time I fill the<br/>\n&gt; role<br/>\n&gt; :).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tMay I point out that the message said that the code was going to be<br/>\n&gt; implemented, not that -we- enchanters are going to benefit from it. True,<br/>\n&gt; it was stated in the book we could do it, but at no time in B4 it was in<br/>\n&gt; effect, and, according to EQE, we received other benefits to make up for<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tAs I see it, such thing would overbalance us (enchanters) in regard<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; other pure spell user classes. So either the benefit will be too small to<br/>\n&gt; even consider it or too huge and Verant might take out something in return<br/>\n&gt; to balance our classe again. Don&#39;t tell me we&#39;re nerfed now. We were,<br/>\n&gt; true,<br/>\n&gt; but that was sometime ago and from my point of view we are rather balanced<br/>\n&gt; regarding other pure spell users. To sum up we have our &quot;niche&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tSo, the idea is: By talking here, and offering Verant options to<br/>\n&gt; consider<br/>\n&gt; we may have a say in the matter and make our class fuller in the way -we-<br/>\n&gt; see it. What I would like to see discussed here is : What can we give up<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; have a &#39;proper&#39; enchantment line of spells?. Or are we just to receive<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; new ability/spell/line of spells without giving up anything?. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tAs stated above, I dont think we can&#39;t expect a &#39;useful&#39; line of<br/>\n&gt; enchantment&#39;s spells unless we give up something in exchange. Thinking<br/>\n&gt; back<br/>\n&gt; of Beta, there was a line of spells we didn&#39;t have but nonetheless still<br/>\n&gt; managed to survive and prosper : Pet line of spells. Plus they don&#39;t fit<br/>\n&gt; enchanters very well . On the other hand, this line form the very core of<br/>\n&gt; most of our solo strategies so losing it wouldn&#39;t be a small thing. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tThis is just an example, a topic&#39;s starter. Feel free to agree,<br/>\n&gt; disagree<br/>\n&gt; or tell me to shut up. Once again my aim to to talk things out here first<br/>\n&gt; and offer something (petition/ EQE/ you name it) constructive to Verant<br/>\n&gt; before we see something not implemented or half implemented in place.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Best,<br/>\n&gt; Ibnabeth / Karana<br/>\n&gt; still going up </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
