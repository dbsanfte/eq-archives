Do our<br/>\n&gt;&gt; normal spells around this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; level work on skeletons?  The last few times I have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; engaged them, I have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cast things like Enfeeble and Mesmerize.  The spells<br/>\n&gt;&gt; were not resisted, but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; there was no indication of a spell effect, as is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; normally stated when these<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spells take effect (e.g. &#39;Your target has been<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Mesmerized&#39;).<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Does anyone know what this means? I think the spells<br/>\n&gt;&gt; may have worked, but I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; am not positive.  Can anyone shed any light?
