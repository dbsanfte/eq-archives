It&#39;s definately harder that way. :)<br/>\nI still can&#39;t go to Kaladim with any illusions, I need to stay invis all through<br/>\nButcherblock.  I&#39;m ok so far everywhere else I&#39;ve went, I think the only towns I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been to with this character are Ak&#39;Anon and Grobb.  I&#39;m planning on<br/>\nchecking out AkAnon tonight.  I figure since I&#39;m on that side of the world right<br/>\nnow I&#39;ll grab all the coins of Tash that I can.  Someday I&#39;ll be able to use<br/>\nthem :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never had Alliance &quot;resisted&quot;, but when I cast on some NPC&#39;s it says I<br/>\ncannot see my target even though I&#39;m standing right next to them, and the spell<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take hold..  I think I read somewhere that Alliance is a non aggro spell<br/>\nas well, so it shouldn&#39;t cause them to attack.  I&#39;ll have to check into that one<br/>\nagain. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEzrae<br/>\n<br/>\nRich Hitz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Rich Hitz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rich.Hitz@...\">Rich.Hitz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I never tried the alliance spell when the Ogre was in there, he killed me<br/>\n&gt; twice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What race do you play?

Being Agnostic takes care of this problem though.<br/>\n&gt; Can Alliance be resisted?  If so, then if cast on an NPC is it considered an<br/>\n&gt; attack?
