I have went twice in the<br/>\nlast week and stayed for 12 hours once and about 8 hours another time.  Only<br/>\nsaw two caster items drop (got both of them btw =P) a pair of Enchanter<br/>\ngloves 5ac , 9int, 9agil, 35mana , 2vs all except magic which is 1vs and a<br/>\nbelt 4ac 40hps 40mana.  But to spend 20 hours in a plane and only see 2<br/>\n(TWO!) pieces of caster gear drop is pathetic.  While I was there I saw<br/>\ncountless pieces of Cleric and Warrior pieces drop.  Anyone else seeing this<br/>\nas well?  This place is really big and maybe my groups are just not pulling<br/>\nthe right mobs or we are not in the right area I have no idea.  Just seemed<br/>\na bit strange to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMu<br/>\nEnchanter 54th Season<br/>\nTunare Server<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Melaniel [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:online.games@...\">online.games@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 01, 2000 6:12 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqenchanters@egroups.com\">eqenchanters@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqenchanters] GU Comics - Daily OnLine Comic Strip by<br/>\nWoody Hearn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tue, 31 Oct 2000 20:44:54 +0100, &quot;(Allayana)&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarastro@...\">sarastro@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Heya all,<br/>\n&gt;Well, me too was wondering about the lifelyness of this group!
