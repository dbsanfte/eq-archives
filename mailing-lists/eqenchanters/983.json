I have been getting<br/>\n&gt; frustrated with the Enchanters myself though I still<br/>\n&gt; play them.  Verant wants this to be a team game the<br/>\n&gt; only problem is (which I run into alot) is that how<br/>\n&gt; are we suppose to team and fight things that are a<br/>\n&gt; challenge?  When I am in a group and we fight<br/>\n&gt; something red I become useless I can&#39;t cast on them<br/>\n&gt; so I have to go in and tank with everyone else and<br/>\n&gt; have my pet help me at times.  If this is how I<br/>\n&gt; wanted to play I would play a Shadow Knight.  I have<br/>\n&gt; a hard enough time trying to cast on things that are<br/>\n&gt; blue too me.  I even have things that are green to<br/>\n&gt; me resist my spells at times.  I think they should<br/>\n&gt; fix this also.  alteast make Tashan help more if you<br/>\n&gt; cast it you should be able to cast on res things.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To clear up the spell stunning issue.  In a patch<br/>\n&gt; about 3 weeks ago they had a post on the patch<br/>\n&gt; server and the news section that said.  Spells that<br/>\n&gt; were to Stun (ie. Chaotic Feedback, Sanity Warp,<br/>\n&gt; Smite a Cleric spell line and others) will instead<br/>\n&gt; interupt the targets casting.  I would rather it<br/>\n&gt; stun since these spells take sooooo long to cast as<br/>\n&gt; it is and Colour Flux is better for this.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They do need to do some serious work on the<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter to make them a some what playable race. <br/>\n&gt; With every patch something seems to get worse with<br/>\n&gt; them.  Illusions broken (I know it was a accident<br/>\n&gt; but it still took them about 2 weeks to fix it)<br/>\n&gt; which is a major part of a enchanter.  They also<br/>\n&gt; need to add some sort of enchant weapon and if it is<br/>\n&gt; in the game now hidding it will be useless by the<br/>\n&gt; time you are level 16 to 20 since you will either<br/>\n&gt; have money to buy a weapon or you can go find a<br/>\n&gt; magic weapon by this level.  Also fixing Jewel<br/>\n&gt; crafting would be nice since it is a joke right now<br/>\n&gt; 150 plat to make a +3 int item where I can get a<br/>\n&gt; braclet at mid twentys that give 3 int and wiz.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also a question what books tell what pages make<br/>\n&gt; which spells?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope that this clears up the Stun issue and<br/>\n&gt; everyone needs to protest to make this worth while. <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kryten of ECI<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list<br/>\n&gt; members? <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events,<br/>\n&gt; meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>===<br/>\nThe Wanderer<br/>\nMay The Wanderers Protect You<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
