I am very fond of my chosen profession, and hope to start jewlery craft soon. I find it almost impossible to make enough coin to buy my 8th level spells, and I hear Learning to make Jewlery is very expensive. It sounds like some enchanters out there have coins to spare. Can I ask how you are generating money? What creatures are you slaying to support yourselves?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThank you\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAgeron of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
