I was getting pretty frustrated about this quest, but this makes sense.  When sultin said &quot;Enchanted and Gleaming gloves can  be purchased for 50 golden coins from Tizina of the Lavastrom Gypsies and a bloodstone from Tarn Vislin of HighKeep.&quot;, I thought both gloves were from Tizina, stupid me hehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully I&#39;ll have the gloves soon enough.  Thanks for the help sloop!  <br/>\n<br/>\nCogg - Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\nps.  I dont mind the 40 messages per day into eqenchanters being reduced to one or 2 every now and then... it shows that enchanters are fairly complacent with our class.

You need to buy a bloodstone from a gem vendor, and give it to him. By the way, what you want off the shadowed men is Glowing Gloves. They also drop Shadowed Gloves, but you do not want to give those to the quest npc, he&#39;d just take them and say thanks. <br/>\n  Sloop Aybera of Fennin Ro, owner of all the incandescent pieces and the rod of insidious glamour, and admin of this dying list.  = ) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
