Unrest is a great area for low 20&#39;s to low 30&#39;s,<br/>\nunfortunately on my server (Cazic Thule), Unrest is a ghost town. Upper Guk<br/>\nis usually empty all the time, mainly do to the fact that right next to the<br/>\nhigh blue/white con area you are in is either reds or greens, and most<br/>\ngroups  are casual with runners. The Temple of Cazic Thule I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nrecommend until mid to high 20&#39;s as the best spots to hunt at low to mid<br/>\n20&#39;s are dead ends in the maze, tight quarters to do crowd control in. High<br/>\nKeep basement is a popular area to hunt, so you would almost always be<br/>\nassured of finding a group (or more likely a list during primetimes), though<br/>\nspace is limited.<br/>\n<br/>\nLozi, level 40 ~ Hand of Chaos ~, CT<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 14 Jun 2000 11:55:41 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Melinda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warnock@...\">warnock@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Leveling etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello fellow enchanters, its me again :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am now level 22 and looking to leave Lake Rathe and head out to level<br/>\n </span></blockquote>elsewhere.
