Here&#39;s<br/>\nmy deal to you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\tYou may send me your<br/>\nStation Name and Password to my email address, along with<br/>\nthe server you are playing on, and I will give all<br/>\nyour characters what I see fit. If you like, you may<br/>\ninclude an exact list of what you want put on this<br/>\ncharacter...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\tNow, I know this may sound too good to be true, but<br/>\nVerant has really pissed me off this time, and I will be<br/>\nbooted in 3 months anyway... You don&#39;t have much time to<br/>\nwaste... Please Email me at this address, and I will<br/>\naccomplish what I&#39;ve always wanted to do... Get back at<br/>\nVerant, along with you, getting the best things in the<br/>\ngame for free... Doesn&#39;t matter much to me, but if you<br/>\nwant to be uber, follow my directions,,,, It&#39;ll be<br/>\ndone within the night.... Being, and having a GM<br/>\ncharacter, I can switch from server to server, so this can<br/>\napply to EVERYONE...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for you support<br/>\nin my endeavour....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asst.
