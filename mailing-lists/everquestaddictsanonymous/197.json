Some towns that you would<br/>\nnormally be ok to enter will kill you on site just for the<br/>\ngod that you worship. (it&#39;s called KOS killed on<br/>\nsite) Also though it may be a little hard to do and<br/>\nsome may dissagree with me I would suggest trying to<br/>\nget into a guild. Some only except higher lvl char<br/>\nbut there are a few that will take you as a newbie<br/>\nand teach you the ropes. I know that I would have had<br/>\na much harder time gaining lvls and obtaining cool<br/>\nequip. if it wasn&#39;t for the guild that I belong to. My<br/>\nguild is very newbie friendly and will help anyone with<br/>\nmost anything...such as tp (teleports), money, equip,<br/>\nbuffs, ect. It is always good to have friends in high<br/>\nplaces..:) anyway that is my two coppers worth. Go well and<br/>\ngood hunting friend!&lt;br&gt;simply ~Wyld~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
