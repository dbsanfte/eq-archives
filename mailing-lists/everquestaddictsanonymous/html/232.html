<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119800085">Kunark aye. Well heres some info on the area I&#39;ve<br/>
gone to. Lake of Ill Omen is a great place for lvls<br/>
21-24 if you go to the front entrance you can lvl to 25<br/>
in a couple of hours if you have a good group. Only<br/>
thing I hated about it was the short run from the town,<br/>
up the hill and into the Lake of Ill Omen zone.<br/>
Theres lots of spiders or things that look like spiders<br/>
that are high 20&#39;s that will whoop your a$$... trust<br/>
me I speak from experience, its hell getting your<br/>
corpse back from them too.</div>
