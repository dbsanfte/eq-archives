<div id="ygrps-yiv-948793555">Hi fellow Norrathians. I am Guide Deamer from the<br/>
Quellious server.... Due to illegal actions upon myself, I<br/>
am under investigation by Verant. This has caused me<br/>
great distress because I have been accused of many<br/>
things that I did not do. I am under investigation for<br/>
only 3 months, and then they will decide if my actions<br/>
were bad enough to boot me from the program... Here&#39;s<br/>
my deal to you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	You may send me your<br/>
Station Name and Password to my email address, along with<br/>
the server you are playing on, and I will give all<br/>
your characters what I see fit. If you like, you may<br/>
include an exact list of what you want put on this<br/>
character...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	Now, I know this may sound too good to be true, but<br/>
Verant has really pissed me off this time, and I will be<br/>
booted in 3 months anyway... You don&#39;t have much time to<br/>
waste... Please Email me at this address, and I will<br/>
accomplish what I&#39;ve always wanted to do... Get back at<br/>
Verant, along with you, getting the best things in the<br/>
game for free... Doesn&#39;t matter much to me, but if you<br/>
want to be uber, follow my directions,,,, It&#39;ll be<br/>
done within the night.... Being, and having a GM<br/>
character, I can switch from server to server, so this can<br/>
apply to EVERYONE...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for you support<br/>
in my endeavour....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asst. Guide Akiambo of<br/>
the quellious Server...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email at:<br/>
