<div id="ygrps-yiv-405212126">ive had everquest for about a month now and have<br/>
barely been able to play it at all because i get kicked<br/>
off every 5 minutes. this seemed kind of odd because<br/>
i have a cable connection, but qwest has very poor<br/>
service and i feel that this may be related to them. has<br/>
anyone else had a problem like this? any help would be<br/>
apreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;nate</div>
