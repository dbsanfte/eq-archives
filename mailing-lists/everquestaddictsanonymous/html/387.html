<b>Subject:</b> planes question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-538410258">I was just wondering i just hit lv40 with my<br/>
wizard and while i can&#39;t port to the plane of hate or<br/>
plane of sky untill 46. I was wondering if I could go<br/>
to the planes with that you can simply travel too on<br/>
foot? Are they safe to go into yet? If not what should<br/>
be the minimum lv i can&#39;t find any sites dealing<br/>
with planes so its just one big mystery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thank<br/>
you &lt;br&gt;Riyoga &lt;br&gt;lv40 Wizard&lt;br&gt;Vazelle</div>
