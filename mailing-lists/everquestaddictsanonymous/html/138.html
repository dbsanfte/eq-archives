<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121647332">lol, the game can be very addicting, it just<br/>
depends on how you play and why you play, the pro&#39;s of<br/>
this game is that it is fun, you meet people that have<br/>
a common interest, and all those people out there<br/>
will really understand exactly why you are on the game<br/>
in all your spare moments, the con&#39;s are that it<br/>
does get addicting, and if you aren&#39;t careful, it Can<br/>
take over your life and it does make those around you<br/>
a little upset.... &lt;br&gt;Myystical Twilight</div>
