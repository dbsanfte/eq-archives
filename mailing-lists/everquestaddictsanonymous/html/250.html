<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870623249">HEHE-- fellow addicts -- i love it!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here<br/>
are some things I do--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. When I&#39;m hungry and<br/>
want to play EQ, I&#39;ll put some bread or muffins and<br/>
milk or water in a bag or a backpack, and hope that<br/>
somehow I automatically eat them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. When I&#39;m<br/>
driving (usually home to play EQ) and someone cuts me off<br/>
or I see a red light, I&#39;ll start hearing that<br/>
familiar battle music. Also happens when someone ticks me<br/>
off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. When working out (which I do very<br/>
little of now that EQ flexes my brain, mouse hand, and<br/>
typing fingers plenty), I&#39;ll /con other guys in the gym.<br/>
If I keep benching and squating, maybe that guy in<br/>
the Everlast shirt will end up &quot;you would have the<br/>
upper hand,&quot; instead of &quot;tombstone.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. I run<br/>
everywhere. Why would you walk? Also, if I get fatigued, I<br/>
sit down with my legs crossed and open up a book.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. I&#39;ve seen this posted on other boards, and find<br/>
myself with the same desire to jump into any body of<br/>
watter to practice my swimming skill. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. When I<br/>
get change at a restuarant, I look at each $1.00 and<br/>
think &quot;Hey, 9 more and i&#39;ll have a plat.!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7.<br/>
When I&#39;m at the store, and can&#39;t find my something I<br/>
really want, I have the urge to shout &quot;Want to buy<br/>
___x___, send tell!!!&quot; But then I remember that I should<br/>
/auction instead of /shout, so I just quitely check the<br/>
shelf again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. When on-line in a chat room<br/>
with friends (which happens less often now, because<br/>
that&#39;s time I could be on EQ), my friends are perplexed<br/>
when each of my entries starts with &quot;/g ____&quot; or<br/>
&quot;/tell Steve ____&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9. On the same line, I was in<br/>
a chat room with 3 friends last week and one friend<br/>
was being a jerk. So I type &quot;/tell Mike Dude, Steve&#39;s<br/>
lame! Why is he trying to blame you for HIS car running<br/>
out of gas?&quot; After I realized what I did (and still<br/>
partially in EQ-world), I typed &quot;uh... sorry, wrong<br/>
tell.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10. When at the mall, I was standing in line when I<br/>
noticed a really cute girl smiling at me. I immediately<br/>
thought &quot;/who all that hot chick&quot; And laughed when my<br/>
brain spit out -- &quot;Miranda, [High School Student]age17<br/>
latina, Los Angeles&quot; (Hmm... too low level to share<br/>
experience with). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;11. I was walking down the hall at<br/>
work, when an obnoxious co-worker say me. I tried to<br/>
&quot;hide,&quot; but I guess he had see invisible. After an<br/>
unpleasant encounter with him (which ended in me fleeing for<br/>
the zone -- aka elevator), I thought &quot;what a stupid<br/>
newbie mistake, he must have been undead-- THAT&#39;s what<br/>
hide wouldn&#39;t work&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;12. My dad was going to<br/>
give me this great TV because he was getting a new big<br/>
screen. He said &quot;do you want it?&quot; I said &quot;i&#39;m kinda low<br/>
on plat right now, haven&#39;t banked lately.&quot; He looked<br/>
at me like I was nuts, and said, &quot;no, i&#39;ll give it<br/>
to you.&quot; I hesitated for a minute, wondering if this<br/>
kind of twinking was ok. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;13. I am convinced<br/>
that my sense heading is maxed out, so I never travel<br/>
with a map. Then I wish I hadn&#39;t been been too cheap<br/>
to buy True North when my girlfriend says &quot;You have<br/>
no idea what direction you&#39;re facing!!!&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;14.<br/>
I recently took 2 days off from EQ to go to Vegas.<br/>
I won a big hand in poker, and yelled out &quot;WOOT&quot;!!<br/>
Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, except the<br/>
blackjack dealer at the next table, who walked by me and<br/>
said quietly, &quot;Xersi on the Drinal server.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;15.<br/>
I renamed my dog Gobabaner. I have to constantly<br/>
repeat comands to him, because he&#39;s as thick as a water<br/>
elemental. /pet back off, /pet guard here. When I leave him<br/>
inside sometimes, I wonder who wandered by and cast<br/>
Burnout on him-- he always seems &quot;to go<br/>
berzerk.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are more, but I need to get back to the game. /g<br/>
See you all on-line!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;20th<br/>
