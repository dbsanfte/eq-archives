<div id="ygrps-yiv-211805620">hehehe--- I was on vallon zek, ever scince i was<br/>
but a young iksar... now that iksar got PKed and my<br/>
life savings wich i was foolishly carrying around is<br/>
gone... oh well... thats why i made my dwarf. i was<br/>
wondering, is it possable to move characters from one server<br/>
to another? i want to move to the new Sullon zek<br/>
one, it sounds alot more fun w/ out all those level<br/>
restrictions(like i can only fight people within 8 levels of me...<br/>
I HATE THAT RULE... IT MUST GO!). Well, Peace out<br/>
