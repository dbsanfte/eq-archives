<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143254586">You don&#39;t post very much... you call yourselves<br/>
addicts? for shame!!&lt;br&gt;hmm well.. I guess it would be<br/>
completely logical to not post very often if you were an<br/>
extreme EQ junkie.. Obviously you cant post while playing<br/>
the game....&lt;br&gt;You know what is odd though... you<br/>
see its 2:40 am right now I need to wake up in about<br/>
4 and a half hours but I am wasting my time on the<br/>
internet.. Now: the odd thing is most of the time I get more<br/>
of a kick out of talking about Everquest than<br/>
actually playing... Playing takes too much work... bleh...<br/>
killing stuff.. no more twisting ! agg!&lt;br&gt;Ok I am done..<br/>
sorry I am just so bored right now... very tired but<br/>
too lazy to go to bed =/&lt;br&gt;(yes I have problems<br/>
