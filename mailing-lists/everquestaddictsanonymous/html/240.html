<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043959299">So you wish to try out a Rogue aye! Well that<br/>
is&lt;br&gt;a good choice. Rogues can become skilled in<br/>
poison&lt;br&gt;making and applying the poisons to their weapons<br/>
they&lt;br&gt;also receive a highly effective skill known<br/>
as&lt;br&gt;backstab. Pretty much like sneaking up on the prey<br/>
and&lt;br&gt;slitting its throat.If its hand to hand your after&lt;br&gt;the<br/>
Monk will be your path but be forewarned they<br/>
may&lt;br&gt;have a hard hit and many intriguing moves but<br/>
they&lt;br&gt;also have a low weight limit for they must be<br/>
nimble&lt;br&gt;and agile on their journeys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As<br/>
for jumping.&lt;br&gt;There is no combat form of jumping<br/>
but you can use jump&lt;br&gt;to get ahead of whatever prey<br/>
has decided it wants&lt;br&gt;you to be the prey. You can<br/>
jump as you run away from&lt;br&gt;the beast that has<br/>
exposed your bum to the elements&lt;br&gt;so as not to loose a<br/>
cheek.</div>
