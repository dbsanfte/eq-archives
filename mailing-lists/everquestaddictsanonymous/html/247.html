<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583969876">NEARLY 28 HOURS STRAIGHT???? That&#39;s great!! My<br/>
poor record is only 8 hours. Wow, you have an<br/>
understanding fiancee-- or, maybe by this time &quot;HAD&quot; should be<br/>
used?? hehe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m glad to hear that the game still<br/>
has a strong pull for those who have high level<br/>
characters. I&#39;ve heard that some people burn out at/about lvl<br/>
30. I know some people that have a stagnant lvl 30ish<br/>
char (or 2) and who constantly play new characters<br/>
instead. I hope to get one or two chars to lvl 60, but I<br/>
don&#39;t see that happening for a LONG time!!!<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Play on my friends, play on.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela<br/>
