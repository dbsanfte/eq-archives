<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095094458">I have a char on Bristlebane, a cute little<br/>
hredhead human monk named Menile, but I had a problem with<br/>
some people on there sometime ago and barely ever play<br/>
her now. I mostly play on Erollisi Marr now, where I<br/>
have 8 chars, but mostly just play three. Anyone on<br/>
Erollisi feel free to send me a tell if you see me on, I&#39;m<br/>
normally either playing Darkwyynd, Treeflyer, or Ibiara.</div>
