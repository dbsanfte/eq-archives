<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903727044">hey everyone. I joined this club to ask questions<br/>
about Ever Quest. See, i dont have the game, but i&#39;m<br/>
considering it. I just wanted to know if you all think it&#39;s<br/>
worth it. Plus, what is it about exactly? Like, what do<br/>
you do in it? I&#39;ve heard a little about it and<br/>
thought it sounded interesting, but i&#39;m not entirely sure<br/>
what it&#39;s about. Is there a demo i could get<br/>
somewhere? I checked everquest.com and couldnt find one,<br/>
maybe i just missed it. thanks.</div>
