<div id="ygrps-yiv-846069776">Good to see lots of activity here!! I joke about<br/>
Xev, because i RARELY see anyone on a board from Xev<br/>
posting anything. Here&#39;s an &quot;addicts&quot; question, how many<br/>
characters do you have, on how many servers????&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As<br/>
for hunting options -- what class/race are you and on<br/>
what continent?? Grouping is ALWAYS good after level<br/>
5. Try to get into full groups in CB, or in<br/>
Steamfont by the mino caves, or in BB at any one of the<br/>
many camps. Full groups give a 20% XP bonus!!! It<br/>
makes the game, USUALLY, more fun to play, also.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone got some 411 on OOT and Kunark?? I have never<br/>
been to either, and am wanting to<br/>
adventure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 17th season</div>
