<div id="ygrps-yiv-626619516">Well, there is no best place to hunt, but to find<br/>
a place nearby and lvl up there. I myself, when i<br/>
was 7, stayed in Blackburrow until 11 and then<br/>
travelled to Butcherblock. Blackburrow is a good place i<br/>
guess, you can go from 1 to 19 there, but ya have to be<br/>
used to the newbies trains =) I face the same thing<br/>
from the experienced players in Sol B! Dungeons are<br/>
crazy, but very fun =) Good Luck and Happy<br/>
