<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077494787">My personal opinion is that you should not be<br/>
&quot;very pissed&quot; as you put it &quot;true wizard vamp&quot;... the<br/>
full suit of totemic was probably not a &quot;gift&quot; from<br/>
someone else but rather gathered by another one of his<br/>
characters (of obviosly a higher level) therefore he has<br/>
spent the &quot;play time&quot; to get a character high enough to<br/>
earn totemic armor and if the character wearing it did<br/>
not get it himself the player playing the character<br/>
still spent the time and money to get the armor (just<br/>
on another character) so it was still earned... in<br/>
my humble opinion at least...&lt;br&gt;also on tribunal by<br/>
the way...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anomia Poisonwolf 41st<br/>
