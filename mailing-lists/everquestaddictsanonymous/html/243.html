<div id="ygrps-yiv-226903668">*yawn* Ok, i&#39;ll get serious then. (But if you&#39;re<br/>
not convinced from our passion about the game, then<br/>
maybe we have to appeal to our explanation of how great<br/>
the game play is). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combat is only a part of<br/>
this game (though, i suppose, every character does a<br/>
lot of it). Casters mostly focus on spells, but you<br/>
haven&#39;t shown much interest (yet) in those classes, so on<br/>
to melee combat. Most combat is auto-combat. Click<br/>
to attack a certain enemy and your char<br/>
automatically swings its weapon to try to hit. You can hit,<br/>
miss, avoid getting hit, etc. depending on your skill<br/>
in the particular weapon type, your offense or<br/>
defense skill, and your char&#39;s dexterity/agility etc. You<br/>
still control moving around AND you can still choose<br/>
and cast spells (if you are a class that has spells).<br/>
You can also control and use special abilities, such<br/>
as backstab, kick, bash, slam (depending on what<br/>
race and class you are). At certain levels, certain<br/>
classes get automatic melee abilities, such as dual wield<br/>
(you can use 2 weapons), dual attack, dodge, parry,<br/>
etc.-- at very high levels, there are even more<br/>
abilities. MONKS get more special combat abilities, such as<br/>
eagle strike, roundhouse kick, feign death, flying<br/>
kick, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some weapons have special abilities<br/>
of their own, which will manifest during<br/>
combat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first, I though &quot;auto-combat&quot; was lame-- why<br/>
can&#39;t i just have a &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;slash&quot; button? But then i<br/>
learned that EQ is a social game, and it helps to have<br/>
auto combat so I can yell to my party during battle.<br/>
While bashing an Orc Oracle with my mace, I&#39;m hit with<br/>
a poison spell and can yell to my cleric parner<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m poisoned, help!!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He can disengage from<br/>
melee, and cure my poisoned state, heal me up if needed,<br/>
and resume bashing. I have come to love the combat<br/>
style. Look, i&#39;ve played a lot of games, as i&#39;m sure we<br/>
all have. If you like combat, if you like adventurous<br/>
games with brains, if you like to socialize at all (and<br/>
even if you don&#39;t-- EQ is still good), if you like to<br/>
role play, if you like to be constantly amazed by new<br/>
creatures, items, battles, spells, places, stories,<br/>
people.... you cannot pass up this game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you like<br/>
N&#39;sync concerts, barbie dolls, smoking crack in a dark<br/>
alley, playing canasta (sp) with your grandparents on a<br/>
saturday night, flying helecopters in Korea, changing<br/>
diapers at a day care for a living, dressing up like a<br/>
woman and performing a song review 3 nights a week, or<br/>
reading the Wall Street Journal on the commuter train---<br/>
this game is STILL probably for you!!! (Except for the<br/>
someone smoking crack in a dark alley, which who needs<br/>
crack when we have Evercrack, i&#39;ve met all of the above<br/>
people on line). All walks of life, all races, genders,<br/>
classes, lifestyles enjoy this game. Some people get into<br/>
true roll play, some people spam the zones they&#39;re in<br/>
with &quot;WHAAZZZZUUUUUPPPPPP????&quot; The bottom line is that<br/>
the game rocks, AND with the new patches constantly<br/>
working at fixing (mostly) the game to make it better,<br/>
and new expansions every year to increase the game&#39;s<br/>
attraction (can you say Shadows of Luclin????!!!!), it is<br/>
literally a game you could play for Ever(quest).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;20th Season<br/>
