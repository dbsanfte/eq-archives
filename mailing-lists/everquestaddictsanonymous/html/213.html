<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199063057">Ok at lvl 6 if you are in or near East<br/>
commonlands go there and get a group at the small orc camp<br/>
and stay there for about 3-4 lvls and go to the large<br/>
one and at hat point in time when you are about 11-12<br/>
go to a zone called oasis and kill things there til<br/>
16 when you get 16 you go to ill omen and stay there<br/>
until 30...then at that point n time you will havee<br/>
friends to tell yo what to do............Now that is<br/>
where to go if you are human and things like<br/>
that...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Eq guru</div>
