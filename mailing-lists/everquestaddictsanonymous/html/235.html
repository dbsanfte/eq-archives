<div id="ygrps-yiv-450745806">Hello. You&#39;ve come to the right place to ask<br/>
questions and finding out about it before you buy it is a<br/>
wise decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally I think the game is<br/>
well worth it... after about 2 days of playing it<br/>
after I bought it I was addicted. EQ is the first game<br/>
thats ever been addictive to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ, to me, is a<br/>
place to go to interact with people from all over the<br/>
world and immerse myself in a role totally different<br/>
than the real world. I play to get away from the<br/>
reality, to kick back and relax and have tons of<br/>
fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the game you run around a vast world spanning 5<br/>
continents (and soon to be a moon if my info on the new<br/>
expansion is correct) and hundreds of different zones in<br/>
search of relics that can complete your inventory and<br/>
while doing so you take down foes that appose you. All<br/>
the while your trying to become the best of your race<br/>
and class and make your god proud by following what<br/>
s/he stands for. Theres even some PvP servers that<br/>
allow you to take on other player<br/>
characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Umm about the demo; I&#39;m not sure there is a demo out<br/>
there. If there is I&#39;ve never seen it. If theres anymore<br/>
questions you need answered feel free to post or send me an<br/>
email at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:boggs87413_69@...">boggs87413_69@...</a></div>
