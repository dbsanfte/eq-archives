<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362038408">Hey all, I just started playing last week, and I<br/>
am finally getting a feel for the game. Can anybody<br/>
recommend any decent servers? I can&#39;t remember which one<br/>
I&#39;m on now, but I&#39;ve noticed some of them lag. And<br/>
can anybody offer any advice for a little halfling<br/>
rogue?</div>
