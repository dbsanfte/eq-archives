<b>Subject:</b> Cheating Scum! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-393314075">craigbal and you other newbies... I dont know<br/>
what levels you are but you cant be too high... people<br/>
who are around level 25 or over know cheating is the<br/>
lamest, most wussy thing you could ever do on an ONLINE<br/>
GAME. I do not like starting fights in someone elses<br/>
forums but COME ON its an online game and your trying to<br/>
cheat... Wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if you are someone who<br/>
cant stand going through life on EQ wearing a suit of<br/>
Leather and Banded armor using your rusty sword. People<br/>
must really suck if they need to cheat. Heck, I have<br/>
trudged through 54 levels, and without cheating I am a<br/>
level 54 Cavalier (Cavalier = Paladin who has passed<br/>
level 50) and I have never gone as low to try and<br/>
CHEAT/HACK the game to get &#39;phat l3wtz&#39;. Cheating is for the<br/>
pure newbie. Plus if Verant catches you exploiting<br/>
bugs or hacking account gets automatically banned.<br/>
Cheating is a huge thing to them. Be like the rest of us,<br/>
to be proud to fight for your earnings and not just<br/>
walk through the whole game by exploiting bugs and<br/>
getting &#39;phat l3wtz&#39;. Its not like I NEVER complain about<br/>
camping rare spawns for my Deepwater armor and stuff like<br/>
that but cheating is going just too low. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just<br/>
my two copper...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sereth (Seffar)</div>
