<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924853576">New club member here. I had a tough time getting<br/>
into the game at first. I chose a newer server (Xev)<br/>
and a gnome mage. There were never that many people<br/>
in my zone (Steamfont), i couldn&#39;t summon a pet yet,<br/>
and a found myself running madly from spiderlings all<br/>
the time. The only good thing about being a gnome is<br/>
that there are TONS of low level quests in Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>
This made it bearable. (My wood elf druid char. gets<br/>
only one lame quest, but you can do a couple of the<br/>
other class quests that are ok). Plus, there&#39;s not<br/>
really any point in grouping at newbie levels. BUT, when<br/>
I got to about lvl 5, things changed and I headed<br/>
off to GFay - to orc hill, CB, and off to BB for some<br/>
new views. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every level gets better and<br/>
better, and there are more quests, items, spells, and<br/>
trade skill abilities as you keep going. I was in a<br/>
great CB throne room group that took down Emp Crush and<br/>
D&#39;Vinn - my pet sacrificed itself so that we all could<br/>
regroup and finish the job. 2 of the group members were<br/>
in the same guild, and immediately asked me to join.<br/>
There have been no limits to the help i&#39;ve gotten<br/>
since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;d love to hear from anyone from Xev!!!! I have a<br/>
lvl16 druid and lvl 16 mage. Honestly, i like playing<br/>
the druid better - but now that i&#39;m at level 16 with<br/>
the mage, i can tinker and do spell research - which<br/>
seems fun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This site seems like it&#39;s for people<br/>
like me - Ever wish you sould give a /tell to your<br/>
friend when you&#39;re next to any annoying person? When I<br/>
go to a party, I always want to &quot;/who all&quot; to see<br/>
who&#39;s there. And are any of you married?? Oh, man - my<br/>
wife is not a gamer, and i&#39;ve learned that when we<br/>
made plans to visit her mother, she does not care if<br/>
there is a weekend long guild war. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope to hear<br/>
from you all!!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela of Xev&lt;br&gt;Wood elf druid<br/>
