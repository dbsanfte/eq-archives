<div id="ygrps-yiv-459678816">WTF!! Which in this case means Way Too Funny.<br/>
This was funny the first time, but even better as a<br/>
&quot;rip off.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What sever? Tunare? or is that just<br/>
your wonderful choice of godess? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High Elf<br/>
Karioke is on Friday Nights in the Felwithe Cleric Guild.<br/>
Keep it clean though, those High Elf clerics are very<br/>
pious and don&#39;t take kindly to all that rock and roll.<br/>
(Notice how there are no High Elf Bards??) &quot;What are you<br/>
kids listening too? That&#39;s Innorruk<br/>
music!!!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 35th<br/>
prayer&lt;br&gt;Xev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&#39;m 35 now, but still fight, drink, play, and smith<br/>
like a teenager!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Is that a good thing??&quot;</div>
