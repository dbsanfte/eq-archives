<div id="ygrps-yiv-522922546">Let me put it this way, I lead a guild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In<br/>
order to lead a guild you either HAVE to be addicted or<br/>
you end up having a crappy guild. =) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve<br/>
played since beta 4, my longest hiatus was one month. My<br/>
main is a 41 enchanter on Rallos Zek. I have a<br/>
multitude of other characters! I have a 16 enchanter, a 15<br/>
paladin, a 15 cleric, and about 10 other characters from<br/>
levels 7-11&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My longest stint was probably 12<br/>
hours, I have stayed home from work and ended up<br/>
&quot;feeling better&quot; and playing EQ all day =) I also spend<br/>
way too many of my work hours on message<br/>
boards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My husband keeps me in check for the most part, he<br/>
plays a bit but isn&#39;t addicted at all. He plays only<br/>
when we play together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would say the most<br/>
addictive thing for me is the social aspect, which will<br/>
never go away no matter what level you get to!</div>
