<b>Subject:</b> This is my kind of club... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280667542">I play with two other people. Two of us have been<br/>
playing about a month and are up to level 14. The third<br/>
player is more experienced and is the one responsible<br/>
for our addiction... lol He started a new character<br/>
with us and is now level 15. Tonight the server went<br/>
down for scheduled maintenance or something like that.<br/>
We told ourselves if we were still on when that<br/>
happened we needed to seek counseling. Well, we were on<br/>
within five minutes of shut down. I found this club and<br/>
figured I was home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I look forward to reading all<br/>
the past posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dalorian&lt;br&gt;level 14 enchanter</div>
