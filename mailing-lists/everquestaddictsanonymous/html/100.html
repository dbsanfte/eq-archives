<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132785564">try going to the everquest home page at<br/>
everquest.com look thru the faq, although I doubt that your<br/>
problem will be there, then E-mail them and tell them<br/>
what is going on. Other than that, I can&#39;t think of<br/>
anything else that you can do. Anyone else have any ideas?</div>
