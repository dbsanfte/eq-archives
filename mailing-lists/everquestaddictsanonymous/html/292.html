<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473444298">Oasis of Marr. I hate the place personally, but<br/>
it is really good exp at level 15. I have 3 alts<br/>
around that level currently and haven&#39;t really found a<br/>
zone that is easier to level in than Oasis.. It is<br/>
good to solo in and there are also plenty of people to<br/>
group with. &lt;br&gt;other ideas to try out - lavastorm,<br/>
najena, befallen, everfrost, the warrens... Maybe the<br/>
prisoners in highkeep too I&#39;m not sure what level they are<br/>
but I remember fighting them at 14 with my cleric.<br/>
