<div id="ygrps-yiv-558509782">Well the monk is now lvl 40(2yellows and 2 blue into it). Just had a <br/>
Kaesora raid and it was awesome! Experience was great and loot <br/>
fantastic! Got the VERY rare drop Shield of Spectral Essence<br/>
(3kpp) ,Rod of Battle(rare), 3 fangs for HS keys, Lotsa other great <br/>
loot. I got the Rod of Battle so now i have my 2hb weapon to train <br/>
with. If i thought that there was enough peeps reading/using this <br/>
board i&#39;d share some serious secrets with you all, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to be used/looked at much.</div>
