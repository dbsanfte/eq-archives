<div id="ygrps-yiv-891620071">I was camping the AoF in a group in Cazic Thule<br/>
the other day. I targeted him when he spawned, popped<br/>
up in bubble and then disappeared. Dumb little<br/>
werewolf-like creature then disappeared! Never found him =( Is<br/>
he supposed to wander from the bubble?</div>
