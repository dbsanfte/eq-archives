<div id="ygrps-yiv-128199528">Great suggestion-- i don&#39;t dual much, but i think<br/>
you can get melee skills up well that way. Either<br/>
that, or get in a group that doesn&#39;t need much healing<br/>
and bash away as much as possible-- your hits won&#39;t<br/>
agro much, so your offense and weapon skills are the<br/>
only ones like to go up this way--unless you can agro<br/>
with spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suggestion-- before you try these<br/>
things, layer up on all DEX and AGI items/buffs you can<br/>
find. This will help your offense/defense/weapon skills<br/>
go up quicker. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can&#39;t train in<br/>
offense/defense-- : (&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottom Line, though--- how much melee<br/>
do you really think you&#39;ll be doing?? Defense will<br/>
go up if you keep healing and agroing things on you.<br/>
I fought the good fight as a druid and still would<br/>
melee up to about lvl 29. I still melee when soloing<br/>
SOMETIMES-- more often though i&#39;ll do classic root kiting and<br/>
never pick up a weapon, i&#39;d rather hold somthing that<br/>
gives me more WIS or Mana. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would you be screwed<br/>
if you didn&#39;t up your melee skills at all?? Not<br/>
really. Would you be screwed if you didn&#39;t up your<br/>
Alteration at every level-- DEFINITELY!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela<br/>
