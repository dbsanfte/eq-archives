<div id="ygrps-yiv-814081348">I agree with the response mostly but would also<br/>
like to add that when choosing a god I would really<br/>
try to choose a char that can be agnostic...it will<br/>
cause you less problems. Some towns that you would<br/>
normally be ok to enter will kill you on site just for the<br/>
god that you worship. (it&#39;s called KOS killed on<br/>
site) Also though it may be a little hard to do and<br/>
some may dissagree with me I would suggest trying to<br/>
get into a guild. Some only except higher lvl char<br/>
but there are a few that will take you as a newbie<br/>
and teach you the ropes. I know that I would have had<br/>
a much harder time gaining lvls and obtaining cool<br/>
equip. if it wasn&#39;t for the guild that I belong to. My<br/>
guild is very newbie friendly and will help anyone with<br/>
most anything...such as tp (teleports), money, equip,<br/>
buffs, ect. It is always good to have friends in high<br/>
places..:) anyway that is my two coppers worth. Go well and<br/>
good hunting friend!&lt;br&gt;simply ~Wyld~</div>
