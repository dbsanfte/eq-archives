<div id="ygrps-yiv-42739686">LONG haul to LOIO-- actually, Stonebrunt is<br/>
closer to you. Best way--get a port to BB and take the<br/>
shuttles to Kunark. Worst Way--get a port to Dreadlands,<br/>
and try to run across to FV. Not safe, I do it at lvl<br/>
35 and still get scared. (but what do i know, i&#39;m a<br/>
wimpy tree-hugging druid). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SK is where you&#39;ll<br/>
want to be soon. XP AND loot are great at the spires.<br/>
LOIO is great xp, but the loot is not very good<br/>
(except a few of the SHM only items that drop off<br/>
sarnys). You can fill up on FS and SP gear (gloves are<br/>
best, sell for at least 20pp each on Xev).<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW-- I LOVED the 20s, they went by too fast and now<br/>
i&#39;m stuck in 30s--:9&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh-- I got to lvl 20<br/>
fighting Orcs in HHP-- hence the surname Orcbane.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 35th Circle&lt;br&gt;Defenders<br/>
of Mithril Hall&lt;br&gt;Xev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I am now of the 35th<br/>
season, and have attained the rank of Tunare&#39;s shoe<br/>
sniffer-- WOOT!!!&quot;</div>
