<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124984980">Hi everybody. I don&#39;t play EverQuest now, but I<br/>
plan to get on within the month. I used to play on a<br/>
friend&#39;s account.(Anybody know Hackeneck on Tunare?)<br/>
Anyway I was wondering what race/class combinations have<br/>
worked for you, what doesn&#39;t and so on. I&#39;ve had some<br/>
pretty good success with Barbarian/Human Warriors. And I<br/>
hear that Clerics are pretty good. Anyway, any advice<br/>
you can give will be appreiciated. Thanks.</div>
