<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010388590">Ah, I don&#39;t need to worry about it. I turned in 5 more belts, got <br/>
good faction, then got sick of it altogether. So, I traveled back to <br/>
my hometown (this is my 3rd time traveling back and forth between the <br/>
two) and i deposited all of my money gains from there, and i now have <br/>
over 100p (for the first time in Zakassis&#39;s lifetime) and actually <br/>
kept it there.<br/>

&gt; you can waste halflings and high elves around the spires<br/>
&gt; and they give you faction boost in Neriak<br/>
&gt; you loose faction with the high elves and halflings though<br/>
&gt; but do you really care what the good softshells think?<br/>
