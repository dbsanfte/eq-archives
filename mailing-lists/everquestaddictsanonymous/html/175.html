<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088472779">Yo i just made this new guild and i am looking<br/>
for cool people that want to join it and we will have<br/>
some fun with other stuff(which i haven&#39;t desided what<br/>
we would but i will find something fun). We will<br/>
make EverQuest even more famous. What ever you people<br/>
want to do is fine but If you join now you will be a<br/>
leader on another server if you are on on another<br/>
server. The Guild will be based at Freeport when i have<br/>
the money to buy a hall. The Club name is EverQuest<br/>
Server Bartoxxlous or something like that. Newbies are<br/>
welcome to join. There will also be a protection agency<br/>
and a bounty hunter agency if you want to join then<br/>
be my guest to join. The description may be bad but<br/>
it will be fun anyway. So if you want to join go<br/>
ahead.</div>
