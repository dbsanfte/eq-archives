<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979576916">I got this game yesterday as a gift from my<br/>
daughter. I figured out some of it, but i guess i really<br/>
screwed up. My daughter is level 54 and gave me a bunch<br/>
of stuff and after she left, some creature killed me<br/>
in level 2 and i didn&#39;t know i had to go back and<br/>
get all my stuff, so i just stopped for the night and<br/>
now i find out i lost all my stuff....i&#39;m really<br/>
bummed. I&#39;m not sure i&#39;m gonna like this game.</div>
