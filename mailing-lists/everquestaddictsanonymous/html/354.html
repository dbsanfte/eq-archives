<b>Subject:</b> DOAC-- is the EQ addiction wearing off?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973175643">My answer is a resounding &quot;no&quot;-- but what do you<br/>
think? I know my guild has lost about 1/2 dozen to DOAC.<br/>
I also know about the same # who have already come<br/>
back to EQ from DOAC. I hear it&#39;s cool and different,<br/>
but i&#39;m just not interested in leaving EQ at all-- I<br/>
mean, I&#39;ve never even been to the Mines of<br/>
Nurga!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AND-- i started playing on the roleplay server, which<br/>
has strengthened my addiction 100 fold!!! I just wish<br/>
there were more halflings to talk too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other<br/>
games have come and gone-- I used to play a little bit<br/>
of a lot of games until i got EQ a year ago. Some<br/>
people are saying that 2 years is the max cut off-- that<br/>
everyone gets tired of it by that time-- well then-- i&#39;ve<br/>
got another year to go!!!! And with Luclin coming<br/>
soon, and the fact that i haven&#39;t played a PvP char<br/>
yet-- i&#39;d say i&#39;m set for as long as Verant will take<br/>
my +/-$10.00/month (which, i&#39;m sure, would be long<br/>
after the stop supporting EQ-- haha). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any<br/>
thoughts??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xev---&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Serrafina Elemistress&lt;br&gt;Mandir<br/>
