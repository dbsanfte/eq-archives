<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922673192">I finally got most of my goals! These are the goals I have achieved <br/>
as of 4/24/02:<br/>
<br/>
1. Gained lvl 20<br/>
2. Got married<br/>
3. Got a faster weapon<br/>
4. 400+ to all major stats - HP, AC, and ATK(1HB)<br/>
5. Achieved 100p in bank<br/>
<br/>
I will post my other achieved goals as I complete them. However, EQ <br/>
is trying to say that &quot;I am not subscribed&quot; when I chose a billing <br/>
plan. I might be able to reconnect the beginning of March. While I <br/>
wait, I&#39;m improving my skills in Team Fortress.<br/>
