<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317593523">I don&#39;t know about the others but I have my fav.<br/>
links on my profile page. I just need to update my<br/>
pics,and I will as soon as I remember how I did it. I just<br/>
tried(I tried to send a screenshot from my EQ file, and<br/>
it told me I had the wrong format). Anyone know how<br/>
to change our bitmap screenshots unto a jpeg or<br/>
something else that will work???&lt;br&gt; Myself and about a<br/>
half dozen other peps(including our founder!)have<br/>
tried to post pics on the &quot;Photos&quot; link on the left<br/>
&lt;-&lt;-&lt;- there,but only three knew how to do it right.<br/>
Would someone enlighten us on how to post Screen Shots.<br/>
I and I&#39;m sure,other fellow addicts would like to<br/>
see our brothers and sisters in action. &lt;br&gt; &quot;Keep<br/>
comming back,it works&quot; Lowlap of Prexus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. I<br/>
have some awsome shots of the Goddess,TUNARE,making a<br/>
rare apperance in Greater Faydark. It was the most<br/>
spiritual moment I have had playing EQ!! I would be happy<br/>
to retell the experiance and post some pics if peps<br/>
want to hear about it.</div>
