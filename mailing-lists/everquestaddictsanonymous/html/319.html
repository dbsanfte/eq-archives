<div id="ygrps-yiv-675454303">What you really need is to get yourself a<br/>
bodyguard...like a Ranger, for instance...and go travelling with<br/>
him. I&#39;m sure that he&#39;d be more than happy to bash<br/>
things for you and let you loot for the healing and<br/>
buffs you could offer ;-) Your offensive spells will be<br/>
worth FAR more in battle than your mace arm. BUT...if<br/>
its REALLY important to you...just bash on things<br/>
with everyone else...so long as no one is in danger of<br/>
dying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quynnelleon&lt;br&gt;Ranger&lt;br&gt;Cleric Meat-Shield &lt;br&gt;Bane of Goblin<br/>
