<div id="ygrps-yiv-885838665">I have told many ppl of this club over the last<br/>
few days...I really like it here. It is nice to meet<br/>
ppl who do not think I am odd because I am a mom who<br/>
plays EQ and RPG&#39;s for entertainment. I have a rather<br/>
large imagination, and I love to use it. Writing is an<br/>
outlet, but I needed something else...EQ is it. So, to<br/>
the Powers That Be...Thank You!</div>
