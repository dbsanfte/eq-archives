<div id="ygrps-yiv-380053902">Hail all.&lt;br&gt; It has been like 20 months since I<br/>
attended a meeting here so I thought it was about time I<br/>
checked in.&lt;br&gt; Oh yeah, I forgot how to speak at one of<br/>
these meetings.&lt;br&gt; My name is Lowlap,and I&#39;m an<br/>
addict.I have been using (err, i mean playing) Everquest<br/>
for about to years now. I thought I had a grip on my<br/>
addiction. I thought I could be like normal people and just<br/>
play a little now and then. I stopped comming to<br/>
meetings,got a new job and just played on the weekends. But<br/>
before I knew what had happened I was hooked again. I<br/>
find myself thinking of EQ day and night. Many nights<br/>
I just sleep at the keyboard so I have right there<br/>
when I wake up in the mourning.Ow well, once an addict<br/>
always and addict. I havn&#39;t made a post here since<br/>
Jan.2000 but now I&#39;m back in the fold and it feels so good<br/>
to be around all you othere addicts.&lt;br&gt; Is founding<br/>
Father M-ikee still around ? I believe he hails from<br/>
Florida. Anyway, I promiss to up date my profile soon and<br/>
&quot;Keep Comming Back&quot; as they say in another 12 step<br/>
program! Lowlap is 30-31(I keep losing my level) now and<br/>
hanging around the Frountier Mnts. I have a little<br/>
brother now and dad spends alot of time with him( I hate<br/>
the little Bas**rd ),his name is Xaxaxa Xoxox and i<br/>
think he is in The Lake of Ill Omen or some such god<br/>
awful place!&lt;br&gt; Hope to meet you all soon,keep safe<br/>
and SoW&#39;ed. Lowlap Dancer (those damn GM&#39;s took my<br/>
real last name,so I had to change it to<br/>
Balerin[spanish for dancer!]).</div>
