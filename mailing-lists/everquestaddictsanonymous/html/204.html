<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071260781">Well I have played now for 3 days and so far it<br/>
seems like a stupid game. What are the goals? What are<br/>
we supposed to be doing?...other than just walking<br/>
around fighting stuff. Is there no thinking<br/>
involved?...nothing to find? What is it all about? Just seems like<br/>
nothing more frustration at this point. Maybe I expected<br/>
more. I had visions of something like the old Legend of<br/>
Zelda. ...you know? Why is it dark all the time?</div>
