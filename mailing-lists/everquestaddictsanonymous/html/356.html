<b>Subject:</b> I cannot get in the game <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-867299727">I have a new computer with windows XP and when I<br/>
try to get in the game it gets as far as the server<br/>
page, when i click play EQ it does not go to the Char<br/>
screen but back to the sign on screen where you put in<br/>
your password. I have asked EQ and they have no idea<br/>
what is wrong couse XP is a such a new program, I also<br/>
asked microsoft and they can&#39;t figure it out. I even<br/>
disabled the Built in Firewall on XP, but still nothing<br/>
helps. I am going nuts without playing. I am on the<br/>
Tribunal server and have a Druid thats lvl 48. UGGGGG Can<br/>
anyone help?</div>
