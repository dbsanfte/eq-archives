<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757143004">My brother still hasn&#39;t gotten off his credit card payments, and the <br/>
deadlin draws even nearer. I now have less than a month to get back <br/>
on my character, rehabilitate, and explain to my wife what has been <br/>
going on. Seems to me I&#39;ll have to do a major patch-up on a EQ <br/>
relationship, and have to make up some major levels. If the deadline <br/>
isn&#39;t reached, I&#39;ll have to restart my 24 Iksar Shaman, who has lots <br/>
of good stuff (about 150p in total) and start from scratch again. It <br/>
might take awhile to explain it to my wife, but whatever works, <br/>
works, right?<br/>
