<div id="ygrps-yiv-838167145">*dances around like an idiot*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally hit<br/>
lv 56 Knight. And I need one more peice of Deepwater<br/>
Armor before its complete. *is proud*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhow<br/>
glugnus, if this is your very first time, my suggestion to<br/>
you is delete your Shadow Knight and start a new<br/>
char. Why? Because Shadow Knights are a very bad class<br/>
for new people, and Troll is a very bad race for new<br/>
people. Both get killed easily by monsters and NPCs.<br/>
Start a character of a good race, religion and class<br/>
and i guarantee the game will be 5 times funner for<br/>
you. Dont start a shadow knight until you&#39;ve had lots<br/>
of experience, and want to commit enough time to<br/>
level up your SK. SKs (shadow knights) level slowly. My<br/>
advice is pick an Elven race or Halfling. Halflings<br/>
level quite fast, and they&#39;re hunting area is very nice<br/>
for a long time. Dont go into Human race, because<br/>
they are practically blind in the dark. You wouldn&#39;t<br/>
beleive how many people always pick Human when they first<br/>
buy EQ. Dont do it. Unless perhaps you want to be a<br/>
Monk and dont want to be evil (iksar)(only humans and<br/>
iksar can be monk, and iksars are hated by a lot of<br/>
NPCs). So go with the Halfling or Elven race, if you<br/>
want the best out of the game. Classwise? Your own<br/>
choice. But I&#39;d stick away from Rogues if your new too.<br/>
They take some experience. classes like Mage, Necro<br/>
(sometimes), cleric, druid, warrior (especially), monk are<br/>
good for newer people. The other classes take a bit<br/>
more experience. Be warned though if you pic a<br/>
Necromancer many other races will hate you and probably<br/>
attack you on site. You need to be careful, but if you<br/>
level your necro up enough you&#39;ll be quite<br/>
powerful.&lt;br&gt;Dark Elf is the only evil race a newbie should go with<br/>
(even though you probably shouldn&#39;t) because they&#39;re<br/>
hometown is in a good area, its pretty close to Freeport<br/>
(human town) so theres lots of people in those areas.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope my advise has helped, and I know it sounds a<br/>
little confusing. Go on sites like<br/>
www.everlore.com&lt;br&gt;and everquest.allakhazam.com for info, and other<br/>
newbie help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seres Holyblade - Now Level 56<br/>
