<div id="ygrps-yiv-416280444">Thank goodness that the patch was done and access<br/>
was available by the time i got home from work. I can<br/>
only imaging the rocking back and forth, the shaking,<br/>
the hallucinations, and the cold sweats I would have<br/>
suffered through. Just thinking about no EQ makes me have<br/>
to breath into a paper bag.<br/>
