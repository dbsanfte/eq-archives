<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079187087">hmmmmmm. Sounds like great stuff. But i have<br/>
another question, do fighting techniques differ for<br/>
different occupations? I was thinking about being a Rogue<br/>
cause they sound cool- but if i fight w/ &#39;em would i<br/>
get to sneak up behind my enemies and like slit their<br/>
throats? Or would i just be faster at like hand to hand<br/>
combat? or both? I was thinking it&#39;d be something like<br/>
Tenchu (assuming you&#39;ve heard of that game). Also, is<br/>
there jumping in it? I&#39;d imagine not, as there isnt in<br/>
many RPGs.</div>
