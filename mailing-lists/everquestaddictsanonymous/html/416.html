<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064868693">EverQuest has decided to delay me. It is still saying I&#39;m not <br/>
subscribed, and that I have to wait until next month. That&#39;s a long <br/>
time to go without playing! I bet my EQ wife is worried sick about <br/>
me. There is also another website I posted in the links section. Go <br/>
check it out.<br/>
