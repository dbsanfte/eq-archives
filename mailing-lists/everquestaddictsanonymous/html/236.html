<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-555520263">hmmmm. This info. helped a lot. So far the game<br/>
sounds rather innovative and very intriguing. I read the<br/>
particulars on the different races and some on the<br/>
occupations too. I have another question and a request. Could<br/>
you briefly describe the events that occur when you<br/>
sit down and play this game online? Like, do you<br/>
start out in some building in a town? Or where you last<br/>
saved? And when you see other people online is it like<br/>
you can just happen to see them in a fighting in a<br/>
field or town or do you enter a game that someone has<br/>
already made? Also, how detailed is the character editor?<br/>
Thanks.</div>
