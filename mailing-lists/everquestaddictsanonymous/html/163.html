<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995538802">I admit it - I am addicted....that wasnt so<br/>
hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I have a question. I have been thinking of making<br/>
an Ogre Shaman. I think that would be a fun<br/>
character to play. Anyhow my question is do you think that<br/>
I should put all 30 points into wisdom or should I<br/>
put some into agility as well?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Any thoughts<br/>
would be welcome. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thanks,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Venture<br/>
