<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888343407">Well I been busy since last post. For those of<br/>
you who don&#39;t know me, (that&#39;s everyone) I am on<br/>
Saryrn server. I have 2 characters I play. First is<br/>
Fepony lvl 52 woodelf druid, and Leggo lvl 51 ogre<br/>
warrior. I am member of Ancient Council guild. I got this<br/>
game from my daughter on March 26 2001. I am not<br/>
twinked or PL&#39;ed. If there is anything I can do to help<br/>
any of you just let me know.....I&#39;ll try. I do know a<br/>
few tricks that can really help with abilities and<br/>
skills. Leggo is pretty much maxed out in all skills and<br/>
abilities. Druids are different....I am solo druid so far. I<br/>
am considering trying to get to 60 solo. Yeah<br/>
right!!! :) Anyone else on Saryrn holler me<br/>
