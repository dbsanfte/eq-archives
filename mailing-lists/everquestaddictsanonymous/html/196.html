<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-365087786">You probably shouldn&#39;t pick an Iksar just as much<br/>
as you shouldn&#39;t pick Troll, if not more. Iksar is<br/>
hated by more NPCs than Troll is, and Iksar hunting<br/>
grounds arent very good either. But its your choice,<br/>
although i highly recommend you go with a non-evil race<br/>
(i.e. NOT Dark Elf, Ogre, Troll or Iksar) and a<br/>
non-evil class (i.e. NOT Shadow Knight, Necromancer). If<br/>
you go with a good race/class combo it&#39;ll be much<br/>
much better, and i truly mean that. However.. if you<br/>
REALLY want to play Iksar, i&#39;d go with Necromancer or<br/>
Monk.</div>
