<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612974670">Go peddle your trash somewhere else. People like<br/>
you are what destroy the game for others. The game is<br/>
for fun, and not the profit of others. It&#39;s hard<br/>
enough to get camps you want as it is without trash like<br/>
you taking up my valuable breathing room. I&#39;ve<br/>
reported your email acct to Verant. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be<br/>
interested to know that you think you&#39;re such a uber master<br/>
hacker.</div>
