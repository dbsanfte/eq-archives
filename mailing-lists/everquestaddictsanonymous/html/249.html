<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-865224296">HI I just started playing two weeks ago. My one<br/>
and only character is Atuari 11th level wizard on the<br/>
Erollisi Marr server. The longest I&#39;ve played at one<br/>
sitting is probably only about 8 hours. I don&#39;t play<br/>
straight for very long because I get really tired in RL<br/>
and end up dying b/c I can&#39;t concentrate :)<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I am very addicted I have EQ on the brain 24/7. I<br/>
am supposed to be writing my dissertation but<br/>
instead I come to work and look up loads of information<br/>
on EQ sites. i.e. like right now lol. I have<br/>
compiled three organized binders full of information and<br/>
an additional one with alphebetized maps of norrath.<br/>
(Uhhh I might be addicted or just anal)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today I<br/>
couldn&#39;t sleep b/c I was thinking about EQ so I got up at<br/>
5 in the morning to play for two hours before work.<br/>
I will probably leave work early so I can go and<br/>
play. I stopped eating, stopped watching tv, slacked<br/>
off on working out and other things I thought used to<br/>
be important! Now that I have EQ it seems like those<br/>
others things can wait or aren&#39;t really that important<br/>
:-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope to run into some of you in Norrath. Atuari is<br/>
currently hunting in Q. Hills and BB sometimes W. Karana I<br/>
usually play in the morning 5am - 9:30 EST or 3:00pm<br/>
-8:00pm EST during the week and it can really vary during<br/>
the weekends.</div>
