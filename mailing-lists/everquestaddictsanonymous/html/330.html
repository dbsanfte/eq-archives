<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565999924">I agreee totally... 20&#39;s suck... somehow I got<br/>
through them with my main (53 bard) but that was a long<br/>
time ago back in lake of ill omen. With my cleric shes<br/>
21, she cant keep 21 I have died so many times in<br/>
these new fandangled Stonebrunt Mountains... nuts to<br/>
that! but you will make it through... Lake of Ill Omen<br/>
is great... stick with it you&#39;ll be 30 in no<br/>
time...&lt;br&gt;good luck&lt;br&gt;~Mokas~&lt;br&gt;53 bardess&lt;br&gt;Ayonae Ro</div>
