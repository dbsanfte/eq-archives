<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288755315">Hail all-- i just created my 4th char. Actually,<br/>
since I started playing last December, I&#39;ve also had 3<br/>
others that I&#39;ve since deleted. The new one is an Iksar<br/>
Necro, now that I have the Kunark upgrade. I&#39;ve not been<br/>
to Kunark yet, and the graphics (at least in Cabalis<br/>
and LOIO) are great!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So--- how addicted are<br/>
you? &lt;br&gt;How many chars on how many servers? &lt;br&gt;How<br/>
long have you been playing?&lt;br&gt;What&#39;s the longest time<br/>
you&#39;ve played continuously?&lt;br&gt;Have you ever ditched<br/>
work/school to play?&lt;br&gt;Have you ever made an excuse to<br/>
family/friends/spouse/girl/boyfriend to get out of doing something with them, only to<br/>
play?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m not too bad right now -- though I do play most<br/>
nights and at least one day on the weekend. Some nights<br/>
only an hour, some (like last night in a great group<br/>
in Unrest) will last for 5 hours. The worst i&#39;ve<br/>
done is to go home from work during lunch to check to<br/>
see if Dylln Starshine was in HighPass Hold -- hehe,<br/>
he wasn&#39;t or I may not have made it back to<br/>
work!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me know, I&#39;m curious -- you can start replies<br/>
with &quot;HI!! I&#39;m __(Xela Orcbane, or examble)__, and I&#39;m<br/>
and EQ-addict&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;:laughes<br/>
hysterically&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;p.s.-- got a new yahoo profile just for EQ-- sound<br/>
addicted??</div>
