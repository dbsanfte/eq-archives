<div id="ygrps-yiv-588010521">Are you talking about our beloved mother&#39;s avatar<br/>
appearing in LFay (before she was set upon by the evil<br/>
avatar of Cazic Thule??). If not, i&#39;d love to hear about<br/>
an actual spiritual event happening in Gfay.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(/ooc you&#39;d think that she would only spend 5 seconds<br/>
in GFay and shed tears of sorrow over the many many<br/>
noobs and auctioning fools ruining the fair glens of<br/>
her people) hahaha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of<br/>
the 31st season (and 500th death, most recently to<br/>
the OT goons)&lt;br&gt;In the service of the Great<br/>
Mother&lt;br&gt;2nd in command of the Defenders of Mithril<br/>
