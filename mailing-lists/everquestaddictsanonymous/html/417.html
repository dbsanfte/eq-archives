<div id="ygrps-yiv-858843925">Hello all you fellow addicts. Well I got my ogre warrior to 53. My <br/>
druid (retired) is still at 52, but my Iksar monk is now 36. His <br/>
(monk) Dual Wield is now maxed at (252). His highest kick so far is <br/>
83 dmg. I got some new weapons for my warrior. He now has Blood Point <br/>
in primary and Frostbringer in offhand. He still carries his Lammy <br/>
and Goranga Spiked Club, but the combo of BP and FB is an AWESOME <br/>
combo. The monk now has Goranga Spiked club in primary and Fist of <br/>
Rock in offhand. Hoping to find good 2hb for my monk and start my <br/>
training in that soon. All in all things are moving along well. I <br/>
hope to see you all soon....I am on Saryrn Server.<br/>
