<b>Subject:</b> Iksar of Fennin Ro <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054237571">I am an Iksar Shadow Knight on the server Fennin<br/>
Ro which is THE best roleplaying server in<br/>
EverQuest. I recently died about a week ago and if you have<br/>
any hand me down items like weapons or especially<br/>
armor I would really appreciate it since my corpse<br/>
decayed with all my stuff on it. For example a full suit<br/>
of banded armor and a very nice 2h slash weapon that<br/>
i had. Many thanks for your help and I am also<br/>
looking for people to group with for a raid on Kurns<br/>
Tower to clear out all the top floors and to go to the<br/>
basement. And talk to me if you would like to join the<br/>
Iksar only guild &quot; Gresh&#39;Maj &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many thanks and<br/>
you can send me a message on these two<br/>
names,&lt;br&gt;Selrack and Selrac</div>
