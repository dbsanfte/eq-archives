<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609848244">Many new people are like that. And when I tell<br/>
them this they say &quot;okay...&quot; but still dont beleive<br/>
me. the game gets way better in time. yessss yes as a<br/>
NEWBIE you go around killing stuff. When you reach<br/>
higher levels, you join a guild, group up with people<br/>
and raid dungeons. Yes there is TONS, sh**load of<br/>
thinking and even MORE things to find.. trust me</div>
