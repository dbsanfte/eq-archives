<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103655861">Here&#39;s my advice -- if you have a life, stay away<br/>
from this game!!! haha There are SO many details and<br/>
nuances in this game that we could never give you the<br/>
whole story. I&#39;ve been playing only since December, but<br/>
I just got one of my characters up to lvl 20, and<br/>
i&#39;m STILL learning some of the nuances. There is no<br/>
&quot;demo&quot;-- though the game comes with a tutoriat-- kind of<br/>
like a &quot;walk-through&quot; which is only the tip of the<br/>
iceberg. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing about this game is in the<br/>
name-- EVERquest. There are quests, adventures, skills,<br/>
journeys and fun that theoretically can keep you playing<br/>
the game forever. Especically since they plan to keep<br/>
upgrading and adding expansions, new races and new classes.<br/>
You can play by yourself, running quests, talking to<br/>
NPCs and fighting various creatures-- OR you can group<br/>
up with others to share experience, take on larger<br/>
and more dangerous foes and quests, trade or buy/sell<br/>
items, or just simply drink character brewed ale and<br/>
swap stories. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine this -- you start off<br/>
your life as an adventurer in a town that reflects<br/>
your face (or in some cases, race and class). Several<br/>
merchants and your guildmaster will help you get started.<br/>
You are given your guild tunic or robe and a starter<br/>
weapon (and/or a couple of low level spell scrolls to<br/>
memorize) and you leave the city walls to a wide zone of<br/>
wild adventure. No one tells you what you must do or<br/>
where you must go. You can choose to pursue one path or<br/>
another- gain the favor of one or many factions in the<br/>
wide world of Norrath (which may lower your status in<br/>
the eyes of other factions). Hark!! A large rat<br/>
sullies the road to your fair city&#39;s entrance-- DIE low<br/>
beast!! What&#39;s this, a rat ear can be cut from the<br/>
lifeless corpse? Perhaps a merchant will have a use for<br/>
this item, and part with some copper or silver for it.<br/>
Hah!! A spiderling approaches -- you have heard<br/>
seasoned adventurers at the gate offering to buy the<br/>
semi-precious silk from the beast!! DIE eight legged horror!!<br/>
ACK!! Now there are 2... no 3??!!! You must flee back<br/>
to the city, where the guards will protect you<br/>
(perhaps, if you have remained in their good graces). As<br/>
the seasons go on, you will not need to flee from the<br/>
Orc Centurions, Skeletons, Pixie Tricksters, Pumas,<br/>
Kobold Scouts, and other evils of the wild. You will be<br/>
rewarded for your adventures with precious gold and<br/>
platinum, magically imbued armor, items and weapons. You<br/>
will remain well fed, and and happy, though the Quest<br/>
will always call to you-- as will the many far lands<br/>
of mystery wich lay beyond the next zones. Travel<br/>
there on foot, by boat, or perhaps you will be<br/>
magically transported by a fellow adventurer-- a seasoned<br/>
Wizard or wise Druid. There is always adventures to be<br/>
had, heroes to join up with, and tales to tell. If<br/>
your bravery and skill become renowned, perhaps you<br/>
will be invited into one of the many Norrathian<br/>
guilds-- whereby you can adventure with like minded and<br/>
skilled heroes in a tight circle of friendship. Much lies<br/>
ahead of you young one-- and the paths are yours to<br/>
take.</div>
