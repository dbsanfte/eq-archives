<div id="ygrps-yiv-853941925">I realize this is a techincal question and<br/>
mayhaps no one really knows the answer to it, but I feel<br/>
I have to post it because, maybe you are suffering<br/>
from the same thing. Anywho, it seems that when ever i<br/>
zone/die/log or anything else that might result in a dramatic<br/>
change of scenery my computer locks up, in order to do<br/>
anything I have to reboot my comouter, and sign back on to<br/>
EQ, (this is especially annoying when i die and am<br/>
forced to zone 4 or 5 times...i don&#39;t dare get on a<br/>
boat). I have called EQ&#39;s tech support, and they really<br/>
didn&#39;t have an answer, they just kinda hemmed and hawed<br/>
and suggested it&#39;s my video card or what not, I don&#39;t<br/>
think thats the case, my video card is compatable and<br/>
this didn&#39;t happen until the second most recent patch<br/>
(not the 11 hour one, the one before that). If anyone<br/>
has any info that might help it would be greatly<br/>
appreciated and thanks for letting me vent a lil&#39;<br/>
bit.&lt;br&gt;-Hailrazer</div>
