<b>Subject:</b> Windows XP works with EQ!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-33949954">I am a very new EQ gamer. I have been playing for<br/>
a few weeks now. I use Windows XP just fine with no<br/>
bugs to report. I installed EQ and the two upgrades<br/>
with no problem. My first time on I had to wait about<br/>
10 minutes while the paches were downloaded to my<br/>
computer, but I have been go since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can&#39;t explain<br/>
why you have problems, but I can be emailed if you<br/>
think you need help. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gilcintron@...">gilcintron@...</a></div>
