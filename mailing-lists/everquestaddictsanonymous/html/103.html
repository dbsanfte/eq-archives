<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441991118">Every EverQuest cd has its own Key. They do this<br/>
to keep people from doing exactly that, buying a<br/>
game from a friend instead of a friend. Unless you<br/>
have that persons user name and password, you&#39;ll have<br/>
to buy a whole new EQ game. Sorry =(</div>
