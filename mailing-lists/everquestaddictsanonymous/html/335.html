<div id="ygrps-yiv-80503064">I post a lot because (a) I have to work and (b)<br/>
they&#39;re silly enough to give me a computer at<br/>
work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does anyone roll play? I don&#39;t do as much with my<br/>
main-- i&#39;ve found that at higher levels, people get too<br/>
serious for roll playing--it&#39;s all raid/camp strategy<br/>
with some goofiness thrown in for good measure.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a lvl 9 DE chanter, who made it to Gfay. I<br/>
laugh and laugh as the guards ignore my wood elf<br/>
illusion. I even cast Alliance on the merchants and &quot;steal&quot;<br/>
their money by getting great prices for my rusty junk.<br/>
I rarely help anyone in need, unless it is to my<br/>
own benefit, and I&#39;ll often slip out of illusion and<br/>
scare weaking, love filled wood elves. The cannot<br/>
understand the power of Hate, and the strength of the<br/>
Tier&#39;Dal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Often I&#39;ll here shouts of &quot;ACK!! there&#39;s<br/>
an inkie by the bank!!!&quot; Foolish tree-huggers!!<br/>
Though I have killed many orcs (they are just stupid<br/>
pawns, that will one day be nothing more that our pets),<br/>
my favorite past-time is taking down the helpless<br/>
slaves in Crushbone. How sad-- I approach them as a wood<br/>
elf and hold the key to their salvation in front of<br/>
their faces--then I revert to my natural, beautifully<br/>
evil form and let them gaze upon their doom befor<br/>
dispatching them quickly. My people back in Neriak will<br/>
forgive my indiscretions with our Orc &quot;allys&quot; after a few<br/>
more of my games with the helpless chain gang.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is good in the Faydark. I wish that our forces<br/>
would move quicker into this area, but such is<br/>
politics. Mayong Mistmore is too caught up in his studies<br/>
of the undead (sigh-- necromancy is NOT the only<br/>
magic!!!), and to be honest, I think he&#39;s too afraid of<br/>
brownies to venture any farther than his pathetic little<br/>
castle. And don&#39;t get me started on that D&#39;Vinn. He<br/>
kisses so much orc butt, that his nose is blue!! uh...<br/>
blue-ER!! With him as the envoy in CB, my people will never<br/>
know the pleasures i&#39;ve enjoyed over the past weeks.<br/>
Admittedly, I have not trained enough in my magics to wreak<br/>
havok in that snooty city of Felwithe, but those<br/>
&quot;high&quot;elves have began to stew my hate and stoke my rage.<br/>
Still I must laugh. Even the self-described &quot;high ones&quot;<br/>
offer my the best prices and go so far as to offer me<br/>
training in their magic guilds!! Idiots!! When I obtain a<br/>
high enough rank, they will even train me on how to<br/>
take on the form of their own!!!! Fools!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So<br/>
if you see an odd looking wood elf with an animated<br/>
pet running through the Faydark and laughing<br/>
maniacally, best to step aside and let me pass!!<br/>
