<div id="ygrps-yiv-147914879">I would suggest a cleric, best healing ability in<br/>
the game, the only down part is you have to med a<br/>
lot.. :) I say Druids are good too, awww hell, here is<br/>
the truth all classes are good.They all have a unique<br/>
ability just like people in RL. It all depends on what<br/>
you would be interested in. Personally i am a cleric<br/>
on Druzzil Ro, i love being a cleric b/c you get to<br/>
save lives via healing, as well as ressurecting when<br/>
you are older. Being a caster rocks! Look into all<br/>
the classes and read about them @ www.eqlizer.com<br/>
they have great info. See what would fit you better.<br/>
:) If you need anything else send me an e-mail to<br/>
