<div id="ygrps-yiv-257379355">OK, ok-- i get the Pink Floyd thing going on<br/>
there-- that&#39;s cool-- but I&#39;m lost on the whole Buddy<br/>
thing. Enquiring minds want to know!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since you<br/>
read ALL the posts (good reading, eh?), you probably<br/>
already know that I play on the Xev server-- My main used<br/>
to be my gnome mage, but I&#39;ve found myself drawn to<br/>
the life of a wood elf druid, and he is now my avatar<br/>
on norrath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please feel free to admit the<br/>
extent of your addiction here. I have been so busy at<br/>
work, that i&#39;ve actually not played for a few days. (I<br/>
KNOW!!! can you believe that????). But my guild is<br/>
hosting a lower level raid in the Warrens tonight, and<br/>
i&#39;ll be supervising-- so that should be fun!!<br/>
