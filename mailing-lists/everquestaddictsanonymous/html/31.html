<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-813328676">The battle for all that is good,rightious and<br/>
blessed by Tunare continues unabaited in the Estate of<br/>
Unrest. I have found some most excelent groups to fight<br/>
with this weekend,made level 23 saturday night. I have<br/>
discovered the pleasures of grouping with an Enchanter,that<br/>
was very knowledgeable.She helped the group take on<br/>
and kill many creatures that normaly have us running<br/>
for our lives to the nearest zone. I am here now only<br/>
because of the patch problems they&#39;v been having of late.<br/>
I have uploaded a couple of my favorite screen<br/>
shots to my Yahoo Photo site if any of you want to<br/>
check them out at<br/>
