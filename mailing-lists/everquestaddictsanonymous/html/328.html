<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515848596">IF you can get there, my guildies and I have been<br/>
having GREAT fun in Runnyeye. There are plenty of higher<br/>
level mobs in there, plus there&#39;s a nice xp bonus.<br/>
There&#39;ve been LOTS of changes made to Runnyeye and it&#39;s<br/>
certainly MUCH more interesting now. BTW... the groups<br/>
we&#39;ve been running have been from 17 to 26... and we<br/>
haven&#39;t gone all the way in. I&#39;d imagine there&#39;s even<br/>
MORE stuff the further down you go. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s<br/>
some pretty phat loot down there too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uaria<br/>
