<div id="ygrps-yiv-400022647">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I recently joined a new guild called Creative Chaos.  We are on the <br/>
Quellious server.  We are a loyal guild, our goal is to have a family <br/>
like environment.  We are here to help our members in anyway <br/>
possible, to hold events and raids.  I have made a webpage for the <br/>
guild at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://talmaril.150m.com">http://talmaril.150m.com</a>  so go check us out.  And if you <br/>
are interested in joing please send me and email at <br/>
