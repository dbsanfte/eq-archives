<b>Subject:</b> New to EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657817098">I am new, and have bought the EQ but would like<br/>
some advice. I wish to create a Half Elf character,<br/>
either (or) a Druid, Paladin or Ranger. Eventually, I<br/>
would like all 3. But I have to solo awhile till I can<br/>
get a definite time I will be on, because of some<br/>
changes in my RL. What city would be best for each to<br/>
start in? Is there a place in the internet that<br/>
describes the diff servers as well?</div>
