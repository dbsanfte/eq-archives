<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909839074">Hi I&#39;m a 20 wood elf bard (Mokas Stardust) on<br/>
Solusek Ro... my brother is a 32 high elf paladin (Dive<br/>
Sufferhead)... today was so bad because we couldn&#39;t get logged<br/>
on (due to patch or whatever) and it was truly a sad<br/>
sight as we were both DEVASTATED.. that&#39;s when I<br/>
started thinking &quot;god we are WAY too obsessed!&quot; but, you<br/>
know... I gotta level dammit!!!&lt;br&gt;hehe anyway so I still<br/>
can&#39;t get on so I decided to go joining this club<br/>
instead of playing EQ.. hopefully soon I will get to go<br/>
back on... hehe...&lt;br&gt;anyway how do you do? this is my<br/>
introduction...&quot;allow me to introduce... myself&quot;&lt;br&gt;~Mokas</div>
