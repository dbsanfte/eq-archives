<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063935784">I have to say both yes and no to that one. My<br/>
main play server is Brell, where my highest Chars are<br/>
46, 29, 28, 26 (and a few lower ones). I also play on<br/>
The Seventh Hammer, my highest char being level 29.<br/>
Veeshan - level 12. And last but not least, I play on one<br/>
of the PvP-team servers. I have to say that all in<br/>
all the [older] players on the PvP-team server are<br/>
far more mature than the non-PvP(team) servers. The<br/>
Seventh Hammer has alot of younger players since it&#39;s a<br/>
newer server (than Brell) but the attitude of the<br/>
players is generally the same. You have your jerks, you<br/>
have the good people as well. The nicest server I&#39;ve<br/>
ever been to tho was the test server believe it or<br/>
not. The people there, that have been around since the<br/>
begining are mostly a nice group. Easy to talk to, and<br/>
pretty friendly. Anyway, that&#39;s just my two cents. If<br/>
anything, I&#39;ll always tell ya Brell Sucks, but in all<br/>
actuality I feel the same about it that I do about the<br/>
other servers. They suck equally LoL</div>
