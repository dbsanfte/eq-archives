<b>Subject:</b> Greetings Fellow Addicts! *grin* <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276858929">Wow -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did a small search for Everquest<br/>
on the off chance that I would find something... ha<br/>
ha ha. I actually came by yahoo clubs to reply to a<br/>
message board.&lt;br&gt;How amazing is this.... anyone who<br/>
frequents here have characters on the Prexus server? I have<br/>
3 of my own on Prexus, my home on EQ because my RL<br/>
friends who got me addicted *yay* started<br/>
there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ is my first RPG... it&#39;s the only thing I ever<br/>
play anymore. I waved bye bye to my PS a long time<br/>
ago... I know exactly what it is too. It&#39;s the live,<br/>
real time interaction with other people.&lt;br&gt;In regards<br/>
to the message about DAOC, I don&#39;t think I will even<br/>
try another RPG. EQ is my first love... I&#39;m not<br/>
really impressed with Luclin, so I didn&#39;t buy it yet. So<br/>
I am off to log on since I took care of my other<br/>
addiction while finding this board - downloading mp3s *LOL*<br/>
Take care&lt;br&gt;See ya in Norrath ~ maybe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~<br/>
Lelaina Soullfyre&lt;br&gt; Officer for Parthas<br/>
