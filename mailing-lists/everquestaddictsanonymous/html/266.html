<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930284447">I have no idea!! I keep saying &quot;Xev Rules!!!&quot; and<br/>
I&#39;m really not sure why. (hahaha) I picked Xev server<br/>
because it was relatively new when I started, and I had<br/>
heard the horrors of all the twinks on the older<br/>
servers (Higher level chars reached lvl 50, or lower, and<br/>
decided to start over with twinks). I also thought it<br/>
would be fun if most of the people I interacted with<br/>
were relatively new to the game. Well, turns out that<br/>
new people are joining on all the servers all the<br/>
time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There area thousands of people who play<br/>
on each server. I don&#39;t that there is one server<br/>
that is filled with &quot;jerks&quot; and another server that<br/>
has no &quot;jerks.&quot; I&#39;m not sure what would make one<br/>
server better than another. Here&#39;s why I&#39;ve sticked with<br/>
Xev-- 1. I&#39;ve met a lot of really good people here, 2.<br/>
The name sounds cool and I&#39;m still not totally sure<br/>
where it comes from, 3. I&#39;ve never been locked out of<br/>
this server. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe I&#39;m &quot;too young&quot; a player<br/>
still to know all the diferences though-- please<br/>
educate me if there are vast differences. Of course there<br/>
are PVP servers, and there may be some servers that<br/>
are more Role-Playing servers. Some servers SEEM to<br/>
have more GM events-- though I&#39;ve been involved in 2<br/>
fun ones on Xev, and I don&#39;t play 24/7. Other than<br/>
that-- who knows???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;xela</div>
