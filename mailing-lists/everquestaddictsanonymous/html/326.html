<div id="ygrps-yiv-86738781">I&#39;ve never had a Shammy, but if you play<br/>
conservative (with SOW), you should be able to get away from<br/>
trouble. My only suggestion would be to find good groups<br/>
and stick with them as long as you can. That&#39;s how I<br/>
got most of my xp with my druid. A great place at<br/>
that level is LOIO. Sarnak or even goblin cave groups<br/>
would be good. You may still have some luck with the<br/>
orcs in HHP, but they may be too low for you now.<br/>
Unrest is fast paced and good xp and loot, BUT be<br/>
prepared to die a lot EVEN though you have sow. Anyone<br/>
with SOW is very welcome in Unrest groups. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The<br/>
new zone, Stonebrunt would be good for you too, but<br/>
it&#39;s a long trip, and no good if you can&#39;t find a<br/>
group, though at that level I think you can hunt the<br/>
highe end mobs in Warrens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LOIO is best, a<br/>
little later you&#39;ll want to head to SK for Spires groups<br/>
(another fast xp and good loot spot), and then to the<br/>
Overthere around lvl 30. I went to OT at lvl 29 and got<br/>
through lvl 30 there. I still go back every now and<br/>
again. Good xp, horrible loot, can get boring but worth<br/>
it if you are in desperate need for xp. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good<br/>
Luck!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 35th Season&lt;br&gt;Defenders<br/>
