<div id="ygrps-yiv-481814780">suer i can. First you are in the right place till<br/>
you hit lvl 10, then you may want to get a port to<br/>
Commons and get a bind at Freeport so if you die you will<br/>
be close when you respawn. Then go to the Tunnel and<br/>
try to get in a Orc group till you are about lvl 13,<br/>
then go to NRO and get in Derv camps. That will keep<br/>
you busy for now. as for spells, you will find all of<br/>
the DD spells work well, and DOTS works good, Harmony<br/>
is important slo along with snare, NOT root. Root<br/>
just makes the mob hit harder. If you want to solo,<br/>
you can learn to kite. Let me know if you need help<br/>
learning to kite and I can help with that also. BTW what<br/>
server are you on in EQ? I am on the Tribunal. good luck<br/>
and Happy Hunting.</div>
