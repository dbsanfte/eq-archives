You&#39;ve come to the right place to ask<br/>\nquestions and finding out about it before you buy it is a<br/>\nwise decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally I think the game is<br/>\nwell worth it... after about 2 days of playing it<br/>\nafter I bought it I was addicted. EQ is the first game<br/>\nthats ever been addictive to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ, to me, is a<br/>\nplace to go to interact with people from all over the<br/>\nworld and immerse myself in a role totally different<br/>\nthan the real world. I play to get away from the<br/>\nreality, to kick back and relax and have tons of<br/>\nfun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the game you run around a vast world spanning 5<br/>\ncontinents (and soon to be a moon if my info on the new<br/>\nexpansion is correct) and hundreds of different zones in<br/>\nsearch of relics that can complete your inventory and<br/>\nwhile doing so you take down foes that appose you. All<br/>\nthe while your trying to become the best of your race<br/>\nand class and make your god proud by following what<br/>\ns/he stands for. Theres even some PvP servers that<br/>\nallow you to take on other player<br/>\ncharacters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Umm about the demo; I&#39;m not sure there is a demo out<br/>\nthere. If there is I&#39;ve never seen it. If theres anymore<br/>\nquestions you need answered feel free to post or send me an<br/>\nemail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:boggs87413_69@...\">boggs87413_69@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
