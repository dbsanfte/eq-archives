(But if you&#39;re<br/>\nnot convinced from our passion about the game, then<br/>\nmaybe we have to appeal to our explanation of how great<br/>\nthe game play is). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combat is only a part of<br/>\nthis game (though, i suppose, every character does a<br/>\nlot of it). Casters mostly focus on spells, but you<br/>\nhaven&#39;t shown much interest (yet) in those classes, so on<br/>\nto melee combat. Most combat is auto-combat. Click<br/>\nto attack a certain enemy and your char<br/>\nautomatically swings its weapon to try to hit. You can hit,<br/>\nmiss, avoid getting hit, etc. depending on your skill<br/>\nin the particular weapon type, your offense or<br/>\ndefense skill, and your char&#39;s dexterity/agility etc. You<br/>\nstill control moving around AND you can still choose<br/>\nand cast spells (if you are a class that has spells).<br/>\nYou can also control and use special abilities, such<br/>\nas backstab, kick, bash, slam (depending on what<br/>\nrace and class you are). At certain levels, certain<br/>\nclasses get automatic melee abilities, such as dual wield<br/>\n(you can use 2 weapons), dual attack, dodge, parry,<br/>\netc.-- at very high levels, there are even more<br/>\nabilities. MONKS get more special combat abilities, such as<br/>\neagle strike, roundhouse kick, feign death, flying<br/>\nkick, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some weapons have special abilities<br/>\nof their own, which will manifest during<br/>\ncombat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first, I though &quot;auto-combat&quot; was lame-- why<br/>\ncan&#39;t i just have a &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;slash&quot; button? But then i<br/>\nlearned that EQ is a social game, and it helps to have<br/>\nauto combat so I can yell to my party during battle.<br/>\nWhile bashing an Orc Oracle with my mace, I&#39;m hit with<br/>\na poison spell and can yell to my cleric parner<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m poisoned, help!!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He can disengage from<br/>\nmelee, and cure my poisoned state, heal me up if needed,<br/>\nand resume bashing. I have come to love the combat<br/>\nstyle. Look, i&#39;ve played a lot of games, as i&#39;m sure we<br/>\nall have. If you like combat, if you like adventurous<br/>\ngames with brains, if you like to socialize at all (and<br/>\neven if you don&#39;t-- EQ is still good), if you like to<br/>\nrole play, if you like to be constantly amazed by new<br/>\ncreatures, items, battles, spells, places, stories,<br/>\npeople.... you cannot pass up this game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you like<br/>\nN&#39;sync concerts, barbie dolls, smoking crack in a dark<br/>\nalley, playing canasta (sp) with your grandparents on a<br/>\nsaturday night, flying helecopters in Korea, changing<br/>\ndiapers at a day care for a living, dressing up like a<br/>\nwoman and performing a song review 3 nights a week, or<br/>\nreading the Wall Street Journal on the commuter train---<br/>\nthis game is STILL probably for you!!! (Except for the<br/>\nsomeone smoking crack in a dark alley, which who needs<br/>\ncrack when we have Evercrack, i&#39;ve met all of the above<br/>\npeople on line). All walks of life, all races, genders,<br/>\nclasses, lifestyles enjoy this game. Some people get into<br/>\ntrue roll play, some people spam the zones they&#39;re in<br/>\nwith &quot;WHAAZZZZUUUUUPPPPPP????&quot; The bottom line is that<br/>\nthe game rocks, AND with the new patches constantly<br/>\nworking at fixing (mostly) the game to make it better,<br/>\nand new expansions every year to increase the game&#39;s<br/>\nattraction (can you say Shadows of Luclin????!!!!), it is<br/>\nliterally a game you could play for Ever(quest).<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;20th Season<br/>\nDruid&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
