And I need one more peice of Deepwater<br/>\nArmor before its complete. *is proud*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyhow<br/>\nglugnus, if this is your very first time, my suggestion to<br/>\nyou is delete your Shadow Knight and start a new<br/>\nchar. Why? Because Shadow Knights are a very bad class<br/>\nfor new people, and Troll is a very bad race for new<br/>\npeople. Both get killed easily by monsters and NPCs.<br/>\nStart a character of a good race, religion and class<br/>\nand i guarantee the game will be 5 times funner for<br/>\nyou. Dont start a shadow knight until you&#39;ve had lots<br/>\nof experience, and want to commit enough time to<br/>\nlevel up your SK. SKs (shadow knights) level slowly. My<br/>\nadvice is pick an Elven race or Halfling. Halflings<br/>\nlevel quite fast, and they&#39;re hunting area is very nice<br/>\nfor a long time. Dont go into Human race, because<br/>\nthey are practically blind in the dark. You wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbeleive how many people always pick Human when they first<br/>\nbuy EQ. Dont do it. Unless perhaps you want to be a<br/>\nMonk and dont want to be evil (iksar)(only humans and<br/>\niksar can be monk, and iksars are hated by a lot of<br/>\nNPCs). So go with the Halfling or Elven race, if you<br/>\nwant the best out of the game. Classwise? Your own<br/>\nchoice. But I&#39;d stick away from Rogues if your new too.<br/>\nThey take some experience. classes like Mage, Necro<br/>\n(sometimes), cleric, druid, warrior (especially), monk are<br/>\ngood for newer people. The other classes take a bit<br/>\nmore experience. Be warned though if you pic a<br/>\nNecromancer many other races will hate you and probably<br/>\nattack you on site. You need to be careful, but if you<br/>\nlevel your necro up enough you&#39;ll be quite<br/>\npowerful.&lt;br&gt;Dark Elf is the only evil race a newbie should go with<br/>\n(even though you probably shouldn&#39;t) because they&#39;re<br/>\nhometown is in a good area, its pretty close to Freeport<br/>\n(human town) so theres lots of people in those areas.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope my advise has helped, and I know it sounds a<br/>\nlittle confusing. Go on sites like<br/>\nwww.everlore.com&lt;br&gt;and everquest.allakhazam.com for info, and other<br/>\nnewbie help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seres Holyblade - Now Level 56<br/>\nKnight of Karana Server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
