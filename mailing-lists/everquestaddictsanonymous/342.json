First you are in the right place till<br/>\nyou hit lvl 10, then you may want to get a port to<br/>\nCommons and get a bind at Freeport so if you die you will<br/>\nbe close when you respawn. Then go to the Tunnel and<br/>\ntry to get in a Orc group till you are about lvl 13,<br/>\nthen go to NRO and get in Derv camps. That will keep<br/>\nyou busy for now. as for spells, you will find all of<br/>\nthe DD spells work well, and DOTS works good, Harmony<br/>\nis important slo along with snare, NOT root. Root<br/>\njust makes the mob hit harder. If you want to solo,<br/>\nyou can learn to kite. Let me know if you need help<br/>\nlearning to kite and I can help with that also. BTW what<br/>\nserver are you on in EQ? I am on the Tribunal. good luck<br/>\nand Happy Hunting.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
