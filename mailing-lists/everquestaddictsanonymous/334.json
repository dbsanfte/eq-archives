Best way--get a port to BB and take the<br/>\nshuttles to Kunark. Worst Way--get a port to Dreadlands,<br/>\nand try to run across to FV. Not safe, I do it at lvl<br/>\n35 and still get scared. (but what do i know, i&#39;m a<br/>\nwimpy tree-hugging druid). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SK is where you&#39;ll<br/>\nwant to be soon. XP AND loot are great at the spires.<br/>\nLOIO is great xp, but the loot is not very good<br/>\n(except a few of the SHM only items that drop off<br/>\nsarnys). You can fill up on FS and SP gear (gloves are<br/>\nbest, sell for at least 20pp each on Xev).<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW-- I LOVED the 20s, they went by too fast and now<br/>\ni&#39;m stuck in 30s--:9&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh-- I got to lvl 20<br/>\nfighting Orcs in HHP-- hence the surname Orcbane.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 35th Circle&lt;br&gt;Defenders<br/>\nof Mithril Hall&lt;br&gt;Xev&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I am now of the 35th<br/>\nseason, and have attained the rank of Tunare&#39;s shoe<br/>\nsniffer-- WOOT!!!&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
