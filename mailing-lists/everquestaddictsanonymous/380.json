I actually came by yahoo clubs to reply to a<br/>\nmessage board.&lt;br&gt;How amazing is this.... anyone who<br/>\nfrequents here have characters on the Prexus server? I have<br/>\n3 of my own on Prexus, my home on EQ because my RL<br/>\nfriends who got me addicted *yay* started<br/>\nthere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ is my first RPG... it&#39;s the only thing I ever<br/>\nplay anymore. I waved bye bye to my PS a long time<br/>\nago... I know exactly what it is too. It&#39;s the live,<br/>\nreal time interaction with other people.&lt;br&gt;In regards<br/>\nto the message about DAOC, I don&#39;t think I will even<br/>\ntry another RPG. EQ is my first love... I&#39;m not<br/>\nreally impressed with Luclin, so I didn&#39;t buy it yet. So<br/>\nI am off to log on since I took care of my other<br/>\naddiction while finding this board - downloading mp3s *LOL*<br/>\nTake care&lt;br&gt;See ya in Norrath ~ maybe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~<br/>\nLelaina Soullfyre&lt;br&gt; Officer for Parthas<br/>\nAvengers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS: l luv you, Blue!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
