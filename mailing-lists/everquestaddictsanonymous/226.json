I joke about<br/>\nXev, because i RARELY see anyone on a board from Xev<br/>\nposting anything. Here&#39;s an &quot;addicts&quot; question, how many<br/>\ncharacters do you have, on how many servers????&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As<br/>\nfor hunting options -- what class/race are you and on<br/>\nwhat continent?? Grouping is ALWAYS good after level<br/>\n5. Try to get into full groups in CB, or in<br/>\nSteamfont by the mino caves, or in BB at any one of the<br/>\nmany camps. Full groups give a 20% XP bonus!!! It<br/>\nmakes the game, USUALLY, more fun to play, also.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone got some 411 on OOT and Kunark?? I have never<br/>\nbeen to either, and am wanting to<br/>\nadventure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 17th season</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
