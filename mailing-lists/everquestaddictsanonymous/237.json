I&#39;ve been playing only since December, but<br/>\nI just got one of my characters up to lvl 20, and<br/>\ni&#39;m STILL learning some of the nuances. There is no<br/>\n&quot;demo&quot;-- though the game comes with a tutoriat-- kind of<br/>\nlike a &quot;walk-through&quot; which is only the tip of the<br/>\niceberg. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing about this game is in the<br/>\nname-- EVERquest. There are quests, adventures, skills,<br/>\njourneys and fun that theoretically can keep you playing<br/>\nthe game forever. Especically since they plan to keep<br/>\nupgrading and adding expansions, new races and new classes.<br/>\nYou can play by yourself, running quests, talking to<br/>\nNPCs and fighting various creatures-- OR you can group<br/>\nup with others to share experience, take on larger<br/>\nand more dangerous foes and quests, trade or buy/sell<br/>\nitems, or just simply drink character brewed ale and<br/>\nswap stories. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine this -- you start off<br/>\nyour life as an adventurer in a town that reflects<br/>\nyour face (or in some cases, race and class). Several<br/>\nmerchants and your guildmaster will help you get started.<br/>\nYou are given your guild tunic or robe and a starter<br/>\nweapon (and/or a couple of low level spell scrolls to<br/>\nmemorize) and you leave the city walls to a wide zone of<br/>\nwild adventure. No one tells you what you must do or<br/>\nwhere you must go. You can choose to pursue one path or<br/>\nanother- gain the favor of one or many factions in the<br/>\nwide world of Norrath (which may lower your status in<br/>\nthe eyes of other factions). Hark!! A large rat<br/>\nsullies the road to your fair city&#39;s entrance-- DIE low<br/>\nbeast!! What&#39;s this, a rat ear can be cut from the<br/>\nlifeless corpse? Perhaps a merchant will have a use for<br/>\nthis item, and part with some copper or silver for it.<br/>\nHah!! A spiderling approaches -- you have heard<br/>\nseasoned adventurers at the gate offering to buy the<br/>\nsemi-precious silk from the beast!! DIE eight legged horror!!<br/>\nACK!! Now there are 2... no 3??!!! You must flee back<br/>\nto the city, where the guards will protect you<br/>\n(perhaps, if you have remained in their good graces). As<br/>\nthe seasons go on, you will not need to flee from the<br/>\nOrc Centurions, Skeletons, Pixie Tricksters, Pumas,<br/>\nKobold Scouts, and other evils of the wild. You will be<br/>\nrewarded for your adventures with precious gold and<br/>\nplatinum, magically imbued armor, items and weapons. You<br/>\nwill remain well fed, and and happy, though the Quest<br/>\nwill always call to you-- as will the many far lands<br/>\nof mystery wich lay beyond the next zones. Travel<br/>\nthere on foot, by boat, or perhaps you will be<br/>\nmagically transported by a fellow adventurer-- a seasoned<br/>\nWizard or wise Druid. There is always adventures to be<br/>\nhad, heroes to join up with, and tales to tell. If<br/>\nyour bravery and skill become renowned, perhaps you<br/>\nwill be invited into one of the many Norrathian<br/>\nguilds-- whereby you can adventure with like minded and<br/>\nskilled heroes in a tight circle of friendship. Much lies<br/>\nahead of you young one-- and the paths are yours to<br/>\ntake.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
