My only suggestion would be to find good groups<br/>\nand stick with them as long as you can. That&#39;s how I<br/>\ngot most of my xp with my druid. A great place at<br/>\nthat level is LOIO. Sarnak or even goblin cave groups<br/>\nwould be good. You may still have some luck with the<br/>\norcs in HHP, but they may be too low for you now.<br/>\nUnrest is fast paced and good xp and loot, BUT be<br/>\nprepared to die a lot EVEN though you have sow. Anyone<br/>\nwith SOW is very welcome in Unrest groups. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The<br/>\nnew zone, Stonebrunt would be good for you too, but<br/>\nit&#39;s a long trip, and no good if you can&#39;t find a<br/>\ngroup, though at that level I think you can hunt the<br/>\nhighe end mobs in Warrens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LOIO is best, a<br/>\nlittle later you&#39;ll want to head to SK for Spires groups<br/>\n(another fast xp and good loot spot), and then to the<br/>\nOverthere around lvl 30. I went to OT at lvl 29 and got<br/>\nthrough lvl 30 there. I still go back every now and<br/>\nagain. Good xp, horrible loot, can get boring but worth<br/>\nit if you are in desperate need for xp. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good<br/>\nLuck!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 35th Season&lt;br&gt;Defenders<br/>\nof Mithril Hall&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
