I dont know<br/>\nwhat levels you are but you cant be too high... people<br/>\nwho are around level 25 or over know cheating is the<br/>\nlamest, most wussy thing you could ever do on an ONLINE<br/>\nGAME. I do not like starting fights in someone elses<br/>\nforums but COME ON its an online game and your trying to<br/>\ncheat... Wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if you are someone who<br/>\ncant stand going through life on EQ wearing a suit of<br/>\nLeather and Banded armor using your rusty sword. People<br/>\nmust really suck if they need to cheat. Heck, I have<br/>\ntrudged through 54 levels, and without cheating I am a<br/>\nlevel 54 Cavalier (Cavalier = Paladin who has passed<br/>\nlevel 50) and I have never gone as low to try and<br/>\nCHEAT/HACK the game to get &#39;phat l3wtz&#39;. Cheating is for the<br/>\npure newbie. Plus if Verant catches you exploiting<br/>\nbugs or hacking account gets automatically banned.<br/>\nCheating is a huge thing to them. Be like the rest of us,<br/>\nto be proud to fight for your earnings and not just<br/>\nwalk through the whole game by exploiting bugs and<br/>\ngetting &#39;phat l3wtz&#39;. Its not like I NEVER complain about<br/>\ncamping rare spawns for my Deepwater armor and stuff like<br/>\nthat but cheating is going just too low. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just<br/>\nmy two copper...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sereth (Seffar)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
