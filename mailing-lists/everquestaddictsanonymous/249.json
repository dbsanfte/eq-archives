My one<br/>\nand only character is Atuari 11th level wizard on the<br/>\nErollisi Marr server. The longest I&#39;ve played at one<br/>\nsitting is probably only about 8 hours. I don&#39;t play<br/>\nstraight for very long because I get really tired in RL<br/>\nand end up dying b/c I can&#39;t concentrate :)<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I am very addicted I have EQ on the brain 24/7. I<br/>\nam supposed to be writing my dissertation but<br/>\ninstead I come to work and look up loads of information<br/>\non EQ sites. i.e. like right now lol. I have<br/>\ncompiled three organized binders full of information and<br/>\nan additional one with alphebetized maps of norrath.<br/>\n(Uhhh I might be addicted or just anal)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t sleep b/c I was thinking about EQ so I got up at<br/>\n5 in the morning to play for two hours before work.<br/>\nI will probably leave work early so I can go and<br/>\nplay. I stopped eating, stopped watching tv, slacked<br/>\noff on working out and other things I thought used to<br/>\nbe important! Now that I have EQ it seems like those<br/>\nothers things can wait or aren&#39;t really that important<br/>\n:-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope to run into some of you in Norrath. Atuari is<br/>\ncurrently hunting in Q. Hills and BB sometimes W. Karana I<br/>\nusually play in the morning 5am - 9:30 EST or 3:00pm<br/>\n-8:00pm EST during the week and it can really vary during<br/>\nthe weekends.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
