I chose a newer server (Xev)<br/>\nand a gnome mage. There were never that many people<br/>\nin my zone (Steamfont), i couldn&#39;t summon a pet yet,<br/>\nand a found myself running madly from spiderlings all<br/>\nthe time. The only good thing about being a gnome is<br/>\nthat there are TONS of low level quests in Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>\nThis made it bearable. (My wood elf druid char. gets<br/>\nonly one lame quest, but you can do a couple of the<br/>\nother class quests that are ok). Plus, there&#39;s not<br/>\nreally any point in grouping at newbie levels. BUT, when<br/>\nI got to about lvl 5, things changed and I headed<br/>\noff to GFay - to orc hill, CB, and off to BB for some<br/>\nnew views. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every level gets better and<br/>\nbetter, and there are more quests, items, spells, and<br/>\ntrade skill abilities as you keep going. I was in a<br/>\ngreat CB throne room group that took down Emp Crush and<br/>\nD&#39;Vinn - my pet sacrificed itself so that we all could<br/>\nregroup and finish the job. 2 of the group members were<br/>\nin the same guild, and immediately asked me to join.<br/>\nThere have been no limits to the help i&#39;ve gotten<br/>\nsince.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;d love to hear from anyone from Xev!!!! I have a<br/>\nlvl16 druid and lvl 16 mage. Honestly, i like playing<br/>\nthe druid better - but now that i&#39;m at level 16 with<br/>\nthe mage, i can tinker and do spell research - which<br/>\nseems fun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This site seems like it&#39;s for people<br/>\nlike me - Ever wish you sould give a /tell to your<br/>\nfriend when you&#39;re next to any annoying person? When I<br/>\ngo to a party, I always want to &quot;/who all&quot; to see<br/>\nwho&#39;s there. And are any of you married?? Oh, man - my<br/>\nwife is not a gamer, and i&#39;ve learned that when we<br/>\nmade plans to visit her mother, she does not care if<br/>\nthere is a weekend long guild war. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope to hear<br/>\nfrom you all!!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela of Xev&lt;br&gt;Wood elf druid<br/>\nof the 16th season&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serrafina of Xev&lt;br&gt;Gnome<br/>\nMage of the 16th season</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
