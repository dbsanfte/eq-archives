BTW... the groups<br/>\nwe&#39;ve been running have been from 17 to 26... and we<br/>\nhaven&#39;t gone all the way in. I&#39;d imagine there&#39;s even<br/>\nMORE stuff the further down you go. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s<br/>\nsome pretty phat loot down there too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uaria<br/>\nLifebringer, 31 cleric of Bristlebane&lt;br&gt;Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
