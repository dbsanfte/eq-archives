My<br/>\nmain play server is Brell, where my highest Chars are<br/>\n46, 29, 28, 26 (and a few lower ones). I also play on<br/>\nThe Seventh Hammer, my highest char being level 29.<br/>\nVeeshan - level 12. And last but not least, I play on one<br/>\nof the PvP-team servers. I have to say that all in<br/>\nall the [older] players on the PvP-team server are<br/>\nfar more mature than the non-PvP(team) servers. The<br/>\nSeventh Hammer has alot of younger players since it&#39;s a<br/>\nnewer server (than Brell) but the attitude of the<br/>\nplayers is generally the same. You have your jerks, you<br/>\nhave the good people as well. The nicest server I&#39;ve<br/>\never been to tho was the test server believe it or<br/>\nnot. The people there, that have been around since the<br/>\nbegining are mostly a nice group. Easy to talk to, and<br/>\npretty friendly. Anyway, that&#39;s just my two cents. If<br/>\nanything, I&#39;ll always tell ya Brell Sucks, but in all<br/>\nactuality I feel the same about it that I do about the<br/>\nother servers. They suck equally LoL</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
