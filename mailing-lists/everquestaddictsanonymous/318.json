Either<br/>\nthat, or get in a group that doesn&#39;t need much healing<br/>\nand bash away as much as possible-- your hits won&#39;t<br/>\nagro much, so your offense and weapon skills are the<br/>\nonly ones like to go up this way--unless you can agro<br/>\nwith spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suggestion-- before you try these<br/>\nthings, layer up on all DEX and AGI items/buffs you can<br/>\nfind. This will help your offense/defense/weapon skills<br/>\ngo up quicker. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can&#39;t train in<br/>\noffense/defense-- : (&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottom Line, though--- how much melee<br/>\ndo you really think you&#39;ll be doing?? Defense will<br/>\ngo up if you keep healing and agroing things on you.<br/>\nI fought the good fight as a druid and still would<br/>\nmelee up to about lvl 29. I still melee when soloing<br/>\nSOMETIMES-- more often though i&#39;ll do classic root kiting and<br/>\nnever pick up a weapon, i&#39;d rather hold somthing that<br/>\ngives me more WIS or Mana. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would you be screwed<br/>\nif you didn&#39;t up your melee skills at all?? Not<br/>\nreally. Would you be screwed if you didn&#39;t up your<br/>\nAlteration at every level-- DEFINITELY!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela<br/>\nOrcbane&lt;br&gt;Druid of the 33d Season&lt;br&gt;Priest of Tunare, who has<br/>\ngiven up physical combat&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
