When I&#39;m hungry and<br/>\nwant to play EQ, I&#39;ll put some bread or muffins and<br/>\nmilk or water in a bag or a backpack, and hope that<br/>\nsomehow I automatically eat them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. When I&#39;m<br/>\ndriving (usually home to play EQ) and someone cuts me off<br/>\nor I see a red light, I&#39;ll start hearing that<br/>\nfamiliar battle music. Also happens when someone ticks me<br/>\noff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. When working out (which I do very<br/>\nlittle of now that EQ flexes my brain, mouse hand, and<br/>\ntyping fingers plenty), I&#39;ll /con other guys in the gym.<br/>\nIf I keep benching and squating, maybe that guy in<br/>\nthe Everlast shirt will end up &quot;you would have the<br/>\nupper hand,&quot; instead of &quot;tombstone.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. I run<br/>\neverywhere. Why would you walk? Also, if I get fatigued, I<br/>\nsit down with my legs crossed and open up a book.<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. I&#39;ve seen this posted on other boards, and find<br/>\nmyself with the same desire to jump into any body of<br/>\nwatter to practice my swimming skill. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. When I<br/>\nget change at a restuarant, I look at each $1.00 and<br/>\nthink &quot;Hey, 9 more and i&#39;ll have a plat.!!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7.<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m at the store, and can&#39;t find my something I<br/>\nreally want, I have the urge to shout &quot;Want to buy<br/>\n___x___, send tell!!!&quot; But then I remember that I should<br/>\n/auction instead of /shout, so I just quitely check the<br/>\nshelf again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. When on-line in a chat room<br/>\nwith friends (which happens less often now, because<br/>\nthat&#39;s time I could be on EQ), my friends are perplexed<br/>\nwhen each of my entries starts with &quot;/g ____&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;/tell Steve ____&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9. On the same line, I was in<br/>\na chat room with 3 friends last week and one friend<br/>\nwas being a jerk. So I type &quot;/tell Mike Dude, Steve&#39;s<br/>\nlame! Why is he trying to blame you for HIS car running<br/>\nout of gas?&quot; After I realized what I did (and still<br/>\npartially in EQ-world), I typed &quot;uh... sorry, wrong<br/>\ntell.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10. When at the mall, I was standing in line when I<br/>\nnoticed a really cute girl smiling at me. I immediately<br/>\nthought &quot;/who all that hot chick&quot; And laughed when my<br/>\nbrain spit out -- &quot;Miranda, [High School Student]age17<br/>\nlatina, Los Angeles&quot; (Hmm... too low level to share<br/>\nexperience with). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;11. I was walking down the hall at<br/>\nwork, when an obnoxious co-worker say me. I tried to<br/>\n&quot;hide,&quot; but I guess he had see invisible. After an<br/>\nunpleasant encounter with him (which ended in me fleeing for<br/>\nthe zone -- aka elevator), I thought &quot;what a stupid<br/>\nnewbie mistake, he must have been undead-- THAT&#39;s what<br/>\nhide wouldn&#39;t work&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;12. My dad was going to<br/>\ngive me this great TV because he was getting a new big<br/>\nscreen. He said &quot;do you want it?&quot; I said &quot;i&#39;m kinda low<br/>\non plat right now, haven&#39;t banked lately.&quot; He looked<br/>\nat me like I was nuts, and said, &quot;no, i&#39;ll give it<br/>\nto you.&quot; I hesitated for a minute, wondering if this<br/>\nkind of twinking was ok. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;13. I am convinced<br/>\nthat my sense heading is maxed out, so I never travel<br/>\nwith a map. Then I wish I hadn&#39;t been been too cheap<br/>\nto buy True North when my girlfriend says &quot;You have<br/>\nno idea what direction you&#39;re facing!!!&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;14.<br/>\nI recently took 2 days off from EQ to go to Vegas.<br/>\nI won a big hand in poker, and yelled out &quot;WOOT&quot;!!<br/>\nEveryone looked at me like I was crazy, except the<br/>\nblackjack dealer at the next table, who walked by me and<br/>\nsaid quietly, &quot;Xersi on the Drinal server.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;15.<br/>\nI renamed my dog Gobabaner. I have to constantly<br/>\nrepeat comands to him, because he&#39;s as thick as a water<br/>\nelemental. /pet back off, /pet guard here. When I leave him<br/>\ninside sometimes, I wonder who wandered by and cast<br/>\nBurnout on him-- he always seems &quot;to go<br/>\nberzerk.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are more, but I need to get back to the game. /g<br/>\nSee you all on-line!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;20th<br/>\nseason Druid&lt;br&gt;Xev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
