It all depends on what<br/>\nyou would be interested in. Personally i am a cleric<br/>\non Druzzil Ro, i love being a cleric b/c you get to<br/>\nsave lives via healing, as well as ressurecting when<br/>\nyou are older. Being a caster rocks! Look into all<br/>\nthe classes and read about them @ www.eqlizer.com<br/>\nthey have great info. See what would fit you better.<br/>\n:) If you need anything else send me an e-mail to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crazy1incali@...\">crazy1incali@...</a>. :) Happy hunting brothers and sisters of Norrath!<br/>\n:)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
