See, i dont have the game, but i&#39;m<br/>\nconsidering it. I just wanted to know if you all think it&#39;s<br/>\nworth it. Plus, what is it about exactly? Like, what do<br/>\nyou do in it? I&#39;ve heard a little about it and<br/>\nthought it sounded interesting, but i&#39;m not entirely sure<br/>\nwhat it&#39;s about. Is there a demo i could get<br/>\nsomewhere? I checked everquest.com and couldnt find one,<br/>\nmaybe i just missed it. thanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
