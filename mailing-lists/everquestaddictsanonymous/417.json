My <br/>\ndruid (retired) is still at 52, but my Iksar monk is now 36. His <br/>\n(monk) Dual Wield is now maxed at (252). His highest kick so far is <br/>\n83 dmg. I got some new weapons for my warrior. He now has Blood Point <br/>\nin primary and Frostbringer in offhand. He still carries his Lammy <br/>\nand Goranga Spiked Club, but the combo of BP and FB is an AWESOME <br/>\ncombo. The monk now has Goranga Spiked club in primary and Fist of <br/>\nRock in offhand. Hoping to find good 2hb for my monk and start my <br/>\ntraining in that soon. All in all things are moving along well. I <br/>\nhope to see you all soon....I am on Saryrn Server.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeggo Oribarshu<br/>\n53 Champion Ogre<br/>\nDefender of Ancient Council<br/>\nSlave to no god.<br/>\n<br/>\nFepony Spellcaster<br/>\n52 Woodelf Wanderer<br/>\nDefender of Ancient Council<br/>\nPriest of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\nMekiku Thunderfoot<br/>\n36 Iksar Monk<br/>\nDefender of Ancient Council<br/>\nPainbringer of Casic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
