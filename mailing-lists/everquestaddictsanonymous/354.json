I know my guild has lost about 1/2 dozen to DOAC.<br/>\nI also know about the same # who have already come<br/>\nback to EQ from DOAC. I hear it&#39;s cool and different,<br/>\nbut i&#39;m just not interested in leaving EQ at all-- I<br/>\nmean, I&#39;ve never even been to the Mines of<br/>\nNurga!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AND-- i started playing on the roleplay server, which<br/>\nhas strengthened my addiction 100 fold!!! I just wish<br/>\nthere were more halflings to talk too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other<br/>\ngames have come and gone-- I used to play a little bit<br/>\nof a lot of games until i got EQ a year ago. Some<br/>\npeople are saying that 2 years is the max cut off-- that<br/>\neveryone gets tired of it by that time-- well then-- i&#39;ve<br/>\ngot another year to go!!!! And with Luclin coming<br/>\nsoon, and the fact that i haven&#39;t played a PvP char<br/>\nyet-- i&#39;d say i&#39;m set for as long as Verant will take<br/>\nmy +/-$10.00/month (which, i&#39;m sure, would be long<br/>\nafter the stop supporting EQ-- haha). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any<br/>\nthoughts??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xev---&lt;br&gt;Xela Orcbane&lt;br&gt;Serrafina Elemistress&lt;br&gt;Mandir<br/>\nD&#39;terrible&lt;br&gt;Sscaylee&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FV--&lt;br&gt;Rumble</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
