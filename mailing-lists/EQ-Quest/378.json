I am on Bristlebane <br/>\nif you are on that one you can look me up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are quite a few advice websites out there  the best ones are <br/>\nwww.eqtraders.com   and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.allakhazam.com\">http://everquest.allakhazam.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThose will lead you to other sites if they don&#39;t answer any questions <br/>\nyou have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral Advice:  Keep all those useless items.  All spider and <br/>\nspiderling silk, all bones, all bat wings, all fish scales.  All are <br/>\nusable for other things.  Silks are used in tailoring, bones are used by <br/>\nnecros i think, bat wings have many uses, fish scales are used in spell <br/>\ncasting.  If you are going to use them yourself, those items can be kept <br/>\nin stacks of up to 20 and sold to other players.  My all time high was <br/>\nwhen I got 20 pp for a stack of bones but that is rare, more likely to <br/>\nget 4-7 for those.<br/>\nI could go on and on about such item: pelts, belts, shoulderpads, all <br/>\nitems have a use just have to figure it out.  Eqtraders has a <br/>\ncomprehensive list of  how to use items and where to find what you need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBebinn<br/>\n<br/>\n15 Woodelf Ranger of  Tunare on Bristlebane Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
