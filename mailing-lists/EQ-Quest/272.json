What do you mean by that?  I suspect the<br/>\nartists just got lazy and re-used images.  there is a sea monster in<br/>\nLake Rathe that&#39;s supposed to be rare, and around level 50.  Not sure<br/>\nwhat it drops, or even if anyone has ever killed it.  Don&#39;t know<br/>\nanything about a clockwork dragon.  On the EQ map there is an area<br/>\ncalled Dragonscale hills just south of Ak&#39;Anon that was probably<br/>\nnever developed.  Perhaps there was supposed to be a clockwork dragon<br/>\nin this zone?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;PHAEDRA WHITLOCK&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWHITLOCK@...\">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@onelist.com\">EQ-Quest@onelist.com</a><br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sisterhood@...\">sisterhood@...</a>&gt;,&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@onelist.com\">EQ-Quest@onelist.com</a>&gt;, <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tunare@onelist.com\">Tunare@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Quest] [EQ] Mysteries of Norrath<br/>\nDate: Wed, 29 Dec 1999 13:54:51 -0600<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce someone sent me a URL for an EQ bulletin board/discussion forum that <br/>\ncontained a thread on Mysteries of Norrath.
