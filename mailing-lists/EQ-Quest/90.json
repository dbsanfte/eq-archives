I have one of the two pages and all it says is &quot;page 34 of a book&quot; Keep  that card since I have never gotten one I am not sure what it is for but I have noticed several quest that have something to do with the Library of Erudin. So far the Eruds tonic quests, Quest to fix Shakey the Scarecrow, and Testament of Vanear  quest all have vital information in the library.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks<br/>\nMushin<br/>\nEnchanter<br/>\n <br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Louie/Zandrix/Zaphod2064 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:louie@...\">louie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard-labbs@...\">wizard-labbs@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard-labbs@...\">wizard-labbs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Friday, May 21, 1999 1:39 PM<br/>\n    Subject: About your post for EQ quests<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    About this book...  I believe I have found one of the pages, but I am not sure... when you get infomation about this item, it says &quot;Library of Erudin&quot;.  Usually I just destroy this item, but you have sparked my interest.  I would like more information about this quest.  Thank you  ; )<br/>\n    <br/>\n    By the way, I did not have to kill anything to get this page.  A certain NPC drops it.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Gibblin (main character)<br/>\n    Halfling Druid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
