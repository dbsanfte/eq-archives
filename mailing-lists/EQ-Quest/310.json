I looked all over in an effort to find<br/>\n&gt; something that <br/>\n&gt; would help his faction and came up with donuts.  I<br/>\n&gt; remember that one <br/>\n&gt; of the things that was suggested was to go to HH<br/>\n&gt; Pass and kill Orcs, <br/>\n&gt; for that would help his faction.  At the time, this<br/>\n&gt; did not seem to <br/>\n&gt; do the trick.<br/>\n&gt; \tWell, I don&#39;t know if my friend just didn&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; what to do, <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t do it enough, or if the thing just didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; work then, but I can <br/>\n&gt; now say for sure that killing both HH orcs and HH<br/>\n&gt; gnolls will help, <br/>\n&gt; but the BIG payoff is running their scalps to the<br/>\n&gt; local guard <br/>\n&gt; captains.  Give them a single scalp and you will get<br/>\n&gt; exp as well as <br/>\n&gt; faction gains for several different hard to modify<br/>\n&gt; groups - including <br/>\n&gt; the Freeport Militia.  The beauty of this one is<br/>\n&gt; that there are no <br/>\n&gt; faction losses, as are most of the other +Militia<br/>\n&gt; quests of which I <br/>\n&gt; know.  You also get between 1 and 6 gold pieces for<br/>\n&gt; doing this, so <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s good for a reasonable chunk of change as well. <br/>\n&gt; I turned in <br/>\n&gt; about 25 of the scalps and went from apprehensive to<br/>\n&gt; indifferent.<br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Aaron Braunstein<br/>\n&gt; Pacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n&gt; (408)283-5900 xt. 28<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
