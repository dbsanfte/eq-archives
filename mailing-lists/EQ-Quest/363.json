How do you get the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;final and needed coin from the lady merchant in Qeynos hills? All she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;does is look at my and cry. I&#39;ve tried everything! Any help would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Appreciated. Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I lifted the following text from allakhazam&#39;s Web site hope it helps:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the second floor one of the buildings in a small group of buildings to<br/>\n&gt; the EAST of &quot;The Lion&#39;s Mane Tavern&quot; and to the south of &quot;Nesiff&#39;s Wooden<br/>\n&gt; Weapons&quot; and the &quot;Bag and Barrel&quot;, you will find a man named Vicus Nonad<br/>\n&gt; with a bad cough. After talking to him for a bit, he will tell you that he<br/>\n&gt; is a tax collecter and needs you to make his runs for him. He will give<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; a box, in which to place and combine the taxes, and a scroll with the<br/>\nnames<br/>\n&gt; of the people. To get the taxes from the, simply hail them and say &quot;Please<br/>\n&gt; pay your taxes.&quot; Doing this will give you a very small lowering of faction<br/>\n&gt; with Qeynos merchants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Upon going to Mira Sayer, In Qeynos Hills, and asking her to pay, she will<br/>\n&gt; begin to cry. When you ask her why she is crying, she will tell you a<br/>\n&gt; halfling named Flynn something or other stole her tax money. He is in<br/>\nCrow&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Pub in Qeynos. Go to him, hail him, and ask him if he stole Mira&#39;s tax<br/>\n&gt; money. He will affirm this, and tell you to say &quot;I am a gnoll loving<br/>\n&gt; weakling and am not worthy to comb your feet&quot; After doing so, he will<br/>\nshout<br/>\n&gt; it, and the entire zone will hear what an idiot you are. He&#39;ll give you<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; money<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
