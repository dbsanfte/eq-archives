Go to Options and limit what kind of<br/>\nppl can trade with you, you can make it just group members, or make it so<br/>\nthat you will not accept trades from anyone. Putting up the trade window is<br/>\nnot a way at all to a person that knows his options in EQ, take a look<br/>\nsometime, you will be better off knowing what you can and cant do.<br/>\nthe -kinda- best way is cancel magic, but even thats not so hot. he might<br/>\njust sit there and wait for the best time to strike, IE: When the critter he<br/>\nwants is near half life and then nuke the snot out of it, so there is<br/>\nnothing you can do.<br/>\n<br/>\none of the better ways was mentioned by Lanadina the Magician, and thats to<br/>\nback off. Let the wiz have his cake and then he might either leave, or get<br/>\nhis ass handed back to him from the ensuing mob. In my personal travels tho,<br/>\nthe best way to beat a wiz, is with another wiz. if they are close in lvls<br/>\nyour mage will have the advantage. I have sent many a wiz packing just cuz i<br/>\nwas faster and better than he was [and after that he offered us an INSANE<br/>\namount of money for the item he wanted].<br/>\n<br/>\nbut most of all, dont immediately go to dirty tactics when you see a wiz,<br/>\ntalk to him, find out what he wants and see if the option of turns, or a<br/>\nline up, or just giving him the item [if none of your group want it] and let<br/>\nhim be on his way. the easiest method to do is talk IN A CALM AND SENSE-ABLE<br/>\nMANNER. there are too many kids out there that just jump to conclusions and<br/>\nthink that all wizards are KSers and start spamming OOC and generally making<br/>\nan ass of themselves. sometimes Wizards dont see you kiting, or behind that<br/>\nhill and see a kill like anyother person. Wizs can shoot far so they dont<br/>\nhave to be near to kill things. sometimes they think you are in trouble and<br/>\njust want to help out [for which i have been spammed SO much that i only<br/>\nhelp when asked now]<br/>\n<br/>\ntake it easy, take some vallium, take your time, and HAVE FUN, if this game<br/>\nis causing you to have ulcers cuz of shiat like this, then step back, think<br/>\nof options, and plan what to do that doesnt resort to you showing the world<br/>\nwhat an immature person you are. [i no there are bad wizards out there, but<br/>\ntruthfully, its a real LOW percentage that doesnt reflect the avg mentality<br/>\nof the wizards in Norrath]<br/>\n<br/>\nVanya - Lv 20 Wizard - Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Rus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:icekool@...\">icekool@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@onelist.com\">EQ-Quest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 10, 1999 12:31 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ-Quest] what trade window tactic?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Rus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:icekool@...\">icekool@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; put something in a casters trade window and they cant cast spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Adams [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thugsy@...\">thugsy@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 10, 1999 9:25 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@onelist.com\">EQ-Quest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ-Quest] what trade window tactic?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: John Adams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thugsy@...\">thugsy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What trade window Tactic?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
