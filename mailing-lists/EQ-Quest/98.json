I had to find the four observatories<br/>\n&gt; and get the spare lens from them. One had it stolen from a dark elf<br/>\n&gt; rogue, and I have promptly taken it back. One was with some gnome who<br/>\n&gt; was captured by slavers in the mino caves. I&#39;m sure I can get that one<br/>\n&gt; back. The other two say to me &quot;Sorry, I have no spare lens, come back<br/>\n&gt; in a few weeks&quot;. Can you actually get them to give you spare lens, or<br/>\n&gt; do you simply have to repeatedly get lens from the other places (as<br/>\n&gt; they are stackable).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has over 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
