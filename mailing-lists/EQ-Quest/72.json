But I believe that the Tonic may still<br/>\nbe on the Dwarf. As far as I know there is no property room in the jail but<br/>\nthere is a guard in the room adjacent to the cell room that you can talk to.<br/>\nHe speaks of what happens to criminals in Erudin and how they are punished.<br/>\nIs Eruds Tonic made out of the vasty deep water that was smuggled out by<br/>\nMoorodo and his accomplice and then sold on the black marget as a potion<br/>\ncalled Eruds Tonic?<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE:  Criminals are put out to sea once they are dismembered. Actually they<br/>\nare put in Eruds Crossing... Eruds crossing may hold the secret of where you<br/>\ncan obtain the Tonic. Is it at the depth of the crossing from previos people<br/>\nwho attempted to steal the Tonic?<br/>\n<br/>\nI will have to research this further since the plots seem to run parallel...<br/>\nperhapse the Dwarf was tricked by Moorodo to get the Tonic and Moorodo is<br/>\ntrying to trick you also. The Dwarf talks about how he wants you to help him<br/>\nget out of jail... I think that if you concentrate on this then he will give<br/>\nor lead you to the Tonic.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some brainstorming.<br/>\n<br/>\nMushin<br/>\nEnchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tom Matthews &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmatthews@...\">tmatthews@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@onelist.com\">EQ-Quest@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@onelist.com\">EQ-Quest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, May 18, 1999 7:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ-Quest] Erud&#39;s Tonic<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Tom Matthews &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmatthews@...\">tmatthews@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I went west a while ago to sell items....well a friend requested 2 items<br/>\n&gt;if I could pick them up for him. They are for a quest for a Bartender&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;Book in Freeport. Two of the items are a Kolandi (sp?) fish from Temple<br/>\n&gt;of Life in Qeynos (found that, loved the faction hit didnt know you<br/>\n&gt;could p/o a Diety) the other was Erud&#39;s Tonic now that&#39;s where I dead<br/>\n&gt;end. Supposedly it&#39;s sold at a merchant in Erudian, well I checked every<br/>\n&gt;single merchant on the isle (and had Erudians check the ones who<br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t talk to me) and none sold it (Side Note: Picked up Innorukk&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;Kiss of Death, Lore Item, any ideas what it&#39;s for?).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Four NPCs talk about Erud&#39;s Tonic...One is Mordoor (something) a Erudian<br/>\n&gt;near Crow&#39;s in Qeynos, he says he&#39;s sick and needs Erud&#39;s Tonic which<br/>\n&gt;supposedly is sold in Erudian according to him (side note: to poison him<br/>\n&gt;is a different quest), Second NPC is (something) Bluehawk in Bluehawk&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;in Erudian, he says Erud&#39;s Tonic is not for travelers, even to Erudites,<br/>\n&gt;the Third NPC is the Bookworm (forget name, she will say bookworm when<br/>\n&gt;hailed) in the Library in Erudian, she says Erud&#39;s Tonic should not be<br/>\n&gt;spoken of,......and last but not least there the Gnome in the Erudian<br/>\n&gt;jail, ask him and he says, he did not know you could not leave Erudian<br/>\n&gt;with Erud&#39;s Tonic and please get him out of jail. Now my ultimate<br/>\n&gt;decision maybe to kill the Gnome maybe he still has it on him but I<br/>\n&gt;really don&#39;t want to take a faction hit like that, beside with this one<br/>\n&gt;quest you become a hunted person by two major groups.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s finally here!
