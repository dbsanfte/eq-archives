After talking to him for a bit, he will tell you that he<br/>\nis a tax collecter and needs you to make his runs for him. He will give you<br/>\na box, in which to place and combine the taxes, and a scroll with the names<br/>\nof the people. To get the taxes from the, simply hail them and say &quot;Please<br/>\npay your taxes.&quot; Doing this will give you a very small lowering of faction<br/>\nwith Qeynos merchants.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon going to Mira Sayer, In Qeynos Hills, and asking her to pay, she will<br/>\nbegin to cry. When you ask her why she is crying, she will tell you a<br/>\nhalfling named Flynn something or other stole her tax money. He is in Crow&#39;s<br/>\nPub in Qeynos. Go to him, hail him, and ask him if he stole Mira&#39;s tax<br/>\nmoney. He will affirm this, and tell you to say &quot;I am a gnoll loving<br/>\nweakling and am not worthy to comb your feet&quot; After doing so, he will shout<br/>\nit, and the entire zone will hear what an idiot you are. He&#39;ll give you the<br/>\nmoney</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
