QHills or Commons possible. Then again, it mightve been in several zones, would have had to be judging by the frequent crashes this week past.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend thinks they have the original url, and so with luck I can post it here this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nA druid friend of mine just heard about the Rathe sea monster and is planning on banking his gear and going to take a look. Anyone ever done this?<br/>\n<br/>\nEverlore.com has a lot of info on this, where to find the tunnel etc, and says that there are some big sharks (plural, described as not your usual shark, and red to him) there in the tunnel, and so the poster didnt go all the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a>&gt; 12/30/99 09:46AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:srutkowski@...\">srutkowski@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne piece about the below is false.  On the final day in beta, the Gods<br/>\nthemselves waged war, and I believe that everyone was turned to PvP.  This event<br/>\ndid not happen at the arena.  Aradune was slain protecting Karana.  And I<br/>\nbelieve it was in Nek Forest, but I could have the location wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. THE FIERY AVENGER<br/>\n<br/>\nFACT: Aradune once wielded a weapon called the Fiery Avenger that looked like a<br/>\nFlaming Sword. The Sword had been looted off of Aradune by a player in the Arena<br/>\nafter a PvP event in the final phases of beta. This the ONLY confirmed time<br/>\nanyone but Aradune EVER wielded a Fiery Avenger. The Fiery Avenger is a two<br/>\nhanded slash weapon with very good damage and delay, and a Direct Damage effect.<br/>\nREMEMBER ALL OF THE ABOVE IS PROVEN TO BE TRUE.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
