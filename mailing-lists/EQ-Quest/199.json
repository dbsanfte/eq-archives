Currently the event is in the preliminary stages of planning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Event Coordinator is looking for people to fill the following positions.<br/>\n<br/>\nVictim: You must be willing to have you Character killed (only once) and may<br/>\nloose an item and money. This is because you will not know when the attack<br/>\nwill happen. We are hoping to have several possible victims to give the<br/>\nmurderer a variety and to ensure that the killing happens randomly when you<br/>\nare not expecting it. However you will be free to fight back and are allowed<br/>\nto defend yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMurderer/Assassin: Your job will be to kill one of the possible victims. You<br/>\nwill not know where they are and will only have their Names.  Should you<br/>\nfail in your attempt to kill the victim you are to attempt the murder of<br/>\nanother name on the list. Once you are successful you are to loot the body<br/>\nand take one item. You must keep this item on you character and can not sell<br/>\nor give it away.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynch Mob: The Members of the Lynch mob will be required to track down the<br/>\nMurderer and return them to the scene of the crime for Trail. There will be<br/>\nno limit on the number of people in the Lynch Mob<br/>\n<br/>\nJury:<br/>\nThe Jurors will decide the Guilt or Innocence of the Murderer. We are hoping<br/>\nfor a Panel of at least 6 Jurors. (you are allowed to create a low level<br/>\ncharacter to act as a juror specifically for this event.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease Inform your friends of this event or Visit.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.wizard-labbs.com/ralloszek/index.html<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nMushin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
