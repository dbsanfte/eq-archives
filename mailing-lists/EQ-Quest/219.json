I&#39;ll give you an example..<br/>\n<br/>\nIm up on trainer mountain trying for the Shiny Brass Shield..I&#39;m all by <br/>\nmyself...I kill him couple of times..no shield..couple of people wander up <br/>\nand we agree to rotate...we do this for about an hour when this mage comes <br/>\nup..i inform him that the 4 of us have agreed to rotate to elimnate any hard <br/>\nfeelings..he informs me there is no rules or rotating and he will kill him <br/>\nall he wants..I inform mage&#39;boy that i will do whatever it takes to prevent <br/>\nthis including not playing fair. He tells me to go do something to <br/>\nmyself...It was someone elses turn for the trainer..so as soon as he spawned <br/>\ni start trading crushbone belts to him...he cant get off but one spell, <br/>\ncause i was a little slow with the mouse...the guy got his kill and the mage <br/>\nleft pissed...heheh..vengence was ours..<br/>\n<br/>\nI say let them ban me...i refuse to let kill stealers ruin a good time.  I <br/>\nfigure the worst they can do the first time is give me a warning and I have <br/>\nyet to even get that...the fact is they can turn off their trade <br/>\nwindow...but at least this gives you some ammo...<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: John Adams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thugsy@...\">thugsy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@onelist.com\">EQ-Quest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@onelist.com\">EQ-Quest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ-Quest] what trade window tactic?<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 10 Aug 1999 06:24:43 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: John Adams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thugsy@...\">thugsy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What trade window Tactic?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;exp with this.
