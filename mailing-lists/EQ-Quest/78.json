I finally got the note when I talked to Larsk<br/>\nJuton about the meeting BEFORE I killed Gnasher.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\nMessage: 11<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 18 May 1999 14:40:04 -0600<br/>\n   From: &quot;M. Brock Harris&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:savyj@...\">savyj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Charisma and it&#39;s Effect on Buying and Selling<br/>\n<br/>\nCharisma most DEFINITELY has an effect on buying and selling.  Even one<br/>\npoint.  It&#39;s a linear scale.  I built about 40 different throw away<br/>\ncharacters and tested things like STR to ATTK bonus and AGI to AC bonus<br/>\nAND Charisma and pricing.  A Charisma of 74 vs a Char of 70 reached a<br/>\n1-2% savings in price and garnered another 1-2% increase in value of<br/>\ngoods sold.  This doesn&#39;t seem like much but then again, it was only a 4<br/>\npoint difference.  I will build an Enchanter (Max. Char 115) and give<br/>\nhim my two magic items (when I get the second one) to bolster it to 125<br/>\nand see what the difference is then.  Will post results back here.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and to make this a valid posting.  I can&#39;t seem to find the note on<br/>\nGnasher (Surefall Glade Quest).  I have killed him three times.<br/>\nHead...yes, note...no.  Any pointers or is this compeletely random?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEryndor of Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
