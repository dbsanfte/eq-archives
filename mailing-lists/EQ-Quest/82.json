But a patron<br/>\nat the bar says something if you also note from my post I went and talked to the<br/>\nbookworm in the library (This is the &quot;hot&quot; info on the quest page). If you Hail<br/>\na girl on the second floor she will say she is a bookworm, when asked about<br/>\nErud&#39;s Tonic she will say she cannot speak of it, heck I even tried kissing her<br/>\n(colon) because that is was the patron says to do, give her a kiss for him tried<br/>\nsay and emotion with kiss (so did an Erudite).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso for someone who asked in another post I am level 14 Dwarven Warrior, but I<br/>\nhave had Erudites from level 1 to 23 ask for me with same results and eventhough<br/>\nthis Tonic is hinted at being a part of many quests, the reason I am seaking it<br/>\nis for an Exotic Drink in Freeport for a Bartending book for brewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nMushin wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Mushin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mushin@...\">mushin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have begun my journey back to Erudin to buy supplies and to catalog what I<br/>\n&gt; know of Eruds tonic.

They are for a quest for a Bartender&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Book in Freeport. Two of the items are a Kolandi (sp?) fish from Temple<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of Life in Qeynos (found that, loved the faction hit didnt know you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;could p/o a Diety) the other was Erud&#39;s Tonic now that&#39;s where I dead<br/>\n&gt; &gt;end. Supposedly it&#39;s sold at a merchant in Erudian, well I checked every<br/>\n&gt; &gt;single merchant on the isle (and had Erudians check the ones who<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wouldn&#39;t talk to me) and none sold it (Side Note: Picked up Innorukk&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Kiss of Death, Lore Item, any ideas what it&#39;s for?).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Four NPCs talk about Erud&#39;s Tonic...One is Mordoor (something) a Erudian<br/>\n&gt; &gt;near Crow&#39;s in Qeynos, he says he&#39;s sick and needs Erud&#39;s Tonic which<br/>\n&gt; &gt;supposedly is sold in Erudian according to him (side note: to poison him<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is a different quest), Second NPC is (something) Bluehawk in Bluehawk&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in Erudian, he says Erud&#39;s Tonic is not for travelers, even to Erudites,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the Third NPC is the Bookworm (forget name, she will say bookworm when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hailed) in the Library in Erudian, she says Erud&#39;s Tonic should not be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spoken of,......and last but not least there the Gnome in the Erudian<br/>\n&gt; &gt;jail, ask him and he says, he did not know you could not leave Erudian<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with Erud&#39;s Tonic and please get him out of jail. Now my ultimate<br/>\n&gt; &gt;decision maybe to kill the Gnome maybe he still has it on him but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;really don&#39;t want to take a faction hit like that, beside with this one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;quest you become a hunted person by two major groups.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It&#39;s finally here!
