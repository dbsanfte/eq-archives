The interesting thing about this quest is that it is totally random when it occers and the actions and events going on around you determine when it starts. For every person it is different. Somtimes you hace to scour the entire countryside and others times you just have to walk around the corner to complete it but the reward is probably the greatest for any quest ever.  Every time this quest starts it puts and end to whatever you are doing but you can chooses to complete it or not. For some the reward is not worth the time or difficulty and for others it is so necessary that will will not be satisfied utill they complete it. What quest is theis?
