You<br/>\nas an individual (race, class, charisma, religion) and by your actions (what<br/>\nyou hunt, the quests you do) affect your standing with every faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should pay attention to what the paladin says.  He told you that you<br/>\nhave not proven yourself to the temple.  That means he doesn&#39;t trust you,<br/>\nand isn&#39;t going to say another word until you improve your faction with the<br/>\nTemple.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo out and kill things till you see a faction adjustment that lists that<br/>\nparticular temple.  Then go out of your way to beat that particular critter<br/>\ntype up.  After ten or so kills, go back and check and see if he&#39;ll trust<br/>\nyou further.  If not, and you really want to help him out, go out and<br/>\ncontinue the slaughter.  Eventually he&#39;ll tell you how you can help.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe aware that if you are a different race, class and/or religion, this might<br/>\ntake a whole lot of effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n - Roger  -<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;A quest with the Paladins for a poachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say Hail to the Janlin Sklar (or something like that)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says a bunch of mumbo jumbo with the words (protect the peace) in<br/>\nbrackets.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo naturally I say:<br/>\n<br/>\nProtect the Peace?<br/>\nHow can I protect the peace?<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery variation I can think...<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing...all I get is I have not proven myself to the Temple yet...eh?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
