I looked all over in an effort to find<br/>\n &gt; something that<br/>\n &gt; would help his faction and came up with donuts.  I<br/>\n &gt; remember that one<br/>\n &gt; of the things that was suggested was to go to HH<br/>\n &gt; Pass and kill Orcs,<br/>\n &gt; for that would help his faction.  At the time, this<br/>\n &gt; did not seem to<br/>\n &gt; do the trick.<br/>\n &gt; \tWell, I don&#39;t know if my friend just didn&#39;t know<br/>\n &gt; what to do,<br/>\n &gt; didn&#39;t do it enough, or if the thing just didn&#39;t<br/>\n &gt; work then, but I can<br/>\n &gt; now say for sure that killing both HH orcs and HH<br/>\n &gt; gnolls will help,<br/>\n &gt; but the BIG payoff is running their scalps to the<br/>\n &gt; local guard<br/>\n &gt; captains.  Give them a single scalp and you will get<br/>\n &gt; exp as well as<br/>\n &gt; faction gains for several different hard to modify<br/>\n &gt; groups - including<br/>\n &gt; the Freeport Militia.  The beauty of this one is<br/>\n &gt; that there are no<br/>\n &gt; faction losses, as are most of the other +Militia<br/>\n &gt; quests of which I<br/>\n &gt; know.  You also get between 1 and 6 gold pieces for<br/>\n &gt; doing this, so<br/>\n &gt; it&#39;s good for a reasonable chunk of change as well.<br/>\n &gt; I turned in<br/>\n &gt; about 25 of the scalps and went from apprehensive to<br/>\n &gt; indifferent.<br/>\n &gt; --<br/>\n &gt; Aaron Braunstein<br/>\n &gt; Pacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n &gt; (408)283-5900 xt. 28<br/>\n &gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
