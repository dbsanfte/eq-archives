They are for a quest for a Bartender&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Book in Freeport. Two of the items are a Kolandi (sp?) fish from Temple<br/>\n&gt; of Life in Qeynos (found that, loved the faction hit didnt know you<br/>\n&gt; could p/o a Diety) the other was Erud&#39;s Tonic now that&#39;s where I dead<br/>\n&gt; end. Supposedly it&#39;s sold at a merchant in Erudian, well I checked every<br/>\n&gt; single merchant on the isle (and had Erudians check the ones who<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t talk to me) and none sold it (Side Note: Picked up Innorukk&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Kiss of Death, Lore Item, any ideas what it&#39;s for?).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Four NPCs talk about Erud&#39;s Tonic...One is Mordoor (something) a Erudian<br/>\n&gt; near Crow&#39;s in Qeynos, he says he&#39;s sick and needs Erud&#39;s Tonic which<br/>\n&gt; supposedly is sold in Erudian according to him (side note: to poison him<br/>\n&gt; is a different quest), Second NPC is (something) Bluehawk in Bluehawk&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; in Erudian, he says Erud&#39;s Tonic is not for travelers, even to Erudites,<br/>\n&gt; the Third NPC is the Bookworm (forget name, she will say bookworm when<br/>\n&gt; hailed) in the Library in Erudian, she says Erud&#39;s Tonic should not be<br/>\n&gt; spoken of,......and last but not least there the Gnome in the Erudian<br/>\n&gt; jail, ask him and he says, he did not know you could not leave Erudian<br/>\n&gt; with Erud&#39;s Tonic and please get him out of jail. Now my ultimate<br/>\n&gt; decision maybe to kill the Gnome maybe he still has it on him but I<br/>\n&gt; really don&#39;t want to take a faction hit like that, beside with this one<br/>\n&gt; quest you become a hunted person by two major groups.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s finally here!
