All you<br/>\ncan do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;ve learned that no matter how much I care, some people are<br/>\njust assholes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;ve learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it<br/>\nonly takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;ve learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen<br/>\nminutes. After that, you&#39;d better have a big weenie or huge boobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned that you shouldn&#39;t compare yourself to others -<br/>\nthey are more screwed up than you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned that you can keep puking long after you think<br/>\nyou&#39;re finished.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;ve learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we<br/>\nare celebrities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a<br/>\nrelationship is at first, the passion fades, and there had better<br/>\nbe a lot of money to take its place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned that the people you care most about in life are<br/>\ntaken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never<br/>\ngo away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPass this along to 5 friends...trust me, they&#39;ll appreciate<br/>\nit.
