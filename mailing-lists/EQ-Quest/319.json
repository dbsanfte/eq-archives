I know a lot of sites like this have catches, but this one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worked for me and can work for you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Its easy. You just sign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.getpaid4.com/?soulsmiter\">http://www.getpaid4.com/?soulsmiter</a> and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; open an advertisement bar when you are online.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Up to $30 a month for being online.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Added to that is a % of what people you have referred earn (This is where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lots of money is can be earned).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Surprisingly no limit to how many people you can refer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -The tree of referrals goes down 7 levels!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -This means you get money from the people you refer and the people they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; refer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and so on.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Remember, the internet pays well for advertisement; you might as well take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; advantage of it :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.getpaid4.com/?soulsmiter\">http://www.getpaid4.com/?soulsmiter</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Amazingly, someone I know makes $10,000 a year from his referall network.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is an opportunity that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Want to help promote education?
