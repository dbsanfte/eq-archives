I think that the<br/>\nstaff is useable by a paladin only but I have not confirmed this. I also had<br/>\nprobles with this quest and I thought that it was broken. The text from the<br/>\nWoodworker says that he gives you the staff when you give him the not but I<br/>\ndid not recieve anything . I am not sure what his exact wording was but it<br/>\nwas somthing to the effect he is a staff.... take it and retrieve the needed<br/>\ncomponents. I may be wrong on this but that was my impression so I did not<br/>\nwork on it any further.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\nMushin<br/>\nEnchnater.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Scott Pflanzer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pflanzer@...\">pflanzer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@onelist.com\">EQ-Quest@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@onelist.com\">EQ-Quest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, May 17, 1999 10:21 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ-Quest] List activity?
