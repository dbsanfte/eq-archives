When I turned in my <br/>\nguild note, I received a pike which is a pretty cool weapon and can <br/>\nbe stored in my back slot.  Also I can upgrade this weapon through a <br/>\nseries of quests (similar to the monk headband quests).<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to practice a number of trade skills and immediately noticed <br/>\nmany new items, like 6 new pies, at the local vendor.  There is no <br/>\nrecipe book, so I expect that there is a quest to find the recipes <br/>\nbut I am not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not carried my higher level characters over yet because I have <br/>\nbeen too busy playing my lizard (my all time favorite race).  I have <br/>\nheard of a number of new and interesting items and quests, but <br/>\nnothing I can speak of directly as I haven&#39;t enough information.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a link listing a number of the quests thus far...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/questguide.html\">http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/questguide.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
