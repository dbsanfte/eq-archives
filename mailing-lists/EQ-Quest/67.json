It&#39;s a linear scale.  I built about 40 different throw away<br/>\ncharacters and tested things like STR to ATTK bonus and AGI to AC bonus<br/>\nAND Charisma and pricing.  A Charisma of 74 vs a Char of 70 reached a<br/>\n1-2% savings in price and garnered another 1-2% increase in value of<br/>\ngoods sold.  This doesn&#39;t seem like much but then again, it was only a 4<br/>\npoint difference.  I will build an Enchanter (Max. Char 115) and give<br/>\nhim my two magic items (when I get the second one) to bolster it to 125<br/>\nand see what the difference is then.  Will post results back here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and to make this a valid posting.  I can&#39;t seem to find the note on<br/>\nGnasher (Surefall Glade Quest).  I have killed him three times. <br/>\nHead...yes, note...no.  Any pointers or is this compeletely random?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEryndor of Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
