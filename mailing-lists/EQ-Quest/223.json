Wizards, on the other hand are more<br/>\ntroublesome. Their<br/>\nrapid-kill nuke spells are easily abused. Enchanters are wonderful at<br/>\nstopping that.<br/>\nMesmerize not only scrambles the hate list, it blanks out the record of who<br/>\ndid the most<br/>\ndamage. After a Wizard fires a spell, Mesmerize it, and then whoever does<br/>\nthe most damage<br/>\nout of the REMAINING hit points will get the xp. If you are lucky enough to<br/>\nget a spell<br/>\noff before the Wizard, Charm is most effective. The Wizard usually wastes<br/>\nall his mana<br/>\nbefore he realizes the creature is charmed, and can take NO DAMAGE from him.<br/>\nIf you use<br/>\nthis tactic beware: when the charm expires the creature will hate you like<br/>\nno other.<br/>\nBe ready with your handy Mesmerization, and all is well... You or your party<br/>\nwill get the<br/>\nkill (and xp) while an impotent, mana-drained Wizard has to Meditate for a<br/>\ngood while to<br/>\nrecharge...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very interested in other ways to handle the more frequent nuisance of<br/>\nkill-stealing.<br/>\nAny other tricks/strategies are great ammunition for those of us just trying<br/>\nto have a<br/>\nlittle fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nZirconia<br/>\n15th Lvl<br/>\nHigh Elf Enchantress<br/>\nEci server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
