I had to find the four observatories<br/>\nand get the spare lens from them. One had it stolen from a dark elf<br/>\nrogue, and I have promptly taken it back. One was with some gnome who<br/>\nwas captured by slavers in the mino caves. I&#39;m sure I can get that one<br/>\nback. The other two say to me &quot;Sorry, I have no spare lens, come back<br/>\nin a few weeks&quot;. Can you actually get them to give you spare lens, or<br/>\ndo you simply have to repeatedly get lens from the other places (as<br/>\nthey are stackable).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
