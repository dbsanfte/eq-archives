There were supposed to be certain symbols in various places that were alike, or something... <br/>\n<br/>\nIve noticed in Rathe Mountains is a golden pillar on a half platform with a scarab-like design, that is identical to one in NRo, if it has any significance or is just coincidence.

Not sure<br/>\nwhat it drops, or even if anyone has ever killed it.  Don&#39;t know<br/>\nanything about a clockwork dragon.  On the EQ map there is an area<br/>\ncalled Dragonscale hills just south of Ak&#39;Anon that was probably<br/>\nnever developed.
