Here is the tip/secret... <br/>\nKill lots of things, and don&#39;t die. There was no information that <br/>\nhasn&#39;t been provided someplace else in a better format. Again, the <br/>\nwhole basis for any of the player/class guides was don&#39;t die because <br/>\nit reduces the amount of time that you could be out killing things. <br/>\nIt does not tell where to hunt or at what level.<br/>\n<br/>\n Any bugs/secrets were so old to have already been fixed by Verant. <br/>\nIf you are looking for any specific info on a class/race, your better <br/>\noff posting the question here.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Jim<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@egroups.com\">EQ-Quest@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Rick &quot; &lt;craigba@v...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone ever heard of this EQ Bugs/Secrets web site?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqtotalsecrets.com\">http://www.eqtotalsecrets.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please email me the password if you have it.
