The interesting thing about this quest is<br/>\n&gt; that it is totally random when it occers and the actions and events<br/>\n&gt; going on around you determine when it starts. For every person it is<br/>\n&gt; different. Somtimes you hace to scour the entire countryside and<br/>\n&gt; others times you just have to walk around the corner to complete it<br/>\n&gt; but the reward is probably the greatest for any quest ever.  Every<br/>\n&gt; time this quest starts it puts and end to whatever you are doing but<br/>\n&gt; you can chooses to complete it or not. For some the reward is not<br/>\n&gt; worth the time or difficulty and for others it is so necessary that<br/>\n&gt; will will not be satisfied utill they complete it. What quest is<br/>\n&gt; theis?
