I subsribe to 5 or so onelists and did not get to the other messages<br/>\non this topic.  Thanks all that answered, so my question was already<br/>\nanswered and sorry for the extra email.  I am impressed however though, this<br/>\nlist was so dead I forgot I was on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a quest question though.  I was doing the quest for Cromils<br/>\nremains.  For those of you that don&#39;t know it is a quest acquired in Kaladim<br/>\nand takes you to South Karana to retrieve the remains of a famous dwarf that<br/>\nare held by a putrid skeleton at the undead camp next to the bridge to North<br/>\nkarana.  This is also the camp that spawns Lord Grimrot so careful when<br/>\napproaching it.  If he is there, just come back later.  I finally found a<br/>\nday when he was not and started killing all the putrids.  I am a paladin<br/>\nwith ward undead so I used that to lure them away so that if Grimrot spawned<br/>\nI hopefully would be fighting out of aggro range.  Anyway, my question is<br/>\nthis.  I receive either 6 or 8 sets of individual unmarked &quot;bone chips&quot; that<br/>\nwere all marked lore.  There is no differentiation between them, but they<br/>\nare all the same, but don&#39;t stack.  I have asked in most zones, and scoured<br/>\nthe net for any info but cannot find anything.  I did get cromils remains as<br/>\nthey are marked &quot;dwarf bones&quot; not &quot;bone chips&quot;.  But now i have several<br/>\nslots taken up with these lore items that I don&#39;t know what to do with.  Any<br/>\nhelp would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jeff&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:auskay@...\">auskay@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ok, sounds good, but do you have to keep doing it?
