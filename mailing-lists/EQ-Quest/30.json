There are actually two paladins who appear to be talking and against the wall are many vendors who sell spells. I believe that the building at the top to the left of the teleport gem that leads into the palace is called the temple of divine light. You can get to the ledge from there or you can get up to the ledge from the ground. As you walk into this section of the town walk straigin and do not go up the steps. Instead go to the area where there is a paladin and a man selling cloth. They will be stading close so don&#39;t get this confused with the other woman selling patters and clot goods. Jump up on the rocks behind them and procede onto the ledege. they are towards the man is one of the ones on the right towards the front.<br/>\n <br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\nMushin<br/>\nEnchanter<br/>\n <br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Dark Sharp &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:darksharp@...\">darksharp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard-labbs@...\">wizard-labbs@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard-labbs@...\">wizard-labbs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Sunday, May 16, 1999 10:22 AM<br/>\n    Subject: Lost Book Quest<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    I am interested in the &quot;lost book&quot; quest but couldn&#39;t find the NPC in Erudin to trigger it.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Please tell me where to find them.
