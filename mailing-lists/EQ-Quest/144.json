I have a lot of people levels 12 - 19 or<br/>\nso. I was going to play an archvillian who demanded a ramson for<br/>\nreturning the guildmaster. That sounded interesting, but also didn&#39;t<br/>\npose much of a challenge since I was going to hold it in Lavastorm.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I got to thinking that the stone guardians in the forest seem to<br/>\ncon black to me. Is there anyway a large group (10+) players could<br/>\ntake on some iron or stone guardians? And, what do they drop so I<br/>\ncould ask for proof of the kill (and I always assume my guildmembers<br/>\nare honest when it comes to loot).<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBen Pocock<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bpocock@...\">bpocock@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.golden.net/~bpocock\">http://www.golden.net/~bpocock</a><br/>\n--------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
