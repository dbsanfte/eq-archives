In fighting him, I was able to loot the<br/>\ntongue(?!?) from the body, but I wasn&#39;t able to find the quest that it<br/>\nbelonged to.  Since then, I&#39;ve heard a rumor that it belongs to a clerics<br/>\nguild quest - probably in Kaladin.  Again this is just a rumor, I haven&#39;t<br/>\nhad a chance to verify it (damn you, George Lucus! =).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pennaggolan, High Elf Wizard of <br/>\nthe Third Circle in Felwithe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
