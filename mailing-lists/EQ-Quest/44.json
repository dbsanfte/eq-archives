Last night I was in Crushbone doing a little orcing and I<br/>\nnoticed a NPC named Rondo down in the slave pits.  This is unusual, as most<br/>\nothe the slaves are simply listed by race (&quot;a woodelf slave&quot;, a dwarven<br/>\nslave&quot;, &quot;a halfling slave&quot;, etc).  Anyway, sometime during a fight he<br/>\njumped me, proclaiming to be a member of the Dwarven Bandits, and I had to<br/>\nwhack him.  When I went to loot the body, there was his tongue. I figured<br/>\nto was too disgusting not to be a quest item, but which quest and where<br/>\ndoes it start?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dan Alexander<br/>\nPennaggolan of Felwithe<br/>\nFaydwer, Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
