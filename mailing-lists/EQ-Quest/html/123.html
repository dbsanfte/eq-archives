<b>Subject:</b> Shackle Keys <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-991819743">Ok, I have found a bunch of shackle keys off of Orc Slavers in Crushbone.  I know that I am supposed to give them to certain sex/race combinations.  I have found two keys that do not belong to any of them though.  They are keys 22 and 23.  It is not Retlon either as he takes key 15.  If anyone knows what I should do with these it would be appreciated.  Thanks<br/>
