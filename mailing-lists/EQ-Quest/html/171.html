<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233449991">Well, this is a reply to a serious matter.. and if you don&#39;t like it then I&#39;d<br/>
best suggest you leave the list.  And if you could see, alot of people have<br/>
been helped by other people with their quest problems.  I am sure someone will<br/>
help you out if you could only be patient enough for that person to reply.<br/>

&gt; Do you perhaps some information about a quest?  I thought this list was<br/>
&gt; about questing, and not about some ramblings that have nothing to do with<br/>
&gt; the topic. </span></blockquote></div>
