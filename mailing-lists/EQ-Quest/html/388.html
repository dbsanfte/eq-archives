To all that really like doing quests, make a vahshir and do the class <br/>
quests.  Lots of fun but also alot of hassles.  For goodness sake, don&#39;t <br/>
make another beastlord, those are a dime a dozen.  How about a warrior <br/>
or a shaman?  If you are on Bertoxx and are playing a vahshir of any <br/>
class drop me an email.<br/>
