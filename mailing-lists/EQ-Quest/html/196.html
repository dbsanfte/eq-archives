<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012271545">Here are two walkthroughs for the soulfire that I have come across, one from<br/>
Holyswords list and the other from EQCheats list. Hope it helps you since it<br/>
will be a while before I get one for my paladin.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;First, basic info.  Soulfire is a Holy Sword.  Zimel&#39;s Blades is the name<br/>
&gt;of a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;quest for this Holy Sword.  The Zimel&#39;s Blades quest is given by the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Female<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Paladin in the Hall of Truth in Freeport.  If you are not from the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Paladin<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;guild in Freeport you may have difficulty starting this quest.  If that<br/>
&gt;is the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;case there are many ways to improve your faction with the Knights of<br/>
&gt;Truth.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;will go in to that later.  There is also some issue about what level you<br/>
&gt;need<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;to be to start the quest.  I started in Freeport, and was able to start<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;quest at first level, and still start it up to 8th.  Since I passed 8th I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>am<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;told I am to experienced to start the quest. Other players of even 12th<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;been told they are not experienced enough. I don&#39;t know what causes this.<br/>
&gt;One<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;last thing before I begin.  This is BY FAR the longest and most complex<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;quest I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;have seen in this game, so this description, while basic, is VERY LONG.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Hail the Female Paladin on the top of the Hall of Truth.  Say something<br/>
&gt;to the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;effect of &quot;I will&quot; and then the test in brackets.  When you say the right<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;thing<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;she will hand you a letter to deliver to a spy the Paladins have in the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Militia.  You are to say &quot;Truth is Good&quot; to this Militia guard and then<br/>
 </span></blockquote>give<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;him the letter. Go through the Militia house until you exit into the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>small<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;grassy area. Right behind the door is a Guard (he is directly to your<br/>
 </span></blockquote>right<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;when you walk into the grassy are and is hidden behind the door so many<br/>
&gt;people<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;miss him the first time).  Walk up to him and hail him.  He will respond,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;which<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;is something guards don&#39;t normally do.  Say &quot;Truth is Good&quot; he will<br/>
 </span></blockquote>respond<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;again.  Give him the letter.  He will give you a note that says Zimel&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Blades<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;on it with a lot of dots.  Leave the Militia building (the guard will be<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;attacked and killed soon after giving you the note) and head to North<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Freeport.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;This is where the quest gets a little screwy.  It is though to be broken,<br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;not so much that you can&#39;t continue it.  Ok, let me explain.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;You are supposed to bring the note back to the Female Paladin.  When you<br/>
&gt;hand<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;it to her you get exp. and faction adjustments.  She tells you she knows<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;nothing of Zimel&#39;s Blades and can&#39;t read the rest of the document, but to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>go<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;talk to someone (she will give you the name) at the Office of the People,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;which<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;is right next door to the Hall of Truth.  She DOES NOT give you the note<br/>
&gt;back,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;which she should because you need it later in the quest. So what do you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;You start the quest over again, and this time you skip the Female<br/>
&gt;Paladin, and<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;bring the note right to the lady at the Office of the People.  She is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;upstairs,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;and if you ask &quot;Who is Zimel&quot; she will give you information that<br/>
&gt;continues the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;quest.  I have been told you can give her the note and she tells you she<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;read it.  I never did this my self but if you do give her the note and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>she<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;doesn&#39;t give it back, you need to get it again.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;What she tells you that is useful is that a Dwarf named Groflah, who owns<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;runs Groflah&#39;s Fine Steel (or something like that) also in North Freeport<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;was a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;friend of Zimel and might have more information. She also tells you that<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Zimel&#39;s Blades is condemned.  You need to do TWO things now.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;First go back to the Female Paladin and tell her &quot;Zimels Blades in<br/>
&gt;condemned&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;(this is where I first got stuck because I tried telling her Zimel&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Blades is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;condemned and that didn&#39;t work)  If you say it right she will tell you a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;little<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;about Soulfire (the first time you hear about it). If you say the wrong<br/>
&gt;thing<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;you won&#39;t get a response.  Just try a combination of Zimel&#39;s, Zimel,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Zimels,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Blades, and Blade until you get it right.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Second, go talk to Groflah.  His shop is very near the Bard guild in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>North<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Freeport.  Go around behind the counter and upstairs.  If you say &quot;Who is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Zimel&quot; he says something like &quot;Zimel, I don&#39;t know what you are talking<br/>
&gt;about.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I won&#39;t talk here&quot;.  Now give him the note.  He will tell give you LOTS<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;information and tell you to meet him in Seafarer&#39;s Roost at night and<br/>
&gt;give him<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the note again for him to decode it.  He DOES give you the note back.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Now comes the waiting game.  Go to Seafarer&#39;s Roost, which is on the<br/>
&gt;docks in<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;East Freeport.  Groflah usually shows up around 3 am, but I have seen him<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;early as 6 pm and as late as 8 am, and he doesn&#39;t show up every night.<br/>
&gt;When he<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;does show up, say &quot;Who is Zimel&quot; and you start to hear the real story.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Give<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;him the note and he will decode it giving you even more information.  Now<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;know that Zimel is missing, he probably is the ONLY one who knows where<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Soulfire is, and  both Lucan (the Fallen Paladin who leads the corrupt<br/>
&gt;militia<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;in Freeport) and Peitro Zarn (the head of the Shadow Knight guild in<br/>
&gt;Freeport)<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;are looking for this sword, and are probably working together.  You are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>also<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;led to believe that the sword is a Holy Sword because while Peitro Zarn<br/>
&gt;had it<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;in his possession at one time, he could not yield it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;While you were in Seafarer&#39;s Roost waiting for Groflah, you probably<br/>
 </span></blockquote>noticed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;many NPCs coming and going at all hours.  One NPC, a drunk named Tykar<br/>
&gt;Renlin,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;holds the next piece of the puzzle.  He usually shows up around 1 AM.  If<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;hail him and say &quot;Who is Zimel&quot; he will tell you that he knows Zimel and<br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;love to talk to him.  Tykar Renlin also tells you he is thirsty and would<br/>
&gt;like<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;a drink first.  You need to give Tykar Renlin 4 Drom&#39;s Champagnes.  These<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;should be purchasable from the bartender.  They are Lore items, so you<br/>
&gt;need to<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;give him one at a time.  Once you give him 4 he will give you a Blanket<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;(also a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;lore item) and tell you that Zimel is a prisoner locked in a cell below<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Arena.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Give Zimel the three things he wants: Bog juice, edible goo and his<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;blanket. One at a time, in that order.  Bog Juice is made by mixing 1<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Bottle + 1 Flask of Water + 1 Snake Scales.  Zimel gives you a key marked<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;H.K. 102. Go to Highkeep, give the BANK clerk the key after hailing her.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;She gives you a letter to give to Brother Hayle, a captive in Splitpaw<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;dungeon. Give him the note,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;which he will give back to you. Ask him about the &quot;proof of Nobility&quot; and<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;he will tell you that he wants the Hilt of Soulfire, which is on a SK<br/>
 </span></blockquote>troll<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;named Xicotl in Mistmoore castle guest room, a sword of faith from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Freeport<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;and a Testimony of truth, along with the returned note as proof nobility.<br/>
&gt;&gt;You get the Brilliant Sword of Faith from killing Sir Lucan in the Militia<br/>
&gt;&gt;House of West Freeport.  He&#39;s a level 48 mob, and for how tough he is to<br/>
&gt;&gt;kill the sword is a joke.<br/>
&gt;&gt;When you kill him, you get his testimony and bring it back to the Hall of<br/>
&gt;&gt;Truth, where you are rewarded with a very crappy sword for all your<br/>
 </span></blockquote>trouble.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;You need very good faction with the Knights of Tunare to talk with brother<br/>
&gt;&gt;Hayle. Hayle will then give you Soulfire.  It looks just like the flaming<br/>
&gt;sword that Aradune (Brad McQuaid&#39;s) character uses.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Stats are reportedly:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;2 H slashing<br/>
&gt;&gt;no drop<br/>
&gt;&gt;damage 28<br/>
&gt;&gt;delay  45<br/>
&gt;&gt;+7 str/+7 wis<br/>
&gt;&gt;effect: complete heal (5 charges)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is the entire Soulfire quest, the way I understand it:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Get the note from Kalatrina in the Hall of Truth, top level.<br/>
2.  Go to the spy, tell him &#39;Truth is good&#39;, and then give him the<br/>
letter.<br/>
3.  After the Guard kills him, take his note and you are supposed to<br/>
give it to her, but she doesn&#39;t hand it back to you, so skip this part<br/>
of the quest.  She noramlly tells you to go to<br/>
the Office of the People and speak with the woman there, but I&#39;m<br/>
telling you right now.<br/>
4.  At the Office of the People, you are again supposed to give her the<br/>
note, but she also doesn&#39;t give it back.  Simply tell her &quot;Who is<br/>
Zimel?&#39;, and she will tell you about Groflah, and<br/>
that Zimel&#39;s Blades in condemned.<br/>
5.  First, go to the Hall of Truth, and tell Kalatrina that &#39;Zimels<br/>
Baldes is condemned.&#39;.  I believe this is where you first hear about<br/>
Soulfire (or is it the time you give it to her the<br/>
first time, I haven&#39;t done this part in a while).<br/>
6.  Now, go to Groflah&#39;s Forge, and ask him &#39;Who is Zimel?&#39;.  He will<br/>
give you a negative response, and then give him the Zimel&#39;s Blades<br/>
note.  He will tell you to meet him in the<br/>
Seafarer&#39;s Roost.<br/>
7.  Go to the Seafarer&#39;s Roost (at the docks in East Freeport), and<br/>
wait for Groflah to show up.  He is usually there at 3 am, but it&#39;s<br/>
fairly ramdom.  When he shows, again ask him &#39;Who is<br/>
Zimel?&#39;, and he&#39;ll tell you about he&#39;s buddies with old Zimel.  Now<br/>
give him the note, and he&#39;ll decode it for you.  It says &#39;H E L P  C A<br/>
P T I V E&#39;, on it, implying that the prisoner<br/>
under the arena is Zimel (as we suspected for some time).<br/>
8.  While waiting at the Seafarer&#39;s Roost, do NOT go AFK, as you will<br/>
miss a crucial part of the quest.  Randomly a drunk named Tykar Renlin<br/>
will show up, and will cuss out Captain Lucan<br/>
when a bard sings a song about him.  He also says that Lucan imprisoned<br/>
him and his buddy, old Zimel.  Ask him &#39;Who is Zimel?&#39; and he will ask<br/>
you for a drink.  Give him 4 Drom&#39;s<br/>
Champagnes, and he will give you a blanket called &#39;Bunker Cell #2&#39; (I<br/>
think, but it&#39;s not important what it&#39;s called).<br/>
9.  Go to the prisoner under the Arena.  Hail him, and ask him &#39;Who is<br/>
Zimel?&#39;.  He will &#39;Stare deeply into your eyes&#39;, and say nothing.  Ask<br/>
him &#39;Where is Soulfire?&#39;, and he&#39;ll ramble<br/>
something along the lines of &#39;Bog n Goo!!  Freezing!!  Hungry!!<br/>
Thirsty too!!&#39;.  This implies that he needs two items.<br/>
10.  Go kill some snakes and get a few Snake Scales off them.  Put them<br/>
in a brew barrel with a bottle, and a flask of water.  This will give<br/>
you &#39;Bog Juice&#39;, one of the items that Zimel<br/>
asks for (Bog n Goo;  this is the Bog, now for the Goo...)<br/>
11.  Get some Fire Beetle Eyes (if you don&#39;t know where to get these,<br/>
you don&#39;t deserve Soulfire), and Rat ears, and put them into an oven.<br/>
You get &#39;Edible Goo&#39;, which Zimel also asks for<br/>
(This is the Goo part...)<br/>
12.  Give the &#39;Bunker Cell #2&#39;, the &#39;Bog Juice&#39;, and the &#39;Edible Goo&#39;<br/>
to Zimel.  He gives you a key called H.K. 102, and he mutters something<br/>
about Tunaria&#39;s Corridor.  If you&#39;ve done the<br/>
Princess Quest in High Keep, you know what to do...<br/>
13.  Take the Key to High Keep (located in Highpass Hold;  this is the<br/>
narrow pass between Qeynos and Freeport, and the coninent used to be<br/>
called Tunaria, hence, Tunaria&#39;s Corridor).  Give<br/>
the key to the Clerk in the bank, that&#39;s it.  You get a note from Hayle<br/>
Mool, addressed to Zimel.  It tells you to come get him in Qeynos, but<br/>
if you&#39;ve been there before, you know he&#39;s<br/>
being held in Splitpaw...<br/>
14.  In Splitpaw, find him (don&#39;t ask...) and give him the note.  He<br/>
will tell you something I forgot already, but then you ask him &#39;What is<br/>
the Proof of Nobility?&#39;.  He will tell you that<br/>
he requires the note you gave him, The Brilliant Sword of Faith, the<br/>
Glowing Sword Hilt, and the Testimony of Truth (some of which are<br/>
sub-quests, explained below).<br/>
15.  At this point, I HAVE NOT given him the items, at least in the<br/>
correct manner (long story, and rather embarassing;  I&#39;d perfer if you<br/>
didn&#39;t ask...).  If you give the items one at a<br/>
time, I have heard (though this is not confirmed) he will hand you over<br/>
the Soulfire!  Congrats, you should have the blade if you&#39;re smarter<br/>
than I am!<br/>
<br/>
THE TEST OF TRUTH<br/>
<br/>
This is also started in the Hall of Truth, and may not be started after<br/>
level 8.  This is a very simple quest, so I will not explain it here...<br/>
<br/>
THE BRILLIANT SWORD OF FAITH<br/>
<br/>
1.  Speak with the Paladin Guild Master at the top of the Hall of<br/>
Truth, and ask him everything pertaining to killing Lucan D&#39;lere.<br/>
2.  Once you have gotten the quest, assemble a team of TONS of level 45<br/>
plus people, because Captain Lucan is the badass leader of the Warrior<br/>
Guild in Freeport, and the head of the<br/>
Freeport Militia.  He&#39;s level 48, so make sure you&#39;ve got PLENTY of<br/>
time to spend killing him, since he&#39;s TOUGH.  Tonight on my server<br/>
(Rodcet Nife) a group of about 20 level 40+ people<br/>
LOST to this bugger, and only killed him after dying three or four<br/>
times each.<br/>
3.  If you get his Testimony from him (which rarely spawns, God knows<br/>
why...), return it to the man who gave you the quest, and he forks over<br/>
the Brilliant Sword of Faith.<br/>
<br/>
GLOWING SWORD HILT<br/>
<br/>
This is gained off a Shadow Knight in Mistmoore named Xicotl.  I am not<br/>
sure, but I think it spawns every time, and he&#39;s in either the Guest<br/>
House or the Throne Room, if I recall<br/>
correctly.  He&#39;s surrounded by other Shadow Knights and Necros, so be<br/>
prepared for another tough battle (though not as tough as the bloodbath<br/>
when you fight Lucan, that&#39;s just BRUTAL).  I<br/>
should point out that whenever this guy gets pulled, the whole zone<br/>
clears, so be warned...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my take on Soulfire, correct me if I&#39;m wrong...  But I&#39;m not.  :<br/>
