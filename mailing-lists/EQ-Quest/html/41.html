<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069575932">I read this list and have a quest question? :)<br/>
<br/>
I am working on the lost book quest -- this one is going ok right now<br/>
<br/>
but the quest that I am having a hard time with is the peacekeeper staff<br/>
quest<br/>
the question I have is can a Magi use the Peacekeeper Staff?<br/>
if this staff is not usable by the Magi Classes then I will abandon the<br/>
quest due to the fact that I have not found one of the items needed to<br/>
complete the quest.<br/>
