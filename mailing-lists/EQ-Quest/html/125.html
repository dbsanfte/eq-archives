<div id="ygrps-yiv-743167186">I know I have posted this before, but I am hoping somebody else may have<br/>
some further input into this small Paladin Quest.<br/>
<br/>
One of the people in the Temple of Life mentions that a wolf named<br/>
&quot;Frostbite&quot; has killed one of the sacred fish and the body must be<br/>
recovered. The wolf is said to come to the temple with a local barbarian.<br/>
<br/>
I have found frostbite in a nearby fishing village, but no sign of the<br/>
fish. Attacking him brings out the local barbarians with swords in hand,<br/>
and if you DO manage to kill the wolf there is no fish to be found in his<br/>
belly (he only gives up a pelt).<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t lure him away from the camp, as he is standing in a fenced area. <br/>
<br/>
Has anybody else taken this quest? Have any of you been able to solve the<br/>
quest? This one seems broken or maybe I&#39;m just missing something.<br/>
<br/>
