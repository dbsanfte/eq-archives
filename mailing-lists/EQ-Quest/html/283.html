<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174038135">No one looted the sword. I was in the beta, and it was unlootable, everyone<br/>
could go to the body and loot at the weapon, but no one could get the<br/>
weapon.<br/>
<br/>
if you look at the EQVault archives, you will see that it was stated that<br/>
the sword WAS in game, but as a result that no one in any of the servers had<br/>
the sword they [Verant] decided that the quest must have been too hard so<br/>
they are going to redesign the quest to make the sword more accessable.<br/>
<br/>
guess your facts just needed a little refining :)<br/>

&gt;One piece about the below is false.  On the final day in beta, the Gods<br/>

&gt;2. THE FIERY AVENGER<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;FACT: Aradune once wielded a weapon called the Fiery Avenger that looked<br/>

&gt;anyone but Aradune EVER wielded a Fiery Avenger. The Fiery Avenger is a two<br/>
