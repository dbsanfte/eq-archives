    SSSSSCCCCCCRRREEEEEEECCCCCCHHHH!  Hold up, is there a way to stop<br/>
or limit Kill stealing?  I have never heard any of this.  Then, I am a<br/>
melee and am getting used to losing all my kills and buying from the<br/>
wizzie who stole from me.  I am a level 23 paladin and would really<br/>
like to keep a kill.  Been trying for a PGT, which is a complete waste<br/>
of my time, since most time is spent sitting.  Then both times i get a<br/>
shot at the muck, a druid pops out of invis to steal the kill... 2<br/>
druids 2 different times.  Is there a way for me to prevent this?  I<br/>
just need a weapon to wield, and don&#39;t like Everauction.  I started on<br/>
the PvP server, not teams, and guess what... there is not kill<br/>
stealing there.  But short of replaying my 23 levels again, is there<br/>
another way???  Please tell me if so.  Lost the PGT 2 times, the<br/>
chance at BBC about 9 times, the BIBS 6 times, the SBH way over 10<br/>
times.... this is getting old.  For some reason it is usually a gnome<br/>
(any class), a druid, or a wizard.<br/>

It&#39;s very easy actually. Get a level 20 magician, wizard or enchanter<br/>
to group with you. That&#39;s right... group. I guarantee you will have<br/>
quite some success.<br/>
<br/>
See, all those kill stealers wait for you to engage the monster before<br/>
firing away. This makes it so they don&#39;t have to root it. You group<br/>
wizard or magician can do over 145 points of damage on a single shot.<br/>
Make sure you time it so you can engate the creature once he starts<br/>
casting. If a kill stealer fires off a spell after this happens, it&#39;s<br/>
very sweet. You group caster will be able to do more damage, even if<br/>
he is much lower level, because he will have a second opportunity to<br/>
burn before the kill stealer does.<br/>
<br/>
You need help acquiring an item, but it is generally considered good<br/>
manners to help the caster aquire his items too. In many situations, a<br/>
caster has a very difficult time in getting items unless the monster<br/>
in question is very very green unless he kill steals it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you can probably get a caster or two to join you if you go for<br/>
two spawns of the PGT instead of just camping for yours and then<br/>
leaving.<br/>
<br/>
I know you may not want to deal with this. But, the fact of the matter<br/>
is, if a caster needs to get an item, often the best way is to go for<br/>
something like the PGT which they can get easily and then sell it so<br/>
they can buy what they can&#39;t get in more difficult situations.<br/>
