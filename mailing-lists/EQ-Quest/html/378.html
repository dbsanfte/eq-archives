<br/>
I hope you are having fun.  What server are you on?  I am on Bristlebane <br/>
if you are on that one you can look me up.<br/>
<br/>
There are quite a few advice websites out there  the best ones are <br/>
www.eqtraders.com   and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">http://everquest.allakhazam.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Those will lead you to other sites if they don&#39;t answer any questions <br/>
you have.  <br/>
<br/>
General Advice:  Keep all those useless items.  All spider and <br/>
spiderling silk, all bones, all bat wings, all fish scales.  All are <br/>
usable for other things.  Silks are used in tailoring, bones are used by <br/>
necros i think, bat wings have many uses, fish scales are used in spell <br/>
casting.  If you are going to use them yourself, those items can be kept <br/>
in stacks of up to 20 and sold to other players.  My all time high was <br/>
when I got 20 pp for a stack of bones but that is rare, more likely to <br/>
get 4-7 for those.<br/>
I could go on and on about such item: pelts, belts, shoulderpads, all <br/>
items have a use just have to figure it out.  Eqtraders has a <br/>
comprehensive list of  how to use items and where to find what you need.<br/>
