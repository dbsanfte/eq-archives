know of Eruds tonic. Hopefully my next post on this topic will provide great<br/>
insight into this quest.<br/>

&gt;I went west a while ago to sell items....well a friend requested 2 items<br/>
&gt;if I could pick them up for him. They are for a quest for a Bartender&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Book in Freeport. Two of the items are a Kolandi (sp?) fish from Temple<br/>
&gt;of Life in Qeynos (found that, loved the faction hit didnt know you<br/>
&gt;could p/o a Diety) the other was Erud&#39;s Tonic now that&#39;s where I dead<br/>
&gt;end. Supposedly it&#39;s sold at a merchant in Erudian, well I checked every<br/>
&gt;single merchant on the isle (and had Erudians check the ones who<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t talk to me) and none sold it (Side Note: Picked up Innorukk&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Kiss of Death, Lore Item, any ideas what it&#39;s for?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Four NPCs talk about Erud&#39;s Tonic...One is Mordoor (something) a Erudian<br/>
&gt;near Crow&#39;s in Qeynos, he says he&#39;s sick and needs Erud&#39;s Tonic which<br/>
&gt;supposedly is sold in Erudian according to him (side note: to poison him<br/>
&gt;is a different quest), Second NPC is (something) Bluehawk in Bluehawk&#39;s<br/>
&gt;in Erudian, he says Erud&#39;s Tonic is not for travelers, even to Erudites,<br/>
&gt;the Third NPC is the Bookworm (forget name, she will say bookworm when<br/>
&gt;hailed) in the Library in Erudian, she says Erud&#39;s Tonic should not be<br/>
&gt;spoken of,......and last but not least there the Gnome in the Erudian<br/>
&gt;jail, ask him and he says, he did not know you could not leave Erudian<br/>
&gt;with Erud&#39;s Tonic and please get him out of jail. Now my ultimate<br/>
&gt;decision maybe to kill the Gnome maybe he still has it on him but I<br/>
&gt;really don&#39;t want to take a faction hit like that, beside with this one<br/>
&gt;quest you become a hunted person by two major groups.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
