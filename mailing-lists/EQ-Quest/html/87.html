&gt; quest I have ever been on. The interesting thing about this quest is<br/>
&gt; that it is totally random when it occers and the actions and events<br/>
&gt; going on around you determine when it starts. For every person it is<br/>
&gt; different. Somtimes you hace to scour the entire countryside and<br/>
&gt; others times you just have to walk around the corner to complete it<br/>
&gt; but the reward is probably the greatest for any quest ever.  Every<br/>
&gt; time this quest starts it puts and end to whatever you are doing but<br/>
&gt; you can chooses to complete it or not. For some the reward is not<br/>
&gt; worth the time or difficulty and for others it is so necessary that<br/>
&gt; will will not be satisfied utill they complete it. What quest is<br/>
&gt; theis? MushinEnchanter. </span></blockquote></div>
