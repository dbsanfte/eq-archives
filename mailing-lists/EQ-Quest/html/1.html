<b>Subject:</b> Very upset....Need help w/ Quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-529370137">I (and many of my EQ friends) are finding ourselves very frustrated with query responses to NPCs.<br/>
<br/>
It is almost impossible to get an NPC to respond becuase the correct words in regards to their prompts are extremely non-intutive.<br/>
<br/>
For example playing a LVL7 Wizard out of Erudin.<br/>
<br/>
A quest with the Paladins for a poachers.<br/>
<br/>
I say Hail to the Janlin Sklar (or something like that)<br/>
<br/>
He says a bunch of mumbo jumbo with the words (protect the peace) in brackets.<br/>
<br/>
So naturally I say:<br/>
<br/>
Protect the Peace?<br/>
How can I protect the peace?<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Every variation I can think...<br/>
<br/>
Nothing...all I get is I have not proven myself to the Temple yet...eh?<br/>
<br/>
HELP!!!</div>
