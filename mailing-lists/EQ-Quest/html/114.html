<b>Subject:</b> The &quot;Frostbite&quot; quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285419847">Has anyone been able to complete the &quot;Frostbite&quot; quest?<br/>
<br/>
In the Paladin temple one of the guards complains that a wolf named<br/>
&quot;Frostbite&quot; has stolen one of the sacred fish. Your quest is to locate the<br/>
wolf recover the body of the fish.<br/>
<br/>
Locating the wolf is simple enough as he is the pet of one of the barbarian<br/>
fishing villages, but getting the fish from him is another matter.<br/>
Attacking him brings the local barbarians out after you and usually results<br/>
in death. Killing him gives a pelt, but no fish. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone know how to recover the fish without getting a village of barbaians<br/>
after you?<br/>
<br/>
