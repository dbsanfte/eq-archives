<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828614146">The best way I have found to prevent KS&#39;ers is to play dead. Being a Monk, I<br/>
have the ability to play dead. So when those nasty Wiz&#39;s come forth and nuke<br/>
a MOB I&#39;m on, I just Feign Death (if Im in a party I tell them to back off).<br/>
Presto! The MOB ignores me and chases that Wiz down. It&#39;s fun to watch them<br/>
go from nuker to ROOT&#39;er. Hehe.  Usually the would be KS&#39;er leaves.<br/>
<br/>
The life of a Monk is sooo much fun.<br/>
