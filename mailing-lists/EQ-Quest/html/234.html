<b>Subject:</b> Tounge quest in Kaladim..and Pegleg&#39;s Leg <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-658885489">I was wondering if anybody knew the details on either one of these quests. <br/>
When I give the guy neer the mines in Kaladim the tounges..he just <br/>
sais..something about what are these?..well..im keeping them..or something <br/>
like that, but nothing happens.  Do i need to give him certain tounges or <br/>
what?  everybody in Kaladim judges me warmly or amiably, but I can&#39;t get him <br/>
to talk anymore about the quest.<br/>
<br/>
Also,<br/>
I have been running around with Pegleg&#39;s leg for a while..It is starting to <br/>
smell...could someone give me some info on this quest?<br/>
