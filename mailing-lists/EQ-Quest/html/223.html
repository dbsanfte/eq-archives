<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-270892392">In my experience, the Enchanters in the game are the very best at preventing<br/>
kill-theft.<br/>
Most Classes are easy to stop.. Wizards, on the other hand are more<br/>
troublesome. Their<br/>
rapid-kill nuke spells are easily abused. Enchanters are wonderful at<br/>
stopping that.<br/>
Mesmerize not only scrambles the hate list, it blanks out the record of who<br/>
did the most<br/>
damage. After a Wizard fires a spell, Mesmerize it, and then whoever does<br/>
the most damage<br/>
out of the REMAINING hit points will get the xp. If you are lucky enough to<br/>
get a spell<br/>
off before the Wizard, Charm is most effective. The Wizard usually wastes<br/>
all his mana<br/>
before he realizes the creature is charmed, and can take NO DAMAGE from him.<br/>
If you use<br/>
this tactic beware: when the charm expires the creature will hate you like<br/>
no other.<br/>
Be ready with your handy Mesmerization, and all is well... You or your party<br/>
will get the<br/>
kill (and xp) while an impotent, mana-drained Wizard has to Meditate for a<br/>
good while to<br/>
recharge...<br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in other ways to handle the more frequent nuisance of<br/>
kill-stealing.<br/>
Any other tricks/strategies are great ammunition for those of us just trying<br/>
to have a<br/>
little fun.<br/>
