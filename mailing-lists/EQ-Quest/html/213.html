<b>Subject:</b> Re: Kill Stealing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521132739">SSSSSCCCCCCRRREEEEEEECCCCCCHHHH!  Hold up, is there a way to stop or limit Kill stealing?  I have never heard any of this.  Then, I am a melee and am getting used to losing all my kills and buying from the wizzie who stole from me.  I am a level 23 paladin and would really like to keep a kill.  Been trying for a PGT, which is a complete waste of my time, since most time is spent sitting.  Then both times i get a shot at the muck, a druid pops out of invis to steal the kill... 2 druids 2 different times.  Is there a way for me to prevent this?  I just need a weapon to wield, and don&#39;t like Everauction.  I started on the PvP server, not teams, and guess what... there is not kill stealing there.  But short of replaying my 23 levels again, is there another way???  Please tell me if so.  Lost the PGT 2 times, the chance at BBC about 9 times, the BIBS 6 times, the SBH way over 10 times.... this is getting old.  For some reason it is usually a gnome (any class), a druid, or a wizard. :-(  And I am helpless to do anything about it.  <br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks<br/>

        I remember about a week ago, someone mentioned using the spell cancel magic <br/>
        to prevent kill stealing. Does anybody know more about this, or have had any <br/>
        exp with this.  The trade window trick someone gave me seems to work ok, but <br/>
        I would love more tactics. <br/>

    Works better  With pillage or nullify .. but basic when ever they come in sight .. you dispel them ..  dispelling sow while there Pulling past you .. while there barely alive and the only thing holding them together are buffs.. <br/>
    I personally used this IN CT  when We were camping the tae and This mid 20&#39;s group with one higher level Who Couldn&#39;t stand up to the Throne room  keep pulling the tae out past us after doing nothing but Sitting hidden/invs outa eh way for it  , were were clearing it and consatly fighting ..  so They pull take to much . There higher level wizard 34+ at least  would nuke tae they&#39;d Loot and Zone,  Got all my group member killed at one time or another ..  so Every time one of them Walk into the room ,  Dispelled nuked .. that was after they tried to pull the tae from us again ..and we  hit him with pillage ,( wipes all Enchantments or spells off person....  the puller went down in about 10 seconds <br/>
<br/>
    we had given them tells before and all that Blah blah ..  they Told us to basically  Mind our own .. and they could pull what they wanted ..when they wanted ... hmm ok .. pull all ya want .. <br/>
<br/>
    Dispelling RES Magic and Sow off a Puller is Not a Nice thing to do ... but when they deserve it ..  ( BTW we used  Golem wands from the Steel to make sure we did a good job) <br/>
