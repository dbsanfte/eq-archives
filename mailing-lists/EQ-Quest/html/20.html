<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002275907">While the priest of discord is about - switching from a blue to red is easy.<br/>
<br/>
A /petition as it might undo a mistake, doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
allow one to go back to PK-.<br/>
<br/>
While I have asked around both ingame and out, there <br/>
was hint of a quest to restore one&#39;s Blue status.<br/>
BTW: I still have my Tome in hand should a GM consider<br/>
the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short - A cleric can&#39;t HEAL or COURAGE since <br/>
Blue&#39;s have protection from _all_ PK+ Spells.<br/>
<br/>
Offensive vs &quot;helpful&quot; I can understand, but it makes less <br/>
since when a Party of Blues has a Red spell slinger.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>
