<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569775970">Was runnin around in CB splittin orc skulls left and right and I cam across <br/>
this weird book. I think its some kind of magic thing but I dont know about <br/>
stuff like that, I just slash orcs and leave the mumbo jumbo to others. But <br/>
this weird book has gotten my attention and it looks realy important, I dont <br/>
understand this at all.<br/>
<br/>
Any of you do?<br/>
