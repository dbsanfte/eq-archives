<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062033429">Hiya All and Well Met,<br/>
    I was out wandering the woods about Crushbone the other day and got into <br/>
a wee bit of a fight with a slaver.... bad luck for him!  When the dust <br/>
cleared, I was left with some decent coin.... and this little key for shackle <br/>
17.... anyone have any idea what it can be used for? Sure looks interesting <br/>
to me..... <br/>
                                Thank ye in advance for any of yer good <br/>
thinking on this!<br/>
