Subject: Charisma and it&#39;s Effect on Buying and Selling<br/>
<br/>
Charisma most DEFINITELY has an effect on buying and selling.  Even one<br/>
point.  It&#39;s a linear scale.  I built about 40 different throw away<br/>
characters and tested things like STR to ATTK bonus and AGI to AC bonus<br/>
AND Charisma and pricing.  A Charisma of 74 vs a Char of 70 reached a<br/>
1-2% savings in price and garnered another 1-2% increase in value of<br/>
goods sold.  This doesn&#39;t seem like much but then again, it was only a 4<br/>
point difference.  I will build an Enchanter (Max. Char 115) and give<br/>
him my two magic items (when I get the second one) to bolster it to 125<br/>
and see what the difference is then.  Will post results back here.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and to make this a valid posting.  I can&#39;t seem to find the note on<br/>
Gnasher (Surefall Glade Quest).  I have killed him three times.<br/>
Head...yes, note...no.  Any pointers or is this compeletely random?<br/>
