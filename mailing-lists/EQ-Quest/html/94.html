<b>Subject:</b> Lens Quest from Akanon in Library <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-15274472">OK, I got a lens quest in Akanon. I had to find the four observatories<br/>
and get the spare lens from them. One had it stolen from a dark elf<br/>
rogue, and I have promptly taken it back. One was with some gnome who<br/>
was captured by slavers in the mino caves. I&#39;m sure I can get that one<br/>
back. The other two say to me &quot;Sorry, I have no spare lens, come back<br/>
in a few weeks&quot;. Can you actually get them to give you spare lens, or<br/>
do you simply have to repeatedly get lens from the other places (as<br/>
they are stackable).</div>
