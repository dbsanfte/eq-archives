<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018134317">you may have the quest mixed up, there are 2 separate quests, involving the<br/>
lenses, 1 in which you will get the observers staff,  don&#39;t be confused on<br/>
the quests and make sure you are following the right one,<br/>

&gt; OK, I got a lens quest in Akanon. I had to find the four observatories<br/>
&gt; and get the spare lens from them. One had it stolen from a dark elf<br/>
&gt; rogue, and I have promptly taken it back. One was with some gnome who<br/>
&gt; was captured by slavers in the mino caves. I&#39;m sure I can get that one<br/>
&gt; back. The other two say to me &quot;Sorry, I have no spare lens, come back<br/>
&gt; in a few weeks&quot;. Can you actually get them to give you spare lens, or<br/>
&gt; do you simply have to repeatedly get lens from the other places (as<br/>
&gt; they are stackable).<br/>
