<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-322789167">I have been talking to the npc&#39;s in the ...... roost, (forget the first <br/>
name), it is in east freeport above the rogue guild. I was just buying some <br/>
alcohol from the npc barkeep there and some de came up and started talking to <br/>
the de Scar that spawns there sometime. I asked her what she was doing. She <br/>
told me that she heard you could play cards with him. But he says nuthing <br/>
when you hail him. I&#39;ve tried many phrases but none work. Anyone now about <br/>
this or any other quest in the ....... roost?</div>
