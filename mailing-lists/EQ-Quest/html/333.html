<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331630197">Well, I have only a newly created Iksar Warrior.  When I turned in my <br/>
guild note, I received a pike which is a pretty cool weapon and can <br/>
be stored in my back slot.  Also I can upgrade this weapon through a <br/>
series of quests (similar to the monk headband quests).<br/>
<br/>
I like to practice a number of trade skills and immediately noticed <br/>
many new items, like 6 new pies, at the local vendor.  There is no <br/>
recipe book, so I expect that there is a quest to find the recipes <br/>
but I am not sure.<br/>
<br/>
I have not carried my higher level characters over yet because I have <br/>
been too busy playing my lizard (my all time favorite race).  I have <br/>
heard of a number of new and interesting items and quests, but <br/>
nothing I can speak of directly as I haven&#39;t enough information.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link listing a number of the quests thus far...<br/>
