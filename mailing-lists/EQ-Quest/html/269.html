<b>Subject:</b> [EQ] Mysteries of Norrath <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-353349217">Once someone sent me a URL for an EQ bulletin board/discussion forum that contained a thread on Mysteries of Norrath. Focusing on the wall pictures that are the same in various places.<br/>
<br/>
I lost the url, does anyone have it or recall where this thread was? I found another thread called Myths and Mysteries of Norrath that included the Fiery Avenger, Sea Serpent, clockwork dragon in its initial post... this was interesting too, but not the one I recall reading.<br/>
<br/>
Please help?<br/>
