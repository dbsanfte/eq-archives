<div id="ygrps-yiv-635778193">i am here!<br/>
<br/>
my question pertains to a dwarven quest.  i tried talking to an npc in <br/>
kaladim and he woudln&#39;t speak to me unless i killed some dwarven bandits.  <br/>
this i did (and they were VERY tough!) and he gave me quest to kill rats in <br/>
the mines.  now, is it just me or are rats way too weak for someone who can <br/>
kill the bandits to hunt?  also i have been in the mines and they seem quite <br/>
small and i have seen no rats.  does anyone know if there are parts to the <br/>
mine i&#39;m not finding?  it just seems like 1 circular tunnel.  thanks in <br/>
advance for any advice!<br/>
