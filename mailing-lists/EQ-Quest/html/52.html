<b>Subject:</b> Peace Keeper Staffs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088265065">As far as I can tell the staff is not useable by a Mage. I think that the<br/>
staff is useable by a paladin only but I have not confirmed this. I also had<br/>
probles with this quest and I thought that it was broken. The text from the<br/>
Woodworker says that he gives you the staff when you give him the not but I<br/>
did not recieve anything . I am not sure what his exact wording was but it<br/>
was somthing to the effect he is a staff.... take it and retrieve the needed<br/>
components. I may be wrong on this but that was my impression so I did not<br/>
work on it any further.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think.<br/>

&gt;I read this list and have a quest question? :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am working on the lost book quest -- this one is going ok right now<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;but the quest that I am having a hard time with is the peacekeeper staff<br/>
&gt;quest<br/>
&gt;the question I have is can a Magi use the Peacekeeper Staff?<br/>
&gt;if this staff is not usable by the Magi Classes then I will abandon the<br/>
&gt;quest due to the fact that I have not found one of the items needed to<br/>
&gt;complete the quest.<br/>
