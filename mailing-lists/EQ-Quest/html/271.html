MYTHS AND MYSTERIES OF NORRATH<br/>
by Myth Searcher<br/>
 <br/>
There are many mysteries and myths in Norrath and though they may never be Solved... but they sure do make an one hell of an interesting conversation... giving the following facts I would like to hear opinions of players on these Everquest Mysteries.<br/>
<br/>
1. SEA MONSTER IN LAKE RATHE<br/>
<br/>
Fact: There at one time in Everquest was a extremely high level &quot;Seamonster&quot; in Lake Rathe. REMEMBER ALL OF THE ABOVE IS PROVEN TO BE TRUE.<br/>
<br/>
Unproven Information: The Creature in Lake Rathe was a Large Serpent called a &quot;Leviathan&quot; or &quot;Kraken&quot;. It is found in the deepest parts of the Lake and is GIGANTIC. It may still be hidden in the Game, or as most belive it was removed from the game due to a pathing problem. It has also been rumored to be removed from the Game and replaced with another mob of equal level. REMEMBER ALL OF THE ABOVE IS UNPROVEN!<br/>
<br/>
2. THE FIERY AVENGER<br/>
<br/>
FACT: Aradune once wielded a weapon called the Fiery Avenger that looked like a Flaming Sword. The Sword had been looted off of Aradune by a player in the Arena after a PvP event in the final phases of beta. This the ONLY confirmed time anyone but Aradune EVER wielded a Fiery Avenger. The Fiery Avenger is a two handed slash weapon with very good damage and delay, and a Direct Damage effect. REMEMBER ALL OF THE ABOVE IS PROVEN TO BE TRUE.<br/>
<br/>
UNPROVEN INFORMATION: In the Final Phases of Beta Mithaniel Marr the god was also rumored to drop a Fiery Avenger. The Fiery Avenger is also said to also be obtained though a quest Aradune himself has created... the quest is supposed to be the hardest quest in the game. There have been many rumors of the quest but all have been hoaxes so far. Rumors of the quest are that it has to do with &quot;Killing Norrath&#39;s Dragons&quot; and &quot;It starts with a small favor&quot;.. (these quotes are Rumored to come form Aradune). REMEMBER ALL OF THE ABOVE IS UNPROVEN!<br/>
<br/>
3. THE CLOCKWORK DRAGON<br/>
<br/>
FACT: There are Dragon Bones in the Steamfont Mountains. There is a tale from a gnome in An&#39;kanon telling a Dragon Saving The gnomes. REMEMBER ALL OF THE ABOVE HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE TRUE.<br/>
<br/>
UNPROVEN INFORMATION: There is a further more in-depth story from another Gnome in An&#39;kanon That tells of a Dragon that once saved the Gnomes and was nearly killed in the process. The Gnomes used their Clockwork technology to save the Dragon by turning him into a Clockwork Dragon to repay it for saving them. Over time the Dragon went Rogue and King An&#39;Kanon sealed the Clockwork under An&#39;kanon forever. In rumor there is supposed to be a another complete zone adjecent to An&#39;Kanon that the Dragon is in. No one has found the Dragon yet if it is even there. REMEMBER ALL OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION IS UNPROVEN!<br/>
<br/>
4.LORD MAYONG MISTMOORE<br/>
<br/>
FACT: There is a extremely high level Vampire Lord that was in Mistmoore at one time. He only spawns during night. You can lose faction with Lord Mayong Mistmoore by doing Bard quests in Kelethin. REMEMBER THE ABOVE INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE TRUE.<br/>
<br/>
UNPROVEN INFORMATION: Lord Mayong Mistmoore was a level 53 Vampire and the only non-stationary level 53 in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Some say he was removed from the game due to bugs with his spawn and that he would often leave the tower he spawned in and go on rampant killing sprees. Some say that he is still in the game it is just that he has a Triggered spawn. He is rumored to drop the Skull-Fanged Stilleto (Even though most people know the Skull-Fanged Stilleto came from Kedge Keep in Beta), and some other nice SK weapons. REMEMBER THIS INFORMATION IS UNPROVEN!<br/>
<br/>
IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION DEALING WITH LORD MAYONG MISTMOORE PLEASE POST IT. SCREENSHOTS OF THIS VILE VAMPIRE WANTED!<br/>
<br/>
5. THE OCEAN OF TEARS BEAST<br/>
<br/>
FACT: There is a sea creature of high level that was once in the oot. This beast is not the Aliewasuar thing (sorry about spelling), it is a completely seperate beast. REMEMBER ALL OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE TRUE.<br/>
<br/>
UNPROVEN INFORMATION: Rangers have picked up this beast on thier tracking and it is supposedly called a Medalodon. It is supposed to be a large prehistoric shark creature. Other rumors say this beast is a &quot;Sea Dragon&quot;. REMEMBER ALL OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION IS UNPROVEN!<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.. I WOULD LIKE SOME FEEDBACK ON THESE MYSTERIES AS WELL AS PLAYERS ADDING IN ONES OF THEIR OWN THEY HAVE FOUND.<br/>

You could also add the Fire Door in Neriak to the list. Supposedly this is a teleport to Greater Faydark. Also, there is a bookshelf in neriak (3rd Gate) that looks to be a door. --Wyth, Wood Elf warrior of Tunare<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The day Hate opened my guild searched frantically for the entrance, we knew that there was a gate spell, but being the first day we did not know where to buy that what we dubbed &quot;hate stones&quot; that are needed to cast the spell. So the 30(around there) of us started combing ALL of Norrath looking for the stones or the entrance, one of our druids stumbled upon what seemed to be a new zone entrance in solA, he said there used to be a big stone wall there and now there wasn&#39;t, I&#39;m not sure if he tried to zone through it or not, but if he did then he got &quot;safety ported&quot;(my term) like what happened to you when you tried to zone into solA before it was in the game or if you try to zone into solA now without doing the optional download and downloading the zone. Just something to think about. --Kelsi 44th druid of bristlebane, Arch Overseers<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I formed 2 groups once on Tarrew Marr to go kill this sea serpent thing, he was not there, we searched the entire ocean with nothing, I recently bought a fishbone earing and explored the underwater areas of Lake Rathe, there is no sea serpent, there are a few sharks, some fish, and a bunch of goblins in a tower in a cave, these goblins all conned blue to me at level 42. There was no serpent and from what I have heard (from various people) that he has not been seen since beta. It is my suspicion that he was removed due to the fact that this is a newbie zone and people were probably killed by him too frequently just trying to swim to a different island. As for OOT, I&#39;ve yet to explore it (I do plan on doing it this week so I&#39;ll let you know how it goes.) As for NPCs apearing on ranger tracking.. unless they see him for all they know the NPC could just be some merchant who is usually too far out for tracking... --Beels<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mistmoore WAS in the game. A guy I work with has a Fang Skull Stiletto that him and his buddies got of MM himself. And whats the deal with the Fire Doors in Neriak? --Locie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was Megalodon in Lake Rathe. It was a screenshot from Beta. I remember seeing it as well. --Scelestus<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, Mithaniel Marr WAS looted after getting owned by Innoruuk(bwuhahaha) on the last day of Beta. They had the screenshot on EQvault. If memory serves me correctly, Fiery Avenger was 35/55, all/all, two-handed and casts Inferno Shock. Also, Megalodon is NOT the Lake Rathe monster(Rathey??=)), he is in OOT. It is kraken-and they have a screenshot of him in the Lake Rathe section at Everlore.com. Mayong supposedly went on a rampage on one of the servers on Nov. 28th-27th-form what I have heard, you have to do something outside of Mistmoore to make him spawn, possibly the entire mail quest. --Executor Scelestus of Black Sun<br/>
<br/>
Does the Clockwork Dragon by chance have anything to do with those bones in the form of a dragon near the city? The one with skeles guarding it. --Kamen <br/>
<br/>
One more mystery... the Sphinx&#39;s in the Rathe Mountains, what is there purpose... I could never figure out, anyone know what&#39;s up with the good/evil sphinx&#39;s? I&#39;ve heard rumors of a high level quest. --Follo<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;screenshot&quot; of the Krakken is a fake. Read the enrties below the screenshot. Everything about the picture is wrong. Just look close. --Blade<br/>
<br/>
That pic of the Kraken does look slightly dodgy, however a good friend of mine Phobus level 50 Erudite Paladin on Tunare was playing his twink in Lake rathe when shouts went up that kraken was killing people on shore, this was about 3 weeks ago now. He called in his guild Talisman all high levels who all turned up to kill it and could&#39;nt find anything. This has now become a running joke on Tunare, and anyone who plays high level character there will probably have heard this story. --Stormsoul<br/>
<br/>
Mayong has been turned off because he was exploited somehow, there was a way to kill him without getting killed. --Shannow 50 wizard tunare (Talisman)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it was true-to-life or if it was an effect of being up at oh...4:00 AM, but &#39;bout mid-summer i had a warrior char on E&#39;ci named Mr.cookie, and I had just gotten some cool armor...oh well, nuff of that. I was on the boat heading to Faydwer and I was playing around with the controls for the camera and moved around....and fell off. I did the usualshout-and-scream-for-mercy-from-the-gods-thing and then I saw it.. It was near the bottom of the sea (oot) and it looked like a HUGE, hiary worm that moves fairly slowly and I was scared shitless and was afraiad of it, and of course the natural instinct was to run away, which I did, and subsequently (whatever, don&#39;t ask me to spell) I did not con it or whatever...and then I drown and I saw it again swimming away. and I say again, i don&#39;t know if it was just my late-night cravings of eq, orthe real thing, but I belive this is the famed OOT monster. --Folcwine<br/>

Subject: [EQ-Quest] [EQ] Mysteries of Norrath<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From: &quot;PHAEDRA WHITLOCK&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:PWHITLOCK@...">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once someone sent me a URL for an EQ bulletin board/discussion forum that<br/>
contained a thread on Mysteries of Norrath. Focusing on the wall pictures<br/>
that are the same in various places.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I lost the url, does anyone have it or recall where this thread was? I<br/>
found another thread called Myths and Mysteries of Norrath that included the<br/>
Fiery Avenger, Sea Serpent, clockwork dragon in its initial post... this was<br/>
interesting too, but not the one I recall reading.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please help?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
