anyone caught using a known &#39;bug&#39; or taking advantage of any &#39;bug&#39; to<br/>
advance their experience, position or wealth are subject to immediate<br/>
banishment.  That means the Gods will turn off your account - permanently.<br/>
If anyone on this list had any clue or knowledge of active &#39;bugs&#39; in the<br/>
game they sure wouldn&#39;t talk about it in an open forum such as this.  You<br/>
should take a few minutes and actually read that &quot;I accept&quot; form you have to<br/>
click past every time you log into the game.  And Stookey, your probably a<br/>
nice person but you really need to chill. &lt;grin&gt;  I bet everyone who reads<br/>
this list has wanted to ask that same question but just in different terms<br/>
at one time during the beginning of their days.  Heck, I always wanted to<br/>
know how I could get &#39;tweaked&#39; until I found out that you had to know<br/>
someone and realized I didn&#39;t know anyone more than 2 levels above me.<br/>

&gt; There is that one bug where you kill a bunch of monsters and get exp,<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; than that maybe you should pull your thumb out of your ass and go play the<br/>
&gt; game and stop looking for the easy way out.  Jackass.<br/>

&gt; Can anyone tell me if they know of any bugs in EQ? I need exp to gain<br/>
&gt; a couple of levels to get new spells. Thanks, I appreciate it.<br/>
