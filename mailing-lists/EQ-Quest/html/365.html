<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-393696084">There is one quest for Dark Elves in Lodge of the Dead where this guy <br/>
want&#39;s you to kill a Paladin names Sir Lindeal in Lavastorm. Well I <br/>
have looked all over for this guy and I cannot find him. Does anyone <br/>
know his location or where he spawns? I&#39;ve heard rumors that he will <br/>
only spawn when there are people camping the Shadowed men, is this <br/>
true? man, I really really can&#39;t find this guy and I have been all <br/>
over Lavastorm! Some help please!<br/>
Another thing, do you have to do this quest before you do Reaper of <br/>
the Dead quest? I know the same guy gives out both of these.<br/>
