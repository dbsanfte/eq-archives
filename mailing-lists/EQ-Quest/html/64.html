    Really?  Where did you find books that you could read in Erudin?<br/>

    When the people we love are stolen from us, the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them.  Buildings burn, people die, but real love is forever.  -- The Crow<br/>
        I then remember a book that I read in the Erudin library that told of how to make scarecrows. Currently I do not know how these events tie together but I am sure that this quest will be quite interesting and will shed some light on where scarecrows come from.</div>
