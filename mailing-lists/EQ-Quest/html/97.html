&gt; i am here!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; my question pertains to a dwarven quest.  i tried talking to an npc in<br/>
&gt; kaladim and he woudln&#39;t speak to me unless i killed some dwarven bandits.<br/>
&gt; this i did (and they were VERY tough!) and he gave me quest to kill rats in<br/>
&gt; the mines.  now, is it just me or are rats way too weak for someone who can<br/>
&gt; kill the bandits to hunt?  also i have been in the mines and they seem quite<br/>
&gt; small and i have seen no rats.  does anyone know if there are parts to the<br/>
&gt; mine i&#39;m not finding?  it just seems like 1 circular tunnel.  thanks in<br/>
&gt; advance for any advice!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Look for a mechanical rat Cleaner VII if I remember correctly, then bring it to<br/>
that NPC.<br/>
I think he will give you more of the quest instructions then, something about a<br/>
blacksmith<br/>
I believe.<br/>
