<div id="ygrps-yiv-274568722">Hi Tiny,<br/>
<br/>
EQ will take over your life run while you still can, MMMWWWAAAAHAAAAHAAA  <br/>
Seriously, welcome to the fabulous world of EQ and I hope you can <br/>
explore the whole of Norrath eventually.<br/>
There are many places to get info on quests.  The best seems to be <br/>
www.allakhazam.com  You can get a quest list by zone or item on that <br/>
one, I like it.  Don&#39;t try to do a search--it&#39;s only for thier premium <br/>
members but all the content is accessible without paying just have to go <br/>
differently.<br/>
<br/>
Another site you should check out is eqtraders.com  They have info on <br/>
all of the tradeskills and what to do with all the &#39;useless&#39; batwings <br/>
and fish and other stuff I sold to merchants when I first started.  Fire <br/>
up your printer and print out as much of that site as it will print.<br/>
<br/>
A third site you may want to check out is everlore.com  They have info <br/>
on all classes, advice on playing the class etc.<br/>
<br/>
For maps, allakhazam has most of them and check out eqmaps.com  Don&#39;t <br/>
forget to buy some printer ink before you start on these LOL<br/>
There are alot of zones on Norrath and you will want to have maps of <br/>
almost every zone you go to so you don&#39;t get lost.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get discouraged, there are quests for newbies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What server do you play on?  <br/>
Have fun and don&#39;t lose too many corpses to decay<br/>

&gt; I´m quite new at this Everquest thing...I´m just a 9th level paladin.<br/>
&gt; I´m looking for new quests but haven´t been able to find ANY quests<br/>
&gt; easy enough for a newbie to take on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope someone can help me out.<br/>
