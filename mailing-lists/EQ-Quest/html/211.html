<b>Subject:</b> Kill Stealing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828513170">I remember about a week ago, someone mentioned using the spell cancel magic <br/>
to prevent kill stealing. Does anybody know more about this, or have had any <br/>
exp with this.  The trade window trick someone gave me seems to work ok, but <br/>
I would love more tactics.<br/>
