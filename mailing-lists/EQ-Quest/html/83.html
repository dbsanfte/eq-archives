<b>Subject:</b> Leaterfoot cap and Erud&#39;s Tonic <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-715771682">For Erud&#39;s Tonic check out the eq_brewers list on<br/>
one-list for a run down on how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
What I need to know about the Leatherfoot Raider&#39;s <br/>
cap is what to say to the Marshal.  I completed<br/>
the squad ring quest, the little guys regard me<br/>
warmly, I just don&#39;t know what to say to the<br/>
Marshal.<br/>
<br/>
After I hail him, he says something about<br/>
petitioning.  I say &quot;i am petitioning&quot; and then<br/>
he says he the head of the [Leatherfoot Raiders].<br/>
It is at this point that I am stuck, because<br/>
he will only a &quot;what&quot; style of question which<br/>
does not initiate the quest and I&#39;ve tried saying<br/>
things like &quot;i want to join the leatherfoot<br/>
raiders&quot;.<br/>
