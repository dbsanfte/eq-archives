<b>Subject:</b> Re: what trade window tactic? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-424900419">Well...here&#39;s how it works..you know how when you trade with someone the <br/>
window comes up...you can&#39;t do anything else while its up..so you get one of <br/>
your group members or buddies to keep bringing up a trade window as soon as <br/>
the baddie spawns. I&#39;ll give you an example..<br/>
<br/>
Im up on trainer mountain trying for the Shiny Brass Shield..I&#39;m all by <br/>
myself...I kill him couple of times..no shield..couple of people wander up <br/>
and we agree to rotate...we do this for about an hour when this mage comes <br/>
up..i inform him that the 4 of us have agreed to rotate to elimnate any hard <br/>
feelings..he informs me there is no rules or rotating and he will kill him <br/>
all he wants..I inform mage&#39;boy that i will do whatever it takes to prevent <br/>
this including not playing fair. He tells me to go do something to <br/>
myself...It was someone elses turn for the trainer..so as soon as he spawned <br/>
i start trading crushbone belts to him...he cant get off but one spell, <br/>
cause i was a little slow with the mouse...the guy got his kill and the mage <br/>
left pissed...heheh..vengence was ours..<br/>
<br/>
I say let them ban me...i refuse to let kill stealers ruin a good time.  I <br/>
figure the worst they can do the first time is give me a warning and I have <br/>
yet to even get that...the fact is they can turn off their trade <br/>
window...but at least this gives you some ammo...<br/>
<br/>
good luck<br/>
