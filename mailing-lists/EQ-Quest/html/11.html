<div id="ygrps-yiv-23978605">Every named NPC in Everquest belongs to a faction, or group of beings.  You<br/>
as an individual (race, class, charisma, religion) and by your actions (what<br/>
you hunt, the quests you do) affect your standing with every faction.<br/>
<br/>
You should pay attention to what the paladin says.  He told you that you<br/>
have not proven yourself to the temple.  That means he doesn&#39;t trust you,<br/>
and isn&#39;t going to say another word until you improve your faction with the<br/>
Temple.<br/>
<br/>
Go out and kill things till you see a faction adjustment that lists that<br/>
particular temple.  Then go out of your way to beat that particular critter<br/>
type up.  After ten or so kills, go back and check and see if he&#39;ll trust<br/>
you further.  If not, and you really want to help him out, go out and<br/>
continue the slaughter.  Eventually he&#39;ll tell you how you can help.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware that if you are a different race, class and/or religion, this might<br/>
take a whole lot of effort.<br/>

&lt;&lt;A quest with the Paladins for a poachers.<br/>
<br/>
I say Hail to the Janlin Sklar (or something like that)<br/>
<br/>
He says a bunch of mumbo jumbo with the words (protect the peace) in<br/>
brackets.<br/>
<br/>
So naturally I say:<br/>
<br/>
Protect the Peace?<br/>
How can I protect the peace?<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Every variation I can think...<br/>
<br/>
Nothing...all I get is I have not proven myself to the Temple yet...eh?<br/>
