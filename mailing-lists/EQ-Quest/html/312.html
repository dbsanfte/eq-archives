<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528044928">Can you sell to Murissa in NRo by the EFreeport zone? Or Rathmana in SRo?<br/>
<br/>
A rogue trick I was told recently when I started a rogue is, hide sneak, go behind them, then if successful they con indifferent and you can sell. Otherwise there is no merchant who will sell to me. Try it with your Hide ability?<br/>
<br/>
I dont know Neriak, but in Freeport you can get merchant faction by doing Janam Rebby Frikniller quests, and as mentioned elsewhere, scalps in HH. The slaves in Crushbone also improve merchant factions with the race of the slave you free.<br/>

Speaking of faction problems.<br/>
<br/>
I am a Dark ELf in Neriak who cannot buy/seel to any<br/>
merchants.  I killed Ratraz to many times.  I was told<br/>
to give red wine to some guy, but since my faction is<br/>
already so low, he won&#39;t help me...<br/>
any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Also I got an Ogre friend that killed to many Dark<br/>
Elves in duels and now isn&#39;t allowed past the first<br/>
zone in Neriak...<br/>
any ideas?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; list and <br/>
&gt; see what happens.<br/>
&gt; 	Some time ago, I had a friend who screwed up and<br/>
&gt; became KOS <br/>
&gt; in Freeport.  I looked all over in an effort to find<br/>
&gt; something that <br/>
&gt; would help his faction and came up with donuts.  I<br/>
&gt; remember that one <br/>
&gt; of the things that was suggested was to go to HH<br/>
&gt; Pass and kill Orcs, <br/>
&gt; for that would help his faction.  At the time, this<br/>
&gt; did not seem to <br/>
&gt; do the trick.<br/>
&gt; 	Well, I don&#39;t know if my friend just didn&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; what to do, <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t do it enough, or if the thing just didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; work then, but I can <br/>
&gt; now say for sure that killing both HH orcs and HH<br/>
&gt; gnolls will help, <br/>
&gt; but the BIG payoff is running their scalps to the<br/>
&gt; local guard <br/>
&gt; captains.  Give them a single scalp and you will get<br/>
&gt; exp as well as <br/>
&gt; faction gains for several different hard to modify<br/>
&gt; groups - including <br/>
&gt; the Freeport Militia.  The beauty of this one is<br/>
&gt; that there are no <br/>
&gt; faction losses, as are most of the other +Militia<br/>
&gt; quests of which I <br/>
&gt; know.  You also get between 1 and 6 gold pieces for<br/>
&gt; doing this, so <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s good for a reasonable chunk of change as well. <br/>
&gt; I turned in <br/>
&gt; about 25 of the scalps and went from apprehensive to<br/>
&gt; indifferent.<br/>
