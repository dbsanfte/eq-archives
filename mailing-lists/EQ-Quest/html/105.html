<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311965528">All I know is this.   During Beta, someone was running around with a<br/>
staff like the one the priest of discord carries.  When asked about it,<br/>
h said it was a combination of the skull of whosamawhatsit (sp?) and<br/>
the runed totem staff.  Anyone heard of this quest?  It is supposed to<br/>
be an awsome staff.  The skull in itself is pretty cool, but I really<br/>
want the look of that staff.  DOesn&#39;t it just seem like the perfect<br/>
thing for a Dark elf cleric to haul around with him?<br/>
