<div id="ygrps-yiv-694125911">Anyone who received this message from Jimmy Lind, please do not read it, if<br/>
you have read it and opened the happy99 program, congratulations you now<br/>
have a WORM program, this program is fairly harmless, except that every<br/>
email you send will have this happy99.exe program attached to it.  You need<br/>
to get rid of it immediately.<br/>
<br/>
For further information on this WORM, please go to www.symantec.com, Norton<br/>
has a complete description of how to remove this program from your machine.<br/>
You do not need an anti-virus program to remove it.  Just follow their<br/>
directions and it&#39;s gone for good.<br/>
<br/>
As for you Jimmy, I hope this was accidental, because sending out these kind<br/>
of programs intentially is 1) A felony, 2) For stupid, and morally wrong, 3)<br/>
Will get you blacklisted from just about every mailing list there is.<br/>
