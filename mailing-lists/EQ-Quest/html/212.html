&lt;p&gt;I remember about a week ago, someone mentioned using the spell cancel<br/>
magic<br/>
&lt;br&gt;to prevent kill stealing. Does anybody know more about this, or have<br/>
had any<br/>
&lt;br&gt;exp with this.&nbsp; The trade window trick someone gave me seems to<br/>
work ok, but<br/>
&lt;br&gt;I would love more tactics.<br/>
&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>

Works better&nbsp; With pillage or nullify .. but basic when ever they<br/>
come in sight .. you dispel them ..&nbsp; dispelling sow while there Pulling<br/>
past you .. while there barely alive and the only thing holding them together<br/>
are buffs..<br/>
&lt;p&gt;I personally used this IN CT&nbsp; when We were camping the tae and<br/>
This mid 20&#39;s group with one higher level Who Couldn&#39;t stand up to the<br/>
Throne room&nbsp; keep pulling the tae out past us after doing nothing<br/>
but Sitting hidden/invs outa eh way for it&nbsp; , were were clearing it<br/>
and consatly fighting ..&nbsp; so They pull take to much . There higher<br/>
level wizard 34+ at least&nbsp; would nuke tae they&#39;d Loot and Zone,&nbsp;<br/>
Got all my group member killed at one time or another ..&nbsp; so Every<br/>
time one of them Walk into the room ,&nbsp; Dispelled nuked .. that was<br/>
after they tried to pull the tae from us again ..and we&nbsp; hit him with<br/>
pillage ,( wipes all Enchantments or spells off person....&nbsp; the puller<br/>
went down in about 10 seconds<br/>
&lt;p&gt;we had given them tells before and all that Blah blah ..&nbsp; they<br/>
Told us to basically&nbsp; Mind our own .. and they could pull what they<br/>
wanted ..when they wanted ... hmm ok .. pull all ya want ..<br/>
&lt;p&gt;Dispelling RES Magic and Sow off a Puller is Not a Nice thing to do<br/>
... but when they deserve it ..&nbsp; ( BTW we used&nbsp; Golem wands from<br/>
the Steel to make sure we did a good job)<br/>
