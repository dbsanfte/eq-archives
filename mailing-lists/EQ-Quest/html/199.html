<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844254862">Trial of a Murderer<br/>
by Mushin<br/>
This event will involve the Murder of another character, the subsequent man<br/>
hunt for the accused man, and eventually a trial to determine the mans<br/>
innocents.  Currently the event is in the preliminary stages of planning.<br/>
<br/>
The Event Coordinator is looking for people to fill the following positions.<br/>
<br/>
Victim: You must be willing to have you Character killed (only once) and may<br/>
loose an item and money. This is because you will not know when the attack<br/>
will happen. We are hoping to have several possible victims to give the<br/>
murderer a variety and to ensure that the killing happens randomly when you<br/>
are not expecting it. However you will be free to fight back and are allowed<br/>
to defend yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Murderer/Assassin: Your job will be to kill one of the possible victims. You<br/>
will not know where they are and will only have their Names.  Should you<br/>
fail in your attempt to kill the victim you are to attempt the murder of<br/>
another name on the list. Once you are successful you are to loot the body<br/>
and take one item. You must keep this item on you character and can not sell<br/>
or give it away.<br/>
<br/>
Lynch Mob: The Members of the Lynch mob will be required to track down the<br/>
Murderer and return them to the scene of the crime for Trail. There will be<br/>
no limit on the number of people in the Lynch Mob<br/>
<br/>
Jury:<br/>
The Jurors will decide the Guilt or Innocence of the Murderer. We are hoping<br/>
for a Panel of at least 6 Jurors. (you are allowed to create a low level<br/>
character to act as a juror specifically for this event.<br/>
