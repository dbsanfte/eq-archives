&lt;&lt;  I receive either 6 or 8 sets of individual unmarked &quot;bone chips&quot; that<br/>
 were all marked lore.  There is no differentiation between them, but they<br/>
 are all the same, but don&#39;t stack.  I have asked in most zones, and scoured<br/>
 the net for any info but cannot find anything.  I did get cromils remains as<br/>
 they are marked &quot;dwarf bones&quot; not &quot;bone chips&quot;.  But now i have several<br/>
 slots taken up with these lore items that I don&#39;t know what to do with. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too :( No idea what to do with them.<br/>
