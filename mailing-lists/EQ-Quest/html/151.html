&gt; you have to follow the guard around on his whole patrol the card by BB is<br/>
&gt; the first one he drops ... and he doesn&#39;t drop the last until he gets back<br/>
&gt; to the guard tower... which he never does without a little help from use<br/>
&gt; friendly PC&#39;s due to his incedible wimpyness and burning desire to kill<br/>
&gt; everythig in sight... thus you have to following him around the whole way..<br/>
&gt; killing evrything he attacks and picking up after him...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck<br/>
