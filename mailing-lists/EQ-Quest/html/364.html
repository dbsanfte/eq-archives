<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-224993349">Hi everyone I play on Saryrn server and while running my 35 druid <br/>
through I believe it was commons yesterday I found a bag on the <br/>
ground picked it up and it is called an empty pouch. It holds 6 TINY <br/>
items and it is lore and has a combine button. It also says Weight <br/>
Redustion: 0%......I looked online can&#39;t find any info so if anyone <br/>
can tell me anything about this bag(what its used for to combine) I <br/>
would appreciate it.<br/>
Thank you ;)<br/>
