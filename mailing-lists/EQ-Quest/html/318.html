<div id="ygrps-yiv-20232910">Well, I&#39;ll post a warning again.. the next person to advertise a advertising ad<br/>
will be banned from the list (it is just common sense), I mean this isn&#39;t a<br/>
advertising list it is a EverQuest Quest helping list.. though I don&#39;t really<br/>
see anything wrong with advertising it yet if you put down your referrel code<br/>
then poof gone from the list and that is that..<br/>

&gt; Please ban this guy and stop the spam.  Isn&#39;t this advertising?  Isn&#39;t that<br/>
&gt; against this list&#39;s purpose?<br/>

&gt; Subject: Interesting Concept...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I&#39;ve found an intriguing new method for making money simply for being<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; your computer. I know a lot of sites like this have catches, but this one<br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; worked for me and can work for you.<br/>
&gt;     Its easy. You just sign up at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.getpaid4.com/?soulsmiter">http://www.getpaid4.com/?soulsmiter</a> and<br/>
&gt; open an advertisement bar when you are online.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -Up to $30 a month for being online.<br/>
&gt; -Added to that is a % of what people you have referred earn (This is where<br/>
&gt; lots of money is can be earned).<br/>
&gt; -Surprisingly no limit to how many people you can refer.<br/>
&gt; -The tree of referrals goes down 7 levels!<br/>
&gt; -This means you get money from the people you refer and the people they<br/>
&gt; refer<br/>
&gt; and so on.<br/>
&gt; -Remember, the internet pays well for advertisement; you might as well take<br/>
&gt; advantage of it :)<br/>

&gt; Amazingly, someone I know makes $10,000 a year from his referall network.<br/>
&gt; This is an opportunity that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked.<br/>
