<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124647568">They said those who had ordered before the cut-off date (I forget just<br/>
what date that was since I orderd my RoK much later) and who hadn&#39;t<br/>
received it by the 24th when they &quot;opened&quot; Kunark would get a free<br/>
month on their account.  I believe they also stated they would not<br/>
charge shipping.  None of this gets your game to you any quicker, but<br/>
at least they&#39;re not saying &quot;tough, deal with it&quot;.  :o/  It should all<br/>
be in the EQNews log somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
