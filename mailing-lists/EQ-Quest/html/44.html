<b>Subject:</b> Rondo&#39;s tongue? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387357920">Hi there.  Last night I was in Crushbone doing a little orcing and I<br/>
noticed a NPC named Rondo down in the slave pits.  This is unusual, as most<br/>
othe the slaves are simply listed by race (&quot;a woodelf slave&quot;, a dwarven<br/>
slave&quot;, &quot;a halfling slave&quot;, etc).  Anyway, sometime during a fight he<br/>
jumped me, proclaiming to be a member of the Dwarven Bandits, and I had to<br/>
whack him.  When I went to loot the body, there was his tongue. I figured<br/>
to was too disgusting not to be a quest item, but which quest and where<br/>
does it start?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
