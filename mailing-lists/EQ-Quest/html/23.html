<b>Subject:</b> Cornfluks head? a quest? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325099289">I know that since I fight in butcherblock a lot that a lot of people must <br/>
have cornfluks head because in one hour I have killed him twice so I am <br/>
wondering if he is part of any quests any one knows of? also I saw another <br/>
troll named zoobarichi or something like that any maybe he is part of a <br/>
quest? zooba casts and is yellow to me I am level 9 and cornfluk is easy solo <br/>
conning blue to me so maybe you need both of there heads but I am not sure. <br/>
<br/>
Any info would be great...<br/>
