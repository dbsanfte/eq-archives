<div id="ygrps-yiv-798863313">Youre probably right about the reusing textures, I dont recall the thread well, but it started out based on Brad says... when Brad said there were many undiscovered quests still in the game, so the thread was trying to find some, or at least stir up ideas. There were supposed to be certain symbols in various places that were alike, or something... <br/>
<br/>
Ive noticed in Rathe Mountains is a golden pillar on a half platform with a scarab-like design, that is identical to one in NRo, if it has any significance or is just coincidence. But the thread went over things like that.<br/>

Brad verified that the Fiery Avenger quest did not exist.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure about wall pictures.  What do you mean by that?  I suspect the<br/>
artists just got lazy and re-used images.  there is a sea monster in<br/>
Lake Rathe that&#39;s supposed to be rare, and around level 50.  Not sure<br/>
what it drops, or even if anyone has ever killed it.  Don&#39;t know<br/>
anything about a clockwork dragon.  On the EQ map there is an area<br/>
called Dragonscale hills just south of Ak&#39;Anon that was probably<br/>
never developed.  Perhaps there was supposed to be a clockwork dragon<br/>
in this zone?<br/>

Subject: [EQ-Quest] [EQ] Mysteries of Norrath<br/>

<br/>
Once someone sent me a URL for an EQ bulletin board/discussion forum that <br/>
contained a thread on Mysteries of Norrath. Focusing on the wall pictures <br/>
that are the same in various places.<br/>
<br/>
I lost the url, does anyone have it or recall where this thread was? I found <br/>
another thread called Myths and Mysteries of Norrath that included the Fiery <br/>
Avenger, Sea Serpent, clockwork dragon in its initial post... this was <br/>
interesting too, but not the one I recall reading.<br/>
<br/>
Please help?<br/>
