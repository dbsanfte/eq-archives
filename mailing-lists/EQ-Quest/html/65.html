<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042921016">The Odus pearls are never there.  You need Odus pearls from under the sand<br/>
sharks that camp in the water of the Erudin Harbor.  They are items that sit<br/>
right under the sharks.  The problem is that I have not seen any there in<br/>
over a month.  I have petitioned to no avail.<br/>

&gt;I read this list and have a quest question? :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am working on the lost book quest -- this one is going ok right now<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;but the quest that I am having a hard time with is the peacekeeper staff<br/>
&gt;quest<br/>
&gt;the question I have is can a Magi use the Peacekeeper Staff?<br/>
&gt;if this staff is not usable by the Magi Classes then I will abandon the<br/>
&gt;quest due to the fact that I have not found one of the items needed to<br/>
&gt;complete the quest.<br/>
