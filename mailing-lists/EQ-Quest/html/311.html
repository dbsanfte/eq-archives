<b>Subject:</b> I can&#39;t find what quest this item is for...... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944106930">I was in Steamfont and saw something I hadn&#39;t seen before.  A Minotaur Lord.  After killing him I saw he dropped a Broken Minotaur Lord <br/>
Horn.  It&#39;s no drop and lore so I figured it has to be for a quest although I can&#39;t find which one.  Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
