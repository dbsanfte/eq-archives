<b>Subject:</b> Hi, New to the group <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-10287283">I am following a (to me) strange dream/quest. I don&#39;t know the way <br/>
except to break down the dream into goals and the goals into tasks.  <br/>
The tasks into steps.  Is there a better way than groping in the <br/>
dark? or is it just best to keep going and hope the road traveled is <br/>
the right one?  Any help is welcomed, Sam</div>
