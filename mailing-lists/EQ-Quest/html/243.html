<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870979522">Quest is a rogue-type quest. Jeet(?) or one of the rogue dwarves that hang<br/>
out by the bank in kaladim will give you the quest(may be Mater). Anyway<br/>
you turn in 4(four) dunfire tougues which are found, two in the bandit camp<br/>
by orcs in BB, one in bandit camp by goblin warrior camp and one off Rondo<br/>
Dunfire, found in the the slaver area of CrushBone. Dont know what to do<br/>
with Peg&#39;s Leg hehe, have been carrying that one around too.<br/>
<br/>
Best to ye<br/>
