Speaking of faction problems.<br/>
<br/>
I am a Dark ELf in Neriak who cannot buy/seel to any<br/>
merchants.  I killed Ratraz to many times.  I was told<br/>
to give red wine to some guy, but since my faction is<br/>
already so low, he won&#39;t help me...<br/>
any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Also I got an Ogre friend that killed to many Dark<br/>
Elves in duels and now isn&#39;t allowed past the first<br/>
zone in Neriak...<br/>
any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 &gt; see what happens.<br/>
 &gt; 	Some time ago, I had a friend who screwed up and<br/>
 &gt; became KOS<br/>
 &gt; in Freeport.  I looked all over in an effort to find<br/>
 &gt; something that<br/>
 &gt; would help his faction and came up with donuts.  I<br/>
 &gt; remember that one<br/>
 &gt; of the things that was suggested was to go to HH<br/>
 &gt; Pass and kill Orcs,<br/>
 &gt; for that would help his faction.  At the time, this<br/>
 &gt; did not seem to<br/>
 &gt; do the trick.<br/>
 &gt; 	Well, I don&#39;t know if my friend just didn&#39;t know<br/>
 &gt; what to do,<br/>
 &gt; didn&#39;t do it enough, or if the thing just didn&#39;t<br/>
 &gt; work then, but I can<br/>
 &gt; now say for sure that killing both HH orcs and HH<br/>
 &gt; gnolls will help,<br/>
 &gt; but the BIG payoff is running their scalps to the<br/>
 &gt; local guard<br/>
 &gt; captains.  Give them a single scalp and you will get<br/>
 &gt; exp as well as<br/>
 &gt; faction gains for several different hard to modify<br/>
 &gt; groups - including<br/>
 &gt; the Freeport Militia.  The beauty of this one is<br/>
 &gt; that there are no<br/>
 &gt; faction losses, as are most of the other +Militia<br/>
 &gt; quests of which I<br/>
 &gt; know.  You also get between 1 and 6 gold pieces for<br/>
 &gt; doing this, so<br/>
 &gt; it&#39;s good for a reasonable chunk of change as well.<br/>
 &gt; I turned in<br/>
 &gt; about 25 of the scalps and went from apprehensive to<br/>
 &gt; indifferent.<br/>
