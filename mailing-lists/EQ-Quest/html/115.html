Barbarians can get a quest from snowflake.  And in this quest snowflake will<br/>
lead them out to a hole in the ice.  Perhaps if you can get snowflake to<br/>
lead you the hole.  You can stomp him out away from the guards.  Haven&#39;t<br/>
tried this, but maybe it&#39;ll work.<br/>

Has anyone been able to complete the &quot;Frostbite&quot; quest?<br/>
<br/>
In the Paladin temple one of the guards complains that a wolf named<br/>
&quot;Frostbite&quot; has stolen one of the sacred fish. Your quest is to locate the<br/>
wolf recover the body of the fish.<br/>
<br/>
Locating the wolf is simple enough as he is the pet of one of the barbarian<br/>
fishing villages, but getting the fish from him is another matter.<br/>
Attacking him brings the local barbarians out after you and usually results<br/>
in death. Killing him gives a pelt, but no fish.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know how to recover the fish without getting a village of barbaians<br/>
after you?<br/>
