<div id="ygrps-yiv-838112059">I have stumbled into the middle of a quest and I am not sure where it begins but I do have the following information if anyone would like to attempt this one.<br/>
<br/>
While hunting in the scarecrow fields near Qeynos I stumbled across a lore item that was a sack of magical hay. Knowing that the dreded scarcrows lurked near by I didn&#39;t think anything of it. I picked up the sack of Magical Hay and continued on my way. After having it stashed in my band vault for several weeks I had almost forgotten about it untill recently.  My traveles to Highpass Hold looking for the Testament of Vanear led me to the near by city of River Vale. There inside the city I found a shakey scarecrow that is in need of stuffing. I asked a near buy halfling what was wrong with Shakey and he informed me that his head was drying out and that he had lost much of his stuffing. For some strange reason I instanlty felt sorry for poor shakey the scarecrow. I will eventually continue upon this quest and I have pondered over it for some time now. The halfling spoke of visiting a dungeon to get special scarecrow stuffing to make Shakey all better. I then remember a book that I read in the Erudin library that told of how to make scarecrows. Currently I do not know how these events tie together but I am sure that this quest will be quite interesting and will shed some light on where scarecrows come from.<br/>
