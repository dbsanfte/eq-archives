&gt;<br/>
&gt; I (and many of my EQ friends) are finding ourselves very frustrated with query responses to NPCs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is almost impossible to get an NPC to respond becuase the correct words in regards to their prompts are extremely non-intutive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example playing a LVL7 Wizard out of Erudin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A quest with the Paladins for a poachers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I say Hail to the Janlin Sklar (or something like that)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He says a bunch of mumbo jumbo with the words (protect the peace) in brackets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So naturally I say:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Protect the Peace?<br/>
&gt; How can I protect the peace?<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Every variation I can think...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nothing...all I get is I have not proven myself to the Temple yet...eh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; HELP!!!<br/>
