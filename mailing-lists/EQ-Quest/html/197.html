<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-693180502">Soulfire Quest is broken for now, according to Holyswords list. Apparently<br/>
someone was exploiting Lucan and killing him without giving him a chance to<br/>
fight back so Verant<br/>
took him out of the game for now. So you will not be able to get the<br/>
testimony in order to turn it in for the soulfire.</div>
