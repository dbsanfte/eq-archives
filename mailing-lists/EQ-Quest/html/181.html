<div id="ygrps-yiv-387548184">The Sherrif doesn&#39;t give you the ring.  It&#39;s the deputy down stairs in the<br/>
dinning room in the bank.  It&#39;s the deputy standing closest to the stairs.<br/>
You say &quot;Am I one with the wall?&quot;  If you have earned it he will give it to<br/>
you.<br/>
As for recharging, I believe you just give it to the cleric in the cleric<br/>
guild, and it returns to your inventory immediately.  I am not 100% sure on<br/>
the cleric, I just watched a guy fighting Nillipuss do it, I never saw him<br/>
say anything.<br/>
<br/>
You turn the necklaces into the sherrif, and the orc belts into the deputy<br/>
out on the wall in Misty Thicket, you also earn faction for killing those<br/>
orcs and goblins in Misty.  I also hear that completing any quests in this<br/>
zone also gives you faction.  One in particular is to go by polar bear<br/>
cloaks/skins (I forget which one, do the quest and he tells you which one<br/>
you need), and ways, go to Halas, and I believe you can buy these items from<br/>
the vendors or from newbies that are out killing low level monsters.  If you<br/>
fill up your entire inventory with these and bring them back and turn them<br/>
in one at a time (or however many he requested at a time) you earn cash/exp,<br/>
and faction.  I heard that 8 bags full is supposed to be enough, but I don&#39;t<br/>
know anything for sure, this is just what I have read, and heard from people<br/>
that I have met who have this ring.<br/>

&gt; I would appreciate help on the Squad Ring quest the most...It is really<br/>
&gt; ticking me off that the stupid sherrif will not give me the ring...Once<br/>
&gt; I finally do get the ring, can I get it recharged or do I have to go get<br/>
&gt; a new one?  If I can get it recharged, how do I do it?  Im a level 16<br/>
&gt; monk.<br/>
&gt; ---<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I dont think you go to the sheriff to get the ring.  You go to the<br/>
&gt; Marshall.<br/>
