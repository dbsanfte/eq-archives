<div id="ygrps-yiv-708705335">Seems this List is dead so I will start off.<br/>
<br/>
I have been working on a quest that has peaked my attention. I found out about his quest on the first day that I played Ever Quest and I have graduly been working to complete it. So here is some of hte info. I will be rather vague so that I do not spoil it for the rest of you.<br/>
<br/>
Being a new Erudin enchanter I sought out on my fist day to talk to every NPC in the town. One of the most simple tasks I found was to recover a bood from the Library and give it to this paladin. So I walked a little way to the library and asked the Librarian for the &quot;Testament of Vanear&quot; She informend me that it had been lost and told me the last know person who had checked it out. <br/>
<br/>
This began the series of events that has led to my reletless attempts a rcovering a book that at first seemed simple and unimportant. I managed to track down the book in a near by town but once I had the bood I found out that two pages had been ripped out and were missing. This has inturn led to many treks across the continent of Antonica to locate the missing pages. So I travled to the location where I was told that one of the pages were stolen a few hours earlier and that the assailant was nearby. I also found that the other page was being help by a Eruidian. Knowing that I was not quite strong enough to recover the page that had been stonen I headed back across the continent to speak with the man about the page he had in his possesion. After a lucky hand of cards and several gold later I had the book and one of the two pages in possesion. With my curriosity peaked I again set out to locate the person who had the other missing page. Now it has become apparent that this book ties the events in several city together and I can not help but wonder what the book will tell once restored. I now have to kill a band of smugglers and a corrupt city guard before I will be able to restore the book and read it&#39;s contents.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like information on where to find this quest and more of the specifics please let me know. This quest is very interesting and it really creates a chain reaction of events that will keep you interested. (Better than Killing Kobolds all night)<br/>
