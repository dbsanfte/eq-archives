<b>Subject:</b> Stone Guardians <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-691133503">I was trying to make up a guild quest that would be extremely<br/>
challenging to my members. I have a lot of people levels 12 - 19 or<br/>
so. I was going to play an archvillian who demanded a ramson for<br/>
returning the guildmaster. That sounded interesting, but also didn&#39;t<br/>
pose much of a challenge since I was going to hold it in Lavastorm.<br/>
<br/>
So, I got to thinking that the stone guardians in the forest seem to<br/>
con black to me. Is there anyway a large group (10+) players could<br/>
take on some iron or stone guardians? And, what do they drop so I<br/>
could ask for proof of the kill (and I always assume my guildmembers<br/>
are honest when it comes to loot).<br/>
