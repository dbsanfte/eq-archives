<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897676545">The NPC is located on the ledge across from the fountain in in Erudin. There are actually two paladins who appear to be talking and against the wall are many vendors who sell spells. I believe that the building at the top to the left of the teleport gem that leads into the palace is called the temple of divine light. You can get to the ledge from there or you can get up to the ledge from the ground. As you walk into this section of the town walk straigin and do not go up the steps. Instead go to the area where there is a paladin and a man selling cloth. They will be stading close so don&#39;t get this confused with the other woman selling patters and clot goods. Jump up on the rocks behind them and procede onto the ledege. they are towards the man is one of the ones on the right towards the front.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
