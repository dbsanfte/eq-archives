Subject: Interesting Concept...<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;ve found an intriguing new method for making money simply for being<br/>
at<br/>
your computer. I know a lot of sites like this have catches, but this one<br/>
has<br/>
worked for me and can work for you.<br/>
    Its easy. You just sign up at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.getpaid4.com/?soulsmiter">http://www.getpaid4.com/?soulsmiter</a> and<br/>
open an advertisement bar when you are online.<br/>
<br/>
-Up to $30 a month for being online.<br/>
-Added to that is a % of what people you have referred earn (This is where<br/>
lots of money is can be earned).<br/>
-Surprisingly no limit to how many people you can refer.<br/>
-The tree of referrals goes down 7 levels!<br/>
-This means you get money from the people you refer and the people they<br/>
refer<br/>
and so on.<br/>
-Remember, the internet pays well for advertisement; you might as well take<br/>
advantage of it :)<br/>

Amazingly, someone I know makes $10,000 a year from his referall network.<br/>
This is an opportunity that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked.</div>
