<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123300642">Thats SO easy to get around its silly. Go to Options and limit what kind of<br/>
ppl can trade with you, you can make it just group members, or make it so<br/>
that you will not accept trades from anyone. Putting up the trade window is<br/>
not a way at all to a person that knows his options in EQ, take a look<br/>
sometime, you will be better off knowing what you can and cant do.<br/>
the -kinda- best way is cancel magic, but even thats not so hot. he might<br/>
just sit there and wait for the best time to strike, IE: When the critter he<br/>
wants is near half life and then nuke the snot out of it, so there is<br/>
nothing you can do.<br/>
<br/>
one of the better ways was mentioned by Lanadina the Magician, and thats to<br/>
back off. Let the wiz have his cake and then he might either leave, or get<br/>
his ass handed back to him from the ensuing mob. In my personal travels tho,<br/>
the best way to beat a wiz, is with another wiz. if they are close in lvls<br/>
your mage will have the advantage. I have sent many a wiz packing just cuz i<br/>
was faster and better than he was [and after that he offered us an INSANE<br/>
amount of money for the item he wanted].<br/>
<br/>
but most of all, dont immediately go to dirty tactics when you see a wiz,<br/>
talk to him, find out what he wants and see if the option of turns, or a<br/>
line up, or just giving him the item [if none of your group want it] and let<br/>
him be on his way. the easiest method to do is talk IN A CALM AND SENSE-ABLE<br/>
MANNER. there are too many kids out there that just jump to conclusions and<br/>
think that all wizards are KSers and start spamming OOC and generally making<br/>
an ass of themselves. sometimes Wizards dont see you kiting, or behind that<br/>
hill and see a kill like anyother person. Wizs can shoot far so they dont<br/>
have to be near to kill things. sometimes they think you are in trouble and<br/>
just want to help out [for which i have been spammed SO much that i only<br/>
help when asked now]<br/>
<br/>
take it easy, take some vallium, take your time, and HAVE FUN, if this game<br/>
is causing you to have ulcers cuz of shiat like this, then step back, think<br/>
of options, and plan what to do that doesnt resort to you showing the world<br/>
what an immature person you are. [i no there are bad wizards out there, but<br/>
truthfully, its a real LOW percentage that doesnt reflect the avg mentality<br/>
of the wizards in Norrath]<br/>
