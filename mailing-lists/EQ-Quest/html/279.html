<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268858935">One piece about the below is false.  On the final day in beta, the Gods<br/>
themselves waged war, and I believe that everyone was turned to PvP.  This event<br/>
did not happen at the arena.  Aradune was slain protecting Karana.  And I<br/>
believe it was in Nek Forest, but I could have the location wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. THE FIERY AVENGER<br/>
<br/>
FACT: Aradune once wielded a weapon called the Fiery Avenger that looked like a<br/>
Flaming Sword. The Sword had been looted off of Aradune by a player in the Arena<br/>
after a PvP event in the final phases of beta. This the ONLY confirmed time<br/>
anyone but Aradune EVER wielded a Fiery Avenger. The Fiery Avenger is a two<br/>
handed slash weapon with very good damage and delay, and a Direct Damage effect.<br/>
REMEMBER ALL OF THE ABOVE IS PROVEN TO BE TRUE.</div>
