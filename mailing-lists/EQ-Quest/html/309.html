<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-641146705">Well, let&#39;s see what I can contribute to this here list and <br/>
see what happens.<br/>
	Some time ago, I had a friend who screwed up and became KOS <br/>
in Freeport.  I looked all over in an effort to find something that <br/>
would help his faction and came up with donuts.  I remember that one <br/>
of the things that was suggested was to go to HH Pass and kill Orcs, <br/>
for that would help his faction.  At the time, this did not seem to <br/>
do the trick.<br/>
	Well, I don&#39;t know if my friend just didn&#39;t know what to do, <br/>
didn&#39;t do it enough, or if the thing just didn&#39;t work then, but I can <br/>
now say for sure that killing both HH orcs and HH gnolls will help, <br/>
but the BIG payoff is running their scalps to the local guard <br/>
captains.  Give them a single scalp and you will get exp as well as <br/>
faction gains for several different hard to modify groups - including <br/>
the Freeport Militia.  The beauty of this one is that there are no <br/>
faction losses, as are most of the other +Militia quests of which I <br/>
know.  You also get between 1 and 6 gold pieces for doing this, so <br/>
it&#39;s good for a reasonable chunk of change as well.  I turned in <br/>
about 25 of the scalps and went from apprehensive to indifferent.<br/>
