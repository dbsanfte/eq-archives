<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823472842">Brad verified that the Fiery Avenger quest did not exist.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure about wall pictures.  What do you mean by that?  I suspect the<br/>
artists just got lazy and re-used images.  there is a sea monster in<br/>
Lake Rathe that&#39;s supposed to be rare, and around level 50.  Not sure<br/>
what it drops, or even if anyone has ever killed it.  Don&#39;t know<br/>
anything about a clockwork dragon.  On the EQ map there is an area<br/>
called Dragonscale hills just south of Ak&#39;Anon that was probably<br/>
never developed.  Perhaps there was supposed to be a clockwork dragon<br/>
in this zone?<br/>

Subject: [EQ-Quest] [EQ] Mysteries of Norrath<br/>

<br/>
Once someone sent me a URL for an EQ bulletin board/discussion forum that <br/>
contained a thread on Mysteries of Norrath. Focusing on the wall pictures <br/>
that are the same in various places.<br/>
<br/>
I lost the url, does anyone have it or recall where this thread was? I found <br/>
another thread called Myths and Mysteries of Norrath that included the Fiery <br/>
Avenger, Sea Serpent, clockwork dragon in its initial post... this was <br/>
interesting too, but not the one I recall reading.<br/>
<br/>
Please help?<br/>
