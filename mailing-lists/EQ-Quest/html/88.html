<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020132523">I have found the secret to Erud&#39;s Tonic myself and I kick myself because<br/>
I buy all Lore Items (even if I dont know what they are for) So I<br/>
sitting in Greater Faydark with a &quot;kiss&quot;, maybe I&#39;ll drink it ;) BTW I<br/>
am going to find out where this quest leads, I want to turn in the Orges<br/>
head since you dont get a brewing book for the quest.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing Mushin mentions a great and wonderful quest (heck I<br/>
thought I was in the middle of the biggest (think about it, its a Quest,<br/>
that needs a quest reward item, in order to get you need to do 2 quests<br/>
inside of that one and piss off a God, also you need 2 people, because<br/>
could you ever see an Orge in Erudian &quot;kissing the bookworm&quot; or and<br/>
Erudite in the Orge home city?))<br/>
