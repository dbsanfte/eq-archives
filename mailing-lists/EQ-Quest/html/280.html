<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950885562">Actually, Brad said that the quest WAS in the game, but no one had discovered it<br/>
so they were changing it to a different quest.  This new quest for the Fiery<br/>
Avenger is still not in the game.  EQVaut has it all archived if you want to<br/>
read about it.<br/>
<br/>
from a previous post:<br/>
<br/>
Brad verified that the Fiery Avenger quest did not exist.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure about wall pictures.  What do you mean by that?  I suspect the<br/>
artists just got lazy and re-used images.  there is a sea monster in<br/>
Lake Rathe that&#39;s supposed to be rare, and around level 50.  Not sure<br/>
what it drops, or even if anyone has ever killed it.  Don&#39;t know<br/>
anything about a clockwork dragon.  On the EQ map there is an area<br/>
called Dragonscale hills just south of Ak&#39;Anon that was probably<br/>
never developed.  Perhaps there was supposed to be a clockwork dragon<br/>
in this zone?</div>
