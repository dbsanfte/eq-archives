<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546698120">this sounds odly familiar to the Crow&#39;s Nest in Qeynos for the testament of <br/>
vinear quest. You give hime 2gp and he gives you a card. If you get the <br/>
joker card you turn it back into him for 1 of the 2 pages for the testament.<br/>

&gt;I have been talking to the npc&#39;s in the ...... roost, (forget the first<br/>
&gt;name), it is in east freeport above the rogue guild. I was just buying some<br/>
&gt;alcohol from the npc barkeep there and some de came up and started talking <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;the de Scar that spawns there sometime. I asked her what she was doing. She<br/>
&gt;told me that she heard you could play cards with him. But he says nuthing<br/>
&gt;when you hail him. I&#39;ve tried many phrases but none work. Anyone now about<br/>
&gt;this or any other quest in the ....... roost?<br/>
