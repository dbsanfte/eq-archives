<div id="ygrps-yiv-265766320">In Qeynos, I talk to Aenia and her dad and Behroe. I get the ballad from Behroe but then what do I do next? I gave her the ballad and I even typed it out too but nothing happened. Also, it says not to do it in front of her dad and I am clueless on how to get her alone. Someone please help!<br/>
