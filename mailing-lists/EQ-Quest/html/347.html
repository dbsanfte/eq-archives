<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083501891">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
 I got a refund after purchasing this info. Here is the tip/secret... <br/>
Kill lots of things, and don&#39;t die. There was no information that <br/>
hasn&#39;t been provided someplace else in a better format. Again, the <br/>
whole basis for any of the player/class guides was don&#39;t die because <br/>
it reduces the amount of time that you could be out killing things. <br/>
It does not tell where to hunt or at what level.<br/>
<br/>
 Any bugs/secrets were so old to have already been fixed by Verant. <br/>
If you are looking for any specific info on a class/race, your better <br/>
off posting the question here.<br/>
