<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469282587">No this is not the Jagged Pine Crook.  Jeff can you find out where this<br/>
third part comes from? Maybe the location could give a clue as to where<br/>
this quest starts, i&#39;m suspecting that weve come in on the middle of<br/>
it.  Though I havent seen a referenece to a Battle Staff anywhere except<br/>
for on Allakazzams page where apparently Lady McCabe makes some remark<br/>
about it.  I guess I need to try and find the McCabes and try to get<br/>
some information from them.</div>
