<b>Subject:</b> Re: what trade window tactic?..... bone chips from Skarana <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-791340633">oops.. I subsribe to 5 or so onelists and did not get to the other messages<br/>
on this topic.  Thanks all that answered, so my question was already<br/>
answered and sorry for the extra email.  I am impressed however though, this<br/>
list was so dead I forgot I was on it.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a quest question though.  I was doing the quest for Cromils<br/>
remains.  For those of you that don&#39;t know it is a quest acquired in Kaladim<br/>
and takes you to South Karana to retrieve the remains of a famous dwarf that<br/>
are held by a putrid skeleton at the undead camp next to the bridge to North<br/>
karana.  This is also the camp that spawns Lord Grimrot so careful when<br/>
approaching it.  If he is there, just come back later.  I finally found a<br/>
day when he was not and started killing all the putrids.  I am a paladin<br/>
with ward undead so I used that to lure them away so that if Grimrot spawned<br/>
I hopefully would be fighting out of aggro range.  Anyway, my question is<br/>
this.  I receive either 6 or 8 sets of individual unmarked &quot;bone chips&quot; that<br/>
were all marked lore.  There is no differentiation between them, but they<br/>
are all the same, but don&#39;t stack.  I have asked in most zones, and scoured<br/>
the net for any info but cannot find anything.  I did get cromils remains as<br/>
they are marked &quot;dwarf bones&quot; not &quot;bone chips&quot;.  But now i have several<br/>
slots taken up with these lore items that I don&#39;t know what to do with.  Any<br/>
help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks :-)<br/>

&gt;ok, sounds good, but do you have to keep doing it?  I mean all they have to<br/>
&gt;do is click cancel right?<br/>
&gt;Thanks for the reply Rus...  I am a paladin, and we lose kills to everyone.<br/>
