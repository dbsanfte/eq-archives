<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082409975">I am a wizard and I do teleport, and I come out at Faydark near the LFay zone, the spires at stone Bridge, and the spires of Toxulia. In the two times Ive been Evacced out, we have arrived at the spires by stone bridge...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they are for wizards, but as yet I dont actually know. I always arrive at the spires. I do think I heard my next batch of teleports includes one in WK, near the NK border, but dont know what it looks like or where in WK exactly.<br/>

I thought wizard teleports where the little pyramid things?  Like the<br/>
one near the ghoul camp in West Karana?<br/>

Those are wizard teleports. :)<br/>
<br/>
When we do an Evac, or a teleport to zone, we arrive in the center of them. <br/>
The druid Gates look kinda like bargain rate Stonehenge.<br/>

Yea, I&#39;ve noticed that.  Again, probably just re-using objects. :)<br/>
What are those 4 curved pillar things for?  One in greater faydark<br/>
near lesser, one in front of the south karana bridge.  Those are the<br/>
two I&#39;ve noticed... May be others.  Are those for anything?<br/>

Youre probably right about the reusing textures, I dont recall the thread<br/>
well, but it started out based on Brad says... when Brad said there were<br/>
many undiscovered quests still in the game, so the thread was trying to find<br/>
some, or at least stir up ideas. There were supposed to be certain symbols<br/>
in various places that were alike, or something...<br/>
<br/>
Ive noticed in Rathe Mountains is a golden pillar on a half platform with a<br/>
scarab-like design, that is identical to one in NRo, if it has any<br/>
significance or is just coincidence. But the thread went over things like<br/>
that.<br/>

Brad verified that the Fiery Avenger quest did not exist.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure about wall pictures.  What do you mean by that?  I suspect the<br/>
artists just got lazy and re-used images.  there is a sea monster in<br/>
Lake Rathe that&#39;s supposed to be rare, and around level 50.  Not sure<br/>
what it drops, or even if anyone has ever killed it.  Don&#39;t know<br/>
anything about a clockwork dragon.  On the EQ map there is an area<br/>
called Dragonscale hills just south of Ak&#39;Anon that was probably<br/>
never developed.  Perhaps there was supposed to be a clockwork dragon<br/>
in this zone?<br/>

<br/>
Once someone sent me a URL for an EQ bulletin board/discussion forum that<br/>
contained a thread on Mysteries of Norrath. Focusing on the wall pictures<br/>
that are the same in various places.<br/>
<br/>
I lost the url, does anyone have it or recall where this thread was? I found<br/>
another thread called Myths and Mysteries of Norrath that included the Fiery<br/>
Avenger, Sea Serpent, clockwork dragon in its initial post... this was<br/>
interesting too, but not the one I recall reading.<br/>
<br/>
Please help?<br/>
