&gt;Subject: Tax Quest<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I was wondering about the taxes quest in Qeynos. How do you get the<br/>
&gt;final and needed coin from the lady merchant in Qeynos hills? All she<br/>
&gt;does is look at my and cry. I&#39;ve tried everything! Any help would be<br/>
&gt;Appreciated. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I lifted the following text from allakhazam&#39;s Web site hope it helps:<br/>
<br/>
On the second floor one of the buildings in a small group of buildings to<br/>
the EAST of &quot;The Lion&#39;s Mane Tavern&quot; and to the south of &quot;Nesiff&#39;s Wooden<br/>
Weapons&quot; and the &quot;Bag and Barrel&quot;, you will find a man named Vicus Nonad<br/>
with a bad cough. After talking to him for a bit, he will tell you that he<br/>
is a tax collecter and needs you to make his runs for him. He will give you<br/>
a box, in which to place and combine the taxes, and a scroll with the names<br/>
of the people. To get the taxes from the, simply hail them and say &quot;Please<br/>
pay your taxes.&quot; Doing this will give you a very small lowering of faction<br/>
with Qeynos merchants.<br/>
<br/>
Upon going to Mira Sayer, In Qeynos Hills, and asking her to pay, she will<br/>
begin to cry. When you ask her why she is crying, she will tell you a<br/>
halfling named Flynn something or other stole her tax money. He is in Crow&#39;s<br/>
Pub in Qeynos. Go to him, hail him, and ask him if he stole Mira&#39;s tax<br/>
money. He will affirm this, and tell you to say &quot;I am a gnoll loving<br/>
weakling and am not worthy to comb your feet&quot; After doing so, he will shout<br/>
it, and the entire zone will hear what an idiot you are. He&#39;ll give you the<br/>
money</div>
