&gt; it is for but I have noticed several quest that have something to do<br/>
&gt; with the Library of Erudin. So far the Eruds tonic quests, Quest to<br/>

&gt;       About this book...  I believe I have found one of the<br/>
&gt;      pages, but I am not sure... when you get infomation about<br/>
&gt;      this item, it says &quot;Library of Erudin&quot;.  Usually I just<br/>
&gt;      destroy this item, but you have sparked my interest.  I<br/>
&gt;      would like more information about this quest.  Thank you  ;<br/>
&gt;      ) By the way, I did not have to kill anything to get this<br/>
&gt;      page.  A certain NPC drops it. Gibblin (main<br/>
