<b>Subject:</b> Rondo&#39;s Tongue <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-573369234">A couple of weeks ago I posted about a named npc, a dwarven bandit from the<br/>
Crushbone slave camps named Rondo.  In fighting him, I was able to loot the<br/>
tongue(?!?) from the body, but I wasn&#39;t able to find the quest that it<br/>
belonged to.  Since then, I&#39;ve heard a rumor that it belongs to a clerics<br/>
guild quest - probably in Kaladin.  Again this is just a rumor, I haven&#39;t<br/>
had a chance to verify it (damn you, George Lucus! =).<br/>
