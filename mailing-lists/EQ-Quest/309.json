I looked all over in an effort to find something that <br/>\nwould help his faction and came up with donuts.  I remember that one <br/>\nof the things that was suggested was to go to HH Pass and kill Orcs, <br/>\nfor that would help his faction.  At the time, this did not seem to <br/>\ndo the trick.<br/>\n\tWell, I don&#39;t know if my friend just didn&#39;t know what to do, <br/>\ndidn&#39;t do it enough, or if the thing just didn&#39;t work then, but I can <br/>\nnow say for sure that killing both HH orcs and HH gnolls will help, <br/>\nbut the BIG payoff is running their scalps to the local guard <br/>\ncaptains.  Give them a single scalp and you will get exp as well as <br/>\nfaction gains for several different hard to modify groups - including <br/>\nthe Freeport Militia.  The beauty of this one is that there are no <br/>\nfaction losses, as are most of the other +Militia quests of which I <br/>\nknow.  You also get between 1 and 6 gold pieces for doing this, so <br/>\nit&#39;s good for a reasonable chunk of change as well.  I turned in <br/>\nabout 25 of the scalps and went from apprehensive to indifferent.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAaron Braunstein<br/>\nPacific Data Management, Inc.<br/>\n(408)283-5900 xt. 28<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aaron_braunstein@...\">aaron_braunstein@...</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
