Hold up, is there a way to stop<br/>\nor limit Kill stealing?  I have never heard any of this.  Then, I am a<br/>\nmelee and am getting used to losing all my kills and buying from the<br/>\nwizzie who stole from me.  I am a level 23 paladin and would really<br/>\nlike to keep a kill.  Been trying for a PGT, which is a complete waste<br/>\nof my time, since most time is spent sitting.  Then both times i get a<br/>\nshot at the muck, a druid pops out of invis to steal the kill... 2<br/>\ndruids 2 different times.  Is there a way for me to prevent this?  I<br/>\njust need a weapon to wield, and don&#39;t like Everauction.  I started on<br/>\nthe PvP server, not teams, and guess what... there is not kill<br/>\nstealing there.  But short of replaying my 23 levels again, is there<br/>\nanother way???  Please tell me if so.  Lost the PGT 2 times, the<br/>\nchance at BBC about 9 times, the BIBS 6 times, the SBH way over 10<br/>\ntimes.... this is getting old.  For some reason it is usually a gnome<br/>\n(any class), a druid, or a wizard.<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very easy actually. Get a level 20 magician, wizard or enchanter<br/>\nto group with you. That&#39;s right... group. I guarantee you will have<br/>\nquite some success.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, all those kill stealers wait for you to engage the monster before<br/>\nfiring away. This makes it so they don&#39;t have to root it. You group<br/>\nwizard or magician can do over 145 points of damage on a single shot.<br/>\nMake sure you time it so you can engate the creature once he starts<br/>\ncasting. If a kill stealer fires off a spell after this happens, it&#39;s<br/>\nvery sweet. You group caster will be able to do more damage, even if<br/>\nhe is much lower level, because he will have a second opportunity to<br/>\nburn before the kill stealer does.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need help acquiring an item, but it is generally considered good<br/>\nmanners to help the caster aquire his items too. In many situations, a<br/>\ncaster has a very difficult time in getting items unless the monster<br/>\nin question is very very green unless he kill steals it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you can probably get a caster or two to join you if you go for<br/>\ntwo spawns of the PGT instead of just camping for yours and then<br/>\nleaving.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you may not want to deal with this. But, the fact of the matter<br/>\nis, if a caster needs to get an item, often the best way is to go for<br/>\nsomething like the PGT which they can get easily and then sell it so<br/>\nthey can buy what they can&#39;t get in more difficult situations.<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\nBen Pocock<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bpocock@...\">bpocock@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.golden.net/~bpocock\">http://www.golden.net/~bpocock</a><br/>\n--------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
