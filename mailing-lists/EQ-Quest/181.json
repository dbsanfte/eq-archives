It&#39;s the deputy standing closest to the stairs.<br/>\nYou say &quot;Am I one with the wall?&quot;  If you have earned it he will give it to<br/>\nyou.<br/>\nAs for recharging, I believe you just give it to the cleric in the cleric<br/>\nguild, and it returns to your inventory immediately.  I am not 100% sure on<br/>\nthe cleric, I just watched a guy fighting Nillipuss do it, I never saw him<br/>\nsay anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou turn the necklaces into the sherrif, and the orc belts into the deputy<br/>\nout on the wall in Misty Thicket, you also earn faction for killing those<br/>\norcs and goblins in Misty.  I also hear that completing any quests in this<br/>\nzone also gives you faction.  One in particular is to go by polar bear<br/>\ncloaks/skins (I forget which one, do the quest and he tells you which one<br/>\nyou need), and ways, go to Halas, and I believe you can buy these items from<br/>\nthe vendors or from newbies that are out killing low level monsters.  If you<br/>\nfill up your entire inventory with these and bring them back and turn them<br/>\nin one at a time (or however many he requested at a time) you earn cash/exp,<br/>\nand faction.  I heard that 8 bags full is supposed to be enough, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow anything for sure, this is just what I have read, and heard from people<br/>\nthat I have met who have this ring.<br/>\n<br/>\nWenaddar - 17th level bard of Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tJeff Hoerig [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeffh@...\">jeffh@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tFriday, July 02, 1999 2:09 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Quest@onelist.com\">EQ-Quest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ-Quest] Quest Help(riverdale)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jeff Hoerig&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeffh@...\">jeffh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- <br/>\n&gt; I would appreciate help on the Squad Ring quest the most...It is really<br/>\n&gt; ticking me off that the stupid sherrif will not give me the ring...Once<br/>\n&gt; I finally do get the ring, can I get it recharged or do I have to go get<br/>\n&gt; a new one?
