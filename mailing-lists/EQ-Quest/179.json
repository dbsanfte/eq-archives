I have given a whole bunch of necklaces to the<br/>\nSheriff in Riverdale, a lot of belts to Deputy Budo, and killed a<br/>\ncrapload of goblins.  The deputies consider me warmly...How can I tell<br/>\nhow much longer it will take me before I get the ring? Ive also killed<br/>\nMooto quite a few times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there is a NPC in Riverdale named Silna Stormsmith(sp?)...She goes<br/>\non about delivering messages to Freeport but I cannot get her to give me<br/>\nthe quest..Is the quest worth it?  How do I go about getting it?  If you<br/>\nare coming out of Misty Thicket, Silna spawns down the hallway to the<br/>\nleft, next to that bench where deputies stand.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, any tips on doing the Nillipuss quest would be helpful...What<br/>\nlevel do I have to be to kill him?  How long does it take him to spawn?<br/>\nWhere does he spawn?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate help on the Squad Ring quest the most...It is really<br/>\nticking me off that the stupid sherrif will not give me the ring...Once<br/>\nI finally do get the ring, can I get it recharged or do I have to go get<br/>\na new one?  If I can get it recharged, how do I do it?  Im a level 16<br/>\nmonk.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrimlin<br/>\nBristlebane server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
