The wolf is said to come to the temple with a local barbarian.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found frostbite in a nearby fishing village, but no sign of the<br/>\nfish. Attacking him brings out the local barbarians with swords in hand,<br/>\nand if you DO manage to kill the wolf there is no fish to be found in his<br/>\nbelly (he only gives up a pelt).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t lure him away from the camp, as he is standing in a fenced area. <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anybody else taken this quest?
