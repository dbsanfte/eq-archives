Go to Options and limit what kind of<br/>\n&gt; ppl can trade with you, you can make it just group members, or make it so<br/>\n&gt; that you will not accept trades from anyone. Putting up the trade window is<br/>\n&gt; not a way at all to a person that knows his options in EQ, take a look<br/>\n&gt; sometime, you will be better off knowing what you can and cant do.<br/>\n&gt; the -kinda- best way is cancel magic, but even thats not so hot. he might<br/>\n&gt; just sit there and wait for the best time to strike, IE: When the critter he<br/>\n&gt; wants is near half life and then nuke the snot out of it, so there is<br/>\n&gt; nothing you can do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; one of the better ways was mentioned by Lanadina the Magician, and thats to<br/>\n&gt; back off. Let the wiz have his cake and then he might either leave, or get<br/>\n&gt; his ass handed back to him from the ensuing mob. In my personal travels tho,<br/>\n&gt; the best way to beat a wiz, is with another wiz. if they are close in lvls<br/>\n&gt; your mage will have the advantage. I have sent many a wiz packing just cuz i<br/>\n&gt; was faster and better than he was [and after that he offered us an INSANE<br/>\n&gt; amount of money for the item he wanted].<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; but most of all, dont immediately go to dirty tactics when you see a wiz,<br/>\n&gt; talk to him, find out what he wants and see if the option of turns, or a<br/>\n&gt; line up, or just giving him the item [if none of your group want it] and let<br/>\n&gt; him be on his way. the easiest method to do is talk IN A CALM AND SENSE-ABLE<br/>\n&gt; MANNER. there are too many kids out there that just jump to conclusions and<br/>\n&gt; think that all wizards are KSers and start spamming OOC and generally making<br/>\n&gt; an ass of themselves. sometimes Wizards dont see you kiting, or behind that<br/>\n&gt; hill and see a kill like anyother person. Wizs can shoot far so they dont<br/>\n&gt; have to be near to kill things. sometimes they think you are in trouble and<br/>\n&gt; just want to help out [for which i have been spammed SO much that i only<br/>\n&gt; help when asked now]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; take it easy, take some vallium, take your time, and HAVE FUN, if this game<br/>\n&gt; is causing you to have ulcers cuz of shiat like this, then step back, think<br/>\n&gt; of options, and plan what to do that doesnt resort to you showing the world<br/>\n&gt; what an immature person you are. [i no there are bad wizards out there, but<br/>\n&gt; truthfully, its a real LOW percentage that doesnt reflect the avg mentality<br/>\n&gt; of the wizards in Norrath]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Vanya - Lv 20 Wizard - Quellious<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aye  That&#39;s The Truth ..  But I found now . I played a higher level .. and now a<br/>\nLower level , at lower level Kill stealing more rampart and ppl are just more<br/>\nrude .. that&#39;s Why i like my Cleric as a Dark elf  I sow chaos I can help or not<br/>\nhelp as I want in game ( and not steal kills , no cleric ever got the kill from<br/>\nHealing ).. and most of the time I just avoid arguments my Ignore list is pretty<br/>\nlong ... like the reasonable polite fellow who calmed that DW caiman attacked<br/>\nHim as we were pulling it ... * LMAO*  or That wizard who just helped a little<br/>\ntoo much  (But never bluntly kill stole)  or  the guy who trained a SG to P1 so<br/>\nhe could get away ..  ppl .. who just don&#39;t care and do what they want .. I<br/>\nremember them and they never get help heal&#39;s or later Res&#39;s  if they ever make<br/>\nthat high of a level ppl like that almost never find groups ..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* Still amazed that a true Bi*** on his server can find ppl to hunt with*  (<br/>\nthis one would be KOS by 90% of the Server on PvP) She has 1 group that will<br/>\nhunt with  her and they spend 75%  apogizling for her action and Mouth...<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nJamie Macdonald<br/>\n<br/>\nA.K.A<br/>\nMagis DarkStone<br/>\nMercenary Mage<br/>\nErollisi Marr-Retired<br/>\n<br/>\nVanear D&#39;Magis Cleric of Chaos<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve been a Wizard, Magician, Sorcerer, And Charlatan.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Knowledge Is Power, Learn how to use It&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Two are 10 times more powerful than One&quot;<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
