EQVaut has it all archived if you want to<br/>\nread about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom a previous post:<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad verified that the Fiery Avenger quest did not exist.  I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure about wall pictures.  What do you mean by that?  I suspect the<br/>\nartists just got lazy and re-used images.  there is a sea monster in<br/>\nLake Rathe that&#39;s supposed to be rare, and around level 50.  Not sure<br/>\nwhat it drops, or even if anyone has ever killed it.  Don&#39;t know<br/>\nanything about a clockwork dragon.  On the EQ map there is an area<br/>\ncalled Dragonscale hills just south of Ak&#39;Anon that was probably<br/>\nnever developed.  Perhaps there was supposed to be a clockwork dragon<br/>\nin this zone?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
