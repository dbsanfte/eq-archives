I know w bit of the general customs in guilds but nto all,  no when you join<br/>
a guild it is mainly just people you hang out with and share knowledge with,<br/>
your guild if large enough can create special quests and people.  And if you<br/>
have been around a long time and are powerfull enough your guild ( provided<br/>
the platinum ) may also buy one of those vacant buildings that are so<br/>
common,  this is what i heard of the power of a guild,  you can also declare<br/>
wars and have great petitioning power.<br/>
<br/>
But about your questions:<br/>
<br/>
A. most guilds do not forbid you to party with other people.  Personlly I<br/>
would forget any guild that did that.  BTW how would a guid get new members<br/>
if their members were in social?<br/>
<br/>
That should answer most of your questions ( hehe short one answer )<br/>
