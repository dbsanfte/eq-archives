<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265336113">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I am looking to create a guild of all race and class combinations as long as the person has a good moral and the class is one of the specific spellcasting guilds.  Wizard, Cleric, Enchanter, Necromancer, and Magician.  Paladins, Druids, and Bards are also possibly addmited into the guild as semi-casters yet as full non secluded members.  This is currently an unnoficial guild and will be based solely on Rodcet Nife.  If you ahve an interest in this, then please send it to the mailing list and my e-mail.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sachav@...">sachav@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
Kinthir,</div>
