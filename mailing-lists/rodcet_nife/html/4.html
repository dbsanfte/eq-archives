I was goin&#39; to be in a guild wit jes Rogues but now me have da second thouhts metinks,..  Der no healers.  Dis makes fer long time jes sittin an lookin&#39; at me rogue pals.  Me likes dem fair enuff but dey no look like da pretty lasses of Kaladim.  Anyhows metinks I need some counselin&#39; from ye da peoples here.  Rogues&#39; always more effectiv with 2 of dem radder than 1 so me always want annuder Rogue in me party.  But, whens ye join a guild are ye forbidden to hunt wit other tings not in yer guild.  What are da customs.  Any of ye smarties&#39; out der can answer dat me think fondly of ye.<br/>
