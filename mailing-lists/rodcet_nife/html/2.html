<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I am looking to create a guild of all race and class combinations as<br/>
&gt; long as the person has a good moral and the class is one of the<br/>
&gt; specific spellcasting guilds.  Wizard, Cleric, Enchanter, Necromancer,<br/>
&gt; and Magician.  Paladins, Druids, and Bards are also possibly addmited<br/>
&gt; into the guild as semi-casters yet as full non secluded members.  This<br/>
&gt; is currently an unnoficial guild and will be based solely on Rodcet<br/>
&gt; Nife.  If you ahve an interest in this, then please send it to the<br/>
&gt; mailing list and my e-mail.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sachav@...">sachav@...</a>. </span></blockquote></div>
