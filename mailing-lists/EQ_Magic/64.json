With <br/>\nthe exception of armor though there is minimal demand for items created <br/>\nby the other skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you finish pondering a trade and finally decide upon one you will <br/>\nfind how utterly pointless it is until you have invested about 200pp in <br/>\nit (with the case of smithing or jewelry) or completely pointless <br/>\n(brewing, pottery, etc.).  <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Vincent.Archer <br/>\nSent: Monday, May 10, 1999 11:40 AM<br/>\nTo: .EQ.Magic<br/>\nCc: Vincent.Archer<br/>\nSubject: Re: [_EQ_Magic] Malachite in Qeynos?

You should at least be able to recover your initial <br/>\n&gt; investment on these trade skills (not to mention the fact all the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>money <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lost on failures).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Note that none of the items players create exist otherwise (i.e. you <br/>\ncan&#39;t<br/>\nmake straight leather, chain, plate, or anything else). Which means the<br/>\nmarket for these items isn&#39;t supposed to be the NPC, it&#39;s supposed to be<br/>\nthe OTHER players.  Never sell to NPCs what you can sell to players.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltannis, Wizard starting to ponder what trade skill he should take,<br/>\napart from its fishing hobby whenever waiting for that damned boat<br/>\nbetween Butcherblock and Freeport :)<br/>\n<br/>\n(hmmm, rogues get the poison trade skill, shamans alchemy, enchanter are<br/>\n naturals for jewelry... but what about the other mage classes...
