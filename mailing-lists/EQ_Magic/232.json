You were given<br/>\nthose illusions for a reason... you are going to need every one of them.<br/>\nSeveral spells are ONLY in Erudin in the Library... Mostly all of your<br/>\nhigher level illusions and Illusion Halfling.  The enchant metal series is<br/>\nonly in Neriak&#39;s Third gate Library.  A few spells are only in Ak anon, and<br/>\na few more only in Felwithe.  For the most part, the thicken mana series is<br/>\nONLY in the brownie camp in L Feydark.   You will be visiting just about<br/>\nevery zone in Norrath, looking for spells.  Best idea is to make good<br/>\nfriends with a druid...lots of travel.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
