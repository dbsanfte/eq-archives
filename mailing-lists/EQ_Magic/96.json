Lets <br/>\n&gt;say<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for example spell SHADOW STEP and FADE hmm it teleports you in random<br/>\n&gt; &gt;direction and random way from a casting place. It teleports you in lower<br/>\n&gt; &gt;position so you can finish under water. But it is magic user last defence<br/>\n&gt; &gt;when something comes in his directionhe can cast this and take at last a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fast stert running from enemy but .. as you cast it you have realy nice<br/>\n&gt; &gt;probability to A. dont move at all b. teleport near your enemy and util <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;understand where are you many times is too late.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Second example is INVISIBILITY hmmm duration is random thing and you <br/>\n&gt;never<br/>\n&gt; &gt;know how long it will stay you can find yourself in half of enemies and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;death.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Maybe i miss something but i used a shadow step for some time now and <br/>\n&gt;after<br/>\n&gt; &gt;i died some times becouse it not function and it teleports me 1 step from <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;place where i was before and until you get oriented where are you end a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;monsters are all over you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my suggestion is to make a shadow step with at last some minimum radius <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;second to put a limitation in lets say 40 grades from a point of view.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;do you have other problems with too much inprevedible random efects in<br/>\n&gt;game?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Wizard looser?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From all classes a wizards have worst mana use as i see it no buffs but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;strong damage but also too much mana used for this DD. Look at pets they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;can stay as long as you wish around and all time do damage and serve as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;shield. i heared of many magician and enchanters not to talk about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;necromancers wich can alone take 3 or 4 blue monsters some of them can <br/>\n&gt;take<br/>\n&gt; &gt;also on a yellow alone. as a wizard i never know of any who can take 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt;blues alone after a 12 lv. In a group you must all time meditate for mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all other have much longer battle use before remain OOM. If a group fight<br/>\n&gt; &gt;red then a lower resistance of wizard spells can be used but after hard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fight as persons with more mana then others wizards take a too long time<br/>\n&gt; &gt;meditating and all others will be ready to fight another battle before a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wizard. I hope that a specialiation will help and i heared of items wich<br/>\n&gt; &gt;help mana regeneration wich are wizard specific.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Please help me to explain why a wizards are not a worst mage class?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Silverion<br/>\n&gt; &gt;High elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;moderator<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;                       Free Games, Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;             Gamesville - World&#39;s Biggest Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;                 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
