A sapphire platinum necklace requires a platinum bar (~100pp) and sapphire (also ~100pp), so the base cost, materials only is 200pp! Don t expect a jeweler","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1361600179\">According to Thomas Adelsberger:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; For a total (if you use the sapphire necklace and rose rings jewelry made by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; players):<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Mana +125, Int +52<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Holy crap ;)<br/>\n&gt; How much does this jewelry go for ?<br/>\n&gt; Just wondering.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A sapphire platinum necklace requires a platinum bar (~100pp) and sapphire (also<br/>\n~100pp), so the base cost, materials only is 200pp! Don&#39;t expect a jeweler to<br/>\nmake one for you without asking for at least 500pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sapphire necklace is +7 str/+7 iq. Not bad at all. Pricey but the item is very<br/>\npowerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Rose Ring is &quot;cheaper&quot;. Platinum again at 100pp, plus a mere quartz at a pittance<br/>\nof 1pp :) - expect a sell price of 200-250pp. It creates a ring of +4 intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven the progression, I expect the skill required for these items to be about 100,<br/>\ni.e. being done by only a very few jewelers; most will drop the trade as it becomes more<br/>\nand more expensive to train oneself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that jewelry is the money sink Verant was aiming for. Items are now competitive<br/>\nfor their price, and the investment required will weed out jewelers as levels<br/>\nprogress. Now, if tailors could make special leather armors... or tinkers good<br/>\nitems.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
