Most changes are<br/>\nfor enchanter wich life start to be easier and necromancer. What is most<br/>\nimportant is that we finaly start to get some feedback to see what change<br/>\nand what are plans to change and we can react in base of this. &lt;br&gt;<br/>\nWrite feedback in game on all things wich you wish to see or change,<br/>\ndiscuss it on boards or on mail lists so that we can ALL put a presion in<br/>\nsame direction to show our wishes and to have hope to see it hapnd.

Abjuration skill will be checked (if present) and if<br/>\nsuccessful, will decrease the amount of mana used to cast the<br/>\nspell.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Specialization skills are as follows:&nbsp;<br/>\nSpecialization&nbsp; Abjuration, Specialization&nbsp; Alteration,<br/>\nSpecialization&nbsp; Conjuration, Specialization&nbsp; Divination, and<br/>\nSpecialization&nbsp; Evocation.&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nother important spells news&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;font size=4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spells&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;font size=3&gt;Please note that Beta was used for testing<br/>\nspells.&nbsp;

We<br/>\ndecided, however, to leave in the Beta ability of right-clicking an item<br/>\nfor information.&nbsp; The identify spell will soon be used for revealing<br/>\nthe lore, if any, associated with item.&nbsp; Lore will only be found on<br/>\nhigh magic or Artifact level items&nbsp; an item with lore will typically<br/>\nbe rare. &lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nDetect Magic: This spell will be replaced with a new spell sometime in<br/>\nthe near future.&nbsp;

There is a display error, where a ∩┐╜monster∩┐╜ will not be<br/>\nseen to spin when the spell is cast on them.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will be<br/>\nfixed shortly.&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nIllusion: Air Elemental, Water Elemental and Fire Elemental: There is a<br/>\ndisplay error that causes Enchanters who cast the illusion to look like<br/>\nEarth Elementals.&nbsp; This is only a display error&nbsp; all NPC<br/>\nreactions are still based on the appropriate elemental type.&nbsp; This<br/>\nwill be fixed shortly.&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changed&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size=3&gt;Dark Pact and Allure of Death&nbsp;
