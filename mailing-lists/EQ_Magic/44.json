Imagine<br/>\nmy surprise when he had none!  I shouted (which I usually do not do)<br/>\nsaying why the was no more Malachite and where I could get some.  Someone<br/>\nmetioned I could visit Erudin for the Green Goodness.  I went to Erudin<br/>\n(when I could have been going to SplitPaw) and found out they cost 2 more<br/>\nsilver than they were in Qeynos! (7 silver).  Now I see this lack of a<br/>\nbasic component in a human city as a discouragment to all magicians who<br/>\nstart out here.  Does anybody agree or is there some news I didn&#39;t not yet<br/>\nhear about? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n   Kapolokok<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************************************************************<br/>\n&quot;Rumpletweezer ran the Dinky Tinky shop in the foot of the            <br/>\nMagic oak tree by the wobbly dum dum tree in the shade of<br/>\nthe magic glade down in Dingly Dell.
