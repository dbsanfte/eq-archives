Yes, just the sheer casting of the spells helps the castor.  And<br/>\nsomething so simple, to the mage/Shaman, such as creating food and water is<br/>\na HUGE deal for someone who can not do these things.  And hopefully, as you<br/>\nstated, when we do need some help, this person will remember our kindness<br/>\nand step in and do something simple to them that is not so simple to us like<br/>\nSwing that Sword or cast that Massive DD spell to save our butts in a time<br/>\nof crisis.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as you state, if we log or camp, the food and water we have provided<br/>\nto them, no matter HOW much we gave them, dissappears, so it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>\nright to charge for an intangible, especially when Server TimeOuts are still<br/>\nfairly common (at least for me)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, binding on the other hand, as you said, is a HUGE mana drain and a HUGE<br/>\nbenefit to someone.  You see people selling armor and weapons that they have<br/>\nmade or found all the time because others find that it will benefit them.<br/>\nSo charging for binding doesn&#39;t seem out of the question because it is a<br/>\npermanent effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion, does someone have to submit to being Bound or can you BIND them<br/>\nwithout their consent?  i don&#39;t knwo why you would do this, just curious.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, Ann, you do belong to the EQMagicians and ShamenEQ Mailing lists also,<br/>\ncorrect?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt;On Fri, 30 Apr 1999, Matthew Musingo wrote:<br/>\n--&gt;&gt; Many unelightened warriors have walked up to me and asked to be<br/>\n--&gt;&gt; binded/SOWed/get some food and water/invisible. Now, my <br/>\n--&gt;question is...what<br/>\n--&gt;&gt; is your recommendation as setting the price on these spells?<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;I have two mage characters- a 7th lvl High Elf Magician and a 5th lvl<br/>\n--&gt;Barbarian Shaman, both on the Rallos Zek server.<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;With the 7th lvl Magician, as long as I have the mana and <br/>\n--&gt;the time, or the<br/>\n--&gt;extra supplies, I will summon food/water/bandages for free. <br/>\n--&gt;I feel (and<br/>\n--&gt;this is my own personal ethic here) that it is of <br/>\n--&gt;questionable ethics to<br/>\n--&gt;charge for this service. A few reasons for this.<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;1. When the person camps, the food is going to disappear, so <br/>\n--&gt;it is not<br/>\n--&gt;really, IMHO, a tangible sellable object.<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;2. I feel I have an obligation to help other &quot;good&quot; races in their<br/>\n--&gt;endevours. Providing free food and water is an easy way to do this,<br/>\n--&gt;especially when hunting out in an area removed from civilization.<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;3. When I am in a jam, I don&#39;t want to be expected to pay for help.<br/>\n--&gt;Likewise, when others are in a jam, I do not want to charge<br/>\n--&gt;them.<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;I have not gotten the Bind Affinity spell yet and have not <br/>\n--&gt;decided how I<br/>\n--&gt;will handle that. I think that can be looked at differently, <br/>\n--&gt;since it is a<br/>\n--&gt;huge mana soak and it is something that makes someone&#39;s life <br/>\n--&gt;easier. It is<br/>\n--&gt;not a bare necessity.<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;The going rate I have seen for binding tends to fall in the 5g.<br/>\n--&gt;neighborhood, although I have seen people advertising to do <br/>\n--&gt;it for a plat.<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;With the 5th level Barbarian Shaman, I will cast buffs and <br/>\n--&gt;heals for free<br/>\n--&gt;and often unsolicited. A little random kindness and all of <br/>\n--&gt;that. It also<br/>\n--&gt;helps me practice my spells and gain goodwill in what can be a fairly<br/>\n--&gt;rough neighborhood for a newbie.<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;Just my two cents.. :)<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;Ann<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;<br/>\n--&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--&gt;-----------<br/>\n--&gt;What does Public Radio&#39;s &quot;Ask Dr. Science Show&quot; know that <br/>\n--&gt;you don&#39;t...?<br/>\n--&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n--&gt;...That ONElist hosts the largest free e-mail lists on the <br/>\n--&gt;Internet today!<br/>\n--&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--&gt;-----------<br/>\n--&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n--&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
