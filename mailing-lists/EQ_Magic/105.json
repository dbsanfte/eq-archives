So if you gain a skill your attack value will go up (maybe<br/>\nonly after you zone or disconect as if it is case with languages)<br/>\n<br/>\n I think that formula is something like<br/>\n<br/>\n(Strenght bonus * (level factor)) + (weapon skill * (dexterity factor)=<br/>\nattack value<br/>\n<br/>\nim not sure where dexterity enters in game. But when control this you must<br/>\nbe careful becouse when you dont have a weapon in hand it count your Hand<br/>\nto hand skill !! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone wish to try this you must cast strenght spell on you and see<br/>\nchange of Attack then put and remove a pair od derwish rings wich give you<br/>\nmore dexterity and see attack and i think that you will have enough data<br/>\nfor a little matematic game :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 19.32 13/05/99 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zdogg@...\">zdogg@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am posting this to both newsletters because I have seen this question<br/>\n </span></blockquote>pop up <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;on both.
