What exactly do <br/>\nyou feel needs to be done to the Wizard class to improve it??  They are <br/>\nan indispensable part of a group as they are the masters at laying down <br/>\ndamage.  With the exception of maybe Rogues (and only because most of <br/>\ntheir abilities are not functioning) I don&#39;t think there is any problem <br/>\nwith any of the classes and I have played most of them to reasonable <br/>\nlevels (mid teens).  Each class is designed to complement the other and <br/>\nmake a positive contribution to the group, no one class is designed to <br/>\nbe all powerful or all things.  Remember this game is ENTIRELY based <br/>\nupon the concept of being in a group, if you want to solo you can but <br/>\nobviously the game mechanics are not going to be friendly to it as the <br/>\ngame was not designed to be played solo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: wizard <br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 08, 1999 11:26 AM<br/>\nTo: .EQ.Magic<br/>\nCc: wizard<br/>\nSubject: Re: [_EQ_Magic] Wizards<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nVery big problem is that verant dont have a time to balance classes and<br/>\nraces and whole game to be exact for high lv thet mean after lv 29 -30. <br/>\nIn<br/>\nbeta there vere not enough people at high lv to make a exact balancing <br/>\nand<br/>\nuntil one month ago some high lv dungeons in game where with monsters<br/>\nwithout loot you can see that a lady vox a mighty dragon is even now <br/>\ntuned<br/>\nin. So after lv 20 wizards were untuned, what you can se with problems <br/>\nwith<br/>\nlv 20 spells.<br/>\nMany players in beta jumper right from lv 10 15 to lv 40 to be able to <br/>\ntest<br/>\nhigh lv but they nevarly never arived normaly at lv 50. only 2 guys <br/>\nusing<br/>\nsome not so legal techicues made it very fast to get at high lv. so <br/>\nnormal<br/>\nbalancing of high lv classes was never made and we see it proces now in<br/>\nlast patchs. Wizards have a right to have its share of funn in game if <br/>\nthey<br/>\nare weak at start they have right to be relatyve strong at end of game.<br/>\nThey are now not masters of DD spels as max lv spell is not in game, <br/>\nhiden<br/>\nspells are to god hiden and they also are not masters of transport and <br/>\nthey<br/>\nhave very anoying time needing to meditate much more of other classes <br/>\nand<br/>\nare much easier to die depending of power of their spells, and low<br/>\ndefences. They are better balanced that some other classes, and are not<br/>\nweakest class in game but they need some retouch and im sure many other<br/>\nclasses need retouch in need to follow idea what verant put in front of<br/>\nclass its group roles and overall game play and time needed to get to <br/>\nmax<br/>\npower lv it is valid for all classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 16.11 07/07/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think the whole point is the game is oriented and balanced towards <br/>\n&gt;groups.
