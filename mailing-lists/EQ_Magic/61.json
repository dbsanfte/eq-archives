That is part of the game. I get my spells a bunch cheaper <br/>\nin Felwithe than other places. As in RL life, it expensive to travel <br/>\nfrom home atleast you dont have to pay for a hotel evernight. But i <br/>\nfind the loot and experience is worth the trip.  IF you think it is bad <br/>\nbeing what everrace you are.. Try a Dark Elf.. Most will merchants <br/>\nwill Kill you on sight, if they dont they mostlikely wont sell to you.  <br/>\nTry having to rely on friends to sell for you evernight or traveling <br/>\nback to the commons or neriak.. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Vincent Archer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Vincent.Archer@...\">Vincent.Archer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to myself:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Merchants are racists. Even in your guildhouse do they rip you. Over the<br/>\n&gt; 8th level spells, I spare almost a platinum by going back to Felwithe<br/>\n&gt; over the Freeport prices.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I just made the trip yesterday, after writing down the exact prices <br/>\n(down<br/>\nto copper). There&#39;s a difference of 2 gold, 8 silver and 1 copper <br/>\nbetween<br/>\nthe Freeport prices and the Felwithe prices, adding to over a 1 <br/>\nplatinum<br/>\nwhen I purchased all the 8 levels spells I wanted (Shock of Frost, <br/>\nShadow<br/>\nStep, Shielding, Eye of Zoom).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt made a large difference. I was unable to purchase all spells if I<br/>\nremained in Freeport, but making the trip was worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference in percentage remains at level 12; there&#39;s a 4 gold<br/>\ndifference in prices.  I&#39;ll see if I still feel the need to spare 2pp over<br/>\nthe 12th level spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n                      Free Games, Cash Prizes!<br/>\n            Gamesville - World&#39;s Biggest Game Show Site!<br/>\n                <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBill Butler<br/>\nOwner<br/>\nInternet Butler Company</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
