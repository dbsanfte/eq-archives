Counting fizzles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe spells at real high levels are monstruous, and are simply combat-ending<br/>\n(you cast only them once, because the monster will drop anything and go<br/>\nstraight at you; no one can dish out damage like that). The real forte<br/>\nof the Wizard is, of course, travel spells.
