So dear friends finaly verant guys found<br/>\n&gt; that death penality is too big in world where is so easy to die by thousnds<br/>\n&gt; of random things wich can provoke it and if you must to pass 3 zones to get<br/>\n&gt; your corpse i think that you will thing twice about daing a same mistake<br/>\n&gt; again. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I died so many times this weekend- it was pathetic and frustrating and had<br/>\nme seriously thinking about quitting the game altogether. I was trying to<br/>\nsolo in Crushbone and I only go out of the zone transition area once. The<br/>\ntrains would come in, my pet and I could handle all the green orcs and<br/>\nthen a slaver or taskmaster would show up and it was all over.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the only things I&#39;d been killing were green orcs, I was losing more<br/>\nexperience than I was making. It was completely disheartening and I<br/>\nfinally went back to the Chessboard in Butcherblock to make up the<br/>\nexperience I lost. I find the Chessboard sort of boring and it is not very<br/>\ngood for loot either. In short, by getting killed three times, I&#39;d lost<br/>\nall the experience I&#39;d made in a week and was driven to go fight in an<br/>\narea that didn&#39;t interest me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich made the game not fun anymore. Luckily, I didn&#39;t make any rash<br/>\ndecisions. I&#39;m level 10 and one of my goals in the game is to get to level<br/>\n20. Hopefully, this lowering of the death penalty will help me accomplish<br/>\nthis goal with the minimum amount of frustration and the maximum amount of<br/>\nfun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnya<br/>\nHigh Elf Magician<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
