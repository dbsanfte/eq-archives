While I can appreciate Verant&#39;s attempt to create a <br/>\n&gt; totally player driven economy; one should be able to make a minimal <br/>\n&gt; living dealing with NPC&#39;s to some extent (with the exception of <br/>\n&gt; fishing).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not the intent. Verant didn&#39;t want to repeat the Ultima Offline<br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In particular the creation of magic jewelry kills me.  I create <br/>\n&gt; something for 5.5PP, sell it to a vendor for 4.5PP, he in turn marks it <br/>\n&gt; up to 98PP.  You should at least be able to recover your initial <br/>\n&gt; investment on these trade skills (not to mention the fact all the money <br/>\n&gt; lost on failures).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Note that none of the items players create exist otherwise (i.e. you can&#39;t<br/>\nmake straight leather, chain, plate, or anything else). Which means the<br/>\nmarket for these items isn&#39;t supposed to be the NPC, it&#39;s supposed to be<br/>\nthe OTHER players.  Never sell to NPCs what you can sell to players.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltannis, Wizard starting to ponder what trade skill he should take,<br/>\napart from its fishing hobby whenever waiting for that damned boat<br/>\nbetween Butcherblock and Freeport :)<br/>\n<br/>\n(hmmm, rogues get the poison trade skill, shamans alchemy, enchanter are<br/>\n naturals for jewelry... but what about the other mage classes...
