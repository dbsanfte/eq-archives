And there<br/>\nis talk that they are to be replaced..  It seems to me that a useful<br/>\nreplacement would be a low level spell that gauges accurately the ability<br/>\nlevel of a summoned pet..<br/>\n    I mean we are supposedly the masters of our own trade, and yet we don&#39;t<br/>\neven know most times upon summoning a new pet what level it is..  This<br/>\nmakes no sense.. I understand the point for randomness, but not for<br/>\nignorance..<br/>\n    A simple spell that popped up a text message that gave at least the<br/>\ncritters numerical level.. Would be great.. Better (but less likely) would<br/>\nbe a quick gage of base abilities like given when looking at an item..<br/>\nPersonally I think HP, Atk, and AC along with level and maybe special<br/>\nabilities would be perfect, as it would put to rest all the debate over<br/>\nwhether or not the different types of elementals are really different..<br/>\n    I&#39;d love to see this go into effect.. As a programmer I think this<br/>\nwould be one of the less difficult suggestions to implement (it&#39;s just<br/>\nreading info already in the system and reporting it through text.. No major<br/>\nmods needed).. I&#39;m thinking a petition is in order.. But have no clue how<br/>\nto get one started...<br/>\n<br/>\n    Any ideas/comments?<br/>\n<br/>\nRaij - 6th level Magician of Neriak<br/>\nAhiru - 5th level Necromancer of Neriak<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator<br/>\n<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
