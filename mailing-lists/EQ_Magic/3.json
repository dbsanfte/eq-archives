Wizard is hevy hitter low survivibility class with nice FADE, Shadow<br/>\nstep serie escape spells YES?? NOOOOOO<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is a looser if he uses his spells as this spells are RANDOM so it will<br/>\nteleport you anywere maybe also in middle of monsters!! so it is russian<br/>\nrulet type spell. i used it 20 30 times in times of need and only 3 times<br/>\ndid i escape a fate. It sometime teleport you in back of monster sometime<br/>\nin middle of zoo sometime just into zone so you force zone out and<br/>\nsometimes so long awey that until you find where are you and where to run<br/>\nmonsters again cach on you.<br/>\nThis spell is nearly inutilizable in this state as it is now so please<br/>\nsuggest changes that dont make it too powerfull but at last usefull.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis line of spells can be fast and directed !! so when you cast it it will<br/>\nmove you some space from 5 to 10 seconds advantage from monster in<br/>\ndirection where you look &quot;not random direction&quot;. to compensate it i will<br/>\nput long recovery time on all spells so you cannot use it to teleport and<br/>\nthen open fire  then again teleport then fire again and so on. ( if there<br/>\ncan be some random number so that if you teleport to max range you can turn<br/>\nand fire but until you turn monsters will cach you if you are not<br/>\nteleported farr enough.!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp:&#92;&#92;www.tip.it/wizard<br/>\nmoderator<br/>\n<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
