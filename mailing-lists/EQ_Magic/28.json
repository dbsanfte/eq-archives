Spells at first fail after that they start to get some punch<br/>\nbut monsters also get much more punch. and when you think you finaly can<br/>\nhave some realible spells all a new with new ciklus of spells. mana<br/>\nmeditating and running to recover corpse as your warrior friends thinked<br/>\nthat you will resist this little 2 orcs a bit longer, is a life of a<br/>\nwizard. I hope that at last in later lv somone will call i need a wizard in<br/>\ngroup now ( less then 16 lv ) i never seen anyone searching for a wizard<br/>\nclerics, paladins, druids are all time requested so calling healing classes<br/>\nwe nukers are out of game for now  sight sight (strange bards are more<br/>\nrequestesd in group and they have better solo play then wizards)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
