But I have to keep<br/>\n&gt;asking myself: &quot;Why would my character spend all of his money developing a<br/>\n&gt;trade that provides no benefit?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I mean, aren&#39;t trade skills supposed to represent _jobs_ in EQ?  If so,<br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t you expect to _make_ money by using them?  If the skill was<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Throwing money into the water&quot; (something to practice while fishing, I<br/>\n&gt;guess), I would expect that the skill would provide no benefit, and<br/>\n&gt;my character would develop it for some other reason (perhaps, because he <br/>\n&gt;is a loony).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I see no inconsistency in being a true role-player and whining about the<br/>\n&gt;fact that you make no money by &lt;insert trade skill&gt;.  IRL, I whine that<br/>\n&gt;the jobs I&#39;d like to have don&#39;t pay enough.  So, why shouldn&#39;t my<br/>\n&gt;character complain, ESPECIALLY when the skill makes him no money at all?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Peanut<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;The Final Countdown is here!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join the &quot;Star Wars&quot; craze at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
