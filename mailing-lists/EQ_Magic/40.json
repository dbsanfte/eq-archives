The problem isn&#39;t &quot;if it doesn&#39;t hit, you<br/>\ndon&#39;t take damage&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;if it doesn&#39;t hit, your casting isn&#39;t<br/>\n*interrupted*!&quot; (which means life when fading out)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cloth armour is base armour found a many low lw MOBs like orc pawns, cents<br/>\n&gt; some skeletons<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By level 5, I had a full set of cloth on myself. I&#39;m now saving up to upgrade<br/>\nmy shirt to a Sr Apprentice Robe (same AC, additional mana) for level 7.<br/>\n(restarted recently. My soul didn&#39;t feel comfortable in a Dark Elf body)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; g......... armour can be won in najena<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Gossamer.

Say the word.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; l..... armour is similar but takes much more time to get<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lupine.

Fade and shadow step is<br/>\n&gt; some of this spells but from my experience after using this spell you<br/>\n&gt; finish dead as it teleports you 10 cm. from monster and before you can run<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It varies. In dungeons, it is great because it will teleport you on the other<br/>\nside of the wall. Better know your way then :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
