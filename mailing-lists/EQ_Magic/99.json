Such as changing someone&#39;s life energy into your life<br/>\nenergy thus the life-drain. Or giving life to something dead. Its only<br/>\nnatural that the necro would have figured out how to change his own life for<br/>\nmore of the mana that they covet so much. Wizards on the other hand do covet<br/>\nmana but is not a master of manipulating life energy. He turns mana into<br/>\nbrute force & damage its not subtle like necro&#39;s are think of a wizard as a<br/>\nbroadsword & a necro as a scalpel if a wizard tried this they might just<br/>\ntake all there life. A cleric on the other hand changes mana into life he&#39;s<br/>\nnot very good at taking it away or changing it into anything at all.<br/>\nMagicians change mana into objects they don&#39;t really manipulate life at all<br/>\neither. Enchanters are the masters of illusion no life manipulation there<br/>\neither. All other classes borrow spell from these classes. It was a bit long<br/>\nsorry but I think it is correct.<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Marziani, Michael D.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Marziani@...\">Michael.Marziani@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI have seen a lot about dark pact.  This spell is very cool,<br/>\nbut I question<br/>\n\t\twhy only the Necro has this ability.  In many games I have<br/>\nseen all kinds of<br/>\n\t\tmagic user classes with the ability to sacrifice hp to gain<br/>\nmana.  Does<br/>\n\t\tanyone have the background understanding of why this ability<br/>\nmight be necro<br/>\n\t\tonly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThanks for the info.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n\t\tLooking for a new hobby?
