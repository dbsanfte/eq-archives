I don&#39;t know about<br/>\nother people, but I want to feel like my time is well spent, like I&#39;m<br/>\naccomplishing something.  Creating an object that&#39;s worth less than its<br/>\ncomponents, not even considering the time spent, is not much of an<br/>\naccomplishment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the actual process were interesting or rewarding in some manner (as<br/>\ncreating pottery, jewelry, paintings, etc in real life can be), or the<br/>\nresulting product had some unique value other than the sum of its parts,<br/>\nthen I could see the accomplishment.  However, dropping items into a<br/>\ncontainer and hitting Combine just doesn&#39;t model the usual creative<br/>\nprocesses involved when creating these kinds of things in real life.  <br/>\nAnd<br/>\nthe resulting product doesn&#39;t have any unique value - your jade ring is<br/>\nno different from anyone else&#39;s jade ring.  There&#39;s just no place for <br/>\nart<br/>\nin the game, as there&#39;s no way to differentiate your piece from anyone<br/>\nelse&#39;s.  Everything you create is a commodity good - an unspecialized<br/>\nmass-produced product.  And skill doesn&#39;t enter it either, as it only<br/>\naffects the likelyhood of success; it doesn&#39;t result in a better quality<br/>\nproduct.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, although I agree that the game is supposed to be FUN, I just don&#39;t<br/>\nsee the fun in making a jade ring just like everyone else&#39;s jade ring,<br/>\nthat I then sell back to the vendor for less than it cost to make.  I<br/>\nspent time, and all I accomplished was to lose some money.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine if fighting were like this.  You run up to a goblin, miss every<br/>\nswing, take 5 damage, and then it disappears.  You spent time, and all<br/>\nyou accomplished was to lose some hit points.  Would you bother fighting<br/>\nmonsters then?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think _all_ the trade skills are pointless, though.  I&#39;ve had a<br/>\nlot of fun making and selling patchwork.  After doing that for awhile,<br/>\nthough, it does get boring, and there&#39;s nowhere to go from there.  There<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to be a market for studded leather, so, as I&#39;ve said above,<br/>\nit&#39;s no fun if all I do with it is sell it back to a vendor for a loss.<br/>\nSmithing looks fun once you can make something useful like banded armor,<br/>\nbut making files for days and days to get there isn&#39;t fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo sum up then, I&#39;d guess that no one wants to feel like they&#39;re wasting<br/>\ntheir time.  They want to feel like they&#39;re doing something rewarding <br/>\nand<br/>\nworthwhile, and for most of the trade skills, I just don&#39;t see anything<br/>\nrewarding about them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWill Day     &lt;PGP mail preferred&gt;     OIT / O&E / Technical Support<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:willday@...\">willday@...</a>            Georgia Tech, Atlanta 30332-0715<br/>\n  -&gt; Opinions expressed are mine alone and do not reflect OIT policy &lt;-<br/>\nThose who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little <br/>\ntemporary<br/>\nSafety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.<br/>\n    Benjamin Franklin, Pennsylvania Assembly, Nov. 11, 1755</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
