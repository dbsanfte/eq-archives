And *Poof* if you dont fail you get a new 16th lvl pet. Note <br/>\n&gt; I have not done this. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Expensive :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1) level 16 and 20 lvl pet are at merchants in certain cities.. (not <br/>\n&gt; going to tell ya in this email) So why would you make a pet from <br/>\n&gt; research. Are they the same?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Will everyone travel to all cities to collect all spells? :)<br/>\n(I assume that&#39;s the intent)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) Does this work for any level pet, ie 16 , 20, 24,? could you <br/>\n&gt; practice with, lets say a 12 lvl pet. ie 8th lvl pet +wot+ore = 12th lvl <br/>\n&gt; pet?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Will tell when I&#39;m at that level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) What monster have word of tyarany. I know random but which <br/>\n&gt; one in your experience.. which zones.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Too high for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6) ok on pet if what i have down so far is correct ie ( pet spell -<br/>\n&gt; 1rank+WOT+Regent) then for the  36th lvl pet spell you need to <br/>\n&gt; create a spell for a 32th lvl  pet.. This would take a 28th lvl pet which <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the complement to research is the ability to scribble spells. When<br/>\nyou research a spell and found one, you&#39;d better memorise it, then write it<br/>\nback on scrolls to re-use (and, of course, sell to other, lazier mages).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
