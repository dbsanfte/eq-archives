I got there around Level 16, and I am currently level 23","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1702937927\">Here is my 2 Cents regarding Druid Soloing :<br/>\n<br/>\nLake of Ill Omen is one of the best places for this.  I got there <br/>\naround Level 16, and I am currently level 23 (half away from 24), and <br/>\nit is awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must admit that at level 16, I grouped with others and killed <br/>\ngoblins and skels, and if we had a good group we did some Sarnark <br/>\nrecruits.  This got me easily to level 20.  After which I started <br/>\nsoloing more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Sabertooths in the Lake of Ill OMEN, these are my 2 main <br/>\nfighting styles:<br/>\n<br/>\nA) Cast Snare, Cast DOT (Damage over time spell) then run around, <br/>\nwhen DOT runs out, cast it again, maybe blast it with a Careless <br/>\nLightning here and there.  But mostly use your DOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nB) Cast DOT, Cast Snare, Cast FEAR ANIMAL, Run after the Sabertooth <br/>\nand wack it with your weapon, when your DOT/FEAR/SNARE runs out, <br/>\nrecast it, and continue till he is dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth the above work great, I find that RED&#39;s resist alittle to much, <br/>\nso I only stuck with Yellow and below.  Using your track, it is easy <br/>\nto find a lot of sabertooths floating around.  The best place for <br/>\nsolo&#39;n I think in Lake of Ill Omen is at a place they call the <br/>\nPILLARS, its easy to find, just give a shout, most people are nice <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry about banking, cuz you can just bind your self near a <br/>\nzone, either at Frontier Moutains Zone, or Fironia Vie Zone, and then <br/>\nTeleport over to ButcherBlock, do you banking, then Gate back and get <br/>\nback to killing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ever get bored here, just head on over to Warsilk Woods (its <br/>\nabout 1 er 2 zones away) and there is a great Giant Fort there.  I <br/>\nknow what you are thinking, GIANTS are you crazy, but I went over <br/>\nthere for a bit around level 20 - 22, and it is one of the safest <br/>\nspots I ever found, even though there is tonnes of Giants lurking <br/>\naround.  If you get into a group, the Fort layout is pretty simple, <br/>\nand the spawn points are easily visible, you can pull 1 at a time, <br/>\nand kick butt.  At level 20, most where Yellow or Above, some green, <br/>\nbut again, they it was easy to control the amount of Giants you pull <br/>\nto your group.  I think Solo&#39;n here might be easy as well, as the <br/>\nGiants usually stick to there spawn points, and only a few walk <br/>\naround.  Another great thing about this zone is that it is usually <br/>\nempty except fer 1 or 2 group killing giants (at least on Torv thats <br/>\nthe way it is)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, that is my opinion.  The first time I went to Kunark at <br/>\nLevel 16, I was very worried, but after gaining level 23 kind of <br/>\neasily (i believe i&#39;ve only died like 2 times), I think the next <br/>\ncharacter I make will be coming here as well.  Later all.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
