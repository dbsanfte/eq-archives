So dear friends finaly verant guys<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; found that death penality is too big in world where is so easy to die<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; by thousnds of random things wich can provoke it and if you must to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pass 3 zones to get your corpse i think that you will thing twice about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; daing a same mistake again. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I died so many times this weekend- it was pathetic and frustrating and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;had me seriously thinking about quitting the game altogether. I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;trying to solo in Crushbone and I only go out of the zone transition area<br/>\n&gt; &gt;once. The trains would come in, my pet and I could handle all the green<br/>\n&gt; &gt;orcs and then a slaver or taskmaster would show up and it was all over.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Since the only things I&#39;d been killing were green orcs, I was losing more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;experience than I was making. It was completely disheartening and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;finally went back to the Chessboard in Butcherblock to make up the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;experience I lost. I find the Chessboard sort of boring and it is not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;very good for loot either. In short, by getting killed three times, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lost all the experience I&#39;d made in a week and was driven to go fight in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;an area that didn&#39;t interest me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Which made the game not fun anymore. Luckily, I didn&#39;t make any rash<br/>\n&gt; &gt;decisions. I&#39;m level 10 and one of my goals in the game is to get to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level 20. Hopefully, this lowering of the death penalty will help me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;accomplish this goal with the minimum amount of frustration and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;maximum amount of fun.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anya<br/>\n&gt; &gt;High Elf Magician<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Silverion<br/>\n&gt; High elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n&gt; Fenin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; moderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> Are you?
