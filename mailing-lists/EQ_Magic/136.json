Why he do this is of many reasons to help his<br/>\n&gt;&gt;greed for immense power?, wish to help a weak ones or any other reason it is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not important now but all wizards try to do this.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;To be able to do this he is a god land traveler, he can unleash a nice <br/>\n&gt;power in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;combat and he can see things from long away. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I divide a letter from here on in 3 parts<br/>\n&gt;&gt;1st is my propose,  what to change so that our class can better execute our<br/>\n&gt;&gt;role in world of North<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2nd is what explanation of what I see that we are now <br/>\n&gt;&gt; 3rd  is spell grouping <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;1. -------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;As I see our class must combat to get <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a.) better run from combat teleport spells - shadow step with minimum range -<br/>\n&gt;&gt;faster gate - second bind point (in zone only) it can be some type of faster<br/>\n&gt;&gt;gate for run from combat spells<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you give a second bind point to wizards then all other magi or clerical<br/>\n&gt;casters deserve one too.

In reference to your rationale, well in combat other<br/>\n&gt;classes can&#39;t cast as damaging spells or as fast as you can.  Also to<br/>\n&gt;recover the mana from a pet requires the waastage of one of the 8 spell<br/>\n&gt;slots and it isn&#39;t a very mana efficient operation in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes but you can see that you summon a pet sit meditate your mana back and<br/>\npet will stay with you as long as it will not die you can hunt in one zone<br/>\ntwo days if you wish. and when meditate to get mana back you cancel a pet<br/>\nslot end put in one other spell :-). You will enter in combat with a full<br/>\nmana and probably many buffs on your pet and on yourself and your party<br/>\nmembers it is all count at your mana. if you cont all benefits and how long<br/>\nit can work you will se that wizard have need to recover faster he cannot<br/>\naccumulate mana in long duration spells, pets or buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;e.) one thing which is not wizard specific but influence us, is to make a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;meditation more diversifying I wish to play a game not to stay looking all <br/>\n&gt;time<br/>\n&gt;&gt;in same page or go in WC, kitchen when I meditate it will be nice to have <br/>\n&gt;&gt;- internal email system<br/>\n&gt;&gt;- two chat windows so that I can access general all server chat same one<br/>\n </span></blockquote>which<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;we can go in from server screen in one window and to hear what going on in <br/>\n&gt;game<br/>\n&gt;&gt;in other window<br/>\n&gt;&gt;- in game class oriented mailing lists<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;2.----<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Silverlock,  ICQ 474725\t\t\t<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Household Pests?
