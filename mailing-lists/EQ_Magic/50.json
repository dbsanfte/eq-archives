My roommate and I were playing EQ (2 accounts 2 pc&#39;s) He is <br/>\na Highelf Wizard and im a wood elf ranger...well AT MY OWN GUILDHOUSE in <br/>\nkelethin i was getting ripped off!  We have the same charisma (80) and he <br/>\nwas getting stuff for about 5sp to 1gp cheaper!  WTF?<br/>\nIs there some logical explanination for this? (we were both 3rd level and <br/>\ndindt have much of a faction adjustment quite yet)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Merchants are racists. Even in your guildhouse do they rip you. Over the<br/>\n&gt;8th level spells, I spare almost a platinum by going back to Felwithe<br/>\n&gt;over the Freeport prices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
