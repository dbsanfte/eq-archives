I liked to start this thread as I see that many<br/>\npeople don∩┐╜t understand what is a idea for a wizard class is in Everquest and<br/>\nwhat is to be changed so that we can be better in our role. So here is a my<br/>\nlook on this maybe I∩┐╜m wrong but that is why we are here ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard is a master Explorer he looks for a knowledge about world, magic, items<br/>\nand people all around a world. Why he do this is of many reasons to help his<br/>\ngreed for immense power?, wish to help a weak ones or any other reason it is<br/>\nnot important now but all wizards try to do this.<br/>\nTo be able to do this he is a god land traveler, he can unleash a nice power in<br/>\ncombat and he can see things from long away. <br/>\n<br/>\nI divide a letter from here on in 3 parts<br/>\n1st is my propose,  what to change so that our class can better execute our<br/>\nrole in world of North<br/>\n 2nd is what explanation of what I see that we are now <br/>\n 3rd  is spell grouping <br/>\n<br/>\n1. -------<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I see our class must combat to get <br/>\n<br/>\na.) better run from combat teleport spells - shadow step with minimum range -<br/>\nfaster gate - second bind point (in zone only) it can be some type of faster<br/>\ngate for run from combat spells<br/>\n<br/>\nb.) Better exploration spells like invisible eye of zoom with longer duration.<br/>\n<br/>\nc.) Item locator. As we are item hunters we can have a spell which can function<br/>\nas ranger tracker for items in zone so we can see all items in zone and we can<br/>\nturn in direction where item is !! <br/>\n<br/>\nd.) faster mana recovery then other classes - ( or by higher meditation limit<br/>\nlets say (level +1) * 7 or by specific items wizard only later in game) - why<br/>\nthis you can ask. because in combat other classes have a mana battery which is<br/>\na pet it can defend, attack and also sacrifice and many more long duration<br/>\nbuffing spells.<br/>\n<br/>\ne.) one thing which is not wizard specific but influence us, is to make a<br/>\nmeditation more diversifying I wish to play a game not to stay looking all time<br/>\nin same page or go in WC, kitchen when I meditate it will be nice to have <br/>\n- internal email system<br/>\n- two chat windows so that I can access general all server chat same one which<br/>\nwe can go in from server screen in one window and to hear what going on in game<br/>\nin other window<br/>\n- in game class oriented mailing lists<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2.----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- He is a weakest class in all Norath looking at hit points,  but he is a major<br/>\ndestructive power in game also.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Wizard casts Direct Damage DD spells faster than anyone else and with more<br/>\nforce than anyone else. We as a class get a DD spell EVERY level and we have a<br/>\nbest mana damage ratio on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Wizards have a experience diminution I don∩┐╜t know how much for sure but it is<br/>\nnear 10 - 15 %.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Wizards are very weak at start and at lv 20 start to be traveler and only at<br/>\nlv 34 + start to be a force in all ways from solo to group play with all line<br/>\nof plane travel and group rescue spells.<br/>\n( you see that a spells go from a 5 (1 lv.)- 15 (4 lv) - 35 (8 lv) - 80 (12 lv)<br/>\n- 105 (16 lv) all times mana gives you cc. 5 shots before go out of mana OOM<br/>\nwhen you go up in lv you get a some additional roots in)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Wizard combat definition is major damage in shortest time! <br/>\n- Enchanter goes with more suptile tactic with pet, weaking enemy or charming<br/>\n        - necromancer rely on his strong pet and Damage Over Time spells DOT<br/>\nwhere he is a master this spells do in time much more damage then DD spells of<br/>\nwizards but..)<br/>\n- Magician is support ( food, bandages, heatstone etc )and (now reinforced) pet<br/>\nman.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3.-------<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard spells can be divided in <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat related <br/>\n<br/>\n- Damage<br/>\n- Defense<br/>\n- Root<br/>\n<br/>\nUtility<br/>\n<br/>\n- Teleports<br/>\n- spying<br/>\n- item lore<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat related <br/>\n<br/>\nDamage spells<br/>\n<br/>\nShock - guided<br/>\nBolt - unguided<br/>\nArea Effect spells<br/>\n-- Based on target<br/>\n-- Based on caster<br/>\n<br/>\nDefense<br/>\n<br/>\nShield self only ac + magic resistance +<br/>\nskin - shieldskin ... damage absorption spells HP plus protect from<br/>\ninterrupting spells<br/>\n<br/>\nRoot<br/>\n<br/>\nroot - block target movement<br/>\n<br/>\nUtility<br/>\n<br/>\nTeleports<br/>\n<br/>\nGate - personal travel<br/>\nFade - shadow step - personal run from combat<br/>\nPortal  group teleport<br/>\nEvacuate group rescue - group run<br/>\nPlane travel<br/>\n<br/>\nSpying<br/>\n<br/>\nEye of zoom ∩┐╜<br/>\nGlimpse ∩┐╜ <br/>\n<br/>\nItem lore <br/>\n<br/>\nSense magic<br/>\nIdentify<br/>\n<br/>\nOther utility<br/>\n<br/>\nInvisibility<br/>\nSense summoned<br/>\nlight spells<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
