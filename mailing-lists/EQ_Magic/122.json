I was &quot;icing&quot; a Sand Scarab, as usual, but<br/>\n&gt;the Monk I team with forgot at the beginning to click on its auto attack, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;was only using its special attacks. After the 2nd Shock of Ice, the Scarab<br/>\n&gt;dropped all and ran straight to me... I had to fight it staff to claw, and<br/>\n&gt;repeatedly attempt to go a spell thru... I managed it, but barely)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dont give it credit.  also, necros have some pretty versatile spells, <br/>\n&gt;such<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as dark empathy (healing), dark pact series (gives us more mana- good <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; extended fights), and such.  we also get many spells that cannot be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resisted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Necros are combos casters. Nothing they do is impressive in it, but the<br/>\n&gt;association is a LOT more impressive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Vincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Tel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;         01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to &quot;Trail Rider,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
