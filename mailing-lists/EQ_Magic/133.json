Tons of centurions spawn there and on the other side of the river <br/>\nand whenever I would get attacked by a larger creature by pet would buy me <br/>\nthose few precious seconds for me to make it to the zone.  Besides if <br/>\nsomething big enough to kill you wanders here it is already part of a train <br/>\nso you dont have to worry about people getting mad for training to zone. Also <br/>\nif someone shouts train to zone or something to that extent feel free to jump <br/>\nin the river and hide there is nothing shameful about not standing up to <br/>\ncreatures 6 levels above you. Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dracor</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
