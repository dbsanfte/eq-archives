Since when any decent follower of Solusek Ro has been afraid<br/>\nto take risks? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; came near you) if 2 monsters go on you you cant cast any spell and they eat<br/>\n&gt; you so fast... Spells at first fail after that they start to get some punch<br/>\n&gt; but monsters also get much more punch. and when you think you finaly can<br/>\n&gt; have some realible spells all a new with new ciklus of spells. mana<br/>\n&gt; meditating and running to recover corpse as your warrior friends thinked<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty good at running :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, I just did a little experiment with a northern valkyrie (north<br/>\nbarbarian). I was level 2, and in a spot where monsters spawned at a blink<br/>\nrate (one every 15 s or so). I stayed at a tiny smudge of the full life total<br/>\n(about 5HP) while bashing monsters. I was 2 bubbles away from 3, and finally<br/>\ndied when I was 1 bubble into level 3... One to three monsters were bashing on<br/>\nme permanently. I even hadn&#39;t time to loot the corpses.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake me want to try my next life as a Troll Warrior :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that you will resist this little 2 orcs a bit longer, is a life of a<br/>\n&gt; wizard. I hope that at last in later lv somone will call i need a wizard in<br/>\n&gt; group now ( less then 16 lv ) i never seen anyone searching for a wizard<br/>\n&gt; clerics, paladins, druids are all time requested so calling healing classes<br/>\n&gt; we nukers are out of game for now  sight sight (strange bards are more<br/>\n&gt; requestesd in group and they have better solo play then wizards)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Buffs. All their efforts go into making tanks stronger, when those efforts<br/>\nwould be better invested in making monsters dead in the first place :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat changes as levels increase. There are monsters with high ACs, so even<br/>\nhigh-level warriors have problems hitting them. But nuking works fine, the<br/>\nmonster&#39;s magic resistance doesn&#39;t differ much. I spent time on sunday in<br/>\na party with two wizards, 1 cleric, 1 paladin, and 2 magicians whose pets<br/>\nserved as aux. tanks. The only hard spots for us was when there was more<br/>\nthan 8 monsters at a time on us... That&#39;s when some started to get<br/>\ninterested in the wizards... Woops. Time to Fade/Shadow Step... (the range<br/>\nintervenes when the monsters select a target, so when they get interested in<br/>\nyou, Shadow Step moves you out of range, they lose interest, and you can get<br/>\nback in range for Shocks but you have to know the local area well to find out<br/>\nwhere you are and get quickly back in range)<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who think all they need is tanks and healers haven&#39;t invested much<br/>\nin the way of IQ levels :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
