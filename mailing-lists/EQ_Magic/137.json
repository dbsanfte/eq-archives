Just like adding nice items to a <br/>\ncollection.  Do not tell me it is unfair you must do so, because the same <br/>\nargument applies to everything else.  Do you intend to wear cloth armor and <br/>\nuse non magical items for your entire career?  No, add nicer things a piece <br/>\nat a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nKalleon Valkyrre<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
