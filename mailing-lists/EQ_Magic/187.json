Reason being is I despise being trained and if you<br/>\nhave a pissed of critter running after you, you might tank it onto someone else.<br/>\nAlso, kiting stuff is pretty dull.  In the amount of time I kite something, a group<br/>\ncan usually bring down the same thing a few times.  For example, I could kite a<br/>\ndeepwater caiman easy, but a group of 3 could kill at least 2 to my 1.  In my eyes,<br/>\nkiting just isn&#39;t worth it unless you&#39;re kitting for wealth over xp gain.<br/>\n<br/>\nKlaine, 15th shaman<br/>\nThomarus, 5th enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I realy dont like kitting it is from my opinion a serious bug in a<br/>\n&gt; Artifical inteligence program! I see druids kitting all times around<br/>\n&gt; wizards waiting in najena for a Jboots all with idea to go kitte something<br/>\n&gt; and get exp fast!
