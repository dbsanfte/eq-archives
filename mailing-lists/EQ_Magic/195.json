Here&#39;s an excerpt from <br/>\nthe original post followed by Brad&#39;s complete response: <br/>\nI understand your point about kill stealing the OTHER way (ie groups <br/>\nstealing from individuals) I don&#39;t believe it could be as serious a <br/>\nproblem as currently individual casters stealing from groups. The <br/>\nreason is simple, your developers obviously have taken great pains to <br/>\nmake this a group oriented game so given the choice I would favor the <br/>\ngroups. To favor only certain classes in their ability to solo is a <br/>\nserious imbalance. Going the other way simply levels the playing field <br/>\nfor all. <br/>\nHrm. Maybe we&#39;ll try it the group aggregate damage way, and see how <br/>\npeople like it and whether it helps with kill stealing or not. I&#39;ll <br/>\njust make sure my programmer comments out the old code so he can put it <br/>\nback if necessary :) <br/>\nGive us a few weeks and I&#39;ll try to get this change implemented on a <br/>\ntrial basis. <br/>\n-Brad <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: wizard <br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 08, 1999 11:31 AM<br/>\nTo: .EQ.Magic<br/>\nCc: wizard<br/>\nSubject: Re: [_EQ_Magic] Kitting and magic<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 15.51 07/07/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have noticed quit a few people kiting in Oasis, the general response <br/>\n&gt;from the public is to just steal their kills (which is pretty easy <br/>\n </span></blockquote>with <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;them running all over the place).
