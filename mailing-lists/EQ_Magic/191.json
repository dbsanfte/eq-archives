In beta there","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1171274977\">Very big problem is that verant dont have a time to balance classes and<br/>\nraces and whole game to be exact for high lv thet mean after lv 29 -30. In<br/>\nbeta there vere not enough people at high lv to make a exact balancing and<br/>\nuntil one month ago some high lv dungeons in game where with monsters<br/>\nwithout loot you can see that a lady vox a mighty dragon is even now tuned<br/>\nin. So after lv 20 wizards were untuned, what you can se with problems with<br/>\nlv 20 spells.<br/>\nMany players in beta jumper right from lv 10 15 to lv 40 to be able to test<br/>\nhigh lv but they nevarly never arived normaly at lv 50. only 2 guys using<br/>\nsome not so legal techicues made it very fast to get at high lv. so normal<br/>\nbalancing of high lv classes was never made and we see it proces now in<br/>\nlast patchs. Wizards have a right to have its share of funn in game if they<br/>\nare weak at start they have right to be relatyve strong at end of game.<br/>\nThey are now not masters of DD spels as max lv spell is not in game, hiden<br/>\nspells are to god hiden and they also are not masters of transport and they<br/>\nhave very anoying time needing to meditate much more of other classes and<br/>\nare much easier to die depending of power of their spells, and low<br/>\ndefences. They are better balanced that some other classes, and are not<br/>\nweakest class in game but they need some retouch and im sure many other<br/>\nclasses need retouch in need to follow idea what verant put in front of<br/>\nclass its group roles and overall game play and time needed to get to max<br/>\npower lv it is valid for all classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 16.11 07/07/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think the whole point is the game is oriented and balanced towards <br/>\n&gt;groups.  Trying to hold up the pluses and minuses of an individual <br/>\n&gt;class is pointless as they are each designed to be compensated by <br/>\n&gt;another. Pennaggolan has it right and we need to view the complementary <br/>\n&gt;benefits of each class in determining its abilities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Plus after 20 Wizards don&#39;t need to ride that damn boat and that alone <br/>\n&gt;makes them worthwhile.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Merauk<br/>\n&gt;21 Enchanter<br/>\n&gt;Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: croesus <br/>\n&gt;Sent: Friday, July 02, 1999 8:13 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: .EQ.Magic<br/>\n&gt;Cc: croesus<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [_EQ_Magic] Wizards<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Silverlock &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:croesus@...\">croesus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 01:21 PM 7/2/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Until you get an overpull. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: Dan Alexander &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dalex@...\">dalex@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;At 01:29 PM 07/02/1999 -0400, you wrote: <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;You really don&#39;t get it that Wizard&#39;s are group only.
