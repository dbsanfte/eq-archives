I feel (and<br/>\nthis is my own personal ethic here) that it is of questionable ethics to<br/>\ncharge for this service. A few reasons for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. When the person camps, the food is going to disappear, so it is not<br/>\nreally, IMHO, a tangible sellable object.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I feel I have an obligation to help other &quot;good&quot; races in their<br/>\nendevours. Providing free food and water is an easy way to do this,<br/>\nespecially when hunting out in an area removed from civilization.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. When I am in a jam, I don&#39;t want to be expected to pay for help.<br/>\nLikewise, when others are in a jam, I do not want to charge<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not gotten the Bind Affinity spell yet and have not decided how I<br/>\nwill handle that. I think that can be looked at differently, since it is a<br/>\nhuge mana soak and it is something that makes someone&#39;s life easier. It is<br/>\nnot a bare necessity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe going rate I have seen for binding tends to fall in the 5g.<br/>\nneighborhood, although I have seen people advertising to do it for a plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the 5th level Barbarian Shaman, I will cast buffs and heals for free<br/>\nand often unsolicited. A little random kindness and all of that. It also<br/>\nhelps me practice my spells and gain goodwill in what can be a fairly<br/>\nrough neighborhood for a newbie.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents.. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
