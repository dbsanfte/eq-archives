<b>Subject:</b> The new enchantment spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-763265718">I would just like to know where these two new spells are, how much they<br/>
are, what levels, and what cost.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard online about the brownies, but since I never had a high<br/>
enough faction with them (at least they won&#39;t kill me with gnome illusion<br/>
and alliance) I cannot see if this is true.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
