spend there from my 6 to 11 lv i know it very vell moust important is to<br/>
move from a entrance tunel it is a train magnet. You must find any place<br/>
out of trains rutes. some places at slaver huts are safe. If you can say<br/>

&gt;&gt; I like this one very very much !! So dear friends finaly verant guys found<br/>
&gt;&gt; that death penality is too big in world where is so easy to die by thousnds<br/>
&gt;&gt; of random things wich can provoke it and if you must to pass 3 zones to get<br/>
&gt;&gt; your corpse i think that you will thing twice about daing a same mistake<br/>
&gt;&gt; again. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I died so many times this weekend- it was pathetic and frustrating and had<br/>
&gt;me seriously thinking about quitting the game altogether. I was trying to<br/>
&gt;solo in Crushbone and I only go out of the zone transition area once. The<br/>
&gt;trains would come in, my pet and I could handle all the green orcs and<br/>
&gt;then a slaver or taskmaster would show up and it was all over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Since the only things I&#39;d been killing were green orcs, I was losing more<br/>
&gt;experience than I was making. It was completely disheartening and I<br/>
&gt;finally went back to the Chessboard in Butcherblock to make up the<br/>
&gt;experience I lost. I find the Chessboard sort of boring and it is not very<br/>
&gt;good for loot either. In short, by getting killed three times, I&#39;d lost<br/>
&gt;all the experience I&#39;d made in a week and was driven to go fight in an<br/>
&gt;area that didn&#39;t interest me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Which made the game not fun anymore. Luckily, I didn&#39;t make any rash<br/>
&gt;decisions. I&#39;m level 10 and one of my goals in the game is to get to level<br/>
&gt;20. Hopefully, this lowering of the death penalty will help me accomplish<br/>
&gt;this goal with the minimum amount of frustration and the maximum amount of<br/>
&gt;fun.<br/>
