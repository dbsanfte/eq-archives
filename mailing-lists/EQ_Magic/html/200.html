<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026519333">You may have already discussed this I just joined and didn&#39;t read<br/>
the archives, but is it true that on the race war server spells will be<br/>
lootable?, if so Could I persuade you folks to /feedback that to balance<br/>
this the contents of containers should be lootable as well, and/or that the<br/>
spell book should be a physical item (maybe given a special slot) but one<br/>
that can not be destroyed or dropped, and when you put it in the bank you<br/>
would not be able to use magic.  This would fix some of the imbalances such<br/>
as non-magic classes being able to put their weapon/armor in a container if<br/>
it looks like they will lose a fight, and their ability to put everything in<br/>
the bank for a dangerous trip.</div>
