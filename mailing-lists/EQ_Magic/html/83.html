&gt; Hmm, I&#39;m still trying to figure out exactly where the fun is in spending<br/>
&gt; lots of time creating (seemingly) worthless objects.  I don&#39;t know about<br/>
&gt; other people, but I want to feel like my time is well spent, like I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; accomplishing something.  Creating an object that&#39;s worth less than its<br/>
&gt; components, not even considering the time spent, is not much of an<br/>
&gt; accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I&#39;m hoping that I lucked into one of the only truly cool trade<br/>
skills, which can make things that can not be found anywhere else, (i.e.<br/>
goggles that let humans see perfectly at night, shirts that raise cold<br/>
resistences, collapsable fishing poles, you know important stuff). The<br/>
skill? Tinkering, which I&#39;ve seen no one do yet, so I&#39;ll post when all the<br/>
humans can come buy my goggles. Or when you can get some fireworks from me.<br/>
