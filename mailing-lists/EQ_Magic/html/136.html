&gt;&gt;greed for immense power?, wish to help a weak ones or any other reason it is<br/>
&gt;&gt;not important now but all wizards try to do this.<br/>
&gt;&gt;To be able to do this he is a god land traveler, he can unleash a nice <br/>
&gt;power in<br/>
&gt;&gt;combat and he can see things from long away. <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I divide a letter from here on in 3 parts<br/>
&gt;&gt;1st is my propose,  what to change so that our class can better execute our<br/>
&gt;&gt;role in world of North<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2nd is what explanation of what I see that we are now <br/>
&gt;&gt; 3rd  is spell grouping <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;1. -------<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;As I see our class must combat to get <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;a.) better run from combat teleport spells - shadow step with minimum range -<br/>
&gt;&gt;faster gate - second bind point (in zone only) it can be some type of faster<br/>
&gt;&gt;gate for run from combat spells<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you give a second bind point to wizards then all other magi or clerical<br/>
&gt;casters deserve one too. This would in effect give you &quot;recall&quot; which Verant<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t want. Nor do I actually.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I say bind point wich will function in same zone only and as you zone out<br/>
it will be canceled.<br/>
Other limitation idea can be a spell component i suggest it as a run from<br/>
combat spell so it can also teleport to zone entrance . <br/>
Cleric have a invulnerability spell to run from combat, all other magi can<br/>
use his pet as monster slowing factor and have gate. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;b.) Better exploration spells like invisible eye of zoom with longer<br/>
 </span></blockquote>duration.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;c.) Item locator. As we are item hunters we can have a spell which can <br/>
&gt;function<br/>
&gt;&gt;as ranger tracker for items in zone so we can see all items in zone and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we can<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;turn in direction where item is !! <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If this spell belongs to anyone it should be Enchanters, thsoe who create,<br/>
&gt;alter and destroy artifacts and items.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wizards are one wich are specific as item hunter similar to ranger wich is<br/>
animal hunter so i think that it can be wizard only but also can be<br/>
included in enchanter spells but i think that enchanters have many group<br/>
oriented spells and a wizard is nearly without similar spells until a group<br/>
teleports and escape.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;d.) faster mana recovery then other classes - ( or by higher meditation limit<br/>
&gt;&gt;lets say (level +1) * 7 or by specific items wizard only later in game) - why<br/>
&gt;&gt;this you can ask. because in combat other classes have a mana battery<br/>
 </span></blockquote>which is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;a pet it can defend, attack and also sacrifice and many more long duration<br/>
&gt;&gt;buffing spells.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again there is no legitimate reason for thsi to be asked for especially as a<br/>
&gt;class specific thing.  In reference to your rationale, well in combat other<br/>
&gt;classes can&#39;t cast as damaging spells or as fast as you can.  Also to<br/>
&gt;recover the mana from a pet requires the waastage of one of the 8 spell<br/>
&gt;slots and it isn&#39;t a very mana efficient operation in the first place. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes but you can see that you summon a pet sit meditate your mana back and<br/>
pet will stay with you as long as it will not die you can hunt in one zone<br/>
two days if you wish. and when meditate to get mana back you cancel a pet<br/>
slot end put in one other spell :-). You will enter in combat with a full<br/>
mana and probably many buffs on your pet and on yourself and your party<br/>
members it is all count at your mana. if you cont all benefits and how long<br/>
it can work you will se that wizard have need to recover faster he cannot<br/>
accumulate mana in long duration spells, pets or buffs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;e.) one thing which is not wizard specific but influence us, is to make a<br/>
&gt;&gt;meditation more diversifying I wish to play a game not to stay looking all <br/>
&gt;time<br/>
&gt;&gt;in same page or go in WC, kitchen when I meditate it will be nice to have <br/>
&gt;&gt;- internal email system<br/>
&gt;&gt;- two chat windows so that I can access general all server chat same one<br/>
 </span></blockquote>which<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;we can go in from server screen in one window and to hear what going on in <br/>
&gt;game<br/>
&gt;&gt;in other window<br/>
