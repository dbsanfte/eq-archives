<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742303291">According to Wizard:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Whow cleric is just great to have in group if you find any other you can go<br/>
&gt; to area just before slavers huts and hunt things there (DONT HIT SLAVERS<br/>
&gt; until with strong group) and you can hit orcs wich respawn near mountain<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Slaver can be had. We were once there:<br/>
	1 level 8 magician<br/>
	1 level 7 druid<br/>
	1 level 7 rogue<br/>
	1 level 9 warrior<br/>
<br/>
We could tackle one slaver without too much problem. Nearly died when two<br/>
slavers spawned at the same time. But we were working great together, and<br/>
the magician leader was very experienced and able.<br/>
