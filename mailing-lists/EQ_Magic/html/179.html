<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-322411336">This petition of yours is very interesting, and I must say that I fully<br/>
support your idea on making the monsters resists a bit lower, since<br/>
those spells do use up a lot of mana, and even if the melee classes<br/>
miss as much as the spells are resisted, they dont spend resources like<br/>
mana when fighting.  However, it is my firm believe that this is about<br/>
it.  I play more than one character, and let me tell you that when the<br/>
game is properly played, the wizards are far from being the class that<br/>
dies the most (the tanks are the ones that run the highest risk,<br/>
particularly the &quot;puller&quot;).  You see, as wizards, you are not supposed<br/>
to use the strongest spells until the monsters are at less than half<br/>
health.  You should blast them moderately as the tanks pick at them and<br/>
taunt, to keep the mosters busy.  You should do moderate blasts in<br/>
between the work of the tanks until the MOB is down to half health. <br/>
Now blast away.  That way, even if you do a LOT of sudden damage, you<br/>
still havent done most, so the MOb won&#39;t fall into you instantly.  Let<br/>
the tanks take the blow as you stand back.  Since I have played many<br/>
sides of this (I have a ranger, this necro, a wiz, and a druid), I<br/>
should also give this suggestion to wizard players:  &quot;If the MOB starts<br/>
to hit on you, DON&#39;T RUN!!&quot;.  This will make it impossible for the<br/>
tanks to get the MOB off.  At best, try to root him, or better yet, if<br/>
there is a ranger or druid with you, make them cast snare instead of<br/>
root.  Has higher success rate, and is overall more reliable.  The<br/>
cleric (or druid or shaman) can heal you and the tanks do better work<br/>
if they dont have to chase after a monster while contending with PL and<br/>
other mean variables.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, a few improvements can be<br/>
made on the classes, but the game has achieved quite a striking balance<br/>
once it is played in a group, as opposed to soloing.  Remember, this is<br/>
an online game; if you prefer to solo, this is not the game to play. <br/>
You should look out for Baldur&#39;s Gate, or Might and Magic and their<br/>
ilk, not for a game in which grouping and cooperation is the key.<br/>
