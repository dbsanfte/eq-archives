<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602329441">According to Jason Kelley:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ive just hit level 12 with my human magician and was wondering if<br/>
&gt; someone could tell me what a good creature is to kill loot and<br/>
&gt; experience wise at this level?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wisps. If you&#39;re on the East Coast, try hitting the West Commonlands<br/>
(lotsa wisps). If you&#39;re on the West Coast, jump on the Qeynos-Erudin<br/>
boat and land on Kerra Isle. Summon your trustworthy magic weapon,<br/>
and you&#39;re set.<br/>
<br/>
West Commonlands has a good supply of wisps, plus some additional<br/>
excitements, such as young kodiaks and the occasional kill-stomp<br/>
giants and griffins, while Kerra Isle is boringly monotonous (one<br/>
main spawn point for wisps, with a cycle of four wisps, a second<br/>
somewhere else, with one wisp for the same duration. Don&#39;t touch<br/>
the beetles, the Kerrans kill you for this, don&#39;t touch the spiders<br/>
they all gang on you, and there are lots).<br/>
<br/>
If you play off-hours (not during prime time), Kerra Isle is sometimes<br/>
desert, so you can hog the two spawn points all by yourself. If you<br/>
have other wisps hunters, rotate the spawn point, or alternate between<br/>
the spawn and the zombie sailors in the water.<br/>
<br/>
An enchanter friend spent the entire level 12 & 13 there, levelling<br/>
each day (playing three-four hours), and getting about 40pp/level.<br/>
