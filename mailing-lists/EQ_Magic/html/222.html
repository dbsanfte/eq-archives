<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060996785">Hehehe Our level 26 wizard (at the time) completed this quest. It was <br/>
incredible that he managed to get all those spokes....he went through Neriak <br/>
3rd gate (Dangerous for an erudite) and lower guk...all the nasty places, <br/>
and got his quest completed within hours =) So it is possible to do it at <br/>
mid levels as well =)<br/>

It is yes Ice Comet.<br/>
<br/>
In short a long, complicated, and quite worthwhile<br/>
quest for those few wizards who have reached 49th<br/>
level. Now that you&#39;ve done it, pray that you have a<br/>
high enough research skill, and a good roll of the<br/>
dice :)</div>
