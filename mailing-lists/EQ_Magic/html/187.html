<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-132605912">Well, my main character is a shaman so the potential for kiting is there, but I<br/>
tend not to kite very much.  Reason being is I despise being trained and if you<br/>
have a pissed of critter running after you, you might tank it onto someone else.<br/>
Also, kiting stuff is pretty dull.  In the amount of time I kite something, a group<br/>
can usually bring down the same thing a few times.  For example, I could kite a<br/>
deepwater caiman easy, but a group of 3 could kill at least 2 to my 1.  In my eyes,<br/>
kiting just isn&#39;t worth it unless you&#39;re kitting for wealth over xp gain.<br/>
