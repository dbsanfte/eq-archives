&gt; &gt; i remember lvl  10 and 11 as a magician. I would say that CB is not the answer. I suggest you go<br/>
&gt; &gt; to steamfont on the hill pass the windmill.  Kill drakes, (let  pet take<br/>
&gt; &gt; the heat, and use fireshield on the pet. give hime a +10 sv fire),<br/>
&gt; &gt; harpys,elementals, and watch out for HERO. I blew throught 10 and<br/>
&gt; &gt; 11 in 3 days or about 10hr 1bar /hour.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for this advice and to all the others who have given me really<br/>
&gt; excellent advice on how/what to hunt and how to get away. (I especially<br/>
&gt; like the jump in the river option.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I play on Rallos Zek and until moving into Steamfont I never had any<br/>
&gt; problems with Pkers, since most of them seem to be driven by profit and<br/>
&gt; magicians tend not to have valuable items the way other classes do. Last<br/>
&gt; night, I was PK&#39;d once and had several other attempts made. I was also the<br/>
&gt; victim of attempted extortion (by another High Elf, of all things,<br/>
&gt; demanding taxes for travelling in &quot;her lands&quot;, if you can believe that.),<br/>
&gt; which I am happy to say failed because of a very nice 12th level gnome<br/>
&gt; magician who was helping me out.It seems Steamfont is under the control of<br/>
&gt; a PK guild and is not the safest place for a High Elf.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am considering starting another magician on another server, so that when<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t feel like playing with bullies who are going to beat me up and<br/>
&gt; take my lunch money, I won&#39;t have to. :) Can anyone recommend a good<br/>
&gt; server, one that has some serious role-players and a minimum amount of<br/>
&gt; jerks?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
