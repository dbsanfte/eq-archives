<div id="ygrps-yiv-154966621">I&#39;m guessing from the story is that the human wizard is not as practiced<br/>
at channeling or the specific spell type he was trying to cast.  I say<br/>
this because when I first learned Invis. it was very hard to cast at<br/>
first, but as I gained skill in the type of spell it is (forget), I could<br/>
cast it without or little fizzling.<br/>

Oh, and am I in the right list?  Magician? I swear the list dealt with<br/>
pure spell casting groups.<br/>

&gt; I play a high elf wizard and i was gruped with a human wizard, we were both<br/>
&gt; 13 lv and i see that he fizzles much much more and many times his spells<br/>
&gt; are resisted? we are same lv and class only race is diferent we both have<br/>
&gt; our skills maxed from chanaling to evocation and so on. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; maybe our stats affect the spells resistance i thing that wisdom can be<br/>
&gt; very important factor in this? or it is dexterity? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone other have a similar experience? <br/>
