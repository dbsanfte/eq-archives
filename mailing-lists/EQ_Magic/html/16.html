<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421708720">According to Trevor K. Wagner:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My experience is that it takes about half of what the spell costs, although<br/>
&gt; I have no real statistical data to back this statement up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s also what I constated. It was pretty evident when I got Gate at<br/>
level 4A; I tried it once, fizzle and two bubbles were gone. I tried it again<br/>
and got the message &quot;Insufficient Mana&quot;. The spell worked when I<br/>
was almost at the end of the fourth bubble.<br/>
