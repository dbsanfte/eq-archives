<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; economy that makes EQ interesting.  In fact they even note in the <br/>
&gt; instructions that certain vendors will pay more for you goods then <br/>
&gt; others (town vendors versus vendors out in the wilderness).  What I <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tip 1: Sell in town rather than outside<br/>
<br/>
Tip 2: Sell to vendors that /con you better (neutral as opposed to<br/>
	threatiningly or some such)<br/>
<br/>
Tip 3: Sell in your guild (they /con warmly, usually)<br/>
<br/>
Tip 4: Sell in your home area<br/>
<br/>
Tip 5: Due to a bug, if you&#39;re a high elf, sell in Wood elfland; they<br/>
	like you better there :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sell for a profit.  While I can appreciate Verant&#39;s attempt to create a <br/>
&gt; totally player driven economy; one should be able to make a minimal <br/>
&gt; living dealing with NPC&#39;s to some extent (with the exception of <br/>
&gt; fishing).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not the intent. Verant didn&#39;t want to repeat the Ultima Offline<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In particular the creation of magic jewelry kills me.  I create <br/>
&gt; something for 5.5PP, sell it to a vendor for 4.5PP, he in turn marks it <br/>
&gt; up to 98PP.  You should at least be able to recover your initial <br/>
&gt; investment on these trade skills (not to mention the fact all the money <br/>
&gt; lost on failures).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Note that none of the items players create exist otherwise (i.e. you can&#39;t<br/>
make straight leather, chain, plate, or anything else). Which means the<br/>
market for these items isn&#39;t supposed to be the NPC, it&#39;s supposed to be<br/>
the OTHER players.  Never sell to NPCs what you can sell to players.<br/>

Ultannis, Wizard starting to ponder what trade skill he should take,<br/>
apart from its fishing hobby whenever waiting for that damned boat<br/>
between Butcherblock and Freeport :)<br/>
<br/>
(hmmm, rogues get the poison trade skill, shamans alchemy, enchanter are<br/>
 naturals for jewelry... but what about the other mage classes... Would<br/>
 look funny for a Wizard to take smithing for a hobby)<br/>
