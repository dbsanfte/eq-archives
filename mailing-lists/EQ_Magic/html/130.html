&gt; I like this one very very much !! So dear friends finaly verant guys found<br/>
&gt; that death penality is too big in world where is so easy to die by thousnds<br/>
&gt; of random things wich can provoke it and if you must to pass 3 zones to get<br/>
&gt; your corpse i think that you will thing twice about daing a same mistake<br/>
&gt; again. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I died so many times this weekend- it was pathetic and frustrating and had<br/>
me seriously thinking about quitting the game altogether. I was trying to<br/>
solo in Crushbone and I only go out of the zone transition area once. The<br/>
trains would come in, my pet and I could handle all the green orcs and<br/>
then a slaver or taskmaster would show up and it was all over.<br/>
<br/>
Since the only things I&#39;d been killing were green orcs, I was losing more<br/>
experience than I was making. It was completely disheartening and I<br/>
finally went back to the Chessboard in Butcherblock to make up the<br/>
experience I lost. I find the Chessboard sort of boring and it is not very<br/>
good for loot either. In short, by getting killed three times, I&#39;d lost<br/>
all the experience I&#39;d made in a week and was driven to go fight in an<br/>
area that didn&#39;t interest me.<br/>
<br/>
Which made the game not fun anymore. Luckily, I didn&#39;t make any rash<br/>
decisions. I&#39;m level 10 and one of my goals in the game is to get to level<br/>
20. Hopefully, this lowering of the death penalty will help me accomplish<br/>
this goal with the minimum amount of frustration and the maximum amount of<br/>
fun.<br/>
