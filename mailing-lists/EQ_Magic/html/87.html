<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486428203"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can make an inventory spot a hot button.  So put that slot as a hot <br/>
button, and just drop it there.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, I believe I have tried that and it won&#39;t let me do it.  I will try to<br/>
do it again.  But if I am reading this right, if I have my inventory as a<br/>
hot button, I can just take the item and drop it on the inventory button?</div>
