<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799538002">This is the bread and butter spell for a wizard from 4th lvl on.<br/>
 Is it just me or does the Root spell get less effective the higher <br/>
in lvl you become? I and now 30th lvl and Root gets resisted more <br/>
often than i can remember and gets broken faster. Bonds of Force is <br/>
ok. But i would like to know if Root gets nerfed the Higher in LVLs <br/>
one gets.   <br/>
