<div id="ygrps-yiv-630551483">Check this out!  My roommate and I were playing EQ (2 accounts 2 pc&#39;s) He is <br/>
a Highelf Wizard and im a wood elf ranger...well AT MY OWN GUILDHOUSE in <br/>
kelethin i was getting ripped off!  We have the same charisma (80) and he <br/>
was getting stuff for about 5sp to 1gp cheaper!  WTF?<br/>
Is there some logical explanination for this? (we were both 3rd level and <br/>
dindt have much of a faction adjustment quite yet)<br/>
