<b>Subject:</b> Re: Dark pact question for all Magic Users <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-536518554">I have seen a lot about dark pact.  This spell is very cool, but I question<br/>
why only the Necro has this ability.  In many games I have seen all kinds of<br/>
magic user classes with the ability to sacrifice hp to gain mana.  Does<br/>
anyone have the background understanding of why this ability might be necro<br/>
only?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info.<br/>
