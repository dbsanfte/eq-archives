<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009073334">According to Thomas Adelsberger:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But they can make some nice studded and reinforced armor.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Studded and reinforced isn&#39;t useable, because the market is very limited.<br/>
Most classes either:<br/>
	1) cant wear much armor (spellcasters)<br/>
	2) can wear metal armor (banded), which isn&#39;t much more<br/>
		expensive than reinforced<br/>
	3) can buy leather armor at comparable prices to studded<br/>
		and studded isn&#39;t much better than leather<br/>
<br/>
As a result, the only customers for tailors are druids and monks, and<br/>
monks do not want armor if it weights them down.<br/>
<br/>
I think that studded should have been an intermediate armor between<br/>
leather and chain (like patchwork between cloth and leather), which would<br/>
have been consistent, and reinforced should have been transformed into<br/>
special armors, maybe made in junction with jeweler made items (sew jewels<br/>
in garments) or tinker made items (as such, tinkers can make a termal<br/>
cloak, and that&#39;s all), to be something equal to chain, but with small<br/>
additional bonuses (like +5 gloves with +1 in dex, boots with +1 in agi,<br/>
and so on).  The progression in item levels would have been adequate<br/>
then.<br/>
