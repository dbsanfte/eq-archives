<b>Subject:</b> Random magic duration do you like it? wizard looser? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-270864040">One big everquest problem is too much random effects, in magic it is realy<br/>
deadly Verant aplied a random duration and effects in many things. Lets say<br/>
for example spell SHADOW STEP and FADE hmm it teleports you in random<br/>
direction and random way from a casting place. It teleports you in lower<br/>
position so you can finish under water. But it is magic user last defence<br/>
when something comes in his directionhe can cast this and take at last a<br/>
fast stert running from enemy but .. as you cast it you have realy nice<br/>
probability to A. dont move at all b. teleport near your enemy and util you<br/>
understand where are you many times is too late.<br/>
Second example is INVISIBILITY hmmm duration is random thing and you never<br/>
know how long it will stay you can find yourself in half of enemies and<br/>
death. <br/>
Maybe i miss something but i used a shadow step for some time now and after<br/>
i died some times becouse it not function and it teleports me 1 step from a<br/>
place where i was before and until you get oriented where are you end a<br/>
monsters are all over you.<br/>
<br/>
my suggestion is to make a shadow step with at last some minimum radius and<br/>
second to put a limitation in lets say 40 grades from a point of view.<br/>
<br/>
do you have other problems with too much inprevedible random efects in game?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wizard looser?<br/>
<br/>
From all classes a wizards have worst mana use as i see it no buffs but<br/>
strong damage but also too much mana used for this DD. Look at pets they<br/>
can stay as long as you wish around and all time do damage and serve as a<br/>
shield. i heared of many magician and enchanters not to talk about<br/>
necromancers wich can alone take 3 or 4 blue monsters some of them can take<br/>
also on a yellow alone. as a wizard i never know of any who can take 3<br/>
blues alone after a 12 lv. In a group you must all time meditate for mana<br/>
all other have much longer battle use before remain OOM. If a group fight<br/>
red then a lower resistance of wizard spells can be used but after hard<br/>
fight as persons with more mana then others wizards take a too long time<br/>
meditating and all others will be ready to fight another battle before a<br/>
wizard. I hope that a specialiation will help and i heared of items wich<br/>
help mana regeneration wich are wizard specific.<br/>
<br/>
Please help me to explain why a wizards are not a worst mage class?<br/>
