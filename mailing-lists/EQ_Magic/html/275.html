<div id="ygrps-yiv-428139472">Hi Everyone...<br/>
	I&#39;m not sure how people are on this list, I even forgot that I was on it<br/>
until the last thread showed up!<br/>
<br/>
My question is this:   I have a lvl 16 Druid, and I&#39;m up to date on all my<br/>
spells, but I often don&#39;t use them like I should.  Does anyone out there<br/>
have any tips on what spells are good for soloing?  Another unrelated<br/>
question..... Does anyone here know where a good place to hunt solo would<br/>
be?  I&#39;m having a difficult time finding decent places to go without getting<br/>
killed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for an tips in advance...<br/>
<br/>
