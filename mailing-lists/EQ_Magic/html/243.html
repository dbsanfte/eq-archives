<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655854230"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Pull your head out of your ass and pay attention where you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;spamming.  I&#39;ve been a witch for years, but I can still keep my<br/>
&gt;real-life magic(k) lists separate from the fantasy lists!  A good<br/>
&gt;portion of the discipline is PAYING ATTENTION.  Doesn&#39;t say much for<br/>
&gt;your methods or your list, I&#39;m afraid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry about this spam... went to remove this guy from the list and he&#39;s<br/>
already left.  I&#39;ve added that email address to the ban list, but that&#39;s<br/>
probably futile.</div>
