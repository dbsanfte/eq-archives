<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202624076">Im sorry but this whole thread is silly.  So what if the prices are <br/>
different.. That is part of the game. I get my spells a bunch cheaper <br/>
in Felwithe than other places. As in RL life, it expensive to travel <br/>
from home atleast you dont have to pay for a hotel evernight. But i <br/>
find the loot and experience is worth the trip.  IF you think it is bad <br/>
being what everrace you are.. Try a Dark Elf.. Most will merchants <br/>
will Kill you on sight, if they dont they mostlikely wont sell to you.  <br/>
Try having to rely on friends to sell for you evernight or traveling <br/>
back to the commons or neriak.. <br/>

According to myself:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Merchants are racists. Even in your guildhouse do they rip you. Over the<br/>
&gt; 8th level spells, I spare almost a platinum by going back to Felwithe<br/>
&gt; over the Freeport prices.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just made the trip yesterday, after writing down the exact prices <br/>
(down<br/>
to copper). There&#39;s a difference of 2 gold, 8 silver and 1 copper <br/>
between<br/>
the Freeport prices and the Felwithe prices, adding to over a 1 <br/>
platinum<br/>
when I purchased all the 8 levels spells I wanted (Shock of Frost, <br/>
Shadow<br/>
Step, Shielding, Eye of Zoom).<br/>
<br/>
It made a large difference. I was unable to purchase all spells if I<br/>
remained in Freeport, but making the trip was worth it.<br/>
<br/>
The difference in percentage remains at level 12; there&#39;s a 4 gold<br/>
difference in prices.  I&#39;ll see if I still feel the need to spare 2pp over<br/>
the 12th level spells.<br/>
