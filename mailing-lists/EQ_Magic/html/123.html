<div id="ygrps-yiv-795048946">According to Tony B:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that is the reason i always tell wizards im grouped with to just be patient <br/>
&gt; and save their spells until the creature is past 50% damaged.  i guess if <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I usually don&#39;t wait. I simply tally up the damage done by my friend, and<br/>
fire up a new spell when he has done about 15% below what I did. The proximity<br/>
effect (the MOB takes distance into account) keep it focused in the tank.<br/>
I&#39;ve tested it many times: If I keep distance, the MOB pounds on my monk<br/>
friend. If I move in range, it switches immediately to me.<br/>
<br/>
(other factors enter in account, like how many hits he still have. If he goes<br/>
 near the dangerous - 2 bubble - area, I just stop taking it easy and NUKE,<br/>
 NUKE, NUKE. If the mob switches to me, I&#39;ll lose lots of life, but he&#39;ll<br/>
 finish it without dying)<br/>
