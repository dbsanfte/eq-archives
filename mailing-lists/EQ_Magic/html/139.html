<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967839580">First this game is not near maturity and all classes get tuned in, wizards<br/>
need less changes that others classes but THEY NEED CORECTIONS ALSO !! All<br/>
classes go tuned in as time pass. I understand that you like a look of<br/>
sheer force but if you think a little about you will see that mana goes out<br/>
too fast and without mana a wizard is a shell with no use damage start to<br/>
be resisted at lv where other classes are not resisted why? do you know<br/>
what is a exp loss as a wizard?.<br/>

&gt;You are all nuts.  Wizards are great as they are.  Want to run faster?  Get <br/>
&gt;JM boots?  want to have a chance to run, use your skin series spells.  want <br/>
&gt;heals?  get squad rings and potions.  but nothing anyone else can get can <br/>
&gt;match the sheer devastation we inflict.  i am well past the halfway mark to <br/>
&gt;50, and let me tell you, the smile on my face keeps getting bigger.  just <br/>
&gt;make it past the hump, around 20 your deaths become less frequent if you are <br/>
&gt;smart and do not try soloing often.  remember, nothing replaces what another <br/>
&gt;class can do, ever.<br/>
