<b>Subject:</b> Resisting spells and fizzles? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-90495384">I play a high elf wizard and i was gruped with a human wizard, we were both<br/>
13 lv and i see that he fizzles much much more and many times his spells<br/>
are resisted? we are same lv and class only race is diferent we both have<br/>
our skills maxed from chanaling to evocation and so on. <br/>
<br/>
maybe our stats affect the spells resistance i thing that wisdom can be<br/>
very important factor in this? or it is dexterity? <br/>
<br/>
Anyone other have a similar experience? <br/>
<br/>
