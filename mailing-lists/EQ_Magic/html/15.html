<br/>
#1 They must be in your group<br/>
#2 You must be in a city Zone.<br/>
<br/>
After that, you can &quot;bind without consent...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The concept is... if they are in your group they consent.  And they further <br/>
add safety to it by limiting it to cities.  (shurefall glade counts as a <br/>
&quot;city&quot; BTW...)</div>
