<b>Subject:</b> Malachite in Qeynos? NO MORE?!?! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-802099689">After patching and logging into Fennin Ro, I proceeded to visit the Herb<br/>
Shop near the Magic Guild (ie Orgy of Magic Casting Flooding Your Chat <br/>
Box) to pick up some Malachite for my summoning my fiery buddy.  Imagine<br/>
my surprise when he had none!  I shouted (which I usually do not do)<br/>
saying why the was no more Malachite and where I could get some.  Someone<br/>
metioned I could visit Erudin for the Green Goodness.  I went to Erudin<br/>
(when I could have been going to SplitPaw) and found out they cost 2 more<br/>
silver than they were in Qeynos! (7 silver).  Now I see this lack of a<br/>
basic component in a human city as a discouragment to all magicians who<br/>
start out here.  Does anybody agree or is there some news I didn&#39;t not yet<br/>
hear about? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
