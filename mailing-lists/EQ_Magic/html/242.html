<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-149301659">Pull your head out of your ass and pay attention where you&#39;re<br/>
spamming.  I&#39;ve been a witch for years, but I can still keep my<br/>
real-life magic(k) lists separate from the fantasy lists!  A good<br/>
portion of the discipline is PAYING ATTENTION.  Doesn&#39;t say much for<br/>
your methods or your list, I&#39;m afraid.<br/>
