send a copy here for all who can be interested. I think if anyone come over<br/>
similar letters from GZ or Verant guys it will be nice to post them here !<br/>

GZ SPEAKS! <br/>
I must admit he does get through his email fairly quick. Here is what I gleamed<br/>
from him as a result of my messages to him: <br/>
∩┐╜       Rune and Mist Series will stack again. This was a bug that slipped<br/>
through and will be rectified with a patch. <br/>
∩┐╜       The short duration on WTYH after ysterdays patch will be reworked. They<br/>
are trying to find a balance, lets all just be patient. They are working on it.<br/>
<br/>
∩┐╜       Suffocating Sphere was made much harder to resist. As a result they<br/>
also<br/>
threw in the chance for damage to be lowered on a successful cast. Probably<br/>
better for the low levellers, they have more chance to hurt that tree snake<br/>
now. <br/>
∩┐╜       Illlusion spells give some benefits of the given race. But not all.<br/>
They<br/>
also give you some of the faction of that race. This was to clarify questions<br/>
on whether becoming a troll for instance gave the increased hp regen and things<br/>
of that sort. The answer is maybe. the potential is there, but for each race<br/>
you will just have to experiement. Any info on this please let me know. <br/>
∩┐╜       Alliance Series is designed to give you some of the faction of the<br/>
targeted creature. There has been debate over what this spell series was meant<br/>
to do. Now you know. <br/>
∩┐╜       We will never get unresistable colour flux or short duration stun<br/>
spells. <br/>
∩┐╜       GZ conceded that Shamans and Enchanters are equals when it comes to<br/>
buffing. They just do it in different ways he said. <br/>
∩┐╜       I asked : &quot;Why do we have to tashan before every spell? Why are we the<br/>
only class hit with this minimum 15 mana penalty to get successful magic<br/>
casts?&quot; (note now 10 mana) Response: &quot;You don&#39;t have to. Enchanters are the<br/>
only<br/>
class with the ability to lower the magic resistance of their targets quickly.<br/>
Saves against Enchanter spells are the same as against every other type of<br/>
spell of those types. For example, the save against Root is the same vs. an<br/>
Enchanter as vs. a Wizard. The only exception is that the Wizard does not get<br/>
to lower the creatures magic resistance - the Enchanter does.&quot; <br/>
∩┐╜       Enchanting Items will be added eventually. But he feels we are balanced<br/>
already without the ability to enchant. I think this sucks myself. What is the<br/>
name of our class??? He referred to this series as being a &quot;gravy&quot; thing for<br/>
us, or a little bit extra to make us happy. So don&#39;t expect this new line to do<br/>
anything dramatic when it becomes available. <br/>
∩┐╜       Specialisation is still a few weeks off. So don&#39;t get too excited. <br/>
∩┐╜       This comment after I questioned Verant&#39;s priorities: &quot;The expansion is<br/>
not yet being worked on by anybody but the art team. The rest of the team is<br/>
fixing bugs and adding more features (like weapon enchantments and<br/>
specialization).&quot; <br/>
