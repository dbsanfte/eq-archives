<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702937927">Here is my 2 Cents regarding Druid Soloing :<br/>
<br/>
Lake of Ill Omen is one of the best places for this.  I got there <br/>
around Level 16, and I am currently level 23 (half away from 24), and <br/>
it is awesome.<br/>
<br/>
I must admit that at level 16, I grouped with others and killed <br/>
goblins and skels, and if we had a good group we did some Sarnark <br/>
recruits.  This got me easily to level 20.  After which I started <br/>
soloing more often.<br/>
<br/>
With Sabertooths in the Lake of Ill OMEN, these are my 2 main <br/>
fighting styles:<br/>
<br/>
A) Cast Snare, Cast DOT (Damage over time spell) then run around, <br/>
when DOT runs out, cast it again, maybe blast it with a Careless <br/>
Lightning here and there.  But mostly use your DOT.<br/>
<br/>
B) Cast DOT, Cast Snare, Cast FEAR ANIMAL, Run after the Sabertooth <br/>
and wack it with your weapon, when your DOT/FEAR/SNARE runs out, <br/>
recast it, and continue till he is dead.<br/>
<br/>
Both the above work great, I find that RED&#39;s resist alittle to much, <br/>
so I only stuck with Yellow and below.  Using your track, it is easy <br/>
to find a lot of sabertooths floating around.  The best place for <br/>
solo&#39;n I think in Lake of Ill Omen is at a place they call the <br/>
PILLARS, its easy to find, just give a shout, most people are nice <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about banking, cuz you can just bind your self near a <br/>
zone, either at Frontier Moutains Zone, or Fironia Vie Zone, and then <br/>
Teleport over to ButcherBlock, do you banking, then Gate back and get <br/>
back to killing.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever get bored here, just head on over to Warsilk Woods (its <br/>
about 1 er 2 zones away) and there is a great Giant Fort there.  I <br/>
know what you are thinking, GIANTS are you crazy, but I went over <br/>
there for a bit around level 20 - 22, and it is one of the safest <br/>
spots I ever found, even though there is tonnes of Giants lurking <br/>
around.  If you get into a group, the Fort layout is pretty simple, <br/>
and the spawn points are easily visible, you can pull 1 at a time, <br/>
and kick butt.  At level 20, most where Yellow or Above, some green, <br/>
but again, they it was easy to control the amount of Giants you pull <br/>
to your group.  I think Solo&#39;n here might be easy as well, as the <br/>
Giants usually stick to there spawn points, and only a few walk <br/>
around.  Another great thing about this zone is that it is usually <br/>
empty except fer 1 or 2 group killing giants (at least on Torv thats <br/>
the way it is)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, that is my opinion.  The first time I went to Kunark at <br/>
Level 16, I was very worried, but after gaining level 23 kind of <br/>
easily (i believe i&#39;ve only died like 2 times), I think the next <br/>
character I make will be coming here as well.  Later all.</div>
