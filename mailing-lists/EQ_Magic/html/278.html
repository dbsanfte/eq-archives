<div id="ygrps-yiv-311752387">Lake of Ill Omen rules. I&#39;ve only gotten there recently as my 24 enchanter<br/>
(who made 25 in maybe 6 hours time) and after another hour there, I am about<br/>
3/4 of a bub into the level.         Even as a level 16, this place rules. I<br/>
would suggest you get a tank of some sort, because they can really help, but<br/>
keep the party small. I&#39;ve been experimenting in Lake with various party<br/>
sizes, and two to three people total seems to work best.<br/>
