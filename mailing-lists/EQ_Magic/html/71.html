<div id="ygrps-yiv-579597612">Where in any of this chain of messages have I stated anything which can <br/>
be interpreted as a desire to get the most money or advance the <br/>
quickest.  RPG&#39;s are games which form some basis in reality and in <br/>
which you can play out a roll that may not exist in reality.  Certain <br/>
conditions from the real world such as gravity, economy, etc. are <br/>
generally present from the real world in some form or another though <br/>
not always.<br/>
<br/>
The current state of the game is all money must be derived from the <br/>
repetitious see Gnoll, kill Gnoll, loot Gnoll.  There should certainly <br/>
be some opportunity to earn equal or less profit by plying a trade <br/>
skill if you so desire.  I am obviously not suggesting the UO macro <br/>
skull caps with your tailor and buy a castle routine.  It should be <br/>
simple to determine average money gained by characters adventuring and <br/>
use that information to set prices that NPC&#39;s will by trade goods at or <br/>
slightly below this level.  Thus creating the opportunity for those who <br/>
wish to adventure to do so and make a living, those wishing to ply <br/>
trade skills to do so and make a living, and those wishing to do both <br/>
to be able as well.<br/>
<br/>
For all the people who say if you are not having fun don&#39;t play.  There <br/>
has to be two sides to have a discussion.  If you cannot debate your <br/>
point with some meaning and elegance, don&#39;t subscribe to discussion <br/>
lists.  <br/>

I don&#39;t want to get anyone mad at me but,  <br/>
this is an RPG.  ROLE PLAYING GAME!!!!  The reason skills where put in <br/>
the game was to enhance the RPG experience.  It isn&#39;t all supposed to <br/>
be, who can make the most money the fastest with the highest lvl.  <br/>
<br/>
Skills are not utterly pointless.  They allow you to emerge yourself <br/>
into your character without the constant:   You hit a gnoll for 14 <br/>
damage.<br/>
for 10 hours a session.  I know some skills cost more than you get out <br/>
of them, but think of it as a gaming dynamics.  It is supposed to be <br/>
FUN guys.  If your not having fun, don&#39;t play.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I affended anyone, but I needed to vent an this situation.  It <br/>
seems everyone has something bad to say.<br/>

Obviously never sell to NPC&#39;s what you can sell to other players.  With <br/>
the exception of armor though there is minimal demand for items created <br/>
by the other skills. <br/>
<br/>
When you finish pondering a trade and finally decide upon one you will <br/>
find how utterly pointless it is until you have invested about 200pp in <br/>
it (with the case of smithing or jewelry) or completely pointless <br/>
(brewing, pottery, etc.).  <br/>
