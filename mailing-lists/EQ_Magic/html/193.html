<b>Subject:</b> Where to solo 25+ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-680304125">Greetings fellow magic users!<br/>
<br/>
I have found myself soloing more than usual lately, or rather trying to.  I<br/>
usually group but I am playing at different times of the day and sometimes<br/>
cannot find a group or only have a little while to play.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is what areas are good to solo and what strategies would you<br/>
suggest?  I am a level 25 enchanter.  Thanks for any advice you have.<br/>
