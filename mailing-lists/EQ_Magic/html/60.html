<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507017433">According to myself:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Merchants are racists. Even in your guildhouse do they rip you. Over the<br/>
&gt; 8th level spells, I spare almost a platinum by going back to Felwithe<br/>
&gt; over the Freeport prices.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just made the trip yesterday, after writing down the exact prices (down<br/>
to copper). There&#39;s a difference of 2 gold, 8 silver and 1 copper between<br/>
the Freeport prices and the Felwithe prices, adding to over a 1 platinum<br/>
when I purchased all the 8 levels spells I wanted (Shock of Frost, Shadow<br/>
Step, Shielding, Eye of Zoom).<br/>
<br/>
It made a large difference. I was unable to purchase all spells if I<br/>
remained in Freeport, but making the trip was worth it.<br/>
<br/>
The difference in percentage remains at level 12; there&#39;s a 4 gold<br/>
difference in prices.  I&#39;ll see if I still feel the need to spare 2pp<br/>
over the 12th level spells.<br/>
