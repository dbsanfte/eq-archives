<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-439317253">for a certain thing we will find it. The website is a Paranormal <br/>
site , not in the sense of ghosties and ghoulies , but in the sense <br/>
of just providing information , interactivity and a little bit  of <br/>
humour as well , but mainly this group is all about helping each <br/>
other , feeling down then there will always be someone to talk to.<br/>
It is not a yahoo or any other of the main groups  it is a website.<br/>
At the moment they have spells , hypnosis machines ( to help stop <br/>
smoking , lose weight Etc ) ,info on most subjects it is truly a <br/>
remarkable place.<br/>
If you go and like what you see and want to become a part of it email <br/>
this address  ... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:afhassassin@...">afhassassin@...</a>  ,  not the prettiest of <br/>
addresses but ~AFH~ stands for Assassins for Hire , that is what the <br/>
group started as in a free online multiplayer fantasy medieval RPG . <br/>
the protected the solo players against attacks from groups of other <br/>
players  anyway the site is here .. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://afh.vze.com">http://afh.vze.com</a><br/>
<br/>
there is also a page on wiccan traditions , and very important dates <br/>
in the history of witchcraft.<br/>
 Thank you very much for reading this.<br/>
     take care.</div>
