<b>Subject:</b> General Question about getting items into inventory. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646310940">Ok, I know that this is a General question but it is also related to magic<br/>
because of the summoning spells many of us get.<br/>
<br/>
This was the history of how I learned to get things into my inventory.<br/>
Either off of things I have killed or my dead body doing a loot.<br/>
<br/>
1.  I would left click the item in the left window and drag it to an empty<br/>
slot in my inventory and drop it there.  And when I got bags, I would open<br/>
the bag and drop it into an empty slot.<br/>
	This method was very slow and time consuming, especially as I got<br/>
more armor pieces and had to individually place them in each slot on my<br/>
body.  Also, stackable items gave me problems becuase it would be picky if I<br/>
didn&#39;t click in the EXACT place to stack.<br/>
<br/>
2.  YEAH!  I learned that if you just put an item over your picture and drop<br/>
it on &quot;you&quot; then it would automatically either go into your<br/>
inventory/bag/stack or on your body in the appropriate place.<br/>
	This was HUGE and saved a lot of time and clicks, but I still was<br/>
doing a lot of click on the left, click on me on the right for each and<br/>
every peice.<br/>
<br/>
3. OH YAH!!!  I learned that if you RIGHT click an item on the left, it<br/>
automatically drops it into your inventory in any available open slot, even<br/>
inside bags.<br/>
	This does not work for armor items getting onto your body, though.<br/>
BUT, you can fill up your six slots real quick and then just pull them out<br/>
of your inventory and drop them on your picture which reduces the left/right<br/>
action A LOT!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, now on to the question I guess, When you are summoning items<br/>
(Food/Water/Bandages/etc.)  The item gets places on your cursor.  From that<br/>
point, I click my persona button, drop it on me character, hit ESC, and then<br/>
resummon another item, click the persona button, drop it in my inventory and<br/>
hit esc... and so on..<br/>
<br/>
Is there an easier way to do this from the Wide screen?  <br/>
