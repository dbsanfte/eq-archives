&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want to get anyone mad at me but,  <br/>
&gt;&gt; this is an RPG.  ROLE PLAYING GAME!!!!  The reason skills where put in<br/>

&gt;I agree that role-playing is the heart of the game.  But I have to keep<br/>
&gt;asking myself: &quot;Why would my character spend all of his money developing a<br/>
&gt;trade that provides no benefit?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I mean, aren&#39;t trade skills supposed to represent _jobs_ in EQ?  If so,<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t you expect to _make_ money by using them?  If the skill was<br/>
&gt;&quot;Throwing money into the water&quot; (something to practice while fishing, I<br/>
&gt;guess), I would expect that the skill would provide no benefit, and<br/>
&gt;my character would develop it for some other reason (perhaps, because he <br/>
&gt;is a loony).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I see no inconsistency in being a true role-player and whining about the<br/>
&gt;fact that you make no money by &lt;insert trade skill&gt;.  IRL, I whine that<br/>
&gt;the jobs I&#39;d like to have don&#39;t pay enough.  So, why shouldn&#39;t my<br/>
&gt;character complain, ESPECIALLY when the skill makes him no money at all?<br/>
