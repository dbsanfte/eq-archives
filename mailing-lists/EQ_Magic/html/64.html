<div id="ygrps-yiv-931646163">Obviously never sell to NPC&#39;s what you can sell to other players.  With <br/>
the exception of armor though there is minimal demand for items created <br/>
by the other skills. <br/>
<br/>
When you finish pondering a trade and finally decide upon one you will <br/>
find how utterly pointless it is until you have invested about 200pp in <br/>
it (with the case of smithing or jewelry) or completely pointless <br/>
(brewing, pottery, etc.).  <br/>

According to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:michael.andersen@...">michael.andersen@...</a>:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; economy that makes EQ interesting.  In fact they even note in the <br/>
&gt; instructions that certain vendors will pay more for you goods then <br/>
&gt; others (town vendors versus vendors out in the wilderness).  What I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tip 1: Sell in town rather than outside<br/>
<br/>
Tip 2: Sell to vendors that /con you better (neutral as opposed to<br/>
 threatiningly or some such)<br/>
<br/>
Tip 3: Sell in your guild (they /con warmly, usually)<br/>
<br/>
Tip 4: Sell in your home area<br/>
<br/>
Tip 5: Due to a bug, if you&#39;re a high elf, sell in Wood elfland; they<br/>
 like you better there :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not the intent. Verant didn&#39;t want to repeat the Ultima Offline<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Note that none of the items players create exist otherwise (i.e. you <br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
make straight leather, chain, plate, or anything else). Which means the<br/>
market for these items isn&#39;t supposed to be the NPC, it&#39;s supposed to be<br/>
the OTHER players.  Never sell to NPCs what you can sell to players.<br/>

Ultannis, Wizard starting to ponder what trade skill he should take,<br/>
apart from its fishing hobby whenever waiting for that damned boat<br/>
between Butcherblock and Freeport :)<br/>
<br/>
(hmmm, rogues get the poison trade skill, shamans alchemy, enchanter are<br/>
 naturals for jewelry... but what about the other mage classes... Would<br/>
 look funny for a Wizard to take smithing for a hobby)<br/>
