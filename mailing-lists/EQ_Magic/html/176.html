<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114904753">You really don&#39;t get it that Wizard&#39;s are group only. Certain classes can solo but after level 25 no matter what class you play even necro it becomes inefficent to solo. My friend is a level 40 Wizard and he can deal damage just fine. A Wizzard and a Warrior are perfect for each other all you need is a Cleric and your set. I just think you really missed the point of the Wizard Class.</div>
