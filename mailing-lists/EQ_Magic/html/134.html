 </span></blockquote>Soloing has its good side and bad side. I have been in a few really good<br/>
groups that I have enjoyed being in. But I find it hard to find a group I<br/>
actually want to join. I think it is safer to solo than to play in a group<br/>
that doesn&#39;t work well together.<br/>
<br/>
Ever been in a group that wanted to go into an area that was too high<br/>
level? How about a group that where there is no real leader and people<br/>
attack things wily-nily, thinking that someone is covering their backs,<br/>
only to find out that there are now 6 yellow monsters for a 4 person<br/>
group?<br/>
<br/>
Good groups are hard to find. I don&#39;t mind if I level slower because I<br/>
have to sit and rest more than I would in a group or because I can only<br/>
take blues instead of yellows or reds. But I did very much mind losing 1/2<br/>
bubble or more everytime I died. <br/>
<br/>
I understand that the game is suppossed to be challenging and is meant to<br/>
be geared for people to work together. But sometimes, I would prefer to<br/>
work alone and I don&#39;t think I should be penalized for it.<br/>
