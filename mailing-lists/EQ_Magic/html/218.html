<b>Subject:</b> Spokes of something or other? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009064347">Found someone near Halas and he is asking for spokes of a wheel.  They<br/>
are named (azua, short and sweet like that) from the sayings of others.<br/>
My question, what do you get if you give all the spokes to him, if even<br/>
anyoen have actually completed the quest.<br/>
