<div id="ygrps-yiv-976847160">When I used to solo with my gnome necro in crushbone(level 6+7 at the time) I <br/>
would always stay right in that big open area right as you exit the tunnel <br/>
entrance. Tons of centurions spawn there and on the other side of the river <br/>
and whenever I would get attacked by a larger creature by pet would buy me <br/>
those few precious seconds for me to make it to the zone.  Besides if <br/>
something big enough to kill you wanders here it is already part of a train <br/>
so you dont have to worry about people getting mad for training to zone. Also <br/>
if someone shouts train to zone or something to that extent feel free to jump <br/>
in the river and hide there is nothing shameful about not standing up to <br/>
creatures 6 levels above you. Hope this helps.<br/>
