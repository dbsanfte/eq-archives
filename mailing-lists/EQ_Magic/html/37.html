<div id="ygrps-yiv-551767634">According to Bill Butler:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The thing that you can combine spells in is called an Elemental <br/>
&gt; Grimoire (11pp - neriak has it for example)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on your class.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So for a 16 level pet you would add a 12 lvl pet scroll, words of <br/>
&gt; tyrany and a block of ore into the Elemental Grimoire. click <br/>
&gt; combine. And *Poof* if you dont fail you get a new 16th lvl pet. Note <br/>
&gt; I have not done this. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Expensive :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1) level 16 and 20 lvl pet are at merchants in certain cities.. (not <br/>
&gt; going to tell ya in this email) So why would you make a pet from <br/>
&gt; research. Are they the same?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Will everyone travel to all cities to collect all spells? :)<br/>
(I assume that&#39;s the intent)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) Does this work for any level pet, ie 16 , 20, 24,? could you <br/>
&gt; practice with, lets say a 12 lvl pet. ie 8th lvl pet +wot+ore = 12th lvl <br/>
&gt; pet?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Will tell when I&#39;m at that level.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) What monster have word of tyarany. I know random but which <br/>
&gt; one in your experience.. which zones.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Too high for me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6) ok on pet if what i have down so far is correct ie ( pet spell -<br/>
&gt; 1rank+WOT+Regent) then for the  36th lvl pet spell you need to <br/>
&gt; create a spell for a 32th lvl  pet.. This would take a 28th lvl pet which <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the complement to research is the ability to scribble spells. When<br/>
you research a spell and found one, you&#39;d better memorise it, then write it<br/>
back on scrolls to re-use (and, of course, sell to other, lazier mages).<br/>
