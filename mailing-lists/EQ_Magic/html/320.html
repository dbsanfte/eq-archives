<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616334847">Hi everyone, <br/>
I have recently set up a new forum site. It&#39;s a board that will focus <br/>
on discussions of the various MMORPGs that are out there. <br/>
Obviously, I&#39;m in need of some posters and I am very ungraciously <br/>
(perhaps even a little spamishly) asking for anyone and everyone to <br/>
come by and post your thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
If you love your game, please tell the world about it. Tell us why EQ <br/>
is better than Ultima Online or Asheron&#39;s Call. Discuss that rule <br/>
change that you always wanted. Tell the world how you kick major ass. <br/>
<br/>
Site is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bigonlinegames.com/">http://www.bigonlinegames.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Michael Lutter</div>
