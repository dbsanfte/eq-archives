<div id="ygrps-yiv-162578955">According to Tony B:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thats not really true- i believe most people dont group with necros because <br/>
&gt; they arent really aware of what they can do.  with our dot spells we can <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s true of most classes. &quot;Straight&quot; classes, like Cleric (healing please)<br/>
Warrior/Paladin (me slash), Wizard (want a little boom?) are highly sought,<br/>
because they&#39;re, well, simple.  They do ONE thing (a little more for Cleric),<br/>
and they do it good. Other classes require subtlety, and that&#39;s something<br/>
that a lot of players seem to lack :(<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; actually do the most damage to a creature, although it isnt as impressive as <br/>
&gt; a wizard hitting with one spell for 50 damage or whatever; but if i can cast <br/>
&gt; three dot spells on a creature at the beginning of the fight, that is some <br/>
&gt; tough damage.  the problem is that its effects are mostly unseen, so people <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is also why the creature will quickly stop attacking anyone and jump on<br/>
you :)<br/>
<br/>
(tough lesson, at early level 8. I was &quot;icing&quot; a Sand Scarab, as usual, but<br/>
the Monk I team with forgot at the beginning to click on its auto attack, and<br/>
was only using its special attacks. After the 2nd Shock of Ice, the Scarab<br/>
dropped all and ran straight to me... I had to fight it staff to claw, and<br/>
repeatedly attempt to go a spell thru... I managed it, but barely)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; dont give it credit.  also, necros have some pretty versatile spells, such <br/>
&gt; as dark empathy (healing), dark pact series (gives us more mana- good for <br/>
&gt; extended fights), and such.  we also get many spells that cannot be <br/>
&gt; resisted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Necros are combos casters. Nothing they do is impressive in it, but the<br/>
association is a LOT more impressive.<br/>
