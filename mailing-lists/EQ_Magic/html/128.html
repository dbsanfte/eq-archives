&gt;players on this list, and wherever this information spreads, to have some <br/>
&gt;updated info to work with.<br/>

&gt;&gt;- Added the ability to pull one item &quot;charge&quot; from a stack by &gt;holding down <br/>
&gt;&gt;the &quot;Control&quot; key when left-clicking on the stack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;has anyone gotten this to work? i tried it, it didnt work.<br/>
&gt;&gt;- We have reduced the amount of experience lost when dying by 50%.<br/>

that death penality is too big in world where is so easy to die by thousnds<br/>
of random things wich can provoke it and if you must to pass 3 zones to get<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;- Magician pets (elemental) will now cast minor spells (to make up &gt;for <br/>
&gt;&gt;their lack of kick) - New Magician spells on vendors and some Magician <br/>
&gt;&gt;spells have moved &gt;to different vendors - New Magician weapons for Summon <br/>
&gt;&gt;Fang & Spear of Warding & Dagger &gt;of Symbols -<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Verand dont have expected that there will be so much to do after relase so<br/>
they dont balanced lv. after a level 20 they hoped to do this after relase<br/>
before too much people come to higer levels, they now must make a swift<br/>
moves to cover this. This class is one of last introduced in game beter to<br/>
say only enchanters are introduced later and so we also see in this and<br/>
previous patch they try to finish this classes. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 New enchanter whirl spell <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;(check the vendors) - Whirl now works on MOBS better than it did on the <br/>
&gt;&gt;last patch. - The saving throw against Memory Blur and Atone was reduced <br/>
&gt;&gt;(harder &gt;to save against) from the last patch. - AC added to the Rune <br/>
&gt;&gt;Series (Enchanter) - Alliance series works better (Enchanter) - Enchanter <br/>
&gt;&gt;Attack Speed spells now have longer durations (Quickness, Alacrity, etc.) - <br/>
&gt;&gt;Tashan (the entire Enchanter series) is now quicker to cast, costs &gt;less <br/>
&gt;&gt;mana, and is harder to save against. - New bard songs have been added to <br/>
&gt;&gt;the vendors - Paladins lose the spell Bravery, and gain the spell Valor - <br/>
&gt;&gt;ShadowKnights and Necromancers gain the Word of Spirit spell (replacing <br/>
&gt;&gt;Word of Shadow for the ShadowKnight) - ShadowKnights lose Haunting Corpse <br/>
&gt;&gt;and gain Summon Dead - Necromancers and ShadowKnights get a new spell - <br/>
&gt;&gt;Shadow Vortex. - ShadowKnights lose Intensify Death (replaced by Shadow <br/>
&gt;&gt;Vortex)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;any info on these would be helpful.  anyone have shadow vortex? i believe it <br/>
&gt;replaced umbral messanger, which i would have liked to have...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Rangers lose Shield of Barbs and gain Shield of Brambles<br/>
&gt;- Shorter stun effects will no longer remove longer stun effects (Bash won&#39;t <br/>
&gt;get rid of whirl, for example)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;- Spell components are now stackable<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes so finaly we dont have to vaste place for them space is so limited as<br/>
