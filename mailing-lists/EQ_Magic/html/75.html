A short time ago, at a computer terminal far, far away, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I&#39;m still trying to figure out exactly where the fun is in spending<br/>
lots of time creating (seemingly) worthless objects.  I don&#39;t know about<br/>
other people, but I want to feel like my time is well spent, like I&#39;m<br/>
accomplishing something.  Creating an object that&#39;s worth less than its<br/>
components, not even considering the time spent, is not much of an<br/>
accomplishment.  <br/>
<br/>
If the actual process were interesting or rewarding in some manner (as<br/>
creating pottery, jewelry, paintings, etc in real life can be), or the<br/>
resulting product had some unique value other than the sum of its parts,<br/>
then I could see the accomplishment.  However, dropping items into a<br/>
container and hitting Combine just doesn&#39;t model the usual creative<br/>
processes involved when creating these kinds of things in real life.  <br/>
And<br/>
the resulting product doesn&#39;t have any unique value - your jade ring is<br/>
no different from anyone else&#39;s jade ring.  There&#39;s just no place for <br/>
art<br/>
in the game, as there&#39;s no way to differentiate your piece from anyone<br/>
else&#39;s.  Everything you create is a commodity good - an unspecialized<br/>
mass-produced product.  And skill doesn&#39;t enter it either, as it only<br/>
affects the likelyhood of success; it doesn&#39;t result in a better quality<br/>
product.<br/>
<br/>
So, although I agree that the game is supposed to be FUN, I just don&#39;t<br/>
see the fun in making a jade ring just like everyone else&#39;s jade ring,<br/>
that I then sell back to the vendor for less than it cost to make.  I<br/>
spent time, and all I accomplished was to lose some money.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine if fighting were like this.  You run up to a goblin, miss every<br/>
swing, take 5 damage, and then it disappears.  You spent time, and all<br/>
you accomplished was to lose some hit points.  Would you bother fighting<br/>
monsters then?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think _all_ the trade skills are pointless, though.  I&#39;ve had a<br/>
lot of fun making and selling patchwork.  After doing that for awhile,<br/>
though, it does get boring, and there&#39;s nowhere to go from there.  There<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be a market for studded leather, so, as I&#39;ve said above,<br/>
it&#39;s no fun if all I do with it is sell it back to a vendor for a loss.<br/>
Smithing looks fun once you can make something useful like banded armor,<br/>
but making files for days and days to get there isn&#39;t fun.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up then, I&#39;d guess that no one wants to feel like they&#39;re wasting<br/>
their time.  They want to feel like they&#39;re doing something rewarding <br/>
and<br/>
worthwhile, and for most of the trade skills, I just don&#39;t see anything<br/>
rewarding about them.<br/>
