these things in mind.  <br/>

I don&#39;t recommend soloing, not Crushbone at least.  Orcs spawn too often<br/>
and too close together there - and they have a nasty habit of running away<br/>
and returning with reinforcements.  I&#39;ve had a lot of luck with a three<br/>
person crew there - a wiz (me), a druid, and a paladin.  The classes though<br/>
don&#39;t matter nearly as much as the people playing them though.  If you&#39;re<br/>
with a group that has the same concerns in mind that you do, you&#39;ll do fine<br/>
- but if it&#39;s like trying to herd cats, you&#39;re with the wrong people and<br/>
they&#39;ll probably get you killed.<br/>

Send me a tell if you ever come over to Fennin Ro.  <br/>
