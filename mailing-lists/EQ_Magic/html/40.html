<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214961179">According to Wizard:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From: Wizard &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wizard@...">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best defence is a strong offence but when this fail what remain ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -  agility it is life saver if he dont hit you he cant dammage you!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agility is *the* life saver. The problem isn&#39;t &quot;if it doesn&#39;t hit, you<br/>
don&#39;t take damage&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;if it doesn&#39;t hit, your casting isn&#39;t<br/>
*interrupted*!&quot; (which means life when fading out)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cloth armour is base armour found a many low lw MOBs like orc pawns, cents<br/>
&gt; some skeletons<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By level 5, I had a full set of cloth on myself. I&#39;m now saving up to upgrade<br/>
my shirt to a Sr Apprentice Robe (same AC, additional mana) for level 7.<br/>
(restarted recently. My soul didn&#39;t feel comfortable in a Dark Elf body)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; g......... armour can be won in najena<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gossamer. Say the word.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; s.... s..... is beter jet as it also give some magic bonuses<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shiny Silk. Say the word.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; l..... armour is similar but takes much more time to get<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lupine. Say the word (and take a long time to pay Karg)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Finaly B... D..... S.... Armour make you look and feel realy great with a<br/>
&gt; resistence and a other magic adds make you<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There you lost me :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - last line of defense can be some escape spells or sacrifical pets but<br/>
&gt; escape spells are very very unstable so it is realy emergence and when you<br/>
&gt; dont have any other hope that you can use them. Fade and shadow step is<br/>
&gt; some of this spells but from my experience after using this spell you<br/>
&gt; finish dead as it teleports you 10 cm. from monster and before you can run<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It varies. In dungeons, it is great because it will teleport you on the other<br/>
side of the wall. Better know your way then :)<br/>
