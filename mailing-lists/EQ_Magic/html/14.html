<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613573993">Well said.  Yes, just the sheer casting of the spells helps the castor.  And<br/>
something so simple, to the mage/Shaman, such as creating food and water is<br/>
a HUGE deal for someone who can not do these things.  And hopefully, as you<br/>
stated, when we do need some help, this person will remember our kindness<br/>
and step in and do something simple to them that is not so simple to us like<br/>
Swing that Sword or cast that Massive DD spell to save our butts in a time<br/>
of crisis.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as you state, if we log or camp, the food and water we have provided<br/>
to them, no matter HOW much we gave them, dissappears, so it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
right to charge for an intangible, especially when Server TimeOuts are still<br/>
fairly common (at least for me)<br/>
<br/>
Now, binding on the other hand, as you said, is a HUGE mana drain and a HUGE<br/>
benefit to someone.  You see people selling armor and weapons that they have<br/>
made or found all the time because others find that it will benefit them.<br/>
So charging for binding doesn&#39;t seem out of the question because it is a<br/>
permanent effect.<br/>
<br/>
Question, does someone have to submit to being Bound or can you BIND them<br/>
without their consent?  i don&#39;t knwo why you would do this, just curious.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Ann, you do belong to the EQMagicians and ShamenEQ Mailing lists also,<br/>
correct?<br/>

--&gt;&gt; Many unelightened warriors have walked up to me and asked to be<br/>
--&gt;&gt; binded/SOWed/get some food and water/invisible. Now, my <br/>
--&gt;question is...what<br/>
--&gt;&gt; is your recommendation as setting the price on these spells?<br/>
--&gt;<br/>
--&gt;I have two mage characters- a 7th lvl High Elf Magician and a 5th lvl<br/>
--&gt;Barbarian Shaman, both on the Rallos Zek server.<br/>
--&gt;<br/>
--&gt;With the 7th lvl Magician, as long as I have the mana and <br/>
--&gt;the time, or the<br/>
--&gt;extra supplies, I will summon food/water/bandages for free. <br/>
--&gt;I feel (and<br/>
--&gt;this is my own personal ethic here) that it is of <br/>
--&gt;questionable ethics to<br/>
--&gt;charge for this service. A few reasons for this.<br/>
--&gt;<br/>
--&gt;1. When the person camps, the food is going to disappear, so <br/>
--&gt;it is not<br/>
--&gt;really, IMHO, a tangible sellable object.<br/>
--&gt;<br/>
--&gt;2. I feel I have an obligation to help other &quot;good&quot; races in their<br/>
--&gt;endevours. Providing free food and water is an easy way to do this,<br/>
--&gt;especially when hunting out in an area removed from civilization.<br/>
--&gt;<br/>
--&gt;3. When I am in a jam, I don&#39;t want to be expected to pay for help.<br/>
--&gt;Likewise, when others are in a jam, I do not want to charge<br/>
--&gt;them.<br/>
--&gt;<br/>
--&gt;I have not gotten the Bind Affinity spell yet and have not <br/>
--&gt;decided how I<br/>
--&gt;will handle that. I think that can be looked at differently, <br/>
--&gt;since it is a<br/>
--&gt;huge mana soak and it is something that makes someone&#39;s life <br/>
--&gt;easier. It is<br/>
--&gt;not a bare necessity.<br/>
--&gt;<br/>
--&gt;The going rate I have seen for binding tends to fall in the 5g.<br/>
--&gt;neighborhood, although I have seen people advertising to do <br/>
--&gt;it for a plat.<br/>
--&gt;<br/>
--&gt;With the 5th level Barbarian Shaman, I will cast buffs and <br/>
--&gt;heals for free<br/>
--&gt;and often unsolicited. A little random kindness and all of <br/>
--&gt;that. It also<br/>
--&gt;helps me practice my spells and gain goodwill in what can be a fairly<br/>
--&gt;rough neighborhood for a newbie.<br/>
--&gt;<br/>
--&gt;Just my two cents.. :)<br/>
