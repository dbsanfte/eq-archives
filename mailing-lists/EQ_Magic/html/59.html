     I&#39;ve been getting some e-mail/feedback recently from a group of<br/>
dissatisfied magicians as to how<br/>
     underpowered their class is. I&#39;d like to take a few moments to address<br/>
this. Please realize that because<br/>
     of our intense work schedule at Verant, I probably won&#39;t have a chance<br/>
to check and respond to posts<br/>
     made on this post - this is a purely FYI kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     PETS.<br/>
<br/>
     Now, I keep hearing Magicians wonder why their pets are weaker than<br/>
Necromancer Pets. Simple<br/>
     answer - they are not. Magician pets, on the whole, have better ability<br/>
scores, and in some cases, more<br/>
     HP than Necromancer pets. They also average one level higher (which<br/>
means more hp, better attacks,<br/>
     etc). The problem is that most Magicians don&#39;t experiment with the<br/>
different pet types, assuming that<br/>
     summoning a Fire Elemental is the same as a Water Elemental.<br/>
<br/>
     Time for a little explanation on the four types of magician pets.<br/>
<br/>
     The Earth Elemental is the elemental that you want to be using for<br/>
serious battles. It has THE most hp of<br/>
     any pet. It also has a massive strength (about equal to an Ogre). Earth<br/>
elementals deal THE most damage<br/>
     of any pet. Their weakness is that their Agility bites. They will get<br/>
hit by anything swinging at them.<br/>
<br/>
     The Air Elemental is the elemental that you want tanking for you. It<br/>
has an incredible high agility,<br/>
     making it much harder to hit than any other elemental. It has good<br/>
strength (about equal to a Barbarian).<br/>
     It deals good damage, is hard to hit, and has the invisibility ability.<br/>
This means you can use &quot;/pet back<br/>
     off&quot; to good effect. The Air Elemental backs off, and assuming that<br/>
monster does not follow (it goes<br/>
     after another party member), the Air Elemental will turn invisible,<br/>
guaranteeing that it will not be hit<br/>
     while it heals up.<br/>
<br/>
     The Fire Elemental is the elemental you want to use against creatures<br/>
with very quick attacks (Bixies) or<br/>
     against massive amounts of smaller creatures (clearing away the hall<br/>
trash). Fire Elementals have good<br/>
     strength (about equal to a Barbarian) and good agility (about equal to<br/>
an elf). They have the least HP of<br/>
     any elemental, but compensate with an innate Fire Shield that damages<br/>
an attacker every time the<br/>
     attacker hits the elemental. This means that a creature is getting hit<br/>
by the elemental AND taking damage<br/>
     every time they hit the elemental.<br/>
<br/>
     Water Elementals are the composite elemental - they combine a little<br/>
bit of the best of all of the other<br/>
     elementals. Their strength is second only to an Earth Elemental (about<br/>
equal to a Troll), their agility is<br/>
     good (about as good as an elf) and their HP are just under that of an<br/>
Earth Elemental. They are the<br/>
<br/>
     &#39;balanced&#39; elemental. Water Elementals also heal faster than any other<br/>
elemental.<br/>
<br/>
     Now, the Skeleton is a very good pet as well. Its strength is lower<br/>
than any of the Elementals, but it has<br/>
     a good agility (about equal to an elf). Its hp fall between that of an<br/>
Earth and Water elemental. What it is<br/>
     lacking is the massive strength of other elementals, and the special<br/>
abilities gained by certain<br/>
     elementals. It also lacks the versatility gained by having four<br/>
different elementals.<br/>
<br/>
     Another issue that magicians (and necromancers and enchanters) complain<br/>
about is that their pets always<br/>
     con blue / green to them. Now, you will notice that at higher levels,<br/>
monsters get more hp / damage than<br/>
     a player of the same level. For example, a 35th level Warrior or Wizard<br/>
could not solo a 35th level<br/>
     Griffin, were a 8th level Warrior or Wizard could solo a 8th level<br/>
Gnoll. Monster levels are not the<br/>
     same as player levels. Monster levels are better. Now, pets use monster<br/>
levels. That is why, at higher<br/>
     levels, your pet cons green to you. I will be putting in some changes<br/>
soon to make it so they con &#39;better&#39;<br/>
     to you - not green, but blue. There will be no actual changes made to<br/>
<br/>
pets other than perception.<br/>
<br/>
     The range at which pets respond to commands from their casters has just<br/>
been doubled. This should help<br/>
     Magicians (and all other pet classes) to keep their pets in line.<br/>
<br/>
     One final note on pet summoning. You will NOT get the same power of pet<br/>
with every summoning. If a<br/>
     pet seems particularly weak to you, you may want to reclaim energy on<br/>
it and summon another.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     SUMMONED ITEMS<br/>
<br/>
     Summoning items is one of the magician&#39;s unique abilities. Some items<br/>
are better than others - and all<br/>
     are based on our hard worked concepts of game balance. If a Magician<br/>
could summon items that were<br/>
     BETTER than the norm for her level, our game would quickly be overrun<br/>
by a horde of phantom items.<br/>
     This being said, we have retuned our items many times, and it is quite<br/>
possible that that Magician items<br/>
     missed a final tuning. I will double check this - but regardless,<br/>
Magicians can summon MAGIC weapons<br/>
     (weapons that hit wisps, ice-boned skeletons, etc) for relatively<br/>
little mana. This is a nice ability.<br/>
<br/>
     There are also several hidden spells out there, waiting for players to<br/>
find. Once a certain number of<br/>
     these have been found, they will be available from magician vendors.<br/>
I&#39;m not saying where they are or<br/>
     what they are∩┐╜ but they are nice∩┐╜<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     ARMOR<br/>
<br/>
     Magician&#39;s Phantom Armor series now stacks with the Shielding spells.<br/>
This change should be in as you<br/>
     read this. This gives Magicians the best personal armor spells of any<br/>
Magi class.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     DIRECT DAMAGE<br/>
<br/>
     Of the four Magi classes (Wizard, Magician, Enchanter and Necromancer),<br/>
Wizards have the best direct<br/>
     damage. The second best direct damage is done by the Magicians. Third<br/>
best is Necromancers, and last<br/>
     are the Enchanters. Magicians also get ranged area effect direct damage<br/>
spells, spells wielded only by<br/>
<br/>
     the Wizard, Druid and Magician classes. They also get damage shields,<br/>
combat spells that have no<br/>
     saving throw (since you cast it on a player, a monster never gets a<br/>
saving throw). This means that a<br/>
     Magician can indirectly effect a monster many level higher then her -<br/>
something that not many other spell<br/>
     casters can do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     RESEARCH<br/>
<br/>
     All research materials for Magicians are in the game. The frequency of<br/>
the appearance of all research<br/>
     components has been increased by 300%. Instructions on research can be<br/>
found in your guild hall, in<br/>
     several of the tomes sold by your guild merchant.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     IN CONCLUSION<br/>
<br/>
     Magicians have the best pets and the second best direct damage of any<br/>
Magi class. For pure damage<br/>
     done, Magicians can rival any wizard - between the damage of their pet<br/>
and the damage of their spells.<br/>
     It is always tempting to think that your class is the least powerful -<br/>
watching another class doing<br/>
     something in their specialty can make them seem &#39;better&#39; then your<br/>
class. This is just &#39;grass is always<br/>
     greener&#39; syndrome - we saw a lot of this in Beta. I have played each<br/>
class up to a respectable level, and<br/>
     can tell you that the Magician is an extremely viable class. Magicians<br/>
are not going to be &#39;retuned,&#39; as<br/>
     they are extremely viable.<br/>
<br/>
     What you can look to see is an expansion of Magician summoning items<br/>
/toys / etc. spells as they are<br/>
     &#39;found&#39; in the game. I&#39;m not going to drop any big hints, but there<br/>
are some interesting things out there that<br/>
     have not yet been found.<br/>
<br/>
     I hope this helps a little bit on getting a grasp on the Magician. I<br/>
have a Magician in my party, and let me<br/>
     tell you - she rocks!<br/>
