<div id="ygrps-yiv-448591246">yes, finally someone tells the truth!<br/>
<br/>
When I type the ever increasing /played I see I have played about 3 days<br/>
worth of gaming with my 7th level mage Kapolokok.  As I check the boards<br/>
and see people acheiving 10th level after just two days, I have come to<br/>
one conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
I either really suck at EQ, or I understand it completely.<br/>
<br/>
I take the time to make friendships and go on group adventures into the<br/>
bowels of some really nasty cave/dungeoun/city.  The XP spread isn&#39;t<br/>
really that good amongst the group (I go with higher levels), so I am very<br/>
slowly climbing the scale... <br/>
<br/>
I bought EQ because leading a life I always wanted, a life of magik and<br/>
mystery, is a real good experience (did I mention I loved RPG in AD&D and<br/>
playing Quake?  I see EQ takes the best parts of the two and makes it into<br/>
a bastard-wonder child).<br/>
<br/>
Call me amateur, tell me I suck, but there alot more of online friends out<br/>
in Norrath then you, and they love having me around for who I am (and me<br/>
to them)<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t want to get anyone mad at me but,  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; this is an RPG.  ROLE PLAYING GAME!!!!  The reason skills where put in the game was to enhance the RPG experience.  It isn&#39;t all supposed to be, who can make the most money the fastest with the highest lvl.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Skills are not utterly pointless.  They allow you to emerge yourself into your character without the constant:   You hit a gnoll for 14 damage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; for 10 hours a session.  I know some skills cost more than you get out of them, but think of it as a gaming dynamics.  It is supposed to be FUN guys.  If your not having fun, don&#39;t play.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry if I affended anyone, but I needed to vent an this situation.  It seems everyone has something bad to say.<br/>

&gt; Obviously never sell to NPC&#39;s what you can sell to other players.  With the exception of armor though there is minimal demand for items created by the other skills. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you finish pondering a trade and finally decide upon one you will find how utterly pointless it is until you have invested about 200pp in it (with the case of smithing or jewelry) or completely pointless (brewing, pottery, etc.).  <br/>
