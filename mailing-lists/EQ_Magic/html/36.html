<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575660596">According to Wizard:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Eheheh in actual situation you realy must be a strange person to be wizard<br/>
&gt; much work, much much risk ( even a green monsters kill you easy if they<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what? Since when any decent follower of Solusek Ro has been afraid<br/>
to take risks? :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; came near you) if 2 monsters go on you you cant cast any spell and they eat<br/>
&gt; you so fast... Spells at first fail after that they start to get some punch<br/>
&gt; but monsters also get much more punch. and when you think you finaly can<br/>
&gt; have some realible spells all a new with new ciklus of spells. mana<br/>
&gt; meditating and running to recover corpse as your warrior friends thinked<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty good at running :)<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I just did a little experiment with a northern valkyrie (north<br/>
barbarian). I was level 2, and in a spot where monsters spawned at a blink<br/>
rate (one every 15 s or so). I stayed at a tiny smudge of the full life total<br/>
(about 5HP) while bashing monsters. I was 2 bubbles away from 3, and finally<br/>
died when I was 1 bubble into level 3... One to three monsters were bashing on<br/>
me permanently. I even hadn&#39;t time to loot the corpses.<br/>
<br/>
Make me want to try my next life as a Troll Warrior :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that you will resist this little 2 orcs a bit longer, is a life of a<br/>
&gt; wizard. I hope that at last in later lv somone will call i need a wizard in<br/>
&gt; group now ( less then 16 lv ) i never seen anyone searching for a wizard<br/>
&gt; clerics, paladins, druids are all time requested so calling healing classes<br/>
&gt; we nukers are out of game for now  sight sight (strange bards are more<br/>
&gt; requestesd in group and they have better solo play then wizards)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Buffs. All their efforts go into making tanks stronger, when those efforts<br/>
would be better invested in making monsters dead in the first place :)<br/>
<br/>
That changes as levels increase. There are monsters with high ACs, so even<br/>
high-level warriors have problems hitting them. But nuking works fine, the<br/>
monster&#39;s magic resistance doesn&#39;t differ much. I spent time on sunday in<br/>
a party with two wizards, 1 cleric, 1 paladin, and 2 magicians whose pets<br/>
served as aux. tanks. The only hard spots for us was when there was more<br/>
than 8 monsters at a time on us... That&#39;s when some started to get<br/>
interested in the wizards... Woops. Time to Fade/Shadow Step... (the range<br/>
intervenes when the monsters select a target, so when they get interested in<br/>
you, Shadow Step moves you out of range, they lose interest, and you can get<br/>
back in range for Shocks but you have to know the local area well to find out<br/>
where you are and get quickly back in range)<br/>
<br/>
Those who think all they need is tanks and healers haven&#39;t invested much<br/>
in the way of IQ levels :)<br/>
