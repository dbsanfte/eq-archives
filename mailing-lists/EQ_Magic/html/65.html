Subject: CONCERNING LEVELS OF A PET<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I am tired of hearing this. Ok I ALWAYS know what level of pet I have.<br/>
A general rule is the higher the level then they have all of the skills.<br/>
Ok first off we all understand that black/white is even and same level. Ok<br/>
well then you learn the second step is that yellow is one level above you.<br/>
But in actuallity when you get level 16ish or so yellow can mean 2 levels.<br/>
But at 16 I never get a yellow pet. I usually just get an even pet. Err<br/>
when I was 16. Well then I turned 17. So I know this. As you notice things<br/>
con blue when they are lower. Well in the lower levels there are pretty<br/>
much 2 basic blues<br/>
<br/>
risky but upper hand<br/>
and risky but worth a try<br/>
<br/>
Well upper hand means 2 levels below you and worth a try means one level<br/>
below you.<br/>
<br/>
Now when I was level 15. My goal was this, to summon a upper hand pet.<br/>
Other stuff was green. Simple as that. Then I knew my pet was going to be a<br/>
level 12 pet. Simple. Now at level 16 it changes a bit. They add one more<br/>
blue and it goes like this..from lowest to highest..this is blue<br/>
conning..err 2 more..pardon me<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
risky but upper hand 3 levels below<br/>
risky but worth a try 2 levels below<br/>
risky but dangerous one level below<br/>
<br/>
Now risky but dangerous is one level below and so forth. Though I believe<br/>
that insteafd of upper hand it says something &quot;you should be able to..but<br/>
not certain&quot; but ti is blue. I haven&#39;t paid much attnetion. I just always<br/>
know what my target con is. So you all people want a high level pet. Well<br/>
that is how to do it. I personally think it would be a waste of time to<br/>
have a spell to do it when they give us a way already. I don&#39;t need a spell<br/>
to con my pet. Well that is my 2 cents.  <br/>
<br/>
