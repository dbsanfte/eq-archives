<b>Subject:</b> Re: Dark pact question for all Magic Users <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330520960">Well the reason this is a necro ability only is, a necromancers specialty<br/>
is the manipulation of life energies & in the changing of living energy into<br/>
something different. Such as changing someone&#39;s life energy into your life<br/>
energy thus the life-drain. Or giving life to something dead. Its only<br/>
natural that the necro would have figured out how to change his own life for<br/>
more of the mana that they covet so much. Wizards on the other hand do covet<br/>
mana but is not a master of manipulating life energy. He turns mana into<br/>
brute force & damage its not subtle like necro&#39;s are think of a wizard as a<br/>
broadsword & a necro as a scalpel if a wizard tried this they might just<br/>
take all there life. A cleric on the other hand changes mana into life he&#39;s<br/>
not very good at taking it away or changing it into anything at all.<br/>
Magicians change mana into objects they don&#39;t really manipulate life at all<br/>
either. Enchanters are the masters of illusion no life manipulation there<br/>
either. All other classes borrow spell from these classes. It was a bit long<br/>
sorry but I think it is correct.<br/>

		I have seen a lot about dark pact.  This spell is very cool,<br/>
but I question<br/>
		why only the Necro has this ability.  In many games I have<br/>
seen all kinds of<br/>
		magic user classes with the ability to sacrifice hp to gain<br/>
mana.  Does<br/>
		anyone have the background understanding of why this ability<br/>
might be necro<br/>
		only?<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks for the info.<br/>
