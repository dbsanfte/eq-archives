<div id="ygrps-yiv-944805676"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This is the bread and butter spell for a wizard from 4th lvl on.<br/>
&gt; Is it just me or does the Root spell get less effective the higher<br/>
&gt;in lvl you become? I and now 30th lvl and Root gets resisted more<br/>
&gt;often than i can remember and gets broken faster. Bonds of Force is<br/>
&gt;ok. But i would like to know if Root gets nerfed the Higher in LVLs<br/>
&gt;one gets.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it has to do with higher levels resisting lower spells.  You&#39;ll<br/>
notice they resist the lower DD spells more often, too.  I think it&#39;s just<br/>
so you don&#39;t blast them with Shock of Frost two dozen times for a much<br/>
smaller amount of mana and aggro.<br/>
