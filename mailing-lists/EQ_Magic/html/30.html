<div id="ygrps-yiv-884590204">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I am looking into research. Im a magician and I just turned 16th and <br/>
this is what i know so far.. but have some holes in what i know and <br/>
need some answers.<br/>
<br/>
I have trained research skill (only can put one point into it)<br/>
<br/>
I have bought magils Consortume vol 1. has pet spells and heat <br/>
stone in it. (most guilds have it ~3pp)<br/>
<br/>
It is written in old erudin. I have train this about 15 or 20 times. But I <br/>
saw about the same result when I trained it for about 4. Im &quot;very <br/>
bad&quot; at it now. <br/>
<br/>
I open, close, open, close, open the book and can read a couple of <br/>
words at a time. I think the better at the language you are the more <br/>
random words you can see at a time.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that you can combine spells in is called an Elemental <br/>
Grimoire (11pp - neriak has it for example)<br/>
<br/>
all the spells in this book take Word of Tyrany. <br/>
<br/>
example<br/>
<br/>
Earth elemental <br/>
Elemental: earth elemental (i believe this is the next  lower spell for <br/>
this )<br/>
Word: words of tyrany<br/>
other iterm : block of ore<br/>
<br/>
So for a 16 level pet you would add a 12 lvl pet scroll, words of <br/>
tyrany and a block of ore into the Elemental Grimoire. click <br/>
combine. And *Poof* if you dont fail you get a new 16th lvl pet. Note <br/>
I have not done this. <br/>
<br/>
Ok here are the questions: Please only speak from what you Know <br/>
not what you have heard, or think, or speculate. I have plenty of that <br/>
myself. <br/>
<br/>
1) level 16 and 20 lvl pet are at merchants in certain cities.. (not <br/>
going to tell ya in this email) So why would you make a pet from <br/>
research. Are they the same?<br/>
<br/>
2) Does this work for any level pet, ie 16 , 20, 24,? could you <br/>
practice with, lets say a 12 lvl pet. ie 8th lvl pet +wot+ore = 12th lvl <br/>
pet?<br/>
<br/>
3) What monster have word of tyarany. I know random but which <br/>
one in your experience.. which zones.<br/>
<br/>
4) I believe that Words of tyrany are only are  magician  Is this <br/>
true? I surmise this  from a post that GZ posted that there &quot;were 13 <br/>
of the 14 classes that would NOT be able to use your spell <br/>
component so trading should be easy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
5) Is word of tyrany the component for all research spells. Like the <br/>
ones in vol II of the Magil&#39;s consortdium? <br/>
<br/>
6) ok on pet if what i have down so far is correct ie ( pet spell -<br/>
1rank+WOT+Regent) then for the  36th lvl pet spell you need to <br/>
create a spell for a 32th lvl  pet.. This would take a 28th lvl pet which <br/>
would take a 24 lvl pet.. and so on.. is this what you correct? what if <br/>
you fail on any of these.. you get to start over?  Ouch the 49th lvl pet <br/>
is going to be tough.. <br/>
<br/>
7) What component wizard need for there spells?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Im on vershaan , name is akdov.  If you are not a magician and <br/>
have word of tyrany i&#39;ll buy them for a fair price and tell you when i <br/>
get yours..please email mail me (no reply all pls) or tell to me in <br/>
game.  <br/>
