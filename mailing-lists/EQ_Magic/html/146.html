<div id="ygrps-yiv-358095247">With the 2nd best DD spells and the best pets... I hope magicians are seen<br/>
as more than a grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
Im only in the 20s, but so far.. I seem to be able to out damage (more<br/>
efficient) my wizard.  We just don&#39;t get to cast those nifty travel spells.<br/>
<br/>
I also play a Wizard.  I enjoy it as well and.. I do like root.. but would<br/>
trade it any day for a good pet.  My magician only does abt 10% less damage<br/>
with the DD spells (which the pet more than makes up for) but I do like<br/>
those great bolt spells also.  Just hate it when someone walks in front of<br/>
it...<br/>
