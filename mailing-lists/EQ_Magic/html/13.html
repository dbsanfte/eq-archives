Barbarian Shaman, both on the Rallos Zek server.<br/>
<br/>
With the 7th lvl Magician, as long as I have the mana and the time, or the<br/>
extra supplies, I will summon food/water/bandages for free. I feel (and<br/>
this is my own personal ethic here) that it is of questionable ethics to<br/>
charge for this service. A few reasons for this.<br/>
<br/>
1. When the person camps, the food is going to disappear, so it is not<br/>
really, IMHO, a tangible sellable object.<br/>
<br/>
2. I feel I have an obligation to help other &quot;good&quot; races in their<br/>
endevours. Providing free food and water is an easy way to do this,<br/>
especially when hunting out in an area removed from civilization.<br/>
<br/>
3. When I am in a jam, I don&#39;t want to be expected to pay for help.<br/>
Likewise, when others are in a jam, I do not want to charge<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I have not gotten the Bind Affinity spell yet and have not decided how I<br/>
will handle that. I think that can be looked at differently, since it is a<br/>
huge mana soak and it is something that makes someone&#39;s life easier. It is<br/>
not a bare necessity.<br/>
<br/>
The going rate I have seen for binding tends to fall in the 5g.<br/>
neighborhood, although I have seen people advertising to do it for a plat.<br/>
<br/>
With the 5th level Barbarian Shaman, I will cast buffs and heals for free<br/>
and often unsolicited. A little random kindness and all of that. It also<br/>
helps me practice my spells and gain goodwill in what can be a fairly<br/>
rough neighborhood for a newbie.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.. :)<br/>
