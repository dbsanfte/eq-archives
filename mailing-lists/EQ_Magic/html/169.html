<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361600179">According to Thomas Adelsberger:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; For a total (if you use the sapphire necklace and rose rings jewelry made by<br/>
&gt; &gt; players):<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Mana +125, Int +52<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holy crap ;)<br/>
&gt; How much does this jewelry go for ?<br/>
&gt; Just wondering.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A sapphire platinum necklace requires a platinum bar (~100pp) and sapphire (also<br/>
~100pp), so the base cost, materials only is 200pp! Don&#39;t expect a jeweler to<br/>
make one for you without asking for at least 500pp.<br/>
<br/>
The sapphire necklace is +7 str/+7 iq. Not bad at all. Pricey but the item is very<br/>
powerful.<br/>
<br/>
The Rose Ring is &quot;cheaper&quot;. Platinum again at 100pp, plus a mere quartz at a pittance<br/>
of 1pp :) - expect a sell price of 200-250pp. It creates a ring of +4 intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Given the progression, I expect the skill required for these items to be about 100,<br/>
i.e. being done by only a very few jewelers; most will drop the trade as it becomes more<br/>
and more expensive to train oneself.<br/>
<br/>
I think that jewelry is the money sink Verant was aiming for. Items are now competitive<br/>
for their price, and the investment required will weed out jewelers as levels<br/>
progress. Now, if tailors could make special leather armors... or tinkers good<br/>
items.<br/>
