b.) feedback idea<br/>

<br/>
1. Wizard is hevy hitter low survivibility class with nice FADE, Shadow<br/>
step serie escape spells YES?? NOOOOOO<br/>
<br/>
He is a looser if he uses his spells as this spells are RANDOM so it will<br/>
teleport you anywere maybe also in middle of monsters!! so it is russian<br/>
rulet type spell. i used it 20 30 times in times of need and only 3 times<br/>
did i escape a fate. It sometime teleport you in back of monster sometime<br/>
in middle of zoo sometime just into zone so you force zone out and<br/>
sometimes so long awey that until you find where are you and where to run<br/>
monsters again cach on you.<br/>
This spell is nearly inutilizable in this state as it is now so please<br/>
suggest changes that dont make it too powerfull but at last usefull.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is:<br/>
<br/>
This line of spells can be fast and directed !! so when you cast it it will<br/>
move you some space from 5 to 10 seconds advantage from monster in<br/>
direction where you look &quot;not random direction&quot;. to compensate it i will<br/>
put long recovery time on all spells so you cannot use it to teleport and<br/>
then open fire  then again teleport then fire again and so on. ( if there<br/>
can be some random number so that if you teleport to max range you can turn<br/>
and fire but until you turn monsters will cach you if you are not<br/>
teleported farr enough.!<br/>
