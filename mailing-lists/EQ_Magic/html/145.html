excellent advice on how/what to hunt and how to get away. (I especially<br/>
like the jump in the river option.)<br/>
<br/>
I play on Rallos Zek and until moving into Steamfont I never had any<br/>
problems with Pkers, since most of them seem to be driven by profit and<br/>
magicians tend not to have valuable items the way other classes do. Last<br/>
night, I was PK&#39;d once and had several other attempts made. I was also the<br/>
victim of attempted extortion (by another High Elf, of all things,<br/>
demanding taxes for travelling in &quot;her lands&quot;, if you can believe that.),<br/>
which I am happy to say failed because of a very nice 12th level gnome<br/>
magician who was helping me out.It seems Steamfont is under the control of<br/>
a PK guild and is not the safest place for a High Elf.<br/>
<br/>
I am considering starting another magician on another server, so that when<br/>
I don&#39;t feel like playing with bullies who are going to beat me up and<br/>
take my lunch money, I won&#39;t have to. :) Can anyone recommend a good<br/>
server, one that has some serious role-players and a minimum amount of<br/>
jerks?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
