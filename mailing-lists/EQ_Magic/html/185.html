<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175889127">Sombody in anonymus (maybe verant hiden suggestion) posted a very strange<br/>
suggestions on vault message board. He say that there exists so called<br/>
hiden spells and that until now nobody have found not a one hiden spell an<br/>
any server !! That spells have beter mana to damage ratio and are resisted<br/>
less.! Anyone know anything about this spells? any indication where to<br/>
start searching for them? I have one feeling that this are researchible<br/>
spells and you need to do right combination to get them !! SO LETS START<br/>
EXPERIMENTING !!</div>
