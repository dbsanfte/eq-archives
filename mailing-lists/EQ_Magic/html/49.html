<div id="ygrps-yiv-628566422">According to Jay Howard:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is not so much the fact the cost is more overall for everyone there, but<br/>
&gt; for YOU.  I can buy food cheap in Halas, but when I go to Surefall, the<br/>
&gt; prices are THROUGH THE ROOF!  It is cheaper for me to pay people to buy my<br/>
&gt; food for me and I still save money over what the Vendor charges.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It happens everywhere. One of my human monk friends got upset when he<br/>
came to Faydwer on visit about the prices. So we stood side to side and<br/>
compared.<br/>
<br/>
Merchants are racists. Even in your guildhouse do they rip you. Over the<br/>
8th level spells, I spare almost a platinum by going back to Felwithe<br/>
over the Freeport prices.<br/>
