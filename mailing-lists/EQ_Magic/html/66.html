    Ok, several of our low level spells are broken or useless..  And there<br/>
is talk that they are to be replaced..  It seems to me that a useful<br/>
replacement would be a low level spell that gauges accurately the ability<br/>
level of a summoned pet..<br/>
    I mean we are supposedly the masters of our own trade, and yet we don&#39;t<br/>
even know most times upon summoning a new pet what level it is..  This<br/>
makes no sense.. I understand the point for randomness, but not for<br/>
ignorance..<br/>
    A simple spell that popped up a text message that gave at least the<br/>
critters numerical level.. Would be great.. Better (but less likely) would<br/>
be a quick gage of base abilities like given when looking at an item..<br/>
Personally I think HP, Atk, and AC along with level and maybe special<br/>
abilities would be perfect, as it would put to rest all the debate over<br/>
whether or not the different types of elementals are really different..<br/>
    I&#39;d love to see this go into effect.. As a programmer I think this<br/>
would be one of the less difficult suggestions to implement (it&#39;s just<br/>
reading info already in the system and reporting it through text.. No major<br/>
mods needed).. I&#39;m thinking a petition is in order.. But have no clue how<br/>
to get one started...<br/>
<br/>
    Any ideas/comments?<br/>
