<div id="ygrps-yiv-919779609">You are all nuts.  Wizards are great as they are.  Want to run faster?  Get <br/>
JM boots?  want to have a chance to run, use your skin series spells.  want <br/>
heals?  get squad rings and potions.  but nothing anyone else can get can <br/>
match the sheer devastation we inflict.  i am well past the halfway mark to <br/>
50, and let me tell you, the smile on my face keeps getting bigger.  just <br/>
make it past the hump, around 20 your deaths become less frequent if you are <br/>
smart and do not try soloing often.  remember, nothing replaces what another <br/>
class can do, ever.<br/>
