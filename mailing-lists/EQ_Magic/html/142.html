<div id="ygrps-yiv-87829624">i remember lvl  10 and 11 as a magician. I would say that CB is not the answer. I suggest you go <br/>
to steamfont on the hill pass the windmill.  Kill drakes, (let  pet take <br/>
the heat, and use fireshield on the pet. give hime a +10 sv fire), <br/>
harpys,elementals, and watch out for HERO. I blew throught 10 and <br/>
11 in 3 days or about 10hr 1bar /hour.<br/>
<br/>
goodluck.<br/>

&gt; Crushbone is very dangerus area i dont know what lv do you have but as i<br/>
&gt; spend there from my 6 to 11 lv i know it very vell moust important is to<br/>
&gt; move from a entrance tunel it is a train magnet. You must find any place<br/>
&gt; out of trains rutes. some places at slaver huts are safe. If you can say<br/>
&gt; what lv are you i can give you precise indications where to go.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I like this one very very much !! So dear friends finaly verant guys<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; found that death penality is too big in world where is so easy to die<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; by thousnds of random things wich can provoke it and if you must to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; pass 3 zones to get your corpse i think that you will thing twice about<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; daing a same mistake again. <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I died so many times this weekend- it was pathetic and frustrating and<br/>
&gt; &gt;had me seriously thinking about quitting the game altogether. I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;trying to solo in Crushbone and I only go out of the zone transition area<br/>
&gt; &gt;once. The trains would come in, my pet and I could handle all the green<br/>
&gt; &gt;orcs and then a slaver or taskmaster would show up and it was all over.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Since the only things I&#39;d been killing were green orcs, I was losing more<br/>
&gt; &gt;experience than I was making. It was completely disheartening and I<br/>
&gt; &gt;finally went back to the Chessboard in Butcherblock to make up the<br/>
&gt; &gt;experience I lost. I find the Chessboard sort of boring and it is not<br/>
&gt; &gt;very good for loot either. In short, by getting killed three times, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt;lost all the experience I&#39;d made in a week and was driven to go fight in<br/>
&gt; &gt;an area that didn&#39;t interest me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Which made the game not fun anymore. Luckily, I didn&#39;t make any rash<br/>
&gt; &gt;decisions. I&#39;m level 10 and one of my goals in the game is to get to<br/>
&gt; &gt;level 20. Hopefully, this lowering of the death penalty will help me<br/>
&gt; &gt;accomplish this goal with the minimum amount of frustration and the<br/>
&gt; &gt;maximum amount of fun.<br/>
