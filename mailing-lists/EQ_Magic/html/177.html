solo but after level 25 no matter what class you play even necro it becomes<br/>
inefficent to solo. My friend is a level 40 Wizard and he can deal damage<br/>
just fine. A Wizzard and a Warrior are perfect for each other all you need<br/>
is a Cleric and your set. I just think you really missed the point of the<br/>
Wizard Class.<br/>

Last nights party consisted of a cleric, a druid, and four wizards.  The<br/>
average Red lasted about 7 seconds, the Yellows lasted less than 5 - it<br/>
looked like nighttime over Baghdad out there.  A caster-heavy party rocks!  =)<br/>
