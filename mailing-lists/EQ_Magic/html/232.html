<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302143052">Pets are ONLY in highhold.  Get used to this type of thing.  You were given<br/>
those illusions for a reason... you are going to need every one of them.<br/>
Several spells are ONLY in Erudin in the Library... Mostly all of your<br/>
higher level illusions and Illusion Halfling.  The enchant metal series is<br/>
only in Neriak&#39;s Third gate Library.  A few spells are only in Ak anon, and<br/>
a few more only in Felwithe.  For the most part, the thicken mana series is<br/>
ONLY in the brownie camp in L Feydark.   You will be visiting just about<br/>
every zone in Norrath, looking for spells.  Best idea is to make good<br/>
friends with a druid...lots of travel.</div>
