<b>Subject:</b> Electrum bracers -ooc <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-613908398">I just picked up a pair of electrum bracers from a talented little gnome<br/>
jeweler and have a question....The stats on this are +10 mana, +10 health,<br/>
2 ac per bracer (just incase I mislabeled it)...It seems to me that since<br/>
getting these that my mana has been regenerating much faster than before.<br/>
I used to lag further and further behind the wizard I travel with when we<br/>
were recuperating after a battle but now I can start from less and come<br/>
out ahead of him (I am a shaman).  Did I conjure some super rations or has<br/>
someone else noticed this when wearing them?  I&#39;m about 4 pixels away from<br/>
a new level, so there was no new learning or levels involved and as I now<br/>
have more mana it should seem even slower...<br/>
<br/>
I dunno....just curious if anyone appeared to have noticed the same thing.<br/>
