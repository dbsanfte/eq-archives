<div id="ygrps-yiv-771381574">Best defence is a strong offence but when this fail what remain ?<br/>
<br/>
-  agility it is life saver if he dont hit you he cant dammage you!<br/>
-  armours<br/>
cloth armour is base armour found a many low lw MOBs like orc pawns, cents<br/>
some skeletons<br/>
netted armour is found on many froglocks and is lower waight then cloth<br/>
with same protection<br/>
wowen armour is better then netted and can be found on some froglocks but<br/>
also weight more<br/>
mesh armour is like leather and same as woven but lower weight and also <br/>
demask armour befalen lower end guys have it and najena<br/>
g......... armour can be won in najena<br/>
s.... s..... is beter jet as it also give some magic bonuses<br/>
l..... armour is similar but takes much more time to get<br/>
Finaly B... D..... S.... Armour make you look and feel realy great with a<br/>
resistence and a other magic adds make you<br/>
<br/>
- last line of defense can be some escape spells or sacrifical pets but<br/>
escape spells are very very unstable so it is realy emergence and when you<br/>
dont have any other hope that you can use them. Fade and shadow step is<br/>
some of this spells but from my experience after using this spell you<br/>
finish dead as it teleports you 10 cm. from monster and before you can run<br/>
from it again he is on you and gul..p.. mmrr.. <br/>
