I don&#39;t think there needs to be any change. If you are totally empty of mana<br/>
at the end of a fight then you aren&#39;t using your tanks efficiently. Not<br/>
playing with tanks? Well then that is the cost of doing so.  Each fo the<br/>
three components of the triad has its use. Clerics heal mages Nuke, Tanks<br/>
absord damage and dish out a steady stream too.<br/>
Increasing the mana regen rate would have a  direct effect on a wizards<br/>
usefullness but would help Enchanters far less, since most of our spells<br/>
can&#39;t stack.   <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;In my first post i don&#39;t explained it good so i try to explain it better. <br/>
&gt;I like to play a wizard as i play wizards in all games for more than 12<br/>
&gt;years now, but if we talk about balancing all magic users to same lv then i<br/>
&gt;see some problems with  a wizard class, i wish to see your comments on this<br/>
&gt;and other ideas to make a game more playable without throwing a balance out<br/>
&gt;or tring to make a overpowerfull class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First positive things<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-  wizards are great for plane(after 34+ lv), group travel (druid is best<br/>
&gt;in individual and nearly as good in group)<br/>
&gt;-  wizards are best in DD damage spells (but not in damage to mana ratio DOT)<br/>
&gt;-  wizards spells are less resisted and it damage at last for one part<br/>
&gt;moust other class spells are resisted full<br/>
&gt;-  wizard is fastest to deal a massive damage in shortest time (but a price?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All good things IMHO<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Negativ things<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Wizards have lowest defence, hit points and ac of all classes (lowest<br/>
&gt;combat survivel)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahh but you shouldn&#39;t be nuking until the Tank has beuilt up a good long<br/>
position at the top of the mobs hate list. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;- wizard spells do massive damage but also use masive mana but when wizard<br/>
&gt;uses it mana it is useless. 	Fighting is not a wizard strong side, wizard<br/>
&gt;dont have pets, dont have buffs, dont heal, they dont run well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you are soloing as a wizard youa re taking a chance that your root won&#39;t<br/>
fail at the wrong time, if not you ahve to learn to relax and let the other<br/>
members of the party soak up damage too. You will decrease downtime by far<br/>
if you allow the tank to lose hitpoints which the cleric can heal, and you<br/>
reserve msot mana for killing runners and a couple of good mid fight nukes.<br/>
Unless its an emergency I never burn over 1.5-2 bubbles of mana per fight. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;- Wizards risks very very much in combat agains only 2 blues<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, but then again the game is built around grouping. If everyone is<br/>
facing 2 mobs in the group thats a train and you should do whatever you do<br/>
when your screwed and need to escape. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;First i don&#39;t wish to say that a wizard is not good or playable class it is<br/>
&gt;nice but it is also a class with most downtime of all clases so as a result<br/>
&gt;a 2 equaly expert people playing sametime will never get equal play time,<br/>
&gt;wizard will most time be in his book. Why this hmm lets see<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All other Magic users have better mana usage then wizard, why pet is a best<br/>
&gt;mana use it damages, it defend, it tount and it never expires until it dies<br/>
&gt;( i personaly dont like this pets i wish to have a cat or dog od mouse :-)<br/>
&gt;not for combat but as familiar ) . Buffs as result do more damage and DOT<br/>
&gt;spells are much more mana efficent then our DD spells. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what can be done to make a wizard a time efficent to play as other<br/>
&gt;classes are. I suggest a faster mana recovering ratio not too much but a<br/>
&gt;1.3 or 1.2 faster times can help and its easy to implement one number<br/>
&gt;change in formula and go go go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here i dont put in effect of specialization as for now it is not in game (<br/>
&gt;long beta ) and i dont know if in later levels exist any only wizard mana<br/>
&gt;regeneration booster but i heared of &quot;mana stone&quot; but noone knows what it<br/>
&gt;is and when you find it. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks all for reading and as i live in italy my english is not maxed yet,<br/>
&gt;but i please you to join a discussion and to not take to hard my spelling<br/>
&gt;mistakes. <br/>
