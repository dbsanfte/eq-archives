&gt;I don&#39;t understand why any race would want to become a wizard. That&#39;s for us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Eheheh in actual situation you realy must be a strange person to be wizard<br/>
much work, much much risk ( even a green monsters kill you easy if they<br/>
came near you) if 2 monsters go on you you cant cast any spell and they eat<br/>
you so fast... Spells at first fail after that they start to get some punch<br/>
but monsters also get much more punch. and when you think you finaly can<br/>
have some realible spells all a new with new ciklus of spells. mana<br/>
meditating and running to recover corpse as your warrior friends thinked<br/>
that you will resist this little 2 orcs a bit longer, is a life of a<br/>
wizard. I hope that at last in later lv somone will call i need a wizard in<br/>
group now ( less then 16 lv ) i never seen anyone searching for a wizard<br/>
clerics, paladins, druids are all time requested so calling healing classes<br/>
we nukers are out of game for now  sight sight (strange bards are more<br/>
requestesd in group and they have better solo play then wizards)<br/>
