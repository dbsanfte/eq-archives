<b>Subject:</b> Re: Wizard what are we? (Long, hmm very long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343627586">personally, ive never seen the wizard class as a seeker of items and <br/>
knowledge any more than any other class.  it even says in the manual that <br/>
wizards are a damage-dealing class, that is their specialty.  ive heard the <br/>
arguement before that this class or that class should have this, the fact is <br/>
that wizards can nuke a monster in short order, faster than any other class. <br/>
  the only thing that balances that fact is that they have to regain their <br/>
mana afterward, a slow process.  to speed it up would unbalance the game, i <br/>
feel.  i have a necro, and i can speed up my mana recovery.  however, the <br/>
majority of my spells are damage over time (dot), so i NEED a tank- i cant <br/>
go toe to toe with an opponent very long.  necros are also hated in most <br/>
places, and as a tier&#39;dal necro i have it doubly so.<br/>
final point.  who do you think would win in a duel, a L? wizard, or a L? of <br/>
any other pure spell caster?  i would say the wizard, just for the power of <br/>
the spells.  with a pet it would be different, but im saying all things <br/>
being equal.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;What is definition of wizard ? I liked to start this thread as I see <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;many<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;people don&#39;t understand what is a idea for a wizard class is in <br/>
&gt;Everquest and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;what is to be changed so that we can be better in our role. So here is a <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;look on this maybe I&#39;m wrong but that is why we are here ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Wizard is a master Explorer he looks for a knowledge about world, magic,<br/>
&gt;items<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;and people all around a world. Why he do this is of many reasons to help <br/>
&gt;his<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;greed for immense power?, wish to help a weak ones or any other reason <br/>
&gt;it is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;not important now but all wizards try to do this.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;To be able to do this he is a god land traveler, he can unleash a nice<br/>
&gt; &gt;power in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;combat and he can see things from long away.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I divide a letter from here on in 3 parts<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;1st is my propose,  what to change so that our class can better execute <br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;role in world of North<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd is what explanation of what I see that we are now<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3rd  is spell grouping<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;1. -------<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;As I see our class must combat to get<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;a.) better run from combat teleport spells - shadow step with minimum <br/>
&gt;range -<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;faster gate - second bind point (in zone only) it can be some type of <br/>
&gt;faster<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;gate for run from combat spells<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If you give a second bind point to wizards then all other magi or <br/>
&gt;clerical<br/>
&gt; &gt;casters deserve one too. This would in effect give you &quot;recall&quot; which <br/>
&gt;Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt;doesn&#39;t want. Nor do I actually.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I say bind point wich will function in same zone only and as you zone out<br/>
&gt;it will be canceled.<br/>
&gt;Other limitation idea can be a spell component i suggest it as a run from<br/>
&gt;combat spell so it can also teleport to zone entrance .<br/>
&gt;Cleric have a invulnerability spell to run from combat, all other magi can<br/>
&gt;use his pet as monster slowing factor and have gate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;b.) Better exploration spells like invisible eye of zoom with longer<br/>
&gt;duration.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;c.) Item locator. As we are item hunters we can have a spell which can<br/>
&gt; &gt;function<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;as ranger tracker for items in zone so we can see all items in zone and<br/>
&gt;we can<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;turn in direction where item is !!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If this spell belongs to anyone it should be Enchanters, thsoe who <br/>
&gt;create,<br/>
&gt; &gt;alter and destroy artifacts and items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wizards are one wich are specific as item hunter similar to ranger wich is<br/>
&gt;animal hunter so i think that it can be wizard only but also can be<br/>
&gt;included in enchanter spells but i think that enchanters have many group<br/>
&gt;oriented spells and a wizard is nearly without similar spells until a group<br/>
&gt;teleports and escape.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;d.) faster mana recovery then other classes - ( or by higher meditation <br/>
&gt;limit<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;lets say (level +1) * 7 or by specific items wizard only later in game) <br/>
&gt;- why<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;this you can ask. because in combat other classes have a mana battery<br/>
&gt;which is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;a pet it can defend, attack and also sacrifice and many more long <br/>
&gt;duration<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;buffing spells.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Again there is no legitimate reason for thsi to be asked for especially <br/>
&gt;as a<br/>
&gt; &gt;class specific thing.  In reference to your rationale, well in combat <br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt; &gt;classes can&#39;t cast as damaging spells or as fast as you can.  Also to<br/>
&gt; &gt;recover the mana from a pet requires the waastage of one of the 8 spell<br/>
&gt; &gt;slots and it isn&#39;t a very mana efficient operation in the first place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes but you can see that you summon a pet sit meditate your mana back and<br/>
&gt;pet will stay with you as long as it will not die you can hunt in one zone<br/>
&gt;two days if you wish. and when meditate to get mana back you cancel a pet<br/>
&gt;slot end put in one other spell :-). You will enter in combat with a full<br/>
&gt;mana and probably many buffs on your pet and on yourself and your party<br/>
&gt;members it is all count at your mana. if you cont all benefits and how long<br/>
&gt;it can work you will se that wizard have need to recover faster he cannot<br/>
&gt;accumulate mana in long duration spells, pets or buffs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;e.) one thing which is not wizard specific but influence us, is to make <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;meditation more diversifying I wish to play a game not to stay looking <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt; &gt;time<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;in same page or go in WC, kitchen when I meditate it will be nice to <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;- internal email system<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;- two chat windows so that I can access general all server chat same one<br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;we can go in from server screen in one window and to hear what going on <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt;game<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;in other window<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;- in game class oriented mailing lists<br/>
