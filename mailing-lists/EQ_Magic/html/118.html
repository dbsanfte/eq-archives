<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; play one.  Personally I think the ranking is necromancer, enchanter,  <br/>
&gt; magician, and then wizard last.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d rate the wizard higher, if not because I play one :)<br/>
<br/>
Wizard isn&#39;t *that* good at low levels.  Still, my Monk friend is still<br/>
amazed about the amount of damage I dish, which is barely less than he<br/>
does. Counting fizzles.<br/>
<br/>
The spells at real high levels are monstruous, and are simply combat-ending<br/>
(you cast only them once, because the monster will drop anything and go<br/>
straight at you; no one can dish out damage like that). The real forte<br/>
of the Wizard is, of course, travel spells. Druid can move around, but<br/>
the Wizard may bring his group with him.<br/>
<br/>
(that&#39;s the real why I wanted to play a wizard in the end. Move around)<br/>
<br/>
For solo, yes, wizard suck a little :)<br/>
