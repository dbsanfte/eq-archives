<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009859442">i have not heard anyone necro who can solo 3-4 blues AT THE SAME TIME...w/<br/>
ward undead , i can keep soloing 3 blue skelly until i have to meditate but<br/>
never the same time. Past level 15 and blue creature generally hit you for<br/>
25-40 dmg+, and there is no way u can take 3-4 blues cuz ur spell will keep<br/>
getting interrupted and u aren&#39;t gonna survive giving the puny hp a necro<br/>
has( of course we know wizard has the least hp in the game).<br/>
<br/>
IMO, at later levels, necro will has a hard time becuz grouping will shine.<br/>
Wizard is sough after by everyone but nobody wants a necro in their group<br/>
becuz necros aren&#39;t really that useful .<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;One big everquest problem is too much random effects, in magic it is realy<br/>
&gt;deadly Verant aplied a random duration and effects in many things. Lets say<br/>
&gt;for example spell SHADOW STEP and FADE hmm it teleports you in random<br/>
&gt;direction and random way from a casting place. It teleports you in lower<br/>
&gt;position so you can finish under water. But it is magic user last defence<br/>
&gt;when something comes in his directionhe can cast this and take at last a<br/>
&gt;fast stert running from enemy but .. as you cast it you have realy nice<br/>
&gt;probability to A. dont move at all b. teleport near your enemy and util you<br/>
&gt;understand where are you many times is too late.<br/>
&gt;Second example is INVISIBILITY hmmm duration is random thing and you never<br/>
&gt;know how long it will stay you can find yourself in half of enemies and<br/>
&gt;death.<br/>
&gt;Maybe i miss something but i used a shadow step for some time now and after<br/>
&gt;i died some times becouse it not function and it teleports me 1 step from a<br/>
&gt;place where i was before and until you get oriented where are you end a<br/>
&gt;monsters are all over you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;my suggestion is to make a shadow step with at last some minimum radius and<br/>
&gt;second to put a limitation in lets say 40 grades from a point of view.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;do you have other problems with too much inprevedible random efects in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>game?<br/>

&gt;Wizard looser?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From all classes a wizards have worst mana use as i see it no buffs but<br/>
&gt;strong damage but also too much mana used for this DD. Look at pets they<br/>
&gt;can stay as long as you wish around and all time do damage and serve as a<br/>
&gt;shield. i heared of many magician and enchanters not to talk about<br/>
&gt;necromancers wich can alone take 3 or 4 blue monsters some of them can take<br/>
&gt;also on a yellow alone. as a wizard i never know of any who can take 3<br/>
&gt;blues alone after a 12 lv. In a group you must all time meditate for mana<br/>
&gt;all other have much longer battle use before remain OOM. If a group fight<br/>
&gt;red then a lower resistance of wizard spells can be used but after hard<br/>
&gt;fight as persons with more mana then others wizards take a too long time<br/>
&gt;meditating and all others will be ready to fight another battle before a<br/>
&gt;wizard. I hope that a specialiation will help and i heared of items wich<br/>
&gt;help mana regeneration wich are wizard specific.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please help me to explain why a wizards are not a worst mage class?<br/>
