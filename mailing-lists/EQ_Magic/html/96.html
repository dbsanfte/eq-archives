<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811325824">thats not really true- i believe most people dont group with necros because <br/>
they arent really aware of what they can do.  with our dot spells we can <br/>
actually do the most damage to a creature, although it isnt as impressive as <br/>
a wizard hitting with one spell for 50 damage or whatever; but if i can cast <br/>
three dot spells on a creature at the beginning of the fight, that is some <br/>
tough damage.  the problem is that its effects are mostly unseen, so people <br/>
dont give it credit.  also, necros have some pretty versatile spells, such <br/>
as dark empathy (healing), dark pact series (gives us more mana- good for <br/>
extended fights), and such.  we also get many spells that cannot be <br/>
resisted.<br/>
<br/>
belphenor<br/>
<br/>
ps. with a pet, i have killed 3 skels by myself.  it was close tho, but my <br/>
mana supply was good to kill 2 skels with ward, and i helped my pet beat the <br/>
last.<br/>

&gt;i have not heard anyone necro who can solo 3-4 blues AT THE SAME TIME...w/<br/>
&gt;ward undead , i can keep soloing 3 blue skelly until i have to meditate but<br/>
&gt;never the same time. Past level 15 and blue creature generally hit you for<br/>
&gt;25-40 dmg+, and there is no way u can take 3-4 blues cuz ur spell will keep<br/>
&gt;getting interrupted and u aren&#39;t gonna survive giving the puny hp a necro<br/>
&gt;has( of course we know wizard has the least hp in the game).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;IMO, at later levels, necro will has a hard time becuz grouping will shine.<br/>
&gt;Wizard is sough after by everyone but nobody wants a necro in their group<br/>
&gt;becuz necros aren&#39;t really that useful .<br/>

&gt;∩┐╜D∩┐╜∩┐╜: [_EQ_Magic] Random magic duration do you like it? wizard looser?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From: Wizard &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wizard@...">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;One big everquest problem is too much random effects, in magic it is <br/>
&gt;realy<br/>
&gt; &gt;deadly Verant aplied a random duration and effects in many things. Lets <br/>
&gt;say<br/>
&gt; &gt;for example spell SHADOW STEP and FADE hmm it teleports you in random<br/>
&gt; &gt;direction and random way from a casting place. It teleports you in lower<br/>
&gt; &gt;position so you can finish under water. But it is magic user last defence<br/>
&gt; &gt;when something comes in his directionhe can cast this and take at last a<br/>
&gt; &gt;fast stert running from enemy but .. as you cast it you have realy nice<br/>
&gt; &gt;probability to A. dont move at all b. teleport near your enemy and util <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt;understand where are you many times is too late.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Second example is INVISIBILITY hmmm duration is random thing and you <br/>
&gt;never<br/>
&gt; &gt;know how long it will stay you can find yourself in half of enemies and<br/>
&gt; &gt;death.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Maybe i miss something but i used a shadow step for some time now and <br/>
&gt;after<br/>
&gt; &gt;i died some times becouse it not function and it teleports me 1 step from <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt;place where i was before and until you get oriented where are you end a<br/>
&gt; &gt;monsters are all over you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;my suggestion is to make a shadow step with at last some minimum radius <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;second to put a limitation in lets say 40 grades from a point of view.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;do you have other problems with too much inprevedible random efects in<br/>
&gt;game?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Wizard looser?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From all classes a wizards have worst mana use as i see it no buffs but<br/>
&gt; &gt;strong damage but also too much mana used for this DD. Look at pets they<br/>
&gt; &gt;can stay as long as you wish around and all time do damage and serve as a<br/>
&gt; &gt;shield. i heared of many magician and enchanters not to talk about<br/>
&gt; &gt;necromancers wich can alone take 3 or 4 blue monsters some of them can <br/>
&gt;take<br/>
&gt; &gt;also on a yellow alone. as a wizard i never know of any who can take 3<br/>
&gt; &gt;blues alone after a 12 lv. In a group you must all time meditate for mana<br/>
&gt; &gt;all other have much longer battle use before remain OOM. If a group fight<br/>
&gt; &gt;red then a lower resistance of wizard spells can be used but after hard<br/>
&gt; &gt;fight as persons with more mana then others wizards take a too long time<br/>
&gt; &gt;meditating and all others will be ready to fight another battle before a<br/>
&gt; &gt;wizard. I hope that a specialiation will help and i heared of items wich<br/>
&gt; &gt;help mana regeneration wich are wizard specific.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Please help me to explain why a wizards are not a worst mage class?<br/>
