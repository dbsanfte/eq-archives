<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500900556">that is the reason i always tell wizards im grouped with to just be patient <br/>
and save their spells until the creature is past 50% damaged.  i guess if <br/>
they feel the need to help more they can learn to bandage or something, but <br/>
i think a quick finish is really doing thier job and i wouldnt fault them <br/>
for it- id just be grateful.<br/>

&gt;It is also why the creature will quickly stop attacking anyone and jump on<br/>
&gt;you :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(tough lesson, at early level 8. I was &quot;icing&quot; a Sand Scarab, as usual, but<br/>
&gt;the Monk I team with forgot at the beginning to click on its auto attack, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;was only using its special attacks. After the 2nd Shock of Ice, the Scarab<br/>
&gt;dropped all and ran straight to me... I had to fight it staff to claw, and<br/>
&gt;repeatedly attempt to go a spell thru... I managed it, but barely)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; dont give it credit.  also, necros have some pretty versatile spells, <br/>
&gt;such<br/>
&gt; &gt; as dark empathy (healing), dark pact series (gives us more mana- good <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt; extended fights), and such.  we also get many spells that cannot be<br/>
&gt; &gt; resisted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Necros are combos casters. Nothing they do is impressive in it, but the<br/>
&gt;association is a LOT more impressive.<br/>
