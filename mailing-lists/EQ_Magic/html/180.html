&gt;<br/>
&gt;This petition of yours is very interesting, and I must say that I fully<br/>
&gt;support your idea on making the monsters resists a bit lower, since<br/>
&gt;those spells do use up a lot of mana, and even if the melee classes<br/>
&gt;miss as much as the spells are resisted, they dont spend resources like<br/>
&gt;mana when fighting.  However, it is my firm believe that this is about<br/>
&gt;it.  I play more than one character, and let me tell you that when the<br/>
&gt;game is properly played, the wizards are far from being the class that<br/>
&gt;dies the most (the tanks are the ones that run the highest risk,<br/>
&gt;particularly the &quot;puller&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wizard dies much and in many cases when green one hit you on low mana you<br/>
risk death, in fight one spell to much and a MOB is on you and if somone<br/>
dont get it off you fast you are also dead, no gating to save your life and<br/>
so if you are to play outdoors all time then its better to play druid.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You see, as wizards, you are not supposed<br/>
&gt;to use the strongest spells until the monsters are at less than half<br/>
&gt;health.  You should blast them moderately as the tanks pick at them and<br/>
&gt;taunt, to keep the mosters busy.  You should do moderate blasts in<br/>
&gt;between the work of the tanks until the MOB is down to half health.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like to do this, and i do this but as you note that as you advance on lv<br/>
you start to do two things one is more damage and other is using less mana<br/>
for same amount of damage. so if you use your low damage spells to hit a<br/>
monster then you effectly use much more mana for same effect the numbers<br/>
are counting casting times and mana to damage ratio nearly 20 % to 40 %<br/>
more mana it is translated to 1 - 2 bubles of mana more ! And when monster<br/>
is runing from you if your spell is resisted you dont have time to cast<br/>
another ! If a monster is yellow then your root is also nearly useles as it<br/>
will be resisted too much times.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now blast away.  That way, even if you do a LOT of sudden damage, you<br/>
&gt;still havent done most, so the MOb won&#39;t fall into you instantly.  Let<br/>
&gt;the tanks take the blow as you stand back.  Since I have played many<br/>
&gt;sides of this (I have a ranger, this necro, a wiz, and a druid), I<br/>
&gt;should also give this suggestion to wizard players:  &quot;If the MOB starts<br/>
&gt;to hit on you, DON&#39;T RUN!!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is great suggestion if all group is not running then you have much<br/>
better chance to survive just staying and group telling HELP they will run<br/>
to your side if they are not already.<br/>
<br/>
  This will make it impossible for the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;tanks to get the MOB off.  At best, try to root him, or better yet, if<br/>
&gt;there is a ranger or druid with you, make them cast snare instead of<br/>
&gt;root.  Has higher success rate, and is overall more reliable.  The<br/>
&gt;cleric (or druid or shaman) can heal you and the tanks do better work<br/>
&gt;if they dont have to chase after a monster while contending with PL and<br/>
&gt;other mean variables.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, a few improvements can be<br/>
&gt;made on the classes, but the game has achieved quite a striking balance<br/>
&gt;once it is played in a group, as opposed to soloing.  Remember, this is<br/>
&gt;an online game; if you prefer to solo, this is not the game to play. <br/>
&gt;You should look out for Baldur&#39;s Gate, or Might and Magic and their<br/>
&gt;ilk, not for a game in which grouping and cooperation is the key.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I play always a wizard for at last 20 years and i can say that i like some<br/>
aspects of verant interpretation of this class but it is unfortunatly much<br/>
different from what i see many persons think a wizard is. I like to play in<br/>
group very much and it is nice thing but a wizard need a bard or enchanter<br/>
so get his mana up like warrior need cleric. But i have much less coments<br/>
on wizard solo play that i have for his group utility as a primary group<br/>
class a wizard have too much weak points one is hevy mana use wich mean<br/>
long meditation time, to much random effect group need a reliable members<br/>
to constantly pull things in and also to get them fast eliminated a wizard<br/>
is much more random then buffs or healing or pets they all work all time a<br/>
wizard 2 resisted spells are equal to 25% fire power less!! if a warrior<br/>
miss 2 times he is not useles for party any more a wizard easy can be.<br/>
Warrior you can count on him that will stay in front of MOB and get and<br/>
deal his amout of damage a wizard is too random thing he can do fast damage<br/>
when it is need to do it but he can also get ressisted too much and then<br/>
what for is his fast casting if it is not on MOB when you need it?<br/>
Becouse of this i suggested to make a spells resisted less when MOB have<br/>
less health.<br/>
