<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171274977">Very big problem is that verant dont have a time to balance classes and<br/>
races and whole game to be exact for high lv thet mean after lv 29 -30. In<br/>
beta there vere not enough people at high lv to make a exact balancing and<br/>
until one month ago some high lv dungeons in game where with monsters<br/>
without loot you can see that a lady vox a mighty dragon is even now tuned<br/>
in. So after lv 20 wizards were untuned, what you can se with problems with<br/>
lv 20 spells.<br/>
Many players in beta jumper right from lv 10 15 to lv 40 to be able to test<br/>
high lv but they nevarly never arived normaly at lv 50. only 2 guys using<br/>
some not so legal techicues made it very fast to get at high lv. so normal<br/>
balancing of high lv classes was never made and we see it proces now in<br/>
last patchs. Wizards have a right to have its share of funn in game if they<br/>
are weak at start they have right to be relatyve strong at end of game.<br/>
They are now not masters of DD spels as max lv spell is not in game, hiden<br/>
spells are to god hiden and they also are not masters of transport and they<br/>
have very anoying time needing to meditate much more of other classes and<br/>
are much easier to die depending of power of their spells, and low<br/>
defences. They are better balanced that some other classes, and are not<br/>
weakest class in game but they need some retouch and im sure many other<br/>
classes need retouch in need to follow idea what verant put in front of<br/>
class its group roles and overall game play and time needed to get to max<br/>
power lv it is valid for all classes.<br/>

&gt;&gt;You really don&#39;t get it that Wizard&#39;s are group only. Certain classes <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;&gt;solo but after level 25 no matter what class you play even necro it <br/>
&gt;becomes<br/>
&gt;&gt;inefficent to solo. My friend is a level 40 Wizard and he can deal <br/>
&gt;damage<br/>
&gt;&gt;just fine. A Wizzard and a Warrior are perfect for each other all you <br/>
&gt;need<br/>
&gt;&gt;is a Cleric and your set. I just think you really missed the point of <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;Wizard Class.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Last nights party consisted of a cleric, a druid, and four wizards.  <br/>
&gt;The<br/>
&gt;&gt;average Red lasted about 7 seconds, the Yellows lasted less than 5 - it<br/>
&gt;&gt;looked like nighttime over Baghdad out there.  A caster-heavy party <br/>
