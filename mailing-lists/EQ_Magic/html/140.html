<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212468171">How about a 9th level cleric?  The huts outside of crushbone give me very<br/>
little experience now, but I&#39;m nervous about going into Crushbone solo with<br/>
all the trains that run through there.<br/>

Crushbone is very dangerus area i dont know what lv do you have but as i<br/>
spend there from my 6 to 11 lv i know it very vell moust important is to<br/>
move from a entrance tunel it is a train magnet. You must find any place<br/>
out of trains rutes. some places at slaver huts are safe. If you can say<br/>
what lv are you i can give you precise indications where to go.<br/>
