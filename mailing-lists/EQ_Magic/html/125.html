<b>Subject:</b> Wizard what are we? (Long, hmm very long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-29301618">What is definition of wizard ? I liked to start this thread as I see that many<br/>
people don∩┐╜t understand what is a idea for a wizard class is in Everquest and<br/>
what is to be changed so that we can be better in our role. So here is a my<br/>
look on this maybe I∩┐╜m wrong but that is why we are here ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Wizard is a master Explorer he looks for a knowledge about world, magic, items<br/>
and people all around a world. Why he do this is of many reasons to help his<br/>
greed for immense power?, wish to help a weak ones or any other reason it is<br/>
not important now but all wizards try to do this.<br/>
To be able to do this he is a god land traveler, he can unleash a nice power in<br/>
combat and he can see things from long away. <br/>
<br/>
I divide a letter from here on in 3 parts<br/>
1st is my propose,  what to change so that our class can better execute our<br/>
role in world of North<br/>
 2nd is what explanation of what I see that we are now <br/>
 3rd  is spell grouping <br/>
<br/>
1. -------<br/>
<br/>
As I see our class must combat to get <br/>
<br/>
a.) better run from combat teleport spells - shadow step with minimum range -<br/>
faster gate - second bind point (in zone only) it can be some type of faster<br/>
gate for run from combat spells<br/>
<br/>
b.) Better exploration spells like invisible eye of zoom with longer duration.<br/>
<br/>
c.) Item locator. As we are item hunters we can have a spell which can function<br/>
as ranger tracker for items in zone so we can see all items in zone and we can<br/>
turn in direction where item is !! <br/>
<br/>
d.) faster mana recovery then other classes - ( or by higher meditation limit<br/>
lets say (level +1) * 7 or by specific items wizard only later in game) - why<br/>
this you can ask. because in combat other classes have a mana battery which is<br/>
a pet it can defend, attack and also sacrifice and many more long duration<br/>
buffing spells.<br/>
<br/>
e.) one thing which is not wizard specific but influence us, is to make a<br/>
meditation more diversifying I wish to play a game not to stay looking all time<br/>
in same page or go in WC, kitchen when I meditate it will be nice to have <br/>
- internal email system<br/>
- two chat windows so that I can access general all server chat same one which<br/>
we can go in from server screen in one window and to hear what going on in game<br/>
in other window<br/>
- in game class oriented mailing lists<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.----<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- He is a weakest class in all Norath looking at hit points,  but he is a major<br/>
destructive power in game also.<br/>
<br/>
- Wizard casts Direct Damage DD spells faster than anyone else and with more<br/>
force than anyone else. We as a class get a DD spell EVERY level and we have a<br/>
best mana damage ratio on them.<br/>
<br/>
- Wizards have a experience diminution I don∩┐╜t know how much for sure but it is<br/>
near 10 - 15 %.<br/>
<br/>
- Wizards are very weak at start and at lv 20 start to be traveler and only at<br/>
lv 34 + start to be a force in all ways from solo to group play with all line<br/>
of plane travel and group rescue spells.<br/>
( you see that a spells go from a 5 (1 lv.)- 15 (4 lv) - 35 (8 lv) - 80 (12 lv)<br/>
- 105 (16 lv) all times mana gives you cc. 5 shots before go out of mana OOM<br/>
when you go up in lv you get a some additional roots in)<br/>
<br/>
- Wizard combat definition is major damage in shortest time! <br/>
- Enchanter goes with more suptile tactic with pet, weaking enemy or charming<br/>
        - necromancer rely on his strong pet and Damage Over Time spells DOT<br/>
where he is a master this spells do in time much more damage then DD spells of<br/>
wizards but..)<br/>
- Magician is support ( food, bandages, heatstone etc )and (now reinforced) pet<br/>
man.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
