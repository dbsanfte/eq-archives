&gt; I don&#39;t want to get anyone mad at me but,  <br/>
&gt; this is an RPG.  ROLE PLAYING GAME!!!!  The reason skills where put in the game was to enhance the RPG experience.  It isn&#39;t all supposed to be, who can make the most money the fastest with the highest lvl.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Skills are not utterly pointless.  They allow you to emerge yourself into your character without the constant:   You hit a gnoll for 14 damage.<br/>
&gt; for 10 hours a session.  I know some skills cost more than you get out of them, but think of it as a gaming dynamics.  It is supposed to be FUN guys.  If your not having fun, don&#39;t play.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry if I affended anyone, but I needed to vent an this situation.  It seems everyone has something bad to say.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that role-playing is the heart of the game.  But I have to keep<br/>
asking myself: &quot;Why would my character spend all of his money developing a<br/>
trade that provides no benefit?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I mean, aren&#39;t trade skills supposed to represent _jobs_ in EQ?  If so,<br/>
wouldn&#39;t you expect to _make_ money by using them?  If the skill was<br/>
&quot;Throwing money into the water&quot; (something to practice while fishing, I<br/>
guess), I would expect that the skill would provide no benefit, and<br/>
my character would develop it for some other reason (perhaps, because he <br/>
is a loony).<br/>
<br/>
I see no inconsistency in being a true role-player and whining about the<br/>
fact that you make no money by &lt;insert trade skill&gt;.  IRL, I whine that<br/>
the jobs I&#39;d like to have don&#39;t pay enough.  So, why shouldn&#39;t my<br/>
character complain, ESPECIALLY when the skill makes him no money at all?<br/>
