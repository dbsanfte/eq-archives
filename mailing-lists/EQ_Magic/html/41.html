<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-707991179">&lt;html&gt;<br/>
God news for all magic users for all of you wich dont take a look in<br/>
updated manual this is news about specialization skill also there are<br/>
some changes in spells some are removed as all line of &quot; move<br/>
item&quot; spells probably as result of recent offers for sell in real $<br/>
as we can see at ebay so it at last will not be so easy. Most changes are<br/>
for enchanter wich life start to be easier and necromancer. What is most<br/>
important is that we finaly start to get some feedback to see what change<br/>
and what are plans to change and we can react in base of this. &lt;br&gt;<br/>
Write feedback in game on all things wich you wish to see or change,<br/>
discuss it on boards or on mail lists so that we can ALL put a presion in<br/>
same direction to show our wishes and to have hope to see it hapnd. I<br/>
suggest a petition on shadow step spell :)&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;b&gt;Specialization&nbsp; New Functionality&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;/b&gt;The various Specialization skills will be implemented such that if a<br/>
spell is cast in, for example, the abjuration family, the<br/>
Specialization&nbsp; Abjuration skill will be checked (if present) and if<br/>
successful, will decrease the amount of mana used to cast the<br/>
spell.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Specialization skills are as follows:&nbsp;<br/>
Specialization&nbsp; Abjuration, Specialization&nbsp; Alteration,<br/>
Specialization&nbsp; Conjuration, Specialization&nbsp; Divination, and<br/>
Specialization&nbsp; Evocation.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
other important spells news&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;font size=4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spells&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;font size=3&gt;Please note that Beta was used for testing<br/>
spells.&nbsp; Some spells did not make the final cut for release.&nbsp;<br/>
This is what Beta was used for&nbsp; testing the viability of spells and<br/>
their impact upon game balance.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Unless noted below, all spells work with their intended effects. &lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;b&gt;Scheduled Changes&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;/b&gt;Identify: The identify spell was originally going to reveal the<br/>
statistics of an item (Damage, Weight, Weapon Speed, Ac, etc.).&nbsp; We<br/>
decided, however, to leave in the Beta ability of right-clicking an item<br/>
for information.&nbsp; The identify spell will soon be used for revealing<br/>
the lore, if any, associated with item.&nbsp; Lore will only be found on<br/>
high magic or Artifact level items&nbsp; an item with lore will typically<br/>
be rare. &lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Detect Magic: This spell will be replaced with a new spell sometime in<br/>
the near future.&nbsp; All players who have purchased this spell will<br/>
have it automatically updated into their spell books.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Whirl till you hurl: This spell works as intended and at full<br/>
effect.&nbsp; There is a display error, where a ∩┐╜monster∩┐╜ will not be<br/>
seen to spin when the spell is cast on them.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will be<br/>
fixed shortly.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Illusion: Air Elemental, Water Elemental and Fire Elemental: There is a<br/>
display error that causes Enchanters who cast the illusion to look like<br/>
Earth Elementals.&nbsp; This is only a display error&nbsp; all NPC<br/>
reactions are still based on the appropriate elemental type.&nbsp; This<br/>
will be fixed shortly.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changed&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size=3&gt;Dark Pact and Allure of Death&nbsp; these spells<br/>
will no longer change your form in to that of a skeleton.&nbsp; The<br/>
remaining effects work as in Beta.&nbsp; Higher level versions of this<br/>
spell will continue to change your form to that of a skeleton.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Whirling Wind, Chaotic Feedback, Sanity Warp, Dizzying Wind, Force Shock<br/>
and Chaos Flux: These spells are listed in the Strategy guild with the<br/>
phrase ∩┐╜Direct Damage and 2 sec stun,∩┐╜ where they should be&nbsp; listed<br/>
to say&nbsp; ∩┐╜Direct damage and knock the target our of spell<br/>
casting.∩┐╜&nbsp; These spells will disrupt spell casting, forcing the<br/>
target to begin casting their spell again. &lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Removed&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size=3&gt;Enchantment of Light&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Enchantment of Brilliance&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Winged Courier&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Umbral Messenger&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Detect Magic&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>

attack.&nbsp; Formally, this spell added to your attack roll.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
