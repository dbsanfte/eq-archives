 </span></blockquote>This is incorrect. I can (Magician) give weapons to other players. I<br/>
have to hand them out a lot in Unrest. Ghouls can&#39;t be hit by brute<br/>
force alone. But as for the pet thing, that too is wrong (once again for<br/>
mages). Mage pet&#39;s can&#39;t wield weapons (of course you CAN give weapons<br/>
to magician pets, and they say Thank you.<br/>
