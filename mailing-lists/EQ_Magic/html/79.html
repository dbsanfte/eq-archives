&gt;<br/>
&gt; One big everquest problem is too much random effects, in magic it is realy<br/>
&gt; deadly Verant aplied a random duration and effects in many things. Lets say<br/>
&gt; for example spell SHADOW STEP and FADE hmm it teleports you in random<br/>
&gt; direction and random way from a casting place. It teleports you in lower<br/>
&gt; position so you can finish under water. But it is magic user last defence<br/>
&gt; when something comes in his directionhe can cast this and take at last a<br/>
&gt; fast stert running from enemy but .. as you cast it you have realy nice<br/>
&gt; probability to A. dont move at all b. teleport near your enemy and util you<br/>
&gt; understand where are you many times is too late.<br/>
&gt; Second example is INVISIBILITY hmmm duration is random thing and you never<br/>
&gt; know how long it will stay you can find yourself in half of enemies and<br/>
&gt; death.<br/>
&gt; Maybe i miss something but i used a shadow step for some time now and after<br/>
&gt; i died some times becouse it not function and it teleports me 1 step from a<br/>
&gt; place where i was before and until you get oriented where are you end a<br/>
&gt; monsters are all over you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; my suggestion is to make a shadow step with at last some minimum radius and<br/>
&gt; second to put a limitation in lets say 40 grades from a point of view.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; do you have other problems with too much inprevedible random efects in game?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wizard looser?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From all classes a wizards have worst mana use as i see it no buffs but<br/>
&gt; strong damage but also too much mana used for this DD. Look at pets they<br/>
&gt; can stay as long as you wish around and all time do damage and serve as a<br/>
&gt; shield. i heared of many magician and enchanters not to talk about<br/>
&gt; necromancers wich can alone take 3 or 4 blue monsters some of them can take<br/>
&gt; also on a yellow alone. as a wizard i never know of any who can take 3<br/>
&gt; blues alone after a 12 lv. In a group you must all time meditate for mana<br/>
&gt; all other have much longer battle use before remain OOM. If a group fight<br/>
&gt; red then a lower resistance of wizard spells can be used but after hard<br/>
&gt; fight as persons with more mana then others wizards take a too long time<br/>
&gt; meditating and all others will be ready to fight another battle before a<br/>
&gt; wizard. I hope that a specialiation will help and i heared of items wich<br/>
&gt; help mana regeneration wich are wizard specific.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please help me to explain why a wizards are not a worst mage class?<br/>
