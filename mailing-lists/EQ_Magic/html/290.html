&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi Everyone...<br/>
&gt; 	I&#39;m not sure how people are on this list, I even forgot that I was<br/>
&gt; on it<br/>
&gt; until the last thread showed up!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question is this:   I have a lvl 16 Druid, and I&#39;m up to date on all my<br/>
&gt; spells, but I often don&#39;t use them like I should.  Does anyone out there<br/>
&gt; have any tips on what spells are good for soloing?  Another unrelated<br/>
&gt; question..... Does anyone here know where a good place to hunt solo would<br/>
&gt; be?  I&#39;m having a difficult time finding decent places to go without<br/>
&gt; getting<br/>
&gt; killed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for an tips in advance...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mike<br/>

what I hear Lava Storm is really good around those levels as well.<br/>
