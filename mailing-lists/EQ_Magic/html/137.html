&gt;  have to sit and rest more than I would in a group or because I can only<br/>
&gt;  take blues instead of yellows or reds. But I did very much mind losing 1/2<br/>
&gt;  bubble or more everytime I died. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I understand that the game is suppossed to be challenging and is meant to<br/>
&gt;  be geared for people to work together. But sometimes, I would prefer to<br/>
&gt;  work alone and I don&#39;t think I should be penalized for it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the goals you must put forth for yourself is to add one friend at a <br/>
time that is competent in battle.  Just like adding nice items to a <br/>
collection.  Do not tell me it is unfair you must do so, because the same <br/>
argument applies to everything else.  Do you intend to wear cloth armor and <br/>
use non magical items for your entire career?  No, add nicer things a piece <br/>
at a time.<br/>
