Still no answer off the shaman list eh drokk? so far as i know no-one has <br/>
done it but I would expect it to be done in the next week or so (quest <br/>
didn&#39;t look that hard).<br/>
<br/>
Enchanter Pets-<br/>
maybe in overthere or firona if there is spell vendors, but otherwise you <br/>
are stuck with HH. my advice is to save up and buy 3 or 4 pet spells at a <br/>
time, as i had about a 30% kill rate with my enchanter running through kith <br/>
(even during the day! damn werewolf!)<br/>
