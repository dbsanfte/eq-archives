<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744822913">You are very much incorrect on the kill information.  There have been <br/>
several posts by Brad discussing switching from individuals to group <br/>
totals for kill determination.  As it stand currently damage is <br/>
calculated based upon individuals, not groups for determining who gets <br/>
the kills.<br/>
<br/>
The below is commentary clipped from the archive section of EQ Vault <br/>
(direct URL is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqvault.com/archive/19990627.shtml">http://www.eqvault.com/archive/19990627.shtml</a> look in <br/>
28JUN date for the info), which clearly shows they are calculating on <br/>
individuals.  As Brad mentions they are looking to move to a group <br/>
aggregate for kill determination but I have yet to anything showing <br/>
they have made that move.<br/>
<br/>
Brad on Kill Stealing <br/>
Verant VP Brad McQuaid responded to a comment on the subject of Kill <br/>
Stealing made by Aetherial on our General Board. Here&#39;s an excerpt from <br/>
the original post followed by Brad&#39;s complete response: <br/>
I understand your point about kill stealing the OTHER way (ie groups <br/>
stealing from individuals) I don&#39;t believe it could be as serious a <br/>
problem as currently individual casters stealing from groups. The <br/>
reason is simple, your developers obviously have taken great pains to <br/>
make this a group oriented game so given the choice I would favor the <br/>
groups. To favor only certain classes in their ability to solo is a <br/>
serious imbalance. Going the other way simply levels the playing field <br/>
for all. <br/>
Hrm. Maybe we&#39;ll try it the group aggregate damage way, and see how <br/>
people like it and whether it helps with kill stealing or not. I&#39;ll <br/>
just make sure my programmer comments out the old code so he can put it <br/>
back if necessary :) <br/>
Give us a few weeks and I&#39;ll try to get this change implemented on a <br/>
trial basis. <br/>

&gt;the individual who did the most damage.  This would help quit a bit in <br/>

damage it get a kill, but one group can be also one wizard, also you <br/>
must<br/>
note that in high hold are 3 or more groups casting spells on MOB so it <br/>
is<br/>
needed much less damage to get kill and one hit of 20 lv wizard can do <br/>
177<br/>
damage it can be easy enough to get him a kill if more than 3 groups <br/>
fight<br/>
over MOB. this problem is not of long time it ends nearly at lv 29 when<br/>
wizards dont have to much places and power to kill steal from others in<br/>
time without ding eheheh.<br/>
you can say that a wizard is in same situation before a lv 16 when <br/>
nearly<br/>
any warrior class can steal from him ehehehehe.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Kiting is the art of hitting a monster with DOT&#39;s, then running away <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;&gt; him and letting your spells kill him. Hopefully you are using SOW or <br/>
&gt;an<br/>
&gt;&gt; item to increase your speed so the monster can&#39;t catch you.<br/>
