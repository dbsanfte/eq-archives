So dear friends finaly verant guys found<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that death penality is too big in world where is so easy to die by thousnds<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of random things wich can provoke it and if you must to pass 3 zones to get<br/>\n&gt;&gt; your corpse i think that you will thing twice about daing a same mistake<br/>\n&gt;&gt; again. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I died so many times this weekend- it was pathetic and frustrating and had<br/>\n&gt;me seriously thinking about quitting the game altogether. I was trying to<br/>\n&gt;solo in Crushbone and I only go out of the zone transition area once. The<br/>\n&gt;trains would come in, my pet and I could handle all the green orcs and<br/>\n&gt;then a slaver or taskmaster would show up and it was all over.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Since the only things I&#39;d been killing were green orcs, I was losing more<br/>\n&gt;experience than I was making. It was completely disheartening and I<br/>\n&gt;finally went back to the Chessboard in Butcherblock to make up the<br/>\n&gt;experience I lost. I find the Chessboard sort of boring and it is not very<br/>\n&gt;good for loot either. In short, by getting killed three times, I&#39;d lost<br/>\n&gt;all the experience I&#39;d made in a week and was driven to go fight in an<br/>\n&gt;area that didn&#39;t interest me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Which made the game not fun anymore. Luckily, I didn&#39;t make any rash<br/>\n&gt;decisions. I&#39;m level 10 and one of my goals in the game is to get to level<br/>\n&gt;20. Hopefully, this lowering of the death penalty will help me accomplish<br/>\n&gt;this goal with the minimum amount of frustration and the maximum amount of<br/>\n&gt;fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anya<br/>\n&gt;High Elf Magician<br/>\n&gt;Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Silverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
