As I check the boards<br/>\nand see people acheiving 10th level after just two days, I have come to<br/>\none conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI either really suck at EQ, or I understand it completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI take the time to make friendships and go on group adventures into the<br/>\nbowels of some really nasty cave/dungeoun/city.  The XP spread isn&#39;t<br/>\nreally that good amongst the group (I go with higher levels), so I am very<br/>\nslowly climbing the scale... <br/>\n<br/>\nI bought EQ because leading a life I always wanted, a life of magik and<br/>\nmystery, is a real good experience (did I mention I loved RPG in AD&D and<br/>\nplaying Quake?  I see EQ takes the best parts of the two and makes it into<br/>\na bastard-wonder child).<br/>\n<br/>\nCall me amateur, tell me I suck, but there alot more of online friends out<br/>\nin Norrath then you, and they love having me around for who I am (and me<br/>\nto them)<br/>\n<br/>\nKapolokok <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 11 May 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:duffjc@...\">duffjc@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:duffjc@...\">duffjc@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to get anyone mad at me but,  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; this is an RPG.  ROLE PLAYING GAME!!!!  The reason skills where put in the game was to enhance the RPG experience.  It isn&#39;t all supposed to be, who can make the most money the fastest with the highest lvl.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Skills are not utterly pointless.  They allow you to emerge yourself into your character without the constant:   You hit a gnoll for 14 damage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; for 10 hours a session.  I know some skills cost more than you get out of them, but think of it as a gaming dynamics.  It is supposed to be FUN guys.  If your not having fun, don&#39;t play.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry if I affended anyone, but I needed to vent an this situation.
