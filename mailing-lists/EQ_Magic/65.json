Ok I ALWAYS know what level of pet I have.<br/>\nA general rule is the higher the level then they have all of the skills.<br/>\nOk first off we all understand that black/white is even and same level. Ok<br/>\nwell then you learn the second step is that yellow is one level above you.<br/>\nBut in actuallity when you get level 16ish or so yellow can mean 2 levels.<br/>\nBut at 16 I never get a yellow pet. I usually just get an even pet. Err<br/>\nwhen I was 16. Well then I turned 17. So I know this. As you notice things<br/>\ncon blue when they are lower. Well in the lower levels there are pretty<br/>\nmuch 2 basic blues<br/>\n<br/>\nrisky but upper hand<br/>\nand risky but worth a try<br/>\n<br/>\nWell upper hand means 2 levels below you and worth a try means one level<br/>\nbelow you.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow when I was level 15. My goal was this, to summon a upper hand pet.<br/>\nOther stuff was green. Simple as that. Then I knew my pet was going to be a<br/>\nlevel 12 pet. Simple. Now at level 16 it changes a bit. They add one more<br/>\nblue and it goes like this..from lowest to highest..this is blue<br/>\nconning..err 2 more..pardon me<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nrisky but upper hand 3 levels below<br/>\nrisky but worth a try 2 levels below<br/>\nrisky but dangerous one level below<br/>\n<br/>\nNow risky but dangerous is one level below and so forth. Though I believe<br/>\nthat insteafd of upper hand it says something &quot;you should be able to..but<br/>\nnot certain&quot; but ti is blue. I haven&#39;t paid much attnetion. I just always<br/>\nknow what my target con is. So you all people want a high level pet. Well<br/>\nthat is how to do it. I personally think it would be a waste of time to<br/>\nhave a spell to do it when they give us a way already. I don&#39;t need a spell<br/>\nto con my pet. Well that is my 2 cents.  <br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n______________<br/>\nI added this for general reference<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S \tGreen more then 3 lv below you mostly dont attack unles attacked or<br/>\nyou sit near them.<br/>\n\t\tWhite is same lv as you<br/>\n\t\tBlack 1 lv more than you ( im not shure on it buged?)<br/>\n\t\tYellow 2 lv more than you<br/>\n\t\tRed 3 lv more than you<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator<br/>\n<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
