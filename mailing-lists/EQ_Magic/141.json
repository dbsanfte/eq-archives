How about a group that where there is no real leader and people<br/>\n&gt;attack things wily-nily, thinking that someone is covering their backs,<br/>\n&gt;only to find out that there are now 6 yellow monsters for a 4 person<br/>\n&gt;group?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a shame you aren&#39;t on Fennin Ro.  I like to group with people who keep<br/>\nthese things in mind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recommend soloing, not Crushbone at least.  Orcs spawn too often<br/>\nand too close together there - and they have a nasty habit of running away<br/>\nand returning with reinforcements.  I&#39;ve had a lot of luck with a three<br/>\nperson crew there - a wiz (me), a druid, and a paladin.  The classes though<br/>\ndon&#39;t matter nearly as much as the people playing them though.  If you&#39;re<br/>\nwith a group that has the same concerns in mind that you do, you&#39;ll do fine<br/>\n- but if it&#39;s like trying to herd cats, you&#39;re with the wrong people and<br/>\nthey&#39;ll probably get you killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSend me a tell if you ever come over to Fennin Ro.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPennaggolan, 3rd Circle Wizard of Felwithe<br/>\nFamous last words: &quot;Hail, D&#39;Vinn.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
