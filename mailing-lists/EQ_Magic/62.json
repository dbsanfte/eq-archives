If you have ever been out of  the US you will notice how <br/>\nmuch more in general most consumer goods are.  It is the variety of <br/>\neconomy that makes EQ interesting.  In fact they even note in the <br/>\ninstructions that certain vendors will pay more for you goods then <br/>\nothers (town vendors versus vendors out in the wilderness).  What I <br/>\nthink would be of more benefit would be the ability to make money from <br/>\nbuying goods say in Freeport, and then bringing them to Felwithe to <br/>\nsell for a profit.  While I can appreciate Verant&#39;s attempt to create a <br/>\ntotally player driven economy; one should be able to make a minimal <br/>\nliving dealing with NPC&#39;s to some extent (with the exception of <br/>\nfishing).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn particular the creation of magic jewelry kills me.  I create <br/>\nsomething for 5.5PP, sell it to a vendor for 4.5PP, he in turn marks it <br/>\nup to 98PP.  You should at least be able to recover your initial <br/>\ninvestment on these trade skills (not to mention the fact all the money <br/>\nlost on failures).<br/>\n<br/>\nMerauk<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\nEnchanter <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: bbutler <br/>\nSent: Monday, May 10, 1999 10:25 AM<br/>\nTo: .EQ.Magic<br/>\nCc: bbutler<br/>\nSubject: Re: [_EQ_Magic] Malachite in Qeynos?

So what if the prices are <br/>\ndifferent.. That is part of the game. I get my spells a bunch cheaper <br/>\nin Felwithe than other places. As in RL life, it expensive to travel <br/>\nfrom home atleast you dont have to pay for a hotel evernight. But i <br/>\nfind the loot and experience is worth the trip.  IF you think it is bad <br/>\nbeing what everrace you are.. Try a Dark Elf.. Most will merchants <br/>\nwill Kill you on sight, if they dont they mostlikely wont sell to you.  <br/>\nTry having to rely on friends to sell for you evernight or traveling <br/>\nback to the commons or neriak.. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Vincent Archer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Vincent.Archer@...\">Vincent.Archer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to myself:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Merchants are racists.

There&#39;s a difference of 2 gold, 8 silver and 1 copper <br/>\nbetween<br/>\nthe Freeport prices and the Felwithe prices, adding to over a 1 <br/>\nplatinum<br/>\nwhen I purchased all the 8 levels spells I wanted (Shock of Frost, <br/>\nShadow<br/>\nStep, Shielding, Eye of Zoom).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt made a large difference. I was unable to purchase all spells if I<br/>\nremained in Freeport, but making the trip was worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference in percentage remains at level 12; there&#39;s a 4 gold<br/>\ndifference in prices.  I&#39;ll see if I still feel the need to spare 2pp <br/>\nover<br/>\nthe 12th level spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n                      Free Games, Cash Prizes!<br/>\n            Gamesville - World&#39;s Biggest Game Show Site!<br/>\n                <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBill Butler<br/>\nOwner<br/>\nInternet Butler Company<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nCongratulations to &quot;Trail Rider,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nVisit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
