I liked to start this thread as I see that many<br/>\n&gt;people don&#39;t understand what is a idea for a wizard class is in Everquest and<br/>\n&gt;what is to be changed so that we can be better in our role. So here is a my<br/>\n&gt;look on this maybe I&#39;m wrong but that is why we are here ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wizard is a master Explorer he looks for a knowledge about world, magic, items<br/>\n&gt;and people all around a world. Why he do this is of many reasons to help his<br/>\n&gt;greed for immense power?, wish to help a weak ones or any other reason it is<br/>\n&gt;not important now but all wizards try to do this.<br/>\n&gt;To be able to do this he is a god land traveler, he can unleash a nice power in<br/>\n&gt;combat and he can see things from long away. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I divide a letter from here on in 3 parts<br/>\n&gt;1st is my propose,  what to change so that our class can better execute our<br/>\n&gt;role in world of North<br/>\n&gt; 2nd is what explanation of what I see that we are now <br/>\n&gt; 3rd  is spell grouping <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1. -------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As I see our class must combat to get <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;a.) better run from combat teleport spells - shadow step with minimum range -<br/>\n&gt;faster gate - second bind point (in zone only) it can be some type of faster<br/>\n&gt;gate for run from combat spells<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you give a second bind point to wizards then all other magi or clerical<br/>\ncasters deserve one too. This would in effect give you &quot;recall&quot; which Verant<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want. Nor do I actually.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;b.) Better exploration spells like invisible eye of zoom with longer duration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;c.) Item locator. As we are item hunters we can have a spell which can function<br/>\n&gt;as ranger tracker for items in zone so we can see all items in zone and we can<br/>\n&gt;turn in direction where item is !! <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If this spell belongs to anyone it should be Enchanters, thsoe who create,<br/>\nalter and destroy artifacts and items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;d.) faster mana recovery then other classes - ( or by higher meditation limit<br/>\n&gt;lets say (level +1) * 7 or by specific items wizard only later in game) - why<br/>\n&gt;this you can ask. because in combat other classes have a mana battery which is<br/>\n&gt;a pet it can defend, attack and also sacrifice and many more long duration<br/>\n&gt;buffing spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again there is no legitimate reason for thsi to be asked for especially as a<br/>\nclass specific thing.  In reference to your rationale, well in combat other<br/>\nclasses can&#39;t cast as damaging spells or as fast as you can.  Also to<br/>\nrecover the mana from a pet requires the waastage of one of the 8 spell<br/>\nslots and it isn&#39;t a very mana efficient operation in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;e.) one thing which is not wizard specific but influence us, is to make a<br/>\n&gt;meditation more diversifying I wish to play a game not to stay looking all time<br/>\n&gt;in same page or go in WC, kitchen when I meditate it will be nice to have <br/>\n&gt;- internal email system<br/>\n&gt;- two chat windows so that I can access general all server chat same one which<br/>\n&gt;we can go in from server screen in one window and to hear what going on in game<br/>\n&gt;in other window<br/>\n&gt;- in game class oriented mailing lists<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2.----<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nSilverlock,  ICQ 474725\t\t\t<br/>\n<br/>\nHousehold Pests?
