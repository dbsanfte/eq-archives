ROLE PLAYING GAME!!!!  The reason skills where put in the game was to enhance the RPG experience.  It isn&#39;t all supposed to be, who can make the most money the fastest with the highest lvl.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Skills are not utterly pointless.  They allow you to emerge yourself into your character without the constant:   You hit a gnoll for 14 damage.<br/>\n&gt; for 10 hours a session.  I know some skills cost more than you get out of them, but think of it as a gaming dynamics.  It is supposed to be FUN guys.  If your not having fun, don&#39;t play.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry if I affended anyone, but I needed to vent an this situation.  It seems everyone has something bad to say.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that role-playing is the heart of the game.  But I have to keep<br/>\nasking myself: &quot;Why would my character spend all of his money developing a<br/>\ntrade that provides no benefit?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, aren&#39;t trade skills supposed to represent _jobs_ in EQ?  If so,<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t you expect to _make_ money by using them?  If the skill was<br/>\n&quot;Throwing money into the water&quot; (something to practice while fishing, I<br/>\nguess), I would expect that the skill would provide no benefit, and<br/>\nmy character would develop it for some other reason (perhaps, because he <br/>\nis a loony).<br/>\n<br/>\nI see no inconsistency in being a true role-player and whining about the<br/>\nfact that you make no money by &lt;insert trade skill&gt;.  IRL, I whine that<br/>\nthe jobs I&#39;d like to have don&#39;t pay enough.  So, why shouldn&#39;t my<br/>\ncharacter complain, ESPECIALLY when the skill makes him no money at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Peanut</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
