I like to play a wizard as i play wizards in all games for more than 12 years now,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1470828303\">In my first post i don&#39;t explained it good so i try to explain it better. <br/>\nI like to play a wizard as i play wizards in all games for more than 12<br/>\nyears now, but if we talk about balancing all magic users to same lv then i<br/>\nsee some problems with  a wizard class, i wish to see your comments on this<br/>\nand other ideas to make a game more playable without throwing a balance out<br/>\nor tring to make a overpowerfull class.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst positive things<br/>\n<br/>\n-  wizards are great for plane(after 34+ lv), group travel (druid is best<br/>\nin individual and nearly as good in group)<br/>\n-  wizards are best in DD damage spells (but not in damage to mana ratio DOT)<br/>\n-  wizards spells are less resisted and it damage at last for one part<br/>\nmoust other class spells are resisted full<br/>\n-  wizard is fastest to deal a massive damage in shortest time (but a price?)<br/>\n<br/>\nNegativ things<br/>\n<br/>\n- Wizards have lowest defence, hit points and ac of all classes (lowest<br/>\ncombat survivel)<br/>\n- wizard spells do massive damage but also use masive mana but when wizard<br/>\nuses it mana it is useless. \tFighting is not a wizard strong side, wizard<br/>\ndont have pets, dont have buffs, dont heal, they dont run well.<br/>\n- Wizards risks very very much in combat agains only 2 blues<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst i don&#39;t wish to say that a wizard is not good or playable class it is<br/>\nnice but it is also a class with most downtime of all clases so as a result<br/>\na 2 equaly expert people playing sametime will never get equal play time,<br/>\nwizard will most time be in his book. Why this hmm lets see<br/>\n<br/>\nAll other Magic users have better mana usage then wizard, why pet is a best<br/>\nmana use it damages, it defend, it tount and it never expires until it dies<br/>\n( i personaly dont like this pets i wish to have a cat or dog od mouse :-)<br/>\nnot for combat but as familiar ) . Buffs as result do more damage and DOT<br/>\nspells are much more mana efficent then our DD spells. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what can be done to make a wizard a time efficent to play as other<br/>\nclasses are. I suggest a faster mana recovering ratio not too much but a<br/>\n1.3 or 1.2 faster times can help and its easy to implement one number<br/>\nchange in formula and go go go.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere i dont put in effect of specialization as for now it is not in game (<br/>\nlong beta ) and i dont know if in later levels exist any only wizard mana<br/>\nregeneration booster but i heared of &quot;mana stone&quot; but noone knows what it<br/>\nis and when you find it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all for reading and as i live in italy my english is not maxed yet,<br/>\nbut i please you to join a discussion and to not take to hard my spelling<br/>\nmistakes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12.46 13/05/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I play an enchanter of Cazic-Thule and you are absolutely right.  I was  <br/>\n&gt;leafing through the spells last night and there are some GREAT! combo&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt;for Necromancers.  If I had to do it all over again I would definitely  <br/>\n&gt;play one.  Personally I think the ranking is necromancer, enchanter,  <br/>\n&gt;magician, and then wizard last.   <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Necro&#39;s rate number one because they get a pet, can do good damage, can  <br/>\n&gt;heal themselves and others, can do dark pact.<br/>\n&gt;Enchanters rate number two because they are almost a complete hybrid  <br/>\n&gt;between magician and wizard.  Plus they can make magic items.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Magicians are number three because they can do decent damage and get a  <br/>\n&gt;really good pet series.<br/>\n&gt;Wizards in my opinion aren&#39;t that great.  They do some more damage with  <br/>\n&gt;their spells then the other classes but not that much more.  In my  <br/>\n&gt;opinion their inability to have a pet really hampers them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: tonyb72  <br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, May 13, 1999 10:35 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: .EQ.Magic<br/>\n&gt;Cc: tonyb72<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [_EQ_Magic] Random magic duration do you like it? wizard  <br/>\n&gt;looser?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Tony B&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tonyb72@...\">tonyb72@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;thats not really true- i believe most people dont group with necros  <br/>\n&gt;because  <br/>\n&gt;they arent really aware of what they can do.  with our dot spells we  <br/>\n&gt;can  <br/>\n&gt;actually do the most damage to a creature, although it isnt as  <br/>\n&gt;impressive as  <br/>\n&gt;a wizard hitting with one spell for 50 damage or whatever; but if i can  <br/>\n&gt;cast  <br/>\n&gt;three dot spells on a creature at the beginning of the fight, that is  <br/>\n&gt;some  <br/>\n&gt;tough damage.  the problem is that its effects are mostly unseen, so  <br/>\n&gt;people  <br/>\n&gt;dont give it credit.  also, necros have some pretty versatile spells,  <br/>\n&gt;such  <br/>\n&gt;as dark empathy (healing), dark pact series (gives us more mana- good  <br/>\n&gt;for  <br/>\n&gt;extended fights), and such.  we also get many spells that cannot be  <br/>\n&gt;resisted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;belphenor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ps. with a pet, i have killed 3 skels by myself.  it was close tho, but  <br/>\n&gt;my  <br/>\n&gt;mana supply was good to kill 2 skels with ward, and i helped my pet  <br/>\n&gt;beat the  <br/>\n&gt;last.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Dennis Chan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dchan17@...\">dchan17@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;i have not heard anyone necro who can solo 3-4 blues AT THE SAME  <br/>\n&gt;TIME...w/<br/>\n&gt;&gt;ward undead , i can keep soloing 3 blue skelly until i have to  <br/>\n&gt;meditate but<br/>\n&gt;&gt;never the same time.

It teleports you in  <br/>\n&gt;lower<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;position so you can finish under water. But it is magic user last  <br/>\n&gt;defence<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;when something comes in his directionhe can cast this and take at  <br/>\n&gt;last a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;fast stert running from enemy but .. as you cast it you have realy  <br/>\n&gt;nice<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;probability to A. dont move at all b. teleport near your enemy and  <br/>\n&gt;util  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;understand where are you many times is too late.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Second example is INVISIBILITY hmmm duration is random thing and you  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;never<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;know how long it will stay you can find yourself in half of enemies  <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;death.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Maybe i miss something but i used a shadow step for some time now  <br/>\n&gt;and  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;after<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;i died some times becouse it not function and it teleports me 1 step  <br/>\n&gt;from  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;place where i was before and until you get oriented where are you  <br/>\n&gt;end a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;monsters are all over you.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;my suggestion is to make a shadow step with at last some minimum  <br/>\n&gt;radius  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;second to put a limitation in lets say 40 grades from a point of  <br/>\n&gt;view.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;do you have other problems with too much inprevedible random efects  <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;game?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Wizard looser?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;From all classes a wizards have worst mana use as i see it no buffs  <br/>\n&gt;but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;strong damage but also too much mana used for this DD. Look at pets  <br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;can stay as long as you wish around and all time do damage and serve  <br/>\n&gt;as a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;shield. i heared of many magician and enchanters not to talk about<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;necromancers wich can alone take 3 or 4 blue monsters some of them  <br/>\n&gt;can  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;take<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;also on a yellow alone. as a wizard i never know of any who can take  <br/>\n&gt;3<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;blues alone after a 12 lv. In a group you must all time meditate for  <br/>\n&gt;mana<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;all other have much longer battle use before remain OOM. If a group  <br/>\n&gt;fight<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;red then a lower resistance of wizard spells can be used but after  <br/>\n&gt;hard<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;fight as persons with more mana then others wizards take a too long  <br/>\n&gt;time<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;meditating and all others will be ready to fight another battle  <br/>\n&gt;before a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;wizard.
