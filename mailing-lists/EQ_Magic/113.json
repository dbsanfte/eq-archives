Everyone in<br/>\nthe group should put something in, learn to hold back and let the tank tank<br/>\nand the healer heal.

If you are totally empty of mana<br/>\n&gt;&gt;at the end of a fight then you aren&#39;t using your tanks efficiently. Not<br/>\n&gt;&gt;playing with tanks? Well then that is the cost of doing so.  Each fo the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;three components of the triad has its use. Clerics heal mages Nuke, Tanks<br/>\n&gt;&gt;absord damage and dish out a steady stream too.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Increasing the mana regen rate would have a  direct effect on a wizards<br/>\n&gt;&gt;usefullness but would help Enchanters far less, since most of our spells<br/>\n&gt;&gt;can&#39;t stack.   <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You sat that you are enchanter and i dont know did you play a wizard enough<br/>\n&gt;but i talk about a raport combat - experience / mana use - downtime. your<br/>\n&gt;enchanter spells have a long duration and in combat you have many options<br/>\n&gt;how to play and combine but wizard have only to hit with DD and root simple<br/>\n&gt;straight and too mana consuming i understand that you cannot have more then<br/>\n&gt;6 - 7 hits of your strongest spell and one or two roots without remaining<br/>\n&gt;without mana but after that wizard must stay long long time meditating ( i<br/>\n&gt;hate to sit without a big chat window at last this will help eheheh but<br/>\n&gt;until big chat window comes im against that politic to stay and look film<br/>\n&gt;on tv until i get mana back)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;In my first post i don&#39;t explained it good so i try to explain it better. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I like to play a wizard as i play wizards in all games for more than 12<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;years now, but if we talk about balancing all magic users to same lv then i<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;see some problems with  a wizard class, i wish to see your comments on this<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;and other ideas to make a game more playable without throwing a balance out<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;or tring to make a overpowerfull class.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;First positive things<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-  wizards are great for plane(after 34+ lv), group travel (druid is best<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;in individual and nearly as good in group)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-  wizards are best in DD damage spells (but not in damage to mana ratio<br/>\n&gt;DOT)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-  wizards spells are less resisted and it damage at last for one part<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;moust other class spells are resisted full<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-  wizard is fastest to deal a massive damage in shortest time (but a<br/>\n&gt;price?)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;All good things IMHO<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Negativ things<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;- Wizards have lowest defence, hit points and ac of all classes (lowest<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;combat survivel)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Ahh but you shouldn&#39;t be nuking until the Tank has beuilt up a good long<br/>\n&gt;&gt;position at the top of the mobs hate list. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;- wizard spells do massive damage but also use masive mana but when wizard<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;uses it mana it is useless. \tFighting is not a wizard strong side, wizard<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;dont have pets, dont have buffs, dont heal, they dont run well.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;If you are soloing as a wizard youa re taking a chance that your root won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt;fail at the wrong time, if not you ahve to learn to relax and let the other<br/>\n&gt;&gt;members of the party soak up damage too. You will decrease downtime by far<br/>\n&gt;&gt;if you allow the tank to lose hitpoints which the cleric can heal, and you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;reserve msot mana for killing runners and a couple of good mid fight nukes.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Unless its an emergency I never burn over 1.5-2 bubbles of mana per fight. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;- Wizards risks very very much in combat agains only 2 blues<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;True, but then again the game is built around grouping. If everyone is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;facing 2 mobs in the group thats a train and you should do whatever you do<br/>\n&gt;&gt;when your screwed and need to escape. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;First i don&#39;t wish to say that a wizard is not good or playable class it is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;nice but it is also a class with most downtime of all clases so as a result<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;a 2 equaly expert people playing sametime will never get equal play time,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;wizard will most time be in his book. Why this hmm lets see<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;All other Magic users have better mana usage then wizard, why pet is a best<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;mana use it damages, it defend, it tount and it never expires until it dies<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;( i personaly dont like this pets i wish to have a cat or dog od mouse :-)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;not for combat but as familiar ) . Buffs as result do more damage and DOT<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;spells are much more mana efficent then our DD spells. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;So what can be done to make a wizard a time efficent to play as other<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;classes are. I suggest a faster mana recovering ratio not too much but a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;1.3 or 1.2 faster times can help and its easy to implement one number<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;change in formula and go go go.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Here i dont put in effect of specialization as for now it is not in game (<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;long beta ) and i dont know if in later levels exist any only wizard mana<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;regeneration booster but i heared of &quot;mana stone&quot; but noone knows what it<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;is and when you find it. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks all for reading and as i live in italy my english is not maxed yet,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;but i please you to join a discussion and to not take to hard my spelling<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;mistakes. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Silverlock,  ICQ 474725\t\t\t<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Household Pests?
