You will decrease downtime by far<br/>\n&gt;if you allow the tank to lose hitpoints which the cleric can heal, and you<br/>\n&gt;reserve msot mana for killing runners and a couple of good mid fight nukes.<br/>\n&gt;Unless its an emergency I never burn over 1.5-2 bubbles of mana per fight. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;- Wizards risks very very much in combat agains only 2 blues<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;True, but then again the game is built around grouping. If everyone is<br/>\n&gt;facing 2 mobs in the group thats a train and you should do whatever you do<br/>\n&gt;when your screwed and need to escape. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;First i don&#39;t wish to say that a wizard is not good or playable class it is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;nice but it is also a class with most downtime of all clases so as a result<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a 2 equaly expert people playing sametime will never get equal play time,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;wizard will most time be in his book. Why this hmm lets see<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;All other Magic users have better mana usage then wizard, why pet is a best<br/>\n&gt;&gt;mana use it damages, it defend, it tount and it never expires until it dies<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;( i personaly dont like this pets i wish to have a cat or dog od mouse :-)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not for combat but as familiar ) . Buffs as result do more damage and DOT<br/>\n&gt;&gt;spells are much more mana efficent then our DD spells. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;So what can be done to make a wizard a time efficent to play as other<br/>\n&gt;&gt;classes are. I suggest a faster mana recovering ratio not too much but a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;1.3 or 1.2 faster times can help and its easy to implement one number<br/>\n&gt;&gt;change in formula and go go go.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Here i dont put in effect of specialization as for now it is not in game (<br/>\n&gt;&gt;long beta ) and i dont know if in later levels exist any only wizard mana<br/>\n&gt;&gt;regeneration booster but i heared of &quot;mana stone&quot; but noone knows what it<br/>\n&gt;&gt;is and when you find it. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Thanks all for reading and as i live in italy my english is not maxed yet,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;but i please you to join a discussion and to not take to hard my spelling<br/>\n&gt;&gt;mistakes. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Silverlock,  ICQ 474725\t\t\t<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Household Pests?
