Does anyone out there<br/>\n&gt; have any tips on what spells are good for soloing?  Another unrelated<br/>\n&gt; question..... Does anyone here know where a good place to hunt solo would<br/>\n&gt; be?  I&#39;m having a difficult time finding decent places to go without<br/>\n&gt; getting<br/>\n&gt; killed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for an tips in advance...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mike<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kyena  16th Circle<br/>\n&gt; The Nameless<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t[ET1 TURNER]  I always went to EK and hunted Gorge Hounds.
