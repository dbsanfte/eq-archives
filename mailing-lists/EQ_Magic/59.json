I&#39;d like to take a few moments to address<br/>\nthis. Please realize that because<br/>\n     of our intense work schedule at Verant, I probably won&#39;t have a chance<br/>\nto check and respond to posts<br/>\n     made on this post - this is a purely FYI kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     PETS.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Now, I keep hearing Magicians wonder why their pets are weaker than<br/>\nNecromancer Pets. Simple<br/>\n     answer - they are not. Magician pets, on the whole, have better ability<br/>\nscores, and in some cases, more<br/>\n     HP than Necromancer pets. They also average one level higher (which<br/>\nmeans more hp, better attacks,<br/>\n     etc). The problem is that most Magicians don&#39;t experiment with the<br/>\ndifferent pet types, assuming that<br/>\n     summoning a Fire Elemental is the same as a Water Elemental.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Time for a little explanation on the four types of magician pets.<br/>\n<br/>\n     The Earth Elemental is the elemental that you want to be using for<br/>\nserious battles. It has THE most hp of<br/>\n     any pet. It also has a massive strength (about equal to an Ogre). Earth<br/>\nelementals deal THE most damage<br/>\n     of any pet. Their weakness is that their Agility bites. They will get<br/>\nhit by anything swinging at them.<br/>\n<br/>\n     The Air Elemental is the elemental that you want tanking for you. It<br/>\nhas an incredible high agility,<br/>\n     making it much harder to hit than any other elemental. It has good<br/>\nstrength (about equal to a Barbarian).<br/>\n     It deals good damage, is hard to hit, and has the invisibility ability.<br/>\nThis means you can use &quot;/pet back<br/>\n     off&quot; to good effect. The Air Elemental backs off, and assuming that<br/>\nmonster does not follow (it goes<br/>\n     after another party member), the Air Elemental will turn invisible,<br/>\nguaranteeing that it will not be hit<br/>\n     while it heals up.<br/>\n<br/>\n     The Fire Elemental is the elemental you want to use against creatures<br/>\nwith very quick attacks (Bixies) or<br/>\n     against massive amounts of smaller creatures (clearing away the hall<br/>\ntrash). Fire Elementals have good<br/>\n     strength (about equal to a Barbarian) and good agility (about equal to<br/>\nan elf). They have the least HP of<br/>\n     any elemental, but compensate with an innate Fire Shield that damages<br/>\nan attacker every time the<br/>\n     attacker hits the elemental. This means that a creature is getting hit<br/>\nby the elemental AND taking damage<br/>\n     every time they hit the elemental.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Water Elementals are the composite elemental - they combine a little<br/>\nbit of the best of all of the other<br/>\n     elementals. Their strength is second only to an Earth Elemental (about<br/>\nequal to a Troll), their agility is<br/>\n     good (about as good as an elf) and their HP are just under that of an<br/>\nEarth Elemental. They are the<br/>\n<br/>\n     &#39;balanced&#39; elemental. Water Elementals also heal faster than any other<br/>\nelemental.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Now, the Skeleton is a very good pet as well. Its strength is lower<br/>\nthan any of the Elementals, but it has<br/>\n     a good agility (about equal to an elf). Its hp fall between that of an<br/>\nEarth and Water elemental. What it is<br/>\n     lacking is the massive strength of other elementals, and the special<br/>\nabilities gained by certain<br/>\n     elementals. It also lacks the versatility gained by having four<br/>\ndifferent elementals.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Another issue that magicians (and necromancers and enchanters) complain<br/>\nabout is that their pets always<br/>\n     con blue / green to them. Now, you will notice that at higher levels,<br/>\nmonsters get more hp / damage than<br/>\n     a player of the same level. For example, a 35th level Warrior or Wizard<br/>\ncould not solo a 35th level<br/>\n     Griffin, were a 8th level Warrior or Wizard could solo a 8th level<br/>\nGnoll. Monster levels are not the<br/>\n     same as player levels. Monster levels are better. Now, pets use monster<br/>\nlevels. That is why, at higher<br/>\n     levels, your pet cons green to you. I will be putting in some changes<br/>\nsoon to make it so they con &#39;better&#39;<br/>\n     to you - not green, but blue. There will be no actual changes made to<br/>\n<br/>\npets other than perception.<br/>\n<br/>\n     The range at which pets respond to commands from their casters has just<br/>\nbeen doubled. This should help<br/>\n     Magicians (and all other pet classes) to keep their pets in line.<br/>\n<br/>\n     One final note on pet summoning. You will NOT get the same power of pet<br/>\nwith every summoning. If a<br/>\n     pet seems particularly weak to you, you may want to reclaim energy on<br/>\nit and summon another.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     SUMMONED ITEMS<br/>\n<br/>\n     Summoning items is one of the magician&#39;s unique abilities. Some items<br/>\nare better than others - and all<br/>\n     are based on our hard worked concepts of game balance. If a Magician<br/>\ncould summon items that were<br/>\n     BETTER than the norm for her level, our game would quickly be overrun<br/>\nby a horde of phantom items.<br/>\n     This being said, we have retuned our items many times, and it is quite<br/>\npossible that that Magician items<br/>\n     missed a final tuning. I will double check this - but regardless,<br/>\nMagicians can summon MAGIC weapons<br/>\n     (weapons that hit wisps, ice-boned skeletons, etc) for relatively<br/>\nlittle mana. This is a nice ability.<br/>\n<br/>\n     There are also several hidden spells out there, waiting for players to<br/>\nfind. Once a certain number of<br/>\n     these have been found, they will be available from magician vendors.<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying where they are or<br/>\n     what they are∩┐╜ but they are nice∩┐╜<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     ARMOR<br/>\n<br/>\n     Magician&#39;s Phantom Armor series now stacks with the Shielding spells.<br/>\nThis change should be in as you<br/>\n     read this. This gives Magicians the best personal armor spells of any<br/>\nMagi class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     DIRECT DAMAGE<br/>\n<br/>\n     Of the four Magi classes (Wizard, Magician, Enchanter and Necromancer),<br/>\nWizards have the best direct<br/>\n     damage. The second best direct damage is done by the Magicians. Third<br/>\nbest is Necromancers, and last<br/>\n     are the Enchanters. Magicians also get ranged area effect direct damage<br/>\nspells, spells wielded only by<br/>\n<br/>\n     the Wizard, Druid and Magician classes. They also get damage shields,<br/>\ncombat spells that have no<br/>\n     saving throw (since you cast it on a player, a monster never gets a<br/>\nsaving throw). This means that a<br/>\n     Magician can indirectly effect a monster many level higher then her -<br/>\nsomething that not many other spell<br/>\n     casters can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     RESEARCH<br/>\n<br/>\n     All research materials for Magicians are in the game. The frequency of<br/>\nthe appearance of all research<br/>\n     components has been increased by 300%. Instructions on research can be<br/>\nfound in your guild hall, in<br/>\n     several of the tomes sold by your guild merchant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     IN CONCLUSION<br/>\n<br/>\n     Magicians have the best pets and the second best direct damage of any<br/>\nMagi class. For pure damage<br/>\n     done, Magicians can rival any wizard - between the damage of their pet<br/>\nand the damage of their spells.<br/>\n     It is always tempting to think that your class is the least powerful -<br/>\nwatching another class doing<br/>\n     something in their specialty can make them seem &#39;better&#39; then your<br/>\nclass. This is just &#39;grass is always<br/>\n     greener&#39; syndrome - we saw a lot of this in Beta. I have played each<br/>\nclass up to a respectable level, and<br/>\n     can tell you that the Magician is an extremely viable class. Magicians<br/>\nare not going to be &#39;retuned,&#39; as<br/>\n     they are extremely viable.<br/>\n<br/>\n     What you can look to see is an expansion of Magician summoning items<br/>\n/toys / etc. spells as they are<br/>\n     &#39;found&#39; in the game. I&#39;m not going to drop any big hints, but there<br/>\nare some interesting things out there that<br/>\n     have not yet been found.<br/>\n<br/>\n     I hope this helps a little bit on getting a grasp on the Magician. I<br/>\nhave a Magician in my party, and let me<br/>\n     tell you - she rocks!<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd quote:</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
