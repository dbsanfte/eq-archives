If you are totally empty of mana<br/>\nat the end of a fight then you aren&#39;t using your tanks efficiently. Not<br/>\nplaying with tanks? Well then that is the cost of doing so.  Each fo the<br/>\nthree components of the triad has its use. Clerics heal mages Nuke, Tanks<br/>\nabsord damage and dish out a steady stream too.<br/>\nIncreasing the mana regen rate would have a  direct effect on a wizards<br/>\nusefullness but would help Enchanters far less, since most of our spells<br/>\ncan&#39;t stack.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In my first post i don&#39;t explained it good so i try to explain it better. <br/>\n&gt;I like to play a wizard as i play wizards in all games for more than 12<br/>\n&gt;years now, but if we talk about balancing all magic users to same lv then i<br/>\n&gt;see some problems with  a wizard class, i wish to see your comments on this<br/>\n&gt;and other ideas to make a game more playable without throwing a balance out<br/>\n&gt;or tring to make a overpowerfull class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;First positive things<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-  wizards are great for plane(after 34+ lv), group travel (druid is best<br/>\n&gt;in individual and nearly as good in group)<br/>\n&gt;-  wizards are best in DD damage spells (but not in damage to mana ratio DOT)<br/>\n&gt;-  wizards spells are less resisted and it damage at last for one part<br/>\n&gt;moust other class spells are resisted full<br/>\n&gt;-  wizard is fastest to deal a massive damage in shortest time (but a price?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All good things IMHO<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Negativ things<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Wizards have lowest defence, hit points and ac of all classes (lowest<br/>\n&gt;combat survivel)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahh but you shouldn&#39;t be nuking until the Tank has beuilt up a good long<br/>\nposition at the top of the mobs hate list. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;- wizard spells do massive damage but also use masive mana but when wizard<br/>\n&gt;uses it mana it is useless. \tFighting is not a wizard strong side, wizard<br/>\n&gt;dont have pets, dont have buffs, dont heal, they dont run well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you are soloing as a wizard youa re taking a chance that your root won&#39;t<br/>\nfail at the wrong time, if not you ahve to learn to relax and let the other<br/>\nmembers of the party soak up damage too. You will decrease downtime by far<br/>\nif you allow the tank to lose hitpoints which the cleric can heal, and you<br/>\nreserve msot mana for killing runners and a couple of good mid fight nukes.<br/>\nUnless its an emergency I never burn over 1.5-2 bubbles of mana per fight. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;- Wizards risks very very much in combat agains only 2 blues<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True, but then again the game is built around grouping. If everyone is<br/>\nfacing 2 mobs in the group thats a train and you should do whatever you do<br/>\nwhen your screwed and need to escape. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;First i don&#39;t wish to say that a wizard is not good or playable class it is<br/>\n&gt;nice but it is also a class with most downtime of all clases so as a result<br/>\n&gt;a 2 equaly expert people playing sametime will never get equal play time,<br/>\n&gt;wizard will most time be in his book. Why this hmm lets see<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All other Magic users have better mana usage then wizard, why pet is a best<br/>\n&gt;mana use it damages, it defend, it tount and it never expires until it dies<br/>\n&gt;( i personaly dont like this pets i wish to have a cat or dog od mouse :-)<br/>\n&gt;not for combat but as familiar ) . Buffs as result do more damage and DOT<br/>\n&gt;spells are much more mana efficent then our DD spells. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So what can be done to make a wizard a time efficent to play as other<br/>\n&gt;classes are. I suggest a faster mana recovering ratio not too much but a<br/>\n&gt;1.3 or 1.2 faster times can help and its easy to implement one number<br/>\n&gt;change in formula and go go go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here i dont put in effect of specialization as for now it is not in game (<br/>\n&gt;long beta ) and i dont know if in later levels exist any only wizard mana<br/>\n&gt;regeneration booster but i heared of &quot;mana stone&quot; but noone knows what it<br/>\n&gt;is and when you find it. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks all for reading and as i live in italy my english is not maxed yet,<br/>\n&gt;but i please you to join a discussion and to not take to hard my spelling<br/>\n&gt;mistakes. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nSilverlock,  ICQ 474725\t\t\t<br/>\n<br/>\nHousehold Pests?
