I divided my letter in 3 parts first one is recapitulation of previous action<br/>\nand information gathered in meantime, second is list of problems with relative<br/>\nexamples and third is a list of proposed modifications which can help to<br/>\ncompensate or eliminate this situation.

If you dont wich to reply to list my personal email is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wizard@...\">Wizard@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSome time passed after I started a first petition for wizard class and we don∩┐╜t<br/>\nget any official reply to at last I don∩┐╜t have seen it, I have seen some<br/>\nmodification in last patch that decreased a wizard casting time better to say I<br/>\nnoted most a decreasing of recovery time for a force shock spell which I<br/>\nstarted to use.  But this last modification is only part of a all casters<br/>\nclasses rebuild and is mainly introduced to compensate faster damage dealing<br/>\nfrom a necromancers (DOUBLED damage done in unit of time, enchanters, and<br/>\nmagicians pets spells) so I talked with some of my friends which are high lv<br/>\n40+ and I started o be seriously preoccupied as one of them messaged me this ∩┐╜<br/>\nWe are useless against reds, yellow resist our spells 60% of time and GREEN in<br/>\nnajena once resisted 2 lighting bolts! So I started a bard and a paladin to get<br/>\nsome satisfaction∩┐╜ second thing was a message which I received from other<br/>\nplayer which I know ∩┐╜ none is so crazy to get a wizard in his group against a<br/>\nLady Vox we will never get kill he will be resisted all time, we can use it<br/>\nonly for evacuation and to kill low mobs fast so that warriors don∩┐╜t have to<br/>\nspend HP and mana on healing from low guys, but for this he don∩┐╜t need to be in<br/>\ngroup∩┐╜<br/>\n<br/>\nProblems with wizard class<br/>\n<br/>\n1.)     Many people hate wizards as kill stealers and think they are too<br/>\npowerful with their fast transport by teleport so they don∩┐╜t have to be buffed<br/>\nany more ! (WRONG)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst wizard is very weak class once a monster get on you at higher levels<br/>\nthere is no hope to survive for him. Kill stealing for now exists in places<br/>\nwhere many groups fight a newly respawned monsters and nearly all at middle lv<br/>\nfrom 16 to 29 as I seen and against blue monsters where one wizard hit is 35 <br/>\n40 % of total HP what monster have . Places like high hold, south ro, lake<br/>\nrathe comes to mind. But to get a whole picture you must also imagine that a<br/>\nwizard will never go steal in any high lv dungeon, only try to imagine lone<br/>\nwizard stealing a Fire giant wizard (guy can burn a lv 40 player with one spell<br/>\nand is in depth of a dungeon full of similar MOBs) so this is only temporally<br/>\nmiddle lv problem when wizard start to get his high damage spells and all are<br/>\nhunting in intermediate overcrowded areas. So this problem is same as low lv<br/>\ncasters which look a mob at which they hack half hour killed by warrior classes<br/>\nwhich pass by in 4 sec for this all say it is normal casters are weak at start<br/>\neheheeheh :-). High level transportation is not only wizard domain lets look at<br/>\none other class which have SOW AND transportation! I really wish to make one<br/>\nother statistic here in. Question is really simple FROM ALL CLASSES WICH<br/>\nONE DIE<br/>\nMOST ? reply to this is simple WIZARD ! Think about it !<br/>\n<br/>\n2.)     mana inefficient use ! <br/>\n<br/>\nNow Verant start to see mistakes they create with warrior class when will you<br/>\nadmit a mistakes in wizard class. Verant guys say a wizard is class which we<br/>\nbalance all other casters on so we will not touch it, hell you buffed and<br/>\nrebalance all other class and until now you don∩┐╜t have seen a weakness of<br/>\nwizard class I∩┐╜m angry at this one mistake!<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at wizard from opposite direction wizards are ONLY magic only class !!<br/>\nThey are like a warrior or monk class which is only pure simple weapon user,<br/>\nwizards class are simple spell only damage dealer and they are penalized in<br/>\nsame time with all magic restrictions much much more than any other caster<br/>\nclass. Fizzles or resists are much more dangerous and time wasting for a wizard<br/>\nthey are death for him! Why ? .. because as wizard without mana cannot fight,<br/>\ncannot run and can only die. A little example of  this is what I say in one of<br/>\nmy previous letters it that we use more mana to deal same kill than any other<br/>\ncaster class !! <br/>\nFirst hand example .. after I got lv 21 I decided to go to lake rathe to try<br/>\npowerleveling killing aviak guards I go to a little 2 aviak isle and there was<br/>\nalready one very nice enchanter which solo this hut but admitted my company to<br/>\nshare a spawn spot we passed very nice time there and I noted that he can alone<br/>\nsolo any bird using only 2 bubbles of his mana he can lull one and pull only<br/>\none bird on him also ! His pet killed it easy and all time when I have to go to<br/>\nsell he soloed 2 birds easy. On the other side I used from min 3 bubbles of<br/>\nmana and to OOM where he at last two times saved my life. Ok I say he is higher<br/>\nlv so he spend less mana. Then comes a lv 17 enchanter on isle and we get him<br/>\nin turn he spend all mana but he can solo same bird what I nearly die from.<br/>\nWhat was my main problem?  Resistance ! I spend 200 mana in every fight at<br/>\nresisted spells !! and it is normally at last one force shock and some roots<br/>\nand flame shock! It is one bubble and half of my mana !! and I have +23 INT and<br/>\n+70 mana in items ! cc 770 total. 22 lv. <br/>\nLets think at this on this way at lv 50 one necromancer and one wizard decide<br/>\nto kill all in dungeon of najena how will they do this in shortest time<br/>\npossible?<br/>\n<br/>\n-       Necromancer summon a skeleton and leave it kill all what moves,<br/>\nloot all<br/>\nitems and sell for great profit don∩┐╜t wasting any time for meditation also.<br/>\n(this is same for all pet owners)<br/>\n<br/>\n-       Wizard on other time sit and memorized his lower lv spells WICH ARE NOT<br/>\nSO MANA EFFICENT AS HIGER LV SPELLS so he have to spend much more mana to deal<br/>\nsame damage but for most guys here in this will be waste of mana to use a high<br/>\nlv ones. He kill some ogre guards, elementals and tentacles to start with and<br/>\nis OOM so he find one place and start to meditate to get some mana back, argh<br/>\none guard passing buy start hacking at him so he needs to root it until get<br/>\nsome mana to kill it∩┐╜∩┐╜.. and so on long story. I hope you get what I wish to<br/>\nsay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3.)     Resistance of high lv mobs BUT also low lv ones<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard is a group class which is used to stop and destroy fleeing monsters in<br/>\nnormal battles with root and by giving a last deadly touch and to intercept and<br/>\ndestroy a dangerous MOBs which try to join a fray. At last it is what I<br/>\nunderstand maybe I∩┐╜m wrong. There are some thing what I never understand or<br/>\nused AE and PAE spells which Verant guys put in and which are absolutely<br/>\nuseless and can be only used as a fast suicide, glimpse spells are also very<br/>\nuseless as I seen for now they probably remain from times where you can used<br/>\nthem for aiming bolts which were limitless range? There is also one presumption<br/>\nthat a MOB is less resistant when he is wounded but I∩┐╜m not sure on this and<br/>\nthis will be a nice add on? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a wizard is a group class then why they put in a high MOB resistance? I<br/>\nthink it is because they donut wish a group of wizards dealing high damage make<br/>\na short work of much higher lv MOB. But here are Two mistakes in this what<br/>\nresult of this is. Wizards are useless in group fighting high lv mobs! And I<br/>\nthink that we will need to wait quite a bit of time to find someone to fight a<br/>\nlady Vox, beautiful dragon and that she will be considered blue to him! So<br/>\nwizards are deprived from a pleasure of reaching many hard victories. I was in<br/>\na group which hunt najena for example and my friends were from a lv 20 26 and I<br/>\nwas lv 20. First time I used all my mana on fear and with resisted fizzles I<br/>\ndon∩┐╜t have any damage !!  0  !! null , bard which was a same lv helped in<br/>\ncombat actually hitting her, healed with his song and so on I was totally<br/>\nuseless. Druid 23 cast a damage shield, combat and healed. Only useless one was<br/>\nme wizard not great feeling I can assure you. Ok next example I fight a blue<br/>\naviak guard great !! I∩┐╜m at last 3 lv higher and in one combat he resist at<br/>\nlast 2 of my spells and sometimes 4 !! I use 10 to 12 spells in all combat so<br/>\nthis is from 20 % to 40 % of my mana wasted !! with high risk that I will die<br/>\nif 2 roots are resisted or not hold long enough!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCONCLUSION what to change to make wizard at last worth a time invested to<br/>\ndevelop it to high levels and to make this way at last more funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nA.) Game mechanic !<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic resistance   If for balance reasons you cant make all wizard spells less<br/>\nresisted which is very dubious for me but as I don∩┐╜t know game mechanic I can<br/>\naccept this. Then you can make a spell recovery time doubled but mana is not<br/>\nwasted, AND monster don∩┐╜t get a full hit on his hate list if you don∩┐╜t damage<br/>\nit make it 1/6 spell max damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is much place to redo a magic resistance in base of group lv in<br/>\ndifference of MOB lv. <br/>\n<br/>\nKill stealing  I suggest that a wizard damage is reverse proportional to full<br/>\nhealth of MOB so a wizard do less damage at start of battle as MOB have full<br/>\nhealth and do more and more damage as MOB have less and after passed 50% he can<br/>\ngain a full hit. But to compensate this a wizard spend only mana for damage<br/>\ninflicted. So only fix thing for a spell is a damage to mana ratio. All other<br/>\nis calculated. Hmm I know this is a difficult one to get programmed but I liked<br/>\nidea.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaster mana regeneration, - I suggest that wizard get max meditation skill<br/>\n7*(leve+1) for recovering mana faster. That is because a wizard is ONLY I<br/>\nrepeat only magic fully dependent class. All other classes can have pets which<br/>\nare permanent 0 mana damage spell, can cast many buffs transfer hit points to<br/>\nmana, summon things∩┐╜∩┐╜.. <br/>\n<br/>\nB.) Modification to spells !<br/>\n<br/>\nShadow step  there are many solutions one is what I see in previous post on<br/>\neq_wizards to make it not any more random direction but in direction where you<br/>\nare looking to with higher minimum range.<br/>\nOther is my idea to give it a 30 40% chance to be permanently removed from MOB<br/>\nheat list and the last lets MOB have to wait a 2 or 5 seconds until they start<br/>\nto chase you again. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo solution can be to make it a personal teleport with radius stun spell! <br/>\n<br/>\nAE and PEA spells  my opinion to make this spells useful is to add to them a<br/>\ninvulnerability component like a clerics have but with no move component. So<br/>\nyou cast a spell it hit 5 guys and 3 leave what they were fighting before and<br/>\nstart hacking at wizard ! but wizard is temporary invulnerable so his group<br/>\nmembers have some time to get a MOBs from him. I also added a auto-root so that<br/>\nit cant be used to run from battle to balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvisibility  lets it start to blink before it wears off now it is too risky to<br/>\nbe used.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDisintegrate series of spells DD and AE  High level kill only low mana spells<br/>\nwhich kills green MOB fast and without wasting too much mana it is used for<br/>\ncleaning. To compensate its  power it also DESTROY all items and money a MOB<br/>\nhave so no loot !! and no experience. Kill only so you cent help someone making<br/>\nexperience. It is to compensate somehow wizard inability to deal with a green<br/>\nmobs without loosing exaggerating much mana.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nGaze spell series  What for is this ? You think that I will stay on zone wall<br/>\nand look around or this have some better use?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant at last for my look on it balanced classes and races with time and<br/>\neffort needed to reach certain level so a human wizard is penalized with low<br/>\nmana and lack of infravision but is advantaged with high experience gain<br/>\nagainst dark elf who start with high night vision and high INT but is KOS in<br/>\nmany places. But they forgot to think about frustration of how many times a<br/>\nwizard die, without hope to gain satisfaction of giving a killing blow to any<br/>\nmonster higher than a lv or two from him all time judged too powerful and so<br/>\nexpected must to meditate all time looking on his beautiful Spell book hoping<br/>\nthat something will not jump on him so that he will have to waste his mana and<br/>\nagain meditate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPost scriptum  --- Thanks you for reading it all I put much time into this<br/>\nletter and I∩┐╜m not paid for it to be more precise I∩┐╜m paying to write it  (hmm<br/>\nany place in online game industry for me?). I like this game very much and I<br/>\nappreciate a job which a Verant guys do very much they created one of greatest<br/>\ngames ever! Of course there is many things which take too much time to get<br/>\nresolved, and worst of all feedback is lost in mass boards and lists there is<br/>\nno central FAQ or PLAN . They created a beautiful and very complicated game and<br/>\nthey I∩┐╜m sure have lost many nights working on it and thinking about problems,<br/>\nall my moaning and lamentation is to give them one I hope creative look from<br/>\nother side of table from us players which wish to spend our immense quantity of<br/>\ntime with greater satisfaction, and that they can create our world more funny.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion Dragonrider<br/>\n<br/>\nFenin Ro - land of endless souls</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
