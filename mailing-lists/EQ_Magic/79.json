Lets say<br/>\n&gt; for example spell SHADOW STEP and FADE hmm it teleports you in random<br/>\n&gt; direction and random way from a casting place. It teleports you in lower<br/>\n&gt; position so you can finish under water. But it is magic user last defence<br/>\n&gt; when something comes in his directionhe can cast this and take at last a<br/>\n&gt; fast stert running from enemy but .. as you cast it you have realy nice<br/>\n&gt; probability to A. dont move at all b. teleport near your enemy and util you<br/>\n&gt; understand where are you many times is too late.<br/>\n&gt; Second example is INVISIBILITY hmmm duration is random thing and you never<br/>\n&gt; know how long it will stay you can find yourself in half of enemies and<br/>\n&gt; death.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe i miss something but i used a shadow step for some time now and after<br/>\n&gt; i died some times becouse it not function and it teleports me 1 step from a<br/>\n&gt; place where i was before and until you get oriented where are you end a<br/>\n&gt; monsters are all over you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; my suggestion is to make a shadow step with at last some minimum radius and<br/>\n&gt; second to put a limitation in lets say 40 grades from a point of view.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; do you have other problems with too much inprevedible random efects in game?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wizard looser?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From all classes a wizards have worst mana use as i see it no buffs but<br/>\n&gt; strong damage but also too much mana used for this DD. Look at pets they<br/>\n&gt; can stay as long as you wish around and all time do damage and serve as a<br/>\n&gt; shield. i heared of many magician and enchanters not to talk about<br/>\n&gt; necromancers wich can alone take 3 or 4 blue monsters some of them can take<br/>\n&gt; also on a yellow alone. as a wizard i never know of any who can take 3<br/>\n&gt; blues alone after a 12 lv. In a group you must all time meditate for mana<br/>\n&gt; all other have much longer battle use before remain OOM. If a group fight<br/>\n&gt; red then a lower resistance of wizard spells can be used but after hard<br/>\n&gt; fight as persons with more mana then others wizards take a too long time<br/>\n&gt; meditating and all others will be ready to fight another battle before a<br/>\n&gt; wizard. I hope that a specialiation will help and i heared of items wich<br/>\n&gt; help mana regeneration wich are wizard specific.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please help me to explain why a wizards are not a worst mage class?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Silverion<br/>\n&gt; High elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; moderator<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
