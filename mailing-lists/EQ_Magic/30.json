Im a magician and I just turned 16th and <br/>\nthis is what i know so far.. but have some holes in what i know and <br/>\nneed some answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have trained research skill (only can put one point into it)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have bought magils Consortume vol 1. has pet spells and heat <br/>\nstone in it. (most guilds have it ~3pp)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is written in old erudin. I have train this about 15 or 20 times. But I <br/>\nsaw about the same result when I trained it for about 4. Im &quot;very <br/>\nbad&quot; at it now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI open, close, open, close, open the book and can read a couple of <br/>\nwords at a time. I think the better at the language you are the more <br/>\nrandom words you can see at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that you can combine spells in is called an Elemental <br/>\nGrimoire (11pp - neriak has it for example)<br/>\n<br/>\nall the spells in this book take Word of Tyrany. <br/>\n<br/>\nexample<br/>\n<br/>\nEarth elemental <br/>\nElemental: earth elemental (i believe this is the next  lower spell for <br/>\nthis )<br/>\nWord: words of tyrany<br/>\nother iterm : block of ore<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for a 16 level pet you would add a 12 lvl pet scroll, words of <br/>\ntyrany and a block of ore into the Elemental Grimoire. click <br/>\ncombine. And *Poof* if you dont fail you get a new 16th lvl pet. Note <br/>\nI have not done this. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk here are the questions: Please only speak from what you Know <br/>\nnot what you have heard, or think, or speculate. I have plenty of that <br/>\nmyself. <br/>\n<br/>\n1) level 16 and 20 lvl pet are at merchants in certain cities.. (not <br/>\ngoing to tell ya in this email) So why would you make a pet from <br/>\nresearch. Are they the same?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Does this work for any level pet, ie 16 , 20, 24,? could you <br/>\npractice with, lets say a 12 lvl pet. ie 8th lvl pet +wot+ore = 12th lvl <br/>\npet?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) What monster have word of tyarany. I know random but which <br/>\none in your experience.. which zones.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) I believe that Words of tyrany are only are  magician  Is this <br/>\ntrue? I surmise this  from a post that GZ posted that there &quot;were 13 <br/>\nof the 14 classes that would NOT be able to use your spell <br/>\ncomponent so trading should be easy&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Is word of tyrany the component for all research spells. Like the <br/>\nones in vol II of the Magil&#39;s consortdium? <br/>\n<br/>\n6) ok on pet if what i have down so far is correct ie ( pet spell -<br/>\n1rank+WOT+Regent) then for the  36th lvl pet spell you need to <br/>\ncreate a spell for a 32th lvl  pet.. This would take a 28th lvl pet which <br/>\nwould take a 24 lvl pet.. and so on.. is this what you correct? what if <br/>\nyou fail on any of these.. you get to start over?  Ouch the 49th lvl pet <br/>\nis going to be tough.. <br/>\n<br/>\n7) What component wizard need for there spells?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIm on vershaan , name is akdov.  If you are not a magician and <br/>\nhave word of tyrany i&#39;ll buy them for a fair price and tell you when i <br/>\nget yours..please email mail me (no reply all pls) or tell to me in <br/>\ngame.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBill Butler<br/>\nOwner<br/>\nInternet Butler Company</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
