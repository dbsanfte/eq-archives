I have been in a few really good<br/>\ngroups that I have enjoyed being in. But I find it hard to find a group I<br/>\nactually want to join. I think it is safer to solo than to play in a group<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t work well together.<br/>\n<br/>\nEver been in a group that wanted to go into an area that was too high<br/>\nlevel? How about a group that where there is no real leader and people<br/>\nattack things wily-nily, thinking that someone is covering their backs,<br/>\nonly to find out that there are now 6 yellow monsters for a 4 person<br/>\ngroup?<br/>\n<br/>\nGood groups are hard to find. I don&#39;t mind if I level slower because I<br/>\nhave to sit and rest more than I would in a group or because I can only<br/>\ntake blues instead of yellows or reds. But I did very much mind losing 1/2<br/>\nbubble or more everytime I died. <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that the game is suppossed to be challenging and is meant to<br/>\nbe geared for people to work together. But sometimes, I would prefer to<br/>\nwork alone and I don&#39;t think I should be penalized for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnya <br/>\nHigh Elf Magician<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
