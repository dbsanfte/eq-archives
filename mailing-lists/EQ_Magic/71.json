RPG&#39;s are games which form some basis in reality and in <br/>\nwhich you can play out a roll that may not exist in reality.  Certain <br/>\nconditions from the real world such as gravity, economy, etc. are <br/>\ngenerally present from the real world in some form or another though <br/>\nnot always.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe current state of the game is all money must be derived from the <br/>\nrepetitious see Gnoll, kill Gnoll, loot Gnoll.  There should certainly <br/>\nbe some opportunity to earn equal or less profit by plying a trade <br/>\nskill if you so desire.  I am obviously not suggesting the UO macro <br/>\nskull caps with your tailor and buy a castle routine.  It should be <br/>\nsimple to determine average money gained by characters adventuring and <br/>\nuse that information to set prices that NPC&#39;s will by trade goods at or <br/>\nslightly below this level.  Thus creating the opportunity for those who <br/>\nwish to adventure to do so and make a living, those wishing to ply <br/>\ntrade skills to do so and make a living, and those wishing to do both <br/>\nto be able as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all the people who say if you are not having fun don&#39;t play.  There <br/>\nhas to be two sides to have a discussion.  If you cannot debate your <br/>\npoint with some meaning and elegance, don&#39;t subscribe to discussion <br/>\nlists.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: duffjc <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 10:36 AM<br/>\nTo: .EQ.Magic<br/>\nCc: duffjc<br/>\nSubject: [_EQ_Magic] EverQuest -- It is an RPG!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:duffjc@...\">duffjc@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to get anyone mad at me but,  <br/>\nthis is an RPG.  ROLE PLAYING GAME!!!!  The reason skills where put in <br/>\nthe game was to enhance the RPG experience.  It isn&#39;t all supposed to <br/>\nbe, who can make the most money the fastest with the highest lvl.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSkills are not utterly pointless.  They allow you to emerge yourself <br/>\ninto your character without the constant:   You hit a gnoll for 14 <br/>\ndamage.<br/>\nfor 10 hours a session.  I know some skills cost more than you get out <br/>\nof them, but think of it as a gaming dynamics.  It is supposed to be <br/>\nFUN guys.  If your not having fun, don&#39;t play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I affended anyone, but I needed to vent an this situation.

With <br/>\nthe exception of armor though there is minimal demand for items created <br/>\nby the other skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you finish pondering a trade and finally decide upon one you will <br/>\nfind how utterly pointless it is until you have invested about 200pp in <br/>\nit (with the case of smithing or jewelry) or completely pointless <br/>\n(brewing, pottery, etc.).  <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nJoin a new list today.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
