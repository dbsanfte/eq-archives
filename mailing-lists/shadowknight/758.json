Base pet aggro on the level of the owner, and not on the level of<br/>\nthe pet.  There would be fewer complaints if the green training and<br/>\nlion attacks would stop.  Then, regardless of power, the pet would<br/>\nbe useful in more situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Harm touch should never be resisted on even and under cons, and <br/>\nshould continue to be useful up to about 3-4 levels above us.  I know<br/>\nthat we can&#39;t have a dozen SK&#39;s wiping out griffons at 20th level, but<br/>\nsometimes, especially at lower levels, it just gets ludicrous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wish I could fight a rook/avocet without a lion/wolf/puma<br/>\ndistracting my pet, and rely on my harm touch when soloing a <br/>\nreasonable opponent.
