That 1 item has made me VERY happy. Then you<br/>\ncan carry around 10 weapons of your choosing with no<br/>\nworries about weight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got mine from a specter. I have heard you can also<br/>\nget them from Gnome guards, Lizardman Heretics and<br/>\nJusticars.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i feel we need though is a REALLY good Scythe<br/>\nweapon. That one from Grimrot stinks. Not that i would<br/>\nkill him for it anyway. A Scythe, i think it would<br/>\ngive us a truely menacing look.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nMinins of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; A new 1HS weapon, just wonderful. As if carrying<br/>\n&gt; around the Dark Reaver and<br/>\n&gt; Fleshripper weren&#39;t enough, now you want the SMALL<br/>\n&gt; guys to lug around a 1H<br/>\n&gt; sword AND a shield too. Yay. My Str is only 97, and<br/>\n&gt; even with an EE Bag,<br/>\n&gt; that stuff is still heavy. Not to mention a whole<br/>\n&gt; &#39;nother skill to keep up<br/>\n&gt; with, ugh.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Better options:<br/>\n&gt; 1.) Give us kick. Humans and Dark Elves will use it,<br/>\n&gt; large races won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; (because they have slam). Also fits into the image<br/>\n&gt; of SKs being mean,<br/>\n&gt; under-handed, intense damage-dealing tanks.<br/>\n&gt; 2.) Give us spells (like Banshee Aura) that are<br/>\n&gt; human/de only. Larges can<br/>\n&gt; outsource to druids/mages for their damshields.<br/>\n&gt; 3.) Make some new human/de only items (not<br/>\n&gt; necessarily weapons). The easiest<br/>\n&gt; way to do this is just make some new SK armor that<br/>\n&gt; is medium-sized, the<br/>\n&gt; larges just can&#39;t wear em, but the human/de SKs can.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dravith Vandre&#39;i<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS! <br/>\n&gt; For details and to order, go to: <br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1</a><br/>\n&gt; &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
