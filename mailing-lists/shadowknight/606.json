Unless you have friends, why would you want to hunt in Nektulous instead of Innothule swamp?  The zones near commons and Freeport are overcrowded and not as good for hunting.  Some of the best zones in the game are by Grobb.  Innothule from 5-9, Orc camps in Southern Ro from 10-12, also Dervs, mummies, scarabs, and spideys in Southern Ro from 13-15.  Lizard temples in Feeroot are great for solo action in the 10-15th level range.  Mountains of Rathe also have some great camps that can serve you well in the 10-18 range, but you will need to recruit people before you go there as people do not naturally gravitate to that zone.  Then orcs in Oasis provide awesome fodder for the 15-19 group.  The level ranges may be a bit off because my memory is not that great, but I think they are pretty close.<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg Wraithbone of Bristlebane (22nd level TSK)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
