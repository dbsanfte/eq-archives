At least at first, you can stack it with disease<br/>\ncloud and clinging darkness. Eventually neither<br/>\nclinging or disease cloud will work on anything, but<br/>\nat 22, it still worked on most things i was fighting<br/>\nat the time.<br/>\nVampiric Embrace isnt nearly as pathetic as i was<br/>\nanticipating. At first it only drains 12 points of<br/>\ndamage. But it goes up 1 point every 2 levels.So at<br/>\n24, it did 13, at 26, 14 and so on. PLus it can go off<br/>\neven when your swing misses. So instead of a big<br/>\nnothing, you do 12 damage and get 12 HP back. It is<br/>\nunpredictable though. I can go thru 2 fights and not<br/>\nhave it go off at all, or it can go off 3 or 4 times<br/>\nin one battle. But i cast it before every fight.<br/>\nAnd the last of the 22 spells that i use is Deadeye.<br/>\nThis grants Infravision, which dark Elves, Ogres and<br/>\nTrolls dont care about in itself. But, Deadeye also<br/>\nlets you see invisible players. So no more sneaky<br/>\nWizards creeping up on you. <br/>\nWard Undead i havent used seriously, but this may<br/>\nchange when i head to Unrest or a nostalgic trip into<br/>\nBefallen. Though i have a feeling it will be resisted<br/>\nalot, but im used to that now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, your question about becoming very powerful at 22,<br/>\nthe answer is no. More powerful, yes. <br/>\nBut level 30. Heat Blood. Bwhahaha. If youve ever had<br/>\nthat spell cast on you, you know how good it is. Plus<br/>\nInvisibility, at long last.<br/>\nDont expect to be invincible at 22 by any stretch of<br/>\nthe imagination, but you should start to see how good<br/>\nthings will be getting.<br/>\nPlus at 20, double attack. This has changed melee into<br/>\na whole new game for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nnow as far as 2H slashing vs. 1H slashing.<br/>\nIf you want one to be chosen over the other, my<br/>\nopinion is 2H. The reason being is that so far, all<br/>\nthe really great weapons in the game that a SK can<br/>\nactually use, are all 2H Slashing. Dark Reaver, Giant<br/>\nZwizzlestick (or whatever its called), FleshRipper to<br/>\nname a few.<br/>\nSo definitely get your 2H going.<br/>\nBut i wiil say, fighting a caster with a 2H bites.<br/>\nThey are slower than most 1H slashing, so the caster<br/>\ngets off more spells, which is bad news for you.<br/>\nUnfortunately, my STR isnt enough to carry both around<br/>\nwith me, so ive been sticking with 2H for now. But<br/>\neventualy will switch back to 1H to freshen it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps you out.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Lynn Uhlman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:uhlmar@...\">uhlmar@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lynn Uhlman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:uhlmar@...\">uhlmar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello my fellow Shadow Knights,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a Dark Elf, LVL 19, and i have a question for u<br/>\n&gt; LVL 22&#39;s and above.  My<br/>\n&gt; question is,  &quot;Do we SK&#39;s become very powerful at<br/>\n&gt; LVL 22?&quot;  The reason that<br/>\n&gt; i ask this is because i&#39;ve heard a few people say<br/>\n&gt; that if u hold on and keep<br/>\n&gt; playing and hit lvl 22 that u won&#39;t be disappointed.<br/>\n&gt;  As of right now i<br/>\n&gt; basically am a weak warrior with a few weak spells. <br/>\n&gt; Do our spells improve<br/>\n&gt; greatly?  I sure hope so, because from what i&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been told SK&#39;s are one of<br/>\n&gt; the strongest high lvl classes there is... so let me<br/>\n&gt; know something u higher<br/>\n&gt; lvl players!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One last question... Which is better using a 2H<br/>\n&gt; Slashing weapon our using a<br/>\n&gt; 1H Slashing Weapon with bash?  Hehe, and don&#39;t tell<br/>\n&gt; me it depends on the<br/>\n&gt; weapon... my question is overall.... Just wondering<br/>\n&gt; because if 2H Slashing<br/>\n&gt; is better then I&#39;ll have to start lvling it up..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks Brothers,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Arikor<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Shanti Ashtangi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zealpath@...\">zealpath@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, July 29, 1999 6:41 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [shadowknight] Even more on ebw...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
