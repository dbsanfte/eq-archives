And<br/>\nthe result we got was Peitro telling us to get lost.<br/>\nNow as far we know we did everything.<br/>\nGot all 3 parts, decoded them, gave to Peitro.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this was a while ago before all the patches that<br/>\n&quot;enhanced&quot; quests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore i waste my time camping Dyllin again (i already<br/>\nhave the other 2 parts...again..for the 3rd time)<br/>\nWhat was your result. <br/>\nAnd how did you get the list from Dyllin? He wouldnt<br/>\ntalk to us so we had to kill him despite the negative<br/>\nfaction we got with Kane and CorruptGuards. I am<br/>\nconvinced that there is a way to get it from him<br/>\nwithout killing him, but i think its linked with the<br/>\n&quot;Opal&quot; in Freeport we need to contact. And i cant get<br/>\nher to talk either. <br/>\nNOTE: i dont believe its the Opal in the Necro guild.<br/>\nIm pretty sure its the Opal in the Arcane building.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW.. i also did the Bayle List quest for Commander<br/>\nKane in Qeynos. He does not require it to be decoded.<br/>\nI gave him all 3 parts, got congratulated, now he can<br/>\nkill these folks and may Disease run thru my veins or<br/>\nsomething. He gave me 20Sp and sent me on my way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone tried this recently to see if the end<br/>\nresults have been &quot;enhanced&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Jeremy Pollack &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpollack@...\">jpollack@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thought I&#39;d share that I *finally* finished the<br/>\n&gt; Bayle List quest tonight.<br/>\n&gt; Well ...
