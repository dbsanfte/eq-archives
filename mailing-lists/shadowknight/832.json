Just go to the bridge on the oggok side and head right until you <br/>\nreach a small ogre camp.  An ogre female sells all sorts of fletching stuff <br/>\nand I believe a kit as well.  However this is what I think as I have never <br/>\nreally checked, try it out and tell me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jeremy Pollack&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpollack@...\">jpollack@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [shadowknight] Lookin fer fletchie kit in Grobb<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1999 13:52:39 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Jeremy Pollack&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpollack@...\">jpollack@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The closest place to get fletchie kits, my green friend, is to travel to <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;Centaur Camp in  the southern plains of Karana. It is a large place but if<br/>\n&gt;you travel north and east until you near the river you will find it. Beware<br/>\n&gt;of the aviaks that inhabit this realm however as they do not like trolls <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;some odd reason. I&#39;m not sure if it has anything to do with the fact that<br/>\n&gt;when you are older you will eat them or not? Anyways, if get to the river,<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;ve gone too far (loc of camp is 200, -2300 because I know how much of a<br/>\n&gt;pain in the arse it can be to find). The fletchie kits should be around 1<br/>\n&gt;plat or 2 (probably closer to 2 for you, my charismatic friend). The <br/>\n&gt;Centaur<br/>\n&gt;has a name and is in one of the four centaur houses there. He also sells<br/>\n&gt;equipment for bowyery for when you decide to take up that trade.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Good luck to you large one<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;May His Hate make you Strong<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Virten, Knight of Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
