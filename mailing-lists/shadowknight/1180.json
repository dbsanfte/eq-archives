But that<br/>\ndidnt last obviously.<br/>\nBut i have never seen a way to raise it either.<br/>\nThe only possibility is to try the quest for the<br/>\nVisiting Priestess who hangs out in the Ogre Captain&#39;s<br/>\nroom.<br/>\nWarning though, if she sees you attacking anything,<br/>\nshe will attack. Killing her lowers faction with the<br/>\nClerics of Innoruuk and some others in Neriak you<br/>\nprobably dodnt want to tick off.<br/>\nShe is still DUBIOUS to me even after all the Najena<br/>\nkilling. So she might not be linked. But since she<br/>\nasks if you are Najena&#39;s Champion, could be that it<br/>\nwill help.<br/>\nHowever this quest is very demanding. She needs the<br/>\nvarious types of crystal staffs scattered around<br/>\nNorrath. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the Bards go..i havent heard of anyone<br/>\nsignificantly raising MM faction with them.<br/>\nThe only successful kill was Princess Lenya. And she<br/>\nwas moved, though we have an idea where she is now,<br/>\njust havent gotten around to doing a full blown<br/>\nsearch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone wants to give it a try, go into HH and ask<br/>\nMistress Anna about Princess Lenya. She asks who sent<br/>\nyou. If you tell her &quot;someone else&quot; she sends you to a<br/>\nDE NPC in the same area where Lenya used to be..<br/>\nWe couldnt get her to talk (DUBIOUS) so we ended up<br/>\nkilling her.<br/>\nShe had a container with a COMBINE button and a note<br/>\nwritten in Dark Speech with instructions and the VERY<br/>\nbasic whereabouts and fate of Princess Lenya.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe container and note appear to be part of another<br/>\nquest somewhere but have yet to find its origins. <br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Krukhan Garabash &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krukhan@...\">krukhan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is it even possible to have good najena faction?<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;ve never seen a positive <br/>\n&gt; adjustment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; as a side note, i&#39;ve never killed a mistmoore npc<br/>\n&gt; but i have killed easily <br/>\n&gt; 100+ bards for +MayongMistmoore hits. i am still<br/>\n&gt; 100% kos, scowls at you <br/>\n&gt; ready to attack in MistMoore. the faction there is<br/>\n&gt; broken imo. also, when i <br/>\n&gt; went to turn the parts in mistmoore: first, a<br/>\n&gt; shadowy scribe cast force <br/>\n&gt; shocked me to death through a wall as i was leaving.<br/>\n&gt; second, after i <br/>\n&gt; collected my body i made my way all the way to the<br/>\n&gt; castle gates...the guards <br/>\n&gt; were positioned in such a way that my troll<br/>\n&gt; absolutely could not fit past <br/>\n&gt; them. though i did manage to get stuck in a crouch<br/>\n&gt; position between <br/>\n&gt; them...then watched as my invis died. needless to<br/>\n&gt; say, i died shortly after.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; so, if you go to mistmoree bring a rescue group and<br/>\n&gt; bind in gfay (i was <br/>\n&gt; bound in grobb) as the zone is bugged to hell and<br/>\n&gt; back.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; kg<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
