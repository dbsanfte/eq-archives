I started a shadowknight on Bertoxulous and got<br/>\nhim to 16 when I left to restart on Tallon.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nmoved Atrocity up to level 31 on Tallon, and also have<br/>\na level 16 wiz there, just for fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that we have a lot of seasoned shadowknights on<br/>\nthis list, and there were many times when I read the<br/>\nposts thinking, oh, this will be useful when I&#39;m<br/>\n30+...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the big challenge for me right now is Darkforged<br/>\nArmor.  I&#39;m getting ready to move into Cazic Thule to<br/>\nstart collecting this.  I&#39;ve already picked up 2<br/>\npieces of melatite, 1 fairy dust, and 1 Qeynos shield,<br/>\nso I really need to work on the decayed drops.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have some good tips for me on getting this<br/>\nstuff?  I&#39;ve heard that the 4 corners spot through the<br/>\nmaze is the most likely place to find the crusaders. <br/>\nWhen I look at this on the map, I get shivers.  From<br/>\nwhat I can tell it looks like if anything goes wrong<br/>\nin there and you&#39;re not a class that can gate, you&#39;ve<br/>\nhad it.  I just can&#39;t see anyone running from 4<br/>\ncorners all the way through the maze and making it to<br/>\nthe zone.  I don&#39;t have a wiz in my party, so group<br/>\nevac isn&#39;t much of an option.  I know that I can try<br/>\nfeign and invis, but this still makes me nervous.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny and all advice on acquiring decayed armor is<br/>\ngreatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. for sol b and fire giants, the best info I&#39;ve see<br/>\nis at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://monks.volitionx.com/monkzones.htm\">http://monks.volitionx.com/monkzones.htm</a> it&#39;s<br/>\namazingly good for a monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtrocity<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Matt Price &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattren@...\">mattren@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well I just found out there was a list about amonth<br/>\n&gt; ago and this thread is<br/>\n&gt; the first one i have received so I&#39;ll introduce<br/>\n&gt; myself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just got 47 with Squiggles, My Troll SK on Vallon<br/>\n&gt; Zek. I am the leader of<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Da Bashin&#39; Iggles&gt;. My guild and our allies are<br/>\n&gt; preparing for a dragon<br/>\n&gt; raid in a month at the max. Tried Fire Giants for<br/>\n&gt; the first time on<br/>\n&gt; Saturday night, did ok on the first 3, but got<br/>\n&gt; massacred after that. Anyone<br/>\n&gt; got any tips on FG&#39;s, dragons, or breaking into the<br/>\n&gt; Planes? Pulling<br/>\n&gt; locations for FG&#39;s would be most beneficial at this<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let me remind you that this is Race War PvP server<br/>\n&gt; so we are an al evil<br/>\n&gt; team guild, as are our allies. So we don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; bards or monks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Squiggles Jiggles<br/>\n&gt; lvl 47 TSK<br/>\n&gt; leader of Da Bashin&#39; Iggles<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; www.ciab.net/iggles<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
