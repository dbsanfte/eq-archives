Or any of the other spells we had<br/>\ntaken away from us way back in the day? =( I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but I<br/>\nheartily disagree that you guys need to worry about the low/mid levels when<br/>\nthe SK never even seems to peak at the *high* levels. Is some new and/or<br/>\nbetter high level spells asking too much? And what&#39;s with the pets? Gah,<br/>\nwhat a joke! Here&#39;s an idea, how about switching out all our useless pet<br/>\nspells and replacing them with the equivalent lifetap spells for those<br/>\nlevels? That would be a great deal more helpful than those pets that do<br/>\nnothing but get yer arse into trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One problem that SKs face -- and one of the reasons that they are so<br/>\n </span></blockquote>difficult to play -- is that they were tuned on the assumption<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that you would be playing an Ogre or Troll.  As such, human SKs are quite<br/>\n </span></blockquote>possibly the second most difficult class/race combination<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in the game to play (after Erudite Paladin).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The human SKs? At least they don&#39;t have the staggering exp penalty that dark<br/>\nelves do. As for being the most difficult (or second-most) class combo, why<br/>\nis it that there are 3 level 50 human SKs on Fennin Ro and only 1 level 50<br/>\ndark elf SK?<br/>\n<br/>\nMoral of the story, I picked a dark elf SK and not a troll/ogre SK because I<br/>\nwas a warrior before, and I wanted to take *full* advantage of my new<br/>\nspell-chucking abilities (as only a dark elf can, compared to<br/>\nhuman/ogre/troll). Now all I hear about as I get higher and higher is the<br/>\n*lack* of useful spells! I&#39;m 38 now, and I&#39;ll be 50 sooner rather than<br/>\nlater, and the last thing I want is to then have to start over AGAIN. Of<br/>\ncourse, as soon as I dropped the warrior, yall go and fix &#39;em... sheesh...<br/>\n<br/>\nDravith Vandre&#39;i<br/>\nDark Elf SK (38)<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Sorry if this is nothing but a rant, but tonight was just not a good<br/>\nnight. =&#92;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
