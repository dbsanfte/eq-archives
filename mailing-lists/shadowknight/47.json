(try casting just after you do a bash, it seems to gain you a second<br/>\nor so of casting time). by the by.. if ever you do decide to group up and<br/>\nget yourself a polished granite tomahawk, do NOT group with somebody you<br/>\ndont know. bad story, and one i may relate later..<br/>\n<br/>\nalso, Maxlis, NO! ghouls are most definitely NOT equivalent to the rats and<br/>\nbats of freeport :) the ghouls are there to keep out foolish non-Tier&#39;dal<br/>\nwhelps who would soil the lodge of the dead with their presence!! but they<br/>\nare fully capable of taking out a young dark elf who tries to pick a fight<br/>\nwith them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeld</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
