Voice graft is as worthless to the SK as it is to the necros.<br/>\nLifetaps are not going to be what some here envision. I think you will find<br/>\nthem worthless after level 20, expecially if they fall 2 ranks behind that<br/>\nof the necro. I would still trade voice graft for anything. Shadow step has<br/>\nsaved my arse more than once, and I would miss this spell.<br/>\nI think they are fine as they are, but if you want to add a new spell, make<br/>\nit a DOT, a damage spell. I mean, what are you going to do with a lifetap?<br/>\nAfter the battle, run around and zap spiderlings till your healed up? This<br/>\nwould be the only use. The spell is too slow to cast when your in melee.  I<br/>\nwould trade the pet and the Voice graft/other useless spells for another<br/>\nstackable DOT spell. The damage shield would be awesome too, but this musta<br/>\nmade the SK class too powerful, thats why it was removed.<br/>\nMy 2 coppers<br/>\n<br/>\nMorgul the Black<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
