Regardless of what it was in the past, we know what it is<br/>\n&gt;NOW because they actually gave us the probabilities in the patch message.<br/>\n&gt;You now KNOW that mobs have a 67% of remembering you each time you FD, and<br/>\n&gt;that reduces as you keep feigning. And then there is a 90% chance of them<br/>\n&gt;forgetting once they get back to their spot, as Verant calls &quot;going home.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;THAT is key.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now for some advice: Feign pulling is harder, but now more predictable, so<br/>\n&gt;instead of complaining about it, USE THE INFO THEY HAVE GIVEN US. Ok, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;not the SAME, but it&#39;s still USEFUL. Like I said, the key is letting the<br/>\n&gt;other mobs go home. That is when you get your 90% forget rate. You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;just go by line-of-sight anymore. Now the easiest way to make sure your<br/>\n&gt;target stays while the rest go home is some kind of snare/darkness spell.<br/>\n&gt;This is how I do it (as an SK) -- darkness the mob you want, run some SHORT<br/>\n&gt;distance (around a first corner usually), WAIT till ALL of the mobs get on<br/>\n&gt;you, THEN cast feign death. Within a few seconds, the mobs start to head<br/>\n&gt;back, BUT the one I put darkness on is slower than the rest. This means,<br/>\n&gt;once I see the other guys get home, I repull my target. And 90% of the <br/>\n&gt;time,<br/>\n&gt;only he will come. And I KNOW this because of the numbers Verant provided <br/>\n&gt;us<br/>\n&gt;with. Yes, this IS harder than the old way of just letting the others get<br/>\n&gt;out of sight, but feign pulls DO still work. I can&#39;t understand<br/>\n&gt;monks/SKs/Necros saying they&#39;ll never use the skill again, that&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt;absurd.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And another thing, use dead man pulls. A dead man pull is this: The primary<br/>\n&gt;puller goes out like normal, hits/darks a mob, runs back near the party <br/>\n&gt;(but<br/>\n&gt;not within line-of-sight or aggro range of the group) and feigns. Then a<br/>\n&gt;secondary puller will wait, and when the primary would normally stand up <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;return with their pull, the secondary hits/darks the remaining mob. The<br/>\n&gt;secondary takes that single back to the party, and the primary remains<br/>\n&gt;feigned. This can be extended as necessary (i.e. double or even triple dead<br/>\n&gt;mans). Using the dead man pull technique does reduce a lot of the FD <br/>\n&gt;stress.<br/>\n&gt;It can be used for lower guk king room, lord room, sol B fire giants, etc.<br/>\n&gt;Even in PoH, we used a double dead man.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bottom line: Feign pulling is not dead, it is merely harder, but at the <br/>\n&gt;same<br/>\n&gt;time more predictable. Stop complaining and just learn how to use the new<br/>\n&gt;method effectively (and yes, I know it ain&#39;t easy).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dravith Vandre&#39;i<br/>\n&gt;48 Dark Elf SK<br/>\n&gt;Mythic Legion<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
