A druid and a level 50 warrior were tracking<br/>\ndown and killing all of the crusaders in cazic today so that they could<br/>\ndo the quests, and then try to find a way to trade the nodrop armor<br/>\nto a low level twink.  She was not only doing this, but competing <br/>\nwith me in /auction for looting pieces.  Earlier, I gave the rogue<br/>\nin my group the ravenscale legs without even doing a random, and she<br/>\nwasn&#39;t even someone I knew.  Both Verant and the players on my<br/>\nserver have made it more of a chore to play than fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo good luck everyone finding your armor, hope you live on a more<br/>\ncivil server than Tunare.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith, signing off.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
