But no Groflah.<br/>\nI did see the barbarian once, he walked into the door<br/>\nbehind the bartenders and disappeared.<br/>\nI left my friend there then i went down to our guild<br/>\nand continually triggered the quest from 11PM (EQ<br/>\ntime) to 7AM, but Groflah still.<br/>\nAny idea about what time you spoke to Netuk, or could<br/>\nit be possible that he spawned because a Paladin<br/>\ntroggered the quest and by coincidence you did as<br/>\nwell?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if anyone has any further detail it would be<br/>\nappreciated. I will keep trying however.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was mentioned before that the Lady Shea part was<br/>\nbroken. Does her corpse disappear as Groflah&#39;s does in<br/>\nN Freeport? or does she just not drop the note?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
