End <br/>\nresult is info of a traitor named Opal.  This I believe <br/>\nis the Opal in the Arcane Science building.<br/>\n2)Groflah Steadirt&#39;s Death:  Netuk Phenzon at the <br/>\nshadowknight&#39;s guild says that Lord Innoruuk has need of <br/>\nyour services.  Your [mission] concerns a man named <br/>\nGroflah Steadirt. Groflah has come into possession of a <br/>\npiece of parchment that was taken from one of the Dismal <br/>\nRage&#39;s allies. You are instructed to find Groflah and <br/>\nkill him, while returning the note to Netuk. Doing this <br/>\nwill improve your standing with the Dismal Rage and Opal <br/>\nDarkbriar (most likely the Necro version) and lower it <br/>\nwith the Knights of Truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately I think it is actually the same Opal <br/>\nDarkbriar, but the Arcane Science one is a traitor.  <br/>\nThere is a third place Opal Darkbriar spawns which is in <br/>\nthe Slums of West Freeport on the second floor of one of <br/>\nthe buildings.  She is usually under a minor Illusion <br/>\nspell and looks like a locked chest (i think). In this <br/>\nform, Hails do nothing, and I have no clue how to get <br/>\nher to drop the illusion. Anyone else see this?<br/>\nHas been a while since I have ventured above the sewers <br/>\nin Freeport, so I am not sure how accurate this info is.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n13th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
