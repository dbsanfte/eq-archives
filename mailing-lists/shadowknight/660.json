The only long term benefit I&#39;ve seen for a SK to keep up 1H Slashing is for group situations.  Mages are doing most of the damage at higher levels anyways.  So use 1H Slashing and Shield to boost your AC and thus save some or your cleric&#39;s mana by not getting hit as much.  2H Slashing is still important for groups as you need to deal damage to keep taunts workings, so it really depends on play style.  Personally, I&#39;m 2H Slashing all the way.  I just use 1H Slashing to keep my skill up in case I need it later on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I carry both with me, and use 1H and a shield when fighting casters,<br/>\nespecially healers.

Normal casters I usually still use 2H because they die<br/>\nfaster than priest based mobs.
