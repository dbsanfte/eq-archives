They dont have much health to start with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for when shadow knights get these spells, we are looking at a Troll Sk<br/>\nwith almost 300 hitpoints (or more) at lvl 9 so the little life tap isnt<br/>\ngoing to effect him much. As he / she gets each additional spell at their<br/>\ncorisponding levels it can help out in getting you that last hit in but<br/>\nthats about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the so called &quot;power&quot; of the spells the mana requirement is going to<br/>\nkeep them in the back of the book. I thoght the pets could be useless I now<br/>\nsee the life taps are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your going to &quot;improve&quot; our class like this atleast give us one more<br/>\nthing, dont let Harm Touch be resisted. Its a power from the gods after all,<br/>\nI dont care how powerful you are unless your a god you shouldnt be able to<br/>\nresist this power.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you really want to help this less used class, make some shadow knight<br/>\nonly spells. A paladin can use clerical spells pretty well because a Paladin<br/>\nis only a Cleric with a sword, now a Shadow Knights spells are from a PURE<br/>\nCASTER class wich is kind of odd that we use their spells way after they<br/>\nstop useing them their selves. A little more work is needed with the SK<br/>\nClass to truly balance them out, your paying customers are speeking out so<br/>\nyou should listen (I see more complaints about SKs then any other class).<br/>\n<br/>\nUglugg<br/>\nTroll SK</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
