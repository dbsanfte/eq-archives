It is there to help you survive in a situation<br/>\nwhere things have gotten out of hand, but not extraordinarily so. This<br/>\nsaid, trying to use HT as a panic button is not the best way of<br/>\nutilizing it; my goal here is to explain some of the strategies I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound that maximize HT&#39;s effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the uninitiated, HT is an attack, useable by a shadow knight once<br/>\nper game day, that deals 10 * player level + 1 in damage to the target.<br/>\ni.e. a level 20 shadow knight can HT for 201 damage at maximum. Like all<br/>\nsuch attacks that deal damage, it is susceptible to being resisted by<br/>\nthe target. However, after a great deal of experimentation with HT I<br/>\nhave decided that it acts more like a melee attack than a DD spell; your<br/>\nposition in relation to the target COUNTS. Also important is timing,<br/>\nwhich i will get into first:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important part of HT is teaching yourself the proper time to<br/>\nuse it. It is a little difficult to explain, you just have to practice<br/>\non your own and sort of develop an instinct for it. For starters, DON&#39;T<br/>\nPANIC! EverQuest somehow seems to know when you are freaking out and<br/>\nhitting the HT button out of desparation, and you often end up with a<br/>\nresisted spell and an angry critter. You have to stay calm, at least<br/>\nuntil after you have used it :) If you are hunting in a new area, try<br/>\nusing HT on a typical monster while you are in a safe fight (preferably<br/>\ngrouped) just to test how much of the target&#39;s life is blasted off by<br/>\nyour hit. Now you know how weak that particular monster has to be before<br/>\na harm touch will finish it off. Now, if you get into a fight with too<br/>\nmany monsters, you can blast one of them to death as soon as you have<br/>\nmelee&#39;d it down enough, and move on to the next. Just remember to only<br/>\nuse it as an attack when the situation grows dire; if you can&#39;t kill it<br/>\nWITHOUT using harm touch, you shouldn&#39;t be fighting it! You are welcome<br/>\nto battle creatures this way, but you are only going to get yourself<br/>\nkilled eventually, and probably in a messy way :) In addition to using<br/>\nHT as an attack, it is also one of your most effective taunts. If a<br/>\ngroup member is being mauled and in dire need of help, you can use your<br/>\nHT to anger the monster and pull it off on you. Just make sure you have<br/>\nenough HP remaining to survive the monster&#39;s ire! Using HT as a direct<br/>\ntaunt works consistently until around lvl 30 or so, when monsters start<br/>\ngetting HP much faster than your HT goes up. At this point, in order to<br/>\ntaunt off of your group members, you will need to use other annoyances,<br/>\nsuch as taunt skill, darkness spells, and disease cloud to get yourself<br/>\nhigh enough on the monster&#39;s hate list for HT to put you over the top.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen using HT from the target&#39;s rear, and especially while it is fleeing<br/>\nor Fear&#39;ed, I can consistently deal full damage on targets that are as<br/>\nmany as 10 levels higher than me. This is in contrast to a wizard&#39;s<br/>\ndirect damage spells, which don&#39;t care what direction you face the enemy<br/>\nfrom, and are virtually impossible to have hit an npc of 6 levels higher<br/>\nfor full damage.  This does sound like a simple way to use HT, but in<br/>\ncombat it can be tricky to get around behind the enemy sometimes. If you<br/>\nare grouped, my suggestion is to lay off the enemy for a moment so that<br/>\nit builds up hate with another group member, allowing you to circle<br/>\nbehind it without angering it. Remember to stop taunting and casting<br/>\nspells at this time! :) If you are fighting solo, it can be trickier.<br/>\nDon&#39;t count on your pet to hold the target&#39;s attention (you AREN&#39;T<br/>\ntrying to use it as a tank, are you?); drop a darkness spell on it, cast<br/>\nFear, and pop it in the back once it starts running. If you are below<br/>\nlvl 15 and do not yet have Clinging Darkness and Fear, don&#39;t worry;<br/>\nuntil this point you SHOULD be able to solo without them anyway, if you<br/>\nare doing well :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt very high level, the effectiveness of harm touch displays diminishing<br/>\nreturns. When your typical monsters have thousands of HP, a few hundred<br/>\npoints are not going to count for too much. Don&#39;t fret; as a shadow<br/>\nknight, your spells and sword should allow you to drop plenty of damage<br/>\non your target anyways. It&#39;s just that harm touch will become less and<br/>\nless useful, except as a taunt and as a way of eliminating annoying low<br/>\nlevel casters that may accompany the higher level monsters you want to<br/>\nfight. There really isn&#39;t much to reccomend it at very high level,<br/>\nexcept that having an extra 400 to 500 points of damage dealt,<br/>\ninstantly, can occasionally save your life. HT can still be a very<br/>\npowerful tool in PvP, however ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nA brief note on using HT in PvP situations: many players, especially<br/>\ncasters, are not used to having VERY large chunks of their life suddenly<br/>\nblasted off of them all of a sudden. I have seen a wizard suddenly gate<br/>\nout of a duel after bearing the brunt of a HT, even though he knew it<br/>\nwas coming, and in my opinion was in a good position to win. In these<br/>\ncases, not only is HT a valuable damage tool in a duel, it is most<br/>\neffective for its psych-out factor. If you can panic your opponent, you<br/>\ncan probably win, regardless of your relative levels. Just be careful<br/>\nwhen fighting a paladin, who can cancel your HT with a timely<br/>\napplication of Lay on Hands. You will have to win a game of chicken,<br/>\nwait until they have already used LoH (and hope you have enough HP left)<br/>\nor find some way to keep them from using LoH altogether. I leave that<br/>\npart up to you ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, now go out there and kill something in the name of Innoruuk!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeld Demonblade<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nhope that helps some :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
