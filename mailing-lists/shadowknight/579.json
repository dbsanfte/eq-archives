Since I haven&#39;t seen much in Neriak, and humans are the<br/>\nleast popular race of one of the least popular classes, I figured there<br/>\nmight be some overlooked quests, that maybe lead up to something good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really want full quest spoilers, just suggestions of what&#39;s<br/>\nout there and who to talk to (and where).<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
