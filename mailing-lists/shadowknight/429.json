I would assume that the +5hp is not<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; regeneration just adds 5hp to someone which to me (and I would think a lot<br/>\n&gt; of higher level players) is worthless along with the mana, and I already<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; AC1 from my cutthroat rings without the 10pp cost.<br/>\n<br/>\n*nods, wish my necro had it though*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, did anyone find out about the &quot;Bind ring&quot; that is in the Necro/SK<br/>\n&gt; guild house, or is that a broken quest also?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a full suit of leather armor.  I was just wondering what is the<br/>\n&gt; proper order of increase that the armor should be?  I think I have it as:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Leather<br/>\n&gt; Banded<br/>\n&gt; Chain<br/>\n&gt; Bronze Plate<br/>\n&gt; Plate<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n*ermm, your proper order will be*<br/>\nleather<br/>\nbanded<br/>\nBronze plate<br/>\nRubicite (which i think  offers those regen properties u seek)<br/>\n&gt; I have no clue if I am missing something.  I need to get to the next<br/>\nlevel,<br/>\n&gt; and don&#39;t think I can do it without getting better armor (which would be<br/>\n&gt; banded if I am correct).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have heard rumors about killing so many residents of Befallen that you<br/>\n&gt; eventually can&#39;t get into our guild with out a KOS from the ghouls<br/>\noutside,<br/>\n&gt; with out casting inv to undead.  Is this true or false or don&#39;t know.  I<br/>\n&gt; consider the ghouls and they con warmly to me right now, not sure what<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; means other than they aren&#39;t going to attack me right now.<br/>\n&quot;*i think they are rumours, only faction i have seen is against befallen*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Should I be hunting in Befallen ... alone?  (I really don&#39;t care about the<br/>\n&gt; above, as long as the npc inside don&#39;t attack me along with their pets).<br/>\n&gt; And can I get armor their for free off the SK&#39;s in the back?  Just a note<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; hate rabies.  And I guess does anyone know of an item (Jewelry) that would<br/>\n&gt; protect me/us from disease, a 100% would be nice?<br/>\n&gt; *nope* *just keep that invis to undead on till ya find what your looking<br/>\nfor*<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; And that is about it for now.  I am sure I will have more questions<br/>\nlater...<br/>\n&gt; if the list goes dead again :)<br/>\n*hope I was sme help*<br/>\nMorgul&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Tenin - Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Deadline is June 19.
