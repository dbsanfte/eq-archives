The Troll makes an ideal shadowknight because of <br/>\nthe regeneration and the lack of healing.  Dark elves make better<br/>\ncasters,<br/>\nand lack in the physical aspects.  Oh, and one of the biggest concerns,<br/>\nthe large races bash without a shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think Erudite Paladins suffer a similar fate when compared to<br/>\na dwarf?  Maybe not because there is no bash/slam argument, but it<br/>\nstill seems they are at a disadvantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMyself, I carry both a 2H and a 1H/Shield and swap them via the<br/>\nhotkeys when I need to fight a healer (ala Cazic)<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
