But there is an NPC<br/>\nnear the crypt with something like &quot;information&quot; in<br/>\nthe name.<br/>\nCant recall what it was exactly. But given the name i<br/>\nam guessing that it may actually be questioned.<br/>\nOf course there is always the Avenging Caitiff,<br/>\nassuming of course you speak with him within the 3<br/>\nseconds that he lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note:<br/>\nOther than the Bards (too much time killing for so<br/>\nlittle faction) is there another way to gain faction<br/>\nwith MM.<br/>\nI have heard ugly rumors that Lenya no longer gives MM<br/>\nfaction. And its possible that the DE that spawns in<br/>\nPaw is bugged.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
