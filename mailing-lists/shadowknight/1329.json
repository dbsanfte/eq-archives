Need a druid to cast wolf form on you.

I have a couple<br/>\n&gt; questions  regarding the quest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.) The necro says to conceal your dark arts. this<br/>\n&gt; mean you have to have a<br/>\n&gt; non-necro&#92;sk to do this part?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Need a druid to cast wolf form on you. The guy you get<br/>\nthe faceted hycinth from along with the Dragonscale<br/>\narmor guy, who is in the same hut, are KoS to SKs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2.) can a group of 40-50s take the monstrous zombie<br/>\n&gt; that spawns? or will I<br/>\n&gt; need 2 groups?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We did it easily with 1 group. A cleric is a must<br/>\nthough. I got FEARd by him and ended up bugged. The<br/>\nFEAR had worn off, but i kept running anyway. I could<br/>\nsit down to stop running, but as soon as i stood, i<br/>\nstarted running again. I had to camp out, but they<br/>\nbeat him even without me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.) why the heck are we getting more nerftaps in the<br/>\n&gt; expansion when we<br/>\n&gt; already have lifeleech?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lifeleech has a 2 minute recast time, and takes about<br/>\n2 bubbles of mana to cast. Sometimes you just dont<br/>\nneed that much, or you would rather cast faster<br/>\nspells. Just like any good cleric has multiple Heals<br/>\nmem&#39;d and not just Complete Heal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nWherever a Light shines .. a Shadow is born.<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
