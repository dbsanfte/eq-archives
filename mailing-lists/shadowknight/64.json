What role does it truly play?<br/>\nObviously you can carry more, a big plus.  But what about combat?  I have<br/>\nnoticed that my ogre with 143 STR does the same damage as a friends high<br/>\nelf with the same weapon and much lower strength.  Is this just because<br/>\nI&#39;m am still relatively low leveled (8)?  Does the str bonus take effect<br/>\nat higher levels?  Or is there a bonus at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nOogog<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************************************************<br/>\nAlways remember to pillage BEFORE you burn.<br/>\n************************************************************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
