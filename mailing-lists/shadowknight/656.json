You need to be 20th level to get this weapon, but when you finally do, it sucks.  The only reason I would see anyone wanting this at level 20 is for putting in your range slot for the +5 Magic resistence.  My 9th level cleric can summon a weapon that has superior attack stats to this piece of ****.<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg Wraithbone of Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nTo get the note you need to say some phrase which i dont <br/>\nknow, but i believe its a SK guildmaster in Neriak that <br/>\ntells you what it is.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nThe phrase is: &quot;utalk adarev otcin&quot;<br/>\nHaven&#39;t tried it myself, but I don&#39;t know if Gix will <br/>\ntalk to me or give me note since I am a troll SK of <br/>\nThule. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOff topic...<br/>\nWhy is it that most magic weapons need you to be 20th + <br/>\nin level to get?  In must cases the creatures you are <br/>\nfighting doing more damage than you.  Is ok in groups, <br/>\nbut I solo mostly.<br/>\nExample.<br/>\nWith 1HS @ 61 skill or so, I max damage at 9 (includes <br/>\nSTR bonus from Siphon Strength).  With my 2HS @68ish and <br/>\na FS2HS I max damage at 25ish.  Using each weapon on the <br/>\nsame creature that cons blue this is what happens to me.<br/>\nWith 2HS I have more than half life and mana left. With <br/>\n1HS I have 1 bubble or so left and no mana.  This was <br/>\ndone vs Skeles in Befallen. They hit for 18-22 max a pop <br/>\nvs a 9 with a whip and my delay is still more than their <br/>\nnatural delay even with a whip.  <br/>\nGranted having 1HS maxed for the Dark Reaver is the way <br/>\nto go, but at 35th level to get that blade, I won&#39;t be <br/>\nusing 1 HS!
