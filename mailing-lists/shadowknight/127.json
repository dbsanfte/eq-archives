I would<br/>\ntry<br/>\n&gt; to email Verant with a well written letter, and cross post it to the<br/>\nmessage<br/>\n&gt; boards as well as the major web pages. If all this doesn&#39;t work, it would<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; understandable if you went to greater length to be heard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, I don&#39;t think there are any issues to be raised. I fully<br/>\ncomprehended<br/>\n&gt; when it told me my character would be Hard to play, and that is half the<br/>\n&gt; challenge of it. Sure it is a pain in the arse, but until you start to<br/>\nenjoy<br/>\n&gt; your character for what it is and what it can do, you will never enjoy EQ.<br/>\nIt<br/>\n&gt; is pointless compareing yourself to other characters and wishing you had<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; they had. To be perfectely honest, I beleive I have no equal in combat at<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; level other then another SK, and i am only lvl 14. I have had this belief<br/>\n&gt; since I was level 8 and beat the crap out of a lvl 9 monk. I still beleive<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; can do the same against every other class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Inos<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; erik lawrence antonsen wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: erik lawrence antonsen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eantonse@...\">eantonse@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, it sounds like people are interested in trying something.  We need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.      Come up with a couple common things that we want addressed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.      Have 1 day where everyone gets on and /feedbacks them either the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same statement or a statement containing identical issues.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So how many people are on this list?  How many are willing to<br/>\nparticipate?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And when do we want to do it?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oogog<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ************************************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Always remember to pillage BEFORE you burn.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ************************************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                       Free Games, Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;             Gamesville - World&#39;s Biggest Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that ONElist now offers the richest set of<br/>\n&gt; group communications tools on the Internet?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out our homepage for details on these new tools!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
