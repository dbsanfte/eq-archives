I have realized how great archery can be expecially with<br/>\n&gt; our pets but when I went to use a tiny dagger as it uses archery skill though<br/>\n&gt; in the melee spot I couldnt equip it. So am I doing something wrong or did<br/>\n&gt; Verant change it so you cant use it anymore? Id really like to use it if<br/>\n&gt; possibe as getting it up with arrows will be time consuming and expensive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gaukan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
