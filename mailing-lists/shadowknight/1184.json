A few questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  What is the best god for HSK?  Innoruuk or Bertox?  Which cities can each enter safely without having to kill anything?  I&#39;m assuming the human cities plus High Hold for both, plus Neriak for Innoruuk SK&#39;s.  Can either safely enter a city on either Faydwer or Erudin?<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Starting stats.  I was thinking +5 Str and + 15 AGI to set each to 90.  Any thoughts on what a good Str value is.  Should I bump it to 100.  How heavy is medium armor?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any input.<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg Wraithbone (22nd TSK on Bristlebane)<br/>\nScregg Wraithbone (7th TSK on Mith. Marr)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
