Karanas. When I turned in his beads, I got exp, and was then<br/>\npromptly killed by that same GM. This is when I learned that poor<br/>\nBrother Trintle was a mole for our organization inside the Temple of<br/>\nLife.<br/>\nOK<br/>\nNow, next time we were out there, we saw 2 guys beating up on Trintle.<br/>\nWe killed the 2 that were trying to kill him. I tried talking to<br/>\nTrintle afterward and he still babbled about Rodcet Nife.<br/>\nI took one of the Prayer Beads to the GM, and he said &quot;Thank You&quot;.<br/>\nThats all. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nI then killed one of the Paladins actually running, and he didnt drop<br/>\nany Beads or Amulets.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is, has anyone successfully completed this quest, and who<br/>\ndid you have to kill?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
