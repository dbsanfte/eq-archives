If you are asking whether to work on archery, however, I would<br/>\n&gt; highly reccomend it. It takes a year and a day to get up, but it is very<br/>\n&gt; worth it, especially when you are older and can afford a nice bow.

I suppose I could kite with darkness and a bow,<br/>\nbut that&#39;s pretty boring.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo just tell me a good reason to spend time and money on a new skill,<br/>\nand I buy a darkwood tonight.
