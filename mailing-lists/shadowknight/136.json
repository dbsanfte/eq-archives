Being a human was a compromise for me since that meant I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nKoS in as many areas as, say, a troll SK (which must be one lonely dude).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have some good points -- a 10th level is nothing in the game, so I may<br/>\nnot have given the SK a fair chance.  The problem is that I think part of<br/>\nthe game his horked when it comes to XP and level increases.  Since I level<br/>\nmore slowly than my other party members, I&#39;m always behind on levels.  This<br/>\nis amplified by the fact that higher level party members get more XP!  So<br/>\neventually I&#39;m stuck switching to a lower level party or just never getting<br/>\nexperience -- we started out equally, and they are at 12th level and I&#39;m at<br/>\n10th level (about a 20% difference in XP, even though we&#39;ve been partied<br/>\nthe whole time).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other factor that I alluded to is that I&#39;m basically a nuisance to our<br/>\nthree person party, barring the role-playing aspects.  I&#39;m not an effective<br/>\nspell caster, I can&#39;t heal, they constantly have to worry about me being<br/>\nKoS, and I don&#39;t have bind, gate, or invis.  I&#39;m a worse tank than the<br/>\nnecro&#39;s pet, and this isn&#39;t a skill thing -- I&#39;m maxed on 1HS and 2HS, have<br/>\ngood STR and STA, and wield a Mino Axe.  So I can dish out damage, but the<br/>\nnecro&#39;s pet misses less, is expendable, doesn&#39;t get diseased, doesn&#39;t need<br/>\nto be healed, and does as much damage as me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that leaves HT as my only real saving grace, but the wizard in the party<br/>\ncan dish out 4x what my HT does in one battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich means that I&#39;m effective at preventing the spell casters from being<br/>\nattacked, but in terms of any positive contributions to a battle (other<br/>\nthan as a human shield), I really don&#39;t have much.  I do some token melee<br/>\ndamage, and that&#39;s it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 07:01 PM 4/30/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Seamus McNeill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smcneill@...\">smcneill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;maybe you should have tried a different SK...maybe a troll for pure<br/>\n&gt;power...or a Dark Elf for the casting abilities.  I also don&#39;t doubt that<br/>\n&gt;eventually SK&#39;s will be powered up a little.  You played a human...a<br/>\n&gt;little stronger but limited magically.  Maybe if you tried a different<br/>\n&gt;race you might have found more satisfaction.  I can&#39;t express how much I<br/>\n&gt;love being a DE SK.  Not only for the evil nature I get to play...but also<br/>\n&gt;the fact that when I get spells...i will get alot...not to mention that<br/>\n&gt;your training and weapon skills have alot to do with how well your<br/>\n&gt;character does.  Just because the SK isn&#39;t the most powerfull<br/>\n&gt;class...doesn&#39;t mean its a bad class.  You played one race up to<br/>\n&gt;10....thats hardly anywhere in the world.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Korm<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Grow your list the most and receive a $5000 donation<br/>\n&gt;to the charity of your choice.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;See our homepage for details on our new ONEreach incentive programs.<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
