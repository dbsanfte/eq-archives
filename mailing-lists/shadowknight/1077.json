Well, after 16 hours of temple<br/>\nhunting, we killed 4 Crusaders. Meanwhile a friend<br/>\nspent about 4 hours in UTR and got 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd i may add that all the parts that dropped in the<br/>\ntemple were pepeats or items i didnt care to get and<br/>\ntherefore passed them off to another SK who did want<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is simply my bad luck and apparently not<br/>\nthe situation with most.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have yet to actually get a pair of anything *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway a friend got the vambracers. Pretty good stats<br/>\nfor a change.<br/>\n<br/>\n9AC<br/>\n4STR<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure what it looked like.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut i do have a SS of the Darkforge BP and it is<br/>\nindeed black.<br/>\nI will upload it to my site later on and post a link<br/>\nthen.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; decayed armor is DEFINITELY dropping more often now<br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *runs off to MM to pick up some vambraces and a<br/>\n&gt; bracer*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Beld Demonblade<br/>\n&gt; Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
