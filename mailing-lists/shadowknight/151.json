We will NEVER be as good a caster<br/>\nas a Necromancer.<br/>\nThis should not take you by surprise.<br/>\nAnd you&#39;re only level 10? You&#39;re still a baby to the class, along with<br/>\nmyself i will add.<br/>\nI have a friend who is level 20 SK and he&#39;s a major butt-kicker. We do<br/>\ncome into our power, but patience and hard work is required.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you dont want to role-play the character, you chose the wrong<br/>\nline of work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a level 12 Human SK. I have seen the Necromancers I travel with go<br/>\nfrom a level or 2 behind me, to 3 or levels ahead of me. And it is a<br/>\nlittle disheartening. But, this is the curse of the hybrid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even these now higher level Necros like a little more muscle in<br/>\nbetween them and the creature wanting to dance on their foreheads. They<br/>\ncant cast if they&#39;re getting beat on. <br/>\nThere have been many situations when even their pet has been killed and<br/>\ni&#39;m whats left to take the beating. Which i seem to enjoy in a weird<br/>\nand twisted way. <br/>\nI still save their butts as often as they save mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when they are out of mana and cant cast those spells that we are so<br/>\njealous of and a train or high ranked creature decides to appear? Whos<br/>\nleft? Us :) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, in short, 10 is too young to decide. If you dont have the<br/>\npatience to wait until you come into your power, then SK is the wrong<br/>\nclass for you. I can see my powers slowly, but surely rising. <br/>\nI have no doubt I WILL be feared.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
