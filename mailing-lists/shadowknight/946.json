I used my pet just teh other day to solo guards<br/>\n&gt; and such, not bad when you get him behind the mobs, double attacking for<br/>\n&gt; 11-18 and bashing to boot.  Of course I was giving him decent (not<br/>\n&gt; rusty) weapons and always kept him behind them.  So don&#39;t discount<br/>\n&gt; them yet.  They are great outdoors for soloing, probably doing 200<br/>\n&gt; or so damage in combat.  Not bad with Heat Blood and Engulfing going<br/>\n&gt; at the same time.  Throw in a fear and a blue is dead with less than<br/>\n&gt; a bar of damage to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I completely agree that pets are useful for outdoor soloing. Very. But to<br/>\nhave one to two spells per level that do little but allow us to solo<br/>\noutdoors ... well. Of course, I&#39;m looking forward to voice graft a great<br/>\ndeal and a loss of pets would kill that but ... well ... I think I would<br/>\ntrade my pet for a damage shield every level. No ... I *would* trade my pet<br/>\nfor a damage shield every level or every other or so. At 30 our pet does,<br/>\nyou say, 11-18 damage plus bash. I&#39;d trade that for 6 dmg damage shield that<br/>\nis useable ALWAYS not just in outdoor soloing situations. I can see why<br/>\ndamage shields could be unbalancing however ... I just wish there was an<br/>\neasy solution. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t care if troll and ogre SK&#39;s are better<br/>\nthan me because of that. I still enjoy to RP my human SK and I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\ntrade that for anything (cause I&#39;d&#39;ve been a wood elf druid if I cared!).<br/>\n<br/>\nlater,<br/>\nback to work!<br/>\njer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
