I think we should all realize that SK&#39;s are not meant to be <br/>\nhealers like paladins and rangers to some extent. We are the hybrid that <br/>\nfocuses on dmg and killing foes. I agree though that pets have to be thought <br/>\nout more about their usefulness and maybe even replaced with weak buffs or <br/>\nDoT&#39;s. Heart flutter would be a great addition as it not only dmg&#39;s opponent <br/>\nbut also weakens its stats and those are two of the main aspects of the SK. I <br/>\nalso liked the idea of a dmg shield, maybe at 30. Banshee aura would fit this <br/>\nperfectly as it is self cast and wouldnt be TOO powerful at only 8dmg a pop <br/>\nto unbalance classes. Just my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaukan Shadowmyre<br/>\nTSK on Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
