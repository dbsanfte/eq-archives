This is a downtime reducer at worst, and depending on<br/>\n&gt;how long the casting time is, this may be able to be cast between swings.<br/>\n&gt;Plus, this will be great for those times when you get your butt kicked to<br/>\n&gt;the point where you just have to back of fight your group&#39;s in.  This is<br/>\n&gt;also something that the smaller race SKs can do with their mana that us<br/>\n&gt;large will not be able to do as much.  At level 33 my mana will be closer <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;450 with my troll.  That extra about 250 mana of a DE equals 4 45 point<br/>\n&gt;lifetaps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bazkak Gakaz<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Chip Paul<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Sent: 10/22/99 4:10 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [shadowknight] Thank you Brian!
