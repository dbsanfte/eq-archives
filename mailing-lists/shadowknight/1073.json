Yesterday we were doing steel<br/>\ngolem in cazik, guy loots it, says no one else gets to loot cause his level<br/>\n41 rogue friend needs it and he doesnt have time to play. i was like wtf???<br/>\nMade me so mad I couldnt see straight. I had quit playing, came back after 3<br/>\nmonths(before character deleted), and well. so far, so good. I dont play<br/>\nlike I used too, but still get peeved at other players. There greed is just<br/>\namazing. So take a good long break, and come back when ya feel your ready.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Krukhan Garabash &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krukhan@...\">krukhan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 21, 1999 12:13 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [shadowknight] !Quests since the patch?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Krukhan Garabash&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krukhan@...\">krukhan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ouch!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; the first day the new quests surfaced some lv50 necro was camping<br/>\ncrusaders<br/>\n&gt; to outfit his twink on my server...he&#39;s gone now. but assholes make up the<br/>\n&gt; majority of our population inside and outside of eq...so it&#39;s just a fact<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; it sounds like the heinous &quot;eq-stress&quot; has invaded you and your life as it<br/>\n&gt; has so many others. definitely sounds like a break is in order...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; but...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i recommend keeping your account active for a month or 2. i quit eq<br/>\nentirely<br/>\n&gt; for over a month once, for various reasons and i was glad i didn&#39;t cancel<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; sell off my items when i eventually came back...i don&#39;t play as much as i<br/>\n&gt; used to or with the same desire but i still enjoy the game from time to<br/>\n&gt; time. so, as long as it provides 10 hours of &quot;real fun&quot; each month...it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; worth the money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i think anyone can agree with that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -kg<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Chip Paul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [shadowknight] !Quests since the patch?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 20 Oct 1999 19:34:40 -0500<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i just got word that the quests may have been changed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rumor has it that possibly only 1 item is need now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of the 2.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NOTE: i used the word rumor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone gone back to MM or Najena for quest info?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The skeleton gave teh same message today, but conned red to a 36th<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level, which is an improvement.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I, myself, am leaving EQ, beacause I can&#39;t stand the majority of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the people on my server.  A druid and a level 50 warrior were tracking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;down and killing all of the crusaders in cazic today so that they could<br/>\n&gt; &gt;do the quests, and then try to find a way to trade the nodrop armor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to a low level twink.  She was not only doing this, but competing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with me in /auction for looting pieces.  Earlier, I gave the rogue<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in my group the ravenscale legs without even doing a random, and she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wasn&#39;t even someone I knew.  Both Verant and the players on my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;server have made it more of a chore to play than fun.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So good luck everyone finding your armor, hope you live on a more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;civil server than Tunare.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Xilith, signing off.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
