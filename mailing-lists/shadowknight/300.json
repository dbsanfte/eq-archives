Whether you can become non-kos or not remains to be seen, but<br/>\nthis would depend on your level since your max faction increases as your<br/>\nlevel increases.  Some of you who have adventured around blackburrow might<br/>\nhave noticed that eventually Holly Windstalker (or maybe Cros Treewind - i<br/>\ncant remember) becomes indifferent if you have killed enough gnolls.  This<br/>\nhappened for me around level 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also saw a necro jump ship today in the butcherblock zone to avoid the<br/>\nguards and he was in the 20&#39;s.  I would assume then that it may take quite a<br/>\nwhile to raise your faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to mention how much faster my druid has leveled than my sk.<br/>\nMaybe this is becuase he is my third character and I have more experience<br/>\nplaying the game, but I started a week ago and I am level 9 already.  Seems<br/>\nlike it took twice as long to make it that far as a human sk.  Playing a<br/>\nshadowknight is fun but there really is a serious penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 10, 1999 2:05 PM<br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] question about butcherblock<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; can anyone verify wether or not the dwarven guards throughout the<br/>\n&gt; butcherblock mountains are aligned with the stormguard? if so, there IS a<br/>\n&gt; valid way for us evil folk to survive that area without invis. if you kill<br/>\n&gt; runnyeye goblins and several of the monsters that frequent the gorge of<br/>\nking<br/>\n&gt; xorbb, your faction with the stormguard will increase (as well as the<br/>\n&gt; guardians of the vale, who guard misty thicket and rivervale). if this<br/>\n&gt; works, even an evil person will be able to travel most places in<br/>\n&gt; butcherblock provided they go genocidal on gobbies before they make the<br/>\n&gt; trip. however, i still dont reccomend trying to get into kaladim, since<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; goblins dont raise faction with any of the other groups of dwarves. so...<br/>\n&gt; does anybody know for sure if this will work?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Beld Demonblade<br/>\n&gt; Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; More than 1,000!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
