Got it for a steal (I <br/>\nthink) at 85PP.  The weapon is not in that great a <br/>\nsupply/demand though because it is evil race &quot;fighter&quot; <br/>\nonly.<br/>\nThe weapon is great! Is the only one I use now. Of <br/>\ncourse, if you are human I don&#39;t think you can use it. :(<br/>\nAs for 1HS, try to get ahold of a PGT.  HHP is the best <br/>\nplace to look for one that I know of. <br/>\nAnother good one is the Barbbed Whip. Najena is the <br/>\ndungeon for that. Bonecracker drops it I believe. Just <br/>\nauction in Lavastorm and the Najena zone border for one. <br/>\nYou may just get lucky.<br/>\nPerma has the best 1HS weapons in the game IMHO. If you <br/>\ncan get to Perma alive I would suggest that. But that <br/>\ncan be hell if you die. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik Khaos &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: atrocity apocalypse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atrocity_apocalypse@...\">atrocity_apocalypse@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t say what level your at, so this may not be<br/>\n&gt; the best advice, but...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Save your money and go on the Grobb Cleaver quest.
