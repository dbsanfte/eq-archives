One of the NPCs that makes the<br/>\nSK only armor is in Najena, right?  While this may not be a big deal now,<br/>\nand I may already have messed this faction to Thule and back anyway, it<br/>\nmakes me edgy. I have only been in there a few times, and killed 1 Ogre that<br/>\nwandered near the Magician and her 2 Earth Elemental pets.  I noticed a<br/>\nNajena Residents -Faction adjusment. After that, My group attacked the<br/>\nMagician, and I became a stain on the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious to know for those of you who battle there often, what faction<br/>\nadjustments you may have seen since they implemented Darkforge Armor. It<br/>\nwill suck to destroy my faction with the only NPC that makes those pieces of<br/>\nthe armor that only I can wear.  Granted, what you destroyed, you can fix<br/>\n(hopefully), but that in and of itself can take a lifetime. Or is there no<br/>\nfaction adjustment with this NPC?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, what is the name of this NPC in Najena, and where does he spawn?<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask these questions as my guild is planning to raid Najena and get some<br/>\nnifty stuff. Am I about to become screwed when all is said and done?<br/>\nAny and all information on this is helpful and wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAkenar &quot;Cronik&quot; Khaos &lt;Dark Omen&gt;<br/>\n15th Season TSK (and 1 more kill from 16th!
