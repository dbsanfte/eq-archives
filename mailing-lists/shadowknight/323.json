You can always get a friend to buy them for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t not recommend using archeryy full on until level 9 or more. Then grab<br/>\none of those needle thingy&#39;s which are like daggers but use the archery skill.<br/>\nthey are the best way to raise your skill since they use no arrows, so are much<br/>\ncheaper. Don&#39;t do much damage but good for practicing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, arcehry is good with either SoW or clinging darkness for kiting. I kited a<br/>\nBull Elepahnt that conned yellow to half health without taking a hit before<br/>\nclosing in and fighting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Arcehry kiting and pets, Yellows are easily soloed by SK, even up to lvl 20<br/>\n<br/>\nInos<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJeremy Pollack wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Jeremy Pollack&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpollack@...\">jpollack@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my experiences with archery.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a Rough Elm Recurve Bow which has a base 13 damage. With the 1 dmg<br/>\n&gt; arrows, I can do 14 damage to beasties. I also have an 80 skill in Archery,<br/>\n&gt; having practiced and practices (and practiced and practiced) till my thumbs<br/>\n&gt; bleed. Now that I have a good skill and a good bow, I find it quite<br/>\n&gt; worthwhile. But I would not reccomend it for anyone that is shy on spending<br/>\n&gt; a LOT of time working on getting it up (I probably fired 3,000+ arrows in my<br/>\n&gt; training). My bow does almost as much damage as a mino axe, although it is<br/>\n&gt; slower (48 I think maybe 51, compared to 38 for mino axe).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for fletching ... there is nowhere on Antonica to get fletching supplies<br/>\n&gt; except surefall glade. The only other plalce I know to get bowyering<br/>\n&gt; supplies is in Oggok which is not an option for humans (DE, Trolls and Ogres<br/>\n&gt; only). Even ones that worship Innoruuk. :(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
