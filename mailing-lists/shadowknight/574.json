I didn&#39;t until 15th.<br/>\nSince 75 is the max, it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will be able to hit stuff with it just fine. I have no problem at all at<br/>\n23rd level.<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, kiting is boring, and you&#39;d need to carry a few BOXES of arrows with<br/>\nyou. I don&#39;t kite.<br/>\n<br/>\nPulling--I always use my bow when pulling, especially outdoors. Yes, I use<br/>\ndarkness, but as I run in, instead of just running straight to my group, I<br/>\njust turn around once in a while and fire off an arrow, run, fire, run ...<br/>\netc. By the time I get it in, I&#39;ve usually knocked off 50-150hp. It hardly<br/>\ntakes any more time, and that is that many more HP we don&#39;t have to deal<br/>\nwith.<br/>\n<br/>\nRunners -- when OOM or with afast runner, it is nice to put an arrow in<br/>\ntheir back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, archery is not a *critical* skill, but it is one that is very<br/>\nnice to have. I only use an elm bow still (14dmg max) and I still do quite<br/>\nwell with it. It will take you some time to master it (depending on how good<br/>\nyour int is (de/human or troll/ogre?)) and just how much you practice it. I<br/>\nplay with a group of friends, so I was able to practice it quite a bit when<br/>\nI picked it up. Took maybe a week or so to get it maxed (same as when I<br/>\npicked up piercing at 21).<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us know how it goes? Maybe we can wake this list back up (god knows I<br/>\nneed something to do at work ... and I&#39;m so busy I can&#39;t play EQ for a week<br/>\nor two!!! So everyone, start posting!! :D)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVirten</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
