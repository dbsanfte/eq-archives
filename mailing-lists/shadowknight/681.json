I have only been to<br/>\n4 guilds(i am a dark elf) neriak, freeport, grobb, and<br/>\noggok. I can only train in neriak and freeport. i do<br/>\nnot understand why i cannot train in/have access to<br/>\nthe quests in the sk guilds in grobb and oggok. It is<br/>\nvery annoying. I talked to a gm once and he said<br/>\nsomehting like &quot;shadowknights are a strange bunch. try<br/>\nkilling things in teh wild to get your faction up&quot;<br/>\nthere are no such things and i am very angry that a<br/>\nguide doesn&#39;t even know this. <br/>\n     Another thing about faction. In mistmoore you<br/>\ntake a faction hit with Queen Cristanos Thex or<br/>\nsomething. You gain faction with her when you do<br/>\nquests and stuff in neriak. I talked to a number of<br/>\nsks and necros and they said this faction isn&#39;t really<br/>\nimplemented yet. I am scared that my own guild will<br/>\nkill me if it ever does get implemented :(  The wierd<br/>\nthing is that in mistmoore everything is kos to<br/>\nme...why would killing something that is kos to you<br/>\nhurt your faction with your guild...it doesn&#39;t make<br/>\nsense. If this faction ever gets implemented that<br/>\nwould mean 2 dugeons dark elf sks and necros can&#39;t<br/>\nhunt in : Crushbone and Mistmoore. I think if we can&#39;t<br/>\nhunt in mistmoore why not make it like a high pass for<br/>\ndakr elves. I guess there would be problems with that<br/>\nwith camping items in dangerous places but i dunno.<br/>\n<br/>\njust my 2 copper<br/>\n<br/>\nTekman Hatebringer, 27th campaign<br/>\nHouse of Malice<br/>\nRodcet Nife Server<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
