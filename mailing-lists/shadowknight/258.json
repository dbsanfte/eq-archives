Because of their regen they seem to get experience faster than<br/>\nogres and have an advantage in str and stamina over De and human SK&#39;s.<br/>\nThe higher int of de and humans will help in overall ability increases,<br/>\nbut even as an ogre, I&#39;ve maxed out everything I&#39;ve wanted to every time<br/>\nI&#39;ve leveled so far simply because it takes me so long.  If I were going<br/>\nto start a SK over, I&#39;d do a troll and dump my extra points into either<br/>\nint and agiliy or int and dex.  they already got plenty of str and stamina<br/>\nand charisma is for those pretty good races as far as I&#39;m concerned.  Also<br/>\nin light of the fact that I have so many misses when fighting and that<br/>\nVampiric embrace seems to be dex dependant now, i&#39;d probably go with Int<br/>\nand Dex.  As far as places to go, I don&#39;t know about the DE or human<br/>\nplaygrounds at lower levels, but I&#39;ve like both the Feerot and Innothule<br/>\nonce I stopped getting lost.  The easiest way to do that is just stay<br/>\nclose to the roads or boundaries.  By the time you get locate corpse, you<br/>\nprobably won&#39;t need it.  By then you know where everything is and where<br/>\nyou died.  Anyway, Good luck with whatever you choose and be ready to<br/>\nlevel slowly...<br/>\n<br/>\nOogog<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************************************************<br/>\nAlways remember to pillage BEFORE you burn.<br/>\n************************************************************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
