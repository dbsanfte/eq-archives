Many<br/>\n&gt; dungeons are bugged, cant even walk into sola, get back down the stairs in<br/>\n&gt; unrest, etc. This change hurts the large races bad, and came way too late,<br/>\n&gt; atfer everyone and the brother done got it. Now large races are dependent on<br/>\n&gt; shamans to enter the dungeons. Sucks to depend on 1 class. Maybe they will<br/>\n&gt; throw out a shrink type item, course prob require getting a rare pop off a<br/>\n&gt; dragon or something. I also feel like all the real cool items are gone.<br/>\n&gt; Manastones, guise, jboots, etc. On the older servers so many people already<br/>\n&gt; have these, and the ogrew that got there late will have to stand and shout<br/>\n&gt; will pay for shrink at the dungeon entrance, while other people just click<br/>\n&gt; on there mask. I am sure you smaller race shadowknights like the change<br/>\n&gt; though.... Dont see why they waited 9 months to do it....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a DESK, but ready to sign any petition for shrink potions available<br/>\nat potion shops at a reasonable price, and/or the inclusion of a<br/>\nclickable or wearable shrinking item.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, if size is the problem, there are better ways to fix it then<br/>\nturning into a DE.
