Now she is looked on by most to be evil...yet..would <br/>\nshe not have a different view of herself?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould she believe herself, her race, and God are not the evil ones?  <br/>\nHow can that really be roll-played..and remember this is a total <br/>\nnewbie to role-playing here. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have other characters..but seem to find my little Sk the hardest to <br/>\nfigure out :(<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?
