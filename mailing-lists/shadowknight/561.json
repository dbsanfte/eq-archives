My<br/>\n&gt; question is,  &quot;Do we SK&#39;s become very powerful at LVL 22?&quot;  The reason that<br/>\n&gt; i ask this is because i&#39;ve heard a few people say that if u hold on and keep<br/>\n&gt; playing and hit lvl 22 that u won&#39;t be disappointed.  As of right now i<br/>\n&gt; basically am a weak warrior with a few weak spells.  Do our spells improve<br/>\n&gt; greatly?  I sure hope so, because from what i&#39;ve been told SK&#39;s are one of<br/>\n&gt; the strongest high lvl classes there is... so let me know something u higher<br/>\n&gt; lvl players!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One last question... Which is better using a 2H Slashing weapon our using a<br/>\n&gt; 1H Slashing Weapon with bash?  Hehe, and don&#39;t tell me it depends on the<br/>\n&gt; weapon... my question is overall.... Just wondering because if 2H Slashing<br/>\n&gt; is better then I&#39;ll have to start lvling it up..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks Brothers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Arikor </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
