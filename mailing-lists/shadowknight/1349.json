I am new here and have some questions for you.<br/>\n&gt; 1) Is it possible to not be KoS in Freeport propper as a Troll? By that I<br/>\n&gt; mean with the guards, merchants and other NPCs? I know the Arcane Science<br/>\n&gt; NPCs will always KoS you, but was not sure about the others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Can you train as a Troll SK in Neriak at either the Troll SK in Foriegn<br/>\n&gt; 1/4, or at the DE SK guild?  Cronikx&#39;s Diety is Innorukk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) Will killing slaves in Crushbone increase Dead faction in Neriak?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cronikx<br/>\n&gt; 4th Sword of Hate<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
