I have fired over 200 arrows and nothing.<br/>\n&gt; Is their any reason? or just plain bad luck.  I think my pets and party<br/>\n&gt; members are getting mad at me becuse they want me to tank for them but I<br/>\n&gt; really want to increase my archery skill.  I have a long bow with the<br/>\n&gt; standard arrows.  Plus I couldn&#39;t find the book on making arrows in .... the<br/>\n&gt; dark elf city ...
