I&#39;m<br/>\nlearning that starting a character<br/>\nwith a vision can be quite disappointing!  My efforts to find a nifty<br/>\nmagical sword (1H Slash) have actually<br/>\nbeen the thing that has met with disappointment, the character himself is<br/>\nquite interesting and fun to<br/>\nplay/ role-play. At any rate, I was wondering if I am just overlooking<br/>\nsomething....  Are there ANY 1H Slash<br/>\nSK specific weapons that don&#39;t come from the Planes?  I have been watching<br/>\nreports come out Kunark,<br/>\nand it would seem that NPCs there are only capable of dropping 2H Slash or<br/>\n2H Blunt weapons<br/>\n(perhaps only a SLIGHT exaggeration :) ).  Failing SK specific weapons,<br/>\nwhat would the recommendation be?<br/>\n...and sadly, a SS:Ykesha is going to be quite out of my grasp for a<br/>\nwhile....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAzamai Ebontide<br/>\nof Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
