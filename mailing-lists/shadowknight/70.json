I<br/>\ncan&#39;t really confirm this, just something I heard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you don&#39;t actually do more damages, there is just a higher probabtility<br/>\nthat you will do Maximum damage. Next time you are fighting with your friend, see<br/>\nhow often you hit for the maximum damage, compared to how often he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nInos<br/>\n<br/>\nerik lawrence antonsen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: erik lawrence antonsen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eantonse@...\">eantonse@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hey guys,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         I was curious about strength.  What role does it truly play?<br/>\n&gt; Obviously you can carry more, a big plus.  But what about combat?  I have<br/>\n&gt; noticed that my ogre with 143 STR does the same damage as a friends high<br/>\n&gt; elf with the same weapon and much lower strength.  Is this just because<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m am still relatively low leveled (8)?  Does the str bonus take effect<br/>\n&gt; at higher levels?  Or is there a bonus at all?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oogog<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ************************************************************************<br/>\n&gt; Always remember to pillage BEFORE you burn.<br/>\n&gt; ************************************************************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the Week!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
