Including poor Brother Trintle.<br/>\nI believe the other 2 NPCs that hangout by that same tree arent part of<br/>\nthe quest. I too have turned in their beads and received nothing.<br/>\nAs far as I know its the NPCs that you always see running on that path.<br/>\nIve only killed one of them, and no beads or amulets were dropped.<br/>\nI havent gotten around to trying it again, though. <br/>\nAnd you can bet that doing this quest will drop your faction with the<br/>\nguards, temple of life and house of thunder. This is the only reason i<br/>\nhavent kept trying it. Ive done alot of naughty things, and life was<br/>\ngetting complicated in Qeynos, so i had to lay off that quest for a<br/>\nbit.<br/>\nAs soon as i get around to trying it again though, i&#39;ll post what<br/>\nhappens.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
