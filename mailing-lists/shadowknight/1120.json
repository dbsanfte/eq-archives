I recently saw a picture of the Helm and noticed that it was not No<br/>\nDrop. So is it just this piece that doesn&#39;t have the No Drop restriction or<br/>\nhave they removed it from all pieces?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal opinion is that I would want all the pieces No Drop, that way we<br/>\ndon&#39;t have other classes harvesting the armor and also it&#39;s kind of like a<br/>\nstatus symbol (You had to do the quest to get it). Of course as of yet I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t got any of the new armor (the whole camping Cazic thing doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nme too excited)..<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy...<br/>\n<br/>\nThom</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
