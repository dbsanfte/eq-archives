I have fired over 200 arrows and nothing.<br/>\nIs their any reason? or just plain bad luck.  I think my pets and party<br/>\nmembers are getting mad at me becuse they want me to tank for them but I<br/>\nreally want to increase my archery skill.  I have a long bow with the<br/>\nstandard arrows.  Plus I couldn&#39;t find the book on making arrows in .... the<br/>\ndark elf city ... Neriak(?) anyone know where it is?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
