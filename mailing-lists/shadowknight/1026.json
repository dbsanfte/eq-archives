Up to five dark reavers at a time. Wow. What we lacked in nuking<br/>\n power we DEFINITELY made up for in staying power. We had some battles last<br/>\n upwards of 15 minutes, nonstop. We just hacked and slashed and slashed some<br/>\n more. Our poor cleric. We just recruited her out of the blue. She was<br/>\n japanese and hardly spoke english at all, but DAMN was she a good cleric.<br/>\n One of the better I have ever ever had the pleasure of being healed by.<br/>\n <br/>\n In the end, though, we got .....<br/>\n <br/>\n a decayed right glove.<br/>\n <br/>\n And that was at about 10pm when the first SK was there waiting for the rest<br/>\n of us. During our 12 hours stint we actually got nothing.<br/>\n <br/>\n And for those of you that haven&#39;t fought crusaders. My GOD are they tough.<br/>\n <br/>\n Tell me this: Why is it that NPC SK&#39;s are just AWESOME (Lord Grimrot,<br/>\n Hollish Tnoops, now Crusaders) but PC SK&#39;s suck so bad? Explain that to me.<br/>\n <br/>\n Oh well. I&#39;m glad to see this list be so active lately. And we&#39;ve all be<br/>\n sharing info and helping each other out. The one positive that has come out<br/>\n of this quest nonsense for me, at least, is that all the SK&#39;s (the like 15<br/>\n of us) on Solusek Ro are banding together to work with each other and help<br/>\n each other out. We&#39;ve always all been friends, but to see us all working<br/>\n together instead of trying to one-up each other like I see the Paladins and<br/>\n rangers etc doing, well, brings a tear to my evil eyes.<br/>\n <br/>\n Good luck everyone! Someone get at least ONE piece out there, and let us<br/>\n know, so we have a little hope!! (and if it is pink, is 3 ac, and -10 str,<br/>\n dex, agil, and -50 all saves, please keep it to yourself. Thanks. ;D)<br/>\n <br/>\n Virten,<br/>\n Knight of Innoruuk<br/>\n 30th Circle of Hate<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
