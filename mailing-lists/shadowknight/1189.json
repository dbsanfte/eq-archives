A few questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1)  What is the best god for HSK?  Innoruuk or Bertox?  Which cities can <br/>\n&gt;each enter safely without having to kill anything?  I&#39;m assuming the human <br/>\n&gt;cities plus High Hold for both, plus Neriak for Innoruuk SK&#39;s.  Can either <br/>\n&gt;safely enter a city on either Faydwer or Erudin?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2)  Starting stats.  I was thinking +5 Str and + 15 AGI to set each to 90.  <br/>\n&gt;Any thoughts on what a good Str value is.  Should I bump it to 100.  How <br/>\n&gt;heavy is medium armor?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for any input.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Scragg Wraithbone (22nd TSK on Bristlebane)<br/>\n&gt;Scregg Wraithbone (7th TSK on Mith.
