I think.<br/>\nI finally got the Grobb Cleaver!<br/>\nI have been seeing someone auction &quot;Grobb Cleaver for <br/>\nsale give tell.&quot; for the last couple of days.  I have <br/>\nbeen wishing like crazy that I could afford it, but when <br/>\nasked the person wanted 125PP for it. I had only 10PP on <br/>\nme at that time.<br/>\nFighting Dervs and desert undead has been more <br/>\nprofitable than I thought.  I saw this person yell for a <br/>\nSoW to get his corpse, so I gave him a tell and he said <br/>\nit was still for sale and he wanted 85PP for it! Hot <br/>\ndamn!  I had 40 PP in the bank, my FS2HS, a FS <br/>\nWarhammer, and a Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra to trade for it.  The <br/>\nSkull was a gift from my wife and cost her 12PP.<br/>\nNow at At least 15-20PP for the 2HS, and 10-15PP for the <br/>\nWarhammer and at cost of 12PP for the Skull, was this a <br/>\ngood deal?  I have seen auctions for FS2HS that the <br/>\nowner wanted 25PP for it. I have no idea really what <br/>\neither the FS2HS or Warhammer is worth.  <br/>\nThe sword was a gift and the hammer ws part of a trade <br/>\nwith some banded, money, rusty weapons, a box, a <br/>\nlightstone and some more junk for my bronze pants.  The <br/>\npants I got from a really kewl guy for 5PP! (Heh, they <br/>\nwere weighing him down and needed to get rid of them. I <br/>\nwas 8th level and that was all I had on me.)<br/>\nAnyway, what would you have paid for the Grobb Cleaver? <br/>\nDid I get a good deal?<br/>\nI think I did IMHO which is all that really counts, but <br/>\nI still would like to hear thoughts from all of you.<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n14th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
