I saw him once, right<br/>\nbefore several high lvl casters decided to make an example of him.. I&#39;m<br/>\nhoping I can get on late tonight and have no one else around..<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the faction side, I also stopped in High Keep looking for Leyna(sp?), not<br/>\nto be found.. And I realized that it takes a hell of a lot of bards to get<br/>\nyour faction increased. (That plus their are on a 20min respawn makes it<br/>\nannoying as hell). Now the million dollar question, do you actually need MM<br/>\nfaction to do the quest, plus I&#39;ve heard rumors that there are only 4 SK<br/>\narmor pieces (compared to 7 for the other classes) can anybody confirm this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Grant Vanderhule [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 14, 1999 12:41 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] oops..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nthe lenya quest seems to have been removed. i&#39;ll give you two guesses, and<br/>\nthey are probably both right :)<br/>\n<br/>\ni screwed up about the MM quest hehe.. it DOES work. you just have to say<br/>\nthe exact right thing to the npc: &quot;how do i get shadow knight armor&quot;. sounds<br/>\nobvious maybe, but you shoulda been there with us when we were fielding<br/>\nquestions..<br/>\n<br/>\ni still feel the frequent death of the thing and its 6+ hour respawn time<br/>\nare legitimate gripes. otherwise, once you get the shopping list for items,<br/>\nthese quests are practically handed to us compared to the other class armor<br/>\nquests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeld Demonblade<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
