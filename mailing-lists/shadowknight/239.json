First off<br/>\nmaybe I have real bad luck but I couldnt cast convoke shadow to save my<br/>\nlife! I burnt up 20 bonechips and got no pet. Ok so I move on to my next new<br/>\nfav. spell I was looking foward to Engulfing Darkness.  I casted this spell<br/>\non myself alot of times and it only lasted for a few sec. I really dont see<br/>\nme catching any mob like I could with clinging darkness it just wears off<br/>\nWAY to fast and it did about 30dmg total time it was on. I petitioned that<br/>\none and the guy told me they did do a big change to those series of darkness<br/>\nspells so he noted it to be checked out.  Now for Vampiric embrace I only<br/>\ntested this spell fighting rats and stuff but in the whole time fighting I<br/>\nnever did the random lifetap they put in.  Either I need to fight stronger<br/>\nstuff or they got the random lifetap to like 20% chance of success :- /    .<br/>\nThe only spells im happy to be using so far is Deadeye and Ward Undead(which<br/>\nim still practicing and failing alot).<br/>\n<br/>\nTrian Soulreaper<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
