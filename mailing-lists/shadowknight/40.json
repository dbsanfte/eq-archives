This does the same damage as a rusty 2H, but is a lot<br/>\nquicker. It was very addictive, and I just couldn&#39;t put it down to take<br/>\nup 2H. When I finally decided to take up 2H, I managed to get a Dwarf<br/>\nAxe, the best non magic 1H slash in the game. This is even harder to put<br/>\ndown since it just moevs like lightning!<br/>\n<br/>\nChip O&#39;Brien wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ug! Me agree!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (/ooc:  I definitely recommend 2-H slash.  Primarly because you will<br/>\n&gt; hit for an average of 12-15 hits of damage on levels below 9 and this<br/>\n&gt; helps when you are fighting against creatures that run away and are<br/>\n&gt; faster than you.  I hate having to fight frogloks (with 1-H slash)<br/>\n&gt; and, after hitting them several times, have them run away.  I then end<br/>\n&gt; up failing to chase them (because they&#39;re faster than I am (and my<br/>\n&gt; internet connection is too slow)) and have to wait for them to run<br/>\n&gt; back and attack me (which, they unfailingly do, to their eventual<br/>\n&gt; demise (hmm...another subject here?))  This becomes a big pain when<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m fighting like 3 creatures and all are in various stages of running<br/>\n&gt; away/back to attack.  With 2-H slash, I&#39;m almost always able to take<br/>\n&gt; creatures out before they run away.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Azog<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Krukhan Garabash [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krukhan@...\">krukhan@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 22, 1999 4:45 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [shadowknight] Re: 1hs vs 2hs<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Krukhan Garabash&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krukhan@...\">krukhan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - dexterity, attack skills (1h/2h slash, offense) and the &quot;strength&quot;<br/>\n&gt; of the mob you are fighting all seem to have an effect on your hit<br/>\n&gt; rate. in my experience, dex doesn&#39;t play a big role in this as<br/>\n&gt; anything short of a major increase (10+ points) has had no noticable<br/>\n&gt; effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - i recommend 2h slash for beginning characters (a 2h sword will kill<br/>\n&gt; many newbie monsters in 1 or 2 good hits, greatly reducing the<br/>\n&gt; target&#39;s chances of countering) and alternation between 1h and 2h as<br/>\n&gt; necessary or when you reach a skill cap.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - i can see how 1h skill could rise more rapidly that 2h as a 1h<br/>\n&gt; fighter would strike roughly 25% more in each battle than a 2h user.<br/>\n&gt; though, in my experience, the rate of increase is pretty much equal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: erik lawrence antonsen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eantonse@...\">eantonse@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [shadowknight] Re: 1hs vs 2hs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 22 Apr 1999 14:09:28 -0500 (CDT)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: erik lawrence antonsen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eantonse@...\">eantonse@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I would like to know why I miss so much in battle.
