Got it for a steal (I <br/>\n&gt; think) at 85PP.  The weapon is not in that great a <br/>\n&gt; supply/demand though because it is evil race &quot;fighter&quot; <br/>\n&gt; only.<br/>\n&gt; The weapon is great! Is the only one I use now. Of <br/>\n&gt; course, if you are human I don&#39;t think you can use it. :(<br/>\n&gt; As for 1HS, try to get ahold of a PGT.  HHP is the best <br/>\n&gt; place to look for one that I know of. <br/>\n&gt; Another good one is the Barbbed Whip. Najena is the <br/>\n&gt; dungeon for that. Bonecracker drops it I believe. Just <br/>\n&gt; auction in Lavastorm and the Najena zone border for one. <br/>\n&gt; You may just get lucky.<br/>\n&gt; Perma has the best 1HS weapons in the game IMHO. If you <br/>\n&gt; can get to Perma alive I would suggest that. But that <br/>\n&gt; can be hell if you die. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cronik Khaos &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Left Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n&gt; 15th Season Troll SK<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ich warte bis es dunkel ist&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nDann fass Ich an die nasse Haut&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nVerrate Mich nicht&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nOh siehst Du nicht die Brucke brennt&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nHor auf zu schreien und wehr Dich nict&lt;br&gt;<br/>\nWeil Sie sonst auseinander bricht&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n   <br/>\n-------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet personalized e-mail and a web address or your<br/>\nown free e-mail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.networksolutions.com\">http://www.networksolutions.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
