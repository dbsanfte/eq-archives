I&#39;ve traveled around a bit, down to<br/>\nogguk and grobb.  When I try to talk to the Shadow Knight guild masters<br/>\ndown there they tell me they won&#39;t deal with Dark Elves.  I was a<br/>\nlittle disappointed over this.  I&#39;ve also tried to trigger some of the<br/>\nquests down in those towns without any success.  Does anyone know if<br/>\nit&#39;s possible to get trained by a Troll or Ogre Shadow Knight if you&#39;re<br/>\na Dark Elf?  I assume it&#39;s just that they&#39;re not smart enough to<br/>\ninstruct a Tier&#39;Dal ;)  Has anyone managed to make a quest work in<br/>\nthese cities?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nAtrocity<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
