(i.e. No guards, giants or<br/>\ngriffons, etc within my character&#39;s sight.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if your target turns and runs in another direction, the arrow will<br/>\nmost times change its path to follow them.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, and be careful with those arrows!<br/>\n<br/>\nNaela, Shadowmistress of the Teir&#39;Dal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
