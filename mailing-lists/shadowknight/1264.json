I<br/>\nmean, many spots in dungeons were just not made with this in mind. You have<br/>\nno idea how bad it is, less you play a big race to 35 or so. I know all the<br/>\nogres/trolls in my guild that didnt have one wanted one badly.  And I know<br/>\nwhy, and I cant help but feel sorry for them. Shrink spell can only be cast<br/>\nwhen grouped with them by the way. Ill quit whining about it now, just<br/>\nletting ya know what I think about it. BTW, my wifes ogre already has hers,<br/>\nand I am a DE... Just feel for my friends is all, plus, I may wanta start a<br/>\nogre sk myself someday...8)<br/>\n<br/>\nMorg<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wilson, ThomasX B&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thomasx.b.wilson@...\">thomasx.b.wilson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 09, 1999 12:24 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [shadowknight] About time<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Wilson, ThomasX B&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thomasx.b.wilson@...\">thomasx.b.wilson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll agree that for larger races it does suck (disadvantage of being<br/>\n&gt; large?), but maybe the timing of removing this item and getting Alchemy<br/>\n&gt; fixed wasn&#39;t just coincidental. I&#39;ll bet that they either have or will<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; a Shrink spell in the game very soon. I&#39;m not going to lie about it though<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m extremely happy the change happened, and yes I think it should have<br/>\n&gt; happened a lot sooner. I also think it may have been better if they would<br/>\n&gt; have changed the effect to that of shrink (or Gnome, I&#39;ve always wanted to<br/>\n&gt; be a Gnome SK). Oh well, whats done is done.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Steven E.

Many<br/>\n&gt; dungeons are bugged, cant even walk into sola, get back down the stairs in<br/>\n&gt; unrest, etc. This change hurts the large races bad, and came way too late,<br/>\n&gt; atfer everyone and the brother done got it. Now large races are dependent<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; shamans to enter the dungeons. Sucks to depend on 1 class. Maybe they will<br/>\n&gt; throw out a shrink type item, course prob require getting a rare pop off a<br/>\n&gt; dragon or something. I also feel like all the real cool items are gone.<br/>\n&gt; Manastones, guise, jboots, etc. On the older servers so many people<br/>\nalready<br/>\n&gt; have these, and the ogrew that got there late will have to stand and shout<br/>\n&gt; will pay for shrink at the dungeon entrance, while other people just click<br/>\n&gt; on there mask. I am sure you smaller race shadowknights like the change<br/>\n&gt; though.... Dont see why they waited 9 months to do it....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Morg<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Wilson, ThomasX B&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thomasx.b.wilson@...\">thomasx.b.wilson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 09, 1999 11:53 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [shadowknight] About time<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Wilson, ThomasX B&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thomasx.b.wilson@...\">thomasx.b.wilson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Non Dark Elfs probably won&#39;t like this as much, but it looks as though<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Guise is no longer dropping.
