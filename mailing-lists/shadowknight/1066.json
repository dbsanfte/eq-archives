Nice if it exist, but what I want is a quest anywhere like<br/>\nthis. Having to go to all those locations, do all those task. That is a<br/>\nquest. Sitting on my ass in Cazic waiting for a Crusader is not a quest it&#39;s<br/>\na exercise in futility. Hell look at the Soul Fire quest, again a nice drawn<br/>\nout quest (difficult in parts, easy in others), but again it&#39;s a quest not a<br/>\ncamping exercise..

Rumored<br/>\n&gt;stats on sword 33Dmg 33Dly Effect: Combust (180dmg DD or so) Paladin Only.<br/>\n&gt;Now I don&#39;t mind that the Paladin&#39;s get a really nice weapon, what gets me<br/>\n&gt;is that they can obtain their nice weapons through Quest. I would much<br/>\n&gt;rather obtain a kick ass weapon from questing (not camping, but an actual<br/>\n&gt;quest) than having to kill a god (Soul Leech, what&#39;s with the 50pt lifetap<br/>\n&gt;though???). Well I guess I&#39;ll just have to wait and see if the weapon <br/>\n&gt;really<br/>\n&gt;does exist.. And who knows maybe the SK&#39;s have some kick ass sword <br/>\n&gt;available<br/>\n&gt;by a quest (About the same odds as me winning the lottery without buying a<br/>\n&gt;ticket).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Enjoy..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thom<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
