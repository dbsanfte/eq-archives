Keep up the<br/>\ngood work Brian, you seem to be genuinely interested in the pulse of the<br/>\ngamer and the state of EQ as a whole.  As far as web sites, several have<br/>\nbeen listed on this list (if you check the archives, you can find them<br/>\npretty easily).  But, even these sites are rather preliminary and<br/>\nincomplete.  For quests, the best place to look is Allakhazams web site<br/>\nunder the regular quest locations for SK&#39;s (i.e. Grobb, Ogguk, Neriak, FP,<br/>\nQeynos, Southern Karanas, etc.)  For strategies and tactics, check out the<br/>\nEQ Stratics SK board.  Pay special close attention to any posts by Beld<br/>\nDemonblade (that guy KNOWS what he is talking about).<br/>\n<br/>\nI can relate what info I know and have heard from other SK&#39;s.  This is<br/>\npretty standard for any non-twinked character.  Basically, when you reach<br/>\nthe highest level of the range, you should have all of the equipment listed.<br/>\nThis is for the 2H Slashing SK&#39;s which are most common.  Others use Piercing<br/>\nor 1H Slashing, but I don&#39;t know which weapons they are using.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevels 15-20:<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon:  Grobb Cleaver, Brutechopper, Shiny Brass Halberd, or Bone Bladed<br/>\nClaymore<br/>\nArmor:  Banded or Blackened Iron with some misc. stat enhancing armor mixed<br/>\nin (Barbed from Befallen, Spiked stuff from Blackburrow, LJ vest, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLevels 21-30:<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon:  Blackened Iron Bastard Sword or Gigantic Zweihander<br/>\nArmor:  Bronze with misc stat enhancing armor mixed in<br/>\n<br/>\nLevels 31-40:<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon:  Dark Reaver<br/>\nArmor:  Anything better than bronze (steel, rubi, mithril, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLevels 41-50:<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon:  Dark Reaver or better (what&#39;s after it?)<br/>\nArmor:  Beyond your wildest dreams (Plane of Fear stuff, I guess)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg Wraithbone of Bristlebane (22nd level TSK)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Brian Hook [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, September 12, 1999 10:16 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] Strategies and qeusts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brian Hook&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a Web site that lists all the quests and strategies that SKs of the<br/>\ndifference races can perform and for what?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also specifically curious about what kind of gear a typical SK is<br/>\nwielding through his/her career starting from about 15th to<br/>\n50th.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
