Mine went to 16<br/>\n(I think I put 2-3 practice points into it) in a little over 8 hours of<br/>\nplay time.  I also lucked out and found a rough hickory recurve bow (only<br/>\n8g!) from the fletching shop.  I have the same question about fletching<br/>\nsupplies -- currently the only places that I know about that sell all<br/>\npieces are in <br/>\n<br/>\n1) Surefall Glade (I know for sure the book is available here) and <br/>\n2) Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\nboth of which are KOS for us (unless perhaps you kill a lot of gnolls in<br/>\nBlackBurrow?).<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than resorting to a mule (I do have another character that fletches<br/>\nand is a ranger of Surefall), I thought I might be able to make a business<br/>\npartnership with someone who could go to either of these places.  Of<br/>\ncourse, I&#39;d have to find someone willing to deal with such a dark soul as<br/>\nmyself - which might be difficult.  Still, I would be very happy to hear if<br/>\nanyone knows whether arrow components are available in the other dark cities.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaela Shadowmistress of the Teir&#39;Dal<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the illustrious David...<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n:)And still haven&#39;t gotten any<br/>\n:)movement/improvement out of my Archery skill.  And now looking for Fletching<br/>\n:)supplies in Netrick to build my own Arrows/Bows.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n:)Does any one know where the book for Fletching is and/or the supplies are<br/>\n:)(found some behind the mushroom inn) or do I have to go to another city,<br/>\n:)hopefully evil because I am KOS anymore at Freeport, and of course the<br/>\n:)vendors wouldn&#39;t talk to me anyway?  Any ideas or do I have to make (don&#39;t<br/>\n:)want to do this) a mule character to get the items (still can&#39;t believe they<br/>\n:)didn&#39;t make the tools available to us at the bow shop). I have searched and<br/>\n:)haven&#39;t found it, I will look again tonight, maybe I missed someone.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n:)Tenin - Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
