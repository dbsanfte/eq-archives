But here it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about weapons and armor granted to those of<br/>\nspecific deities. For instance, not only is the<br/>\nPestilence Scythe for WAR,SHD,NEC, but it is for<br/>\nworshippers of Bertoxxulous only.<br/>\nSure SKs and Necros of other deities can cast all the<br/>\nsame spells, but worshippers of Bertoxx have a special<br/>\nrelationship with death and disease. They should have<br/>\nexclusive rights to this type of a weapon.<br/>\nWhy should a warrior of Tunare have access to the<br/>\nPestilence Scythe?They are supposed to abhore that<br/>\ntype of power.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this is only an example. All religions will<br/>\nhave their own special little things, and this wont<br/>\napply to all weapons and armor, just certain ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for all the Agnostics out there who will complain,<br/>\ntough. Thats what you get for taking the easy way out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just think certain items need more history behind<br/>\nthem. Right now everything is either class/race<br/>\nspecific. Religion is totally ignored. This doesnt<br/>\nmake sense since religion is a huge part of the game.<br/>\nLets try adding something in there that gives us more<br/>\nof a reason to follow a certain deity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just a random thought as i sit here at work<br/>\nbored to tears.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
