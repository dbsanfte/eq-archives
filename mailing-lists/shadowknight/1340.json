By default you&#39;re not KOS <br/>\nto any of the Quest mobs themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for lifeleech, even though it is a great spell, it does have a 2min <br/>\nrefresh time on it, where other lifetaps don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nX<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- Matt Price &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattren@...\">mattren@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyone on this list 50 and have done this quest?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be 50 in 2 weeks or so, bout halfway through 48<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now. I have a couple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; questions  regarding the quest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.) The necro says to conceal your dark arts. this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mean you have to have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non-necro&#92;sk to do this part?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Need a druid to cast wolf form on you. The guy you get<br/>\n&gt;the faceted hycinth from along with the Dragonscale<br/>\n&gt;armor guy, who is in the same hut, are KoS to SKs<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.) can a group of 40-50s take the monstrous zombie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that spawns? or will I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; need 2 groups?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We did it easily with 1 group. A cleric is a must<br/>\n&gt;though. I got FEARd by him and ended up bugged. The<br/>\n&gt;FEAR had worn off, but i kept running anyway. I could<br/>\n&gt;sit down to stop running, but as soon as i stood, i<br/>\n&gt;started running again. I had to camp out, but they<br/>\n&gt;beat him even without me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3.) why the heck are we getting more nerftaps in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expansion when we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; already have lifeleech?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lifeleech has a 2 minute recast time, and takes about<br/>\n&gt;2 bubbles of mana to cast. Sometimes you just dont<br/>\n&gt;need that much, or you would rather cast faster<br/>\n&gt;spells. Just like any good cleric has multiple Heals<br/>\n&gt;mem&#39;d and not just Complete Heal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;=====<br/>\n&gt;Wherever a Light shines .. a Shadow is born.<br/>\n&gt;Bathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n&gt;Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;__________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!
