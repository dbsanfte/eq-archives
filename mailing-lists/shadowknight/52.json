If you&#39;re fighting spellcasting mobs, its all about<br/>\nquick hits to increase the chance of an interrupt.  If, on the other hand,<br/>\nyou&#39;re fighting in some place like Lavastorm where there&#39;s alot of mobs with<br/>\ndamage shields, speed kills.  Personally, I prefer to have the best of both<br/>\nworlds and be able to use whatever weapon the particular situation calls<br/>\nfor.  Also, I know for a fact that there&#39;s a mix of 1h and 2h holy swords,<br/>\nand from what I can tell, paladins and sk&#39;s parallel *very* closely.  I<br/>\nwould be very unsurpriesed if there are both 1h and 2h flavors of unholy<br/>\nswords, so I figure, might as well keep both skills up. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Beld<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cheers,<br/>\nJude Morrigan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
