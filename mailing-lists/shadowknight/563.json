The list is unfortunately rather quiet as of late. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nlets see if I can help at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe merchant in South Ro in the northwest corner sells to evil characters,<br/>\nbut he is quite expensive unfortunately.<br/>\nThe dark elves in the middle of the S Ro desert now sell combines, so you<br/>\ncan buy one.I think they might sell food and water too.<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t been out of Innothule Swamp yet, how do you know you are<br/>\ndubious in Neriak? I have known many many cazic thule worshipping trolls and<br/>\nthey don&#39;t have any problems getting around in Neriak. I&#39;d suggest trying<br/>\nthat again.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can buy from the centaurs in S Karana (long time before you get there<br/>\nthough)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt used to be that if you bought Buer or something like that, in the<br/>\nfreeport underground, beer, he&#39;d give you faction with the militia. For now<br/>\nthat is taken out, but if it is fixed, it is a relatively easy, if somewhat<br/>\nexpensive, way to get freeport faction. I helped one or two trolls be abe to<br/>\nwalk into Freeport. It&#39;s a sight to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that comes to mind right now, but I&#39;m sure that there is more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the (quiet) list.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
