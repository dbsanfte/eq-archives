One of the NPCs that makes the<br/>\n&gt;SK only armor is in Najena, right?  While this may not be a big deal now,<br/>\n&gt;and I may already have messed this faction to Thule and back anyway, it<br/>\n&gt;makes me edgy. I have only been in there a few times, and killed 1 Ogre <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;wandered near the Magician and her 2 Earth Elemental pets.  I noticed a<br/>\n&gt;Najena Residents -Faction adjusment. After that, My group attacked the<br/>\n&gt;Magician, and I became a stain on the floor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am curious to know for those of you who battle there often, what faction<br/>\n&gt;adjustments you may have seen since they implemented Darkforge Armor. It<br/>\n&gt;will suck to destroy my faction with the only NPC that makes those pieces <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;the armor that only I can wear.  Granted, what you destroyed, you can fix<br/>\n&gt;(hopefully), but that in and of itself can take a lifetime. Or is there no<br/>\n&gt;faction adjustment with this NPC?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, what is the name of this NPC in Najena, and where does he spawn?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I ask these questions as my guild is planning to raid Najena and get some<br/>\n&gt;nifty stuff. Am I about to become screwed when all is said and done?<br/>\n&gt;Any and all information on this is helpful and wanted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Akenar &quot;Cronik&quot; Khaos &lt;Dark Omen&gt;<br/>\n&gt;15th Season TSK (and 1 more kill from 16th!
