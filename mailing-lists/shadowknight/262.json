Maybe that would get their<br/>\n&gt; attention that we might need a power boost.  And maybe publish the results<br/>\n&gt; for us and everyone to see. (But honestly I doubt they would take the time,<br/>\n&gt; they got our money already).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess my 2 questions is shouldn&#39;t we be equal to a paladin at the same<br/>\n&gt; level warrior wise and equal to the magic ability as a paladin is.  I guess<br/>\n&gt; our god is not as powerful as the paladin&#39;s god, maybe that is the correct<br/>\n&gt; assumption?  or maybe a shadow knight was an after thought to the game (hey<br/>\n&gt; lets add some &quot;evil&quot; classes to the game) and never fully tested.  Because<br/>\n&gt; if I have read the posts correctly that no one ever made it to level 50<br/>\n&gt; shadow knight (I think I read that in the undiscovered weapons) in the beta,<br/>\n&gt; but they did make a paladin level in the beta (and that is why they knew the<br/>\n&gt; weapons available for the paladin), if I am wrong let me know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe someone should find a paladin and do a duel with them (same armor and<br/>\n&gt; weapons should be used and preferably stats, and of course the applicable<br/>\n&gt; spells) and see what happens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt; Tenin (DE - lvl 7 - Tarew Marr)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Adam Hill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adamthehill@...\">adamthehill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 05, 1999 2:31 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [shadowknight] A Lil more oon the duel<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Adam Hill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adamthehill@...\">adamthehill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Allright, lets do this in detail.<br/>\n&gt; My guildmate and i had  friendly duel. He was a 18th level Halfling Druid I<br/>\n&gt; myslef was a 17th level Dark Elf Shadowknight. He had full leather and a<br/>\n&gt; screaming mace. I had a shiny brass halberd, Full bronze Platemail, 110 str<br/>\n&gt; after siphoning. He rooted me and blasted me with a spell doing 37 pts a<br/>\n&gt; turn and Stinging swarm. I got the joy of casting my three spells at him<br/>\n&gt; until i was un rooted and harm touched him. The harm touch did HALF a bubble<br/>\n&gt; YES HALF. after he was taxed. Now at melee. My halberd was doing about one<br/>\n&gt; to twenty nine pints of damage. at one time in the duel, I did one point of<br/>\n&gt; damage three times in a row. Also, 75% of my spells were laughed off. the<br/>\n&gt; only good thing i did in my fight was dodge and parry quite often(helps to<br/>\n&gt; be a dark elf fer that). Well thats about that. Rather embarrasing and<br/>\n&gt; disheartening. In beta I played a warrior and never lost a battle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
