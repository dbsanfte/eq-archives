And if you count on HT to beat anything you attack, you get what<br/>\nyou deserve. BUT, thats no excuse for it not working, in my opinion. If<br/>\nit works to its full potential and you still die, which has happened to<br/>\nme, then so be it. But it should be something you can count on to at<br/>\nleast work when an emergency arises.<br/>\nAnd in no way am i saying that SKs are powerless or have no potential.<br/>\nHowever HT still is not the equal of LoH which its supposed to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of our differences of opinion on this, i would like to know<br/>\nwhat you feel would be an effective way to bring our concerns to the<br/>\nDev team, whatever they may be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for responding,<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Leif Smart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leifsmart@...\">leifsmart@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Leif Smart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leifsmart@...\">leifsmart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, I can see your point with the Harm Touch.<br/>\n&gt; However, I&#39;m at level 14 now and I<br/>\n&gt; gave up usuing Harm Touch for anything but emergancy<br/>\n&gt; purposes. Either to save<br/>\n&gt; myself or as the mother of all taunts to save<br/>\n&gt; someone else. If I don&#39;t think I can<br/>\n&gt; win with my sword then I don&#39;t fight, I never think<br/>\n&gt; well if I HT it, it will be an<br/>\n&gt; even fight.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We must also remmeber that we get a pet. Woopee Doo!<br/>\n&gt; You might think, it&#39;s a crap<br/>\n&gt; one. But it does server many great uses. First, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; an extra attack during<br/>\n&gt; battle, somewhat makingup for our lack of Duel<br/>\n&gt; Wield. It&#39;s a great way to get rid<br/>\n&gt; of those annoying rusty short swords, since it makes<br/>\n&gt; the pet more effective. And<br/>\n&gt; alos, it is a great delaying and early warning<br/>\n&gt; device. My pet has saved me from<br/>\n&gt; giants on a number of times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Inos<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
