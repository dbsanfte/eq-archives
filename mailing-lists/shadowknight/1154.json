This is intentional??? To balance the &quot;power&quot; of the spells?? What<br/>\nthe hell is that? When rangers cast druid heals, they don&#39;t cost twice the<br/>\nmana. When paladins cast cleric heals, they don&#39;t cast twice as much. Yet we<br/>\nwhen we get necro lifetaps, you charge us DOUBLE. This makes no sense. I<br/>\nhave 1200hp, a 45hp lifetap is not amazing, then you go so far as to make it<br/>\ncost MORE mana than it should! Yeah, bait and switch alright. At least be<br/>\nconsistent, for crying out loud. Why do SKs get the short end of the stick?<br/>\nThis is not about lifetaps anymore, this is about BEING FAIR. If you say<br/>\nyou&#39;re gonna do something, then DO IT without adding HIDDEN crap like this.<br/>\nIf this is what you call &quot;helping the shadow knight class&quot; then you can keep<br/>\nit, I don&#39;t want your &quot;help.&quot; What a crock...<br/>\n<br/>\nDravith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
