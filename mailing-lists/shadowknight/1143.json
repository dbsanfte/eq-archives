C&#39;mon, bronze armor is given away<br/>\nnow on cazik thule, and It used to be hard to get hold of. What few newbies<br/>\nthere are have at least banded on. All have become worthless. I would like<br/>\nto see twinkability limited to the bronze. I think if you want this armor,<br/>\nyou should have to go get it yourself.

I liked the fact that lowbies couldn&#39;t get the<br/>\n&gt; armor unless they did it themselves. My opinion is that all class specific<br/>\n&gt; armor should be No Drop, if you can&#39;t do the quest with the character that<br/>\n&gt; will be wearing the armor then you shouldn&#39;t have it. (But of course i&#39;m<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; of those that thinks there should be level limits on armor and equipment<br/>\n&gt; anyway.. I hate seeing lvl 10 and under Sk&#39;s with a DR or similar)..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway... I think I&#39;ll feedback it as well when I get on tonight..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh something that was kind of bugging me, is there anyway to delete a<br/>\nspell<br/>\n&gt; from your spell book? The since the new lifetaps didn&#39;t overwrite the<br/>\n&gt; existing spells I still have them in my book (and obviously can&#39;t use<br/>\n&gt; them).. I&#39;ve moved them to like page 15 or so, but would like to delete<br/>\n&gt; them. Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enjoy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thomas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
