I started a shadowknight on Bertoxulous and<br/>\n&gt; got<br/>\n&gt; him to 16 when I left to restart on Tallon.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; moved Atrocity up to level 31 on Tallon, and also<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; a level 16 wiz there, just for fun.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know that we have a lot of seasoned shadowknights<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; this list, and there were many times when I read the<br/>\n&gt; posts thinking, oh, this will be useful when I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; 30+...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, the big challenge for me right now is<br/>\n&gt; Darkforged<br/>\n&gt; Armor.  I&#39;m getting ready to move into Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; start collecting this.  I&#39;ve already picked up 2<br/>\n&gt; pieces of melatite, 1 fairy dust, and 1 Qeynos<br/>\n&gt; shield,<br/>\n&gt; so I really need to work on the decayed drops.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone have some good tips for me on getting this<br/>\n&gt; stuff?  I&#39;ve heard that the 4 corners spot through<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; maze is the most likely place to find the crusaders.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I look at this on the map, I get shivers.  From<br/>\n&gt; what I can tell it looks like if anything goes wrong<br/>\n&gt; in there and you&#39;re not a class that can gate,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; had it.  I just can&#39;t see anyone running from 4<br/>\n&gt; corners all the way through the maze and making it<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; the zone.  I don&#39;t have a wiz in my party, so group<br/>\n&gt; evac isn&#39;t much of an option.  I know that I can try<br/>\n&gt; feign and invis, but this still makes me nervous.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any and all advice on acquiring decayed armor is<br/>\n&gt; greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS. for sol b and fire giants, the best info I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; see<br/>\n&gt; is at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://monks.volitionx.com/monkzones.htm\">http://monks.volitionx.com/monkzones.htm</a> it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; amazingly good for a monk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Atrocity<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Matt Price &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattren@...\">mattren@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well I just found out there was a list about<br/>\n&gt; amonth<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ago and this thread is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the first one i have received so I&#39;ll introduce<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I just got 47 with Squiggles, My Troll SK on<br/>\n&gt; Vallon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Zek.
