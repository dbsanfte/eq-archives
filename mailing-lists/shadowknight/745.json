Guk and you&#39;ll won&#39;t have to worry about waiting<br/>\nto heal as you will be coming back to your spawn point fairly quickly..<br/>\n(with full health I might add).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso considering that any lifetap we get would be so low in level it&#39;s not<br/>\ngoing to make a dent in my 1000+ hp&#39;s. At least with VE I don&#39;t have to<br/>\nworry about it, just cast it as the puller is incoming and let it do it&#39;s<br/>\nthing. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh and Shadow Step is one of my most used spells in PVP. Really pisses off<br/>\nother melee classes if you keep bouncing around Dot&#39;ing them (Plus a nice<br/>\nbow).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust give us a good old fashioned Armageddon spell that kills everything in<br/>\nsite and I&#39;ll be happy :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Brian Hook [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 17, 1999 1:03 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [shadowknight] Another suggestion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brian Hook&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are correct, the damage shields were far too powerful if put on a big SK<br/>\n(ogre/troll).  Your comments about Shadow Step are interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nLifetap/spike/draw would be used near the end of a melee in a group -- you<br/>\ncould use it as a quick heal to minimize downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd personally, it has always been my idea that an SK feeds off the life<br/>\nforce of the weak, so after a fight walking around and sucking the life out<br/>\nof gnolls and orcs sounds very in character...<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nShare your special moments with family and friends- send PHOTO Greetings<br/>\nat Zing.com!
