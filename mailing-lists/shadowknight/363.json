But only in the<br/>\nFeerot so far.  It worked ok in Innothule swamp, but in the feerot, it<br/>\nseems to go berzerk.  Anyway, Just wondering if anyone had this happen to<br/>\nthem.  What other zones does it happen in?  Let me know f you have any<br/>\ninfo...Also curious, what are some of the pet commands.  The only one that<br/>\nseemed to work was /pet sit down.  I tried /pet attack, /pet kill, /pet<br/>\nfollow me.
