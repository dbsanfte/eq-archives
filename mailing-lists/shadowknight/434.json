I would be fantastic to have, <br/>\nbut I doubt it will ever be implemented.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I think might be more feasible would be for Verant to increase the <br/>\npower of Vampiric Embrace so that it works exactly the same for both Necros <br/>\nand Shadow Knights. As near as I can tell, when we get it at level 22, it&#39;s <br/>\neffectiveness is already weaker then a Necromancer of around level 8. I&#39;ve <br/>\nheard of many Necro&#39;s stating that it taps for 30+ a whack for them in the <br/>\nlate teens, increasing by a point or so around every level. However, it <br/>\nseems that when we get the spell it is much weaker then a level 8 Necro&#39;s VE <br/>\n- which is why it taps for just six points or so at the start for us (which <br/>\nis in reality pretty useless). My Necro friend just confirmed that when <br/>\nNecro&#39;s get this spell around level 8, they tap for around 20 a whack. Why <br/>\nis it that when we get it, it starts at six?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m only a paltry level 13, so I can&#39;t confirm the Vampiric Embrace <br/>\nperformance for Shadow Knights myself. But, from what I have been able to <br/>\ngather from message boards, this spell is definitely performing differently <br/>\nfor us.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only other suggestion would be for Voice Graft to be replaced with Hungry <br/>\nEarth, a Necromancer spell of comparison level that would fit into our DOT <br/>\ntheme as well providing a much needed Root type of spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nZulk, Veeshan Troll SDK, 13th power<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
