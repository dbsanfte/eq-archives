It<br/>\nsaid i started to memorize Reclaim Energy, the red bar would drop all<br/>\nthe way down, but then it would just sit there. It would never finish <br/>\nand no icon would show up in my memorized spell section.<br/>\nMy necro friend tried hers, and it worked fine.<br/>\nWhen i tried this i was in Befallen, i havent tried it outside of there<br/>\nyet.<br/>\nBut i am wondering if anyone else has had this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarless, as soon as im on tonight, i&#39;ll be filling out a bug report.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
