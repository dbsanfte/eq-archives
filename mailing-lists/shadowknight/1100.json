I didn&#39;t<br/>\nuse the spells they replaced and most likely I won&#39;t use them. But I&#39;m sure<br/>\nthere going to be more useful to new SK&#39;s more so than the ones they<br/>\nreplace. So in this particular case I&#39;ll just sit back and let the change<br/>\nhappen since it really doesn&#39;t effect me or my SK. Now what I don&#39;t want is<br/>\nto hear a week after it goes live that it sucks. You asked for them, and you<br/>\ngot them so live with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the real question. I was talking to an acquaintance about this, Do<br/>\nyou all feel that the larger races make better SK&#39;s? From the impression I<br/>\nreceived Verant feels that the larger races are that much better, where I<br/>\nreally don&#39;t see it. I personally play a DE and I can easily go toe to toe<br/>\nwith a Ogre or Troll (I&#39;ve never lost a duel to an equal level SK yet), and<br/>\nfrom observing other Sk&#39;s in combat I can do fairly equal damage (at the<br/>\nhigher lvls 35+) to my larger counterparts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do you all think? Are larger races more powerful SK&#39;s? Both PVE and<br/>\nPVP.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
