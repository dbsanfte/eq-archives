","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-213701030\">I do believe that Shadow Knight is great class with (in my opinion) a<br/>\nfew glitches.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn one point that Steven brought up, though, i must burst his bubble<br/>\nsome.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point in time your wife&#39;s SK will NOT get a lifetap spell.<br/>\nThe only spell available to us as a lifetap was Vampiric Embrace but<br/>\nthis isnt the case. Many have tried this spell in everyway imaginable<br/>\nand no HP is transferred from the target to the caster. All it seems to<br/>\ndo is raise your attack for about 20 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as far as bashing and slamming. Thats Troll and Ogre specific.<br/>\nHuman, Gnome, Dark Elf and Euridite SKs never get slam and need a<br/>\nshield to bash. But i personally dont see this as a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd anybody who can wield a halberd will do 24 dmg. Thats not SK only.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only things i feel could be improved is the Harm Touch should not<br/>\nbe resisted and at level 15, start getting HP drain spells that<br/>\nactually work.<br/>\nAnd at level 30 we can use Voice Graft. YEEEHAAAA!!! I can see myself<br/>\nspending a couple plat on that one. This should definitely be replaced<br/>\nwith Gate or something worthwhile.<br/>\nAnd Endure Cold and later Resist Cold dont make as much sense as having<br/>\na universal shield spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, i feel the pets are fine as they are. Though if they got<br/>\nupgraded, i obviously wouldnt complain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe comment was made by someone a while ago that these changes would<br/>\nmake the game easy. I fail to see this. I too dont want an easy<br/>\ncakewalk of a game. But i would like my character to have equal skills<br/>\nto other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
