Granted I can&#39;t solo if I <br/>\nwanted to (I&#39;m a DE), or if I did, I&#39;d have massive downtime.  I think it&#39;s <br/>\nthe variation that is appealing.  The main reason I don&#39;t like playing the <br/>\nwizard much anymore is because I feel like I stand for 1 min, cast, cast, <br/>\ncast, then sit for 5+ minutes medding.  At least I can play with my spell <br/>\nbook now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the SK, I&#39;m the puller generally, so I get to run around and just do <br/>\nmore.  So I guess that&#39;s what I find more appealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nX.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----Original Message Follows----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI am starting to have that itch again.  I think I am not<br/>\nenjoying my Troll anymore.  Since I started playing my<br/>\nDruid, I dread getting on as my troll. But I can&#39;t put<br/>\nmy finger on why. I haven&#39;t played Cronik in a week or<br/>\nso.<br/>\nI have /played my Druid for &lt;14 hours and am 2 bubs into<br/>\n6th level.  I guess I have learned how to level rather<br/>\nquickly with my class of choice.  This may be slow to<br/>\nsome, but for me it is astronomically fast.<br/>\nI am in the middle of a mental debate on whether or not<br/>\nto scrap him, sell everything, run to my druid, die and<br/>\nleave him a big inheritance.<br/>\nAnyone else run into this problem of character ping-pong?<br/>\nThings at home are also very stressed, so that isn&#39;t<br/>\nhelping either.<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik Khaos &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
