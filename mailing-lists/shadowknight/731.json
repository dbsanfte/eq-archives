With VE I can<br/>\ncast once and stay in the battle. Also I&#39;ve noticed that it counts as a 3rd<br/>\nattack (I&#39;ve doubled and still had the VE effect go off). If they could just<br/>\nup the damage and make it go off more often that would be great with me.<br/>\nMaybe give VE at 15 and a upgraded version at 30 (is there a upgraded<br/>\nversion???). <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso on pets, I think they have a use, but only up to about the third circle<br/>\nof spells (lvl 22). I was still soloing quite a bit at that point and the<br/>\npet was nice to have. I do think that they need to dumb a few of pet utility<br/>\nspells though and replace them with something that might someday be mistaken<br/>\nfor something useful (Voice Graft, Mend Bones and Reclaim Energy - I have<br/>\nnever used any of these except to see what they do). Personally I&#39;d like to<br/>\nsee us get the Grim Aura line of spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just some thoughts. <br/>\n<br/>\nThomas<br/>\nOccasional columnist at Voodoo Extreme<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.voodooextreme.com\">http://www.voodooextreme.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
