I just thought<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d add my<br/>\n&gt; 2 cp worth.<br/>\n&gt; I play a Human Sk on Veeshan. Just a bub off lvl 28 now and hangin for my<br/>\n&gt; new spells! I&#39;m still mostly in banded but quite a few magical<br/>\n&gt; pieces on me<br/>\n&gt; such as Barbed arms, grotesque mask and black crown. I carry a Bibs for 2H<br/>\n&gt; and a PGT with cracked darkwood for 1H. I&#39;ve founbd that in a<br/>\n&gt; small group of<br/>\n&gt; less then 3 I&#39;m better off with the 1 H since it is more of a defensive<br/>\n&gt; setup while in a larger group dmg done is more important so I use<br/>\n&gt; the bibs.<br/>\n&gt; I also carry a Dragoon Dirk in my range slot foir the Dex bonus<br/>\n&gt; which means<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t carry my beloved Ashwood Bow<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My favourtie story would have to be when I dueled someone. The whole diel<br/>\n&gt; lasted 30 min which is more of a marathon. Using a combination of shadow<br/>\n&gt; step and attckking I employed hit and run tactics. Eventually I succumbed<br/>\n&gt; having only done 127 dmg total 8( I don;t feel too bad however since the<br/>\n&gt; person I was dueling was a lvl 38 Necro when I was just lvl 26.<br/>\n&gt; Imagine what<br/>\n&gt; it would have been like if we had been close in lvl! I trully<br/>\n&gt; beleive the SK<br/>\n&gt; are nest best duellers after the Casters and even then we can give them a<br/>\n&gt; run for their mioney!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;&#39;s about it for me!<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll keep in touch!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good hunting to you all!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Inos<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Who is the most visited e-mail list community Web Service?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist.com - where more than 20 million e-mails are exchanged each day!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
