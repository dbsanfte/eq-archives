I&#39;ve heard that the<br/>\nnew quest armor was broken on Test, but I assume will be fixed before<br/>\ntomorrow.  If anyone can post logs of talking to the quest giver I&#39;d<br/>\nlove to hear it.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quest is given by a Greater Skeleton in the Graveyard of Mistmoore.<br/>\nIt requires pieces of Decayed Armor found off Lizard Crusaders in<br/>\nCazic Thule.  I don&#39;t yet know what else is required, but I assume <br/>\nthat there is either more items or monetary components (metals or<br/>\ngems) involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not seen stats or screenshots of how it looks.  I can&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve they made the rogue armor look like plate.  It could have <br/>\nthe exact same stats, but I think black leather would have been<br/>\nmore fitting.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
