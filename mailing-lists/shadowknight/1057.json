So anyone<br/>\nthinking that they were escaping the dreaded red armor<br/>\ndue to their race can stop hoping.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is leading me to believe that i was misinformed<br/>\nas to the color of the BP. The inventory graphic was<br/>\nprobably black, as are the boots, so he may have<br/>\nassumed that it was black when put on. I dont know.<br/>\nEventually someone will get it and we&#39;ll know for<br/>\nsure.<br/>\nThe bracer&#39;s inventory graphic looks like banded.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as to why they are filling us up with STA stats, i<br/>\ndont know. Maybe there were complaints that we dont<br/>\nhave as many HPs as warriors?.. whatever. Im just<br/>\ndisappointed again with the boots. One of the pieces i<br/>\nwas actually looking forward to.<br/>\nMaybe i will go get the DW boots after all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSweet dreams<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
