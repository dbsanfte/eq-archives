Correct choice of which version<br/>\nof the spell would be important.  The damage/heal of the lifetap should be<br/>\ngreater in power than the damage that the pet does because the pet only<br/>\nneeds to be summoned once whereas lifetap must be cast throughout the<br/>\ncombat.  This will result in slightly less downtime between battles, but<br/>\nwill be balanced by the fact that we will need to mediatate to get the mana<br/>\nback that we used to cast the lifetaps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbso-friggin-lutely!
