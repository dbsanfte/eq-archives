Max damage is nice but in the overal picture if the two SK&#39;s were to fight the exact same mob (and if we were able to eliminate the randomness involved), how would the fight end. Would the Troll do more damage and end the fight quicker but in the process also take more damage than said DE SK.. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Any ideas? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
