That<br/>\nstory greatly intrigued me.<br/>\nI thought i would have to wait for the PoH to open<br/>\nbefore i found out more about it. Glad to see he&#39;s<br/>\nfound new friends :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a brief recap,for those who may not know,of that<br/>\nstory as i remember it:<br/>\n<br/>\nPeitro Zarn (the main SK guildmaster in Freeport)<br/>\n&quot;saved&quot; Opal, the cleric GM (name?), and Xicotl (a<br/>\ntroll, didnt notice any class reference) from wasted<br/>\nlives or some such thing. Xicotl was an etremely<br/>\nintelligent troll apparently. He eventually tried to<br/>\ntake the Dismal Rage over, but Zarn summoned the<br/>\npowers of Innoruuk and banished Xicotl to the Plane of<br/>\nHate.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd Story<br/>\n<br/>\nI am indeed curious as to what he has to say about<br/>\nZarn and company.<br/>\nDoes he still follow Innoruuk? or has he converted to<br/>\nanother dark god?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note:<br/>\n<br/>\nI did one of those stupid bard delivery quests and<br/>\nnoticed my faction with Mistmoore himself dropped. Any<br/>\nclue why?<br/>\nLooks like Lenya may be biting the dust soon :)<br/>\nI want to try my hardest to get in good with the MM<br/>\ncrowd. Would beinteresting to just go walking thru<br/>\nthere saying high to everyone. Pipedream? maybe. guess<br/>\ni&#39;ll find out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
