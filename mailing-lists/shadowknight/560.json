I either die a lot or get barely any exp.  I do like to<br/>\ngroup but I seem to only get one for like 1/2 at a time and it is hard to find<br/>\na group for such a short time and I hate leaving people in tough areas when I<br/>\nleave.  Any help would be great.  I don&#39;t mind traveling either so any<br/>\nsuggestions will help. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks <br/>\n<br/>\nSanil<br/>\nLvl 10  SK<br/>\n<br/>\nA proud member of the SK brotherhood!<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
