I went to a different server.  There&#39;s no need to quit the game<br/>\nover it.  Lots of servers have people with better attitudes.  And the<br/>\nstarting over isn&#39;t so bad -- I found levelling was much easier when I knew<br/>\nhow to play the character, and how to avoid newbie death.  Try another<br/>\nserver before quitting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLilah,<br/>\nQuellios.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the illustrious Chip Paul...<br/>\n:)<br/>\n:)I, myself, am leaving EQ, beacause I can&#39;t stand the majority of<br/>\n:)the people on my server.  A druid and a level 50 warrior were tracking<br/>\n:)down and killing all of the crusaders in cazic today so that they could<br/>\n:)do the quests, and then try to find a way to trade the nodrop armor<br/>\n:)to a low level twink.  She was not only doing this, but competing <br/>\n:)with me in /auction for looting pieces.  Earlier, I gave the rogue<br/>\n:)in my group the ravenscale legs without even doing a random, and she<br/>\n:)wasn&#39;t even someone I knew.  Both Verant and the players on my<br/>\n:)server have made it more of a chore to play than fun.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n:)So good luck everyone finding your armor, hope you live on a more<br/>\n:)civil server than Tunare.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n:)Xilith, signing off.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
