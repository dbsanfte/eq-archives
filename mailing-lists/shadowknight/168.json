But I will post my findings as soon as i do, unless<br/>\nsomeone beats me to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as far as casting wasting a swing with a weapon, true it will, IF<br/>\nyou time it wrong. I always cast right after i swing. When the next<br/>\nround starts, im swinging again as normal. When i time it like this, it<br/>\ndoesnt seem to take away any of my melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd i did notice that when you cast Siphon, your ATTACK goes up the<br/>\nsame amount as your STR does.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus what does it hurt to cast it. Its not a spell you absolutely need<br/>\nto win a battle, so if it gets interrupted, who cares? But its good for<br/>\npracticing Alter (i believe). This will help in the future when we get<br/>\nmore useful spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
