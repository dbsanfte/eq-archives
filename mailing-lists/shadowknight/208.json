There is only one thing that has been bothering me, which is that we don&#39;t get Gather Shadows until level 30. Rangers get there invisibility spell at level 15, which can also be cast on others unlike Gather Shadows, even though it is only outdoor. I definitely think that Shadow Knights are superior, but as we are evil, Gather Shadows should be a level 22 spell, if not level 15. Has this been bugging anyone else?<br/>\n<br/>\nTulwump, soon to be level 8 Troll SK<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember to visit my web page at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/nj2/shadowknight/index.html\">http://www.angelfire.com/nj2/shadowknight/index.html</a><br/>\nI have been working on it for a while today, and it has been coming along nicely!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
