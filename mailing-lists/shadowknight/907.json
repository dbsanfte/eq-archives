My problem is more like the way a pinball does in a<br/>\npinball machine between the bumpers.  I have been playing this game since<br/>\naround Beta 3 and I have NEVER had a character above level 20 because I have<br/>\nnever stuck with just one long enough to get there.  I have about 9<br/>\ncharacters that are all in the teens.  So I guess that makes me a<br/>\ncharacteraholic.  Yeah...I feel your pain friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nLrddragn,<br/>\nVarious characters on Fennin Ro<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Shadowknight@onelist.com\">Shadowknight@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Shadowknight@onelist.com\">Shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, September 30, 1999 3:25 PM<br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] Advise Needed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am starting to have that itch again.  I think I am not<br/>\n&gt;enjoying my Troll anymore.  Since I started playing my<br/>\n&gt;Druid, I dread getting on as my troll. But I can&#39;t put<br/>\n&gt;my finger on why. I haven&#39;t played Cronik in a week or<br/>\n&gt;so.<br/>\n&gt;I have /played my Druid for &lt;14 hours and am 2 bubs into<br/>\n&gt;6th level.  I guess I have learned how to level rather<br/>\n&gt;quickly with my class of choice.  This may be slow to<br/>\n&gt;some, but for me it is astronomically fast.<br/>\n&gt;I am in the middle of a mental debate on whether or not<br/>\n&gt;to scrap him, sell everything, run to my druid, die and<br/>\n&gt;leave him a big inheritance.<br/>\n&gt;Anyone else run into this problem of character ping-pong?<br/>\n&gt;Things at home are also very stressed, so that isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;helping either.<br/>\n&gt;Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Cronik Khaos &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Left Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n&gt;15th Season Troll SK<br/>\n&gt;Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
