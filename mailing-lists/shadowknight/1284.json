I am the leader of<br/>\n&lt;Da Bashin&#39; Iggles&gt;. My guild and our allies are preparing for a dragon<br/>\nraid in a month at the max. Tried Fire Giants for the first time on<br/>\nSaturday night, did ok on the first 3, but got massacred after that. Anyone<br/>\ngot any tips on FG&#39;s, dragons, or breaking into the Planes? Pulling<br/>\nlocations for FG&#39;s would be most beneficial at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me remind you that this is Race War PvP server so we are an al evil<br/>\nteam guild, as are our allies. So we don&#39;t have bards or monks.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nSquiggles Jiggles<br/>\nlvl 47 TSK<br/>\nleader of Da Bashin&#39; Iggles<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.ciab.net/iggles</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
