Here are some answers to your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Food, water, weapons.  Food & water can be purchased in Ogguk, Grobb, Neriak, or from other players (summoned or regular).  Guards in Ogguk & Neriak con Dubious, but merchants should be at least apprehensive and will sell to you.  Just stay away from the Tavern in Ogguk cause the cook there will KoS you.  (I worship Innoruuk so mileage may vary)  For weapons, your best are through quests or other players and combine weapons are a waste of money, IMHO.  For 2 Handed, do the bone chip quest in Grobb then sharpen the rusty 2 hander you get at the Ogguk forge (stones available in Grobb).  When you reach around 18th or 19th level, do the Grobb Cleaver quest from Carver C.  In between, try to buy a FS 2 Hander from another player.  I bought mine for 5p.  Use the money you saved on weapons to buy some good armor.  For 1 Handed, go with a mino axe (bought from another player).  Magic weapons should not be necessary for 1 handed as 2 hander should be your main weapon (use 1 handed only for skill building), but get Polished Granite Tomahawk if you want one.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2)  NPC&#39;s in S Ro will sell to you.  It heard that they have recently started carrying combine weapons, but I have not personally verified this.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg of Bristlebane (22nd level TSK)  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginal-From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\nOriginal-Reply-to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nOriginal-Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1999 22:37:04 +0000<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis may have been recieved twice, but the list has not <br/>\nrecognized my mail ID yet. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello all.<br/>\nI play a 4th (almost 5th) level Shadow Knight Troll. I <br/>\nplan on investing quite a bit in this character, but <br/>\nwant to know how to get food/water/weapons etc. <br/>\nfrom &quot;good&quot; cities. The underground in Freeport doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave any food vendors that I know of, nor does the Shady <br/>\nSwashbuckler in the N.Ro tunnel to East Commons. <br/>\nIn Neriak I am &quot;looks at you dubiously&quot; but not KOS, and <br/>\nI think I am KOS in Ogre-ville (I chose to worship Cazic <br/>\nThule). So that limits me to Grobb, RO and Commons, and ï¿½D<br/>\nNeriak.<br/>\nI won&#39;t even think of going to Faydwer for a long time. <br/>\nDoes the NPC merchant tents in South RO sell to Evil <br/>\nrace characters? I have seen it on a map of South Ro, <br/>\nbut haven&#39;t actually been out of Innuthule Swamp yet. My <br/>\nwife did as her Troll, but hated playing it.<br/>\nAnother thing that worries me is that the Combine <br/>\nWeapons sold by gypsies are not an option for a solo <br/>\nplayer unless I get one at auction (which I am forced <br/>\ninto due to masive lag :( ) since they KOS me as well.<br/>\nI enjoy the Troll, but need help to figure out a way <br/>\naround these major milestones.<br/>\nAny and all help is welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik<br/>\n4ht Rank Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
