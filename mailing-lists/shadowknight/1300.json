But it is only<br/>\nmarginally better than a Ykesha, and has no proc.  Dex will make your<br/>\nvampiric embrace go off a little more, but I wouldn&#39;t worry about Dex<br/>\nmuch at all unless you have a Ykesha or Soul Leech (dunno about the<br/>\nDrinker of Blood from Sky), and definately don&#39;t sacrifice AC for<br/>\ndex in any case.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can get it, Bloodmoon is the ultimate small race SK weapon,<br/>\nand currently is arguably the best weapon in the game.  It is 18/28<br/>\none handed, but dropped off Innoruuk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a small race, you should always carry 1H/shield in addition to<br/>\na 2H weapon if you choose to use 2H most of the time.  At levels 45+<br/>\nyou should use an EBW/Ykesha/Abbassi (Of course bloodmoon if you get <br/>\nit) instead of a Dark Reaver, and only use 2H if you have a Razing<br/>\nSword, Soul Leech, or a Mithril 2H.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
