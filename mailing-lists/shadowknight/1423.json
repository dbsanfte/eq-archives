A new poll has been created for the <br/>\nshadowknight group:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been playing an SK since EQ went <br/>\nonline.  Leveling characters has gotten <br/>\neasier and easier over time with <br/>\nimroved tradeskills, focus effects, <br/>\nrevisions to the combat tables, <br/>\nfiltration of items down through the <br/>\neconomy, etc.  Do you think: <br/>\n<br/>\n  o this has made playing an SK too easy, I long for the old days. <br/>\n  o SK&#39;s will rule no matter what Verant does to the game. <br/>\n  o it is about the right difficulty now, SK&#39;s rule the high-end game now. <br/>\n  o it is still too hard, the Orcs in East Commons still kick my butt everytime I come by. <br/>\n  o ...what?  This list still EXISTS?!?!? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo vote, please visit the following web page:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shadowknight/surveys?id=1098051\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shadowknight/surveys?id=1098051</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\nNote: Please do not reply to this message.
