Hiding is part of a SK&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost desired spell:  Bind Affinity.  I know this will never happen as all the other fighter classes will be up in arms about it if you did.  My reasons are threefold:  1) SK&#39;s have terrible KoS problems, 2) SK&#39;s have serious exp penalties, 3) SK&#39;s are a devious and sneaky bunch.  This is an attempt to balance the exp and KoS problems of the class.  Let me set the record straight.  Being KoS and having high exp penalties are part of the class, I don&#39;t find fault in that, they come with the job.  BUT, when I do die (which is more often than any other class), I usually have to run across 4 to 5 zones just to retrieve my stuff.  That is just wasted real and game time and the thing that turns me off the most about SK&#39;s.  I don&#39;t hate dying because it will take me another 2 hours to get the exp back.  I hate dying because I know I have to run for 20 minutes to even start the 2 hours.  Hell, sell some bind affinity potions and let everyone use them.  Just let me bind outside the dungeon (I live in dungeons anyways, not cities), it&#39;s safer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if the Lifetap series is well suited for a warrior/caster (too slow and/or too weak), but it is much better than the fluff that we have now.<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg Wraithbone of Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I&#39;m pissed cause my ISP dropped me just as I was saving a friend from getting trained and am most likely dead now (i.e. load game...run for 20 minutes...finally start to play game).

The reason the high level shields and DoTs were pulled<br/>\nis because (believe it or not) a lot of the players here are SKs and as such<br/>\nknow the class real well and giving them those capabilities made them into,<br/>\nliterally, tank mages.  It&#39;s a scary sight seeing these guys at work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve stated before, the thing that hurts the SK class are primarily race<br/>\nissues -- a damage shield on a human or DE SK is not unbalancing, however it<br/>\nIS unbalanced if you put it on a troll or ogre SK.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what can be changed that makes the class more viable for non-big-races<br/>\nbut at the same time is not unbalancing for trolls/ogres?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know HT comes up a lot, but there is a fear that HT could end up being<br/>\nheavily abused (worst nightmare....party of 6 50th level SKs stand around<br/>\nMr. Named Mob that only pops once a day anyway, BAM 3000HP gone instantly<br/>\nand you now have a mob that starts the fight at 1/2 HP).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf HT was upped slightly, had a slightly higher recharge rate, etc...what<br/>\nare your suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
