The lag in the Karanas was <br/>\nterrible. I had a mage-type cast invis on me before I <br/>\nwent through S.Karana alone.<br/>\nSplitpaw sucked major sh**. I was there the 1st night at <br/>\npeak gaming hours and there were only 5 people in he <br/>\nentire dungeon. 3 of those were 25th +.  The second was <br/>\na 16th level half-elf (don&#39;t remember what class, but <br/>\nshe could heal).  We grouped and I died in the 1st fight <br/>\nwith the commander and Rex Ren. Thank Thule I was bound <br/>\nin Oggok and not Neriak!<br/>\nThe next day I was solo (and the only one in it) most of <br/>\nthe time and I learned the dungeon by heart very <br/>\nquickly. I hardly got any XP for all the gnolls I <br/>\nkilled, but faction adjustment with the residents and <br/>\nQeynos guards went up... not sure how much though. I did <br/>\nget good loot (cloth armor) and cash from the guard <br/>\ngnolls though. I was tempted to try the very back room <br/>\nwith the 4 Shaman in it, but they all conned blue to me <br/>\nand I knew better than that! <br/>\nWandering around a 17+ zone (S.Karana) didn&#39;t make me <br/>\nfeel very comefortable so I returned to South Ro after <br/>\ngetting bound in Grobb.  Looks like I&#39;ll be killing <br/>\nDervs for a while. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere besides Commonlands Oasis and Ro would be a good <br/>\nplace for a 15th level SK to get to/adventure solo while <br/>\nlooking for a group? KoS is a big factor here.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
