This is supposed to be the<br/>\nopposite, but EQUAL of the Paladin&#39;s Lay on Hands. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. Now lets crunch some numbers here.<br/>\n-LoH potentially heals upto about 1000HP<br/>\n-HT at its best, at level 50, will do 501 pts dmg<br/>\n-  501=1000 ? Not last I knew<br/>\nNow here&#39;s my thoughts on this. I do feel that our HT should do equal<br/>\ndmg that LoH does healing. Now many feel, including some SKs, that this<br/>\nwould be too powerful. And i can see that point. But my question is,<br/>\nwhy do Paladins get such a strong healing spell? If HT is  supposed to<br/>\nbe the equal of paladins LoH, why isnt it?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. HT is resisted way too often for comfort when fighting higher level<br/>\ncreatures. For a &quot;special&quot; feature, it doesn&#39;t seem too special when<br/>\nyou need to do that 111 pts damage because you&#39;re getting stomped on<br/>\nand you see the message &quot;target has resisted your Harm Touch&quot;. <br/>\nLets go back to LoH. How often is that resisted? I review many message<br/>\nboards, and i have yet to see a single complaint about LoH being<br/>\nresisted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Partial Damage. Ive seen myself and heard from many others that even<br/>\nwhen it doesn&#39;t get resisted totally, it will do only half damage. And<br/>\nan even more disturbing report is that on occasion it will do only<br/>\n19dmg. Unless you&#39;re having trouble with that pesky large rat, 19dmg<br/>\nisn&#39;t gonna do a whole heck of a lot.<br/>\nLoH? Again, i&#39;ve heard no complaints on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention of course, for something we can use only once a day, it<br/>\nshould work and work to its full potential every time.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. I feel, to make HT a viable weapon, it needs to either, do equal<br/>\ndamage as LoH does healing, or boost its power some but have it<br/>\navailable more than once per day. And in either case have it NEVER<br/>\nresisted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are my main concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other concerns I feel are less important, but important still.<br/>\nI feel the spells we received could be boosted some, or at least have<br/>\navailable some spells that are more useful.<br/>\nThe first set we get are useful, but kinda lame. OK, i can deal with<br/>\nthat, because its our first set. But at level 15, I see no reason why<br/>\nwe shouldn&#39;t have a HP drain spell and a shielding spell. And have a<br/>\nnew drain spell every circle after that, especially since i have yet to<br/>\nhear any success with Vampiric Embrace actually working the way it<br/>\nsupposed to.<br/>\nAnd if Necros get gate at level 5, giving it to us at level 22 or so,<br/>\nisnt too much to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome may say that Paladins spells are lame too, so why am i<br/>\ncomplaining? Well, lets get back to the fact that our damage spells are<br/>\nresisted by most of the creatures that we&#39;ll be fighting. I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve Paladins have this problem with their healing and buffing<br/>\nspells. So we should have more useful and effective spells to<br/>\ncompensate for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts not my intention to make SKs all powerful or equal to Necromancers<br/>\nin casting abilities, but I do feel we are not equal, as we should be,<br/>\noverall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fighting abilties, I have yet to find a reason to complain. We<br/>\neventually get all the main features of fighters except Kick and<br/>\nDuel-Wield. I have no problem waiting for them as long as I do get<br/>\nthem. We can wear any type of armor and use any type of weapon except<br/>\nfor a very few.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow let me state that I do indeed like being a SK, i like being evil,<br/>\ndoing evil quests and not having to be nice all the time. And I fully<br/>\naccept being hated by NPCs and occasionally KoS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have already submitted a Feedback Form via Sony Station and I know<br/>\nothers have as well. But it seems a bigger kick in the butt is needed<br/>\nto get the Dev team to notice this. I would like to stage a massive<br/>\nwrite in by SKs of all races and levels on all servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am open to suggestions on when and how this should be done. Whether<br/>\nit would be more effective while on-line, using the /feedback command<br/>\non a Friday or Sat. night getting as many SKs on-line to do it as<br/>\npossible or just getting as many as possible at their convenience to<br/>\nsubmit thru Sony Station&#39;s Feedback Form.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis ended up being way longer than i originally thought, and i&#39;m sorry<br/>\nif i bored you,but these are issues that I feel are important and after<br/>\nspeaking with many other SKs, i know i&#39;m not alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny feedback or suggestions are welcome, whether they agree with my<br/>\nopinions or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks For Hanging in there,<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
