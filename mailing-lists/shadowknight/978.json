I thought it would take forever to go from glower up<br/>\nto amiable killing Brothers Chintle,Estle, and Drash.  Then a friend<br/>\noffered a suggestion from her work on the Stein of Moggok:  the <br/>\nkoalindl fish gives bloodsaber faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was level 31 (not a good time to die), and bored of killing the<br/>\nMillers and guards, so I got a bind in Surefall, and headed to <br/>\nQeynos under a cloak of shadows.  Remember, Clerics and Paladins <br/>\ncannot see invis, so I safely snuck into their temple and to the<br/>\npond where the protected fish are.  Once their, stay by the stairs<br/>\ninto the water, and pull them with a spell.  It will take about<br/>\n3-5 fish to max your faction.  Also, the guards will not come to the<br/>\nwater, so you will be safe until you decide to leave (when you no<br/>\nlonger get faction messages).  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou should have seen the look on the newbies faces when a dark elf<br/>\nwas killing their fish.  One told me &quot;Don&#39;t do that!  You&#39;ll be KOS!&quot;<br/>\nI said &quot;Really?&quot; and pretended to be concerned.  Another offered help<br/>\ngetting out, which I declined.  He then asked for money... *sighs*<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, just bored at work and offering a tip.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
