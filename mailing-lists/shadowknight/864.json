I am now working on tracking down the militia<br/>\nguy Sir something, but as a DE, my passage through Freeport is both<br/>\nlimited and dangerous (just how I like it).  I was looking for a hint<br/>\nto his location, and wondering about his faction (I&#39;m KOS to the<br/>\nmilitia, but amiable to the SK guild).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, I killed Dyllin a long time ago, and looking in my<br/>\nbank found the Bayle List II.  I gave it to the guy who sends you<br/>\nafter Sir what&#39;s his name, and he said &quot;Whatever.&quot;  Now I&#39;m trying<br/>\nto do the whole quest to see who I should give it to.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my speculation...  I have done all the Neriak SK quests (<br/>\nexcept the courier duties), and some of the Grobb/Oggok ones with<br/>\nother chars.  If a quest sword ala Soulfire is in the game, I think<br/>\nit must stem from the human guilds, or some other source.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nnoticed too many of the Freeport SK quests tie in with the Soulfire<br/>\nquest, but with opposing goals.  I just thought it would be ironic<br/>\nif in our quest for a sword we would thwart the paladins.  Anybody<br/>\nelse notice this?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, has anyone ever got a cyclops eye as loot?  I&#39;ve<br/>\nkilled Broon, and maybe Droon too, as well as several cyclopses,<br/>\nand never once received one.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith T&#39;Vyn<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
