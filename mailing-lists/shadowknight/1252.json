Long time no write...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok first of all, had a very productive weekend, my guild and I held the Frog<br/>\n&gt; King room for most of Sunday. Damn that little froggie is tough, once you<br/>\n&gt; break the spawn up though it gets fairly easy. Picked up the crown on the<br/>\n&gt; first spawn, but he only spawned one more time in an 8 hour period (another<br/>\n&gt; crown) so I didn&#39;t get the Mith 2h I was hoping on. Oh well there is always<br/>\n&gt; next weekend. Oh while I was in Guk I finally picked up a Serp Bracer, and<br/>\n&gt; now I can&#39;t decide if I would rather do the Ac route or higher AGI/DEX. Any<br/>\n&gt; thoughts on this one? (BTW as of now with one Serp Bracer my DEX is 120 and<br/>\n&gt; AGI is 117 AC is hovering around 700)..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok now for the main question, I still have a little ways to go until lvl 50<br/>\n&gt; and the Life Leech quest, but I wanted to get a start on it early. Do you<br/>\n&gt; all think it would be better for me to have a lvl 50 guild mate pick up all<br/>\n&gt; the items needed for the quest (he would go along with me, not do it for me)<br/>\n&gt; or should I still get all the pieces myself and just wait till 50 to turn<br/>\n&gt; them in?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh one last thing, anybody know why the Live side of Guk doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt; have nearly as many people on it as the dead side. Over this weekend Guk was<br/>\n&gt; hovering around 80 ppl and the dead side was packed (you could literally<br/>\n&gt; walk around without fear of getting attack), but there was virtually no body<br/>\n&gt; on the live side (Noble I think was the only mob camped)..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other than that, enjoy folks...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thom<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
