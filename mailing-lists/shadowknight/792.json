What if<br/>\n&gt; Shadow Step and Voice Graft were replaced with some<br/>\n&gt; kind of lifetap spells?  Would<br/>\n&gt; this be grossly unbalancing or hurt the class?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If we tune the SK we can&#39;t really ADD new spells,<br/>\n&gt; since this would give them more spells than the<br/>\n&gt; other hybrids at each rank.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Brian<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have to agree with the Shadow Step being left alone.<br/>\nGreat escape/dueling spell. <br/>\n<br/>\nVoice Graft? Need anyone say more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was practicing my Evoke  one day, casting Ward<br/>\nUndead on my pet. Out of shear boredom, i cast Voice<br/>\nGraft. A level 50 Paladins walks by, and thru my pet i<br/>\ngive him a how-do-ya-do.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe stops and laughs and says to me &quot;that another one<br/>\nof those useless SK spells?&quot; I say &quot;Yup, its my reward<br/>\nfor working my butt off to reach level 30&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe laughs again and runs off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone claims Voice Graft has RP value? Ummm...if you<br/>\nsay so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt needs to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, like others, fear the Lifetaps we would get. Most<br/>\nlikely it would take too much time/mana to be bothered<br/>\nwith in combat.<br/>\nIf we got a GOOD lifedrain. Fine. But i am very<br/>\nskeptical.<br/>\n<br/>\n I would rather have it replaced with another utility<br/>\nspell such as Cure Disease. Just like Necros, whatever<br/>\nwe call up, we should be able to put down. We can<br/>\nDisease something, we should be able to get rid of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThats just a suggestion that has more of a chance of<br/>\ngoing thru as opposed to Lifedrain that would actually<br/>\nhelp us. As mentioned, whichever lifedrain they give<br/>\nus would most likely be too low of one to be really<br/>\nuseful.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamage shield like Banshee would have been great. <br/>\nA boost to VE would make sense. I stand by VE, even in<br/>\nits current state. No you cant rely on it to heal you,<br/>\nbut it is a great in-combat spell. Damages and heals<br/>\nsome in addition to your swing. Its free basically<br/>\ndamage/heal. Cast before a fight, so no in battle time<br/>\nwasted. And when it hits, its guaranteed. No<br/>\nvariation. At level 34, when it hits, its for<br/>\n18DMG/Heal everytime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
