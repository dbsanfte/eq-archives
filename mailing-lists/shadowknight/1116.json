The part of him going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Aggro on anyone instead of just the one who was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fighting a Najena Inhabitant?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bug, but it does make it DAMN hard to get to<br/>\n&gt; the UK and<br/>\n&gt; have a decent conversation with him. The way Beld did it was he<br/>\n&gt; met up with<br/>\n&gt; one of my guild&#39;s clerics (Ternada) and after they cleared the necros, the<br/>\n&gt; cleric put a soothe-type spell (don&#39;t remember the cleric<br/>\n&gt; version&#39;s name) on<br/>\n&gt; the UK and then Beld talked to him. Also, consider bringing along an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter to mes the necros and/or mindwipe the UK after you kill the<br/>\n&gt; necros.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t feel it should be this hard to get to our quest giver, let alone<br/>\n&gt; have him attack US. Anyway, /feedback or /petition it, I dunno.<br/>\n&gt; You CAN talk<br/>\n&gt; to the UK, but you definitely need some help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dravith Vandre&#39;i<br/>\n&gt; 45 Dark Elven SK<br/>\n&gt; Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
