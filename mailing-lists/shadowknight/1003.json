I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; hoping I can get on late tonight and have no one else around..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the faction side, I also stopped in High Keep looking for Leyna(sp?), not<br/>\n&gt; to be found.. And I realized that it takes a hell of a lot of bards to get<br/>\n&gt; your faction increased. (That plus their are on a 20min respawn makes it<br/>\n&gt; annoying as hell). Now the million dollar question, do you actually need MM<br/>\n&gt; faction to do the quest, plus I&#39;ve heard rumors that there are only 4 SK<br/>\n&gt; armor pieces (compared to 7 for the other classes) can anybody confirm this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The quest giver is a neutral faction, but it is convenient to have<br/>\ngood faction to get to him.
