I&#39;m not sure why a human SK would have any tougher of a time than say a human paladin as their stats are almost identical.  I&#39;m under the impression that DE&#39;s and Humans have a tougher time in melee than the big races (because of inherent STR/STA and Slam), but not to the point of not making them a viable class.  I also tend to think exp penalties even this out a lot.  The penalty on the TSK is HUGE (to the point where I&#39;ve about given up on this character).  I&#39;m in the 20&#39;s now and it takes me WEEKS of real time to level (partly due to the constant KoS problems which causes at least 4 deaths per level).  That&#39;s why I&#39;m moving on the experiment with other character classes and races.  If it takes me 3 weeks now to level in the 20&#39;s, what will it be like at 40?  I&#39;m convinced if I was playing a human I would at least be 25th by now, if not higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg Wraithbone (22nd level TSK)<br/>\nsemi-retired<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; One problem that SKs face -- and one of the reasons that they are so <br/>\n </span></blockquote>difficult to play -- is that they were tuned on the assumption <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that you would be playing an Ogre or Troll.

At least they don&#39;t have the staggering exp penalty that dark <br/>\nelves do.
