Anything that allows me to strike<br/>\n&gt; even one more time each minute is worth it. Especially with Double Attack.<br/>\n&gt; But that is symantics and I do not want a &quot;word war&quot; over it. :-)<br/>\n&gt; I agree that raw AC comes first. Strength has more impact after 20.<br/>\nAgility<br/>\n&gt; is up in the air for me. Not quite sure what effect it has.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What armor under Darkforge and Planes armor is best for an SK? I am<br/>\nworking<br/>\n&gt; on getting some bronze armor, and not blackened because of the lower AC.<br/>\n&gt; What is better than bronze and what would I expect to pay for it?
