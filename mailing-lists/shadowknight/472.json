I started myself a dark elven SK, this<br/>\non the heals of my now-retired 31 dark elven warrior. I&#39;m level 13 with the<br/>\nSK now, and loving it. I don&#39;t know that much about the life of an SK, so if<br/>\nyou&#39;d like to describe your own SK and/or tactics, I&#39;d love to hear it. This<br/>\nmay not answer your question, but it may get the list moving again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDravith Vandre&#39;i<br/>\nDark Elven Shadowknight (13)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYeah I also play a dark elven SK, and as one there are a few things I&#39;ve<br/>\nnoticed that are useful as a dark elf, especially since most think that DE<br/>\nSK isn&#39;t such a good choice. Yep it&#39;s hard, but it has some real payoffs.<br/>\nThe high INT keeps your skills raising like crazy even into the 100&#39;s as I&#39;m<br/>\nexperiencing now, and allows you to do more creative things with your mana,<br/>\nlike back off out of a fight when soloing and let your pet beat on the<br/>\nmonster to finish it, with you healing it with mend bones (15) with all that<br/>\nextra mana you&#39;ve got. Since a dark elf SK can&#39;t have too high STR<br/>\n(especially if you distruibuted points to other things like STA and DEX),<br/>\nitem-wise you&#39;ll want to try to get things that raise STR. You can use<br/>\neither 2-hand or 1-hand weapons, 1 handers are useful because having a<br/>\nshield ups your AC,adds to your parry rate (17),  gives you the ability to<br/>\nbash, and may also have some useful attributes to it (like the darkwood<br/>\nraising STR by 9, or the chitin shell raising poison resist by 10). If you<br/>\nuse a 2-hander, then you&#39;ll get great damage, it just isn&#39;t as ideal as a<br/>\ntroll or ogre tho because of their ability to slam (bash without shield).<br/>\nAside from this, you might also listen to what Beld said about being careful<br/>\nwith HT etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck, Phantasaic Voidstone, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nONElist has 180,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
