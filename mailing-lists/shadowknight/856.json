At that time i didnt have a clue as to<br/>\nwhat the quest was for.<br/>\nWhen i asked grimrot about Arlena (which was the the<br/>\nkeyword he gave me when i turned the skull) he told me<br/>\nabout Arlena who he created, but she took off while he<br/>\nwas away. He suspected that she headed back to her<br/>\nhome which was Mistmoore. He askes that you track her<br/>\ndown and bring back her bones. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, some how, some way someone thought to bring back<br/>\na lute from a named gypsy (not Arlena) to grimrot.<br/>\nI have no idea where they got that info from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have talked to Grimrot a few times after that, and<br/>\nhe has always me for her remains.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know people who have extensivly traveled Mistmoore,<br/>\nand no Arlena is to be found.<br/>\nThere are various gypsies, vampyres and so forth. But<br/>\nno one named Arlena.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither she never existed, or Verant hid her under<br/>\nanother name.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else,forgot name, found out the lute part.<br/>\nAgain, i have no idea where that came from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have yet to actually venture into Mistmoore myself. <br/>\nGetting stuck on that wretched continent with those<br/>\nputrid High Elves and dirtmongering Dwarves is not my<br/>\nidea of a good time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to see what my faction is before i go in<br/>\nthere. I made the mistake in Najena by just going in<br/>\nthere and killing stuff, when my faction was Dubious<br/>\nwith all but the undead. I think i may try to get in<br/>\nthere and talk with NPCs before i start trying to kill<br/>\nthem. Never know what i may uncover :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, i had more to write, its time to go home and<br/>\nactually play :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBye<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a weird question just popped into my head :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; it was YOU who found the EBW thru the grimrot quest,<br/>\n&gt; right bathory?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; well.. have you tried doing the grimrot quest since<br/>\n&gt; somebody said that the<br/>\n&gt; EBW was obtained via the the avenging caitiff in MM<br/>\n&gt; (which makes it damn<br/>\n&gt; near impossible for us to get one now ;p)? who<br/>\n&gt; knows.. there may be TWO ways<br/>\n&gt; to get this weapon.. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Beld Demonblade<br/>\n&gt; Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Share your special moments with family and friends-<br/>\n&gt; send PHOTO Greetings<br/>\n&gt; at Zing.com!
