I <br/>\nplan on investing quite a bit in this character, but <br/>\nwant to know how to get food/water/weapons etc. <br/>\nfrom &quot;good&quot; cities. The underground in Freeport doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave any food vendors that I know of, nor does the Shady <br/>\nSwashbuckler in the N.Ro tunnel to East Commons. <br/>\nIn Neriak I am &quot;looks at you dubiously&quot; but not KOS, and <br/>\nI think I am KOS in Ogre-ville (I chose to worship Cazic <br/>\nThule). So that limits me to Grobb, RO and Commons, and <br/>\nNeriak.<br/>\nI won&#39;t even think of going to Faydwer for a long time. <br/>\nDoes the NPC merchant tents in South RO sell to Evil <br/>\nrace characters? I have seen it on a map of South Ro, <br/>\nbut haven&#39;t actually been out of Innuthule Swamp yet. My <br/>\nwife did as her Troll, but hated playing it.<br/>\nAnother thing that worries me is that the Combine <br/>\nWeapons sold by gypsies are not an option for a solo <br/>\nplayer unless I get one at auction (which I am forced <br/>\ninto due to masive lag :( ) since they KOS me as well.<br/>\nI enjoy the Troll, but need help to figure out a way <br/>\naround these major milestones.<br/>\nAny and all help is welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik<br/>\n4ht Rank Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
