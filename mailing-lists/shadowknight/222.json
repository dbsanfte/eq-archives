I once duelled a monk who was a lvl higher then me and I wiped the floor with hmi. I lost one bub while he had lost 3 when we both turned to kill something that was passing by. This was when I was lvl 8 (he was lvl 9) and I didn&#39;t even have any spells yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nInos<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. I also challenge a lvl 18 wizard to a duel when I was lvl 15 and he refused.
