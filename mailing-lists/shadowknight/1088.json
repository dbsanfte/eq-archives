Being <br/>\nable to use all my mana for more than half my hit points at level 33<br/>\nis not a bad thing in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how you can complain about this.  Sure, we could probably<br/>\npick out better spells, but this is definately an improvement.  If<br/>\nI&#39;m soloing, I can use these to half my downtime, or as a healing<br/>\nboost once a mob is snared and running (in place) at the end of a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my math on this for my Level 33 DE SK:<br/>\nHP:  845<br/>\nMana:  700<br/>\nLifeDraw:  45 Hps for 63 Mana<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I can cast 11 lifedraws at FM, which is 495 HP.  Granted, <br/>\nthat&#39;s an ideal scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that not enough healing for a damage oriented class?<br/>\nNo hybrid will get bind or gate, so what other rank 1,2, and 4 spells <br/>\ncould they have given us?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes down to it, I have an option I never had before, and<br/>\nthat I cannot complain about.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
