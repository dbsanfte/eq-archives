If you&#39;re a rogue, it <br/>\ntells you if you suceed or not, but as an SK it doesn&#39;t tell me if it worked <br/>\nor not (unless I do cons (only way I can verify)).<br/>\n<br/>\nWas this a bug or oversight?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a question for Brian, if you still read this.  A few patches ago, they <br/>\nsaid they implimented something to see your skills and max skill level, but <br/>\nthat function never worked.  Any word on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nXaera.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
