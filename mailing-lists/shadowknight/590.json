Always nice to have good<br/>\ndays, because with an SK you&#39;ll have plenty of bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; New Thread<br/>\n&gt; I was in Neriak when I hit 9th, and the DE guild would<br/>\n&gt; not train me cause I play a troll. grrr.  I went back to<br/>\n&gt; Grobb and trained my magic abilities and my 1H Slash to<br/>\n&gt; keep it up a bit.  Then I bought all the 1st Rank<br/>\n&gt; spells. All righty then! kewl.  I zone to the swamp and<br/>\n&gt; cast my first pet. NOT!!!!<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Insufficiant mana to cast this spell.&quot; WTF!!! Try<br/>\n&gt; again. Same thing. Mana cost: 40.  Hmmm.  Dam.  No big<br/>\n&gt; deal really. Me not use one before. Is ok.<br/>\n&gt; Next spell.<br/>\n&gt; Invis to Undead. &quot;Insufficiant mana to cast this spell.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Crap! Mana cost: 40.<br/>\n&gt; Great. The spell that makes a SK visible as a SK (pet) I<br/>\n&gt; am too stupid (Int of 62) to cast!  And the spell that<br/>\n&gt; will keep annoying green skele from attacking me I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; cast either.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is one of the nice things about the DE SK&#39;s.  I had no<br/>\nprob summoning my pet at level 9 unless I fizzled (that was<br/>\nbefore they turned down fizzle mana).  You&#39;ll be able to at <br/>\nlevel 10.  My INT was the default DE (I think), 109.  I<br/>\nthrough down spells like crazy, basically darknessing every<br/>\nopponent I fight (funny when they start to run and just turn<br/>\naround).  Can&#39;t wait for level 30:  Heat Blood, Invis, and<br/>\nFeign Death!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to +INT items, at your level you&#39;d be better off with +mana<br/>\nitems, but the time will come when that will change.  I have<br/>\na silver sapphire necklace right now (4 STR / 4 INT)  A great<br/>\nnecklace for SK&#39;s, but it&#39;ll cost you 150-250pp depending on<br/>\nteh jeweler.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith T&#39;Vyn<br/>\n27th SK on Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
