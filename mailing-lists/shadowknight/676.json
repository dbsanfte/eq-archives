The BBC <br/>\nhas a harsh AGI hit, but it a weapon that is accesable to players that want <br/>\nto loot it.  Buying a combine 2h sword is expensive and usually you can get <br/>\nyour friends to help you just get the BBC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Dark Reaver you do need a full party of 39 / 40 types if you want <br/>\nto get it, and it&#39;s a rare drop at that.  You can find it on the market if <br/>\nyou like.  But you&#39;re looking to pay somewhere between 1500 and 3000pp.  To <br/>\nsome people that might seem like a lot of money, but since a lot of people <br/>\nhave started second characters the AGE of twinking has begun.  I ran into a <br/>\nlevel 7 SK with full plate and a Dark Reaver yesterday. heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously though, getting the BIBS is a lot easier then the GZ.  Karg is too <br/>\nhard to find, and generally doesn&#39;t stay alive when you do find him.  As an <br/>\nSK it&#39;s hard to loot a lot of items because it takes forever to get <br/>\nanywhere.  When I wanted to get a BiBs for my Shadowknight I just sent my <br/>\nwizard to camp it instead (being honest).  Why would I want to have to run <br/>\nfrom Nek, ec, nro, oasis, sro, innothle, feerot, rathe mount, lake rathe, <br/>\nsk, nk, ek, beholder to runny to camp for such an item?  I could take a <br/>\nchance to invis through rivervale but that would REALLY hurt if that wore <br/>\noff, or some PC casted a spell on me that took off invis.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, why does our Vampiric Embrace do WAY less then a Necro&#39;s?  <br/>\nSame spell should do same damage.  It&#39;s our ONLY way to get any HP back and <br/>\nit&#39;s in battle.  Rangers, Paladains can heal fine, and they&#39;re based on <br/>\nDruids and Clerics.  We&#39;re based on Necros and can&#39;t even do a simple life <br/>\ntap.  Food for thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrincess Xaera<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brian Hook&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;ve played an SK before....some of you may remember me from WAY back <br/>\nin the day when I was Vrathus on Cazic-Thule, but I only<br/>\ngot to 11th before deciding that being KOS was just not worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, your weapon descriptions lead me to think that you are buying <br/>\nweapons at those levels, since it is my understanding that<br/>\na GZ isn&#39;t exactly easy to come by until about 35th level (with a group) and <br/>\nyou have it listed as a 21-30 weapon.  Also, Dark<br/>\nReavers are located in a very, very dangerous place, and I would imagine it <br/>\ntakes a party of low-40s to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is my view of things really skewed?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that the BBC is pretty much valueless -- seems that you can get <br/>\nby with a Combine 2HS or SBH until you hit the level<br/>\nnecessary for BIBS.  Is there any real demand for the BBC?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried looking at the various Web pages for info on the SK quests, but <br/>\nthey are sorted by zone, and it is much more interesting<br/>\nto me to see quests by class/race.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also interested in finding faction breakdowns, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family Program<br/>\nWIN $100 to Amazon.com!
