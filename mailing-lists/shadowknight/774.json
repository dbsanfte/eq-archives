One of the first times<br/>\nI attacked a HG I accidentally hit HT (moved the button since then) right at<br/>\nthe start of combat, needless to say not only was it fully resisted but it<br/>\nreally pissed him off and he stepped on me (I was lvl 30 btw). The next time<br/>\nI engaged a HG (still lvl 30) I hit HT just as we were all about to zone (us<br/>\nall down to the last bubble but so was he). This time it went off for full<br/>\ndamage (very red HG btw), allowing us to finish him off (actually that plus<br/>\nmy Heat Blood finished him anyway). I have to totally agree with what Beld<br/>\nsaid about HT (if you haven&#39;t read it you really need to). When used in the<br/>\nmethod that he states it is a very effective last save..<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 17, 1999 2:19 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Shadowknight@onelist.com\">Shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [shadowknight] Another suggestion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOk, here are me 2 PP...<br/>\nThe damage done on HT is a little low.  I agree that if <br/>\nyou get a full group of high level SKs together that pop <br/>\nHT all at once there could be abuse.  HOWEVER, most SKs <br/>\ndon&#39;t use HT offensively and there aren&#39;t that man that <br/>\ngroup together (at my level anyway). Most use it as a <br/>\nlast ditch effort to save their ass.  I was one of those <br/>\nuntil Mr. Beld gave me advise that changed how I look at <br/>\nSKs. This stems from the fact that at low level you are <br/>\nparanoid about not having HT ready to use. Most don&#39;t  <br/>\nout grow that view. Also, getting that many SKs focused <br/>\non one MOB is death for that MOB anyway. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say increasing the amount of damage to 15*level <br/>\nis a reasonable increase. This is because most times you <br/>\nwill not be attacking 1 MOB, but several. The overall <br/>\neffect of 1 MOB dying will not overbalance the <br/>\nsituation. It may allow you to win, and if you die, you <br/>\nwon&#39;t get the XP from killing the HTed MOB anyway. It <br/>\nwill help a solo SK tremendously (heh).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn resisted HT...<br/>\nIn a group against a RED MOB that is 3/4 or better <br/>\nhealth my HT is resisted alot so that instead ot 141 HP <br/>\nit does 36 (ak!).  On the same level MOB that is at 1/2 <br/>\nto 3/4 health the damage increases and the number of <br/>\nresists went down as well.  Same level MOB at 1/2 or <br/>\nless had no resists and full damage every time.  I had <br/>\nseveral very patient groups that helped me with this <br/>\nover the last few days.  I did this to see exactly what <br/>\ntactics would work best for me to use it in.<br/>\nThis tells me that to start combat with HT against a <br/>\nhigher MOB is a waste.  Strategic use in group is best.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBrian,<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say giving SKs Lifetap and/or other spells would <br/>\nmake SKs into tank Mages.  In effect, we are just as <br/>\nPaladins are tank Clerics. This is not such a big issue <br/>\nbecause clerics are not as limited as mage classes <br/>\nequipment and ability wise, so to transfer the abilities <br/>\nto a Paladin is not adding too much that a cleric <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t already do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not ty this instead... make the SK into an Anti-<br/>\nPaladin (which we are supposed to be really).  Reverse <br/>\nall cleric spells that heal for a Paladin and give that <br/>\nto an SK as DD along with all the buffs that a Paladin <br/>\nnormally gets. After all we are not healers, but we are <br/>\nthe strong arm of evil and are to protect our kind with <br/>\nthe gifts of our dark gods.<br/>\nHeh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a bit tired, so flame on!<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
