When I hit, I do Bash for 1 <br/>\npoint.  I have never seen the skill incease for Slam or <br/>\nBash.  Is this because I cannot officially get the Bash <br/>\nskill til later levels and have not trained in it? Is <br/>\nthat at 10th? I&#39;m at work and don&#39;t have my books. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGrobb Cleaver Quest:<br/>\nWhat level is the Troll Nerbilik in OOT? Is the recipe <br/>\nhe drops a lore/no drop item?  Is the HEHE meat lore/no <br/>\ndrop?  I know the chef will kill me so i was planning on <br/>\neither making a mule ogre or paying someone to get it <br/>\nfor me.<br/>\nAfter getting into Freeport via the tunnels to catch the <br/>\nboat for OOT will the guards on the pier KoS me? Are all <br/>\nTrolls Kos in freeport regardless of religion?  Will <br/>\nkilling Orcs in North Ro increase my faction with the <br/>\nFreeport Militia or will I need to kill green Deathfists <br/>\nin the Freeport newbie zone? Will I ever kill enough to <br/>\nlet me not be KoS as an SK of Thule?<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\nLots of questions, but I prefer not to die alot and not <br/>\nbe able to get my corpse back. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik <br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n9th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
