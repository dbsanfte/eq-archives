You get Engulfing Darkness, an upgrade of Clinging<br/>\nDarkness. Whereas CD does 20hp over 30 seconds, ED does 90hp over 60<br/>\nseconds, a big difference. Plus you get Vampiric Embrace, which some say is<br/>\nalmost useless, but it goes off more and more depending on your Dex and your<br/>\nlevel (not to mention sucking more damage). Level 22 spells also include<br/>\nsome more Vs Undead type spells, making Unrest a lot easier (i.e., go get<br/>\nsome small bronze now if you haven&#39;t already).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One last question... Which is better using a 2H Slashing weapon our using<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1H Slashing Weapon with bash?  Hehe, and don&#39;t tell me it depends on the<br/>\n&gt; weapon... my question is overall.... Just wondering because if 2H Slashing<br/>\n&gt; is better then I&#39;ll have to start lvling it up..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I used 2HS for a long time (first 24 lvls as an SK, and all 31 lvls of my<br/>\nwarrior before that) and it was a big decision but I decided to go to 1HS. I<br/>\nnow use a demon claw and a chitin shield. With our dark elven agility, I<br/>\nsqueeze another 23 AC outta that 15 AC shield, not to mention the<br/>\nbash-then-cast strategy helps get a LOT more spells off. If you&#39;re gonna be<br/>\nsolo&#39;ing, use the shield and 1hs, because you&#39;re fights will take longer but<br/>\nyou&#39;ll end up less hurt. In a group, go for outright damage dealing with a<br/>\ngood 2H sword. You&#39;ll have heals and backup, so just concentrate on kicking<br/>\nass, rather than hiding behind a shield. As a side note, VE does seem to go<br/>\noff significantly more often with a demon claw than with a zweihander (not<br/>\nsure it makes up for the damage difference though).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks Brothers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Arikor<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not a problem, happy to see another SK.<br/>\n<br/>\nDravith Vandre&#39;i<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
