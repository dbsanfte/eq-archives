Sure if a few SKs<br/>\ngot together and HT&#39;d a Griffon to death quick and easy, they would get<br/>\ngood exp. But that would be it for another hour and a half. If thats<br/>\nwhat they want to do with their HT instead of keeping it for an<br/>\nemergency where HT is the only thing that&#39;ll save them, thats up to the<br/>\nindividuals involved. Its not like they&#39;ll be able to walk around and<br/>\nHT everything to death right after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as for LoH getting interrupted, i have heard this about HT,<br/>\nalthough its never happened to me. <br/>\nI would like to hear from any SK on this.<br/>\nIf this is true, then we&#39;re back to square one. LoH 1000 healing, HT<br/>\n500dmg, but resisted by the creatures you would actually use it<br/>\nagainst.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we all know that a toning down of LoH just isn&#39;t going to happen.<br/>\nWe could campaign the rest of our lives and it&#39;ll never even be<br/>\nconsidered. <br/>\nSo what&#39;s left? <br/>\nTweak HT. <br/>\nHT is only powerful WHEN it works. Which seems to be less and less as<br/>\nwe gain higher levels and fight bigger creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd i still feel that it should work every time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut aside from our differences of opinion, i would like to hear what<br/>\nyou think would be a good way to get the Dev team&#39;s attention with our<br/>\nvarious concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking about these topics on message boards and mailing lists is OK,<br/>\nbut this wont accomplish anything as far as the game is concerned.<br/>\nLets do that pro-active thing i hear so much about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for responding,<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i completely agree, i would personally like to sit<br/>\n&gt; down with the game<br/>\n&gt; balance programmers and get THEIR explainations of<br/>\n&gt; how paladins and SK are<br/>\n&gt; evenly matched. however, i think i can understand a<br/>\n&gt; few possible reasons why<br/>\n&gt; things are as they are:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ok, so at lvl 9 a paladin could probably beat up a<br/>\n&gt; lvl 9 sk good, on account<br/>\n&gt; of the paladin has 3 times normal hp (due to all the<br/>\n&gt; healing), whereas we<br/>\n&gt; get a spell that bites him for 5 damage and suck<br/>\n&gt; away some of his str. but<br/>\n&gt; eventually i think we accelerate in power faster<br/>\n&gt; than paladins.. by the time<br/>\n&gt; we get to lvl 50 in our best equipment, we would be<br/>\n&gt; fully capable of beating<br/>\n&gt; the snot out of a lvl 50 paladin in his best<br/>\n&gt; equipment. (also, we dont have<br/>\n&gt; to kill the lava dragon for a darkreaver ;)) upon<br/>\n&gt; checking back to the guild<br/>\n&gt; periodically i have seen a great many necro spells<br/>\n&gt; being imped for SK use at<br/>\n&gt; high level, including some of the powerful DOT<br/>\n&gt; spells, spirit armor, and<br/>\n&gt; expulse undead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; also, while i admit that HT vs lay on hands isnt<br/>\n&gt; very fair, remember that HT<br/>\n&gt; IS rather powerful. most melee combat classes cant<br/>\n&gt; boast the ability to<br/>\n&gt; knock off a third or a half of their target&#39;s life<br/>\n&gt; with a single attack and<br/>\n&gt; still be able to go ahead and wail away with nasty<br/>\n&gt; implements of pointy<br/>\n&gt; death. my suggestion is not to boost HT, but to TONE<br/>\n&gt; DOWN lay on hands. the<br/>\n&gt; ability to heal that much is just not reasonable;<br/>\n&gt; altho i have heard of<br/>\n&gt; people having lay on hands interrupted, while it is<br/>\n&gt; not possible to<br/>\n&gt; interrupt HT that i have seen, it being<br/>\n&gt; instantaneous. can anyone confirm<br/>\n&gt; the possibility of lay on hands to be interrupted?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; there is a very good reason why HT can be resisted:<br/>\n&gt; imagine about 20 lvl 10<br/>\n&gt; sk all charge a griffin and simultaneously lay a<br/>\n&gt; harm touch on it, causing<br/>\n&gt; it to die instantly. now somebody is going to get a<br/>\n&gt; crapload of xp out of<br/>\n&gt; that, and it&#39;d be a hideously unfair trick for us.<br/>\n&gt; even more lame than the<br/>\n&gt; little bard accelerando-run in circles-bellow thing!<br/>\n&gt; i admit i become quite<br/>\n&gt; annoyed seeing HT resisted or soaked altogether, but<br/>\n&gt; i try very hard not to<br/>\n&gt; fight things that are guaranteed to resist it when<br/>\n&gt; it can be helped anyway :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; now, if only they will figure out why we and<br/>\n&gt; paladins cant hit worth a damn,<br/>\n&gt; i think both classes are fully toe to toe with most<br/>\n&gt; other classes for the<br/>\n&gt; better part of the game. i still think it&#39;d be a bad<br/>\n&gt; idea to duel a lvl 50<br/>\n&gt; wizard with an SK, but the again, who COULD? :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Beld Demonblade &lt;- just named! :D<br/>\n&gt; Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community<br/>\n&gt; service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
