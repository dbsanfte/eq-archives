Question: I am currently playing a DE Necromancer","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-193826676\">Well, this is my first time posting on a mailing list, and I&#39;m not sure of the protocol here,but here goes. Question: I am currently playing a DE Necromancer on Rallos Zek, and have become increasingly interested in trying out a Shadow Knight. I have a secondary character who is a Ranger, so I know about the Warrior-type of combat. Both chars are a goodly level, so I&#39;m fairly experienced at EQ, but I have not explored greatly. Anyways, I have never tried an SK, and I&#39;m dying to know the answers to some questions before I start. They are as follows:<br/>\n1: While I am quite familiar with the fact that all Race/Class combos are pretty much balanced, its an unaviodable fact that some races have an edge on some classes. The SK seems to be an extreme in that regard, IMHO. In any event, I was wondering if anyone could tell me if Dark Elves are any good as Shadow Knights. I know they have high agi/int, which is good, and their low STR can be compensated for, but their lack of Slam seems to be a decided disadvantage, considering Shadowknights don&#39;t get dual wield, only Double Attack, and the fact that the SK special weapons are all (?) Two-Handed slashing. Info on this would be greatly appreciated. BTW: I have no interest in playing a Troll or Ogre. I hate their lands and I just don&#39;t think I could RP one. Add to that an EXP penalty on top of the 20-25% that Shads already have, and you have one really slowleveling character. So, I am also considering being Human to compensate for the penalty to exp,but again, no Slam, +poor nightvision, and no other interesting abilities, and manyzoned cities. Can anyone tell me if this is worth it? Finally on this subject, is Slam really a choice power, or is it just a nifty ability to have as an extra vs magi? <br/>\n<br/>\n2: Having previously stated my lack of experience in the Shadowknight class, and also that I have not been able to explore greatly, can anyone give me some info on hunting grounds? Such as: Area name, where it is, what to hunt/avoid, what level its good for, and special comments. I know some people will say &quot;Find out yourself!&quot; But I say to them that I have died too many times when starting a new class, and twice has it turned me away from a particular class, becuase I was so frustrated. So please, be nice. Post info! <br/>\n<br/>\n3: Equipment info and money info. On equipment, a list of where I could find some good equipment and what level I could attain it. On money, list of good ways to make money at certain levels if I am based in the Neriak/Freeport area. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this sounds like I&#39;m asking for a walkthrough of the Shadowknight. Maybe I am. I hope whomever reads this will respond. I&#39;m really interested in this class, and would like some information to help me jumpstart a character that will take a darn long time to mature. If you&#39;ve read this far, thanks for putting up with my ramblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopeful Shadowknight and current Necromancer,<br/>\nXashren</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
