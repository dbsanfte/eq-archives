How <br/>\nabout your stats, things like that could make a world of difference, for <br/>\nexample through all my experience with a shadowknight I found human SKs the <br/>\nweakest of all.  Dunno, why but it seems that way to me.   I believe that <br/>\ntroll is the best, but thats just a personal opinion.  Also, don&#39;t expect to <br/>\nbe the complete asskicker, you gotta have some understanding that maybe he <br/>\njust had some better spell, or was lucky.  Things like that make a huge <br/>\ndifference as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Adam Hill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adamthehill@...\">adamthehill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [shadowknight] get this<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 04 May 1999 00:09:18 PDT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Adam Hill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adamthehill@...\">adamthehill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Okay.. Imagine you duel a Druid one level higher than you. He flat beats <br/>\n&gt;yer ass.. harm touch does hack and his screaming macer is beatin yer ass <br/>\n&gt;while yer shiny brass halberd is doin 3 pts of damage. Silly..<br/>\n&gt;I have almost a full suit of bronze.. 17th lev.. Shint brass halb, Derv <br/>\n&gt;rings, spiked collar. I think that sk&#39;s ar HORRRIBLY dicked after this <br/>\n&gt;duel.. No only was it not close.. it was humiliating. Verant better do <br/>\n&gt;something or else shadowknights are gona die out. Especially when my HT <br/>\n&gt;does about 40pts at 17th level to an `18 level pc.<br/>\n&gt;i am Disgusted<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Krimzin<br/>\n&gt;]Tarew maar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
