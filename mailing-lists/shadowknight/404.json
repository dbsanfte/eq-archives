And he proceeded to smack the heck out of me until i finally<br/>\nzoned.<br/>\nNow i checked my target and it still said the wolf.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also noticed that when i cast fear on a creature and my pet is<br/>\nchasing it, when i fire an arrow, i dont get the hit/miss message. Its<br/>\nas if it was never reaching the target.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow heres my question,<br/>\nDo you need an unobstucted path for the arrow to hit?<br/>\nAnd if an NPC does get in the way, does it count as an attack, even<br/>\nthough they arent targeted?<br/>\n<br/>\nIm not complaining mind you. It actually makes sense. But i would like<br/>\nto know if this is the way it works so i can plan a strategy<br/>\naccordingly. Or was this just some weird fluke that could only happen<br/>\nto me?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
