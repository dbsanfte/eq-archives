(try sitting next to a guard in a town and<br/>\nhave him start barking orders at a newbie who walks by. call out to people<br/>\nby name and watch them scratch their heads in confusion :D).<br/>\n<br/>\nVE starts doing 12 damage at lvl 22, and the damage increases 1 point every<br/>\nother level. so at lvl 30 you are draining 16 life every time it hits, and<br/>\nby 50 you are draining 26 points. this doesnt sound like much.. but remember<br/>\nthis is in ADDITION to whatever damage you do with your weapon, and those<br/>\npoints can quickly bridge the disparity between 1h and 2h weapons, since it<br/>\nwill go off more often with 1h attacks. while it isnt the greatest spell in<br/>\nthe world, its the first practical buff we get, so go ahead and use it when<br/>\nyou get the opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeld Demonblade<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
