Many have tried this spell in everyway imaginable<br/>\n&gt; and no HP is transferred from the target to the caster. All it seems to<br/>\n&gt; do is raise your attack for about 20 seconds.<br/>\n&gt; **************<br/>\nVampiric touch sucks, got burnt on it myself, but you will get a lifetap<br/>\n*****************<br/>\n&gt; And as far as bashing and slamming. Thats Troll and Ogre specific.<br/>\n&gt; Human, Gnome, Dark Elf and Euridite SKs never get slam and need a<br/>\n&gt; shield to bash. But i personally dont see this as a problem.<br/>\n&gt; *********<br/>\nyup<br/>\n*********<br/>\n&gt; And anybody who can wield a halberd will do 24 dmg. Thats not SK only.<br/>\n&gt; **********<br/>\nand?<br/>\n*******<br/>\n&gt; The only things i feel could be improved is the Harm Touch should not<br/>\n&gt; be resisted and at level 15, start getting HP drain spells that<br/>\n&gt; actually work.<br/>\n&gt; And at level 30 we can use Voice Graft. YEEEHAAAA!!! I can see myself<br/>\n&gt; spending a couple plat on that one. This should definitely be replaced<br/>\n&gt; with Gate or something worthwhile.<br/>\n&gt; And Endure Cold and later Resist Cold dont make as much sense as having<br/>\n&gt; a universal shield spells.<br/>\n&gt; **************<br/>\nermm, sounds like you should try the necro...8)<br/>\n***********<br/>\nI still think SK are not underpowered at all, and are one of the best<br/>\nclasses in the game<br/>\nlifedrain for a warrior at level 15?..ermmm, guess that would make me and my<br/>\nwife no longer need that shaman,,,guess the healing classes would be<br/>\nunderpowered if the warrior classes start healing themselves..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\never played a mud where there where multiclass players? you know, where one<br/>\nguy could tank, heal and nuke? Well, theyre not too fun, and i think<br/>\ngrouping is where its at,<br/>\nall classes on eq got there quirks,  for sure, but i think the sk are tuff,<br/>\nand i think my necro is tuff...<br/>\nI am level 15, and she is level 13...and i wouldnt have her play any other<br/>\nclass....if i thought there was a better combo, id change now....<br/>\nShe did get level 13 in 9 days, level 7 in one nite...bout a 14 hour nite<br/>\nthough...<br/>\nmy response was to the guy that gave up the class, saying SK are not that<br/>\ngood...<br/>\nI have yet to hear or see anything to make me agree with him in the<br/>\nslightest..<br/>\nMorgul<br/>\n&gt; upgraded, i obviously wouldnt complain.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The comment was made by someone a while ago that these changes would<br/>\n&gt; make the game easy. I fail to see this. I too dont want an easy<br/>\n&gt; cakewalk of a game. But i would like my character to have equal skills<br/>\n&gt; to other classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bathory<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the<br/>\nWeek!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
