We&#39;ve spent much more time there and have<br/>\n&gt;killed less. But how many pieces of decaying do you<br/>\n&gt;think were dropped? one. 6 hours, 8 Crusaders one<br/>\n&gt;drop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But thats not even the best part. Now sit back and<br/>\n&gt;listen to my tale.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We are on our 3rd or 4th Crusader. KIll him. Loot.<br/>\n&gt;Nothing again. Damnit.<br/>\n&gt;Our rogue says &quot;I got it!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;ummm..you got what?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;rogue, &quot;a BP!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;WHAT!?!?!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;rogue, &quot;a decaying BP&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;much swearing and cursing ensues.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;its NO DROP&quot;<br/>\n&gt;rogue,&quot;oh, damnit&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;why do you think we were the only ones looting them?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;rogue,&quot;i didnt loot it. I pickpocketed it&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;WHAT!?!?!&quot; &quot;i thought rogues pickpocket from a<br/>\n&gt;different pool than the loot one&quot;<br/>\n&gt;rogue, &quot;different pool for cash, but not items. But<br/>\n&gt;those items are supposed to be inaccessible&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So now we have a rogue who pickpocketed our SK only NO<br/>\n&gt;DROP item.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My friend petitions. Rogue petitions.<br/>\n&gt;Both end up talking to a guide since no real GM is on.<br/>\n&gt;She &quot;can&#39;t&quot; do anything about it.<br/>\n&gt;The rogue puts up a good fight though.She does feel<br/>\n&gt;real bad about it. She goes thru how bad this<br/>\n&gt;knowledge would be if it got spread to the public.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Think about it. How many people would want rogues<br/>\n&gt;around at all if they thought they might pickpocket<br/>\n&gt;the quest items that they need?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The guide started to see the resoning. However still<br/>\n&gt;no BP for us. Even the suggestion of creating a<br/>\n&gt;dynamic character and letting one of us loot the BP<br/>\n&gt;from him wasnt accepted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And thats how we left it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3 or 4 Crusaders later with no decaying and both of us<br/>\n&gt;SKs were just too ticked to keep playing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The moral of the story..ummm..there isnt one i dont<br/>\n&gt;think..but do yourself a favor and make sure you tell<br/>\n&gt;any rigue you are grouped with to NOT pickpocket the<br/>\n&gt;Crusaders or you will be added a sequel to my little<br/>\n&gt;adventure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now let me say this. The BP isnt all that great and i<br/>\n&gt;wouldnt wear it anyway. But i would still like to do<br/>\n&gt;the quest if i happen to end up with the items.<br/>\n&gt;But more importantly, this could have just as easily<br/>\n&gt;been an item i needed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And i did a nice little FEEDBACK right before i logged<br/>\n&gt;letting &quot;them&quot; know how lame and pathetic this<br/>\n&gt;so-called &quot;quest&quot; is.<br/>\n&gt;And i dont consider this a quest. Sitting in CT<br/>\n&gt;waiting for the same MOB over and over is camping, not<br/>\n&gt;questing.<br/>\n&gt;There was obviously no thought process put into this<br/>\n&gt;at all.<br/>\n&gt;And has anyone found a weapon quest for SKs yet?<br/>\n&gt;Throughout the different sites i have noticed that<br/>\n&gt;quite a few classes have had weapon quests put in with<br/>\n&gt;the last patch. Just wondering if we got the same<br/>\n&gt;consideration *snicker*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway thats my rant for today.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Enjoy kiddies<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;=====<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
