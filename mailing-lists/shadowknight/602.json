If he is not moving <br/>\nor he is fleeing from you, the DoT does damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nIF we make this change live, and that&#39;s an IF at this <br/>\npoint, we will most likely also slightly increase the <br/>\ndurations of DoT spells to compensate for the additional <br/>\ntime necessary to cast the spells and then set up your <br/>\ndefense (you tanking, another player tanking, a pet <br/>\ntanking, etc). <br/>\n<br/>\n-Brad <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that this seems to have gone live already <br/>\nfrom reports (see article below). Supposedly this is <br/>\nmeant to be a kiting fix, meaning if you are fleeing <br/>\nfrom a monster it won&#39;t take damage but if the monster <br/>\nflees from you it will. The reports I have in so far <br/>\nbasically say if the monster is out of your melee range <br/>\nit takes no damage. It could just be a bit of buggy code <br/>\nright now, but what Brad outlines above could certainly <br/>\nbe fully implemented come next patch meaning no more <br/>\nkiting. <br/>\nSubmitted by Baelish, 7:03 AM<br/>\n <br/>\n DOT SPELL CHANGE - LIVE ON ALL SERVERS? <br/>\nI have had two separate reports now that NPC&#39;s are not <br/>\ntaking DoT damage once out of the melee range on the <br/>\npublic servers. This means the DoT change is not just a <br/>\ntest server thing. It has gone live. I will do some <br/>\nfurther testing tonight, but in the meantime don&#39;t rely <br/>\non your DoT&#39;s if the monsters does a runner on you. <br/>\n<br/>\nSubmitted by Baelish, 6:49 AM<br/>\n <br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik <br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n9th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
