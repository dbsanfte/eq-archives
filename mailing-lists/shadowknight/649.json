He drops the head and shaft i<br/>\nbelieve. The 3rd part is on a 25ish zombie in befallen<br/>\nnamed Commander Windstream (or something like that).<br/>\nThat would be the handle, which when you right click<br/>\non it, opens like a container, with a COMBINE button.<br/>\nYou put the other 2 pieces in there and COMBINE. And<br/>\nlow and behold..the Thex Mallet.To get him to spawn,or<br/>\nso i hear, you need to turn in the note from Gix to<br/>\nSkeleton Llrodd. To get the note you need to say some<br/>\nphrase which i dont know, but i believe its a SK<br/>\nguildmaster in Neriak that tells you what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck with it<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Grant, Joseph&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JGrant@...\">JGrant@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Grant, Joseph&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JGrant@...\">JGrant@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Howdy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m new to this list so....  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the thex mallet quest you need to kill the<br/>\n&gt; paladin, Sir Lindeal in<br/>\n&gt; Lavastorm.

FINALLY!<br/>\n&gt; I got tired of running from Fire Elementals in<br/>\n&gt; Lavastorm <br/>\n&gt; and went to Befallen and camped Lrodd.  I noticed<br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; after killing him a few times at a yellow con, he <br/>\n&gt; started conning even a few times and then blue.  I<br/>\n&gt; guess <br/>\n&gt; there is some anti camp code that makes him a weaker<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; spawn, or it could be a set cycle. &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3 very kewl things happened to me there. <br/>\n&gt; A high level shaman cast shrink on me!  That was so <br/>\n&gt; kewl. No ducking the entire time I was there, and I<br/>\n&gt; FLEW <br/>\n&gt; through everything.  <br/>\n&gt; A 34th level druid cast Regeneration on me. That was<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; awesome!  I was at 1/4 bub of health after fighting <br/>\n&gt; Lrodd (didn&#39;t use HT once since I was camping him :)<br/>\n&gt;  ) <br/>\n&gt; and I went up to full in a very short amount of time<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; instead of the 10+ minutes I normally spend healing.<br/>\n&gt;  It <br/>\n&gt; also lasted through 3 more fights with Lrodd and<br/>\n&gt; other <br/>\n&gt; assorted denezines of Befallen.<br/>\n&gt; That same Druid killed the Elf Skeleton (Red to me)<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; got the Thex Mallet shaft and then gave it to me. He<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; said he was on another quest and didn&#39;t need it. I<br/>\n&gt; have <br/>\n&gt; no idea if I can even comlete the quest, but I will<br/>\n&gt; look <br/>\n&gt; that up shortly.
