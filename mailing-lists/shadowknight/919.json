My primary weapon is the Dark Reaver.  I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t gotten around to trying a Flesh Ripper, but it sounds like it might <br/>\nbe fun.  If I&#39;m walking around for effect, I use the Reaper of the Dead.  It <br/>\ntends to intimidate people more.  Otherwise I still like playing with my <br/>\nblood claw, and the thulian claws just make me look like a mean biatch!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut like I stated earlier, the DR is my most effective tool at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nX.<br/>\n----Original Message Follows----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wilson, ThomasX B&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thomasx.b.wilson@...\">thomasx.b.wilson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nI was just curious what weapon/s other high level SK&#39;s like to use. I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound that the DR is my weapon of choice, but I do switch to the FleshRipper<br/>\nwhen I&#39;m not to concerned about the AE getting me killed (A DD spell would<br/>\nhave made this weapon so much nicer). Also lately I&#39;ve found myself using a<br/>\nCryt. Sword and MM shield combo (just looks cool, with all the black and<br/>\nsilver plate). Any of you find any other weapons you like using (Thulian<br/>\nclaw, etc??)..<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy...<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
