My wife joined a &quot;good race only&quot; <br/>\nguild and I am now unable to join with her. :(  <br/>\nTo make up for this, I went to Neriak and started <br/>\nkilling things. Heh. <br/>\nI was on the hunt for Bone Chips so that I could stock <br/>\nup for my pet spells. Regular Skellies are now blue and <br/>\nocasionally black.  While there I saved the life of a DE <br/>\nNecro.  I ended up giving this Necro 14 bone chips, and <br/>\nan almost complete set of Netted (after I bought a <br/>\ncomplete set of leather, minus gloves and cap). I felt <br/>\ncontent to help out another player, especially since I <br/>\nknow how much spells cost and how weak magic using <br/>\npeople are at low level.  <br/>\nFrom an RP perspective this was not against my class. <br/>\nWhy? I helped out an evil race necro.  In doing so I <br/>\nhave invested power in the war vs. the goodies.  It also <br/>\nputs that Necro in my debt. Which she says she is and to <br/>\nask her for help anytime I need it. heh! That will come <br/>\nin handy at later levels. ;)  Score one for Thule!<br/>\nNow ack to the original statement and an inquirey.<br/>\nDoes anyone on this list know of a guild on Bertoxxulous <br/>\nthat accepts evil characters and is looking for <br/>\nmembers?  The guild itself need not be evil, but that <br/>\nwould be ok too.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik <br/>\nServant of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n6th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick. Smash&#39;m and they <br/>\nblood same color a Froglok.  Me smash&#39;m Greenblood <br/>\nfor Thule. Thule make Cronik big feared. Make <br/>\nsmash&#39;m fun.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
