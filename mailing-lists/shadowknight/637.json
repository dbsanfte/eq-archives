Gave note to the Guild Master (GM from now on).<br/>\n2. Got the Lady Shea quest.<br/>\nHe doesnt respond to the key words [Bayle List] that<br/>\nhe gives. So either its broken, or they are meant for<br/>\nsomeone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk here is where things get messy.<br/>\nAs we all know when you kill Shea in the Inn she<br/>\ndoesnt drop the note. So while invis, a friend heard<br/>\nher tell her bodyguard to watch her things while she<br/>\ngoes down stairs. Hmm..does he have the note? Kill his<br/>\nsorry dwarven butt. No letter. Aww.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets try this. Even though she is &quot;threatening&quot; to us,<br/>\nwe are all too high of a level for her to attack us.<br/>\nSo we do what the Pallies are supposed to do. Get her<br/>\ndrunk. Its works..YAY! She tells us about the  Qeynos<br/>\nGuard who took the letter from her. Just so happens i<br/>\nknow where he is. Off to High Pass.<br/>\nFound him. He doesnt respond to anything we say except<br/>\n&quot;What is the Bayle List&quot;. But he only says that he<br/>\ndoesnt know what we&#39;re talking about and tells us to<br/>\nstop irritating him.<br/>\nSo we kill him. Easy, but the faction hits we take are<br/>\nbad. Turns out he is a Corrupt guard. Bloodsabers,<br/>\nCorrupt guards, Commander Kane all drop. BLAH!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we get a page (Lore, No Drop). We are assuming<br/>\nthat is the Bayle List. And a rolled up letter which<br/>\nappears to be written in either code or another<br/>\nlanguage, because it was all gibberish.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo go back to Freeport to visit the GM. Give him both.<br/>\nHe says &quot;Whatever&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAWWW<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here are some educated, and maybe some<br/>\nnot-so-educated, guesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe believe that we actually need to get all 3(?)<br/>\npieces of the Bayle List and turn it in instead of<br/>\njust the one part that Shea had taken from her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we have no idea what the coded letter is for.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow heres some random questions for anyone out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we are actually told to kill Shea to get the<br/>\nList, does anyone know if she spawns anywhere other<br/>\nthan that Inn? Obviously at that point she doesnt have<br/>\nit, because it was taken from her. So i was wondering<br/>\nif there was a point where she still has it, maybe in<br/>\na different spot, or different time of day, before its<br/>\ntaken. Then we can kill her and get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if thats a no go, is there a way to get it from<br/>\nDayllin without killing him. Thats a whole lot of<br/>\nfaction i dont want to lose (Kane hates me enough as<br/>\nit is due to all that Trumpy killing i did). Are there<br/>\nany keywords or mini-quests  that anyone knows of that<br/>\nwould get him to cough up his part of the list.<br/>\nI am willing to kill him to get it, but i would rather<br/>\nnot if i dont have to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as far as the rest of the list. I heard thru the<br/>\ngrapevine that anothe piece of it is on a mammoth<br/>\nsomewhere. The 3rd as far as ive heard hasnt been<br/>\nfound. But i havent dug deep into other sites yet.<br/>\nIf anyone has any knowledge of any of these please<br/>\nfeel free to share it :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
