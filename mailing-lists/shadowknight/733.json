Now for my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1725311662\">I finally made 15th last night! Wohoo!<br/>\nI have only used Clinging Darkness 2 times so far but <br/>\nhave not been able to judge how effective it is.<br/>\nNow for my question, hopefully Brian can answer this one <br/>\nfor me.<br/>\nDoes Intelligence influence how often you hit your <br/>\ntarget in melee?  Or is it the level of the target?<br/>\nIn Lavastorm last night while fighting with a DE SK I <br/>\nnoticed that I miss ALOT. This formed a pattern that <br/>\nwhile he was hitting often verses a non-elemental/drakes <br/>\nI was not.<br/>\nI tried slight movement of my view to see if target <br/>\nplacement and closeness was a factor and it did not seem <br/>\nto be so. My Int is 62, and his I&#39;m not sure of, but it <br/>\nis alot higher even at DE default value.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond Question.<br/>\nI am planning on entering South Karana to kill aviaks, <br/>\nor enter Splitpaw. How bad is the KoS factor for a Troll <br/>\nSK there?  I wil be entering from Feerot.<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
