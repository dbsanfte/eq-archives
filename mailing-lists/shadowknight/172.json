I was casting like a mad man...using my underpowered<br/>\npet and having a blast.  My skills in magic maxed very quickly except<br/>\ndivination....but you can only locate so many corpses a night.  Anyhow.<br/>\nAs far as the SK being any less powerfull....I didn&#39;t see that last night.<br/>\nAs a matter of fact...even with the spells we get being chincy at<br/>\n9th...they still help alot.  My pet makes up for damage that I don&#39;t<br/>\ndo....kinda like a free swing.  Not too mention I don&#39;t have to chase down<br/>\nmonsters to either lure them or kill them.  Its all about what you want<br/>\nfrom your character.  SK&#39;s take time to mature....they are part<br/>\nspellcaster and aren&#39;t really going to be effective until they really get<br/>\na good set of spells and some mana.  As many guides have said...they are<br/>\n3/4 warrior and 1/4 caster...while some choose to dwell only on the<br/>\nwarrior part....the casting is in their nature and should be used to<br/>\nfullest extent.<br/>\n<br/>\nKorm<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
