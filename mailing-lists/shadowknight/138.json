BUT, this assumes you&#39;re soloing and thus not tanking for some real<br/>\nspellcasters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a party situation we go after yellows as much as possible, and most<br/>\nyellows destroy my pet in three or four swings, making the pet useless.<br/>\nHowever, in a solo situation I would go after blues and whites mostly, and<br/>\nthen the pet might actually make a difference and be good.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe SK is probably a good solo class for those reasons, and as such isn&#39;t<br/>\nas big a pile as I like to think :-) however I do believe that as a member<br/>\nof a party it&#39;s very difficult for the SK to contribute meaningfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big problem that makes an SK difficult to solo is the lack of healing,<br/>\nnot even life tap.  I think that this would actually make role play really<br/>\nnice -- you&#39;re weak, so you wander the lands sucking the life from weaker<br/>\ncreatures to repair your wounds.  Very Elric.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it boils down to this: the SK is a reasonable solo class, since you&#39;re<br/>\nvery self sufficient except for healing (and bandage wounds is _useless_).<br/>\nSo you waste a lot of time just sitting around healing.  As a party member,<br/>\nthe SK is tantamount to useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people that are high on the SK class think of it in terms of soloing<br/>\nat high levels, and possibly a 50th level SK may be the baddest mofo in<br/>\nNorrath, but I don&#39;t play this game to solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I should just be a bard and quit whining. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
