<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691643163">Grrrrr!<br/>
Well I deleted Lasombra last night to change his stats around and the system<br/>
wouldn&#39;t let me use the name again. So Sabbat is the new me. Yes, I know you<br/>
are all thrilled to death. As a side note: at 1st level 10 Stamina = 1 HP.<br/>
<br/>
I bought my Grobb Cleaver when I had my TSK and am seeking infomation from<br/>
those that have done the quest personally, DE xp preferred. I know the<br/>
basics of the quest. Kill Nerbilik in OOT and get 3 HEHE meat from Oggok,<br/>
give the recipe and meat (not stacked) to Carver. I also know that you can<br/>
accidentally eat those stupid meats as well.<br/>
<br/>
Now for my questions.<br/>
1) What does Carver need to /con to recieve the Grobb Cleaver<br/>
(indifferent/amiable/warmly)?<br/>
2) What faction is Carver tied to?<br/>
3) As a DE SK what faction hit do you take when you kill Nerbilik? Will<br/>
killing him make me KoS if I haven&#39;t raised faction first? All I could find<br/>
was &quot;you take a massive faction hit with trolls&quot; which doesn&#39;t tell me<br/>
didly.<br/>
4) Is Lyguna tied to Troll Shaman faction?<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t killed a Froglock in a while, so I assume killing Froglocks<br/>
increases all Troll faction if killed in the swamp. If so I will do this to<br/>
increase faction in Grobb before I attempt this quest.<br/>
<br/>
p.s.- Wake up this list! The only mail I have seen is stuff I have sent and<br/>
replies to it.<br/>
