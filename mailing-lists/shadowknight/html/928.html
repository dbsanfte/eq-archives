 </span></blockquote>Aye i too came across that little piece of info. That<br/>
story greatly intrigued me.<br/>
I thought i would have to wait for the PoH to open<br/>
before i found out more about it. Glad to see he&#39;s<br/>
found new friends :)<br/>
<br/>
For a brief recap,for those who may not know,of that<br/>
story as i remember it:<br/>
<br/>
Peitro Zarn (the main SK guildmaster in Freeport)<br/>
&quot;saved&quot; Opal, the cleric GM (name?), and Xicotl (a<br/>
troll, didnt notice any class reference) from wasted<br/>
lives or some such thing. Xicotl was an etremely<br/>
intelligent troll apparently. He eventually tried to<br/>
take the Dismal Rage over, but Zarn summoned the<br/>
powers of Innoruuk and banished Xicotl to the Plane of<br/>
Hate.<br/>
<br/>
End Story<br/>
<br/>
I am indeed curious as to what he has to say about<br/>
Zarn and company.<br/>
Does he still follow Innoruuk? or has he converted to<br/>
another dark god?<br/>
<br/>
On another note:<br/>
<br/>
I did one of those stupid bard delivery quests and<br/>
noticed my faction with Mistmoore himself dropped. Any<br/>
clue why?<br/>
Looks like Lenya may be biting the dust soon :)<br/>
I want to try my hardest to get in good with the MM<br/>
crowd. Would beinteresting to just go walking thru<br/>
there saying high to everyone. Pipedream? maybe. guess<br/>
i&#39;ll find out.<br/>
