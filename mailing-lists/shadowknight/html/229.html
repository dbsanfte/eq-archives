<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404167271">For those of you that don&#39;t know yet, the manual was updated last night, and<br/>
this line is taken from it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Vampiric Embrace (Necromancer and Shadow Knight)  Once cast, this spell<br/>
gives you a chance of draining HP from your target every time you attack.<br/>
Formally, this spell added to your attack roll.<br/>
<br/>
So, they changed it and now we can heal, but only randomly. I guess I&#39;ll<br/>
have to wait and see what it is like when I get to level 22, but it sure<br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like anything I am going to rely on to heal me. :)<br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>
