<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049104660">I think the Militia leader is Sir Lucan.  You can increase your faction with<br/>
the militia by killing Deathfist orcs or the Paladins of North freeport<br/>
(most fun!)  You can get to north freeport via the tunnels.<br/>
<br/>
The note for Sir Lucan is gained somewhere in the West Commonlands, I also<br/>
believe that this quest is the exact reverse of a paladin quest, the<br/>
paladins have to find and save this character, we have to kill him....<br/>

Even though I&#39;m DE, I am working through the human quests in Freeport.<br/>
I managed to track down Groflah and slay him, and I&#39;ve ran errands for<br/>
the necromancers there.  I am now working on tracking down the militia<br/>
guy Sir something, but as a DE, my passage through Freeport is both<br/>
limited and dangerous (just how I like it).  I was looking for a hint<br/>
to his location, and wondering about his faction (I&#39;m KOS to the<br/>
militia, but amiable to the SK guild).<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I killed Dyllin a long time ago, and looking in my<br/>
bank found the Bayle List II.  I gave it to the guy who sends you<br/>
after Sir what&#39;s his name, and he said &quot;Whatever.&quot;  Now I&#39;m trying<br/>
to do the whole quest to see who I should give it to.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my speculation...  I have done all the Neriak SK quests (<br/>
except the courier duties), and some of the Grobb/Oggok ones with<br/>
other chars.  If a quest sword ala Soulfire is in the game, I think<br/>
it must stem from the human guilds, or some other source.  I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed too many of the Freeport SK quests tie in with the Soulfire<br/>
quest, but with opposing goals.  I just thought it would be ironic<br/>
if in our quest for a sword we would thwart the paladins.  Anybody<br/>
else notice this?<br/>
<br/>
On another note, has anyone ever got a cyclops eye as loot?  I&#39;ve<br/>
killed Broon, and maybe Droon too, as well as several cyclopses,<br/>
and never once received one.<br/>
