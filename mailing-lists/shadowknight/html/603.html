<div id="ygrps-yiv-134691810">ok, throw this at the soerbaird&#39;s site (and say hi to tionne for me<br/>
while yer there :))<br/>
<br/>
For starters, Harm Touch is NOT meant to help you kill things you could<br/>
not normally take out. It is there to help you survive in a situation<br/>
where things have gotten out of hand, but not extraordinarily so. This<br/>
said, trying to use HT as a panic button is not the best way of<br/>
utilizing it; my goal here is to explain some of the strategies I&#39;ve<br/>
found that maximize HT&#39;s effectiveness.<br/>
<br/>
For the uninitiated, HT is an attack, useable by a shadow knight once<br/>
per game day, that deals 10 * player level + 1 in damage to the target.<br/>
i.e. a level 20 shadow knight can HT for 201 damage at maximum. Like all<br/>
such attacks that deal damage, it is susceptible to being resisted by<br/>
the target. However, after a great deal of experimentation with HT I<br/>
have decided that it acts more like a melee attack than a DD spell; your<br/>
position in relation to the target COUNTS. Also important is timing,<br/>
which i will get into first:<br/>
<br/>
The most important part of HT is teaching yourself the proper time to<br/>
use it. It is a little difficult to explain, you just have to practice<br/>
on your own and sort of develop an instinct for it. For starters, DON&#39;T<br/>
PANIC! EverQuest somehow seems to know when you are freaking out and<br/>
hitting the HT button out of desparation, and you often end up with a<br/>
resisted spell and an angry critter. You have to stay calm, at least<br/>
until after you have used it :) If you are hunting in a new area, try<br/>
using HT on a typical monster while you are in a safe fight (preferably<br/>
grouped) just to test how much of the target&#39;s life is blasted off by<br/>
your hit. Now you know how weak that particular monster has to be before<br/>
a harm touch will finish it off. Now, if you get into a fight with too<br/>
many monsters, you can blast one of them to death as soon as you have<br/>
melee&#39;d it down enough, and move on to the next. Just remember to only<br/>
use it as an attack when the situation grows dire; if you can&#39;t kill it<br/>
WITHOUT using harm touch, you shouldn&#39;t be fighting it! You are welcome<br/>
to battle creatures this way, but you are only going to get yourself<br/>
killed eventually, and probably in a messy way :) In addition to using<br/>
HT as an attack, it is also one of your most effective taunts. If a<br/>
group member is being mauled and in dire need of help, you can use your<br/>
HT to anger the monster and pull it off on you. Just make sure you have<br/>
enough HP remaining to survive the monster&#39;s ire! Using HT as a direct<br/>
taunt works consistently until around lvl 30 or so, when monsters start<br/>
getting HP much faster than your HT goes up. At this point, in order to<br/>
taunt off of your group members, you will need to use other annoyances,<br/>
such as taunt skill, darkness spells, and disease cloud to get yourself<br/>
high enough on the monster&#39;s hate list for HT to put you over the top.<br/>
<br/>
When using HT from the target&#39;s rear, and especially while it is fleeing<br/>
or Fear&#39;ed, I can consistently deal full damage on targets that are as<br/>
many as 10 levels higher than me. This is in contrast to a wizard&#39;s<br/>
direct damage spells, which don&#39;t care what direction you face the enemy<br/>
from, and are virtually impossible to have hit an npc of 6 levels higher<br/>
for full damage.  This does sound like a simple way to use HT, but in<br/>
combat it can be tricky to get around behind the enemy sometimes. If you<br/>
are grouped, my suggestion is to lay off the enemy for a moment so that<br/>
it builds up hate with another group member, allowing you to circle<br/>
behind it without angering it. Remember to stop taunting and casting<br/>
spells at this time! :) If you are fighting solo, it can be trickier.<br/>
Don&#39;t count on your pet to hold the target&#39;s attention (you AREN&#39;T<br/>
trying to use it as a tank, are you?); drop a darkness spell on it, cast<br/>
Fear, and pop it in the back once it starts running. If you are below<br/>
lvl 15 and do not yet have Clinging Darkness and Fear, don&#39;t worry;<br/>
until this point you SHOULD be able to solo without them anyway, if you<br/>
are doing well :)<br/>
<br/>
At very high level, the effectiveness of harm touch displays diminishing<br/>
returns. When your typical monsters have thousands of HP, a few hundred<br/>
points are not going to count for too much. Don&#39;t fret; as a shadow<br/>
knight, your spells and sword should allow you to drop plenty of damage<br/>
on your target anyways. It&#39;s just that harm touch will become less and<br/>
less useful, except as a taunt and as a way of eliminating annoying low<br/>
level casters that may accompany the higher level monsters you want to<br/>
fight. There really isn&#39;t much to reccomend it at very high level,<br/>
except that having an extra 400 to 500 points of damage dealt,<br/>
instantly, can occasionally save your life. HT can still be a very<br/>
powerful tool in PvP, however ;)<br/>
<br/>
A brief note on using HT in PvP situations: many players, especially<br/>
casters, are not used to having VERY large chunks of their life suddenly<br/>
blasted off of them all of a sudden. I have seen a wizard suddenly gate<br/>
out of a duel after bearing the brunt of a HT, even though he knew it<br/>
was coming, and in my opinion was in a good position to win. In these<br/>
cases, not only is HT a valuable damage tool in a duel, it is most<br/>
effective for its psych-out factor. If you can panic your opponent, you<br/>
can probably win, regardless of your relative levels. Just be careful<br/>
when fighting a paladin, who can cancel your HT with a timely<br/>
application of Lay on Hands. You will have to win a game of chicken,<br/>
wait until they have already used LoH (and hope you have enough HP left)<br/>
or find some way to keep them from using LoH altogether. I leave that<br/>
part up to you ;)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, now go out there and kill something in the name of Innoruuk!<br/>
