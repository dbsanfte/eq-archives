<div id="ygrps-yiv-470249343">good luck to you :) a few tips on the zombie to make sure you are prepared:<br/>
<br/>
do NOT use area effect spells for the fight. he&#39;ll spawn right next to<br/>
kazzel.. and making kazzel angry is not healthy.<br/>
<br/>
zombie uses AE fear, so get the magic resist of everyone there as high as<br/>
possible.. no good being feared into a cyclops and having more mess to deal<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
dont try to fear kite the zombie :) he will teleport.. and then start<br/>
summoning you one by one.. not pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
we were shocked when the zombie i spawned had a two handed sword :o it only<br/>
turned out to be fine steel, but even so it looked pretty cool for this<br/>
gigantic skeleton to be chopping us with a 10 foot long sword :)<br/>
