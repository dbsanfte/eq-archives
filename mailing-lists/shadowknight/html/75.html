<div id="ygrps-yiv-163015715">Being a dark elf....the cities I can travel too aren&#39;t too many.  I&#39;ve<br/>
seen the troll city....not much there for me.  I haven&#39;t been to Oggok but<br/>
i hear its a semi decent town.  Qeynos I now hear is KOS.  I have been<br/>
into Freeport and walked around a bit....just have to /con alot...bu the<br/>
guards won&#39;t attack me if i don&#39;t bother them.  Are there any other cities<br/>
out there....that Dark Elves can go into that anyone knows of.<br/>
<br/>
