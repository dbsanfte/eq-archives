<div id="ygrps-yiv-604451779">Well after trying myself to find one of the guys for over an hour, I called<br/>
in my ranger friend who was able to locate 1 on tracking.. We proceeded to<br/>
the Temple and killed it, didn&#39;t drop anything. So for the next 3 hours we<br/>
ran around Cazic trying to locate more of the damn things with no luck.. The<br/>
Ranger saw one more appear on tracking but dissappeared before he could find<br/>
it. If they are going to make this a rare spawn how about at least making<br/>
sure that it drops the pieces everytime.. And here I was thinking that this<br/>
would eliminate camping..(Plus the fact I hate Cazic, still a mad house in<br/>
there)..<br/>
<br/>
Oh and here is something you always want to see, Wizard shouting across the<br/>
zone &quot;What is this Decayed armor I picked up for??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy..<br/>

Crusaders are actually pretty tough. They do Harm<br/>
Touch and its darn good one too. And the y hit for 80s<br/>
They were blue to me at 37. <br/>
I have had a horrible time finding them.<br/>
One person said his group killed about a dozen of them<br/>
in a 6 hour period at the Archon temple. I have been<br/>
at that same spot for a lot longer, and ive seen 3.<br/>
First dropped a left vambrace. Then the next day, one<br/>
dropped nothing, a few hours later another dropped a<br/>
bracer.<br/>
Thats it.<br/>
<br/>
Which leads to my question. Has anyone figured out a<br/>
spawn place/time for the crusaders?<br/>
<br/>
I have also heeard one spawns in the UTR.<br/>
<br/>
Still no sign of the cavalier.<br/>
<br/>
There is more camping time now than with rubi.<br/>
Oh well<br/>
