<div id="ygrps-yiv-981879029">I&#39;m not sure about either one of these spells as I haven&#39;t used them with my<br/>
SK yet, however I did use Shadow Step with my Necro once and really liked<br/>
the spell, however, IT too became completely useless once I realized that<br/>
even though you teleport to a different spot your target still has you<br/>
targeted.  This is a really lame part of the Shadow Step spell.  The spell<br/>
actually began to work against me since more often than not I would be the<br/>
one to get disoriented and my target would somehow miraculously know exactly<br/>
where I was going to appear.  And may the &quot;gods&quot; help me if I was fighting a<br/>
caster when I used Shadow Step.  They simply just kept blasting as if I<br/>
decided &quot;No wait Mr. Caster, kill over here in this spot instead.&quot;  Complete<br/>
and total waste of mana since the you remain targeted by your opponent.  So<br/>
to answer your question if this spell is still the same as it was when I was<br/>
using my Necro than it wouldn&#39;t hurt my feelings to see it go.  Voice Graft<br/>
I haven&#39;t ever once used with neither my Necro OR my SK.<br/>

&gt;Okay, here&#39;s a question for you folks.  What if Shadow Step and Voice Graft<br/>
 </span></blockquote>were replaced with some kind of lifetap spells?  Would<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;this be grossly unbalancing or hurt the class?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If we tune the SK we can&#39;t really ADD new spells, since this would give<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them more spells than the other hybrids at each rank.<br/>
