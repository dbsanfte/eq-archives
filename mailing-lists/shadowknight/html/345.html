<div id="ygrps-yiv-844263572">now i&#39;ve heard several people say that if you use archery you should have a<br/>
quiver, because arrows are pulled directly from it if you run out of arrows<br/>
in your ammo slot. however... being something of a bastard, i use LARGE<br/>
SEWING KITS as my containers. they weigh very little, and can hold anything<br/>
a backpack can hold, even a few things that a backpack CAN&#39;T hold (like<br/>
larger weapons). the trick is making sure that you dont accidentally hit<br/>
combine... now, when i store arrows in a large sewing kit, ammo is drawn<br/>
from it automatically as if it were a quiver. and i am assuming that the kit<br/>
weighs less than and has more slots than a quiver. this is most likely a<br/>
bug, but a fairly minor one (with little real abuse power) so i havent<br/>
bothered to report it yet.. altho i pass it on here ;)<br/>
