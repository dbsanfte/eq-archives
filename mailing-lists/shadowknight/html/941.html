<div id="ygrps-yiv-97842573">hey i feel the same way, I just hit level 28 and i am powergaming as well, i <br/>
really wany level 30, we get new spells but its the Hell level. I am killing <br/>
Treants as well, once you hit level 30 you should get urself some Rubicite <br/>
armor and also try and get stuff that you can trade to get yourself a Dark <br/>
Reaver, such as dwarven work boots.<br/>
Guards can&#39;t see invisible, just CON them if they look at you indefferently <br/>
while invisible, ur fine, if not stay away.</div>
