&gt; i THINK that giving 4 orc pawn picks to one of the merchants at habard&#39;s<br/>
&gt; resales in east fp will raise faction with numerous FP groups, with no<br/>
&gt; decreases.. but i dont remember at this point whether the rogues are among<br/>
&gt; them. worth a try, anyway. by doing so you also get a lottery ticket from<br/>
&gt; highpass, which will randomly be a winning number that could result in<br/>
&gt; something interesting, but nobody is quite sure yet..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of my guildmates just found this quest.  I&#39;m hoping my faction<br/>
in FP will let me do it... even if I have to invis past the guards.<br/>
Now she&#39;s doing it to try for the winning ticket =)<br/>
