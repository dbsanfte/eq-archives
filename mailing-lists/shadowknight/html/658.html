<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050198306"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This is an example of how messed up some of the quests in EQ are.  You<br/>
 </span></blockquote>need to be 20th level to get this weapon, but when you finally do, it sucks.<br/>
The only reason I would see anyone wanting this at level 20 is for putting<br/>
in your range slot for the +5 Magic resistence.  My 9th level cleric can<br/>
summon a weapon that has superior attack stats to this piece of ****.<br/>
<br/>
Scragg, you&#39;re missing the big picture. The Thex Mallet is not the END of a<br/>
quest, just part of the MEANS. What I mean by this is that the Thex Mallet<br/>
gets turned in to an NPC for a Ring of the Dead (the ring that lets us SKs<br/>
BIND). You&#39;re right, the Mallet sucks, and that&#39;s because it is only PART of<br/>
a quest, it isn&#39;t meant for actual use.<br/>
