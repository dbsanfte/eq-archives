&gt; Yes great idea on the sword/shield anit ghoulbane<br/>
&gt; combo. I agree that us higher level sks need to still<br/>
&gt; be able to attain the sword and shield though.  Shock<br/>
&gt; of Poison would be a great effect for dd but i think<br/>
&gt; that would be WAY WAY WAY too unbalanced.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about a lifetap effect?  Or maybe some DD/DOT effect?<br/>
On a side note, if the engine permits it, an aura of darkness<br/>
would be the coolest thing in the game, I&#39;m envious of the cool<br/>
visuals on Soulfire, but an aura of darkness would be even cooler.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also like to see this quest be fairly involved, which would be <br/>
hard to do for both Humans and DEs.  And to the SKs out there, <br/>
please don&#39;t post a walkthrough like what happened with Soulfire.<br/>
That&#39;s just lame.<br/>
