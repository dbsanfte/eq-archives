<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318461361">Troll SKs are awesome.<br/>
I spent this weekend in Lavastorm.  What a kewl place.  <br/>
Now I know where to go to get gems for an aspiring <br/>
jeweler.  While there I made 11th on Saturday night and <br/>
am half way to 12th. I would never have gotten the kills <br/>
I did when solo if not for being a troll. Hitpoint <br/>
regeneration and skill usage is the only way I made it. <br/>
Granted, my fire saves sucked, but I wasn&#39;t taking max <br/>
damage every time either. Blue conning Drakes took me to <br/>
1/4 bubble of health very often.  I figured out a system <br/>
to lower that damage after 4 such events.  Hit it with <br/>
Siphon Strngth to get it&#39;s attention, lure it into <br/>
Najena mouth, Bash, Disease Cloud, Slash. Repeat as <br/>
necessary. I was able to cast and recover my Slam before <br/>
the spell becaome available again.  Fizzles and <br/>
interupts made it close sometimes, but usually had just <br/>
under 1/2 health and OOM when it died. I was very <br/>
tempted to get another blue when like that, but I knew <br/>
the system was working and not to get greedy. I wanted <br/>
12 so bad last night!<br/>
Loot was ok during the daylight hours, but at night <br/>
(game time) loot was almost non-existant.  <br/>
My only real complaint is that someone I grouped with <br/>
was a total jerk.  He was a DE SK the same level as me.  <br/>
He shouted looking for a group. No problem.  We start to <br/>
kill things, he loots everything! When I give him tells, <br/>
group say or says I am ignored. I start to to get really <br/>
POed by the third kill but we are taking yellows so I <br/>
put up with it. I add an SK guild member to the group <br/>
and actually have a conversation.  While resting up in <br/>
the Najena tunnel, he disappears. We start fighting a <br/>
fire imp.  We both used HT (mine was a bit off due to <br/>
lag and only did about 25 points of damage) but is too <br/>
late. We both died. I yelled in group say we needed help <br/>
at the entranceand the jerk didn&#39;t even try to help out <br/>
or respond.  My guild member and I disbanded and <br/>
reformed.  No way in hell I am going to share XP with an <br/>
a$$ like that.<br/>
For those of you on Bertoxxulous do not group with <br/>
Antochion.  Actually do me a favor and train him with a <br/>
few elementals. :)  <br/>
On a Verant-get-your-act-together note...<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize it before but I have my guildsay chat <br/>
filter turned off. This was not a problem when I was not <br/>
in a guild.  The last few days I have been wondering why <br/>
everything I said in Guildsay was ignored.  It really <br/>
wasn&#39;t, but now I can&#39;t turn the filter back on.  It is <br/>
a bug that is known and being worked on. How can you <br/>
screw up the chat filter on/off switch? I know they <br/>
revamped guild stuff totally, but come on! Anyone else <br/>
have this problem?<br/>
The guild is new, and I am the 2nd highest level in it. <br/>
I missed everything that was said at the Officers <br/>
meeting Saturday night. They switched to says when they <br/>
realized what my problem was.  I still missed most of it <br/>
as the leader said he would fill me in later. :(<br/>
All I got was what dues to pay, and what the Ranking was <br/>
going to look like.<br/>
Ah well.<br/>
If you are on Bertoxx, and are in an evil guild we are <br/>
looking for people to align with. Give me a /t in <br/>
game. :)  If you want to join the guild I will group <br/>
with you and see what kind of style you have and if it <br/>
fits with us.  We don&#39;t have a webpage yet, but one is <br/>
on it&#39;s way. :)<br/>
Thanks for the Spore Guardian info.  I wandered the <br/>
Swamp for hours looking for him. Now I can just stand <br/>
still and wait for hours. heh.  Is the spawn triggered <br/>
after talking to the SK next to Kukulk?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
