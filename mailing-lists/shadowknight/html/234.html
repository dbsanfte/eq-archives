<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361612369">I wish their was a way to save the text output from the duel, and be able to<br/>
send it to 929 or whomever makes the adjustments to the characters, and<br/>
invite them to test it themselves, because I am sure they can create a<br/>
character(s) at whatever level they want (including stats) with the<br/>
equipment they want and see what happens.  Maybe that would get their<br/>
attention that we might need a power boost.  And maybe publish the results<br/>
for us and everyone to see. (But honestly I doubt they would take the time,<br/>
they got our money already).<br/>
<br/>
I guess my 2 questions is shouldn&#39;t we be equal to a paladin at the same<br/>
level warrior wise and equal to the magic ability as a paladin is.  I guess<br/>
our god is not as powerful as the paladin&#39;s god, maybe that is the correct<br/>
assumption?  or maybe a shadow knight was an after thought to the game (hey<br/>
lets add some &quot;evil&quot; classes to the game) and never fully tested.  Because<br/>
if I have read the posts correctly that no one ever made it to level 50<br/>
shadow knight (I think I read that in the undiscovered weapons) in the beta,<br/>
but they did make a paladin level in the beta (and that is why they knew the<br/>
weapons available for the paladin), if I am wrong let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone should find a paladin and do a duel with them (same armor and<br/>
weapons should be used and preferably stats, and of course the applicable<br/>
spells) and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

Allright, lets do this in detail.<br/>
My guildmate and i had  friendly duel. He was a 18th level Halfling Druid I<br/>
myslef was a 17th level Dark Elf Shadowknight. He had full leather and a<br/>
screaming mace. I had a shiny brass halberd, Full bronze Platemail, 110 str<br/>
after siphoning. He rooted me and blasted me with a spell doing 37 pts a<br/>
turn and Stinging swarm. I got the joy of casting my three spells at him<br/>
until i was un rooted and harm touched him. The harm touch did HALF a bubble<br/>
YES HALF. after he was taxed. Now at melee. My halberd was doing about one<br/>
to twenty nine pints of damage. at one time in the duel, I did one point of<br/>
damage three times in a row. Also, 75% of my spells were laughed off. the<br/>
only good thing i did in my fight was dodge and parry quite often(helps to<br/>
be a dark elf fer that). Well thats about that. Rather embarrasing and<br/>
disheartening. In beta I played a warrior and never lost a battle.<br/>
