&gt; thanks again xillith. i still dont think these are weapon procs tho.. while<br/>
&gt; VE can be interrupted, and even the DR on rare occasions, a spell with as<br/>
&gt; long a casting time as life leech would be almost impossible to get off in<br/>
&gt; battle. however.. come to think i DO remember paragon on eqss saying that<br/>
&gt; after a patch his pestilence scythe had 1 charge of this..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps though, the casting time is ignored for the proc, just like<br/>
the fact that it is a 49th SK spell is ignored (remember, anyone<br/>
can right click a charged item)<br/>
<br/>
Just my hunch, if it is in the game, _wow_!  *wonders how many<br/>
times he could cast a 315 mana spell* Also, if you look at the other<br/>
spells listed, numerous spells (vamp embrace and lifetap, vamp curse)<br/>
have the spell effect listed as &quot;life leech&quot;.<br/>
