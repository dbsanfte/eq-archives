<div id="ygrps-yiv-569840998">If you give him the note he talks about finding a traitor in the ranks of<br/>
the militia from the paladins, though at this point I dont know who is the<br/>
traitor and I am warry of slaughtering guards if I am not 100% sure who i am<br/>
looking for.<br/>

I read the other posts.. their close but not spot on.  Sir Lucan is on the<br/>
ground floor of the militia building.  AS you first enter it, hes at the<br/>
room at the far end of the first corridor - there is a second room past 2<br/>
guards.<br/>
<br/>
The person you need to kill is not Altunic Jartin!  Its someone fishing near<br/>
a lake....  Steal his note and hand it in to the SK guild in freeport<br/>
instead of Sir Lucan - I&#39;m actually going to do it again to see what happens<br/>
if you give Lucan the note.<br/>

&gt; I think the Militia leader is Sir Lucan.  You can increase your faction<br/>

&gt; (most fun!)  You can get to north freeport via the tunnels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which part of Freeport is Sir Lucan in?  I can travel freely in North<br/>
Freeport, but I assume he is not there, since that is Pally land.  I<br/>
think once upon a time I could travel in Freeport, but then I discovered<br/>
Krazen Loosh...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So I have heard, but I want to do all the steps so I can see if<br/>
there&#39;s some hint in there someone has missed.<br/>
