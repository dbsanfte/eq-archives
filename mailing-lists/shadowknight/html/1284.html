<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-823248442">Well I just found out there was a list about amonth ago and this thread is<br/>
the first one i have received so I&#39;ll introduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
I just got 47 with Squiggles, My Troll SK on Vallon Zek. I am the leader of<br/>
&lt;Da Bashin&#39; Iggles&gt;. My guild and our allies are preparing for a dragon<br/>
raid in a month at the max. Tried Fire Giants for the first time on<br/>
Saturday night, did ok on the first 3, but got massacred after that. Anyone<br/>
got any tips on FG&#39;s, dragons, or breaking into the Planes? Pulling<br/>
locations for FG&#39;s would be most beneficial at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Let me remind you that this is Race War PvP server so we are an al evil<br/>
team guild, as are our allies. So we don&#39;t have bards or monks.<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
