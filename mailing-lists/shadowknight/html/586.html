<div id="ygrps-yiv-820247462">well, i&#39;m really not sure any more what makes groflah appear. in both<br/>
cases i made him show up it was just after i had talked to netuk.. and i<br/>
THINK it was late at night. but it is entirely possible that it was just<br/>
random.. i dont think a paladin triggered the quest, because the paladin<br/>
i&#39;d talked to said groflah appeared UPSTAIRS for him, and the groflah i<br/>
met appeared downstairs. dont worry if you have trouble with this one..<br/>
as i said before, the quest really isnt worth it ;p<br/>
<br/>
lady shae&#39;s quest is broken because she never drops the note. she does<br/>
leave a corpse, it just doesnt have anything in it.<br/>
<br/>
also, since the quest for the electrum bladed wakizashi has changed,<br/>
does anybody know what grimrot gives now when you return arlena&#39;s<br/>
remains?<br/>
