<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071252174">hmm. i think i have a difference of opinion..<br/>
when i first got to lvl 9 and 10, i felt a lot of the same despair you feel<br/>
now: i wasnt doing very well solo, not worth much in my group, spells more<br/>
or less useless, a same level paladin could kick my sorry little butt, and<br/>
so on. but for whatever reason (i hate giving up on my first character, no<br/>
matter how bad i screwed it up) i stuck it out, and when i got to lvl 15 all<br/>
of a sudden things started to turn around. i think part of it is learning<br/>
how to use your spells and pet strategically, and part of it is the few<br/>
warrior class skills you can gain along the way. and as i&#39;ve learned, a<br/>
great part of it is learning how group dynamics work, and how to NOT die. i<br/>
group regularly, and have quite a number of buddies who seek me out as soon<br/>
as we notice each other on. mostly just for fun, but i&#39;ve also become a<br/>
useful tank to my typical group members (made up mostly of several monks, a<br/>
few necromancers, a ranger, a few clerics, and even a few paladins, rp be<br/>
damned :)). if disease cloud may seem hideously underpowered, it makes up<br/>
for that by the fact that monsters HATE it. in a group situation, the SK<br/>
becomes a great damage sponge because he can quickly lure monsters off other<br/>
group members with a few taunts and disease clouds, saving their behinds and<br/>
giving the group a greater chance of success. but like i said, part of it is<br/>
group dynamics: know how to FORM a workable group, know how to avoid trains,<br/>
learn how to pick out the right position in a region to battle from, and<br/>
make damn sure that everybody in the group knows their job. more than once<br/>
i&#39;ve seen a spellcaster get killed simply because he cast TOO much, enraged<br/>
the monster, and left me without a reasonable chance to lure it off of him.<br/>
i may not hit as often as the monks or as hard as the necros or be able to<br/>
cure like clerics and paladins, but i have good AC and HP, and many ways to<br/>
get critters annoyed with me, so i can take the brunt of the fight when<br/>
others need it. and that&#39;s how i found my niche in a group environment.<br/>
<br/>
here is what i&#39;ve found with pets: they are most useful within 2 or 3 levels<br/>
of when you get them. at that point they fight almost with your own skill at<br/>
arms despite their lower level (except for the first pet), and they also act<br/>
as distractions to give you extra ground if you have to flee. the main<br/>
problem with the first pet is that it is trigger happy; it will chase after<br/>
anything that looks at it funny. luckily, the second pet and above are more<br/>
careful, only entering a battle if you order it or it sees that you have<br/>
actually been attacked. also, pets are best used when solo, and then in wide<br/>
open areas. using a pet in a dungeon is a BAD idea. it is a good way to<br/>
start trains if your pet follows a fleeing target around a corner and you<br/>
lose track of it. they also act as good repositories for any rusty weapons<br/>
you happen to come across in your travels. just be sure to learn ALL of the<br/>
pet commands, what they do, and have reclaim energy ready at all times if<br/>
you need to get rid of Jobaber in a hurry :)<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m not sure how, but i&#39;ve actually gained xp FASTER than most of my usual<br/>
group, who are mostly made up of humans. i myself am a human SK, and am now<br/>
about a full level higher than the people i&#39;ve been grouping with most. this<br/>
will sound really dumb, but here&#39;s my secret: don&#39;t die ;) wether it is by<br/>
luck or some kind of instinct, i have managed to cut down my average of<br/>
deaths to a little under one death per level. i&#39;m not a coward; i have<br/>
brazenly ridden through areas that gave high level beta testers the jitters.<br/>
i just take the time to know what to expect in the area i&#39;m in, and know how<br/>
to avoid it, or how to get away from it :) death will STILL happen of<br/>
course. the other day i crested a dune and suddenly found myself at the feet<br/>
of three sand giants. it wasnt pretty, but at least i learned that spirit of<br/>
the wolf does no good if you are attacked by several giants at once. but<br/>
much more often i have survived due to sheer luck, the quick actions of<br/>
group members, or simply doing something really STUPID. (it may not sound<br/>
wise to assist a dying high level in fighting a monstrous big baddie, but<br/>
sometimes it actually saves you in the long run if it becomes too weak to<br/>
follow your retreat..)<br/>
<br/>
sorry if the email is too long or patronizing. i just dont like hearing<br/>
people thinking of giving up, so i make as many suggestions as i can :) hope<br/>
i helped, or if i&#39;m just bugging you speak up and i wont ramble on so much<br/>
again ;)<br/>
