<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222733229">After reading your post myself and a friend tried<br/>
this.<br/>
I spoke with Netuk and headed to the Seafarers Roost.<br/>
The ogre was there with his female pal, along with<br/>
several other NPCs that pop in and out and there was<br/>
even a neat argument between a bard, troll and dark<br/>
elf. But no Groflah.<br/>
I did see the barbarian once, he walked into the door<br/>
behind the bartenders and disappeared.<br/>
I left my friend there then i went down to our guild<br/>
and continually triggered the quest from 11PM (EQ<br/>
time) to 7AM, but Groflah still.<br/>
Any idea about what time you spoke to Netuk, or could<br/>
it be possible that he spawned because a Paladin<br/>
troggered the quest and by coincidence you did as<br/>
well?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if anyone has any further detail it would be<br/>
appreciated. I will keep trying however.<br/>
<br/>
It was mentioned before that the Lady Shea part was<br/>
broken. Does her corpse disappear as Groflah&#39;s does in<br/>
N Freeport? or does she just not drop the note?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
