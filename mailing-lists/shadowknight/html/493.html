<div id="ygrps-yiv-570953515">Ok, I just made 14 lastnight, so I don&#39;t know anything past the &quot;first<br/>
stage&quot; of an SK&#39;s life, but I&#39;ll try and help anyway, since you and I are in<br/>
the same stage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Tvar, on Povar.  Dark Elf SK (Aren&#39;t we all?)  To answer someone&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>questions, and as an introduction.  Still mostly in patchwork armor except<br/>
for the two pieces I have bought, one ring tunic and one banded wrist.  Oh,<br/>
and I have a Studded Collar I bought, too.  No magic weapon yet, despairing<br/>
of ever getting one....did finally buy a mino axe, though.   I usually lead<br/>
with Siphon Strength as a pull, then Disease Cloud, then just whack, whack,<br/>
whack.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  And still hate runners.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I do too. I do use the pet for an extra hit though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Having great difficulty in making it past 12th, STILL just one bubble into<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it, after two weeks (but haven&#39;t played all that much since made 12th, been<br/>
real busy, so not THAT bad....)  Currently over in South Karana, trying to<br/>
hunt in Paw, only moderately successfully.  Kodies in the Commons, is that<br/>
all I have to look forward to?<br/>
<br/>
Once you get 12th level, Dorn&#39;s dervish camp in North Ro becomes prime<br/>
hunting. At 12 you should have a few blues, plenty of whites (which you can<br/>
beat), and some yellows. The flagpole derv can be pulled alone, but the<br/>
other two in the camp are linked. It&#39;s a great spot for dark elves because<br/>
Dorn kills any light-siders that get too close or try to pull a derv. I&#39;ve<br/>
been there since 12th level, and I&#39;ll be there till 15th. Go try it out. Go<br/>
into NRo, and his camp is over near the fishing village right on the water.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What is BIBS?  GZ?  PGT?<br/>
&gt; BBC = Bone-Bladed Claymore, that one I know.  I carry both weapons, 1H and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>2H, keep both skills maxxed out.  Mostly I use the 2H, because of the<br/>
damage, and pull out the 1H when I know I am going to be fighting casters,<br/>
or end up fighting casters.  (Have gotten pretty good at switching during<br/>
battle...)  Lower delay on 1H means quicker attacks and maybe an<br/>
interruption or two with it, then, since they lowered Bash to 6th level, use<br/>
it to bash with shield and hopefully interrupt with it.  Still just have a<br/>
plain shield, though.  Was surprised at the mino axe, it does decent damage,<br/>
and runs about 3/4 of damage of my two-hander.<br/>
<br/>
BIBS = Blackened Iron Bastard Sword, 2HS, 20 48.<br/>
GZ = Gigantic Zweihander, 2HS, 18 39<br/>
PGT = Polished Granite Tomahawk, 1HS, don&#39;t know stats, but it casts a<br/>
little temporary invulnerability number every now and again<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Pets.  Anyone else a little disappointed in their pet?  I was looking<br/>
 </span></blockquote>forward to my pet SO much, and then when couldn&#39;t cast it at 9th, bummed.<br/>
So 10th comes around, and I have a pet out all the time.  Because of the<br/>
half-level thing, I find one of two things:  Either you are in an area where<br/>
your pet can survive most of the time, and thus you are getting no xps, -OR-<br/>
You are in an area where you are getting xps, and because the MOBS are much<br/>
higher than your pet, they just get blown away.  Takes 2/3 of my mana, and<br/>
material components, and *piff*, there went Jananer.  So, often I run around<br/>
with no pet now, just because it almost doesn&#39;t seem worth it.  And because<br/>
of the train-ing factor, be careful if you plan to use them in a dungeon.<br/>
Best I can say, is that it almost replaces the warriors kick.  Except theirs<br/>
is built in, and they don&#39;t have to summon and control it, and then resummon<br/>
it, and then med and summon it again.  Is this what you all find at higher<br/>
levels as well, or does it get any better?<br/>
<br/>
I summon a pet, give him a weapon, and then sit him down off to the side.<br/>
Then use siphon to pull mobs and lure them back to where your pet is. Do NOT<br/>
let the pet tank, he&#39;s suicidal and likes to try to, but don&#39;t let him. Keep<br/>
the mob on you, and just let him whack away alongside you. He doesn&#39;t hit<br/>
very often, but it&#39;s better than nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What about spells, what do you all think are the main spells to buy when<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hit 15th, and then again at 22nd?  Any we should DEFINITELY get, and others<br/>
we should probably avoid?  How do you all best employ your spells?  I gave<br/>
you my pretty much standard routine, Siphon, Cloud, Sword, with the spells I<br/>
have available now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to know the answer to this one too.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>from time to time, see what&#39;s up.  Chris, you said you were on Povar, is<br/>
Barto your &#39;Knights name?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on Fennin Ro.<br/>
