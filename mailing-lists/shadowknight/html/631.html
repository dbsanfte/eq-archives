<div id="ygrps-yiv-200022958"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Wow just what I needed.. I just picked up the Boots and Gauntlets (had<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on the first kill) and was looking for the BP. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen the<br/>
&gt; Clockwork EXG though, where does it spawn??  (I&#39;ve only been in Soulesk A<br/>
&gt; for a day)..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really don&#39;t know where the EXG is. I spent over 50 hours in Sol A and<br/>
have never even SEEN that damn robot. I *think* she&#39;s in the pit. She&#39;s not<br/>
really a rare spawn, kinda like Drelzna (like a 50-50 chance or something).<br/>
But she&#39;s a larger-than-the-rest female robot. Or just ask if someone&#39;s<br/>
camping her and run around till you find them, then you&#39;ll know where she&#39;s<br/>
supposed to be. :)<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I got my bp through trade, I gave up on trying to find her... stupid<br/>
gnomes... (I traded an exec hood for it).<br/>
