<div id="ygrps-yiv-943657469">Welcome to High Difficulty, Cronik.  It is High difficulty for a reason.  Here are some answers to your questions.<br/>
<br/>
1)  Food, water, weapons.  Food & water can be purchased in Ogguk, Grobb, Neriak, or from other players (summoned or regular).  Guards in Ogguk & Neriak con Dubious, but merchants should be at least apprehensive and will sell to you.  Just stay away from the Tavern in Ogguk cause the cook there will KoS you.  (I worship Innoruuk so mileage may vary)  For weapons, your best are through quests or other players and combine weapons are a waste of money, IMHO.  For 2 Handed, do the bone chip quest in Grobb then sharpen the rusty 2 hander you get at the Ogguk forge (stones available in Grobb).  When you reach around 18th or 19th level, do the Grobb Cleaver quest from Carver C.  In between, try to buy a FS 2 Hander from another player.  I bought mine for 5p.  Use the money you saved on weapons to buy some good armor.  For 1 Handed, go with a mino axe (bought from another player).  Magic weapons should not be necessary for 1 handed as 2 hander should be your main weapon (use 1 handed only for skill building), but get Polished Granite Tomahawk if you want one.  <br/>
<br/>
2)  NPC&#39;s in S Ro will sell to you.  It heard that they have recently started carrying combine weapons, but I have not personally verified this.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

Hello all.<br/>
I play a 4th (almost 5th) level Shadow Knight Troll. I <br/>
plan on investing quite a bit in this character, but <br/>
want to know how to get food/water/weapons etc. <br/>
from &quot;good&quot; cities. The underground in Freeport doesn&#39;t <br/>
have any food vendors that I know of, nor does the Shady <br/>
Swashbuckler in the N.Ro tunnel to East Commons. <br/>
In Neriak I am &quot;looks at you dubiously&quot; but not KOS, and <br/>
I think I am KOS in Ogre-ville (I chose to worship Cazic <br/>
Thule). So that limits me to Grobb, RO and Commons, and ï¿½D<br/>
Neriak.<br/>
I won&#39;t even think of going to Faydwer for a long time. <br/>
Does the NPC merchant tents in South RO sell to Evil <br/>
race characters? I have seen it on a map of South Ro, <br/>
but haven&#39;t actually been out of Innuthule Swamp yet. My <br/>
wife did as her Troll, but hated playing it.<br/>
Another thing that worries me is that the Combine <br/>
Weapons sold by gypsies are not an option for a solo <br/>
player unless I get one at auction (which I am forced <br/>
into due to masive lag :( ) since they KOS me as well.<br/>
I enjoy the Troll, but need help to figure out a way <br/>
around these major milestones.<br/>
Any and all help is welcome.<br/>
