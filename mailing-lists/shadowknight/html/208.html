<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970166744">Overall, I am very happy with the Shadow Knight list of spells. There is only one thing that has been bothering me, which is that we don&#39;t get Gather Shadows until level 30. Rangers get there invisibility spell at level 15, which can also be cast on others unlike Gather Shadows, even though it is only outdoor. I definitely think that Shadow Knights are superior, but as we are evil, Gather Shadows should be a level 22 spell, if not level 15. Has this been bugging anyone else?<br/>

I have been working on it for a while today, and it has been coming along nicely!</div>
