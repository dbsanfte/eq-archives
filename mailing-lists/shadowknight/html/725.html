&gt; Let me ask this -- if Vampiric Embrace was replaced with a Lifetap, would that be considered an improvement?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is one of the spells I actually like.  As a DE, my Dex is high<br/>
enough to proc it sometimes 5 times in a long fight, at 16 damage<br/>
a pop = 80 damage/heal if I switch to my one hand.  I&#39;ve done it <br/>
6 or 7 before with dex buff and quicknesss on.  I don&#39;t know how<br/>
effective the different lifetaps are, but it almost seems that vamp<br/>
embrace was meant for us, since it requires melee.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone play a necro and know the damage/heal for each of the<br/>
lifetap line?<br/>
