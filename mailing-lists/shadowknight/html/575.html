&gt; That quest for the axe... I wield a 2Haxe right now that<br/>
&gt; I bought off a merchant, is it worth the quest? Does it<br/>
&gt; give XP/cash/magical axe? Who starts it and where are<br/>
&gt; they located?<br/>
&gt; What level is the head mushroom in Innothule Swamp?<br/>
&gt; Anyone do the Kukulk Helm quest?<br/>
&gt; Any other quests out there that a newbie SK can do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, missed your questions first time around:<br/>
<br/>
Which axe quest? The grobb cleaver is the one I know of. It is a great<br/>
weapon, but you have to kill a lvl 20 NPC (he&#39;s not too tough, though ... a<br/>
lvl 20 enchanter and I (lvl 20 at th etime) wiped the floor with him).<br/>
<br/>
The Hukulk Helm quest gets you the, duh, Hukulk Helm. It&#39;s not bad ....<br/>
think it gives some +str too. It makes you lose faction with the indigo<br/>
brotherhood, however, so if you are not careful you will become KoS in the<br/>
inner two parts of Neriak. A SK can do it at least once without becoming KoS<br/>
(a warrior can&#39;t ... my friend found out the hard way) but it wouldn&#39;t hurt<br/>
to raise your indigo brotherhood faction first (give LT caps to, umm, Narex<br/>
V&#39;tam I think his name is. THe guy in chainmail in the warrior guild in<br/>
Neriak commons.).<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what other quests. I&#39;ll write more if I think of more. You can<br/>
check the underground of Freeport, too, but none of those give anything<br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
later,<br/>
