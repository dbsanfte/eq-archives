<b>Subject:</b> Where to fight?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133069699">I am a Lvl 10 SK and I haven&#39;t played him for a while cause i can&#39;t find a<br/>
good place to fight.  I either die a lot or get barely any exp.  I do like to<br/>
group but I seem to only get one for like 1/2 at a time and it is hard to find<br/>
a group for such a short time and I hate leaving people in tough areas when I<br/>
leave.  Any help would be great.  I don&#39;t mind traveling either so any<br/>
suggestions will help. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
