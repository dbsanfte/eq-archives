<b>Subject:</b> Unholy Swords vs. Holy Swords <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256236561">I have seen some of the stats for our Unholy sword, the Dark Reaver, which is presumably our best weapon. It has stats of 20 and 42, with a strength sapping spell. This is a 2 handed weapon as far as I know. However, the FIRST Paladin Holy sword is Ghoulbane, which is 1 handed and has 15 damage and 34 speed, not to mention casting Dismiss Undead. Does this seem a little unbalanced to anyone else? I am not sure that the Dark Reaver is our best weapon, but the stats I am sure of. One handed weapons are usually not that close in power to 2 handed weapons. Anyone else can clarify this issue for me?<br/>
