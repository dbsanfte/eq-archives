Abjuration!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, maybe I goofed on this one, but can anyone tell me the fastest way to<br/>
increase Abjuration? I spent 20 minutes last night casting Prot. vs. Cold on<br/>
myself and everyone that came into the Neriak bank last night and I only<br/>
increased the skill by maybe 4 points.<br/>
My Trolls Int is a 65 (that is with holding the Grobb Cleaver!). Would you<br/>
suggest spending training points in it or waiting to train other skill like<br/>
Parry next level and Double Attack at 20th?<br/>
<br/>
What you were doing works, your int is just unspeakably low and that&#39;ll slow<br/>
it the hell down.<br/>
My DE gained (around this, I&#39;m not 100% sure) the first 20 points on the<br/>
first 25 or so casts.<br/>
<br/>
I feel sorry for you when the time comes to train evoke for your ward spells<br/>
at 22 =)<br/>
