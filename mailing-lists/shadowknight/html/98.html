<b>Subject:</b> Re: Concerns With SK Class <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-886386244">The pets we get , even though relatively weak, i have no complaints<br/>
about.<br/>
And i was never insinuating that Harm Touch should kill anything in one<br/>
hit. And if you count on HT to beat anything you attack, you get what<br/>
you deserve. BUT, thats no excuse for it not working, in my opinion. If<br/>
it works to its full potential and you still die, which has happened to<br/>
me, then so be it. But it should be something you can count on to at<br/>
least work when an emergency arises.<br/>
And in no way am i saying that SKs are powerless or have no potential.<br/>
However HT still is not the equal of LoH which its supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of our differences of opinion on this, i would like to know<br/>
what you feel would be an effective way to bring our concerns to the<br/>
Dev team, whatever they may be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for responding,<br/>

&gt; Ok, I can see your point with the Harm Touch.<br/>
&gt; However, I&#39;m at level 14 now and I<br/>
&gt; gave up usuing Harm Touch for anything but emergancy<br/>
&gt; purposes. Either to save<br/>
&gt; myself or as the mother of all taunts to save<br/>
&gt; someone else. If I don&#39;t think I can<br/>
&gt; win with my sword then I don&#39;t fight, I never think<br/>
&gt; well if I HT it, it will be an<br/>
&gt; even fight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We must also remmeber that we get a pet. Woopee Doo!<br/>
&gt; You might think, it&#39;s a crap<br/>
&gt; one. But it does server many great uses. First, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; an extra attack during<br/>
&gt; battle, somewhat makingup for our lack of Duel<br/>
&gt; Wield. It&#39;s a great way to get rid<br/>
&gt; of those annoying rusty short swords, since it makes<br/>
&gt; the pet more effective. And<br/>
&gt; alos, it is a great delaying and early warning<br/>
&gt; device. My pet has saved me from<br/>
&gt; giants on a number of times.<br/>
