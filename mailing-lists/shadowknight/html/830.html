<b>Subject:</b> RE: Lookin fer fletchie kit in Grobb <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-843980896">The closest place to get fletchie kits, my green friend, is to travel to the<br/>
Centaur Camp in  the southern plains of Karana. It is a large place but if<br/>
you travel north and east until you near the river you will find it. Beware<br/>
of the aviaks that inhabit this realm however as they do not like trolls for<br/>
some odd reason. I&#39;m not sure if it has anything to do with the fact that<br/>
when you are older you will eat them or not? Anyways, if get to the river,<br/>
you&#39;ve gone too far (loc of camp is 200, -2300 because I know how much of a<br/>
pain in the arse it can be to find). The fletchie kits should be around 1<br/>
plat or 2 (probably closer to 2 for you, my charismatic friend). The Centaur<br/>
has a name and is in one of the four centaur houses there. He also sells<br/>
equipment for bowyery for when you decide to take up that trade.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you large one<br/>
