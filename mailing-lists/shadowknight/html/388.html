Keep using your bow and you&#39;ll see your archery improving.  Mine went to 16<br/>
(I think I put 2-3 practice points into it) in a little over 8 hours of<br/>
play time.  I also lucked out and found a rough hickory recurve bow (only<br/>
8g!) from the fletching shop.  I have the same question about fletching<br/>
supplies -- currently the only places that I know about that sell all<br/>
pieces are in <br/>
<br/>
1) Surefall Glade (I know for sure the book is available here) and <br/>
2) Kelethin<br/>
<br/>
both of which are KOS for us (unless perhaps you kill a lot of gnolls in<br/>
BlackBurrow?).<br/>
<br/>
Rather than resorting to a mule (I do have another character that fletches<br/>
and is a ranger of Surefall), I thought I might be able to make a business<br/>
partnership with someone who could go to either of these places.  Of<br/>
course, I&#39;d have to find someone willing to deal with such a dark soul as<br/>
myself - which might be difficult.  Still, I would be very happy to hear if<br/>
anyone knows whether arrow components are available in the other dark cities.<br/>

:)And still haven&#39;t gotten any<br/>
:)movement/improvement out of my Archery skill.  And now looking for Fletching<br/>
:)supplies in Netrick to build my own Arrows/Bows.<br/>
:)<br/>
:)Does any one know where the book for Fletching is and/or the supplies are<br/>
:)(found some behind the mushroom inn) or do I have to go to another city,<br/>
:)hopefully evil because I am KOS anymore at Freeport, and of course the<br/>
:)vendors wouldn&#39;t talk to me anyway?  Any ideas or do I have to make (don&#39;t<br/>
:)want to do this) a mule character to get the items (still can&#39;t believe they<br/>
:)didn&#39;t make the tools available to us at the bow shop). I have searched and<br/>
:)haven&#39;t found it, I will look again tonight, maybe I missed someone.<br/>
