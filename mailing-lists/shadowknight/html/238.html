<b>Subject:</b> we need a foothold on faydwer! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-630458079">at eq.stratics.com someone has started a petition to put a small city<br/>
accessible to evil folk inside crushbone. this would provide us evil folk<br/>
with at least ONE safe place to bind on that entire continent, and rest up<br/>
after beating on all the goodie goodies. also, the petition asks for either<br/>
an alternate method of travelling from antonica to faydwer and back, or<br/>
making the docks in butcherblock safer. (waiting for a half hour on the dock<br/>
for the boat is more or less death to an evil person ;(). if you think any<br/>
of this is a good idea, email them at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kurthau@...">kurthau@...</a> and let em know<br/>
you think this is a good idea, and later they will send a list of all the<br/>
people they got to verant with the intent of having this implemented. wether<br/>
it&#39;ll work or not? who knows. but at least they&#39;ll have to listen to us ;)<br/>
they cant repress evil forever you know! *rant*<br/>
