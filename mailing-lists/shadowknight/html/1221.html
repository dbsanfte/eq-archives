<div id="ygrps-yiv-141086571">I am looking for concrete information on stats.  Anyone have any web sights,<br/>
etc where this is discussed in detail?<br/>
I am mainly wondering about Dextarity. I have heard it does nothing but help<br/>
weapons proc, others say it helps you hit. Anyone know for sure? I am<br/>
wondering which way to go with equipment. Str,dex or agility.... Is a 200<br/>
str with a dex of 70 worthless? Is dex worthless? Is agility better than<br/>
both of them?<br/>
