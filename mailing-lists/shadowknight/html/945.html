&gt; Okay ... where are Dwarven Workboots? Unrest, right? Any idea where? In that<br/>
&gt; basement? I&#39;ve been to unrest exactly one time but as soon as my wizzie<br/>
&gt; friend hits 29 I&#39;m insisting that my group go there (fyi I play with a group<br/>
&gt; of RL friends so we all play together) and kill stuff. The tail end of the<br/>
&gt; group is a 22 cleric though so we are kinda spread out. (30 will be<br/>
&gt; uber-hell for me as I&#39;ve promised to stop leveling for a while and help them<br/>
&gt; catch up. :) Feign Death will be nice for that).<br/>

are really nice if you haven&#39;t seen the stats yet.  I think they<br/>
are AC 8 +3 STR, +5 DEX.  I traded a plat ring of opolla I found <br/>
in a store in Qeynos (cost me 3pp!) for them and a screaming mace.<br/>
