 I am new to this, so plz no flames. :)<br/>
Ok, I have noticed that when scanning the list of <br/>
available spells, there is no real pattern besides the <br/>
pets and the Darkness line.  By that I mean you don&#39;t <br/>
see the entire line of spells.  <br/>
I never use my pet and consider it a waste of bone chips.<br/>
Also Dark Empathy sucks.  The amount of HPs transfered <br/>
is minimal at 22nd level to really make a difference. Or <br/>
am I wrong since I haven&#39;t reached that level yet?<br/>
I would like to see a line of spells if given be <br/>
progressed to the endlike the Darkness line.  <br/>
ie. Disease Cloud, Aura Line, Damage Shields, Poison <br/>
Bolt Line, Undead DD  and Charm spells.  I would much <br/>
rather have a Charm Undead spell than a Pet spell.<br/>
<br/>
Why not give SKs the ability to gate?  <br/>
Level 22: Remove Dark Empathy<br/>
          Enable Self Gate<br/>
Level 39: Remove Shield Skin (does it really do a        <br/>
          whole lot at that high a level?  Does it even <br/>
          absorb 1 hit from a creature? This goes on <br/>
          the assumption that the site I visited had <br/>
          good info: 100 HPs buff)<br/>
          Enable Bind Affinity (at this level who would <br/>
          be jealous?)<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts.<br/>
If I am way of base, let me know, but I have no <br/>
experience with these higher spells and how well they <br/>
actually work solo or in group.<br/>
