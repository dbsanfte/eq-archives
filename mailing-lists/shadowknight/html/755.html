<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718064416">Okie dokie, seems like getting a consensus is NOT going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s try another approach: what WOULD you like to see about the class to<br/>
make it more viable?  The reason the high level shields and DoTs were pulled<br/>
is because (believe it or not) a lot of the players here are SKs and as such<br/>
know the class real well and giving them those capabilities made them into,<br/>
literally, tank mages.  It&#39;s a scary sight seeing these guys at work.<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve stated before, the thing that hurts the SK class are primarily race<br/>
issues -- a damage shield on a human or DE SK is not unbalancing, however it<br/>
IS unbalanced if you put it on a troll or ogre SK.<br/>
<br/>
So what can be changed that makes the class more viable for non-big-races<br/>
but at the same time is not unbalancing for trolls/ogres?<br/>
<br/>
I know HT comes up a lot, but there is a fear that HT could end up being<br/>
heavily abused (worst nightmare....party of 6 50th level SKs stand around<br/>
Mr. Named Mob that only pops once a day anyway, BAM 3000HP gone instantly<br/>
and you now have a mob that starts the fight at 1/2 HP).<br/>
<br/>
If HT was upped slightly, had a slightly higher recharge rate, etc...what<br/>
are your suggestions?<br/>
