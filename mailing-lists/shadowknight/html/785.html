<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-764363946">Swap the following spells:<br/>
<br/>
Rank 1 - replace Reclaim Energy with Lifetap<br/>
Rank 2 - replace Mend Bones with  Lifespike<br/>
Rank 3 - adjust damage of Vampiric Embrace to be in line with damage caused when necro casts it. (24 pts of damage for the 60 mana it costs to cast is really bad).<br/>
Rank 4 - replace Voice Graft with Lifedraw<br/>
Rank 5 - replace Shieldskin with Siphon Life<br/>
Rank 6 - Add (yes, add, we only have 6 spells at this rank, some of questionable or specific usefulness) either Spirit Tap or Vampiric Curse<br/>
<br/>
Other desired change:  allow us to get Gather Shadows earlier.  Hiding is part of a SK&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
Most desired spell:  Bind Affinity.  I know this will never happen as all the other fighter classes will be up in arms about it if you did.  My reasons are threefold:  1) SK&#39;s have terrible KoS problems, 2) SK&#39;s have serious exp penalties, 3) SK&#39;s are a devious and sneaky bunch.  This is an attempt to balance the exp and KoS problems of the class.  Let me set the record straight.  Being KoS and having high exp penalties are part of the class, I don&#39;t find fault in that, they come with the job.  BUT, when I do die (which is more often than any other class), I usually have to run across 4 to 5 zones just to retrieve my stuff.  That is just wasted real and game time and the thing that turns me off the most about SK&#39;s.  I don&#39;t hate dying because it will take me another 2 hours to get the exp back.  I hate dying because I know I have to run for 20 minutes to even start the 2 hours.  Hell, sell some bind affinity potions and let everyone use them.  Just let me bind outside the dungeon (I live in dungeons anyways, not cities), it&#39;s safer.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if the Lifetap series is well suited for a warrior/caster (too slow and/or too weak), but it is much better than the fluff that we have now.<br/>

PS I&#39;m pissed cause my ISP dropped me just as I was saving a friend from getting trained and am most likely dead now (i.e. load game...run for 20 minutes...finally start to play game).  Goblin wizard is hit for 221 non-melee damage...Server not responding...<br/>

Okie dokie, seems like getting a consensus is NOT going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s try another approach: what WOULD you like to see about the class to<br/>
make it more viable?  The reason the high level shields and DoTs were pulled<br/>
is because (believe it or not) a lot of the players here are SKs and as such<br/>
know the class real well and giving them those capabilities made them into,<br/>
literally, tank mages.  It&#39;s a scary sight seeing these guys at work.<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve stated before, the thing that hurts the SK class are primarily race<br/>
issues -- a damage shield on a human or DE SK is not unbalancing, however it<br/>
IS unbalanced if you put it on a troll or ogre SK.<br/>
<br/>
So what can be changed that makes the class more viable for non-big-races<br/>
but at the same time is not unbalancing for trolls/ogres?<br/>
<br/>
I know HT comes up a lot, but there is a fear that HT could end up being<br/>
heavily abused (worst nightmare....party of 6 50th level SKs stand around<br/>
Mr. Named Mob that only pops once a day anyway, BAM 3000HP gone instantly<br/>
and you now have a mob that starts the fight at 1/2 HP).<br/>
<br/>
If HT was upped slightly, had a slightly higher recharge rate, etc...what<br/>
are your suggestions?<br/>
