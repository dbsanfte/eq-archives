<div id="ygrps-yiv-887612200">To brian and everyone else,<br/>
<br/>
How about we just make VE as powerful as the very same<br/>
necro spell is... I know that a necro around level 18<br/>
can tap for like 30 dmg+... Ve maybe goes off 3 times<br/>
a fight in cazic unless i have the shaman buff on(i am<br/>
DE)  i am not sure what the level the upgrades to VE<br/>
are for the necros but if they are level appropriate<br/>
for our levels (i.e. half) we should get those soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Some more suggestions for spells.  <br/>
<br/>
After level 22 take away our pet spells becuase the<br/>
last time i used my pet was in south karana but now i<br/>
am cazic and i don&#39;t use it(i always joke with my<br/>
groups that i am gonna summon my pet and they go crazy<br/>
on me) and give us some other spell, maybe damage<br/>
shield or lifetap.<br/>
<br/>
GIVE US BACK BLOOD BOIL AND BANSHE AURA...rangers have<br/>
a 6 damage shield at 30 why can&#39;t we, the tank masters<br/>
of damage, have banshee aura(8 damage) at 30 or 39 i<br/>
forgot what level it was. i know this spell went<br/>
research only but maybe you could make an sk only<br/>
version of the spell.... also about replacing blood<br/>
boil with dooming darkness i can see myself saying<br/>
this to my group <br/>
<br/>
&quot;guys don&#39;t root, snare, or anything cause my level 20<br/>
something necro dot that gets resisted all the<br/>
time(from what i&#39;ve heard) gets cancelled by those<br/>
spells&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And our level 49 ultra vision and underwater breathing<br/>
spells do need to be either at an earlier time or<br/>
removed i mean come on those spells are like level<br/>
10-20 enchanter spells and we have to wait to get to<br/>
49 to get them and then they suck anyway.<br/>
