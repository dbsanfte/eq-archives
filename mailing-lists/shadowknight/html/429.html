Subject: [shadowknight] a bunch of questions<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since the list is dead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was watching the auctions last night on the newly edited Jewelry items<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; saw someone selling a AC1 +5hp +5mana ring of some kind for 10pp.  Does<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; one know of any item(s) that would allow us to regenerate hp faster ...<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; a troll, me not being one of course.  I would assume that the +5hp is not<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; regeneration just adds 5hp to someone which to me (and I would think a lot<br/>
&gt; of higher level players) is worthless along with the mana, and I already<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; AC1 from my cutthroat rings without the 10pp cost.<br/>
<br/>
*nods, wish my necro had it though*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, did anyone find out about the &quot;Bind ring&quot; that is in the Necro/SK<br/>
&gt; guild house, or is that a broken quest also?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a full suit of leather armor.  I was just wondering what is the<br/>
&gt; proper order of increase that the armor should be?  I think I have it as:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Leather<br/>
&gt; Banded<br/>
&gt; Chain<br/>
&gt; Bronze Plate<br/>
&gt; Plate<br/>
&gt;<br/>
*ermm, your proper order will be*<br/>
leather<br/>
banded<br/>
Bronze plate<br/>
Rubicite (which i think  offers those regen properties u seek)<br/>
&gt; I have no clue if I am missing something.  I need to get to the next<br/>
level,<br/>
&gt; and don&#39;t think I can do it without getting better armor (which would be<br/>
&gt; banded if I am correct).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have heard rumors about killing so many residents of Befallen that you<br/>
&gt; eventually can&#39;t get into our guild with out a KOS from the ghouls<br/>
outside,<br/>
&gt; with out casting inv to undead.  Is this true or false or don&#39;t know.  I<br/>
&gt; consider the ghouls and they con warmly to me right now, not sure what<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; means other than they aren&#39;t going to attack me right now.<br/>
&quot;*i think they are rumours, only faction i have seen is against befallen*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Should I be hunting in Befallen ... alone?  (I really don&#39;t care about the<br/>
&gt; above, as long as the npc inside don&#39;t attack me along with their pets).<br/>
&gt; And can I get armor their for free off the SK&#39;s in the back?  Just a note<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; hate rabies.  And I guess does anyone know of an item (Jewelry) that would<br/>
&gt; protect me/us from disease, a 100% would be nice?<br/>
&gt; *nope* *just keep that invis to undead on till ya find what your looking<br/>
for*<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And that is about it for now.  I am sure I will have more questions<br/>
later...<br/>
&gt; if the list goes dead again :)<br/>
*hope I was sme help*<br/>
