<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288570494">I agree, everyone running around as DE is pretty lame, since me and my wife<br/>
only play evil races, I dont like it either. I do hate it for the large<br/>
races because of the size thing... Hopefully they make up for this some<br/>
way.. Depending on 1 class for shrink just sucks..<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think the change sucks, from the perspective of a large race. Many<br/>
&gt; &gt; dungeons are bugged, cant even walk into sola, get back down the stairs<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; unrest, etc. This change hurts the large races bad, and came way too<br/>
late,<br/>
&gt; &gt; atfer everyone and the brother done got it. Now large races are<br/>
dependent on<br/>
&gt; &gt; shamans to enter the dungeons. Sucks to depend on 1 class. Maybe they<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; &gt; throw out a shrink type item, course prob require getting a rare pop off<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; dragon or something. I also feel like all the real cool items are gone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Manastones, guise, jboots, etc. On the older servers so many people<br/>
already<br/>
&gt; &gt; have these, and the ogrew that got there late will have to stand and<br/>
shout<br/>
&gt; &gt; will pay for shrink at the dungeon entrance, while other people just<br/>
click<br/>
&gt; &gt; on there mask. I am sure you smaller race shadowknights like the change<br/>
&gt; &gt; though.... Dont see why they waited 9 months to do it....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a DESK, but ready to sign any petition for shrink potions available<br/>
&gt; at potion shops at a reasonable price, and/or the inclusion of a<br/>
&gt; clickable or wearable shrinking item.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; IMO, if size is the problem, there are better ways to fix it then<br/>
&gt; turning into a DE.  A wearable all/all ring of shrink (or at least<br/>
&gt; BAR,TRL,OGR) would be an ideal solution, but lets just hope they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; make it nodrop and in Sol A =)<br/>
