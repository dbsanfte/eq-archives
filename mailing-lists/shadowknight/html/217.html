<div id="ygrps-yiv-988994840">I would like more of the specifics, what race were you for example?  How <br/>
about your stats, things like that could make a world of difference, for <br/>
example through all my experience with a shadowknight I found human SKs the <br/>
weakest of all.  Dunno, why but it seems that way to me.   I believe that <br/>
troll is the best, but thats just a personal opinion.  Also, don&#39;t expect to <br/>
be the complete asskicker, you gotta have some understanding that maybe he <br/>
just had some better spell, or was lucky.  Things like that make a huge <br/>
difference as well.<br/>

&gt;Okay.. Imagine you duel a Druid one level higher than you. He flat beats <br/>
&gt;yer ass.. harm touch does hack and his screaming macer is beatin yer ass <br/>
&gt;while yer shiny brass halberd is doin 3 pts of damage. Silly..<br/>
&gt;I have almost a full suit of bronze.. 17th lev.. Shint brass halb, Derv <br/>
&gt;rings, spiked collar. I think that sk&#39;s ar HORRRIBLY dicked after this <br/>
&gt;duel.. No only was it not close.. it was humiliating. Verant better do <br/>
&gt;something or else shadowknights are gona die out. Especially when my HT <br/>
&gt;does about 40pts at 17th level to an `18 level pc.<br/>
&gt;i am Disgusted<br/>
