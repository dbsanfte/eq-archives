Freeport sewers, but yuo found that out already.<br/>
<br/>
Couple &#39;o other things for you, though -- Spore Guardian. This is an<br/>
extremely rare spawn. In al the time I&#39;ve played I&#39;ve heard of him appearing<br/>
ONCE. (I&#39;m sure it has happened plenty more than that, but I heard it happen<br/>
merely once). He appears in a line straight out or so from Guk. Don&#39;t know<br/>
what level he is.<br/>
<br/>
The troll in the OOT ... he&#39;s lvl 20. So don&#39;t bother to try him yet. Also,<br/>
be sure to get off the boat on the way BACK from Butcherblock, not on the<br/>
way. The rocks are different rocks (as I found out to my dismay when I leapt<br/>
off the boat). He isn&#39;t too tough for a lvl 20, though.<br/>
<br/>
Dwarves --- kill lots and lots of goblins. I&#39;ve killed lots of dwarves,<br/>
though, so I don&#39;t think I can ever get into Dwarf town, or Rivervale,<br/>
either, since I have killed millions upon millions of halflings. Muhahahar.<br/>
