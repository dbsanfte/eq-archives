&gt; I havent done ne thing to this board since... a couple years ago? ;)<br/>
&gt; Heh, I started this, then I had to quit cause of &quot;groundation&quot;, lol,<br/>
&gt; and I never came back.  I forgot all about this message board and<br/>
&gt; just let it be, little to be known to grow into a huge community.  So<br/>
&gt; If NE1 wants to be moderator for this board read the below.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would like these requirements:<br/>
&gt; 1.Gotta be one kewl/nice person, heheh<br/>
&gt; 2.Gotta be the man in EQ for Shadowknights<br/>
&gt; 3.Suck up, lol, jk, dont do that!<br/>

&gt; 1.Email me directly<br/>
&gt; 2.Say stuff why I should pick you<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just so you know, the SK board I run has a pretty decent turnout,<br/>
and most of the &quot;High profile&quot; SKs read it and/or post regularly.<br/>
If you&#39;d rather send people over here, we already get anywhere from<br/>
a dozen to fifty posts a day, and usually good stuff (i.e. not many<br/>
class gripes)  The stratics message board, moderated by Paragon the<br/>
Black, is also a very good SK board.<br/>
