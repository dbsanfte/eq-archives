<div id="ygrps-yiv-992331433">The Troll in OOT is 19 or 20th level, but surprisingly weak for that level of MOB.  You have to do the locker part of the quest as the locker contains the recipe.  The locker will actually raise faction.  I think the same faction that will suffer when you kill him, so killing him should be a wash faction wise.  And yes, I was able to give Carver C. the stuff despite him conning dubious to me.  There is no way that I know of that will raise faction with either the Ogres or Trolls when you can&#39;t do their quests.  <br/>

I saw a post this morning that said the Troll in OOT is <br/>
between 20-24th level MOB. It also siad that getting the <br/>
Recipe from the Troll (by killing it) lowered faction <br/>
with DaBashers and Shadow Knights of Grobb.  /con Carver <br/>
before you kill Nerbilik and see what you con to him. <br/>
Try to get your faction up to about Amiable if not <br/>
already (ie indifferant). This way the faction hits will <br/>
not prevent you from getting the Cleaver.  The poster <br/>
said he gave the Cleaver with a /con of dubious.<br/>
What raises Faction with Grobb SKs and DaBashers?<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you need to do the locker part of the <br/>
quest or not. Anyone?<br/>
