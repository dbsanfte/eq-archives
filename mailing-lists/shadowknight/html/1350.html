&gt;3) Yes, killing wood elf slaves raises indigo brotherhood faction, but<br/>
&gt;killing high elf slaves raises The Dead faction. I personally spent 5 days<br/>
&gt;there, many hours a day, killing those elves until I could do the quests in<br/>
&gt;the house of the dead to raise my faction up. It took a long time but was<br/>
&gt;worth it in the end.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES! Woohoo! Thanks for that update! I assume Crushbone Orcs KoS everboby.<br/>
AllaKhazam says killing Eriolissi Sisters, and Jyle Windshot (assume the one<br/>
in Freeport) increase faction in Crushbone.<br/>
<br/>
That gives me 3 more questions.<br/>
1) What level are the Highelf (or any for that matter) slaves?<br/>
2) What level are the Eriolissi Sisters in OOT? (lowest and what are of the<br/>
island?)<br/>
3) What level is Jyle?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
