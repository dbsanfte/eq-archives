<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465540392">Hello All,<br/>
This is my first post to the list and I have only recently become<br/>
interested in the ShadowKnight class.<br/>
I started an Erudite SK with a vision of a shield and sword combo.  I&#39;m<br/>
learning that starting a character<br/>
with a vision can be quite disappointing!  My efforts to find a nifty<br/>
magical sword (1H Slash) have actually<br/>
been the thing that has met with disappointment, the character himself is<br/>
quite interesting and fun to<br/>
play/ role-play. At any rate, I was wondering if I am just overlooking<br/>
something....  Are there ANY 1H Slash<br/>
SK specific weapons that don&#39;t come from the Planes?  I have been watching<br/>
reports come out Kunark,<br/>
and it would seem that NPCs there are only capable of dropping 2H Slash or<br/>
2H Blunt weapons<br/>
(perhaps only a SLIGHT exaggeration :) ).  Failing SK specific weapons,<br/>
what would the recommendation be?<br/>
...and sadly, a SS:Ykesha is going to be quite out of my grasp for a<br/>
while....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
