<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262835699">Ok here was what we did and the result of our attempt<br/>
to do the quest starting with the messengers letter<br/>
from west comm.<br/>
<br/>
1. Gave note to the Guild Master (GM from now on).<br/>
2. Got the Lady Shea quest.<br/>
He doesnt respond to the key words [Bayle List] that<br/>
he gives. So either its broken, or they are meant for<br/>
someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Ok here is where things get messy.<br/>
As we all know when you kill Shea in the Inn she<br/>
doesnt drop the note. So while invis, a friend heard<br/>
her tell her bodyguard to watch her things while she<br/>
goes down stairs. Hmm..does he have the note? Kill his<br/>
sorry dwarven butt. No letter. Aww.<br/>
<br/>
Lets try this. Even though she is &quot;threatening&quot; to us,<br/>
we are all too high of a level for her to attack us.<br/>
So we do what the Pallies are supposed to do. Get her<br/>
drunk. Its works..YAY! She tells us about the  Qeynos<br/>
Guard who took the letter from her. Just so happens i<br/>
know where he is. Off to High Pass.<br/>
Found him. He doesnt respond to anything we say except<br/>
&quot;What is the Bayle List&quot;. But he only says that he<br/>
doesnt know what we&#39;re talking about and tells us to<br/>
stop irritating him.<br/>
So we kill him. Easy, but the faction hits we take are<br/>
bad. Turns out he is a Corrupt guard. Bloodsabers,<br/>
Corrupt guards, Commander Kane all drop. BLAH!!<br/>
<br/>
But we get a page (Lore, No Drop). We are assuming<br/>
that is the Bayle List. And a rolled up letter which<br/>
appears to be written in either code or another<br/>
language, because it was all gibberish.<br/>
<br/>
So go back to Freeport to visit the GM. Give him both.<br/>
He says &quot;Whatever&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
AWWW<br/>
<br/>
Now here are some educated, and maybe some<br/>
not-so-educated, guesses.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that we actually need to get all 3(?)<br/>
pieces of the Bayle List and turn it in instead of<br/>
just the one part that Shea had taken from her.<br/>
<br/>
And we have no idea what the coded letter is for.<br/>
<br/>
Now heres some random questions for anyone out there.<br/>
<br/>
Since we are actually told to kill Shea to get the<br/>
List, does anyone know if she spawns anywhere other<br/>
than that Inn? Obviously at that point she doesnt have<br/>
it, because it was taken from her. So i was wondering<br/>
if there was a point where she still has it, maybe in<br/>
a different spot, or different time of day, before its<br/>
taken. Then we can kill her and get it.<br/>
<br/>
Now if thats a no go, is there a way to get it from<br/>
Dayllin without killing him. Thats a whole lot of<br/>
faction i dont want to lose (Kane hates me enough as<br/>
it is due to all that Trumpy killing i did). Are there<br/>
any keywords or mini-quests  that anyone knows of that<br/>
would get him to cough up his part of the list.<br/>
I am willing to kill him to get it, but i would rather<br/>
not if i dont have to.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as the rest of the list. I heard thru the<br/>
grapevine that anothe piece of it is on a mammoth<br/>
somewhere. The 3rd as far as ive heard hasnt been<br/>
found. But i havent dug deep into other sites yet.<br/>
If anyone has any knowledge of any of these please<br/>
feel free to share it :)<br/>
