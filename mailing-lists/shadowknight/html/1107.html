<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034506513">Actually, I am a 33rd level DE sk, and with my reaver I do between 55<br/>
and 60 max, my strength with the sword buff is only around 125 or so,<br/>
now I was grouping with a troll SK the other day, and her strength was<br/>
near 200, and she was whacking for about 80 points max, now while this<br/>
is a hug diffeerence in strength, it does show that it does count.<br/>

&gt; Str and Stamina do not seem to have any REALLY great noticable<br/>

&gt; havent.Course Troll regen is nice for soloing, shrug. Not complaining,<br/>
&gt; just STR doesnt seem to have the affect for warrior types as it has on<br/>
&gt; other muds or roleplaying games. I guess the slam advantage is ok when<br/>
&gt; your fighting casters. Not sure its worth all the racial penalties<br/>
&gt; though, heh. Least they got shrink now...8) Morgul </span></blockquote></div>
