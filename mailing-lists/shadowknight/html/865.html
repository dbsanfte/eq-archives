&gt; I think the Militia leader is Sir Lucan.  You can increase your faction with<br/>
&gt; the militia by killing Deathfist orcs or the Paladins of North freeport<br/>
&gt; (most fun!)  You can get to north freeport via the tunnels.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which part of Freeport is Sir Lucan in?  I can travel freely in North<br/>
Freeport, but I assume he is not there, since that is Pally land.  I<br/>
think once upon a time I could travel in Freeport, but then I discovered<br/>
Krazen Loosh...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So I have heard, but I want to do all the steps so I can see if <br/>
there&#39;s some hint in there someone has missed.<br/>
