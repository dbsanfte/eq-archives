<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441310881">I can tell you that my wood elf druid character started out as indifferent<br/>
to the stormguard and quickly became amiable when i kiiled a few dozen orcs<br/>
and goblins.  Whether you can become non-kos or not remains to be seen, but<br/>
this would depend on your level since your max faction increases as your<br/>
level increases.  Some of you who have adventured around blackburrow might<br/>
have noticed that eventually Holly Windstalker (or maybe Cros Treewind - i<br/>
cant remember) becomes indifferent if you have killed enough gnolls.  This<br/>
happened for me around level 10.<br/>
<br/>
I also saw a necro jump ship today in the butcherblock zone to avoid the<br/>
guards and he was in the 20&#39;s.  I would assume then that it may take quite a<br/>
while to raise your faction.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to mention how much faster my druid has leveled than my sk.<br/>
Maybe this is becuase he is my third character and I have more experience<br/>
playing the game, but I started a week ago and I am level 9 already.  Seems<br/>
like it took twice as long to make it that far as a human sk.  Playing a<br/>
shadowknight is fun but there really is a serious penalty.<br/>

&gt; can anyone verify wether or not the dwarven guards throughout the<br/>
&gt; butcherblock mountains are aligned with the stormguard? if so, there IS a<br/>
&gt; valid way for us evil folk to survive that area without invis. if you kill<br/>
&gt; runnyeye goblins and several of the monsters that frequent the gorge of<br/>
king<br/>
&gt; xorbb, your faction with the stormguard will increase (as well as the<br/>
&gt; guardians of the vale, who guard misty thicket and rivervale). if this<br/>
&gt; works, even an evil person will be able to travel most places in<br/>
&gt; butcherblock provided they go genocidal on gobbies before they make the<br/>
&gt; trip. however, i still dont reccomend trying to get into kaladim, since<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; goblins dont raise faction with any of the other groups of dwarves. so...<br/>
&gt; does anybody know for sure if this will work?<br/>
