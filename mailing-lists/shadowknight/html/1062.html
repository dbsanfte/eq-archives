<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399505682">First of all with the new patch has anybody checked the stats on the Dark<br/>
Forged armor (and hopefully they change the color as well)?<br/>
<br/>
On the rumor front, supposedly the Fiery Avenger has been found. Rumored<br/>
stats on sword 33Dmg 33Dly Effect: Combust (180dmg DD or so) Paladin Only.<br/>
Now I don&#39;t mind that the Paladin&#39;s get a really nice weapon, what gets me<br/>
is that they can obtain their nice weapons through Quest. I would much<br/>
rather obtain a kick ass weapon from questing (not camping, but an actual<br/>
quest) than having to kill a god (Soul Leech, what&#39;s with the 50pt lifetap<br/>
though???). Well I guess I&#39;ll just have to wait and see if the weapon really<br/>
does exist.. And who knows maybe the SK&#39;s have some kick ass sword available<br/>
by a quest (About the same odds as me winning the lottery without buying a<br/>
ticket).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy..<br/>
