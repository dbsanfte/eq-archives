<b>Subject:</b> Brian: Your help is needed for and SK related issue <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227442077">Ok, I can understand the non-SK related topics not being <br/>
answered. That doesn&#39;t really bother me. <br/>
Not all of my original thread was off topic.<br/>
So, to repeat.<br/>
Why can&#39;t my Troll SK train with the Troll SK in the <br/>
Foriegn Quarter? There are several SKs there just <br/>
hanging out, yet none of them respond to anything. <br/>
Everyting else over there brings up a merchant window <br/>
when right-clicked on. The exception to this is the Ogre <br/>
guard and the NPC in the top room of the PVP arena. I <br/>
admit I have not tried anything with the Ogre inside the <br/>
building at the bottom of the first ramp. :P<br/>
<br/>
BTW I love that message:<br/>

Pain and Suffering tries to strike you but misses...<br/>
