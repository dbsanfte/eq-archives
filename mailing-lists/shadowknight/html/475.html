<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036957270">Also, during multiple attackes, or need that ultimate taunt? Fear spells<br/>
will get it off the mage, it will also get it off you, giving your healer<br/>
that valuable time to get yer heal, and the casters xtra time to nuke. Use<br/>
fear, it is perhaps your greatest spell.<br/>

&gt; That was a really good response Beld.  I currently play an ogre<br/>
shadowknight<br/>
&gt; lvl 22 on Povar.  I haven&#39;t really tried the fear and then chase to get a<br/>
&gt; few hits in, but I definitly like the sound of it.  I normally hit with a<br/>
&gt; darkness spell, then a str sapping spell and melee away.  My warrior side<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; much better than my spell casting side, so I play the tank mostly.  I<br/>
always<br/>
&gt; try to group with a cleric if possible.  Also, I TOTALLY agree with having<br/>
&gt; your pet, I even try to get one when in a group.  This morning I was<br/>
&gt; fighting in Highpass Hold (MY GOD, how many do I have to kill before I can<br/>
&gt; go into HH :)  )  and they drop a lot of the rusty weapons.  I gave my pet<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; rusty mace and he was hitting in the range of 15-18.  Very nice little<br/>
&gt; addition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have almost full bronze on finally, with a few exceptions.  I have a<br/>
&gt; grotesque mask, and I finally got a greater zweihander (sp), which reminds<br/>
&gt; me, i&#39;m selling a  2handed well balanced, magical axe on that server which<br/>
&gt; normally sells for about 550 from the shady guy in the ecommons/nro<br/>
tunnel.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m selling it for around 300 if anyone is interested.  I am also curious<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; to what type of armour/items other ogre sk&#39;s are wearing and any<br/>
suggestoins<br/>
&gt; they might have.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Wow, Beld, excellent response, this is exactly what I was looking for.<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; &gt; great thing is I&#39;m on Fennin Ro too. I&#39;ll be sure to ask you some<br/>
&gt; &gt; things in<br/>
&gt; &gt; game now that I know you&#39;re there. =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks again, man.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dravith (13)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; PS: Also, any character descriptions I&#39;d love to hear. Tell me about<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; &gt; race, level, equipment, weapon, favorite spells, etc. I just wanna hear<br/>
&gt; &gt; about other SKs, what they&#39;re wearing, how they&#39;re living... Thanks.<br/>
