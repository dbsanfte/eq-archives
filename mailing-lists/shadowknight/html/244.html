<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764551605">first off, WHAT is steel ribbed? do you mean reinforced, or is this a higher<br/>
level armor that you can smith? lemme know so i can decide wether or not to<br/>
continue pouring money into smithing :)<br/>
<br/>
as for cool armors, i know of at least one type of black plate, and possibly<br/>
two. the one i know of for certain is black iron armor, found on some of the<br/>
higher level critters in runnyeye. the problem with this armor is that it is<br/>
basically one-size-fits-all ringmail, having the ac of chain but being<br/>
rather heavy. on the upside, it IS colored black. the rumored black plate<br/>
armor is found in lower guk. i have heard that, at least in beta, there was<br/>
black colored plate armor found down there that MAY or MAY NOT be SK-only.<br/>
of course, since hardly anybody is yet high enough level to form a proper<br/>
party to go genocidal on froggies in lower guk yet, this report has to<br/>
remain unsubstantiated for now. if ever you do head down to lower guk tho<br/>
(perchance to get yourself a darkreaver) be sure to keep your eye out, and<br/>
kill things that look like they may have good equipment. lastly, there is<br/>
the rubicite armor from cazic thule. while the camping situation by this<br/>
armor is quite hideous, what you get is armor with the ac of plate, the<br/>
weight of leather, and a very cool shade of red. so if you dont want to be a<br/>
black knight, you can always be a red knight :)<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve seen one of the lead admin wearing full BLUE plate armor, but wether<br/>
this is obtained off of some high level npc, a god, or is just GM-made<br/>
armor, i cannot know. but it looked damn nice.<br/>
<br/>
thats about all i know of for now, anybody else know of cool armors, their<br/>
stats, or how to find them?<br/>
