<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064426930">I&#39;m a DE SK myself.  If a big brute of an Ogre SK can&#39;t cast a Damage shield <br/>
on himself, a Druid or Magician is going to cast one on him for him.  If you <br/>
want to balance it in such a way to give Races in SK&#39;s a little more <br/>
variation, play off their str&#39;s and weaknesses.  A DE SK has FAR more INT <br/>
then an Ogre or Trolls, so play off that.  Even with REALLY high int a DE SK <br/>
doesn&#39;t have that much Mana, so other then faster skill increases it doesn&#39;t <br/>
pay off to be smarter.<br/>
<br/>
On side gripe I have about ogres trolls vs DEs is the whole HIDE vs SLAM <br/>
issue.  They eventually get to learn how to hide at level 35, so why don&#39;t <br/>
we get to learn some kind of should body check move (ie slam).  This <br/>
generally doesn&#39;t do my damage anyways, and is just good good for <br/>
disruppting spells.  I think a DE has a tad more agi then either of those <br/>
two and could easily do a double backflip and land on the casters head. <br/>
heheh.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is it too powerful because of their low agility? They get hit a lot and so a<br/>
damage shield would be too effective? Is that it?<br/>
<br/>
And just a quick poll of my own -- How many troll/ogre SKs do we have here?<br/>
I&#39;m a dark elf, and I know Cro is a troll. What about the rest of you guys?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, but in a DUNGEON situation, where you WILL be after say level 30,<br/>
there aren&#39;t any gnolls or orcs just wandering around waiting to be<br/>
vampired. So the only things you could lifetap would be those mobs that<br/>
you&#39;re actually fighting. And then you get back into the pull-back-to-cast<br/>
tactic that so many of us despise. I&#39;m still pushing for damage shields. :)<br/>
