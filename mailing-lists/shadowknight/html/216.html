<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091899718">I believe too that the Druid probably should have won, but it should at<br/>
least have been a fight. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the SK was used to mop the floor.<br/>
<br/>
And the HT did an absolutely pitiful amount of damage.<br/>
Which brings me back to my original complaints about the unreliability<br/>
or our &quot;special&quot; weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this does all depend on the types of weapons and armor both<br/>
had and their skills in their weapon&#39;s type, offense and defense. <br/>
<br/>
But i have a feeling that the buffing skills of druids are just way<br/>
more effective than any damage the SK could have done with his spells. <br/>
Since a druid will do the same amount of melee damage with a chosen<br/>
weapon as a SK, they have a distinct advantage.<br/>
<br/>
But we already know that SKs will be considerably weaker than most<br/>
other classes at low-mid levels.<br/>
I would like to hear from a SK 30+ and see if the clouds lining gets<br/>
any shinier.<br/>
