<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349911038">I think they should have given a manual explaining stuff when the game came out. I do feel for people that have invested much time in a bad race/class combo. But, if you chose the race/class combo for RP reasons, well, that is fine. But for power play reasons, the big 3 races are the best tanks in the game, in my opinion.(whatever thats worth)<br/>
