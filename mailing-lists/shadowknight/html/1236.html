<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Thought I&#39;d share that I *finally* finished the Bayle List quest tonight.<br/>
&gt; Well ... I don&#39;t think finished. I&#39;m sure there is more to it, but I<br/>
&gt; retrieve it, decoded it, and returned it to Pietro. Wondering how others<br/>
&gt; were doing with this as this list has been quiet. I&#39;m so happy to have<br/>
&gt; finally finished this part of it ... my notes are scribbled all over the<br/>
&gt; place on stuff and what people said and all that rigamaroll.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So ... has anyone else been working on it? Made any other headway? etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; later,<br/>
