Since the list is dead.<br/>
<br/>
I was watching the auctions last night on the newly edited Jewelry items and<br/>
saw someone selling a AC1 +5hp +5mana ring of some kind for 10pp.  Does any<br/>
one know of any item(s) that would allow us to regenerate hp faster ... like<br/>
a troll, me not being one of course.  I would assume that the +5hp is not a<br/>
regeneration just adds 5hp to someone which to me (and I would think a lot<br/>
of higher level players) is worthless along with the mana, and I already get<br/>
AC1 from my cutthroat rings without the 10pp cost.<br/>
<br/>
Also, did anyone find out about the &quot;Bind ring&quot; that is in the Necro/SK<br/>
guild house, or is that a broken quest also?<br/>
<br/>
I have a full suit of leather armor.  I was just wondering what is the<br/>
proper order of increase that the armor should be?  I think I have it as:<br/>
<br/>
Leather<br/>
Banded<br/>
Chain<br/>
Bronze Plate<br/>
Plate<br/>
<br/>
I have no clue if I am missing something.  I need to get to the next level,<br/>
and don&#39;t think I can do it without getting better armor (which would be<br/>
banded if I am correct).<br/>
<br/>
I have heard rumors about killing so many residents of Befallen that you<br/>
eventually can&#39;t get into our guild with out a KOS from the ghouls outside,<br/>
with out casting inv to undead.  Is this true or false or don&#39;t know.  I<br/>
consider the ghouls and they con warmly to me right now, not sure what that<br/>
means other than they aren&#39;t going to attack me right now.<br/>
<br/>
Should I be hunting in Befallen ... alone?  (I really don&#39;t care about the<br/>
above, as long as the npc inside don&#39;t attack me along with their pets).<br/>
And can I get armor their for free off the SK&#39;s in the back?  Just a note I<br/>
hate rabies.  And I guess does anyone know of an item (Jewelry) that would<br/>
protect me/us from disease, a 100% would be nice?<br/>
<br/>
And that is about it for now.  I am sure I will have more questions later...<br/>
if the list goes dead again :)<br/>
