<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986081522">so ro faction and temple faction are not the same. i killed ortallius a few <br/>
hundred times and the knight likes me just fine.<br/>
<br/>
everyone has indifferent temple faction, the only way i know of killing this <br/>
faction is hailing the efreeti in the basement of the temple...which can be <br/>
repaired by killing shadowedmen if im not mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
btw - am i the only one who enjoys negative faction adjustments? rather than <br/>
attempt to &quot;fix&quot; my faction with the many residents of antonica i&#39;ve done my <br/>
best ruin it.(note: 1.) there is no end to the usefulness of gather shadows <br/>
and feign death 2.) there is suprisingly good lvl 25-50 xp to be had within <br/>
neriak, freeport, oggok, qeynos and most other cities...these zones are also <br/>
a hell of a lot more &quot;fun&quot; than your run of the mill guks and soluseks).<br/>
<br/>
i can proudly say that, at the moment i am dubious or worse everywhere i&#39;ve <br/>
been other than my own guild hall...though, i was rather dissappointed to <br/>
find that there is nothing beyond &quot;scowls&quot;. a &quot;hunts you across the zone&quot; <br/>
would have been interesting.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
- if you think it&#39;s wrong for a troll to kill de...they overcharge me in <br/>
shops 8) and captain n&#39;farre killed me when i was lv6, leaving an indelible <br/>
mark on my young hateful mind (an orc runner attacked me).<br/>

&gt;| luckily, the undead knight (the guy who makes shadow knight armor) has<br/>
&gt;| temple of solusek ro faction, NOT najena faction. so you can kill stuff <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;| najena to your hearts content and he&#39;ll still like you. HOWEVER, since he<br/>
&gt;| appears in drelzna&#39;s room... it would be nice to have high najena faction<br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;| you can survive the trip down there a bit more easily!<br/>

&gt;What is the best way to adjust Solusek Ro Faction?  I know the named Orc in<br/>
&gt;South Ro does. Anything else? like a HUGE faction adjustment?  What is the<br/>
&gt;starting/minimum Faction needed for this Undead Knight?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BTW.... Thank you very much for such a quick answer<br/>
