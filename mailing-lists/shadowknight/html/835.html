agree on one thing, that the pet spells after 22 are useless, and the funny<br/>

Okay, been perusing the e-mails.  Looks like a change to the magic system<br/>
isn&#39;t going to be happening any time soon because there doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
consensus within the SK community as to which spells suck and which don&#39;t<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
So to help out human and DE SKs, what about a shield/1HS combo acquirable<br/>
around 25th or 30th level through questing that gives you a significant<br/>
amount of protection (to make up for lack of HP compared to Ogre/SK) and<br/>
damage (think of an Anti-Ghoulbane)?<br/>
<br/>
And for you troll/ogre SKs, there are other goodies going in for you too :-)<br/>
