<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142627665">Ok,<br/>
<br/>
So now we know the breastplate comes from the clockwork EXG model (lvl 30ish) that roams the gnome castle in Solusek A.<br/>
<br/>
We also have pieced together the fact that the charred guardian gauntlets are dropped by some efreet in Sol A, don&#39;t know exactly which mob yet though.<br/>
<br/>
We also know they both add to Str and Sta, as well as look like black plate. For me, these are my two lowest melee stats and I love anything that increases BOTH, plus it is BLACK PLATE. My god, I am obsessing already.<br/>
<br/>
Now, are there any other charred guardian pieces? Legs? Arms? Bracers? HELM?!<br/>
<br/>
Search! Fellow dark knights, the time is at hand! Search!<br/>
