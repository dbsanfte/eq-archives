<div id="ygrps-yiv-377087863">Hey guys, <br/>
<br/>
	I was curious about strength.  What role does it truly play?<br/>
Obviously you can carry more, a big plus.  But what about combat?  I have<br/>
noticed that my ogre with 143 STR does the same damage as a friends high<br/>
elf with the same weapon and much lower strength.  Is this just because<br/>
I&#39;m am still relatively low leveled (8)?  Does the str bonus take effect<br/>
at higher levels?  Or is there a bonus at all?<br/>
