<div id="ygrps-yiv-958612594">Yes there is a secret enterance to freeport. You walk into a section of wall<br/>
that is indistinguishable from the rest (except you can walk through it).<br/>
There is a series of tunnels underneath that go throughout all three<br/>
freeports. It is found in East freeport. I have 2 loc&#39;s written down, don&#39;t<br/>
remember which. (-356.70, -93.32) and (-893.84, -1253.82). It might be<br/>
easier to find by creating a human character in freeport and following it<br/>
out. The exit is under the docks to the south. You go down the stairs, under<br/>
the dock and in the corner by the fisherman you will mfind a door. Go into<br/>
this warehous, down the stairs and under the stairs. Under the stairs you<br/>
will find anot her secret door (cant be seen, just walk into the wall).<br/>
<br/>
I am now a level 16 Sk and have killed every orc I could (for a while in<br/>
Crushbone and then in the commonlands). I am now able to walk the streets of<br/>
Eastern and Western Freeport unmolested (the guards con as Dubious). I was<br/>
only attacked by a Mage NPC by one of the zones to East Freeport. North<br/>
Freeport (where the bank is) should be a little Dicer though as the Paladins<br/>
live there.<br/>

In regards to the Kerra Isle quest, I have seen Dark Elves standing in the<br/>
bank in Qeynos (with another of my characters), so it is possible.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know how many gnolls you have to kill, but I am guessing quite a few.  As<br/>
far as the docks, that may be another matter, I haven&#39;t attempted it....<br/>
For Freeport, is there anyone else out there aware that in the<br/>
sewers/aqueducts underneath Freeport that there is a group of evil charactes<br/>
down there, and it is possible to get some quests from them?  I have done<br/>
two of them, minor things really, and was wondering if anyone else had any<br/>
others from below Freeport and if they were worth it?  If anyone else is<br/>
interested, i can give you details of what I know..... will have to dig out<br/>
my notes, though.  Tvar Povar<br/>
