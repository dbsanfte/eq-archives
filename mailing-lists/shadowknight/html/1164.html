<div id="ygrps-yiv-126604524">&quot;The no drop stat change is intentional, to balance the power of the armor.&quot; <br/>
-Brad<br/>
<br/>
good impression? i think it embodies the cryptic and seemingly mis or <br/>
uninformed explanations that V&#39;s public figurehead dishes us rather well.<br/>
<br/>
really though, i tend to think this change was implemented to please the <br/>
largest number of players. sad as it is, newbies and the elite alike despise <br/>
no drop equipment for the exact same reasons. it discourages twinking. these <br/>
days the question around the newbie zone isn&#39;t &quot;where do i get that?&quot; or <br/>
&quot;what kind of group do i need?&quot; it&#39;s &quot;how much?&quot; or &quot;how much?&quot; or &quot;sell me <br/>
yours?&quot;. while the elite on the other hand, feel they are being done a <br/>
severe injustice every time they come across some leet lewt that can&#39;t <br/>
easily be transferred to their twink projects (or sold to the afformentioned <br/>
newbies who amass mounds of plat with the latest greatest pietinesque <br/>
sploit). so, by changing the no-drop stat they keep these two large and <br/>
vocal groups of players satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
though, you would think that someone over there at VHQ would have noticed <br/>
the stream of lv45+ campers who started monopolizing the TR after the change <br/>
in stats became common knowledge. personally, i&#39;ve counted at least 4 5+ <br/>
hour decayed camps by very high level players since the change, no suprise <br/>
that not one of them was an sk. (i guess someone will say this can be <br/>
reported under verant&#39;s new &quot;play nice rules&quot; but the last time i <br/>
reported/petition anything the response took well over 4 hours to arrive <br/>
with the end effect being 0 due to the guide&#39;s apprectice status.)<br/>

<br/>
btw - to add to the frustration of an idiotic change like this. anyone  can <br/>
complete the quests...ranger, bard, wood elf, human...so, now you have not <br/>
only the threat of high level farmers but mid level quest sploiters who hunt <br/>
the TR or auction for spare decayed so that they (a human ranger for <br/>
instance) can grab a gate to Fay and make 1/2 bubble or more xp for every <br/>
piece they complete.<br/>
<br/>
why should a non sk be able to start or complete a quest for an sk ONLY <br/>
item? (i know i already answered this with my own hypothesis but it would be <br/>
nice to see what everyone else thinks. especially a verantite if they happen <br/>
to read this.)<br/>
