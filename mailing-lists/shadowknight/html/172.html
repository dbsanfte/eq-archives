<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843613697">I don&#39;t know....I made 9th level Saturday night....and then I made 10th<br/>
level last night.  I was casting like a mad man...using my underpowered<br/>
pet and having a blast.  My skills in magic maxed very quickly except<br/>
divination....but you can only locate so many corpses a night.  Anyhow.<br/>
As far as the SK being any less powerfull....I didn&#39;t see that last night.<br/>
As a matter of fact...even with the spells we get being chincy at<br/>
9th...they still help alot.  My pet makes up for damage that I don&#39;t<br/>
do....kinda like a free swing.  Not too mention I don&#39;t have to chase down<br/>
monsters to either lure them or kill them.  Its all about what you want<br/>
from your character.  SK&#39;s take time to mature....they are part<br/>
spellcaster and aren&#39;t really going to be effective until they really get<br/>
a good set of spells and some mana.  As many guides have said...they are<br/>
3/4 warrior and 1/4 caster...while some choose to dwell only on the<br/>
warrior part....the casting is in their nature and should be used to<br/>
fullest extent.<br/>
