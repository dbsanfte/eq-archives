<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218382359">I&#39;m wandering around in Mistmoore, and don&#39;t see our quest person<br/>
anywhere, and I&#39;ve heard that it was broken as of 5:00 last night<br/>
on Test?<br/>
<br/>
Do we have our quests for armor yet?  Or are we once again forgotten?<br/>
<br/>
I think the design of the SK class is great for RP&#39;ers.  They make<br/>
it difficult to play (which I like), KOS so you die often, and then<br/>
make sure all your quests are broken or nonexistant (where is our<br/>
SoulFire?)  By level 30 you will become a master of Role Playing<br/>
an imbittered person full of hatred ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else out there found it yet?<br/>
