&gt; xilith, the soulfire really ISNT a very good weapon. in fact its pretty<br/>
&gt; crappy once you get past the eye candy part. sure the stats are NICE, but by<br/>
&gt; the time you can actually obtain one without a major twink job, and<br/>
&gt; considering a paladin who wants it more or less has to continue the quest<br/>
&gt; through most of his paladin career, it is just complete junk when set beside<br/>
&gt; a mithril 2h sword or a razing sword of skarlton. yes i know those two<br/>
&gt; weapons are very difficult to obtain, but there is a big difference between<br/>
&gt; several hours of camping and several months of active questing :) which does<br/>
&gt; kind of confuse me.. since it is one of the hardest weapons in the game to<br/>
&gt; obtain (not to mention limited to a specific class) why is it so chintzy?<br/>
&gt; not asking for an answer, just a not so subtle suggestion that any sk quest<br/>
&gt; swords be made a bit more utilitarian ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is also a status symbol, and thus important in RP context.  I<br/>
also would rather do a month long quest than camp for many hours.<br/>
I am tired of camping, and am really looking for something to work<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
And the stats aren&#39;t that bad either.  Maybe I just think since<br/>
they have two, so should we, but then I guess we get to share<br/>
a few with warriors (Soul Leech should be SK only!)<br/>
