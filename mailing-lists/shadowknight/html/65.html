<div id="ygrps-yiv-589625572">I share an account with my roommate (nothing inherently bad about this I<br/>
would hope), and he tried to log his character on while I was at work<br/>
and online.  I got a message: &quot;cheater log updated&quot;.  What does that<br/>
exactly mean and how am I cheating by allowing my roommate to play one<br/>
of my other characters when I am not using it. Sorry it&#39;s off topic, but<br/>
I really need to know.  Thanks<br/>
