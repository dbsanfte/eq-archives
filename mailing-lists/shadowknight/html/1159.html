<b>Subject:</b> one problem thats been bothering me <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153589526">now, for the most part i&#39;m a &quot;happy sk&quot;. i enjoy playing the class, my<br/>
friends seem to enjoy having me tag along, and i tend to dismiss most of the<br/>
complains as whines or just uninformed rants.<br/>
<br/>
but one comment keeps coming up that i find it hard to just dismiss offhand.<br/>
that is the fact that sk, along with the other hybrids, have an experience<br/>
penalty. and the question is, why? most sk (DE, troll, and ogre) have<br/>
additional racial xp penalties, making them by far the slowest levelers of<br/>
the game. but at high level, we really are not that much more powerful than<br/>
anybody else, if at all. in fact, necromancers and druids have no<br/>
discernable xp penalty by comparison, and, well, are incredibly powerful.<br/>
now that warriors have had a lot of beefing, and their xp remains the same..<br/>
the xp penalty does seem to make less and less sense.<br/>
<br/>
an xp penalty assumes some sort of &quot;reward&quot; for reaching higher level..<br/>
which there doesnt seem to be for the hybrid classes at this time..<br/>
<br/>
not a rant, just an observation on the ONE complaint of others that i am<br/>
unable to readily answer :)<br/>
