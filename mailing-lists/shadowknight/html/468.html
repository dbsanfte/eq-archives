<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354250558">Okie, this is how your spells work. First of all, at level 9, MAX your spell skills! Make a skellie(at level 10), and cast your weakest mana cost spell on it. Raise  your skills this is key. First spell, engulfing darkness line. They are DOT and slow the target down. Siphon strength, take there str and gives it to you. The level 9 invite spell. Locate corpse, worth every copper. FEAR, gotta have this. Pet spell(cannot tank, xtra damage, use when soloing). After you figure these out, the rest will come to you. Use fear, when the damn mage frenzies it, fear will save him. Disease cloud(throw it on your pet, max conjuration cheap without components)<br/>
Also makes it so mob wont heal. Another good idea is archery. Solo, only when u have to. Do this via, darkness spell slows him. Disease keeps him grom healing. Fear makes him run away.pet hits it in the back while it runs away. Add in archery for some DD, and your in like flin. The darkness line is your SOW. Using these spells and skills, ya can beat the thing to death before you enter hand to hand. And hand to hand is wear you really shine. You will also get some DD spells to undead along with invis to undead.(great for unrest, if evocation is maxxed.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

  Subject: [shadowknight] Starting out<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hey, I don&#39;t know if anyone still reads this list, but if so please give me a hand here.<br/>
<br/>
  I just started a dark elf SK, level 6 now. I played a warrior to 31, so I know melee combat and all its ins and outs. What I need help with is spells, I&#39;ve never been able to use them before so I&#39;mma little new. What spells should I get at 9? at 15? etc. What are the good spell combos to use in a fight? Which have the best mana/damage ratios? These and a lot more questions are on my mind. Give me some feedback if ya got it. Thanks!<br/>
