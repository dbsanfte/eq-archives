<div id="ygrps-yiv-753705334">is it really fair to not help us out with info here? after all, the ONLY way<br/>
you can know where the lists are located is if you do the PALADIN quests<br/>
that relate the locations! raltur gives you NO hints, and as an sk of<br/>
innoruuk, lady shae wont tell me anything no matter what i do. giving her<br/>
beer doesnt help. shouldnt she at least have a note that says her bayle list<br/>
was stolen by x? i know you cant do anything about that tho hehe..<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve heard rumors of how the rest of the quest goes.. but even so it is<br/>
terribly unfair for verant to give us a quest we cant complete without<br/>
reading paladin spoiler sites ;p<br/>
