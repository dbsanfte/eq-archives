<br/>
Would NE1 like to moderate the message board?<br/>
I havent done ne thing to this board since... a couple years ago? ;)<br/>
Heh, I started this, then I had to quit cause of &quot;groundation&quot;, lol, <br/>
and I never came back.  I forgot all about this message board and <br/>
just let it be, little to be known to grow into a huge community.  So <br/>
If NE1 wants to be moderator for this board read the below.<br/>
<br/>
I would like these requirements:<br/>
1.Gotta be one kewl/nice person, heheh<br/>
2.Gotta be the man in EQ for Shadowknights<br/>
3.Suck up, lol, jk, dont do that!<br/>
<br/>
Do the following:<br/>
1.Email me directly<br/>
2.Say stuff why I should pick you<br/>
<br/>
Note: Please dont mail me unless you really think you would be a <br/>
great person to moderate it, seriously.  I dont want hundreds of <br/>
emails coming to me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
