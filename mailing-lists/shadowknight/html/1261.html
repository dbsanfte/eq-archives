<div id="ygrps-yiv-516967717">I&#39;ll agree that for larger races it does suck (disadvantage of being<br/>
large?), but maybe the timing of removing this item and getting Alchemy<br/>
fixed wasn&#39;t just coincidental. I&#39;ll bet that they either have or will have<br/>
a Shrink spell in the game very soon. I&#39;m not going to lie about it though<br/>
I&#39;m extremely happy the change happened, and yes I think it should have<br/>
happened a lot sooner. I also think it may have been better if they would<br/>
have changed the effect to that of shrink (or Gnome, I&#39;ve always wanted to<br/>
be a Gnome SK). Oh well, whats done is done.<br/>

I think the change sucks, from the perspective of a large race. Many<br/>
dungeons are bugged, cant even walk into sola, get back down the stairs in<br/>
unrest, etc. This change hurts the large races bad, and came way too late,<br/>
atfer everyone and the brother done got it. Now large races are dependent on<br/>
shamans to enter the dungeons. Sucks to depend on 1 class. Maybe they will<br/>
throw out a shrink type item, course prob require getting a rare pop off a<br/>
dragon or something. I also feel like all the real cool items are gone.<br/>
Manastones, guise, jboots, etc. On the older servers so many people already<br/>
have these, and the ogrew that got there late will have to stand and shout<br/>
will pay for shrink at the dungeon entrance, while other people just click<br/>
on there mask. I am sure you smaller race shadowknights like the change<br/>
though.... Dont see why they waited 9 months to do it....<br/>

&gt; Non Dark Elfs probably won&#39;t like this as much, but it looks as though the<br/>
&gt; Guise is no longer dropping. There is a new mask dropping that gives the<br/>
&gt; same effect but must be worn to be used. As a Dark Elf I love this change,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s nice to get some of my identity back..<br/>
