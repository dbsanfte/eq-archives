<b>Subject:</b> faction with FP rogues <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-949093429">i THINK that giving 4 orc pawn picks to one of the merchants at habard&#39;s<br/>
resales in east fp will raise faction with numerous FP groups, with no<br/>
decreases.. but i dont remember at this point whether the rogues are among<br/>
them. worth a try, anyway. by doing so you also get a lottery ticket from<br/>
highpass, which will randomly be a winning number that could result in<br/>
something interesting, but nobody is quite sure yet..<br/>
