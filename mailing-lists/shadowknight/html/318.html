<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112587286">Question #1:<br/>
Even before i started my SK, i had every intention of using archery as<br/>
a offensive tactic.<br/>
However, starting in Qeynos, there were no fletching supplies available<br/>
to make arrows, (unless i went to Surefall, which would have been a<br/>
very bad idea) and being a newbie, was too cheap to buy them ready made<br/>
from a vendor.<br/>
Now im not a newbie and am still too cheap to buy them.<br/>
I am currently in Freeport, does anyone know where i can buy ALL the<br/>
fletching supplies i need to make arrows?<br/>
<br/>
Question #2:<br/>
Are pets allowed to fight in duels or guildwars on any server but the<br/>
+PvP?<br/>
Ive meant to try this but keep getting involved with other things. But<br/>
im at work now and bored, so i figured i just ask :)<br/>
<br/>
Question #3:<br/>
I just hit level 15 and got my second set of spells, but havent had a<br/>
chance to use them yet.<br/>
Is this the pet that has the magical attack?<br/>
And if we have a pet and cast Shadow Step, does he commit suicide<br/>
thinking we disappeared while in the teleportation stage?<br/>
<br/>
And just a note on archery. Apparently there are some pretty good bows<br/>
out there that do a good 15 to 17 dmg per hit. So archery can be just<br/>
as good as using a mino axe up close, but you dont have to worry about<br/>
getting hit melee wise.<br/>
<br/>
Any info will be appreciated.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
