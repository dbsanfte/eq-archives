&gt; the reason i&#39;m thinking this is a legitimate, hidden sk spell is thus: 1).<br/>
&gt; we only get 6 spells at lvl 49, when every other spell circle we reach has 7<br/>
&gt; spells. hmm. 2). there are equivalent spells for paladin and ranger: a lvl<br/>
&gt; 49 ranger only spell, and a lvl 49 paladin only spell. the ranger spell<br/>
&gt; seems to be a 200 point fire based DD, named &quot;call of flame&quot; or some such.<br/>
&gt; the paladin one is named &quot;divine might&quot;, and the effect is a bit confusing<br/>
&gt; to read.. however, &quot;embrace&quot; is in there somewhere, so this might be a buff<br/>
&gt; spell that adds a DD proc component to paladin&#39;s melee, ala VE without the<br/>
&gt; drain. the stuff is IN there.. the problem is, is it actually implemented<br/>
&gt; ingame or not? (beyond lifeleech being obviously in the pestilence scythe)<br/>
&gt; <br/>

has one _charge_ of Vamipiric Curse, it does not proc it.  Also,<br/>
Vampiric Curse is (I believe) a lifetap DOT, that gradually sucks life<br/>
out of something.<br/>

There may indeed be hidden spells for all hybrids, or maybe they were<br/>
in development and got dropped, but left in the file there.  I wonder<br/>
if maybe they will be added to the Temple of Solusek as quest only<br/>
spells?  As it stands, I couldn&#39;t find a single tank/hybrid in the<br/>
temple =(<br/>
