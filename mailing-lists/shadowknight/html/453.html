For the first time since the patch that altered fletching, i gave it a<br/>
shot.<br/>
<br/>
Now, i dont know if this was the way it was immediately after the<br/>
patch, but as it stands, its not bad at all.<br/>
<br/>
For every set of arrow components you combine (on success of course)<br/>
you create 5 arrows.<br/>
<br/>
The skill rate seems to work the same as when we were combining single<br/>
components as well.<br/>
<br/>
I didnt get to buy the components myself, so i dont know what the cost<br/>
is now, but as far as how it works and what you get out of it, it seems<br/>
like a good deal.<br/>
<br/>
I am still trying to find out where evil races/classes can buy<br/>
components. If anyone can enter Ogguk, you may want to check there,<br/>
since Grobb doesnt seem to have the components as i previously<br/>
believed.<br/>
<br/>
Thats all..thank you and have a nice day<br/>
