<div id="ygrps-yiv-129978395"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; work without you worrying about it? For me, the choice is clear -- damage<br/>
&gt; shields all the way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Completely agreed. Problem is, Brian just said a few emails ago that it made<br/>
us too powerful. I would gladly give up my pet for a damage shield, however,<br/>
and I&#39;m not sure that this would really make us overpowerful. What it would<br/>
mean is that we could use our spell in place we could never have used our<br/>
pet previously because of drawing puny creatures to fight, etc. I rarely use<br/>
my pet anymore except when soloing, so what is the point of it? (other than<br/>
to serve as a reason to have voice graft! :D). Damage shields would be<br/>
something effective for a GROUP situation and something that can actually be<br/>
used. What about a line of damage shields ... maybe every other level, and<br/>
then the pet spells on other levels replaced with ... something. Still<br/>
thinking on this one, but damage shields definitely would seem to be the way<br/>
to go if they could be implemented without overbalancing us. (Heck, I<br/>
*guess* I would agree to this even knowing my voice graft would be taken<br/>
away!) And this does fit in character with a SK, I think, almost as well as<br/>
lifetaps. Having people take damage just from hitting us ... sounds like<br/>
something I could easily imagine happening with a Shadowknight.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and as a sidenote ... I rarely rarely experience damage shields since<br/>
most other damage shield having classing are by default &quot;good&quot; races or<br/>
classes and I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going to fight with a druid. My magician<br/>
friend casts it on me at times, but that is rare because we don&#39;t group too<br/>
much anymore (surprise, he&#39;s pulling ahead of me in levels).<br/>
