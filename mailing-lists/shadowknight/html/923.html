<div id="ygrps-yiv-466527458">well...i&#39;ve poked through the .eff files myself [a basic hex capable editor <br/>
will do the trick] and i haven&#39;t run into anything which could be <br/>
interperted as delay data. certainly nothing noted as such. though, it was <br/>
some time ago when i did this...so things could have changed.<br/>
<br/>
could this spell be the file reference of the soul leech&#39;s effect? it would <br/>
not be the only proc effect which differs in file reference and in-game <br/>
description. if this delay data does in fact exist...it may refer to the <br/>
frequency with which this effect can proc...rather than an actual delay in <br/>
casting.<br/>
<br/>
or possibly the spell&#39;s &quot;recycle time&quot; if it is in fact a castable spell. <br/>
two minutes seems far to long to be actual &quot;casting time&quot;.<br/>

&gt;i dont think these are weapon procs.. NO weapon proc has a delay higher <br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt;0.1 seconds, or it&#39;d be interrupted during normal combat movement. also no<br/>
&gt;weapon proc has a time delay after using..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;by the way, how do you read the .eff files without getting a bunch of<br/>
&gt;gobbldegook? :)<br/>
