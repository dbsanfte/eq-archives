<br/>
the first day the new quests surfaced some lv50 necro was camping crusaders <br/>
to outfit his twink on my server...he&#39;s gone now. but assholes make up the <br/>
majority of our population inside and outside of eq...so it&#39;s just a fact of <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
it sounds like the heinous &quot;eq-stress&quot; has invaded you and your life as it <br/>
has so many others. definitely sounds like a break is in order...<br/>
<br/>
but...<br/>
<br/>
i recommend keeping your account active for a month or 2. i quit eq entirely <br/>
for over a month once, for various reasons and i was glad i didn&#39;t cancel or <br/>
sell off my items when i eventually came back...i don&#39;t play as much as i <br/>
used to or with the same desire but i still enjoy the game from time to <br/>
time. so, as long as it provides 10 hours of &quot;real fun&quot; each month...it&#39;s <br/>
worth the money.<br/>
<br/>
i think anyone can agree with that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; i just got word that the quests may have been changed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; rumor has it that possibly only 1 item is need now<br/>
&gt; &gt; instead of the 2.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; NOTE: i used the word rumor.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone gone back to MM or Najena for quest info?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The skeleton gave teh same message today, but conned red to a 36th<br/>
&gt;level, which is an improvement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I, myself, am leaving EQ, beacause I can&#39;t stand the majority of<br/>
&gt;the people on my server.  A druid and a level 50 warrior were tracking<br/>
&gt;down and killing all of the crusaders in cazic today so that they could<br/>
&gt;do the quests, and then try to find a way to trade the nodrop armor<br/>
&gt;to a low level twink.  She was not only doing this, but competing<br/>
&gt;with me in /auction for looting pieces.  Earlier, I gave the rogue<br/>
&gt;in my group the ravenscale legs without even doing a random, and she<br/>
&gt;wasn&#39;t even someone I knew.  Both Verant and the players on my<br/>
&gt;server have made it more of a chore to play than fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So good luck everyone finding your armor, hope you live on a more<br/>
&gt;civil server than Tunare.<br/>
