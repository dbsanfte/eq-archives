<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063389489">About the new website, just wanted to say that I&#39;ve been working almost non-stop today on it. I now have a message board, guestbook, and quizlet. I also fixed a few little buggy things. I&#39;ll hopefully be adding some Java soon, as right now the site is kind of bare-bones. Once again, remember to visit and send me email about anything you also want posted! And I am the reason I have not put any spells besides 9 and 15 up are because I have not used any of them, but they will be there as soon as I either test them or get someone who knows what they do(I am not using EQ-Lizer to get my info, too easy and can be considered plaigerism)(not sure how to spell that word...sorry for killing it).<br/>
