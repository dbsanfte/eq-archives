<div id="ygrps-yiv-876206444">To be honest having a good 1H would be pretty nice.<br/>
Make fighting those wizzies/mages/enchanters a little<br/>
easier.<br/>
And as for your weight issue, get yourself a Box of<br/>
Abu Kar. That 1 item has made me VERY happy. Then you<br/>
can carry around 10 weapons of your choosing with no<br/>
worries about weight.<br/>
<br/>
I got mine from a specter. I have heard you can also<br/>
get them from Gnome guards, Lizardman Heretics and<br/>
Justicars.<br/>
<br/>
What i feel we need though is a REALLY good Scythe<br/>
weapon. That one from Grimrot stinks. Not that i would<br/>
kill him for it anyway. A Scythe, i think it would<br/>
give us a truely menacing look.<br/>

&gt; A new 1HS weapon, just wonderful. As if carrying<br/>
&gt; around the Dark Reaver and<br/>
&gt; Fleshripper weren&#39;t enough, now you want the SMALL<br/>
&gt; guys to lug around a 1H<br/>
&gt; sword AND a shield too. Yay. My Str is only 97, and<br/>
&gt; even with an EE Bag,<br/>
&gt; that stuff is still heavy. Not to mention a whole<br/>
&gt; &#39;nother skill to keep up<br/>
&gt; with, ugh.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Better options:<br/>
&gt; 1.) Give us kick. Humans and Dark Elves will use it,<br/>
&gt; large races won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; (because they have slam). Also fits into the image<br/>
&gt; of SKs being mean,<br/>
&gt; under-handed, intense damage-dealing tanks.<br/>
&gt; 2.) Give us spells (like Banshee Aura) that are<br/>
&gt; human/de only. Larges can<br/>
&gt; outsource to druids/mages for their damshields.<br/>
&gt; 3.) Make some new human/de only items (not<br/>
&gt; necessarily weapons). The easiest<br/>
&gt; way to do this is just make some new SK armor that<br/>
&gt; is medium-sized, the<br/>
&gt; larges just can&#39;t wear em, but the human/de SKs can.<br/>
