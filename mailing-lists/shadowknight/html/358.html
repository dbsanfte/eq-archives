<div id="ygrps-yiv-598468852">12 hp every once in a while may not seem like much. but it does increase<br/>
over time. besides, how many people have a buff that lets them to drain<br/>
life? the trick is getting to lvl 30. if you can do that, the shadow knight<br/>
has become an immensely powerful class by that time and quite playable. that<br/>
is why verant doesnt want to give us a great amount of power at low levels..<br/>
we&#39;d be strong ALL the way through.<br/>
