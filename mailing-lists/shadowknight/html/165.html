<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481099776">again, my wifes ogre sk just bought a halberd, and she is hitting dervs for<br/>
28 a crack...that is real damage, heh.<br/>
Pets also give her xtra damage, and if shit gets deep, gives hr three steps<br/>
to the door, while mob beats her pet..<br/>
no chasing down monsters, she can lure...<br/>
I see alot of advantages to the sk,  and when she can start lifetapping<br/>
too...<br/>
They are mean, no doubt about it..<br/>
Spells are what ya make of em, ya gotta look at all the ins and outs..<br/>
and they are something a warrior will never have....<br/>
whats skill does a warr get that you dont?<br/>
kick? newbie only skill...bash/slam way better<br/>
duel wield? bah, two handed and can still bash./slam<br/>
Ermm, healing is a problem, all tanks gotta deal with...<br/>
Whatcha want, a super character?<br/>

&gt; You make good points, and I alluded to some of those in my post -- I&#39;m a<br/>
&gt; great damage sponge, and that seems to be what you&#39;ve offered as your best<br/>
&gt; skill to your party. :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, I want to contribute actively -- and there&#39;s not many ways I can<br/>
&gt; do that unfortunately.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The image of an SK standing there taking damage while others do the &quot;real&quot;<br/>
&gt; work seems out of whack with what an SK should be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I may stick it out with the SK a bit longer, if for no other reason than<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; lets me tag along with my friends a bit more and I can thus check out some<br/>
&gt; cool new locales (I just did the Qeynos-&gt;Freeport run last night, and I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; hate to quit now).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do think that my next character will be a ranger though, if I feel like<br/>
&gt; going through the tedium of levelling up.<br/>
