 </span></blockquote>You call the pet a long-term DOT? We&#39;re both talking about the same<br/>
half-our-level-and-does-nothing-but-cause-trouble-and-take-exp pet, right? I<br/>
can&#39;t believe you want those over ANY kind of lifetap spell! Ok, so let&#39;s<br/>
compromise -- I don&#39;t want pets, you don&#39;t want lifetaps, so what other<br/>
necro spells could we get instead? Buffs? That shrieking aura type damage<br/>
shield? Don&#39;t just say &quot;NO LIFETAP!&quot;, Beld, throw me a bone here, let&#39;s be<br/>
constructive...<br/>
