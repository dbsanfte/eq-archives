<b>Subject:</b> A Lil more oon the duel <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013688344">Allright, lets do this in detail.<br/>
My guildmate and i had  friendly duel. He was a 18th level Halfling Druid I <br/>
myslef was a 17th level Dark Elf Shadowknight. He had full leather and a <br/>
screaming mace. I had a shiny brass halberd, Full bronze Platemail, 110 str <br/>
after siphoning. He rooted me and blasted me with a spell doing 37 pts a <br/>
turn and Stinging swarm. I got the joy of casting my three spells at him <br/>
until i was un rooted and harm touched him. The harm touch did HALF a bubble <br/>
YES HALF. after he was taxed. Now at melee. My halberd was doing about one <br/>
to twenty nine pints of damage. at one time in the duel, I did one point of <br/>
damage three times in a row. Also, 75% of my spells were laughed off. the <br/>
only good thing i did in my fight was dodge and parry quite often(helps to <br/>
be a dark elf fer that). Well thats about that. Rather embarrasing and <br/>
disheartening. In beta I played a warrior and never lost a battle.<br/>
