<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536839126">I have put a couple of training points in to Archery and have fired a lot of<br/>
arrows at blue and above creatures, and haven&#39;t gained any experience and I<br/>
have been keeping watch on it.  I have fired over 200 arrows and nothing.<br/>
Is their any reason? or just plain bad luck.  I think my pets and party<br/>
members are getting mad at me becuse they want me to tank for them but I<br/>
really want to increase my archery skill.  I have a long bow with the<br/>
standard arrows.  Plus I couldn&#39;t find the book on making arrows in .... the<br/>
dark elf city ... Neriak(?) anyone know where it is?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
