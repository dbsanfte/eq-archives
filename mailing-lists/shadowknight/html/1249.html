<div id="ygrps-yiv-235858422">Due to my extreme displeasure with the majority of the<br/>
posters on the Knight Watch, i will respond to your<br/>
question here.<br/>
<br/>
As to who can be questioned in MM:<br/>
This is only a guess i must admit. But there is an NPC<br/>
near the crypt with something like &quot;information&quot; in<br/>
the name.<br/>
Cant recall what it was exactly. But given the name i<br/>
am guessing that it may actually be questioned.<br/>
Of course there is always the Avenging Caitiff,<br/>
assuming of course you speak with him within the 3<br/>
seconds that he lives.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note:<br/>
Other than the Bards (too much time killing for so<br/>
little faction) is there another way to gain faction<br/>
with MM.<br/>
I have heard ugly rumors that Lenya no longer gives MM<br/>
faction. And its possible that the DE that spawns in<br/>
Paw is bugged.<br/>
