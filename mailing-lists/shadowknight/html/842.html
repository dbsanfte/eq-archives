<br/>
I know you said you would not answer non-SK related email, but this one does<br/>
in a way.<br/>
<br/>
Why is it that only the evil races must zone to get to a merchant? Every<br/>
other zone, with the exception of Dungeons, has at least one merchant in it<br/>
except the newbie zone of an evil race.<br/>
Everfrost has the merchants in the tunnel<br/>
Steamfont has many merchants<br/>
Butcherblock has many merchants<br/>
Greater Fay has the entire city of Kelethin open to Wood and High elves<br/>
Lesser Fay has the Ranger camp<br/>
Qeynos Hills has the house in the middle<br/>
Misty Thicket has the halfling huts<br/>
The Commonlands...<br/>
Kithicor...<br/>
The Karanas ....<br/>
<br/>
Why did Verant think it necessary to FORCE a character of an evil race to<br/>
zone into a city to sell loot from the associated newbie zone?  That has<br/>
been bugging me for quite a bit.  I hate having to zone to sell.  The major<br/>
factor here is that it takes me 2-2.5 minutes to zone one way.  If it only<br/>
took me 30 seconds like it does my wife, I may not have thought it a big<br/>
deal.  It may be an oversight by Verant, but I don&#39;t think it is a &quot;fair&quot;<br/>
way of doing things.  The all-or-none principle comes to mind here.<br/>
End of rant.<br/>
<br/>
Please respond to this one Brian, even if it is a &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;.<br/>
Anyone out there think this is worthy of a Petition?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
