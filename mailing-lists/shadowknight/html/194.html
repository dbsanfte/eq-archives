<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307310945">any evil character can safely enter the tunnels under east freeport. there<br/>
are guildmasters there, but they are all worshippers of innoruuk and other<br/>
evil gods. they are there mostly for the benefit of people who are evil and<br/>
have lost enough faction that they can no longer walk the streets of<br/>
freeport to reach their usual guild.. also i believe that a few of them<br/>
(noteably clerics) are THE guildmasters for evil clerics who begin life in<br/>
freeport. after all, why would a guildmaster of the clerics of marr want to<br/>
train a cleric of innoruuk? :)<br/>
