&gt; &gt; ANYWAY...<br/>
&gt; &gt; I also dread a teleport to Faydwer for the same reason.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have no idea what NPCs hang around wizard teleport<br/>
&gt; &gt; rings.  I doubt I will ever use a Druidic Succor for<br/>
&gt; &gt; obvious reasons.  My wife&#39;s Bard worships Veeshan, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; when teleported to the Druidic ring in the Karanas she<br/>
&gt; &gt; was KoSed.  With my lag I would never see that I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; being attacked, just the &quot;Returning to home point...&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; message.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have no idea if this will ease your fears or not, but the only person who<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t be invisible when teleporting or succoring is the caster. In other<br/>
&gt; words, you can be invis and still ride along. I&#39;m a dark elf SK who&#39;s killed<br/>
&gt; many many druids, yet I just go invis during his casting, and I still get to<br/>
&gt; tag along. Just a little trick so when you get 30, you can invis yourself<br/>
&gt; and not have to miss out on teleporting. :)<br/>

when the screen went to the Loading please wait...  I was stumped,<br/>
because I didn&#39;t see me die, until I looked up and saw the druid say<br/>
that he was evac&#39;ing.  At first I was overjoyed at his timely salvation,<br/>
until I remembered what hangs around druid circles.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, he teleported me back to get my body from East Karanas.<br/>
I told him to let the wiz evac us next time =)<br/>
