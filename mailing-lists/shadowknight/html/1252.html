<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038354675">Ac is everything for a tank<br/>
My Agi is 86 I think and my AC is 813 with buffs on.<br/>
You definatly want to be gettin over 750.<br/>
<br/>
Why is Liveside empty?<br/>
Loot. The only things there for 40 + ppl ate the crusader, priest and the King.<br/>
Of those only the King is good for 45 + ppl.<br/>
Deadside has Lord, Frenzied, Sent, Magi which all drop more valuable loot<br/>
<br/>
of course, if you&#39;re really talented as a puller, you can pull the Mino eldar to<br/>
the frenzied or Lord camps. not a super dooper mob but has a nice items for the<br/>
wis slingers. It is possible to do, I have the screen shots to prove it 8)<br/>

&gt; Howdy boys and girls.. Long time no write...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok first of all, had a very productive weekend, my guild and I held the Frog<br/>
&gt; King room for most of Sunday. Damn that little froggie is tough, once you<br/>
&gt; break the spawn up though it gets fairly easy. Picked up the crown on the<br/>
&gt; first spawn, but he only spawned one more time in an 8 hour period (another<br/>
&gt; crown) so I didn&#39;t get the Mith 2h I was hoping on. Oh well there is always<br/>
&gt; next weekend. Oh while I was in Guk I finally picked up a Serp Bracer, and<br/>
&gt; now I can&#39;t decide if I would rather do the Ac route or higher AGI/DEX. Any<br/>
&gt; thoughts on this one? (BTW as of now with one Serp Bracer my DEX is 120 and<br/>
&gt; AGI is 117 AC is hovering around 700)..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok now for the main question, I still have a little ways to go until lvl 50<br/>
&gt; and the Life Leech quest, but I wanted to get a start on it early. Do you<br/>
&gt; all think it would be better for me to have a lvl 50 guild mate pick up all<br/>
&gt; the items needed for the quest (he would go along with me, not do it for me)<br/>
&gt; or should I still get all the pieces myself and just wait till 50 to turn<br/>
&gt; them in?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh one last thing, anybody know why the Live side of Guk doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
&gt; have nearly as many people on it as the dead side. Over this weekend Guk was<br/>
&gt; hovering around 80 ppl and the dead side was packed (you could literally<br/>
&gt; walk around without fear of getting attack), but there was virtually no body<br/>
&gt; on the live side (Noble I think was the only mob camped)..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other than that, enjoy folks...<br/>
