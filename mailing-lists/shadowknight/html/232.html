<b>Subject:</b> Passage fron Qeynos to Guk <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118191803">Im a human SK (as i assumed you knew, being on this list) and want to<br/>
do a bit of travelling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know the best way to get to Guk from Qeynos?<br/>
And how well or ill are humans treated down there?<br/>
<br/>
Also i would like direction from Qeynos to Befallen.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping in mind of course that Rivervale must be avoided if possible. <br/>
I have a Necro comapanion who attempted to make it to Freeport via<br/>
Rvervale. Well, her Invis wore off, and she got hacked by the halfling<br/>
bastards. She proceeded to die another 6-7 times trying to regain her<br/>
corpse.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Bathory<br/>
