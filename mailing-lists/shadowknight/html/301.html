<div id="ygrps-yiv-279493399">Here is a handy tip for those of you who die in line of sight of KOS NPC&#39;s.  I discovered this with my druid character who can cast camo.  Get someone to cast invis or camo on you.  Make the /corpse command a hotkey.  Get near your corpse and drag it along to a safe spot in the zone by contiually clicking the hotkey with your mouse.  Your invis will not wear off until you right click on your corpse.</div>
