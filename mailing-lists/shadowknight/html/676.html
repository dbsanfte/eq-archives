<div id="ygrps-yiv-134945291">I believe that you&#39;re right on the assumption of weapon purchase.  The BBC <br/>
has a harsh AGI hit, but it a weapon that is accesable to players that want <br/>
to loot it.  Buying a combine 2h sword is expensive and usually you can get <br/>
your friends to help you just get the BBC.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Dark Reaver you do need a full party of 39 / 40 types if you want <br/>
to get it, and it&#39;s a rare drop at that.  You can find it on the market if <br/>
you like.  But you&#39;re looking to pay somewhere between 1500 and 3000pp.  To <br/>
some people that might seem like a lot of money, but since a lot of people <br/>
have started second characters the AGE of twinking has begun.  I ran into a <br/>
level 7 SK with full plate and a Dark Reaver yesterday. heh.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, getting the BIBS is a lot easier then the GZ.  Karg is too <br/>
hard to find, and generally doesn&#39;t stay alive when you do find him.  As an <br/>
SK it&#39;s hard to loot a lot of items because it takes forever to get <br/>
anywhere.  When I wanted to get a BiBs for my Shadowknight I just sent my <br/>
wizard to camp it instead (being honest).  Why would I want to have to run <br/>
from Nek, ec, nro, oasis, sro, innothle, feerot, rathe mount, lake rathe, <br/>
sk, nk, ek, beholder to runny to camp for such an item?  I could take a <br/>
chance to invis through rivervale but that would REALLY hurt if that wore <br/>
off, or some PC casted a spell on me that took off invis.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, why does our Vampiric Embrace do WAY less then a Necro&#39;s?  <br/>
Same spell should do same damage.  It&#39;s our ONLY way to get any HP back and <br/>
it&#39;s in battle.  Rangers, Paladains can heal fine, and they&#39;re based on <br/>
Druids and Clerics.  We&#39;re based on Necros and can&#39;t even do a simple life <br/>
tap.  Food for thought.<br/>

Okay, I&#39;ve played an SK before....some of you may remember me from WAY back <br/>
in the day when I was Vrathus on Cazic-Thule, but I only<br/>
got to 11th before deciding that being KOS was just not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
First off, your weapon descriptions lead me to think that you are buying <br/>
weapons at those levels, since it is my understanding that<br/>
a GZ isn&#39;t exactly easy to come by until about 35th level (with a group) and <br/>
you have it listed as a 21-30 weapon.  Also, Dark<br/>
Reavers are located in a very, very dangerous place, and I would imagine it <br/>
takes a party of low-40s to get it.<br/>
<br/>
Or is my view of things really skewed?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that the BBC is pretty much valueless -- seems that you can get <br/>
by with a Combine 2HS or SBH until you hit the level<br/>
necessary for BIBS.  Is there any real demand for the BBC?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried looking at the various Web pages for info on the SK quests, but <br/>
they are sorted by zone, and it is much more interesting<br/>
to me to see quests by class/race.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also interested in finding faction breakdowns, etc.<br/>
