<b>Subject:</b> Re: 1hs vs 2hs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234654046">I would like to know why I miss so much in battle.  I was grouping last<br/>
night and while everyone else (warriors and shamans) were hitting the bad<br/>
guys, I had tons of misses.  Is there some way that I can minimize it?<br/>
Also, I use 2-H slash because I like to look of the 2 handed axes even<br/>
though it is slower...<br/>

&gt; i also use 1hs weapons. i&#39;m not sure about other&#39;s experience, but for some<br/>
&gt; reason my 1hs skill seems to raise much more rapidly than my 2hs skill. also<br/>
&gt; i prefer the speed of one hand weapons, because for some ungodly reason my<br/>
&gt; hit rate is terrible, and the more chances to hit i get the more damage i<br/>
&gt; do. the ability to bash is also useful. besides, if you have a polished<br/>
&gt; granite tomahawk, what use have you for a two hander? ;)<br/>
