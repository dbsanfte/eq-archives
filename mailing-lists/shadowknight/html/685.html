Thank you for not including the entire digest in your <br/>
post!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1 factor I thought was hindering me for faction and <br/>
training in Neriak was the fact that Cronik worships <br/>
Cazic-Thule.  The Troll SK guild in Neriak is obviously <br/>
Innoruuk, but I&#39;m not sure that section&#39;s code is active <br/>
anymore.  I say thiis because the Shaman merchants that <br/>
the EQSS map shows in Neriak Foriegn Quarter are not <br/>
there anymore. <br/>
No one in the DE Necro/SK guildhall will give me quests <br/>
either. They all sputter something about &quot;in the <br/>
persence of The Dead. I shall strike you down.&quot; and then <br/>
just stand there.<br/>
<br/>
Possible solution:<br/>
1) To gain faction in Neriak give 1 bottle of Red Wine <br/>
to the Scribe.  This gives minor XP and faction with <br/>
guards and merchants.  Not sure about any other faction <br/>
adjustments as I have yet to do this one. A guild member <br/>
told me abut it. This is like the Give the Dwarf an Ale <br/>
to raise faction in Freeport (if I have the right <br/>
quest... I hate Freeport!).<br/>
2) To raise faction in Grobb with Night Keep SK guild  <br/>
give Hukulk 4 bone chips not stacked. Not sure what this <br/>
will accomplish with non-trolls. I got a rusty 2 hand <br/>
sword and guild faction.  May try it and see.  This will <br/>
lower faction with Da&#39;Bashers so con the guards first to <br/>
see how they react to you.  I have done this many times<br/>
(over 30) and they /con apprehensively to me.  I have no <br/>
idea what it was before though.<br/>
3)To raise faction with Da&#39;Bashers (and lower it with <br/>
Night Keep) give one of the leaders (no sure who) two <br/>
tadpole flesh and an eye (I think).<br/>
<br/>
And now a Quest Question.<br/>
<br/>
What Mob drops a Ruby that Lyguna is looking to collect? <br/>
I know the item does not say when right clicked on it <br/>
what Lyguna&#39;s description is. I hear that a Necro in <br/>
Feerot drops one. Is this correct? Any info would be <br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

&gt;Brian- <br/>
&gt;    About faction...If you can do anything abou this<br/>
&gt;one thing i am sure a LOT of sks would love is if we<br/>
&gt;could train in all the sk guilds.  I have only been to<br/>
&gt;4 guilds(i am a dark elf) neriak, freeport, grobb, and<br/>
&gt;oggok. I can only train in neriak and freeport. i do<br/>
&gt;not understand why i cannot train in/have access to<br/>
&gt;the quests in the sk guilds in grobb and oggok. <br/>
