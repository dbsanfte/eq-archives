<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048810595">Crusaders are actually pretty tough. They do Harm<br/>
Touch and its darn good one too. And the y hit for 80s<br/>
They were blue to me at 37. <br/>
I have had a horrible time finding them.<br/>
One person said his group killed about a dozen of them<br/>
in a 6 hour period at the Archon temple. I have been<br/>
at that same spot for a lot longer, and ive seen 3.<br/>
First dropped a left vambrace. Then the next day, one<br/>
dropped nothing, a few hours later another dropped a<br/>
bracer.<br/>
Thats it.<br/>
<br/>
Which leads to my question. Has anyone figured out a<br/>
spawn place/time for the crusaders?<br/>
<br/>
I have also heeard one spawns in the UTR.<br/>
<br/>
Still no sign of the cavalier.<br/>
<br/>
There is more camping time now than with rubi.<br/>
Oh well<br/>
