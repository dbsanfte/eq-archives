<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767651728">as far as SK&#39;s being underpowered....I just hit 9th level and am now<br/>
starting to cruise.  Our spells aren&#39;t the best....but they are fun.  Not<br/>
having to run to every critter i want to engage....being able to suck<br/>
str...and find my body::shuder:: if i die.  <br/>
<br/>
One question though that has been floating around.  A friend of mine asked<br/>
if Siphon Strength works multiple times on one critter.  I know you only<br/>
get the initial Str from the target...but if you keep casting does their<br/>
Str keep going down even if we are not taking it?<br/>
