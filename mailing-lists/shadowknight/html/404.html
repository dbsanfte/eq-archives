<b>Subject:</b> Another archery question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356668500">This one time i was practicing my archery and i was chasing this wolf,<br/>
now a guard walked into the arrows path, and it said i attack Guard<br/>
Jascen. And he proceeded to smack the heck out of me until i finally<br/>
zoned.<br/>
Now i checked my target and it still said the wolf.<br/>
<br/>
I have also noticed that when i cast fear on a creature and my pet is<br/>
chasing it, when i fire an arrow, i dont get the hit/miss message. Its<br/>
as if it was never reaching the target.<br/>
<br/>
Now heres my question,<br/>
Do you need an unobstucted path for the arrow to hit?<br/>
And if an NPC does get in the way, does it count as an attack, even<br/>
though they arent targeted?<br/>
<br/>
Im not complaining mind you. It actually makes sense. But i would like<br/>
to know if this is the way it works so i can plan a strategy<br/>
accordingly. Or was this just some weird fluke that could only happen<br/>
to me?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
