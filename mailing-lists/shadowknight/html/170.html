&gt; I do believe that Shadow Knight is great class with (in my opinion) a<br/>
&gt; few glitches.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On one point that Steven brought up, though, i must burst his bubble<br/>
&gt; some.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At this point in time your wife&#39;s SK will NOT get a lifetap spell.<br/>
&gt; The only spell available to us as a lifetap was Vampiric Embrace but<br/>
&gt; this isnt the case. Many have tried this spell in everyway imaginable<br/>
&gt; and no HP is transferred from the target to the caster. All it seems to<br/>
&gt; do is raise your attack for about 20 seconds.<br/>
&gt; **************<br/>
Vampiric touch sucks, got burnt on it myself, but you will get a lifetap<br/>
*****************<br/>
&gt; And as far as bashing and slamming. Thats Troll and Ogre specific.<br/>
&gt; Human, Gnome, Dark Elf and Euridite SKs never get slam and need a<br/>
&gt; shield to bash. But i personally dont see this as a problem.<br/>
&gt; *********<br/>
yup<br/>
*********<br/>
&gt; And anybody who can wield a halberd will do 24 dmg. Thats not SK only.<br/>
&gt; **********<br/>
and?<br/>
*******<br/>
&gt; The only things i feel could be improved is the Harm Touch should not<br/>
&gt; be resisted and at level 15, start getting HP drain spells that<br/>
&gt; actually work.<br/>
&gt; And at level 30 we can use Voice Graft. YEEEHAAAA!!! I can see myself<br/>
&gt; spending a couple plat on that one. This should definitely be replaced<br/>
&gt; with Gate or something worthwhile.<br/>
&gt; And Endure Cold and later Resist Cold dont make as much sense as having<br/>
&gt; a universal shield spells.<br/>
&gt; **************<br/>
ermm, sounds like you should try the necro...8)<br/>
***********<br/>
I still think SK are not underpowered at all, and are one of the best<br/>
classes in the game<br/>
lifedrain for a warrior at level 15?..ermmm, guess that would make me and my<br/>
wife no longer need that shaman,,,guess the healing classes would be<br/>
underpowered if the warrior classes start healing themselves..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
ever played a mud where there where multiclass players? you know, where one<br/>
guy could tank, heal and nuke? Well, theyre not too fun, and i think<br/>
grouping is where its at,<br/>
all classes on eq got there quirks,  for sure, but i think the sk are tuff,<br/>
and i think my necro is tuff...<br/>
I am level 15, and she is level 13...and i wouldnt have her play any other<br/>
class....if i thought there was a better combo, id change now....<br/>
She did get level 13 in 9 days, level 7 in one nite...bout a 14 hour nite<br/>
though...<br/>
my response was to the guy that gave up the class, saying SK are not that<br/>
good...<br/>
I have yet to hear or see anything to make me agree with him in the<br/>
slightest..<br/>
Morgul<br/>
&gt; upgraded, i obviously wouldnt complain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The comment was made by someone a while ago that these changes would<br/>
&gt; make the game easy. I fail to see this. I too dont want an easy<br/>
&gt; cakewalk of a game. But i would like my character to have equal skills<br/>
&gt; to other classes.<br/>
