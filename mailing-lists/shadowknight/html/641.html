 </span></blockquote>It was definately a WALK, now she may have been slowed by a Clinging Darkness or something, but I don&#39;t think so.  If memory serves me, she walked out the gate, held their a moment (a short distance from the gate away from the guards), then the DE jumped her.  It was very similar to how the Clothspinner girl moves out of the Qeynos gate (she is in a killing quest too, I believe).  I&#39;m not saying that it happens at all on a regular basis, I am just relaying what I observed.  It may or may not be a valid lead for you.<br/>
