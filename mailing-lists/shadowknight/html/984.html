<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016250340">If you don&#39;t mind a slightly (in my opinion) cheesy way to do it (cheesy,<br/>
yes, but t hat did not stop me from doing it! :D) go to the 3rd gate and to<br/>
the library. Go in and take a left. There is a green to&#39;biath there who<br/>
wants, I believe fish wine. This is just one of those, &quot;Buy 400000000 fish<br/>
wines and get the guy drunk as hell&quot; quests. I&#39;d also reccomend doing it<br/>
ASAP because all of the quests of this type that have existed in the past<br/>
have been removed after some time.</div>
