<br/>
i believe the 3 DE merchants in sro will give quests that raise faction in<br/>
neriak.<br/>
<br/>
as for the necro guild in qeynos, there are two ways to get there:<br/>
<br/>
1). in the arena of fate (the pvp area of qeynos, by the warrior guild)<br/>
there are some bones lying on the ground. follow them underneath the arena<br/>
of fate, and past some prison cells, where they will come to a halt at a<br/>
wall. pass through the wall and follow the tunnel, where you will soon come<br/>
out in qeynos sewers very near the bloodsaber&#39;s guild area. if you are KoS<br/>
by the steel warriors, and not high enough level to get invis, this method<br/>
WILL cause you to die messily, and possibly in a place where corpse recovery<br/>
is difficult.<br/>
<br/>
2). explore the qeynos sewers until you see the words &quot;Beware the<br/>
Plaguebringers!&quot; scrawled on a wall. this sign means you are near a hidden<br/>
entrance to the bloodsaber guild; look for a false wall here, and wander<br/>
around behind it until you find the guild itself.<br/>
<br/>
you will recognize the guild area by passing ranks of stationary skeletons,<br/>
then passing through a spear gate into a room lined with red rock, several<br/>
surly looking evil guys, and a very impressive pillar of blood in front of<br/>
and above you :)<br/>
