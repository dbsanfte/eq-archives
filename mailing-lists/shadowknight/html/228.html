&gt; I have also been told that everquest has never been balanced for pkill,<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; is not a pkill game, that was just thrown is as a request from some<br/>
&gt; customers. The classes are balanced for grouping, but not for pkill. I<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; also read that all tank types are getting smashed by pkill, as the mage<br/>
&gt; types target you... and blast you..you however have to stay on them in<br/>
&gt; order<br/>
&gt; to hit them...if you have ever followed  someone, expecially someone<br/>
&gt; trying<br/>
&gt; to avoid you(zigging and zagging) it is very hard for you to hit them.<br/>
&gt; As<br/>
&gt; soon as the mage gets away from you he zaps you, and he does not even<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; to have you on his screen. All that I have read confirms this...If you<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; chasing a monster down to hit him is hard, try chasing a player...<br/>
&gt; Throw in also pets, roots, sow etc...ermm...<br/>
&gt; EQ was not desighned for pkill...try it, you will find the warr types<br/>
&gt; are no<br/>
&gt; match.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I believe too that the Druid probably should have won, but it should<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; least have been a fight.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It sounds like the SK was used to mop the floor.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And the HT did an absolutely pitiful amount of damage.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which brings me back to my original complaints about the unreliability<br/>
&gt; &gt; or our &quot;special&quot; weapon.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course this does all depend on the types of weapons and armor both<br/>
&gt; &gt; had and their skills in their weapon&#39;s type, offense and defense.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But i have a feeling that the buffing skills of druids are just way<br/>
&gt; &gt; more effective than any damage the SK could have done with his spells.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since a druid will do the same amount of melee damage with a chosen<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon as a SK, they have a distinct advantage.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But we already know that SKs will be considerably weaker than most<br/>
&gt; &gt; other classes at low-mid levels.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would like to hear from a SK 30+ and see if the clouds lining gets<br/>
&gt; &gt; any shinier.<br/>
