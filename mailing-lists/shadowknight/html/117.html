<div id="ygrps-yiv-75327334">well, if they want to make ALL classes playable and fun, they cant have a<br/>
single class be overpowering at all levels. therefore, assuming that SK<br/>
becomes THE most powerful class (or close to it) at high level, they should<br/>
start out weak to make up for that. (in general, once you get to high level<br/>
you will BE high level much longer than you were low level). for instance,<br/>
at low level, warriors kick some major booty. they can solo fairly easily,<br/>
are quite capable of dishing out damage and absorbing it too, and have a lot<br/>
of str so they can wear heavy armor and carry a lot of loot. but once they<br/>
get to high level, they become little more than cannon fodder to keep the<br/>
nasties off of everybody else long enough to win the fight. on the other<br/>
hand, a wizard is tremendously weak at low level, often unable to survive<br/>
for long outside a group that knows what its doing. but once you get high in<br/>
level, the wizard gains godlike powers of destruction and mayhem that make<br/>
things scatter before them in fear. (thats the idea, anyway 8)). i think SKs<br/>
are closer to the latter category.. remember, while paladins can heal, and<br/>
rangers get a few modest DD spells, SK is the only class in the game that<br/>
can wear heavy armor and weapons AND cast significantly damaging combat<br/>
spells once they get to high level. most people would be deathly afraid of<br/>
somebody in full plate with a 20 damage vampiric sword, can zap you for 501<br/>
damage, cast heart flutter, and teleport around and go invis when you try to<br/>
fight back. and rightfully so :) remember, what you dont know sure can hurt<br/>
you! (a cookie to whoever guesses that reference!)<br/>
