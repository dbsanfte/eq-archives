<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790799492">If someone wants to do the math on it, I think you would actually have a<br/>
better chance of winning the lottery then collecting all the pieces needed.<br/>
<br/>
As I see it there are two possible solutions to this. The first would be to<br/>
make the armor always drop from the Crusaders. I don&#39;t mind the random<br/>
spawns, in fact I find it preferable (Harder for higher lvls to farm the<br/>
stuff for Twinks, BTW does anybody know if the armor itself is NO Drop???).<br/>
The other method would be to remove the no drop restriction from Decaying<br/>
armor (this would cause item farming though).. Either way personally I find<br/>
it unacceptable now and don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to go any further with the<br/>
quest. <br/>
<br/>
On a complete side note which do you all prefer, A Lizzie Cloak or a White<br/>
Wolf Cloak?<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy..<br/>

It is dropping..but it seems to be a 25% chance for a<br/>
drop..at least that has been our experience.<br/>
I personally have a Decayed Left Vambrace. A friend<br/>
has a Bracer.<br/>
Out of maybe 5 or 6 kills, those are the ony 2.<br/>
Another friend has killed about the same number and<br/>
got none.<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned before this is worse than camping rubi.<br/>
Not only do they seem to be slow spawns, but the<br/>
decayed stuff is a semi-rare drop. AND you need<br/>
multiple pieces for each piece of SK armor. So since<br/>
all the drops are random, you may never see the second<br/>
part to the one you already have. And since they are<br/>
NO DROP, you cant trade with your friends.<br/>
<br/>
What i am trying is offering cash for the location of<br/>
any crusader or for the looting rights to any decaying<br/>
armor. So far it hasnt worked. Too many SKs in the<br/>
zone who want it for themselves, but their are lots of<br/>
Rogues in their now. So i plan on holding any Raven<br/>
armor for ransom.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the grind<br/>
