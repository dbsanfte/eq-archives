<b>Subject:</b> Fletching? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-492039715">My DE shadowknight is trying to decide if it is possible at all to take up<br/>
fletching.  She was able to get a hickory bow from the Bleek Fletcher in<br/>
Neriak, and there is a fletching kit there, but only one of the components<br/>
for making arrows.<br/>
<br/>
My question is -- does anyone know where the dark races can get all of the<br/>
components required?  Naela is currently in Ogguk.<br/>
<br/>
Any and all help gratefully appreciated.<br/>
Naela</div>
