<div id="ygrps-yiv-873116556">Just had a random thought I wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure this will still fall under the &quot;damage shields in general are too<br/>
powerful&quot; area but what about a vampiric damage shield? It would be much<br/>
lower damage, say 2-4? but when transfer the life to us. This is completely<br/>
unthought out, I will say that in advance. The idea just popped into my head<br/>
and I thought I&#39;d share it.<br/>
