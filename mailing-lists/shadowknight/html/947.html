<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275346344">Some guards do see thru invis. I hear the Dwarven<br/>
guards are pretty good at that as well. Plus they can<br/>
outrun SOW. How such stumpy little legs can move that<br/>
fast is beyond me...<br/>
<br/>
As suggested previously, con them...if they give you<br/>
anything other than indifferent, they can see you.<br/>
Gather Shadows is REALLY flaky. Maybe i just have bad<br/>
luck, but it will wear off sometimes even before the<br/>
spell effects are finished swirling around me. And in<br/>
some places, its just horrible. In N Ro, oasis, and S<br/>
Ro, im lucky if it lasts 30 seconds. Cazic Thule and<br/>
Guk also dont treat my invis with much respect.<br/>
<br/>
I would STRONGLY suggest against binding in Oggok.<br/>
Ogers dont like humans regardless of the fact that we<br/>
are SKs. And the Bouncers see thru Shadows all the<br/>
time. Plus remember that when you hit your bind point,<br/>
its usually after youre dead. No spells, no Invis at<br/>
all. So if for some strange reason an Orge is near<br/>
your Bind point, you may get stuck in a very nasty<br/>
death/spawn/death loop. No pretty.<br/>
<br/>
Feign death. Has saved my but a few times. BUT..it<br/>
does have a casting time of 1.5 seconds, so it can be<br/>
interrupted. And it doesnt always work. As a matter of<br/>
fact, it has worked for me maybe only 25% of the time.<br/>
However this may depend on how close you are to the<br/>
MOB(s) that are aggro on you.<br/>
It seems to work pretty well in Guk. I went LD once<br/>
and came back to my group being gone, a shaman, undead<br/>
knight and some warrior who was hitting me for 80s. I<br/>
finally got a Feign off and it worked even with them<br/>
beating on me. It lasts forever as long as you just<br/>
lay there. I believe the aggro eventually leaves the<br/>
MOB, so you can theoretically, get up and walk away<br/>
after they are out of sight. Try that one at your own<br/>
risk though.<br/>
Cazic Thule on the other hand.. I have much less<br/>
success in CT with feign, though it has worked. They<br/>
just arent fooled as easily as the froggies<br/>
apparently.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1) Do guards see invis? I wonder because I hope that<br/>
&gt; now I can bind just<br/>
&gt; inside oggok or grobb when in cazic (I hate that<br/>
&gt; place) or guk (a little<br/>
&gt; better) to avoid the long long run back from E<br/>
&gt; Freeport.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) How long does feign death last? Indefinitely? Is<br/>
&gt; it usable in combat<br/>
&gt; situations? ie I am generally the only non-gater in<br/>
&gt; my group. Does it cast<br/>
&gt; quickly like shadow step so that I can cast it after<br/>
&gt; taunting 5 mobs on me<br/>
&gt; so my group can gate out of there? I know my<br/>
&gt; girlfriend is looking forward<br/>
&gt; to me getting feign death after I explained how it<br/>
&gt; works because she started<br/>
&gt; the game only recently but expects me to help her<br/>
&gt; level. Hmmm. No Level no<br/>
&gt; Lovin&#39;? Heh.<br/>
