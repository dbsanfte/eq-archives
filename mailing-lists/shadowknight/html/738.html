<div id="ygrps-yiv-366625460">Ok, first off, shadow step is a very handy spell, hate to see it get<br/>
replaced. Voice graft is as worthless to the SK as it is to the necros.<br/>
Lifetaps are not going to be what some here envision. I think you will find<br/>
them worthless after level 20, expecially if they fall 2 ranks behind that<br/>
of the necro. I would still trade voice graft for anything. Shadow step has<br/>
saved my arse more than once, and I would miss this spell.<br/>
I think they are fine as they are, but if you want to add a new spell, make<br/>
it a DOT, a damage spell. I mean, what are you going to do with a lifetap?<br/>
After the battle, run around and zap spiderlings till your healed up? This<br/>
would be the only use. The spell is too slow to cast when your in melee.  I<br/>
would trade the pet and the Voice graft/other useless spells for another<br/>
stackable DOT spell. The damage shield would be awesome too, but this musta<br/>
made the SK class too powerful, thats why it was removed.<br/>
