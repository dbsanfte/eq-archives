<b>Subject:</b> 9th Level!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299180325">I hit level 9 last night and ran like the clappers to Grobb to buy all my <br/>
spells.  There awful cheap when you think we have to level 9 to start <br/>
casting them!!!  I bought them all and was practicing them on some poor <br/>
helpless Froglok Tads near the bashers!!!<br/>
<br/>
Plus I got to help some brand new characters against multiple Kobold&#39;s <br/>
ganging up on then, since I was in the area!<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of question for you experts out there?<br/>
<br/>
1 - Does that drain strength spell only work the once on you, ie It does or <br/>
doesn&#39;t stack???<br/>
<br/>
2 - How does the Attack delay work on weapons???  I have both the Bone <br/>
Claymore and then Big axe from Lynuga, I&#39;ve been using the Axe but I&#39;m not <br/>
sure which is better?<br/>
<br/>
Spells are great especially Summon Skelly, it&#39;s actually nice to have <br/>
somebody to walk around with, since I solo most of the time.  I never seem <br/>
to have players on-line at my level!! Oh well!<br/>
<br/>
Oh yea, I&#39;m on the Quellious Server, which had it&#39;s First Birthday <br/>
Yesterday, so any of you out there fancy playing a Troll Shadow Knight on a <br/>
new server come join me and build up quick, then we could start our own <br/>
exclusive Guild!!!!<br/>
