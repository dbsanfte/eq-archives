Man, unrest is prime hunting for a SK, and there are drybones strewed about<br/>
the place. Please not has been least 6 months since ive been, there, and<br/>
armor drops may have changed.  But, Dry bones are anywhere in the house, and<br/>
they used to drop small bronze...<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously I have srtuck a nerve.... my appologies.<br/>
I may not have been entirely clear with why I am being so inquisitive about<br/>
armor and such. Lasombra is 1st level and sitting on a log in Nektulos<br/>
Forrest. He has not been to the guild trainer, nor has he attacked anything<br/>
yet. He has turned in his guild note though. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My current primary character (26th level Druid) is going to twink Lasombra<br/>
with what I can find. Since I had (until you were kind enough to help me) no<br/>
clue where to find small bronze armor, I continued to narrow the location<br/>
from &quot;Unrest&quot; to a smaller area. Like &quot;the main floor back door entry has 4<br/>
mobs that should have it&quot;.  Since it appears that Drybone skeletons are the<br/>
primary MoBs that have Small Bronze, I will be checking out 3 places as my<br/>
Druid; Lake Rathetear, Befallen and Unrest. If this assumption is wrong, let<br/>
me know.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to waste time wandering Norrath auctioning for small bronze, or<br/>
attacking the wrong MoBs looking for it, as I want Lasombra to become my<br/>
Primary character as fast as I can. Now I have specific locations to go and<br/>
auction and/or hunt for it.  That was my goal, it has been achieved. Thank<br/>
you for your patience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I plan on being very vocal and asking alot of questions. I want my SK to do<br/>
well, and this is the best place to get the advise I am seeking. Future<br/>
topics include: weapons, tactics, faction, and quests.<br/>
<br/>
When I was my TSK, Xilth(sp?) and Beld were my source of knowledge, and I am<br/>
happy to see Beld out of his 30s and almost 50 (lets you know how long ago<br/>
that was. heh.). Congrats to you, you deserve it. Countess Bathory still<br/>
here as well?<br/>
<br/>
Look for many more exciting emails from my corner.<br/>
