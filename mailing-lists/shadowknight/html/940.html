<b>Subject:</b> Getting my EQ fix any way I can (gee, this got real long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-612462191">Hello all. been a week or so since I posted so I figured I&#39;d say hi to you<br/>
all and plus, I have exams so I am studying and can&#39;t play EQ &#39;till<br/>
Thursday! Noonononono! So I&#39;m getting my fix.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m almost at the magical number. Well, for me anyways. I have been looking<br/>
forward to getting level 30 for a long time (this trip from 22 to 30 with<br/>
NOTHING new but hit points has been a long one -- anyone else think so<br/>
too?). I&#39;m the big voice graft proponent here (puts on flame-resistant<br/>
pants) and I can&#39;t wait to get the spell. Plus I think in overall<br/>
usefullness 30 is one of the biggest levels (feign death, boil blood,<br/>
invisibility (YEAH!!! I can finally get bound in grobb and oggok!!) I&#39;ve<br/>
been spending a decent amount of time at the Treants in S Karana lately to<br/>
get experience and while it is boring it is decent money and relatively safe<br/>
(although I have died a few times because my group goes afk or something<br/>
when the trees appear so I end up soloing two spell casting treants! Ack!).<br/>
I don&#39;t particularly enjoy this ... I prefer dungeons or more dangerous yet<br/>
more exhilirating combat etc but my desire to get 30 has turned me into a<br/>
powergamer for the last two levels.<br/>
<br/>
Couple of thoughts/questions other than my simple random babblings:<br/>
<br/>
1) Do guards see invis? I wonder because I hope that now I can bind just<br/>
inside oggok or grobb when in cazic (I hate that place) or guk (a little<br/>
better) to avoid the long long run back from E Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
2) How long does feign death last? Indefinitely? Is it usable in combat<br/>
situations? ie I am generally the only non-gater in my group. Does it cast<br/>
quickly like shadow step so that I can cast it after taunting 5 mobs on me<br/>
so my group can gate out of there? I know my girlfriend is looking forward<br/>
to me getting feign death after I explained how it works because she started<br/>
the game only recently but expects me to help her level. Hmmm. No Level no<br/>
Lovin&#39;? Heh.<br/>
<br/>
3) About time we got a disease spell (Endure Disease). As someone else has<br/>
said in the past ... it owuld really make sense for us to get CURE disease<br/>
like necros. You should be able to undo anything that you can do.<br/>
<br/>
4) General thought about shadowknights. Well, first ... I personally just<br/>
wonder if Brian is still on the list. We haven&#39;t heard from him in a while.<br/>
Secondly ... I really have to wonder something. We all agree that pets are<br/>
useless (EXCEPT FOR VOICE GRAFT!! MUHAHAHAHA) for us in most cases. HOWEVER<br/>
... I am not so sure that Verant would be willing to make such a MASSIVE and<br/>
SWEEPING change to shadowknights, or *any* class as we all want. ie get rid<br/>
of pets and give us other spells (cure disease, line of damage shields if<br/>
they could be balance (I still like this one a LOT but then again I&#39;m<br/>
human), etc). The closest thing to a change this massive has been the<br/>
warrior upgrade but while they had some massive changes things were *only*<br/>
added to the class. Nothing was taken away like it would be for the SK&#39;s<br/>
(even if we all mostly agree that the stuff they&#39;d take away is useless).<br/>
Because of this I wonder what will happen to us. Brian already stated that<br/>
new spells will not be added without removal of old ones (to keep us even<br/>
with rangers, pallies (and I will make no further comment on &quot;even&quot;)) and<br/>
just from the comments I keep hearing from Verant people, if it wasn&#39;t for<br/>
Brian being on this list from a time I would have not thought they were even<br/>
considering buffing SK&#39;s at all. Just yesterday Brad said on some newsgroup<br/>
(it was quoted on eqvault) in response to someone&#39;s comment on SK&#39;s and that<br/>
no one internally had every played one to 50 or something, while he never<br/>
said that SK&#39;s were GOOD he did insist that people played SK&#39;s and that at<br/>
least one staffer had taken one to 50. It just doesn&#39;t seem to me (save for<br/>
Brian&#39;s comments here and some of these were flaky on the issue) that Verant<br/>
deems that SK&#39;s need that much if any tweaking at all.<br/>
<br/>
On that line as well ... the point remains that while there is some SK only<br/>
stuff there is very little. The reaper of the dead, well, it sucks. You<br/>
can&#39;t get it until lvl 25 at least in a group and while my friends and I<br/>
were getting it, well, gee, the TSK spawned and I got a BBC. I used the<br/>
Reaper until my skill was maxed (any young SK&#39;s out there -- TRAIN IN 2HS<br/>
FROM THE BEGINNING!!! -- I started it at lvl 25 and it was a *royal pain in<br/>
the a$$*) because it is the fastest 2hs available save for the GZ and other<br/>
expensive stuff. But I&#39;m sure as hell not going to keep using the Reaper of<br/>
the Dead for 12 damage at 40 delay when I can add 5 delay for 5 damage now<br/>
that my skill is maxed. The reaper looks really really good and I loathed to<br/>
give it up. I waited a week after I maxed my skill in fact to do so but<br/>
since I am the only tank in my group it was clearly lacking in tank<br/>
firepower. I refuse to use a BIBS (functionality overweighs looks but only<br/>
to an extent!) because it just looks to stupid but am actively searching for<br/>
a GZ to rid myself of that agility hit (although I got a cloak of leaves by<br/>
dumb luck last week while we were medding in S Karana!). So to get back on<br/>
topic (I&#39;m way off I know)... why is there so little SK stuff? Tanks/Hybrids<br/>
are highly dependant on equipment yet we have little. Is it because there<br/>
are so  few SK&#39;s? Why are there so few SK&#39;s? Part of me likes it that way<br/>
(for RP purposes and such ... I&#39;d sure hate it if next month there were as<br/>
many SK&#39;s as there are druids).<br/>
<br/>
Well, time to work. If you made it this far, congrats, you survived my<br/>
ramblings. I&#39;m sure there are plenty more where that came from. Lets get<br/>
this list going again, even without Brian to fuel our fire of actually<br/>
getting something done! (Come back to us Brian!).<br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>
