<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504973967">Well this place is called Unrest. If yer level 16-high 30&#39;s you will have <br/>
something here to kill. A full group of 18+ can kill most anything if they <br/>
have enough clerics.<br/>
<br/>
To get here you have to get to the freeport docks, Sail to yhe butcherblock <br/>
mtns, Jump off the boat before the bay, best thing to do is find the road, <br/>
get an invis and hire a guide if u dont know the way.<br/>
And of course you want a bind. You will have to get to greater faydark. The <br/>
home of the wood elves. You can get bound right at the zone. be careful of <br/>
wondering guards irf you get curious in that zone.<br/>
After you get bound, Go back to the butcherblocks and follow the left wall. <br/>
You will avoid guards and get to Dagnor&#39;s cauldron. This is the zone that <br/>
takes you to unrest.<br/>
Now, Run along the coastline, the zone wall is very difficult and you will <br/>
take lots of falling dmg. You will see a dimly blue lit tunnel about halfway <br/>
around. This is unrest.<br/>
Unreast is  an estate with a large mansion, a big courtyard with a 14th <br/>
century style hedge maze and, a few lil tricks.<br/>
     At low and mid teen levels, i would reccomend going on the right side <br/>
of the estate near the gazebo. You will find Death beetles, tormented dead, <br/>
Jack o lanterns and  a few skeletons.<br/>
    Later teens you will wnat to group and pull from the first level mansion <br/>
and if you are in high teens and have a good FULL group, pull Carrion <br/>
Ghouls, Dry bones and lurking Mummies.<br/>
   The things to look out for are Skeletal moinks, barbed bones, Greater <br/>
Dark Bones, Zombies of an unrest noble and MOST OF ALL, The festering hag. <br/>
She is a 30some level spellcaster from what i have seen. I have killed her <br/>
but only after she spends all her mana. at 20th level two spells from her <br/>
can kill me.<br/>
  This is a great placee for loot. Many things carry small ringmail, spell <br/>
components, Platinum pieces and occasional bronze Platemail, vrey sought <br/>
after on this island. But unfortunaltely fer the ogers and Trolls, Its <br/>
small. Well i think i gave as much info as i can.  Good luck if ya come <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
I got 17-20th level in a week here and am skyrocketing up.<br/>
<br/>
