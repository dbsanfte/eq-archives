<div id="ygrps-yiv-522198317">I finished the first part and am on the Kerra Isle beetle portion.  My<br/>
question is this: I received a wrist pouch and a box from the NPC who<br/>
assigned the quest.  He said the box was for beetle eyes, but I don&#39;t<br/>
know what the pouch is for.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for the elephant tusk,<br/>
but I would like to know if is a part of the quest.  Thanks for any<br/>
help.<br/>
