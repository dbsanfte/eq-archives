<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094263711">Jyle is, 35? You won&#39;t be killing jyle solo. He is 30 or 35 and also has a<br/>
30 or 35 (actually, 30 I think for both of them) warrior guard. Jyle is a<br/>
druid so you can&#39;t kite him. But the Errolisi sisters are another story.<br/>
They are actually pretty low level. 10 maybe? I don&#39;t remember. They were<br/>
green to me by the time I got there. There are some named sisters however<br/>
that are 25 or so and are quite good experience and generally not camped<br/>
seeing as how they are &quot;good&quot; If you can take the two that are in a hut<br/>
together you can also make good money seeing as how one of them (larissa I<br/>
think) has a 10-plat longsword every time (8minute spawn).<br/>
<br/>
As for crushbone, yeah, trolls are kos there by default. I don&#39;t know how<br/>
hard it is to change that (I don&#39;t know any trolls that have tried). If/when<br/>
you do go there, the slaves are very low level, like level 5 maybe 10. I<br/>
often killed them in a single double attack at level 20 with my reaper of<br/>
the dead. Do not try and kill the little gnome magician though unless you<br/>
are 30+ (maybe higher) as he is a really nasty bugger.<br/>

&gt; &gt;1) Not anymore as far as I know. You used to be able to but they removed<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Da Bastards! Heh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3) Yes, killing wood elf slaves raises indigo brotherhood faction, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;killing high elf slaves raises The Dead faction. I personally<br/>
&gt; spent 5 days<br/>
&gt; &gt;there, many hours a day, killing those elves until I could do<br/>
&gt; the quests in<br/>
&gt; &gt;the house of the dead to raise my faction up. It took a long time but was<br/>
&gt; &gt;worth it in the end.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; YES! Woohoo! Thanks for that update! I assume Crushbone Orcs KoS everboby.<br/>
&gt; AllaKhazam says killing Eriolissi Sisters, and Jyle Windshot<br/>
&gt; (assume the one<br/>
&gt; in Freeport) increase faction in Crushbone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That gives me 3 more questions.<br/>
&gt; 1) What level are the Highelf (or any for that matter) slaves?<br/>
&gt; 2) What level are the Eriolissi Sisters in OOT? (lowest and what<br/>
&gt; are of the<br/>
&gt; island?)<br/>
&gt; 3) What level is Jyle?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>
