<div id="ygrps-yiv-863483054">I also think this armor should be no drp. C&#39;mon, bronze armor is given away<br/>
now on cazik thule, and It used to be hard to get hold of. What few newbies<br/>
there are have at least banded on. All have become worthless. I would like<br/>
to see twinkability limited to the bronze. I think if you want this armor,<br/>
you should have to go get it yourself. I have no clue what they are<br/>
thinking....<br/>

&gt; Hmm this is disturbing.. I liked the fact that lowbies couldn&#39;t get the<br/>
&gt; armor unless they did it themselves. My opinion is that all class specific<br/>
&gt; armor should be No Drop, if you can&#39;t do the quest with the character that<br/>
&gt; will be wearing the armor then you shouldn&#39;t have it. (But of course i&#39;m<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; of those that thinks there should be level limits on armor and equipment<br/>
&gt; anyway.. I hate seeing lvl 10 and under Sk&#39;s with a DR or similar)..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway... I think I&#39;ll feedback it as well when I get on tonight..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh something that was kind of bugging me, is there anyway to delete a<br/>
spell<br/>
&gt; from your spell book? The since the new lifetaps didn&#39;t overwrite the<br/>
&gt; existing spells I still have them in my book (and obviously can&#39;t use<br/>
&gt; them).. I&#39;ve moved them to like page 15 or so, but would like to delete<br/>
&gt; them. Any ideas?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enjoy<br/>
