<b>Subject:</b> Faction with trolls, and spore guardian quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-220255401">i believe when you do the bone chip quest for hukulk, you<br/>
get increased faction with da bashers, and troll sk.  you<br/>
also get lowered faction with greenbloods(ogre sks?) and<br/>
ogre warriors.  i never seen the spore guardian, but i<br/>
have heard shouts of him killing a bunch of newbies, who<br/>
wanted me to find him.  unfortunately i couldnt.  however,<br/>
i bought the head off of someone, and the prize is pretty<br/>
decent.  i bought it for 15 gold, and got the mask and 5<br/>
gold upon completion.   then i sold my leather mask i was<br/>
wearing, and got 2 plat, so i actually made money by<br/>
buying the head!  the mask itself isnt great, it is same<br/>
ac as leather,  with +2 to dex and int.<br/>
gugbug, lvl 11 troll sk<br/>
