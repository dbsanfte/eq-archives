<div id="ygrps-yiv-593631371">I submitted the beginning info on that quest.<br/>
When i delivered Trumpy Irontoe&#39;s to Grimrot i was<br/>
only level 10. At that time i didnt have a clue as to<br/>
what the quest was for.<br/>
When i asked grimrot about Arlena (which was the the<br/>
keyword he gave me when i turned the skull) he told me<br/>
about Arlena who he created, but she took off while he<br/>
was away. He suspected that she headed back to her<br/>
home which was Mistmoore. He askes that you track her<br/>
down and bring back her bones. <br/>
<br/>
Now, some how, some way someone thought to bring back<br/>
a lute from a named gypsy (not Arlena) to grimrot.<br/>
I have no idea where they got that info from.<br/>
<br/>
I have talked to Grimrot a few times after that, and<br/>
he has always me for her remains.<br/>
<br/>
I know people who have extensivly traveled Mistmoore,<br/>
and no Arlena is to be found.<br/>
There are various gypsies, vampyres and so forth. But<br/>
no one named Arlena.<br/>
<br/>
Either she never existed, or Verant hid her under<br/>
another name.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else,forgot name, found out the lute part.<br/>
Again, i have no idea where that came from.<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to actually venture into Mistmoore myself. <br/>
Getting stuck on that wretched continent with those<br/>
putrid High Elves and dirtmongering Dwarves is not my<br/>
idea of a good time.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to see what my faction is before i go in<br/>
there. I made the mistake in Najena by just going in<br/>
there and killing stuff, when my faction was Dubious<br/>
with all but the undead. I think i may try to get in<br/>
there and talk with NPCs before i start trying to kill<br/>
them. Never know what i may uncover :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, i had more to write, its time to go home and<br/>
actually play :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bye<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; a weird question just popped into my head :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; it was YOU who found the EBW thru the grimrot quest,<br/>
&gt; right bathory?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; well.. have you tried doing the grimrot quest since<br/>
&gt; somebody said that the<br/>
&gt; EBW was obtained via the the avenging caitiff in MM<br/>
&gt; (which makes it damn<br/>
&gt; near impossible for us to get one now ;p)? who<br/>
&gt; knows.. there may be TWO ways<br/>
&gt; to get this weapon.. :)<br/>
