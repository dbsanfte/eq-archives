<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-378571988">Something that has to be considered though is how much damage does said<br/>
Troll also take (AGI and/or Dex) and what is the actual average damage. Max<br/>
damage is nice but in the overal picture if the two SK&#39;s were to fight the<br/>
exact same mob (and if we were able to eliminate the randomness involved),<br/>
how would the fight end. Would the Troll do more damage and end the fight<br/>
quicker but in the process also take more damage than said DE SK.. <br/>
 <br/>
Any ideas?<br/>

Actually, I am a 33rd level DE sk, and with my reaver I do between 55 and 60<br/>
max, my strength with the sword buff is only around 125 or so, now I was<br/>
grouping with a troll SK the other day, and her strength was near 200, and<br/>
she was whacking for about 80 points max, now while this is a hug<br/>
diffeerence in strength, it does show that it does count. <br/>

I have yet to see any Noticable Differance from the big races to the little<br/>
races. The big races have more STR and Stamina, and have to get agility/dex<br/>
items. The smaller races gather more of the +STR items. Str and Stamina do<br/>
not seem to have any REALLY great noticable effects. I know STr affects<br/>
attack, etc.. But, has anyone noticed a level 40 ogre SK doing far greater<br/>
Damage than a level 40 DE sk? I havent.Course Troll regen is nice for<br/>
soloing, shrug. Not complaining, just STR doesnt seem to have the affect for<br/>
warrior types as it has on other muds or roleplaying games. I guess the slam<br/>
advantage is ok when your fighting casters. Not sure its worth all the<br/>
racial penalties though, heh. Least they got shrink now...8) Morgul</div>
