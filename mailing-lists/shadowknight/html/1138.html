<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632849770">Hmm this is disturbing.. I liked the fact that lowbies couldn&#39;t get the<br/>
armor unless they did it themselves. My opinion is that all class specific<br/>
armor should be No Drop, if you can&#39;t do the quest with the character that<br/>
will be wearing the armor then you shouldn&#39;t have it. (But of course i&#39;m one<br/>
of those that thinks there should be level limits on armor and equipment<br/>
anyway.. I hate seeing lvl 10 and under Sk&#39;s with a DR or similar)..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... I think I&#39;ll feedback it as well when I get on tonight..<br/>
<br/>
Oh something that was kind of bugging me, is there anyway to delete a spell<br/>
from your spell book? The since the new lifetaps didn&#39;t overwrite the<br/>
existing spells I still have them in my book (and obviously can&#39;t use<br/>
them).. I&#39;ve moved them to like page 15 or so, but would like to delete<br/>
them. Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy<br/>

I came across some disturbing info last night...<br/>
Darkforge Armor is no longer NO DROP.<br/>
All the pieces that I have that WERE NO DROP, arent<br/>
any longer.<br/>
This is bad,bad,bad,bad....<br/>
Item farming was bad enough before.<br/>
Having the DF armor NO DROP saved us from having to<br/>
compete with other who want the items to sell or twink<br/>
their level 5 SKs with.<br/>
Now we are back to square one.<br/>
BTW...Why can ANYONE do these quests?<br/>
It is SK only armor.<br/>
And the same should go for all the other class armors<br/>
as well. These quests are supposed to be for a<br/>
specific class, yet anyone can do them?<br/>
Thats just stupid.<br/>
<br/>
I for one am doing the FEEDBACK thing telling them of<br/>
my extreme displeasure at this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah..for some odd reason..the Hulking Gorillas in<br/>
the LTR now drop Decaying everytime<br/>
*shrug*..ya got me on that one<br/>
