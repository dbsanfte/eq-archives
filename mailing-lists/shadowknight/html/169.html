<div id="ygrps-yiv-213701030">I do believe that Shadow Knight is great class with (in my opinion) a<br/>
few glitches.<br/>
<br/>
On one point that Steven brought up, though, i must burst his bubble<br/>
some.<br/>
<br/>
At this point in time your wife&#39;s SK will NOT get a lifetap spell.<br/>
The only spell available to us as a lifetap was Vampiric Embrace but<br/>
this isnt the case. Many have tried this spell in everyway imaginable<br/>
and no HP is transferred from the target to the caster. All it seems to<br/>
do is raise your attack for about 20 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as bashing and slamming. Thats Troll and Ogre specific.<br/>
Human, Gnome, Dark Elf and Euridite SKs never get slam and need a<br/>
shield to bash. But i personally dont see this as a problem.<br/>
<br/>
And anybody who can wield a halberd will do 24 dmg. Thats not SK only.<br/>
<br/>
The only things i feel could be improved is the Harm Touch should not<br/>
be resisted and at level 15, start getting HP drain spells that<br/>
actually work.<br/>
And at level 30 we can use Voice Graft. YEEEHAAAA!!! I can see myself<br/>
spending a couple plat on that one. This should definitely be replaced<br/>
with Gate or something worthwhile.<br/>
And Endure Cold and later Resist Cold dont make as much sense as having<br/>
a universal shield spells.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, i feel the pets are fine as they are. Though if they got<br/>
upgraded, i obviously wouldnt complain.<br/>
<br/>
The comment was made by someone a while ago that these changes would<br/>
make the game easy. I fail to see this. I too dont want an easy<br/>
cakewalk of a game. But i would like my character to have equal skills<br/>
to other classes.<br/>
