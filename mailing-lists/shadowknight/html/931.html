<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-307163751">ok xillith, this is important, since you said that the bayle list quest<br/>
seemed to be broken on your side :) now, were you trying to return the bayle<br/>
list to the npc in QEYNOS, or the npc in FREEPORT? :) i intend to turn the<br/>
list in to the freeport npc, but since you said it was broken and i dont<br/>
know which, i&#39;m too scared to try! hehe.. it took too much time and too much<br/>
luck to get as far as i am now to throw it away on a roadblock..<br/>
<br/>
my take on arlena is that, since there is no arlena npc, maybe one of the<br/>
nasty undead things in mistmoore is &quot;arlena&quot;? or maybe arlena died at some<br/>
point, and some other npc picked up her remains. this is another good reason<br/>
to raise faction in mistmoore, so we can go there and talk to npcs and see<br/>
if any of them know anything about arlena.<br/>
