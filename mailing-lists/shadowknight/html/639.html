&gt; gate.  She was immediately killed by a Dark Elf<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did she WALK out or RUN out? I used to pull her out of the gates so my troll<br/>
friends could bash on her too. She is so much fun to kill.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the &quot;mammoth&quot; that was spoken of is not a mammoth  but a bear in<br/>
Surefall Glade that is named &quot;Mammoth&quot; I don&#39;t know any more about this<br/>
since I don&#39;t think I&#39;m liked to well in Surefall Glade. In fact, I&#39;m quite<br/>
sure they don&#39;t approve of me. :)<br/>
