<div id="ygrps-yiv-820853694">Could someone give me specific info on how to get the BBC?  I&#39;d like to know how to get there, what zones to go through, what I have to fight, and what level I should be to solo, or what level a group should be to get it. <br/>
<br/>
Also, does anybody know where in lavastorm Sir Lindeal is, and what level he is?  I&#39;d also like to know if anybody knows how to make snake skin clothing.  I&#39;ve been trying many combinations of ingredients, but have always failed to find anything that worked.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Kakarot, Innoruuk</div>
