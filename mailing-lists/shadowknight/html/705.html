<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233738578">Maybe someone could explain this too me.  I&#39;m not sure why a human SK would have any tougher of a time than say a human paladin as their stats are almost identical.  I&#39;m under the impression that DE&#39;s and Humans have a tougher time in melee than the big races (because of inherent STR/STA and Slam), but not to the point of not making them a viable class.  I also tend to think exp penalties even this out a lot.  The penalty on the TSK is HUGE (to the point where I&#39;ve about given up on this character).  I&#39;m in the 20&#39;s now and it takes me WEEKS of real time to level (partly due to the constant KoS problems which causes at least 4 deaths per level).  That&#39;s why I&#39;m moving on the experiment with other character classes and races.  If it takes me 3 weeks now to level in the 20&#39;s, what will it be like at 40?  I&#39;m convinced if I was playing a human I would at least be 25th by now, if not higher.<br/>

elves do. As for being the most difficult (or second-most) class combo, why <br/>
is it that there are 3 level 50 human SKs on Fennin Ro and only 1 level 50 <br/>
dark elf SK?</div>
