<div id="ygrps-yiv-343570879">I agree with the difficulty of the human sk.  Though it is debateable about <br/>
its toughness to play.  The erudite necromancer is probably the most <br/>
difficult class to play.  I dunno about what other classes to play, but I <br/>
think that trolls are pretty nice.  They are extremely easy during their <br/>
first 7 levels then it slows down to vast degrees.  They do become arguably <br/>
more powerful than the others because they can do more damage on average.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t stress this, but I recommend troll.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, shadowknight pets don&#39;t suck!! :P<br/>

&gt;actually.. human sk is NOT easy. in fact, it is probably THE single hardest<br/>
&gt;class/race combo in the game.. and if you are a worshipper of toxxy.. talk<br/>
&gt;about hard times :) at least the qeynos SK guild kicks ass..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;the reason for this is that our stats are mediocre, and despite whatever<br/>
&gt;info is out there our faction is NOT significantly better anywhere than the<br/>
&gt;other SK races. human SK can still only get into 3 towns (freeport, qeynos,<br/>
&gt;and neriak), which is par for SK of any race. really our main advantages is<br/>
&gt;that we are physically a bit stronger than dark elves, are more agile and<br/>
&gt;intelligent than ogres and trolls, and we have one of the highest charisma<br/>
&gt;ratings in the game (buying things cheap is a definite plus).  with all my<br/>
&gt;jeweller buddy&#39;s special equipment, i can get cha over 100 ;) if you want <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;make a first-time sk, be a troll. your xp gains will really suck (penalty<br/>
&gt;for combo class AND penalty for large race) but the hp regen REALLY helps<br/>
&gt;you, as well as your mighty trollish strength. plus trolls have some of the<br/>
&gt;best SK quests that WORK at the moment.  so basically, be a troll unless <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;seek even greater challenge :) just my 2 pesos<br/>
