<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071670182">ok, upon further investigation i have determined that you can obtain it<br/>
by giving the thex mallet to the SK in neriak who gives out quests.<br/>
those of you who know what the thex mallet is may cower in the corner<br/>
while i explain to the rest: the thex mallet is in 3 parts, all of which<br/>
are in the dungeon of befallen. two of those parts can be found randomly<br/>
on elf skeletons. the third is held by a special monster, commander<br/>
windstream, a lvl 35 zombie. he ONLY appears if you bring a note from<br/>
the neriak guild to lrodd. the problem for me is, i dont know the<br/>
keywords to use to get that quest, and in order to get it, i have to<br/>
complete a quest that i CANT GET because i am too high level. for the<br/>
record, i consider this Really Stupid. if anybody learns the keywords<br/>
needed to begin the thex mallet quest, do tell so that we dont have to<br/>
steal windstream from others :) once you have the 3 mallet pieces, you<br/>
have to combine them (using, i THINK, the smithing skill in a forge).<br/>
the mallet itself is useable, but has rather mediocre stats considering<br/>
what you have to do to get it. the important part is to turn it in to<br/>
the guild to obtain your handy ring of the dead! i will grab the hammer<br/>
my guild has put together as soon as the guy with it returns from<br/>
faydwer.. i&#39;ll let you know how things turn out.<br/>
