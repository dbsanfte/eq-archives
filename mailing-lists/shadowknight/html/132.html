&gt; yes shadow knights are KoS in rivervale, but you CAN go in a few feet if you<br/>
&gt; ever need to be bound there. the only way we have to go between the two main<br/>
&gt; human cities is via highpass. if you have never been there, or are under lvl<br/>
&gt; 20 or so, i&#39;d reccomend you have somebody lead you thru with invis or SoW.<br/>

monsters? I play a dark elf and I&#39;d like to visit Quenos and Rivervale etc<br/>
and would appreciate some feedback from another who has successfully<br/>
managed to do this<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
