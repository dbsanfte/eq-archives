&gt; &gt; Now if getting Bloodsabre faction were only so easy...<br/>

&gt; Getting Bloodsaber faction IS easy. Just kill any of those Brothers Chintle,<br/>
&gt; Estle, etc. EXCEPT for Trintle. You&#39;ll get a Bloodsaber increase every time,<br/>
&gt; and they&#39;re like level 15 or something. Trintle is the one with the torch,<br/>
&gt; so just let him live and kill the rest over and over, ta dah Bloodsaber<br/>
&gt; faction.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done this alot, but I&#39;m at indifferent now, so it&#39;s gonna<br/>
take a while.  I can&#39;t do any of the quests except for prayer beads<br/>
and orders of thunder, which I&#39;ve done a few times.  I kill Brother<br/>
Drash<br/>
every time I pass by in S Karanas, and Chintle (as well as any wandering<br/>
paladin) every time I&#39;m in W Karanas, and I&#39;m still indifferent.<br/>
I guess it&#39;s just going to take a while, I should set up camp and just<br/>
slay away sometime...<br/>
