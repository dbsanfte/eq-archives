<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141395427">I am pretty dissapointed with the shadowknight quests also, ive tried a few<br/>
freeport ones, return the note to lucan or return to dismal rage...very<br/>
little reward there and barely any exp...<br/>
<br/>
ive tried to kill groflah steadirt twice, once at level 24 once at level<br/>
35...the first time i had help the second time i killed him myself. But both<br/>
times his corpse dissapears with no note! I complained to a GM that this<br/>
happened twice and my faction was going to hell with freeport merchants the<br/>
gm replied -<br/>
&quot;that merchants corpses dissapear to discourage players from killing them,<br/>
and to send a email to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:questhelp@...">questhelp@...</a> with details about the broken<br/>
quest&quot; So, i sent my email and pretty much gave up on that one...<br/>
<br/>
Im currently trying to find the freeport guard traitor who works for the<br/>
knights of truth, anyone know who it is? I sure do wish there was some high<br/>
level SK quests like the paladins soulfire quest....im a level 40 human SK<br/>
and have no real rewarding quests i can do....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far these are the quests ive done and what i<br/>
&gt; received for them. All in Qeynos<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kill Drosco: Sometimes a spell, little cash and Trumpy<br/>
&gt; Quest<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trumpy: Kill him, bring in his Head. Little cash and<br/>
&gt; his skull back for next quest.<br/>
&gt; This ticks me off because if youre a goodie you can<br/>
&gt; kill him bring in his head and get the BloodForge<br/>
&gt; Hammer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trumpy&#39;s Skull: Bring it to Grimrot so it can be<br/>
&gt; reanimated. Some cash, nice XP for my level at the<br/>
&gt; time. 2 of us got nothing else, 2 got minor items.<br/>
&gt; Onyx and raw hide cloak.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All that work and we received squat. VERY<br/>
&gt; disappointing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kill Milea Clothspinner: brought back her cloth. got<br/>
&gt; little cash and a rusty mace and a low level cleric<br/>
&gt; spell. no new quest.<br/>
&gt; Again VERY disappointing. Here i was level 10 or<br/>
&gt; under, walking thru East Karana and taking on Milea<br/>
&gt; who was red. (i did have help, but thats not the<br/>
&gt; point) And i get a rusty mace.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kill Paladins and turn in their Amulets or prayer<br/>
&gt; beads. I couldnt get this one to work for the life of<br/>
&gt; me. But others have and they say the payoff was<br/>
&gt; nothing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kill Arlena for Grimrot: this is in Mistmoore. Im only<br/>
&gt; level 25 so thats out of my reach still.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my question:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone done these quests recently or any of the<br/>
&gt; Freeport quests and gotten anything worthwhile.<br/>
&gt; The Trolls now have a couple good ones, and the<br/>
&gt; goodies can kill the same target and get weapons that<br/>
&gt; can sell for 100Pp.<br/>
&gt; What do the Human Sks get now?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have any of these Qeynos quests been upgraded or any<br/>
&gt; added since ive been there? Are the Freeport quests,<br/>
&gt; Steadirt in particualr, working?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
