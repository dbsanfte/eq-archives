<div id="ygrps-yiv-639979745">Some thoughts on this advice.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, no lvl 9 SK can cast their first pet. Being a big dumb troll,<br/>
it looks like you may have to wait until lvl 11 though. You either get more<br/>
mana or things begin to cost less as your skill gets up, though. At the<br/>
beginning of lvl 9 my DE SK couldn&#39;t cast his pet, but after channeling and<br/>
... conjuration? whatever the pet skill is, got maxed near the end of the<br/>
level, then suddenly he could cast it at lvl 9.<br/>
<br/>
As for intelligence vs mana stuff ... your point is valid for the time, but<br/>
once you get a few more levels, well, you&#39;ll first off get a larger mana<br/>
amount per int point of course, plus you&#39;ll find that there are less and<br/>
less pure mana bonuses, at least that aren&#39;t for pure casters. I would<br/>
rather have dexterity bracers than and extra ten mana and HP at lvl 23.<br/>
<br/>
Dexterity is also a good one to get up. As a troll, yours may be hopelessly<br/>
low already, but mine was a 75, now it is around an 85 or 90. My bloodclaw<br/>
procs a TON now, and I love it. In a duel the other day, it proc&#39;d *6*<br/>
times, a total of 300 dmg just from the proc (probably a bit less since 30<br/>
of it is a DoT that probably doesn&#39;t stack on itself). This was against a<br/>
lvl 23 (I was 22 at the time) SK wielding a 2hs weapon and we didn&#39;t use<br/>
spells or PvP tactics (it was just a straight up fight).<br/>
<br/>
back to work,<br/>
