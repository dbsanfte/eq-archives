<div id="ygrps-yiv-231573490">its official, even dark elves who worship innoruuk are KoS in the plane of<br/>
hate ;p WHY IS THIS? its not bad enough that evil folks now have to deal<br/>
with &quot;ha ha, i killed your god&quot; but he actually attacks his own if we go<br/>
there! things are becoming quite frustrating for people who want to play an<br/>
evil character in this game..<br/>
<br/>
when they bring up the plane of air and karana is in it, he&#39;d better damn<br/>
well be KoS to paladins, rangers, and druids who worship him ;p<br/>
