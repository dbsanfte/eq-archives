&gt; Frankly, imo, a SK is the BEST tank in the game hands down, and this is also<br/>
&gt; a best kept secret.  The ability to snare with darkness, FD pull, and tank<br/>
&gt; with the best of them make it a awesome class. Also nice to have<br/>
&gt; invisibility to undead and self invis to move around. Great hybrid.  I would<br/>
&gt; ask you to consider your choice of race again. Another awesome aspect is we<br/>
&gt; are the only class that can choose the ogre race, which gives great stats,<br/>
&gt; and the ability to Slam.  You could still group with your &quot;goodie&quot; friends,<br/>
&gt; how often do you really need to enter a good city?<br/>
