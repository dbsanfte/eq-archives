<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099600301">Cyclops killing is almost a waste of time.  Having killed at least 500+ with <br/>
my wizard and at least over a 100+ with my Shadow Knight, I&#39;ve never seen <br/>
such an item.<br/>
<br/>
And please stay off the topic of pets. lol.  I think we should come up with <br/>
a plan to improve our class.  Seems like the other fighter races get graced <br/>
with far more &quot;weapons / items&quot; then we do.  Kinda sad if you ask me.<br/>

I&#39;ve killed a dozen cyclopses in my day, and never seen an eye.<br/>
Has anyone out there ever found one?<br/>
<br/>
Do I have to start a thread about lifetap or pets to get people<br/>
to talk?<br/>
