<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656722990">As far as being underpowered....i doubt they stay that way.  Its a high<br/>
difficulty class as other have said.  Its a hybrd class...as others have<br/>
said.  But I think, in my honest opinion that it will become one of the<br/>
most powerfull eventually.  But that power comes with a price...it takes<br/>
time and patience...and I think that the only things the SK requires to<br/>
become great is that time and patience, everything else will fall in line.<br/>
Later.  Have faith brothers.....and if I&#39;m worng...so be it...still a very<br/>
fun and challanging class to play and be.<br/>
