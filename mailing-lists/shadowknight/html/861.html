Just wanted to throw my 2 coppers on this thread.<br/>
<br/>
I hang out with mostly all evil races.  Mostly ogre/troll/ DE, with a few<br/>
renegade humans and halflings.And , teleportation is the only way to travel<br/>
my friend. Much better than   that damn boat. Use your gather/shadows and<br/>
invis spells, and Teleport. Hell, around level 17 or so I can remember all<br/>
of us &quot;pitching in&quot; and making deals with the high level druids of n ro<br/>
tunnel, for a teleport to faydark.  The shouting it in unrest, to get us<br/>
back home.<br/>
