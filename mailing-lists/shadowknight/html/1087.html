<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945148374">These spells are very bad mana wise, and can verily heal a necro.(we have<br/>
way more hp and far less mana) I thought general consensus on the list was<br/>
not for a lifetap change. When Brian asked, I thought this was the general<br/>
consensus. I imagine all 25+ SK know these spells will not help the class at<br/>
all. Obviously they have not listened to the players once again, or perhaps<br/>
I missed a message. The spells will be as useless as the ones they took<br/>
away.  I doubt even the teen level SK will be helped by this, I know the 20+<br/>
will not.</div>
