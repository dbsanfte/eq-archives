<br/>
Sorry i couldnt chat with you longer the other week<br/>
when you sent me a tell. I think i was getting smacked<br/>
around by something :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway: heres the Bathory history to date.<br/>
<br/>
Currently level 33. A very looong 33. This is my first<br/>
and only character. I just dont do lots of XP camping.<br/>
I take many breaks from that and try quests and a<br/>
little adventuring. Which always equals little to no<br/>
XP. But is more fun.<br/>
<br/>
I am realatively untwinked. The only things i got that<br/>
i didnt go get is some bronze armor. Which i didnt get<br/>
until early 20s, which is the appropriate level for<br/>
that type of armor anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Weapon history:<br/>
For the first 8 levels or so, i used either a rusty<br/>
battle axe or rusty 2H sword, that i got off of a<br/>
decaying skelton.<br/>
<br/>
Then i bought my mino axe. A mino for 8Pp at that time<br/>
was a deal.<br/>
<br/>
I used this until level 19 with a shiny brass shield.<br/>
During my Befallen days i was switching off using a<br/>
Teticle whip which i got for 15Pp for those magic only<br/>
MOBs. During this time i tried for the BBC. Killed the<br/>
Troll SK, but just wasnt lucky enough to get one.<br/>
But a guildmate was able to aquire one from that<br/>
stingy troll and gave it to me. (I dont consider that<br/>
twinking since i killed him, i just wasnt lucky).<br/>
<br/>
So now at 19 i have a BBC. Minus 8 AGI you say? Thats<br/>
where having a friend who does jeweling come in. Just<br/>
boosted the AGI back up with rings and such and i was<br/>
good to go.<br/>
<br/>
Stayed with the BBC until about level 30. Then i went<br/>
into runny eye to get my BIBS. Realistically i could<br/>
have gone in there at around level 25. But i had a<br/>
heck of a time getting a group i could trust to go in<br/>
there and help me with it.<br/>
<br/>
So thats where i stand now. <br/>
<br/>
At level 20 i was offered a DR as a gift. I turned it<br/>
down becasue that was one of the items i wanted to go<br/>
get myself. But, now that i know you have to be 40ish<br/>
to even have a shot at getting it, and on top of that,<br/>
its only a damage 20 weapon, it doesnt seem worth the<br/>
wait. The DR is good for level 30 to 40 i would say.<br/>
By the time i can go get it, it will be obsolete. So i<br/>
have a feeling i will be a DR twink soon :)<br/>
<br/>
There are other nice swords to consider, but havent<br/>
had a chance to get yet<br/>
<br/>
Fleshripper: Nice weapon. But has a potentially<br/>
dangerous area effect spell to it. So you wont want to<br/>
use it all the time. Now that i have a Box of Aku Bar<br/>
though (pulled it off a specter myself) carry extra<br/>
weapons is no longer an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Mithril 2H. Sweet weapon. But its in Sol B somewhere<br/>
(i Think). No group i can assemble would last in there<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, thats it for my weapons.<br/>
<br/>
I have too much quest stuff to talk about so will just<br/>
do a different post.<br/>
