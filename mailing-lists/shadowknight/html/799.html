<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437470107">Ok a few thoughts I came up with over the weekend. I remember that Brian<br/>
mentioned that we had to do something that would increase the power of the<br/>
smaller races while not doing anything (or not much) to the larger races.<br/>
What about Kick?? It would give the smaller races a nice extra attack<br/>
(nothing too much), yet the larger already have an extra so it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
anything new to them. I know it&#39;s not a lot of damage but anything is nice,<br/>
and when you consider that the majority of SK&#39;s use 2hs it makes sense<br/>
(Since we really can&#39;t use Bash - Especially in group situations where you<br/>
have to kill the Mob quickly).<br/>
<br/>
Also do NOT give us a lifetap. They are slow and useless, if you have ever<br/>
seen a necro cast one you know what I&#39;m talking about. Considering how far<br/>
down the Necro spell list we are the ones we would be given would be<br/>
completely useless to us. I would much rather see spells like Poison,<br/>
Infectious Cloud, Addtl Shields and Cure Disease.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just some thoughts..<br/>
