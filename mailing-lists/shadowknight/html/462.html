<div id="ygrps-yiv-969080080">actually.. human sk is NOT easy. in fact, it is probably THE single hardest<br/>
class/race combo in the game.. and if you are a worshipper of toxxy.. talk<br/>
about hard times :) at least the qeynos SK guild kicks ass..<br/>
<br/>
the reason for this is that our stats are mediocre, and despite whatever<br/>
info is out there our faction is NOT significantly better anywhere than the<br/>
other SK races. human SK can still only get into 3 towns (freeport, qeynos,<br/>
and neriak), which is par for SK of any race. really our main advantages is<br/>
that we are physically a bit stronger than dark elves, are more agile and<br/>
intelligent than ogres and trolls, and we have one of the highest charisma<br/>
ratings in the game (buying things cheap is a definite plus).  with all my<br/>
jeweller buddy&#39;s special equipment, i can get cha over 100 ;) if you want to<br/>
make a first-time sk, be a troll. your xp gains will really suck (penalty<br/>
for combo class AND penalty for large race) but the hp regen REALLY helps<br/>
you, as well as your mighty trollish strength. plus trolls have some of the<br/>
best SK quests that WORK at the moment.  so basically, be a troll unless you<br/>
seek even greater challenge :) just my 2 pesos<br/>
