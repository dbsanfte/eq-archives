&gt; maybe you should have tried a different SK...maybe a troll for pure<br/>
&gt; power...or a Dark Elf for the casting abilities.  I also don&#39;t doubt that<br/>
&gt; eventually SK&#39;s will be powered up a little.  You played a human...a<br/>
&gt; little stronger but limited magically.  Maybe if you tried a different<br/>
&gt; race you might have found more satisfaction.  I can&#39;t express how much I<br/>
&gt; love being a DE SK.  Not only for the evil nature I get to play...but also<br/>
&gt; the fact that when I get spells...i will get alot...not to mention that<br/>
&gt; your training and weapon skills have alot to do with how well your<br/>
&gt; character does.  Just because the SK isn&#39;t the most powerfull<br/>
&gt; class...doesn&#39;t mean its a bad class.  You played one race up to<br/>
&gt; 10....thats hardly anywhere in the world.<br/>
