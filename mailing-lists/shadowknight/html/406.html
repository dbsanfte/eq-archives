<div id="ygrps-yiv-577685231">Yes, you do need an unobstructed path to the target. Generally I strafe to<br/>
the left or right when shooting a runner. As for hitting something that is<br/>
inbetween, I have not encountered this and don&#39;t know if it counts as a real<br/>
attack.<br/>

&gt; This one time i was practicing my archery and i was chasing this wolf,<br/>
&gt; now a guard walked into the arrows path, and it said i attack Guard<br/>
&gt; Jascen. And he proceeded to smack the heck out of me until i finally<br/>
&gt; zoned.<br/>
&gt; Now i checked my target and it still said the wolf.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have also noticed that when i cast fear on a creature and my pet is<br/>
&gt; chasing it, when i fire an arrow, i dont get the hit/miss message. Its<br/>
&gt; as if it was never reaching the target.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now heres my question,<br/>
&gt; Do you need an unobstucted path for the arrow to hit?<br/>
&gt; And if an NPC does get in the way, does it count as an attack, even<br/>
&gt; though they arent targeted?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Im not complaining mind you. It actually makes sense. But i would like<br/>
&gt; to know if this is the way it works so i can plan a strategy<br/>
&gt; accordingly. Or was this just some weird fluke that could only happen<br/>
&gt; to me?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
