<div id="ygrps-yiv-264094946">A friend and i &quot;finished&quot; this quest a while ago. And<br/>
the result we got was Peitro telling us to get lost.<br/>
Now as far we know we did everything.<br/>
Got all 3 parts, decoded them, gave to Peitro.<br/>
<br/>
But this was a while ago before all the patches that<br/>
&quot;enhanced&quot; quests.<br/>
<br/>
Before i waste my time camping Dyllin again (i already<br/>
have the other 2 parts...again..for the 3rd time)<br/>
What was your result. <br/>
And how did you get the list from Dyllin? He wouldnt<br/>
talk to us so we had to kill him despite the negative<br/>
faction we got with Kane and CorruptGuards. I am<br/>
convinced that there is a way to get it from him<br/>
without killing him, but i think its linked with the<br/>
&quot;Opal&quot; in Freeport we need to contact. And i cant get<br/>
her to talk either. <br/>
NOTE: i dont believe its the Opal in the Necro guild.<br/>
Im pretty sure its the Opal in the Arcane building.<br/>
<br/>
BTW.. i also did the Bayle List quest for Commander<br/>
Kane in Qeynos. He does not require it to be decoded.<br/>
I gave him all 3 parts, got congratulated, now he can<br/>
kill these folks and may Disease run thru my veins or<br/>
something. He gave me 20Sp and sent me on my way.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried this recently to see if the end<br/>
results have been &quot;enhanced&quot;?<br/>

&gt; Well ... I don&#39;t think finished. I&#39;m sure there is<br/>
&gt; more to it, but I<br/>
&gt; retrieve it, decoded it, and returned it to Pietro.<br/>
&gt; Wondering how others<br/>
&gt; were doing with this as this list has been quiet.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m so happy to have<br/>
&gt; finally finished this part of it ... my notes are<br/>
&gt; scribbled all over the<br/>
&gt; place on stuff and what people said and all that<br/>
&gt; rigamaroll.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So ... has anyone else been working on it? Made any<br/>
&gt; other headway? etc.<br/>
