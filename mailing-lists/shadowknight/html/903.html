<div id="ygrps-yiv-852622207">My first character was a wizard, which I enjoyed playing (and still do from <br/>
time to time), but I enjoy my SK even more.  Granted I can&#39;t solo if I <br/>
wanted to (I&#39;m a DE), or if I did, I&#39;d have massive downtime.  I think it&#39;s <br/>
the variation that is appealing.  The main reason I don&#39;t like playing the <br/>
wizard much anymore is because I feel like I stand for 1 min, cast, cast, <br/>
cast, then sit for 5+ minutes medding.  At least I can play with my spell <br/>
book now.<br/>
<br/>
With the SK, I&#39;m the puller generally, so I get to run around and just do <br/>
more.  So I guess that&#39;s what I find more appealing.<br/>

I am starting to have that itch again.  I think I am not<br/>
enjoying my Troll anymore.  Since I started playing my<br/>
Druid, I dread getting on as my troll. But I can&#39;t put<br/>
my finger on why. I haven&#39;t played Cronik in a week or<br/>
so.<br/>
I have /played my Druid for &lt;14 hours and am 2 bubs into<br/>
6th level.  I guess I have learned how to level rather<br/>
quickly with my class of choice.  This may be slow to<br/>
some, but for me it is astronomically fast.<br/>
I am in the middle of a mental debate on whether or not<br/>
to scrap him, sell everything, run to my druid, die and<br/>
leave him a big inheritance.<br/>
Anyone else run into this problem of character ping-pong?<br/>
Things at home are also very stressed, so that isn&#39;t<br/>
helping either.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
