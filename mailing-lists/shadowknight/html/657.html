<div id="ygrps-yiv-879452106"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;DR is 2H slashing<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyone on this list use a weapon other than a 2HS?  How<br/>
&gt; does it compare to damage done by MOBS at higher level?<br/>
&gt; Is it good as a solo adventurer?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used a fs 2H sword from level 1 - 20, then I used demon claw and chitin<br/>
shield from 20 - 28, used Reaver from 29 - 34, and use Fleshripper from 35+.<br/>
I plan on getting a Mithril 2H (21 40, haste) in the future (45ish) and I&#39;m<br/>
36 now. I used a friend&#39;s zweihander off and on during my 20s, and I<br/>
*always* did better using the claw/shield combo (mostly solo&#39;ing). The 1HS<br/>
was good then and only then, during the period before you get to the really<br/>
high-powered 2HS weapons. Also, it may not hold for all 1HS, it may have<br/>
been that the claw/chitin-shield just worked wonders together, I dunno. I<br/>
have no plans of ever again using 1HS.<br/>

PS: Bathory! I hear you know a monk named Kinowek Wheeljackson, I&#39;ve known<br/>
him for a long time. He and I played Quake:TF together, tell him I said<br/>
hello. :)</div>
