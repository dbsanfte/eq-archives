<div id="ygrps-yiv-995508118">I have seen Dark Elves in Qeynos so it is possible.<br/>
That is accomplished by killing lots and lots of<br/>
gnolls in Black Burrow.<br/>
Some of the people on the dock are kind of touchy<br/>
though. After doing several quests in Qeynos i became<br/>
KOS on the docks (Trumpy and his buddies hang out<br/>
there). I had to wait for the boat to show and pay<br/>
someone to invis me so i could make it to the boat.<br/>

The big problem for you is when you get to Erudin.<br/>
They didnt like me, but they didnt kill me either. You<br/>
may not be so lucky. You may want to consult other<br/>
Dark Elves on their faction in Erudin.<br/>
There may be other islands that have Kerrans on them<br/>
too, not just Odus.<br/>

And the Kerrans are a pain. They con green but beat<br/>
the heck out of you.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a DE Shadowknight and I&#39;ve been considering<br/>
&gt; trying out the kerra<br/>
&gt; island fire beetle quest.  Have any other DE SKs<br/>
&gt; tried this?  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; interested in how you were able to get out to Kerra<br/>
&gt; island.  I have a<br/>
&gt; feeling that I&#39;ll be KOS in Quenos.  Is there a way<br/>
&gt; to get to Kerra<br/>
&gt; island without going through Quenos?  Is there some<br/>
&gt; sort of way through<br/>
&gt; Quenos similar to the sewers in freeport that is<br/>
&gt; safe for DEs?  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; love to hear from anyone who&#39;s done this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
