<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533935682">I&#39;d just like to introduce myself real quick first, as I just joined this<br/>
list yesterday. My name is Jeremy and I play Virten, a 12th level Human<br/>
Shadowknight on the Solusek Ro server who worships Innoruuk. Just thought<br/>
I&#39;d add my thoughts to this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have to say that I agree with what Brian stated about there being a &quot;too<br/>
bad&quot; philosophy for playing evil or more difficult characters. Unlike Brian,<br/>
I knew what I was getting into when I chose a Human Shadowknight. It was<br/>
mainly for RP&#39;ing purposes. And since we were warned about this race/clsss<br/>
difficulty, there is little to complain about there. I never expected to be<br/>
a &quot;super character,&quot; just hoped to be able to fight and be on the same level<br/>
as others. So far, I&#39;ve been pretty happy with my character. Although I have<br/>
been going through some of the level 10-12 duldrums that others have<br/>
described. Level 9 was great, new spells to play with, etc., but level 11<br/>
and 12 have been really slow.<br/>
<br/>
Party-wise, I have had some of the same problems grouping with &quot;pure<br/>
magic-users&quot; as described previously, but my normal party I have no problems<br/>
with. This is a friend of mine from work and a group of his friends that<br/>
were already a group and took me in as a 7th (actually, 6th, since one<br/>
person rarely plays and is far behind) player. It consists of an DE<br/>
Enchanter, a DE Rogue, 2 DE Shadow Knights (one with shield, one with<br/>
2-hander) and a Troll Shaman. With the addition of a third Shadow Knight, we<br/>
are quite a force. We could probably have switched one of the SK&#39;s to a more<br/>
pure magician (i.e. Wizard) but the person that dropped out was a Wizard and<br/>
as I joined late, this was unforseen. Even so, we have little trouble with<br/>
anything that is not at least four or five levels above us. The enchanter&#39;s<br/>
pet is quite a tank, there are three skeletons on big guys, dishing out some<br/>
extra damage. The enchanter can cast &quot;whirl &#39;till you hurl,&quot; the Shaman has<br/>
a new spell, something strike I think, which hits for about 75 damage, and<br/>
the rogue can backstab for 42 points a round, while the three shadow knights<br/>
hit for 17 per round, drain strength, and can keep the beasties off the<br/>
others with taunt and dis cloud. Add to this the shaman&#39;s healing ability<br/>
and Spirit of the Wolf (and ability to tank, being a troll, if he has to)<br/>
and we&#39;re a formidable party.<br/>
<br/>
Also a quick note on leveling: I have actually not had any sort of problem<br/>
with the speed of gaining levels with my Human Shadow Knight. When I first<br/>
joined this group, I was 5 levels behind. Since then, with a little bit of<br/>
time on my own but not a great deal, I have caught up to the Shadow Knights<br/>
at level 12, while the rogue is now at level 15 (enchanter at 14 and Troll<br/>
Shaman at 14). Having a healer in the group helps get experience quickly,<br/>
too<br/>
<br/>
Enough of my novel. Well, one more thing. For RP&#39;ing, I have found my<br/>
character to be excellent. I live in Neriak and constantly find myself<br/>
defending my religion and beliefs against those dark elves who don&#39;t think<br/>
anyone should be in Neriak except Dark Elves. Through perserverance,<br/>
however, I have carved my niche there, and now, I actually have some Dark<br/>
Elves come to my aid whenever I am accosted by a DE who has yet to meet me.<br/>
Much more fun than living in Freeport where everyone is the same and I find<br/>
very few RP&#39;ers.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; There is a large philosophical discussion here as to whether certain<br/>
&gt; classes/races should, in fact, be &quot;easier&quot; or &quot;harder&quot; than others by<br/>
&gt; virtue of their abilities, by virtue of their faction, or if it<br/>
&gt; should &quot;all<br/>
&gt; balance out&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example, some classes will be very &quot;easy&quot; to play -- good<br/>
&gt; human cleric,<br/>
&gt; for example -- since they generally aren&#39;t KOS anywhere (except by evil<br/>
&gt; NPCs, which are much less frequently encountered than good NPCs), level<br/>
&gt; quickly, and stay alive for a while.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, there are the very difficult classes/races,<br/>
&gt; e.g. a troll<br/>
&gt; SK, that levels very slowly, is fairly weak at early levels, has a very<br/>
&gt; difficult time travelling due to KOS issues, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, do you &quot;bump up&quot; the latter so that they can compete in the game given<br/>
&gt; their faction disparity, or do you just say &quot;too bad, they&#39;re inherently<br/>
&gt; more difficult&quot;.  I tend towards the &quot;too bad&quot; philosophy -- playing evil<br/>
&gt; SHOULD be more difficult, however it shouldn&#39;t be so difficult that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; absurdly so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think there is a wrong or right answer to this.  I think some<br/>
&gt; attempt should be made to balance all classes WITHOUT taking into account<br/>
&gt; faction, frequency of guild headquarters, etc.  After the classes are<br/>
&gt; balanced in a vacuum, then I think difficulty should be factored in by<br/>
&gt; virtue of guild availability and faction.  All else being equal, warriors<br/>
&gt; have the advantage of being a non-evil class and also having guild<br/>
&gt; headquarters in nearly every city.  By the same token, evil shamans<br/>
&gt; probably have a huge disadvantage due to poor faction and rarity of<br/>
&gt; training locations/spell locations. Anything that promotes travel is<br/>
&gt; inherently dangerous, unless you have invis and/or SotW.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once again, I would like to reiterate that while my SK frustrated me, I<br/>
&gt; think it was for two main reasons, both largely my fault: I was playing as<br/>
&gt; a &quot;tank&quot; in a party with two other magic users; I was not role-playing<br/>
&gt; &quot;evil&quot;.  As a tank, I would have been better off with more warrior skills<br/>
&gt; (like dodge at a lower level, kick, parry, and dual wield) since my necro<br/>
&gt; jr. skills weren&#39;t nearly as relevant as our party&#39;s necro spells.  Thus I<br/>
&gt; should have been more &quot;task oriented&quot; (and in retrospect a<br/>
&gt; barbarian shaman<br/>
&gt; would have been better for that party).  Also, since I wasn&#39;t role-playing<br/>
&gt; evil, I was suffering a significant difficulty disadvantage<br/>
&gt; unwittingly and<br/>
&gt; unnecessarily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; SKs can make sense, especially for solo characters.  I still think they<br/>
&gt; could be slightly improved so that SKs don&#39;t go through the 9th level<br/>
&gt; &quot;blahs&quot; and are more genuinely useful.<br/>
