<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032745304"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hello fellow Dark Elfs, I&#39;m new to the Shadowknight onelist.  Glad to be<br/>
&gt; aboard.  I noticed Chris Rosset said something about the Electrum Bladed<br/>
&gt; Qakizashi Quest.  I&#39;ve never heard of this quest nor this sword.  Could<br/>
&gt; someone give a brief description of where i can get the quest... i would<br/>
&gt; like to try it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You read my mind. I was gonna ask that myself. I know the sword is 1HS,<br/>
7/21, and weighs 2.<br/>
<br/>
However, I too would like to know the quest and requirements behind it. It&#39;d<br/>
give something to do besides powerleveling (I&#39;m 23 now btw, Beld ;).<br/>
