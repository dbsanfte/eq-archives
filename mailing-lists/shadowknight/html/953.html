&gt; it worked like a charm :) i am now indifferent to the inhabitants of<br/>
&gt; mistmoore castle (warmly if affected by wolf form.. yay!) and can freely<br/>
&gt; explore the place :) that said, does anybody know where the maid and butler<br/>
&gt; can be found inside? not that i will kill them personally.. i&#39;ll just know<br/>
&gt; where to lead my friends to so they can camp the teeth for me ;) hehe...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; sadly xicotl or lord mistmoore didnt pop up while i was there, but if i<br/>
&gt; happen to get screenshots at a later date i&#39;ll be sure to let you folks know.<br/>

other players as well.<br/>
<br/>
Which princess do you kill?  The upstairs or downstairs one (Lenia<br/>
or Lenya)?  One is a DE right?  What level is she?<br/>
<br/>
How many times did you kill her?<br/>
