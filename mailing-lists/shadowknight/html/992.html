<div id="ygrps-yiv-229833319">Noticed this yesterday when I was playing my Wiz.. Wizards get a 4th lvl<br/>
Spell Glimpse, no biggie right. Well Rangers get it as well, but I didn&#39;t<br/>
see Druids on the list.. I found this odd because as far as I know Sk&#39;s only<br/>
get Necro spells and Pals only get Cleric spells.. Anybody else find this<br/>
rather strange (the spell itself sucks, I was just curious).<br/>
