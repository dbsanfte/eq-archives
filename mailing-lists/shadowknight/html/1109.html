<div id="ygrps-yiv-228616355">yup, thats how it worked. ternada had to atone the UK after the necros were<br/>
dead. for some reason, it never attacked me when i went to the room solo at<br/>
first (bad idea), just when we came back with a few friends to clear the<br/>
remaining necro.<br/>
<br/>
so for clearing the room, bring only: shadow knights, necromancers, monks,<br/>
clerics, or enchanters; anybody else will be unable to de-agro the knight :(<br/>
