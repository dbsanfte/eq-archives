<div id="ygrps-yiv-383392383">i&#39;ve yet to see any direct benefits of worshipping innoruuk. but it may help <br/>
a human sk out with the de. by the way, worshippers of innoruuk are 100% kos <br/>
in the plane of hate. yay!<br/>
<br/>
as for starting stats, i have yet to see a convincing demonstration of the <br/>
benefits of agi. with a lv50 shaman buff the difference is negligable as far <br/>
as i can tell. however, the effects of strength are immediately noticable as <br/>
it increases your atk, which increases your chance of hitting for &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
damage (dmg*2+1), increases your max damage at a rate of about 1 point per <br/>
10 atk and increases your minimum damage. it&#39;s also believed by many that <br/>
atk determines your hit % as well...i haven&#39;t observed this to be true, as <br/>
my hit rate has been a rock solid 66% for the last 6 levels that i&#39;ve been <br/>
keeping logs.<br/>
<br/>
my sk always has and will likely continue to focus on:<br/>
<br/>
ac - never have enough. less important in a group situation.<br/>
str - more damage. more important in a group situation.<br/>
int - more mana. more taps. more feigns. less important in a group.<br/>
sv magic - resist assorted dd and most &quot;effect&quot; magic.<br/>
sv fire - trolls have a base resist of 5. many, many npcs have fire attacks.<br/>
agi - more dodge, parry, riposte. no noticable difference &lt;+20<br/>
dex - more procs. reaver already procs enough to &quot;always on&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
in that order. dex would possibly overtake agi if procs become more <br/>
neccessary.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Subject: [shadowknight] Human SK god and stats?<br/>
&gt;Date: Tue,  2 Nov 1999 14:30:28 PDT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve have 2 TSK characters, but have tired of both because of the crushing <br/>
&gt;EXP penalty, so I though I&#39;d try out a human SK.  A few questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1)  What is the best god for HSK?  Innoruuk or Bertox?  Which cities can <br/>
&gt;each enter safely without having to kill anything?  I&#39;m assuming the human <br/>
&gt;cities plus High Hold for both, plus Neriak for Innoruuk SK&#39;s.  Can either <br/>
&gt;safely enter a city on either Faydwer or Erudin?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2)  Starting stats.  I was thinking +5 Str and + 15 AGI to set each to 90.  <br/>
&gt;Any thoughts on what a good Str value is.  Should I bump it to 100.  How <br/>
&gt;heavy is medium armor?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for any input.<br/>
