<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that really such a bad thing? It takes us SO long to get up there in<br/>
levels that we should be rewarded with these awesome abilities, not punished<br/>
by paltry spells!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>race<br/>

 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; IS unbalanced if you put it on a troll or ogre SK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So what can be changed that makes the class more viable for non-big-races<br/>
&gt; but at the same time is not unbalancing for trolls/ogres?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Items. Items would be really the only thing you could reasonably restrict to<br/>
JUST small and medium sizes. If you add or change spells, the trolls/ogres<br/>
would go out and get Int jewelry, etc. There are already SK items that<br/>
exclude some races (i.e. humans) so just throw in some more but leave off<br/>
the ogres and trolls. Those greaves someone mentioned sounded cool -- grants<br/>
banshee aura to only smalls and mediums, LOL!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know HT comes up a lot, but there is a fear that HT could end up being<br/>
&gt; heavily abused (worst nightmare....party of 6 50th level SKs stand around<br/>
&gt; Mr. Named Mob that only pops once a day anyway, BAM 3000HP gone instantly<br/>
&gt; and you now have a mob that starts the fight at 1/2 HP).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If HT was upped slightly, had a slightly higher recharge rate, etc...what<br/>
&gt; are your suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah yes, good ole&#39; HT. When compared to a paladin&#39;s LOH ability, HT simply<br/>
stinks. Let&#39;s take level 30, for example. If you are a paladin or SK at<br/>
level 30, you have about 700 or so hit points (being conservative). So, the<br/>
paladin is in a bad fight, he&#39;s down to 20 hp, and he hits LOH -- boom, he<br/>
just did a 700hp heal. Same situation, this time it&#39;s an SK. The SK is in a<br/>
bad fight, he&#39;s down to 20 hp, and he hits HT -- boom, he does 301hp of<br/>
damage and kills the mob (ideal scenario). Both get their specials once a<br/>
game day. So what&#39;s wrong with this picture? The paladin did 700, the SK did<br/>
300, THAT is the problem. If the paladin were to LOH a warrior friend,<br/>
there&#39;s 1000 hp heal. If the SK were to HT a different mob, he still does<br/>
300 at best.<br/>
<br/>
So there are three possible solutions to this:<br/>
<br/>
(1.) Make the HT do damage AND lifetap for that amount of damage. So in that<br/>
same situation, the SK does 300 in damage, and receives 300 as a heal. That<br/>
totals 600hp, STILL less than an LOH, and it gives us a real lifesuck. I<br/>
believe this is in the current eqss SK petition Beld mentioned (and I&#39;ve<br/>
signed).<br/>
<br/>
(2.) Allow the HT to be the EXACT reverse of the LOH, i.e. complete death.<br/>
Why is the paladin&#39;s special able to adjust to the target, but the SK&#39;s is<br/>
not? Let HT completely kill the mob. Admittedly, this is the least plausible<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
(3.) Since the HT does approximately half what an LOH does (that disparity<br/>
only increases with levels, by the way), let it have half the recharge time.<br/>
That way a level 30 SK gets a pair of 300hp HTs per day, and the paladin<br/>
still just gets one 700hp LOH.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I prefer option 1, with option 3 running a close 2nd... but<br/>
there&#39;s my brainstorm.<br/>
<br/>
Also, someone mentioned an SK equivalent to ghoulbane. Well, we have that,<br/>
the dark reaver. What we need is an equivalent to SOULFIRE, and better yet,<br/>
I believe that we DO! Yup, you heard right, it&#39;s out there... somewhere.<br/>
From what I&#39;ve been able to gather, it&#39;s called Soul Devourer. I don&#39;t know<br/>
any kind of stats on it at all and don&#39;t really know anything about the<br/>
quest(s) for it, only that it IS quest-obtainable. There is an SK on the<br/>
cazic-thule server that I was talking to in irc one night and I kinda fished<br/>
this info out of him. The GMs on his server said he was the farthest along<br/>
on it (than anyone on ANY server). So that should tell you something, ala<br/>
this is a HARD quest. The best part is, this guy is over halfway through the<br/>
quest and only level 34, meaning you may or may not have to be level 50 to<br/>
do it. If anyone knows anymore about this (and yes, I&#39;m talking to you too<br/>
Brian Hook!), please feel free to share. ;)<br/>
