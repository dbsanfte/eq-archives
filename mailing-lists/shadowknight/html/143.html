<div id="ygrps-yiv-545119791">I would have to say it is good that you are giving up. There is no point playing<br/>
a class if you are not enjoying it. I also question your search for the best<br/>
class. It is pointless and you will never find it. Try to enjoy what you can do<br/>
rather then wish for something that they guy next to you can do and you willl<br/>
enjoy EQ far more.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve finally hung up the spurs on my 10th level human SK.  I&#39;ve just<br/>
&gt; reached the conclusion the SK is way underpowered vs. just about any other<br/>
&gt; class out there, specifically in party situations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ignoring the HT issue completely, the SK is basically (to paraphrase a<br/>
&gt; comment I saw elsewhere) &quot;a weak warrior with necromancer parlor tricks&quot;.<br/>
&gt; The fundamental issue, to me, is that by the time the SK gets spells, those<br/>
&gt; spells are underpowered and useless for the types of foes we&#39;re fighting at<br/>
&gt; that level.  The same things for the pet.  It bothers me that I&#39;m expected<br/>
&gt; to tank for my pet.  What&#39;s even worse is that I fight in a party all the<br/>
&gt; time, and the SK is probably one of the most useless party characters there<br/>
&gt; are -- I party with a 12th level necro and a 12th level wizard, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; pretty much a nuisance in most combats.  The necro&#39;s pet is just a complete<br/>
&gt; bad ass -- does more damage than me, attacks better, and, best of all, is<br/>
&gt; expendable.  The pet doesn&#39;t get diseased and is basically free.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We took out the giant plague rat at Blackburrow, and it was immensely<br/>
&gt; demoralizing.  Because of its destructive capabilities, I couldn&#39;t get near<br/>
&gt; it (since we didn&#39;t have a cleric to cure disease).  So the necro&#39;s pet<br/>
&gt; tanked, and the necro and wizard cast spells and toasted it quickly and<br/>
&gt; cleanly.  I did _nothing_ during that battle.  If I had meleed, I would<br/>
&gt; have died (or been diseased -- it was doing 32 points per hit too), my pet<br/>
&gt; was killed in _two hits_, and my spells were a joke compared to the<br/>
&gt; wizard/necro spells.  So I basically cowered in a corner while the other<br/>
&gt; party members did the real damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I&#39;m going to switch to a monk or a warrior, i.e. a &quot;pure&quot; warrior class,<br/>
&gt; and not suffer through the limitations of the SK.  The only thing I&#39;ll give<br/>
&gt; up that I&#39;ll miss is the HT, and gaining dual wield, kick, bash, mend, and<br/>
&gt; more hp seems to be a very good trade off for a weak pet and limited spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I recognize that while no particular character class is going to be &quot;the<br/>
&gt; best&quot;, I think that hybrid classes should gain the strengths of multiple<br/>
&gt; classes and possibly pick up a few weaknesses/limitations along the way.<br/>
&gt; What I&#39;ve finally realized with the SK is that it picks up some strengths<br/>
&gt; of the warrior, but the necro skills that it acquires are basically useless<br/>
&gt; and don&#39;t outweigh the loss of kick, dual wield, earlier dodge, etc.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not nearly as good a tank as a warrior or monk, and I&#39;m laughable as a<br/>
&gt; spell caster compared to any other pure spell caster.  As a combination of<br/>
&gt; the two, I&#39;ve lost a lot of benefits of being a pure class, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seem to have picked up anything in exchange (but HT, which is underpowered).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t believe these same arguments apply to paladins/rangers, since their<br/>
&gt; spells are actually useful.<br/>
