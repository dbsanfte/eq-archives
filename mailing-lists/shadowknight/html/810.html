<br/>
Why didn&#39;t Verant think Trolls or Ogres could be Rogues?<br/>
Granted amongst the other races that would be obvious, <br/>
but in their home cities any race is capable (and does) <br/>
have it&#39;s Rogue sect. Heh, I would like to see the <br/>
damage on a backstab from a 25th level Troll or Ogre <br/>
decked out in strength boosting items and buffs.<br/>
And if this is a class over balancing issue, then the <br/>
purely racial XP penalties would make up for it. <br/>
Especially since most of the Rogue abilities are hosed <br/>
anyway and poison didn&#39;t actually get implimented til <br/>
just recently.<br/>
Any word on this from your fellows at Verant?<br/>
<br/>
What happened to the Troll Shaman vendors in the Foriegn <br/>
Quarter? This is not a big deal to me, but it is to <br/>
several friends of mine.<br/>
Also, why can&#39;t I train at the Troll SK in Foriegn <br/>
Quarter? Are all the Troll SKs walking around just for <br/>
looks?  Is it because the DE SKs would rather train <br/>
there instead of going in another 2 zones to train?  But <br/>
then again the race thing wouldn&#39;t let them anyway... :P<br/>
<br/>
Anyone,<br/>
Each city that I have been in has had a secret passage <br/>
somewhere. The exception to this seems to be Grobb <br/>
(haven&#39;t been into Oggok except to be bound just inside) <br/>
but I may be wrong. Anyone know of a secret passage in <br/>
Grobb?<br/>
Also, has anyone been  to the &quot;fire pot&quot; in 3rd Gate <br/>
near the stone bridge that is on the other side of the <br/>
fletcher shop? <br/>
When I click on it it says I do not have the key.  I <br/>
tried the first and second keys from Befallen, but those <br/>
didn&#39;t work. Ideas?  I have yet to see a Rogue in Neriak <br/>
to help me. Heh.<br/>
