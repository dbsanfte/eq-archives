<b>Subject:</b> Najena <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181071380">Something just occured to me about Najena.  One of the NPCs that makes the<br/>
SK only armor is in Najena, right?  While this may not be a big deal now,<br/>
and I may already have messed this faction to Thule and back anyway, it<br/>
makes me edgy. I have only been in there a few times, and killed 1 Ogre that<br/>
wandered near the Magician and her 2 Earth Elemental pets.  I noticed a<br/>
Najena Residents -Faction adjusment. After that, My group attacked the<br/>
Magician, and I became a stain on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
I am curious to know for those of you who battle there often, what faction<br/>
adjustments you may have seen since they implemented Darkforge Armor. It<br/>
will suck to destroy my faction with the only NPC that makes those pieces of<br/>
the armor that only I can wear.  Granted, what you destroyed, you can fix<br/>
(hopefully), but that in and of itself can take a lifetime. Or is there no<br/>
faction adjustment with this NPC?<br/>
<br/>
Also, what is the name of this NPC in Najena, and where does he spawn?<br/>
<br/>
I ask these questions as my guild is planning to raid Najena and get some<br/>
nifty stuff. Am I about to become screwed when all is said and done?<br/>
Any and all information on this is helpful and wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
