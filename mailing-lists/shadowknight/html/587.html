<div id="ygrps-yiv-205354638">Tentacle whip can usually be had for about 15 plat. It is the best starter<br/>
weapon. Use it to spank wisps in West Commons, to earn cash fer a better<br/>
weapon.<br/>

Hey, I was glad to finally get another message from the list!!  Sorry, I<br/>
haven&#39;t been on lately, but bought a new house and moving everything over,<br/>
haven&#39;t had the computer hooked up for about a week and a half, so .....  I<br/>
have a question for all the SKs out there, I have just reached 14th lvl<br/>
(woo-hoo!!), and things seem to be going okay.  My one major deficiency<br/>
right now seems to be that I do not have a magic weapon.  I keep both 1HS<br/>
and 2HS maxxed out, and have virtually no skill in the others (all below<br/>
10).  Hunting in Lavastorm is very difficult without a magic weapon, and I<br/>
am starting to run into more and more INVULNERABLE!s elsewhere as well.<br/>
(Ghouls, etc.....)  What is a good 1H or 2H slashing weapon that is that is<br/>
both magic and inexpensive?  How much play should I plan on spending?  I can<br/>
make some cash, but never seem to have the 200-300 plat for the auctioned<br/>
weapons I would *like* to have..... &lt;grin&gt;.  Any recommendations out there?<br/>
Any higher level SKs with an old magic 1HS or 2HS that they would be willing<br/>
to part with for a reasonable sum on the Povar server?  Any help my fellow<br/>
SKs could lend would be very much appreciated!!  Tvar 14th DE SK, Povar<br/>
