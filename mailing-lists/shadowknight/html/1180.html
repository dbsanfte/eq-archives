<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-581304040">When i first entered Najena..i was DUBIOUS to all<br/>
(except maybe the skels..i dont remember). But that<br/>
didnt last obviously.<br/>
But i have never seen a way to raise it either.<br/>
The only possibility is to try the quest for the<br/>
Visiting Priestess who hangs out in the Ogre Captain&#39;s<br/>
room.<br/>
Warning though, if she sees you attacking anything,<br/>
she will attack. Killing her lowers faction with the<br/>
Clerics of Innoruuk and some others in Neriak you<br/>
probably dodnt want to tick off.<br/>
She is still DUBIOUS to me even after all the Najena<br/>
killing. So she might not be linked. But since she<br/>
asks if you are Najena&#39;s Champion, could be that it<br/>
will help.<br/>
However this quest is very demanding. She needs the<br/>
various types of crystal staffs scattered around<br/>
Norrath. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the Bards go..i havent heard of anyone<br/>
significantly raising MM faction with them.<br/>
The only successful kill was Princess Lenya. And she<br/>
was moved, though we have an idea where she is now,<br/>
just havent gotten around to doing a full blown<br/>
search.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to give it a try, go into HH and ask<br/>
Mistress Anna about Princess Lenya. She asks who sent<br/>
you. If you tell her &quot;someone else&quot; she sends you to a<br/>
DE NPC in the same area where Lenya used to be..<br/>
We couldnt get her to talk (DUBIOUS) so we ended up<br/>
killing her.<br/>
She had a container with a COMBINE button and a note<br/>
written in Dark Speech with instructions and the VERY<br/>
basic whereabouts and fate of Princess Lenya.<br/>
<br/>
The container and note appear to be part of another<br/>
quest somewhere but have yet to find its origins. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; as a side note, i&#39;ve never killed a mistmoore npc<br/>
&gt; but i have killed easily <br/>
&gt; 100+ bards for +MayongMistmoore hits. i am still<br/>
&gt; 100% kos, scowls at you <br/>
&gt; ready to attack in MistMoore. the faction there is<br/>
&gt; broken imo. also, when i <br/>
&gt; went to turn the parts in mistmoore: first, a<br/>
&gt; shadowy scribe cast force <br/>
&gt; shocked me to death through a wall as i was leaving.<br/>
&gt; second, after i <br/>
&gt; collected my body i made my way all the way to the<br/>
&gt; castle gates...the guards <br/>
&gt; were positioned in such a way that my troll<br/>
&gt; absolutely could not fit past <br/>
&gt; them. though i did manage to get stuck in a crouch<br/>
&gt; position between <br/>
&gt; them...then watched as my invis died. needless to<br/>
&gt; say, i died shortly after.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; so, if you go to mistmoree bring a rescue group and<br/>
&gt; bind in gfay (i was <br/>
&gt; bound in grobb) as the zone is bugged to hell and<br/>
&gt; back.<br/>
