<div id="ygrps-yiv-67062146">I did not declare that anything was a bug exploit, I merely pointed out that<br/>
these daggers are a pathetically easy way of raising your Archery skill. Due<br/>
to Verant&#39;s EXCELLENT history of balancing this game, I find it extremely<br/>
difficult to believe that they would put a component in the world that would<br/>
allow you to raise your archery skill 5 points in 5 minutes when normally<br/>
archery takes an extraordinary amount of time to raise unless you use it<br/>
constantly. Yes, I did raise my own archery skill 5 points in 5 minutes (it<br/>
was already at 72) while testing it to see if it worked. The ability to<br/>
raise any skill, especially a combat one, that much in such a short amount<br/>
of time must be considered a bug or something that Verant does not realize.<br/>
If the daggers/pine needles were throwing weapons that went in the ranged<br/>
weapon slot and used up one each time, that would make it a little bit<br/>
better, but they are not, so for 8cp or something silly like that you get<br/>
this item to raise your skill to its max with one nights work or less. As<br/>
for waiting to hear back from someone of authority, I agree, that is why I<br/>
and all my compatriots have /bug&#39;d this item. Your statement about them<br/>
using the archery skill due to the aim factor is just as much conjecture as<br/>
my statement, however. And by the way, the fact that they have such pathetic<br/>
damage makes them the reason that they are that much more powerful at<br/>
raising your archery skill.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I just hope that Verant fixes this major game-balance problem soon<br/>
before everyone and their momma is a master archer. :) I worked long and<br/>
hard to become as good at Archery as I am, and it seems silly that someone<br/>
can pick one of these items up and in a few hours of practice become a<br/>
master archer.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s hard;y a bug exploits. they use the arhcrey skill due to the<br/>
&gt; aim factor.<br/>
&gt; And the fact that they have such a pathetic damage. somthing like<br/>
&gt; 1,  tends to<br/>
&gt; suggest this. I would suggest to wait to hear back from some one<br/>
&gt; in authority<br/>
&gt; before declaring something to be a bug exploit.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The tiny daggers and pine needles are *extremely likley* bugged melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapons. I have seen them and tested them just enough to make<br/>
&gt; sure they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually bugged, and then I have /bug&#39;d them and continued on<br/>
&gt; my way. They<br/>
&gt; &gt; are melee weapons and help in the melee slot, there is<br/>
&gt; absolutely no reason<br/>
&gt; &gt; they should help out your archery skill. It would be very cheap<br/>
&gt; and possibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; an exploit to use these.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; one of those needle thingy&#39;s which are like daggers but use<br/>
&gt; the archery<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; skill.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; UMMM.. what needle thingys might those be?<br/>
