This may be kind of trival, but last night I started to<br/>
get really bummed.  My wife joined a &quot;good race only&quot;<br/>
guild and I am now unable to join with her.<br/>
<br/>
To make up for this, I went to Neriak and started<br/>
killing things. Heh.<br/>
I was on the hunt for Bone Chips so that I could stock<br/>
up for my pet spells. Regular Skellies are now blue and<br/>
ocasionally black.  While there I saved the life of a DE<br/>
Necro.  I ended up giving this Necro 14 bone chips, and<br/>
an almost complete set of Netted (after I bought a<br/>
complete set of leather, minus gloves and cap). I felt<br/>
content to help out another player, especially since I<br/>
know how much spells cost and how weak magic using<br/>
people are at low level.<br/>
&gt;From an RP perspective this was not against my class.<br/>
Why? I helped out an evil race necro.  In doing so I<br/>
have invested power in the war vs. the goodies.  It also<br/>
puts that Necro in my debt. Which she says she is and to<br/>
ask her for help anytime I need it. heh! That will come<br/>
in handy at later levels. ;)  Score one for Thule!<br/>
Now ack to the original statement and an inquirey.<br/>
Does anyone on this list know of a guild on Bertoxxulous<br/>
that accepts evil characters and is looking for<br/>
members?  The guild itself need not be evil, but that<br/>
would be ok too.  :)<br/>
