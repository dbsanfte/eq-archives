<div id="ygrps-yiv-322792003">Nods, being big had many disagvantages, but believe me, this is a bad one. I<br/>
mean, many spots in dungeons were just not made with this in mind. You have<br/>
no idea how bad it is, less you play a big race to 35 or so. I know all the<br/>
ogres/trolls in my guild that didnt have one wanted one badly.  And I know<br/>
why, and I cant help but feel sorry for them. Shrink spell can only be cast<br/>
when grouped with them by the way. Ill quit whining about it now, just<br/>
letting ya know what I think about it. BTW, my wifes ogre already has hers,<br/>
and I am a DE... Just feel for my friends is all, plus, I may wanta start a<br/>
ogre sk myself someday...8)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll agree that for larger races it does suck (disadvantage of being<br/>
&gt; large?), but maybe the timing of removing this item and getting Alchemy<br/>
&gt; fixed wasn&#39;t just coincidental. I&#39;ll bet that they either have or will<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; a Shrink spell in the game very soon. I&#39;m not going to lie about it though<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m extremely happy the change happened, and yes I think it should have<br/>
&gt; happened a lot sooner. I also think it may have been better if they would<br/>
&gt; have changed the effect to that of shrink (or Gnome, I&#39;ve always wanted to<br/>
&gt; be a Gnome SK). Oh well, whats done is done.<br/>

&gt; I think the change sucks, from the perspective of a large race. Many<br/>
&gt; dungeons are bugged, cant even walk into sola, get back down the stairs in<br/>
&gt; unrest, etc. This change hurts the large races bad, and came way too late,<br/>
&gt; atfer everyone and the brother done got it. Now large races are dependent<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; shamans to enter the dungeons. Sucks to depend on 1 class. Maybe they will<br/>
&gt; throw out a shrink type item, course prob require getting a rare pop off a<br/>
&gt; dragon or something. I also feel like all the real cool items are gone.<br/>
&gt; Manastones, guise, jboots, etc. On the older servers so many people<br/>
already<br/>
&gt; have these, and the ogrew that got there late will have to stand and shout<br/>
&gt; will pay for shrink at the dungeon entrance, while other people just click<br/>
&gt; on there mask. I am sure you smaller race shadowknights like the change<br/>
&gt; though.... Dont see why they waited 9 months to do it....<br/>

&gt; &gt; Non Dark Elfs probably won&#39;t like this as much, but it looks as though<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Guise is no longer dropping. There is a new mask dropping that gives the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same effect but must be worn to be used. As a Dark Elf I love this<br/>
change,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s nice to get some of my identity back..<br/>
