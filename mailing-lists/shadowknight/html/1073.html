<div id="ygrps-yiv-769812976">Look dude, this game can get to you, basically cause Verant frustrates you<br/>
to death, and alot of the players are worse. Yesterday we were doing steel<br/>
golem in cazik, guy loots it, says no one else gets to loot cause his level<br/>
41 rogue friend needs it and he doesnt have time to play. i was like wtf???<br/>
Made me so mad I couldnt see straight. I had quit playing, came back after 3<br/>
months(before character deleted), and well. so far, so good. I dont play<br/>
like I used too, but still get peeved at other players. There greed is just<br/>
amazing. So take a good long break, and come back when ya feel your ready.<br/>

&gt; ouch!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the first day the new quests surfaced some lv50 necro was camping<br/>
crusaders<br/>
&gt; to outfit his twink on my server...he&#39;s gone now. but assholes make up the<br/>
&gt; majority of our population inside and outside of eq...so it&#39;s just a fact<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; it sounds like the heinous &quot;eq-stress&quot; has invaded you and your life as it<br/>
&gt; has so many others. definitely sounds like a break is in order...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; but...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i recommend keeping your account active for a month or 2. i quit eq<br/>
entirely<br/>
&gt; for over a month once, for various reasons and i was glad i didn&#39;t cancel<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; sell off my items when i eventually came back...i don&#39;t play as much as i<br/>
&gt; used to or with the same desire but i still enjoy the game from time to<br/>
&gt; time. so, as long as it provides 10 hours of &quot;real fun&quot; each month...it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; worth the money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i think anyone can agree with that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; i just got word that the quests may have been changed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rumor has it that possibly only 1 item is need now<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of the 2.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; NOTE: i used the word rumor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone gone back to MM or Najena for quest info?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The skeleton gave teh same message today, but conned red to a 36th<br/>
&gt; &gt;level, which is an improvement.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I, myself, am leaving EQ, beacause I can&#39;t stand the majority of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the people on my server.  A druid and a level 50 warrior were tracking<br/>
&gt; &gt;down and killing all of the crusaders in cazic today so that they could<br/>
&gt; &gt;do the quests, and then try to find a way to trade the nodrop armor<br/>
&gt; &gt;to a low level twink.  She was not only doing this, but competing<br/>
&gt; &gt;with me in /auction for looting pieces.  Earlier, I gave the rogue<br/>
&gt; &gt;in my group the ravenscale legs without even doing a random, and she<br/>
&gt; &gt;wasn&#39;t even someone I knew.  Both Verant and the players on my<br/>
&gt; &gt;server have made it more of a chore to play than fun.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So good luck everyone finding your armor, hope you live on a more<br/>
&gt; &gt;civil server than Tunare.<br/>
