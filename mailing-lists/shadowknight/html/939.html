<div id="ygrps-yiv-425009602">[seems doubtful that there will be any hybrid quests available in the <br/>
temple. casters do make up the vocal and actual majority of players out <br/>
there. so, it would seem likely our end of the spectrum would be overlooked <br/>
in a patch/update as it has been many times before. but on the brighter <br/>
side...unless verant has suddenly erased the benefits of npc slaugter...this <br/>
new zone could prove to be an excellent feeding ground for slayers like <br/>
ourselves.]<br/>
<br/>
on another note...my standing with sol ro has gone rather sour as of <br/>
late...as my cohorts and i have released the souls of his worshippers <br/>
countless times. which leaves me to wonder...<br/>
<br/>
how will he feel when i come knocking at his temple door?<br/>

&gt;I explored this on the Test server, and it only had quests for<br/>
&gt;Magicians, Necros, Enchanters, and clerics, alhough there were serveral<br/>
&gt;other robed, named NPC&#39;s that may have wizard classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There was not a soul wielding a sword in the whole place.  Are they<br/>
&gt;going to add in some quests for us there, or was it intended to be<br/>
&gt;mage and cleric only?<br/>
