<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471115982">&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
especially when you are older and can afford a nice bow. <br/>
I can&#39;t wait for a darkwood.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Darkwoods are kewl, but a Trueshot Longbow may be <br/>
cheaper.  If you can find a Ranger with a Fletching <br/>
skill of 160+ then they may be willing to make the bow <br/>
for you.  The only thing that would make this a pain in <br/>
the spleen is that the Micro Servos off clockworks are <br/>
now NO DROP items, and would require the maker of the <br/>
bow to loot the creature.<br/>
There was 1 ranger that teamed up with a fighter to make <br/>
the bow and they spent 3 hours running around Ak&#39;annon <br/>
for the servos.  Then they sought the quest originator <br/>
and failed many times even at 160+ skill.  It is a <br/>
cheaper route (if the Fletcher is nice to try for free <br/>
because of failure rate) than a Darkwood, but very time <br/>
consuming.<br/>
I had a Ranger and was on the list.  Last I heard the <br/>
quest needed a master fletcher, but that part was broken <br/>
as many people with skills of 20-45 were able to make <br/>
it. 1 person tried 40 times in a row and succeeded on <br/>
the 40th try at skill 32. Just pray to the random number <br/>
generator.  They may have fixed that though.<br/>
<br/>
Verant also fixed the range issue with bows.  Before <br/>
every bow had an effective range of 50 even if the stats <br/>
said 150.  To do max damage with the bow you need to be <br/>
almost out of range.  The closer to the target the less <br/>
damage you do.<br/>
To max you skill in Archery is a long road.  What worked <br/>
for my Ranger was to stand behind a MOB already engaged <br/>
and plink away at it.  You will NEVER do enough damage <br/>
to kill steal and they usually like the help.  You may <br/>
want to ask, but I have yet to be told &quot;no I don&#39;t want <br/>
you to weaken this yellow MOB for me even if only by 10%&quot;<br/>
GREEN and RED cons will not advance your skill. The <br/>
reason for this is like a deep RED resisting a spell. <br/>
Spelling it just won&#39;t happen.  And GREEN is always <br/>
trivial and will never advance any skill.<br/>
<br/>
A Rough Hickory Recurve Bow is cheap and can be made for <br/>
3GP cost (I think) and any Ranger should be willing to <br/>
do this. Range is the same as a Hunting Bow, but damage <br/>
is double. I hit for 11 damage consistantly at max range.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this was so long, but SKs need all the info they <br/>
can get. :)<br/>
