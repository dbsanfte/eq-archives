<div id="ygrps-yiv-644908430">It is dropping..but it seems to be a 25% chance for a<br/>
drop..at least that has been our experience.<br/>
I personally have a Decayed Left Vambrace. A friend<br/>
has a Bracer.<br/>
Out of maybe 5 or 6 kills, those are the ony 2.<br/>
Another friend has killed about the same number and<br/>
got none.<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned before this is worse than camping rubi.<br/>
Not only do they seem to be slow spawns, but the<br/>
decayed stuff is a semi-rare drop. AND you need<br/>
multiple pieces for each piece of SK armor. So since<br/>
all the drops are random, you may never see the second<br/>
part to the one you already have. And since they are<br/>
NO DROP, you cant trade with your friends.<br/>
<br/>
What i am trying is offering cash for the location of<br/>
any crusader or for the looting rights to any decaying<br/>
armor. So far it hasnt worked. Too many SKs in the<br/>
zone who want it for themselves, but their are lots of<br/>
Rogues in their now. So i plan on holding any Raven<br/>
armor for ransom.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the grind<br/>
