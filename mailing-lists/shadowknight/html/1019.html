<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322502434">crusaders dont seem to have any set spawn point. im quite sure they are <br/>
random spawns in spots that spawn higher level lizards (zealots etc..)which <br/>
is good imo...since it won&#39;t be possible for anyone group to monopolize the <br/>
spawn.<br/>
<br/>
unfortunately, on my server the most accessible spawn was camped yesterday <br/>
by guess what?<br/>
<br/>
a lv50 necro looking to twink his newbie sk...<br/>
<br/>
the one decayed drop i have seen was a decayed right boot...suprise! seems <br/>
like this is the only drop that has showed up anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
the one crusader i fought was mid 30&#39;s in level...hit for 80...hted at least <br/>
twice during the battle...and quite nearly wiped out all 3 people who <br/>
attacked it. without the help of a high level bard sending charmed gators at <br/>
it...it would surely have killed everyone.<br/>
<br/>
so as it is...ive given up on these quests...im working on collecting all <br/>
the non-decayed component&#39;s i can for now. hopefully we&#39;ll stand a chance at <br/>
having a successful camp (sad that camping will be neccessary...since these <br/>
lizards are powerful enough that small to mid cazic xp group which is <br/>
generally &lt;lv39 will have a hell of a time taking one down) when my partner <br/>
and i reach 50 over the next month sometime in the next month or so.<br/>

&gt;Crusaders are Damn tough.  I&#39;ve seen some level 50 SK&#39;s try and solo them,<br/>
&gt;and they got their asses handed to them.  they&#39;re on steroids.<br/>
&gt;Plus they&#39;re SK&#39;s also.  They like to generally open with Harm Touch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lowest level one I&#39;ve seen was level 36.............<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;So, what level are they, and how hard are they to find within Cazic-Thule?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Good thing about the mistmoore faction BTW, although I&#39;d still like to get<br/>
&gt;&gt;it up in case one of the inhabitants ends up being the key to an sk sword<br/>
&gt;&gt;etc...<br/>
