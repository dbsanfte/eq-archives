<b>Subject:</b> Concerns With SK Class <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699201931">I am new to this mailing list, so if this ends up being a repeat of<br/>
messages sent out by others, i apologize in advance.<br/>
<br/>
I play a Human Shadow Knight named Bathory on the Cazic-Thule server,<br/>
currently level 11 and residing in Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed personally as I gain levels and have heard from many<br/>
other SKs of all races and levels that there seem to be problems with<br/>
certain areas of this class.<br/>
My main concern is with Harm Touch. This is supposed to be the<br/>
opposite, but EQUAL of the Paladin&#39;s Lay on Hands. <br/>
<br/>
1. Now lets crunch some numbers here.<br/>
-LoH potentially heals upto about 1000HP<br/>
-HT at its best, at level 50, will do 501 pts dmg<br/>
-  501=1000 ? Not last I knew<br/>
Now here&#39;s my thoughts on this. I do feel that our HT should do equal<br/>
dmg that LoH does healing. Now many feel, including some SKs, that this<br/>
would be too powerful. And i can see that point. But my question is,<br/>
why do Paladins get such a strong healing spell? If HT is  supposed to<br/>
be the equal of paladins LoH, why isnt it?<br/>
<br/>
2. HT is resisted way too often for comfort when fighting higher level<br/>
creatures. For a &quot;special&quot; feature, it doesn&#39;t seem too special when<br/>
you need to do that 111 pts damage because you&#39;re getting stomped on<br/>
and you see the message &quot;target has resisted your Harm Touch&quot;. <br/>
Lets go back to LoH. How often is that resisted? I review many message<br/>
boards, and i have yet to see a single complaint about LoH being<br/>
resisted.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. Partial Damage. Ive seen myself and heard from many others that even<br/>
when it doesn&#39;t get resisted totally, it will do only half damage. And<br/>
an even more disturbing report is that on occasion it will do only<br/>
19dmg. Unless you&#39;re having trouble with that pesky large rat, 19dmg<br/>
isn&#39;t gonna do a whole heck of a lot.<br/>
LoH? Again, i&#39;ve heard no complaints on this.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention of course, for something we can use only once a day, it<br/>
should work and work to its full potential every time.<br/>
<br/>
4. I feel, to make HT a viable weapon, it needs to either, do equal<br/>
damage as LoH does healing, or boost its power some but have it<br/>
available more than once per day. And in either case have it NEVER<br/>
resisted.<br/>
<br/>
Those are my main concerns.<br/>
<br/>
My other concerns I feel are less important, but important still.<br/>
I feel the spells we received could be boosted some, or at least have<br/>
available some spells that are more useful.<br/>
The first set we get are useful, but kinda lame. OK, i can deal with<br/>
that, because its our first set. But at level 15, I see no reason why<br/>
we shouldn&#39;t have a HP drain spell and a shielding spell. And have a<br/>
new drain spell every circle after that, especially since i have yet to<br/>
hear any success with Vampiric Embrace actually working the way it<br/>
supposed to.<br/>
And if Necros get gate at level 5, giving it to us at level 22 or so,<br/>
isnt too much to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Some may say that Paladins spells are lame too, so why am i<br/>
complaining? Well, lets get back to the fact that our damage spells are<br/>
resisted by most of the creatures that we&#39;ll be fighting. I don&#39;t<br/>
believe Paladins have this problem with their healing and buffing<br/>
spells. So we should have more useful and effective spells to<br/>
compensate for this.<br/>
<br/>
Its not my intention to make SKs all powerful or equal to Necromancers<br/>
in casting abilities, but I do feel we are not equal, as we should be,<br/>
overall.<br/>
<br/>
The fighting abilties, I have yet to find a reason to complain. We<br/>
eventually get all the main features of fighters except Kick and<br/>
Duel-Wield. I have no problem waiting for them as long as I do get<br/>
them. We can wear any type of armor and use any type of weapon except<br/>
for a very few.<br/>
<br/>
Now let me state that I do indeed like being a SK, i like being evil,<br/>
doing evil quests and not having to be nice all the time. And I fully<br/>
accept being hated by NPCs and occasionally KoS.<br/>
<br/>
I have already submitted a Feedback Form via Sony Station and I know<br/>
others have as well. But it seems a bigger kick in the butt is needed<br/>
to get the Dev team to notice this. I would like to stage a massive<br/>
write in by SKs of all races and levels on all servers.<br/>
<br/>
I am open to suggestions on when and how this should be done. Whether<br/>
it would be more effective while on-line, using the /feedback command<br/>
on a Friday or Sat. night getting as many SKs on-line to do it as<br/>
possible or just getting as many as possible at their convenience to<br/>
submit thru Sony Station&#39;s Feedback Form.<br/>
<br/>
This ended up being way longer than i originally thought, and i&#39;m sorry<br/>
if i bored you,but these are issues that I feel are important and after<br/>
speaking with many other SKs, i know i&#39;m not alone.<br/>
<br/>
Any feedback or suggestions are welcome, whether they agree with my<br/>
opinions or not.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks For Hanging in there,<br/>
