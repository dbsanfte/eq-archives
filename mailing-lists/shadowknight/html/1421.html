<b>Subject:</b> Iksar SK questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493974892">I play an Iksar SK on Vazaelle and I was looking for some ideas <br/>
regarding 2hs wpns at this lvl with the new patch that went into <br/>
effect.<br/>
My other question is in regards to the SK epic and if it is much more <br/>
difficult for an Iksar than the other races?  Thanks.<br/>
