&gt; Well, I have everything except the bracers and leggings. I am not familier<br/>
&gt; at all wih solusek a, but I do have a map. How hard is this malatite to get?<br/>
&gt; clockworks tough? I heard they werre totally resistant to magic. This mean a<br/>
&gt; tank heavy group with a shaman/cleric to keep them running?  (we are in 30+<br/>
&gt; range)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The EXG is magic resistant, but the other clockworks aren&#39;t.  You&#39;ll<br/>
have the best luck with the M series clockworks near the foreman area,<br/>
I didn&#39;t get any when storming the gnome castle.  Beware the MB and CB<br/>
series as they push you back with a force attack, and may knock you in<br/>
lava.<br/>

&gt; there 6 hours with no spawn. We grouped with them for awhile, but no way am<br/>
&gt; I gonna do a 16 hour camp (or more) for the shackles. Then come and do it<br/>
&gt; again? Geesh, who wants to stand and line for them? Any tips on getting the<br/>
&gt; mino to spawn? How long has it taken you all?<br/>
&gt; Any tips of getting the malatite? The armor I think looks very damn cool on<br/>
&gt; a ogre...8) But I wanta get rid of these bronze leggings and bracers asap.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any help/tips in advance.<br/>

spawns south of the caves behind the big gears.  Seems to be on a<br/>
2-4 hour spawnn, perhaps killing the wandering Mino&#39;s in Steamfont<br/>
helps?<br/>
