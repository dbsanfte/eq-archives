<b>Subject:</b> FW: [shadowknight] ht vs loh again <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-230512225"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;actually, i talked to a guy who said that loh could only heal like 600 hp<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;max.. of course, i dont have a paladin char, so somebody else has to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>confirm<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;or deny that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course at level 50 we only get 500points HT (If they dont shrug it off)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;fights once you get hide.. shadow step, hide, and shoot them in the back<br/>
&gt;once they turn around while looking. its right out of the movies :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>..and that would take how long at 5 or 10 points an arrow?, How many arrows?<br/>
especially considering he can go down to 20 HP, LoH and we start over?(well<br/>
he does...)</div>
