<div id="ygrps-yiv-794312726">I&#39;m not sure about how crowded your server is, but Blackburrow was a good<br/>
spot for me from 15-17.  You can be bound in Qeynos and there is a Barbarian<br/>
merchant that you can sell to in West Karanas.  Another good place is<br/>
Unrest.  You can fight blue mobs in there until the cows come home, just<br/>
stay in the back of the house area to keep away from the trains.  Some aqua<br/>
gobs and orc camps can be solo&#39;ed outside in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron as well.  I<br/>
never found a merchant to sell to evils out in Faydwer though, so I would<br/>
sell to other players at a reduced cost.  Be warned however, in both cases,<br/>
you will be far from any evil city bank and the coins can weigh you down<br/>
quite a bit.  In long stays abroad, I typically use my copper to buy<br/>
summoned bandages and other such things that I don&#39;t really need, but it<br/>
helps keep my weight down.  Having a few thousand coins was not uncommon<br/>
(but it&#39;s nice when you do return to town and bank your 30+ plat you&#39;ve<br/>
accumulated).<br/>

Where besides Commonlands Oasis and Ro would be a good<br/>
place for a 15th level SK to get to/adventure solo while<br/>
looking for a group? KoS is a big factor here.  :)<br/>
