<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939629795">while i am also rather annoyed that this mana cost thing was unannounced, i<br/>
do agree with bathory that the high mana cost is not a major issue. i read a<br/>
post on the SK forum of eqstratics by a (47?) sk who decided to try soloing<br/>
with these things. he reported downtime reduced from 27 minutes to more like<br/>
7. i dont know if thats believeable or not exactly, but if so then those<br/>
taps are just fine by me ;) the are here to reduce downtime, give us<br/>
something to spend all our &quot;extra&quot; mana on, and PERHAPS begin to adress<br/>
verant&#39;s &quot;human and DE sk are underpowered&quot; stance. and heck, after months<br/>
of sitting on my heinie regenerating hp at an abysmally slow rate, anything<br/>
to speed it up is welcome ;p<br/>
