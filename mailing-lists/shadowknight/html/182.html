<div id="ygrps-yiv-832551344">I think you need to put things in perspective. Remember this game maxes out<br/>
at level 50. In the mid teens you certainly haven&#39;t hit your stride. If this<br/>
game parallels DnD as much as it appears to have:<br/>
<br/>
Fighters have the advantage at low levels<br/>
Cross breeds (Shadow Knights, Paladins) Have the Advantage at mid level<br/>
Magic types have the advantage at high levels<br/>

Exactly, I am a dark elf necromancer...<br/>
Why is my wife an ogre sk? that is the class we picked to come with me, the<br/>
best possible combination we could think of...<br/>
She could have made a bard, wizard, warrior, shaman, cleric, whatever...<br/>
But we chose a shadow knight..<br/>
She just got level 13...<br/>
She cracks for 28 a whack with halberd, can invite the mob with impart str,<br/>
(which keeps it from coming at me)..<br/>
She also uses my skellie the right way, back off, taunts when skellie hurt<br/>
bad, etc...plue we got her skellie hitting also...<br/>
Then ya got me in the background throwing heat blood, etc..<br/>
Awesome combination, the only problem we have is her hitpoints, god, takes<br/>
forever for her to heal, i cant wait till she gets lifetap spells, but until<br/>
then...<br/>
The shamans and clerics need to be needed too....8)<br/>

P.S. We are saving for banded mail..god is she gonna be mean<br/>

&gt; Even though I do feel, as I&#39;m sure you all know by now, that HT and<br/>
&gt; some of the spells do need tweaking, I must defend the SK class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It has always been said from the beginning that we will NEVER be as<br/>
&gt; good a tank or fighter as a Warrior. We will NEVER be as good a caster<br/>
&gt; as a Necromancer.<br/>
&gt; This should not take you by surprise.<br/>
&gt; And you&#39;re only level 10? You&#39;re still a baby to the class, along with<br/>
&gt; myself i will add.<br/>
&gt; I have a friend who is level 20 SK and he&#39;s a major butt-kicker. We do<br/>
&gt; come into our power, but patience and hard work is required.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And if you dont want to role-play the character, you chose the wrong<br/>
&gt; line of work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a level 12 Human SK. I have seen the Necromancers I travel with go<br/>
&gt; from a level or 2 behind me, to 3 or levels ahead of me. And it is a<br/>
&gt; little disheartening. But, this is the curse of the hybrid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But even these now higher level Necros like a little more muscle in<br/>
&gt; between them and the creature wanting to dance on their foreheads. They<br/>
&gt; cant cast if they&#39;re getting beat on.<br/>
&gt; There have been many situations when even their pet has been killed and<br/>
&gt; i&#39;m whats left to take the beating. Which i seem to enjoy in a weird<br/>
&gt; and twisted way.<br/>
&gt; I still save their butts as often as they save mine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And when they are out of mana and cant cast those spells that we are so<br/>
&gt; jealous of and a train or high ranked creature decides to appear? Whos<br/>
&gt; left? Us :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, in short, 10 is too young to decide. If you dont have the<br/>
&gt; patience to wait until you come into your power, then SK is the wrong<br/>
&gt; class for you. I can see my powers slowly, but surely rising.<br/>
&gt; I have no doubt I WILL be feared.<br/>
