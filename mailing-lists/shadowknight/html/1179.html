<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812855699">is it even possible to have good najena faction? i&#39;ve never seen a positive <br/>
adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
as a side note, i&#39;ve never killed a mistmoore npc but i have killed easily <br/>
100+ bards for +MayongMistmoore hits. i am still 100% kos, scowls at you <br/>
ready to attack in MistMoore. the faction there is broken imo. also, when i <br/>
went to turn the parts in mistmoore: first, a shadowy scribe cast force <br/>
shocked me to death through a wall as i was leaving. second, after i <br/>
collected my body i made my way all the way to the castle gates...the guards <br/>
were positioned in such a way that my troll absolutely could not fit past <br/>
them. though i did manage to get stuck in a crouch position between <br/>
them...then watched as my invis died. needless to say, i died shortly after.<br/>
<br/>
so, if you go to mistmoree bring a rescue group and bind in gfay (i was <br/>
bound in grobb) as the zone is bugged to hell and back.<br/>

&gt;luckily, the undead knight (the guy who makes shadow knight armor) has<br/>
&gt;temple of solusek ro faction, NOT najena faction. so you can kill stuff in<br/>
&gt;najena to your hearts content and he&#39;ll still like you. HOWEVER, since he<br/>
&gt;appears in drelzna&#39;s room... it would be nice to have high najena faction <br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;you can survive the trip down there a bit more easily!<br/>
