<div id="ygrps-yiv-654780534">I was going to make a suggestion in the earlier post, but hit send to early.<br/>
I would suggest creating a HSK of Innoruk and traveling to Neriak to see if<br/>
you can train there.  If not, then I&#39;m not sure either choice is better.<br/>
Cronik worships Thule.  I am not entirely sure if it is racial or religious<br/>
differances that prevent me from taining there. I am able to train in<br/>
Freeport though.  I have yet to go into Oggok other than to be bound in the<br/>
entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Does worshiping Bertoxx make you start in Qeynos?  I hate Freeport and would<br/>
choose to start in Qeynos anyday of the year. I have not done this, so I<br/>
also am not sure if the wandering Ranger NPCs will KoS you or not, though I<br/>
think they will. But it does give you access to the Karanas without all the<br/>
hassle that a DE or Troll has.<br/>
As far as stats go, I think what you have in mind will work fine.<br/>
Personally, I would increase them both by 10. But then again I don&#39;t know<br/>
how much Agility affects AC after 20th either.<br/>

| If you only play Trolls, be careful about creatures that attack with<br/>
poison!<br/>
| I had played Cronik so long that I didn&#39;t worry about poison attacks<br/>
against<br/>
| my DE Rogue because I was used to the troll regen rate for HPs. Let me<br/>
tell<br/>
| you I have stopped attacking poisonous creatures with him.  I died more<br/>

| | I&#39;ve have 2 TSK characters, but have tired of both because of the<br/>
crushing<br/>
| EXP penalty, so I though I&#39;d try out a human SK.  A few questions:<br/>
| |<br/>
| | 1)  What is the best god for HSK?  Innoruuk or Bertox?  Which cities can<br/>
| each enter safely without having to kill anything?  I&#39;m assuming the human<br/>
| cities plus High Hold for both, plus Neriak for Innoruuk SK&#39;s.  Can either<br/>
| safely enter a city on either Faydwer or Erudin?<br/>
| |<br/>
| | 2)  Starting stats.  I was thinking +5 Str and + 15 AGI to set each to<br/>
90.<br/>
| Any thoughts on what a good Str value is.  Should I bump it to 100.  How<br/>
| heavy is medium armor?<br/>
| |<br/>
| | Thanks for any input.<br/>
