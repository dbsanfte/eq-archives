<div id="ygrps-yiv-242881198">This may sound stupid, but how can you make commands like /corpse or /loc<br/>
into hotkeys? I have been trying to figure it out since I set up my keys,<br/>
but haven&#39;t been able to do it. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.<br/>

to cast &gt;invis or camo on you.  Make the /corpse command a hotkey.  Get near<br/>
your corpse &gt;and drag it along to a safe spot in the zone by contiually<br/>
clicking the hotkey &gt;with your mouse.  Your invis will not wear off until<br/>
you right click on your &gt;corpse.</div>
