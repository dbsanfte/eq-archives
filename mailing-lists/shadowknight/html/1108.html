<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250050811"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My question to you all, is this:<br/>
&gt; Does this sound like a bug? The part of him going<br/>
&gt; Aggro on anyone instead of just the one who was<br/>
&gt; fighting a Najena Inhabitant?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bug, but it does make it DAMN hard to get to the UK and<br/>
have a decent conversation with him. The way Beld did it was he met up with<br/>
one of my guild&#39;s clerics (Ternada) and after they cleared the necros, the<br/>
cleric put a soothe-type spell (don&#39;t remember the cleric version&#39;s name) on<br/>
the UK and then Beld talked to him. Also, consider bringing along an<br/>
enchanter to mes the necros and/or mindwipe the UK after you kill the<br/>
necros.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel it should be this hard to get to our quest giver, let alone<br/>
have him attack US. Anyway, /feedback or /petition it, I dunno. You CAN talk<br/>
to the UK, but you definitely need some help.<br/>
