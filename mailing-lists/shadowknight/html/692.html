<b>Subject:</b> RE: New Spells Apparently Being Implemented <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729200425">I spoke with our magic system designer and he does not believe those spells (Infectious cloud, Spirit Armor, and Augment Death) are<br/>
supposed to be for Shadow Knights and thus might be a data entry error.  He&#39;s double checking these.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also talking to him about possibly changing some other aspects of SKs to make them more viable in the low/mid-levels.<br/>
<br/>
One problem that SKs face -- and one of the reasons that they are so difficult to play -- is that they were tuned on the assumption<br/>
that you would be playing an Ogre or Troll.  As such, human SKs are quite possibly the second most difficult class/race combination<br/>
in the game to play (after Erudite Paladin).<br/>
