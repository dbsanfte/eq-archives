<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383260980">It appears that the max damage for Harm Touch has been<br/>
increased.<br/>
I level 50 friend recently did 600ish.<br/>
 I have only used HT once since the supposed chance. I<br/>
used it against Estrelle (or somehitng) in KK. It only<br/>
did 169. So the resist is still there.<br/>
Has anyone else noticed this, and have you figured out<br/>
the new formula for it?<br/>
Used to be:  level * 10 + 1<br/>
Example:  level 20 * 10 + 1 = 201 DMG<br/>
<br/>
Could be that its after a certain level too.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I will be paying closer attention to it today.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll just HT a giant rat or something.<br/>
