Wow, just wondering if Santa Claws got all of the other Shadow Knights out<br/>
there, or what?  I have not recd a digest since the 10th of Dec. and was<br/>
wondering what&#39;s up?<br/>
<br/>
If anyone out there is getting this, what is a GOOD area for a 20th lvl DE<br/>
SK to go and hunt?  I have been hunting in HPH and getting good xps, but<br/>
wondering where to go next.  Also, has anyone *ever* gotten to the point<br/>
where they were not KOS to the HP guards?<br/>
<br/>
As an additional aside, I was wondering what the general consensus was on<br/>
costs for the following items:  Silvery-plated Bracer, Blackened Iron Armor<br/>
(any piece or general guideline, like 5plat per AC or what?), BIBS, and Dark<br/>
Reaver?<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone out there?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re looking for an easy way to some decent armor you might want to see<br/>
if you can creep down to Lower Guk and pick up some Shin armor. There are<br/>
often corpses around just waiting to be looted since it is no drop and<br/>
anyone there already has it or doesn&#39;t want it. It drops of Shin Ghoul<br/>
Knights, although at 20 you certainly won&#39;t be killing them yourself (just<br/>
mooching the loot lol), although people shouldn&#39;t mind. Silvery-Plated<br/>
Bracer is a nice thing to have, mainly because of the look of course (poison<br/>
and disease resists are nice too since it augemnts our natural resists as<br/>
sks), and the fact that it isn&#39;t too expensive.<br/>
BI doesn&#39;t have good AC, but personally I put on certain pieces once I<br/>
started to get really sick of bronze (to the point where I hated my char and<br/>
refused to play unless I looked sufficiently cool).<br/>
The BIBs is great for the 20s, try to have a Reaver by 30 tho (you won&#39;t<br/>
regret it, being the DE you are hehe).<br/>
As for where to hunt, I soloed or grouped the Aviak Guards in Lake Rathe,<br/>
another option would be Unrest, although that might not be great exp since<br/>
you&#39;ll have to acquaint yourself with the dungeon (unless you alrady know<br/>
it).<br/>
