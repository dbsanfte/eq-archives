I think of myself as Angry more then Evil. Innouruk got screwed over by the<br/>
rest of the Gods (Read the history in the front of the manual), and I am<br/>
Innorouk&#39;s sword of vengeance!<br/>

Subject: [shadowknight] Newbie here :) with questions..<br/>
<br/>
I recently created a DE Sk..and have a question about role-playing<br/>
the character. Now she is looked on by most to be evil...yet..would<br/>
she not have a different view of herself?<br/>
<br/>
Would she believe herself, her race, and God are not the evil ones?<br/>
How can that really be roll-played..and remember this is a total<br/>
newbie to role-playing here.<br/>
<br/>
I have other characters..but seem to find my little Sk the hardest to<br/>
figure out :(<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions? Or any relevant info or guids on the web I can look<br/>
up?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! :)<br/>
