<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867188133">I agree with the HT arguement...its too often resisted and sometimes it<br/>
doesn&#39;t even do full damage which it should....for only being used once a<br/>
day...sometimes its pretty worthless.  The spell list is alright...i think<br/>
if we had at least on more movement spell...or maybe another way of<br/>
getting HP back...because unless you are a Troll....its takes a long time<br/>
to get HP and i only have a little bit over 200 at 8th level.<br/>
