&gt; I recommend a Mith 2h sword.   I don&#39;t have one (I have a reaver) but<br/>
&gt; the Haste effect I heard about was good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it&#39;ll only cost you about 12,000pp.  Seriously, that&#39;s out of<br/>
line at 26th level unless you have a really good primary char or crazy<br/>
guildmates/friends.<br/>
<br/>
At 26th I&#39;d get a BIBS from Runnyeye (or buy for about 300-400pp) or<br/>
a Gigantic Zweihander (from everfrost).  If you are on an older server,<br/>
you can likely pick up a Dark Reaver for pp long before you could <br/>
ever get it yourself, the demand isn&#39;t there, so the price is lower<br/>
than the item is worth to us.<br/>
<br/>
I find it hard to believe someone would own a Mith 2H before level 35.<br/>
I got mine at 40, through trading.<br/>
