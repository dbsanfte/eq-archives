<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-471695002">The 2 Opals i know of are the DE Necro in the sewers,<br/>
which is under the building in east FP.<br/>
The other is a HE Wizard (?) in the arcane science<br/>
building. The Opal i need to find is indeed the<br/>
traitor spoken about in a different quest. But neither<br/>
the DE or HE respond to the keywords.<br/>
Looks like i will have to hire a warrior to do that<br/>
quest and see where it leads me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks anyway<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Somehow my email program burped and I lost your<br/>
&gt; reply <br/>
&gt; Countess.....<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I can&#39;t remember what I have already sent,<br/>
&gt; so I <br/>
&gt; will just pick a start point.<br/>
&gt; The last time I was in Freeport surface world was<br/>
&gt; over 3 <br/>
&gt; weeks ago. Last time I was in the Slums of the<br/>
&gt; surface <br/>
&gt; was 2 months ago.  <br/>
&gt; I was talking to my wife about this and when you<br/>
&gt; brought <br/>
&gt; up the 2 Opals I may have blurred 2 different topics<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; together.<br/>
&gt; In the Slums of East Freeport, behind the leather <br/>
&gt; shop/town wall, (I think I said West last time,<br/>
&gt; sorry) <br/>
&gt; my wife said there is a Dark Elf Opal Darkbriar<br/>
&gt; behind <br/>
&gt; one of the buildings, though she is not sure which<br/>
&gt; one.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Could you repost the Opals that you know the<br/>
&gt; locations <br/>
&gt; of? ie the HE Enchanter in Arcane Science is a <br/>
&gt; definate.  Now I am fuzzy on where you said the<br/>
&gt; other <br/>
&gt; Opal is.   I don&#39;t have the thread that lead up to<br/>
&gt; this, <br/>
&gt; and can&#39;t remember if you said the 2nd Opal was a<br/>
&gt; Human <br/>
&gt; in the sewers by the other guild leaders, or if it<br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; the DE on the surface in the Slums of East Feerport.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There may be no 3rd Opal.  :)<br/>
&gt; The objet in the room I was thinking of happened at<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; same time that my wife and I noticed 2 differant<br/>
&gt; Opals <br/>
&gt; and I may have put them together by association. <br/>
&gt; The <br/>
&gt; object was an incomplete vent pipe and steam in the <br/>
&gt; upper floor of the forge house (I think Groflah&#39;s <br/>
&gt; Forge?) that was in the slum area of East Freeport.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am very sorry for any wasted time you spent on my <br/>
&gt; earlier post.  I hate Freeport anyway since my PC<br/>
&gt; always <br/>
&gt; locks up when I enter it.  West Freeport is the<br/>
&gt; worst <br/>
&gt; because of the Arcane science building, followed by<br/>
&gt; East <br/>
&gt; Freeport because of the boat.  North Freeport never <br/>
&gt; locks me up.  The Bank in Neriak slows me down<br/>
&gt; because <br/>
&gt; of the magic guild next to it and all the spells<br/>
&gt; going <br/>
&gt; off.<br/>
&gt; This leads me to a new thread, coming soon to your <br/>
&gt; mailbox. :)<br/>
