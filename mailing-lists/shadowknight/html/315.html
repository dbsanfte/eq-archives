<b>Subject:</b> ht vs loh again <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-774771319">actually, i talked to a guy who said that loh could only heal like 600 hp at<br/>
max.. of course, i dont have a paladin char, so somebody else has to confirm<br/>
or deny that.<br/>
<br/>
also, not all of our spells suck compared to paladin spells. please note<br/>
that paladins have NO ranged damage-dealing attacks whatsoever, except<br/>
against undead. they have no general nukes, no DOTs, they cant even use<br/>
archery. which makes it a bit odd that they can root.. hmm. anyway, while<br/>
they DO have an annoying array of effective spells, a shadowknight can<br/>
easily take down a paladin if they play a game of keep-away (and resist<br/>
those annoying blind spells).  in other words, use of shadow step combined<br/>
with archery and our lovely clinging darkness series of spells will royally<br/>
mess up a paladin. and since they have no ability to detect invis, imagine<br/>
fights once you get hide.. shadow step, hide, and shoot them in the back<br/>
once they turn around while looking. its right out of the movies :)<br/>
<br/>
yes, many of our damage dealing spells do kind of suck for our level. but<br/>
who needs meganukes when you can dish out 70 or 80 damage a combat round<br/>
with a BBC? just add the little bits our spells add to that and we are<br/>
already ahead.. just remember to always keep your darkness spells handy and<br/>
keep siphoning every once in a while. i can see why they took away our<br/>
ability to use banshee aura at lvl 39.. jeez, can you imagine a guy who can<br/>
nail you for 50-60 damage a hit AND you take damage every time you hit back?<br/>
we are supposed to be scary, but that is just mean :) so they replace it<br/>
with shieldskin, which is at least a well-needed AC boost for us. and while<br/>
taking away boil blood as a lvl 49 spell hurts, i can see the reasoning for<br/>
that too, since we have none of the other blood magic spells. they just give<br/>
us the best of the darkness series in place of it. doesnt DOT as much hp,<br/>
but it slows em and lasts forever and a day..<br/>
<br/>
and one last advantage: half or more of the sk around are large races, while<br/>
ALL paladins are medium or small. create a newbie ogre sk, and then a newbie<br/>
high elf paladin, and the difference in survivability is noticeable. even a<br/>
newbie barbarian shaman can hold off multiple enemies by himself at lvl 2 or<br/>
3, demonstrating just how buff the large melee-types would be. while the<br/>
high elf just gets pounded :) also, my guildmaster is a paladin (stop<br/>
LOOKING at me like that!) and he is constantly complaining about how<br/>
worthless he is against anything but undead opponents. just take heart, and<br/>
if you simply cant survive duels against a paladin of your same level, take<br/>
some time out, put on a few levels, and perfect your dueling strategy. trust<br/>
me, you will come out on top ;)<br/>
