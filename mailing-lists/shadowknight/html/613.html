<b>Subject:</b> Grobb Cleaver Quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004329258">I saw a post this morning that said the Troll in OOT is <br/>
between 20-24th level MOB. It also siad that getting the <br/>
Recipe from the Troll (by killing it) lowered faction <br/>
with DaBashers and Shadow Knights of Grobb.  /con Carver <br/>
before you kill Nerbilik and see what you con to him. <br/>
Try to get your faction up to about Amiable if not <br/>
already (ie indifferant). This way the faction hits will <br/>
not prevent you from getting the Cleaver.  The poster <br/>
said he gave the Cleaver with a /con of dubious.<br/>
What raises Faction with Grobb SKs and DaBashers?<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you need to do the locker part of the <br/>
quest or not. Anyone?<br/>
