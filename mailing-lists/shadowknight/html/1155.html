 </span></blockquote>First off, the spells are not all that powerful.<br/>
<br/>
For a necromancer at the levels he/she gets the spells yes they can be<br/>
powerful for that class. They dont have much health to start with.<br/>
<br/>
As for when shadow knights get these spells, we are looking at a Troll Sk<br/>
with almost 300 hitpoints (or more) at lvl 9 so the little life tap isnt<br/>
going to effect him much. As he / she gets each additional spell at their<br/>
corisponding levels it can help out in getting you that last hit in but<br/>
thats about it.<br/>
<br/>
For the so called &quot;power&quot; of the spells the mana requirement is going to<br/>
keep them in the back of the book. I thoght the pets could be useless I now<br/>
see the life taps are.<br/>
<br/>
If your going to &quot;improve&quot; our class like this atleast give us one more<br/>
thing, dont let Harm Touch be resisted. Its a power from the gods after all,<br/>
I dont care how powerful you are unless your a god you shouldnt be able to<br/>
resist this power.<br/>
<br/>
And if you really want to help this less used class, make some shadow knight<br/>
only spells. A paladin can use clerical spells pretty well because a Paladin<br/>
is only a Cleric with a sword, now a Shadow Knights spells are from a PURE<br/>
CASTER class wich is kind of odd that we use their spells way after they<br/>
stop useing them their selves. A little more work is needed with the SK<br/>
Class to truly balance them out, your paying customers are speeking out so<br/>
you should listen (I see more complaints about SKs then any other class).<br/>
