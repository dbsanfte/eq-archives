<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834314577">i&#39;ve found out the hard way that the critters just inside rivervale are<br/>
rather big. the first sherrif you encounter can hit for in excess of 100<br/>
damage per hit (while this was when i was about lvl 7, i dont imagine his<br/>
damage will go down THAT much with chain armor). the only other way into<br/>
rivervale is to take a long detour and get to misty thicket, but if i hear<br/>
correctly there are several wandering and stationary guards there as well.<br/>
