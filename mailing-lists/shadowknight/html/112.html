<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146344514">a bloodclaw stiletto? sounds cool.. but also sounds like a piercing weapon<br/>
;( i know there must be some other SK only weapons about, since i now know<br/>
of THREE paladin holy weapons. any info on SK holy weapons other than<br/>
darkreavers (or if you find out how to get a darkreaver) let us know!<br/>
<br/>
grenix mucktail is a rare spawning gnoll, and he bears the rediculously<br/>
powerful polished granite tomahawk. as i have sworn never to reveal its<br/>
location, i can only tell you that you should look for where the mucktail<br/>
gnolls are :) (there are only 3 clans of gnolls in the entire game world, it<br/>
wont take you THAT long hehe)<br/>
<br/>
as far as guk.. a lvl 6 can fight the tads that spawn near the door, but<br/>
this is risky business since people tend to block off the exit with their<br/>
large ogreish and trollish bodies. my reccomendation is to leave it alone<br/>
until at least lvl 10 or 12 or so, so you can survive long enough to flee<br/>
when you see a train coming up the ramp.<br/>
