<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-704489958">Ok I&#39;ve seen screen shots of this armor in the past and noticed that it was<br/>
No Drop. I recently saw a picture of the Helm and noticed that it was not No<br/>
Drop. So is it just this piece that doesn&#39;t have the No Drop restriction or<br/>
have they removed it from all pieces?<br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion is that I would want all the pieces No Drop, that way we<br/>
don&#39;t have other classes harvesting the armor and also it&#39;s kind of like a<br/>
status symbol (You had to do the quest to get it). Of course as of yet I<br/>
haven&#39;t got any of the new armor (the whole camping Cazic thing doesn&#39;t have<br/>
me too excited)..<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy...<br/>
