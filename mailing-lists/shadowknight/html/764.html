<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293821269">While I like this idea (DE SK here), the Trolls and Ogres would scream<br/>
bloody  murder. I agree though the task of finding something that would<br/>
improve the DE/Humans but not overpower the Trolls/Ogres is near impossible.<br/>
Hmm didn&#39;t they just improve warriors?? Since they are made up of mixed<br/>
races what did they do to them, so that the larger races aren&#39;t overpowered?<br/>
 <br/>
So far here is how I see it.<br/>
 <br/>
Lifetap - Useless for the level we would get them (plus take away from the<br/>
damage I would be doing engaging the mob).<br/>
Harm Shields - Overbalancing for larger races and other classes have better<br/>
ones that are more effective anyway.<br/>
Additional Dot&#39;s - This might work (Give us back Boil blood and maybe Inf.<br/>
Cloud or something else).<br/>
Shields (Non Harm type - ala ShieldSkin) - At a lower level this would be<br/>
useful, also something past shield skin at the later levels.<br/>
ATK Enhancers - Would be nice..<br/>
 <br/>
Also what about criticals on 2hs?? Since the vast majority of SK&#39;s switch to<br/>
2handers at the later levels - I really liked how my MM shield and Cry.<br/>
Sword looked though..<br/>
 <br/>
Hmm..<br/>

The only thing I can think of that would make the small race SK more viable,<br/>
without making the large race SK more powerful would be the introduction of<br/>
a few SK only items. (+hp items, or whatever) that are medium small only. <br/>
I see no way to up class power for one race and not the other. Only by Item<br/>
that large races cannot wear, that are SK only, do I see the possibility. <br/>
