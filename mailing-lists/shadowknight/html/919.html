<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151596567">I generally carry a few around.  My primary weapon is the Dark Reaver.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t gotten around to trying a Flesh Ripper, but it sounds like it might <br/>
be fun.  If I&#39;m walking around for effect, I use the Reaper of the Dead.  It <br/>
tends to intimidate people more.  Otherwise I still like playing with my <br/>
blood claw, and the thulian claws just make me look like a mean biatch!<br/>
<br/>
But like I stated earlier, the DR is my most effective tool at the moment.<br/>

I was just curious what weapon/s other high level SK&#39;s like to use. I&#39;ve<br/>
found that the DR is my weapon of choice, but I do switch to the FleshRipper<br/>
when I&#39;m not to concerned about the AE getting me killed (A DD spell would<br/>
have made this weapon so much nicer). Also lately I&#39;ve found myself using a<br/>
Cryt. Sword and MM shield combo (just looks cool, with all the black and<br/>
silver plate). Any of you find any other weapons you like using (Thulian<br/>
claw, etc??)..<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy...<br/>
