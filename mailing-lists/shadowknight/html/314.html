This isnt a Bible discussion.<br/>
The description of Harm Touch should match exactly what its supposed to<br/>
do. Hidden messages and open interpretation writings have no place in<br/>
instruction manuals.<br/>
<br/>
And i personally dont mind how HT works now with only 1 use per<br/>
day..BUT its all-too-often failure against creatures you really need it<br/>
to work against makes it a weak &quot;special&quot; attack.<br/>
And it is definitely not even close to being the equal on LoH. And ,<br/>
yes, i am taking it literally that it is supposed to be its equal.<br/>
If its not equal, then our class isnt equal which means we are at a<br/>
distinct disadvantage in any PvP situation.<br/>
Then add in the rest of the Paladins spells versus ours. We&#39;re in<br/>
definite trouble.<br/>
Anything we can cast on them , if its not resisted, they can heal.<br/>
Anything they do to us, we&#39;re stuck with.<br/>
<br/>
The least they could do is make our HT more plausible.<br/>
LoH heals totally... no resisted problems.<br/>
HT does only 10dmg per level, but is resisted partially or totally on a<br/>
regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
If they added a lifetap funtion to this, i would have no complaints at<br/>
all, resisted issues and all.<br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Did you ever think about the fact that the harm<br/>
&gt; touch description could be<br/>
&gt; intended to be read in a non-literal fashion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree that HT is somewhat weak. Though im not sure<br/>
&gt; what to do about<br/>
&gt; it...I&#39;ve never had an HT resisted while fighting<br/>
&gt; creatures 8-10 levels<br/>
&gt; above me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Really, I&#39;d like to see HT as a constant<br/>
&gt; ability...One that decreases the<br/>
&gt; casters health and mana with each cast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
