<div id="ygrps-yiv-64939262">Poor Selection? Heehee. Interesting understatement. Humans especially. IE<br/>
why can&#39;t I use the Grobb Cleaver dangit? I have one sitting in my bank<br/>
right now and, goldarnit, it is annoying that I can&#39;t use it.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, why is there no way now for a Human SK to raise faction with<br/>
&quot;thedead&quot; the only way I knew how previously was to do the beetle eye quest<br/>
(I never actually got to try it before, see if I got laughed at or it<br/>
worked) but I was never able to get the box. Previously the box oculd be<br/>
given to me by a friend but now that it is no-drop there is no way for me to<br/>
raise faction.<br/>
<br/>
Any Human SK or any SK for that matter know of a way for me to raise my<br/>
faction with &quot;thedead&quot; I want to be liked in my guild but I still have to<br/>
invis-undead past the ghouls and I can&#39;t get any DE SK quests because I am<br/>
hated.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I&#39;m logging in to kill some pecks so the outside guards like me<br/>
more. :)<br/>
<br/>
see you all later,<br/>

So do you think that equipment quests are a viable alternative?  I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed that human (and DE?) SKs have a, uh, poor selection of quests =|<br/>
