<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130480097">NO. i&#39;ve heard numerous people bickering about this on SK message boards<br/>
too, and this is greed, not need. i know we are a frustrating class, but we<br/>
are HIGH DIFFICULTY after all. get yourself up to lvl 30 or so and you will<br/>
no longer care that you cant lifetap ;) besides, if they did give us<br/>
lifetap, what would it do? give us another 6 hp per zap? judging by our<br/>
other spells.. ;)<br/>
