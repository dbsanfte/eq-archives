I left Tunare almost 4 months ago due to the attitude you are talking<br/>
about.  I went to a different server.  There&#39;s no need to quit the game<br/>
over it.  Lots of servers have people with better attitudes.  And the<br/>
starting over isn&#39;t so bad -- I found levelling was much easier when I knew<br/>
how to play the character, and how to avoid newbie death.  Try another<br/>
server before quitting.  <br/>

According to the illustrious Chip Paul...<br/>
:)<br/>
:)I, myself, am leaving EQ, beacause I can&#39;t stand the majority of<br/>
:)the people on my server.  A druid and a level 50 warrior were tracking<br/>
:)down and killing all of the crusaders in cazic today so that they could<br/>
:)do the quests, and then try to find a way to trade the nodrop armor<br/>
:)to a low level twink.  She was not only doing this, but competing <br/>
:)with me in /auction for looting pieces.  Earlier, I gave the rogue<br/>
:)in my group the ravenscale legs without even doing a random, and she<br/>
:)wasn&#39;t even someone I knew.  Both Verant and the players on my<br/>
:)server have made it more of a chore to play than fun.<br/>
:)<br/>
:)So good luck everyone finding your armor, hope you live on a more<br/>
:)civil server than Tunare.<br/>
