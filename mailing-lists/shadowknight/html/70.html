<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716339921">Like all stats there appears to be a diminishing return after you hit 100. I<br/>
can&#39;t really confirm this, just something I heard.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you don&#39;t actually do more damages, there is just a higher probabtility<br/>
that you will do Maximum damage. Next time you are fighting with your friend, see<br/>
how often you hit for the maximum damage, compared to how often he does.<br/>

&gt; Hey guys,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         I was curious about strength.  What role does it truly play?<br/>
&gt; Obviously you can carry more, a big plus.  But what about combat?  I have<br/>
&gt; noticed that my ogre with 143 STR does the same damage as a friends high<br/>
&gt; elf with the same weapon and much lower strength.  Is this just because<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m am still relatively low leveled (8)?  Does the str bonus take effect<br/>
&gt; at higher levels?  Or is there a bonus at all?<br/>
