<div id="ygrps-yiv-526919847">does anybody know of monsters that can be killed (or quests to undertake)<br/>
that have a definite positive effect on the guards of grobb or oggok? i am a<br/>
human sk, and as such am prevented from entrance to these cities by the<br/>
hummie barshin&#39; guards :) i&#39;ve been trying to beat up large numbers of<br/>
frogloks, but that doesnt seem to affect the grobb guards any. any<br/>
suggestions would be helpful<br/>
