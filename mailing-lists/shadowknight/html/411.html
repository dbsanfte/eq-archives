<b>Subject:</b> ring of the dead..? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-440439155">ok, upon turning the thex mallet into loveal, did i get a ring of the<br/>
dead? no, i got a GODDAMN DEADEYE SCROLL! and to add injury to insult,<br/>
invis to undead wore off just as i was passing the ghouls on the way<br/>
out. argh.<br/>
<br/>
another person i know of who turned in the thex mallet got a sword that<br/>
basically amounts to a bronze 2h. whupdedoo.<br/>
<br/>
somebody please tell me its genuinely possible to get one of these damn<br/>
rings! or at least let me know the keyword to start the windstream<br/>
quest, since i am &quot;too powerful&quot; to start it myself ;p<br/>
