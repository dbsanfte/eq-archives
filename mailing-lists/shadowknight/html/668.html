<div id="ygrps-yiv-343363656">Wow, Brian Hook posting too our little email list, very cool.  Keep up the<br/>
good work Brian, you seem to be genuinely interested in the pulse of the<br/>
gamer and the state of EQ as a whole.  As far as web sites, several have<br/>
been listed on this list (if you check the archives, you can find them<br/>
pretty easily).  But, even these sites are rather preliminary and<br/>
incomplete.  For quests, the best place to look is Allakhazams web site<br/>
under the regular quest locations for SK&#39;s (i.e. Grobb, Ogguk, Neriak, FP,<br/>
Qeynos, Southern Karanas, etc.)  For strategies and tactics, check out the<br/>
EQ Stratics SK board.  Pay special close attention to any posts by Beld<br/>
Demonblade (that guy KNOWS what he is talking about).<br/>
<br/>
I can relate what info I know and have heard from other SK&#39;s.  This is<br/>
pretty standard for any non-twinked character.  Basically, when you reach<br/>
the highest level of the range, you should have all of the equipment listed.<br/>
This is for the 2H Slashing SK&#39;s which are most common.  Others use Piercing<br/>
or 1H Slashing, but I don&#39;t know which weapons they are using.<br/>
<br/>
Levels 15-20:<br/>
<br/>
Weapon:  Grobb Cleaver, Brutechopper, Shiny Brass Halberd, or Bone Bladed<br/>
Claymore<br/>
Armor:  Banded or Blackened Iron with some misc. stat enhancing armor mixed<br/>
in (Barbed from Befallen, Spiked stuff from Blackburrow, LJ vest, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Levels 21-30:<br/>
<br/>
Weapon:  Blackened Iron Bastard Sword or Gigantic Zweihander<br/>
Armor:  Bronze with misc stat enhancing armor mixed in<br/>
<br/>
Levels 31-40:<br/>
<br/>
Weapon:  Dark Reaver<br/>
Armor:  Anything better than bronze (steel, rubi, mithril, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Levels 41-50:<br/>
<br/>
Weapon:  Dark Reaver or better (what&#39;s after it?)<br/>
Armor:  Beyond your wildest dreams (Plane of Fear stuff, I guess)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Scragg Wraithbone of Bristlebane (22nd level TSK)<br/>

Is there a Web site that lists all the quests and strategies that SKs of the<br/>
difference races can perform and for what?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also specifically curious about what kind of gear a typical SK is<br/>
wielding through his/her career starting from about 15th to<br/>
50th.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Brian<br/>
