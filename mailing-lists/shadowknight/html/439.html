<div id="ygrps-yiv-39397307">Okies thanks fer help on freeport sk guild question just got one more <br/>
question for you. I have realized how great archery can be expecially with <br/>
our pets but when I went to use a tiny dagger as it uses archery skill though <br/>
in the melee spot I couldnt equip it. So am I doing something wrong or did <br/>
Verant change it so you cant use it anymore? Id really like to use it if <br/>
possibe as getting it up with arrows will be time consuming and expensive.<br/>
