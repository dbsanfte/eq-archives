 </span></blockquote>Also, I&#39;m 38 now, and I can tell you that taunt won&#39;t go up after level 30,<br/>
dodge and parry don&#39;t go up after 35 (don&#39;t know the skill number thing<br/>
though -- 150 and 175/175 respectively?). Offense, defense, 2HS, and double<br/>
attack are all still rising though, along with spell skills.<br/>
