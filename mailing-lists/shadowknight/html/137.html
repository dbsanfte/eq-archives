<div id="ygrps-yiv-150513844">I really couldn&#39;t tell you how the class is power wise all the way up.  I<br/>
had thought we would be one of the most powerfull....eventually. You&#39;re<br/>
arguement gave me something to think about now and to watch for.  Thats<br/>
the whole reason I am sticking it out.  As a DE I earn exp slow...as a SK<br/>
i earn it even slower.  The two slowest growing exp hounds are SK&#39;s and<br/>
Trolls.  Humans are supposed to earn exp the quickest basically...but then<br/>
intelligence and class are also factored in.  <br/>
<br/>
Even if the SK is underpowered...its still a blast to play...and I think<br/>
eventually will be a powerfull class, especially if they enhance our spell<br/>
list a little bit.  They think the HT power increases us so much...but it<br/>
really doesn&#39;t.  Its something like every 45 or 1 hour and 45 minutes i<br/>
can really blast a critter...but the rest of the time I&#39;m a weak warrior.<br/>
The paladin is more of a warrior than us...and has healing to boot.  I<br/>
think our warrior part should be boosted...and maybe our spell list<br/>
enhanced...then you will see power.  <br/>
<br/>
As for SK&#39;s being weak...well only time will tell.  I read a poll recently<br/>
where the two most popular race/class combos were human paladins and DE<br/>
SK&#39;s.  Wait a few more months and see how many SK&#39;s are still in the<br/>
lands....that will tell you surely how well they fare at later levels.<br/>
