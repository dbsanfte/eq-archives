<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601015178">My mind wandered with this one so be warned. <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Graham, I have been thinking about Unrest for a <br/>
while now, but... Does Unrest give negative faction hits <br/>
with any of the Nerco/Evil guilds that I will need to <br/>
keep high in my later career?<br/>
My major problem with leaving Antonica for Faydwer is <br/>
that my lag is so bad for crossing zones (2-2.5 minutes) <br/>
most times that I miss being able to get off the boat at <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>

This has happened to me literally so that for 2 hours I <br/>
was stuck on that damn boat. I only got off the boat <br/>
because I petitioned a GM who pulled me off with that <br/>
very nice... <br/>
&quot;YOU have been SUMMONED by the gods, prepare yourself!&quot;<br/>
First time though that jerk of a GM said I needed to be <br/>
in the same zone. But I wanted to be in Freeport and was <br/>
on my way to BB having just missed the zone.  When he <br/>
realized how long he would need to wait for me to return <br/>
on the boat &quot;miraculously&quot; he was able to summon me from <br/>
OOT.<br/>
ANYWAY...<br/>
I also dread a teleport to Faydwer for the same reason. <br/>
I have no idea what NPCs hang around wizard teleport <br/>
rings.  I doubt I will ever use a Druidic Succor for <br/>
obvious reasons.  My wife&#39;s Bard worships Veeshan, and <br/>
when teleported to the Druidic ring in the Karanas she <br/>
was KoSed.  With my lag I would never see that I am <br/>
being attacked, just the &quot;Returning to home point...&quot; <br/>
message.<br/>
<br/>
Someone told me that getting more RAM would fix my lag <br/>
problems and that it may not be my 3d card. Anyone know <br/>
PCs well enough to respond on this? Thanks.<br/>
