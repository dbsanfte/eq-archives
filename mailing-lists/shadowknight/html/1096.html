<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176653197">granted i am only lvl 11, so these ideas might be really bad at high levels.<br/>
<br/>
i was thinking about Brian&#39;s comment about why they won&#39;t change the resist rate on HT.  if 6 sks used HT all at once, that would be a lot of damage done to a mob, especially if it was a rare spawn.  what if HT was changed from dd to dot?  the total damage could be upped to 15 or 20 * lvl, and it could do 5*lvl dd, then the rest could be dot over 1-2 minutes.  the resist rate could be lowered, and damage would be increased.  the only problem that i see is it would be less useful in emergency situations, because it would not do as much damage right away, and so could not kill a mob as quickly if you are about to die.  do people think this would be an improvement or a nerf?<br/>
<br/>
my other idea would be to create an sk only spell, that is like vampiric embrace.  it would be hand damage only, so no weapon.  it would be much harder or impossible to resist the damage, but each hit would take mana.  this way it could only be used for a little bit of time, like 1-3 min., before oom.  would people find that useful?<br/>

Verrate Mich nicht<br/>
Oh siehst Du nicht die Brucke brennt<br/>
Hor auf zu schreien und wehr Dich nict<br/>
Weil Sie sonst auseinander bricht<br/>
