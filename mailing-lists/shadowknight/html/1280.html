Yep.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t tend to have a lot of time these days for extra-curricular EQ<br/>
activities (ie EQ is fun but losing its luster so I don&#39;t use free time as<br/>
much to do EQ-stuff. =D) but I still play.<br/>
<br/>
According to onelist we still have 116 members, who knows how many of those<br/>
are/were email addies made just for the list though.<br/>
<br/>
So how is everyone doing? How many of you have reached 50 these days?<br/>
<br/>
Personally, Virten is still chugging along rp&#39;ing first, getting exp second,<br/>
and just got level 36. And yes I&#39;ve been playing since release.<br/>
<br/>
How about anyone else? Got anything to share?<br/>
<br/>
