<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148283855">Although the lifetap line would be nice, and I wouldn&#39;t complain, <br/>
there are two issues I think are more important:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Base pet aggro on the level of the owner, and not on the level of<br/>
the pet.  There would be fewer complaints if the green training and<br/>
lion attacks would stop.  Then, regardless of power, the pet would<br/>
be useful in more situations.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Harm touch should never be resisted on even and under cons, and <br/>
should continue to be useful up to about 3-4 levels above us.  I know<br/>
that we can&#39;t have a dozen SK&#39;s wiping out griffons at 20th level, but<br/>
sometimes, especially at lower levels, it just gets ludicrous.<br/>
<br/>
I just wish I could fight a rook/avocet without a lion/wolf/puma<br/>
distracting my pet, and rely on my harm touch when soloing a <br/>
reasonable opponent.  (Blues resisting and me dying is just silly)<br/>
