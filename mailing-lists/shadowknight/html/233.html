<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437726317">OK, one more penny.<br/>
<br/>
If this is such a tough class of character to play (as I have seen this<br/>
written), shouldn&#39;t we get a benefit for playing that character and since we<br/>
can&#39;t go to that many cities without the KoS worry, such as a paladin elf<br/>
class character can (I have never played a paladin elf class, so I maybe<br/>
wrong) shouldn&#39;t we get some kind of consideration (i.e. bind spell).<br/>
<br/>
OK, now I&#39;m broke.<br/>

Allright, lets do this in detail.<br/>
My guildmate and i had  friendly duel. He was a 18th level Halfling Druid I<br/>
myslef was a 17th level Dark Elf Shadowknight. He had full leather and a<br/>
screaming mace. I had a shiny brass halberd, Full bronze Platemail, 110 str<br/>
after siphoning. He rooted me and blasted me with a spell doing 37 pts a<br/>
turn and Stinging swarm. I got the joy of casting my three spells at him<br/>
until i was un rooted and harm touched him. The harm touch did HALF a bubble<br/>
YES HALF. after he was taxed. Now at melee. My halberd was doing about one<br/>
to twenty nine pints of damage. at one time in the duel, I did one point of<br/>
damage three times in a row. Also, 75% of my spells were laughed off. the<br/>
only good thing i did in my fight was dodge and parry quite often(helps to<br/>
be a dark elf fer that). Well thats about that. Rather embarrasing and<br/>
disheartening. In beta I played a warrior and never lost a battle.<br/>
