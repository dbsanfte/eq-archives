<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742094683">Had the same problem when my SK hit lvl 14 or so.. At that time I started a<br/>
Wizard and a Ranger played them for a while (Rngr is 18, Wiz is 11) then<br/>
went back to the SK.. I would suggest to play the Druid for a while but<br/>
don&#39;t dump the SK, maybe you just need a break from it for a while...<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy...<br/>

I am starting to have that itch again.  I think I am not <br/>
enjoying my Troll anymore.  Since I started playing my <br/>
Druid, I dread getting on as my troll. But I can&#39;t put <br/>
my finger on why. I haven&#39;t played Cronik in a week or <br/>
so.<br/>
I have /played my Druid for &lt;14 hours and am 2 bubs into <br/>
6th level.  I guess I have learned how to level rather <br/>
quickly with my class of choice.  This may be slow to <br/>
some, but for me it is astronomically fast.<br/>
I am in the middle of a mental debate on whether or not <br/>
to scrap him, sell everything, run to my druid, die and <br/>
leave him a big inheritance.<br/>
Anyone else run into this problem of character ping-pong?<br/>
Things at home are also very stressed, so that isn&#39;t <br/>
helping either.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
