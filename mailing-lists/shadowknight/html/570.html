&gt; Any good SK webpages out there?<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not really any good ones, but Soerbaird.com, who hosts the<br/>
Shaman&#39;s Crucible (an awesome shaman site), is branching off<br/>
to each of the other classes, and I am contributing alot of info<br/>
to them to get the SK part up.  I&#39;ve sent in a complete spell and<br/>
skill list, and an in-depth spell guide for the first three ranks.<br/>
I will likely have 2 other guides done before he can get the site<br/>
ready, and those will be Using your Pet, and a general SK tactics<br/>
guide.  I am debating about the quests I know about.  Perhaps I <br/>
will compile a list of quests, and how to get started, but not<br/>
a full spoiler, but maybe not.<br/>
