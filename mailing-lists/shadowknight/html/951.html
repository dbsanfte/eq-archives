<div id="ygrps-yiv-765017446">it worked like a charm :) i am now indifferent to the inhabitants of<br/>
mistmoore castle (warmly if affected by wolf form.. yay!) and can freely<br/>
explore the place :) that said, does anybody know where the maid and butler<br/>
can be found inside? not that i will kill them personally.. i&#39;ll just know<br/>
where to lead my friends to so they can camp the teeth for me ;) hehe...<br/>
<br/>
sadly xicotl or lord mistmoore didnt pop up while i was there, but if i<br/>
happen to get screenshots at a later date i&#39;ll be sure to let you folks know.<br/>
