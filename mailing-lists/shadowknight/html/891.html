<div id="ygrps-yiv-168605542"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Seems dodge capped at level 25<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, looking back over my logs ... I show no record of Dodge going up at all<br/>
in any of them. They go back to skill of 120. The last time I updated my<br/>
char sheet it was at 115 skill. So it caps at either 22 or 23 it would seem.<br/>
Anyone have independent confirmation of this?<br/>
<br/>
As for the other skills, they all seem to be going still at 26.</div>
