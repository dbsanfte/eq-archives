 <br/>
I would love to see some nice quest items. Especially other black armor<br/>
(besides Umbral, which I still can&#39;t get). I&#39;m using a combo of Crested,<br/>
Rubi and Charred now, and while the Red, Silver and Black looks good I&#39;d<br/>
like to be in full black plate (especially if it only fits small races and<br/>
gives STR, DEX and AGI bonuses). You could give the Trolls/Ogres specialty<br/>
plate as well but make it give Int bonuses. If you think about it Warriors<br/>
just got a armor quest (very nice stuff btw), so it wouldn&#39;t be that<br/>
unfeasible for the SK&#39;s to get some.<br/>
 <br/>
Also something other than the DR or Fleshripper would be nice, (I have to go<br/>
with the DR mainly since the the FR has that AE spell which seems to just<br/>
help me piss off everything in a 10 sq mile radius).<br/>

So do you think that equipment quests are a viable alternative?  I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed that human (and DE?) SKs have a, uh, poor selection of quests =|<br/>
