<b>Subject:</b> Finally Some Upgrades! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-746800771">Well it looks like Verant is finally listening to the calls of the all SK&#39;s<br/>
out there.<br/>
Our final pet, which was originally Haunting Corpse, has been upgraded to<br/>
Summon Dead, which is simply a higher-level pet.<br/>
Another of our final spells, Word of Shadow has been upgraded to Word of<br/>
Spirit, try and complain about that one :)<br/>
The final change is up to some debate at least for now, we gain a brand new<br/>
spell called Shadow Vortex, replacing Intensify Death. Until we know if<br/>
Shadow Vortex is &quot;better&quot; than Intensify Death, there&#39;s not much we can say<br/>
here, except that certainly sounds cool.<br/>
Note also from the last patch, that Boil Blood is replaced with Dooming<br/>
Darkness (not terrible, but probably not an upgrade, although it does seem<br/>
fair, as someone pointed out a while ago, that someone who can melee the<br/>
hell out of you shouldn&#39;t be able to have an extremely fast DoT spell as<br/>
well), and that Banshee Aura has been replaced with ShieldSkin (kind of an<br/>
interesting tradeoff, lose a spell that causes damage to the enemy when it<br/>
hits you, to gain a spell that causes them to do less damage when hitting<br/>
you).<br/>
Now if only they&#39;d add a decent SK-only 1H weapon...</div>
