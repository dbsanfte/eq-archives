<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403503417">the fact of the matter is, sk are bad asses...<br/>
Hard to play? ermm, better step back and try a necro or something....<br/>
My wife ogre started level one fri night at 6 pm, she was level 7 at 11 am<br/>
the next morning, killing froglocks non stop, she made level 10 last<br/>
night....<br/>
ermm, everything i read says sk come into there own at higher levels...<br/>
looks like to me they pretty damn tough at lower levels, and as for leveling<br/>
slowly...heh, not!<br/>

&gt; I must say that a massive Feedback campaign is not the way to go. I would<br/>
try<br/>
&gt; to email Verant with a well written letter, and cross post it to the<br/>
message<br/>
&gt; boards as well as the major web pages. If all this doesn&#39;t work, it would<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; understandable if you went to greater length to be heard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, I don&#39;t think there are any issues to be raised. I fully<br/>
comprehended<br/>
&gt; when it told me my character would be Hard to play, and that is half the<br/>
&gt; challenge of it. Sure it is a pain in the arse, but until you start to<br/>
enjoy<br/>
&gt; your character for what it is and what it can do, you will never enjoy EQ.<br/>
It<br/>
&gt; is pointless compareing yourself to other characters and wishing you had<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; they had. To be perfectely honest, I beleive I have no equal in combat at<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; level other then another SK, and i am only lvl 14. I have had this belief<br/>
&gt; since I was level 8 and beat the crap out of a lvl 9 monk. I still beleive<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; can do the same against every other class.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, it sounds like people are interested in trying something.  We need<br/>
&gt; &gt; to:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1.      Come up with a couple common things that we want addressed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2.      Have 1 day where everyone gets on and /feedbacks them either the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same statement or a statement containing identical issues.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So how many people are on this list?  How many are willing to<br/>
participate?<br/>
&gt; &gt; And when do we want to do it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oogog<br/>
