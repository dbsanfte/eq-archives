<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896439979">I need to go to the Mining co. in solusek a to get some deufrite or something like that. (cant remember exact name, am at work). Do I buy this? If  so, who is gonna sell it to an ogre SK? I am wondering about this part of the quest, anyone who has info to share on how to obtain this quest item please let me know. I have never walked in this dungeon, and dont see my ogre strolling through gnome time asking for it..<br/>
If i do not buy it, who do i kill to get it? I am level 30 btw..<br/>
Thanx<br/>
