<div id="ygrps-yiv-26976271">Quick problem with walking around sucking the life out of things after a<br/>
fight.. hehe do that in L. Guk and you&#39;ll won&#39;t have to worry about waiting<br/>
to heal as you will be coming back to your spawn point fairly quickly..<br/>
(with full health I might add).<br/>
<br/>
Also considering that any lifetap we get would be so low in level it&#39;s not<br/>
going to make a dent in my 1000+ hp&#39;s. At least with VE I don&#39;t have to<br/>
worry about it, just cast it as the puller is incoming and let it do it&#39;s<br/>
thing. <br/>
<br/>
Oh and Shadow Step is one of my most used spells in PVP. Really pisses off<br/>
other melee classes if you keep bouncing around Dot&#39;ing them (Plus a nice<br/>
bow).<br/>
<br/>
Just give us a good old fashioned Armageddon spell that kills everything in<br/>
site and I&#39;ll be happy :)<br/>

You are correct, the damage shields were far too powerful if put on a big SK<br/>
(ogre/troll).  Your comments about Shadow Step are interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Lifetap/spike/draw would be used near the end of a melee in a group -- you<br/>
could use it as a quick heal to minimize downtime.<br/>
<br/>
And personally, it has always been my idea that an SK feeds off the life<br/>
force of the weak, so after a fight walking around and sucking the life out<br/>
of gnolls and orcs sounds very in character...<br/>
