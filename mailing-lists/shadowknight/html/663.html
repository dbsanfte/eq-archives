<div id="ygrps-yiv-855647016">Somehow my email program burped and I lost your reply <br/>
Countess.....<br/>
Anyway, I can&#39;t remember what I have already sent, so I <br/>
will just pick a start point.<br/>
The last time I was in Freeport surface world was over 3 <br/>
weeks ago. Last time I was in the Slums of the surface <br/>
was 2 months ago.  <br/>
I was talking to my wife about this and when you brought <br/>
up the 2 Opals I may have blurred 2 different topics <br/>
together.<br/>
In the Slums of East Freeport, behind the leather <br/>
shop/town wall, (I think I said West last time, sorry) <br/>
my wife said there is a Dark Elf Opal Darkbriar behind <br/>
one of the buildings, though she is not sure which one.  <br/>
<br/>
Could you repost the Opals that you know the locations <br/>
of? ie the HE Enchanter in Arcane Science is a <br/>
definate.  Now I am fuzzy on where you said the other <br/>
Opal is.   I don&#39;t have the thread that lead up to this, <br/>
and can&#39;t remember if you said the 2nd Opal was a Human <br/>
in the sewers by the other guild leaders, or if it was <br/>
the DE on the surface in the Slums of East Feerport. <br/>
There may be no 3rd Opal.  :)<br/>
The objet in the room I was thinking of happened at the <br/>
same time that my wife and I noticed 2 differant Opals <br/>
and I may have put them together by association.  The <br/>
object was an incomplete vent pipe and steam in the <br/>
upper floor of the forge house (I think Groflah&#39;s <br/>
Forge?) that was in the slum area of East Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
I am very sorry for any wasted time you spent on my <br/>
earlier post.  I hate Freeport anyway since my PC always <br/>
locks up when I enter it.  West Freeport is the worst <br/>
because of the Arcane science building, followed by East <br/>
Freeport because of the boat.  North Freeport never <br/>
locks me up.  The Bank in Neriak slows me down because <br/>
of the magic guild next to it and all the spells going <br/>
off.<br/>
This leads me to a new thread, coming soon to your <br/>
mailbox. :)<br/>
