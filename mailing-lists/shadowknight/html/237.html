<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095510276">there are 3 major routes across the continent between Qeynos and Freeport:<br/>
you can go thru the gorge of king xorbb, which passes rivervale, but this is<br/>
a rather unpleasant trip for evil folk. you can go thru highpass, which<br/>
while maybe a bit more dangerous if you are under lvl 20, is both faster<br/>
than the gorge route AND doesnt involve npcs that are KoS to shadowknights.<br/>
both of these routes end up in kithicor forest, and if you continue past<br/>
this you get to the west commonlands. befallen is in this zone, along the<br/>
southern zone wall. it appears as a small cave near the base of the mountain<br/>
(with a large dune in front of it), and if you approach it at night, it glows.<br/>
<br/>
the third route is to go to south karana, past the aviak villiage, and enter<br/>
lake rathetear. from here you can go to the mountains of rathe to feerrott<br/>
jungle to innothule swamp. guk is in the swamp, about halfway along the<br/>
eastern zone wall. while i know this route exists, i have never gotten<br/>
around to passing this way myself, and i&#39;ve heard that the mountains are<br/>
HUGE. however, i&#39;m fairly certain that it would be quicker to take this path<br/>
to guk than to go thru kithicor and freeport if you are headed there from<br/>
qeynos. on the way to guk, you will pass both the ogre and troll cities, as<br/>
well as the lost temple of cazic-thule in feerrott (a mid to high level<br/>
dungeon where you can obtain some very nice loot). the main problem this<br/>
poses to human shadowknights is that neither the ogres or trolls will let us<br/>
in, and the nearest bind point to guk for us is freeport. in the cases of<br/>
both befallen and guk, it&#39;d be safer for you to temporarily move to freeport<br/>
as a base until you are done with both dungeons. the only other alternative<br/>
is to remain bound to qeynos and hope somebody there has a spirit of the<br/>
wolf free should the unexpected happen.. which it will, as both dungeons<br/>
have high train traffic.<br/>
