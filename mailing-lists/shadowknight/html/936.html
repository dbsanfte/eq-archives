&gt; This of course is only a suggestion and most likely<br/>
&gt; never be implemented. But here it goes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How about weapons and armor granted to those of<br/>
&gt; specific deities. For instance, not only is the<br/>
&gt; Pestilence Scythe for WAR,SHD,NEC, but it is for<br/>
&gt; worshippers of Bertoxxulous only.<br/>
&gt; Sure SKs and Necros of other deities can cast all the<br/>
&gt; same spells, but worshippers of Bertoxx have a special<br/>
&gt; relationship with death and disease. They should have<br/>
&gt; exclusive rights to this type of a weapon.<br/>
&gt; Why should a warrior of Tunare have access to the<br/>
&gt; Pestilence Scythe?They are supposed to abhore that<br/>
&gt; type of power.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>

that prevent something like this.<br/>
