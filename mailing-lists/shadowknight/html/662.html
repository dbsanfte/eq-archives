<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-492194680"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There is a third place Opal Darkbriar spawns which<br/>
&gt; is in <br/>
&gt; the Slums of West Freeport on the second floor of<br/>
&gt; one of <br/>
&gt; the buildings.  She is usually under a minor<br/>
&gt; Illusion <br/>
&gt; spell and looks like a locked chest (i think). In<br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; form, Hails do nothing, and I have no clue how to<br/>
&gt; get <br/>
&gt; her to drop the illusion. Anyone else see this?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I saw this message I went through every building<br/>
i could find not only West FP, but North as well,<br/>
clicking on every piece of furniture :)<br/>
<br/>
Well, no luck. Does anyone have any idea which<br/>
building it is she spawns in, and whether she is<br/>
always there, as her other 2 counterparts are in their<br/>
spot?<br/>
<br/>
The DE (in the underground)and HE (in the Arcane<br/>
Science Building) versions are both Guildmasters and<br/>
dont seem to leave their spots. But this 3rd one is<br/>
hidden in the slums of a town under an illusion. There<br/>
must be a reason why, and i want to know what it is.<br/>
Besides, a traitor to any good aligned faction is<br/>
someone i want to meet.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated<br/>
