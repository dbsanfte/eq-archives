<div id="ygrps-yiv-657982975">I believe 1 point is plent to put into dodge at first.  It goes up very quickly if you&#39;re a dark elf, and halfway through level 9 I had topped it off.  It seems like it fills up very quickly with each of my new levels, and works pretty often when fighting.  I&#39;m very glad to have this skill, think about it, you could potentially be completely avoiding an attack that would cause you to lose the battle, and that&#39;s not interrupting your AC, so when you dodge, you know they hit you, and you got lucky.  <br/>
