<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439612600">Well, it sounds like people are interested in trying something.  We need<br/>
to:<br/>
<br/>
1.	Come up with a couple common things that we want addressed.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Have 1 day where everyone gets on and /feedbacks them either the<br/>
same statement or a statement containing identical issues.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So how many people are on this list?  How many are willing to participate?<br/>
And when do we want to do it?<br/>
<br/>
