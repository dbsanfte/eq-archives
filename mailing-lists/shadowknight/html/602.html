The kiting fix has nothing to do with range. <br/>
Essentially, DoT spells do not damage the NPC if the NPC <br/>
is chasing you and has a velocity. If he is not moving <br/>
or he is fleeing from you, the DoT does damage. <br/>
<br/>
IF we make this change live, and that&#39;s an IF at this <br/>
point, we will most likely also slightly increase the <br/>
durations of DoT spells to compensate for the additional <br/>
time necessary to cast the spells and then set up your <br/>
defense (you tanking, another player tanking, a pet <br/>
tanking, etc). <br/>

Keep in mind that this seems to have gone live already <br/>
from reports (see article below). Supposedly this is <br/>
meant to be a kiting fix, meaning if you are fleeing <br/>
from a monster it won&#39;t take damage but if the monster <br/>
flees from you it will. The reports I have in so far <br/>
basically say if the monster is out of your melee range <br/>
it takes no damage. It could just be a bit of buggy code <br/>
right now, but what Brad outlines above could certainly <br/>
be fully implemented come next patch meaning no more <br/>
kiting. <br/>

 DOT SPELL CHANGE - LIVE ON ALL SERVERS? <br/>
I have had two separate reports now that NPC&#39;s are not <br/>
taking DoT damage once out of the melee range on the <br/>
public servers. This means the DoT change is not just a <br/>
test server thing. It has gone live. I will do some <br/>
further testing tonight, but in the meantime don&#39;t rely <br/>
on your DoT&#39;s if the monsters does a runner on you. <br/>
