<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756672752">I think a level 50 SK can kill any other lvl 50 simply becuase they have a pet<br/>
that would  tip the balance. Going up against a Warrior would be the easiest of<br/>
all, since at the start of the battle he will be weakened, Diseases, have HP<br/>
stolen  have a pet banging on the back of his head, and if worse come to worse,<br/>
the SK can just shadow step and shoot arrows until he is dead.<br/>

&gt; i completely agree, i would personally like to sit down with the game<br/>
&gt; balance programmers and get THEIR explainations of how paladins and SK are<br/>
&gt; evenly matched. however, i think i can understand a few possible reasons why<br/>
&gt; things are as they are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ok, so at lvl 9 a paladin could probably beat up a lvl 9 sk good, on account<br/>
&gt; of the paladin has 3 times normal hp (due to all the healing), whereas we<br/>
&gt; get a spell that bites him for 5 damage and suck away some of his str. but<br/>
&gt; eventually i think we accelerate in power faster than paladins.. by the time<br/>
&gt; we get to lvl 50 in our best equipment, we would be fully capable of beating<br/>
&gt; the snot out of a lvl 50 paladin in his best equipment. (also, we dont have<br/>
&gt; to kill the lava dragon for a darkreaver ;)) upon checking back to the guild<br/>
&gt; periodically i have seen a great many necro spells being imped for SK use at<br/>
&gt; high level, including some of the powerful DOT spells, spirit armor, and<br/>
&gt; expulse undead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; also, while i admit that HT vs lay on hands isnt very fair, remember that HT<br/>
&gt; IS rather powerful. most melee combat classes cant boast the ability to<br/>
&gt; knock off a third or a half of their target&#39;s life with a single attack and<br/>
&gt; still be able to go ahead and wail away with nasty implements of pointy<br/>
&gt; death. my suggestion is not to boost HT, but to TONE DOWN lay on hands. the<br/>
&gt; ability to heal that much is just not reasonable; altho i have heard of<br/>
&gt; people having lay on hands interrupted, while it is not possible to<br/>
&gt; interrupt HT that i have seen, it being instantaneous. can anyone confirm<br/>
&gt; the possibility of lay on hands to be interrupted?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; there is a very good reason why HT can be resisted: imagine about 20 lvl 10<br/>
&gt; sk all charge a griffin and simultaneously lay a harm touch on it, causing<br/>
&gt; it to die instantly. now somebody is going to get a crapload of xp out of<br/>
&gt; that, and it&#39;d be a hideously unfair trick for us. even more lame than the<br/>
&gt; little bard accelerando-run in circles-bellow thing! i admit i become quite<br/>
&gt; annoyed seeing HT resisted or soaked altogether, but i try very hard not to<br/>
&gt; fight things that are guaranteed to resist it when it can be helped anyway :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; now, if only they will figure out why we and paladins cant hit worth a damn,<br/>
&gt; i think both classes are fully toe to toe with most other classes for the<br/>
&gt; better part of the game. i still think it&#39;d be a bad idea to duel a lvl 50<br/>
&gt; wizard with an SK, but the again, who COULD? :)<br/>
