<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492991109">Last Night, I handed in a box of kerra isle beetle<br/>
eyes and a mammoth tusk from everfrost and i completed<br/>
the quest. I get a message that i think might have to<br/>
do with your level so you can&#39;t get the next quest<br/>
until your a certain level or i jsut don&#39;t know<br/>
exactly what to say. I am gonna type out the paragraph<br/>
he says after i complete the quest and any suggestions<br/>
on what to say would be great!  Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Excelent work young one. You are sure to be an asset<br/>
to our faction. Lets see if we can help you on your<br/>
journey to power.I believe this can be of assistance<br/>
to a young necromancer of [The Dead].<br/>
<br/>
Well thats it...oh yeah and also the reward i got<br/>
forthe mammoth tusk and beetle eye quest was the level<br/>
22sk spell engulfing darkness so i think i did this<br/>
quest at the right time at least seeing as how i am<br/>
level 22. Well if anyone has any info or suggestions<br/>
that would be GREAT.<br/>
