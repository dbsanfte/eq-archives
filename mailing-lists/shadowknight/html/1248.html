<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841265003">To see exactly how the nerf of FD messed over Monks, visit the monk onelist<br/>
page and sift the archives from this weekend.<br/>
My wife was part of the 290+ PvP monks that caused Verant to shut off access<br/>
to the West Freeport zone and lock out the PoD near the Pier.  Every monk<br/>
present sent in a /Petition about the FD nerf and wanting it changed back.<br/>
The admins probably went nuts seeing 290 /petitions light up the screens all<br/>
at once!  Then Smedley came on and said they would look at FD again. The<br/>
gathering also crashed the zone once. Heh, just like a GM event, only the<br/>
Players had control. There were also close to 3000 people on Fennin Ro that<br/>
night as well. This may have come close to server capasity, and sent a<br/>
&quot;WTF?&quot; thought through quite a few heads.<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me. If you really want to get Verant&#39;s attention for SK nerfs<br/>
and issues, people from all servers need to meet at one server like the<br/>
monks did. That got Verant&#39;s attention better than one person petitioning or<br/>
/feedback over and over because it involved realtime resources (the 290<br/>
/petitions, and crashing the zone) that caused alot of headaches for the<br/>
Verant staff. Send them an email with alot of signitures and they notice it<br/>
and pass it up.  Crash the zone and alarms go off all the way to the top.<br/>
Every manager, team lead, and VP will want to know everything about the<br/>
incident, and will want it fixed as fast as possible. Their jobs depend on<br/>
it. You want a change and to have Verant look at it now? Get organized, and<br/>
do it on Fennin Ro. Fennin Ro is their biggest server and will give them the<br/>
biggest headache.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I will get off my soap box now.<br/>

&gt; you couldn&#39;t possibly have - and believe that this new fd system is &quot;more&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i for one KNOW how fd worked before (the verant posted is complete bs, a<br/>
&gt; blatant lie) and i know how it works now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course I used FD before the patch. I pull better than most monks, and I&#39;m<br/>
just an SK. I was trained by a monk (THE premiere monk on Fennin) and I know<br/>
how to feign, believe me. My point was not whether the new FD was better or<br/>
worse, I refuse to go down that road. I&#39;m telling you how it is NOW, after<br/>
the fact. You can use that information or you can bitch and moan. I was<br/>
trying to give you some advice on how the new FD is best used, even in its<br/>
&quot;nerfed&quot; state, and you insult me. I guess I&#39;ll just go back to lurking on<br/>
the list, sorry to post.<br/>
