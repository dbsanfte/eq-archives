 I spoke with our magic system designer and he does not believe those spells <br/>
(Infectious cloud, Spirit Armor, and Augment Death) are<br/>
 supposed to be for Shadow Knights and thus might be a data entry error.  <br/>
He&#39;s double checking these.<br/>
 <br/>
 I&#39;m also talking to him about possibly changing some other aspects of SKs to <br/>
make them more viable in the low/mid-levels.<br/>
 <br/>
 One problem that SKs face -- and one of the reasons that they are so <br/>
difficult to play -- is that they were tuned on the assumption<br/>
 that you would be playing an Ogre or Troll.  As such, human SKs are quite <br/>
possibly the second most difficult class/race combination<br/>
 in the game to play (after Erudite Paladin).<br/>
