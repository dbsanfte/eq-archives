<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087307757">I did some grouping with some magicians in lavastorm around that level.<br/>
They are usually there as they do great damage to the elementals.  If you<br/>
can find a cleric there, even better.  There seems to be a LOT of creatures<br/>
running around there.<br/>
<br/>
the named orc drops the backpack that reduces weight and an idol that has 1<br/>
charge of divine aura, does anyone know if it will recharge itself?  The<br/>
scalps you give to somone in HH and get exp/faction.  Unfortunatly I haven&#39;t<br/>
killed enough orcs and gotten a decent faction.<br/>
<br/>
Little tip, I would sit in the orc spawn and cast darkness or sap str, on<br/>
every orc I could.  I wouldn&#39;t get the exp, but I would get a faction hit<br/>
for every one.  This might have changed a little as this morning the sap<br/>
str, din&#39;t seem to give me the message.  something to try if you want to<br/>
safely go through HH.<br/>

&gt; Well, I was wondering what to fight when level 15?  I have been hunting<br/>
&gt; Young Kodies, and weak Kodies in west commons but find the<br/>
&gt; respawn rate bad.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for HH, I attacked some named orc just out side of hh pass, loc -500<br/>
&gt; 4300, somewhere around their just watch out for the village, and someone<br/>
&gt; told me that he was like killing 10 orcs in high hold pass, for<br/>
&gt; just killing<br/>
&gt; him.  He coned blue to me, but I was just exploring and didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have pet out,<br/>
&gt; used HT and it didn&#39;t drop him (I figure he has about 300hp, as I<br/>
&gt; did 303hp<br/>
&gt; to him total), but he died none the less and me with 2 bubbles<br/>
&gt; left.  I was<br/>
&gt; told watch out for his friend that spawns with him on occasion.<br/>
&gt; Oh, and he<br/>
&gt; bashes, which I really don&#39;t like.  Plus what are you suppose to<br/>
&gt; do with the<br/>
&gt; orc scalp?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway anyone know where to hunt alone when you are level 15, no magic<br/>
&gt; weapon yet, and not a whole lot of banded armor yet.  Or just<br/>
&gt; stick to west<br/>
&gt; commons.  Don&#39;t like mummy&#39;s because of the rabies thing.<br/>

&gt; That was a really good response Beld.  I currently play an ogre<br/>
&gt; shadowknight<br/>
&gt; lvl 22 on Povar.  I haven&#39;t really tried the fear and then chase to get a<br/>
&gt; few hits in, but I definitly like the sound of it.  I normally hit with a<br/>
&gt; darkness spell, then a str sapping spell and melee away.  My<br/>
&gt; warrior side is<br/>
&gt; much better than my spell casting side, so I play the tank<br/>
&gt; mostly.  I always<br/>
&gt; try to group with a cleric if possible.  Also, I TOTALLY agree with having<br/>
&gt; your pet, I even try to get one when in a group.  This morning I was<br/>
&gt; fighting in Highpass Hold (MY GOD, how many do I have to kill before I can<br/>
&gt; go into HH :)  )  and they drop a lot of the rusty weapons.  I<br/>
&gt; gave my pet a<br/>
&gt; rusty mace and he was hitting in the range of 15-18.  Very nice little<br/>
&gt; addition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have almost full bronze on finally, with a few exceptions.  I have a<br/>
&gt; grotesque mask, and I finally got a greater zweihander (sp), which reminds<br/>
&gt; me, i&#39;m selling a  2handed well balanced, magical axe on that server which<br/>
&gt; normally sells for about 550 from the shady guy in the<br/>
&gt; ecommons/nro tunnel.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m selling it for around 300 if anyone is interested.  I am also<br/>
&gt; curious as<br/>
&gt; to what type of armour/items other ogre sk&#39;s are wearing and any<br/>
&gt; suggestoins<br/>
&gt; they might have.<br/>
