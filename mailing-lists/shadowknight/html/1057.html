<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903731282">We just completed the Darkforge boots quest.<br/>
<br/>
9AC<br/>
3STA<br/>
<br/>
Equal to Rubi in every way shape and form.<br/>
<br/>
Color Red.<br/>
<br/>
Though upon closer inspection of both the bracer and<br/>
boots, they are a little bit darker red than the rubi.<br/>
One was on a human..the other a troll. So anyone<br/>
thinking that they were escaping the dreaded red armor<br/>
due to their race can stop hoping.<br/>
<br/>
This is leading me to believe that i was misinformed<br/>
as to the color of the BP. The inventory graphic was<br/>
probably black, as are the boots, so he may have<br/>
assumed that it was black when put on. I dont know.<br/>
Eventually someone will get it and we&#39;ll know for<br/>
sure.<br/>
The bracer&#39;s inventory graphic looks like banded.<br/>
<br/>
Now as to why they are filling us up with STA stats, i<br/>
dont know. Maybe there were complaints that we dont<br/>
have as many HPs as warriors?.. whatever. Im just<br/>
disappointed again with the boots. One of the pieces i<br/>
was actually looking forward to.<br/>
Maybe i will go get the DW boots after all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sweet dreams<br/>
