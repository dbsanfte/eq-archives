<div id="ygrps-yiv-288423700">Well, I managed to find and kill the NPC Messenger, and return<br/>
the note, and received the quest for the Bayle List.  Two things<br/>
I notice as odd, was the quest text had [Bayle List], but I couldn&#39;t<br/>
get him to go any further, and the quest told me to bring back her<br/>
Bayle List III.  I killed her just for good measure, no list there.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, it seems like there must be a use for the other two<br/>
Bayle Lists.  Does anyone know if the Bayle List that Mammoth (the<br/>
bear in Surefall) is rumored to carry is Bayle List III, or is<br/>
it a totally unrelated item?  I wonder if there is someone you can<br/>
turn all 3 parts in to?  Or a way to read/translate them...<br/>
