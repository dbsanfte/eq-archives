<div id="ygrps-yiv-136337639">More quest questions. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Is the Ring of the Dead still in the game?<br/>
Does anyone know where the spawn point of Sir Lindeal is? I heard it was<br/>
near the Goblin camp near Najena, and that when he spawns the wandering mobs<br/>
kill him pretty quickly.<br/>
How often does he spawn? Is that in-game hours or RL hours?<br/>
