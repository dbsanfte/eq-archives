<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733129295">i am now lvl 19; my 1hs skill is 100, and my 2hs skill is about 92. i<br/>
repeatedly change positions in fights to try to remedy my poor hit rate, i<br/>
have still fought entire battles where i have not landed a single blow. on<br/>
questioning some paladins (out of character of course 8)) i get the<br/>
impression that they have the same problem. maybe a low hit rate is a payoff<br/>
the two classes have to make for having other powerful abilities?</div>
