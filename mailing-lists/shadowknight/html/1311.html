<b>Subject:</b> Grobb Cleaver or bust? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-429888587">Ok, as promissed here are more questions directed at DE, Human, Erdite<br/>
(sounds wierd eh?) SKs out there.<br/>
I had a Grobb Cleaver with my TSK and am curious what 2HS you all use. I<br/>
plan on keeping both 1HS and 2HS maxxed as long as possible.<br/>
So what is a good 2HS obtainable at around 26th level. What should one<br/>
expect to pay for it?<br/>
I am thinking of getting another Cleaver, I liked it and did well with it.<br/>
