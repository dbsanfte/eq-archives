<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007864432">I found out 2 very good things to know about the <br/>
Freeport sewer system last night. 1st and most important <br/>
I can train at the SK guild there. Wohoo. 2nd and most <br/>
annoying, I cannot walk around the ledge of the pool of <br/>
water because my troll a$$ is too wide. :( So if I am in <br/>
Neriak or the commonlands then I can walk to the guild <br/>
from West FP to East FP and train, but need to leave via <br/>
East Treeport and Zone through the tunnel to the <br/>
commonlands. That is still better than going through <br/>
Oasis and both parts of Ro and the Innothule for half of <br/>
the trip.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone out there ever see the Spore Guardian?  I <br/>
wandered the entire swamp last night for 2 hours looking <br/>
for him and only found fungusman trackers. Do you need <br/>
to talk to the #2 for the SK guild to trigger him <br/>
spawning?  Is there a certain time of the game day? It <br/>
was 6PM gametime when I started looking.<br/>
<br/>
The swamp now gives very little XP except for the <br/>
occasional fat and bull alligator, and the Lesser <br/>
Mummmies that spawn at the tower. Nothing over a <br/>
Froglock Fisherman spawned last night. Aren&#39;t there <br/>
higher level Frogs that spawn in the swamp? If not then <br/>
it looks like I will need to either try Guk solo or the <br/>
bandit camps in South Ro. Of course it could be a time <br/>
of game day issue again too.<br/>
<br/>
Got an Ogre to get me the HEHE meat from Chef Dooga. <br/>
What a pain in the a$$.  The exchange went fine and we <br/>
were both very happy.  I talked for a while then went to <br/>
put them in the bank for when I give them to Carver. <br/>
While I was talking, I ATE ONE!  I was very POed! I had <br/>
14 rations on me an the system had me eat a HEHE meat!<br/>
The ogre that got them for me said &quot;maybe that why it <br/>
called HEHE...&quot; DOH!  Anyway, I paid him to go get me <br/>
more HEHE (5 this time in case he ate one by accident, <br/>
and/or I ate another one) which I immediately ran and <br/>
put in the bank. Now I have enough HEHE meat to do the <br/>
Quest twice. :)<br/>
<br/>
This list is VERY quiet. Make some noise people!!!!<br/>
I don&#39;t care what you send. Just send something. :)<br/>
