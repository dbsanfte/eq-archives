<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088840784">Not dead. Of course, with XMas and holidays I don&#39;t expect many of us will<br/>
be playing as much EQ. Well, I would if I *could* but damned if I don&#39;t have<br/>
to go home for vacation. Would you believe I don&#39;t even own a modem!? I have<br/>
to go buy one!<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, for pure exp at a higher level, I found a great spot last<br/>
night. In Sol B by the zone in near the foreman room/singe&#39;s spawn. Just<br/>
fight the local to that room and pull whatever you can. Zone is right there<br/>
so moderately safe (our cleric died on a zone out because some jerk was<br/>
pulling huge, unannounced trains in Sol A.) and I got a bub and a half in<br/>
about 2.5 hours I think it was. That&#39;s amazing for me and I assume many of<br/>
you all too.<br/>
<br/>
Level 20- Go check out the treants in S Karana in a level or twow if you<br/>
dont&#39; mind bad qeynos guard faction (well, druids too, but who cares about<br/>
druids? =D) You can level real fast there.<br/>
<br/>
happy holidays all<br/>
