<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611760632">Eye candy is what makes alot of people turn into real <br/>
jerks when going for an item. The Item could be crap, <br/>
but as long as it looks kewl, someone will pay through <br/>
the nose for it.  Personally, I would be willing to <br/>
carry the weapon around a zone for show if I had a <br/>
better weapon, and switch to the good/better one when <br/>
entering combat.<br/>
As for quests.<br/>
Brian you are the one (other than Beld, and a few others <br/>
I missed, sorry) that can answer this one.  You may <br/>
choose not to, or may not be allowed to, but I will give <br/>
it a shot.<br/>
Is there a Quest out there for SKs that will allow them <br/>
to get a title similar to the Paladin Test of Truth in <br/>
Freeport? I don&#39;t know about you, but I would quest to <br/>
get Sir Cronik Khaos (what I want my last name to be) or <br/>
Lord Cronik Khaos or whatever an evil title would be as <br/>
part of my character.<br/>
I started a Paladin a while ago, but hated being human <br/>
and dropped it. I only started it because of the tile.<br/>
Anyone?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is also a status symbol, and thus important in RP context.  I<br/>
&gt;also would rather do a month long quest than camp for many hours.<br/>
&gt;I am tired of camping, and am really looking for something to work<br/>
&gt;on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And the stats aren&#39;t that bad either.  Maybe I just think since<br/>
&gt;they have two, so should we, but then I guess we get to share<br/>
&gt;a few with warriors (Soul Leech should be SK only!)<br/>
