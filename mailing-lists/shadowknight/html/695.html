<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307182289">Why have we never met? Virten 24 SK, Sol Ro.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, Human SK&#39;s are a royal pain and, well, I&#39;m just glad to get some<br/>
affirmation.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you want more feedback or assistance. I&#39;m sure most everyone<br/>
here would be more than willing to help in any way possible. I know I sure<br/>
would. I love the SK and I love the RP possibilities it presents just wish<br/>
it wasn&#39;t such a hard path. :)<br/>
