<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569676338">how many times have i cast the spells being replaced...let&#39;s see.<br/>
<br/>
- reclaim energy: 2<br/>
- mend bones: 3<br/>
- voice graft: 1<br/>
<br/>
on the other hand...<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m quite sure that i would cast the lv30 lifetap fairly often to ruduce <br/>
downtime and kill runners (i see &quot;miss! miss! miss! miss! miss! far too <br/>
often when i wait for the sliver of a bastardly frog&#39;s hp to be sucked away <br/>
by dot. i&#39;d be willing to bet that mobs under 20% or so get a massive agi <br/>
shot as part of a &quot;frenzy&quot; phase).<br/>
<br/>
so, i can&#39;t complain. especially since i honestly didn&#39;t expect our class to <br/>
see any changes past the 49 pet change many months ago. also, i don&#39;t have <br/>
much sympathy for those who take the &quot;i suck in groups&quot;, &quot;these spells don&#39;t <br/>
help in groups&quot; line. consider yourself lucky that you have the manpower <br/>
available to finish each battle in a timeframe that makes your dots <br/>
&quot;useless&quot;...it&#39;s a simple trade off in my opinion. a higher level of safety <br/>
and the power for larger encounters with reduced spell effectiveness vs. <br/>
high risk, limited total fighting strength and spells which realize their <br/>
full potential. furthermore, i&#39;ve never been called &quot;useless&quot; in group or <br/>
been refused acceptance based on my class. in most cases i&#39;m readily <br/>
accepted if not in demand as our versatility can balance most any party when <br/>
played right.<br/>
<br/>
if you&#39;re running into people who don&#39;t respect your abilities or strengths <br/>
because you don&#39;t visibly attack a mobs hp with big dd or critical <br/>
hits...you really need to find some better people, some people whose <br/>
understanding of combat goes beyond watching the hp bar or gangbanging mobs <br/>
in a 6 on 1.<br/>

&gt;I agree with Xilith.  This is a downtime reducer at worst, and depending on<br/>
&gt;how long the casting time is, this may be able to be cast between swings.<br/>
&gt;Plus, this will be great for those times when you get your butt kicked to<br/>
&gt;the point where you just have to back of fight your group&#39;s in.  This is<br/>
&gt;also something that the smaller race SKs can do with their mana that us<br/>
&gt;large will not be able to do as much.  At level 33 my mana will be closer <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;450 with my troll.  That extra about 250 mana of a DE equals 4 45 point<br/>
&gt;lifetaps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not sure on mana drain (I&#39;ve heard very inefficient) but here is the<br/>
&gt;max Hp<br/>
&gt; &gt; drain..<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lifetap (Sk Lvl 9, Necro lvl 1) - 5Hps<br/>
&gt; &gt; LifeSpike (Sk Lvl 15, Necro Lvl 4) - 11Hps<br/>
&gt; &gt; LifeDraw (Sk lvl 30, Necro Lvl 12) - 45Hps<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The word I&#39;m think of is useless.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s better than Reclaim Energy, Mend Bones, and Voice Graft.  Being<br/>
&gt;able to use all my mana for more than half my hit points at level 33<br/>
&gt;is not a bad thing in my opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t see how you can complain about this.  Sure, we could probably<br/>
&gt;pick out better spells, but this is definately an improvement.  If<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m soloing, I can use these to half my downtime, or as a healing<br/>
&gt;boost once a mob is snared and running (in place) at the end of a fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s my math on this for my Level 33 DE SK:<br/>
&gt;HP:  845<br/>
&gt;Mana:  700<br/>
&gt;LifeDraw:  45 Hps for 63 Mana<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, I can cast 11 lifedraws at FM, which is 495 HP.  Granted,<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s an ideal scenario.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is that not enough healing for a damage oriented class?<br/>
&gt;No hybrid will get bind or gate, so what other rank 1,2, and 4 spells<br/>
&gt;could they have given us?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When it comes down to it, I have an option I never had before, and<br/>
&gt;that I cannot complain about.<br/>
