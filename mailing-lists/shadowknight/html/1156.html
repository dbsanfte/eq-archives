<div id="ygrps-yiv-739694151">Now im not sure what level your SK, but after 40<br/>
levels, i am willing to stretch my neck out and say<br/>
that i have no problem with what they did.<br/>
Even before they gave us the tap series, it was pretty<br/>
much predicted that they werent going to be a huge<br/>
factor in our arsenal. But rather a nice little side<br/>
addition. Keep in mind what they replaced.<br/>
the life taps arent meant to fill you up with only a<br/>
few castings. At level 40, 89 INT (im a human after<br/>
all) it takes a full bub of mana to cast lifedraw.So i<br/>
can cast it 5 times.<br/>
Thats 225 HP i dont have to sit on my butt and wait<br/>
for. Mana comes back a heck of a lot quicker than HP<br/>
thats for sure.<br/>
Its either that or you can sit around and talk thru<br/>
your pet while you wait for those 225 to regen.<br/>
<br/>
Your point on HT is still an issue that we should<br/>
indeed fight for.<br/>
Especially since they added in the 2/3 DMG with PvP.<br/>
So not only was our HT very resistable to begin with,<br/>
now they chopped it down even more.<br/>
So instead of doing 401, at best, i can do only 266,<br/>
and thats if its not resisted at all.<br/>
I am still a strong supported to have a Tap feature<br/>
added to the HT.<br/>
Now fighting any form of healer (esp Pallies) with our<br/>
weakened &quot;special ability&quot; has been made even more<br/>
difficult. Does that mean we will lose all the time?<br/>
of course not. But still we have our already shaky HT<br/>
made even weaker. Weakening an already weak<br/>
&quot;attribute&quot; doesnt sound like balancing to me.<br/>
So instead of making it unresistable, instead of<br/>
boosting the DMG, just add a Tap.<br/>
So when it does that awesome 14DMG, you can at least<br/>
heal up that same 14.<br/>
example:<br/>
40 SK vs 40 Pal, equal equipment , all that stuff<br/>
SK-HT=266<br/>
Pal-LoH=801<br/>
266=801 ?  ummm..dont think so. But then again i am a<br/>
product of the public school system.<br/>
<br/>
Add the Tap feature:<br/>
SK-HT=266, 266 tapped= 532<br/>
Pal-LoH=801<br/>
532=801 ? Still nope..but its a hell of alot better<br/>
than the first example.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...thats my opinion of course<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; This is intentional to balance the power of the<br/>
&gt; spells.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Brian<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First off, the spells are not all that powerful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For a necromancer at the levels he/she gets the<br/>
&gt; spells yes they can be<br/>
&gt; powerful for that class. They dont have much health<br/>
&gt; to start with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for when shadow knights get these spells, we are<br/>
&gt; looking at a Troll Sk<br/>
&gt; with almost 300 hitpoints (or more) at lvl 9 so the<br/>
&gt; little life tap isnt<br/>
&gt; going to effect him much. As he / she gets each<br/>
&gt; additional spell at their<br/>
&gt; corisponding levels it can help out in getting you<br/>
&gt; that last hit in but<br/>
&gt; thats about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the so called &quot;power&quot; of the spells the mana<br/>
&gt; requirement is going to<br/>
&gt; keep them in the back of the book. I thoght the pets<br/>
&gt; could be useless I now<br/>
&gt; see the life taps are.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If your going to &quot;improve&quot; our class like this<br/>
&gt; atleast give us one more<br/>
&gt; thing, dont let Harm Touch be resisted. Its a power<br/>
&gt; from the gods after all,<br/>
&gt; I dont care how powerful you are unless your a god<br/>
&gt; you shouldnt be able to<br/>
&gt; resist this power.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And if you really want to help this less used class,<br/>
&gt; make some shadow knight<br/>
&gt; only spells. A paladin can use clerical spells<br/>
&gt; pretty well because a Paladin<br/>
&gt; is only a Cleric with a sword, now a Shadow Knights<br/>
&gt; spells are from a PURE<br/>
&gt; CASTER class wich is kind of odd that we use their<br/>
&gt; spells way after they<br/>
&gt; stop useing them their selves. A little more work is<br/>
&gt; needed with the SK<br/>
&gt; Class to truly balance them out, your paying<br/>
&gt; customers are speeking out so<br/>
&gt; you should listen (I see more complaints about SKs<br/>
&gt; then any other class).<br/>
