<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529110043">If you are a Troll or Ogre you can bash even when wielding a 2H weapon, so then<br/>
it would be stupid not to.<br/>
If you are a dark elf work both up to be able to use the best according to what<br/>
weapon you have aquired. If you are a humie... I feel sorry for you (joke, same<br/>
as for dark elf).      =)<br/>

&gt; Hello my fellow Shadow Knights,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a Dark Elf, LVL 19, and i have a question for u LVL 22&#39;s and above.  My<br/>
&gt; question is,  &quot;Do we SK&#39;s become very powerful at LVL 22?&quot;  The reason that<br/>
&gt; i ask this is because i&#39;ve heard a few people say that if u hold on and keep<br/>
&gt; playing and hit lvl 22 that u won&#39;t be disappointed.  As of right now i<br/>
&gt; basically am a weak warrior with a few weak spells.  Do our spells improve<br/>
&gt; greatly?  I sure hope so, because from what i&#39;ve been told SK&#39;s are one of<br/>
&gt; the strongest high lvl classes there is... so let me know something u higher<br/>
&gt; lvl players!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One last question... Which is better using a 2H Slashing weapon our using a<br/>
&gt; 1H Slashing Weapon with bash?  Hehe, and don&#39;t tell me it depends on the<br/>
&gt; weapon... my question is overall.... Just wondering because if 2H Slashing<br/>
&gt; is better then I&#39;ll have to start lvling it up..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks Brothers,<br/>
