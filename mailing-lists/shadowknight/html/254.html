<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887393565">Sorry, this isn&#39;t an answer to the previous question, but rather an<br/>
addition.  Does anyone know how you go about getting your own boat?<br/>
I&#39;ve seen shots of little boats with people in them and I thought that<br/>
could make travel a lot easier for those of us who are Kos in the towns<br/>
with the scheduled ferries.  <br/>
