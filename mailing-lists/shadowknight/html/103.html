<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Paladins do not get pets of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It _should_ make up for it, however there are other mitigating factors.<br/>
The pets are not generally as useful as necro pets, since these pets lag<br/>
behind the SK&#39;s level by a significant amount.  A 10th level SK&#39;s pet is<br/>
probably not that threatening to the type of monster a 10th level SK will<br/>
attempt to solo.  This is actually somewhat of a problem with SK spells in<br/>
general -- they&#39;re not useful at the levels they are actually acquired.  <br/>
<br/>
In addition, SKs are evil, therefore they&#39;re often KOS in many lands.  This<br/>
means they are already working at a significant disadvantage to paladins.<br/>
This makes travel particularly dangerous for SKs, and to make matters worse<br/>
they don&#39;t get ANY spells to assist travelling long distances or to heal<br/>
themselves.  An invis or gate spell in addition to a lifetap would REALLY<br/>
be nice to pick up at level 15 or so.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once again, my position as a game developer probably provides some insight<br/>
into this.  It is quite obvious from Smedley&#39;s public comments that they<br/>
are aware of the bugs/complaints.  Lack of an individual response (or even<br/>
a public position on more widespread grievances, e.g. vampiric embrace not<br/>
working, rogue issues, and SK HT) irks some, but if they do nothing but<br/>
answer e-mails or post position papers then they are likely neglecting the<br/>
task of actually resolving issues.  For example, it&#39;s pretty obvious that<br/>
the past few days they&#39;ve concentrated on networking/packet loss/ISP issues.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the wisest thing to do is write a very intelligently done essay,<br/>
post it to a Web site, message board, etc. and also e-mail it to John<br/>
Smedley politely.  If he doesn&#39;t respond, so be it, however I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll<br/>
read the e-mail and take it into consideration.<br/>
<br/>
To me the big issues are:<br/>
<br/>
1.  HT does not balance against LoH.  To make this fairer/more balanced, I<br/>
think they should either:<br/>
	- not allow it to be resisted (partially or completely)<br/>
	- make it analogous to LoH in terms of damage<br/>
	..or..<br/>
	- allow it to be cast at a faster rate, three times a day<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m against the latter, since it then becomes a tool instead of an escape<br/>
mechanism.  I like the idea of HT being used for epic battles and sticky<br/>
situations instead of just using it during the normal course of a day of<br/>
adventuring.<br/>
<br/>
2.  SKs are KOS in many lands, so this should affect the balancing somewhat<br/>
(or we just accept that this makes them more difficult to play and so be it).<br/>
<br/>
3.  While SK pets do offset some of the negative aspects, they are fairly<br/>
weak and not as useful as many players believe.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Since SKs are KOS in so many areas, they should have SOME type of &quot;safe<br/>
transport&quot; spell at their disposal.  At a minimum invis, preferably a gate.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Like warriors, SKs do not have the ability to heal at an accelerated<br/>
rate.  Instead of comparing them to warriors, however, I think it is more<br/>
valid to compare them to paladins and necros, their closest analogs, both<br/>
of whom have healing type spells.  A simple lifetap would help out a lot,<br/>
and I think would actually make the game more interesting, since you would<br/>
have SKs that roam the land sucking the life from creatures in order to<br/>
sustain their own health.<br/>
