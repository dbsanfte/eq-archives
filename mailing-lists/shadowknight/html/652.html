<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175268699">Freeport Quest that involve Opal Darkbriar....<br/>
1)Hogcaller&#39;s Inn:  In the warrior&#39;s guild, you are <br/>
given a quest to investigate the Hogcaller&#39;s Inn.  End <br/>
result is info of a traitor named Opal.  This I believe <br/>
is the Opal in the Arcane Science building.<br/>
2)Groflah Steadirt&#39;s Death:  Netuk Phenzon at the <br/>
shadowknight&#39;s guild says that Lord Innoruuk has need of <br/>
your services.  Your [mission] concerns a man named <br/>
Groflah Steadirt. Groflah has come into possession of a <br/>
piece of parchment that was taken from one of the Dismal <br/>
Rage&#39;s allies. You are instructed to find Groflah and <br/>
kill him, while returning the note to Netuk. Doing this <br/>
will improve your standing with the Dismal Rage and Opal <br/>
Darkbriar (most likely the Necro version) and lower it <br/>
with the Knights of Truth.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately I think it is actually the same Opal <br/>
Darkbriar, but the Arcane Science one is a traitor.  <br/>
There is a third place Opal Darkbriar spawns which is in <br/>
the Slums of West Freeport on the second floor of one of <br/>
the buildings.  She is usually under a minor Illusion <br/>
spell and looks like a locked chest (i think). In this <br/>
form, Hails do nothing, and I have no clue how to get <br/>
her to drop the illusion. Anyone else see this?<br/>
Has been a while since I have ventured above the sewers <br/>
in Freeport, so I am not sure how accurate this info is.<br/>

&gt;Does anyone know if there is a connection between the<br/>
&gt;2 different Opal Darkbriars in Freeport?<br/>
&gt;One is the Dark Elf Necro guildmaster under FP. The<br/>
&gt;other is a High Elf Wizard guildmaster in the Arcane<br/>
&gt;Science Building.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any knowledge on this?<br/>
