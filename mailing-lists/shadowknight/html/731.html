<b>Subject:</b> RE: Vampiric embrace or lifetap? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842700828">One of the reasons I don&#39;t like Lifetap is that I have to disengage the<br/>
actual combat to cast the spell (are lifetap spells quick?). With VE I can<br/>
cast once and stay in the battle. Also I&#39;ve noticed that it counts as a 3rd<br/>
attack (I&#39;ve doubled and still had the VE effect go off). If they could just<br/>
up the damage and make it go off more often that would be great with me.<br/>
Maybe give VE at 15 and a upgraded version at 30 (is there a upgraded<br/>
version???). <br/>
<br/>
Also on pets, I think they have a use, but only up to about the third circle<br/>
of spells (lvl 22). I was still soloing quite a bit at that point and the<br/>
pet was nice to have. I do think that they need to dumb a few of pet utility<br/>
spells though and replace them with something that might someday be mistaken<br/>
for something useful (Voice Graft, Mend Bones and Reclaim Energy - I have<br/>
never used any of these except to see what they do). Personally I&#39;d like to<br/>
see us get the Grim Aura line of spells.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just some thoughts. <br/>
