<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726444805">There is only one way to raise faction with the majority of guilds in Neriak<br/>
and that is to kill the Wood Elf slaves in Crushbone - the crushbone orcs<br/>
are allied with the DE royal family so helping the orcs in their war against<br/>
the elves helps you to raise faction.<br/>

Whats the best way for me to raise Neriak faction.<br/>
I and Dubious in most places, appre to SKs and Necros,<br/>
and KOS to warriors.<br/>
I would like to build it up some though.<br/>
<br/>
Killing halflings in Nektulos only raises it with the<br/>
roaming DE guards.<br/>
Killing the halfling in the pool, only lowers it with<br/>
other halflings.<br/>
<br/>
The only quest that looks like i might be able to do<br/>
are the Dark Sisters quests. But i need items from<br/>
Lower Guk for most of them. Which would make for a not<br/>
very speedy way of doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Its only a matter of time before i am KOS in both<br/>
North FP and Qeynos. Which will only leave HP and<br/>
neriak for me to do banking. So i would like my new<br/>
home to at least like me some :)<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
