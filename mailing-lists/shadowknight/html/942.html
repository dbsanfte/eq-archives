<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-456878259">Okay ... where are Dwarven Workboots? Unrest, right? Any idea where? In that<br/>
basement? I&#39;ve been to unrest exactly one time but as soon as my wizzie<br/>
friend hits 29 I&#39;m insisting that my group go there (fyi I play with a group<br/>
of RL friends so we all play together) and kill stuff. The tail end of the<br/>
group is a 22 cleric though so we are kinda spread out. (30 will be<br/>
uber-hell for me as I&#39;ve promised to stop leveling for a while and help them<br/>
catch up. :) Feign Death will be nice for that).<br/>
<br/>
later,<br/>
