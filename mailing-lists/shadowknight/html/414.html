<b>Subject:</b> Dark elf faction raising <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555044886">Well, i did what i did not want to do most, lose my dark elf faction! It<br/>
isnt totally back to &quot;ready to attack&quot;<br/>
but now its at &quot;threatening&quot;. I had to save a guildmember who was being<br/>
killed by the sergeant d&#39;ocom...<br/>
<br/>
So now i ask...what does everyone know about raising dark elf factions<br/>
back up? i cannot remember the exact names of factions that went down<br/>
when i killed the sergeant but i do know one was<br/>
indigo brotherhood - wich i think is the rogue guild.<br/>
i think two of them were darkguards, or darkguardians.<br/>
<br/>
Killing all 3 halfling camps for a hour did not help either, all it<br/>
raised was &quot;Unkempt druids&quot; faction<br/>
i even killed a leaterfoot deputy and that didnt help a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I really wish we had some more information on who to kill for wich<br/>
faction to raise, maybe there is a chart out there on the net.<br/>
Any info on how to raise Dark elf faction would be appreciated greatly<br/>
