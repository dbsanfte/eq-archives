<b>Subject:</b> Shadow Vortex - most useless spell or most underratted? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722197669">I wish I had a p for every time someone has whinged about the shadow vortex<br/>
spells. 12 Ac lowered, woopeee do!!<br/>
<br/>
well lets say for arguments sake that due to this 12 lower ac (14 with the<br/>
new patch i think) you now hit for 2 extra dmg then what you would have<br/>
done. I estimate that in a standard fight using a 2 H sword I wouldswing 20<br/>
to 30 times. so that is 40 to 60 dmg. times this by the 2 or 3 tanks you<br/>
might have in a group and you are looking at 100 to 180 extra dmg, roughly.<br/>
<br/>
While these numbers are fudged, it does show you how much extra dmg you mnay<br/>
do. If you really want to test it then next time you fight somthing, take<br/>
your helm off, or glovbes and see how much extra dmg.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and imagine how much a difference 12 Ac would make ina a hige fight<br/>
against a dragon or ghould lord which last for ages with lots of tanks<br/>
hitting on the mob<br/>
