<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802619566">so far, have you been having other people bring you the components, or have<br/>
you actually found a place to get them yourself? :)<br/>
<br/>
also, i wasnt aware that you had to use more components now.. i thought the<br/>
idea with the trade skills allowed you to use the SAME number of components<br/>
to get MORE results (thereby making skills like baking not suck.. not as<br/>
much, anyway). i could of course be wrong :)<br/>
