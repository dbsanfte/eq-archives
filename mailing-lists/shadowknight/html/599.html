<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679563648">There isn&#39;t a whole lot of activity on this list so I <br/>
will just ramble and rant for a bit.  Feel free to <br/>
delete this if you wish.<br/>
<br/>
Last night was kewl yet slow for Cronik.  He only died <br/>
twice and that was not his fault, kind of.  The first <br/>
time was against a yellow lesser mummy.  I was really <br/>
kicking it into the negative plane when suddenly I start <br/>
getting nailed by 3 other skeles!  I was not in the <br/>
aggro spawn range of the obilisk (I saw other skeles pop <br/>
and not attack me) so I guess someone was out matched <br/>
and trained me. That sucked since another person was <br/>
KSing from me for 30 minutes.  I was getting really mad <br/>
since most of what I was attacking was green (yet giving <br/>
xp sometimes) and blue. <br/>
Then I see an auction for a Tentecle Whip for 25pp. Hot <br/>
dam!  Now I have no idea what a TW is really worth, but <br/>
I jumped on it after seeing someone here (sorry forgot <br/>
your name) talk about using their whip and I am very <br/>
happy. :)  Now I had been neglecting my 1HS since 4th <br/>
level, but had a 26 in it after training at the guild. I <br/>
went out and fought any blue creature I could find. Last <br/>
I remember my 1HS was at 40.  I killed 2 wisps at yellow <br/>
and even. kewl!<br/>
While getting my 1HS up I was killing kodies. On a <br/>
yellow kodi it happened to be pretty even and was <br/>
hovering over my Harm Touch hotkey when 2 skeles start <br/>
helping out. Dam. I was not able to get any Mana <br/>
increasing items last night and did not have Invis <br/>
Undead up as a result.  I would have lived if I had. :(<br/>
Last night ended with me 1/2 way to 10th.  Probably <br/>
would be into 10th but kodies were not plentiful, and I <br/>
trained my 1HS before it got too far behind to train it <br/>
easy.  <br/>
<br/>
I also grouped with a 7th and an 8th DE trying to level <br/>
them up.  They weren&#39;t used to grouping and they would <br/>
not say where they were/loc when not in sight or that <br/>
they were getting attacked or how much mana they had. <br/>
:(  Luckily no one died.  <br/>
<br/>
I will not fight on a mountain top anymore. When a <br/>
creature runs and rondomly switches direction (on a <br/>
dime) and on mountains it sucks! Had a massive train <br/>
when it came back at 1/2 health!  <br/>
<br/>
While running around the entrance to EC from Neriak I <br/>
see a 6th level Paladin running around. WTF?  I can see <br/>
a 18th level looking to pull a guard or two to the zone, <br/>
but a 6th level? Jeez. Never realized how easy it was to <br/>
just wander around Neriak as a goody race. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone know what level Travis Two Tone is?<br/>
I want to try to take him out soon. :)<br/>
And those dam halflings! What level are they? The group <br/>
on the newbie side kicked my a$$ last weekend at blue. <br/>
Whirl for 22 points and thrown back like 15 feet! <br/>
Couldn&#39;t get in to Slam. Haven&#39;t been back since.<br/>
