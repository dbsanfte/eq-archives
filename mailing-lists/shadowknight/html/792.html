&gt; Okay, here&#39;s a question for you folks.  What if<br/>
&gt; Shadow Step and Voice Graft were replaced with some<br/>
&gt; kind of lifetap spells?  Would<br/>
&gt; this be grossly unbalancing or hurt the class?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If we tune the SK we can&#39;t really ADD new spells,<br/>
&gt; since this would give them more spells than the<br/>
&gt; other hybrids at each rank.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree with the Shadow Step being left alone.<br/>
Great escape/dueling spell. <br/>
<br/>
Voice Graft? Need anyone say more.<br/>
<br/>
I was practicing my Evoke  one day, casting Ward<br/>
Undead on my pet. Out of shear boredom, i cast Voice<br/>
Graft. A level 50 Paladins walks by, and thru my pet i<br/>
give him a how-do-ya-do.<br/>
<br/>
He stops and laughs and says to me &quot;that another one<br/>
of those useless SK spells?&quot; I say &quot;Yup, its my reward<br/>
for working my butt off to reach level 30&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
He laughs again and runs off.<br/>
<br/>
Someone claims Voice Graft has RP value? Ummm...if you<br/>
say so.<br/>
<br/>
It needs to go.<br/>
<br/>
I, like others, fear the Lifetaps we would get. Most<br/>
likely it would take too much time/mana to be bothered<br/>
with in combat.<br/>
If we got a GOOD lifedrain. Fine. But i am very<br/>
skeptical.<br/>
<br/>
 I would rather have it replaced with another utility<br/>
spell such as Cure Disease. Just like Necros, whatever<br/>
we call up, we should be able to put down. We can<br/>
Disease something, we should be able to get rid of it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thats just a suggestion that has more of a chance of<br/>
going thru as opposed to Lifedrain that would actually<br/>
help us. As mentioned, whichever lifedrain they give<br/>
us would most likely be too low of one to be really<br/>
useful.<br/>
<br/>
Damage shield like Banshee would have been great. <br/>
A boost to VE would make sense. I stand by VE, even in<br/>
its current state. No you cant rely on it to heal you,<br/>
but it is a great in-combat spell. Damages and heals<br/>
some in addition to your swing. Its free basically<br/>
damage/heal. Cast before a fight, so no in battle time<br/>
wasted. And when it hits, its guaranteed. No<br/>
variation. At level 34, when it hits, its for<br/>
18DMG/Heal everytime.<br/>
