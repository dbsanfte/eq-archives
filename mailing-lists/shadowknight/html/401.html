<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082451618">Someone said that if you kill things in Befallen, your faction with the neriak necros goes down, but the faction names are different.  Namely befallen skels are BefallenInhabitants, and the necros are...  Well, I&#39;m not sure.  So since they have different names, you faction shouldn&#39;t go down, right?</div>
