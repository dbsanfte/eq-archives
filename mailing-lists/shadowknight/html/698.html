Would you also ask him about Boil Blood? Or any of the other spells we had<br/>
taken away from us way back in the day? =( I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but I<br/>
heartily disagree that you guys need to worry about the low/mid levels when<br/>
the SK never even seems to peak at the *high* levels. Is some new and/or<br/>
better high level spells asking too much? And what&#39;s with the pets? Gah,<br/>
what a joke! Here&#39;s an idea, how about switching out all our useless pet<br/>
spells and replacing them with the equivalent lifetap spells for those<br/>
levels? That would be a great deal more helpful than those pets that do<br/>
nothing but get yer arse into trouble.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The human SKs? At least they don&#39;t have the staggering exp penalty that dark<br/>
elves do. As for being the most difficult (or second-most) class combo, why<br/>
is it that there are 3 level 50 human SKs on Fennin Ro and only 1 level 50<br/>
dark elf SK?<br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story, I picked a dark elf SK and not a troll/ogre SK because I<br/>
was a warrior before, and I wanted to take *full* advantage of my new<br/>
spell-chucking abilities (as only a dark elf can, compared to<br/>
human/ogre/troll). Now all I hear about as I get higher and higher is the<br/>
*lack* of useful spells! I&#39;m 38 now, and I&#39;ll be 50 sooner rather than<br/>
later, and the last thing I want is to then have to start over AGAIN. Of<br/>
course, as soon as I dropped the warrior, yall go and fix &#39;em... sheesh...<br/>
