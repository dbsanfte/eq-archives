<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040822275">Well put Beld. I think we should all realize that SK&#39;s are not meant to be <br/>
healers like paladins and rangers to some extent. We are the hybrid that <br/>
focuses on dmg and killing foes. I agree though that pets have to be thought <br/>
out more about their usefulness and maybe even replaced with weak buffs or <br/>
DoT&#39;s. Heart flutter would be a great addition as it not only dmg&#39;s opponent <br/>
but also weakens its stats and those are two of the main aspects of the SK. I <br/>
also liked the idea of a dmg shield, maybe at 30. Banshee aura would fit this <br/>
perfectly as it is self cast and wouldnt be TOO powerful at only 8dmg a pop <br/>
to unbalance classes. Just my thoughts.<br/>
