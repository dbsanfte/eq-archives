<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133233088">I have heard that Dyllin not only spawns in HH, but he<br/>
also occasionally spawns at the lake in west comm.<br/>
<br/>
does anyone know how to trigger this spawn.<br/>
<br/>
we have tried talking to Lady Shae and using the<br/>
&quot;Dyllin&quot; keyword. But he hasnt showed yet. That stupid<br/>
Mojax keeps popping up though. We have already killed<br/>
him enough times :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
or do you have to turn in his note, talk to shae, then<br/>
see if he spawns. problem is, now, we cant talk to<br/>
shae. before that last patch we could, even though she<br/>
was threatening. so theres no way we can trigger her<br/>
without a mule, and a mule most likely wouldnt do it<br/>
if Mojax&#39;s note in needed.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any info<br/>
<br/>
