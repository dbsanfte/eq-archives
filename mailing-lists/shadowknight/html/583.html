<b>Subject:</b> groflah quest update <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822379118">ok, groflah does indeed appear in seafarer&#39;s wharf. *cringe* he will<br/>
show up immediately after you get the quest from netuk, but i think you<br/>
have to do this late at night during the game day.. if you start the<br/>
quest at another time, a different npc will appear where groflah would.<br/>
(i have seen both talym shoonstar, a lvl 20ish KoS barbarian, and sir<br/>
edwin motte, a lvl 30ish KoS paladin. eesh) it is possible to fight<br/>
groflah without attracting the attention of bronto the mean ol ogre and<br/>
his barbarian friend, just hide around the corner, drop a weak spell on<br/>
groflah, and train him upstairs to battle him there. upon returning the<br/>
note to netuk, i got an &quot;its about time. innoruuk will be happy&quot;, the<br/>
usual dismal rage fac hits, and a rusty rapier. whoopee.<br/>
<br/>
considering this quest requires either a lvl 16 necro or a lvl 30 sk to<br/>
do it alone (invis is REQUIRED), this quest really isnt rewarding enough<br/>
to be worth it. now i suppose we gotta wait until the lady shae quest<br/>
gets fixed..<br/>
