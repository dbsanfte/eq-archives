<div id="ygrps-yiv-625354378">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My character just recently made lvl 20 (Troll Sk) and I was wondering what<br/>
places should I now adventure in?  Oasis of Marr is pretty boring for me now<br/>
and I&#39;m wondering where I should go.   Where to group?   Where to solo?<br/>
<br/>
Any help is appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve started again on the test server...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess a few of you must have tried the Erudite SKs by now, any good?<br/>

Yep.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t tend to have a lot of time these days for extra-curricular EQ<br/>
activities (ie EQ is fun but losing its luster so I don&#39;t use free time as<br/>
much to do EQ-stuff. =D) but I still play.<br/>
<br/>
According to onelist we still have 116 members, who knows how many of those<br/>
are/were email addies made just for the list though.<br/>
<br/>
So how is everyone doing? How many of you have reached 50 these days?<br/>
<br/>
Personally, Virten is still chugging along rp&#39;ing first, getting exp second,<br/>
and just got level 36. And yes I&#39;ve been playing since release.<br/>
<br/>
How about anyone else? Got anything to share?<br/>
<br/>
