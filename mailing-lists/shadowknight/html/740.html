<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035844761">i&#39;d have to say add in a new DOT or weak damage shield if we were going to<br/>
remove something. don&#39;t throw out shadow step tho, it is a very useful spell<br/>
in the right circumstances. it is also one of the very best duelling spells<br/>
in the game, especially against other tanks :) last time i checked, i could<br/>
shadow step while rooted, even tho i stayed rooted once i reappeared (i just<br/>
basically moved to a random location without *moving*). if this still works,<br/>
shadow step is worth sparing for that reason alone. and no, dont *FIX* that<br/>
please! after all you can&#39;t abuse it that way to kite, it is just one of an<br/>
sk&#39;s many avoidance techniques.. and we NEED our avoidance techniques<br/>
because of our lack of healing :) that doesn&#39;t mean i endorse lifetap spells<br/>
tho hehe.. as the last several emails pointed out, they cast slow and have<br/>
fairly low output.<br/>
