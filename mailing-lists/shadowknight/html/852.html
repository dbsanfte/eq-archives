<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-981321644">No bad faction hits in Unrest that I am aware of.  Definately don&#39;t touch Crushbone Orcs and I&#39;ve heard that some bad faction hits can happen in Castle Mistmoore, but other than that, Faydwer is fair game for evils.<br/>
<br/>
The Greater Faydark wizard ring is in a great place close to the Lesser Faydark zone point (basically the center of the continent).  I&#39;ve passed by there a number of times on my way to Steamfont & Lesser Faydark.  Although there are wandering guards in Greater Faydark, I&#39;ve never once seen a guard in that area and in general guard sightings are rare away from Kelethin.  Also, Gnome and Dwarf guards are stationary, so on the whole our KoS problem in Faydwer is of minor concern on that continent IMHO.<br/>

Thanks Graham, I have been thinking about Unrest for a <br/>
while now, but... Does Unrest give negative faction hits <br/>
with any of the Nerco/Evil guilds that I will need to <br/>
keep high in my later career?<br/>

I also dread a teleport to Faydwer for the same reason. <br/>
I have no idea what NPCs hang around wizard teleport <br/>
rings.  I doubt I will ever use a Druidic Succor for <br/>
obvious reasons.  My wife&#39;s Bard worships Veeshan, and ï¿½Awhen teleported to the Druidic ring in the Karanas she <br/>
was KoSed.  With my lag I would never see that I am <br/>
being attacked, just the &quot;Returning to home point...&quot; <br/>
message.<br/>
