<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613898370"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So let&#39;s get it going again.<br/>
&gt; Right now the only question I want answered is, what does the spell they<br/>
&gt; added several patches ago for Necros and SKs, Shadow Vortex do?<br/>
&gt; Anyone who knows I&#39;d love to hear the answer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no clue what that spell does. I started myself a dark elven SK, this<br/>
on the heals of my now-retired 31 dark elven warrior. I&#39;m level 13 with the<br/>
SK now, and loving it. I don&#39;t know that much about the life of an SK, so if<br/>
you&#39;d like to describe your own SK and/or tactics, I&#39;d love to hear it. This<br/>
may not answer your question, but it may get the list moving again.<br/>
