<div id="ygrps-yiv-432562280">I am working on this quest, and have made alot of progress, except<br/>
for a nasty bug at what may or may not be the end (I&#39;m not speaking<br/>
of Lady Shae).  Though I&#39;m not giving out any spoilers, I&#39;m wondering<br/>
if anyone else has pursued this quest, and would be willing to talk<br/>
with me about it.  I spent several hours on it, and was very<br/>
disappointed.  Please email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cpaul@...">cpaul@...</a> to discuss it.<br/>
