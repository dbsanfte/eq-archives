<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061395891">You kind of missed my point(s).  What I was asking is why do you think Human SK in particular need to be tweeked?  <br/>
<br/>
1) Human SK&#39;s in solo combat.  A human SK should be better in one on one combat than an equivalent level Paladin (LoH and HT aside).  So why do SK&#39;s in particular need to be improved?<br/>
<br/>
2) Humans are generally inferior to their non-human counterparts on a per-encounter basis.  This is true for all classes and is balanced out by the Human exp bonus and other racial exp penalties.<br/>
<br/>
3) KoS makes the game harder for SK&#39;s.  This is a game difficulty issue IMHO.  That&#39;s why you have the difficulty ratings at character creation because all race/class combos are not as easy as anothers.  My KoS problem as a TSK is far worse than any Human SK.  I don&#39;t see you saying that Troll SK&#39;s need improvement.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to understand where the Human SK&#39;s are coming from.  I personally think you have it easier than us TSK&#39;s, so why should Human SK&#39;s be improved and not Trolls, Ogres, & DE&#39;s as well.  Sure, I can solo better than you can up until around level 20, but after that it&#39;s pretty much out as a viable leveling option.<br/>

A human SK will have a tougher time than a human paladin if for no other reason than they&#39;re KOS in a lot more places.  Being evil<br/>
really puts you at a disadvantage, especially at earlier levels.  Sure, you do level faster, but on a per-encounter basis you&#39;re<br/>
going to be more powerful if you&#39;re a non-human.<br/>
<br/>
And in general, I&#39;m fairly confident that a dwarven or high elf paladin will fare much better than a human better (racial bonuses<br/>
are somewhat offset by exp penalty I believe).<br/>
