<div id="ygrps-yiv-466300144">That&#39;s okay ... it would be nice to get two mails in one day, even if it is<br/>
the same one! The list is unfortunately rather quiet as of late. :(<br/>
<br/>
lets see if I can help at all.<br/>
<br/>
The merchant in South Ro in the northwest corner sells to evil characters,<br/>
but he is quite expensive unfortunately.<br/>
The dark elves in the middle of the S Ro desert now sell combines, so you<br/>
can buy one.I think they might sell food and water too.<br/>
If you haven&#39;t been out of Innothule Swamp yet, how do you know you are<br/>
dubious in Neriak? I have known many many cazic thule worshipping trolls and<br/>
they don&#39;t have any problems getting around in Neriak. I&#39;d suggest trying<br/>
that again.<br/>
<br/>
You can buy from the centaurs in S Karana (long time before you get there<br/>
though)<br/>
<br/>
It used to be that if you bought Buer or something like that, in the<br/>
freeport underground, beer, he&#39;d give you faction with the militia. For now<br/>
that is taken out, but if it is fixed, it is a relatively easy, if somewhat<br/>
expensive, way to get freeport faction. I helped one or two trolls be abe to<br/>
walk into Freeport. It&#39;s a sight to see.<br/>
<br/>
All that comes to mind right now, but I&#39;m sure that there is more.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the (quiet) list.</div>
