On the FA quest.. Nice if it exist, but what I want is a quest anywhere like<br/>
this. Having to go to all those locations, do all those task. That is a<br/>
quest. Sitting on my ass in Cazic waiting for a Crusader is not a quest it&#39;s<br/>
a exercise in futility. Hell look at the Soul Fire quest, again a nice drawn<br/>
out quest (difficult in parts, easy in others), but again it&#39;s a quest not a<br/>
camping exercise.. What I would give for one decent quest..<br/>

heh...the avenger quest posted is full of holes =) complete bs imo.<br/>
<br/>
we are THE minority in eq. that should explain it all. i can name every sk <br/>
on my server over lv30...and count every sk over lv40 on one hand...with the<br/>
<br/>
total number being somewhere under 40. i assume the situation is rather <br/>
similar on your worlds as well.<br/>
<br/>
but even so...some of the changes and &quot;nerfs&quot; we face almost seem to say <br/>
&quot;don&#39;t play this class&quot; as if we&#39;ll all dissappear and the whole class can <br/>
be removed =)<br/>
<br/>
if i recall correctly the original effect of the soul leech was &quot;supposed to<br/>
<br/>
be&quot; a high level 392hp lifetap (the leech and bladestorm weren&#39;t proc&#39;n back<br/>
<br/>
then iirc)...which fits with the godly 345dmg x3 bladestorm proc <br/>
etc...seeing it tap for 50 (first of heard of this) is downright <br/>
laughable...as are the stats on most of our armor so far (9 sta was good for<br/>
<br/>
exactly 19 hp the last time i checked at lv30).<br/>
<br/>
they said the class/race combination was of &quot;high difficulty&quot; in the <br/>
beginning...so, i guess all this is justified by that =)<br/>
<br/>
(really annoying when i&#39;ve seen brad quote that &quot;high difficulty&quot; bs when <br/>
referring to class gripes such as ours...too bad high difficulty when used <br/>
in reference to sks doesn&#39;t fall in line with the tradion of high rewards in<br/>
<br/>
most games like more areas / a better ending in classic games or a lv49 pet <br/>
spell that can dish quad 55&#39;s with 19 delay daggers in eq).<br/>
<br/>
that&#39;s my whine for today.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;First of all with the new patch has anybody checked the stats on the Dark<br/>
&gt;Forged armor (and hopefully they change the color as well)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the rumor front, supposedly the Fiery Avenger has been found. Rumored<br/>
&gt;stats on sword 33Dmg 33Dly Effect: Combust (180dmg DD or so) Paladin Only.<br/>
&gt;Now I don&#39;t mind that the Paladin&#39;s get a really nice weapon, what gets me<br/>
&gt;is that they can obtain their nice weapons through Quest. I would much<br/>
&gt;rather obtain a kick ass weapon from questing (not camping, but an actual<br/>
&gt;quest) than having to kill a god (Soul Leech, what&#39;s with the 50pt lifetap<br/>
&gt;though???). Well I guess I&#39;ll just have to wait and see if the weapon <br/>
&gt;really<br/>
&gt;does exist.. And who knows maybe the SK&#39;s have some kick ass sword <br/>
&gt;available<br/>
&gt;by a quest (About the same odds as me winning the lottery without buying a<br/>
&gt;ticket).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Enjoy..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
