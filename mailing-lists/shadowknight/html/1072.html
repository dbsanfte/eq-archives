<div id="ygrps-yiv-68670693">last night when i went to pick up some lv39 spells i noticed that our 49 pet <br/>
spell [Haunting Corpse] is no longer usuable. the spell is still on the <br/>
vendor in grobb but it clearly states that the spell is necro only.<br/>
<br/>
did i miss something while i was away? was this pet seen as yet another <br/>
strength that required gimping?<br/>
<br/>
-kg<br/>
<br/>
btw - i despise the term &quot;nerf&quot;. anyone have any suggestions for another <br/>
word i can use to convey the same meaning? =)</div>
