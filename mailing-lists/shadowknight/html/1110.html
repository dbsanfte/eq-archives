  Actually, I am a 33rd level DE sk, and with my reaver I do between 55 and 60 max, my strength with the sword buff is only around 125 or so, now I was grouping with a troll SK the other day, and her strength was near 200, and she was whacking for about 80 points max, now while this is a hug diffeerence in strength, it does show that it does count. <br/>
