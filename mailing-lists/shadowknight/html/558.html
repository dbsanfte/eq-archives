 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m level 26 now, and yes, I&#39;d have to say that level 22 was pivotal in my<br/>
career as an SK. You get Engulfing Darkness, an upgrade of Clinging<br/>
Darkness. Whereas CD does 20hp over 30 seconds, ED does 90hp over 60<br/>
seconds, a big difference. Plus you get Vampiric Embrace, which some say is<br/>
almost useless, but it goes off more and more depending on your Dex and your<br/>
level (not to mention sucking more damage). Level 22 spells also include<br/>
some more Vs Undead type spells, making Unrest a lot easier (i.e., go get<br/>
some small bronze now if you haven&#39;t already).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1H Slashing Weapon with bash?  Hehe, and don&#39;t tell me it depends on the<br/>
&gt; weapon... my question is overall.... Just wondering because if 2H Slashing<br/>
&gt; is better then I&#39;ll have to start lvling it up..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used 2HS for a long time (first 24 lvls as an SK, and all 31 lvls of my<br/>
warrior before that) and it was a big decision but I decided to go to 1HS. I<br/>
now use a demon claw and a chitin shield. With our dark elven agility, I<br/>
squeeze another 23 AC outta that 15 AC shield, not to mention the<br/>
bash-then-cast strategy helps get a LOT more spells off. If you&#39;re gonna be<br/>
solo&#39;ing, use the shield and 1hs, because you&#39;re fights will take longer but<br/>
you&#39;ll end up less hurt. In a group, go for outright damage dealing with a<br/>
good 2H sword. You&#39;ll have heals and backup, so just concentrate on kicking<br/>
ass, rather than hiding behind a shield. As a side note, VE does seem to go<br/>
off significantly more often with a demon claw than with a zweihander (not<br/>
sure it makes up for the damage difference though).<br/>
