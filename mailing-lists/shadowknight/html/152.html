I quit my sk about 8 times.. keep comin back.. I&#39;mm now level 17. Why ppl <br/>
suck with their sk is because they misuyse him.. He is not a spellcaster.. <br/>
he is not a tank. Tank.. Use yer pet fer extra damage(not to aabsorb) Blast <br/>
all yer mana with what spells you have. Combined.. you are a monster. So you <br/>
cant heal.. neither can mages or straight warriors, rogues, monks. were not <br/>
alone. If you want to heeal.. be a cleric, see how fun that is. the SK can <br/>
do more than most any other class save ranger and paladin. Use all your <br/>
facets to their full extent. Currently, I am in unrest at level 17 tanking <br/>
for higher level players. Al lthey need is my ac and decent hp&#39;s to heep teh <br/>
beasties busy.. All these beasties are red to me but with a solid group, i <br/>
never get below 3 bubbles and, i have made 7- plat and 5 bubbles of exp ind <br/>
one night. Shadowknights arent easy. It says in the creation and everey <br/>
website thay are. While i do agree we are underpowered comparatively, we are <br/>
not useless.<br/>
<br/>
I have been a welcome addition to many parties and continue to gain riches, <br/>
fame and levels.<br/>
