<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828485704">I play a lev 9 Ogre SK and in my opinion, the best SK&#39;s I&#39;ve seen are<br/>
trolls.  Because of their regen they seem to get experience faster than<br/>
ogres and have an advantage in str and stamina over De and human SK&#39;s.<br/>
The higher int of de and humans will help in overall ability increases,<br/>
but even as an ogre, I&#39;ve maxed out everything I&#39;ve wanted to every time<br/>
I&#39;ve leveled so far simply because it takes me so long.  If I were going<br/>
to start a SK over, I&#39;d do a troll and dump my extra points into either<br/>
int and agiliy or int and dex.  they already got plenty of str and stamina<br/>
and charisma is for those pretty good races as far as I&#39;m concerned.  Also<br/>
in light of the fact that I have so many misses when fighting and that<br/>
Vampiric embrace seems to be dex dependant now, i&#39;d probably go with Int<br/>
and Dex.  As far as places to go, I don&#39;t know about the DE or human<br/>
playgrounds at lower levels, but I&#39;ve like both the Feerot and Innothule<br/>
once I stopped getting lost.  The easiest way to do that is just stay<br/>
close to the roads or boundaries.  By the time you get locate corpse, you<br/>
probably won&#39;t need it.  By then you know where everything is and where<br/>
you died.  Anyway, Good luck with whatever you choose and be ready to<br/>
level slowly...<br/>
