&gt; You are correct, the damage shields were far too powerful if put on a big SK<br/>
&gt; (ogre/troll).  Your comments about Shadow Step are interesting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lifetap/spike/draw would be used near the end of a melee in a group -- you<br/>
&gt; could use it as a quick heal to minimize downtime.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And personally, it has always been my idea that an SK feeds off the life<br/>
&gt; force of the weak, so after a fight walking around and sucking the life out<br/>
&gt; of gnolls and orcs sounds very in character...<br/>

trade Reclaim Energy, Mend Bones, and Voice Graft for <br/>
Lifetap, Lifespike, and Lifedraw respectively?  That trades<br/>
a Rank 1, 3 and 5 spell for a rank 1, 2 and 4 spell.<br/>
