<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156486406">At level 22 We do get a couple good spells.<br/>
Engulfing Darkness being probably the best combat<br/>
wise. At least at first, you can stack it with disease<br/>
cloud and clinging darkness. Eventually neither<br/>
clinging or disease cloud will work on anything, but<br/>
at 22, it still worked on most things i was fighting<br/>
at the time.<br/>
Vampiric Embrace isnt nearly as pathetic as i was<br/>
anticipating. At first it only drains 12 points of<br/>
damage. But it goes up 1 point every 2 levels.So at<br/>
24, it did 13, at 26, 14 and so on. PLus it can go off<br/>
even when your swing misses. So instead of a big<br/>
nothing, you do 12 damage and get 12 HP back. It is<br/>
unpredictable though. I can go thru 2 fights and not<br/>
have it go off at all, or it can go off 3 or 4 times<br/>
in one battle. But i cast it before every fight.<br/>
And the last of the 22 spells that i use is Deadeye.<br/>
This grants Infravision, which dark Elves, Ogres and<br/>
Trolls dont care about in itself. But, Deadeye also<br/>
lets you see invisible players. So no more sneaky<br/>
Wizards creeping up on you. <br/>
Ward Undead i havent used seriously, but this may<br/>
change when i head to Unrest or a nostalgic trip into<br/>
Befallen. Though i have a feeling it will be resisted<br/>
alot, but im used to that now.<br/>
<br/>
So, your question about becoming very powerful at 22,<br/>
the answer is no. More powerful, yes. <br/>
But level 30. Heat Blood. Bwhahaha. If youve ever had<br/>
that spell cast on you, you know how good it is. Plus<br/>
Invisibility, at long last.<br/>
Dont expect to be invincible at 22 by any stretch of<br/>
the imagination, but you should start to see how good<br/>
things will be getting.<br/>
Plus at 20, double attack. This has changed melee into<br/>
a whole new game for me.<br/>
<br/>
now as far as 2H slashing vs. 1H slashing.<br/>
If you want one to be chosen over the other, my<br/>
opinion is 2H. The reason being is that so far, all<br/>
the really great weapons in the game that a SK can<br/>
actually use, are all 2H Slashing. Dark Reaver, Giant<br/>
Zwizzlestick (or whatever its called), FleshRipper to<br/>
name a few.<br/>
So definitely get your 2H going.<br/>
But i wiil say, fighting a caster with a 2H bites.<br/>
They are slower than most 1H slashing, so the caster<br/>
gets off more spells, which is bad news for you.<br/>
Unfortunately, my STR isnt enough to carry both around<br/>
with me, so ive been sticking with 2H for now. But<br/>
eventualy will switch back to 1H to freshen it up.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps you out.<br/>

&gt; Hello my fellow Shadow Knights,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a Dark Elf, LVL 19, and i have a question for u<br/>
&gt; LVL 22&#39;s and above.  My<br/>
&gt; question is,  &quot;Do we SK&#39;s become very powerful at<br/>
&gt; LVL 22?&quot;  The reason that<br/>
&gt; i ask this is because i&#39;ve heard a few people say<br/>
&gt; that if u hold on and keep<br/>
&gt; playing and hit lvl 22 that u won&#39;t be disappointed.<br/>
&gt;  As of right now i<br/>
&gt; basically am a weak warrior with a few weak spells. <br/>
&gt; Do our spells improve<br/>
&gt; greatly?  I sure hope so, because from what i&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been told SK&#39;s are one of<br/>
&gt; the strongest high lvl classes there is... so let me<br/>
&gt; know something u higher<br/>
&gt; lvl players!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One last question... Which is better using a 2H<br/>
&gt; Slashing weapon our using a<br/>
&gt; 1H Slashing Weapon with bash?  Hehe, and don&#39;t tell<br/>
&gt; me it depends on the<br/>
&gt; weapon... my question is overall.... Just wondering<br/>
&gt; because if 2H Slashing<br/>
&gt; is better then I&#39;ll have to start lvling it up..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks Brothers,<br/>
