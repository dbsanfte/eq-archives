<div id="ygrps-yiv-754363044">Dark Elves can easily jump on the boat at Freeport, sail to butcherblock,<br/>
jump off early, and go to greater faydark or wherever.<br/>
To return, you simply have to swim around the blocked dock area, and ensure<br/>
that you don&#39;t get too close to a certain High Elf npc who stands near the<br/>
steps up to the dock you need to get to to get on the ship (jump onto the<br/>
highest point possible and the npc will not attack you since you won&#39;t be<br/>
close enough). Once you&#39;re up, you simply wait for the ship like anyone<br/>
else, there are no more npcs to get in your way.<br/>
Unfortunately I doubt any of this would work with Trolls or Ogres, since the<br/>
npcs who do not attack DE&quot;s probably do attack Trolls and Ogres.<br/>
Con the npcs to find out for sure tho, although invis is always the safest<br/>
bet.<br/>

hmm, if a bunch of evil races jump off a ship, then how do they get back on<br/>
the ship when they are done at the islands? We have never even seen this<br/>
ship, is there npc that will kos us?<br/>

&gt; With one of my other characters...on my way from Kaladim to Freeport...in<br/>
&gt; the Ocean of Tears...i noticed and BUNCH of islands with camps and fires<br/>
&gt; burning...not too mention that one hill giant swimming towards the<br/>
&gt; boat...that was kinda scary....  I would say try out some to the<br/>
&gt; islands....i noticed some places along antonica have boats that you can<br/>
&gt; take off in.,  If you could find one....<br/>
