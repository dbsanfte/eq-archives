<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473853959">First off, I think that the pets kinda do stink. Necromancers get <br/>
Leering Corpse at 4th, we get it at 9th. They get Bone walk at 8th and <br/>
we get it at 15th. Now.. this idea may make Shadow knights a bit <br/>
powered up at 9th, but I think maybe SK&#39;s should get another pet level <br/>
up at their level. Like at 9th they get Bone Walk. By the time we get <br/>
our next rank, we get the 12th level pet, a few levels after the <br/>
necromancer, plus they&#39;ll be getting a better one at 16, while we get <br/>
that one at 22, by which time they already have a better one then what <br/>
we&#39;ll get. Would look something like this<br/>
<br/>
Convorting Bones<br/>
  Necro: 8th<br/>
  SK: 9th<br/>
Convoke Shadow:<br/>
  Necro 12th<br/>
  SK: 15th<br/>
Restless Bones<br/>
  Necro: 16th<br/>
  SK: 22nd<br/>
Animate Dead:<br/>
  Necro 20th<br/>
  SK: 30th<br/>
Haunting Corpse:<br/>
  Necro 24th<br/>
  SK: 39th<br/>
Summon Dead<br/>
  Necro 29th<br/>
  SK: 49th<br/>
<br/>
So, at 9th level I suppose our pet might be just a bit to strong, but <br/>
seeing as Leering Corpse isn&#39;t much while Paladins at level 9 will get <br/>
to heal themselves and others, cure poison, and get a +AC/HP spell... <br/>
well two actually, one that lasts just 18 seconds while the other <br/>
lasts a while. At 15th they&#39;ll get to Cure Disease, summon a magic <br/>
weapon (so it&#39;s 1h blunt.. it&#39;s still magic, we only have disease <br/>
cloud and engulfing darkness to do &quot;magic&quot; damage, if we want a weapon <br/>
we need a magician to get a magic weapon, or buy a 50+ plat combine <br/>
one..), heal themselves and others better, have another +AC spell, <br/>
lull any monster (not just undead, that we get at 15), and get their  <br/>
Ward Undead spell at 15. <br/>
<br/>
The being able to summon a magic weapon is another reason for the <br/>
reason to increase out pets &quot;level&quot; by one.. because I believe that <br/>
Convoke shadow pets can hit magic things also. That way we would have <br/>
a way to hit magic creatures a little easier also. <br/>
<br/>
Lets move on to Rank 3 spells..<br/>
<br/>
Paladins receieve another +AC/HP spell, resist poison, a light spell, <br/>
ability to restore stamina &lt;I think this means restore lost fatigue <br/>
(I&#39;m looking at eq.stratic.com spell lists for SK and paladin..) get <br/>
thier invis. to undead spell, lower a targets strength, and the nice <br/>
helpfull spell when things run away: root.<br/>
We get, at this time, convoke shadow, a heal other spell-harm <br/>
ourselves spell, see invis and in the night &lt;big whoop unless you&#39;re a <br/>
human&gt;, another DoT spell, a Fear the Undead spell, Vampiric Brace <br/>
&lt;which, according to all you which is all I really know about the <br/>
spell, doesn&#39;t even work properly&gt;, and our DD spell for Undead.<br/>
<br/>
On to Rank 4, which is the last list for both Paladins and SK&#39;s on <br/>
this web site..<br/>
<br/>
Paladins recieve a better DD to undead only (Expluse Dead, 8-80) a <br/>
summoned magic warhammer (Hammer of Striking) , a better healing spell <br/>
(Healing, for all those who want the exact name, which does 4-40 <br/>
hp), an improved Lull (Soothe), another +AC spell (Spirit Armor), a <br/>
prevent a target from moving spell (Stun), and a +HP spell.. (Symbol <br/>
of Transal).<br/>
We get a plus to resisting disease spell (Endure Disease), a fake <br/>
death spell (Feign death), our invisibility spell (finally, Gather <br/>
Shadows), another DoT Spell (Heat Blood), another pet spell (Restless <br/>
Bones), a talk through out pet spell (can you say useless? I knew that <br/>
you could, Voice Graft), and a area effect lower strength spell (Wave <br/>
of Enfeeblement... has anyone really seen any difference in a monster <br/>
when they&#39;ve been &#39;weakened&#39;? I&#39;m not saying this spell is useless, <br/>
but I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve seen a  difference between a &quot;weakened&quot; strength <br/>
wise monsters to one that isn&#39;t..)<br/>
<br/>
Well that&#39;s it spell wise.. and this is longer then I thought I&#39;d <br/>
ramble on about. So far all I see from the difference spell wise is <br/>
that Paladins can heal alot and we get Damage of Time spells and one, <br/>
to current knowledge, non-working Vampiric Touch spell.. <br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t really know what spells we get at 39th or mostly at <br/>
49.. I think at 49th we get area effect direct damage spell, called <br/>
Word of Shadow, which is also a Cleric spell and Necromancer spell. I <br/>
think it does damage to those around the caster sense it&#39;s like a <br/>
spoken word and only those near by will get effected. <br/>
<br/>
As for Harm Touch.. eh.. I use it for emergencies and have only seen a <br/>
few &lt;about 20&gt; of the damage resist off it from whatever I was <br/>
fighting.. I haven&#39;t had it resisted all together yet though... I <br/>
don&#39;t really care all that much if they do anything to it or not, <br/>
unless of course they make it worse, should they tinker with it all. <br/>
<br/>
Well.. I&#39;m done.. and I&#39;m sure some people will disagree with <br/>
everything I&#39;ve said, part of what I said, or agree with all of it, or <br/>
agree with some of it... to each their own &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
