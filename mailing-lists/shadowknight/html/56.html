<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621132342">Have any of you done the message to Freeport yet.  I talked with one of<br/>
the Guild Masters in Neriak and he gave me a quest to talk to a spy in<br/>
Freeport.  I have been Freeport and even in the guild....and I can&#39;t seem<br/>
to find the guy I&#39;m looking for...maybe I have the wrong name written down<br/>
or something....Anyone else ever do this quest?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
p.s.  Yes Dark Elves can wander into Freeport....as long as the guards<br/>
/CON as dubiously at least.</div>
