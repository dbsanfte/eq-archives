<div id="ygrps-yiv-307131909">I attempted the Sk quest in wich you must kill groflah steadirt just<br/>
now, and his corpse dissapeared with no<br/>
note! i wouldnt mind attempting it again but now all merchants are<br/>
apprehensive to me(except for the Sk ones) and it would be a pain to do<br/>
this over and over and lose all my faction points. Was anyone successful<br/>
in this quest?<br/>
