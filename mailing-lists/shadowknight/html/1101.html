<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585319665">I have yet to see any Noticable Differance from the big races to the little races. The big races have more STR and Stamina, and have to get agility/dex items. The smaller races gather more of the +STR items. Str and Stamina do not seem to have any REALLY great noticable effects. I know STr affects attack, etc..<br/>
<br/>
But, has anyone noticed a level 40 ogre SK doing far greater Damage than a level 40 DE sk? I havent.<br/>
Course Troll regen is nice for soloing, shrug. Not complaining, just STR doesnt seem to have the affect for warrior types as it has on other muds or roleplaying games. I guess the slam advantage is ok when your fighting casters. Not sure its worth all the racial penalties though, heh. Least they got shrink now...8)<br/>
