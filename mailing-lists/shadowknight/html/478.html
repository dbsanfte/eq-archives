<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833627586">Well, I was wondering what to fight when level 15?  I have been hunting<br/>
Young Kodies, and weak Kodies in west commons but find the respawn rate bad.<br/>
I have been trying to stick to blue things, but do look at attacking even<br/>
Kodies, but have a huge down time for doing that.  I stay away from yellows<br/>
if pet doesn&#39;t become &quot;milk bone&quot; for the bear (then I run).  I have been<br/>
hunting alone, group hasn&#39;t been on as much, maybe need to find another<br/>
group now.  I tried to kill Derv thugs in west commons but their are 2 spell<br/>
casters grouped and stealing every kill from me, so it is not an option<br/>
(they have done it to me about 4 times so far) unless I use harm touch and<br/>
pet I bet I could out damage them.<br/>
<br/>
I found killing Young Kodies + giant spiders alone pushed me through level<br/>
14 slowly plus made about 25 plat for the entire level (then spent 14plat<br/>
for the level 15 spells), oh group did log in and we hunted in fire storm<br/>
for a few hours and I got a bubble and a half + about 4 plat. Note: pick up<br/>
balstic eggs worth just over 8 gold each (someone left the body I picked up<br/>
the eggs to sell, why not easy money and saw the price).<br/>
<br/>
As for HH, I attacked some named orc just out side of hh pass, loc -500<br/>
4300, somewhere around their just watch out for the village, and someone<br/>
told me that he was like killing 10 orcs in high hold pass, for just killing<br/>
him.  He coned blue to me, but I was just exploring and didn&#39;t have pet out,<br/>
used HT and it didn&#39;t drop him (I figure he has about 300hp, as I did 303hp<br/>
to him total), but he died none the less and me with 2 bubbles left.  I was<br/>
told watch out for his friend that spawns with him on occasion.  Oh, and he<br/>
bashes, which I really don&#39;t like.  Plus what are you suppose to do with the<br/>
orc scalp?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway anyone know where to hunt alone when you are level 15, no magic<br/>
weapon yet, and not a whole lot of banded armor yet.  Or just stick to west<br/>
commons.  Don&#39;t like mummy&#39;s because of the rabies thing.<br/>

That was a really good response Beld.  I currently play an ogre shadowknight<br/>
lvl 22 on Povar.  I haven&#39;t really tried the fear and then chase to get a<br/>
few hits in, but I definitly like the sound of it.  I normally hit with a<br/>
darkness spell, then a str sapping spell and melee away.  My warrior side is<br/>
much better than my spell casting side, so I play the tank mostly.  I always<br/>
try to group with a cleric if possible.  Also, I TOTALLY agree with having<br/>
your pet, I even try to get one when in a group.  This morning I was<br/>
fighting in Highpass Hold (MY GOD, how many do I have to kill before I can<br/>
go into HH :)  )  and they drop a lot of the rusty weapons.  I gave my pet a<br/>
rusty mace and he was hitting in the range of 15-18.  Very nice little<br/>
addition.<br/>
<br/>
I have almost full bronze on finally, with a few exceptions.  I have a<br/>
grotesque mask, and I finally got a greater zweihander (sp), which reminds<br/>
me, i&#39;m selling a  2handed well balanced, magical axe on that server which<br/>
normally sells for about 550 from the shady guy in the ecommons/nro tunnel.<br/>
I&#39;m selling it for around 300 if anyone is interested.  I am also curious as<br/>
to what type of armour/items other ogre sk&#39;s are wearing and any suggestoins<br/>
they might have.<br/>
