<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846715522">xilith, the soulfire really ISNT a very good weapon. in fact its pretty<br/>
crappy once you get past the eye candy part. sure the stats are NICE, but by<br/>
the time you can actually obtain one without a major twink job, and<br/>
considering a paladin who wants it more or less has to continue the quest<br/>
through most of his paladin career, it is just complete junk when set beside<br/>
a mithril 2h sword or a razing sword of skarlton. yes i know those two<br/>
weapons are very difficult to obtain, but there is a big difference between<br/>
several hours of camping and several months of active questing :) which does<br/>
kind of confuse me.. since it is one of the hardest weapons in the game to<br/>
obtain (not to mention limited to a specific class) why is it so chintzy?<br/>
not asking for an answer, just a not so subtle suggestion that any sk quest<br/>
swords be made a bit more utilitarian ;)<br/>
