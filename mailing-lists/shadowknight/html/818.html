<b>Subject:</b> SK sword akin to Soulfire? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066125710">Just wondering, since presumably the Dark Reaver is our counterpart<br/>
to Ghoulbane, if any quest or loot obtainable SK sword akin to Soulfire<br/>
has been found, or any rumors/ideas about this?<br/>
<br/>
Soulfire is just too cool looking, and an excellent weapon to boot.<br/>
I guess what I really want is a long term quest that isn&#39;t broken,<br/>
and you don&#39;t have to be an enchanter to do =)<br/>
<br/>
I hail my entire guild every time I&#39;m in Neriak, and am trying to<br/>
get faction with the Blood Sabres and Freeport SK guild, but I&#39;m still<br/>
at a loss for quests, and camping is getting really boring.<br/>
