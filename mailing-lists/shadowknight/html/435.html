<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062910885">Well, I am a necro, my wife is a SK. I have never even use vampiric embrace,<br/>
as most other necros dont either..we dont have the slots. One reason it may<br/>
be doing more damage is do to skill level with the spell...<br/>
Not sure if it it true in this case or not, but please, SK,  Make sure you<br/>
get those spell abilities up to speed... I see it time and time again,<br/>
although in mid twenties the ones that are still playing have figured it<br/>
out..<br/>
Keep your spell skills high, use archery and never underestimate the power<br/>
of a fear spell...<br/>

&gt; Yes, I have to agree with Lief on that too. I would be fantastic to have,<br/>
&gt; but I doubt it will ever be implemented.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What I think might be more feasible would be for Verant to increase the<br/>
&gt; power of Vampiric Embrace so that it works exactly the same for both<br/>
Necros<br/>
&gt; and Shadow Knights. As near as I can tell, when we get it at level 22,<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; effectiveness is already weaker then a Necromancer of around level 8. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; heard of many Necro&#39;s stating that it taps for 30+ a whack for them in the<br/>
&gt; late teens, increasing by a point or so around every level. However, it<br/>
&gt; seems that when we get the spell it is much weaker then a level 8 Necro&#39;s<br/>
VE<br/>
&gt; - which is why it taps for just six points or so at the start for us<br/>
(which<br/>
&gt; is in reality pretty useless). My Necro friend just confirmed that when<br/>
&gt; Necro&#39;s get this spell around level 8, they tap for around 20 a whack. Why<br/>
&gt; is it that when we get it, it starts at six?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I&#39;m only a paltry level 13, so I can&#39;t confirm the Vampiric Embrace<br/>
&gt; performance for Shadow Knights myself. But, from what I have been able to<br/>
&gt; gather from message boards, this spell is definitely performing<br/>
differently<br/>
&gt; for us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My only other suggestion would be for Voice Graft to be replaced with<br/>
Hungry<br/>
&gt; Earth, a Necromancer spell of comparison level that would fit into our DOT<br/>
&gt; theme as well providing a much needed Root type of spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my two cents.<br/>
