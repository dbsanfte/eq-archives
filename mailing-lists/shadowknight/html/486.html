<div id="ygrps-yiv-642762693">If you guys like clinging darkness, you&#39;ll love Engulfing!! It is a major<br/>
upgrade that lasts much longer and does more dmg. It does cost mroe mana<br/>
though so you may want to keep both memed until about lvl 24 or so. That way<br/>
you have that emergancy runner stopper.<br/>
<br/>
Advice to people reaching lvl 22. You&#39;re Evoke skill will be next to nothing<br/>
having not had a spell to do. Cast a pet and then cast Ward undead on it to<br/>
get yuor skill up. It took me about 3 hours, but is well worth it if you<br/>
plan to hunt undead. Also, cast Endure Cold since this will keep your<br/>
abjeration skill up I think. I found to my horror that it is still on 55 for<br/>
me at lvl 27! What a slacker! 8)<br/>
<br/>
1H vs 2H - this argument will go on until the end of time. My thought? Use<br/>
both! Carry both types of weapon around and keep them maxed out. This will<br/>
prepare you for all situations and also help you to find which you prefer<br/>
using. Which is better is almost totally weapon based. 2H is generally<br/>
better then 1H, but I would preffer a PGT to a FS 2H any day!<br/>
<br/>
As for HT, I too used to keep it for an emergancy, butfrmo about lvl 24<br/>
onwards it isn&#39;t all that great so I try to comromise and use it as often as<br/>
possible while looking for the best time to use, multiple opponents etc. At<br/>
lvl 27 , 271 dmg just isn&#39;t all that great. the max dmg I&#39;ve done in a round<br/>
is 102 ( double attack 40, 48 and a Vamp for 14) so it only takes a few<br/>
rounds to make tht sort of dmg. before lvl 24 though it is often a<br/>
lifesaver! 8)<br/>
<br/>
If you get a chance to party with a rogue do it! Between your ability to<br/>
attract monsters and their backstab you&#39;ll do well. I partied with a lvl 27<br/>
rogue when 24 and the mob never even looked at her despite backstabb for<br/>
60&#39;s +<br/>
<br/>
At lvl 20 or so when you start to get more financially well, build you&#39;re<br/>
bind wound skill. I have found this to be invaluable. I&#39;ve maxed it at 100<br/>
which is as high as it goes. It heals about 25 or 30 HP per bandage at that<br/>
skill which is quite nice to cut down on down time. It is good even when<br/>
with a healer since it saves them mana and I&#39;m sure everyone&#39;s had a battle<br/>
where their whole party is under 1 bub and no one has mana and someone yells<br/>
Train! 8)<br/>
<br/>
That should just about do it for the moment. If anyone has any questions<br/>
don;t hesitate to ask! we&#39;re all here to help! 8)<br/>
