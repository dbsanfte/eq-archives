<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103233854">I&#39;d just like to say that from what I&#39;ve heard, all classes are suppose to<br/>
be equal, ESPECIALY in the high levels.  One of the things that Verant has<br/>
been  bragging about for a long time is the fact that a level 50 warrior<br/>
could stand toe to toe with a level 50 wizzard or a level 50 shadow knight<br/>
and the chances of winning would be 50-50.  Of course, I&#39;ve never actualy<br/>
passed level 20 so I wouldn&#39;t know...Equiptment is suppose to be one of the<br/>
equaling factors.  Warriors are suppose to get a shitload of kewl weaps and<br/>
armer that no other class can, and so on.  But I have to agree, looking at<br/>
the game in turms of my lvl 7 shadow knight, I look pretty danm weak.  Just<br/>
my two cents<br/>
