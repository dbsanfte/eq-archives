<div id="ygrps-yiv-135146168">Well, last night I got on as Cronik, finally.  The guild <br/>
was very happy to see me. Made me feel better.<br/>
The rest of the night totally bombed! I lagged horrible <br/>
75% of the time I was on, was booted from my ISP 3 <br/>
times, and played &quot;Dodge the Cyclops and Aviak Evocate&quot; <br/>
while my screen froze up on me.<br/>
The trip to Splitpaw was actually uneventful thank Thule!<br/>
I had screen freeze most of the way and it took me 10 <br/>
minutes to get there from the Lake Rathe side. <br/>
After guild stuff and all the frustration of just trying <br/>
to cross zones I logged off as soon as I made it into <br/>
Splitpaw. I was not lagged at all the moment I got there <br/>
which made me feel better, but the way the night had <br/>
already gone, I logged off. Fate had been warning me all <br/>
night.<br/>
Hopefully I can get the Snakeskin Jerkin/Gloves/Mask(?) <br/>
and a RTS for my Druid. I will be solo so it will be <br/>
rough. Hopefully I can get a group started to help me.  <br/>
Loot is good there anyway, so I will be dropping <br/>
anything but armor (cloth or snakeskin) and FS/Bronze <br/>
weapons if I can get any that is. :)<br/>
