<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085371538">It&#39;s hard;y a bug exploits. they use the arhcrey skill due to the aim factor.<br/>
And the fact that they have such a pathetic damage. somthing like 1,  tends to<br/>
suggest this. I would suggest to wait to hear back from some one in authority<br/>
before declaring something to be a bug exploit.<br/>

&gt; The tiny daggers and pine needles are *extremely likley* bugged melee<br/>
&gt; weapons. I have seen them and tested them just enough to make sure they are<br/>
&gt; actually bugged, and then I have /bug&#39;d them and continued on my way. They<br/>
&gt; are melee weapons and help in the melee slot, there is absolutely no reason<br/>
&gt; they should help out your archery skill. It would be very cheap and possibly<br/>
&gt; an exploit to use these.<br/>
