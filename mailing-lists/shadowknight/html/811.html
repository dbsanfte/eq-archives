<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422615866">With my crappy fire save (14 with 2 rings of fire <br/>
protection) Lavastorm has a large heal time. Plus the <br/>
trains to the zones by people that fight in the path <br/>
that the Imps and Elementals wander, is enough to drive <br/>
you nuts. I noticed that a ele or imp or drake wanders <br/>
just outside the doors of Najena  from the valley on the <br/>
right to the valley on the left 20 minutes after <br/>
fighting in that area.<br/>
I have faught there quite a bit. Loot is great, when it <br/>
is dropped. ;) Is how I got the guild jeweler all his <br/>
starting materials until those stones became trivial.  I <br/>
still give them to him to sell so he can buy the stones <br/>
he needs. He has a better charisma than me. ;) Suprise.<br/>
Thanks for the adbise though.  I am just bored with the <br/>
zones I tend to fight in. Halas would be gret, but the <br/>
trek from Qeynos would drive me nuts, especially through <br/>
BB.  BB may be fun, but I&#39;m afraid it would be like <br/>
another Splitpaw.  Plus to get there alive would be a <br/>
venture in itself.<br/>

&gt;&gt; place for a 15th level SK to get to/adventure solo while<br/>
&gt;&gt; looking for a group? KoS is a big factor here.  :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lavastorm maybe?<br/>
