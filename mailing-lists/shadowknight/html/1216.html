&gt;Mino hero doesn&#39;t spawn in the caves I don&#39;t think.  I think he<br/>
&gt;spawns south of the caves behind the big gears.  Seems to be on a<br/>
&gt;2-4 hour spawnn, perhaps killing the wandering Mino&#39;s in Steamfont<br/>
&gt;helps?<br/>

get the Hero to spawn faster take out Melderath and his guards (Evil Gnome<br/>
with 2 Mino Guards), as soon as they fall the Hero usually spawns.<br/>
