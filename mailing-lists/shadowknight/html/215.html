<div id="ygrps-yiv-672644043">levels don&#39;t work quite that way...if someone is a level higher they<br/>
should be a little better depending on their training path of course....if<br/>
you take two fighters....exactly the same training paths and put them so 1<br/>
is 15 and one is 16...the 16 should win because he will have more HP and<br/>
have a little more skill...but all in all...its going to be a good fight.<br/>
1 level difference should not make that much difference...but 3 or 4+<br/>
levels should, especially in a multiple level game.<br/>
