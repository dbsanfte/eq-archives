<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-910213125">Well, last night was a very good night for me... I think.<br/>
I finally got the Grobb Cleaver!<br/>
I have been seeing someone auction &quot;Grobb Cleaver for <br/>
sale give tell.&quot; for the last couple of days.  I have <br/>
been wishing like crazy that I could afford it, but when <br/>
asked the person wanted 125PP for it. I had only 10PP on <br/>
me at that time.<br/>
Fighting Dervs and desert undead has been more <br/>
profitable than I thought.  I saw this person yell for a <br/>
SoW to get his corpse, so I gave him a tell and he said <br/>
it was still for sale and he wanted 85PP for it! Hot <br/>
damn!  I had 40 PP in the bank, my FS2HS, a FS <br/>
Warhammer, and a Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra to trade for it.  The <br/>
Skull was a gift from my wife and cost her 12PP.<br/>
Now at At least 15-20PP for the 2HS, and 10-15PP for the <br/>
Warhammer and at cost of 12PP for the Skull, was this a <br/>
good deal?  I have seen auctions for FS2HS that the <br/>
owner wanted 25PP for it. I have no idea really what <br/>
either the FS2HS or Warhammer is worth.  <br/>
The sword was a gift and the hammer ws part of a trade <br/>
with some banded, money, rusty weapons, a box, a <br/>
lightstone and some more junk for my bronze pants.  The <br/>
pants I got from a really kewl guy for 5PP! (Heh, they <br/>
were weighing him down and needed to get rid of them. I <br/>
was 8th level and that was all I had on me.)<br/>
Anyway, what would you have paid for the Grobb Cleaver? <br/>
Did I get a good deal?<br/>
I think I did IMHO which is all that really counts, but <br/>
I still would like to hear thoughts from all of you.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
