<div id="ygrps-yiv-397609096">I had a friend cast Shadow Vortex on me to see what it<br/>
does. It lowered my AC by 7. She didnt say whether<br/>
hers went up or not, so im not sure on that part.<br/>
<br/>
For certain tactics: Darkness/fear.. great.. i use it<br/>
all the time.. you can get several free hits in..but<br/>
as warned before, make sure you know where he is going<br/>
and that he doesnt have any friends.<br/>
<br/>
I also use fear when i am fighting more than one<br/>
creature at a time.. i cast fear on one (no<br/>
darkness..i want him to run far away :)  )  and hack<br/>
at the other. the one i am beating on will either be<br/>
close to death or dead by the time the other one comes<br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
Fear acts weird in the Arena though. it causes the<br/>
target to warp. One time my friend cast it on me and i<br/>
warped to one of the spires. i was then hit by 633<br/>
points of non-melee damage then fell to my death :)<br/>
I bugged it of course.<br/>
<br/>
Shadow Step i have had problems with. Either it puts<br/>
me right next to where i was, puts me thru a zone or<br/>
dumps me into a body of water. Not to say it isnt<br/>
helpful, i have just had bad luck with it so far.<br/>
<br/>
And Harm Touch. When fighting anything that is magic<br/>
hit only, be prepared to be disappointed. BUt on most<br/>
other MOBs , depending on level, it does seem to work<br/>
well. Sometimes you may have to wait until the targets<br/>
HP is below half before it will have a full effect.<br/>
When i hit Broon with it (level 22ish Cyclops) to try<br/>
and pull him off of my friend, it did a whopping 36<br/>
points of damage. My BBC did more in one swing than<br/>
the HT. Broon totally ignored me and continued to<br/>
smack around my friend. Eventually he turned on me,<br/>
giving my friend time to cast and we beat him. But HT<br/>
was worthless that time.<br/>
It can be a last resort however. Usually i do save it<br/>
for an emergency. And when it comes down to hit, i hit<br/>
the hot key and pray to Bertoxxulous. MOst times it<br/>
gets me out of trouble. (example: goblin guard in<br/>
runnyeye. was the last one out of a train, he was<br/>
pounding on me. waited until he was below half, so was<br/>
i too, then HT. He died..i didnt. without HT, i would<br/>
have been kibble). But this is not failsafe of course.<br/>
I have heard some say that they use HT as soon as they<br/>
get it. I see that as a waste. But whatever toots you<br/>
flute.<br/>
<br/>
Thats all for now<br/>
