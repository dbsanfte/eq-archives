<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462892083">Well I was able to get my hands on a Shiny Brass Halberd from someone, it was <br/>
not too bad. dmg 16 (or 17 not too sure, been awhile) and delay of about 48. <br/>
I put it to good use till about lvl 18 when I traded it with cash for a Bone <br/>
bladed Claymore. It was good and they usually go for about 125-150pp and <br/>
that&#39;s on my server. Sol Ro.</div>
