<div id="ygrps-yiv-577430011">the lenya quest seems to have been removed. i&#39;ll give you two guesses, and<br/>
they are probably both right :)<br/>
<br/>
i screwed up about the MM quest hehe.. it DOES work. you just have to say<br/>
the exact right thing to the npc: &quot;how do i get shadow knight armor&quot;. sounds<br/>
obvious maybe, but you shoulda been there with us when we were fielding<br/>
questions..<br/>
<br/>
i still feel the frequent death of the thing and its 6+ hour respawn time<br/>
are legitimate gripes. otherwise, once you get the shopping list for items,<br/>
these quests are practically handed to us compared to the other class armor<br/>
quests.<br/>
