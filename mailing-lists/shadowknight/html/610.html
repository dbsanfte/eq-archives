<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045963284">Actually, your ass is not too wide, just almost too wide. It takes a few<br/>
tries, but can be done. It was hard, and I tried over and over, (i was lost<br/>
and desperate), but, you can fit on the little ledge, but it is hard to do.<br/>

&gt; I found out 2 very good things to know about the<br/>
&gt; Freeport sewer system last night. 1st and most important<br/>
&gt; I can train at the SK guild there. Wohoo. 2nd and most<br/>
&gt; annoying, I cannot walk around the ledge of the pool of<br/>
&gt; water because my troll a$$ is too wide. :( So if I am in<br/>
&gt; Neriak or the commonlands then I can walk to the guild<br/>
&gt; from West FP to East FP and train, but need to leave via<br/>
&gt; East Treeport and Zone through the tunnel to the<br/>
&gt; commonlands. That is still better than going through<br/>
&gt; Oasis and both parts of Ro and the Innothule for half of<br/>
&gt; the trip.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone out there ever see the Spore Guardian?  I<br/>
&gt; wandered the entire swamp last night for 2 hours looking<br/>
&gt; for him and only found fungusman trackers. Do you need<br/>
&gt; to talk to the #2 for the SK guild to trigger him<br/>
&gt; spawning?  Is there a certain time of the game day? It<br/>
&gt; was 6PM gametime when I started looking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The swamp now gives very little XP except for the<br/>
&gt; occasional fat and bull alligator, and the Lesser<br/>
&gt; Mummmies that spawn at the tower. Nothing over a<br/>
&gt; Froglock Fisherman spawned last night. Aren&#39;t there<br/>
&gt; higher level Frogs that spawn in the swamp? If not then<br/>
&gt; it looks like I will need to either try Guk solo or the<br/>
&gt; bandit camps in South Ro. Of course it could be a time<br/>
&gt; of game day issue again too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Got an Ogre to get me the HEHE meat from Chef Dooga.<br/>
&gt; What a pain in the a$$.  The exchange went fine and we<br/>
&gt; were both very happy.  I talked for a while then went to<br/>
&gt; put them in the bank for when I give them to Carver.<br/>
&gt; While I was talking, I ATE ONE!  I was very POed! I had<br/>
&gt; 14 rations on me an the system had me eat a HEHE meat!<br/>
&gt; The ogre that got them for me said &quot;maybe that why it<br/>
&gt; called HEHE...&quot; DOH!  Anyway, I paid him to go get me<br/>
&gt; more HEHE (5 this time in case he ate one by accident,<br/>
&gt; and/or I ate another one) which I immediately ran and<br/>
&gt; put in the bank. Now I have enough HEHE meat to do the<br/>
&gt; Quest twice. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This list is VERY quiet. Make some noise people!!!!<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t care what you send. Just send something. :)<br/>
