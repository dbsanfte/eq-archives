<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-750572139">Hello everyone. I am new here and have some questions for you.<br/>
1) Is it possible to not be KoS in Freeport propper as a Troll? By that I<br/>
mean with the guards, merchants and other NPCs? I know the Arcane Science<br/>
NPCs will always KoS you, but was not sure about the others.<br/>
<br/>
2) Can you train as a Troll SK in Neriak at either the Troll SK in Foriegn<br/>
1/4, or at the DE SK guild?  Cronikx&#39;s Diety is Innorukk.<br/>
<br/>
3) Will killing slaves in Crushbone increase Dead faction in Neriak?<br/>
<br/>
