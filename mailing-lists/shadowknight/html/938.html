<div id="ygrps-yiv-886942051">I explored this on the Test server, and it only had quests for <br/>
Magicians, Necros, Enchanters, and clerics, alhough there were serveral<br/>
other robed, named NPC&#39;s that may have wizard classes.<br/>
<br/>
There was not a soul wielding a sword in the whole place.  Are they<br/>
going to add in some quests for us there, or was it intended to be<br/>
mage and cleric only?<br/>
