<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500374322">Unless it has been changed in the past week, the<br/>
Undead Knight has no faction.<br/>
After killing him when he attacked me, we received no<br/>
faction adjustments at all.<br/>
But that was before the last patch, which seemed to<br/>
have fixed the bug where he attacked when you were<br/>
fighting anything in Najena.<br/>
Last night we went in there to get a friend the<br/>
gaunlets. The Undead Knight stayed put this time while<br/>
we smacked around Drelzna and her necro buddies.<br/>
