Cost 34 p though, so probably stick with the elm until your skill is 80 +<br/>
<br/>
I heard a rumour of fletching parts that can be bought in HH but have yet to<br/>
find them. You can always get a friend to buy them for you.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t not recommend using archeryy full on until level 9 or more. Then grab<br/>
one of those needle thingy&#39;s which are like daggers but use the archery skill.<br/>
they are the best way to raise your skill since they use no arrows, so are much<br/>
cheaper. Don&#39;t do much damage but good for practicing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, arcehry is good with either SoW or clinging darkness for kiting. I kited a<br/>
Bull Elepahnt that conned yellow to half health without taking a hit before<br/>
closing in and fighting it.<br/>
<br/>
With Arcehry kiting and pets, Yellows are easily soloed by SK, even up to lvl 20<br/>

&gt; Just my experiences with archery.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a Rough Elm Recurve Bow which has a base 13 damage. With the 1 dmg<br/>
&gt; arrows, I can do 14 damage to beasties. I also have an 80 skill in Archery,<br/>
&gt; having practiced and practices (and practiced and practiced) till my thumbs<br/>
&gt; bleed. Now that I have a good skill and a good bow, I find it quite<br/>
&gt; worthwhile. But I would not reccomend it for anyone that is shy on spending<br/>
&gt; a LOT of time working on getting it up (I probably fired 3,000+ arrows in my<br/>
&gt; training). My bow does almost as much damage as a mino axe, although it is<br/>
&gt; slower (48 I think maybe 51, compared to 38 for mino axe).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for fletching ... there is nowhere on Antonica to get fletching supplies<br/>
&gt; except surefall glade. The only other plalce I know to get bowyering<br/>
&gt; supplies is in Oggok which is not an option for humans (DE, Trolls and Ogres<br/>
&gt; only). Even ones that worship Innoruuk. :(<br/>
