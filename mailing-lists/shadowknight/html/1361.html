<div id="ygrps-yiv-209420530">Frankly, imo, a SK is the BEST tank in the game hands down, and this is also<br/>
a best kept secret.  The ability to snare with darkness, FD pull, and tank<br/>
with the best of them make it a awesome class. Also nice to have<br/>
invisibility to undead and self invis to move around. Great hybrid.  I would<br/>
ask you to consider your choice of race again. Another awesome aspect is we<br/>
are the only class that can choose the ogre race, which gives great stats,<br/>
and the ability to Slam.  You could still group with your &quot;goodie&quot; friends,<br/>
how often do you really need to enter a good city?<br/>

&gt; Hi I am a Lvl 4 Human Shadowknight who worships Innorukk .. .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My friend is an Agnostic Human Mage and he is not KOS from Dark Elf<br/>
guards.<br/>
&gt; . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I should be at least apprehensive since he is dubious was my thinking, but<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; just wanted to know what any other human shadowknights experiences were. .<br/>
.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I picked Human for 1 main reason, all my friends who I am playing my low<br/>
lvl<br/>
&gt; Shadowkngiht with are good and I thought Human would be the most welcome<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; other good cities . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do you guys like playing a Shadowknight???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a L42 Ogre Shaman also and a L26 Necro Gnome . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; :-)<br/>
