<br/>
Does anyone know of wich SK has the BBC(bone bladed claymore) in<br/>
befallen? i&#39;ve been to the third level a few times but never went to far<br/>
in, usually just to go to the well or make some monster pulls for my<br/>
party...perhaps there is a map out there where the Final SK is located?<br/>
i have heard it is a troll, ill be getting a party to search for it very<br/>
soon any info would help.<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>
