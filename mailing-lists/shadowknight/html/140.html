<b>Subject:</b> Tunare badass GM <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726472516">I started a character on tunare server , and made it to level 6<br/>
then a GM called me saying that my name didnt fit in the game...<br/>
In my opinion it fitted really good to myself , but they say it has to fit with the game...<br/>
In years of online rpgs I&#39;ve met the most childish and lifeless people but my god<br/>
no one was close to the stupidity of that GM.<br/>
he told me I had only one minute to give a new name so I asked him if I could change it later and he said &quot;sure&quot; , so I came out with a meaningless name I tought I would have been able to get rid of in a few days...<br/>
but when I petitioned again asking to change my name he said : <br/>
&quot;No I wont change your name again :)&quot;<br/>
I asked him why and he said the matter was closed and he had no time to change my name again.<br/>
I told him that the name of my char is very important to me and he appeared to me<br/>
and started making me turn around (Like when your stunned but 10 times faster)<br/>
I tought he wanted to joke but he stood there watching me turn for like 10 minutes (no time to deal with me eh ?)<br/>
all I could do was casting a spell on him and he said (that really got on my nerves):<br/>
&quot;Attacking me can result in a ban&quot;<br/>
I asked him if he was kidding but he was &quot;dead serious&quot;<br/>
I asked him why couldnt he just change my name (takes 5 secs) and he reported me !<br/>
that got me mad so I told him that it will be fun if I meet him in real life where hes not 40 levels over me<br/>
Of course he said : &quot;are you treathening me ?&quot;<br/>
at that point I logged out cause I still want to play EQ<br/>
Is there any way I can report this retard children (getting his address would be too nice :)?<br/>
If guides are there to help people out then Verant should really select them with much more care...<br/>
If there is something I can do to change my name (other guides on tunare) or against that guide please let me know !<br/>
If not I would have to restart since the name I got now really stinks</div>
