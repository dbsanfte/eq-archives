<b>Subject:</b> question about butcherblock <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234267335">can anyone verify wether or not the dwarven guards throughout the<br/>
butcherblock mountains are aligned with the stormguard? if so, there IS a<br/>
valid way for us evil folk to survive that area without invis. if you kill<br/>
runnyeye goblins and several of the monsters that frequent the gorge of king<br/>
xorbb, your faction with the stormguard will increase (as well as the<br/>
guardians of the vale, who guard misty thicket and rivervale). if this<br/>
works, even an evil person will be able to travel most places in<br/>
butcherblock provided they go genocidal on gobbies before they make the<br/>
trip. however, i still dont reccomend trying to get into kaladim, since the<br/>
goblins dont raise faction with any of the other groups of dwarves. so...<br/>
does anybody know for sure if this will work?<br/>
