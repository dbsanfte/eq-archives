<b>Subject:</b> Is The Journey To LVL 23 Worth IT!!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-994638507">Hello my fellow Shadow Knights,<br/>
<br/>
I am a Dark Elf, LVL 19, and i have a question for u LVL 22&#39;s and above.  My<br/>
question is,  &quot;Do we SK&#39;s become very powerful at LVL 22?&quot;  The reason that<br/>
i ask this is because i&#39;ve heard a few people say that if u hold on and keep<br/>
playing and hit lvl 22 that u won&#39;t be disappointed.  As of right now i<br/>
basically am a weak warrior with a few weak spells.  Do our spells improve<br/>
greatly?  I sure hope so, because from what i&#39;ve been told SK&#39;s are one of<br/>
the strongest high lvl classes there is... so let me know something u higher<br/>
lvl players!!!<br/>
<br/>
One last question... Which is better using a 2H Slashing weapon our using a<br/>
1H Slashing Weapon with bash?  Hehe, and don&#39;t tell me it depends on the<br/>
weapon... my question is overall.... Just wondering because if 2H Slashing<br/>
is better then I&#39;ll have to start lvling it up..<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Brothers,<br/>

&gt;First off, no, there is no way in hell that your party of 20s or 22s can<br/>
&gt;kill Arlena. She is in Mistmoore and she is a gyspy. Getting to Mistmoore<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a slight pain unless you can teleport over somewhere near there (and back).<br/>
&gt;Arlena is at least level 30. I say this because even the UNNAMED gyspy<br/>
&gt;musicians in Mistmoore are level 30, and they all can CHARM quite well. So,<br/>
&gt;be careful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dekam N&#39;Tazi may very well be in Neriak. N&#39;Tazi sounds like a dark elf name<br/>
&gt;anyway. It was an assumption of mine he would be in Qeynos (cuz almost all<br/>
&gt;the quests in the west have something to do with Qeynos). If the site says<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s in Neriak, he&#39;s in Neriak. Come to think of it, that&#39;s actually a GOOD<br/>
&gt;thing. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;DV<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The reason I said that was because a 23 shaman I was grouped with the other<br/>
&gt;day told me that she was yellow to him (1 or 2 levels up) whether or not he<br/>
&gt;was lying is up in the air, but that&#39;s the only reason I said that. I<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t seen her, and I wish someone who has could give us the real lowdown<br/>
&gt;on her.<br/>
&gt;And yes it would be nice if Dekam is in Neriak, as I don&#39;t think Queynos<br/>
 </span></blockquote>has<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;an easy to sneak into sewer system (but I know nothing about that).<br/>
&gt;If someone out there has done this quest please post everything you know<br/>
&gt;about it please hehe<br/>
