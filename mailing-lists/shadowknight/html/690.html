<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357497050">Last night just totally sucked! <br/>
I killed the loner Dervs at bothe the East and West <br/>
camps in South Ro. Both were blue, non spellchuckers, <br/>
and I took around a bubble of damage from each.<br/>
I finish healing after killing the one at the West camp <br/>
and a spellchucking madman that /cons BLUE to me <br/>
proceeds to kill me because his spells going off cause <br/>
so much lag it prevents me from getting close enough to <br/>
actually hit it with my axe! 1 spell every 1.5 seconds! <br/>
Do PC spells go off that fast? Hell no!  I lost more xp <br/>
that I gained from the dervs.<br/>
No big deal, I know I can make that up pretty quick.<br/>
I run to my body, not near an Orc camp and start getting <br/>
nailed by one from the 1st camp near the entrance (he <br/>
caught up to me half way there).  I use the corpse <br/>
command hotkeyed to drag my body back to the entrance.  <br/>
By the time I get there, I have 5 Orc Warriors and 2 <br/>
casters on my ass.  Normally all monsters attacking you <br/>
stop and turn around when you enter the tunnel that <br/>
marks the entrance to the Innothule zone.  When I <br/>
realize they didn&#39;t, I make the zone with 15 HPs! <br/>
This set the stage for the rest of the night.<br/>
That last patch that they made got rid of a few &quot;null&quot; <br/>
zones (like the one I normally use as noted above) and I <br/>
think it also increased the Aggro range on creatures. I <br/>
had not faught a Spellchucking Madman solo before the <br/>
one that killed me, so I am not sure if they were beefed <br/>
up or not.  My wife also noticed a new creature last <br/>
night: &quot;a shadowed man&quot; in West Commonlands.  Someone <br/>
from her guild told her that it was around a 26th level <br/>
mobs, and it has a pet.  She saw 3 of these with 1 pet <br/>
each in the South West corner just hanging out.  I think <br/>
they spawn there.  This means Verant is trying to <br/>
prevent the &quot;safe paths&quot; used by low levels to avoid the <br/>
dangers of the zone. Ie griffs and giants and kodiaks, <br/>
etc.<br/>
This could also mean that creatures previously only seen <br/>
in the Plane of Fear are now being put in the regular <br/>
zones.  Look out Befallen, Mistmore and Unrest!  This <br/>
may fit better than the zone path theory.  These may be <br/>
another spawn creature from outside the Befallen <br/>
entrance to try to prevent PC from camping outside to <br/>
heal.<br/>
<br/>
I lagged so bad last night it took me an hour to get <br/>
from Oasis to Neriak to invite someone into the guild! <br/>
By the time I got there they had logged off.<br/>
<br/>
If Verant or Cerfnet or who ever just made an upgrade to <br/>
the hardware, why is there so much lag?  It seems to be <br/>
getting worse, not better with each &quot;upgrade&quot;.  I am not <br/>
a hardware tech, but can someone tell me why?  I used <br/>
the UOTracer program that pings every server your <br/>
connection uses to connect to EQ, and all are ok until I <br/>
get to the EQ servers.<br/>
Even people I know with cable modems were lagging last <br/>
night. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, that is enough for now, but more will be coming. :)<br/>
