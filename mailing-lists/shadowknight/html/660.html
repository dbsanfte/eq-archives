&gt; 2H Slashing is best for dealing damage especially in solo situations.  The only long term benefit I&#39;ve seen for a SK to keep up 1H Slashing is for group situations.  Mages are doing most of the damage at higher levels anyways.  So use 1H Slashing and Shield to boost your AC and thus save some or your cleric&#39;s mana by not getting hit as much.  2H Slashing is still important for groups as you need to deal damage to keep taunts workings, so it really depends on play style.  Personally, I&#39;m 2H Slashing all the way.  I just use 1H Slashing to keep my skill up in case I need it later on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I carry both with me, and use 1H and a shield when fighting casters,<br/>
especially healers.  Stopping that greater heal a judicator is planning<br/>
can mean two less nukes from your wizard, who by that time is sitting<br/>
a LONG time.  Normal casters I usually still use 2H because they die<br/>
faster than priest based mobs.  I can usually interrupt 3 spells in<br/>
a battle using a shield, which make the switch worth it to me.<br/>
<br/>
I use a silvery 1H Axe / Darkwood shield and a Dark Reaver, and it&#39;ll <br/>
get even better because my Bash is still 60 points under max =)<br/>
