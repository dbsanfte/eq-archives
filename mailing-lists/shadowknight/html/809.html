<div id="ygrps-yiv-868676248">After Talking to a few dark elf sks we decided that<br/>
giving us a good 1hand sword quest weapon and raising<br/>
the cap a little on bash would be best for the human<br/>
and dark elf sks.  We decided maybe a 1hander around<br/>
12dmg 36dly and an effect of poison bolt or a weak<br/>
lifetap i dunno thats up to you. its basically<br/>
supposed to be like  a ghoulbane.  You could even make<br/>
it human and de only if you like. This would help us<br/>
because now we can carry a shield and have a decent<br/>
1hander instead of always having to carry a 2hander<br/>
and lose the ability to bash which the large races do<br/>
not....let me know what you think<br/>
