<div id="ygrps-yiv-297234949">If this is intentional, then I am thoroughly<br/>
disgusted.  Can you say &quot;bait and switch?&quot;  We&#39;re<br/>
offered a set of spells, with defined mana costs, but<br/>
that&#39;s not what we get.  How is this not a bug?  Well<br/>
I suppose it could just be outright deception by the<br/>
merchants of Norath.  If this was intentional then why<br/>
didn&#39;t the patch message make some mention of this up<br/>
front?  <br/>
<br/>
Hey Verant, this really isn&#39;t the way to keep your<br/>
customers happy.  How would you like it if when you<br/>
verify my credit card your payment processor said<br/>
&quot;sure he&#39;s good for it.&quot;  and then when you went to<br/>
settle got told &quot;oh, he only has half the money,<br/>
sorry, and no it&#39;s not a bug.&quot;<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve heard rumors that the increased cost of the<br/>
&gt; lifetaps is in <br/>
&gt; fact intentional, and not a bug.  Can someone clear<br/>
&gt; this up?  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; also heard it&#39;s a bug that will be fixed next patch.<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;m sure we&#39;d<br/>
&gt; all really appreciate a clear answer on this one.<br/>
