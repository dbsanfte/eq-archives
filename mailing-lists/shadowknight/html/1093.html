<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406353796">I agree that most SKs will be kinda disappointed when<br/>
they actually get these spells.<br/>
But realistically, what else from the Necro spell book<br/>
were they going to give us?<br/>
They already dumbed down our attack spells at higher<br/>
levels, so believing that they would give us more<br/>
wouldnt make sense.<br/>
And other than an upgrade to Sheildskin, Necros dont<br/>
have much for buffing either.<br/>
<br/>
Like the rest of our spells they are going to be weak<br/>
for the level in which we get them.<br/>
Use them as you see fit, or dont usee them at all. For<br/>
most of us, the latter would put us right back in the<br/>
same spot we are in now. So no harm-no foul.<br/>
<br/>
I was really down on SheidSkin when they changed that.<br/>
And though i would rather have Banshee back,<br/>
SheildSkin isnt nearly as pathetic as i thought it<br/>
would be.<br/>
I use it to pull casters or things with their own HT.<br/>
And the SheildSkin usually eats a good part of the<br/>
initial casting. <br/>
<br/>
So i dont think this will be as wonderful as some are<br/>
hoping, but i dont think it will be as bad as some<br/>
think it will be either.<br/>

&gt; my opinion this is another example of listening to<br/>
&gt; the majority sheep out<br/>
&gt; there that get it in their head what would be good<br/>
&gt; for the class without<br/>
&gt; playing that class to a decent level (30+). I<br/>
&gt; believe that SK&#39;s would have<br/>
&gt; been better served by giving us better offensive<br/>
&gt; spells, or even some<br/>
&gt; defensive buffs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These lifetaps are barely adequate for Necros at the<br/>
&gt; levels they get them,<br/>
&gt; for SK&#39;s they would be a gimmick (and again now they<br/>
&gt; can claim that SK&#39;s<br/>
&gt; have healing). I would have much rather seen the<br/>
&gt; skill cap on Bind wound<br/>
&gt; bumped from 100 to 200. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh well just my opinion.<br/>

&gt; Thank you Brian for listening to the players. <br/>
&gt; Although some may be<br/>
&gt; dismayed at the loss of Voice Graft, all in all I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think anyone<br/>
&gt; can complain about this one.  Let&#39;s hope this makes<br/>
&gt; it to the live<br/>
&gt; servers.<br/>
