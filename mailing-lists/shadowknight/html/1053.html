&gt;Subject: [shadowknight] More fun with Decaying<br/>
&gt;Date: Tue, 19 Oct 1999 11:57:09 -0700 (PDT)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Through a 6 hour period we killed about 8 Crusaders.<br/>
&gt;Not bad. We&#39;ve spent much more time there and have<br/>
&gt;killed less. But how many pieces of decaying do you<br/>
&gt;think were dropped? one. 6 hours, 8 Crusaders one<br/>
&gt;drop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But thats not even the best part. Now sit back and<br/>
&gt;listen to my tale.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are on our 3rd or 4th Crusader. KIll him. Loot.<br/>
&gt;Nothing again. Damnit.<br/>
&gt;Our rogue says &quot;I got it!&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;ummm..you got what?&quot;<br/>
&gt;rogue, &quot;a BP!&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;WHAT!?!?!&quot;<br/>
&gt;rogue, &quot;a decaying BP&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;much swearing and cursing ensues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;its NO DROP&quot;<br/>
&gt;rogue,&quot;oh, damnit&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;why do you think we were the only ones looting them?&quot;<br/>
&gt;rogue,&quot;i didnt loot it. I pickpocketed it&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;WHAT!?!?!&quot; &quot;i thought rogues pickpocket from a<br/>
&gt;different pool than the loot one&quot;<br/>
&gt;rogue, &quot;different pool for cash, but not items. But<br/>
&gt;those items are supposed to be inaccessible&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So now we have a rogue who pickpocketed our SK only NO<br/>
&gt;DROP item.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My friend petitions. Rogue petitions.<br/>
&gt;Both end up talking to a guide since no real GM is on.<br/>
&gt;She &quot;can&#39;t&quot; do anything about it.<br/>
&gt;The rogue puts up a good fight though.She does feel<br/>
&gt;real bad about it. She goes thru how bad this<br/>
&gt;knowledge would be if it got spread to the public.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Think about it. How many people would want rogues<br/>
&gt;around at all if they thought they might pickpocket<br/>
&gt;the quest items that they need?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The guide started to see the resoning. However still<br/>
&gt;no BP for us. Even the suggestion of creating a<br/>
&gt;dynamic character and letting one of us loot the BP<br/>
&gt;from him wasnt accepted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And thats how we left it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3 or 4 Crusaders later with no decaying and both of us<br/>
&gt;SKs were just too ticked to keep playing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The moral of the story..ummm..there isnt one i dont<br/>
&gt;think..but do yourself a favor and make sure you tell<br/>
&gt;any rigue you are grouped with to NOT pickpocket the<br/>
&gt;Crusaders or you will be added a sequel to my little<br/>
&gt;adventure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now let me say this. The BP isnt all that great and i<br/>
&gt;wouldnt wear it anyway. But i would still like to do<br/>
&gt;the quest if i happen to end up with the items.<br/>
&gt;But more importantly, this could have just as easily<br/>
&gt;been an item i needed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And i did a nice little FEEDBACK right before i logged<br/>
&gt;letting &quot;them&quot; know how lame and pathetic this<br/>
&gt;so-called &quot;quest&quot; is.<br/>
&gt;And i dont consider this a quest. Sitting in CT<br/>
&gt;waiting for the same MOB over and over is camping, not<br/>
&gt;questing.<br/>
&gt;There was obviously no thought process put into this<br/>
&gt;at all.<br/>
&gt;And has anyone found a weapon quest for SKs yet?<br/>
&gt;Throughout the different sites i have noticed that<br/>
&gt;quite a few classes have had weapon quests put in with<br/>
&gt;the last patch. Just wondering if we got the same<br/>
&gt;consideration *snicker*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway thats my rant for today.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Enjoy kiddies<br/>
