the Hole (experience bonus there, probably outweighed by the difficulty of<br/>
CR)... none very exciting maybe, but good exp to get you to a higher level<br/>
(and then the planes should provide plenty of interest!).  BTW 45 went by<br/>
fast for me (LGuk), but man oh man the experience bar at 46 seems to be<br/>
stuck.<br/>

Subject: [shadowknight] Question<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know of a good place for a 45 SK to hunt?  I just can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seem to find anywhere that is really intersting (or find a good grp<br/>
&gt; there).  I tried Karnor&#39;s recently but that place is a mess (and you<br/>
&gt; get bad Venril Sathir (sp) faction (the outpost in OT))  so that was<br/>
&gt; no good.  Many of the higher levels are either overcrowded or there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; just no-one there.  I solo a lot so I was wondering if anyone knew of<br/>
&gt; anywhere good.  my Velious faction is with the giants (Ally, Warm and<br/>
&gt; dumbarse Tormax still scowels, which would be nice to get some help<br/>
&gt; w/).  I dunno, any ideas?  Have all my DF armor etc, so there a very<br/>
&gt; few quests to do.<br/>
