<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551875744">That&#39;s not entirely true.  It really does depend on the mob.  Some of them <br/>
behave different then others.  We&#39;ve tried this on specific mobs in certain <br/>
places.  Some will forget you all together, but some DO remember, and once <br/>
you get back up, if they&#39;re in &quot;range&quot; still, they&#39;ll come right after you.<br/>

Regarding Feign Death...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; It seems to work pretty well in Guk. I went LD once<br/>
 &gt; and came back to my group being gone, a shaman, undead<br/>
 &gt; knight and some warrior who was hitting me for 80s. I<br/>
 &gt; finally got a Feign off and it worked even with them<br/>
 &gt; beating on me. It lasts forever as long as you just<br/>
 &gt; lay there. I believe the aggro eventually leaves the<br/>
 &gt; MOB, so you can theoretically, get up and walk away<br/>
 &gt; after they are out of sight. Try that one at your own<br/>
 &gt; risk though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The aggro leaves immediately.  However, if you are<br/>
KOS with teh mob, they will attack again as soon as you stand<br/>
up.  Other mobs though, feign and stand right back up and<br/>
they will ignore you.  Perfect for in-city assassination.<br/>
Kill them fast with HT, feign, and then get up and leave<br/>
like nothing had happened.<br/>
