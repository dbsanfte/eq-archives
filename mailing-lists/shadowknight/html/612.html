<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-357114691">I talked to Carver last night, and he is asking you if <br/>
you know what type of [meat]? You need to answer his <br/>
question.  He will not tell you because he doesn&#39;t know. <br/>
I said &quot;it is HEHE meat.&quot; and he reaponded with what he <br/>
wants you to do.<br/>

recipe and me make you honoraree carver... cleaver cut <br/>

say any more than that.<br/>
