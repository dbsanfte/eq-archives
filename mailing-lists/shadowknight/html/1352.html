<div id="ygrps-yiv-245927977">there are actually TWO jyle windshots in freeport. the one at hogcaller inn<br/>
in west fp is high level and not worth the effort unless you are very<br/>
desperate for faction, or just feel like avenging yourself on him ;) jyle<br/>
also appears sometimes in a room at seafarer&#39;s wharf in east freeport. he is<br/>
still a druid, but much lower level.<br/>
