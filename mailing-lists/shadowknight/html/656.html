<div id="ygrps-yiv-84209407">This is an example of how messed up some of the quests in EQ are.  You need to be 20th level to get this weapon, but when you finally do, it sucks.  The only reason I would see anyone wanting this at level 20 is for putting in your range slot for the +5 Magic resistence.  My 9th level cleric can summon a weapon that has superior attack stats to this piece of ****.<br/>

To get the note you need to say some phrase which i dont <br/>
know, but i believe its a SK guildmaster in Neriak that <br/>
tells you what it is.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
The phrase is: &quot;utalk adarev otcin&quot;<br/>
Haven&#39;t tried it myself, but I don&#39;t know if Gix will <br/>
talk to me or give me note since I am a troll SK of <br/>
Thule. :)<br/>

Off topic...<br/>
Why is it that most magic weapons need you to be 20th + <br/>
in level to get?  In must cases the creatures you are <br/>
fighting doing more damage than you.  Is ok in groups, <br/>
but I solo mostly.<br/>
Example.<br/>
With 1HS @ 61 skill or so, I max damage at 9 (includes <br/>
STR bonus from Siphon Strength).  With my 2HS @68ish and <br/>
a FS2HS I max damage at 25ish.  Using each weapon on the <br/>
same creature that cons blue this is what happens to me.<br/>
With 2HS I have more than half life and mana left. With <br/>
1HS I have 1 bubble or so left and no mana.  This was <br/>
done vs Skeles in Befallen. They hit for 18-22 max a pop <br/>
vs a 9 with a whip and my delay is still more than their <br/>
natural delay even with a whip.  <br/>
Granted having 1HS maxed for the Dark Reaver is the way <br/>
to go, but at 35th level to get that blade, I won&#39;t be <br/>
using 1 HS! Back to topic....<br/>
