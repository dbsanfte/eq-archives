<div id="ygrps-yiv-420581173">Yes, I have to agree with Lief on that too. I would be fantastic to have, <br/>
but I doubt it will ever be implemented.<br/>
<br/>
What I think might be more feasible would be for Verant to increase the <br/>
power of Vampiric Embrace so that it works exactly the same for both Necros <br/>
and Shadow Knights. As near as I can tell, when we get it at level 22, it&#39;s <br/>
effectiveness is already weaker then a Necromancer of around level 8. I&#39;ve <br/>
heard of many Necro&#39;s stating that it taps for 30+ a whack for them in the <br/>
late teens, increasing by a point or so around every level. However, it <br/>
seems that when we get the spell it is much weaker then a level 8 Necro&#39;s VE <br/>
- which is why it taps for just six points or so at the start for us (which <br/>
is in reality pretty useless). My Necro friend just confirmed that when <br/>
Necro&#39;s get this spell around level 8, they tap for around 20 a whack. Why <br/>
is it that when we get it, it starts at six?<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m only a paltry level 13, so I can&#39;t confirm the Vampiric Embrace <br/>
performance for Shadow Knights myself. But, from what I have been able to <br/>
gather from message boards, this spell is definitely performing differently <br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
My only other suggestion would be for Voice Graft to be replaced with Hungry <br/>
Earth, a Necromancer spell of comparison level that would fit into our DOT <br/>
theme as well providing a much needed Root type of spell.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>
