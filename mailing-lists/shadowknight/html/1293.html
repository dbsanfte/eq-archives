<div id="ygrps-yiv-923515015">I am new to this list, and hope it is pretty active.<br/>
<br/>
This is not my first character or Shadow Knight for that matter, but I lost<br/>
touch because my lag issues made my TSK not very fun to play. I am starting<br/>
over with a DE SK and have some questions.<br/>
<br/>
What armor, not blackened, is better than Banded or Bronze for AC?<br/>
What 1HS weapon is best and what is in your off hand?  I am looking into<br/>
getting a Barbed Whip in Najena, and a CGS from Sol.<br/>
<br/>
What stats increasing items are best? Strength and Dex?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
