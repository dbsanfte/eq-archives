<div id="ygrps-yiv-790243650">Howdy all,<br/>
<br/>
Well after pondering this for quite a while (I really need to find more to<br/>
do with my time), I&#39;ve come to agree with Bathory on the Lifetaps. I didn&#39;t<br/>
use the spells they replaced and most likely I won&#39;t use them. But I&#39;m sure<br/>
there going to be more useful to new SK&#39;s more so than the ones they<br/>
replace. So in this particular case I&#39;ll just sit back and let the change<br/>
happen since it really doesn&#39;t effect me or my SK. Now what I don&#39;t want is<br/>
to hear a week after it goes live that it sucks. You asked for them, and you<br/>
got them so live with it.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the real question. I was talking to an acquaintance about this, Do<br/>
you all feel that the larger races make better SK&#39;s? From the impression I<br/>
received Verant feels that the larger races are that much better, where I<br/>
really don&#39;t see it. I personally play a DE and I can easily go toe to toe<br/>
with a Ogre or Troll (I&#39;ve never lost a duel to an equal level SK yet), and<br/>
from observing other Sk&#39;s in combat I can do fairly equal damage (at the<br/>
higher lvls 35+) to my larger counterparts.<br/>
<br/>
So what do you all think? Are larger races more powerful SK&#39;s? Both PVE and<br/>
PVP.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy..</div>
