<div id="ygrps-yiv-253853876">Actually I believe there is an ogre in the feerot who sells fletching <br/>
kits... Just go to the bridge on the oggok side and head right until you <br/>
reach a small ogre camp.  An ogre female sells all sorts of fletching stuff <br/>
and I believe a kit as well.  However this is what I think as I have never <br/>
really checked, try it out and tell me.<br/>

&gt;The closest place to get fletchie kits, my green friend, is to travel to <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;Centaur Camp in  the southern plains of Karana. It is a large place but if<br/>
&gt;you travel north and east until you near the river you will find it. Beware<br/>
&gt;of the aviaks that inhabit this realm however as they do not like trolls <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;some odd reason. I&#39;m not sure if it has anything to do with the fact that<br/>
&gt;when you are older you will eat them or not? Anyways, if get to the river,<br/>
&gt;you&#39;ve gone too far (loc of camp is 200, -2300 because I know how much of a<br/>
&gt;pain in the arse it can be to find). The fletchie kits should be around 1<br/>
&gt;plat or 2 (probably closer to 2 for you, my charismatic friend). The <br/>
&gt;Centaur<br/>
&gt;has a name and is in one of the four centaur houses there. He also sells<br/>
&gt;equipment for bowyery for when you decide to take up that trade.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good luck to you large one<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;May His Hate make you Strong<br/>
