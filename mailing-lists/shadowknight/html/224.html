<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386195303">Isn&#39;t it fun when you go to West COmmons and kill Militia Colin and Volin <br/>
&lt;whatever&gt; so many times that, the Guards in North Ro, East commons and West <br/>
Commons will now kill you? &lt;grin&gt; Well they don&#39;t scowl at me, ready to <br/>
attack.. they look at me threateningly.. but when I just walked by the first <br/>
guard in North Ro that stay at the three way intersection near the desert, <br/>
he came after me and killed me... bleh.. back to half way to level for the <br/>
4th time this level.. guess I won&#39;t be walking the streets of Freeport any <br/>
time soon... ah.. the sewers life for me... not that I ever go into Freeport <br/>
much, being a Dark-elf.. just annoying that now I can&#39;t go towards or near <br/>
the Inns in east commonlands at all now.. not that the Innkeepers much like <br/>
me anyway.. but at least I could sit by the trees near the Inn&#39;s.. <br/>
anyways... don&#39;t suppose anyone happens to have any information on Vampiric <br/>
Embrace yet as to what it now does? Ok.. I&#39;m done rambling now...<br/>
