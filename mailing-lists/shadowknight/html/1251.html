Do you really have that many mobs to kill at level 49/50 that getting the<br/>
items and holding them would be that big of a pain? If the expansion and<br/>
Level increase had already happened, then I would say wait. But since you<br/>
can only kill the lame level 49/50 MoBs with 60 other level 50 characters<br/>
next to you (extreme sarcasm), get the stuff and hold onto it. After all you<br/>
don&#39;t have long to go, so why wait?<br/>
