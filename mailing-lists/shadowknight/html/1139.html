<div id="ygrps-yiv-94767777">Just move the spells to the last page in the spellbook. That&#39;s what I had<br/>
to do with my druid spells. It&#39;s a hassle, but you only got to do them<br/>
once *smile*<br/>

&gt; Oh something that was kind of bugging me, is there anyway to delete a spell<br/>
&gt; from your spell book? The since the new lifetaps didn&#39;t overwrite the<br/>
&gt; existing spells I still have them in my book (and obviously can&#39;t use<br/>
&gt; them).. I&#39;ve moved them to like page 15 or so, but would like to delete<br/>
&gt; them. Any ideas?<br/>
