<div id="ygrps-yiv-760390162">If you kill enough of a certain critter you can into cities.  As a dark<br/>
elf i can now safely walk into Freeport....some people will still KoS me<br/>
if I walk into the wrong building...but you can walk around the streets<br/>
with relative safety.  Just don&#39;t talk to anyone.  Last time I was in<br/>
Freeport the guards &quot;/con&quot;ed dubiously...so i was alright....I have killed<br/>
ALOT more Orcs since then so I&#39;m not sure if my status went up.<br/>
