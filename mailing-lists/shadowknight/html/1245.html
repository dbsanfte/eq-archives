<div id="ygrps-yiv-647375965">there are two major problems as it is.<br/>
<br/>
right now, when you feign, ALL things on your hate list get a save. if even<br/>
ONE of them makes the save, they will continue to hit you, and tip you off<br/>
to everything else. therefore, pulling areas with lots of uber monsters,<br/>
such as fire giants or PoF, is made virtually impossible, predictability or not.<br/>
<br/>
second, even if you feign when nothing is around, everything that wanders<br/>
near you gets a save realize you are faking. so now, even if your feign is<br/>
successful, you can still be hosed.<br/>
<br/>
in short, the reply was BS. it did not accurately portray how feign worked<br/>
before, and it left out a few juicy points about how it works now.<br/>
<br/>
monks who have played 1000s of hours and basically live or die by feign<br/>
death (no pun intended) know what they are talking about. and they have<br/>
every right to protest this nonsense.<br/>
