<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516666797">Up high enough with the Paladins in Freeport to not glare at me <br/>
threateningly.. hehe.. and I&#39;m a Dark-elf Shadow Knight.. so.. of course.. <br/>
the Militia hates my guts, so I can&#39;t even wander the streets of freeport or <br/>
go to close to them in East Commons.. and the Two in West COmmons, but <br/>
they&#39;re push overs now anyway... on another note.. the InnKeepers in East <br/>
commons also look at me dubiously now, as opposed to scowl, ready to <br/>
attack.. Mind you.. I&#39;ve killed alot of orcs in East Commons &lt;grin&gt; Though.. <br/>
I can&#39;t go anywhere near the Inns sense the Guards will slaughter me...  <br/>
hehe.. oh well.. guess I traded off good (look at me dubiously) relation <br/>
with the Militia for good &lt;look at me dubiously&gt; relation with the <br/>
InnKeepers... ah well...<br/>
