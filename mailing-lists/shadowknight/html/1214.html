<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-101930711">Well, I have everything except the bracers and leggings. I am not familier<br/>
at all wih solusek a, but I do have a map. How hard is this malatite to get?<br/>
clockworks tough? I heard they werre totally resistant to magic. This mean a<br/>
tank heavy group with a shaman/cleric to keep them running?  (we are in 30+<br/>
range)<br/>
<br/>
I went to the mino  caves. Were three other shadowknights there, said been<br/>
there 6 hours with no spawn. We grouped with them for awhile, but no way am<br/>
I gonna do a 16 hour camp (or more) for the shackles. Then come and do it<br/>
again? Geesh, who wants to stand and line for them? Any tips on getting the<br/>
mino to spawn? How long has it taken you all?<br/>
Any tips of getting the malatite? The armor I think looks very damn cool on<br/>
a ogre...8) But I wanta get rid of these bronze leggings and bracers asap.<br/>
Thanks for any help/tips in advance.<br/>
<br/>
