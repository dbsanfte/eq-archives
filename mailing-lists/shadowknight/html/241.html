<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460151620">where is everyone?  i wanted to see what today&#39;s topic would be at lunch, but nobody&#39;s sent anything!  let&#39;s talk about armor, i still don&#39;t know what good armor would be for me right now.  i&#39;m working on some steel ribbed, but that will take awhile to complete.  is there any armor that makes us look cool?<br/>
