<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923363288"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ANYWAY...<br/>
&gt; I also dread a teleport to Faydwer for the same reason.<br/>
&gt; I have no idea what NPCs hang around wizard teleport<br/>
&gt; rings.  I doubt I will ever use a Druidic Succor for<br/>
&gt; obvious reasons.  My wife&#39;s Bard worships Veeshan, and<br/>
&gt; when teleported to the Druidic ring in the Karanas she<br/>
&gt; was KoSed.  With my lag I would never see that I am<br/>
&gt; being attacked, just the &quot;Returning to home point...&quot;<br/>
&gt; message.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have no idea if this will ease your fears or not, but the only person who<br/>
can&#39;t be invisible when teleporting or succoring is the caster. In other<br/>
words, you can be invis and still ride along. I&#39;m a dark elf SK who&#39;s killed<br/>
many many druids, yet I just go invis during his casting, and I still get to<br/>
tag along. Just a little trick so when you get 30, you can invis yourself<br/>
and not have to miss out on teleporting. :)<br/>
