&gt; Well for the first time in months MM was actually camped heavily last night<br/>
&gt; on my server so I never got to talk to the guy.. I saw him once, right<br/>
&gt; before several high lvl casters decided to make an example of him.. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; hoping I can get on late tonight and have no one else around..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the faction side, I also stopped in High Keep looking for Leyna(sp?), not<br/>
&gt; to be found.. And I realized that it takes a hell of a lot of bards to get<br/>
&gt; your faction increased. (That plus their are on a 20min respawn makes it<br/>
&gt; annoying as hell). Now the million dollar question, do you actually need MM<br/>
&gt; faction to do the quest, plus I&#39;ve heard rumors that there are only 4 SK<br/>
&gt; armor pieces (compared to 7 for the other classes) can anybody confirm this?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>

good faction to get to him.  You do not need MM faction, however.<br/>
