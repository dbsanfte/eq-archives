<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967801286">Actually you need 2 different parts of the Thex Mallet<br/>
from the elf skeleton. He drops the head and shaft i<br/>
believe. The 3rd part is on a 25ish zombie in befallen<br/>
named Commander Windstream (or something like that).<br/>
That would be the handle, which when you right click<br/>
on it, opens like a container, with a COMBINE button.<br/>
You put the other 2 pieces in there and COMBINE. And<br/>
low and behold..the Thex Mallet.To get him to spawn,or<br/>
so i hear, you need to turn in the note from Gix to<br/>
Skeleton Llrodd. To get the note you need to say some<br/>
phrase which i dont know, but i believe its a SK<br/>
guildmaster in Neriak that tells you what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck with it<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m new to this list so....  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the thex mallet quest you need to kill the<br/>
&gt; paladin, Sir Lindeal in<br/>
&gt; Lavastorm.  Only thing is hes a rare spawn outside<br/>
&gt; Najena and the Fire<br/>
&gt; Elementals kill him.  You also need good faction<br/>
&gt; with Lrodd I believe as you<br/>
&gt; have to give him or his pet a note from Kizdean Gix.<br/>

&gt; Well I hit 13th last night. FINALLY!<br/>
&gt; I got tired of running from Fire Elementals in<br/>
&gt; Lavastorm <br/>
&gt; and went to Befallen and camped Lrodd.  I noticed<br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; after killing him a few times at a yellow con, he <br/>
&gt; started conning even a few times and then blue.  I<br/>
&gt; guess <br/>
&gt; there is some anti camp code that makes him a weaker<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; spawn, or it could be a set cycle. &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3 very kewl things happened to me there. <br/>
&gt; A high level shaman cast shrink on me!  That was so <br/>
&gt; kewl. No ducking the entire time I was there, and I<br/>
&gt; FLEW <br/>
&gt; through everything.  <br/>
&gt; A 34th level druid cast Regeneration on me. That was<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; awesome!  I was at 1/4 bub of health after fighting <br/>
&gt; Lrodd (didn&#39;t use HT once since I was camping him :)<br/>
&gt;  ) <br/>
&gt; and I went up to full in a very short amount of time<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; instead of the 10+ minutes I normally spend healing.<br/>
&gt;  It <br/>
&gt; also lasted through 3 more fights with Lrodd and<br/>
&gt; other <br/>
&gt; assorted denezines of Befallen.<br/>
&gt; That same Druid killed the Elf Skeleton (Red to me)<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; got the Thex Mallet shaft and then gave it to me. He<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; said he was on another quest and didn&#39;t need it. I<br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; no idea if I can even comlete the quest, but I will<br/>
&gt; look <br/>
&gt; that up shortly. Heh.<br/>
&gt; Anyone alive out there?<br/>
