<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983416170">hi, this is Beld from Fennin Ro! out of curiosity, has anybody else been<br/>
able to complete the SK quest in freeport that involves getting an item off<br/>
of Lady Shea? i&#39;ve been killing her for a week, no item, already posted it<br/>
as a broken quest but just want to be sure. by the way, even if you dont do<br/>
the quest, she is worth killing as she only affects factions in felwithe<br/>
(where you are already KoS) and she carries between 2 and 11 PLAT on her<br/>
every time ;) just make sure you are at least lvl 15 and free with harm<br/>
touch.. she&#39;s mean<br/>
<br/>
catch you around,<br/>
<br/>
