<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122111655">I have friends that have been buying for me. (feel like i&#39;m under 21<br/>
yrs old now :) )<br/>
<br/>
And as far the fletching skill as it stands:<br/>
From what i understand you have to buy them in bundles of 5 and fletch<br/>
them in those same bundles.<br/>
<br/>
This is unconfirmed, but, people were noticing a drastic reduction in<br/>
skill advancement per arrow fletched. It appears that the skill is only<br/>
checked once per bundle of 5 fletched, instead of 5 times (which it<br/>
really should be of course)<br/>
<br/>
I think we should be able to do bundles of 5 for when we just want to<br/>
make a whole mess of arrows, and not care about the skill advancement.<br/>
But when we are trying to advance our skill, we should be able to do<br/>
one at a time to get the skill check per arrow as before. Or make it so<br/>
there are 5 skill checks per bundle. As it stands though, we are forced<br/>
to do bundles of 5 only with only 1 skill check per 5. Not to mention<br/>
they raised the prices. Before each of the lamest components were 1Cp<br/>
each. A bundle of 5 is now 6CP each. Not real bad, but after making<br/>
sveral thousand arrows, it adds up. Dumb.<br/>
<br/>
But i am usually full of really stupid ideas anyway, so what do i know?<br/>
