<div id="ygrps-yiv-820043863">Well, I finally made 12th last night.  I have yet to <br/>
train my Meditation since I continued fighting till I <br/>
was comefortable enough that if I died I wouldn&#39;t lose <br/>
my level.<br/>
I have been thinking on my last name for a while and <br/>
have narrowed the scope a bit.  Cronik likes to travel. <br/>
I hate staying in the same zone for too long.  With that <br/>
in mind can anyone here help me choose a last name?<br/>
Something dark, not light  like Silverfoot, or <br/>
Windrider.  Maybe Bloodtoes, or Footsore or Darkstrider.<br/>
I like Darkstrider.  Any other suggestions welcome.<br/>
