&gt; I was in Neriak when I hit 9th, and the DE guild would<br/>
&gt; not train me cause I play a troll. grrr.  I went back to<br/>
&gt; Grobb and trained my magic abilities and my 1H Slash to<br/>
&gt; keep it up a bit.  Then I bought all the 1st Rank<br/>
&gt; spells. All righty then! kewl.  I zone to the swamp and<br/>
&gt; cast my first pet. NOT!!!!<br/>
&gt; &quot;Insufficiant mana to cast this spell.&quot; WTF!!! Try<br/>
&gt; again. Same thing. Mana cost: 40.  Hmmm.  Dam.  No big<br/>
&gt; deal really. Me not use one before. Is ok.<br/>
&gt; Next spell.<br/>
&gt; Invis to Undead. &quot;Insufficiant mana to cast this spell.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Crap! Mana cost: 40.<br/>
&gt; Great. The spell that makes a SK visible as a SK (pet) I<br/>
&gt; am too stupid (Int of 62) to cast!  And the spell that<br/>
&gt; will keep annoying green skele from attacking me I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; cast either.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is one of the nice things about the DE SK&#39;s.  I had no<br/>
prob summoning my pet at level 9 unless I fizzled (that was<br/>
before they turned down fizzle mana).  You&#39;ll be able to at <br/>
level 10.  My INT was the default DE (I think), 109.  I<br/>
through down spells like crazy, basically darknessing every<br/>
opponent I fight (funny when they start to run and just turn<br/>
around).  Can&#39;t wait for level 30:  Heat Blood, Invis, and<br/>
Feign Death!<br/>
<br/>
As to +INT items, at your level you&#39;d be better off with +mana<br/>
items, but the time will come when that will change.  I have<br/>
a silver sapphire necklace right now (4 STR / 4 INT)  A great<br/>
necklace for SK&#39;s, but it&#39;ll cost you 150-250pp depending on<br/>
teh jeweler.<br/>
