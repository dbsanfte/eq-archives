<div id="ygrps-yiv-943021218">Wow, like that idea.  Even thought that would most likely make a mage tank<br/>
as stated before (but is a Cleric Tank legal too then?).  Think you will<br/>
have to go to the equipment item base, the real question is how hard are the<br/>
quest going to be, like finding a Mammoth tusk, which I don&#39;t think anyone<br/>
has found in South K yet (which has been reported as a rare spawn).<br/>
<br/>
*Rant Start* -&gt; sorry<br/>
<br/>
Although I would like the remove disease spell, had rabies once (attacking<br/>
mummy) and 2 ppl group with me.  The didn&#39;t know what happened, I went<br/>
unconscious, they killed it (while I was unconscious), and with no healing<br/>
(and nothing attacking me) I didn&#39;t die.  With them being fairly new level<br/>
(7 or 8) and not knowing what was going on, I just sat for 90 minutes on<br/>
line unconscious eating bandwidth.... didn&#39;t make me happy (went and watched<br/>
TV for 90 minutes).  I know this would not have helped me in this case since<br/>
I was unconscious, but it would be nice.  Oh, and to add salt to the wound<br/>
they ungrouped with me and let me sit.<br/>
<br/>
(Brian) Could you talk to your programmers and if you are unconscious with<br/>
rabies take 1 hp away every 60 seconds or so.  I would have rather just died<br/>
than sit their like that for 90 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
*Rant End* -&gt; again sorry<br/>

Why not ty this instead... make the SK into an Anti-<br/>
Paladin (which we are supposed to be really).  Reverse<br/>
all cleric spells that heal for a Paladin and give that<br/>
to an SK as DD along with all the buffs that a Paladin<br/>
normally gets. After all we are not healers, but we are<br/>
the strong arm of evil and are to protect our kind with<br/>
the gifts of our dark gods.<br/>
