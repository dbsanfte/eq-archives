Hello all.<br/>
I play a 4th (almost 5th) level Shadow Knight Troll. I <br/>
plan on investing quite a bit in this character, but <br/>
want to know how to get food/water/weapons etc. <br/>
from &quot;good&quot; cities. The underground in Freeport doesn&#39;t <br/>
have any food vendors that I know of, nor does the Shady <br/>
Swashbuckler in the N.Ro tunnel to East Commons. <br/>
In Neriak I am &quot;looks at you dubiously&quot; but not KOS, and <br/>
I think I am KOS in Ogre-ville (I chose to worship Cazic <br/>
Thule). So that limits me to Grobb, RO and Commons, and <br/>
Neriak.<br/>
I won&#39;t even think of going to Faydwer for a long time. <br/>
Does the NPC merchant tents in South RO sell to Evil <br/>
race characters? I have seen it on a map of South Ro, <br/>
but haven&#39;t actually been out of Innuthule Swamp yet. My <br/>
wife did as her Troll, but hated playing it.<br/>
Another thing that worries me is that the Combine <br/>
Weapons sold by gypsies are not an option for a solo <br/>
player unless I get one at auction (which I am forced <br/>
into due to masive lag :( ) since they KOS me as well.<br/>
I enjoy the Troll, but need help to figure out a way <br/>
around these major milestones.<br/>
Any and all help is welcome.<br/>
