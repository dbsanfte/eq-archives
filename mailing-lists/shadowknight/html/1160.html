<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240815162">as the story goes (pieced together from many beta sk players and numerous <br/>
snippets of brad-talk etc...)<br/>
<br/>
in beta: melee fighters and hybrids were extremely powerful. sks were very <br/>
powerful. a troll sk was considered the strongest 1 to 1 class in the game <br/>
at lv50 by many.<br/>
<br/>
is this true now? absolutely not, in my opinion. i tend to think most anyone <br/>
would agree. unfortunately, the idea that we are gods at lv50 lingers to <br/>
this day (most people don&#39;t even know that boil and banshee were taken from <br/>
us, our skills cap low (bash, dodge, archery etc...), we have approx 50% <br/>
less hp than a warrior at any given level [my TSK will have just over 1400 <br/>
at lv50. as opposed to the 2100+ of a troll warrior.] etc).<br/>
<br/>
so, our penalty lingers even though our strengths don&#39;t...and...to give you <br/>
an idea just how severe the penalty of playing a TSK is. i created a human <br/>
monk and a troll sk, put them both in the same zone and had them both kill <br/>
the EXACT same mobs (lv1 bats) the troll gained approx 60% less xp than the <br/>
monk each kill and continued to xp at the same -60% rate for as long as i <br/>
played out the comparison (level 3).<br/>
<br/>
tis too bad i can&#39;t transfer all the xp from my tsk into a monk...he&#39;d <br/>
likely be about lv60 (after factoring in the exponential increases in xp <br/>
reqs as levels progress) =)<br/>
<br/>
brad/verant justifies this with &quot;you were told this race/class combination <br/>
was of HIGH DIFFICULTY in the beginning&quot;. yeah i was and that&#39;s all good, <br/>
but EQ is the only place i&#39;ve ever faced high difficulty without enhanced <br/>
reward.<br/>
<br/>
in the end, i&#39;m happy with my character and i&#39;ll continue to play him...but <br/>
some explanation of exactly what about our class is so godly that we deserve <br/>
last place in leveling speed would be nice and likely very entertaining.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;now, for the most part i&#39;m a &quot;happy sk&quot;. i enjoy playing the class, my<br/>
&gt;friends seem to enjoy having me tag along, and i tend to dismiss most of <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;complains as whines or just uninformed rants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;but one comment keeps coming up that i find it hard to just dismiss <br/>
&gt;offhand.<br/>
&gt;that is the fact that sk, along with the other hybrids, have an experience<br/>
&gt;penalty. and the question is, why? most sk (DE, troll, and ogre) have<br/>
&gt;additional racial xp penalties, making them by far the slowest levelers of<br/>
&gt;the game. but at high level, we really are not that much more powerful than<br/>
&gt;anybody else, if at all. in fact, necromancers and druids have no<br/>
&gt;discernable xp penalty by comparison, and, well, are incredibly powerful.<br/>
&gt;now that warriors have had a lot of beefing, and their xp remains the <br/>
&gt;same..<br/>
&gt;the xp penalty does seem to make less and less sense.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;an xp penalty assumes some sort of &quot;reward&quot; for reaching higher level..<br/>
&gt;which there doesnt seem to be for the hybrid classes at this time..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;not a rant, just an observation on the ONE complaint of others that i am<br/>
&gt;unable to readily answer :)<br/>
