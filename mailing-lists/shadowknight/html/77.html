<b>Subject:</b> How Can I Raise 2H Slashing? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031949981">I&#39;m a level 11 dark elf shadowknight, and while I love the 1H mino<br/>
axe/shield combo, I&#39;m also interested in using 2H weapons, especially if the<br/>
Dark Reaver turns out to be a 2H weapons. Howver I&#39;ve picked up a 2H sword<br/>
and only managed to raise the skill to 5, now it won&#39;t move at all (and<br/>
has&#39;t been for quite some time). Do I need to fight monsters that con blue<br/>
or something like that? Those of you who have successfully raised 2H please<br/>
let me know how you&#39;ve done it, although I suppose I&#39;ll always favor 1H<br/>
since I&#39;l need a shield to bash as a dark elf.</div>
