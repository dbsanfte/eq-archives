<div id="ygrps-yiv-927575944">i&#39;m sure hoping it works.. i recently did a quest for the DE rogues (using a<br/>
guise of the deciever of course) which resulted in a rather nasty hit for<br/>
freeport merchants.. they went from amiable to apprehensive :( in short, i<br/>
aint doing that quest again ;) at least i got a nice little whip out of it<br/>
that my wife seems to like.. :)<br/>
