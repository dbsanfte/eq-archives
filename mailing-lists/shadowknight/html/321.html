<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018149582">ok, the lvl 15 pet does not have magical attacks. it can bash however.<br/>
if you shadow step, your pet will not commit suicide, it&#39;ll just either run<br/>
to you, stay there, or keep fighting, depending on what you&#39;d been having it do.<br/>
pets are NOT allowed in duels. however, they may be allowed in guild wars..<br/>
they would make for some interesting strategies too :) to be absolutely sure<br/>
you&#39;d have to ask someone on rallos, which is set up more or less like<br/>
permanent guild war for everybody :)<br/>
<br/>
the dark elf npcs in the commonlands (dragoon zytl and kizdean gix) are not<br/>
KoS to human shadowknights. but they dont like us THAT much, so try to keep<br/>
your faction standings with the dark elves up.<br/>
