<b>Subject:</b> Hello? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-341995960">Greetings Everyone.<br/>
Since there have no postings for a while, I have decided to take it<br/>
upon myself to post one myself.<br/>
<br/>
This is another inquiry on the age-old art of fletching...again.<br/>
<br/>
Since the patch where, it seems anyway, we are forced to fletch 5 units<br/>
at a time, with the  skill increase remaining at 1 check per attempt,<br/>
instead of 5, has anyone had any difficulties making arrows?<br/>
<br/>
I really want to get my archery up (its currently very pathetic) but i<br/>
have been holding out becasue i actually want to make my own arrows.<br/>
But if the fletching skill has been &quot;gimped&quot; (i guess is the word for<br/>
it now) i may not bother and i will just buy the arrows.<br/>
<br/>
Any input on the &quot;new and improved?&quot; fletching skill would be<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
And on a related topic:<br/>
I had previously stated that most fletching components could be found<br/>
in Grobb. I have found out recently that this isnt the case. They only<br/>
have medium nocks there.<br/>
Friends had checked for me and they said that they found most of the<br/>
components. I assumed that it was Grobb that they were found in, since<br/>
that is one of my friends home town.<br/>
He will check in Oggok for me, its possible thats where they were.<br/>
<br/>
I appolgize for the misinformation.<br/>
