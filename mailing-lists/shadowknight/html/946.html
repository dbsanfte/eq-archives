<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662678404"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; No comment on the rest.  I used my pet just teh other day to solo guards<br/>
&gt; and such, not bad when you get him behind the mobs, double attacking for<br/>
&gt; 11-18 and bashing to boot.  Of course I was giving him decent (not<br/>
&gt; rusty) weapons and always kept him behind them.  So don&#39;t discount<br/>
&gt; them yet.  They are great outdoors for soloing, probably doing 200<br/>
&gt; or so damage in combat.  Not bad with Heat Blood and Engulfing going<br/>
&gt; at the same time.  Throw in a fear and a blue is dead with less than<br/>
&gt; a bar of damage to you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I completely agree that pets are useful for outdoor soloing. Very. But to<br/>
have one to two spells per level that do little but allow us to solo<br/>
outdoors ... well. Of course, I&#39;m looking forward to voice graft a great<br/>
deal and a loss of pets would kill that but ... well ... I think I would<br/>
trade my pet for a damage shield every level. No ... I *would* trade my pet<br/>
for a damage shield every level or every other or so. At 30 our pet does,<br/>
you say, 11-18 damage plus bash. I&#39;d trade that for 6 dmg damage shield that<br/>
is useable ALWAYS not just in outdoor soloing situations. I can see why<br/>
damage shields could be unbalancing however ... I just wish there was an<br/>
easy solution. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t care if troll and ogre SK&#39;s are better<br/>
than me because of that. I still enjoy to RP my human SK and I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
trade that for anything (cause I&#39;d&#39;ve been a wood elf druid if I cared!).<br/>
<br/>
later,<br/>
back to work!<br/>
