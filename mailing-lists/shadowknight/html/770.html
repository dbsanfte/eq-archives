&gt; As for running out of Mana (My Int is 115 btw), I actually can quite easily<br/>
&gt; in a big fight. Cast Darkness and Boil Blood a few times and suddenly your<br/>
&gt; OOM.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, that statement was made based on level 29, since I haven&#39;t <br/>
played much at level 30.  I&#39;m sure with Heat Blood I can chew through<br/>
some mana even faster.  I have a 113 Int, more if my guild jeweler<br/>
gets a little better<br/>

Question on Wave of Enfeeblement - how much does it siphon?  Is<br/>
anyone else using this?  I have a Dark Reaver so I switched to it<br/>
instead of siphon and rely on the proc to raise my str.  Casting<br/>
time on Wave is pretty long it seems.<br/>
<br/>
I saved myself with feign for the first time last night, the<br/>
casting time seemed reasonable to me (since I lived).<br/>
