<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946926357">Hey, I don&#39;t know if anyone still reads this list, but if so please give me a hand here.<br/>
<br/>
I just started a dark elf SK, level 6 now. I played a warrior to 31, so I know melee combat and all its ins and outs. What I need help with is spells, I&#39;ve never been able to use them before so I&#39;mma little new. What spells should I get at 9? at 15? etc. What are the good spell combos to use in a fight? Which have the best mana/damage ratios? These and a lot more questions are on my mind. Give me some feedback if ya got it. Thanks!<br/>
