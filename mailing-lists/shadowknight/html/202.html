<b>Subject:</b> Another use for Bone Chips... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-872785631">Welll.. I made level 15 a day or two ago, and got our rank 2 spells. Fine <br/>
and dandy. I had checked my inventory and I had about 13 bone chips. So I <br/>
did our next pet, Bone Walk, and went down to 11, as I expected. Though.. <br/>
what I didn&#39;t know, until now... was when you cast the spell:<br/>
<br/>
Numb the Dead<br/>
<br/>
it eats up another bone chip per casting. So.. just thought I&#39;d share with <br/>
everyone. Now I know why it seemd like I went from 11 bone chips to 0 when I <br/>
hadn&#39;t been casting my pet spell at all &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
