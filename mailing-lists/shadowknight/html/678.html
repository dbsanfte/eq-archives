<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480182054">&quot;twinked&quot; in my mind is when one of you or your friends high level characters gives you items or money that you couldn&#39;t reasonably obtain at your current level.  I, myself, bought a FS2HS at around 10th level for 5p.  It was a good deal, but good deals aren&#39;t twinks.  Now if someone sold me a Dark Reaver for 5p, then I&#39;d consider it a twink.  Gifts and such are not considered twinks IMHO unless you could not obtain them yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Lyguna gives you the Brutechopper (or other random item) through a quest.  Do not kill her, she is a nice Troll (although a bit of a heartbreaker of you ask Hulkuk).  Just talk to her, she&#39;ll tell you what she wants (a typical women, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, don&#39;t go into Guk unless in an experience group.  It is a deathtrap, apparently designed by Verant for taking levels away from people.<br/>

I made level 14 and am 1/2 way to 15 as of last night.  <br/>
I have noticed that &quot;non twinked&quot; varries quite alot by <br/>
definition.  Cronik is minorly twinked, but only because <br/>
a friend gave me a FS2HS when I was 9th or so which I <br/>
still use.  ;)  Evrything else has been bought with <br/>
earned cash.<br/>

&lt;snip&gt;ï¿½0A&gt;Levels 15-20:<br/>

Is it Lyguna in Innothule that dropps the Brutechopper? <br/>
What level is she?<br/>
In South Karana there is a named wolf that drops a claw <br/>
that is a good 1HS weapon.  Anyone know what level it is?<br/>
Or the Druid that drops the Silvery Scimitar? What is <br/>
the druids name?<br/>
<br/>
I have been waiting to go into Guk until I hit 15.  <br/>
Should I wait a bit more till I get to a higher level?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
