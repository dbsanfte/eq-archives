<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226906133">Ping Pong?  ping pong?  My problem is more like the way a pinball does in a<br/>
pinball machine between the bumpers.  I have been playing this game since<br/>
around Beta 3 and I have NEVER had a character above level 20 because I have<br/>
never stuck with just one long enough to get there.  I have about 9<br/>
characters that are all in the teens.  So I guess that makes me a<br/>
characteraholic.  Yeah...I feel your pain friend.<br/>

&gt;I am starting to have that itch again.  I think I am not<br/>
&gt;enjoying my Troll anymore.  Since I started playing my<br/>
&gt;Druid, I dread getting on as my troll. But I can&#39;t put<br/>
&gt;my finger on why. I haven&#39;t played Cronik in a week or<br/>
&gt;so.<br/>
&gt;I have /played my Druid for &lt;14 hours and am 2 bubs into<br/>
&gt;6th level.  I guess I have learned how to level rather<br/>
&gt;quickly with my class of choice.  This may be slow to<br/>
&gt;some, but for me it is astronomically fast.<br/>
&gt;I am in the middle of a mental debate on whether or not<br/>
&gt;to scrap him, sell everything, run to my druid, die and<br/>
&gt;leave him a big inheritance.<br/>
&gt;Anyone else run into this problem of character ping-pong?<br/>
&gt;Things at home are also very stressed, so that isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;helping either.<br/>
&gt;Thanks.<br/>
