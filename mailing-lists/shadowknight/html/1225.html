try not to reveal too much here, lets see if we can keep the raw details of<br/>
the lifeleech quest a secret from the general public as long as possible ;)<br/>
i NEVER want to see somebody auctioning &quot;lifeleech spell, 5000 plat&quot; ;p<br/>
<br/>
one thing tho: you WILL need lots of friends helping you by the end, and<br/>
just to start the thing you&#39;ll need 2000p cash on hand. sounds fun, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Beld Demonblade<br/>
Fennin Ro<br/>
<br/>
Sounds kinda like SoulFire for sks except that it&#39;s not a sword, this is<br/>
very cool indeed =)<br/>
As much as everyone wants to details I can understand how you wouldn&#39;t want<br/>
to give them away.<br/>
A few hints couldn&#39;t hurt tho hehe...<br/>
And perhaps you could tells us just what the spell does, a lifetap<br/>
obviously, but just how much life are we talking about here?<br/>
