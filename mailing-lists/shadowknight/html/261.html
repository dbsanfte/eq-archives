<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091378912">There is a canoe that takes you from the main land of Odus ( i think<br/>
its called) to the Kerran isle.<br/>
Has anyone tried taking this canoe all the way to Faydwer?<br/>
If the world wraps around, theoretically you could continue past the<br/>
Kerran Isle and eventually hit Faydwer.<br/>
Then again, maybe Norrath is flat and we&#39;ll fall off the edge into a<br/>
deep pit where sea monkeys will rescue us only to sacrifice us to their<br/>
almighty God, Bullwinkle.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, sorry about that, too much coffee.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, has anyone tried this?<br/>
