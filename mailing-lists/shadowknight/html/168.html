<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953038199">I had planned to try dueling a friend and cast Siphon on them to see if<br/>
it stacks on them, or if it wears off quickly, but just havent got<br/>
around to it yet. But I will post my findings as soon as i do, unless<br/>
someone beats me to it.<br/>
<br/>
Now as far as casting wasting a swing with a weapon, true it will, IF<br/>
you time it wrong. I always cast right after i swing. When the next<br/>
round starts, im swinging again as normal. When i time it like this, it<br/>
doesnt seem to take away any of my melee.<br/>
<br/>
And i did notice that when you cast Siphon, your ATTACK goes up the<br/>
same amount as your STR does.<br/>
<br/>
Plus what does it hurt to cast it. Its not a spell you absolutely need<br/>
to win a battle, so if it gets interrupted, who cares? But its good for<br/>
practicing Alter (i believe). This will help in the future when we get<br/>
more useful spells.<br/>
