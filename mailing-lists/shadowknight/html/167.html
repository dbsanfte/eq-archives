<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118695884">I did some testing on gnolls last night and I am pretty sure it helps to keep casting siphon on them.  It seems to wear off on them really quickly.  You may have noticed when fighting putrids that the weakness doesn&#39;t last all that long.  I now cast each time after I bash.  The enemy does way less damage.</div>
