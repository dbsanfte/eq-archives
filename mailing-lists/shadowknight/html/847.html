<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102447085">Well, life is harder for the dark races.  That little<br/>
notice you get on character creation screen isn&#39;t for<br/>
nothing.  I used to spend a very long time zoning as<br/>
well and I upped my RAM from 32 to 96 mb.  It&#39;s much<br/>
better now, although I&#39;ve already gotten used to the<br/>
speed increase and have to remind myself how much<br/>
slower it used to be.  <br/>
<br/>
I like hunting in souther ro.  The DE merchants there<br/>
give me better prices than either Oggok or Grobb.<br/>

&gt; I know you said you would not answer non-SK related<br/>
&gt; email, but this one does<br/>
&gt; in a way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why is it that only the evil races must zone to get<br/>
&gt; to a merchant? Every<br/>
&gt; other zone, with the exception of Dungeons, has at<br/>
&gt; least one merchant in it<br/>
&gt; except the newbie zone of an evil race.<br/>
&gt; Everfrost has the merchants in the tunnel<br/>
&gt; Steamfont has many merchants<br/>
&gt; Butcherblock has many merchants<br/>
&gt; Greater Fay has the entire city of Kelethin open to<br/>
&gt; Wood and High elves<br/>
&gt; Lesser Fay has the Ranger camp<br/>
&gt; Qeynos Hills has the house in the middle<br/>
&gt; Misty Thicket has the halfling huts<br/>
&gt; The Commonlands...<br/>
&gt; Kithicor...<br/>
&gt; The Karanas ....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why did Verant think it necessary to FORCE a<br/>
&gt; character of an evil race to<br/>
&gt; zone into a city to sell loot from the associated<br/>
&gt; newbie zone?  That has<br/>
&gt; been bugging me for quite a bit.  I hate having to<br/>
&gt; zone to sell.  The major<br/>
&gt; factor here is that it takes me 2-2.5 minutes to<br/>
&gt; zone one way.  If it only<br/>
&gt; took me 30 seconds like it does my wife, I may not<br/>
&gt; have thought it a big<br/>
&gt; deal.  It may be an oversight by Verant, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think it is a &quot;fair&quot;<br/>
&gt; way of doing things.  The all-or-none principle<br/>
&gt; comes to mind here.<br/>
&gt; End of rant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please respond to this one Brian, even if it is a &quot;I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Anyone out there think this is worthy of a Petition?<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
