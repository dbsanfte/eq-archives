&gt;<br/>
&gt; What Mob drops a Ruby that Lyguna is looking to collect?<br/>
&gt; I know the item does not say when right clicked on it<br/>
&gt; what Lyguna&#39;s description is. I hear that a Necro in<br/>
&gt; Feerot drops one. Is this correct? Any info would be<br/>
&gt; helpful.<br/>

Tings in Neriak for about 160pp, you can also get them in Highkeep (but<br/>
we&#39;re KOS there) and other cities too, I&#39;m sure.<br/>

There are possible things you can get for the ruby once you give them (one<br/>
at a time) to Lynuga.<br/>
<br/>
Brutechopper (most common reward) -- 16/50 2HS axe<br/>
<br/>
Midnight Mallet -- don&#39;t remember stats, mid-level shaman 2H hammer<br/>
<br/>
Ivandyr&#39;s Hoop (rarest) -- This is an earring that casters love, it&#39;s AC6<br/>
Int6 Wis6 I think, this is the jackpot. If you get one, feel very very<br/>
lucky. I got one as a newbie and traded it for dwarven work boots, and the<br/>
kicker is that I got ripped off! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
PS: You can sell back the Brutechopper to an NPC for 60pp and MM goes for<br/>
more. So it&#39;s like playing the lottery where 100pp buys you a ticket (160<br/>
for ruby, 60 back) and if you get a Hoop, look forward to crossing some<br/>
things off your wish list. :)<br/>
