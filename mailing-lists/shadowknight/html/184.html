<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624511127">I dont have any problem with making a Character more difficult to play, such<br/>
as boosting the EP requirements from level to level. This only makes sense,<br/>
especially taking into account some classes are more powerfull then others.<br/>
<br/>
My objection is that Godd vs Evil is not balanced out. There should be a<br/>
number of Good cities, a number of Evil Cities and the rest should be true<br/>
Nuetral cities where what you kill determines your relationship to the toen<br/>
not your chosen god.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a large philosophical discussion here as to whether certain<br/>
classes/races should, in fact, be &quot;easier&quot; or &quot;harder&quot; than others by<br/>
virtue of their abilities, by virtue of their faction, or if it should &quot;all<br/>
balance out&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
For example, some classes will be very &quot;easy&quot; to play -- good human cleric,<br/>
for example -- since they generally aren&#39;t KOS anywhere (except by evil<br/>
NPCs, which are much less frequently encountered than good NPCs), level<br/>
quickly, and stay alive for a while.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, there are the very difficult classes/races, e.g. a troll<br/>
SK, that levels very slowly, is fairly weak at early levels, has a very<br/>
difficult time travelling due to KOS issues, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So, do you &quot;bump up&quot; the latter so that they can compete in the game given<br/>
their faction disparity, or do you just say &quot;too bad, they&#39;re inherently<br/>
more difficult&quot;.  I tend towards the &quot;too bad&quot; philosophy -- playing evil<br/>
SHOULD be more difficult, however it shouldn&#39;t be so difficult that it&#39;s<br/>
absurdly so.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there is a wrong or right answer to this.  I think some<br/>
attempt should be made to balance all classes WITHOUT taking into account<br/>
faction, frequency of guild headquarters, etc.  After the classes are<br/>
balanced in a vacuum, then I think difficulty should be factored in by<br/>
virtue of guild availability and faction.  All else being equal, warriors<br/>
have the advantage of being a non-evil class and also having guild<br/>
headquarters in nearly every city.  By the same token, evil shamans<br/>
probably have a huge disadvantage due to poor faction and rarity of<br/>
training locations/spell locations. Anything that promotes travel is<br/>
inherently dangerous, unless you have invis and/or SotW.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I would like to reiterate that while my SK frustrated me, I<br/>
think it was for two main reasons, both largely my fault: I was playing as<br/>
a &quot;tank&quot; in a party with two other magic users; I was not role-playing<br/>
&quot;evil&quot;.  As a tank, I would have been better off with more warrior skills<br/>
(like dodge at a lower level, kick, parry, and dual wield) since my necro<br/>
jr. skills weren&#39;t nearly as relevant as our party&#39;s necro spells.  Thus I<br/>
should have been more &quot;task oriented&quot; (and in retrospect a barbarian shaman<br/>
would have been better for that party).  Also, since I wasn&#39;t role-playing<br/>
evil, I was suffering a significant difficulty disadvantage unwittingly and<br/>
unnecessarily.<br/>
<br/>
SKs can make sense, especially for solo characters.  I still think they<br/>
could be slightly improved so that SKs don&#39;t go through the 9th level<br/>
&quot;blahs&quot; and are more genuinely useful.<br/>
