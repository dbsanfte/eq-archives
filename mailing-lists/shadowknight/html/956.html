<div id="ygrps-yiv-564091396">hehe, sorry if part got lost. i killed princess lenya (the real one, not the<br/>
fake) in highkeep. her faction adjustment was EXTREME. after killing her<br/>
once, the faction changes with all but king tearis thex were so great that<br/>
killing her a second time could not affect those factions any more! my MM<br/>
faction can still go up by killing bards, but not by killing lenya. so if<br/>
nothing else we have learned a bit more about the way faction adjustments work..<br/>
