<div id="ygrps-yiv-354436564">You&#39;ll probably need a party for this.  I was working under the premise that <br/>
if you&#39;re out there, and fighting in unrest, you&#39;re in your late 20&#39;s <br/>
already because you need a wizard to be gating you out there.<br/>
<br/>
A full party of 24&#39;s should be able to do it.  Myself (28) and a level 29 DE <br/>
cleric did the camp ourselves.  The camp isn&#39;t very hard once you get the <br/>
spawns spread out.  Just that initial start.  Have a caster will make life <br/>
easier, and never leave home without your cleric.<br/>

 &gt; Enroute to Unrest in Cauldron, there&#39;s a camp of goodie tooshoes.  Polish<br/>
 &gt; them off and you&#39;re on your way to making &quot;the dead&quot; very happy.<br/>
 &gt; On a side<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just want to mention to those that may want to try this ... this is a very<br/>
very hard camp. They are all or very nearly all casters (clerics and druids<br/>
etc) and this is a hard place to run because of all the hills (trust me,<br/>
I&#39;ve fallen to my death here running from these schmose). I&#39;m 26 now and<br/>
they almost killed me yesterday when I was walking and not paying attention<br/>
and passed the exit (easy to do in the Cauldron). I would be wary of these<br/>
people still with a full group but it is probably possible ...<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a better estimate of when it is safe to wipe these folks out,<br/>
Princess? They are blue at 26, I think they were white and yellow around 19<br/>
but I can&#39;t remember for sure (it&#39;s been a long time since I was 19).<br/>
