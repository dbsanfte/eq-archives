<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725311662">I finally made 15th last night! Wohoo!<br/>
I have only used Clinging Darkness 2 times so far but <br/>
have not been able to judge how effective it is.<br/>
Now for my question, hopefully Brian can answer this one <br/>
for me.<br/>
Does Intelligence influence how often you hit your <br/>
target in melee?  Or is it the level of the target?<br/>
In Lavastorm last night while fighting with a DE SK I <br/>
noticed that I miss ALOT. This formed a pattern that <br/>
while he was hitting often verses a non-elemental/drakes <br/>
I was not.<br/>
I tried slight movement of my view to see if target <br/>
placement and closeness was a factor and it did not seem <br/>
to be so. My Int is 62, and his I&#39;m not sure of, but it <br/>
is alot higher even at DE default value.<br/>
<br/>
Second Question.<br/>
I am planning on entering South Karana to kill aviaks, <br/>
or enter Splitpaw. How bad is the KoS factor for a Troll <br/>
SK there?  I wil be entering from Feerot.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
