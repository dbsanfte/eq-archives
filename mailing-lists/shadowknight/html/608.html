<b>Subject:</b> avoiding guards :) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870860934">for starters, as a human sk i start off with a few less guard factions<br/>
that want me dead than most other sk. that said, i freely admit that i<br/>
spend virtually all my time on antonica (where there are at least SOME<br/>
guards that dont kill me on sight) and i do often make wall-hugging runs<br/>
:) tho usually the wall hugging is to avoid an unfortunate encounter<br/>
with a griffin or giant rather than a guard; i could kill one (possibly,<br/>
and then only veeeerrrryyy slowly) but i&#39;d rather avoid them altogether<br/>
unless i am hunting them on purpose. right now, the only cities i can<br/>
safely enter for sure are freeport, qeynos, and neriak, and there are<br/>
now places in qeynos where i am toast if i go past (a few too many<br/>
bloodsaber quests..) i MAY or MAY NOT be kos in kaladim now; i havent<br/>
checked recently, altho with all the gobbies i&#39;ve killed i would not be<br/>
surprised if i was tolerated in butcherblock. i am also safely dubious<br/>
to the guards of rivervale because of those same goblins; HOWEVER the<br/>
halfling cleric near the kithicor zone is still quite KoS and i can&#39;t<br/>
raise fac with her; so if i want to pass thru rivervale, i have to go<br/>
invis. any sk can eventually be safe in highpass by killing enough<br/>
gnolls and shralok orcs; humans start out as dubious there, evil races<br/>
default as KoS tho. just start whacking away at the critters in the pass<br/>
until the guards dont attack you any more :) i&#39;ve found a quest in<br/>
freeport (an easy one) that raises most factions in erudin, but the big<br/>
problem here is that it also LOWERS fac with erudite necros. which would<br/>
be our only reason for wanting to go past erudin, anyway :) still not<br/>
sure whether or not i&#39;m safe in erudin as a human sk of innoruuk, i have<br/>
yet to check. lastly, i am kos in both grobb and oggok, by virtue of my<br/>
humanity ;( i&#39;m hoping that i will soon be able to fix that for at least<br/>
one of those cities, but it will take some luck, and use of one specific<br/>
nodrop item which i do not yet posess.. hehe.<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps some<br/>
