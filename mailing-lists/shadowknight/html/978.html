Didn&#39;t those newbies realise you were evil?  Ah well, now I just need to do<br/>
the long trek through Rathe and Karanas as I&#39;m still KOS in High Hold.<br/>

I&#39;m trying to collect good faction with the SK guilds, to date I am <br/>
warmly in Neriak, warmly in Freeport, amiable in Qeynos, and amiable<br/>
in Mistmoore.  I thought it would take forever to go from glower up<br/>
to amiable killing Brothers Chintle,Estle, and Drash.  Then a friend<br/>
offered a suggestion from her work on the Stein of Moggok:  the <br/>
koalindl fish gives bloodsaber faction.<br/>
<br/>
I was level 31 (not a good time to die), and bored of killing the<br/>
Millers and guards, so I got a bind in Surefall, and headed to <br/>
Qeynos under a cloak of shadows.  Remember, Clerics and Paladins <br/>
cannot see invis, so I safely snuck into their temple and to the<br/>
pond where the protected fish are.  Once their, stay by the stairs<br/>
into the water, and pull them with a spell.  It will take about<br/>
3-5 fish to max your faction.  Also, the guards will not come to the<br/>
water, so you will be safe until you decide to leave (when you no<br/>
longer get faction messages).  <br/>
<br/>
You should have seen the look on the newbies faces when a dark elf<br/>
was killing their fish.  One told me &quot;Don&#39;t do that!  You&#39;ll be KOS!&quot;<br/>
I said &quot;Really?&quot; and pretended to be concerned.  Another offered help<br/>
getting out, which I declined.  He then asked for money... *sighs*<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, just bored at work and offering a tip.<br/>
