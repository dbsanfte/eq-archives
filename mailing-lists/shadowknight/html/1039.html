<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143805110">Ok so lets get this straight, you have to do this quest twice to get both<br/>
bracers.... Hmm.. Gee like once isn&#39;t enough...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that when you say it looks like rubi you mean it has that god<br/>
awful red color (I had rubi pants for about 3 minutes, couldn&#39;t stand how<br/>
they looked though, S. Plated are much nicer looking)..<br/>
<br/>
You know I keep expecting to hear good news out of these quest, but as of<br/>
yet it hasn&#39;t happened (Good stats on bracer overall though, with both it<br/>
would be a nice dex boost).<br/>
<br/>
Oh is it No Drop?<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy<br/>

We completed the bracer quest last night.<br/>
<br/>
8AC<br/>
3 DEX<br/>
Looks like rubi<br/>
<br/>
Heres the fun part.<br/>
<br/>
Both the Decaying Right and Decaying Left bracer along<br/>
with the Mino Shackles are needed.<br/>
Do you think that you&#39;ll be getting 2 bracers back<br/>
though?<br/>
<br/>
Bwahaha...that would make sense<br/>
<br/>
Nope... left + right + shackles = 1 bracer<br/>
<br/>
Up side is you get some nice XP for doing it<br/>
<br/>
I should have a SS before the end on the day<br/>
