<b>Subject:</b> SK Mana <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-145201949">i play a troll SK, and at level 9, with an int of 77, and<br/>
a conjuring of ~10, channelling of ~20, i could cast my<br/>
pet spell.  the mana calculator is badly off for hybrids. <br/>
now at 11 i have around 60-70 mana.  to find out how much<br/>
mana you have, just cast the sense undead spell over and<br/>
over, until you get insufficient mana.  then multiply the<br/>
number of times it went off by 5, and you have a rough<br/>
guesstimate of the amount of mana.<br/>
also, for bash, train one point in it, you get it at 6,<br/>
and if you train one point in it, you can press slam, and<br/>
when successful, you will bash for 5-7 dam.<br/>
