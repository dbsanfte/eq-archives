<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I think you&#39;re in the right place.&nbsp; Kill dervs 
in NRo/Oasis/SRo is my advice; the bronze weapons they drop should pay for 
plenty of food and water (and madmen&nbsp;drop 1-4&nbsp;water each).&nbsp; There 
are probably other places you can do just as well...but not a lot 
better.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">-- Basic stuff in case this is your first char: 
--</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Always fight at least blues (use /con to check out 
monsters).&nbsp; At your level you can probably still solo most blues, but 
you&#39;re getting to the point where it will be more efficient to find 
partners.&nbsp; Get in a group of similar level folks and kill dervs, which will 
most likely still be yellow or red.&nbsp; When you get to about 14, it&#39;s time to 
find bigger stuff, the orcs and crocs in Oasis are popular.&nbsp; After a few 
more levels you have several choices -- Lavastorm, Lake Rathe, South 
Karana...keep in mind, this is all from the perspective of a troll, so I tended 
to hang out closer to Grobb than, say, Qeynos.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never hunted in WC, 
for instance.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">At 20-25, you can start hanging out in 
Cazic-Thule.&nbsp; This is good because it&#39;s the only zone where decayed armor 
drops; this is the (no-drop) building blocks for your SK quest&nbsp;armor 
(Darkforge).&nbsp; When you hit 30 and can&nbsp;invis yourself, you may be able 
to loot decayed from other folks&#39; kills if you ask real nice and don&#39;t train 
mobs on them.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Even if you&#39;re fighting the right stuff, though, 
the rate at which you make levels drops off fast.&nbsp; I think the exp per mob 
varies with mob level ^ 2, and the exp you need for a level is kinda like level 
^ 4, which means that the differential for each new level goes as level ^ 
3.&nbsp; End result:&nbsp; for each new level, you need to kill a number of 
monsters that&#39;s roughly proportional to your level -- and it gets tougher and 
tougher to kill mobs of your level, so you need to group with (and share the exp 
with) ever-larger groups.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">(The math above may be off by a power one way or 
another, but the end result is correct, I believe.&nbsp; There&#39;s a web site out 
there that explains it all, I forgot the URL.)</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, SK&#39;s pay an experience penalty of (I think) 
40% compared to other classes.&nbsp; The good news is that when you&#39;re in a 
group, this penalty gets spread over the group...so group all you can.&nbsp; 
=)</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Basically, you&#39;ll just have to deal with not making levels as fast as you 
have so far, and you&#39;ll have to get smarter and network with more people just to 
continue your forward progress...but then again, that&#39;s part of the fun.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hopefully some of this was useful.&nbsp; Good luck.</div>
