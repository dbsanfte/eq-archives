<div id="ygrps-yiv-192187232">So far these are the quests ive done and what i<br/>
received for them. All in Qeynos<br/>
<br/>
Kill Drosco: Sometimes a spell, little cash and Trumpy<br/>
Quest<br/>
<br/>
Trumpy: Kill him, bring in his Head. Little cash and<br/>
his skull back for next quest.<br/>
This ticks me off because if youre a goodie you can<br/>
kill him bring in his head and get the BloodForge<br/>
Hammer.<br/>
<br/>
Trumpy&#39;s Skull: Bring it to Grimrot so it can be<br/>
reanimated. Some cash, nice XP for my level at the<br/>
time. 2 of us got nothing else, 2 got minor items.<br/>
Onyx and raw hide cloak. <br/>
<br/>
All that work and we received squat. VERY<br/>
disappointing.<br/>
<br/>
Kill Milea Clothspinner: brought back her cloth. got<br/>
little cash and a rusty mace and a low level cleric<br/>
spell. no new quest.<br/>
Again VERY disappointing. Here i was level 10 or<br/>
under, walking thru East Karana and taking on Milea<br/>
who was red. (i did have help, but thats not the<br/>
point) And i get a rusty mace.<br/>
<br/>
Kill Paladins and turn in their Amulets or prayer<br/>
beads. I couldnt get this one to work for the life of<br/>
me. But others have and they say the payoff was<br/>
nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Kill Arlena for Grimrot: this is in Mistmoore. Im only<br/>
level 25 so thats out of my reach still.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my question:<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone done these quests recently or any of the<br/>
Freeport quests and gotten anything worthwhile.<br/>
The Trolls now have a couple good ones, and the<br/>
goodies can kill the same target and get weapons that<br/>
can sell for 100Pp.<br/>
What do the Human Sks get now?<br/>
<br/>
Have any of these Qeynos quests been upgraded or any<br/>
added since ive been there? Are the Freeport quests,<br/>
Steadirt in particualr, working?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
