<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101365721">i may not be an expert on mailing lists, but this one seems pretty damn<br/>
quiet. there&#39;s gotta be something to do with it :) like an rp argument of<br/>
Innoruuk vs Bertoxxulous for who makes the better god for SK.. or just<br/>
updates with any hints people come across that lead to how to obtain the<br/>
darkreavers (or other SK holy weapons). even if you just find something<br/>
really interesting (black-colored plate mail? a rare SK-only spell? what<br/>
happens if you max your faction with the crushbone orcs and give king crush<br/>
a hail?). we gotta make NOISE here! too much silence drives me nuts, and you<br/>
dont wanna see me when i&#39;m nuts ;)<br/>
