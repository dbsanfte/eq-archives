&gt; is it really fair to not help us out with info here? after all, the ONLY way<br/>
&gt; you can know where the lists are located is if you do the PALADIN quests<br/>
&gt; that relate the locations! raltur gives you NO hints, and as an sk of<br/>
&gt; innoruuk, lady shae wont tell me anything no matter what i do. giving her<br/>
&gt; beer doesnt help. shouldnt she at least have a note that says her bayle list<br/>
&gt; was stolen by x? i know you cant do anything about that tho hehe..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i&#39;ve heard rumors of how the rest of the quest goes.. but even so it is<br/>
&gt; terribly unfair for verant to give us a quest we cant complete without<br/>
&gt; reading paladin spoiler sites ;p<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, you&#39;re right about that, I did have to read the Lady Shae<br/>
spoilers to get the first part.  Once you turn that in, though<br/>
you get enough info to locate the other parts.  I don&#39;t know how<br/>
you would do this as an SK except paying someone else to do it for<br/>
you.<br/>
