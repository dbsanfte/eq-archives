&gt; Just as a quick note, the Necro and SK VE are the same spell but do totally<br/>
&gt; different damage.  The question is: Why?  It should work the same for both<br/>
&gt; classes.  I don&#39;t see a Rangers heal do less then half of a druids.  Or a<br/>
&gt; paladians heal do half of a clerics for the same spell.  If the spell is<br/>
&gt; going to act differently should have a different name.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would guess teh damage is based on our level being 8 levels lower<br/>
than the necro using it.  Rememeber, since we got spells at 9th, our<br/>
effective level in casting (and for mana) is 8 levels lower.  My VE<br/>
is getting better at about 1HP / 2 levels I think.<br/>
