<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123219577">Yes I have done this quest.  The paladins do drop the amulets, but not<br/>
always.  If you get one, consider keeping it, becuase it gives +10hp and<br/>
+5char.  I sold one for 4pp.  If you decide to give it to the bloodsabers<br/>
you get a little xp and an item -- in my case it was a rusty broadsword.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful though when hunting them, because there is one that has killed me<br/>
3 times already even though he conned green.  As a matter of fact he killed<br/>
me and my buddy sk (both of us level 11 at the time) at once.  This guy (I<br/>
forgot his name) only punches for about 8 damage but does so increadibly<br/>
fast.  He was from the temple of life.  I have only found orders of thunder<br/>
on my victims.  Never have I seen a prayer bead.<br/>
<br/>
Now, about finding them.  They seem to spawn randomly, but about every 10<br/>
minutes at least.  The best place to wait is by the QH zone border, becuase<br/>
they spawn there and run someplace (T1 I think -- but maybe only if you are<br/>
attacking) and back.  As far as I know they are about he only NPC&#39;s running<br/>
that path -- so con them from a distance and look for 2 names or whether it<br/>
says too far to inspect.  Note that the farther you have to chase them, they<br/>
farther you must go to the zone if you have to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
You can lure them easily, either with a spell or with an arrow, but catching<br/>
them and striking first with a melee weapon is very hard.<br/>
<br/>
It can be quite frustrating waiting around for them so I don&#39;t do this quest<br/>
anymore, but I still strike one down if I happen to see him.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I received a Kill Paladin quest from a SK Guild Master in the Shrine of<br/>
&gt; Bertoxxulous in Qeynos.<br/>
&gt; Now we are supposed to kill the Paladins that run the path in W.<br/>
&gt; Karanas and turn in either their Prayer Beads or House of Thunder<br/>
&gt; Amulets.<br/>
&gt; Now the first thing i did was kill Brother Trintle who hangs out by a<br/>
&gt; tree in W. Karanas. When I turned in his beads, I got exp, and was then<br/>
&gt; promptly killed by that same GM. This is when I learned that poor<br/>
&gt; Brother Trintle was a mole for our organization inside the Temple of<br/>
&gt; Life.<br/>
&gt; OK<br/>
&gt; Now, next time we were out there, we saw 2 guys beating up on Trintle.<br/>
&gt; We killed the 2 that were trying to kill him. I tried talking to<br/>
&gt; Trintle afterward and he still babbled about Rodcet Nife.<br/>
&gt; I took one of the Prayer Beads to the GM, and he said &quot;Thank You&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Thats all. :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I then killed one of the Paladins actually running, and he didnt drop<br/>
&gt; any Beads or Amulets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question is, has anyone successfully completed this quest, and who<br/>
&gt; did you have to kill?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Bathory<br/>
