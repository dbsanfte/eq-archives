<div id="ygrps-yiv-326305939">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
Good to see a little action on the SK list again! I just thought I&#39;d add my<br/>
2 cp worth.<br/>
I play a Human Sk on Veeshan. Just a bub off lvl 28 now and hangin for my<br/>
new spells! I&#39;m still mostly in banded but quite a few magical pieces on me<br/>
such as Barbed arms, grotesque mask and black crown. I carry a Bibs for 2H<br/>
and a PGT with cracked darkwood for 1H. I&#39;ve founbd that in a small group of<br/>
less then 3 I&#39;m better off with the 1 H since it is more of a defensive<br/>
setup while in a larger group dmg done is more important so I use the bibs.<br/>
I also carry a Dragoon Dirk in my range slot foir the Dex bonus which means<br/>
I can&#39;t carry my beloved Ashwood Bow<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My favourtie story would have to be when I dueled someone. The whole diel<br/>
lasted 30 min which is more of a marathon. Using a combination of shadow<br/>
step and attckking I employed hit and run tactics. Eventually I succumbed<br/>
having only done 127 dmg total 8( I don;t feel too bad however since the<br/>
person I was dueling was a lvl 38 Necro when I was just lvl 26. Imagine what<br/>
it would have been like if we had been close in lvl! I trully beleive the SK<br/>
are nest best duellers after the Casters and even then we can give them a<br/>
run for their mioney!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;&#39;s about it for me!<br/>
I&#39;ll keep in touch!<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting to you all!<br/>
