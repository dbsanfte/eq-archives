<b>Subject:</b> lvl 22 and such <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-994576901">i also FINALLY made it to 22 today. and here is the raw deal on the &quot;new and<br/>
improved&quot; vampiric embrace: you cast 30 mana, and while it lasts you MIGHT<br/>
occaisionally draw about 6 hp from the target. add to this the fact that,<br/>
like all other random weapon effects, this is based on dex. so if you are a<br/>
troll or ogre, you can more or less forget ever even getting that 6 hp once.<br/>
and it doesnt even really last very long. is verant intentionally picking on<br/>
us SK players, or do they just not get it?<br/>
<br/>
as for engulfing darkness, despite the high casting cost of 60 and that it<br/>
casts a bit slow, i found it works fairly well. like so many other things<br/>
the actual duration of the spell is fairly random, so sometimes it lasts for<br/>
a long time and sometimes it wears out quick. at least it works better than<br/>
clinging darkness so far.<br/>
<br/>
like Trian said, the least disappointing spells for me at this level are<br/>
ward undead and deadeye. now while i can hit for 35 damage twice a round<br/>
with my bone bladed claymore, and ward undead does about 41 max, it isnt all<br/>
that useful other than an additional attack against undead. deadeye is quite<br/>
useful to us humans at least; i can see! i can SEE!<br/>
<br/>
i didnt have as many problems casting the pet.. but somehow it doesnt seem<br/>
as bright as our lvl 15 pet. the bone walk spell makes a pet that will NOT<br/>
attack something unless it attacks you first or when ordered, but i&#39;d swear<br/>
that the convoke shadows pet took the initiative and attacked a deepwater<br/>
caiman without me telling it to.. i&#39;ll keep messing around with it and see<br/>
what happens.<br/>
<br/>
now i&#39;ve heard that they have exchanged the higher level spells banshee aura<br/>
and boil blood with lesser magics. does anybody have any idea why they are<br/>
continuing to WEAKEN us? since shadow knights are some of the few classes<br/>
that rate as high difficulty (ALL shadow knights are high difficulty, even<br/>
those big buff trolls apparently), shouldnt we be getting more rewards<br/>
instead of fewer? just a few thoughts from a rather dissapointed midlevel<br/>
player..<br/>
