<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309971737">the BBC is deep in the dungeon of befallen, occasionally wielded by a troll<br/>
shadowknight of around lvl 16. however, that area of the dungeon is very<br/>
nasty, full of necro npcs and a whole host of undeads. for soloing, i<br/>
recommend you be at least lvl 25 (23 or 24 for troll sk) to make sure you<br/>
can reasonably avoid hits from most attackers. if you group, a full sized<br/>
group of lvl 18 and up should be able to handle themselves. just be sure<br/>
that you grab several glass keys from the ogre sk on level two before you<br/>
come down, because it is bad news if the one with the key loses his link and<br/>
causes the key to disappear!<br/>
<br/>
as for the paladin in firestorm, i believe he appears at random locations<br/>
throughout the area. this makes fighting him rather frustrating, because he<br/>
typically gets killed by fire elementals very soon after he appears. he is<br/>
in the vicinity of level 9.<br/>
<br/>
to the best of my knowledge, you can&#39;t MAKE snakeskin. you have to find it,<br/>
and for the life of me i cant remember where it is at exactly right now.<br/>
i&#39;ll get back to you later today on that.<br/>
