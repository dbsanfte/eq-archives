<div id="ygrps-yiv-562868418">Something I was just thinking of with HT and resist. One of the first times<br/>
I attacked a HG I accidentally hit HT (moved the button since then) right at<br/>
the start of combat, needless to say not only was it fully resisted but it<br/>
really pissed him off and he stepped on me (I was lvl 30 btw). The next time<br/>
I engaged a HG (still lvl 30) I hit HT just as we were all about to zone (us<br/>
all down to the last bubble but so was he). This time it went off for full<br/>
damage (very red HG btw), allowing us to finish him off (actually that plus<br/>
my Heat Blood finished him anyway). I have to totally agree with what Beld<br/>
said about HT (if you haven&#39;t read it you really need to). When used in the<br/>
method that he states it is a very effective last save..<br/>

Ok, here are me 2 PP...<br/>
The damage done on HT is a little low.  I agree that if <br/>
you get a full group of high level SKs together that pop <br/>
HT all at once there could be abuse.  HOWEVER, most SKs <br/>
don&#39;t use HT offensively and there aren&#39;t that man that <br/>
group together (at my level anyway). Most use it as a <br/>
last ditch effort to save their ass.  I was one of those <br/>
until Mr. Beld gave me advise that changed how I look at <br/>
SKs. This stems from the fact that at low level you are <br/>
paranoid about not having HT ready to use. Most don&#39;t  <br/>
out grow that view. Also, getting that many SKs focused <br/>
on one MOB is death for that MOB anyway. :)<br/>
<br/>
I would say increasing the amount of damage to 15*level <br/>
is a reasonable increase. This is because most times you <br/>
will not be attacking 1 MOB, but several. The overall <br/>
effect of 1 MOB dying will not overbalance the <br/>
situation. It may allow you to win, and if you die, you <br/>
won&#39;t get the XP from killing the HTed MOB anyway. It <br/>
will help a solo SK tremendously (heh).<br/>
<br/>
On resisted HT...<br/>
In a group against a RED MOB that is 3/4 or better <br/>
health my HT is resisted alot so that instead ot 141 HP <br/>
it does 36 (ak!).  On the same level MOB that is at 1/2 <br/>
to 3/4 health the damage increases and the number of <br/>
resists went down as well.  Same level MOB at 1/2 or <br/>
less had no resists and full damage every time.  I had <br/>
several very patient groups that helped me with this <br/>
over the last few days.  I did this to see exactly what <br/>
tactics would work best for me to use it in.<br/>
This tells me that to start combat with HT against a <br/>
higher MOB is a waste.  Strategic use in group is best.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You say giving SKs Lifetap and/or other spells would <br/>
make SKs into tank Mages.  In effect, we are just as <br/>
Paladins are tank Clerics. This is not such a big issue <br/>
because clerics are not as limited as mage classes <br/>
equipment and ability wise, so to transfer the abilities <br/>
to a Paladin is not adding too much that a cleric <br/>
couldn&#39;t already do.<br/>
<br/>
Why not ty this instead... make the SK into an Anti-<br/>
Paladin (which we are supposed to be really).  Reverse <br/>
all cleric spells that heal for a Paladin and give that <br/>
to an SK as DD along with all the buffs that a Paladin <br/>
normally gets. After all we are not healers, but we are <br/>
the strong arm of evil and are to protect our kind with <br/>
the gifts of our dark gods.<br/>
Heh.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit tired, so flame on!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Okie dokie, seems like getting a consensus is NOT going to happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So let&#39;s try another approach: what WOULD you like to see about the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>class to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;make it more viable?  The reason the high level shields and DoTs <br/>
 </span></blockquote>were pulled<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;is because (believe it or not) a lot of the players here are SKs <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and as such<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;know the class real well and giving them those capabilities made <br/>
 </span></blockquote>them into,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;literally, tank mages.  It&#39;s a scary sight seeing these guys at work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I&#39;ve stated before, the thing that hurts the SK class are primarily <br/>
 </span></blockquote>race<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;issues -- a damage shield on a human or DE SK is not unbalancing, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>however it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;IS unbalanced if you put it on a troll or ogre SK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what can be changed that makes the class more viable for non-big-races<br/>
&gt;but at the same time is not unbalancing for trolls/ogres?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know HT comes up a lot, but there is a fear that HT could end up <br/>
 </span></blockquote>being<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;heavily abused (worst nightmare....party of 6 50th level SKs stand <br/>
 </span></blockquote>around<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Mr. Named Mob that only pops once a day anyway, BAM 3000HP gone instantly<br/>
&gt;and you now have a mob that starts the fight at 1/2 HP).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If HT was upped slightly, had a slightly higher recharge rate, etc...what<br/>
&gt;are your suggestions?<br/>
