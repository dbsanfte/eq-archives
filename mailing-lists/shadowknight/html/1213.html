&gt; yep, the gate guards drop them at least 80%...though if you aren&#39;t doing the<br/>
&gt; killing yourself expect loot competition from scores of newbs looking for<br/>
&gt; easy xp from a freeport quest that involves the helms...they wouldn&#39;t leave<br/>
&gt; us alone when i went for mine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i have a near complete df suit. don&#39;t like the two-tone look at all. greaves<br/>
&gt; should match boots as a rule. i would rather have seen a 100% blood red<br/>
&gt; suit.<br/>

look.  Of course, I&#39;m still using my dwarven boots and darkmail<br/>
gauntlets, so if I can just get a black bracer I&#39;ll be set.<br/>
