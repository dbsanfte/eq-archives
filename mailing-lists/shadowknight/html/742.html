<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112899515"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Okay, here&#39;s a question for you folks.  What if Shadow Step and<br/>
&gt; Voice Graft were replaced with some kind of lifetap spells?  Would<br/>
&gt; this be grossly unbalancing or hurt the class?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personal Opinion but I would be upset if either of these spells were<br/>
removed. Especially Shadow Step. Shadow Step has saved my life on countless<br/>
occasions. It is fast casting and often gives me just enough of a headstart<br/>
to escape in an outdoor situation.<br/>
<br/>
As for Voice Graft. Granted, it has no PRACTICAL (i.e. exp. gaining) use. My<br/>
feeling is this however -- it has wonderful RP uses and this is an RP game<br/>
after all. When I reach 30 I plan on using Voice Graft to set up some<br/>
interesting quests with my friends. Yes, it is quite easy to just give a<br/>
quest yourself, but how much more involving would it be if say a town guard<br/>
gave the quest out? I have a feeling that it will be gone by the time I ever<br/>
reach 30 (23 for 2 months, now been 24 for a month).<br/>
<br/>
My feeling on lifetaps is that, if the past examples are followed, they<br/>
would be a waste because when we normally get spells, they are highly nerfed<br/>
versions of necro spells. Vamp Emb doing 12 at 22? Necros have it do 74 at<br/>
20 (According to Stephen aka Morgul the black). What would this mean that<br/>
our lifetap spells do? Not a lot. And as Thomas pointed out, then we have to<br/>
disengage in battle while casting and they are slow, meaning either we get<br/>
interrupted a couple of times while casting or step off and let our comrades<br/>
take a beating. All this for how many HP&#39;s? Probably not many. And how much<br/>
damage are we LOSING in melee during that period? Not to say that lifetaps<br/>
couldn&#39;t be made viable, but following the similar path that our other<br/>
spells have I do not believe that simply throwing us a lifetap will make<br/>
much of a difference when you consider all of the variables. What it would<br/>
allow us to do is solo better (fight, back off while pet gets a hit and<br/>
lifetap or at end of battle, lifetap some wussy stuff) but since we aren&#39;t<br/>
supposed to solo (and I personally hate soloing, just too dang boring) this<br/>
is a moot point.<br/>
<br/>
Other random thoughts on this discussion that have passed through my mind as<br/>
I have read.<br/>
<br/>
Reclaim Energy: Useless if you use it the same way a magician uses it ... to<br/>
get a better pet. HOWEVER, in the right situation it is a GREAT spell. In a<br/>
long battle when you are casting a lot, have a pet up beforehand and have<br/>
reclaim energy memmed. When you get low on mana, reclaim your pet. Your pet<br/>
has done a bit of damage and, well, now you just got three free bubbles of<br/>
mana. Think of it as a walking (if you are 30, talking) mana storage<br/>
facility, that happens to fight for you on the side.<br/>
<br/>
Disease Cloud: 5 dmg but what many people don&#39;t realize is that this is an<br/>
excellent taunt. Even more effective than our taunt skill. Combine the two<br/>
and you have a very powerful ability to keep foes off you. When fighting<br/>
with wizzies and such a bit higher than me I put this on my main keypad and<br/>
constantly hit it (right after swinigng my weapon) along with taunt. I&#39;ve<br/>
kept foes off wizzies 8 levels higher than me with this.<br/>
<br/>
Mend Bones: Hmmm. No, I really have hardly used this spell. Only times I<br/>
have have been when trying to solo.<br/>
<br/>
Endure Cold: I really don&#39;t mind this. If you ever duel a shaman, be sure to<br/>
have this up. You will wipe the floor with him and he will be confused. :)<br/>
<br/>
Shadow Step: Hasn&#39;t been mentioned much except just now by Brian but I love<br/>
this spell. It is always memmed (except when in tight dungeons where it is<br/>
useless) and I keep it on my &quot;emergeny pad&quot; right next to Harm Touch.<br/>
Shift-5, 5, 6 equals Harm Touch and Shadow Step. Also quite convenient to<br/>
get down from the top platform on the aviak tower quickly. Try it sometime<br/>
if you don&#39;t use it.<br/>
<br/>
Numb the Dead: Great spell with a minor problem. It uses bone chips. For the<br/>
infrequent amount that I use this spell, I&#39;m not going to carry an extra<br/>
stack of bone chips around for this, rendering it all but useless unless I&#39;m<br/>
near a newbie zone where someone is selling bone chips which is never.<br/>
<br/>
Darkness Line: Simply put, it is wonderful. I&#39;m sure all SK&#39;s agree.<br/>
<br/>
Dark Empathy: Not extremely useful in a full group but I have saved two<br/>
lives with it (both of which ended up meaning I saved my own life too as I<br/>
would have died without their help). I usually keep it memmed at this time<br/>
for lack of more effective spells. And it works great on newbies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If we tune the SK we can&#39;t really ADD new spells, since this<br/>
&gt; would give them more spells than the other hybrids at each rank.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aww, give us more! We&#39;re special! ;)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all for now. Turned into a novel but hope it helps.<br/>
