<div id="ygrps-yiv-734861395">i just did a lot of fire beetle eye quests. when i first entered the lodge<br/>
(after lvl 9.. silly neriak ghouls) the npcs were indifferent to me. but i<br/>
had high enough initial faction to do quests. if your fac is too low to do<br/>
quests the very first time you enter the lodge.. i don&#39;t know what to tell you.<br/>
