<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-377147829">As far as where to find a 2h sword....its hard to find one in town...i&#39;d do<br/>
an ooc or auction request and see if anyone has one to sell you....expect to<br/>
pay around 2 gp....you can buy regular steel ones for 26 platinum in the<br/>
back of the shadowknight guild in Neriak or in the blue flame store in the<br/>
Commons of Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
As for your practice points....I&#39;d use them to advance a different skill<br/>
like smithing or tailoring....other than that, yes, I&#39;d save them....being a<br/>
dark elf your intel is so high that your skills raise extremely fast....I&#39;ve<br/>
got around 25-30 skill points saved and i don&#39;t plan to use them on anything<br/>
for quite some time. maybe for double attack later down the road.......<br/>
<br/>
hope this helped a bit....<br/>
