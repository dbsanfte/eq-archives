<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340127091">Well, I don&#39;t know what day this was sent, but I went to <br/>
Splitpaw Friday night.  The lag in the Karanas was <br/>
terrible. I had a mage-type cast invis on me before I <br/>
went through S.Karana alone.<br/>
Splitpaw sucked major sh**. I was there the 1st night at <br/>
peak gaming hours and there were only 5 people in he <br/>
entire dungeon. 3 of those were 25th +.  The second was <br/>
a 16th level half-elf (don&#39;t remember what class, but <br/>
she could heal).  We grouped and I died in the 1st fight <br/>
with the commander and Rex Ren. Thank Thule I was bound <br/>
in Oggok and not Neriak!<br/>
The next day I was solo (and the only one in it) most of <br/>
the time and I learned the dungeon by heart very <br/>
quickly. I hardly got any XP for all the gnolls I <br/>
killed, but faction adjustment with the residents and <br/>
Qeynos guards went up... not sure how much though. I did <br/>
get good loot (cloth armor) and cash from the guard <br/>
gnolls though. I was tempted to try the very back room <br/>
with the 4 Shaman in it, but they all conned blue to me <br/>
and I knew better than that! <br/>
Wandering around a 17+ zone (S.Karana) didn&#39;t make me <br/>
feel very comefortable so I returned to South Ro after <br/>
getting bound in Grobb.  Looks like I&#39;ll be killing <br/>
Dervs for a while. :(<br/>
<br/>
Where besides Commonlands Oasis and Ro would be a good <br/>
place for a 15th level SK to get to/adventure solo while <br/>
looking for a group? KoS is a big factor here.  :)<br/>
