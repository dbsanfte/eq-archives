<br/>
A couple things to talk about, with you in particular.<br/>
<br/>
1. What were the spells that SKs had removed from them back during beta,<br/>
before the game went final? Like Boil Blood, Banshee Aura, etc.<br/>
<br/>
2. Why were those spells removed? If we can get some insight into Verant&#39;s<br/>
reasons behind the removals, then it will make it easier for us to come up<br/>
with a &quot;least-offensive&quot; change that we (the SKs) would like.<br/>
<br/>
3. I think it&#39;s great that someone from Verant is on this list and not just<br/>
listening, but actually polling us on what we would like to see changed.<br/>
Additionally, I do so enjoy seeing this list alive again. :)<br/>
<br/>
4. I understand that no new spells can just be added without a corresponding<br/>
loss of some. But I think we need to hold this as two separate<br/>
conversations -- i.e. first we need to decide possible spells (or<br/>
spell-lines) to be added, and THEN concentrate on what we&#39;d give up for<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
5. I would personally prefer damageshielding over lifetapping. If you think<br/>
about it, lifetapping is one of those non-melee spells, meaning that you<br/>
have to step back out of combat to really effectively cast them. Being a<br/>
tank-type class, that really isn&#39;t feasible for us, and I think this is<br/>
being overlooked. A damageshield, on the other hand, is like VE, you cast it<br/>
before the fight (when your puller says INC) and then it just works<br/>
throughout the fight. Sure, shielding doesn&#39;t give us healing like a lifetap<br/>
does, but I actually agree with Beld after thinking about it -- giving us<br/>
real healing will (a.) draw fire from other hybrids, and (b.) overbalance<br/>
the class. Shielding won&#39;t change anything unless you&#39;re actually getting<br/>
hit, and then it&#39;ll be very nice to see 8hp a pop (or whatever). Think about<br/>
it folks, as a tanking SK, which would you rather have -- a spell that can<br/>
heal you but you can&#39;t cast, or a spell you can put on beforehand that&#39;ll<br/>
work without you worrying about it? For me, the choice is clear -- damage<br/>
shields all the way.</div>
