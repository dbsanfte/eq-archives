<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986888746">Yes we do, and our limit is 75 as well. Took me a while to figure that one<br/>
out ... I was getting really frustrated as my skill didn&#39;t go up after that<br/>
level!!! If you are asking whether to work on archery, however, I would<br/>
highly reccomend it. It takes a year and a day to get up, but it is very<br/>
worth it, especially when you are older and can afford a nice bow. I can&#39;t<br/>
wait for a darkwood.<br/>

&gt; think theirs is 75)?<br/>
