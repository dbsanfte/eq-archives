<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291503640">There&#39;s a few options for you.  There&#39;s always the<br/>
boring old combine/well balanced weapons.  But more<br/>
interestingly, I&#39;ve seen several shadowknights go with<br/>
a bladed thulian claws from aof in cazic along with a<br/>
shield.  There&#39;s also an obsidian scimitar that is a<br/>
rare drop off the goblin foreman in sol a.  Personally<br/>
I think that might be a nice look for a eurdite sk. <br/>
Those are the options that occur to me right off the<br/>
top of my head.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more and also that<br/>
Kunark will bring more options as well.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hello All,<br/>
&gt; This is my first post to the list and I have only<br/>
&gt; recently become<br/>
&gt; interested in the ShadowKnight class.<br/>
&gt; I started an Erudite SK with a vision of a shield<br/>
&gt; and sword combo.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; learning that starting a character<br/>
&gt; with a vision can be quite disappointing!  My<br/>
&gt; efforts to find a nifty<br/>
&gt; magical sword (1H Slash) have actually<br/>
&gt; been the thing that has met with disappointment, the<br/>
&gt; character himself is<br/>
&gt; quite interesting and fun to<br/>
&gt; play/ role-play. At any rate, I was wondering if I<br/>
&gt; am just overlooking<br/>
&gt; something....  Are there ANY 1H Slash<br/>
&gt; SK specific weapons that don&#39;t come from the Planes?<br/>
&gt;  I have been watching<br/>
&gt; reports come out Kunark,<br/>
&gt; and it would seem that NPCs there are only capable<br/>
&gt; of dropping 2H Slash or<br/>
&gt; 2H Blunt weapons<br/>
&gt; (perhaps only a SLIGHT exaggeration :) ).  Failing<br/>
&gt; SK specific weapons,<br/>
&gt; what would the recommendation be?<br/>
&gt; ...and sadly, a SS:Ykesha is going to be quite out<br/>
&gt; of my grasp for a<br/>
&gt; while....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
