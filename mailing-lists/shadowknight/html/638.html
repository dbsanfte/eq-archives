<div id="ygrps-yiv-240489595">Some info for you regarding Lady Shae.  I was outside the Freeport west gate waiting for someone, when she walked out the gate.  She was immediately killed by a Dark Elf (didn&#39;t check class) who was apparently waiting for her.  I don&#39;t know if this is triggered or just a regular routine for her, but her little walk may cause her to carry different drop items.<br/>
