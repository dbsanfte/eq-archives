<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003450367"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ahh, this would be true as well. If the power given to the SK class relied<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on much Mana, (which lifetap does), then perhaps this would be the way to<br/>
go. But, I really dont think lifetaps are going to help the SK class much at<br/>
all, except for cutting down down time at lower levels...<br/>
Perhaps we should focus on mana dependent change rather than an item<br/>
change... Mana is one thing the small races might have going for them moreso<br/>
than the large races..<br/>

&gt; Lifetap helps Human/DE more because they have more mana.  And Trolls<br/>
&gt; have regen so they don&#39;t need it as much.  As it stands, it&#39;s hard to<br/>
&gt; run out of mana, even when constantly fighting.<br/>

&gt; too much mana)<br/>
