&gt; Not sure on mana drain (I&#39;ve heard very inefficient) but here is the max Hp<br/>
&gt; drain..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lifetap (Sk Lvl 9, Necro lvl 1) - 5Hps<br/>
&gt; LifeSpike (Sk Lvl 15, Necro Lvl 4) - 11Hps<br/>
&gt; LifeDraw (Sk lvl 30, Necro Lvl 12) - 45Hps<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The word I&#39;m think of is useless.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s better than Reclaim Energy, Mend Bones, and Voice Graft.  Being <br/>
able to use all my mana for more than half my hit points at level 33<br/>
is not a bad thing in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how you can complain about this.  Sure, we could probably<br/>
pick out better spells, but this is definately an improvement.  If<br/>
I&#39;m soloing, I can use these to half my downtime, or as a healing<br/>
boost once a mob is snared and running (in place) at the end of a fight.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my math on this for my Level 33 DE SK:<br/>
HP:  845<br/>
Mana:  700<br/>
LifeDraw:  45 Hps for 63 Mana<br/>
<br/>
So, I can cast 11 lifedraws at FM, which is 495 HP.  Granted, <br/>
that&#39;s an ideal scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Is that not enough healing for a damage oriented class?<br/>
No hybrid will get bind or gate, so what other rank 1,2, and 4 spells <br/>
could they have given us?<br/>
<br/>
When it comes down to it, I have an option I never had before, and<br/>
that I cannot complain about.<br/>
