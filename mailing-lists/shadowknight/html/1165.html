<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033872173">Yes, the ltr was camped yesterday by a level 50 warrior and a level 50<br/>
wizard.  Sucked, cause I still needed one piece of equipment. All the level<br/>
35s had to go hunt elsewhere. Guess we will see there newbies decked out in<br/>
our armor, while we are still wearing bronze. 8(<br/>

&gt; &quot;The no drop stat change is intentional, to balance the power of the<br/>
armor.&quot;<br/>
&gt; -Brad<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; good impression? i think it embodies the cryptic and seemingly mis or<br/>
&gt; uninformed explanations that V&#39;s public figurehead dishes us rather well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; really though, i tend to think this change was implemented to please the<br/>
&gt; largest number of players. sad as it is, newbies and the elite alike<br/>
despise<br/>
&gt; no drop equipment for the exact same reasons. it discourages twinking.<br/>
these<br/>
&gt; days the question around the newbie zone isn&#39;t &quot;where do i get that?&quot; or<br/>
&gt; &quot;what kind of group do i need?&quot; it&#39;s &quot;how much?&quot; or &quot;how much?&quot; or &quot;sell<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; yours?&quot;. while the elite on the other hand, feel they are being done a<br/>
&gt; severe injustice every time they come across some leet lewt that can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; easily be transferred to their twink projects (or sold to the<br/>
afformentioned<br/>
&gt; newbies who amass mounds of plat with the latest greatest pietinesque<br/>
&gt; sploit). so, by changing the no-drop stat they keep these two large and<br/>
&gt; vocal groups of players satisfied.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; though, you would think that someone over there at VHQ would have noticed<br/>
&gt; the stream of lv45+ campers who started monopolizing the TR after the<br/>
change<br/>
&gt; in stats became common knowledge. personally, i&#39;ve counted at least 4 5+<br/>
&gt; hour decayed camps by very high level players since the change, no suprise<br/>
&gt; that not one of them was an sk. (i guess someone will say this can be<br/>
&gt; reported under verant&#39;s new &quot;play nice rules&quot; but the last time i<br/>
&gt; reported/petition anything the response took well over 4 hours to arrive<br/>
&gt; with the end effect being 0 due to the guide&#39;s apprectice status.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; kg<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; btw - to add to the frustration of an idiotic change like this. anyone<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; complete the quests...ranger, bard, wood elf, human...so, now you have not<br/>
&gt; only the threat of high level farmers but mid level quest sploiters who<br/>
hunt<br/>
&gt; the TR or auction for spare decayed so that they (a human ranger for<br/>
&gt; instance) can grab a gate to Fay and make 1/2 bubble or more xp for every<br/>
&gt; piece they complete.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; why should a non sk be able to start or complete a quest for an sk ONLY<br/>
&gt; item? (i know i already answered this with my own hypothesis but it would<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; nice to see what everyone else thinks. especially a verantite if they<br/>
happen<br/>
&gt; to read this.)<br/>
