<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223715673">That was a really good response Beld.  I currently play an ogre shadowknight<br/>
lvl 22 on Povar.  I haven&#39;t really tried the fear and then chase to get a<br/>
few hits in, but I definitly like the sound of it.  I normally hit with a<br/>
darkness spell, then a str sapping spell and melee away.  My warrior side is<br/>
much better than my spell casting side, so I play the tank mostly.  I always<br/>
try to group with a cleric if possible.  Also, I TOTALLY agree with having<br/>
your pet, I even try to get one when in a group.  This morning I was<br/>
fighting in Highpass Hold (MY GOD, how many do I have to kill before I can<br/>
go into HH :)  )  and they drop a lot of the rusty weapons.  I gave my pet a<br/>
rusty mace and he was hitting in the range of 15-18.  Very nice little<br/>
addition.<br/>
<br/>
I have almost full bronze on finally, with a few exceptions.  I have a<br/>
grotesque mask, and I finally got a greater zweihander (sp), which reminds<br/>
me, i&#39;m selling a  2handed well balanced, magical axe on that server which<br/>
normally sells for about 550 from the shady guy in the ecommons/nro tunnel.<br/>
I&#39;m selling it for around 300 if anyone is interested.  I am also curious as<br/>
to what type of armour/items other ogre sk&#39;s are wearing and any suggestoins<br/>
they might have.<br/>

&gt; Wow, Beld, excellent response, this is exactly what I was looking for. The<br/>
&gt; great thing is I&#39;m on Fennin Ro too. I&#39;ll be sure to ask you some<br/>
&gt; things in<br/>
&gt; game now that I know you&#39;re there. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again, man.<br/>
&gt; Dravith (13)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS: Also, any character descriptions I&#39;d love to hear. Tell me about your<br/>
&gt; race, level, equipment, weapon, favorite spells, etc. I just wanna hear<br/>
&gt; about other SKs, what they&#39;re wearing, how they&#39;re living... Thanks.<br/>
