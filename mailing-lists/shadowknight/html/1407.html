<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861269897">If your interested in roleplaying a DE then you can get lots of material<br/>
about how DEs, or the Teir&#39;Dal, from the &#39;Library of the First Born&#39;<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://firstborn.eqhq.com/)">http://firstborn.eqhq.com/)</a>.  There is a whole role playing section on<br/>
there that makes good reading.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, act arrogant.  Remember that as a Chosen of Innoruuk and one of the<br/>
&#39;Firstborn&#39; race you have the right to do as you wish.  Add to this the<br/>
Honor of being a Knight of Innoruuk, blessed in His Eyes.  I like to add a<br/>
little dedication to my god into this as well, where I will go out of the<br/>
way to seek the death of others, or die in the attempt in an overly arrogant<br/>
manner.  Works great on PvP servers  8)<br/>

Subject: [shadowknight] Newbie here :) with questions..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I recently created a DE Sk..and have a question about role-playing <br/>
the character. Now she is looked on by most to be evil...yet..would <br/>
she not have a different view of herself?<br/>
<br/>
Would she believe herself, her race, and God are not the evil ones?  <br/>
How can that really be roll-played..and remember this is a total <br/>
newbie to role-playing here. <br/>
<br/>
I have other characters..but seem to find my little Sk the hardest to <br/>
figure out :(<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions? Or any relevant info or guids on the web I can look <br/>
up?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! :)<br/>
