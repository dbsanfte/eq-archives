<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990425517">You do not need to do any other quests to get the<br/>
Arlena quest. All you need to do is &quot;Hail&quot; him for<br/>
that one.<br/>
<br/>
As far as payoffs. At least when i did them, which was<br/>
quite a while ago, there was no great rewards. Though<br/>
i will say that they were indeed fun to do. Most<br/>
however will be extremely easy for you now. They are<br/>
mostly for level 12 and under.<br/>
<br/>
The Arlena quest is a 30 plus though.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as Grimrot goes, we went on 3 different<br/>
trips and waited an hour each time before he finally<br/>
showed up.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

&gt; I am an Innoruuk worshipping Shadowknight so I am<br/>
&gt; not particularly welcomed<br/>
&gt; in Qeynos (um, does this have anything to do with<br/>
&gt; the 20 or so guards I have<br/>
&gt; killed? Heh) but I was wondering, do all the Grimrot<br/>
&gt; quests originate in<br/>
&gt; Qeynos, or can I just talk to Grimrot himself? I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; currently in S Karana<br/>
&gt; anyways, but can&#39;t ever seem to catch him. I have no<br/>
&gt; idea who this Arlena is<br/>
&gt; but I hope to find out soon if I can ever catch this<br/>
&gt; guy. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How many SK quests are there in Qeynos and are there<br/>
&gt; any that are worth it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
