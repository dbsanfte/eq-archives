<div id="ygrps-yiv-869420855">I&#39;ve just reached the 15th level and am having a blast with my new<br/>
spells.  My question for more experienced shadowkinghts is, is clinging<br/>
darkness cumulative?  In other words if I cast it on an npc twice am I<br/>
getting twice the effect, or is there no difference.  Also, how long<br/>
does the effect persist for?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been using fear, but it seems to fizzle quite a bit.  It&#39;s<br/>
been very handy when I&#39;m low on health from fighting something and then<br/>
get jumped by a fire elemental or something.  I usually try to switch<br/>
targets and fear the new attacker so I can finish off the first and<br/>
run.  It gets a bit dangerous when I&#39;m under a bubble and fear keeps<br/>
fizzling though.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
