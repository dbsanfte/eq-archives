<div id="ygrps-yiv-467028943">I think the change sucks, from the perspective of a large race. Many<br/>
dungeons are bugged, cant even walk into sola, get back down the stairs in<br/>
unrest, etc. This change hurts the large races bad, and came way too late,<br/>
atfer everyone and the brother done got it. Now large races are dependent on<br/>
shamans to enter the dungeons. Sucks to depend on 1 class. Maybe they will<br/>
throw out a shrink type item, course prob require getting a rare pop off a<br/>
dragon or something. I also feel like all the real cool items are gone.<br/>
Manastones, guise, jboots, etc. On the older servers so many people already<br/>
have these, and the ogrew that got there late will have to stand and shout<br/>
will pay for shrink at the dungeon entrance, while other people just click<br/>
on there mask. I am sure you smaller race shadowknights like the change<br/>
though.... Dont see why they waited 9 months to do it....<br/>

&gt; Non Dark Elfs probably won&#39;t like this as much, but it looks as though the<br/>
&gt; Guise is no longer dropping. There is a new mask dropping that gives the<br/>
&gt; same effect but must be worn to be used. As a Dark Elf I love this change,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s nice to get some of my identity back..<br/>
