<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587846794">I&#39;m not sure if this is broken or not (maybe just on our server), but we did <br/>
that for 12 hours straight over 2 days and the mino hero never spawned.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with that.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Mino hero doesn&#39;t spawn in the caves I don&#39;t think.  I think he<br/>
&gt; &gt;spawns south of the caves behind the big gears.  Seems to be on a<br/>
&gt; &gt;2-4 hour spawnn, perhaps killing the wandering Mino&#39;s in Steamfont<br/>
&gt; &gt;helps?<br/>

&gt;The Mino Hero spawns by the large gears to the left of the caves. Also to<br/>
&gt;get the Hero to spawn faster take out Melderath and his guards (Evil Gnome<br/>
&gt;with 2 Mino Guards), as soon as they fall the Hero usually spawns.<br/>
