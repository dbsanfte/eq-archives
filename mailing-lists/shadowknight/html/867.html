&gt;Sir Lucan is in the top floor of the Militia baracks <br/>
&gt;(the first building you see as you enter West Gate from <br/>
&gt;the Commonlands, in a room by himself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The person you are to meet/kill is the Shield Merchant <br/>
&gt;in the last hut in West Commons. This guy also wanders <br/>
&gt;around that part of the zone. If I remember correctly <br/>
&gt;that is.  I was part of a Paladin Holy Sword mailing <br/>
&gt;list and it involved going to find someone in WC to give <br/>
&gt;them a note.  They in turn gave you a note to return to <br/>
&gt;someone else.  I think this also involved turning around <br/>
&gt;very quickly and following someone that spawned behind <br/>
&gt;you, and killing them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The paladin half came down to:<br/>
&gt;Getting a note from the Marr Temple, giving it to the <br/>
&gt;Shield Merchant in WC to warn him about something, <br/>
&gt;getting a note to return to someone else, killing the <br/>
&gt;above NPC that spawns, taking his head or another <br/>
&gt;something from him back to the Temple.<br/>
&gt;This is quick and dirty, and may also have changed <br/>
&gt;somewhat.  To find out for sure, go to the Paladin list <br/>
&gt;archives on Onelist for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Holyswords@onelist.com">Holyswords@onelist.com</a> (may want <br/>
&gt;to search for that as the name of the list is fuzzy) and <br/>
&gt;scan through it.  It may take a bit, but it is worth a <br/>
&gt;try if you really, really, really want answers. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this helps you out.  It has been a while since I <br/>
&gt;actually did anything Paladin related so things may have <br/>
&gt;changed. Good luck.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Which part of Freeport is Sir Lucan in?  I can travel freely in <br/>

<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt;&gt;think once upon a time I could travel in Freeport, but then I discovered<br/>
&gt;&gt;Krazen Loosh...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The note for Sir Lucan is gained somewhere in the West Commonlands, <br/>
<br/>
&gt;I also<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; believe that this quest is the exact reverse of a paladin quest, <br/>
<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; paladins have to find and save this character, we have to kill <br/>
<br/>
&gt;him....<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;So I have heard, but I want to do all the steps so I can see if <br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;there&#39;s some hint in there someone has missed.<br/>
