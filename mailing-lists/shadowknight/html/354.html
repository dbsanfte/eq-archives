<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178204418">actually, fear plus darkness plus archery seems like a damn nice combo, and<br/>
i&#39;ll have to try that.. the only problems are that fear takes a damn long<br/>
time to cast (making it hard to use succesfully while you are being pounded)<br/>
and both spells have a more or less random duration.. so dont try to do this<br/>
unless you are also capable of fighting up close or chasing the critter down<br/>
if one or both spells wear off :)<br/>
