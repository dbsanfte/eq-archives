<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736585768">The tiny daggers and pine needles are *extremely likley* bugged melee<br/>
weapons. I have seen them and tested them just enough to make sure they are<br/>
actually bugged, and then I have /bug&#39;d them and continued on my way. They<br/>
are melee weapons and help in the melee slot, there is absolutely no reason<br/>
they should help out your archery skill. It would be very cheap and possibly<br/>
an exploit to use these.<br/>

&gt; one of those needle thingy&#39;s which are like daggers but use the archery<br/>
&gt; skill.&quot;<br/>
