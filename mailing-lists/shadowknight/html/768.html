<div id="ygrps-yiv-269179767">As for running out of Mana (My Int is 115 btw), I actually can quite easily<br/>
in a big fight. Cast Darkness and Boil Blood a few times and suddenly your<br/>
OOM.<br/>
<br/>
Quite thought though, I would like to see FD cast quicker. I group with<br/>
monks a lot and for them it is a great skill, but by the time I need it I<br/>
can&#39;t cast it fast enough.<br/>

&gt; The only thing I can think of that would make the small race SK more<br/>

&gt; medium small only.<br/>

&gt; Item that large races cannot wear, that are SK only, do I see the<br/>

have regen so they don&#39;t need it as much.  As it stands, it&#39;s hard to<br/>
run out of mana, even when constantly fighting.<br/>

(In a group recently, the enchanter claritied me!  lol!  Talk about<br/>
too much mana)<br/>
