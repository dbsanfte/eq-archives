NO!<br/>
Brian, please tell the admins at Verant to make all class specific armor NO<br/>
DROP again!  This was one of the few quests in the game that my Troll was<br/>
looking forward to aquiring HIMSELF! I don&#39;t care how long it takes me to<br/>
get a complete set, I am going to get it all myself, without help (ie buying<br/>
it from another player) except from my guild members whom storm the dungeons<br/>
with me and help me get what I need. Having to get all the items myself to<br/>
get armor that was meant for my character added MISSING elements to<br/>
Everquest... Roleplaying, Teamwork, and FUN.<br/>
I want that back.<br/>
Sorry Brian, I am not attacking you, just venting frustration. And hoping my<br/>
voice will be heard by those who changed it in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This brings up other topics that have bugged me for quite a while. Get ready<br/>
for a RANT!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, here goes.<br/>
Last night someone with the Flaming Paladin sword (Firey Avenger?) and a<br/>
Barbarian were in Nektulos Forrest bashing on the guards at the bridge.<br/>
After killing 2, another roamed by and attacked them.  I&#39;m sorry, but anyone<br/>
who just bashes guards for the fun of it is a loser!  So, I looted the body<br/>
of one guard (I was playing my Rogue at the time) to keep the losers from<br/>
gaining anymore than they had already.<br/>
A 1st level female SK was watching and said &quot;Let them loot their kills. It<br/>
is the honorable thing to do.&quot;<br/>
I said &quot;I will not stand around and let anyone profit from killing our<br/>
guards if I can help it. If I was strong enough, I would have punched a<br/>
guard to get it to follow me, collected a few and trained then into these<br/>
2.&quot;<br/>
She said &quot;by right of conquest, they earned what was on those guards.&quot;<br/>
I said &quot;I don&#39;t care. #1, I&#39;m a rogue. I steal to make my living. #2, they<br/>
are of the Light and invading my homeland, and I have more of a right to<br/>
slight them in anyway I can while in my domain. #3, you are a Shadow Knight<br/>
that is forsaking her god, and her people by siding with them.&quot;<br/>
She did not reply, but Mr Avenger said: &quot;You can come kill our guards if you<br/>
like. I do. lol&quot;<br/>
I said &quot;I plan on it. And that makes you a traitor to your people and to<br/>
your god as well.  Neither of you are worthy of your gods!&quot;<br/>
I was so fed up I logged off immediately.<br/>
<br/>
It just struck me wrong all the greed that goes on in this game.  I do not<br/>
agree that every DE that is created has the principles of Drizzt Do`Urden<br/>
(spelling?) and travels the lands with those of the Light, yet also returns<br/>
home anytime they want without penalty.  Dark Elves would no longer be<br/>
feared and loathed if this were true. I am a firm believer in the RP aspect<br/>
of this game.  If you choose and evil race/class, play it the way it was<br/>
meant. Granted, unless you solo, you will beforced most of the time to group<br/>
with good races, but the dynamics of the game require it sometimes.<br/>
Afterall, DE Clerics don&#39;t grow on trees.  In these situations, the<br/>
character is using those of the light and their kind hearts.<br/>
Anyone else fed up with the garbage that happens and is accepted as a way of<br/>
life besides me? This is upsetting me very much and I honestly cannot figure<br/>
out how to put it into words.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AND<br/>
<br/>
A 1st level DE SK cam up to my 5th level rogue and said &quot;Can you give me<br/>
some stuff? You know: money, or armor, etc.&quot;<br/>
I said &quot;ROTFLMAO!  Your joking right?&quot;  I then proceeded to Hide/Sneak away<br/>
from his sorry a$$.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot stand Whiney, beggers that EXPECT you to just give them the banded<br/>
off your back!<br/>
I have given away plenty of stuff. my TSK has given away a complete set of<br/>
Mesh armor, a Woven Tunic, and a Cracked Staff to a newbie mage that helped<br/>
me out as a thank you. I would have died in a nasty spot if they hadn&#39;t<br/>
helped me. They didn&#39;t ask or expect anything.  When they asked how they<br/>
could repay me, I said to help her dark brothers and sister like you did me.<br/>
GREED! AK!<br/>
Evil is ok. Heh. But the extent to which blatant abuse of the &quot;GIMMIE,<br/>
GIMMIE&quot; rule is disgusting. I do not ask for anything of my hello players<br/>
except a pleasant RP atmosphere. Some people just don&#39;t get it. I will<br/>
accept gifts. Generally these gifts have been within the normal level range<br/>
for my characters. The biggest thing that I would have no chance in the PoF<br/>
of getting were the Blackened Gauntlets my rogue has.  This was from my<br/>
guild leader as I had absolutley no armor and my newbie dagger.<br/>
<br/>
AND<br/>
<br/>
The XP penalty thing. Why on Norrath do TSKs get a 60% XP penalty? (this<br/>
trusts the earlier post that mentioned this is correct) Even in AD&D, a DE<br/>
gets a what 25% race penalty, and most kits also have a -10% penalty? I<br/>
think this is correct. Feel free to let me know otherwise. =)   True, this<br/>
in not AD&D, but that 60% scenerio is a bit steep IMHO.  I do not agree that<br/>
just because I chose to be Evil that it should take me, or anyone else over<br/>
twice as long to level when our opposites (Paladins) have basically the same<br/>
abilities and limits not counting HT or Complete Heal. That factor alone<br/>
unbalances the game. If the game is biased against those of an evil<br/>
alignment, put it in plain English how. If it already is, can you show me<br/>
where? I have put alot of time and effert into my TSK, and I enjoy playing<br/>
him. It makes me sad to think that just because I am evil that the gods of<br/>
Verant punish me so in XP when everyplace else in the world they have<br/>
created is also biased against me (kos).<br/>
In spite of all this I will continue to RP my TSK and have fun. I am not<br/>
really out to be a Powergamer. I like the RP aspect very much, though it it<br/>
is also very lacking. However, the people I adventure with are passing me<br/>
up, and quickly. Pretty soon, I will not be able to adventure with them as I<br/>
will draw more creatures to the group and die more often. You all have<br/>
probably seen this type of thing before, or even had it happen to you. If<br/>
you figured a way around this, plz let me know.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long rant, but I needed to get that out after last nights<br/>
