<b>Subject:</b> Re: 1hs vs 2hs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-895687993">i also use 1hs weapons. i&#39;m not sure about other&#39;s experience, but for some<br/>
reason my 1hs skill seems to raise much more rapidly than my 2hs skill. also<br/>
i prefer the speed of one hand weapons, because for some ungodly reason my<br/>
hit rate is terrible, and the more chances to hit i get the more damage i<br/>
do. the ability to bash is also useful. besides, if you have a polished<br/>
granite tomahawk, what use have you for a two hander? ;)</div>
