Wow. very precise. However, I refuse to go into Oasis. I hate Oasis, always<br/>
have and will.<br/>
<br/>
At 13 I think I was in Lavastorm taking out the Drakes as my TSK. Then I<br/>
moved to PAW (this was before the update), and also Derv Camps but didn&#39;t<br/>
get past 16th level.<br/>
<br/>
Any other suggestions? These look good, especially with Darkforge Armor<br/>
pieces coming from CT.<br/>
