<div id="ygrps-yiv-519993579">A couple of considerations.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it matters when you pick up archery. I didn&#39;t until 15th.<br/>
Since 75 is the max, it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
You will be able to hit stuff with it just fine. I have no problem at all at<br/>
23rd level.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, kiting is boring, and you&#39;d need to carry a few BOXES of arrows with<br/>
you. I don&#39;t kite.<br/>
<br/>
Pulling--I always use my bow when pulling, especially outdoors. Yes, I use<br/>
darkness, but as I run in, instead of just running straight to my group, I<br/>
just turn around once in a while and fire off an arrow, run, fire, run ...<br/>
etc. By the time I get it in, I&#39;ve usually knocked off 50-150hp. It hardly<br/>
takes any more time, and that is that many more HP we don&#39;t have to deal<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
Runners -- when OOM or with afast runner, it is nice to put an arrow in<br/>
their back.<br/>
<br/>
That said, archery is not a *critical* skill, but it is one that is very<br/>
nice to have. I only use an elm bow still (14dmg max) and I still do quite<br/>
well with it. It will take you some time to master it (depending on how good<br/>
your int is (de/human or troll/ogre?)) and just how much you practice it. I<br/>
play with a group of friends, so I was able to practice it quite a bit when<br/>
I picked it up. Took maybe a week or so to get it maxed (same as when I<br/>
picked up piercing at 21).<br/>
<br/>
Let us know how it goes? Maybe we can wake this list back up (god knows I<br/>
need something to do at work ... and I&#39;m so busy I can&#39;t play EQ for a week<br/>
or two!!! So everyone, start posting!! :D)<br/>
