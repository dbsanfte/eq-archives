<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150992214">Regular beetle eyes will work for the first quest,just go collect all 10 of<br/>
them and bring the box back to the Lodge of the Dead.before you hand him the<br/>
box open it up and hit the combine button,this will close the box and<br/>
automaticly attach it to your cusor.now give him the closed box and you will<br/>
have completed the first stage of the quest and gain some small amount of<br/>
Exp. He will then say something about what a good job you did and offer a<br/>
second ,more difficult quest to you. This quest involves collecting 4 fire<br/>
beetle eyes in a box much similar to the first one but these eyes must come<br/>
from Kerra Isle. Also,you must bring back a Bull Elephant tusk which can be<br/>
found in the plains around Qyneos. I have yet to complete the part of the<br/>
quest but hop to do so this week end,I will keep all abreast of my progress<br/>
and if any of you have completed the quest I would be very corious about the<br/>
reward. Also as we are KOS in Qyneos and must pass thru there to reach the<br/>
boat that goes to Kerra Isle I would like info on how to get to the docks.I<br/>
have been told those of evil herratige must take the sewers under the city<br/>
to get there and they are quite confusing,thats what I am told anyway,any<br/>
info you all mat have would be great.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

&gt;I just finished a quest I got in the Lodge of the Dead to gather 10<br/>
&gt;beetle eyes in a box.  I put 10 fire beetle eyes in, but when I returned<br/>
&gt;the box all I got was the NPC saying &quot;worthless junk&quot; 10 times.  Anyone<br/>
&gt;know what kind of beetle eyes he wants?  Needless to say this was<br/>
&gt;frustrating.<br/>
