<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081639322">Personally I think they should double the damage that VE does or make it go<br/>
off twice as often (either way). It wouldn&#39;t really unbalance the Necro side<br/>
since they don&#39;t engage in melee that often (at least they shouldn&#39;t be). <br/>
<br/>
By the way as an interesting side note, SK&#39;s rock in PVP at the later<br/>
levels. I beat a lvl 40 monk last night in a duel (Lvl 35 SK). I actually<br/>
ended up kind of kiting him. We were in Freeport Arena so it was hard to do,<br/>
but I kept hitting him with Eng. Darkness and Heat Blood while I used Shadow<br/>
Step repeatedly. Oh and I finished him off with HT before he could mend.<br/>
(Engulfing Darkness is a great counter to someone using J. Boots BTW)..<br/>

&gt; Just as a quick note, the Necro and SK VE are the same spell but do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>totally<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; different damage.  The question is: Why?  It should work the same for both<br/>
&gt; classes.  I don&#39;t see a Rangers heal do less then half of a druids.  Or a<br/>
&gt; paladians heal do half of a clerics for the same spell.  If the spell is<br/>
&gt; going to act differently should have a different name.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would guess teh damage is based on our level being 8 levels lower<br/>
than the necro using it.  Rememeber, since we got spells at 9th, our<br/>
effective level in casting (and for mana) is 8 levels lower.  My VE<br/>
is getting better at about 1HP / 2 levels I think.<br/>
