<b>Subject:</b> harm touch, and finally quests! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080233743">as far as harm touch is concerned, i rarely have problems with it. this is<br/>
perhaps because of having spent (literally *faint*) days in realtime<br/>
determining how to use it most effectively.. and i think i&#39;ve pieced<br/>
together most of how it works. i&#39;ve posted to this mailing list about that<br/>
before, have numerous archived posts on eqss, and submitted it to the<br/>
soerbaird&#39;s sk site for more permanent viewing :) (if ya really want i can<br/>
find their web addy and stick it on another email). as far as improving it<br/>
is concerned, go read the current HT petition on eqss, i think it is very<br/>
clear and reasonable (unlike some sk petitions i have seen in the past) and<br/>
worth signing.<br/>
<br/>
quests! am i the only one who realizes that the lady shae quest in fp for<br/>
shadow knights is STILL broken? it has NEVER worked. lady shae herself has<br/>
been actively altered a few times (she once had enchanter spells, which were<br/>
removed after SOMEBODY started a bunch of charmed-newbie trains thru west<br/>
freeport *nervously raises hand*) but the quest stays broken. it is<br/>
remarkably frustrating. and, after finally solving the groflah quest (i<br/>
think i may well have been the first to figure that thing out) i got a whole<br/>
rat fur cap for my troubles. and considering an sk has to be at least lvl 30<br/>
(invis is REQUIRED to get to groflah), thats pretty sad. some decent prizes<br/>
for our quests in freeport would be really welcome :) and i think some<br/>
medium size equipment (DE can wear medium too, eh?) for sk would be fine.<br/>
there are already several sk items (grobb cleaver, helm of hukulk) that<br/>
humans just can&#39;t use. i think it would be baseless for the large races to<br/>
complain if human sk were given something that they could not use :) at this<br/>
point i could go into the ring of the dead -&gt; reaper of the dead<br/>
controversy, but i choose not to, ONLY ON THE BASIS THAT the ring of the<br/>
dead can still be obtained, SOMEHOW. (i hope)<br/>
<br/>
as far as faction.. i am a human sk, and i am now considered kindly by the<br/>
lodge of the dead. recently it seems the default human sk faction with the<br/>
lodge was either lowered, or the people who have trouble spent too much time<br/>
hunting in befallen (which i have heard has a peripheral effect on lodge of<br/>
the dead fac). in any event, the dark elf necros now consider me better than<br/>
they consider most dark elves! which makes me happy :) my big faction gripe<br/>
is that i have no way of ever getting into grobb or oggok tho! i&#39;m an sk,<br/>
i&#39;m on their side.. they just see a hummie and want to barsh me i guess.<br/>
even the troll sk are threatening to me (at least they&#39;re not completely<br/>
KoS, that way i have somewhat of a chance of surviving an accidental lynuga<br/>
encounter..)<br/>
<br/>
this concludes today&#39;s really long and rambling letter from Beld. :)<br/>
