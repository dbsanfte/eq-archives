<br/>
I am Dravith Vandre&#39;i, a dark elven shadow knight on the Fennin Ro server.<br/>
I&#39;m currently 34th level. I&#39;m in a crested helm (steel plate look), charred<br/>
bp (black plate look), steel greaves (soon to be rubicite if they would ever<br/>
fix cazic), charred boots (black plate look), steel arms and bracers, and<br/>
snakeskin gloves (looks purple). And I use a Dark Reaver. This should give<br/>
you an idea of what I look like. I&#39;m in the Sol A/B area a lot trying to get<br/>
charred gauntlets to round out my black/steel look (it&#39;s the only charred<br/>
piece I don&#39;t have) and go to B for exp.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just a generally nice guy (especially to lower level SKs). I didn&#39;t play<br/>
an SK to be &quot;evil,&quot; I just liked the powers and abilities of the class. Plus<br/>
I like (no, love) being a dark elf, all my characters are inkies. I don&#39;t<br/>
usually roleplay that much, I just like to have a good time, and I<br/>
oftentimes do with my SK. This class really fit me more than any other I&#39;ve<br/>
tried, and I have a hard time playing anything else. I was young once, like<br/>
you, and I asked all the same questions you did. Beld (Grant V) was kind<br/>
enough to post some very detailed strategies and outlooks that I still use<br/>
to this day. If you only get one thing off this list, make sure it&#39;s Beld&#39;s<br/>
advice. Listen to him.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, don&#39;t really have much to say. Being an SK is and always<br/>
will be fun to me, and I hope it will be for you as well.<br/>
