&gt; So what do you all think? Are larger races more powerful SK&#39;s? Both PVE and<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think large races make better tanks in general, due to the higher<br/>
str and more hp&#39;s.  The Troll makes an ideal shadowknight because of <br/>
the regeneration and the lack of healing.  Dark elves make better<br/>
casters,<br/>
and lack in the physical aspects.  Oh, and one of the biggest concerns,<br/>
the large races bash without a shield.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think Erudite Paladins suffer a similar fate when compared to<br/>
a dwarf?  Maybe not because there is no bash/slam argument, but it<br/>
still seems they are at a disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
Myself, I carry both a 2H and a 1H/Shield and swap them via the<br/>
hotkeys when I need to fight a healer (ala Cazic)<br/>
