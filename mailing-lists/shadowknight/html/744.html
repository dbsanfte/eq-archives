<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418028925">You are correct, the damage shields were far too powerful if put on a big SK<br/>
(ogre/troll).  Your comments about Shadow Step are interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Lifetap/spike/draw would be used near the end of a melee in a group -- you<br/>
could use it as a quick heal to minimize downtime.<br/>
<br/>
And personally, it has always been my idea that an SK feeds off the life<br/>
force of the weak, so after a fight walking around and sucking the life out<br/>
of gnolls and orcs sounds very in character...<br/>
