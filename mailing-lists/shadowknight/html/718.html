<b>Subject:</b> My Main concern <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-964486111">I think it is fantastic that at high lvl (39+) 3 dots, heart flutter<br/>
engulfing darkness and Heat blood, stack up for 410 dmg. Not too bad at all.<br/>
The main problem is with engulfing darkness. I may as well not have it<br/>
memorised since it is overriden but root ( all casters and paladins) snare<br/>
(rangers and druids), ensnare ( those stupid ranger swords) and engulfing<br/>
darkness itself (a rogues SBD). so when I eliminate all the classes that<br/>
would interfere with one of my main spells, I am left to solo. God only<br/>
knows why snare, a lvl 1 spell, overrides one of my main lvl 22 spells. It&#39;s<br/>
also a Necro lvl 8 or 12 spell I think.<br/>
Something has to be done to make this more effective again.<br/>
- We can make it override the other spells, and let them get the crappy does<br/>
not hold message. I kinda like that one 8) given ther relative few SK&#39;s<br/>
around this wouldn&#39;t happen to often, but no doubt the druid would start<br/>
whining about nerfing again.<br/>
- We can change the whole line to some other line of spells. I don&#39;t like<br/>
this since I think many SK&#39;s love their darkness spells due to their dual<br/>
purpose (dmg and slowing)<br/>
- We can make it stack with the other spells such as snare and root. I don;t<br/>
mind this one either but I can&#39;t see this one being impolemented.<br/>
<br/>
What are everyone else&#39;s thought on this problem?<br/>
