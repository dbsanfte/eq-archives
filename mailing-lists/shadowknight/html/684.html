<b>Subject:</b> New Spells Apparently Being Implemented <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700726489">Lately I hit the Necro/SK guild in Neriak (after the patch, to check spells<br/>
even tho no changes to SK spells were listed in the update).<br/>
I noticed that we SKs can now &quot;use&quot; (although we can&#39;t, since they require a<br/>
level of &quot;61&quot;) at least the following three spells.<br/>
<br/>
1) Infectious Cloud (now this could be useful, at least compated to what<br/>
we&#39;ve got)<br/>
2) Spirit Armor (my mouth was open when I saw this one, we might actually be<br/>
getting a nice buff)<br/>
3) Augment Death (this puzzles me, a level 34 necro pet buffing spell, while<br/>
I suppose it would be useful, I was actually hoping they&#39;d do away with the<br/>
pets and give us something else, ah well this could make the pet more<br/>
worthwhile...)<br/>
<br/>
I talked to a GM about why they required level 61, and was told that any<br/>
spell requiring that level meant it was currently being implemented. Whoo<br/>
hoo, I&#39;m excited, at least about Spirit Armor...</div>
