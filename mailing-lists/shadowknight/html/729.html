&gt; Actually, come to think of it, I like the damage shield idea even better<br/>
&gt; than the lifetap series. Ok, so healing and any type of downtime reduction<br/>
&gt; is right out, I can live with that (I got used to it, played a mostly-solo<br/>
&gt; warrior to 31). But Banshee Aura (et. al) would be wonderful! Rangers get<br/>
&gt; thorns, dangit, let me chill some kobolds to the bone! It&#39;s also more damage<br/>
&gt; we can put out, HENCE Beld wouldn&#39;t mind it. Go damage shields go! Good<br/>
&gt; thinking, man!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

39th, but they replaced it with shieldskin, which disappointed me<br/>
greatly.<br/>

&gt; others are, well... crap. (sorry Brian) Cancel Magic, ok for those dots that<br/>
&gt; just won&#39;t come off. Shadow Vortex, gimme a break, no one EVER uses that<br/>
&gt; spell. Pet spell, shah right. Shield Skin, heh what a joke, absorb one hit<br/>
&gt; for a ton of mana AND reagents, no thanks my 136 Agi will do a better job<br/>
&gt; for free. And the list goes on...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The 30th level spells do have more drool factor than the 39th, but<br/>
as I haven&#39;t had a chance to see their uses yet, I might be wrong. <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that subtle effects on spells make or break a fight.<br/>
How many times have you died within feet of the zone?  Shieldskin<br/>
would have saved you there.  Also Resist Cold might help when fighting<br/>
wizards who use AE frost spells.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the damage and ticks for Heart Flutter?  Or the <br/>
-Str -AC effect that it has?<br/>
<br/>
And in teh last patch they said Heart Flutter works better now,<br/>
has anyone tried it to see the difference?<br/>
