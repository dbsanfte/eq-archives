<div id="ygrps-yiv-514420271">HP regen jewelry: there was a rumor that Bloodstone Rings helped life<br/>
regen. Since then I have come across a few, and when you look at its<br/>
properties, it says nothing about magic. I even tried wearing it and<br/>
watching my life, and it regen&#39;d normally. Either this was a scam<br/>
someone came up with to rip off newbies, or there is a different kind<br/>
of Bloodstone Ring out there.<br/>
<br/>
Armor: Get Banded. You can buy Banded from a PC way cheaper than you<br/>
can chain from a NPC. Plus banded has the same AC, but is lighter and<br/>
it looks the same.<br/>
<br/>
Those are all the answers I have for now.<br/>
