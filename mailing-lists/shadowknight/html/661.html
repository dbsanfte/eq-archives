<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866303023">Yea Dark Reaver is 2handed.  Those swords can do some nice damage, but I&#39;m <br/>
still at a toss up point.  Right now I&#39;m using the Stilletto Bloodclaw which <br/>
is MUCH faster.  And at level 22, with Vampiric Embrace, I have that and the <br/>
BloodClaw effect going off a lot.  Hence the trade off.  If I go for just <br/>
staight Damage, I high with my 2hsword for about 47max, so I get double <br/>
attacks of 40 and 42 quite commonly.  But at the same time, when you miss, <br/>
it&#39;s a long recycle time.<br/>
