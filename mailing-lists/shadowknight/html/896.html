<div id="ygrps-yiv-835777398">Well, I for one was not on this last weekend, so I have <br/>
no questions or comments. My Father-in-Law flew in for a <br/>
week.  Was only ablt to play for a VERY short time.<br/>
<br/>
I have also put Cronik on hold for a bit to level a <br/>
newly created Druid. Since Monday I have been able to <br/>
make 2 bubs into 4th.<br/>
I made the Druid for when I get tired of the zones <br/>
Cronik fights in. So far Misty Thicket is pretty kewl, <br/>
and I can&#39;t wait for Qeynos Hills and the Karanas.<br/>
I should make 5th or even 6th by the end of the night. :)<br/>
Depends on how good the hunting is and how much havok <br/>
the kiddies cause. Heh.<br/>
<br/>
What level are you Beld? What server are you on?<br/>
I have been wanting to ask you that for quite a while.<br/>
You may have posted it, but I missed it. :)<br/>
