<div id="ygrps-yiv-583839651">Some more food for thought:<br/>
<br/>
SK pets are actually useful for distracting an enemy while you cast spells<br/>
at it.  BUT, this assumes you&#39;re soloing and thus not tanking for some real<br/>
spellcasters.<br/>
<br/>
In a party situation we go after yellows as much as possible, and most<br/>
yellows destroy my pet in three or four swings, making the pet useless.<br/>
However, in a solo situation I would go after blues and whites mostly, and<br/>
then the pet might actually make a difference and be good.<br/>
<br/>
The SK is probably a good solo class for those reasons, and as such isn&#39;t<br/>
as big a pile as I like to think :-) however I do believe that as a member<br/>
of a party it&#39;s very difficult for the SK to contribute meaningfully.<br/>
<br/>
The big problem that makes an SK difficult to solo is the lack of healing,<br/>
not even life tap.  I think that this would actually make role play really<br/>
nice -- you&#39;re weak, so you wander the lands sucking the life from weaker<br/>
creatures to repair your wounds.  Very Elric.<br/>
<br/>
So it boils down to this: the SK is a reasonable solo class, since you&#39;re<br/>
very self sufficient except for healing (and bandage wounds is _useless_).<br/>
So you waste a lot of time just sitting around healing.  As a party member,<br/>
the SK is tantamount to useless.<br/>
<br/>
Most people that are high on the SK class think of it in terms of soloing<br/>
at high levels, and possibly a 50th level SK may be the baddest mofo in<br/>
Norrath, but I don&#39;t play this game to solo.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should just be a bard and quit whining. :-)<br/>
