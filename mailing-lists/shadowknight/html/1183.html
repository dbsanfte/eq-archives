<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382435197">Highpass Faction for evil races.... are TSKs Kos in HPH?  &lt;~~~don&#39;t you just<br/>
love this game?<br/>
<br/>
Cronik is currently bound in HPH on the Kith side.  I have attacked maybe 20<br/>
Orcs there.  Do you know how many kills it takes to enter HPH and not be KoS<br/>
if I am already?  What about the HP Residents and wandering Guards?<br/>
Where doe the Princess quest start?  Does it have anything to do mayhaps<br/>
with the Thex Dagger like the Lottery ticket quest is rumored to?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Get me started and look out!<br/>
