<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246670769">from what i gather, shadow vortex steals AC from the target and gives to<br/>
you. unsure on how much is transfered tho..<br/>
<br/>
as for tactics, try these:<br/>
do not RELY on HT to save you, but there are ways to make it more effective.<br/>
i use it in 3 main ways: to speed up the death of a relatively low level<br/>
thing in a fight with multiple monsters, to finish off something nasty that<br/>
is trying to get away, or as a massive taunt to pull a monster off a dying<br/>
party member. using it to save yourself is generally a panic reaction, and<br/>
rarely works as you want it to.. to get the most out of harm touch, i&#39;ve<br/>
found that it works best if you hit the opponent from BEHIND, especially<br/>
while they are fleeing or under the effect of a fear spell. in this way, HT<br/>
is more like a melee attack than a magical attack. in this way i have layed<br/>
full damage on spellcasting npcs that are 5 or more levels higher than me,<br/>
usually severely screwing them over :) so no complaints that HT never works,<br/>
ya hear!<br/>
<br/>
if you have to fight solo, always keep one of your darkness spells ready (if<br/>
you are lvl 15 yet), and always have your pet summoned, even tho it may seem<br/>
worthless. the trick is to use it for the occasional extra hits (which add<br/>
up) rather than as a tank for you. the pet also tends to give you a few<br/>
seconds of fleeing time if the battle goes badly. make sure it is under the<br/>
effects of a darkness spell (so he runs slow) and cast fear on it to make it<br/>
turn around and run. this will give you the chance to hit it in the back for<br/>
a while without retaliation. just be sure to NOT use this tactic in a<br/>
cramped dungeon unless you are VERY sure you know where the npc will flee<br/>
and that he doesnt have friends there :) you can also use the darkness spell<br/>
and archery to kite, but this is a rather gimpy and unreliable version of<br/>
kiting, and i dont reccomend it. (if ye want to kite, yer better off being a<br/>
druid anyway). if you use a shield and are fighting a spellcasting npc, dont<br/>
just bash constantly! wait until you see them start casting, THEN bash. if<br/>
it hits, you are guaranteed to break their concentration, unless they are so<br/>
high above you in levels that you are toast anyway ;)<br/>
<br/>
because of your high downtime between fights, i personally like to group<br/>
whenever possible. and yes, SK DO have something to offer to groups. our<br/>
main role in group combat is, strangely, as a martyr tank: we are masters of<br/>
pissing off mobs and getting them off of other group members. between taunt,<br/>
disease cloud (they REALLY hate that one for some reason), fear, DOTs (which<br/>
the mobs ALSO really hate), and the ability to use big, damage-hogging<br/>
weapons, we are excellent at convincing the monster to ignore the wizard and<br/>
come after us instead. as i said before, HT also makes a great megataunt in<br/>
an emergency, as only several hundred points of instant DD can do. you just<br/>
have to remember 2 things about this strategy: ALWAYS group with a cleric,<br/>
or all that taunting is gonna get you killed real quick, and remember to<br/>
inform your nukers NOT to over exert themselves. if the spellcasters are<br/>
casting nuke after nuke without pause, they will quickly outdamage you and<br/>
you wont be able to taunt the monster back. so long as the spellcasters keep<br/>
their casting in moderation, you will be able to fend off the monster and<br/>
keep the caster alive.<br/>
<br/>
thats about all i got for now, lemme know if you need any more specific info ;)<br/>
