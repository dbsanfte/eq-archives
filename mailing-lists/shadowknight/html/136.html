<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587793739">I think a couple of my problems were that I wasn&#39;t role-playing an SK -- I<br/>
chose SK because it was a cool class, not because I wanted to necessarily<br/>
be evil.  Being a human was a compromise for me since that meant I wasn&#39;t<br/>
KoS in as many areas as, say, a troll SK (which must be one lonely dude).<br/>
<br/>
You have some good points -- a 10th level is nothing in the game, so I may<br/>
not have given the SK a fair chance.  The problem is that I think part of<br/>
the game his horked when it comes to XP and level increases.  Since I level<br/>
more slowly than my other party members, I&#39;m always behind on levels.  This<br/>
is amplified by the fact that higher level party members get more XP!  So<br/>
eventually I&#39;m stuck switching to a lower level party or just never getting<br/>
experience -- we started out equally, and they are at 12th level and I&#39;m at<br/>
10th level (about a 20% difference in XP, even though we&#39;ve been partied<br/>
the whole time).<br/>
<br/>
The other factor that I alluded to is that I&#39;m basically a nuisance to our<br/>
three person party, barring the role-playing aspects.  I&#39;m not an effective<br/>
spell caster, I can&#39;t heal, they constantly have to worry about me being<br/>
KoS, and I don&#39;t have bind, gate, or invis.  I&#39;m a worse tank than the<br/>
necro&#39;s pet, and this isn&#39;t a skill thing -- I&#39;m maxed on 1HS and 2HS, have<br/>
good STR and STA, and wield a Mino Axe.  So I can dish out damage, but the<br/>
necro&#39;s pet misses less, is expendable, doesn&#39;t get diseased, doesn&#39;t need<br/>
to be healed, and does as much damage as me.<br/>
<br/>
So that leaves HT as my only real saving grace, but the wizard in the party<br/>
can dish out 4x what my HT does in one battle.<br/>
<br/>
Which means that I&#39;m effective at preventing the spell casters from being<br/>
attacked, but in terms of any positive contributions to a battle (other<br/>
than as a human shield), I really don&#39;t have much.  I do some token melee<br/>
damage, and that&#39;s it.<br/>

&gt;maybe you should have tried a different SK...maybe a troll for pure<br/>
&gt;power...or a Dark Elf for the casting abilities.  I also don&#39;t doubt that<br/>
&gt;eventually SK&#39;s will be powered up a little.  You played a human...a<br/>
&gt;little stronger but limited magically.  Maybe if you tried a different<br/>
&gt;race you might have found more satisfaction.  I can&#39;t express how much I<br/>
&gt;love being a DE SK.  Not only for the evil nature I get to play...but also<br/>
&gt;the fact that when I get spells...i will get alot...not to mention that<br/>
&gt;your training and weapon skills have alot to do with how well your<br/>
&gt;character does.  Just because the SK isn&#39;t the most powerfull<br/>
&gt;class...doesn&#39;t mean its a bad class.  You played one race up to<br/>
&gt;10....thats hardly anywhere in the world.  <br/>
