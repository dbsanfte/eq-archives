<div id="ygrps-yiv-193724154">Granted the Drain spells we will be getting are<br/>
nothing Norrath-shattering.<br/>
But still..i can see myself using a 45 Lifedraw WAY<br/>
more often than i use Voice Graft.<br/>
<br/>
Other than giving us another DOT (which they arent<br/>
going to do) there wasnt much else they could give us<br/>
from the Necro spell book.<br/>
this is as good as it is gonna get.<br/>
<br/>
I do not mourn the loss of any of these spells.<br/>
I would rather have a worthless Lifedraw spell any day<br/>
than something so obviously stupid as Voice Graft.<br/>
<br/>
Its only fun was talking thru NPCs and getting other<br/>
players to give the NPC money. Now that we cant do<br/>
that..its usefulness is done.<br/>

&gt; These spells are very bad mana wise, and can verily<br/>

&gt; way more hp and far less mana) I thought general<br/>
&gt; consensus on the list was<br/>
&gt; not for a lifetap change. When Brian asked, I<br/>
&gt; thought this was the general<br/>
&gt; consensus. I imagine all 25+ SK know these spells<br/>
&gt; will not help the class at<br/>
&gt; all. Obviously they have not listened to the players<br/>
&gt; once again, or perhaps<br/>
&gt; I missed a message. The spells will be as useless as<br/>
&gt; the ones they took<br/>
&gt; away.  I doubt even the teen level SK will be helped<br/>
&gt; by this, I know the 20+<br/>
&gt; will not.<br/>
