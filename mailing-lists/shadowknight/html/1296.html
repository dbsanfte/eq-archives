<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054100975">&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
IMO, dex is worthless for a SK less ya got some sorta procing weapon...Go AC<br/>
first, then STR, then agility..<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Personally, Dex to me is not worthless. Anything that allows me to strike<br/>
even one more time each minute is worth it. Especially with Double Attack.<br/>
But that is symantics and I do not want a &quot;word war&quot; over it. :-)<br/>
I agree that raw AC comes first. Strength has more impact after 20. Agility<br/>
is up in the air for me. Not quite sure what effect it has.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What armor under Darkforge and Planes armor is best for an SK? I am working<br/>
on getting some bronze armor, and not blackened because of the lower AC.<br/>
What is better than bronze and what would I expect to pay for it? Or what<br/>
MoB/level/zone is it in.<br/>
I am ignorant as to &quot;good&quot; items as I normally wander Norrath with my /ooc,<br/>
/auction, /shouts turned off. It is quite peaceful like this, no punk<br/>
kiddies acting tough and cursing each other out across the zone. But I<br/>
digress.<br/>
<br/>
My druid just hit 26 and I am looking into getting equipment for my SK. All<br/>
I need is to be pointed in the right direction. Any and all help is<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
