<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912386183">Just a couple of questions.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Has anyone been able to find Lord Grimrot?  You get this quest to take a dwarf skull to him from the guild in Qeynos.  I&#39;ve heard he spawns if you kill all the skeletons in that spot south of the bridge in south karana, but there has to be an easier way.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Does anyone know for sure whether it helps to keep casting siphon strength on a single target?  I get the message saying the target weakens every time I cast it, but I have heard it works only once.<br/>
