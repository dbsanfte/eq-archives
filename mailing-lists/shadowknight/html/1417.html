<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610898768">Does anyone know of a good place for a 45 SK to hunt?  I just can&#39;t <br/>
seem to find anywhere that is really intersting (or find a good grp <br/>
there).  I tried Karnor&#39;s recently but that place is a mess (and you <br/>
get bad Venril Sathir (sp) faction (the outpost in OT))  so that was <br/>
no good.  Many of the higher levels are either overcrowded or there&#39;s <br/>
just no-one there.  I solo a lot so I was wondering if anyone knew of <br/>
anywhere good.  my Velious faction is with the giants (Ally, Warm and <br/>
dumbarse Tormax still scowels, which would be nice to get some help <br/>
w/).  I dunno, any ideas?  Have all my DF armor etc, so there a very <br/>
few quests to do.  <br/>
