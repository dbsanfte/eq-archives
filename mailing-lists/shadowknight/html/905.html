<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056986760">I was just curious what weapon/s other high level SK&#39;s like to use. I&#39;ve<br/>
found that the DR is my weapon of choice, but I do switch to the FleshRipper<br/>
when I&#39;m not to concerned about the AE getting me killed (A DD spell would<br/>
have made this weapon so much nicer). Also lately I&#39;ve found myself using a<br/>
Cryt. Sword and MM shield combo (just looks cool, with all the black and<br/>
silver plate). Any of you find any other weapons you like using (Thulian<br/>
claw, etc??)..<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy...</div>
