<div id="ygrps-yiv-847362700">OK, I was browsing some things last night and noticed I had Dodge available<br/>
to me.  I went to the combat/socail/skills areas and did not find it listed.<br/>
Is this an automatic thing that gets better overtime, without me hitting a<br/>
button like bash?  I trained one point in it so it said you have learned<br/>
Dodge.<br/>
