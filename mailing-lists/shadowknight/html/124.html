<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113718305"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;2.	Have 1 day where everyone gets on and /feedbacks them either the<br/>
&gt;same statement or a statement containing identical issues.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LISTEN TO ME.  This won&#39;t help your cause any.  Sign a petition, do<br/>
something, but actively attempting to annoy/&quot;raise attention&quot; from the GMs<br/>
rarely works, if anything it raises animosity.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve suffered through this myself, where someone sets up a Web site to get<br/>
some issue addressed with our games.  There&#39;s a form letter, a space to<br/>
fill in your e-mail, and then a &quot;click here to send this e-mail&quot; button.<br/>
<br/>
What happens is we get flooded with e-mail for about three days.  But after<br/>
the first half dozen or so, the others are deleted because they&#39;re easy to<br/>
identify.<br/>
<br/>
So we do a mass /feedback, and the ones after the first half dozen will be<br/>
discarded, unread.  Hell, anything to do with SKs likely will be discarded<br/>
unread on the assumption it&#39;s something to do with the mass feedback.<br/>
