<div id="ygrps-yiv-421220975"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If anyone out there is getting this, what is a GOOD area for a 20th lvl DE<br/>
 </span></blockquote>SK to go and hunt?  I have been hunting in HPH and getting good xps, but<br/>
wondering where to go next.  Also, has anyone *ever* gotten to the point<br/>
where they were not KOS to the HP guards?<br/>
<br/>
Good place for a level 20 is doing aviak guards in lakerathe. They&#39;ll do you<br/>
good all the way to 24. And no, I&#39;ve always been KOS in HPH. *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As an additional aside, I was wondering what the general consensus was on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>costs for the following items:  Silvery-plated Bracer, Blackened Iron Armor<br/>
(any piece or general guideline, like 5plat per AC or what?), BIBS, and Dark<br/>
Reaver?<br/>
<br/>
Silvery bracers are good, but under NO circumstances should you wear<br/>
blackened iron. That has to be the most overrated armor in Norrath. Oh sure<br/>
it may look good, but&#39;s the AC of chain and the weight of bronze. The BIBS<br/>
is good and should get you through your 20s, pick up your Reaver (and be<br/>
saving for one now) right as you hit 30 or thereabouts.<br/>
