<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816933983">Actually the first character I chose, and my main<br/>
character is a High Elf Pally who likes to pick on<br/>
DE&#39;s...or at least likes to annoy them with my<br/>
niceness...esp SKs.  I&#39;ve gotten anything from<br/>
growls...annoyance..to SKs actaully breaking down and<br/>
being nice to me. Don&#39;t growl at me now....I think I&#39;m<br/>
going to like my Sk now after I start choosing her r-p<br/>
character.<br/>
<br/>
I know my SK will be nice to other DE&#39;s..just not sure<br/>
how mean I can roll-play msyelf to other races...I<br/>
think I like the stuck up bit over the &#39;piss on<br/>
corpse&#39;..but thats just me ;)  I do think I like that<br/>
demand that they shout praises to our god before we<br/>
locate the corpse! :)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have class to get to now..<br/>
<br/>
Thank you & Take care fellow Sks :)<br/>

&gt; We are the &quot;most evil&quot; of them all.  Of course, this<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my realm, I&#39;m taken as a ahole because I usually<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t help newbies who are not of my god and/or<br/>
&gt; class.  Seeing as we are the supreme Class, we<br/>
&gt; should be aloff and not caring.  And talk that way. <br/>
&gt; Convert or die.  <br/>
&gt; *<br/>
&gt; Watch a good race die, then ( /em urinates on<br/>
&gt; corpse) when he/she returns for it.  If they whine,<br/>
&gt; tell them they are not worthy of your help.<br/>
&gt; *<br/>
&gt; You can help them, but be true to our god in doing<br/>
&gt; so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Before you do a locate corpse, have them shout out<br/>
&gt; praises to your god.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While this is all fun, it sux when you need help. <br/>
&gt; So keep close to your brothers and sisters.  <br/>
