<div id="ygrps-yiv-438291724">Okay, here&#39;s a question for you folks.  What if Shadow Step and Voice Graft were replaced with some kind of lifetap spells?  Would<br/>
this be grossly unbalancing or hurt the class?<br/>
<br/>
If we tune the SK we can&#39;t really ADD new spells, since this would give them more spells than the other hybrids at each rank.<br/>
