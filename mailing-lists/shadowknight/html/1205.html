<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-457337491">Sorry for the mass email. Everyone is BCCed, so please do not reply to all.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I recieved and email virus with the subject of  &quot;Check This.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I opened it without thinking first, so if you do get this email, DELETE it<br/>
IMMEDIATELY.<br/>
<br/>
My virus scanner did not pick it up, and I do not know if anything was<br/>
actually sent out, but I am covering my bases.<br/>
<br/>
It is a mass-email virus and will send to everyone in your addressbook with<br/>
you as the sender.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the hassle.<br/>
<br/>
Rich.</div>
