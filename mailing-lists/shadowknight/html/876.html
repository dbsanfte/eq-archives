What about a lifetap effect?  Or maybe some DD/DOT effect?<br/>
On a side note, if the engine permits it, an aura of darkness<br/>
would be the coolest thing in the game, I&#39;m envious of the cool<br/>
visuals on Soulfire, but an aura of darkness would be even cooler.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also like to see this quest be fairly involved, which would be<br/>
hard to do for both Humans and DEs.  And to the SKs out there,<br/>
please don&#39;t post a walkthrough like what happened with Soulfire.<br/>
That&#39;s just lame.<br/>

Whatever happens, this weapon needs to look cool (well perhaps not cool, but<br/>
different =))<br/>
And it needs an effect like the ones mentioned above.<br/>
Also it won&#39;t be much of an anti-ghoulbane if it doesn&#39;t have at least the<br/>
same damage =)<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts....<br/>
