<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567078268"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; did you actually use feign before the patch?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; you couldn&#39;t possibly have - and believe that this new fd system is &quot;more&quot;<br/>
&gt; predictable...or even predictable at all (compared to the previous<br/>
 </span></blockquote>system).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i for one KNOW how fd worked before (the verant posted is complete bs, a<br/>
&gt; blatant lie) and i know how it works now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course I used FD before the patch. I pull better than most monks, and I&#39;m<br/>
just an SK. I was trained by a monk (THE premiere monk on Fennin) and I know<br/>
how to feign, believe me. My point was not whether the new FD was better or<br/>
worse, I refuse to go down that road. I&#39;m telling you how it is NOW, after<br/>
the fact. You can use that information or you can bitch and moan. I was<br/>
trying to give you some advice on how the new FD is best used, even in its<br/>
&quot;nerfed&quot; state, and you insult me. I guess I&#39;ll just go back to lurking on<br/>
the list, sorry to post.<br/>
