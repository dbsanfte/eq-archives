&gt; ok xillith, this is important, since you said that the bayle list quest<br/>
&gt; seemed to be broken on your side :) now, were you trying to return the bayle<br/>
&gt; list to the npc in QEYNOS, or the npc in FREEPORT? :) i intend to turn the<br/>
&gt; list in to the freeport npc, but since you said it was broken and i dont<br/>
&gt; know which, i&#39;m too scared to try! hehe.. it took too much time and too much<br/>
&gt; luck to get as far as i am now to throw it away on a roadblock..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is broken for the Freeport (Dismal Rage) quest.  I believe there<br/>
is a related quest in Qeynos, but I don&#39;t know much about it, and<br/>
my bloodsaber faction needs some work.<br/>
