<div id="ygrps-yiv-45771149">Wow, Beld, excellent response, this is exactly what I was looking for. The<br/>
great thing is I&#39;m on Fennin Ro too. I&#39;ll be sure to ask you some things in<br/>
game now that I know you&#39;re there. =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, man.<br/>

PS: Also, any character descriptions I&#39;d love to hear. Tell me about your<br/>
race, level, equipment, weapon, favorite spells, etc. I just wanna hear<br/>
about other SKs, what they&#39;re wearing, how they&#39;re living... Thanks.<br/>
