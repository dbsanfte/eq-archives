&gt; The only thing I can think of that would make the small race SK more<br/>

&gt; medium small only.<br/>

&gt; Item that large races cannot wear, that are SK only, do I see the<br/>

have regen so they don&#39;t need it as much.  As it stands, it&#39;s hard to<br/>
run out of mana, even when constantly fighting.<br/>
