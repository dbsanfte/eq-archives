<div id="ygrps-yiv-210573088">As a quick note on the BP at least.. I really don&#39;t buy the stats for it, I<br/>
can&#39;t see Verant giving us two pieces with nearly identical bonuses (Sta and<br/>
MR in this case), I really hope this is not the case.<br/>
<br/>
Personally with the stats as they stand now, I&#39;m sticking with my Charred BP<br/>
(16AC, +3STR, +6 STA), at least until I can get a Dark Flame BP.<br/>
<br/>
I know they mentioned that this armor is obviously not the best armor we can<br/>
get (Umbral for now). I feel for what is required to obtain it though, we<br/>
should at least have decent stats (I still like the stats on the bracers,<br/>
just not the red color). The majority of components needed can not be<br/>
obtained without a well balanced full 30+ group (I would go so far as to say<br/>
high 30&#39;s). This reward should be equal to the effort and in this case I<br/>
don&#39;t feel it is.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy..<br/>

I don&#39;t understand why the chain based armor of the rangers has a <br/>
higher AC than our darkforge armor, and arguably better statistics.<br/>
All of the ranger armor I&#39;ve seen has excellent bonuses to pertinent<br/>
stats.  Example.<br/>
<br/>
Ivy etched tunic (ranger):  19AC +3Str +3Wis +30HP<br/>
Darkforge breastplate (sk):  18AC +10Sta +3Mr<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know exactly how stamina works, but I know that the +6 stamina<br/>
on my charred bp equates to about 13HP for me at level 33.<br/>
<br/>
The leggings...<br/>
Lambent greaves (bard):  13AC +1Cha +5Agi weight 4.0<br/>
Darkforge greaves(sk):  11AC +9Sta +3Mr weight 7<br/>
Ivy Etched greaves(rng): 12AC +5Agi +5Fire +5Cold<br/>
<br/>
Bard:  2 AC more and weighs 3lbs less.  Also, the Agi bonus will give <br/>
another point or two of ac.<br/>
<br/>
Ranger:  1 more AC<br/>
<br/>
I hear they are upping the crusader spawns, which is good, but <br/>
really why do the rangers have higher ac on their chain armor? It<br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
