&gt;Subject: [shadowknight] Najena<br/>
&gt;Date: Tue, 02 Nov 1999 14:09:51 -0700<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Something just occured to me about Najena.  One of the NPCs that makes the<br/>
&gt;SK only armor is in Najena, right?  While this may not be a big deal now,<br/>
&gt;and I may already have messed this faction to Thule and back anyway, it<br/>
&gt;makes me edgy. I have only been in there a few times, and killed 1 Ogre <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;wandered near the Magician and her 2 Earth Elemental pets.  I noticed a<br/>
&gt;Najena Residents -Faction adjusment. After that, My group attacked the<br/>
&gt;Magician, and I became a stain on the floor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am curious to know for those of you who battle there often, what faction<br/>
&gt;adjustments you may have seen since they implemented Darkforge Armor. It<br/>
&gt;will suck to destroy my faction with the only NPC that makes those pieces <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;the armor that only I can wear.  Granted, what you destroyed, you can fix<br/>
&gt;(hopefully), but that in and of itself can take a lifetime. Or is there no<br/>
&gt;faction adjustment with this NPC?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, what is the name of this NPC in Najena, and where does he spawn?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I ask these questions as my guild is planning to raid Najena and get some<br/>
&gt;nifty stuff. Am I about to become screwed when all is said and done?<br/>
&gt;Any and all information on this is helpful and wanted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks.<br/>
