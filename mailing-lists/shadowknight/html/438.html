<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420741828">I&#39;m a Tier&#39;Dal Shadow Knight.  I&#39;ve traveled around a bit, down to<br/>
ogguk and grobb.  When I try to talk to the Shadow Knight guild masters<br/>
down there they tell me they won&#39;t deal with Dark Elves.  I was a<br/>
little disappointed over this.  I&#39;ve also tried to trigger some of the<br/>
quests down in those towns without any success.  Does anyone know if<br/>
it&#39;s possible to get trained by a Troll or Ogre Shadow Knight if you&#39;re<br/>
a Dark Elf?  I assume it&#39;s just that they&#39;re not smart enough to<br/>
instruct a Tier&#39;Dal ;)  Has anyone managed to make a quest work in<br/>
these cities?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
