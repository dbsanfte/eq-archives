<div id="ygrps-yiv-792947615">I fully admit, and am glad for it, that SKs will indeed be a class to<br/>
be reckoned with. <br/>
<br/>
However i must stick with my previous comments on HT. Sure if a few SKs<br/>
got together and HT&#39;d a Griffon to death quick and easy, they would get<br/>
good exp. But that would be it for another hour and a half. If thats<br/>
what they want to do with their HT instead of keeping it for an<br/>
emergency where HT is the only thing that&#39;ll save them, thats up to the<br/>
individuals involved. Its not like they&#39;ll be able to walk around and<br/>
HT everything to death right after that.<br/>
<br/>
And as for LoH getting interrupted, i have heard this about HT,<br/>
although its never happened to me. <br/>
I would like to hear from any SK on this.<br/>
If this is true, then we&#39;re back to square one. LoH 1000 healing, HT<br/>
500dmg, but resisted by the creatures you would actually use it<br/>
against.<br/>
<br/>
And we all know that a toning down of LoH just isn&#39;t going to happen.<br/>
We could campaign the rest of our lives and it&#39;ll never even be<br/>
considered. <br/>
So what&#39;s left? <br/>
Tweak HT. <br/>
HT is only powerful WHEN it works. Which seems to be less and less as<br/>
we gain higher levels and fight bigger creatures.<br/>
<br/>
And i still feel that it should work every time.<br/>
<br/>
But aside from our differences of opinion, i would like to hear what<br/>
you think would be a good way to get the Dev team&#39;s attention with our<br/>
various concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Talking about these topics on message boards and mailing lists is OK,<br/>
but this wont accomplish anything as far as the game is concerned.<br/>
Lets do that pro-active thing i hear so much about.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for responding,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; i completely agree, i would personally like to sit<br/>
&gt; down with the game<br/>
&gt; balance programmers and get THEIR explainations of<br/>
&gt; how paladins and SK are<br/>
&gt; evenly matched. however, i think i can understand a<br/>
&gt; few possible reasons why<br/>
&gt; things are as they are:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ok, so at lvl 9 a paladin could probably beat up a<br/>
&gt; lvl 9 sk good, on account<br/>
&gt; of the paladin has 3 times normal hp (due to all the<br/>
&gt; healing), whereas we<br/>
&gt; get a spell that bites him for 5 damage and suck<br/>
&gt; away some of his str. but<br/>
&gt; eventually i think we accelerate in power faster<br/>
&gt; than paladins.. by the time<br/>
&gt; we get to lvl 50 in our best equipment, we would be<br/>
&gt; fully capable of beating<br/>
&gt; the snot out of a lvl 50 paladin in his best<br/>
&gt; equipment. (also, we dont have<br/>
&gt; to kill the lava dragon for a darkreaver ;)) upon<br/>
&gt; checking back to the guild<br/>
&gt; periodically i have seen a great many necro spells<br/>
&gt; being imped for SK use at<br/>
&gt; high level, including some of the powerful DOT<br/>
&gt; spells, spirit armor, and<br/>
&gt; expulse undead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; also, while i admit that HT vs lay on hands isnt<br/>
&gt; very fair, remember that HT<br/>
&gt; IS rather powerful. most melee combat classes cant<br/>
&gt; boast the ability to<br/>
&gt; knock off a third or a half of their target&#39;s life<br/>
&gt; with a single attack and<br/>
&gt; still be able to go ahead and wail away with nasty<br/>
&gt; implements of pointy<br/>
&gt; death. my suggestion is not to boost HT, but to TONE<br/>
&gt; DOWN lay on hands. the<br/>
&gt; ability to heal that much is just not reasonable;<br/>
&gt; altho i have heard of<br/>
&gt; people having lay on hands interrupted, while it is<br/>
&gt; not possible to<br/>
&gt; interrupt HT that i have seen, it being<br/>
&gt; instantaneous. can anyone confirm<br/>
&gt; the possibility of lay on hands to be interrupted?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; there is a very good reason why HT can be resisted:<br/>
&gt; imagine about 20 lvl 10<br/>
&gt; sk all charge a griffin and simultaneously lay a<br/>
&gt; harm touch on it, causing<br/>
&gt; it to die instantly. now somebody is going to get a<br/>
&gt; crapload of xp out of<br/>
&gt; that, and it&#39;d be a hideously unfair trick for us.<br/>
&gt; even more lame than the<br/>
&gt; little bard accelerando-run in circles-bellow thing!<br/>
&gt; i admit i become quite<br/>
&gt; annoyed seeing HT resisted or soaked altogether, but<br/>
&gt; i try very hard not to<br/>
&gt; fight things that are guaranteed to resist it when<br/>
&gt; it can be helped anyway :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; now, if only they will figure out why we and<br/>
&gt; paladins cant hit worth a damn,<br/>
&gt; i think both classes are fully toe to toe with most<br/>
&gt; other classes for the<br/>
&gt; better part of the game. i still think it&#39;d be a bad<br/>
&gt; idea to duel a lvl 50<br/>
&gt; wizard with an SK, but the again, who COULD? :)<br/>
