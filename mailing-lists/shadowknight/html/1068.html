<div id="ygrps-yiv-979741452">its sad to see you go xillith :( granted there are jerks on all servers, but<br/>
at least on fennin there are so many people that you are bound to find some<br/>
decent folk once in a while..<br/>
<br/>
i got a decayed mail today, so that implies to me that 2 pieces are still<br/>
needed. (also my bracer in the bank was still &quot;right&quot;). however, since i<br/>
only killed one crusader for that one decayed, there MAY be an increase in<br/>
the frequency of decayed drops.<br/>
<br/>
of course, one kill is hardly statistical :) i&#39;ll be back there later<br/>
tonight and i&#39;ll let ya know what i find<br/>
