<div id="ygrps-yiv-31707757">I havent bought a quiver, and for the price, i dont see why anyone<br/>
should, unless we could put it in the ammo slot, which at this point i<br/>
dont believe we can.<br/>
Putting the arrows in a backpack seems to work just fine as long as you<br/>
have at least one of the same type of arrow in the ammo slot.<br/>
<br/>
I have bought the fletching book, but i dont recall anything mentioning<br/>
bowing. Maybe my memory is fading with old age, but does anyone know<br/>
where in Freeport i may aquire a book on this subject.<br/>
 And at what fletcing level should i try making bows and what are the<br/>
components.<br/>
I think you need a staff of some kind and a string.<br/>
I have also heard cams may need to be used.<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
