<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259349834"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; After Talking to a few dark elf sks we decided that<br/>
&gt; giving us a good 1hand sword quest weapon and raising<br/>
&gt; the cap a little on bash would be best for the human<br/>
&gt; and dark elf sks.  We decided maybe a 1hander around<br/>
&gt; 12dmg 36dly and an effect of poison bolt or a weak<br/>
&gt; lifetap i dunno thats up to you. its basically<br/>
&gt; supposed to be like  a ghoulbane.  You could even make<br/>
&gt; it human and de only if you like. This would help us<br/>
&gt; because now we can carry a shield and have a decent<br/>
&gt; 1hander instead of always having to carry a 2hander<br/>
&gt; and lose the ability to bash which the large races do<br/>
&gt; not....let me know what you think<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A new 1HS weapon, just wonderful. As if carrying around the Dark Reaver and<br/>
Fleshripper weren&#39;t enough, now you want the SMALL guys to lug around a 1H<br/>
sword AND a shield too. Yay. My Str is only 97, and even with an EE Bag,<br/>
that stuff is still heavy. Not to mention a whole &#39;nother skill to keep up<br/>
with, ugh.<br/>
<br/>
Better options:<br/>
1.) Give us kick. Humans and Dark Elves will use it, large races won&#39;t<br/>
(because they have slam). Also fits into the image of SKs being mean,<br/>
under-handed, intense damage-dealing tanks.<br/>
2.) Give us spells (like Banshee Aura) that are human/de only. Larges can<br/>
outsource to druids/mages for their damshields.<br/>
3.) Make some new human/de only items (not necessarily weapons). The easiest<br/>
way to do this is just make some new SK armor that is medium-sized, the<br/>
larges just can&#39;t wear em, but the human/de SKs can.<br/>
