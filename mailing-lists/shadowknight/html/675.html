 </span></blockquote>the SK quests, but they are sorted by zone, and it is <br/>
much more interesting<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m also interested in finding faction breakdowns, etc.<br/>

This site has links to a Faction Chart that is sortable <br/>
many ways:<br/>
List of Faction Groups <br/>
Faction Adjustments by Monster <br/>
Faction Adjustments by Group <br/>
Faction Adjustments by Quest<br/>
<br/>
There are also Quest links that are the most complete I <br/>
have ever seen.  These are listed by Zone but are also <br/>
viewable by Item.  So if you know what you want, scan <br/>
the list.<br/>
