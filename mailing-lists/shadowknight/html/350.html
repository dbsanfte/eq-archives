&gt; I have put a couple of training points in to Archery and have fired a lot of<br/>
&gt; arrows at blue and above creatures, and haven&#39;t gained any experience and I<br/>
&gt; have been keeping watch on it.  I have fired over 200 arrows and nothing.<br/>
&gt; Is their any reason? or just plain bad luck.  I think my pets and party<br/>
&gt; members are getting mad at me becuse they want me to tank for them but I<br/>
&gt; really want to increase my archery skill.  I have a long bow with the<br/>
&gt; standard arrows.  Plus I couldn&#39;t find the book on making arrows in .... the<br/>
&gt; dark elf city ... Neriak(?) anyone know where it is?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
