<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-402081670">I personally dont have this problem but i have run across a SK who&#39;s<br/>
Guild Master doesnt offer any training in Alter. And no amount of<br/>
casting Siphon Stregth brings it up.<br/>
He is a level 10 SK, so he should be able to train in it.<br/>
I dont have all the details, as in Race and his area.<br/>
I was just wondering if anyone else has run into this?<br/>
