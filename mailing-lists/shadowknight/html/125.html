<div id="ygrps-yiv-437276884">I must say that a massive Feedback campaign is not the way to go. I would try<br/>
to email Verant with a well written letter, and cross post it to the message<br/>
boards as well as the major web pages. If all this doesn&#39;t work, it would be<br/>
understandable if you went to greater length to be heard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However, I don&#39;t think there are any issues to be raised. I fully comprehended<br/>
when it told me my character would be Hard to play, and that is half the<br/>
challenge of it. Sure it is a pain in the arse, but until you start to enjoy<br/>
your character for what it is and what it can do, you will never enjoy EQ. It<br/>
is pointless compareing yourself to other characters and wishing you had what<br/>
they had. To be perfectely honest, I beleive I have no equal in combat at my<br/>
level other then another SK, and i am only lvl 14. I have had this belief<br/>
since I was level 8 and beat the crap out of a lvl 9 monk. I still beleive I<br/>
can do the same against every other class.<br/>

&gt; Well, it sounds like people are interested in trying something.  We need<br/>
&gt; to:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.      Come up with a couple common things that we want addressed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.      Have 1 day where everyone gets on and /feedbacks them either the<br/>
&gt; same statement or a statement containing identical issues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So how many people are on this list?  How many are willing to participate?<br/>
&gt; And when do we want to do it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oogog<br/>
