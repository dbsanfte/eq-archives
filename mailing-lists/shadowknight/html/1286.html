I&#39;m power gamer alkl the way with a 50 human SK and a 48 barb rogue.<br/>
Just got myself some more Umbral so I can get my AC up around 860 which is<br/>
nice. for any hunting above 45 + your tanks should have 800 AC minimum and 850<br/>
+ preferably.<br/>
<br/>
Warriors still make much better tanks, especially after they get plane gear,<br/>
but SK&#39;s are way more versatile and have more options. They are all the best<br/>
for general CRing due to both invis&#39;s and FD. I used to think darkforged was<br/>
pretty average, but looking at the AC on some of it, it seems worthwhile to<br/>
get. Remeber, AC is everything.<br/>
<br/>
At lvl 20 you might want to try unrest, sol A, cazic, UGuk. You should also be<br/>
trying to find a good group of regular players. don&#39;t be discouraged if they<br/>
make mistakes, but watch to see if they learn from them and be better. Nothing<br/>
will get you to 50 quicker then having a solid group you can always party with<br/>
who know how each other plays.<br/>
<br/>
FG&#39;s are rather simple for us now due to lots of experience. 2 groups is about<br/>
the minimum to try them with though. 4 is preferable for the learning process<br/>
until you know what to do. If you have 48 + enchanters they will be able to<br/>
charm one FG which will aid the fight a lot. otherwise you should have 3 group<br/>
conentrating on 1 FG and 1 group tanking the other ones off the casters /<br/>
cleric. After the first 3 (remember to charge across the bridge for that one)<br/>
you can have your cleric bind just there which will speed up CR&#39;s heaps. make<br/>
sure the rebind when they get out though. The worst pull you should get is 4,<br/>
and that is later on towards the end. Also, make sure you use a lvl 50 to pull<br/>
the throne room. they have a better chane of pulling just a couple of FG&#39;s<br/>
instead of a lot. if all else fails, try FD pulling.<br/>
<br/>
As for a dragon, not having a bard is going to hurt you. A lot!<br/>
You need to have your mr at 100 or 150 + and fire resist at 150 to 200 +. On<br/>
everyone. so start collecting your jewellery and items to get up to those<br/>
numbers. they are vital. forget stats and AC and mana and everything until you<br/>
are at those resists or you will get creamed. general groupings is 2 cleric<br/>
bard 3 tanks for at least 3 groups and the casters in the rest. the melee are<br/>
tghe key to winning the fight. once all the melee are dead, the fight is over.<br/>
Naked casters charging the dragon will onlylose them xp so make them stop asap.<br/>
grab the corpses and form up for another try. due to the recent changed,<br/>
dragons are now oneshot only. by the time you are ready to try as 2 nd, they<br/>
are at full health, so its pretty much all or nothing. but you should try and<br/>
even if you fail you willlearn from it and gain experiece.<br/>
<br/>
In both cases you should have a loot system set up before hand. nothing sours a<br/>
raid more then arguments over loot afterwards, and worse still, ninjalooting.<br/>
<br/>
Planes would take few pages to detail, so I&#39;ll leave you to experient. if<br/>
you&#39;re still having trouble ask again 8)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps all the people I answered.<br/>

&gt; Well I just found out there was a list about amonth ago and this thread is<br/>
&gt; the first one i have received so I&#39;ll introduce myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just got 47 with Squiggles, My Troll SK on Vallon Zek. I am the leader of<br/>
&gt; &lt;Da Bashin&#39; Iggles&gt;. My guild and our allies are preparing for a dragon<br/>
&gt; raid in a month at the max. Tried Fire Giants for the first time on<br/>
&gt; Saturday night, did ok on the first 3, but got massacred after that. Anyone<br/>
&gt; got any tips on FG&#39;s, dragons, or breaking into the Planes? Pulling<br/>
&gt; locations for FG&#39;s would be most beneficial at this time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me remind you that this is Race War PvP server so we are an al evil<br/>
&gt; team guild, as are our allies. So we don&#39;t have bards or monks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks in advance,<br/>
