<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215498615">the book is part of the necro armor quests out of the temple of solusek ro.<br/>
it has nothing to do with sk armor.<br/>
<br/>
the npc with the sk armor is the undead knight. it appears in the room<br/>
directly underneath the crypt. however, he is broken. he does not respond to<br/>
hails. not that it matters, since he will be killed as soon as he spawns,<br/>
simply because casters who are abusing a pathing bug upstairs come down to<br/>
that room to rest. and they may decide to off him for fun.<br/>
<br/>
his spawn rate is greater than 2 hours. how long exactly? i have no f&#39;in clue.<br/>
<br/>
oh yes, the bayle list quest in fp is still broken. just wasted a quest item<br/>
it took me two days to get. is there some reason that verant sees fit to<br/>
give us quests and then insult us by having them not work?<br/>
