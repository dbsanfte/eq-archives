<b>Subject:</b> New twist on Weapons and Armor ... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126318331">This of course is only a suggestion and most likely<br/>
never be implemented. But here it goes.<br/>
<br/>
How about weapons and armor granted to those of<br/>
specific deities. For instance, not only is the<br/>
Pestilence Scythe for WAR,SHD,NEC, but it is for<br/>
worshippers of Bertoxxulous only.<br/>
Sure SKs and Necros of other deities can cast all the<br/>
same spells, but worshippers of Bertoxx have a special<br/>
relationship with death and disease. They should have<br/>
exclusive rights to this type of a weapon.<br/>
Why should a warrior of Tunare have access to the<br/>
Pestilence Scythe?They are supposed to abhore that<br/>
type of power.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this is only an example. All religions will<br/>
have their own special little things, and this wont<br/>
apply to all weapons and armor, just certain ones.<br/>
<br/>
And for all the Agnostics out there who will complain,<br/>
tough. Thats what you get for taking the easy way out.<br/>
<br/>
I just think certain items need more history behind<br/>
them. Right now everything is either class/race<br/>
specific. Religion is totally ignored. This doesnt<br/>
make sense since religion is a huge part of the game.<br/>
Lets try adding something in there that gives us more<br/>
of a reason to follow a certain deity.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just a random thought as i sit here at work<br/>
bored to tears.<br/>
