<div id="ygrps-yiv-193295836">Hey all, <br/>
<br/>
	I finally got to level 10 and can now cast my first pet.<br/>
unfortunately, it seems to wander off all the time.  But only in the<br/>
Feerot so far.  It worked ok in Innothule swamp, but in the feerot, it<br/>
seems to go berzerk.  Anyway, Just wondering if anyone had this happen to<br/>
them.  What other zones does it happen in?  Let me know f you have any<br/>
info...Also curious, what are some of the pet commands.  The only one that<br/>
seemed to work was /pet sit down.  I tried /pet attack, /pet kill, /pet<br/>
follow me.  Thanks, <br/>
<br/>
