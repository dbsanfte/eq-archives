<b>Subject:</b> More fun with Decaying <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264037480">Through a 6 hour period we killed about 8 Crusaders.<br/>
Not bad. We&#39;ve spent much more time there and have<br/>
killed less. But how many pieces of decaying do you<br/>
think were dropped? one. 6 hours, 8 Crusaders one<br/>
drop.<br/>
<br/>
But thats not even the best part. Now sit back and<br/>
listen to my tale.<br/>
<br/>
We are on our 3rd or 4th Crusader. KIll him. Loot.<br/>
Nothing again. Damnit.<br/>
Our rogue says &quot;I got it!&quot;<br/>
&quot;ummm..you got what?&quot;<br/>
rogue, &quot;a BP!&quot;<br/>
&quot;WHAT!?!?!&quot;<br/>
rogue, &quot;a decaying BP&quot;<br/>
<br/>
much swearing and cursing ensues.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;its NO DROP&quot;<br/>
rogue,&quot;oh, damnit&quot;<br/>
&quot;why do you think we were the only ones looting them?&quot;<br/>
rogue,&quot;i didnt loot it. I pickpocketed it&quot;<br/>
&quot;WHAT!?!?!&quot; &quot;i thought rogues pickpocket from a<br/>
different pool than the loot one&quot;<br/>
rogue, &quot;different pool for cash, but not items. But<br/>
those items are supposed to be inaccessible&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So now we have a rogue who pickpocketed our SK only NO<br/>
DROP item.<br/>
<br/>
My friend petitions. Rogue petitions.<br/>
Both end up talking to a guide since no real GM is on.<br/>
She &quot;can&#39;t&quot; do anything about it.<br/>
The rogue puts up a good fight though.She does feel<br/>
real bad about it. She goes thru how bad this<br/>
knowledge would be if it got spread to the public. <br/>
<br/>
Think about it. How many people would want rogues<br/>
around at all if they thought they might pickpocket<br/>
the quest items that they need?<br/>
<br/>
The guide started to see the resoning. However still<br/>
no BP for us. Even the suggestion of creating a<br/>
dynamic character and letting one of us loot the BP<br/>
from him wasnt accepted.<br/>
<br/>
And thats how we left it.<br/>
<br/>
3 or 4 Crusaders later with no decaying and both of us<br/>
SKs were just too ticked to keep playing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The moral of the story..ummm..there isnt one i dont<br/>
think..but do yourself a favor and make sure you tell<br/>
any rigue you are grouped with to NOT pickpocket the<br/>
Crusaders or you will be added a sequel to my little<br/>
adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Now let me say this. The BP isnt all that great and i<br/>
wouldnt wear it anyway. But i would still like to do<br/>
the quest if i happen to end up with the items. <br/>
But more importantly, this could have just as easily<br/>
been an item i needed.<br/>
<br/>
And i did a nice little FEEDBACK right before i logged<br/>
letting &quot;them&quot; know how lame and pathetic this<br/>
so-called &quot;quest&quot; is.<br/>
And i dont consider this a quest. Sitting in CT<br/>
waiting for the same MOB over and over is camping, not<br/>
questing.<br/>
There was obviously no thought process put into this<br/>
at all.<br/>
And has anyone found a weapon quest for SKs yet?<br/>
Throughout the different sites i have noticed that<br/>
quite a few classes have had weapon quests put in with<br/>
the last patch. Just wondering if we got the same<br/>
consideration *snicker*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thats my rant for today.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy kiddies<br/>
