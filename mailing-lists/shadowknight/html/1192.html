<b>Subject:</b> human sk fac <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-491728345">being a human sk of innoruuk, i can tell you that not only can i train in<br/>
neriak, the necro guild views me warmly ;p<br/>
<br/>
however, since i started working on fac on them a LONG time ago, they may<br/>
have slightly lowered human fac with the dead in the meantime.. my wife was<br/>
indifferent and unable to train when she first went to them :( but we&#39;re<br/>
working on that ;)<br/>
<br/>
another interesting question: human sk fac with the heretics of odus. this<br/>
may be important once they add paineel, which is a city full of erudite<br/>
necros. i know that human sk of innoruuk starts out threateningly to them :(<br/>
i&#39;ve been working on killing a few erudite npcs to raise fac with them, but<br/>
it isnt easy.. guard ranlan in fp assisted palatos kynarn (a silly erudite<br/>
enchanter in the slums) for no apparent reason, even tho ranlan views me<br/>
kindly. its the only time i&#39;ve ever seen the militia assist an npc other<br/>
than a merchant or another militia member, and i dont know why he did in<br/>
this case. in any event, ranlan is a total badass, and beat my good looking<br/>
behind into the ground ;p so just be careful if you plan on harvesting<br/>
palatos for heretic faction ;)<br/>
<br/>
by the way.. i know DE sk of innoruuk defaults to apprehensive to the<br/>
heretics (gotta love that guise of the deciever) and TSK of cazic thule may<br/>
actually have some fairly good faction with them.. unsure of how anybody<br/>
else stands with them tho.<br/>
<br/>
one last thing: i got MM faction by killing princess lenya. MASSIVE faction<br/>
change. however, she is no longer in highkeep as of a recent patch.<br/>
