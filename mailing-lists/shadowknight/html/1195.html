Level 45 TSK.<br/>
If I was to use my entire bar of mana on a mob I could tap 180 dmg out of<br/>
it. At my level that is about 3/4 of a bubble healing and not even a scratch<br/>
to the mob. Now at a cast time of 2.5 secs this is not a spell you want to<br/>
be casting when face up to a mob. Does to little damage to justify casting<br/>
during combat.<br/>
<br/>
A ranger can cast a 99dmg DD for 70 mana, and Heal for 80dmg at 60 mana.<br/>
<br/>
Thats 495 dmg and 400 healing for the same mana cost.<br/>
<br/>
We dont even wanna go to paladin healing/mana efficancy<br/>
<br/>
me thinks mr GZ is just snuffing his damn job and didnt really in house<br/>
balance test a damn thing.<br/>
<br/>
If other hybrids get direct damage/heals that are so mana effeciant, why is<br/>
it unbalancing if the SK get the same? Why is our armor less ac then<br/>
rubi/ivy etc?  I mean, they can even do there heals while not in combat. We<br/>
have to backup, (not swinging), and cast these spells... Why is it so<br/>
unbalancing? We are KOS everywhere. We have been on the nerfing end of<br/>
verant since the game started. What is SO powerfull about us that we get<br/>
these ungodly exp  penalties, kos everywhere, BAD spells, lifetaps that cost<br/>
3 times mana that heal a level 1 necro, and items, ermm, our new armor kinda<br/>
sucks compared to everyone(except the paladins, lol, but at least they can<br/>
buff thereselves). I just dont get it. What is so tuff about a SK? Is there<br/>
something I am missing?<br/>
It seems that for the exp penalties and KOS, we should be better in other<br/>
areas. Paladins get the spanky swords, everyone else gets better equipment,<br/>
every other hybrids spells blow ours away. Hell, the warriors are getting<br/>
beefed up every patch, while we get these &quot;bones&quot; throwed at us, with hidden<br/>
nerfs in them...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for ranting/whining, but am I the only one that feels like we are<br/>
getting everscrewed?</div>
