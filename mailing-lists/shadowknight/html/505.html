<div id="ygrps-yiv-614993332">Speaking of quests, some may wish to try the Helm of Hukulk quest which<br/>
begings in Grobb by talking to the SK guildmaster, Hukulk.<br/>
This helm raises STR and AGI by 3, and is only wearable by the evil races<br/>
(sorry humans you miss out on this one).<br/>
I&#39;m a Dark Elf SK and I managed to get the helm, so let me tell you that<br/>
this quest is very worth completing.<br/>
If you can&#39;t figure it out you can always hit EQ&#39;Lizer too hehe.<br/>
(it does require you to be about level 20 tho)<br/>
