<b>Subject:</b> when GMs go bad.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135403227">having played on MUDs for some years, i know one thing: if a wiz wants to<br/>
toy with you, let em, so long as its in good spirit. imho if you cant stand<br/>
a little friendly abuse from player gods, yer playing the wrong game..<br/>
HOWEVER, in your situation, i can&#39;t say if he was just shoving you around or<br/>
being genuinely juvenile. what is the name you used for your character? what<br/>
is the name you had him change it to at first? what are the EXACT words you<br/>
used to talk to him? i tend to give GMs the benefit of the doubt (since<br/>
there are relatively few of them compared to the large numbers of genuine<br/>
nutcases online) so i dont want to try to judge anybody unless i know more<br/>
info.. but since you know what happened, if you really think this guy was<br/>
abusing his GM powers, send an email to verant detailing the situation and<br/>
the name of the GM. since everquest is corporate run, not privately<br/>
administrated like most MUDs, i dunno exactly what kind of response you&#39;d<br/>
get.. hopefully something that helps you out tho.<br/>
