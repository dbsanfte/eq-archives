<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875593881">Best place is to go to Great divide and hunt Kodiaks in K3.  This is <br/>
the third cave south of the druid ring.  I didn&#39;t start hunting there <br/>
till 41, but grouped with people 35+.  With a balanced group and a <br/>
good (read non-stop) puller, I was able to do 42 in a little under 4 <br/>
hours.  Stay there till 45, then go to guk.<br/>
