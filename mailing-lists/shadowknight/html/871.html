Dismal Rage Message Intercept:<br/>
<br/>
Raltur Calikson in the shadowknights guild asks you to [serve] your Lord,<br/>
Innoruuk. He explains that much like the Dark Elves of Neriak use trolls and<br/>
ogres as pawns,so does the Dismal Rage (the shadowknight guild) use the<br/>
Freeport Militia.  Raltur wants you to report to Sir Lucan D&#39;Leer himself<br/>
(found in the main militia building by the western gates), and tell him that<br/>
you [are from the Shrine of Innoruuk]. You are instructed to do whatever Sir<br/>
Lucan asks, because after all, little favors lead to large debts. Most<br/>
importantly, if you find something important, you are to bring it to him,<br/>
not Sir Lucan.  Talking to Sir Lucan reveals a different attitude as he<br/>
berates the Dismal Rage for being slow to send an agent. He even threatens<br/>
to have them broken up and jailed. Finally he tells you that his guards have<br/>
reported that there is a messenger from Qeynos staying at an Inn on the<br/>
western edge of the Commonlands. You are to go and intercept this message.<br/>
In fact you must kill Mojax Hikspin, who is sitting on the south ridge of<br/>
the lake in the western Commonlands. He has the message that was ment for<br/>
the Knights of Truth.  (and is the source of the Paladin&#39;s Message quest)<br/>
If you bring this message to Raltur Calikson in the Shadow Kngihts guild he<br/>
will give you a first level spell (other than faction and exp adjustment)<br/>
and he will give you another quest to kill the traitor (see traitor quest<br/>
below).<br/>
<br/>
The faction for completing the quest is as follows:  Freeport Militia -<br/>
Better,  Coalition of Trade Folk III - Better,  Knights of Truth - Worse,<br/>
Priest of Marr - Worse.<br/>
<br/>
The Traitor:<br/>
<br/>
After intercepting the message for Sir Lucan D&#39;Lere, he gives you the<br/>
assignment to kill the traitor mentioned in the note and return his militia<br/>
tunic.  The traitor&#39;s name is Guard Alayle, and he is in the Freeport<br/>
Militia House&#39;s backyard.  You may have to kill him several times before he<br/>
will give you a tunic .<br/>
<br/>
Return the tunic for money and the following faction:  Freeport Militia -<br/>
Better,   Coalition of Trade Folk III - Better,   Knights of Truth - Worse,<br/>
Priest of Marr - Worse.<br/>
