My mistake, I wasn&#39;t clear or I misspoke.  Human SKs in particular do need a lot of help, simply because the SK was pretty much<br/>
designed with the Troll/Ogre SK in mind and was balanced as such, however any &quot;help&quot; given the class would actually be given to all<br/>
SKs I believe, not just Humans.<br/>
