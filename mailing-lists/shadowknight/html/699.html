<div id="ygrps-yiv-648644430">Ok, to answer my own question, I went to Allakhazam. Sure enough, it&#39;s the same Thex Mallet quest that yields the Ring of the Dead. Also, the pic I saw of the weapon was chargeless, and therefore I thought the Reaper&#39;s proc was a complete heal, doh! It only has 1 charge of the heal, but still, it&#39;s like a one-time Lay-Hands for us SKs.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, false alarm.<br/>

  Reaper of the Dead -- new on eq&#39;lizer, SK only, and it&#39;s effect is COMPLETE HEAL! Wow, I&#39;d carry that around just for the effect!<br/>
<br/>
  Now for the tough part, have any of you questing SKs gotten one? It&#39;s a quest reward, and I figure you guys&#39;d know best.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for any help!<br/>
