<div id="ygrps-yiv-990947817">definitly nice to see some posts today :)  another question for the ogre&#39;s<br/>
and trolls.  I use a 2handed weapon, as I didn&#39;t really see the need for a<br/>
shield and bash as we can slam.  Anyone found anything different and<br/>
actually use a 1handed weapon?<br/>

&gt; Hi all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good to see a little action on the SK list again! I just thought<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d add my<br/>
&gt; 2 cp worth.<br/>
&gt; I play a Human Sk on Veeshan. Just a bub off lvl 28 now and hangin for my<br/>
&gt; new spells! I&#39;m still mostly in banded but quite a few magical<br/>
&gt; pieces on me<br/>
&gt; such as Barbed arms, grotesque mask and black crown. I carry a Bibs for 2H<br/>
&gt; and a PGT with cracked darkwood for 1H. I&#39;ve founbd that in a<br/>
&gt; small group of<br/>
&gt; less then 3 I&#39;m better off with the 1 H since it is more of a defensive<br/>
&gt; setup while in a larger group dmg done is more important so I use<br/>
&gt; the bibs.<br/>
&gt; I also carry a Dragoon Dirk in my range slot foir the Dex bonus<br/>
&gt; which means<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t carry my beloved Ashwood Bow<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My favourtie story would have to be when I dueled someone. The whole diel<br/>
&gt; lasted 30 min which is more of a marathon. Using a combination of shadow<br/>
&gt; step and attckking I employed hit and run tactics. Eventually I succumbed<br/>
&gt; having only done 127 dmg total 8( I don;t feel too bad however since the<br/>
&gt; person I was dueling was a lvl 38 Necro when I was just lvl 26.<br/>
&gt; Imagine what<br/>
&gt; it would have been like if we had been close in lvl! I trully<br/>
&gt; beleive the SK<br/>
&gt; are nest best duellers after the Casters and even then we can give them a<br/>
&gt; run for their mioney!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;&#39;s about it for me!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll keep in touch!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good hunting to you all!<br/>
