<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364323911">Abjuration!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, maybe I goofed on this one, but can anyone tell me the fastest way to<br/>
increase Abjuration? I spent 20 minutes last night casting Prot. vs. Cold on<br/>
myself and everyone that came into the Neriak bank last night and I only<br/>
increased the skill by maybe 4 points.<br/>
My Trolls Int is a 65 (that is with holding the Grobb Cleaver!). Would you<br/>
suggest spending training points in it or waiting to train other skill like<br/>
Parry next level and Double Attack at 20th?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Strength!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, for all you high level Ks out there:<br/>
Is there a way to calculate the max damage done by a weapon based on the<br/>
characters strength and the base damage of the weapon?</div>
