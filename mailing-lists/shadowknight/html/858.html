<div id="ygrps-yiv-368771436">I have been in Najena a few times.  The last time I was <br/>
there my group was masacered after a very short distance.<br/>
We didn&#39;t even kill anything except skeletons.<br/>
Before that I was alone and only killed the 3 skeles at <br/>
the entrance.<br/>
I don&#39;t remember seeing any faction adjustments, but <br/>
does anyone know for sure with these?<br/>
Also in Befallen, do you only take a faction hit for <br/>
killing the Necro NPCs and initiates and named undead?<br/>
I have killed 3 or 4 initiates when grouped with a <br/>
fellow guildie.  I remember seeing a faction hit for The <br/>
Dead.  Is that only with the DEs or does that include <br/>
all Necros?  How do you increase faction with The Dead?<br/>
This may also be why the DE Necro quest for Lindeal&#39;s <br/>
Testimony didn&#39;t work for me. Heh.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

&gt;I also want to see what my faction is before i go in<br/>
&gt;there. I made the mistake in Najena by just going in<br/>
&gt;there and killing stuff, when my faction was Dubious<br/>
&gt;with all but the undead. </span></blockquote></div>
