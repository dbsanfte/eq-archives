Looks like they made the Lifetaps live for all those that care, now I&#39;m<br/>
curious. Since I own the spells they are replacing will the lifetaps already<br/>
be in my spell book? This is mainly out of curiosity since I won&#39;t be able<br/>
to play for another 10 hrs or so.. <br/>
<br/>
Oh and if you noticed they made two other changes that effect SK&#39;s. First<br/>
they added +4 to our Poison/Disease resistance (Always nice to get something<br/>
you didn&#39;t ask for), and it looks like they reduced the casting time and<br/>
mana cost of Invoke Fear.. <br/>
<br/>
One more thing while I&#39;m thinking about spells, why do they give us<br/>
Ultravision at lvl 49 when they we have Deadeye at 22? Is ultravision that<br/>
much better, or am I just missing something being a DE?<br/>
<br/>
Well that should do it for now.. Oh and it looks like they itemized Kedge<br/>
keep (I knew that Fish Bone earring would come in handy someday)..<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy<br/>
