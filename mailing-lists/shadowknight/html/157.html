<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627054575">i have learned that (at least in the beta) the darkreavers are located in<br/>
lower guk. however, knowing the hell you have to go thru in lower guk to get<br/>
the paladin&#39;s ghoulsbane weapon, i imagine that you&#39;d need a lvl 30-35 party<br/>
to obtain one. i&#39;ve also heard that black plate armor that MAY or MAY NOT be<br/>
sk-only was also found in lower guk during beta. wether or not any of this<br/>
is still there i can&#39;t say, but it&#39;s worth checking out.<br/>
<br/>
also... from what we know, the darkreaver has an attack of 20. the fiery<br/>
avenger, the paladin&#39;s best weapon, has by all accounts an attack of 35,<br/>
besides casting lava bolt. this implies to me that the darkreaver is NOT our<br/>
most powerful holy sword. if nobody knows the location of our lvl 50 weapon,<br/>
it is probably because nobody has ever played their SK up to lvl 50 before..<br/>
so keep running quests, report ones that dont work, and keep an eye out for<br/>
rumors of powerful equipment ;)<br/>
