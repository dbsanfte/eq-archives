<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203510567">--All this talk about Mistmoore has resurfaced a<br/>
question i have had.<br/>
<br/>
Arlena.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Grimrot&#39;s poor misguided love.<br/>
<br/>
Now at one point in time it was believed that Arlena<br/>
was actually a named gypsy (but NOT Arlena)in MM. Kill<br/>
her, bring her lute to Grimrot and you get a mold and<br/>
note for that electrum bladed whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, the electrum thingy was moved to the<br/>
Avenging Caitiff.<br/>
<br/>
Now, i have yet to actually step foot in MM. Though<br/>
that trip is near. But i know several who have scoured<br/>
MM and no Arlena has been sited.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone heard anything about an NPC named Arlena<br/>
either in or around MM?<br/>
<br/>
And also, has anyone gotten a &quot;lute&quot; quest from<br/>
Grimrot, as opposed to the &quot;Bones&quot; one that i have<br/>
received? To recap that: Grimmy wants you to find<br/>
Arlena and return her bones. I have a screenshot of<br/>
this to prove my sanity.<br/>
<br/>
Now there have been NPCs that my friends were unable<br/>
to get to or defeat. One was a Princess, cloaked<br/>
vampyre (sp?). Maybe one of these were Arlena in<br/>
disguise?<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone questioned the Avenging Caitiff about<br/>
Arlena? Are there any other NPCs in there that will<br/>
speak with us without the usual &quot;YOU MUST DIE&quot; message<br/>
following?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious as to what others have found..<br/>
