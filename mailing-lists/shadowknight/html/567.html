<div id="ygrps-yiv-73700744">Last night I went from 4th level to 6th level. I have <br/>
never advanced more than 1 level in a night after <br/>
reaching 3rd before. That was awesome!  I have a 6th <br/>
level magician that made level just after I created <br/>
Cronik.  Cronik took 4 days the Magician took 4 weeks <br/>
plus some.  At this rate I will be 30th next week ;) .<br/>

That quest for the axe... I wield a 2Haxe right now that <br/>
I bought off a merchant, is it worth the quest? Does it <br/>
give XP/cash/magical axe? Who starts it and where are <br/>
they located?  <br/>
What level is the head mushroom in Innothule Swamp?<br/>
Anyone do the Kukulk Helm quest?<br/>
Any other quests out there that a newbie SK can do?  <br/>
