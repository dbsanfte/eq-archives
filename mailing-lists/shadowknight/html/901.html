<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877649929">Based on the conversations we&#39;ve had in the past, does anyone know if any <br/>
changes are going to take place?<br/>
<br/>
Even if spells don&#39;t change, the one thing I liked about some of the <br/>
proposed changes was to give humans and de&#39;s &quot;kick&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One thing about &quot;hide&quot; which DE&#39;s are born with.  If you&#39;re a rogue, it <br/>
tells you if you suceed or not, but as an SK it doesn&#39;t tell me if it worked <br/>
or not (unless I do cons (only way I can verify)).<br/>
<br/>
Was this a bug or oversight?<br/>
<br/>
And a question for Brian, if you still read this.  A few patches ago, they <br/>
said they implimented something to see your skills and max skill level, but <br/>
that function never worked.  Any word on this?<br/>
