<b>Subject:</b> armor appearance <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-444026298">bathory was entirely correct, the bracers are a deep, blood red; darker than<br/>
rubicite red. which means my rubi greaves now clash. urgh. but the vambraces<br/>
are indeed black (black plate arms are now the ONLY visual thing unique to<br/>
the shadow knight class..), so there are two different colors to our armor.<br/>
but i think the effect is pretty cool tho: if bracers, gauntlets, and boots<br/>
are blood red, in full darkforge we have the appearance of a badass in black<br/>
plate, with arms soaked to the elbows in blood, and feet too! nasty evil<br/>
shadow knights that we are ;) by the way, while meldrath and the minotaur<br/>
hero can be defeated with just a lvl 40 sk and a lvl 49 ranger (found that<br/>
out last night) it is VERY painful. the hero apparently was a hill giant in<br/>
his former life. and he had an axe *pain*<br/>
<br/>
now back to cazic to get rid of these rubi pants..<br/>
<br/>
P.S. you get HELLUVA xp for doing these quests.. turn in the items even if<br/>
you dont want armor, its great!<br/>
