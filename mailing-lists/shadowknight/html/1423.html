I have been playing an SK since EQ went <br/>
online.  Leveling characters has gotten <br/>
easier and easier over time with <br/>
imroved tradeskills, focus effects, <br/>
revisions to the combat tables, <br/>
filtration of items down through the <br/>
economy, etc.  Do you think: <br/>
<br/>
  o this has made playing an SK too easy, I long for the old days. <br/>
  o SK&#39;s will rule no matter what Verant does to the game. <br/>
  o it is about the right difficulty now, SK&#39;s rule the high-end game now. <br/>
  o it is still too hard, the Orcs in East Commons still kick my butt everytime I come by. <br/>
  o ...what?  This list still EXISTS?!?!? <br/>
