I agree. I dont say much on these boards but with a class that starts out as <br/>
tuff you must use it correctly.If you want a easy class be a warrior they <br/>
are simple.If you looking for a challange SK is where its at and every web <br/>
site u goto wil tell you that.Yes the SK is underpowered right now I think, <br/>
but wise use of your character is the best defense against that.<br/>
