<b>Subject:</b> Re: Another archery question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-735948760">Aim is everything in archery.  If you are aiming at your target, and the<br/>
shot misses, it may hit some other NPC on the other side of the target.  If<br/>
an NPC steps in the path of the arrow, the arrow may hit that NPC.  If<br/>
either of these situation occurs, you&#39;ll have one angry NPC on your hands.<br/>
<br/>
One of my other characters uses archery a lot, and this has happened many<br/>
times (one time the arrow went right through a gelatinous cube to hit a<br/>
beggar behind it, who proceeded to kill my character very quickly). <br/>
<br/>
I make it a point to not use arrows if there&#39;s a chance I could hit<br/>
something other than the intended target. (i.e. No guards, giants or<br/>
griffons, etc within my character&#39;s sight.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, if your target turns and runs in another direction, the arrow will<br/>
most times change its path to follow them.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and be careful with those arrows!<br/>
