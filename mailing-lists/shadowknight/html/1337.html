<div id="ygrps-yiv-662722565">I have a Erudite SK on Innoruuk who is level 18.<br/>
I so far have been very pleased with him. I have 107 str and 125 int on him<br/>
right now.<br/>
Getting the STR up will be easy to get up +8 more and +4 more INT with<br/>
Electrum Sapphire earrings.<br/>
I learn 1hs,1hs,bash,meditate,channel,taunt, etc all before I am even 2<br/>
bubbles into a level.<br/>
Due to the high intelligence this has been very helpful especially with<br/>
Archery which is already up to 47 skill.<br/>
Somestimes my taunt is maxed for the level after using it only 7-10 times.<br/>
I would say I am very happy with my Erudite SK. Paineel is a cool place too.<br/>
