<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142874864">That is basically it. To raise skills quickly you must attempt harder stuff.<br/>
Running around killing greens will get your skill up eventually but really<br/>
slowly. To progress steadily attack blues, and to go fast attack yellows and<br/>
above. How? Given your crap at the skill and won&#39;t last long against yellows?<br/>
Kill Steal!! :) Seriously though, when you see othe people attack targets ask<br/>
them if they mind you attacking it to practice your skills. this will allow you<br/>
to practice against the harder targets with relative safety. Most people won&#39;t<br/>
mind since you wont do much damage, but you do get the occasionaly jerks.<br/>

Hopw this helps<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a level 11 dark elf shadowknight, and while I love the 1H mino<br/>
&gt; axe/shield combo, I&#39;m also interested in using 2H weapons, especially if the<br/>
&gt; Dark Reaver turns out to be a 2H weapons. Howver I&#39;ve picked up a 2H sword<br/>
&gt; and only managed to raise the skill to 5, now it won&#39;t move at all (and<br/>
&gt; has&#39;t been for quite some time). Do I need to fight monsters that con blue<br/>
&gt; or something like that? Those of you who have successfully raised 2H please<br/>
&gt; let me know how you&#39;ve done it, although I suppose I&#39;ll always favor 1H<br/>
&gt; since I&#39;l need a shield to bash as a dark elf.<br/>
