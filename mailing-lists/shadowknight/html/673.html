<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674027352">I made level 14 and am 1/2 way to 15 as of last night.  <br/>
I have noticed that &quot;non twinked&quot; varries quite alot by <br/>
definition.  Cronik is minorly twinked, but only because <br/>
a friend gave me a FS2HS when I was 9th or so which I <br/>
still use.  ;)  Evrything else has been bought with <br/>
earned cash.<br/>

&gt;Halberd, or Bone Bladed Claymore<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Is it Lyguna in Innothule that dropps the Brutechopper? <br/>
What level is she?<br/>
In South Karana there is a named wolf that drops a claw <br/>
that is a good 1HS weapon.  Anyone know what level it is?<br/>
Or the Druid that drops the Silvery Scimitar? What is <br/>
the druids name?<br/>
<br/>
I have been waiting to go into Guk until I hit 15.  <br/>
Should I wait a bit more till I get to a higher level?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
