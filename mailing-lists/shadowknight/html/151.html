<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760969130">Even though I do feel, as I&#39;m sure you all know by now, that HT and<br/>
some of the spells do need tweaking, I must defend the SK class.<br/>
<br/>
It has always been said from the beginning that we will NEVER be as<br/>
good a tank or fighter as a Warrior. We will NEVER be as good a caster<br/>
as a Necromancer.<br/>
This should not take you by surprise.<br/>
And you&#39;re only level 10? You&#39;re still a baby to the class, along with<br/>
myself i will add.<br/>
I have a friend who is level 20 SK and he&#39;s a major butt-kicker. We do<br/>
come into our power, but patience and hard work is required.<br/>
<br/>
And if you dont want to role-play the character, you chose the wrong<br/>
line of work.<br/>
<br/>
I am a level 12 Human SK. I have seen the Necromancers I travel with go<br/>
from a level or 2 behind me, to 3 or levels ahead of me. And it is a<br/>
little disheartening. But, this is the curse of the hybrid.<br/>
<br/>
But even these now higher level Necros like a little more muscle in<br/>
between them and the creature wanting to dance on their foreheads. They<br/>
cant cast if they&#39;re getting beat on. <br/>
There have been many situations when even their pet has been killed and<br/>
i&#39;m whats left to take the beating. Which i seem to enjoy in a weird<br/>
and twisted way. <br/>
I still save their butts as often as they save mine.<br/>
<br/>
And when they are out of mana and cant cast those spells that we are so<br/>
jealous of and a train or high ranked creature decides to appear? Whos<br/>
left? Us :) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in short, 10 is too young to decide. If you dont have the<br/>
patience to wait until you come into your power, then SK is the wrong<br/>
class for you. I can see my powers slowly, but surely rising. <br/>
I have no doubt I WILL be feared.<br/>
