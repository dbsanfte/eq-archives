<div id="ygrps-yiv-139073526"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I came across some disturbing info last night...<br/>
&gt; Darkforge Armor is no longer NO DROP.<br/>
&gt; All the pieces that I have that WERE NO DROP, arent<br/>
&gt; any longer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This definitely is bad. Although it was good 10 minutes ago when the stupid<br/>
knight finally spawned after a 6 hour wait and I got my arms, bp and helm<br/>
and then the SK i was waiting with gave me a fire emerald plat ring and<br/>
500pp for the vambraces. :)<br/>
<br/>
In general though I think this is bad. Especially cause the exp reward is<br/>
pretty good. Those three pieces took me from being a sliver from 31 to a<br/>
full bub into 31.<br/>
<br/>
Must sleep now. Tired from sitting on my butt for 6 hours waiting for my<br/>
quest giver to spawn.&lt;&lt;sigh&gt;&gt;</div>
