<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-961490864">After some thought, something crossed my mind.  I have multiple characters, <br/>
just like everyone else here I&#39;m sure.  But there&#39;s one thing I noticed <br/>
about my Wizard.  She can got to ANY guild (except the DE one) to go and <br/>
train.  Which is great.<br/>
<br/>
With my DE SK, I can only train in my home town and with the Human guilds <br/>
(ie Freeport and Qeynos).  The SK&#39;s in Grobb and Ogguk won&#39;t even talk to <br/>
me.  That cuts down half my training options there almost (I never go out to <br/>
Qeynos with a DE SK).  Some people might see where this is going.  To <br/>
Balance things, why not make some of the SK spells race specific.  IF hunans <br/>
and DE&#39;s share the same traits, give them a damage shield, and give the <br/>
ogres and trolls something else.  I don&#39;t care what anyone else says, but <br/>
this game was not meant to be a soloing game.  Go play bard&#39;s tale if you <br/>
want to solo.<br/>
<br/>
Hence if there are going to be training restrictions, I think that variation <br/>
between the training houses would be a good thing.  And make sure that mask <br/>
of the deceiver can&#39;t be used to get around this!  (I hate that mask with a <br/>
passion).  If anything it should turn people into little halfling druids.  <br/>
Now there&#39;s the REAL evil class! &lt;GRiN&gt; just kidding.<br/>

Okie dokie, seems like getting a consensus is NOT going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s try another approach: what WOULD you like to see about the class to<br/>
make it more viable?  The reason the high level shields and DoTs were pulled<br/>
is because (believe it or not) a lot of the players here are SKs and as such<br/>
know the class real well and giving them those capabilities made them into,<br/>
literally, tank mages.  It&#39;s a scary sight seeing these guys at work.<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve stated before, the thing that hurts the SK class are primarily race<br/>
issues -- a damage shield on a human or DE SK is not unbalancing, however it<br/>
IS unbalanced if you put it on a troll or ogre SK.<br/>
<br/>
So what can be changed that makes the class more viable for non-big-races<br/>
but at the same time is not unbalancing for trolls/ogres?<br/>
<br/>
I know HT comes up a lot, but there is a fear that HT could end up being<br/>
heavily abused (worst nightmare....party of 6 50th level SKs stand around<br/>
Mr. Named Mob that only pops once a day anyway, BAM 3000HP gone instantly<br/>
and you now have a mob that starts the fight at 1/2 HP).<br/>
<br/>
If HT was upped slightly, had a slightly higher recharge rate, etc...what<br/>
are your suggestions?<br/>
