<div id="ygrps-yiv-573988513">Just to tell you I sold the BBC already.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone as soon as you get a chance please feedback to verant in game about<br/>
what you thing about Vampiric Embrace.  I sent in my thoughts saying 12hp is<br/>
still not enough and not worth the casting. It does look like verant does<br/>
listen cause they changed VE a second time so tell them what you think.<br/>
