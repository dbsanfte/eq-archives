<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002258142">While I applaud the removal of the useless spells listed, I see the spells<br/>
them giving us to be equally useless. These spells will only benefit the<br/>
lower level Sk&#39;s, and even then only in very limited situations (SOLO). In<br/>
my opinion this is another example of listening to the majority sheep out<br/>
there that get it in their head what would be good for the class without<br/>
playing that class to a decent level (30+). I believe that SK&#39;s would have<br/>
been better served by giving us better offensive spells, or even some<br/>
defensive buffs.<br/>
<br/>
These lifetaps are barely adequate for Necros at the levels they get them,<br/>
for SK&#39;s they would be a gimmick (and again now they can claim that SK&#39;s<br/>
have healing). I would have much rather seen the skill cap on Bind wound<br/>
bumped from 100 to 200. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh well just my opinion.<br/>

Thank you Brian for listening to the players.  Although some may be<br/>
dismayed at the loss of Voice Graft, all in all I don&#39;t think anyone<br/>
can complain about this one.  Let&#39;s hope this makes it to the live<br/>
servers.<br/>
