<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049855138">2H Slashing is best for dealing damage especially in solo situations.  The only long term benefit I&#39;ve seen for a SK to keep up 1H Slashing is for group situations.  Mages are doing most of the damage at higher levels anyways.  So use 1H Slashing and Shield to boost your AC and thus save some or your cleric&#39;s mana by not getting hit as much.  2H Slashing is still important for groups as you need to deal damage to keep taunts workings, so it really depends on play style.  Personally, I&#39;m 2H Slashing all the way.  I just use 1H Slashing to keep my skill up in case I need it later on.<br/>

Really?  Oops.  Haven&#39;t looked at in a while. My bad.<br/>
Thanks for the update.  :)  <br/>
Why then would anyone want 1 HS? We don&#39;t get Dual <br/>
Wield, but do get Double Attack.  Is there a 1HS weapon <br/>
that does alot of damage?  The highest I&#39;ve seen is a <br/>
Crystalline Blade at 11 damage (besides Ghoulbane at 15 <br/>
damage). <br/>
Anyone on this list use a weapon other than a 2HS?  How <br/>
does it compare to damage done by MOBS at higher level? <br/>
Is it good as a solo adventurer? <br/>
I sent out a website that lists SK weapons, but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t tell you that a 12 damage sword with a strength <br/>
of 124 will do 25 max damage at 12th level with 2HS <br/>
maxed. :)<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
