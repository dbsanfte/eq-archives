<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268726945">I thought I&#39;d sure a few of the details about the life leech spell so you<br/>
know what you are aiming for.<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to know then don&#39;t read<br/>

the life leech is 280 lifetap with 315 mana cast (about 2 bubs for me with<br/>
112 INT)<br/>
recast is about 2min and 2 .5 casting time.<br/>
<br/>
It by no means turnes you into a healer, but does add another weapon to our<br/>
arsenal. I would consider it to be another form of Harm Touch but used much<br/>
more often.<br/>
<br/>
The Quest itself is easily the hardest I have heard of so don&#39;t expect to do<br/>
it straight away. The soulfire is a childs play in comparison.<br/>
You must be lvl 50 to talk to the guy giving out the quest but you can get<br/>
the details and start earlier then that. The spell is lvl 49.<br/>
and start saving your money, need 3 K to do it 8)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</div>
