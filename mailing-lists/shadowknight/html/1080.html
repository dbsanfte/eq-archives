<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317876620">a word on style:<br/>
<br/>
i see...i would hope that the vambraces and bp are the only black <br/>
pieces...leaving everything else (greaves, boots, bracers, helm, gauntlets) <br/>
red. i&#39;ve always liked that type of color blend on my sk. looked especially <br/>
nice a black iron bp, arms and steel extremities.<br/>

&gt;bathory was entirely correct, the bracers are a deep, blood red; darker <br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt;rubicite red. which means my rubi greaves now clash. urgh. but the <br/>
&gt;vambraces<br/>
&gt;are indeed black (black plate arms are now the ONLY visual thing unique to<br/>
&gt;the shadow knight class..), so there are two different colors to our armor.<br/>
&gt;but i think the effect is pretty cool tho: if bracers, gauntlets, and boots<br/>
&gt;are blood red, in full darkforge we have the appearance of a badass in <br/>
&gt;black<br/>
&gt;plate, with arms soaked to the elbows in blood, and feet too! nasty evil<br/>
&gt;shadow knights that we are ;) by the way, while meldrath and the minotaur<br/>
&gt;hero can be defeated with just a lvl 40 sk and a lvl 49 ranger (found that<br/>
&gt;out last night) it is VERY painful. the hero apparently was a hill giant in<br/>
&gt;his former life. and he had an axe *pain*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;now back to cazic to get rid of these rubi pants..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;P.S. you get HELLUVA xp for doing these quests.. turn in the items even if<br/>
&gt;you dont want armor, its great!<br/>
