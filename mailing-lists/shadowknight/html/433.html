<div id="ygrps-yiv-18836860">I don&#39;t know about the exp loss. A long time ago (couple months) I lost a<br/>
duel and lost exp, but people have said that you don&#39;t know, so that might<br/>
have been a bug. You can not loot, however, as I killed a pesky wood elf<br/>
yesterday but I couldn&#39;t loot him. I don&#39;t know about pvp arenas, but I<br/>
doubt you can loot there. You don&#39;t get exp for the kill, either. You do,<br/>
however, get the satisfaction of destroying pesky rangers and paladins.<br/>
that&#39;s quite fun. :)</div>
