<b>Subject:</b> Bayle List fixed yet? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501596989">Anyone know if they&#39;ve fixed the Bayle List quest yet?  I&#39;m <br/>
referring to the Freeport quest.  I petition every few days about<br/>
it, but unless a GM is on, noone even knows what quest I&#39;m talking<br/>
about, and even the server GM wasn&#39;t sure last time I petitioned.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone tried to finish it recently?<br/>
<br/>
And while I&#39;m posting, in the Bloodsaber guild there is a cleric<br/>
who mentions serving the Lord of Disese (misspelled), but I<br/>
couldn&#39;t make her talk.  Anyone know what the deal is there?  I&#39;m<br/>
ready to do some Qeynos quests now that I&#39;m amiable, but I can&#39;t <br/>
find anything other than the kill paladins/drosco/clothspinner/trumpy<br/>
quests.<br/>
