&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
I was young once, like you, and I asked all the same <br/>
questions you did. Beld (Grant V) was kind enough to <br/>
post some very detailed strategies and outlooks that I <br/>
still use to this day. If you only get one thing off <br/>
this list, make sure it&#39;s Beld&#39;s advice. Listen to him.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Beld&#39;s advise has changed the way I look at HT.  I did <br/>
use HT only as an &quot;oh shit I&#39;m gonna die!&quot; panic button <br/>
until that HT email came out.  Right now I am in <br/>
Lavastorm, and as a Troll that really bites when solo <br/>
for xp.  I can really only take on a blue con there and <br/>
have enough HP to limp to a safe point and be OOM. I <br/>
only have a Tentacle Whip, so when fighting a Fire <br/>
Elemental I take a massive beating. I do max of 9 points <br/>
after a Siphon Strength, and 5 with Diseasee Cloud vs <br/>
their max of 23 per hit. Not kewl.  <br/>
This is where Beld&#39;s advise has really helped. With my <br/>
regen, a blue elemental or a black drake is a possible <br/>
victory.  I wait til it is at half life if I can, center <br/>
it in my view and hit the hotkey. I have yet to see it <br/>
not do full damage when used this way, and I have yet to <br/>
die this way as well.  <br/>
In group, it has saved the life of my friends many <br/>
times. The casters go nuts on DD spells and won&#39;t let me <br/>
tank (I like tanking heh) since it frenzies on them.  <br/>
When I notice they are in trouble (since I am watching <br/>
my Slam and Disease Cloud buttons to become available <br/>
again) I hit it and they frenzy on me instead. Then I <br/>
hit Taunt to keep them there while they regen. Very nice.<br/>
I no longer feel weak if I don&#39;t have HT available <br/>
either.  I just pick my targets more carefully, and <br/>
position myself to where I am least likely to be <br/>
ambushed.  I learned very quickly that the doors to <br/>
Najena have an Elemental, Drake and Fire Imp wander path <br/>
going across it. Now I pull them to the doorway of <br/>
Najena and battle it there.  This is also because there <br/>
is a zone point right behind me if I get into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
As for armor.  I have Banded Cloak, Mantle, Helm, Tunic, <br/>
and Leggs.  All the rest is Leather.  I wield a FS2HS, <br/>
Tentacle Whip and a Parrying Dagger (ac 4) but am <br/>
looking for a cheap Chitton Shield.  I have 2 Cut Throat <br/>
Rings to boost my Dex.<br/>
<br/>
Last night just before I logged off the knight that <br/>
spawns in Lavastorm attacked me. KEWL I thought.  I <br/>
conned him and he was blue. NP. I started to beat on him <br/>
and took him to half life. I almost used HT but <br/>
remembered he was a Paladin and waited. Sure enough I <br/>
saw that &quot;feels a healing touch&quot; message. pound, pound, <br/>
pound back down to 1/2 kewl.  Then an elemental joins <br/>
in. damn.  HT the knight, he dies. I loot the testimony <br/>
and run to Najena zone.  3 bubs of health left and no <br/>
suprises on the other side. Now what?  I couldn&#39;t find <br/>
the Necro that starts the quest for that knight, or if I <br/>
did he wouldn&#39;t give the [phrase].  I know it gives you <br/>
a random Damask Item, but I don&#39;t know if I can do the <br/>
quest as a Troll SK.  I will be looking on Alkazam&#39;s <br/>
site today for that info. :) Can&#39;t put it in the bank <br/>
either. :(<br/>
<br/>
I started my SK with the Evil Knight in mind.  But now <br/>
that I am playing him, he isn&#39;t evil.  I help out <br/>
everyone. I don&#39;t do the race-war thing, or the Paladins <br/>
of Marr must die! Except that one in Lavastorm, heh.  I <br/>
just like the abilities.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep that mail flowing!<br/>
