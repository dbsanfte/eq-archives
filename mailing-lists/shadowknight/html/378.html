<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986717281">twice have i fought groflah. twice has he very nearly killed me, and<br/>
twice has his corpse disappeared immedeately upon his death, leaving me<br/>
with no xp and a bunch of nasty faction hits. this is just yet ANOTHER<br/>
broken SK quest in freeport, and quite frankly i&#39;ve given up trying to<br/>
get the GMs to fix them.. i&#39;ve been ragging on them since day one that<br/>
these things are broken, and i&#39;ve seen little effort put into repairing<br/>
them. also broken is the quest where lady shae supposedly drops a list<br/>
of some sort when you kill her. i accept that the thing may be rare, but<br/>
after 50+ kills, i&#39;d assume it would have appeared by now. hell, even<br/>
the guild tunic quest in freeport is broken! is anybody else annoyed by<br/>
this? after all, i level so damn slow that i have little else to do but<br/>
try to do quests :) (i&#39;ve been playing since the release. my main<br/>
character is now just barely lvl 23. i get depressed seeing all these<br/>
lvl 30s and 40s running around...)<br/>
