Don&#39;t get stuck at 27th like me and have pitiful 1H and <br/>
bash.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I get Slam as a Troll. When I hit, I do Bash for 1 <br/>
point.  I have never seen the skill incease for Slam or <br/>
Bash.  Is this because I cannot officially get the Bash <br/>
skill til later levels and have not trained in it? Is <br/>
that at 10th? I&#39;m at work and don&#39;t have my books. :)<br/>
<br/>
Grobb Cleaver Quest:<br/>
What level is the Troll Nerbilik in OOT? Is the recipe <br/>
he drops a lore/no drop item?  Is the HEHE meat lore/no <br/>
drop?  I know the chef will kill me so i was planning on <br/>
either making a mule ogre or paying someone to get it <br/>
for me.<br/>
After getting into Freeport via the tunnels to catch the <br/>
boat for OOT will the guards on the pier KoS me? Are all <br/>
Trolls Kos in freeport regardless of religion?  Will <br/>
killing Orcs in North Ro increase my faction with the <br/>
Freeport Militia or will I need to kill green Deathfists <br/>
in the Freeport newbie zone? Will I ever kill enough to <br/>
let me not be KoS as an SK of Thule?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Lots of questions, but I prefer not to die alot and not <br/>
be able to get my corpse back. :)<br/>
