<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351566701">Ok...I wasn&#39;t sure how all of Freeport worked....I got bound to the<br/>
outside edge of West Freeport...and rarely go in anyhow...mostly so I<br/>
could get bound closer to ECom and WestCom.  As for Grobb and Oggok.<br/>
Trolls and Dark Elves can&#39;t travel into Oggok completely safe.  There are<br/>
Ogres that will KoS us...as weird as it sounds.  I think between evil<br/>
race/class&#39;s   Trolls and Dark Elves get along the best. From what I<br/>
understand they trust each other the most. I don&#39;t really like Ogre&#39;s<br/>
anyhow....so no skin off my back.<br/>
