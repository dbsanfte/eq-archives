&gt; i just got word that the quests may have been changed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; rumor has it that possibly only 1 item is need now<br/>
&gt; instead of the 2.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; NOTE: i used the word rumor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone gone back to MM or Najena for quest info?<br/>

level, which is an improvement.<br/>

I, myself, am leaving EQ, beacause I can&#39;t stand the majority of<br/>
the people on my server.  A druid and a level 50 warrior were tracking<br/>
down and killing all of the crusaders in cazic today so that they could<br/>
do the quests, and then try to find a way to trade the nodrop armor<br/>
to a low level twink.  She was not only doing this, but competing <br/>
with me in /auction for looting pieces.  Earlier, I gave the rogue<br/>
in my group the ravenscale legs without even doing a random, and she<br/>
wasn&#39;t even someone I knew.  Both Verant and the players on my<br/>
server have made it more of a chore to play than fun.<br/>
<br/>
So good luck everyone finding your armor, hope you live on a more<br/>
civil server than Tunare.<br/>
