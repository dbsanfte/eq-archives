<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808496473">Starting 2 nights ago, my Reclaim Energy stopped working.<br/>
I tried to cast it to get rid of my pet, the spells would fade as they<br/>
normally do when casting, the casting time meter would briefly flicker<br/>
then disappear. <br/>
The spell would never actually cast though.<br/>
No fizzles, no interruptions.<br/>
Last night, i took it out, then hit meditate and tried to re-mem it. It<br/>
said i started to memorize Reclaim Energy, the red bar would drop all<br/>
the way down, but then it would just sit there. It would never finish <br/>
and no icon would show up in my memorized spell section.<br/>
My necro friend tried hers, and it worked fine.<br/>
When i tried this i was in Befallen, i havent tried it outside of there<br/>
yet.<br/>
But i am wondering if anyone else has had this problem.<br/>
<br/>
Regarless, as soon as im on tonight, i&#39;ll be filling out a bug report.<br/>
