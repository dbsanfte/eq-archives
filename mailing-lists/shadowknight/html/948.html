Regarding Feign Death...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems to work pretty well in Guk. I went LD once<br/>
&gt; and came back to my group being gone, a shaman, undead<br/>
&gt; knight and some warrior who was hitting me for 80s. I<br/>
&gt; finally got a Feign off and it worked even with them<br/>
&gt; beating on me. It lasts forever as long as you just<br/>
&gt; lay there. I believe the aggro eventually leaves the<br/>
&gt; MOB, so you can theoretically, get up and walk away<br/>
&gt; after they are out of sight. Try that one at your own<br/>
&gt; risk though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The aggro leaves immediately.  However, if you are<br/>
KOS with teh mob, they will attack again as soon as you stand <br/>
up.  Other mobs though, feign and stand right back up and <br/>
they will ignore you.  Perfect for in-city assassination.<br/>
Kill them fast with HT, feign, and then get up and leave <br/>
like nothing had happened.<br/>
