<div id="ygrps-yiv-316290359">This is gonna be a rant but please read it<br/>
everyone....<br/>
<br/>
Why is it that sks have to be so balanced in there<br/>
spells? Why is it that banshee aura was taken away<br/>
cause it was too good for big races?  Why is it that<br/>
rangers are getting patched lately? Why is it that sks<br/>
are the most underplayed class?  Why do we not have<br/>
lifetap?...etc etc<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand at all why we can&#39;t have a spell<br/>
like banshee aura....it has been said that necros are<br/>
the most powerful magic class because of thier bad<br/>
faction..what do sks have? BAD FACTION!!!! maybe even<br/>
worse than necros! shouldn&#39;t that make shadowknights<br/>
the most powerful hybrid class. even that fact that we<br/>
are part necro should make us more powerful than the<br/>
other hybrids cause necros are supposedly the most<br/>
powerful mage class.  Why would it be so unbalanced<br/>
that we got a really nice spell??? i have gone through<br/>
27 levels of:sitting on my ass waiting to<br/>
heal(warriors have to do this but they don&#39;t take xp<br/>
penalty), getting killed on sight by various npcs,<br/>
being utterly worthless to a group now that darkness<br/>
is canceled by everything, being shitted on by verant,<br/>
and leveling so incredibly slow. would it be that<br/>
unbalanced if we were admittenly more powerful than<br/>
the other hybrids. Shouldn&#39;t we be forces of pure<br/>
darkness and destruction and others run and hide when<br/>
they see us?  I would like to see us get some good god<br/>
damn spells for once and just have verant say &quot;over<br/>
the next few patches shadowknights will be the most<br/>
powerful hybird, because of the sheer difficulty of<br/>
that class they deserve to be powerful&quot; but i doubt<br/>
this will happen because you guys(not you but others<br/>
at verant) say things like HEY LETS PUT NEW RANGER<br/>
WEAPONS IN ON THE TEST SERVER!!! if we were made the<br/>
most powerful class there would be a lot of bitching<br/>
from paladins and rangers but i doubt they would play<br/>
an sks due to the difficulty. I bet if verant just<br/>
came out and said we would be more powerful there<br/>
would be a lot less bitching from paladins and<br/>
rangers.<br/>
<br/>
done ranting <br/>
