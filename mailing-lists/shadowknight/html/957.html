<div id="ygrps-yiv-708467393">Ok something has been bugging me lately. Why is our Bind Wound capped at<br/>
100? I didn&#39;t even thing about this till yesterday when a Monk friend of<br/>
mine happen to use the skill on me. Healed me for over twice what I could<br/>
have done. So I started asking around, hell a mage I group with has a higher<br/>
bind skill then I do. Does anybody know what the other hybrids cap at? I<br/>
would have thought that since the other hybrids get some type of heal they<br/>
would cap lower and we would cap higher (200 would be nice). <br/>
<br/>
Anyway just a thought..</div>
