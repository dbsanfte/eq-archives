&gt; I think the change sucks, from the perspective of a large race. Many<br/>
&gt; dungeons are bugged, cant even walk into sola, get back down the stairs in<br/>
&gt; unrest, etc. This change hurts the large races bad, and came way too late,<br/>
&gt; atfer everyone and the brother done got it. Now large races are dependent on<br/>
&gt; shamans to enter the dungeons. Sucks to depend on 1 class. Maybe they will<br/>
&gt; throw out a shrink type item, course prob require getting a rare pop off a<br/>
&gt; dragon or something. I also feel like all the real cool items are gone.<br/>
&gt; Manastones, guise, jboots, etc. On the older servers so many people already<br/>
&gt; have these, and the ogrew that got there late will have to stand and shout<br/>
&gt; will pay for shrink at the dungeon entrance, while other people just click<br/>
&gt; on there mask. I am sure you smaller race shadowknights like the change<br/>
&gt; though.... Dont see why they waited 9 months to do it....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a DESK, but ready to sign any petition for shrink potions available<br/>
at potion shops at a reasonable price, and/or the inclusion of a<br/>
clickable or wearable shrinking item.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, if size is the problem, there are better ways to fix it then<br/>
turning into a DE.  A wearable all/all ring of shrink (or at least<br/>
BAR,TRL,OGR) would be an ideal solution, but lets just hope they don&#39;t<br/>
make it nodrop and in Sol A =)<br/>
