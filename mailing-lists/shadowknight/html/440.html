<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534309847">hmm.. there IS a way to raise faction enough with the guild that you can<br/>
train there, since you can get there in the first place. human SK cant even<br/>
get past the first guards in grobb ;(<br/>
<br/>
bring 4 bone chips at a time to the main sk guy in grobb, and he will give<br/>
you a rusty 2h sword and some faction. while this may be a slow way for you<br/>
to build money at your level, it DOES give the always-needed faction boosts,<br/>
and eventually you should gain enough that they allow you to train there and<br/>
gain quests.<br/>
