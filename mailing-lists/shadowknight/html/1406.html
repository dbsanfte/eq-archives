<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346725171">I recently created a DE Sk..and have a question about role-playing <br/>
the character. Now she is looked on by most to be evil...yet..would <br/>
she not have a different view of herself?<br/>
<br/>
Would she believe herself, her race, and God are not the evil ones?  <br/>
How can that really be roll-played..and remember this is a total <br/>
newbie to role-playing here. <br/>
<br/>
I have other characters..but seem to find my little Sk the hardest to <br/>
figure out :(<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions? Or any relevant info or guids on the web I can look <br/>
up?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! :)<br/>
