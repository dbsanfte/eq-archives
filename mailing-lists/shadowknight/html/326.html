&gt; actually, i talked to a guy who said that loh could only heal like 600 hp<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; max.. of course, i dont have a paladin char, so somebody else has to<br/>
confirm<br/>
&gt; or deny that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; also, not all of our spells suck compared to paladin spells. please note<br/>
&gt; that paladins have NO ranged damage-dealing attacks whatsoever, except<br/>
&gt; against undead. they have no general nukes, no DOTs, they cant even use<br/>
&gt; archery. which makes it a bit odd that they can root.. hmm. anyway, while<br/>
&gt; they DO have an annoying array of effective spells, a shadowknight can<br/>
&gt; easily take down a paladin if they play a game of keep-away (and resist<br/>
&gt; those annoying blind spells).  in other words, use of shadow step combined<br/>
&gt; with archery and our lovely clinging darkness series of spells will<br/>
royally<br/>
&gt; mess up a paladin. and since they have no ability to detect invis, imagine<br/>
&gt; fights once you get hide.. shadow step, hide, and shoot them in the back<br/>
&gt; once they turn around while looking. its right out of the movies :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; yes, many of our damage dealing spells do kind of suck for our level. but<br/>
&gt; who needs meganukes when you can dish out 70 or 80 damage a combat round<br/>
&gt; with a BBC? just add the little bits our spells add to that and we are<br/>
&gt; already ahead.. just remember to always keep your darkness spells handy<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; keep siphoning every once in a while. i can see why they took away our<br/>
&gt; ability to use banshee aura at lvl 39.. jeez, can you imagine a guy who<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; nail you for 50-60 damage a hit AND you take damage every time you hit<br/>
back?<br/>
&gt; we are supposed to be scary, but that is just mean :) so they replace it<br/>
&gt; with shieldskin, which is at least a well-needed AC boost for us. and<br/>
while<br/>
&gt; taking away boil blood as a lvl 49 spell hurts, i can see the reasoning<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; that too, since we have none of the other blood magic spells. they just<br/>
give<br/>
&gt; us the best of the darkness series in place of it. doesnt DOT as much hp,<br/>
&gt; but it slows em and lasts forever and a day..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and one last advantage: half or more of the sk around are large races,<br/>
while<br/>
&gt; ALL paladins are medium or small. create a newbie ogre sk, and then a<br/>
newbie<br/>
&gt; high elf paladin, and the difference in survivability is noticeable. even<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; newbie barbarian shaman can hold off multiple enemies by himself at lvl 2<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; 3, demonstrating just how buff the large melee-types would be. while the<br/>
&gt; high elf just gets pounded :) also, my guildmaster is a paladin (stop<br/>
&gt; LOOKING at me like that!) and he is constantly complaining about how<br/>
&gt; worthless he is against anything but undead opponents. just take heart,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; if you simply cant survive duels against a paladin of your same level,<br/>
take<br/>
&gt; some time out, put on a few levels, and perfect your dueling strategy.<br/>
trust<br/>
&gt; me, you will come out on top ;)<br/>
