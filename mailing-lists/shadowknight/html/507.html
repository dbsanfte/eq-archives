&gt; Speaking of quests, some may wish to try the Helm of Hukulk quest which<br/>
&gt; begings in Grobb by talking to the SK guildmaster, Hukulk.<br/>
&gt; This helm raises STR and AGI by 3, and is only wearable by the evil races<br/>
&gt; (sorry humans you miss out on this one).<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a Dark Elf SK and I managed to get the helm, so let me tell you that<br/>
&gt; this quest is very worth completing.<br/>
&gt; If you can&#39;t figure it out you can always hit EQ&#39;Lizer too hehe.<br/>
&gt; (it does require you to be about level 20 tho)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The bashers of Grobb glower at me, even though I&#39;ve done nothing to<br/>
lower my initial faction with them.  I seem to remeber last time<br/>
I hit the bank in Grobb that someone was glaring or scowling at me,<br/>
but I might have been mistaken.  Are the SK&#39;s there friendly to our kind<br/>
by default, or must I raise my faction somehow?<br/>

Actually I wasn&#39;t able to complete it as a dark elf, I gave the items you<br/>
need to give to Hukulk to a friend and created a Troll SK mule, which my<br/>
friend gave the items to, then as the mule I gave the itmes to Hukulk to get<br/>
the helm.<br/>
Had the friend give the helm to me and boom there&#39;s me with the helm =)<br/>
