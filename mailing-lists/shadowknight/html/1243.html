<div id="ygrps-yiv-912018201">Sure, the new FD change makes feign pulling harder, but at least now it&#39;s<br/>
more predictable. Regardless of what it was in the past, we know what it is<br/>
NOW because they actually gave us the probabilities in the patch message.<br/>
You now KNOW that mobs have a 67% of remembering you each time you FD, and<br/>
that reduces as you keep feigning. And then there is a 90% chance of them<br/>
forgetting once they get back to their spot, as Verant calls &quot;going home.&quot;<br/>
THAT is key.<br/>
<br/>
Now for some advice: Feign pulling is harder, but now more predictable, so<br/>
instead of complaining about it, USE THE INFO THEY HAVE GIVEN US. Ok, it&#39;s<br/>
not the SAME, but it&#39;s still USEFUL. Like I said, the key is letting the<br/>
other mobs go home. That is when you get your 90% forget rate. You can&#39;t<br/>
just go by line-of-sight anymore. Now the easiest way to make sure your<br/>
target stays while the rest go home is some kind of snare/darkness spell.<br/>
This is how I do it (as an SK) -- darkness the mob you want, run some SHORT<br/>
distance (around a first corner usually), WAIT till ALL of the mobs get on<br/>
you, THEN cast feign death. Within a few seconds, the mobs start to head<br/>
back, BUT the one I put darkness on is slower than the rest. This means,<br/>
once I see the other guys get home, I repull my target. And 90% of the time,<br/>
only he will come. And I KNOW this because of the numbers Verant provided us<br/>
with. Yes, this IS harder than the old way of just letting the others get<br/>
out of sight, but feign pulls DO still work. I can&#39;t understand<br/>
monks/SKs/Necros saying they&#39;ll never use the skill again, that&#39;s just<br/>
absurd.<br/>
<br/>
And another thing, use dead man pulls. A dead man pull is this: The primary<br/>
puller goes out like normal, hits/darks a mob, runs back near the party (but<br/>
not within line-of-sight or aggro range of the group) and feigns. Then a<br/>
secondary puller will wait, and when the primary would normally stand up and<br/>
return with their pull, the secondary hits/darks the remaining mob. The<br/>
secondary takes that single back to the party, and the primary remains<br/>
feigned. This can be extended as necessary (i.e. double or even triple dead<br/>
mans). Using the dead man pull technique does reduce a lot of the FD stress.<br/>
It can be used for lower guk king room, lord room, sol B fire giants, etc.<br/>
Even in PoH, we used a double dead man.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: Feign pulling is not dead, it is merely harder, but at the same<br/>
time more predictable. Stop complaining and just learn how to use the new<br/>
method effectively (and yes, I know it ain&#39;t easy).<br/>
