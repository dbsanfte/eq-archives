<div id="ygrps-yiv-568123407">I love the availability of Evil races and class&#39;s.  I like the fact that<br/>
there are only a few places for us to run and hide.  It will make or<br/>
victory that much sweeter.  And when I am sitting on the Throne...in the<br/>
city of Felwithe....Innoruuk himself will come down and cast the land back<br/>
into darkness.  ::wow:: that was weird.  I was taken over for a<br/>
second::snickers::  <br/>
<br/>
My one problem with playing an evil race or class is I(Dark Elf/SK) have<br/>
been killed before and seen Necro&#39;s killed just for being necro&#39;s.  While<br/>
I understand that people will hate certain class&#39;s, but what I don&#39;t<br/>
understand is how they can tell you are a Necro or SK.  An SK looks just<br/>
like a warrior...a Necro looks just like any other magic class...so people<br/>
that are class prejudice shoudln&#39;t be able to tell one way or another(IF<br/>
YOU DON&quot;T HAVE A PET OBVIOUSLY).  It just annoy&#39;s me that he can tell I&#39;m<br/>
a SK and not possibly a warrior or something along those lines.<br/>
