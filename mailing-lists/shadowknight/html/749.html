<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018666417"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; And personally, it has always been my idea that an SK feeds off the life<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Except that this would mean again that lifetaps are reserved mostly for<br/>
soloing SK&#39;s. A non-soloing SK would most likely be down in a dungeon where<br/>
there are no puny gnolls or orcs to suck the life out of.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as I stated before, assuming that the lifetaps follow previous<br/>
patterns, the amount of life that they would tap would likely be so small<br/>
that the time spent finding a creature, casting on it and then the extra med<br/>
time for the mana would probably be as much time as it would have taken to<br/>
heal that much health while sitting on your bum. Especially for trolls<br/>
(which I am not) with regeneration.<br/>
