&gt; Hhehe, that sounds great!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Didn&#39;t those newbies realise you were evil?  Ah well, now I just need to do<br/>
&gt; the long trek through Rathe and Karanas as I&#39;m still KOS in High Hold.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I spent levels 14-19 in mainly Befallen and High Pass, and one of <br/>
the finest days in my SK career was the first time I could sell.  I&#39;m<br/>
all for being evil, but I think the citizens of Highpass are better<br/>
used thinking I&#39;m a friend =)  I can&#39;t stand running around the <br/>
south route.  <br/>

Just mem disease or siphon str and cast on everything you see spawn,<br/>
or ask teh groups there, and shoot an arrow or take a swing, and<br/>
you&#39;ll get the faction in no time.<br/>
