&gt; I have noticed recently that faction messages are coming up that dont<br/>
&gt; tell you who your faction has changed with.<br/>
&gt; &quot;You faction with has gotten worse&quot;, or some such.<br/>
&gt; Thats it, doesnt say who with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I cant say for sure, but i have a DE friend who is now on not so good<br/>
&gt; terms with the wandering Dragoons, since he started to go to Befallen.<br/>
&gt; And i also have another DE friend who needs to cast invis to undead to<br/>
&gt; get past the ghouls who guard the door to the guild in Neriak since<br/>
&gt; hunting befallen. Once inside, apparently, theres no prob, but the<br/>
&gt; ghouls seem to take offense for some reason.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Though on the Dragoon part, i know that one of them is associated with<br/>
&gt; Skelton Lrodd, so killing him may lower faction with that particular<br/>
&gt; Dragoon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It does seem that the Befallen inhabitants do indeed affect, at least<br/>
&gt; somewhat, the faction in Neriak.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Guess theres no real way to know though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we don&#39;t know, but I have read on some web board that you take<br/>
faction hits for &#39;the dead&#39;. and the ghouls that guard the sk/necro guild<br/>
in neriak are that faction. The dark elves inside are something else.<br/>
perhaps you can do some of the quests given by the 3rd floor necro to<br/>
offset befallen hits, this is what I will try to do</div>
