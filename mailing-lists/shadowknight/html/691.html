<div id="ygrps-yiv-926586234">I don&#39;t think you were the only one, Cronik.  They were still patching last<br/>
night on our server when I finally gave up and got some much needed sleep.<br/>
I&#39;m sure the servers that weren&#39;t being actively patched were experiencing<br/>
lag due to that.<br/>

BTW, the spellcasting madmen con ridiculously low for their level.  Green<br/>
ones used to easily take out my 17th level ranger if he wasn&#39;t SOW&#39;ed.  The<br/>
non-casters are much easier.<br/>

:)I lagged so bad last night it took me an hour to get <br/>
:)from Oasis to Neriak to invite someone into the guild! <br/>
:)By the time I got there they had logged off.<br/>
:)<br/>
:)If Verant or Cerfnet or who ever just made an upgrade to <br/>
:)the hardware, why is there so much lag?  It seems to be <br/>
:)getting worse, not better with each &quot;upgrade&quot;.  I am not <br/>
:)a hardware tech, but can someone tell me why?  I used <br/>
:)the UOTracer program that pings every server your <br/>
:)connection uses to connect to EQ, and all are ok until I <br/>
:)get to the EQ servers.<br/>
:)Even people I know with cable modems were lagging last <br/>
:)night. <br/>
:)<br/>
:)Ok, that is enough for now, but more will be coming. :)<br/>
