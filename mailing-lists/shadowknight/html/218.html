<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011265043">I was talking with a few friends who all play everquest...and we think we<br/>
came up with a pretty good idea....instead of HT just damaging someone or<br/>
something...why not do the damage...and send us the amount of HP it<br/>
drains.  That way we can do damage..and a good amount...and heal at the<br/>
same time.  Why not have it so it heals as much as it drains.  It wil make<br/>
up for the lack of healing or HP giving spells we get and do the damage.<br/>
Also make it less resistable too.<br/>
