<b>Subject:</b> Guild on Cazic-Thule <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-640051441">There is a guild forming on the Cazic-Thule server consisting primarily<br/>
of (but not limited to) Shadow Knights and Necromancers.<br/>
All SKs and Necros will be considered.<br/>
All evil races will be considered, regardless of class.<br/>
And in certain instances, other race/classes may be considered if the<br/>
character is roleplayed evil.<br/>
As im sure you have guessed, it is evil aligned.<br/>
<br/>
The name at this point cant be given out until it has been accepted by<br/>
989.<br/>
<br/>
The very basics of our charter:<br/>
<br/>
Our Lord Bertoxxulous is gaining strength, preparing to return to<br/>
Norrath with a terrible vengeance, and send the wretched Lighbringers<br/>
into eternal Darkness.<br/>
Our mission is to bring war upon the Lightbringers, feed their corpses<br/>
to our Lord, and cast a Shadow upon Norrath, creating a gateway for our<br/>
Lord to pass through.<br/>
<br/>
Now our real life goal:<br/>
Basically we just want a good group of people who like to roleplay, go<br/>
out and kill stuff and have fun.<br/>
We do plan on eventually doing guildwars, hopefully leach some dynamic<br/>
quests out of Verant and once we get settled (starting a guild is<br/>
actually quite a bit of work) give quests to fellow guild members with<br/>
some good and/or interesting rewards. (of course these will have to be<br/>
obtained first, but we&#39;ll be working on it).<br/>
<br/>
More info will be available after we are official. But if any are<br/>
interested at this point, feel free to email me, i will contact you and<br/>
give any info i currently have.<br/>
