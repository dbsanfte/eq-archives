<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-431608664">What a weekend! I went from 6th to 9th level! Hot dam!<br/>
I left Grobb and Innothule Swamp at 6th level and went <br/>
to Neriak. Shortly after I got there, I went to the <br/>
troll armor merchant and bought a full set of leather <br/>
armor.  <br/>
After zoning to the forrest I still had my full set of <br/>
netted armor and a couple of woven items that I didn&#39;t <br/>
sell.  I was in a really good mood so I ramdomly chose a <br/>
DE necro and without a word gave her all the netted I <br/>
had.  She came back with a &quot;Why me? What do I owe you?&quot; <br/>
I just said no reason, I know casters need all the help <br/>
they can get.  She thanked me profusely and said my <br/>
kindness would someday be repaid.  I chuckled and said <br/>
to help out others when able, and that would be enough. <br/>
I left to stomp skele into powder and thought nothing of <br/>
it.  I made 7th that night.<br/>
The next day when I got on I got a tell from the Necro <br/>
above asking to group. ? /who.  She made 6th from <br/>
&lt;insert level here&gt;. Kewl. I said sure.  We then <br/>
proceeded to stomp skele and young kody all over <br/>
Necktulos(?) Forrest through 3/4 of my level 8 for <br/>
Saturday and Sunday.  <br/>
Just as I /shout &quot;Level 9! Hot dam!&quot; I get a tell from <br/>
someone asking me to come to the EC side of the zone <br/>
border. Out of curiosity I went.  I had been saving many <br/>
DE a$$ since I got there, so what the heck. <br/>
After I zone, I get a hail and my trade window pops up. <br/>
?   Then I see a FS2H sword and 8pp appear. I hit trade. <br/>
I had been using a rusty Halberd for a while. This was <br/>
awesome! I had been looking for a FS2H weapon all <br/>
weekend, but they were going for 15-20pp which I did not <br/>
have after buying my armor :(.  The Highelf Wizard who <br/>
gave me the stuff said the DE Necro I helped called in a <br/>
favor to him and to use my new weapon wisely.  <br/>
Two hours later I get a message from the female <br/>
necro.  &quot;Someone come visit you?&quot;  Yes.  &quot;Good. I hope <br/>
they treated you well.&quot;  Hell yes they did!  <br/>
<br/>
New Thread<br/>
I was in Neriak when I hit 9th, and the DE guild would <br/>
not train me cause I play a troll. grrr.  I went back to <br/>
Grobb and trained my magic abilities and my 1H Slash to <br/>
keep it up a bit.  Then I bought all the 1st Rank <br/>
spells. All righty then! kewl.  I zone to the swamp and <br/>
cast my first pet. NOT!!!! <br/>
&quot;Insufficiant mana to cast this spell.&quot; WTF!!! Try <br/>
again. Same thing. Mana cost: 40.  Hmmm.  Dam.  No big <br/>
deal really. Me not use one before. Is ok. <br/>
Next spell.  <br/>
Invis to Undead. &quot;Insufficiant mana to cast this spell.&quot; <br/>
Crap! Mana cost: 40. <br/>
Great. The spell that makes a SK visible as a SK (pet) I <br/>
am too stupid (Int of 62) to cast!  And the spell that <br/>
will keep annoying green skele from attacking me I can&#39;t <br/>
cast either.  <br/>
Using a mana calculator from the net I found out I have <br/>
a 14 mana pool. Increasing Int by 2 points I think was a <br/>
waste of points.   Why? Using a mana calculator this is <br/>
what I found out.<br/>
Level   Int:60 Int:70 Int:80<br/>
9       14     16     18<br/>
10      28     32     36<br/>
11      42     48     54<br/>
16      112    128    144<br/>
22      196    224    252<br/>
24      224    256    288<br/>
<br/>
You get 1 point more base mana for every 5 points you <br/>
increase Int by.  Each level you add the base mana to <br/>
your curret total.  So, my advice to you all is not to <br/>
buy Int only items.  Get Int (+5 minimum if you didn&#39;t <br/>
increase int at the start) AND mana increasing items. <br/>
Jaded Electrum Bracers: Mana +10, HP +10 and AC +2 each <br/>
bracer.  Keep them on you but not equiped when battling <br/>
as you need the AC more. Equip them only when casting.  <br/>
Unless the AC reduction doesn&#39;t bother you.  :)<br/>
I do not know what other types of items are out there <br/>
that can help mana pool and not lose AC.<br/>
Anyone on this list that does please let me know. :)<br/>
