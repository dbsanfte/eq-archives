<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273556300">want to raise MM faction REAL fast? do this: kill the real princess lenya in<br/>
highkeep. the faction adjustment is humongous; after killing her only one<br/>
time, the faction seems to have maxed out (the second time i killed her, i<br/>
got no faction hit other than king tearis thex of felwithe). of course, the<br/>
equivalent high elf faction adjustments are equally large, but what do we<br/>
care about high elves anyway? :) i have yet to make a quick visit to<br/>
mistmoore to consider things, but i&#39;ll let you know what happens. oh,<br/>
becareful with lenya tho: when i attacked her, she immediately charmed me<br/>
(she cons green to me, how did she do dat?) and raced downstairs where she<br/>
raised havoc among the pickclaw killers. if you let her get loose too often,<br/>
you may build up a bad reputation with other players ;) summon up a pet:<br/>
even tho you will lose it when you get charmed, lenya wont run downstairs if<br/>
there is still something upstairs to attack.<br/>
<br/>
by the way, did you know xicotl of mistmoore was a founding member of the<br/>
dismal rage of freeport? maybe he is an sk trainer.. or maybe he even gives<br/>
out a quest. hmm<br/>
