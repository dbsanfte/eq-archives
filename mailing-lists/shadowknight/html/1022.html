<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301127494">Spent 12 hours camping yesterday. 11am to 11pm.<br/>
<br/>
Other than our lack of success, had a blast. 3-5 SK&#39;s, lvls 30 (me!) to 42.<br/>
One cleric. Up to five dark reavers at a time. Wow. What we lacked in nuking<br/>
power we DEFINITELY made up for in staying power. We had some battles last<br/>
upwards of 15 minutes, nonstop. We just hacked and slashed and slashed some<br/>
more. Our poor cleric. We just recruited her out of the blue. She was<br/>
japanese and hardly spoke english at all, but DAMN was she a good cleric.<br/>
One of the better I have ever ever had the pleasure of being healed by.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, though, we got .....<br/>
<br/>
a decayed right glove.<br/>
<br/>
And that was at about 10pm when the first SK was there waiting for the rest<br/>
of us. During our 12 hours stint we actually got nothing.<br/>
<br/>
And for those of you that haven&#39;t fought crusaders. My GOD are they tough.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me this: Why is it that NPC SK&#39;s are just AWESOME (Lord Grimrot,<br/>
Hollish Tnoops, now Crusaders) but PC SK&#39;s suck so bad? Explain that to me.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well. I&#39;m glad to see this list be so active lately. And we&#39;ve all be<br/>
sharing info and helping each other out. The one positive that has come out<br/>
of this quest nonsense for me, at least, is that all the SK&#39;s (the like 15<br/>
of us) on Solusek Ro are banding together to work with each other and help<br/>
each other out. We&#39;ve always all been friends, but to see us all working<br/>
together instead of trying to one-up each other like I see the Paladins and<br/>
rangers etc doing, well, brings a tear to my evil eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck everyone! Someone get at least ONE piece out there, and let us<br/>
know, so we have a little hope!! (and if it is pink, is 3 ac, and -10 str,<br/>
dex, agil, and -50 all saves, please keep it to yourself. Thanks. ;D)<br/>
