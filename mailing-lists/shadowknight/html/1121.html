<div id="ygrps-yiv-480766369">I just got the boots 2 nights ago and it is NO DROP.<br/>
I have asked other friends if theres is still NO DROP,<br/>
and the answers are still yes.<br/>
Why the Helm would be an exception is beyond me. But i<br/>
would rather this fact didnt srpread :)<br/>
Like you i fully support the NO DROP decision<br/>

&gt; Drop. So is it just this piece that doesn&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt; No Drop restriction or<br/>
&gt; have they removed it from all pieces?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My personal opinion is that I would want all the<br/>
&gt; pieces No Drop, that way we<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have other classes harvesting the armor and<br/>
&gt; also it&#39;s kind of like a<br/>
&gt; status symbol (You had to do the quest to get it).<br/>
&gt; Of course as of yet I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t got any of the new armor (the whole camping<br/>
&gt; Cazic thing doesn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; me too excited)..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enjoy...<br/>
