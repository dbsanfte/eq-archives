<div id="ygrps-yiv-336925201">Does anyone have one of these.<br/>
Or better yet, am I quoting the wrong name.<br/>
Its a 1h slasher found in Plane of Hate.<br/>
I am not sure, I KNOW there is a DE/HU 1h slasher there, just not sure what/who has it.<br/>
I thought maybe Ashenbone Drakes, but I have also heard Innoruuk. Killed like 12 drakes and 1 god so far, not seen one.  Just trying to home on it, so if you hear something let me know.  Btw the shield I received in there is ac 25 (adds 40), 5 STA and 100 hps.  Looks like a modifided cracked darkwood. I will post SS tomorrow.  Thanks guys and any info would help.<br/>
