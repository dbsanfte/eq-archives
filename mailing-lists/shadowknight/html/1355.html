<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Just got the new digest, and saw you had reached 50 
&#39;at last&#39;, Beld, CONGRATS!!&nbsp; I can only imagine what&nbsp;it will be like 
to be 50th level, hehe, almost to 21st myself.&nbsp; Starting to feel like my 
character is starting to come into his own, and being worthwhile to play, cannot 
wait until I get the 22nd level spells, really looking forward to Vampiric 
Embrace and Engulfing Darkness.&nbsp; BTW, for those who are new to the list, 
and have not read Beld&#39;s article on how to use Harm Touch, I highly recommend 
it.&nbsp; To find it, go to <a rel="nofollow"

watch, guides.</font></div>
