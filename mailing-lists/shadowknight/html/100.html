<b>Subject:</b> Kill Paladin Quest in Qeynos <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057490327">I received a Kill Paladin quest from a SK Guild Master in the Shrine of<br/>
Bertoxxulous in Qeynos.<br/>
Now we are supposed to kill the Paladins that run the path in W.<br/>
Karanas and turn in either their Prayer Beads or House of Thunder<br/>
Amulets.<br/>
Now the first thing i did was kill Brother Trintle who hangs out by a<br/>
tree in W. Karanas. When I turned in his beads, I got exp, and was then<br/>
promptly killed by that same GM. This is when I learned that poor<br/>
Brother Trintle was a mole for our organization inside the Temple of<br/>
Life.<br/>
OK<br/>
Now, next time we were out there, we saw 2 guys beating up on Trintle.<br/>
We killed the 2 that were trying to kill him. I tried talking to<br/>
Trintle afterward and he still babbled about Rodcet Nife.<br/>
I took one of the Prayer Beads to the GM, and he said &quot;Thank You&quot;.<br/>
Thats all. :(<br/>
<br/>
I then killed one of the Paladins actually running, and he didnt drop<br/>
any Beads or Amulets.<br/>
<br/>
My question is, has anyone successfully completed this quest, and who<br/>
did you have to kill?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
