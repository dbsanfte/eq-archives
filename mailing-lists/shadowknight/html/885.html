<div id="ygrps-yiv-199010987">I found another way to increase faction with &quot;the dead&quot; for those that care.<br/>
<br/>
Enroute to Unrest in Cauldron, there&#39;s a camp of goodie tooshoes.  Polish <br/>
them off and you&#39;re on your way to making &quot;the dead&quot; very happy.  On a side <br/>
note, other people are going to hate you.</div>
