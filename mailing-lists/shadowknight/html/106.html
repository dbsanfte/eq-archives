<br/>
Ive done the exact same thing. Including poor Brother Trintle.<br/>
I believe the other 2 NPCs that hangout by that same tree arent part of<br/>
the quest. I too have turned in their beads and received nothing.<br/>
As far as I know its the NPCs that you always see running on that path.<br/>
Ive only killed one of them, and no beads or amulets were dropped.<br/>
I havent gotten around to trying it again, though. <br/>
And you can bet that doing this quest will drop your faction with the<br/>
guards, temple of life and house of thunder. This is the only reason i<br/>
havent kept trying it. Ive done alot of naughty things, and life was<br/>
getting complicated in Qeynos, so i had to lay off that quest for a<br/>
bit.<br/>
As soon as i get around to trying it again though, i&#39;ll post what<br/>
happens.<br/>
