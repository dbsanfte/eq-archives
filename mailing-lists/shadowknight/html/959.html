I&#39;m under the impression that everyone other then monks was capped at 100.  <br/>
My wizard is capped at 100 and so is my SK.  Only person that I met with a <br/>
higher bandage skill was a Monk..............<br/>

&gt;Ok something has been bugging me lately. Why is our Bind Wound capped at<br/>
&gt;100? I didn&#39;t even thing about this till yesterday when a Monk friend of<br/>
&gt;mine happen to use the skill on me. Healed me for over twice what I could<br/>
&gt;have done. So I started asking around, hell a mage I group with has a <br/>
&gt;higher<br/>
&gt;bind skill then I do. Does anybody know what the other hybrids cap at? I<br/>
&gt;would have thought that since the other hybrids get some type of heal they<br/>
&gt;would cap lower and we would cap higher (200 would be nice).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway just a thought..<br/>
