<div id="ygrps-yiv-950161224">Sir Lucan is in the top floor of the Militia baracks <br/>
(the first building you see as you enter West Gate from <br/>
the Commonlands, in a room by himself.<br/>
<br/>
The person you are to meet/kill is the Shield Merchant <br/>
in the last hut in West Commons. This guy also wanders <br/>
around that part of the zone. If I remember correctly <br/>
that is.  I was part of a Paladin Holy Sword mailing <br/>
list and it involved going to find someone in WC to give <br/>
them a note.  They in turn gave you a note to return to <br/>
someone else.  I think this also involved turning around <br/>
very quickly and following someone that spawned behind <br/>
you, and killing them.<br/>
<br/>
The paladin half came down to:<br/>
Getting a note from the Marr Temple, giving it to the <br/>
Shield Merchant in WC to warn him about something, <br/>
getting a note to return to someone else, killing the <br/>
above NPC that spawns, taking his head or another <br/>
something from him back to the Temple.<br/>
This is quick and dirty, and may also have changed <br/>
somewhat.  To find out for sure, go to the Paladin list <br/>
archives on Onelist for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Holyswords@onelist.com">Holyswords@onelist.com</a> (may want <br/>
to search for that as the name of the list is fuzzy) and <br/>
scan through it.  It may take a bit, but it is worth a <br/>
try if you really, really, really want answers. :)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you out.  It has been a while since I <br/>
actually did anything Paladin related so things may have <br/>
changed. Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Which part of Freeport is Sir Lucan in?  I can travel freely in North<br/>
