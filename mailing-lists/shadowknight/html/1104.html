<div id="ygrps-yiv-506490447">Take away all magic items, and I believe you will find no real significant<br/>
difference. The small difference that is there can easily be made up for<br/>
with magic items.  I think the difference in damage will be insignificant as<br/>
well. (i.e. 2 level 40 SK, one ogre, one De.  Both naked except for a BIBS)<br/>
I think there will be little difference in both hitpoints and damage. If<br/>
there is a small difference, it can be made up for via items. DE with more<br/>
+str items, while the ogre more +agi items.<br/>
Have no real statistics though, anyone else?<br/>

Big races do get the Slam deal, but not sure if that trades off with the<br/>
xtra KOS and dependancy on a shaman for shrink.<br/>

&gt; Since I&#39;ve never played a troll or an Ogre how many more Hps do they have<br/>
&gt; compared to a DE or Human? Anybody happen to know?<br/>
