<b>Subject:</b> new lead on groflah quest in freeport.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-640944314">as part of the paladin quest for the soulfire sword, groflah appears at<br/>
&quot;a certain tavern&quot; in east freeport during early morning hours, around 5<br/>
or 6 am gametime. i do not know what this &quot;certain tavern&quot; is (and pray<br/>
that it is not the seafarer&#39;s wharf!) but if this is the case, this MAY<br/>
be where groflah needs to be killed to get his note. as you may know,<br/>
killing him in north freeport is futile, because he is a merchant.<br/>
consequently, groflah may not even appear in east freeport at all unless<br/>
somebody has activated his part of the soulfire quest. if so, this would<br/>
be an sk quest requiring the assistance of a paladin to carry it off.<br/>
very odd....<br/>
<br/>
so folks, keep an eye out in east freeport taverns in early morning game<br/>
hours.. and if you see groflah show up, take his dwarven butt out!! and<br/>
let the rest of us know what happens :)<br/>
