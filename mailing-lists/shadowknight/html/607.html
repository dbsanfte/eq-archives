<b>Subject:</b> Why Neriak? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-145445285">&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Sounds like you&#39;re playing your Troll like a Dark Elf or <br/>
a Human. Unless you have friends, why would you want to <br/>
hunt in Nektulous instead of Innothule swamp? <br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
I migrated simply because I wanted to group with my wife <br/>
when she created her Dark Elf Necro.  I got bound inside <br/>
Neriak, and then she didn&#39;t like her necro and went back <br/>
to her Woodelf Bard.  I was 6th when I migrated and <br/>
nearly died in the process in a nasty spot in Oasis. <br/>
Someone with an unmeasureable IQ was training Spectres <br/>
all over the zone hoping someone would save them and <br/>
killing alot of people in the process. So I decided to <br/>
stick around Neriak until I felt comfortable that even <br/>
if attacked in Oasis that I could make the zone.<br/>
I liked the Innuthule Swamp and am heading back there <br/>
for that reason.  I want to go to Faydwer because of the <br/>
loot possibilities that I have seen with my own eyes. <br/>
The minos in Steamfont looks like a fun place.  Guk <br/>
looks promising, but I may lag too bad to make it worth <br/>
my while. We shall see. I am making a run tonight back <br/>
to the swamp so I can train.<br/>
I am interested in OOT because of the Grobb Cleaver <br/>
Quest, but do not want to get into OOT and find out that <br/>
the Troll I need to kill is level 25 and I&#39;m only 10th.<br/>
I also plan on completing the Mushroom Head quest for <br/>
the Froglock skin mask.  Any clue what level that MOB is?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
