&gt; What about the Planes 1HS weapons? Also, as a DE, I will lose bash unless I<br/>
&gt; have a shield, not to mention alot of AC.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Abbasi is not a bad weapon, 9/25 + stats.  But it is only<br/>
marginally better than a Ykesha, and has no proc.  Dex will make your<br/>
vampiric embrace go off a little more, but I wouldn&#39;t worry about Dex<br/>
much at all unless you have a Ykesha or Soul Leech (dunno about the<br/>
Drinker of Blood from Sky), and definately don&#39;t sacrifice AC for<br/>
dex in any case.<br/>

If you can get it, Bloodmoon is the ultimate small race SK weapon,<br/>
and currently is arguably the best weapon in the game.  It is 18/28<br/>
one handed, but dropped off Innoruuk.<br/>
<br/>
As a small race, you should always carry 1H/shield in addition to<br/>
a 2H weapon if you choose to use 2H most of the time.  At levels 45+<br/>
you should use an EBW/Ykesha/Abbassi (Of course bloodmoon if you get <br/>
it) instead of a Dark Reaver, and only use 2H if you have a Razing<br/>
Sword, Soul Leech, or a Mithril 2H.<br/>
