&gt; i have learned that (at least in the beta) the darkreavers are located in<br/>
&gt; lower guk. however, knowing the hell you have to go thru in lower guk to<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; the paladin&#39;s ghoulsbane weapon, i imagine that you&#39;d need a lvl 30-35<br/>
party<br/>
&gt; to obtain one. i&#39;ve also heard that black plate armor that MAY or MAY NOT<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; sk-only was also found in lower guk during beta. wether or not any of this<br/>
&gt; is still there i can&#39;t say, but it&#39;s worth checking out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; also... from what we know, the darkreaver has an attack of 20. the fiery<br/>
&gt; avenger, the paladin&#39;s best weapon, has by all accounts an attack of 35,<br/>
&gt; besides casting lava bolt. this implies to me that the darkreaver is NOT<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; most powerful holy sword. if nobody knows the location of our lvl 50<br/>
weapon,<br/>
&gt; it is probably because nobody has ever played their SK up to lvl 50<br/>
before..<br/>
&gt; so keep running quests, report ones that dont work, and keep an eye out<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; rumors of powerful equipment ;)<br/>
