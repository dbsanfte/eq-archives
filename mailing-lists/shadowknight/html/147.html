<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068867930">with all of the people running around that look more or less the same, i<br/>
think it is very useful to our rp personas for us to stand out from the<br/>
crowd somehow.. right now, with facial features limited, the best way to do<br/>
that is with unique armor. i know of several types of armor that are colored<br/>
versions of the standard armor type.. i&#39;ve seen both red and black chain<br/>
type armors, as well as bronze, rubicite, black iron, splinted green, and<br/>
even blue plate armor. so i&#39;m asking around to see if anybody knows the<br/>
locations and or stats on any armor that is noticeably different from your<br/>
standard fare.. especially if it isnt &quot;THE best&quot; armor, which would make it<br/>
less likely others would wear it :) after all, why would a shadow knight run<br/>
around in shiny steel armor when he could wear plate that is blacker than<br/>
night..<br/>
