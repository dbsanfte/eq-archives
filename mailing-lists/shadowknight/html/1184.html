<b>Subject:</b> Human SK god and stats? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-698072703">I&#39;ve have 2 TSK characters, but have tired of both because of the crushing EXP penalty, so I though I&#39;d try out a human SK.  A few questions:<br/>
<br/>
1)  What is the best god for HSK?  Innoruuk or Bertox?  Which cities can each enter safely without having to kill anything?  I&#39;m assuming the human cities plus High Hold for both, plus Neriak for Innoruuk SK&#39;s.  Can either safely enter a city on either Faydwer or Erudin?<br/>
<br/>
2)  Starting stats.  I was thinking +5 Str and + 15 AGI to set each to 90.  Any thoughts on what a good Str value is.  Should I bump it to 100.  How heavy is medium armor?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input.<br/>
