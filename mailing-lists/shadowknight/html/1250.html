<br/>
Ok first of all, had a very productive weekend, my guild and I held the Frog<br/>
King room for most of Sunday. Damn that little froggie is tough, once you<br/>
break the spawn up though it gets fairly easy. Picked up the crown on the<br/>
first spawn, but he only spawned one more time in an 8 hour period (another<br/>
crown) so I didn&#39;t get the Mith 2h I was hoping on. Oh well there is always<br/>
next weekend. Oh while I was in Guk I finally picked up a Serp Bracer, and<br/>
now I can&#39;t decide if I would rather do the Ac route or higher AGI/DEX. Any<br/>
thoughts on this one? (BTW as of now with one Serp Bracer my DEX is 120 and<br/>
AGI is 117 AC is hovering around 700)..<br/>
<br/>
Ok now for the main question, I still have a little ways to go until lvl 50<br/>
and the Life Leech quest, but I wanted to get a start on it early. Do you<br/>
all think it would be better for me to have a lvl 50 guild mate pick up all<br/>
the items needed for the quest (he would go along with me, not do it for me)<br/>
or should I still get all the pieces myself and just wait till 50 to turn<br/>
them in?<br/>
<br/>
Oh one last thing, anybody know why the Live side of Guk doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
have nearly as many people on it as the dead side. Over this weekend Guk was<br/>
hovering around 80 ppl and the dead side was packed (you could literally<br/>
walk around without fear of getting attack), but there was virtually no body<br/>
on the live side (Noble I think was the only mob camped).. <br/>
<br/>
Other than that, enjoy folks...<br/>
<br/>
