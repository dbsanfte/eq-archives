<div id="ygrps-yiv-224271216">You do indeed need both a right and left bracer. We<br/>
got both last night. You also need a left and right<br/>
boot.<br/>
Every piece does have 2 parts to it.<br/>
Pay attention to the Greave pieces though. They look<br/>
like arms.<br/>
<br/>
An additional note. WWe happen to be grouped with the<br/>
first level 50 SK on our server, Kagal (a Troll) and<br/>
as far as i know still the only one and has been for a<br/>
while. Anyway..he got both parts to the Breastplate.<br/>
He went off to Mistmoore to ckaim his prize. Not that<br/>
he needed it, he has PoF BP. But any he messaged us<br/>
with the stats.<br/>
<br/>
18AC<br/>
10 STA (i think)<br/>
3 SV MAgic<br/>
<br/>
Looks like the BE chest<br/>
<br/>
Thats it folks. Nothing all that spectacular. Andi its<br/>
NO DROP. So no giving it to your friends.<br/>
<br/>
Thats the only piec4e i have seen or heard of<br/>
completed.<br/>
We have the parts to the Bracers, but need the Mino<br/>
Shackles..thats our next adventure. I&#39;ll try to get<br/>
screenshots of all that we complete for you folks.<br/>

&gt; &gt; my guess is that every piece of darkforge armor<br/>
&gt; requires 2 pieces of<br/>
&gt; &gt; decayed: either a left and a right, or in the case<br/>
&gt; of the helm and bp, two<br/>
&gt; &gt; different decayed pieces of that slot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve come to this conclusion as well, but am<br/>
&gt; wondering about the<br/>
&gt; bracers?<br/>
&gt; It wouldn&#39;t make sense for them, has anyone found a<br/>
&gt; bracer piece, and<br/>
&gt; if so was it a bracer, or a left/right bracer?<br/>
