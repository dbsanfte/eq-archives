<div id="ygrps-yiv-150554324">Over this past weekend, I managed to buy an almost full set of bronze armor.<br/>
I was very happy. However the big find I made had me rolling on the floor. I<br/>
was in Rathe Mountains selling at the gypsie camp when for the hell of it I<br/>
started looking at what she had to sell. The very last item in her list was<br/>
a Silvery War Axe (1HS, 6/22, magic: buy from a player for 250 pp). With 104<br/>
charisma, she sold it for under 6 pp!  I was so excited that I accidentally<br/>
bought a FS Scimitar for 56pp! Even though I wasted 51pp, I still made out<br/>
like a bandit. That reminds me. Why is a Combine Scimi 14pp less than a FS<br/>
Scimi? It makes no sense, neither does the axe being less than a Kite<br/>
shield. Oh well. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not quite ready to start playing Lasombra yet, need to double check<br/>
where I put my starting points. I may need to recreate him based on the<br/>
advise you have given me. The time is close though, I am getting tired of<br/>
not being able to melee as well as I would like. I lost and regained 26th<br/>
level 4 times in one day this weekend, I was not happy.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions for hunting grounds after say 9th level? Thanks.<br/>
