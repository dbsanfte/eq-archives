<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066520872">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a lvl 14 Troll SK on the Innoruuk Server, and I heard that we can <br/>
improve our faction standing with the freeport guards by completing some <br/>
quests given by some NPCs in the underground tunnels.<br/>
<br/>
Who should i talk to in order to get the quests and where are the NPCs <br/>
located?  I went to the tunnel today but no NPCs were willing to give me any <br/>
quests.  I worship Cazic Thule...is that the reason the NPCs won&#39;t give me <br/>
any quests?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Squig<br/>
