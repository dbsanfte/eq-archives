<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226660063">just a few quick comments:<br/>
we DO get an invis spell, gather shadows, at lvl 30. yeah, it is awfully<br/>
late to be getting a travel related spell, but by then we&#39;re getting other<br/>
nifty spells as well. also, not ALL of our spells are useless at the level<br/>
we get them. at lvl 15 clinging darkness makes you considerably more<br/>
fearsome: not only is it a DOT spell that helps you kill things faster, it<br/>
also slows them, meaning you can run if you need to, and prevent THEM from<br/>
trying to escape. the pet spell was actually useful for lvls 15-17, as it<br/>
was keeping up with me as far as hit rate and damage was concerned, and<br/>
sometimes surpassing me. (remember that a monster of your same level can<br/>
probably beat the crap out of you unless you are lucky or a lot smarter than<br/>
it, so just because its several levels weaker than you doesnt make the pet<br/>
COMPLETELY useless..). fear is also useful, under controlled circumstances.<br/>
i.e., do NOT use fear on a froglok in guk unless you want to take a<br/>
screenshot of 30 ton knights before you die.<br/>
<br/>
i am also concerned about the vampiric embrace issue, and sincerely hoping<br/>
they get their act together and give it lifetapping ability rather than str<br/>
drain by the time i reach lvl 22. after all, i already HAVE a str drain<br/>
spell, and a ranged one at that. if i dont have a cleric around, i am SOL if<br/>
i get beat up badly. and i&#39;d rather not have to wait until i get a<br/>
darkreaver to be able to heal myself :)<br/>
<br/>
as for your ideas on harm touch, i think i prefer method one. if you raised<br/>
it to the level of LoH in terms of damage, it would be blatantly<br/>
overpowered. most creatures you fight probably dont have that much more than<br/>
20 times your level in hp, and you&#39;d see SK slaughtering nasties left and<br/>
right without breaking a sweat. a non-resistance policy may allow for some<br/>
abuse issues, but at least would put it more on the same footing with LoH.<br/>
