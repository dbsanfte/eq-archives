<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747942081">I was in the Bloodsaber guild, and in walks Kane Bayle.  I must<br/>
have messed up, because he&#39;s glowering at me.  Still talks to me, but<br/>
other npc&#39;s aligned with him won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Other than getting Trumpy Irontoe drunk, is there any way to get my<br/>
faction up with KaneBayle?<br/>
