<b>Subject:</b> Is there anything really good about shadowknights? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871600213">If there is anything good about being a shadowknight please lemme know<br/>
I think that a level 5 necro and a level 5 warrior would do much better than a level 10 necro<br/>
We level up slowly , we get killed all the time , our spells suck , the pets too<br/>
what else?<br/>
Shouldnt the sk be the most powerfull class in the game ???</div>
