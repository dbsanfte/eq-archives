<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938689430">I can&#39;t do unrest because I play on a Team PvP server. I&#39;ve still never<br/>
hunted there. I also won&#39;t hunt in Mistmoor because I still someday want to<br/>
have enuff faction to walk around freely in there. I found that there are<br/>
some peck NPC&#39;s in the mino caves past Meldrath that increase MM faction<br/>
past that of the Bard&#39;s. Although they are low low green to me by now so I<br/>
don&#39;t know If I have the patience for it.<br/>

I hated oasis too but you will find no better xp from 13-20. (Of course<br/>
again this is on a Racewar server and is controlled by evils with a max of<br/>
30 or so in the zone along the beach.<br/>
<br/>
also in mid 30-mid 40 you can do spectres in oasis or Feerot.<br/>
