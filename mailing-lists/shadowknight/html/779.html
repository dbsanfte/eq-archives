&gt; lodge of the dead. recently it seems the default human sk faction with the<br/>
&gt; lodge was either lowered, or the people who have trouble spent<br/>
&gt; too much time<br/>
&gt; hunting in befallen (which i have heard has a peripheral effect<br/>
&gt; on lodge of<br/>
&gt; the dead fac).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Care to share what yuou did to get the dead to like you? I will do whatever<br/>
I have to do to get this faction up but I am at a loss now.<br/>
