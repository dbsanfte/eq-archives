<b>Subject:</b> First Magic Weapon? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-821737276">Hey, I was glad to finally get another message from the list!!  Sorry, I haven&#39;t been on lately, but bought a new house and moving everything over, haven&#39;t had the computer hooked up for about a week and a half, so .....<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for all the SKs out there, I have just reached 14th lvl (woo-hoo!!), and things seem to be going okay.  My one major deficiency right now seems to be that I do not have a magic weapon.  I keep both 1HS and 2HS maxxed out, and have virtually no skill in the others (all below 10).  Hunting in Lavastorm is very difficult without a magic weapon, and I am starting to run into more and more INVULNERABLE!s elsewhere as well.  (Ghouls, etc.....)<br/>
<br/>
What is a good 1H or 2H slashing weapon that is that is both magic and inexpensive?  How much play should I plan on spending?  I can make some cash, but never seem to have the 200-300 plat for the auctioned weapons I would *like* to have..... &lt;grin&gt;.  Any recommendations out there?  Any higher level SKs with an old magic 1HS or 2HS that they would be willing to part with for a reasonable sum on the Povar server?  Any help my fellow SKs could lend would be very much appreciated!!<br/>
