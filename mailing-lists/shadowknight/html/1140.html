<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979433452">well, just try very hard to keep the not nodrop thing a secret among only SK<br/>
players.. that should spare us for a while. and luckily, because the quest<br/>
giving npcs are cloistered away in rather hard to reach locations, simply<br/>
harvesting them is somewhat impractical. the only parts i can only really<br/>
see being harvested are the bp and vambraces.. the rest are just not worth<br/>
the effort for somebody other than an sk.<br/>
<br/>
bracers: gotta kill mino hero. not worth the effort, when you can use those<br/>
shackles to get a hero bracer.<br/>
<br/>
helm: need to kill lots of FP militia helms. not a problem for some, but<br/>
others will not want to go KoS in a major city just so they can sell helms<br/>
to the smallest sector of society.<br/>
<br/>
gauntlet, greaves, and boots: you have to clear out half of najena every<br/>
time you get one of these. more work than most people want to do for<br/>
mid-level class specific items.<br/>
<br/>
in short, few people other than SK are going to want to do this quest in the<br/>
first place.<br/>
<br/>
and yes, i heard about the monkies. sat there with another sk and some other<br/>
folks for about 4 hours, and between the two of us we picked up 11 pieces we<br/>
didnt already have, and numerous repeats. (i&#39;m now only short the decayed<br/>
helm). am i a bastard for exploiting this? yes. but anything that gets me<br/>
out of that gods forsaken hole known as cazic faster.. it wasnt a totally<br/>
selfish affair tho, there were numerous lvl 30ish in the group, so i<br/>
introduced them to the xp money train. got at least two of them over a<br/>
bubble and a half of xp in that timeframe. sadly we got trained out by<br/>
somebody before many tae ew lizards spawned, but we had both the upper and<br/>
lower TR locked down with our lone group, and we didnt even have a dedicated<br/>
healer. it was pretty fun :)<br/>
<br/>
by the way, wearing a full suit of darkforge minus the helm (hatless<br/>
actually) looks pretty damn cool ;p<br/>
