<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-47570383"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is there a Web site that lists all the quests and strategies that<br/>
&gt; SKs of the difference races can perform and for what?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The closest thing to this I know of is the Knight Watch, the new site made<br/>
by the people who did the Shaman&#39;s Crucible. It&#39;s at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soerbaird.com/shadowknight/">http://www.soerbaird.com/shadowknight/</a> There isn&#39;t a heck of a lot up there<br/>
yet, though. I believe that much of what is there was contributed by members<br/>
of this list though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m also specifically curious about what kind of gear a typical<br/>
&gt; SK is wielding through his/her career starting from about 15th to<br/>
&gt; 50th.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Typical gear. Well, I am a lvl 24 Human SK. /played is 33 days -- maybe a<br/>
little high for my level but not TOO outrageous for a SK as far as I can<br/>
tell comparing it to others. Rundowns on different items for the last ten<br/>
levels.<br/>
<br/>
Weapons: I wielded a mino axe until 15, had a tentacle whip for a few<br/>
levels, then picked up a barbed whip for 43pp (all my savings) at 18. I used<br/>
that for I think two levels, then at about 20 I was camping (ugh!) jboots<br/>
with a group of friends all five to eight levels above me and we got a<br/>
bloodclaw, which was given to me. I learned piercing and use it still.<br/>
Currently realize that with the great deal of SK 2hs weapons that I had<br/>
better learn it, so I am SLOWLY learning 2hs with a store-bought claymore. I<br/>
have no funds to buy a real 2hs weapon so I will likely try and get a BBC or<br/>
something myself (with my friends that is) when my skill gets better.<br/>
Ultimate goal is to get a Ykesha or Wakazashi (which, btw, how are SK&#39;s<br/>
supposed to get a Wakazashi when the whole quest is now in Mistmoore and,<br/>
hmm, we get bad faction in Mistmoore-- but that is another point altogether.<br/>
:) and have a 1hs/shield to use against casters and a good 2hs for<br/>
straight-up damage.<br/>
<br/>
Armor: At 15 I believe I finally had almost a full suit of banded. At 24, my<br/>
armor is a med bronze breast and legs. Barbed arms for the dex that I got<br/>
for myself three days ago, banded face, raw-hide cloak (anyone got an extra<br/>
lizzie cloak on sol-ro for sale?), enchanter made rings, earrings and wrists<br/>
(get them at cost as the enchanter is my RL friend and we all play together<br/>
and help each other) to boost either int or dex to the max depending on the<br/>
situation (int to learn 2hs, dex for everyting else), no mask (grot mask on<br/>
its way), savants cap (you ever seen a human in a trashcan, I mean, plate<br/>
helm? God-awful ugly) and banded boots. I picked this stuff up slowly,<br/>
usually not going out looking for it, but when someone was selling it cheap,<br/>
or, in the case of the legs, someone sold it to a vendor.<br/>
<br/>
Toys: Too expensive. Except for my crude stein which is my absolute most<br/>
cherished possesion which I received from a lvl 50 Paladin in exchange for<br/>
bog juice the day before someone from Verant told the recipe to everyone.<br/>
(Not my favorite day ever in EQ when I had the market cornered, after two<br/>
weeks of experimentation, on something that every high level paladin wanted<br/>
and I could, in all SK-spirit, gouge them for, and the next day everyone and<br/>
their mother knew about it. Dang!).<br/>
<br/>
Bank: Not much. An Ashenwood short spear that I picked up from Drelzna three<br/>
nights ago when trying to get boots again (finally got them. 55 hours<br/>
total.) And a travelers pouch which is pretty much worthless. Can&#39;t hold<br/>
anything that weighs more than 1.0 or so. Stilleto won&#39;t even fit in it.<br/>
Have maybe 90pp total, 80pp of that I made today when exploring the OOT and<br/>
happening upon some halfling that had a bracer of Errolisi which a<br/>
twinked-out lvl 7 wood elf offered me 80pp for (he had a rubi bracer and<br/>
platinum ruby veil). Silly Feir&#39;Dal.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, hope this helps. I&#39;m curious if this is being posed in a<br/>
professional capacity or a personal one. If you don&#39;t want to say, that&#39;s<br/>
fine. Either way, if I can be of any more help, let me know through the list<br/>
or privately. I&#39;d love to help you out.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
