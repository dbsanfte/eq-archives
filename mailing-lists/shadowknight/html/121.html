<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593670289"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;But, I would like to know others opinions on how we should bring our<br/>
&gt;concerns to the people who just might actually do something about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I stated before, write up a well written essay on the subject, send it<br/>
to Smedley, and hope he does something about it.  That&#39;s the only realistic<br/>
way to get his attention.<br/>

I finally played with my pet last night, and have to say that in a party<br/>
situation it&#39;s pretty useless.  When fighting in a party we tend to go<br/>
after yellows a lot more, but most yellows will smack my pet in three<br/>
blows, so I end up tanking for my pet!<br/>
