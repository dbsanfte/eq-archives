I&#39;m new to this list so....  <br/>
<br/>
For the thex mallet quest you need to kill the paladin, Sir Lindeal in<br/>
Lavastorm.  Only thing is hes a rare spawn outside Najena and the Fire<br/>
Elementals kill him.  You also need good faction with Lrodd I believe as you<br/>
have to give him or his pet a note from Kizdean Gix.<br/>

Well I hit 13th last night. FINALLY!<br/>
I got tired of running from Fire Elementals in Lavastorm <br/>
and went to Befallen and camped Lrodd.  I noticed that <br/>
after killing him a few times at a yellow con, he <br/>
started conning even a few times and then blue.  I guess <br/>
there is some anti camp code that makes him a weaker <br/>
spawn, or it could be a set cycle. &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>
3 very kewl things happened to me there. <br/>
A high level shaman cast shrink on me!  That was so <br/>
kewl. No ducking the entire time I was there, and I FLEW <br/>
through everything.  <br/>
A 34th level druid cast Regeneration on me. That was <br/>
awesome!  I was at 1/4 bub of health after fighting <br/>
Lrodd (didn&#39;t use HT once since I was camping him :)  ) <br/>
and I went up to full in a very short amount of time <br/>
instead of the 10+ minutes I normally spend healing.  It <br/>
also lasted through 3 more fights with Lrodd and other <br/>
assorted denezines of Befallen.<br/>
That same Druid killed the Elf Skeleton (Red to me) and <br/>
got the Thex Mallet shaft and then gave it to me. He <br/>
said he was on another quest and didn&#39;t need it. I have <br/>
no idea if I can even comlete the quest, but I will look <br/>
that up shortly. Heh.<br/>
Anyone alive out there?</div>
