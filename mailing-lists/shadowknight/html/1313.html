 </span></blockquote>The one other place that&#39;s good to get small bronze armor is the gobbo<br/>
warriors and better in Highpass Keep.  At 26th level, that&#39;s a good prime<br/>
hunting ground for you right now, so go and hang out there for a bit.  You<br/>
might have to wait for a few to get into a group, but the end results are<br/>
very worthwhile.<br/>
