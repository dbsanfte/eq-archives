A human SK will have a tougher time than a human paladin if for no other reason than they&#39;re KOS in a lot more places.  Being evil<br/>
really puts you at a disadvantage, especially at earlier levels.  Sure, you do level faster, but on a per-encounter basis you&#39;re<br/>
going to be more powerful if you&#39;re a non-human.<br/>
<br/>
And in general, I&#39;m fairly confident that a dwarven or high elf paladin will fare much better than a human better (racial bonuses<br/>
are somewhat offset by exp penalty I believe).<br/>
