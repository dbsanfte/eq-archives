<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466135572">*Have any of you done the message to Freeport yet.  I talked with one of<br/>
*the Guild Masters in Neriak and he gave me a quest to talk to a spy in<br/>
*Freeport.  I have been Freeport and even in the guild....and I <br/>
*can&#39;t seem<br/>
*to find the guy I&#39;m looking for...maybe I have the wrong name <br/>
*written down<br/>
*or something....Anyone else ever do this quest?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recall the details offhand but if it&#39;s the one to give to Opal, she<br/>
is out after dark, I believe.  Time of day makes a difference as to where<br/>
the NPC&#39;s are.</div>
