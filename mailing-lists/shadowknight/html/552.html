&gt; Is this just a guess or do you have knowledge that this is the correct<br/>

&gt; On the side note -- According to Allakhazam&#39;s (everquest.gamestats.com)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; NPC is in Neriak. Dunno who is right or wrong.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First off, no, there is no way in hell that your party of 20s or 22s can<br/>
kill Arlena. She is in Mistmoore and she is a gyspy. Getting to Mistmoore is<br/>
a slight pain unless you can teleport over somewhere near there (and back).<br/>
Arlena is at least level 30. I say this because even the UNNAMED gyspy<br/>
musicians in Mistmoore are level 30, and they all can CHARM quite well. So,<br/>
be careful.<br/>
<br/>
Dekam N&#39;Tazi may very well be in Neriak. N&#39;Tazi sounds like a dark elf name<br/>
anyway. It was an assumption of mine he would be in Qeynos (cuz almost all<br/>
the quests in the west have something to do with Qeynos). If the site says<br/>
he&#39;s in Neriak, he&#39;s in Neriak. Come to think of it, that&#39;s actually a GOOD<br/>
thing. ;)<br/>
