<b>Subject:</b> update to hit rate and other things <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362661459">ok, i petitioned about the low hit rate thing (as many sk and paladins that<br/>
i knew had really crappy hit rate) and a gm replied that there was a bug<br/>
involved that they were working on. hmmmmmm...<br/>
<br/>
on the 1hs vs 2hs issue, i personally tend toward 1hs, tho i keep both<br/>
skills maxed for my level. right now, my 1hs weapon, the polished granite<br/>
tomahawk, just completely blows away any 2h weapon i can either afford or<br/>
reasonably obtain on my own or with my usual group of companions. also, i<br/>
greatly prefer the speed of the 1hs weapons.. they do less damage, but if<br/>
they swing almost twice as fast you are ultimately getting more out of it ;)<br/>
coincidentally, 1hs allows you to use bash, which is very helpful both for<br/>
breaking spellcaster concentration, and seems to help in your own casting as<br/>
well. (try casting just after you do a bash, it seems to gain you a second<br/>
or so of casting time). by the by.. if ever you do decide to group up and<br/>
get yourself a polished granite tomahawk, do NOT group with somebody you<br/>
dont know. bad story, and one i may relate later..<br/>
<br/>
also, Maxlis, NO! ghouls are most definitely NOT equivalent to the rats and<br/>
bats of freeport :) the ghouls are there to keep out foolish non-Tier&#39;dal<br/>
whelps who would soil the lodge of the dead with their presence!! but they<br/>
are fully capable of taking out a young dark elf who tries to pick a fight<br/>
with them.<br/>
