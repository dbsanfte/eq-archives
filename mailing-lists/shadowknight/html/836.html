<div id="ygrps-yiv-895877188">Sounds good (You can still get rid of Voice Graft, wouldn&#39;t hurt my feelings<br/>
at all). The only think I want to say is that it better be a damn nice<br/>
looking shield to make me give up how my MM Shield looks (that and the MM<br/>
shield has some nice stats as well). Also in regards to the sword, it would<br/>
have to have a really nice DMG/Dly ratio, due to the fact that when fighting<br/>
in a group in L. Guk or Sol B. it comes down to how much damage you do in<br/>
the shortest amount of time (especially when a G. Mino decides he doesn&#39;t<br/>
like your cleric). <br/>
<br/>
What I would like to see is a sword with identical stats to the Ghoulbane<br/>
(just not that damn undead spell, give us a nice DD spell instead, or maybe<br/>
a nice effect like Banshee Aura???) that has kind of a black aura<br/>
surrounding it (I think someone else mentioned this, kind of like a black<br/>
mist that covers us). That would look cool (Hell I gave up my Rubi legs and<br/>
went with Steel just because I couldn&#39;t stand how the Rubi looked).<br/>
<br/>
Oh and if you do it, make it so those of use past 30 can also get one, I<br/>
would hate to miss out on something just because I&#39;m too high a lvl.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just my ramblings...<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy<br/>
<br/>
Thom<br/>
(Oh and kick would still be nice)..<br/>

Okay, been perusing the e-mails.  Looks like a change to the magic system<br/>
isn&#39;t going to be happening any time soon because there doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
consensus within the SK community as to which spells suck and which don&#39;t<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
So to help out human and DE SKs, what about a shield/1HS combo acquirable<br/>
around 25th or 30th level through questing that gives you a significant<br/>
amount of protection (to make up for lack of HP compared to Ogre/SK) and<br/>
damage (think of an Anti-Ghoulbane)?<br/>
<br/>
And for you troll/ogre SKs, there are other goodies going in for you too :-)<br/>
