<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061558872">The problem with the HT idea is exactly as you stated.<br/>
When i use HT, i want the damage to be NOW.<br/>
We have no DD spells to speak of (Disease Cloud..our<br/>
only one..5DMG..sweet) so taking that one aspect from<br/>
the HT would indeed be a negative , IMO of course.<br/>
<br/>
And to be honest..there is NO WAY im unequipting my<br/>
weapon during battle. The main reason is lag. When you<br/>
are moviing your pointer around trying to put the<br/>
weapon back in its spot, lag can all too easily make<br/>
you miss the slot. And there for either pput it in a<br/>
trade window for another player. That 1. screws them<br/>
up. 2. at the least forces you to hit cancel, reopen<br/>
inventory, and then try again. Meanwhile you are<br/>
punching for 2, 1, miss, miss, miss, etc. And thats if<br/>
you are even facing the battle anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Or at the very worst, you miss the slot target and it<br/>
drops to the ground. That can get VERY messy.<br/>
<br/>
Now that sound like i went a little overboard, but<br/>
even if most dont see eye to eye with my specific<br/>
reasons, i think it will still be the general<br/>
consensus that hand-to-hand spell is not desired.<br/>
There was rumor at first that thats how you activated<br/>
Vamp Embrace before they changed it. There were a<br/>
whole lot of unhappy SKs with that idea.<br/>
<br/>
Now dont get all weepy because i didnt agree with your<br/>
ideas. I post many that people dont agree with too.<br/>
I just like that you are thinking about the class and<br/>
ways that it may be improved.<br/>
<br/>
But i will say that you see things differently once<br/>
you have more levels under your belt. I came up with<br/>
some ideas when i first started that wouldnt have<br/>
worked either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I still hold firmly to my idea that HT should have a<br/>
LifeDrain effect added to it.<br/>
So if your HT does 14DMG , like mine did at level 39,<br/>
then you get that 14 drained into you.<br/>
My point with that VERY real illustration is that it<br/>
will not be too powerful because it will stll have the<br/>
same obsurd resist rate.<br/>
So its not doing more damage so all the wizards can<br/>
stop shaking in their slippers thinking that we can<br/>
now steal kills from them. But at the same time add a<br/>
very useful function that we deserately need.<br/>
(i know they are testing Drains on test server, but a<br/>
45 max one will only be so useful).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway..i only have an hoour and a half til<br/>
work..gotts play, since the serverwide take downs last<br/>
night robbed me<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; i was thinking about Brian&#39;s comment about why they<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t change the resist rate on HT.  if 6 sks used<br/>
&gt; HT all at once, that would be a lot of damage done<br/>
&gt; to a mob, especially if it was a rare spawn.  what<br/>
&gt; if HT was changed from dd to dot?  the total damage<br/>
&gt; could be upped to 15 or 20 * lvl, and it could do<br/>
&gt; 5*lvl dd, then the rest could be dot over 1-2<br/>
&gt; minutes.  the resist rate could be lowered, and<br/>
&gt; damage would be increased.  the only problem that i<br/>
&gt; see is it would be less useful in emergency<br/>
&gt; situations, because it would not do as much damage<br/>
&gt; right away, and so could not kill a mob as quickly<br/>
&gt; if you are about to die.  do people think this would<br/>
&gt; be an improvement or a nerf?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; my other idea would be to create an sk only spell,<br/>
&gt; that is like vampiric embrace.  it would be hand<br/>
&gt; damage only, so no weapon.  it would be much harder<br/>
&gt; or impossible to resist the damage, but each hit<br/>
&gt; would take mana.  this way it could only be used for<br/>
&gt; a little bit of time, like 1-3 min., before oom. <br/>
&gt; would people find that useful?<br/>
