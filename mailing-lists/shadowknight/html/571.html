&gt; Yes we do, and our limit is 75 as well. Took me a while to figure that one<br/>
&gt; out ... I was getting really frustrated as my skill didn&#39;t go up after that<br/>
&gt; level!!! If you are asking whether to work on archery, however, I would<br/>
&gt; highly reccomend it. It takes a year and a day to get up, but it is very<br/>
&gt; worth it, especially when you are older and can afford a nice bow. I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; wait for a darkwood.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Do we have a maximum skill limit like the Palidans do in the catagory (I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think theirs is 75)?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

I can get a nice bow, yes, but I wonder what use Archery will be to me?<br/>
I typically pull with Darkness (may switch to Heat blood at 30th), so<br/>
pulling isn&#39;t issue.  I suppose I could kite with darkness and a bow,<br/>
but that&#39;s pretty boring.  <br/>
<br/>
So just tell me a good reason to spend time and money on a new skill,<br/>
and I buy a darkwood tonight.  Also, at level 26, will I be able to hit<br/>
anything with a 75 maxed skill?<br/>
