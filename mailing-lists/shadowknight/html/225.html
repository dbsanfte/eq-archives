<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780754729">I have also been told that everquest has never been balanced for pkill, it<br/>
is not a pkill game, that was just thrown is as a request from some<br/>
customers. The classes are balanced for grouping, but not for pkill. I have<br/>
also read that all tank types are getting smashed by pkill, as the mage<br/>
types target you... and blast you..you however have to stay on them in order<br/>
to hit them...if you have ever followed  someone, expecially someone trying<br/>
to avoid you(zigging and zagging) it is very hard for you to hit them. As<br/>
soon as the mage gets away from you he zaps you, and he does not even have<br/>
to have you on his screen. All that I have read confirms this...If you think<br/>
chasing a monster down to hit him is hard, try chasing a player...<br/>
Throw in also pets, roots, sow etc...ermm...<br/>
EQ was not desighned for pkill...try it, you will find the warr types are no<br/>
match.<br/>

&gt; I believe too that the Druid probably should have won, but it should at<br/>
&gt; least have been a fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It sounds like the SK was used to mop the floor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the HT did an absolutely pitiful amount of damage.<br/>
&gt; Which brings me back to my original complaints about the unreliability<br/>
&gt; or our &quot;special&quot; weapon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course this does all depend on the types of weapons and armor both<br/>
&gt; had and their skills in their weapon&#39;s type, offense and defense.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But i have a feeling that the buffing skills of druids are just way<br/>
&gt; more effective than any damage the SK could have done with his spells.<br/>
&gt; Since a druid will do the same amount of melee damage with a chosen<br/>
&gt; weapon as a SK, they have a distinct advantage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But we already know that SKs will be considerably weaker than most<br/>
&gt; other classes at low-mid levels.<br/>
&gt; I would like to hear from a SK 30+ and see if the clouds lining gets<br/>
&gt; any shinier.<br/>
