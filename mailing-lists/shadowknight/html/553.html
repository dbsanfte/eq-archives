First off, no, there is no way in hell that your party of 20s or 22s can<br/>
kill Arlena. She is in Mistmoore and she is a gyspy. Getting to Mistmoore is<br/>
a slight pain unless you can teleport over somewhere near there (and back).<br/>
Arlena is at least level 30. I say this because even the UNNAMED gyspy<br/>
musicians in Mistmoore are level 30, and they all can CHARM quite well. So,<br/>
be careful.<br/>
<br/>
Dekam N&#39;Tazi may very well be in Neriak. N&#39;Tazi sounds like a dark elf name<br/>
anyway. It was an assumption of mine he would be in Qeynos (cuz almost all<br/>
the quests in the west have something to do with Qeynos). If the site says<br/>
he&#39;s in Neriak, he&#39;s in Neriak. Come to think of it, that&#39;s actually a GOOD<br/>
thing. ;)<br/>

<br/>
The reason I said that was because a 23 shaman I was grouped with the other<br/>
day told me that she was yellow to him (1 or 2 levels up) whether or not he<br/>
was lying is up in the air, but that&#39;s the only reason I said that. I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen her, and I wish someone who has could give us the real lowdown<br/>
on her.<br/>
And yes it would be nice if Dekam is in Neriak, as I don&#39;t think Queynos has<br/>
an easy to sneak into sewer system (but I know nothing about that).<br/>
If someone out there has done this quest please post everything you know<br/>
about it please hehe<br/>
