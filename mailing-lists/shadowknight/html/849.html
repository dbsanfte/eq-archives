<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713110317">This may or may not be broken. If it was broken<br/>
before, it may not be now since the last patch. I have<br/>
noticed several small changes to certain lines of text<br/>
when you speak to NPCs now.<br/>
<br/>
Many have thought Shae to be broken because when you<br/>
killed her, she never dropped the note.<br/>
BUT, if you read your instructions carefully, you are<br/>
never actually told to kill her. You are told to go<br/>
find her and you are given a phrase to say to her.<br/>
Which of course you wont get a response from because<br/>
you faction with her is horrible.<br/>
<br/>
But that is now. Before the patch i could trigger her<br/>
even though she was threatening to me. She tells you<br/>
what happened to the note she was carrying.<br/>
<br/>
The hard part is finding Dyllin when he has this part<br/>
of the note. If you kill him in HH, he has a different<br/>
part, NOT the one that Shae is supposed to have.<br/>
<br/>
Thus my need to know if there is a way to get him to<br/>
spawn at the lake. (Unless the person who stated that<br/>
was mistaken).<br/>
