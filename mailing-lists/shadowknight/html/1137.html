<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094681700">I came across some disturbing info last night...<br/>
Darkforge Armor is no longer NO DROP.<br/>
All the pieces that I have that WERE NO DROP, arent<br/>
any longer.<br/>
This is bad,bad,bad,bad....<br/>
Item farming was bad enough before.<br/>
Having the DF armor NO DROP saved us from having to<br/>
compete with other who want the items to sell or twink<br/>
their level 5 SKs with.<br/>
Now we are back to square one.<br/>
BTW...Why can ANYONE do these quests?<br/>
It is SK only armor.<br/>
And the same should go for all the other class armors<br/>
as well. These quests are supposed to be for a<br/>
specific class, yet anyone can do them?<br/>
Thats just stupid.<br/>
<br/>
I for one am doing the FEEDBACK thing telling them of<br/>
my extreme displeasure at this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah..for some odd reason..the Hulking Gorillas in<br/>
the LTR now drop Decaying everytime<br/>
*shrug*..ya got me on that one<br/>
