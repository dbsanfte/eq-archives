<div id="ygrps-yiv-904717871"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Got an Ogre to get me the HEHE meat from Chef Dooga.<br/>
&gt; What a pain in the a$$.  The exchange went fine and we<br/>
&gt; were both very happy.  I talked for a while then went to<br/>
&gt; put them in the bank for when I give them to Carver.<br/>
&gt; While I was talking, I ATE ONE!  I was very POed! I had<br/>
&gt; 14 rations on me an the system had me eat a HEHE meat!<br/>
&gt; The ogre that got them for me said &quot;maybe that why it<br/>
&gt; called HEHE...&quot; DOH!  Anyway, I paid him to go get me<br/>
&gt; more HEHE (5 this time in case he ate one by accident,<br/>
&gt; and/or I ate another one) which I immediately ran and<br/>
&gt; put in the bank. Now I have enough HEHE meat to do the<br/>
&gt; Quest twice. :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s called HEHE meat because of its contents... Half Elf, Human, and<br/>
Erudite.<br/>
