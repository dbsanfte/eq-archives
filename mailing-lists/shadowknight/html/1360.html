<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856966815">Hi I am a Lvl 4 Human Shadowknight who worships Innorukk .. .<br/>
<br/>
My friend is an Agnostic Human Mage and he is not KOS from Dark Elf guards.<br/>
. .<br/>
<br/>
I should be at least apprehensive since he is dubious was my thinking, but I<br/>
just wanted to know what any other human shadowknights experiences were. . .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I picked Human for 1 main reason, all my friends who I am playing my low lvl<br/>
Shadowkngiht with are good and I thought Human would be the most welcome in<br/>
other good cities . . .<br/>
<br/>
How do you guys like playing a Shadowknight???<br/>
<br/>
I have a L42 Ogre Shaman also and a L26 Necro Gnome . . .<br/>
<br/>
