<div id="ygrps-yiv-828085485">I was just going through my EQ-shadowknight folder and realized that we<br/>
never finished the thread about the charred stuff. So I thought I would.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Charred Guardian Breastplate --&gt; dropped by clockwork EXG (a larger sized<br/>
female robot), is rare.<br/>
<br/>
Charred Boots --&gt; the fire goblin captain has these, he&#39;s a rare spawn but<br/>
boots are common loot.<br/>
<br/>
Charred Gauntlets --&gt; off the fire goblin captain too, but this is the rare<br/>
drop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
