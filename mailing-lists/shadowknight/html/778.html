<div id="ygrps-yiv-888607823">Okay I can understand that fear, because I have hunted with three other <br/>
shadow knights &lt;evil grin&gt; In any case, a faster recharge rate or slightly <br/>
higher damage as we reach the higher levels would be good because after a <br/>
certain point the amount of damage done by HT is piddling compared to the Hit <br/>
Points some of these monsters, so being able to do it more ofter or hurt just <br/>
a bit more would be nice.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I know HT comes up a lot, but there is a fear that HT could end up being<br/>
 heavily abused (worst nightmare....party of 6 50th level SKs stand around<br/>
 Mr. Named Mob that only pops once a day anyway, BAM 3000HP gone instantly<br/>
 and you now have a mob that starts the fight at 1/2 HP).<br/>
 <br/>
 If HT was upped slightly, had a slightly higher recharge rate, etc...what<br/>
 are your suggestions?<br/>
