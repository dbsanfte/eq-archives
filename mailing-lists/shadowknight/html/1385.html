Great thanks for that!<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve been reading up on Shadow knight sites and there is so much arguing
about how tough certain creatures are it&#39;s unbelievable.<br>
<br>
eg.&nbsp; Dervish Cutthroat - I can take three on at level-10<br>
<br>
answer - my arse can you take them on at level-10 you&#39;de need to have
around three at level 10 to take on one!<br>
<br>
Anyway it went on like that for 6 pages.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve recently just entered South Ro and found killing the Ork warriors
not to hard.&nbsp; There where two off us : Me Troll Shadow, Lev-9&nbsp;
and the guy I was with a Troll Shaman Lev-9 as well.&nbsp; Between us we
could take out a camp of three warriors and a Cleric, but we targeted the
cleric first since the git kept healing the warriors every time we hit
them!!!<br>
<br>
I&#39;m finding it easy to kill creatures but after say an hour of hacking I
look at my exp and see basically no difference, is the generally what
happens when your a Troll and a Shadow Knight!!!!!<br>
