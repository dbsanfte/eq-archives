<div id="ygrps-yiv-393599012">I used my first to pets religiously. I think they are<br/>
useful for those levels.<br/>
But once i hit 22, i never used my pet other than to<br/>
practice my Evocation for Ward Undead.<br/>
<br/>
At this point i think the pets can be done away with.<br/>
<br/>
Replace them with a line of shields like Shieldskin.<br/>
Or something damage oriented.<br/>
<br/>
The debate about Banshee Aura making us too powerful<br/>
may keep us from getting that line instead of the Skin<br/>
line. Although an 8 point damage spell, i dont<br/>
believe, would make us over powered. We would have<br/>
gotten that spell at level 39. 8 points per hit to us<br/>
at level 39 would be useful, without being too much.<br/>
Sure we get hit alot, but what we are fighting will<br/>
have a lot of HP. It fits into our RP perfectly. We do<br/>
damage. Banshee does damage. Sounds like a match to<br/>
me.<br/>
Plus when they made this decision, no SKs were even<br/>
close to hitting 39. They did this very early in the<br/>
game. I dont see how they determined that we would be<br/>
too strong with it, when no one had even gotten it<br/>
yet.<br/>
Maybe some in the Betas, but im betting there werent<br/>
enough high level SKs i Beta for them to make a valid<br/>
decision.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thats it for now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll torture you folks more a little later on<br/>
