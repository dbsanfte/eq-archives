&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there a list of SK only items out there? Or one that<br/>
&gt; shows what is best for an SK vs. what is worst?<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My new Dark Reaver is pretty good for an SK.  Got if off a lucky<br/>
trade (GZ and Rubi bracer for it).  Can&#39;t wait for it to proc<br/>
the siphon strength.<br/>
<br/>
Umbral armor (Plane of Fear) is SK only, as is the Soul Leech.<br/>
Several weapons on EQ&#39;Lizer are listed as SK/Warrior only.<br/>
<br/>
The main SK problem is 1H vs 2H.  My advice:  work on both.<br/>
Don&#39;t get stuck at 27th like me and have pitiful 1H and bash.<br/>
Of course for a large race you can slam with a 2H weapon, so<br/>
I would probably stick to your 2H, but no reason not to keep<br/>
both maxed (except maybe intelligence =) since you can afford<br/>
a magic 1H before a magic 2H.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have to borrow a claw from a friend, find a shield, and <br/>
get my skills up, hopefully without getting my nukers killed.<br/>
The best reason to keep 1H up for humans/DE&#39;s is so you can<br/>
bash a caster, and when they are using greater heal, that one<br/>
bash can mean alot.<br/>
