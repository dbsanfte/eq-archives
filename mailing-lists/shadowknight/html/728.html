&gt; just remembered an old idea for a neat sk/necro spell that i thought up long<br/>
&gt; ago. the basic idea is that it creates a NEGATIVE lighting effect around the<br/>
&gt; caster. i.e. where a lightstone makes more light around the person who holds<br/>
&gt; it, this spell would make it darker. either the caster could be immune to<br/>
&gt; this efffect and see normally, or could see normally by virtue of<br/>
&gt; infra/ultravision (which any sk should have by the time he would get this<br/>
&gt; spell..) this would imho be even more fun than voice graft :) and more in<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought this would be a great effect for Dark Reaver or some other<br/>
Unholy sword, instead of light, an aura of darkness and ultravision to<br/>
the wielder.  It would give us teh cool visuals of Soulfire.<br/>
