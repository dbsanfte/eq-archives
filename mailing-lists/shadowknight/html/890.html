<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653669888"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I notice that some of my skills are caping.  Does anyone one know where we<br/>
&gt; can find a list of when all skills cap?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seems dodge capped at level 25<br/>
&gt; does anyone know when parry caps?<br/>
&gt; or riposte?<br/>
&gt; or anything else for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Taunt won&#39;t go up after level 30.<br/>
Dodge/Parry won&#39;t go up after level 35.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 39, and the only things that went up for me were Offense, Defense,<br/>
Double Attack, and Two-Handed Slashing. Oh, and Riposte too I think...<br/>
