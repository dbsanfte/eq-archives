 </span></blockquote>Actually, come to think of it, I like the damage shield idea even better<br/>
than the lifetap series. Ok, so healing and any type of downtime reduction<br/>
is right out, I can live with that (I got used to it, played a mostly-solo<br/>
warrior to 31). But Banshee Aura (et. al) would be wonderful! Rangers get<br/>
thorns, dangit, let me chill some kobolds to the bone! It&#39;s also more damage<br/>
we can put out, HENCE Beld wouldn&#39;t mind it. Go damage shields go! Good<br/>
thinking, man!<br/>
<br/>
Btw, the only 39 spell I&#39;m looking forward to is Heart Flutter, all the<br/>
others are, well... crap. (sorry Brian) Cancel Magic, ok for those dots that<br/>
just won&#39;t come off. Shadow Vortex, gimme a break, no one EVER uses that<br/>
spell. Pet spell, shah right. Shield Skin, heh what a joke, absorb one hit<br/>
for a ton of mana AND reagents, no thanks my 136 Agi will do a better job<br/>
for free. And the list goes on...<br/>
