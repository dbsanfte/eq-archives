<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444862312">Okay.. Imagine you duel a Druid one level higher than you. He flat beats yer <br/>
ass.. harm touch does hack and his screaming macer is beatin yer ass while <br/>
yer shiny brass halberd is doin 3 pts of damage. Silly..<br/>
I have almost a full suit of bronze.. 17th lev.. Shint brass halb, Derv <br/>
rings, spiked collar. I think that sk&#39;s ar HORRRIBLY dicked after this <br/>
duel.. No only was it not close.. it was humiliating. Verant better do <br/>
something or else shadowknights are gona die out. Especially when my HT does <br/>
about 40pts at 17th level to an `18 level pc.<br/>
i am Disgusted<br/>
