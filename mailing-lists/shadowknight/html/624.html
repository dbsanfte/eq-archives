<b>Subject:</b> true honest moneymaker <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067759966">Okay, now I&#39;m not going to give all that bs about how amazing this<br/>
little money maker is, or how it&#39;s going to change your life, because<br/>
it&#39;s not. I&#39;ll be frank- it gets you a decent amount of money (not like<br/>
a good career does or the lottery) considering that you didn&#39;t really do<br/>
anything. Just read for yourself and decide if you&#39;d like to do it or<br/>
not. Like I said, I didn&#39;t get rich, but I did receive a total of about<br/>
250 dollars in a week and a half, so I&#39;m still waiting to see how far<br/>
this goes. It&#39;d be great if this continues, seeing that I&#39;ll have over<br/>
500 dollars by next week if the estimates are correct, but I&#39;m still<br/>
somewhat skeptical. It sounds like it has real potential though, seeing<br/>
that it&#39;s a well thought out system- read for yourself. Oh, and I<br/>
forgot- 6 dollars and six stamps- that&#39;s what you lose. You need six one<br/>
dollar bills and six stamps to do this, hardly anything at all if you<br/>
just made what I&#39;ve made (i admit though, I didn&#39;t post it in many news<br/>
groups, but the more you post the more you&#39;ll get- this isn&#39;t bogus<br/>
though like those &quot;6 year old Jimmy Dean lost his leg in Vietnam&quot; scams,<br/>
and I&#39;m sick of those)<br/>
Oh yeah, and I don&#39;t really think you&#39;ll make 42,000 dollars in 4 weeks<br/>
like the original letter says (unless you&#39;re some psycho maniac who<br/>
LIVES by visiting every news group and mailing list in the world and<br/>
sends a post to each one), but at least I got something out of it.<br/>
Attached is the letter I got- including the original post and a forward<br/>
the guy who sent the letter to me wrote.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I tried this so-called money maker,and the astronomical numbers it<br/>
claimed I would make were just a fraction of what i actually got, so<br/>
instead of making $60,000+ I made maybe $6,000 in maybe a month and a<br/>
half. This is a very good, small low risk &quot;lottery&quot; to try for us<br/>
hard-working penny saving people. It&#39;s only $6 dollars, but i can<br/>
honestly say you won&#39;t get rich with this but you will make some decent<br/>
money. I have attached the eniter letter so you cn read and decide for<br/>
yourself. I thought at first it was a scam, but I took a chance and only<br/>
sacrificed 6 dollars and 6 stamps and after that money started coming I<br/>
forgot about that measly 6 dollars and was rolling in cash. Just read<br/>
the bottom and you&quot;ll see. First, I would like to start off by telling<br/>
you i am still in HS (and you can be even younger to do this!) and<br/>
making more money than my dad! This really WORKS! But you must follow my<br/>
instructions and do everything just like I say. I had read this a couple<br/>
of times to fully understand how it works. But once you get the hang of<br/>
it, it&#39;s easy. So if you need some extra cash, and would like to earn it<br/>
by doing nothingm then it is worth it. I like this because it&#39;s like<br/>
I&#39;ll scratch your back if you scratch mine. But to fully understand read <br/>
on....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THIS REALLY CAN MAKE YOU EASY MONEY! BUT REMEMBER THIS &quot; YOU WILL GET<br/>
OUT OF THIS WHAT YOU PUT INTO IT&quot;.  IF YOU WANT LOTS OF MONEY, THEN YOU<br/>
BETTER POST THIS NARRATIVE A LOT!<br/>
<br/>
A little while back, I was browsing through some newsgroup and came<br/>
across an article similar to this that said you could make thousands of<br/>
dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00! So I<br/>
thought, &quot;Ok, why not try this if it is a scam I will only lose $6.00.&quot;.<br/>
Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and addresses<br/>
stated in the article. After you do that, you place your own name and<br/>
address at the bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in some<br/>
newsgroups (There are thousands) or e-mail it to some people. No catch,<br/>
that was it.  The main difference between this system and others is that<br/>
you have a mailing list of 6 instead of 5. This means that your average<br/>
gain will be approximately 15 times higher!!! So after talking to a few<br/>
people, I thought, what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00,<br/>
right? But like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried<br/>
about the lefal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S.<br/>
Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!<br/>
<br/>
I then invested the measly $6.00, and stamps. Well, GUESS<br/>
WHAT.....within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was<br/>
shocked! I still figured it would end soon, and didn&#39;t give it another<br/>
thought. But the money kept coming in. In my first week, I made about<br/>
$36.00 dollars. By the end of the second week I had made a total of over<br/>
$1,000.00 dollars!!!!!! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 and it&#39;s<br/>
still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of<br/>
just over 42,000.00 and it&#39;s still coming in VERY rapidly!  It&#39;s<br/>
certainly worth $6.00 and 6 stamps, I spend more than that on the<br/>
lottery!<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you how this works and most importantly why it works....also<br/>
make sure you PRINT a copy of this article NOW so you can thoroughly<br/>
read this to understand it and use it as a reference for information.<br/>
The process is very simple and consists of 3 easy steps:<br/>
<br/>
STEP 1: Get 6 seperate pieces of paper and write the following on each<br/>
piece of paper<br/>
&quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot;, then your name and address<br/>
Now get 6 U.S. $1.00 bills (or equivilent in your local currency) and<br/>
place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be<br/>
seen through the envelope to prevent thievery.  Next, place one paper<br/>
(containing a dollar bill) inside each envelope and seal them. You<br/>
should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating<br/>
the above phrase , your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are<br/>
doing is creating a service by this. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!<br/>
<br/>
STEP 2: Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#1 La Rue Lockhart<br/>
166w-300n<br/>
Hurricane, Ut, 84737<br/>
<br/>
#2 Geoff Mellor<br/>
10 Tetworth<br/>
Nollamara, Wa 6061<br/>
Australia<br/>
<br/>
#3 Jalen Rose<br/>
1320 San Bernadino #66<br/>
Upland, Ca 91786<br/>
<br/>
#4 Linda Franks<br/>
62 Winchelsea Rd<br/>
Nollamara, Wa 6061<br/>
Australia<br/>
<br/>
#5 Britney Lemasters<br/>
4685 Reimann Street N.E.<br/>
Salem, Oregon, 97305<br/>
<br/>
#6 Larry Shin<br/>
4 Wellesley<br/>
Irvine, CA, 92612<br/>
<br/>
Step 3: Now after mailing each letter to the 6, take the number one name<br/>
off the list that you see above, move the other names up (#6 becomes #5,<br/>
#5 becomes #4, etc...) and then add YOUR name and address as the #6 on<br/>
the list.<br/>
<br/>
Step 4: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as<br/>
close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to some<br/>
newsgroups (I think there are close to 24,000 newsgroups) and/or email<br/>
it to some people. Remember, the more you post, the more money you will<br/>
make! Don&#39;t know HOW to post in the newsgroups? Well do exactly the<br/>
following:<br/>
_____________________________________<br/>
DIRECTIONS HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS<br/>
<br/>
STEP 1: You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own<br/>
posting, Simply put your cursor at the beginning og this letter, click<br/>
and hold down the moust button. While continuing to hold down the mouse<br/>
button, drag your cursor to the bottom of this document and over to just<br/>
after the last character, and release the moust button. At this point<br/>
the entire letter should be highlighted, Then, from the &#39;edit&#39; pull down<br/>
menu at the top of your screen select &#39;copy&#39;. This will copy the entire<br/>
letter into the computer&#39;s memory.<br/>
<br/>
STEP 2: Open a blank &#39;notepad&#39; file and place your cursor at the top of<br/>
the blank page (the way it starts out) From the &#39;edit&#39; pull down menu<br/>
select &#39;paste&#39;. This will paste a copy of the letter into the notepad so<br/>
that you can add your name to the list. Remember to eliminate the #1<br/>
position, move everyone up a spot (re-number everyone else&#39;s positions),<br/>
and add yourself in as #6.<br/>
<br/>
STEP 3: Save your new notepad fole as a .txt file. If you want to do<br/>
your postings in a different setting, you&#39;ll always have this file to go<br/>
back to.<br/>
<br/>
FOR NETSCAPE USERS:<br/>
___________________<br/>
<br/>
STEP 4: Within the Netscape program, go to the pull down window entitled<br/>
&#39;Window&#39; select &#39;Netscape News&#39;. Then from the pull down menu &#39;Options&#39;,<br/>
select &#39;Show all Newsgroups&#39;. After a few moments a list of all the<br/>
newsgroups on your screen server will show up, Click on any newsgroup<br/>
you desire. From within the newsgroup click on the &#39;TO NEWS&#39; button,<br/>
which should be in the top left corner of the newsgroups page. This will<br/>
bring up a message box.<br/>
<br/>
STEP 5: Fill in the subject. This will be the header that everyone sees<br/>
as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group.<br/>
<br/>
STEP 6: Highlight the entire contents of your .txt file and copy them<br/>
using the same technique as before. Go back to the newsgroup &#39;TO NEWS&#39;<br/>
posting you are creating and paste the letter into the body of your<br/>
posting.<br/>
<br/>
STEP 7: Hit the &#39;Send&#39; button in the upper left hand corner. You&#39;re done<br/>
with your first one! Congratulations, and good luck!<br/>

________________________________________________________________________<br/>
 <br/>
THAT&#39;S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post<br/>
away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for<br/>
each newsgroup!  **THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU<br/>
WILL MAKE!!** That&#39;s it! You will begin receiving money from around the<br/>
world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O. box due to the<br/>
large amount of mail you receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can<br/>
invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it.<br/>
<br/>
**JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.**<br/>
<br/>
Now the WHY part:<br/>
<br/>
Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very example). So<br/>
then I made $5.00 with my name at #6  on the letter. Now, each of the 5<br/>
persons who just sent me $1.00 make 200 postings, each with my name at<br/>
#5 and only 5 persons responde to each of the original 5, that is<br/>
another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each  make 200 postings with my name<br/>
at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00!<br/>
Now, those 125 persons turn around and post 200 with my name at #3 and<br/>
only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK, now<br/>
here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post 200 letters with my<br/>
name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me<br/>
$3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will deliver this message to 200<br/>
newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups<br/>
react I will receive $15,625.00! With an original investment of only<br/>
$6.00! AMAZING! And as I said 5 responses are actually VERY LOW! Average<br/>
are probable to 20 to 30! SO lets put those figures to just 15 responses<br/>
per person. Here is what you will make:<br/>
<br/>
at #6 $15.00<br/>
<br/>
at #5 $225.00<br/>
<br/>
at #4 $3,375.00<br/>
<br/>
at #3 $50,625.00<br/>
<br/>
at #2 $759, 375.00<br/>
<br/>
at #1 $11,390,625.00<br/>
<br/>
When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest<br/>
posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on the<br/>
list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The<br/>
thing to remember is, do you realize that thousands of people all over<br/>
the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday,<br/>
JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So can you afford $6.00 and see if it really<br/>
works?? I think so.. People have said, &quot;what if the plan is played out<br/>
and no one sends you money?&quot; So what! What are the chances of that<br/>
happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people<br/>
who are joining the the internet and newsgroups everyday and willing to<br/>
give it a try? Estimates are at 20,00 to 50,00 new users, everyday, with<br/>
thousands of those joining the actual Internet. Remember, play FAIRLY<br/>
and HONESTLY and this will work just have to be honest. Make sure you<br/>
pring this article out RIGHT NOW. Try to keep a list of everybody that<br/>
sends you money and always keep an eye on the newsgroups to make sure<br/>
everyone is playing fairly. Remember, HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY. You<br/>
don&#39;t need to cheat the basic idea to make money!! GOOD LUCK TO ALL and<br/>
please play FAIRLY and reap the huge rewards from this, which is extra<br/>
cash!</div>
