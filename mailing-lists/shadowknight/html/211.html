<div id="ygrps-yiv-475350855">hmm. as for who&#39;s winning the race for highest level SK.. Erasmus on Fennin<br/>
Ro was 33 last time i saw. and he isnt even the biggest guy on the shard.<br/>
but then, they really could use lives :)<br/>
<br/>
as for the druid duel thing.. it shouldnt have been such an unbalanced<br/>
fight, but the druid probably SHOULD still have won. remember, spellcasters<br/>
are supposed to have great power, especially at mid and high level. if he<br/>
roots you and you dont have shadow step ready, you&#39;re just a goner. which is<br/>
why i suggest that, as a shadow knight, we should all try to find as much<br/>
equipment as we can that gives us bonuses to magic resist as well as ac. if<br/>
that high level wiz cant root us.. he&#39;s in a lot of trouble ;)<br/>
