<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-457715049">those guards used to carry short swords (not rusty) and occasionally helms,<br/>
but when they decided that people were abusing them for money, they removed<br/>
their loot. now the only reason to kill the guards is to annoy the freeport<br/>
militia, or try to make friends with the knights of truth. but as SK, why<br/>
would we want to do that? ;)<br/>
