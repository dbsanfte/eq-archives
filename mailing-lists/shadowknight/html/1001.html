<div id="ygrps-yiv-862622010">Well for the first time in months MM was actually camped heavily last night<br/>
on my server so I never got to talk to the guy.. I saw him once, right<br/>
before several high lvl casters decided to make an example of him.. I&#39;m<br/>
hoping I can get on late tonight and have no one else around..<br/>
<br/>
On the faction side, I also stopped in High Keep looking for Leyna(sp?), not<br/>
to be found.. And I realized that it takes a hell of a lot of bards to get<br/>
your faction increased. (That plus their are on a 20min respawn makes it<br/>
annoying as hell). Now the million dollar question, do you actually need MM<br/>
faction to do the quest, plus I&#39;ve heard rumors that there are only 4 SK<br/>
armor pieces (compared to 7 for the other classes) can anybody confirm this?<br/>

the lenya quest seems to have been removed. i&#39;ll give you two guesses, and<br/>
they are probably both right :)<br/>
<br/>
i screwed up about the MM quest hehe.. it DOES work. you just have to say<br/>
the exact right thing to the npc: &quot;how do i get shadow knight armor&quot;. sounds<br/>
obvious maybe, but you shoulda been there with us when we were fielding<br/>
questions..<br/>
<br/>
i still feel the frequent death of the thing and its 6+ hour respawn time<br/>
are legitimate gripes. otherwise, once you get the shopping list for items,<br/>
these quests are practically handed to us compared to the other class armor<br/>
quests.<br/>
