<div id="ygrps-yiv-804332180">freeport is somewhat different from other cities in that evil folk CAN enter<br/>
most of it if you spend time gaining faction. this is because of the fact<br/>
that the guards in n freeport are paladins, and the guards in w and e<br/>
freeport are militia, and the two groups hate each other. so kill enough of<br/>
one, and the other will allow you in. this means that if a troll were to<br/>
sneak into n freeport via the drainage system and kill enough guards there,<br/>
he could safely walk the streets in the rest of town! but like i said, this<br/>
seems to be an exception; i have found NOTHING that increases my faction<br/>
with either grobb or oggok, so i fear that as a human sk i will never be<br/>
allowed into these two cities :(<br/>
