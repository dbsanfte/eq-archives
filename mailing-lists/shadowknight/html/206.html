<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035444737">the bone bladed claymore is on a troll sk in lvl 3 befallen. if you have<br/>
been to the bottom of the well, you have passed very close to him. as you<br/>
pass thru the false wall in lvl 3, the troll is down the path to the right.<br/>
despite what anybody may tell you about the troll being a badass, it is only<br/>
lvl 15 and not terribly menacing. the problem is that he often spawns with<br/>
ghouls and theurges and ice bones as friends.<br/>
<br/>
as for the new patch saying that vampiric embrace is fixed.. YAY! i am 3<br/>
bubs from 22.. if that makes me the highest level on this mailing list, i<br/>
will work on getting the level in a day or two and let you know what happens.<br/>
