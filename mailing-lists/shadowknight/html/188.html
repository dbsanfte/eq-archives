&gt;I dont have any problem with making a Character more difficult to play, such<br/>
&gt;as boosting the EP requirements from level to level. This only makes sense,<br/>
&gt;especially taking into account some classes are more powerfull then others.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;My objection is that Godd vs Evil is not balanced out. There should be a<br/>
&gt;number of Good cities, a number of Evil Cities and the rest should be true<br/>
&gt;Nuetral cities where what you kill determines your relationship to the toen<br/>
&gt;not your chosen god.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i agree. if there is anything that is truly unbalanced against us it is good<br/>
vs evil. i&#39;ve heard of people who think we need a good vs evil semi pvp<br/>
server, and i just have to laugh at that. what person in their right mind<br/>
would want to play an evil person on a server where the odds are so badly<br/>
stacked against you? we have dark elves, trolls, and ogres on the evil side,<br/>
and humans, half elves, wood elves, high elves, halflings, gnomes, dwarves,<br/>
barbarians, and erudites on the good side (minus a few people from those<br/>
races who choose an evil class, or just plain worship an evil god, i.e. a<br/>
gnome cleric of bertoxxulous). this gives the good races an inherant and<br/>
unbalanced advantage in regards to where they can go, and the reactions that<br/>
the numerous npcs of the world give them.  just last night i got killed<br/>
TWICE by a roaming group of npcs in n karana that just happened to be right<br/>
there when i crossed the zone border (twice), just because they dont like<br/>
shadow knights.  evil people really dont have that many areas they can get<br/>
to.. which is why i&#39;m hoping that if rumors are true and they ARE working on<br/>
a new continent, that it will contain several more playable evil races so we<br/>
have more to do. (maybe dark dwarves, altho i think playable orcs would rock<br/>
:)). now i&#39;ll grant you that most people simply prefer to play as the good<br/>
guy (the fools dont know what they&#39;re missing!) but that doesnt mean they<br/>
have to beat so hard on folks who choose to be eeeeeeevil :) give us<br/>
someplace to go! or at least let us evil people who arent of the 3 big evil<br/>
races get into grobb and oggok. (in case you dont know, there are a few<br/>
spells we can use that to my knowledge can ONLY be found in grobb. this is<br/>
somewhat of an annoyance to human shadow knights and necromancers who start<br/>
the game KoS by grobb&#39;s bashers).<br/>
