&gt; 1) Do guards see invis? I wonder because I hope that now I can bind just<br/>
&gt; inside oggok or grobb when in cazic (I hate that place) or guk (a little<br/>
&gt; better) to avoid the long long run back from E Freeport.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some seem to.  My suicide run through Qeynos and again into the Freeport<br/>
Militia house have both been unsuccessful even while invis.  However, I<br/>
bind in Surefall Glade occasionaly, and can make faces at those guards<br/>
and they never blink.  Invis never works 100%, but it is still the<br/>
sweetest tool we have at level 30.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) How long does feign death last? Indefinitely? Is it usable in combat<br/>
&gt; situations? ie I am generally the only non-gater in my group. Does it cast<br/>
&gt; quickly like shadow step so that I can cast it after taunting 5 mobs on me<br/>
&gt; so my group can gate out of there? I know my girlfriend is looking forward<br/>
&gt; to me getting feign death after I explained how it works because she started<br/>
&gt; the game only recently but expects me to help her level. Hmmm. No Level no<br/>
&gt; Lovin&#39;? Heh.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First of all, don&#39;t DOT anything you plan on feigning.  They will<br/>
continue to attack you, and by doing so, all the other enemies will<br/>
see through it as well.  I have never seen it run out, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
put up a spell effect like invis, you just hit the sit button to stand<br/>
up, or meditate, or whatever.  Also, you will want to practice the<br/>
feign pull, it is very handy and your groups will love you for <br/>
camp breaking.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) About time we got a disease spell (Endure Disease). As someone else has<br/>
&gt; said in the past ... it owuld really make sense for us to get CURE disease<br/>
&gt; like necros. You should be able to undo anything that you can do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t had a bad disease in a while, but I hear Sol B has some<br/>
new ones to enjoy.  I travel with a cleric.  &#39;Nuff said.<br/>
<br/>
No comment on the rest.  I used my pet just teh other day to solo guards <br/>
and such, not bad when you get him behind the mobs, double attacking for<br/>
11-18 and bashing to boot.  Of course I was giving him decent (not <br/>
rusty) weapons and always kept him behind them.  So don&#39;t discount<br/>
them yet.  They are great outdoors for soloing, probably doing 200<br/>
or so damage in combat.  Not bad with Heat Blood and Engulfing going<br/>
at the same time.  Throw in a fear and a blue is dead with less than <br/>
a bar of damage to you.<br/>
