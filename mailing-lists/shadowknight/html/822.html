<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869233157">Do you have a link to the EQSS forum that has the actual <br/>
petition?  I found a thread that is asking for support <br/>
that turned into a debate, but nothing that says vote <br/>
yes, station ID, Server, etc. that the coordinator says <br/>
are the only things enterable when voting for a <br/>
petition. Also, that thread I found the debate in was a <br/>
closed thread.  Beld was active in it, but no official <br/>
votes were tallied that I saw.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
