<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337233223"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s feasible with a few 22s (give or take a few levels) but<br/>
&gt; what I wish I knew now is where Arlena spawned.<br/>
&gt; And as a side note, how can a dark elven sk get to Dekam N&#39;Tazi?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this just a guess or do you have knowledge that this is the correct<br/>
level? It will be a pain in the butt to get my friends to go over there, and<br/>
I don&#39;t want to gett ehre and find she&#39;ll kick our butts. :)<br/>
<br/>
On the side note -- According to Allakhazam&#39;s (everquest.gamestats.com) that<br/>
NPC is in Neriak. Dunno who is right or wrong. I am writing  a paper tonight<br/>
(um, well, I&#39;m supposed to be at least) so I can not log on or it will never<br/>
be done. This site says:<br/>
::When you return the item to Grimrot, you will receive two items:  a<br/>
blackened blade hilt<br/>
::(LORE) and a note, and more info on how to complete the quest.  Take the<br/>
note to the NPC<br/>
::Dekam N&#39;Tazi near SK guild in Neriak, and you will get a LORE item,<br/>
blackened iron mold, a<br/>
::container with 2 slots in it plus a combine button.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has direct knowledge of this quest, feel free to let us know who<br/>
is right. :)<br/>
<br/>
Back to procrastinating, er, um, writing my paper,<br/>
