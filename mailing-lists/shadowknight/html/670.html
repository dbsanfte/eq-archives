<div id="ygrps-yiv-41958053">Okay, I&#39;ve played an SK before....some of you may remember me from WAY back in the day when I was Vrathus on Cazic-Thule, but I only<br/>
got to 11th before deciding that being KOS was just not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
First off, your weapon descriptions lead me to think that you are buying weapons at those levels, since it is my understanding that<br/>
a GZ isn&#39;t exactly easy to come by until about 35th level (with a group) and you have it listed as a 21-30 weapon.  Also, Dark<br/>
Reavers are located in a very, very dangerous place, and I would imagine it takes a party of low-40s to get it.<br/>
<br/>
Or is my view of things really skewed?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that the BBC is pretty much valueless -- seems that you can get by with a Combine 2HS or SBH until you hit the level<br/>
necessary for BIBS.  Is there any real demand for the BBC?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried looking at the various Web pages for info on the SK quests, but they are sorted by zone, and it is much more interesting<br/>
to me to see quests by class/race.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also interested in finding faction breakdowns, etc.<br/>
