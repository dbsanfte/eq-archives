<b>Subject:</b> A few little changes I&#39;d like to see <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-457196993">I must say I agree with Human SK&#39;s being th hardest. Not sure why erudite<br/>
pally would be harder though?<br/>
<br/>
I have made it up to lvl 43 so it is possible. If I didn&#39;t love my class so<br/>
much and enjoy it I would have given up long ago.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re looking at changes the the SK class to make them more viable I<br/>
would suggest a minor life tap spell at lvl 15 or 22 instead of vamp<br/>
embrace. the lack of healing is a major pain at low levels. re evaluating<br/>
the whole pet idea, and the associated spells (mend bones, voice graft).<br/>
some buffing spell would help heaps I think.<br/>
<br/>
and more importantly some nice weapons!! ones that aren&#39;t on the plane of<br/>
fear 8)<br/>
