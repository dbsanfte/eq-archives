<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117396604">NO LIFETAP! i&#39;ve been ragging on this forever, people keep saying we should<br/>
have lifetaps, and i have to keep saying no :) either they would be too<br/>
underpowered for us and be a total waste of space, or they&#39;d be too powerful<br/>
and make us one step closer to being a god class. we aren&#39;t playing UO folks<br/>
:) while something like that would be NICE, we sure as heck do not NEED it.<br/>
anyway i&#39;d take a long-term DOT via the pet over a lifetap for 20 or 30 any<br/>
day. you DO realize how slow those spells cast? :)<br/>
