&gt; I read the other posts.. their close but not spot on.  Sir Lucan is on the<br/>
&gt; ground floor of the militia building.  AS you first enter it, hes at the<br/>
&gt; room at the far end of the first corridor - there is a second room past 2<br/>
&gt; guards.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The person you need to kill is not Altunic Jartin!  Its someone fishing near<br/>
&gt; a lake....  Steal his note and hand it in to the SK guild in freeport<br/>
&gt; instead of Sir Lucan - I&#39;m actually going to do it again to see what happens<br/>
&gt; if you give Lucan the note.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is Sir Lucan alone?  If so will he KOS me if I&#39;m KOS to the<br/>
militia?  I guess it&#39;s time to pay those orcs a visit again, or maybe<br/>
even the Paladins in N Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Now if getting Bloodsabre faction were only so easy...<br/>
