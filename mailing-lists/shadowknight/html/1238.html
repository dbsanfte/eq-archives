<b>Subject:</b> RE: Bayle List <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503484287">I hesitated to post a spoiler to the list to ruin it for those that want to<br/>
do it themselves. If people want me to post my results (and not many object.<br/>
:D) then I will.<br/>
<br/>
I WILL tell you that I got an actual item from the quest (handing in the<br/>
decoded list to Pietro Zarn) but it isn&#39;t that amazing. I *do* wish it fit<br/>
in my range slot so I could use the +15 vs magic bonus though. :)<br/>
<br/>
I never handed in the 3 encoded pieces to Kane Bayle -- a friend of mine<br/>
did, got a congrats and exp on the first two pieces, asking for the rest,<br/>
the he handed in the last, and got  .... &quot;thank you very much&quot; and no exp<br/>
etc. Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
will write more later</div>
