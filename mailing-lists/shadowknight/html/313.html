<div id="ygrps-yiv-740871451">Harm Touch should do a constant 10points per level regardless of my health.<br/>
Like wise LoH should only heal 10points per level.<br/>
<br/>
I as well only use it in an emergency (Say you are finishing off an Ork<br/>
Legionnaire and a Second Jumps you), but it is useless if you are anywhere<br/>
near matched to your first opponant, in which case you take a decent amount<br/>
of damage. Bang my Harm Touch does 30 points. Not much of an emergency<br/>
measure...<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Did you ever think about the fact that the harm touch description could be<br/>
intended to be read in a non-literal fashion.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that HT is somewhat weak. Though im not sure what to do about<br/>
it...I&#39;ve never had an HT resisted while fighting creatures 8-10 levels<br/>
above me.<br/>
<br/>
Really, I&#39;d like to see HT as a constant ability...One that decreases the<br/>
casters health and mana with each cast.<br/>

&gt;The pets we get , even though relatively weak, i have no complaints<br/>
&gt;about.<br/>
&gt;And i was never insinuating that Harm Touch should kill anything in one<br/>
&gt;hit. And if you count on HT to beat anything you attack, you get what<br/>
&gt;you deserve. BUT, thats no excuse for it not working, in my opinion. If<br/>
&gt;it works to its full potential and you still die, which has happened to<br/>
&gt;me, then so be it. But it should be something you can count on to at<br/>
&gt;least work when an emergency arises.<br/>
&gt;And in no way am i saying that SKs are powerless or have no potential.<br/>
&gt;However HT still is not the equal of LoH which its supposed to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regardless of our differences of opinion on this, i would like to know<br/>
&gt;what you feel would be an effective way to bring our concerns to the<br/>
&gt;Dev team, whatever they may be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for responding,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok, I can see your point with the Harm Touch.<br/>
&gt; &gt; However, I&#39;m at level 14 now and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; gave up usuing Harm Touch for anything but emergancy<br/>
&gt; &gt; purposes. Either to save<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself or as the mother of all taunts to save<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone else. If I don&#39;t think I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; win with my sword then I don&#39;t fight, I never think<br/>
&gt; &gt; well if I HT it, it will be an<br/>
&gt; &gt; even fight.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We must also remmeber that we get a pet. Woopee Doo!<br/>
&gt; &gt; You might think, it&#39;s a crap<br/>
&gt; &gt; one. But it does server many great uses. First, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; an extra attack during<br/>
&gt; &gt; battle, somewhat makingup for our lack of Duel<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wield. It&#39;s a great way to get rid<br/>
&gt; &gt; of those annoying rusty short swords, since it makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; the pet more effective. And<br/>
&gt; &gt; alos, it is a great delaying and early warning<br/>
&gt; &gt; device. My pet has saved me from<br/>
&gt; &gt; giants on a number of times.<br/>
