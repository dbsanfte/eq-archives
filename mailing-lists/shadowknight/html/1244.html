<div id="ygrps-yiv-245785236">Now..thru my many efforts, i have been unable to come<br/>
up with the corrct way to get the message from Tovax<br/>
(the necro that wanders Qeynos Hills) to get the<br/>
letter for Opal from Sragg.<br/>
Anyone know offhand what that is..or how to trigger<br/>
the series of events to get that from him.<br/>
<br/>
I have spoken to every NPC in the Shrine of<br/>
Bertoxxulous many, many times and completed every<br/>
quest given to me, but just havent come across it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
