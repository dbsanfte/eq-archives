<b>Subject:</b> Re: Vampiric embrace or lifetap? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020594672">All in all I think it would be.  Vampiric embrace for an SK right now <br/>
doesn&#39;t replace that much health and is a random event.  Lifetap can be cast <br/>
when we need to replace hp.  Generally Rangers and Paladians can cast heals <br/>
mainly after combat and SK&#39;s have a huge downtowntime as a result.<br/>
<br/>
Right now if I play without a healer type in the party VE is the only way to <br/>
get HP back (other then bandaging after the fact).  And when it does go off, <br/>
it really seems to piss off the mob and then they hit me for twice as much <br/>
as I just embraced for.  ouchie!<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
Let me ask this -- if Vampiric Embrace was replaced with a Lifetap, would <br/>
that be considered an improvement?<br/>
