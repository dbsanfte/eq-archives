<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595745876">ok, somehow you can get a ring of the dead from the lodge of the dead in<br/>
neriak. apparently this ring has one charge of bind affinity, allowing<br/>
even non-spellcasters to bind wherever they want. AND it is<br/>
rechargeable! my big question is, which npc in the guild gives this<br/>
ring, and what quest do you have to run to get it? by the way, the<br/>
female shopkeeper downstairs DOESNT give them, she just recharges. any<br/>
info would be helpful :)<br/>
