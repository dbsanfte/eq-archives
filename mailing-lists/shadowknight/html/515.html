<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787237298">I am an Innoruuk worshipping Shadowknight so I am not particularly welcomed<br/>
in Qeynos (um, does this have anything to do with the 20 or so guards I have<br/>
killed? Heh) but I was wondering, do all the Grimrot quests originate in<br/>
Qeynos, or can I just talk to Grimrot himself? I&#39;m currently in S Karana<br/>
anyways, but can&#39;t ever seem to catch him. I have no idea who this Arlena is<br/>
but I hope to find out soon if I can ever catch this guy. :)<br/>
<br/>
How many SK quests are there in Qeynos and are there any that are worth it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
