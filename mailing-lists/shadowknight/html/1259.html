&gt; Non Dark Elfs probably won&#39;t like this as much, but it looks as though the<br/>
&gt; Guise is no longer dropping. There is a new mask dropping that gives the<br/>
&gt; same effect but must be worn to be used. As a Dark Elf I love this change,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s nice to get some of my identity back..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, most Ogres and Trolls are furious about this, but I see it as<br/>
a bug fix.  Any item that is limited to who can use it should be.  I<br/>
really, really hated this item, as it made my choice of race pointless.<br/>
Ultravision and looking cool (IMO) were my rewards for being shunned<br/>
in 90% of the world, and at the same time having neither incredible<br/>
stats,<br/>
slam, or regen.  Not to mention how much I hate Paladins with the guise<br/>
and an obsidian flamberge or razing sword looking exactly like me.<br/>
