<div id="ygrps-yiv-674735572">Thought of one issue with a Harm Shield type spell (for me at least), I<br/>
commonly group with either a Mage or a Druid (I will be in a group with one<br/>
of these at least 90% of the time). And honestly their Harm Shields work a<br/>
hell of a lot better than anything we will be given. I would rather see a<br/>
ATK increasing spell (like Grim Aura, etc) or another type of DOT (Poison<br/>
Bolt perhaps).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just something I thought of.<br/>
