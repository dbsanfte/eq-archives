<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984758523">Greetings all!<br/>
I am an Officer in the &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt; guild on <br/>
Bertoxxulous.  We are a new guild, about 3 weeks old <br/>
now, and the highest member is currently 19th. I believe <br/>
I am the next highest in the guild at the moment.  <br/>
Why am I telling you this?  Many reasons actually. <br/>
First we are in need of more members as we have 17 right <br/>
now. <br/>
Second I don&#39;t want you to have any presumptions before <br/>
attempting to join.<br/>
Third we are tyring to make our presence known in <br/>
Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
We are in the charter building stage, and have just <br/>
formed our Council of Elders. If anyone has experience <br/>
with the workings of a guild and positions like <br/>
Treasurer, please send me some advise that has been <br/>
beneficial.<br/>
Also where is a good place to host a guild webpage? <br/>
Geocities and any other that throws those stupid java <br/>
windows and &quot;a word from our sponsor&quot; messages suck, and <br/>
log my browser down, so I refuse to use those. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
In other news, I took a break from EQ this weekend and <br/>
only played a little on Friday night and long enough on <br/>
Sautrday for the guild meeting. I hope to level to 13th <br/>
soon as I am half way there.  I would have made it <br/>
already, but I was helping my wife level in Nektulos <br/>
Forrest Friday from 4th to 8th.  We didn&#39;t group and I <br/>
used Taunt, Slam and Siphon Strength while she took out <br/>
Red cons and got 1/2 a bubble of XP per creature. Most <br/>
of these were Even and Blue to me. <br/>
I died 3 times because of that damn Orc Runner in 45 <br/>
minutes.  Took me the rest of the night to get that XP <br/>
loss back too.<br/>
<br/>
Any and all feedback welcome for guild info/advise, <br/>
thanks.<br/>
<br/>
