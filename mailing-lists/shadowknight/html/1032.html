<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299781603">Hmm, if this is true I think the word I&#39;m looking for is disappointed.<br/>
Oh well, since it doesn&#39;t look like I&#39;m going to bother with the BP quest<br/>
(maybe some of the others though depending on stats) I would like to know<br/>
has anybody got the Chest Plate of the Dark Flame here, and if so how hard<br/>
of a camp is it? Is the Chest Plate the Rare or Common?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about time I upgraded my Charred BP and it&#39;s between this and the DE<br/>
BP, but being a Dark Elf I would like the added str the Dark Flame gives..<br/>
So much for my MM faction.. <br/>
<br/>
Oh on a side note, I stopped by Cazic over the weekend and it actually had<br/>
more people then it used to (Lots of people farming Ravenscale, plus the<br/>
most SK&#39;s I&#39;ve ever seen in one place). Makes me remember why I swore I&#39;d<br/>
never go back there...<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy..<br/>
