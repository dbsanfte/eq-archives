&gt; I&#39;ll be 50 in 2 weeks or so, bout halfway through 48<br/>
&gt; now. I have a couple<br/>
&gt; questions  regarding the quest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.) The necro says to conceal your dark arts. this<br/>
&gt; mean you have to have a<br/>
&gt; non-necro&#92;sk to do this part?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Need a druid to cast wolf form on you. The guy you get<br/>
the faceted hycinth from along with the Dragonscale<br/>
armor guy, who is in the same hut, are KoS to SKs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.) can a group of 40-50s take the monstrous zombie<br/>
&gt; that spawns? or will I<br/>
&gt; need 2 groups?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We did it easily with 1 group. A cleric is a must<br/>
though. I got FEARd by him and ended up bugged. The<br/>
FEAR had worn off, but i kept running anyway. I could<br/>
sit down to stop running, but as soon as i stood, i<br/>
started running again. I had to camp out, but they<br/>
beat him even without me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.) why the heck are we getting more nerftaps in the<br/>
&gt; expansion when we<br/>
&gt; already have lifeleech?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lifeleech has a 2 minute recast time, and takes about<br/>
2 bubbles of mana to cast. Sometimes you just dont<br/>
need that much, or you would rather cast faster<br/>
spells. Just like any good cleric has multiple Heals<br/>
mem&#39;d and not just Complete Heal.<br/>
<br/>
