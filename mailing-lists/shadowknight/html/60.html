<b>Subject:</b> re on the tomahawk <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873855999">i fear that i cannot disclose the exact location of the tomahawk, for we<br/>
have all sworn a solemn oath not to give out its location to anyone! (this<br/>
would likely cause a major rampage and flood said area with a hideous number<br/>
of people camping for it). personally i only found it through luck (if you<br/>
can call being killed by its wielder luck :)) and when we came back to get<br/>
revenge.. well, we were greatly surprised. <br/>
<br/>
the stats on this thing are 1hs, 6 damage, 26 delay, magical attack, and<br/>
casts &#39;berserker strength&#39; randomly during a fight. it also weighs 6.5<br/>
pounds, and can be used by pretty much any of the melee combat-oriented<br/>
classes. the berserker strength is defined as follows: it adds 19 str,<br/>
subtracts 10 agi, and while you are affected you are INVULNERABLE to melee<br/>
damage. i am not kidding, you actually become partially invincible while<br/>
this is in effect! the downside is that this effect is cast randomly during<br/>
combat (you may be affected 5 times in one fight or not at all), and the<br/>
effect is very shortlived and chaotic.. i&#39;ve seen it last almost 2 minutes<br/>
one time, and fade almost instantaneously another. even with that drawback<br/>
tho, imagine a warrior dual wielding a pair of these and sinking into<br/>
berserk fury range.. you can almost see the blood fly. just imagine a<br/>
magical dwarven battle axe that casts divine aura and a strengthen on<br/>
steroids, and you get the picture.<br/>
<br/>
now, while i really cant tell you the exact location, i WILL say that this<br/>
weapon is always wielded by a gnoll named Grenix Mucktail.  for<br/>
well-traveled shadow knights this should be ample information for you to<br/>
begin your hunt, but others may have to explore a bit before they figure out<br/>
where he may be located ;) good hunting, and may all who stand in your path<br/>
feel the rage of Innoruuk!<br/>
