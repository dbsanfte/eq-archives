<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-327426139">This may be a repeat, but It came back to me with a failure notice.<br/>
<br/>
Brian,<br/>
I noticed the patch only implemented a few spells in the Lifetap series... why <br/>
the huge gap between level 15 and level 30 for the next Lifetap upgrade?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With that said, I for one am very happy with the change in spells Verant made <br/>
today. I finally have a way to heal myself in combat, even if it is only for a <br/>
few points. <br/>
I have come very close to death many times while solo and this change is very <br/>
welcome.<br/>
