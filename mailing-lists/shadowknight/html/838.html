<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150313270">I have never actually tried this quest, but from what I <br/>
have seen on all the spoiler quests this quest is <br/>
broken. Have you asked a GM online if it is fixed?  I <br/>
would hate to see you waste time gaining much needed XP <br/>
on a quest that doesn&#39;t work.  <br/>
Normally the GMs are actually nice enough to tell you if <br/>
a quest is broken or not. :)<br/>
