<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899757285">I&#39;ve made the following observations thus far with my ShadowKnight:<br/>
<br/>
Dodge Capped at 25<br/>
Bash and Taunt capped at 30<br/>
parry & riposte capped at 35<br/>
<br/>
Other then offense/defense and weapon skills (and magic), nothing is <br/>
improving.  Only main things to look forward to are: New spells at 39, New <br/>
Skill at 40 (disarm) and new spells at 49. (I hear that weapon skills cap at <br/>
200 (ie level 39).<br/>
<br/>
My question is this, since we&#39;re based on Warriors and Necros, why don&#39;t we <br/>
ever get Dual Wield?  Some people say that we&#39;re the Anti-Paladin, but other <br/>
then HT, I see no other real opposites (and as to why paladains don&#39;t get it <br/>
either, I don&#39;t know).  I understand why paladins don&#39;t get kick, but since <br/>
we&#39;re the evil opposite you figure we would.<br/>
<br/>
But Warriors, Rangers, Rogues, Bards, Monks ALL get dual wield.  Why don&#39;t <br/>
SK&#39;s?  Now I&#39;m curious.  Paladins get awesome 1h slash weapons, and it would <br/>
be WAY too powerful for them to wield 2 weapons with a ghoul bane and some <br/>
other combo.  But SK&#39;s never do get anything like that.  So why can&#39;t we <br/>
have something nice to play with like that?<br/>
