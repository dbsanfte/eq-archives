I cackle maniacly and whack them in the back... then someone roots<br/>

I don&#39;t understand how Verant has come up with their this spell<br/>
overrides<br/>
that one tables.  IMO, it should be first on stays.  Then at least I<br/>

Darkness is my most used spell, I want it back the way it was before<br/>
the &quot;spell did not hold&quot; patch.  Or did it always get cancelled<br/>
and just give no message?<br/>
