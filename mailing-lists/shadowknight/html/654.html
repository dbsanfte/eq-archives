Really?  Oops.  Haven&#39;t looked at in a while. My bad.<br/>
Thanks for the update.  :)  <br/>
Why then would anyone want 1 HS? We don&#39;t get Dual <br/>
Wield, but do get Double Attack.  Is there a 1HS weapon <br/>
that does alot of damage?  The highest I&#39;ve seen is a <br/>
Crystalline Blade at 11 damage (besides Ghoulbane at 15 <br/>
damage). <br/>
Anyone on this list use a weapon other than a 2HS?  How <br/>
does it compare to damage done by MOBS at higher level? <br/>
Is it good as a solo adventurer? <br/>
I sent out a website that lists SK weapons, but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t tell you that a 12 damage sword with a strength <br/>
of 124 will do 25 max damage at 12th level with 2HS <br/>
maxed. :)<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
