Archery and Shadowknight<br/>
<br/>
What does everyone think?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think we make great archers for many reasons. It rounds out our<br/>
distences ( with out spells)  so that we can more fulfil the back and<br/>
support roles if we have lots of tanks in the group. If we have to stand<br/>
back due to to much damange (usually because we disease the target) then<br/>
we can still hit the target and contribute. I myself have a lovely rough<br/>
Elm bow, and a skill of 45+ so I quite consistantly hit for 14 damage,<br/>
which is quite good for someone who is sitting back and healing. When we<br/>
get out pets, we can let teh pet tank for us while we archer away. The<br/>
pet will no doubt die, but then we don&#39;t have to split the xp for it :)<br/>
<br/>
The downside is of course the cost. There is very little chance of<br/>
taking up fletching due to Rangers totally dominating that trade and<br/>
quite disliking SK&#39;s. However you will easily be able to buy a bow from<br/>
them, mine cost 5p, and there is one slightly lesser bow for 2p. Arrows<br/>
can usually be bought for about 9c each, which is quite resonable. But<br/>
it will take a lot of effort. I must have gone thruogh close to 1000<br/>
arrows by now, but I beleive it has been worth it.<br/>
<br/>
What does everyone else think? Any other experiences?</div>
