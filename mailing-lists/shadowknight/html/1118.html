The only 2 ways i have found that raise his faction,<br/>
is the Trumpy thing (takes several hundred Honey Meads<br/>
to raise faction by one step), or turn in the Bayle<br/>
List parts.<br/>
<br/>
Even when i turned in just part one, i gained faction<br/>
with him. And he was actually first on the faction<br/>
list, as opposed to being last in the Trumpy one.<br/>
Since the first part of the Bayle List is the easiest<br/>
to get, i recommend doing it whenever you happen to<br/>
run thru HH.<br/>
However, if you turn in part one, then try to turn it<br/>
in again, he may not care, since he still &quot;has&quot; it.<br/>
All 3 may have to be given in order for you to be able<br/>
to get faction from just the first again.<br/>
<br/>
Worth some experimenting with though.<br/>

&gt; Other than getting Trumpy Irontoe drunk, is there<br/>
