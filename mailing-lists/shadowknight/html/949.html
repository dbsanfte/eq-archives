<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642750694"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As suggested previously, con them...if they give you<br/>
&gt; anything other than indifferent, they can see you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep. I know that. Just wondering how reliable it is generally for guards.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Gather Shadows is REALLY flaky. Maybe i just have bad<br/>
&gt; luck, but it will wear off sometimes even before the<br/>
&gt; spell effects are finished swirling around me. And in<br/>
&gt; some places, its just horrible. In N Ro, oasis, and S<br/>
&gt; Ro, im lucky if it lasts 30 seconds. Cazic Thule and<br/>
&gt; Guk also dont treat my invis with much respect.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ugh. Sounds like fun. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would STRONGLY suggest against binding in Oggok.<br/>
&gt; Ogers dont like humans regardless of the fact that we<br/>
&gt; are SKs. And the Bouncers see thru Shadows all the<br/>
&gt; time. Plus remember that when you hit your bind point,<br/>
&gt; its usually after youre dead. No spells, no Invis at<br/>
&gt; all. So if for some strange reason an Orge is near<br/>
&gt; your Bind point, you may get stuck in a very nasty<br/>
&gt; death/spawn/death loop. No pretty.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah. I&#39;ve considered this. I plan on scouting out the towns a little bit to<br/>
see if there is a safe place ... perhaps on top of that little tower thingie<br/>
near the zone in Grobb? If I can get up there it should be safe from guards.<br/>
Again ... this will require testing. But I would gladly test it for a couple<br/>
hours for the chance to save me a half hour run after every death.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Feign death. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I plan on testing this and practicing this. As I said, being the<br/>
(usually) only non-gater in my group can be troublesome when we are deep in<br/>
guk (or heck, even trying to do the thex mallet quest in befallen and get<br/>
trained ... that wasn&#39;t fun. Dying from greens stinks!).<br/>
<br/>
later,<br/>
