<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506609120">I have seen many posts that have Brad McQuaid (or <br/>
however you spell his name :) ) saying that there are <br/>
hidden items all over Norrath that have yet to be <br/>
discovered. It also says that when enough people <br/>
discover them, they will be made available to all <br/>
players. <br/>
This leads me to believe that &quot;possibly&quot; this 49th level <br/>
#7 SK only spell may fall in that group. I guess we just <br/>
need to go to Fear and kill Cazic-Thule. Heh.  Hmmm. I <br/>
think I would get a massive faction hit on that one. :)<br/>
Brian if you are still out there, could you shed some <br/>
light on this?<br/>

&gt; There may indeed be hidden spells for all hybrids, or <br/>
&gt; maybe they were in development and got dropped, but <br/>
&gt; left in the file there.  I wonder if maybe they will<br/>
&gt; be added to the Temple of Solusek as quest only spells?  <br/>
