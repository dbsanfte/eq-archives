<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111902233">To answer Brian&#39;s question, yes I definitely think a Lifetap would be better<br/>
than VE, but at the same time I&#39;d rather we kept VE and simply threw the<br/>
pets out the window in exchange for weaker lifetaps. One thing everyone here<br/>
seems to agree on is that the pets are simply a mess, far too weak, etc, and<br/>
it would be hard to complain (and damn we&#39;ve been complaining forever) if we<br/>
finally had some USEFUL AS HELL spells. I mean paladins get healing, rangers<br/>
also get healing, both because the class they come from (Cleric or Druid)<br/>
has those lines. What are necros famous for? The lifetap line, and yet sks<br/>
can&#39;t use a single one, aside from one which randomly goes off when you<br/>
slash, and therefore can only be minimally effective. This would let us heal<br/>
(tho in a different way) and at least I&#39;d feel like there was a lot more<br/>
balance if that were the case. I also don&#39;t see why it would be so<br/>
dreadfully unbalanced if us sks could use these lifetap spells, especially<br/>
since rangers get raw DD spells and raw heal spells, and yet here we are<br/>
sitting with par dots and useless pets (and no buffs I might add). As much<br/>
as I love Verant, I can&#39;t help but think that the SK class was one of the<br/>
last created and therefore a little rushed, some of the things we have just<br/>
seem to make no sense when compared with what the other hybrids (our target<br/>
of comparion).<br/>
If you like details this is an idea that&#39;s been floating around my head for<br/>
a long time now:<br/>
<br/>
Rank 1- Toss Leering Corpse, Replace with Lifetap (the level ONE necro spell<br/>
that steals 4-5 hp, less than minor healing)<br/>
        Toss Reclaim Energy, Replace with Cold Light (even tho this would be<br/>
largely useless Reclaim Energy DEFINES useless)<br/>
<br/>
Rank 2- Toss Bone Walk, Replace with either a lifetap (maybe not tho, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to be unbalanced), or a line we don&#39;t     	  have at all like<br/>
Grim Aura.<br/>
	  Toss Mend Bones, Replace with Poison Bolt (not great, but beats another<br/>
useless one)<br/>
<br/>
Other Ranks- Toss the pets, replace with X. Well when I got my rank 3 spells<br/>
for the first time I was actually satisfied with what I had for the vast<br/>
most part (being a dark elf I didn&#39;t need Deadeye but realize that the<br/>
humans do etc). Rank 3 is also the last one I&#39;ve seen so I can&#39;t really<br/>
suggest for the others without having tested them, although something that<br/>
seems obvious at the moment is that Shieldskin at 39 can&#39;t be too useful<br/>
(casters are using that at 16). Another thing I&#39;ve noticed is that our final<br/>
rank seems to be incomplete (only 5 spells?) and that one of them is a<br/>
virtual clone of Deadeye (what&#39;s up with Shadow Sight?). That final rank<br/>
needs to be changed if any do. The bottom line is that whatever final<br/>
decisions are made, the SK class simply is not complete in it&#39;s current<br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
Well was that a rant? I guess so, but oh well it felt good =)</div>
