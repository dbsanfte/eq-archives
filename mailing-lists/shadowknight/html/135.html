<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155210738">maybe you should have tried a different SK...maybe a troll for pure<br/>
power...or a Dark Elf for the casting abilities.  I also don&#39;t doubt that<br/>
eventually SK&#39;s will be powered up a little.  You played a human...a<br/>
little stronger but limited magically.  Maybe if you tried a different<br/>
race you might have found more satisfaction.  I can&#39;t express how much I<br/>
love being a DE SK.  Not only for the evil nature I get to play...but also<br/>
the fact that when I get spells...i will get alot...not to mention that<br/>
your training and weapon skills have alot to do with how well your<br/>
character does.  Just because the SK isn&#39;t the most powerfull<br/>
class...doesn&#39;t mean its a bad class.  You played one race up to<br/>
10....thats hardly anywhere in the world.  <br/>
