<br/>
And just a quick poll of my own -- How many troll/ogre SKs do we have here?<br/>
I&#39;m a dark elf, and I know Cro is a troll. What about the rest of you guys?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>True, but in a DUNGEON situation, where you WILL be after say level 30,<br/>
there aren&#39;t any gnolls or orcs just wandering around waiting to be<br/>
vampired. So the only things you could lifetap would be those mobs that<br/>
you&#39;re actually fighting. And then you get back into the pull-back-to-cast<br/>
tactic that so many of us despise. I&#39;m still pushing for damage shields. :)<br/>
