&gt; &gt; My question to you all, is this:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Does this sound like a bug? The part of him going<br/>
&gt; &gt; Aggro on anyone instead of just the one who was<br/>
&gt; &gt; fighting a Najena Inhabitant?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bug, but it does make it DAMN hard to get to the UK and<br/>
&gt; have a decent conversation with him. The way Beld did it was he met up with<br/>
&gt; one of my guild&#39;s clerics (Ternada) and after they cleared the necros, the<br/>
&gt; cleric put a soothe-type spell (don&#39;t remember the cleric version&#39;s name) on<br/>
&gt; the UK and then Beld talked to him. Also, consider bringing along an<br/>
&gt; enchanter to mes the necros and/or mindwipe the UK after you kill the<br/>
&gt; necros.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t feel it should be this hard to get to our quest giver, let alone<br/>
&gt; have him attack US. Anyway, /feedback or /petition it, I dunno. You CAN talk<br/>
&gt; to the UK, but you definitely need some help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

So I imagine that this is a bug, that they changed something when<br/>
they bumped his level.  I was not attacked even though I was killing<br/>
Drelzna and the necros in front of him.  (Yes, Drelzna still spawns<br/>
in that room)<br/>
