<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630755345">well, i didnt say voice graft was USEFUL, i said it was just great<br/>
entertainment :) a lot of people dont realize that you can make things other<br/>
than your pet speak with it. summon pet, cast voice graft on it, then click<br/>
on ANY npc that is within speaking range and just say something. the npc<br/>
will speak instead of you. this is great fun in many cases, especially since<br/>
you get invis at the same time. (try sitting next to a guard in a town and<br/>
have him start barking orders at a newbie who walks by. call out to people<br/>
by name and watch them scratch their heads in confusion :D).<br/>
<br/>
VE starts doing 12 damage at lvl 22, and the damage increases 1 point every<br/>
other level. so at lvl 30 you are draining 16 life every time it hits, and<br/>
by 50 you are draining 26 points. this doesnt sound like much.. but remember<br/>
this is in ADDITION to whatever damage you do with your weapon, and those<br/>
points can quickly bridge the disparity between 1h and 2h weapons, since it<br/>
will go off more often with 1h attacks. while it isnt the greatest spell in<br/>
the world, its the first practical buff we get, so go ahead and use it when<br/>
you get the opportunity.<br/>
