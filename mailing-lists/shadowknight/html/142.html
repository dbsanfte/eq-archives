<div id="ygrps-yiv-752769646">You make good points, and I alluded to some of those in my post -- I&#39;m a<br/>
great damage sponge, and that seems to be what you&#39;ve offered as your best<br/>
skill to your party. :-)<br/>
<br/>
However, I want to contribute actively -- and there&#39;s not many ways I can<br/>
do that unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
The image of an SK standing there taking damage while others do the &quot;real&quot;<br/>
work seems out of whack with what an SK should be.<br/>
<br/>
I may stick it out with the SK a bit longer, if for no other reason than it<br/>
lets me tag along with my friends a bit more and I can thus check out some<br/>
cool new locales (I just did the Qeynos-&gt;Freeport run last night, and I&#39;d<br/>
hate to quit now).<br/>
<br/>
I do think that my next character will be a ranger though, if I feel like<br/>
going through the tedium of levelling up.  <br/>
