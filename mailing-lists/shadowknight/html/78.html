<div id="ygrps-yiv-705018310">The higher the level of the creature that you attack....you skill will go<br/>
up better.  It also depends on your intelligence.  You are a dark elf so<br/>
it should go up relatively quickly.  Also if the skill is real low....like<br/>
i never trained in Taunt...now that I am fighting red and white /con&#39;s it<br/>
soars.  Same I assume with most skills related to fighting.  I would say<br/>
swing one handed against an even critter until you knock it down a good<br/>
ways...then switch to 2Hslashing and see if you can&#39;t work it up.<br/>
