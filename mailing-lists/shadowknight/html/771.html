<div id="ygrps-yiv-172709064">When I got my DR I stopped using Siphon as well (since the DR does more than<br/>
the spell does, doesn&#39;t make much sense to use it). <br/>
<br/>
I have no clue on how much wave does, since you don&#39;t get any off it (if you<br/>
do I didn&#39;t notice - Shaman are nice to have around as well btw). I&#39;ve cast<br/>
wave a few times, but again the whole AE thing is only good if you want to<br/>
see how much damage you can take in the shortest amount of time possible.<br/>
(Hint: Never test it on 4 Greater Minos. Really bad idea. At least they left<br/>
the cleric alone long enough to kill me :)<br/>

&gt; As for running out of Mana (My Int is 115 btw), I actually can quite<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, that statement was made based on level 29, since I haven&#39;t <br/>
played much at level 30.  I&#39;m sure with Heat Blood I can chew through<br/>
some mana even faster.  I have a 113 Int, more if my guild jeweler<br/>
gets a little better<br/>
<br/>
Question on Wave of Enfeeblement - how much does it siphon?  Is<br/>
anyone else using this?  I have a Dark Reaver so I switched to it<br/>
instead of siphon and rely on the proc to raise my str.  Casting<br/>
time on Wave is pretty long it seems.<br/>
<br/>
I saved myself with feign for the first time last night, the<br/>
casting time seemed reasonable to me (since I lived).<br/>
