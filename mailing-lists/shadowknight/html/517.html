<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-949625339">I&#39;m a DE Shadowknight and I&#39;ve been considering trying out the kerra<br/>
island fire beetle quest.  Have any other DE SKs tried this?  I&#39;m<br/>
interested in how you were able to get out to Kerra island.  I have a<br/>
feeling that I&#39;ll be KOS in Quenos.  Is there a way to get to Kerra<br/>
island without going through Quenos?  Is there some sort of way through<br/>
Quenos similar to the sewers in freeport that is safe for DEs?  I&#39;d<br/>
love to hear from anyone who&#39;s done this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
