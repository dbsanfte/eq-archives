<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317626657">It&#39;s been a very long time since I&#39;ve posted to this<br/>
list.  I started a shadowknight on Bertoxulous and got<br/>
him to 16 when I left to restart on Tallon.  I&#39;ve<br/>
moved Atrocity up to level 31 on Tallon, and also have<br/>
a level 16 wiz there, just for fun.  <br/>
<br/>
I know that we have a lot of seasoned shadowknights on<br/>
this list, and there were many times when I read the<br/>
posts thinking, oh, this will be useful when I&#39;m<br/>
30+...<br/>
<br/>
Well, the big challenge for me right now is Darkforged<br/>
Armor.  I&#39;m getting ready to move into Cazic Thule to<br/>
start collecting this.  I&#39;ve already picked up 2<br/>
pieces of melatite, 1 fairy dust, and 1 Qeynos shield,<br/>
so I really need to work on the decayed drops.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have some good tips for me on getting this<br/>
stuff?  I&#39;ve heard that the 4 corners spot through the<br/>
maze is the most likely place to find the crusaders. <br/>
When I look at this on the map, I get shivers.  From<br/>
what I can tell it looks like if anything goes wrong<br/>
in there and you&#39;re not a class that can gate, you&#39;ve<br/>
had it.  I just can&#39;t see anyone running from 4<br/>
corners all the way through the maze and making it to<br/>
the zone.  I don&#39;t have a wiz in my party, so group<br/>
evac isn&#39;t much of an option.  I know that I can try<br/>
feign and invis, but this still makes me nervous.<br/>
<br/>
Any and all advice on acquiring decayed armor is<br/>
greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
PS. for sol b and fire giants, the best info I&#39;ve see<br/>
is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://monks.volitionx.com/monkzones.htm">http://monks.volitionx.com/monkzones.htm</a> it&#39;s<br/>
amazingly good for a monk.<br/>

&gt; ago and this thread is<br/>
&gt; the first one i have received so I&#39;ll introduce<br/>
&gt; myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just got 47 with Squiggles, My Troll SK on Vallon<br/>
&gt; Zek. I am the leader of<br/>
&gt; &lt;Da Bashin&#39; Iggles&gt;. My guild and our allies are<br/>
&gt; preparing for a dragon<br/>
&gt; raid in a month at the max. Tried Fire Giants for<br/>
&gt; the first time on<br/>
&gt; Saturday night, did ok on the first 3, but got<br/>
&gt; massacred after that. Anyone<br/>
&gt; got any tips on FG&#39;s, dragons, or breaking into the<br/>
&gt; Planes? Pulling<br/>
&gt; locations for FG&#39;s would be most beneficial at this<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me remind you that this is Race War PvP server<br/>
&gt; so we are an al evil<br/>
&gt; team guild, as are our allies. So we don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; bards or monks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thanks in advance,<br/>
