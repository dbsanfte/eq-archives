<div id="ygrps-yiv-927480323">*I&#39;ve seen one skeleton pet, but don&#39;t think<br/>
*that should be my first target.<br/>
*<br/>
*I&#39;ve seen the 3 ghouls, and one that parades<br/>
*around The Lodge of the Dead, are these<br/>
*the equivilent of rats, bats and snakes in Freeport?<br/>
<br/>
*chuckle*  Try to /con them.  You will find they all judge you amiably.<br/>
Plus, the skeleton pets are created by the ShadowKnight NPC Guards.  Plus,<br/>
the Ghouls, if you notice, are standing guard or patrolling around the Lodge<br/>
of the Dead. <br/>
<br/>
Our Teir&#39;Dal brethren created these automatons of the undead as our<br/>
protectors and keepers, not as our target practice.</div>
