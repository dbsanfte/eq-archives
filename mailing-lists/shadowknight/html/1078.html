<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715502360">Interestingly enough I saw a post on the Paladin armor, where the Armor<br/>
itself is a white except for the Gloves and Boots which are gold, so it is<br/>
possible that our new armor is a mixture of black and red (which it appears<br/>
to be). Those Vambraces do have nice stats and would be a nice piece until<br/>
Mithril or Umbral. I am curious on the color of it though, I just don&#39;t want<br/>
any red armor (I know I&#39;m picky).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious though you have a SS of the BP are the stats what have been<br/>
rumored with the bonus given to STA (would would make like 3 different Sk<br/>
armor pieces that give a STA increase).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy..<br/>

From what ive seen it drops off of every Crusader now.<br/>
My dificulty, and it does seem to be me alone, is that<br/>
i cant seem to kill any Crusaders.<br/>
<br/>
I have been at the Archon, simply because there are<br/>
maybe 5 spots he has a chance to spawn in as opposed<br/>
to one in UTR and AoF. Well, after 16 hours of temple<br/>
hunting, we killed 4 Crusaders. Meanwhile a friend<br/>
spent about 4 hours in UTR and got 6.<br/>
<br/>
And i may add that all the parts that dropped in the<br/>
temple were pepeats or items i didnt care to get and<br/>
therefore passed them off to another SK who did want<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is simply my bad luck and apparently not<br/>
the situation with most.<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to actually get a pair of anything *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
Anyway a friend got the vambracers. Pretty good stats<br/>
for a change.<br/>
<br/>
9AC<br/>
4STR<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what it looked like.<br/>
<br/>
But i do have a SS of the Darkforge BP and it is<br/>
indeed black.<br/>
I will upload it to my site later on and post a link<br/>
then.<br/>
