<div id="ygrps-yiv-44816090">When running through Innothule Swamp I have been <br/>
attacked by 3 NPCs. A Human Female, a Dwarf Male, and a <br/>
High Elf Male.<br/>
They dropped Novle Crests (no clue what to do with them) <br/>
and gave me faction adjustments with their race, all <br/>
negative- duh!- but the High Elf gave me Indigo <br/>
Brotherhood faction increase.<br/>
Is there a Wood Elf that runs around the swamp too? Does <br/>
it give SK bonuses?<br/>
Also, kiling a certain type of Orc... Crushbone ones I <br/>
think, gives negative DE faction.  I think a DE Guild <br/>
Leader, not sure which one said something about an <br/>
alliance with them when my wife&#39;s DE tried to get a <br/>
quest started... hence that damn Orc Runner that keeps <br/>
getting me killed in Nektulos Forrest!<br/>
<br/>
More food for thought. :)<br/>

&gt;I heard there was only one way to increase faction<br/>
&gt; with the SKs in Neriak. That is to kill the Wood Elf<br/>
&gt; captives in Crushbone.<br/>
