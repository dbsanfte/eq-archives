<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291476293">Crusaders are Damn tough.  I&#39;ve seen some level 50 SK&#39;s try and solo them, <br/>
and they got their asses handed to them.  they&#39;re on steroids.<br/>
Plus they&#39;re SK&#39;s also.  They like to generally open with Harm Touch.<br/>
<br/>
Lowest level one I&#39;ve seen was level 36.............<br/>

&gt;So, what level are they, and how hard are they to find within Cazic-Thule?<br/>
&gt;Good thing about the mistmoore faction BTW, although I&#39;d still like to get<br/>
&gt;it up in case one of the inhabitants ends up being the key to an sk sword<br/>
&gt;etc...<br/>
