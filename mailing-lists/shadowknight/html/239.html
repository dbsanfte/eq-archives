<div id="ygrps-yiv-158671063">Hello fellow ShadowKnights,<br/>
<br/>
    Well I finally hit level 22 and ran to get my new spells. First off<br/>
maybe I have real bad luck but I couldnt cast convoke shadow to save my<br/>
life! I burnt up 20 bonechips and got no pet. Ok so I move on to my next new<br/>
fav. spell I was looking foward to Engulfing Darkness.  I casted this spell<br/>
on myself alot of times and it only lasted for a few sec. I really dont see<br/>
me catching any mob like I could with clinging darkness it just wears off<br/>
WAY to fast and it did about 30dmg total time it was on. I petitioned that<br/>
one and the guy told me they did do a big change to those series of darkness<br/>
spells so he noted it to be checked out.  Now for Vampiric embrace I only<br/>
tested this spell fighting rats and stuff but in the whole time fighting I<br/>
never did the random lifetap they put in.  Either I need to fight stronger<br/>
stuff or they got the random lifetap to like 20% chance of success :- /    .<br/>
The only spells im happy to be using so far is Deadeye and Ward Undead(which<br/>
im still practicing and failing alot).<br/>
