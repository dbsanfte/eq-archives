<div id="ygrps-yiv-795824746">First, let me say thank you for the responces.<br/>
I was feeling depressed a while ago, which happens to me <br/>
every now and then, but I am not clinical. Heh.<br/>
<br/>
I guess when I look at Cronik, I feel limited in what I <br/>
can do. Granted, this is the purpose with a very <br/>
powerful class.  <br/>
<br/>
I like the powerhouse that he is, but all the zone <br/>
crossing and limited bind points are frustrating. I will <br/>
figure something out.<br/>
Again thanks for your support. :)<br/>

&gt;I am starting to have that itch again.  I think I am not<br/>
&gt;enjoying my Troll anymore.  Since I started playing my<br/>
&gt;Druid, I dread getting on as my troll. But I can&#39;t put<br/>
&gt;my finger on why. I haven&#39;t played Cronik in a week or<br/>
&gt;so.<br/>
&gt;I have /played my Druid for &lt;14 hours and am 2 bubs into<br/>
&gt;6th level.  I guess I have learned how to level rather<br/>
&gt;quickly with my class of choice.  This may be slow to<br/>
&gt;some, but for me it is astronomically fast.<br/>
&gt;I am in the middle of a mental debate on whether or not<br/>
&gt;to scrap him, sell everything, run to my druid, die and<br/>
&gt;leave him a big inheritance.<br/>
&gt;Anyone else run into this problem of character ping-pong?<br/>
&gt;Things at home are also very stressed, so that isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;helping either.<br/>
&gt;Thanks.<br/>
