<b>Subject:</b> Re: dodge.. turned into a Fletching question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234433087">Well I am a Dark Elf and forgot about it (oops) and I am now lvl 11.  I have<br/>
been running into damage problems from creatures hitting me so hard.  I have<br/>
a complete set of leather and was thinking I needed better armor to get to a<br/>
higher level because they creatures keep hitting me so hard.  Maybe not now.<br/>
Anyway now I have started Blacksmithing (up to 6 ya!) maybe I can postpone<br/>
it for now until I get some more pp (cost is just below 1.5pp per skill<br/>
point so far without selling the bits).  And still haven&#39;t gotten any<br/>
movement/improvement out of my Archery skill.  And now looking for Fletching<br/>
supplies in Netrick to build my own Arrows/Bows.<br/>
<br/>
Does any one know where the book for Fletching is and/or the supplies are<br/>
(found some behind the mushroom inn) or do I have to go to another city,<br/>
hopefully evil because I am KOS anymore at Freeport, and of course the<br/>
vendors wouldn&#39;t talk to me anyway?  Any ideas or do I have to make (don&#39;t<br/>
want to do this) a mule character to get the items (still can&#39;t believe they<br/>
didn&#39;t make the tools available to us at the bow shop). I have searched and<br/>
haven&#39;t found it, I will look again tonight, maybe I missed someone.<br/>
