<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410258099">just remembered an old idea for a neat sk/necro spell that i thought up long<br/>
ago. the basic idea is that it creates a NEGATIVE lighting effect around the<br/>
caster. i.e. where a lightstone makes more light around the person who holds<br/>
it, this spell would make it darker. either the caster could be immune to<br/>
this efffect and see normally, or could see normally by virtue of<br/>
infra/ultravision (which any sk should have by the time he would get this<br/>
spell..) this would imho be even more fun than voice graft :) and more in<br/>
character too, if we are deciding we dont like pets especially. if we really<br/>
want to add some utility to this otherwise eye-candy spell, how about make<br/>
it reduce NPC react/frenzy range? in other words, the max range at which an<br/>
npc can detect you is reduced. this spell would obviously be more useful in<br/>
the middle of the night or in a crowded dungeon.. if you ran around circled<br/>
by a patch of darkness in north karana in the middle of the day, you would<br/>
probably attract attention rather than dismiss it :) and the PvP uses<br/>
against humans (the non-evil ones.. hehe), barbarians, and erudites is<br/>
obvious ;) i like the simplicity, i like the image, and i like the<br/>
origionality. it helps that i thought it up myself too. 8) so what do you think?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
btw.. we already have heart flutter at lvl 39 :) just so ya know pat<br/>

P.S. if i were to suggest a change to our existing high level spell<br/>
selection, make the lvl 49 ultravision/detect spell lower. the evil races<br/>
can all see with ultravision anyway, and as a human lvl 49 is kind of late<br/>
to be getting that spell if i am going to get it at all :)</div>
