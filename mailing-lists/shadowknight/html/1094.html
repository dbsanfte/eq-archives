<div id="ygrps-yiv-224430147">Well finally thru many hours of  *ack* camping, i have<br/>
gotten both sides to the greaves. Now off to get some<br/>
Melatite...<br/>
Hmm..Mining Co in Sol A huh? Man they hate me.<br/>
get a friend who is ok faction wise there..<br/>
Hmm..no merchant that he can find. But he doesnt know<br/>
where the castle is.<br/>
Ask around.<br/>
Rumor has it that the MC clockworks carry it. ok...<br/>
but you killed many of them and not a single drop huh?<br/>
Killed a whole mess of other clockworks and nothing<br/>
either? DOH!!<br/>
<br/>
Now this was from someone we asked. We had had a rough<br/>
day so we didnt spend any quality time in SolA killing<br/>
anything.<br/>
As a matter of fact, a friend dropped into the lava<br/>
and was lucky to get his corpse back. That put a<br/>
damper on everything so we called it a night.<br/>
<br/>
So what is this long drawn out post for?<br/>
Well to find out where to get the Melatite of<br/>
course...<br/>
<br/>
Anyone happen to know?<br/>
