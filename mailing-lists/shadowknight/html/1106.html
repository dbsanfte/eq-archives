<div id="ygrps-yiv-939967741">OK.. i finally got mt DF boots YAY! (better than the<br/>
bronze i have been sporty).<br/>
<br/>
And here is my tale :<br/>
<br/>
After getting the key from Rathyl, go to Drelzna&#39;s<br/>
room. She isnt there, just 3 necros, pets and the<br/>
Undead Knight. COOL!<br/>
<br/>
So myself (40), another 40 SK and a 35 necro start to<br/>
clear the necros. The Undead Knight suddenly jumps in<br/>
and attacks our Necros pet. DOH!<br/>
<br/>
Then he suddenly jumps on the other SK. DOH! And he<br/>
isnt the wussie little greenie anymore either. He<br/>
con&#39;d white to our Necro and punches for 80s.<br/>
<br/>
So i tell the necro to Gate to kill the Aggro while i<br/>
finish clearing the room. Meanwhile our other SK is<br/>
trying to zone...i dont know if he tried to Feign or<br/>
not, but if he did, it didnt work :(<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, since i didnt have the key, i had to wait for<br/>
the TT down in the jail to spawn, so he could come up<br/>
and open the door for me so i can get to the Undead<br/>
Knight who was very considerately guarding our friends<br/>
corpse.<br/>
<br/>
I turn in all the parts and get my boots..yipee<br/>
<br/>
Our Necro then sits down to med a little. A skeleton<br/>
that was near by gets up and attacks him. The Undead<br/>
Knight then starts attacking me!?!?!?! First punch was<br/>
for 80..ouchy..almost died..zoned with 50HP..and that<br/>
was with all 3 of us beating on him. (Maybe he really<br/>
didnt care for the Heart Flutter i cast on him).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway..doesnt his sound odd to anyone else? Why would<br/>
the Knight turn aggro on me if the Necro was the one<br/>
in combat with the skel.<br/>
<br/>
After the Drelzna room incident, i thought maybve it<br/>
was similar to Llrodd, where he is indifferent unless<br/>
you attack something, then he gets midevil on you. But<br/>
if that was the case, then the Knight should have<br/>
attacked the Necro and not me. It looks like he turns<br/>
Aggro..on anything thats around.<br/>
<br/>
Who cares you say? Well, this makes getting to him<br/>
really difficult. First off, even at level 40,<br/>
everything in Drelzna&#39;s room attacks still. Which<br/>
means, if he is in there, he will attack.<br/>
Which means we have to try to ignore something hitting<br/>
us for 80s, while we clear the room, then either gate<br/>
or feign. Which means only certain people can help<br/>
you, and they have to make sure that they dont attack<br/>
him, regardless of the DMG he is doing.<br/>
<br/>
My question to you all, is this:<br/>
Does this sound like a bug? The part of him going<br/>
Aggro on anyone instead of just the one who was<br/>
fighting a Najena Inhabitant?<br/>
