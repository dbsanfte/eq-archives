<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476089130">I made level 10 last night. &lt;waits for applause and <br/>
cheering to settle donw&gt; It was the last thing I did <br/>
before I got offline.  I love the sound it makes when <br/>
you level!<br/>
From 5th - 10th I have remained exclusively in Neriak <br/>
and Nektulos Forrest.  Needless to say I am now bored <br/>
with skeles and wandering the zone looking for kodies.  <br/>
Granted, it is a very safe place for me to wander in <br/>
now. :)  Any suggestions on new hunting grounds for a <br/>
solo 10th level SK? I lag VERY badly in Freeport and <br/>
Greater Fey, too much &quot;activity&quot; with merchants and <br/>
spells makes my screen lock up. So do the Inns in the <br/>
Desert and Commonlands. :(  I was debating on tying out <br/>
Lavastrom, but with my save vs Fire attacks at a <br/>
whopping 5 I will take quite a beating I think. I need <br/>
to go back to Grobb to train my Bash skill (didn&#39;t <br/>
realize I hadn&#39;t trained in it yet. Doh!), Dodge, and <br/>
Bind Wound so I was debating on Upper Guk, or tryng the <br/>
further reaches of the Innothule swamp.  North Ro is an <br/>
option too. &lt;shrug&gt; But I am tired of that desert. Can <br/>
you get to the boat in Freeport from under the docks <br/>
without seeing a guard? If I can then I was debating on <br/>
OOT. Is all of OOT a high level zone or just parts of it?<br/>
I really want to go to Faydwer and take on the Nitebrite <br/>
Sisters.  How do you increase faction with Dwarves in <br/>
Kaladim so as not to be KoS as a Troll SK?<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Beld Demonblade,<br/>
The HT advise was very informative. I will use it from <br/>
now on like that. :)<br/>
Since you are obviously a very expeienced SK can you <br/>
write up  how you went about avoiding guards, increasing <br/>
factions (and which groups) and such as an SK?<br/>
I do not want to wander zones in &quot;Panic Mode&quot; if there <br/>
is a simple way around it. The Wood Elves of Lesser and <br/>
Greater Fey are my main concern after getting Dwarves <br/>
out of the way. :)<br/>
This assumes that it is possible of course.  Heh, can <br/>
you imagine going to Rivervale and getting the Healing <br/>
ring from the Sherrif or Deputy? Forgot it&#39;s name and <br/>
who gives it, sorry. :) &quot;I am one with the wall.&quot; heh.<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
