<div id="ygrps-yiv-344235354">Hey all, <br/>
<br/>
	I guess my opinion on this Harm Touch thing is I don&#39;t think<br/>
anyone&#39;s getting shafted.  EQ has been extremely well balanced from what<br/>
I&#39;ve seen and half the fun for me is taking a game that&#39;s designed a<br/>
certain way and finding my own ways of dealing with whatever hardships<br/>
I&#39;m presented with.  I feel like trying to ask the dev team at this point<br/>
to make the game easier for me is pretty weak.  That was the point of the<br/>
beta.  Part of the reason I bought the game was because it seemed like a<br/>
challenge during the beta and a game that is challenging is much more<br/>
interesting than one that is easily mastered.  <br/>
<br/>
I also heard a story about people complaining about the Sand Giants at the<br/>
Oasis saying they were interfering with their play.  My feeling about that<br/>
issue is: duh!  thats what they&#39;re there for.  I felt like those people<br/>
were whining too much.  And while the issue of balance is a better issue<br/>
to discuss than how to blatantly make the game easier, I still feel that<br/>
it&#39;s slightly whiny to complain about a character that is intentionally<br/>
more difficult at the lower levels.  Let&#39;s face it, at the highest levels,<br/>
we&#39;re going to be the most powerful players in the game.  Wizards will be<br/>
able to do more quick damage, but in a long run fight, SKs are the only<br/>
ones that can dish it out AND take it.  And if there&#39;s any such thing as a<br/>
soloable character at high levels (which I doubt), SKs are going to be the<br/>
closest thing to it.  <br/>
<br/>
So my perspective is to leave the HT alone and rise to the challenges that<br/>
the designers gave us.  After all, we did choose our characters.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I fully admit, and am glad for it, that SKs will indeed be a class to<br/>
&gt; be reckoned with. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However i must stick with my previous comments on HT. Sure if a few SKs<br/>
&gt; got together and HT&#39;d a Griffon to death quick and easy, they would get<br/>
&gt; good exp. But that would be it for another hour and a half. If thats<br/>
&gt; what they want to do with their HT instead of keeping it for an<br/>
&gt; emergency where HT is the only thing that&#39;ll save them, thats up to the<br/>
&gt; individuals involved. Its not like they&#39;ll be able to walk around and<br/>
&gt; HT everything to death right after that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And as for LoH getting interrupted, i have heard this about HT,<br/>
&gt; although its never happened to me. <br/>
&gt; I would like to hear from any SK on this.<br/>
&gt; If this is true, then we&#39;re back to square one. LoH 1000 healing, HT<br/>
&gt; 500dmg, but resisted by the creatures you would actually use it<br/>
&gt; against.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And we all know that a toning down of LoH just isn&#39;t going to happen.<br/>
&gt; We could campaign the rest of our lives and it&#39;ll never even be<br/>
&gt; considered. <br/>
&gt; So what&#39;s left? <br/>
&gt; Tweak HT. <br/>
&gt; HT is only powerful WHEN it works. Which seems to be less and less as<br/>
&gt; we gain higher levels and fight bigger creatures.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And i still feel that it should work every time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But aside from our differences of opinion, i would like to hear what<br/>
&gt; you think would be a good way to get the Dev team&#39;s attention with our<br/>
&gt; various concerns.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Talking about these topics on message boards and mailing lists is OK,<br/>
&gt; but this wont accomplish anything as far as the game is concerned.<br/>
&gt; Lets do that pro-active thing i hear so much about.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for responding,<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; i completely agree, i would personally like to sit<br/>
&gt; &gt; down with the game<br/>
&gt; &gt; balance programmers and get THEIR explainations of<br/>
&gt; &gt; how paladins and SK are<br/>
&gt; &gt; evenly matched. however, i think i can understand a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few possible reasons why<br/>
&gt; &gt; things are as they are:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ok, so at lvl 9 a paladin could probably beat up a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lvl 9 sk good, on account<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the paladin has 3 times normal hp (due to all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; healing), whereas we<br/>
&gt; &gt; get a spell that bites him for 5 damage and suck<br/>
&gt; &gt; away some of his str. but<br/>
&gt; &gt; eventually i think we accelerate in power faster<br/>
&gt; &gt; than paladins.. by the time<br/>
&gt; &gt; we get to lvl 50 in our best equipment, we would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; fully capable of beating<br/>
&gt; &gt; the snot out of a lvl 50 paladin in his best<br/>
&gt; &gt; equipment. (also, we dont have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to kill the lava dragon for a darkreaver ;)) upon<br/>
&gt; &gt; checking back to the guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; periodically i have seen a great many necro spells<br/>
&gt; &gt; being imped for SK use at<br/>
&gt; &gt; high level, including some of the powerful DOT<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells, spirit armor, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; expulse undead.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; also, while i admit that HT vs lay on hands isnt<br/>
&gt; &gt; very fair, remember that HT<br/>
&gt; &gt; IS rather powerful. most melee combat classes cant<br/>
&gt; &gt; boast the ability to<br/>
&gt; &gt; knock off a third or a half of their target&#39;s life<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a single attack and<br/>
&gt; &gt; still be able to go ahead and wail away with nasty<br/>
&gt; &gt; implements of pointy<br/>
&gt; &gt; death. my suggestion is not to boost HT, but to TONE<br/>
&gt; &gt; DOWN lay on hands. the<br/>
&gt; &gt; ability to heal that much is just not reasonable;<br/>
&gt; &gt; altho i have heard of<br/>
&gt; &gt; people having lay on hands interrupted, while it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; not possible to<br/>
&gt; &gt; interrupt HT that i have seen, it being<br/>
&gt; &gt; instantaneous. can anyone confirm<br/>
&gt; &gt; the possibility of lay on hands to be interrupted?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; there is a very good reason why HT can be resisted:<br/>
&gt; &gt; imagine about 20 lvl 10<br/>
&gt; &gt; sk all charge a griffin and simultaneously lay a<br/>
&gt; &gt; harm touch on it, causing<br/>
&gt; &gt; it to die instantly. now somebody is going to get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; crapload of xp out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; that, and it&#39;d be a hideously unfair trick for us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; even more lame than the<br/>
&gt; &gt; little bard accelerando-run in circles-bellow thing!<br/>
&gt; &gt; i admit i become quite<br/>
&gt; &gt; annoyed seeing HT resisted or soaked altogether, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; i try very hard not to<br/>
&gt; &gt; fight things that are guaranteed to resist it when<br/>
&gt; &gt; it can be helped anyway :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; now, if only they will figure out why we and<br/>
&gt; &gt; paladins cant hit worth a damn,<br/>
&gt; &gt; i think both classes are fully toe to toe with most<br/>
&gt; &gt; other classes for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; better part of the game. i still think it&#39;d be a bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; idea to duel a lvl 50<br/>
&gt; &gt; wizard with an SK, but the again, who COULD? :)<br/>
