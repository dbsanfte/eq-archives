<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693097376">Well I&#39;m still looking for info on the SK armor and in my searching&#39;s I came<br/>
across what is being required for the new Bard armor. If it&#39;s similar it<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be that hard. The only part I see people having problems with is<br/>
getting the pieces off of the HG&#39;s, SG&#39;s or Griffins.. Hopefully the SK<br/>
quest will be similar.. Still wondering if it will be better than Mithril<br/>
though, oh well guess I&#39;ll find out soon enough..<br/>
<br/>
On another subject anybody else besides me seem to be carrying a lot of<br/>
weapons around lately? Just realized last night that I have 3 different<br/>
weapons on me at any given time...(Thank god for EE sacks..)..<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy<br/>

Does anyone on the list play on the Test Server?  I&#39;ve heard that the<br/>
new quest armor was broken on Test, but I assume will be fixed before<br/>
tomorrow.  If anyone can post logs of talking to the quest giver I&#39;d<br/>
love to hear it.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard:<br/>
<br/>
The quest is given by a Greater Skeleton in the Graveyard of Mistmoore.<br/>
It requires pieces of Decayed Armor found off Lizard Crusaders in<br/>
Cazic Thule.  I don&#39;t yet know what else is required, but I assume <br/>
that there is either more items or monetary components (metals or<br/>
gems) involved.<br/>
<br/>
I have not seen stats or screenshots of how it looks.  I can&#39;t <br/>
believe they made the rogue armor look like plate.  It could have <br/>
the exact same stats, but I think black leather would have been<br/>
more fitting.<br/>
