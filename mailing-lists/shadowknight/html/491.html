clinging darkness, disease while ya drill him in the back...<br/>
Heh, cant wait till heat blood. Then a nice harm touch to finish it off...<br/>
Or just smash him when ya run outa man...<br/>

&gt; I had a friend cast Shadow Vortex on me to see what it<br/>
&gt; does. It lowered my AC by 7. She didnt say whether<br/>
&gt; hers went up or not, so im not sure on that part.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For certain tactics: Darkness/fear.. great.. i use it<br/>
&gt; all the time.. you can get several free hits in..but<br/>
&gt; as warned before, make sure you know where he is going<br/>
&gt; and that he doesnt have any friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also use fear when i am fighting more than one<br/>
&gt; creature at a time.. i cast fear on one (no<br/>
&gt; darkness..i want him to run far away :)  )  and hack<br/>
&gt; at the other. the one i am beating on will either be<br/>
&gt; close to death or dead by the time the other one comes<br/>
&gt; back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fear acts weird in the Arena though. it causes the<br/>
&gt; target to warp. One time my friend cast it on me and i<br/>
&gt; warped to one of the spires. i was then hit by 633<br/>
&gt; points of non-melee damage then fell to my death :)<br/>
&gt; I bugged it of course.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shadow Step i have had problems with. Either it puts<br/>
&gt; me right next to where i was, puts me thru a zone or<br/>
&gt; dumps me into a body of water. Not to say it isnt<br/>
&gt; helpful, i have just had bad luck with it so far.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And Harm Touch. When fighting anything that is magic<br/>
&gt; hit only, be prepared to be disappointed. BUt on most<br/>
&gt; other MOBs , depending on level, it does seem to work<br/>
&gt; well. Sometimes you may have to wait until the targets<br/>
&gt; HP is below half before it will have a full effect.<br/>
&gt; When i hit Broon with it (level 22ish Cyclops) to try<br/>
&gt; and pull him off of my friend, it did a whopping 36<br/>
&gt; points of damage. My BBC did more in one swing than<br/>
&gt; the HT. Broon totally ignored me and continued to<br/>
&gt; smack around my friend. Eventually he turned on me,<br/>
&gt; giving my friend time to cast and we beat him. But HT<br/>
&gt; was worthless that time.<br/>
&gt; It can be a last resort however. Usually i do save it<br/>
&gt; for an emergency. And when it comes down to hit, i hit<br/>
&gt; the hot key and pray to Bertoxxulous. MOst times it<br/>
&gt; gets me out of trouble. (example: goblin guard in<br/>
&gt; runnyeye. was the last one out of a train, he was<br/>
&gt; pounding on me. waited until he was below half, so was<br/>
&gt; i too, then HT. He died..i didnt. without HT, i would<br/>
&gt; have been kibble). But this is not failsafe of course.<br/>
&gt; I have heard some say that they use HT as soon as they<br/>
&gt; get it. I see that as a waste. But whatever toots you<br/>
&gt; flute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thats all for now<br/>
