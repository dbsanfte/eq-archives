<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-375920446">shadow knight npcs are so nasty because A) they are not afraid to use their<br/>
HT (in fact they use it the second they see you.. ouchies!) and B) they get<br/>
to cheat and use HT much more often than players. they are also typically<br/>
unique mobs, which gives them another power boost ;)<br/>
<br/>
by the by, add Shria to the list of Cool GMs on fennin ro. that puts her<br/>
right up there with citrine and.. well nobody else so far. but i&#39;m working<br/>
on the list, really i am :)<br/>
