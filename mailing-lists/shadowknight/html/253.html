<div id="ygrps-yiv-663130915">ok, to get the bone bladed claymore i suggest a group with an average level<br/>
of at least 20. if you bring many people lower level than that, you may not<br/>
survive the waits between the spawns of the troll sk, even tho you will have<br/>
no trouble just killing him. i recommend that you dont waste money on a<br/>
combine 2hander if you plan on getting the bbc unless you have a great deal<br/>
of money to throw around. an ordinary 2hander or fine steel 2hander will<br/>
serve you well until you get the bbc, but remember to bring along some<br/>
magical weapon to fight the ghouls and ice bones you are sure to find down<br/>
there in befallen.<br/>
<br/>
specialize is a skill that allows a spellcaster to choose one of the sorcery<br/>
skills (abjuration, divination, evocation, conjuration) to &quot;specialize&quot; in.<br/>
this basically means that when you specialize, spells that use that skill<br/>
cost less to cast, cast faster, and may have greater effect once cast.<br/>
specializing in one group of spells doesnt hurt the other magic skills tho,<br/>
i dont think.<br/>
<br/>
as for the tentacle terrors.. have you tried having the party cleric lull<br/>
one right before you lure the other? i havent fought there often, so i dont<br/>
know how well lull works on those things.<br/>
