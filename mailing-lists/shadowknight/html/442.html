<div id="ygrps-yiv-516351969">I&#39;m level 24 now. Whn I first got Vampiric it was hitting for 12. It now hits<br/>
for 13, so I am guess 1 extra point every 2 levels. Nothing all that major<br/>
compared to what I do with weapons but it is an extra attack and we do get a<br/>
little health out of it. This isn&#39;t too bad but certainly get better.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I&#39;d like to see out harm touch be unresistable, or at least less<br/>
susesceptable. That is the primary concer for me. My group and I consistanly hit<br/>
on mobs that are Red to be, ie around lvl 28 t o30, and my spells can&#39;t touch<br/>
them, fair enough, but my HT should<br/>

&gt; Yes, I have to agree with Lief on that too. I would be fantastic to have,<br/>
&gt; but I doubt it will ever be implemented.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What I think might be more feasible would be for Verant to increase the<br/>
&gt; power of Vampiric Embrace so that it works exactly the same for both Necros<br/>
&gt; and Shadow Knights. As near as I can tell, when we get it at level 22, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; effectiveness is already weaker then a Necromancer of around level 8. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; heard of many Necro&#39;s stating that it taps for 30+ a whack for them in the<br/>
&gt; late teens, increasing by a point or so around every level. However, it<br/>
&gt; seems that when we get the spell it is much weaker then a level 8 Necro&#39;s VE<br/>
&gt; - which is why it taps for just six points or so at the start for us (which<br/>
&gt; is in reality pretty useless). My Necro friend just confirmed that when<br/>
&gt; Necro&#39;s get this spell around level 8, they tap for around 20 a whack. Why<br/>
&gt; is it that when we get it, it starts at six?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I&#39;m only a paltry level 13, so I can&#39;t confirm the Vampiric Embrace<br/>
&gt; performance for Shadow Knights myself. But, from what I have been able to<br/>
&gt; gather from message boards, this spell is definitely performing differently<br/>
&gt; for us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My only other suggestion would be for Voice Graft to be replaced with Hungry<br/>
&gt; Earth, a Necromancer spell of comparison level that would fit into our DOT<br/>
&gt; theme as well providing a much needed Root type of spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my two cents.<br/>
