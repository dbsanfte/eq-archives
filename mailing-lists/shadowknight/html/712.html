<b>Subject:</b> VE vs Lifetap? and more on pet wars <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-900515899">well, replacing VE with some form of lifetap would be kind of a toss-up. the<br/>
advantage of VE is that you cast it ONCE, and just let it work.. therefore<br/>
saving you considerable mana over a spell which you must keep casting, and<br/>
can therefore be interrupted too. on the downside.. if you dont have godlike<br/>
dexterity, you cant really count on VE to do any more than add to your total<br/>
damage a bit; it is not very useful as a means of healing.<br/>
<br/>
i guess my main reason why we shouldnt have lifetaps is that it would<br/>
greatly reduce our downtime between fights. me, an sk, arguing AGAINST less<br/>
downtime?? hold on, lemme explain :) as any SK who has reached a modest<br/>
level can probably attest, we are the damage dealers. we can outdamage a<br/>
paladin of same level without even trying, and can outdamage a ranger of<br/>
similar level more often than not. so.. if we were to have less downtime as<br/>
well as our naturally greater damage, we would be MUCH more effective than<br/>
either of the other two hybrid classes. that is called overbalancing.<br/>
judging by verant&#39;s past track record on this (sorry brian) they would fix<br/>
that overbalancing by either giving us a pathetically weak lifetap (which<br/>
would be pointless) OR they would reduce our combat effectiveness, which<br/>
would make me one unhappy beld.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m really not sure what to fill the void here if we dont want pets and<br/>
lifetap would be out of the question for the above reasons.. perhaps a VERY<br/>
weak damage shield series? an extra DOT or two? ultimately i could live<br/>
without a pet, as it really isnt in character for the character i want to<br/>
play anyway, i&#39;m just stumbling around for ideas like the rest of you folks.<br/>
<br/>
oh, and dravith, if you DON&#39;T want a pet, why do you want me to toss you a<br/>
bone? 8) &lt;--- bad everquest humor. beld needs a nap.<br/>
