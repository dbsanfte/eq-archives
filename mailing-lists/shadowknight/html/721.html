<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550958202"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Here is my take.  I would remove the pets (they are just a novelty to me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and have no use in group play [my primary style of play]) and replace them<br/>
with an equivalent powered lifetap series.  Correct choice of which version<br/>
of the spell would be important.  The damage/heal of the lifetap should be<br/>
greater in power than the damage that the pet does because the pet only<br/>
needs to be summoned once whereas lifetap must be cast throughout the<br/>
combat.  This will result in slightly less downtime between battles, but<br/>
will be balanced by the fact that we will need to mediatate to get the mana<br/>
back that we used to cast the lifetaps.<br/>

Oh, and that no-pet-throw-me-a-bone joke was just... bad. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
