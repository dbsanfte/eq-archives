<div id="ygrps-yiv-497973519">Just my experiences with archery.<br/>
<br/>
I have a Rough Elm Recurve Bow which has a base 13 damage. With the 1 dmg<br/>
arrows, I can do 14 damage to beasties. I also have an 80 skill in Archery,<br/>
having practiced and practices (and practiced and practiced) till my thumbs<br/>
bleed. Now that I have a good skill and a good bow, I find it quite<br/>
worthwhile. But I would not reccomend it for anyone that is shy on spending<br/>
a LOT of time working on getting it up (I probably fired 3,000+ arrows in my<br/>
training). My bow does almost as much damage as a mino axe, although it is<br/>
slower (48 I think maybe 51, compared to 38 for mino axe).<br/>
<br/>
As for fletching ... there is nowhere on Antonica to get fletching supplies<br/>
except surefall glade. The only other plalce I know to get bowyering<br/>
supplies is in Oggok which is not an option for humans (DE, Trolls and Ogres<br/>
only). Even ones that worship Innoruuk. :(</div>
