&gt; Interesting about the ring.<br/>
&gt; Either I heard about a different ring, or it was changed.<br/>
&gt; Either way it sounds like a good item.<br/>
&gt; I plan on going halfling hunting soon, so hopefully afterward my<br/>
&gt; faction will be good enough to give it a try myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll post any info that hasnt been posted first.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is a ring of gating, and it has one charge. The annoying thing is that<br/>
you need to kill things in Befallen to complete this quest, which will<br/>
lower your faction (faction in question is &#39;the dead&#39;) with the very<br/>
people you need to talk to to complete it. My DE SK was able to talk about<br/>
the ring with the NPC female until I started going to befallen. Now, the<br/>
npc gives me the standard &quot;I&#39;ll talk to you when you have proven your<br/>
loyalty&quot;  line.<br/>
<br/>
This will not hinder my ablilty to complete the quest, but might prevent<br/>
me from getting it recharged. I&#39;d have to have to turn in fire beetle<br/>
eyes, paladin heads, bull elephant tusks and kerran beetle eyes with the<br/>
same frequency I killed things in befallen just to get my ring recharged. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any comments, or have the same problems?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
