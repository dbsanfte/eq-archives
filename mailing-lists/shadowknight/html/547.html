skill needed.<br/>
<br/>
You get the hilt by giving Arlena&#39;s lute to Grimrot. He also gives you a<br/>
note, which you take to Dekam N&#39;Tazi in Qeynos. Give him the note, he gives<br/>
you the mold. Then get some electrum, have a friend enchant it, then combine<br/>
the hilt and electrum in the mold.<br/>
