I agree with Karver. &nbsp;I solod quite a bit in Great Divide on the South East
side but since you have good giant faction, you cannot do that. &nbsp;Traks Tooth
has also been very good for me with lots of good loot also off the named.
&nbsp;Good luck<br>

 Don&#39;t know what works for soloing, never been that brave.&nbsp;&nbsp; =)<br>

  <br>
 &gt; Does anyone know of a good place for a 45 SK to hunt?&nbsp; I just can&#39;t<br>
 &gt; seem to find anywhere that is really intersting (or find a good grp<br>
 &gt; there).&nbsp; I tried Karnor&#39;s recently but that place is a mess (and you<br>
 &gt; get bad Venril Sathir (sp) faction (the outpost in OT))&nbsp; so that was<br>
 &gt; no good.&nbsp; Many of the higher levels are either overcrowded or there&#39;s<br>
 &gt; just no-one there.&nbsp; I solo a lot so I was wondering if anyone knew
of<br>
 &gt; anywhere good.&nbsp; my Velious faction is with the giants (Ally, Warm and<br>
 &gt; dumbarse Tormax still scowels, which would be nice to get some help<br>
 &gt; w/).&nbsp; I dunno, any ideas?&nbsp; Have all my DF armor etc, so there a very<br>
 &gt; few quests to do.<br>
