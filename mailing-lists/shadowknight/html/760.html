<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286324873">The only thing I can think of that would make the small race SK more viable, without making the large race SK more powerful would be the introduction of a few SK only items. (+hp items, or whatever) that are medium small only. <br/>
I see no way to up class power for one race and not the other. Only by Item that large races cannot wear, that are SK only, do I see the possibility. <br/>
