&gt; Right now the only question I want answered is, what does the spell they<br/>
&gt; added several patches ago for Necros and SKs, Shadow Vortex do?<br/>
&gt; Anyone who knows I&#39;d love to hear the answer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no clue what that spell does. I started myself a dark elven SK, this<br/>
on the heals of my now-retired 31 dark elven warrior. I&#39;m level 13 with the<br/>
SK now, and loving it. I don&#39;t know that much about the life of an SK, so if<br/>
you&#39;d like to describe your own SK and/or tactics, I&#39;d love to hear it. This<br/>
may not answer your question, but it may get the list moving again.<br/>

	Yeah I also play a dark elven SK, and as one there are a few things I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed that are useful as a dark elf, especially since most think that DE<br/>
SK isn&#39;t such a good choice. Yep it&#39;s hard, but it has some real payoffs.<br/>
The high INT keeps your skills raising like crazy even into the 100&#39;s as I&#39;m<br/>
experiencing now, and allows you to do more creative things with your mana,<br/>
like back off out of a fight when soloing and let your pet beat on the<br/>
monster to finish it, with you healing it with mend bones (15) with all that<br/>
extra mana you&#39;ve got. Since a dark elf SK can&#39;t have too high STR<br/>
(especially if you distruibuted points to other things like STA and DEX),<br/>
item-wise you&#39;ll want to try to get things that raise STR. You can use<br/>
either 2-hand or 1-hand weapons, 1 handers are useful because having a<br/>
shield ups your AC,adds to your parry rate (17),  gives you the ability to<br/>
bash, and may also have some useful attributes to it (like the darkwood<br/>
raising STR by 9, or the chitin shell raising poison resist by 10). If you<br/>
use a 2-hander, then you&#39;ll get great damage, it just isn&#39;t as ideal as a<br/>
troll or ogre tho because of their ability to slam (bash without shield).<br/>
Aside from this, you might also listen to what Beld said about being careful<br/>
with HT etc.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck, Phantasaic Voidstone, Karana<br/>
