<b>Subject:</b> Re: Brian, why better ac for rogues, bards, and rangers? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981142782">I still havent received a SS of the BP. I think our<br/>
friend who had it may have destroyed since he already<br/>
has Umbral.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say that in comparison, our new stuff<br/>
statwise isnt as good as some. But i will say we arent<br/>
the only ones. Ive been looking at various pieces of<br/>
the new armor and a lot of it isnt all that great for<br/>
several of the classes.<br/>
Though i am envious of the ranger greaves. I like AGI.<br/>
<br/>
I think this armor came a little too late. Its too<br/>
easy to just go buy better stuff now. If these items<br/>
had come out a few months ago, we would be happier. <br/>
But since it is so easy to get better items, that<br/>
makes this stuff seem worthless.<br/>
<br/>
I cant wait to see which one of our items has Charisma<br/>
as a stat.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I dont think Brian bothers with this board<br/>
anymore<br/>

&gt; higher AC than our darkforge armor, and arguably<br/>
&gt; better statistics.<br/>
&gt; All of the ranger armor I&#39;ve seen has excellent<br/>
&gt; bonuses to pertinent<br/>
&gt; stats.  Example.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ivy etched tunic (ranger):  19AC +3Str +3Wis +30HP<br/>
&gt; Darkforge breastplate (sk):  18AC +10Sta +3Mr<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know exactly how stamina works, but I know<br/>
&gt; that the +6 stamina<br/>
&gt; on my charred bp equates to about 13HP for me at<br/>
&gt; level 33.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The leggings...<br/>
&gt; Lambent greaves (bard):  13AC +1Cha +5Agi weight 4.0<br/>
&gt; Darkforge greaves(sk):  11AC +9Sta +3Mr weight 7<br/>
&gt; Ivy Etched greaves(rng): 12AC +5Agi +5Fire +5Cold<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bard:  2 AC more and weighs 3lbs less.  Also, the<br/>
&gt; Agi bonus will give <br/>
&gt; another point or two of ac.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ranger:  1 more AC<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hear they are upping the crusader spawns, which is<br/>
&gt; good, but <br/>
&gt; really why do the rangers have higher ac on their<br/>
&gt; chain armor? It<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
