<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007504954"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; You get the hilt by giving Arlena&#39;s lute to Grimrot. He also gives you a<br/>
&gt; note, which you take to Dekam N&#39;Tazi in Qeynos. Give him the<br/>
&gt; note, he gives<br/>
&gt; you the mold. Then get some electrum, have a friend enchant it,<br/>
&gt; then combine<br/>
&gt; the hilt and electrum in the mold.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; DV<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I don&#39;t THINK anyone said this before. Just what level is Arlena?<br/>
Doable with a party of 4-6 lvl 20s (+-2 lvls)? If it is, I&#39;m kicking my<br/>
friends into gear and we are going to do this. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
