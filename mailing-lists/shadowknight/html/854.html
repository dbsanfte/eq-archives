<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841435611">a weird question just popped into my head :)<br/>
<br/>
it was YOU who found the EBW thru the grimrot quest, right bathory?<br/>
<br/>
well.. have you tried doing the grimrot quest since somebody said that the<br/>
EBW was obtained via the the avenging caitiff in MM (which makes it damn<br/>
near impossible for us to get one now ;p)? who knows.. there may be TWO ways<br/>
to get this weapon.. :)<br/>
