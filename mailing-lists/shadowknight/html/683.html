<div id="ygrps-yiv-872145262">Thank you, thank you, thank you....this is a burning issue that never seems to be addressed by Verant.  If any of you actually listen to this board, hear me.  DO NOT DO QUESTS IN EQ, UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND EXPERIENCE.  Ok, I admit it.  I still do quests too, even though they suck.  This is a great example how bad apples can spoil the bunch.  My perception is that Verant seriously destroyed the value of doing quests because people (in Beta or whatever) were farming the quests for exp. and loot.  Problems with the quests:<br/>
<br/>
1)  You have no idea what level you should be in order to complete them.  Time and again, I have started a quest only to find that the mob I needed to kill at the end of the quest conned DEEP red to me.  That equals wasted time for my efforts.<br/>
<br/>
2)  No clues are given on variable spawning NPC&#39;s and mobs.  If the mob or NPC is not at the location mentioned by the quest giver 100% of the time, the player needs to have clues as to when they will actually be around or if they are maybe at an alternate location.  Stomping around Innothule swamp for 5 hours trying to find the Spore Guardian only to discover that he&#39;s a rare spawn that is only around once a week or so and you have no idea when he will spawn next is NOT fun.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Poor rewards.  Finishing a quest in and of itself is a reward, but not having an extra kick at the end for your hard work really dilutes the experience.  Imagine you just finished a quest that took you 5 hours of game time of running around, finding the info on the quest, waiting for the spawn, and gathering people to help you if needed.  You complete the quest.  Ding, you recieve imperceptible amount of experience, 2 gold, and a rusty mace.  Uh...ok, glad I finally completed it, but I&#39;ll never do that again.  It kills the whole process. <br/>
<br/>
4)  Faction hits.  Faction hits for actions are so binary (when it happens, it happens, and is irreversible), especially for evils who have little or no way to raise faction once you&#39;re to the KoS level.  There needs to be some type of warning for the player.  Let&#39;s face it, the player has no way of knowing what the faction hit is until the action is complete, whether that be completing a quest or killing a monster.  <br/>

Well, barely.<br/>
<br/>
There seem to be quite a few quests which eat up a lot<br/>
of time, and have lousy XP and item payoffs.<br/>
<br/>
Myself and a friend have been working on a quest for<br/>
about 2 weeks now. In those 2 weeks we have seen most<br/>
of our friends pass right by us level wise.<br/>
<br/>
On Allakhazams site i posted a few of the beginner<br/>
quests i did in qeynos many moons ago. All were<br/>
deadend quests with lame payoffs for the time some ofï¿½D<br/>
them took. The only one so far is the one involving<br/>
Lord Grimrot who wants you to go to Mistmoore, kill<br/>
Arlena and bring back her bones. I know several people<br/>
who have been to Mistmoore, and no Arlena is to be<br/>
found. Many believe that she is actually a gypsie by<br/>
another name. That involved getting her Lute and<br/>
turning it in.<br/>
So is it broken? Or is that Verants stupid idea of<br/>
trying to be sneaky? I will expand on that comment<br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
Heres a good one. Trumpy Irontoe. Killing him lowers<br/>
your faction with CorruptGuards and Kane Bayle. Who<br/>
happens to roam our guild in Qeynos. I became KOS with<br/>
him and was slaughtered by him in that guild on 3<br/>
occasions because of that quest. What a great<br/>
incentive, huh? Not only did the quest yield nothing<br/>
worthwhile, we got a quest that we cant possibly do<br/>
until at least level 30, which may not even work AND<br/>
we become KOS in our own guild. Sweet deal.<br/>
<br/>
So i move to Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Didnt bother with quests for a long time. Finally got<br/>
enough courage to give them a try again.<br/>
Heres my expansion on Verants idea of trying to be<br/>
smart or tricky.<br/>
For the VAST majority of the quests i have been doing,<br/>
when we are told to go find and talk/kill someone, we<br/>
go to the place we are told, try it and it doesnt<br/>
work. They almost always have to spawn in a different<br/>
spot in order for us to do what we need to do. How are<br/>
we supposed to know this when none of our NPC contacts<br/>
even hint at this.<br/>
<br/>
Prime example. Groflah Steadirt. We are told that he<br/>
resides in North Freeport. Go to N FP. Thar he is.<br/>
Kill the filthy little dirtmonger. He disappears. Hmm.<br/>
Can find out any other info. BEHOLD!! He spawns in the<br/>
Seafarers Roost. How did we find that out? By reading<br/>
a Paladin spoiler site of course.<br/>
How the heck were we supposed to know that happens?<br/>
Were we supposed to wander all of FP aimlessly until<br/>
we were lucky enough to spot him?<br/>
<br/>
Thats simply foolish.<br/>
<br/>
The quest ive been working on. We are told<br/>
specifically to talk to a certain NPC in a certain<br/>
place. Go there, find her...and nothing. Now according<br/>
to Verants rules i am assuming that she (Opal<br/>
Darkbriar) spawns someplace else or there is a 3rd<br/>
Opal somewhere in FP.<br/>
But how are we to know that for sure? We are told go<br/>
to point A. We go to point A and its wrong. We arent<br/>
told anything about point B where she really is<br/>
supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
OK..this ended up being a lengthy rant, and i<br/>
appologize to any i have bored silly. <br/>
<br/>
But here is my point(s):<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem what so ever with hard quests.<br/>
Puzzles and so on. That stuff is great. But being told<br/>
where to go and having it be wrong, with no other info<br/>
forthcoming, is not a puzzle. A puzzle involves at<br/>
leats hints of some sort.<br/>
Send me into a dangerous area where i have to fight<br/>
for my life. Give me riddles i need to figure out.<br/>
Send me to a different part of the world to aquire an<br/>
item. All these things would be fine.<br/>
<br/>
But let the end result at least be satisfying. Lets<br/>
get good XP from it. Lets get a good cash and/or item<br/>
reward for all our trials and tribulations.<br/>
Instead, what have we gotten? A cleric spell, rusty<br/>
mace and KOS in our own guild.<br/>
<br/>
Verant needs to take a break from catering to all the<br/>
childish whiners who petition everytime they dont get<br/>
their way (i.e. the new yield rule wh</div>
