are really nice.  I plan on getting them if I can.<br/>

&gt; helm). am i a bastard for exploiting this? yes. but anything that gets me<br/>
&gt; out of that gods forsaken hole known as cazic faster.. it wasnt a totally<br/>
&gt; selfish affair tho, there were numerous lvl 30ish in the group, so i<br/>
&gt; introduced them to the xp money train. got at least two of them over a<br/>
&gt; bubble and a half of xp in that timeframe. sadly we got trained out by<br/>
&gt; somebody before many tae ew lizards spawned, but we had both the upper and<br/>
&gt; lower TR locked down with our lone group, and we didnt even have a dedicated<br/>
&gt; healer. it was pretty fun :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was in a similar situation last night.  How are you exploiting<br/>
anything?  Is it a bug that the apes drop decayed?  I played for 2<br/>
hours in the side room, not a single crusader spawned, but I picked<br/>
up 3 extra pieces of decayed that the TR group didn&#39;t need.  Glad<br/>
I waited it out a bit before I went back to Cazic =)<br/>
