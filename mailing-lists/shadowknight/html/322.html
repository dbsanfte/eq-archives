<div id="ygrps-yiv-373011836">he can&#39;t go down to 20 points and LOH. As soon as he is down to 1/4 he is dead.<br/>
so he is ising LoH at half health really. My bow does 17 damage around. give I<br/>
can cast darkness on him and just keep running around him shooting while he<br/>
looks stupid,  I think it is quite alright.<br/>

&gt; &gt;actually, i talked to a guy who said that loh could only heal like 600 hp<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt;max.. of course, i dont have a paladin char, so somebody else has to<br/>
&gt; confirm<br/>
&gt; &gt;or deny that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course at level 50 we only get 500points HT (If they dont shrug it off)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;fights once you get hide.. shadow step, hide, and shoot them in the back<br/>
&gt; &gt;once they turn around while looking. its right out of the movies :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ..and that would take how long at 5 or 10 points an arrow?, How many arrows?<br/>
&gt; especially considering he can go down to 20 HP, LoH and we start over?(well<br/>
&gt; he does...)<br/>
