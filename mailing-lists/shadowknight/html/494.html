<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668467478">dont worry about the BIBS and GZ quite yet.. most non-twinks are unable to<br/>
obtain these until high 20s to low 30s levels. :)<br/>
<br/>
as for harm touch, like i said in a previous post.. you gotta be kind of<br/>
devious to make it work. it is not really a DD, but a melee attack that hits<br/>
for magical damage. it is most effective when used from behind the monster<br/>
or while it is trying to flee or stunned. this is why fear is such an<br/>
excellent spell..<br/>
<br/>
as for spells at 15 and 22.. buy em all i say, they are cheap by the time<br/>
you can cast em (they are the same as necro spells of 1/4th your level). but<br/>
the most important spells: at 15, fear and clinging darkness are the MUST<br/>
BUY spells. the rest have their uses, but these two are required for the<br/>
combat strategy of DOT &gt; slow &gt; fear that works so well for us. at 22 your<br/>
best spells will be engulfing darkness, the upgrade to clinging darkness,<br/>
and vampiric embrace, our first buff that we will actually USE. oh dont<br/>
complain about VE you trollies, a dark elf with a 1h weapon is quite<br/>
effective with it ;) also-rans include shadow step at 15 (the game&#39;s best<br/>
duelling spell, so long as you learn how to keep your bearings when using<br/>
it) and deadeye at 22 (if you are human, you finally get to see in the dark!<br/>
if you are not, it also doubles as detect invis).<br/>
<br/>
by the way, those of you who say voice graft at 30 is a useless spell.. BAH.<br/>
its by far the most hilarious spell myself or any of my group buddies have<br/>
ever seen :) there&#39;s something about hearing the mob you are fighting<br/>
screaming for help and whining about how cruel you are..<br/>
<br/>
pets: they are not your tank. they are there to get a few extra hits in<br/>
edgewise. and this damage adds up, especially if you give it a weapon. (i<br/>
believe that animate dead and higher necro pets are able to dual wield, but<br/>
i can&#39;t confirm this..)<br/>
<br/>
also... i&#39;ve heard that some DE sk swear by quicker 1hs and piercing weapons<br/>
rather than big slow 2hs weapons. this is because dark elves can rely on<br/>
their dex and agility in a fight to be hit less often and deal max damage<br/>
more, while the trolls and ogres use 2hs mostly because it emphasizes their<br/>
incredible strength that much more. me, as a human, i use both ;) also, a<br/>
dark elf sk with a fanged skull stiletto or thulian claw and VE drains life<br/>
at an incredible rate.. it might be something worth looking into :)<br/>
