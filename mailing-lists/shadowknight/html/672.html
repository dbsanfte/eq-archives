<div id="ygrps-yiv-549328157"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; First off, your weapon descriptions lead me to think that you are buying<br/>

&gt; Or is my view of things really skewed?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, we&#39;re talking buying/trading here. You can get a BIBS at about 25, and<br/>
usually most people trade their BIBS and about 500-700pp to upgrade to a<br/>
Zweihander. It happens a lot. As for a Dark Reaver, I got mine at 28 (paid<br/>
1000pp, demon claw, and liz cloak for it), and most SKs 30+ will already<br/>
have one. The reason they aren&#39;t as expensive as you would think is<br/>
*because* they are a class-specific weapon. When your customer base is made<br/>
up of only SKs ranging from 20-30, you can&#39;t really charge an arm and a leg<br/>
for one and make the sale, ya know?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Back in the day, I used a BBC for a *long* time, I&#39;m talking from 18 to 28,<br/>
I never cared much for the BIBS, and any dark elf can spare 9 Agility like<br/>
its nothing. I don&#39;t see why the BBC is so undervalued -- if you can take<br/>
the Agi hit, it&#39;s better than the SBH and about the same price.<br/>
