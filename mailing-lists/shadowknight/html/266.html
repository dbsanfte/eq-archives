<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-845389250">I am just getting into the level where I start getting pets.  I have a few<br/>
questions.  Does anyone know if pets are capable of dual wield?  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure if I should be giving them a 2-handed weapon, or try 2 1-handed.<br/>
Beyond that I&#39;m curious as to whether or not they can use shields, and will<br/>
the types of weapons they can use change in higher levels.  Anyone info<br/>
someone has to share would be appreciated.</div>
