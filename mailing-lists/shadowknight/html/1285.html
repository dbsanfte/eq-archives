&gt; Well I just found out there was a list about amonth ago and this thread is<br/>
&gt; the first one i have received so I&#39;ll introduce myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just got 47 with Squiggles, My Troll SK on Vallon Zek. I am the leader of<br/>
&gt; &lt;Da Bashin&#39; Iggles&gt;. My guild and our allies are preparing for a dragon<br/>
&gt; raid in a month at the max. Tried Fire Giants for the first time on<br/>
&gt; Saturday night, did ok on the first 3, but got massacred after that. Anyone<br/>
&gt; got any tips on FG&#39;s, dragons, or breaking into the Planes? Pulling<br/>
&gt; locations for FG&#39;s would be most beneficial at this time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A guildmate of mine has posted a fire giant pulling guide complete<br/>
with maps on everquest.allakhazam.com<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called Aguro&#39;s guide to fire giants or something.<br/>
