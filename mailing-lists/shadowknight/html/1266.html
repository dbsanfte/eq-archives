Wow, just wondering if Santa Claws got all of the other Shadow Knights out<br/>
there, or what?  I have not recd a digest since the 10th of Dec. and was<br/>
wondering what&#39;s up?<br/>
<br/>
If anyone out there is getting this, what is a GOOD area for a 20th lvl DE<br/>
SK to go and hunt?  I have been hunting in HPH and getting good xps, but<br/>
wondering where to go next.  Also, has anyone *ever* gotten to the point<br/>
where they were not KOS to the HP guards?<br/>
<br/>
As an additional aside, I was wondering what the general consensus was on<br/>
costs for the following items:  Silvery-plated Bracer, Blackened Iron Armor<br/>
(any piece or general guideline, like 5plat per AC or what?), BIBS, and Dark<br/>
Reaver?<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone out there?</div>
