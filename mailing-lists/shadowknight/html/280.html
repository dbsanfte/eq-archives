<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396521281">With one of my other characters...on my way from Kaladim to Freeport...in<br/>
the Ocean of Tears...i noticed and BUNCH of islands with camps and fires<br/>
burning...not too mention that one hill giant swimming towards the<br/>
boat...that was kinda scary....  I would say try out some to the<br/>
islands....i noticed some places along antonica have boats that you can<br/>
take off in.,  If you could find one....<br/>
