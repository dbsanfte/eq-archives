&gt;Subject: update to hit rate and other things<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ok, i petitioned about the low hit rate thing (as many sk and paladins that<br/>
&gt;i knew had really crappy hit rate) and a gm replied that there was a bug<br/>
&gt;involved that they were working on. hmmmmmm...<br/>

&gt;on the 1hs vs 2hs issue, i personally tend toward 1hs, tho i keep both<br/>
&gt;skills maxed for my level. right now, my 1hs weapon, the polished granite<br/>
&gt;tomahawk, just completely blows away any 2h weapon i can either afford or<br/>
&gt;reasonably obtain on my own or with my usual group of companions.<br/>

I would *kill* for one.  (Actually, considering the game, I probably *will*<br/>
have to kill to get one. ;)<br/>

<br/>
This is one of those real circumstantial things that make it so good to keep<br/>
both 1h and 2h up.  If you&#39;re fighting spellcasting mobs, its all about<br/>
quick hits to increase the chance of an interrupt.  If, on the other hand,<br/>
you&#39;re fighting in some place like Lavastorm where there&#39;s alot of mobs with<br/>
damage shields, speed kills.  Personally, I prefer to have the best of both<br/>
worlds and be able to use whatever weapon the particular situation calls<br/>
for.  Also, I know for a fact that there&#39;s a mix of 1h and 2h holy swords,<br/>
and from what I can tell, paladins and sk&#39;s parallel *very* closely.  I<br/>
would be very unsurpriesed if there are both 1h and 2h flavors of unholy<br/>
swords, so I figure, might as well keep both skills up. =)<br/>
