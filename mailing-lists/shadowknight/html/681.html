    About faction...If you can do anything abou this<br/>
one thing i am sure a LOT of sks would love is if we<br/>
could train in all the sk guilds.  I have only been to<br/>
4 guilds(i am a dark elf) neriak, freeport, grobb, and<br/>
oggok. I can only train in neriak and freeport. i do<br/>
not understand why i cannot train in/have access to<br/>
the quests in the sk guilds in grobb and oggok. It is<br/>
very annoying. I talked to a gm once and he said<br/>
somehting like &quot;shadowknights are a strange bunch. try<br/>
killing things in teh wild to get your faction up&quot;<br/>
there are no such things and i am very angry that a<br/>
guide doesn&#39;t even know this. <br/>
     Another thing about faction. In mistmoore you<br/>
take a faction hit with Queen Cristanos Thex or<br/>
something. You gain faction with her when you do<br/>
quests and stuff in neriak. I talked to a number of<br/>
sks and necros and they said this faction isn&#39;t really<br/>
implemented yet. I am scared that my own guild will<br/>
kill me if it ever does get implemented :(  The wierd<br/>
thing is that in mistmoore everything is kos to<br/>
me...why would killing something that is kos to you<br/>
hurt your faction with your guild...it doesn&#39;t make<br/>
sense. If this faction ever gets implemented that<br/>
would mean 2 dugeons dark elf sks and necros can&#39;t<br/>
hunt in : Crushbone and Mistmoore. I think if we can&#39;t<br/>
hunt in mistmoore why not make it like a high pass for<br/>
dakr elves. I guess there would be problems with that<br/>
with camping items in dangerous places but i dunno.<br/>
<br/>
just my 2 copper<br/>
