<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637597511">There is nothing wrong with everyone that can being a master archer. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind at all if that were so. However, I don&#39;t think that anyone who<br/>
wants to be a master archer should be able to go spend 8cp and 3 hours and<br/>
become one. If you want to be a master archer, you should have to spend as<br/>
much time on it as you do any other combat skill. Why should archery be any<br/>
different? And as for professional fletchers... they still make a decent<br/>
living as it is. They save quite a bit on arrows over the long run, can have<br/>
more than 1 pt damage arrows, are the first to get the better bows, and they<br/>
still sell some bows for a decent amount (Spoke with someone yesterday who<br/>
had just sold an Ash bow for 32pp). Every other skill in this game,<br/>
especially combat skills, takes a lot of time and work to raise. Archery is<br/>
a very viable weapon, most people just don&#39;t have the patience to do it<br/>
because at a low skill it is not very viable. You need to work on your skill<br/>
and purchase some more powerful bows before it becomes a useful and viable<br/>
combat skill.<br/>
<br/>
As for archery and the auto-attack ... as far as I have found there is not.<br/>
I have archery on a hot-key myself, and just have to switch off auto-attack<br/>
and wait for the round time to end before using my bow. It can be a bit<br/>
annoying, but at least the way I use the bow in a support role, this is not<br/>
generally a problem. Bow&#39;s are used for pulling, for turning around and<br/>
shooting, for chipping away at a mob while hurt in a group situation, and<br/>
sometimes when they run. These generally do not require much auto-attack as<br/>
non of them last that long. Archery does go up, but only when in combat with<br/>
exp giving creatures. The best way to get archery up is to either use your<br/>
own friends, or find a group that will let you, and just stand off to the<br/>
side and let fly with a shower of arrows during combat. Also, go buy a<br/>
quiver as, especially while training, you will use arrows like they were<br/>
water. Good luck with your arching, it is a great skill to have if you have<br/>
the patience.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

&gt; &gt; I did not declare that anything was a bug exploit, I merely<br/>
&gt; pointed out that<br/>
&gt; &gt; these daggers are a pathetically easy way of raising your<br/>
&gt; Archery skill. Due<br/>
&gt; &gt; to Verant&#39;s EXCELLENT history of balancing this game, I find it<br/>
&gt; extremely<br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult to believe that they would put a component in the<br/>
&gt; world that would<br/>
&gt; &gt; allow you to raise your archery skill 5 points in 5 minutes<br/>
&gt; when normally<br/>
&gt; &gt; archery takes an extraordinary amount of time to raise unless you use it<br/>
&gt; &gt; constantly. Yes, I did raise my own archery skill 5 points in 5<br/>
&gt; minutes (it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was already at 72) while testing it to see if it worked. The ability to<br/>
&gt; &gt; raise any skill, especially a combat one, that much in such a<br/>
&gt; short amount<br/>
&gt; &gt; of time must be considered a bug or something that Verant does<br/>
&gt; not realize.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If the daggers/pine needles were throwing weapons that went in<br/>
&gt; the ranged<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon slot and used up one each time, that would make it a little bit<br/>
&gt; &gt; better, but they are not, so for 8cp or something silly like<br/>
&gt; that you get<br/>
&gt; &gt; this item to raise your skill to its max with one nights work<br/>
&gt; or less. As<br/>
&gt; &gt; for waiting to hear back from someone of authority, I agree,<br/>
&gt; that is why I<br/>
&gt; &gt; and all my compatriots have /bug&#39;d this item. Your statement about them<br/>
&gt; &gt; using the archery skill due to the aim factor is just as much<br/>
&gt; conjecture as<br/>
&gt; &gt; my statement, however. And by the way, the fact that they have<br/>
&gt; such pathetic<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage makes them the reason that they are that much more powerful at<br/>
&gt; &gt; raising your archery skill.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyways, I just hope that Verant fixes this major game-balance<br/>
&gt; problem soon<br/>
&gt; &gt; before everyone and their momma is a master archer. :) I worked long and<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard to become as good at Archery as I am, and it seems silly<br/>
&gt; that someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; can pick one of these items up and in a few hours of practice become a<br/>
&gt; &gt; master archer.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s hard;y a bug exploits. they use the arhcrey skill due to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; aim factor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And the fact that they have such a pathetic damage. somthing like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1,  tends to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest this. I would suggest to wait to hear back from some one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in authority<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; before declaring something to be a bug exploit.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tiny daggers and pine needles are *extremely likley*<br/>
&gt; bugged melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weapons. I have seen them and tested them just enough to make<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sure they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually bugged, and then I have /bug&#39;d them and continued on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my way. They<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are melee weapons and help in the melee slot, there is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; absolutely no reason<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they should help out your archery skill. It would be very cheap<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and possibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an exploit to use these.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Then grab<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of those needle thingy&#39;s which are like daggers but use<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the archery<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; skill.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; UMMM.. what needle thingys might those be?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And do you know where to get them in freeport?<br/>
