  My name is Foolsgawd and I play on tunare<br/>
  I just died and my corpse vanished for some awfull bug and GMs never answer my petitions.<br/>
   I realized how weak I am without armor at level 10<br/>
  buying another fullset of leather is gonna be hard <br/>
  I wanted to know about the SK quests in queynos.<br/>
  The guildmaster in the sewers (he smelled REAL nasty) told me to meet commander kane<br/>
  Commander kane told me to kill young paladins in karrana plains<br/>
  I went there and the first npc I saw was Brother Trintle or something (Blond hair)<br/>
  killed him and gave the busted prayer beads to the guildmaster and DOH he killed me cuz brutha Trintle was our spy amongst the temple of life.<br/>
  This boosts your faction standing with queynos guards and merchant so its not so bad cuz the other paladins will get it down.<br/>
  So I headed back to karrana plains and there was another Npc (No armor , dark hair and beard) killed him and he gave me nothing...but faction standing got worse<br/>
  I waited a bit and another Npc came out of nowhere (leather armor , dark hair , unbearded) killed him and he gave me the prayer beads<br/>
  I gave them to the GM and nothing happened<br/>
  I killed all the NPCs AGAIN and gave the beads to Commander Kane in the sewers....<br/>
  still nothing.....How the hell do I complete this quest ??? </span></blockquote></div>
