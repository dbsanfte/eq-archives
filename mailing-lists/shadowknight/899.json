I&#39;m hoping that they have some pretty good zones across the board.  I&#39;m getting to know the zones currently in the game a little bit too well and have lost some of the mystery.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI like you, Cronik, have been experimenting with lots of different characters:  a Rogue, a Cleric, a Necro, and a Warrior are some that I&#39;ve tried recently.  Maybe I&#39;m just playing on bad servers, but I&#39;ve found it extremely hard to find anyone to group with me lately (even with my 15th level cleric).  All my characters are 22nd level and below, so maybe all the experienced people have leveled beyond that.  Or the servers that I play on may just stink, I don&#39;t know.  It has kind of turned me off to EQ lately.  Maybe I need to switch to one of the older servers, like Fennin Ro?  Anyone have any thoughts on what the good servers are.  Bristlebane used to be pretty good, but I&#39;ve seen a downgrade in the quality of people playing lately.  I&#39;d be interested in starting an Ogre SK and see how he compares to my TSK, although they probably play pretty much the same up &#39;til 20th except for regen.<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg Wraithbone of Bristlebane (eternally 22nd level TSK)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmmm. I wonder what Races they are adding... <br/>\nOrc, Goblin, Froglok, Gnoll, Lizardman, Faerie, Bixie... <br/>\nThat would be interesting. <br/>\n&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Bixx the Bixie.
