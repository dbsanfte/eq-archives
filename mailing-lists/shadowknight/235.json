Maybe that would get their<br/>\nattention that we might need a power boost.  And maybe publish the results<br/>\nfor us and everyone to see. (But honestly I doubt they would take the time,<br/>\nthey got our money already).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my 2 questions is shouldn&#39;t we be equal to a paladin at the same<br/>\nlevel warrior wise and equal to the magic ability as a paladin is.  I guess<br/>\nour god is not as powerful as the paladin&#39;s god, maybe that is the correct<br/>\nassumption?  or maybe a shadow knight was an after thought to the game (hey<br/>\nlets add some &quot;evil&quot; classes to the game) and never fully tested.  Because<br/>\nif I have read the posts correctly that no one ever made it to level 50<br/>\nshadow knight (I think I read that in the undiscovered weapons) in the beta,<br/>\nbut they did make a paladin level in the beta (and that is why they knew the<br/>\nweapons available for the paladin), if I am wrong let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe someone should find a paladin and do a duel with them (same armor and<br/>\nweapons should be used and preferably stats, and of course the applicable<br/>\nspells) and see what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\nTenin (DE - lvl 7 - Tarew Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Adam Hill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adamthehill@...\">adamthehill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 05, 1999 2:31 PM<br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] A Lil more oon the duel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Adam Hill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adamthehill@...\">adamthehill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAllright, lets do this in detail.<br/>\nMy guildmate and i had  friendly duel. He was a 18th level Halfling Druid I<br/>\nmyslef was a 17th level Dark Elf Shadowknight. He had full leather and a<br/>\nscreaming mace. I had a shiny brass halberd, Full bronze Platemail, 110 str<br/>\nafter siphoning. He rooted me and blasted me with a spell doing 37 pts a<br/>\nturn and Stinging swarm. I got the joy of casting my three spells at him<br/>\nuntil i was un rooted and harm touched him. The harm touch did HALF a bubble<br/>\nYES HALF. after he was taxed. Now at melee. My halberd was doing about one<br/>\nto twenty nine pints of damage. at one time in the duel, I did one point of<br/>\ndamage three times in a row. Also, 75% of my spells were laughed off. the<br/>\nonly good thing i did in my fight was dodge and parry quite often(helps to<br/>\nbe a dark elf fer that). Well thats about that. Rather embarrasing and<br/>\ndisheartening. In beta I played a warrior and never lost a battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
