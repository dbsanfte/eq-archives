I don&#39;t think finished. I&#39;m sure there is more to it, but I<br/>\n&gt; retrieve it, decoded it, and returned it to Pietro. Wondering how others<br/>\n&gt; were doing with this as this list has been quiet. I&#39;m so happy to have<br/>\n&gt; finally finished this part of it ... my notes are scribbled all over the<br/>\n&gt; place on stuff and what people said and all that rigamaroll.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So ... has anyone else been working on it?
