I<br/>\n&gt; finally got a Feign off and it worked even with them<br/>\n&gt; beating on me. It lasts forever as long as you just<br/>\n&gt; lay there. I believe the aggro eventually leaves the<br/>\n&gt; MOB, so you can theoretically, get up and walk away<br/>\n&gt; after they are out of sight. Try that one at your own<br/>\n&gt; risk though.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The aggro leaves immediately.  However, if you are<br/>\nKOS with teh mob, they will attack again as soon as you stand <br/>\nup.  Other mobs though, feign and stand right back up and <br/>\nthey will ignore you.  Perfect for in-city assassination.<br/>\nKill them fast with HT, feign, and then get up and leave <br/>\nlike nothing had happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
