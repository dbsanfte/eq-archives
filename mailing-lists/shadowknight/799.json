I remember that Brian<br/>\nmentioned that we had to do something that would increase the power of the<br/>\nsmaller races while not doing anything (or not much) to the larger races.<br/>\nWhat about Kick?? It would give the smaller races a nice extra attack<br/>\n(nothing too much), yet the larger already have an extra so it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nanything new to them. I know it&#39;s not a lot of damage but anything is nice,<br/>\nand when you consider that the majority of SK&#39;s use 2hs it makes sense<br/>\n(Since we really can&#39;t use Bash - Especially in group situations where you<br/>\nhave to kill the Mob quickly).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso do NOT give us a lifetap. They are slow and useless, if you have ever<br/>\nseen a necro cast one you know what I&#39;m talking about. Considering how far<br/>\ndown the Necro spell list we are the ones we would be given would be<br/>\ncompletely useless to us. I would much rather see spells like Poison,<br/>\nInfectious Cloud, Addtl Shields and Cure Disease.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just some thoughts..<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
