I would assume that the +5hp is not a<br/>\nregeneration just adds 5hp to someone which to me (and I would think a lot<br/>\nof higher level players) is worthless along with the mana, and I already get<br/>\nAC1 from my cutthroat rings without the 10pp cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, did anyone find out about the &quot;Bind ring&quot; that is in the Necro/SK<br/>\nguild house, or is that a broken quest also?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a full suit of leather armor.  I was just wondering what is the<br/>\nproper order of increase that the armor should be?  I think I have it as:<br/>\n<br/>\nLeather<br/>\nBanded<br/>\nChain<br/>\nBronze Plate<br/>\nPlate<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no clue if I am missing something.  I need to get to the next level,<br/>\nand don&#39;t think I can do it without getting better armor (which would be<br/>\nbanded if I am correct).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard rumors about killing so many residents of Befallen that you<br/>\neventually can&#39;t get into our guild with out a KOS from the ghouls outside,<br/>\nwith out casting inv to undead.  Is this true or false or don&#39;t know.  I<br/>\nconsider the ghouls and they con warmly to me right now, not sure what that<br/>\nmeans other than they aren&#39;t going to attack me right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I be hunting in Befallen ... alone?  (I really don&#39;t care about the<br/>\nabove, as long as the npc inside don&#39;t attack me along with their pets).<br/>\nAnd can I get armor their for free off the SK&#39;s in the back?  Just a note I<br/>\nhate rabies.  And I guess does anyone know of an item (Jewelry) that would<br/>\nprotect me/us from disease, a 100% would be nice?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is about it for now.  I am sure I will have more questions later...<br/>\nif the list goes dead again :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTenin - Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
