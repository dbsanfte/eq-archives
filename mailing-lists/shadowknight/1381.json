But remember<br/>\nto cast it on each MOB you fight.  You will still only gain the strength<br/>\nbonus once.<br/>\n<br/>\nthink of attack delay as the number of seconds between attacks.  so a 7<br/>\ndamage 30 delay weapon will attack once every 3 seconds.  a 35 delay every 3<br/>\nand 1/2 seconds, etc.  Buffs and equipment can reduce that delay (haste<br/>\nspells, quickness, FBSS) and that reduces the delay of your weapon(s).  Also<br/>\nyou can give your pet a weapon and armor.  I usually find a rusty 2 handed<br/>\nsword and watch my pet hit for alot more.<br/>\n<br/>\nChip:  Hey, that 400pp was all I had :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKen: yeah, back in my day there were also no beggars :)  none of us had<br/>\nanything :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Jones [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjones@...\">jjones@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 16, 2000 2:44 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@egroups.com\">shadowknight@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] 9th Level!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hit level 9 last night and ran like the clappers to Grobb to buy all my <br/>\nspells.  There awful cheap when you think we have to level 9 to start <br/>\ncasting them!!!  I bought them all and was practicing them on some poor <br/>\nhelpless Froglok Tads near the bashers!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus I got to help some brand new characters against multiple Kobold&#39;s <br/>\nganging up on then, since I was in the area!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a couple of question for you experts out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n1 - Does that drain strength spell only work the once on you, ie It does or <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stack???<br/>\n<br/>\n2 - How does the Attack delay work on weapons???  I have both the Bone <br/>\nClaymore and then Big axe from Lynuga, I&#39;ve been using the Axe but I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure which is better?<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells are great especially Summon Skelly, it&#39;s actually nice to have <br/>\nsomebody to walk around with, since I solo most of the time.  I never seem <br/>\nto have players on-line at my level!! Oh well!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yea, I&#39;m on the Quellious Server, which had it&#39;s First Birthday <br/>\nYesterday, so any of you out there fancy playing a Troll Shadow Knight on a <br/>\nnew server come join me and build up quick, then we could start our own <br/>\nexclusive Guild!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJames(Goraknor the Troll)<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nPtS plc, Manor Park Avenue, Manor Park, Cheshire, WA7 1TL, UK<br/>\nVoice:   +44 (0)1928 579800<br/>\nFax  :   +44 (0)1928 579801<br/>\nEmail:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjones@...\">jjones@...</a><br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n** www.pts.com - Where e-development Comes Together<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHope this isn&#39;t too offensive- trust me, it&#39;s better than the Elian one.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6011/14/_/451547/_/962178332/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6011/14/_/451547/_/962178332/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
