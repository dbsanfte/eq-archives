And he was actually first on the faction<br/>\nlist, as opposed to being last in the Trumpy one.<br/>\nSince the first part of the Bayle List is the easiest<br/>\nto get, i recommend doing it whenever you happen to<br/>\nrun thru HH.<br/>\nHowever, if you turn in part one, then try to turn it<br/>\nin again, he may not care, since he still &quot;has&quot; it.<br/>\nAll 3 may have to be given in order for you to be able<br/>\nto get faction from just the first again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorth some experimenting with though.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Chip Paul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was in the Bloodsaber guild, and in walks Kane<br/>\n&gt; Bayle.
