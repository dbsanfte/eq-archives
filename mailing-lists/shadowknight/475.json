I currently play an ogre<br/>\nshadowknight<br/>\n&gt; lvl 22 on Povar.  I haven&#39;t really tried the fear and then chase to get a<br/>\n&gt; few hits in, but I definitly like the sound of it.  I normally hit with a<br/>\n&gt; darkness spell, then a str sapping spell and melee away.  My warrior side<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; much better than my spell casting side, so I play the tank mostly.  I<br/>\nalways<br/>\n&gt; try to group with a cleric if possible.  Also, I TOTALLY agree with having<br/>\n&gt; your pet, I even try to get one when in a group.  This morning I was<br/>\n&gt; fighting in Highpass Hold (MY GOD, how many do I have to kill before I can<br/>\n&gt; go into HH :)  )  and they drop a lot of the rusty weapons.  I gave my pet<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; rusty mace and he was hitting in the range of 15-18.  Very nice little<br/>\n&gt; addition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have almost full bronze on finally, with a few exceptions.  I have a<br/>\n&gt; grotesque mask, and I finally got a greater zweihander (sp), which reminds<br/>\n&gt; me, i&#39;m selling a  2handed well balanced, magical axe on that server which<br/>\n&gt; normally sells for about 550 from the shady guy in the ecommons/nro<br/>\ntunnel.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m selling it for around 300 if anyone is interested.  I am also curious<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; to what type of armour/items other ogre sk&#39;s are wearing and any<br/>\nsuggestoins<br/>\n&gt; they might have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chris/Barto.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Tony Donatelli [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d1ng0@...\">d1ng0@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 30, 1999 7:50 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [shadowknight] list and stuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Tony Donatelli&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d1ng0@...\">d1ng0@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wow, Beld, excellent response, this is exactly what I was looking for.<br/>\nThe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great thing is I&#39;m on Fennin Ro too. I&#39;ll be sure to ask you some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game now that I know you&#39;re there. =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks again, man.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dravith (13)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PS: Also, any character descriptions I&#39;d love to hear. Tell me about<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; &gt; race, level, equipment, weapon, favorite spells, etc. I just wanna hear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about other SKs, what they&#39;re wearing, how they&#39;re living...
