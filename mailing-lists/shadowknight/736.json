Vampiric embrace for an SK right now <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t replace that much health and is a random event.  Lifetap can be cast <br/>\nwhen we need to replace hp.  Generally Rangers and Paladians can cast heals <br/>\nmainly after combat and SK&#39;s have a huge downtowntime as a result.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now if I play without a healer type in the party VE is the only way to <br/>\nget HP back (other then bandaging after the fact).  And when it does go off, <br/>\nit really seems to piss off the mob and then they hit me for twice as much <br/>\nas I just embraced for.  ouchie!<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------<br/>\nLet me ask this -- if Vampiric Embrace was replaced with a Lifetap, would <br/>\nthat be considered an improvement?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
