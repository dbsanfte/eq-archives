IE<br/>\nwhy can&#39;t I use the Grobb Cleaver dangit? I have one sitting in my bank<br/>\nright now and, goldarnit, it is annoying that I can&#39;t use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, why is there no way now for a Human SK to raise faction with<br/>\n&quot;thedead&quot; the only way I knew how previously was to do the beetle eye quest<br/>\n(I never actually got to try it before, see if I got laughed at or it<br/>\nworked) but I was never able to get the box. Previously the box oculd be<br/>\ngiven to me by a friend but now that it is no-drop there is no way for me to<br/>\nraise faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny Human SK or any SK for that matter know of a way for me to raise my<br/>\nfaction with &quot;thedead&quot; I want to be liked in my guild but I still have to<br/>\ninvis-undead past the ghouls and I can&#39;t get any DE SK quests because I am<br/>\nhated.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, I&#39;m logging in to kill some pecks so the outside guards like me<br/>\nmore. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nsee you all later,<br/>\n<br/>\nvirten<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Brian Hook [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 17, 1999 3:42 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [shadowknight] I give up<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo do you think that equipment quests are a viable alternative?
