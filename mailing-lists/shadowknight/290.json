Once you&#39;re up, you simply wait for the ship like anyone<br/>\nelse, there are no more npcs to get in your way.<br/>\nUnfortunately I doubt any of this would work with Trolls or Ogres, since the<br/>\nnpcs who do not attack DE&quot;s probably do attack Trolls and Ogres.<br/>\nCon the npcs to find out for sure tho, although invis is always the safest<br/>\nbet.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Steven E.
