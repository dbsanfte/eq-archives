I would remove the pets (they are just a novelty to me and have no use in group play [my primary style of play]) and replace them with an equivalent powered lifetap series.  Correct choice of which version of the spell would be important.  The damage/heal of the lifetap should be greater in power than the damage that the pet does because the pet only needs to be summoned once whereas lifetap must be cast throughout the combat.  This will result in slightly less downtime between battles, but will be balanced by the fact that we will need to mediatate to get the mana back that we used to cast the lifetaps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe high level pet utility/buff spells should be replaced with DoT&#39;s like Blood Boil, etc.  It is well known that our higher level spells....well....aren&#39;t so good.  Give us the DoT&#39;s back.  A second choice here would be undead effecting spells (i.e. Dominate Undead, Expulse Undead, Root Undead, etc.). <br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO, lifetap fits more into the character of a SK than summoned pets do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nScragg Wraithbone of Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
