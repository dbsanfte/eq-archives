My suicide run through Qeynos and again into the Freeport<br/>\nMilitia house have both been unsuccessful even while invis.  However, I<br/>\nbind in Surefall Glade occasionaly, and can make faces at those guards<br/>\nand they never blink.  Invis never works 100%, but it is still the<br/>\nsweetest tool we have at level 30.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2) How long does feign death last? Indefinitely? Is it usable in combat<br/>\n&gt; situations? ie I am generally the only non-gater in my group. Does it cast<br/>\n&gt; quickly like shadow step so that I can cast it after taunting 5 mobs on me<br/>\n&gt; so my group can gate out of there? I know my girlfriend is looking forward<br/>\n&gt; to me getting feign death after I explained how it works because she started<br/>\n&gt; the game only recently but expects me to help her level. Hmmm. No Level no<br/>\n&gt; Lovin&#39;? Heh.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First of all, don&#39;t DOT anything you plan on feigning.  They will<br/>\ncontinue to attack you, and by doing so, all the other enemies will<br/>\nsee through it as well.  I have never seen it run out, it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nput up a spell effect like invis, you just hit the sit button to stand<br/>\nup, or meditate, or whatever.  Also, you will want to practice the<br/>\nfeign pull, it is very handy and your groups will love you for <br/>\ncamp breaking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) About time we got a disease spell (Endure Disease). As someone else has<br/>\n&gt; said in the past ... it owuld really make sense for us to get CURE disease<br/>\n&gt; like necros. You should be able to undo anything that you can do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t had a bad disease in a while, but I hear Sol B has some<br/>\nnew ones to enjoy.  I travel with a cleric.  &#39;Nuff said.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo comment on the rest.  I used my pet just teh other day to solo guards <br/>\nand such, not bad when you get him behind the mobs, double attacking for<br/>\n11-18 and bashing to boot.  Of course I was giving him decent (not <br/>\nrusty) weapons and always kept him behind them.  So don&#39;t discount<br/>\nthem yet.  They are great outdoors for soloing, probably doing 200<br/>\nor so damage in combat.  Not bad with Heat Blood and Engulfing going<br/>\nat the same time.  Throw in a fear and a blue is dead with less than <br/>\na bar of damage to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
