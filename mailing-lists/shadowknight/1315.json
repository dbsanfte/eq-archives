However the big find I made had me rolling on the floor. I<br/>\nwas in Rathe Mountains selling at the gypsie camp when for the hell of it I<br/>\nstarted looking at what she had to sell. The very last item in her list was<br/>\na Silvery War Axe (1HS, 6/22, magic: buy from a player for 250 pp). With 104<br/>\ncharisma, she sold it for under 6 pp!  I was so excited that I accidentally<br/>\nbought a FS Scimitar for 56pp! Even though I wasted 51pp, I still made out<br/>\nlike a bandit. That reminds me. Why is a Combine Scimi 14pp less than a FS<br/>\nScimi? It makes no sense, neither does the axe being less than a Kite<br/>\nshield. Oh well. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not quite ready to start playing Lasombra yet, need to double check<br/>\nwhere I put my starting points. I may need to recreate him based on the<br/>\nadvise you have given me. The time is close though, I am getting tired of<br/>\nnot being able to melee as well as I would like. I lost and regained 26th<br/>\nlevel 4 times in one day this weekend, I was not happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions for hunting grounds after say 9th level? Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nLasombra<br/>\n1st Tier of Hate</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
