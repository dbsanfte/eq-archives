I think they are<br/>\nuseful for those levels.<br/>\nBut once i hit 22, i never used my pet other than to<br/>\npractice my Evocation for Ward Undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point i think the pets can be done away with.<br/>\n<br/>\nReplace them with a line of shields like Shieldskin.<br/>\nOr something damage oriented.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe debate about Banshee Aura making us too powerful<br/>\nmay keep us from getting that line instead of the Skin<br/>\nline. Although an 8 point damage spell, i dont<br/>\nbelieve, would make us over powered. We would have<br/>\ngotten that spell at level 39. 8 points per hit to us<br/>\nat level 39 would be useful, without being too much.<br/>\nSure we get hit alot, but what we are fighting will<br/>\nhave a lot of HP. It fits into our RP perfectly. We do<br/>\ndamage. Banshee does damage. Sounds like a match to<br/>\nme.<br/>\nPlus when they made this decision, no SKs were even<br/>\nclose to hitting 39. They did this very early in the<br/>\ngame. I dont see how they determined that we would be<br/>\ntoo strong with it, when no one had even gotten it<br/>\nyet.<br/>\nMaybe some in the Betas, but im betting there werent<br/>\nenough high level SKs i Beta for them to make a valid<br/>\ndecision.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thats it for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll torture you folks more a little later on<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
