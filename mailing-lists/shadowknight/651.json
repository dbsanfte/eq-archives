In must cases the creatures you are <br/>\nfighting doing more damage than you.  Is ok in groups, <br/>\nbut I solo mostly.<br/>\nExample.<br/>\nWith 1HS @ 61 skill or so, I max damage at 9 (includes <br/>\nSTR bonus from Siphon Strength).  With my 2HS @68ish and <br/>\na FS2HS I max damage at 25ish.  Using each weapon on the <br/>\nsame creature that cons blue this is what happens to me.<br/>\nWith 2HS I have more than half life and mana left. With <br/>\n1HS I have 1 bubble or so left and no mana.  This was <br/>\ndone vs Skeles in Befallen. They hit for 18-22 max a pop <br/>\nvs a 9 with a whip and my delay is still more than their <br/>\nnatural delay even with a whip.  <br/>\nGranted having 1HS maxed for the Dark Reaver is the way <br/>\nto go, but at 35th level to get that blade, I won&#39;t be <br/>\nusing 1 HS!
