Ok, so healing and any type of downtime reduction<br/>\nis right out, I can live with that (I got used to it, played a mostly-solo<br/>\nwarrior to 31). But Banshee Aura (et. al) would be wonderful! Rangers get<br/>\nthorns, dangit, let me chill some kobolds to the bone! It&#39;s also more damage<br/>\nwe can put out, HENCE Beld wouldn&#39;t mind it. Go damage shields go! Good<br/>\nthinking, man!<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, the only 39 spell I&#39;m looking forward to is Heart Flutter, all the<br/>\nothers are, well... crap. (sorry Brian) Cancel Magic, ok for those dots that<br/>\njust won&#39;t come off. Shadow Vortex, gimme a break, no one EVER uses that<br/>\nspell. Pet spell, shah right. Shield Skin, heh what a joke, absorb one hit<br/>\nfor a ton of mana AND reagents, no thanks my 136 Agi will do a better job<br/>\nfor free.
