This won&#39;t help your cause any.  Sign a petition, do<br/>\nsomething, but actively attempting to annoy/&quot;raise attention&quot; from the GMs<br/>\nrarely works, if anything it raises animosity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve suffered through this myself, where someone sets up a Web site to get<br/>\nsome issue addressed with our games.  There&#39;s a form letter, a space to<br/>\nfill in your e-mail, and then a &quot;click here to send this e-mail&quot; button.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens is we get flooded with e-mail for about three days.  But after<br/>\nthe first half dozen or so, the others are deleted because they&#39;re easy to<br/>\nidentify.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we do a mass /feedback, and the ones after the first half dozen will be<br/>\ndiscarded, unread.  Hell, anything to do with SKs likely will be discarded<br/>\nunread on the assumption it&#39;s something to do with the mass feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
