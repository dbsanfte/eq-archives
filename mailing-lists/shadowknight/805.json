If a big brute of an Ogre SK can&#39;t cast a Damage shield<br/>\non himself, a Druid or Magician is going to cast one on him for him.  If you<br/>\nwant to balance it in such a way to give Races in SK&#39;s a little more<br/>\nvariation, play off their str&#39;s and weaknesses.  A DE SK has FAR more INT<br/>\nthen an Ogre or Trolls, so play off that.  Even with REALLY high int a DE SK<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have that much Mana, so other then faster skill increases it doesn&#39;t<br/>\npay off to be smarter.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn side gripe I have about ogres trolls vs DEs is the whole HIDE vs SLAM<br/>\nissue.  They eventually get to learn how to hide at level 35, so why don&#39;t<br/>\nwe get to learn some kind of should body check move (ie slam).  This<br/>\ngenerally doesn&#39;t do my damage anyways, and is just good good for<br/>\ndisruppting spells.  I think a DE has a tad more agi then either of those<br/>\ntwo and could easily do a double backflip and land on the casters head.<br/>\nheheh.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tony Donatelli&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:donatea@...\">donatea@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; You are correct, the damage shields were far too powerful if put on a big<br/>\n </span></blockquote>SK<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; (ogre/troll).  Your comments about Shadow Step are interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is it too powerful because of their low agility? They get hit a lot and so a<br/>\ndamage shield would be too effective? Is that it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just a quick poll of my own -- How many troll/ogre SKs do we have here?<br/>\nI&#39;m a dark elf, and I know Cro is a troll. What about the rest of you guys?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Lifetap/spike/draw would be used near the end of a melee in a group --<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; could use it as a quick heal to minimize downtime.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; And personally, it has always been my idea that an SK feeds off the life<br/>\n &gt; force of the weak, so after a fight walking around and sucking the life<br/>\n </span></blockquote>out<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; of gnolls and orcs sounds very in character...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True, but in a DUNGEON situation, where you WILL be after say level 30,<br/>\nthere aren&#39;t any gnolls or orcs just wandering around waiting to be<br/>\nvampired. So the only things you could lifetap would be those mobs that<br/>\nyou&#39;re actually fighting. And then you get back into the pull-back-to-cast<br/>\ntactic that so many of us despise. I&#39;m still pushing for damage shields. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDravith Vandre&#39;i<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
