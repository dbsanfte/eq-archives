Have any other DE SKs tried this?  I&#39;m<br/>\ninterested in how you were able to get out to Kerra island.  I have a<br/>\nfeeling that I&#39;ll be KOS in Quenos.  Is there a way to get to Kerra<br/>\nisland without going through Quenos?  Is there some sort of way through<br/>\nQuenos similar to the sewers in freeport that is safe for DEs?  I&#39;d<br/>\nlove to hear from anyone who&#39;s done this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nAtrocity<br/>\nBertoxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
