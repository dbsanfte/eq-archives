Kill<br/>\nher, bring her lute to Grimrot and you get a mold and<br/>\nnote for that electrum bladed whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, the electrum thingy was moved to the<br/>\nAvenging Caitiff.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, i have yet to actually step foot in MM. Though<br/>\nthat trip is near. But i know several who have scoured<br/>\nMM and no Arlena has been sited.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone heard anything about an NPC named Arlena<br/>\neither in or around MM?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd also, has anyone gotten a &quot;lute&quot; quest from<br/>\nGrimrot, as opposed to the &quot;Bones&quot; one that i have<br/>\nreceived? To recap that: Grimmy wants you to find<br/>\nArlena and return her bones. I have a screenshot of<br/>\nthis to prove my sanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow there have been NPCs that my friends were unable<br/>\nto get to or defeat. One was a Princess, cloaked<br/>\nvampyre (sp?). Maybe one of these were Arlena in<br/>\ndisguise?<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone questioned the Avenging Caitiff about<br/>\nArlena? Are there any other NPCs in there that will<br/>\nspeak with us without the usual &quot;YOU MUST DIE&quot; message<br/>\nfollowing?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust curious as to what others have found..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
