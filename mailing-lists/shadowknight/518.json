All you need to do is &quot;Hail&quot; him for<br/>\nthat one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as payoffs. At least when i did them, which was<br/>\nquite a while ago, there was no great rewards. Though<br/>\ni will say that they were indeed fun to do. Most<br/>\nhowever will be extremely easy for you now. They are<br/>\nmostly for level 12 and under.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Arlena quest is a 30 plus though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as far as Grimrot goes, we went on 3 different<br/>\ntrips and waited an hour each time before he finally<br/>\nshowed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Jeremy Pollack &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpollack@...\">jpollack@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Jeremy Pollack&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpollack@...\">jpollack@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am an Innoruuk worshipping Shadowknight so I am<br/>\n&gt; not particularly welcomed<br/>\n&gt; in Qeynos (um, does this have anything to do with<br/>\n&gt; the 20 or so guards I have<br/>\n&gt; killed? Heh) but I was wondering, do all the Grimrot<br/>\n&gt; quests originate in<br/>\n&gt; Qeynos, or can I just talk to Grimrot himself? I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; currently in S Karana<br/>\n&gt; anyways, but can&#39;t ever seem to catch him. I have no<br/>\n&gt; idea who this Arlena is<br/>\n&gt; but I hope to find out soon if I can ever catch this<br/>\n&gt; guy. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How many SK quests are there in Qeynos and are there<br/>\n&gt; any that are worth it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Virten<br/>\n&gt; Human SK of Neriak, 21st training<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate<br/>\n&gt; to Amazon.com.  <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out<br/>\n&gt; how.
