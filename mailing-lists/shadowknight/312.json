And if you count on HT to beat anything you attack, you get what<br/>\n&gt;you deserve. BUT, thats no excuse for it not working, in my opinion. If<br/>\n&gt;it works to its full potential and you still die, which has happened to<br/>\n&gt;me, then so be it. But it should be something you can count on to at<br/>\n&gt;least work when an emergency arises.<br/>\n&gt;And in no way am i saying that SKs are powerless or have no potential.<br/>\n&gt;However HT still is not the equal of LoH which its supposed to be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Regardless of our differences of opinion on this, i would like to know<br/>\n&gt;what you feel would be an effective way to bring our concerns to the<br/>\n&gt;Dev team, whatever they may be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for responding,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bathory<br/>\n&gt;Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- Leif Smart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leifsmart@...\">leifsmart@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Leif Smart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leifsmart@...\">leifsmart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ok, I can see your point with the Harm Touch.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, I&#39;m at level 14 now and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gave up usuing Harm Touch for anything but emergancy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; purposes. Either to save<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself or as the mother of all taunts to save<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone else. If I don&#39;t think I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; win with my sword then I don&#39;t fight, I never think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; well if I HT it, it will be an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; even fight.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We must also remmeber that we get a pet. Woopee Doo!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You might think, it&#39;s a crap<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one. But it does server many great uses. First, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an extra attack during<br/>\n&gt; &gt; battle, somewhat makingup for our lack of Duel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wield. It&#39;s a great way to get rid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of those annoying rusty short swords, since it makes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the pet more effective. And<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alos, it is a great delaying and early warning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; device. My pet has saved me from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; giants on a number of times.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Inos<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist has over 115,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
