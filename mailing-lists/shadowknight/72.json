He will then say something about what a good job you did and offer a<br/>\nsecond ,more difficult quest to you. This quest involves collecting 4 fire<br/>\nbeetle eyes in a box much similar to the first one but these eyes must come<br/>\nfrom Kerra Isle. Also,you must bring back a Bull Elephant tusk which can be<br/>\nfound in the plains around Qyneos. I have yet to complete the part of the<br/>\nquest but hop to do so this week end,I will keep all abreast of my progress<br/>\nand if any of you have completed the quest I would be very corious about the<br/>\nreward. Also as we are KOS in Qyneos and must pass thru there to reach the<br/>\nboat that goes to Kerra Isle I would like info on how to get to the docks.I<br/>\nhave been told those of evil herratige must take the sewers under the city<br/>\nto get there and they are quite confusing,thats what I am told anyway,any<br/>\ninfo you all mat have would be great.<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNassu,Dark Knight of Innoruuk,Fennin Ro<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Stephen Alexander &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SAlexander@...\">SAlexander@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, April 23, 1999 11:19 AM<br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] Nerriak Quest Frustration<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Stephen Alexander &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SAlexander@...\">SAlexander@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just finished a quest I got in the Lodge of the Dead to gather 10<br/>\n&gt;beetle eyes in a box.
