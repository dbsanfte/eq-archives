Plus the <br/>\ntrains to the zones by people that fight in the path <br/>\nthat the Imps and Elementals wander, is enough to drive <br/>\nyou nuts. I noticed that a ele or imp or drake wanders <br/>\njust outside the doors of Najena  from the valley on the <br/>\nright to the valley on the left 20 minutes after <br/>\nfighting in that area.<br/>\nI have faught there quite a bit. Loot is great, when it <br/>\nis dropped. ;) Is how I got the guild jeweler all his <br/>\nstarting materials until those stones became trivial.  I <br/>\nstill give them to him to sell so he can buy the stones <br/>\nhe needs. He has a better charisma than me. ;) Suprise.<br/>\nThanks for the adbise though.  I am just bored with the <br/>\nzones I tend to fight in. Halas would be gret, but the <br/>\ntrek from Qeynos would drive me nuts, especially through <br/>\nBB.  BB may be fun, but I&#39;m afraid it would be like <br/>\nanother Splitpaw.  Plus to get there alive would be a <br/>\nventure in itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
