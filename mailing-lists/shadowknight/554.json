My<br/>\nquestion is,  &quot;Do we SK&#39;s become very powerful at LVL 22?&quot;  The reason that<br/>\ni ask this is because i&#39;ve heard a few people say that if u hold on and keep<br/>\nplaying and hit lvl 22 that u won&#39;t be disappointed.  As of right now i<br/>\nbasically am a weak warrior with a few weak spells.  Do our spells improve<br/>\ngreatly?  I sure hope so, because from what i&#39;ve been told SK&#39;s are one of<br/>\nthe strongest high lvl classes there is... so let me know something u higher<br/>\nlvl players!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last question... Which is better using a 2H Slashing weapon our using a<br/>\n1H Slashing Weapon with bash?  Hehe, and don&#39;t tell me it depends on the<br/>\nweapon... my question is overall.... Just wondering because if 2H Slashing<br/>\nis better then I&#39;ll have to start lvling it up..<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Brothers,<br/>\n<br/>\nArikor<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Shanti Ashtangi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zealpath@...\">zealpath@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, July 29, 1999 6:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [shadowknight] Even more on ebw...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Shanti Ashtangi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zealpath@...\">zealpath@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Tony Donatelli [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d1ng0@...\">d1ng0@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: July 29, 1999 4:38 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [shadowknight] Even more on ebw...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;First off, no, there is no way in hell that your party of 20s or 22s can<br/>\n&gt;kill Arlena. She is in Mistmoore and she is a gyspy. Getting to Mistmoore<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;a slight pain unless you can teleport over somewhere near there (and back).<br/>\n&gt;Arlena is at least level 30. I say this because even the UNNAMED gyspy<br/>\n&gt;musicians in Mistmoore are level 30, and they all can CHARM quite well. So,<br/>\n&gt;be careful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dekam N&#39;Tazi may very well be in Neriak. N&#39;Tazi sounds like a dark elf name<br/>\n&gt;anyway. It was an assumption of mine he would be in Qeynos (cuz almost all<br/>\n&gt;the quests in the west have something to do with Qeynos). If the site says<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;s in Neriak, he&#39;s in Neriak. Come to think of it, that&#39;s actually a GOOD<br/>\n&gt;thing. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;DV<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The reason I said that was because a 23 shaman I was grouped with the other<br/>\n&gt;day told me that she was yellow to him (1 or 2 levels up) whether or not he<br/>\n&gt;was lying is up in the air, but that&#39;s the only reason I said that. I<br/>\n&gt;haven&#39;t seen her, and I wish someone who has could give us the real lowdown<br/>\n&gt;on her.<br/>\n&gt;And yes it would be nice if Dekam is in Neriak, as I don&#39;t think Queynos<br/>\n </span></blockquote>has<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;an easy to sneak into sewer system (but I know nothing about that).<br/>\n&gt;If someone out there has done this quest please post everything you know<br/>\n&gt;about it please hehe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\n&gt;If you join ONElistï¿½s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
