You re arguement","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-150513844\">I really couldn&#39;t tell you how the class is power wise all the way up.  I<br/>\nhad thought we would be one of the most powerfull....eventually. You&#39;re<br/>\narguement gave me something to think about now and to watch for.  Thats<br/>\nthe whole reason I am sticking it out.  As a DE I earn exp slow...as a SK<br/>\ni earn it even slower.  The two slowest growing exp hounds are SK&#39;s and<br/>\nTrolls.  Humans are supposed to earn exp the quickest basically...but then<br/>\nintelligence and class are also factored in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven if the SK is underpowered...its still a blast to play...and I think<br/>\neventually will be a powerfull class, especially if they enhance our spell<br/>\nlist a little bit.  They think the HT power increases us so much...but it<br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t.  Its something like every 45 or 1 hour and 45 minutes i<br/>\ncan really blast a critter...but the rest of the time I&#39;m a weak warrior.<br/>\nThe paladin is more of a warrior than us...and has healing to boot.  I<br/>\nthink our warrior part should be boosted...and maybe our spell list<br/>\nenhanced...then you will see power.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for SK&#39;s being weak...well only time will tell.  I read a poll recently<br/>\nwhere the two most popular race/class combos were human paladins and DE<br/>\nSK&#39;s.  Wait a few more months and see how many SK&#39;s are still in the<br/>\nlands....that will tell you surely how well they fare at later levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nKorm</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
