It rounds out our<br/>\ndistences ( with out spells)  so that we can more fulfil the back and<br/>\nsupport roles if we have lots of tanks in the group. If we have to stand<br/>\nback due to to much damange (usually because we disease the target) then<br/>\nwe can still hit the target and contribute. I myself have a lovely rough<br/>\nElm bow, and a skill of 45+ so I quite consistantly hit for 14 damage,<br/>\nwhich is quite good for someone who is sitting back and healing. When we<br/>\nget out pets, we can let teh pet tank for us while we archer away. The<br/>\npet will no doubt die, but then we don&#39;t have to split the xp for it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe downside is of course the cost. There is very little chance of<br/>\ntaking up fletching due to Rangers totally dominating that trade and<br/>\nquite disliking SK&#39;s. However you will easily be able to buy a bow from<br/>\nthem, mine cost 5p, and there is one slightly lesser bow for 2p. Arrows<br/>\ncan usually be bought for about 9c each, which is quite resonable. But<br/>\nit will take a lot of effort. I must have gone thruogh close to 1000<br/>\narrows by now, but I beleive it has been worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does everyone else think? Any other experiences?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
