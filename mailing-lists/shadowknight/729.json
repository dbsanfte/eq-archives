Ok, so healing and any type of downtime reduction<br/>\n&gt; is right out, I can live with that (I got used to it, played a mostly-solo<br/>\n&gt; warrior to 31). But Banshee Aura (et. al) would be wonderful! Rangers get<br/>\n&gt; thorns, dangit, let me chill some kobolds to the bone! It&#39;s also more damage<br/>\n&gt; we can put out, HENCE Beld wouldn&#39;t mind it. Go damage shields go!

(sorry Brian) Cancel Magic, ok for those dots that<br/>\n&gt; just won&#39;t come off. Shadow Vortex, gimme a break, no one EVER uses that<br/>\n&gt; spell. Pet spell, shah right. Shield Skin, heh what a joke, absorb one hit<br/>\n&gt; for a ton of mana AND reagents, no thanks my 136 Agi will do a better job<br/>\n&gt; for free.

Shieldskin<br/>\nwould have saved you there.  Also Resist Cold might help when fighting<br/>\nwizards who use AE frost spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know the damage and ticks for Heart Flutter?  Or the <br/>\n-Str -AC effect that it has?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in teh last patch they said Heart Flutter works better now,<br/>\nhas anyone tried it to see the difference?<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
