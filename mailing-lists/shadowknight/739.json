Again, I think it is a race problem, not a class problem. I think these races make poor melee classes, whether they are paladins, SK , or warriors.  Just out of curiousity, does any troll/ogres here above level 25 think other melee classes are better than theirs? I have never thought I would be better off as a warrior. I mean, if a gnome warrior sucks, does that mean warriors suck? I have mudded for years. The same happens on many muds. Warrior classes are allowed for all races, though mage classes are not. If they let ogres/trolls/barbs make out wizards, I think they would think that wizards suck. For some reason warrior classes are given universal on most muds to all races, and mage classes are given mostly to the races that have attributes for a mage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMorgul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
