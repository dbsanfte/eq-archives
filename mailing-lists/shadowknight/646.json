We are a new guild, about 3 weeks old <br/>\nnow, and the highest member is currently 19th. I believe <br/>\nI am the next highest in the guild at the moment.  <br/>\nWhy am I telling you this?  Many reasons actually. <br/>\nFirst we are in need of more members as we have 17 right <br/>\nnow. <br/>\nSecond I don&#39;t want you to have any presumptions before <br/>\nattempting to join.<br/>\nThird we are tyring to make our presence known in <br/>\nNorrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in the charter building stage, and have just <br/>\nformed our Council of Elders. If anyone has experience <br/>\nwith the workings of a guild and positions like <br/>\nTreasurer, please send me some advise that has been <br/>\nbeneficial.<br/>\nAlso where is a good place to host a guild webpage? <br/>\nGeocities and any other that throws those stupid java <br/>\nwindows and &quot;a word from our sponsor&quot; messages suck, and <br/>\nlog my browser down, so I refuse to use those. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other news, I took a break from EQ this weekend and <br/>\nonly played a little on Friday night and long enough on <br/>\nSautrday for the guild meeting. I hope to level to 13th <br/>\nsoon as I am half way there.  I would have made it <br/>\nalready, but I was helping my wife level in Nektulos <br/>\nForrest Friday from 4th to 8th.  We didn&#39;t group and I <br/>\nused Taunt, Slam and Siphon Strength while she took out <br/>\nRed cons and got 1/2 a bubble of XP per creature. Most <br/>\nof these were Even and Blue to me. <br/>\nI died 3 times because of that damn Orc Runner in 45 <br/>\nminutes.  Took me the rest of the night to get that XP <br/>\nloss back too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny and all feedback welcome for guild info/advise, <br/>\nthanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n12th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
