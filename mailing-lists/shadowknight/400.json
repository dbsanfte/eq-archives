The annoying thing is that<br/>\nyou need to kill things in Befallen to complete this quest, which will<br/>\nlower your faction (faction in question is &#39;the dead&#39;) with the very<br/>\npeople you need to talk to to complete it. My DE SK was able to talk about<br/>\nthe ring with the NPC female until I started going to befallen. Now, the<br/>\nnpc gives me the standard &quot;I&#39;ll talk to you when you have proven your<br/>\nloyalty&quot;  line.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will not hinder my ablilty to complete the quest, but might prevent<br/>\nme from getting it recharged. I&#39;d have to have to turn in fire beetle<br/>\neyes, paladin heads, bull elephant tusks and kerran beetle eyes with the<br/>\nsame frequency I killed things in befallen just to get my ring recharged. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any comments, or have the same problems?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nLoet, CT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
