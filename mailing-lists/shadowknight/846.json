Evil races are harder by definition and<br/>\nactually I&#39;ve found a lot of zones where I can sell.. Next time you are in<br/>\nCazic or Guk ask the &quot;good&quot; races how easy it is to sell. I do a quick run<br/>\nto Oggok or Grobb they have to run to either the Gypsies in Rthe Mnts or<br/>\nthere is the Erudite in S. Ro. Most of the places you mention are on Faydwer<br/>\nwhich is intentional harder for the evil races.. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway..

Every<br/>\nother zone, with the exception of Dungeons, has at least one merchant in it<br/>\nexcept the newbie zone of an evil race. <br/>\nEverfrost has the merchants in the tunnel<br/>\nSteamfont has many merchants<br/>\nButcherblock has many merchants<br/>\nGreater Fay has the entire city of Kelethin open to Wood and High elves<br/>\nLesser Fay has the Ranger camp<br/>\nQeynos Hills has the house in the middle<br/>\nMisty Thicket has the halfling huts<br/>\nThe Commonlands...<br/>\nKithicor...<br/>\nThe Karanas ....<br/>\n <br/>\nWhy did Verant think it necessary to FORCE a character of an evil race to<br/>\nzone into a city to sell loot from the associated newbie zone?  That has<br/>\nbeen bugging me for quite a bit.  I hate having to zone to sell.  The major<br/>\nfactor here is that it takes me 2-2.5 minutes to zone one way.  If it only<br/>\ntook me 30 seconds like it does my wife, I may not have thought it a big<br/>\ndeal.  It may be an oversight by Verant, but I don&#39;t think it is a &quot;fair&quot;<br/>\nway of doing things.  The all-or-none principle comes to mind here.<br/>\nEnd of rant.<br/>\n <br/>\nPlease respond to this one Brian, even if it is a &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;.<br/>\nAnyone out there think this is worthy of a Petition?<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n <br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nServant of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
