Two things<br/>\nI notice as odd, was the quest text had [Bayle List], but I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nget him to go any further, and the quest told me to bring back her<br/>\nBayle List III.  I killed her just for good measure, no list there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, it seems like there must be a use for the other two<br/>\nBayle Lists.  Does anyone know if the Bayle List that Mammoth (the<br/>\nbear in Surefall) is rumored to carry is Bayle List III, or is<br/>\nit a totally unrelated item?  I wonder if there is someone you can<br/>\nturn all 3 parts in to?  Or a way to read/translate them...<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
