Wohoo. 2nd and most <br/>\nannoying, I cannot walk around the ledge of the pool of <br/>\nwater because my troll a$$ is too wide. :( So if I am in <br/>\nNeriak or the commonlands then I can walk to the guild <br/>\nfrom West FP to East FP and train, but need to leave via <br/>\nEast Treeport and Zone through the tunnel to the <br/>\ncommonlands. That is still better than going through <br/>\nOasis and both parts of Ro and the Innothule for half of <br/>\nthe trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone out there ever see the Spore Guardian?  I <br/>\nwandered the entire swamp last night for 2 hours looking <br/>\nfor him and only found fungusman trackers. Do you need <br/>\nto talk to the #2 for the SK guild to trigger him <br/>\nspawning?  Is there a certain time of the game day? It <br/>\nwas 6PM gametime when I started looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe swamp now gives very little XP except for the <br/>\noccasional fat and bull alligator, and the Lesser <br/>\nMummmies that spawn at the tower. Nothing over a <br/>\nFroglock Fisherman spawned last night. Aren&#39;t there <br/>\nhigher level Frogs that spawn in the swamp? If not then <br/>\nit looks like I will need to either try Guk solo or the <br/>\nbandit camps in South Ro. Of course it could be a time <br/>\nof game day issue again too.<br/>\n<br/>\nGot an Ogre to get me the HEHE meat from Chef Dooga. <br/>\nWhat a pain in the a$$.  The exchange went fine and we <br/>\nwere both very happy.  I talked for a while then went to <br/>\nput them in the bank for when I give them to Carver. <br/>\nWhile I was talking, I ATE ONE!  I was very POed! I had <br/>\n14 rations on me an the system had me eat a HEHE meat!<br/>\nThe ogre that got them for me said &quot;maybe that why it <br/>\ncalled HEHE...&quot; DOH!  Anyway, I paid him to go get me <br/>\nmore HEHE (5 this time in case he ate one by accident, <br/>\nand/or I ate another one) which I immediately ran and <br/>\nput in the bank. Now I have enough HEHE meat to do the <br/>\nQuest twice. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is VERY quiet. Make some noise people!!!!<br/>\nI don&#39;t care what you send. Just send something. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n10th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
