Those Vambraces do have nice stats and would be a nice piece until<br/>\nMithril or Umbral. I am curious on the color of it though, I just don&#39;t want<br/>\nany red armor (I know I&#39;m picky).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious though you have a SS of the BP are the stats what have been<br/>\nrumored with the bonus given to STA (would would make like 3 different Sk<br/>\narmor pieces that give a STA increase).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 22, 1999 9:53 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [shadowknight] decayed armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what ive seen it drops off of every Crusader now.<br/>\nMy dificulty, and it does seem to be me alone, is that<br/>\ni cant seem to kill any Crusaders.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been at the Archon, simply because there are<br/>\nmaybe 5 spots he has a chance to spawn in as opposed<br/>\nto one in UTR and AoF. Well, after 16 hours of temple<br/>\nhunting, we killed 4 Crusaders. Meanwhile a friend<br/>\nspent about 4 hours in UTR and got 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd i may add that all the parts that dropped in the<br/>\ntemple were pepeats or items i didnt care to get and<br/>\ntherefore passed them off to another SK who did want<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is simply my bad luck and apparently not<br/>\nthe situation with most.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have yet to actually get a pair of anything *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway a friend got the vambracers.
