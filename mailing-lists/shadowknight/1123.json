Since I own the spells they are replacing will the lifetaps already<br/>\nbe in my spell book? This is mainly out of curiosity since I won&#39;t be able<br/>\nto play for another 10 hrs or so.. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh and if you noticed they made two other changes that effect SK&#39;s. First<br/>\nthey added +4 to our Poison/Disease resistance (Always nice to get something<br/>\nyou didn&#39;t ask for), and it looks like they reduced the casting time and<br/>\nmana cost of Invoke Fear.. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing while I&#39;m thinking about spells, why do they give us<br/>\nUltravision at lvl 49 when they we have Deadeye at 22? Is ultravision that<br/>\nmuch better, or am I just missing something being a DE?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell that should do it for now.. Oh and it looks like they itemized Kedge<br/>\nkeep (I knew that Fish Bone earring would come in handy someday)..<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
