I just can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; seem to find anywhere that is really intersting (or find a good grp<br/>\n&gt; there).  I tried Karnor&#39;s recently but that place is a mess (and you<br/>\n&gt; get bad Venril Sathir (sp) faction (the outpost in OT))  so that was<br/>\n&gt; no good.  Many of the higher levels are either overcrowded or there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; just no-one there.  I solo a lot so I was wondering if anyone knew of<br/>\n&gt; anywhere good.  my Velious faction is with the giants (Ally, Warm and<br/>\n&gt; dumbarse Tormax still scowels, which would be nice to get some help<br/>\n&gt; w/).  I dunno, any ideas?
