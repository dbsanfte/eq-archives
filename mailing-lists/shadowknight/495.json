Could you clarify your comment on &quot;Voice Graft&quot; as<br/>\nand actual useful spell I really can&#39;t fathom any way to use it. (I&#39;m not 30<br/>\nyet so I can&#39;t actually test this one). Also on VE with what testing I&#39;ve<br/>\ndone (1hs), I&#39;ve only been able to get it to go off maybe 3 times max in<br/>\ncombat, does it happen more often the higher you go or am I missing<br/>\nsomething.. (Oh what type of damage does it do around lvl 30.. )<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 1hs vs 2hs, I play DE SK (23rd lvl) and I still prefer a good 1 handed<br/>\nweapon and a nice shield (I have a Shiny, going to get a Mistmoore over the<br/>\nweekend if at all possible). Besides being disappointed in selection of good<br/>\n1 handed magical weapons, I think it&#39;s a superior combo. I take longer than<br/>\nmy Troll friend to kill the MOB, but I take less damage in the process so it<br/>\nworks out even in the end (IMHO)..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Grant Vanderhule [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, July 02, 1999 9:51 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] strategies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ndont worry about the BIBS and GZ quite yet.. most non-twinks are unable to<br/>\nobtain these until high 20s to low 30s levels. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nas for harm touch, like i said in a previous post.. you gotta be kind of<br/>\ndevious to make it work. it is not really a DD, but a melee attack that hits<br/>\nfor magical damage. it is most effective when used from behind the monster<br/>\nor while it is trying to flee or stunned. this is why fear is such an<br/>\nexcellent spell..<br/>\n<br/>\nas for spells at 15 and 22.. buy em all i say, they are cheap by the time<br/>\nyou can cast em (they are the same as necro spells of 1/4th your level). but<br/>\nthe most important spells: at 15, fear and clinging darkness are the MUST<br/>\nBUY spells. the rest have their uses, but these two are required for the<br/>\ncombat strategy of DOT &gt; slow &gt; fear that works so well for us. at 22 your<br/>\nbest spells will be engulfing darkness, the upgrade to clinging darkness,<br/>\nand vampiric embrace, our first buff that we will actually USE. oh dont<br/>\ncomplain about VE you trollies, a dark elf with a 1h weapon is quite<br/>\neffective with it ;) also-rans include shadow step at 15 (the game&#39;s best<br/>\nduelling spell, so long as you learn how to keep your bearings when using<br/>\nit) and deadeye at 22 (if you are human, you finally get to see in the dark!<br/>\nif you are not, it also doubles as detect invis).<br/>\n<br/>\nby the way, those of you who say voice graft at 30 is a useless spell.. BAH.<br/>\nits by far the most hilarious spell myself or any of my group buddies have<br/>\never seen :) there&#39;s something about hearing the mob you are fighting<br/>\nscreaming for help and whining about how cruel you are..<br/>\n<br/>\npets: they are not your tank. they are there to get a few extra hits in<br/>\nedgewise. and this damage adds up, especially if you give it a weapon. (i<br/>\nbelieve that animate dead and higher necro pets are able to dual wield, but<br/>\ni can&#39;t confirm this..)<br/>\n<br/>\nalso... i&#39;ve heard that some DE sk swear by quicker 1hs and piercing weapons<br/>\nrather than big slow 2hs weapons. this is because dark elves can rely on<br/>\ntheir dex and agility in a fight to be hit less often and deal max damage<br/>\nmore, while the trolls and ogres use 2hs mostly because it emphasizes their<br/>\nincredible strength that much more. me, as a human, i use both ;) also, a<br/>\ndark elf sk with a fanged skull stiletto or thulian claw and VE drains life<br/>\nat an incredible rate.. it might be something worth looking into :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeld Demonblade<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n*still stuck in hell level. does this thing ever end?* :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many communities do you think join ONElist each week?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nMore than 5,000!
