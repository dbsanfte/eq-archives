Of course, with XMas and holidays I don&#39;t expect many of us will<br/>\nbe playing as much EQ. Well, I would if I *could* but damned if I don&#39;t have<br/>\nto go home for vacation. Would you believe I don&#39;t even own a modem!? I have<br/>\nto go buy one!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, for pure exp at a higher level, I found a great spot last<br/>\nnight. In Sol B by the zone in near the foreman room/singe&#39;s spawn. Just<br/>\nfight the local to that room and pull whatever you can. Zone is right there<br/>\nso moderately safe (our cleric died on a zone out because some jerk was<br/>\npulling huge, unannounced trains in Sol A.) and I got a bub and a half in<br/>\nabout 2.5 hours I think it was. That&#39;s amazing for me and I assume many of<br/>\nyou all too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 20- Go check out the treants in S Karana in a level or twow if you<br/>\ndont&#39; mind bad qeynos guard faction (well, druids too, but who cares about<br/>\ndruids? =D) You can level real fast there.<br/>\n<br/>\nhappy holidays all<br/>\n<br/>\nvirt</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
