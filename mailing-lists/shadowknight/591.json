Got if off a lucky<br/>\ntrade (GZ and Rubi bracer for it).  Can&#39;t wait for it to proc<br/>\nthe siphon strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nUmbral armor (Plane of Fear) is SK only, as is the Soul Leech.<br/>\nSeveral weapons on EQ&#39;Lizer are listed as SK/Warrior only.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main SK problem is 1H vs 2H.  My advice:  work on both.<br/>\nDon&#39;t get stuck at 27th like me and have pitiful 1H and bash.<br/>\nOf course for a large race you can slam with a 2H weapon, so<br/>\nI would probably stick to your 2H, but no reason not to keep<br/>\nboth maxed (except maybe intelligence =) since you can afford<br/>\na magic 1H before a magic 2H.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have to borrow a claw from a friend, find a shield, and <br/>\nget my skills up, hopefully without getting my nukers killed.<br/>\nThe best reason to keep 1H up for humans/DE&#39;s is so you can<br/>\nbash a caster, and when they are using greater heal, that one<br/>\nbash can mean alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
