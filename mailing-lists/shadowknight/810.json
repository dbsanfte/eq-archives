Heh, I would like to see the <br/>\ndamage on a backstab from a 25th level Troll or Ogre <br/>\ndecked out in strength boosting items and buffs.<br/>\nAnd if this is a class over balancing issue, then the <br/>\npurely racial XP penalties would make up for it. <br/>\nEspecially since most of the Rogue abilities are hosed <br/>\nanyway and poison didn&#39;t actually get implimented til <br/>\njust recently.<br/>\nAny word on this from your fellows at Verant?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happened to the Troll Shaman vendors in the Foriegn <br/>\nQuarter? This is not a big deal to me, but it is to <br/>\nseveral friends of mine.<br/>\nAlso, why can&#39;t I train at the Troll SK in Foriegn <br/>\nQuarter? Are all the Troll SKs walking around just for <br/>\nlooks?  Is it because the DE SKs would rather train <br/>\nthere instead of going in another 2 zones to train?  But <br/>\nthen again the race thing wouldn&#39;t let them anyway... :P<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone,<br/>\nEach city that I have been in has had a secret passage <br/>\nsomewhere. The exception to this seems to be Grobb <br/>\n(haven&#39;t been into Oggok except to be bound just inside) <br/>\nbut I may be wrong. Anyone know of a secret passage in <br/>\nGrobb?<br/>\nAlso, has anyone been  to the &quot;fire pot&quot; in 3rd Gate <br/>\nnear the stone bridge that is on the other side of the <br/>\nfletcher shop? <br/>\nWhen I click on it it says I do not have the key.  I <br/>\ntried the first and second keys from Befallen, but those <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work. Ideas?  I have yet to see a Rogue in Neriak <br/>\nto help me.
