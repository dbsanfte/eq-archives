Why is our Bind Wound capped at<br/>\n&gt;100? I didn&#39;t even thing about this till yesterday when a Monk friend of<br/>\n&gt;mine happen to use the skill on me. Healed me for over twice what I could<br/>\n&gt;have done. So I started asking around, hell a mage I group with has a <br/>\n&gt;higher<br/>\n&gt;bind skill then I do. Does anybody know what the other hybrids cap at? I<br/>\n&gt;would have thought that since the other hybrids get some type of heal they<br/>\n&gt;would cap lower and we would cap higher (200 would be nice).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway just a thought..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
