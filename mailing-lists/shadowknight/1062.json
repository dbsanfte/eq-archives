Rumored<br/>\nstats on sword 33Dmg 33Dly Effect: Combust (180dmg DD or so) Paladin Only.<br/>\nNow I don&#39;t mind that the Paladin&#39;s get a really nice weapon, what gets me<br/>\nis that they can obtain their nice weapons through Quest. I would much<br/>\nrather obtain a kick ass weapon from questing (not camping, but an actual<br/>\nquest) than having to kill a god (Soul Leech, what&#39;s with the 50pt lifetap<br/>\nthough???). Well I guess I&#39;ll just have to wait and see if the weapon really<br/>\ndoes exist.. And who knows maybe the SK&#39;s have some kick ass sword available<br/>\nby a quest (About the same odds as me winning the lottery without buying a<br/>\nticket).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy..<br/>\n<br/>\nThom</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
