Made me feel better.<br/>\nThe rest of the night totally bombed! I lagged horrible <br/>\n75% of the time I was on, was booted from my ISP 3 <br/>\ntimes, and played &quot;Dodge the Cyclops and Aviak Evocate&quot; <br/>\nwhile my screen froze up on me.<br/>\nThe trip to Splitpaw was actually uneventful thank Thule!<br/>\nI had screen freeze most of the way and it took me 10 <br/>\nminutes to get there from the Lake Rathe side. <br/>\nAfter guild stuff and all the frustration of just trying <br/>\nto cross zones I logged off as soon as I made it into <br/>\nSplitpaw. I was not lagged at all the moment I got there <br/>\nwhich made me feel better, but the way the night had <br/>\nalready gone, I logged off. Fate had been warning me all <br/>\nnight.<br/>\nHopefully I can get the Snakeskin Jerkin/Gloves/Mask(?) <br/>\nand a RTS for my Druid. I will be solo so it will be <br/>\nrough. Hopefully I can get a group started to help me.  <br/>\nLoot is good there anyway, so I will be dropping <br/>\nanything but armor (cloth or snakeskin) and FS/Bronze <br/>\nweapons if I can get any that is. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik Khaos &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
