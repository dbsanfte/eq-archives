If yer level 16-high 30&#39;s you will have<br/>\n&gt; something here to kill. A full group of 18+ can kill most anything if they<br/>\n&gt; have enough clerics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To get here you have to get to the freeport docks, Sail to yhe<br/>\nbutcherblock<br/>\n&gt; mtns, Jump off the boat before the bay, best thing to do is find the road,<br/>\n&gt; get an invis and hire a guide if u dont know the way.<br/>\n&gt; And of course you want a bind. You will have to get to greater faydark.<br/>\nThe<br/>\n&gt; home of the wood elves. You can get bound right at the zone. be careful of<br/>\n&gt; wondering guards irf you get curious in that zone.<br/>\n&gt; After you get bound, Go back to the butcherblocks and follow the left<br/>\nwall.<br/>\n&gt; You will avoid guards and get to Dagnor&#39;s cauldron. This is the zone that<br/>\n&gt; takes you to unrest.<br/>\n&gt; Now, Run along the coastline, the zone wall is very difficult and you will<br/>\n&gt; take lots of falling dmg. You will see a dimly blue lit tunnel about<br/>\nhalfway<br/>\n&gt; around. This is unrest.<br/>\n&gt; Unreast is  an estate with a large mansion, a big courtyard with a 14th<br/>\n&gt; century style hedge maze and, a few lil tricks.<br/>\n&gt;      At low and mid teen levels, i would reccomend going on the right side<br/>\n&gt; of the estate near the gazebo. You will find Death beetles, tormented<br/>\ndead,<br/>\n&gt; Jack o lanterns and  a few skeletons.<br/>\n&gt;     Later teens you will wnat to group and pull from the first level<br/>\nmansion<br/>\n&gt; and if you are in high teens and have a good FULL group, pull Carrion<br/>\n&gt; Ghouls, Dry bones and lurking Mummies.<br/>\n&gt;    The things to look out for are Skeletal moinks, barbed bones, Greater<br/>\n&gt; Dark Bones, Zombies of an unrest noble and MOST OF ALL, The festering hag.<br/>\n&gt; She is a 30some level spellcaster from what i have seen. I have killed her<br/>\n&gt; but only after she spends all her mana. at 20th level two spells from her<br/>\n&gt; can kill me.<br/>\n&gt;   This is a great placee for loot. Many things carry small ringmail, spell<br/>\n&gt; components, Platinum pieces and occasional bronze Platemail, vrey sought<br/>\n&gt; after on this island. But unfortunaltely fer the ogers and Trolls, Its<br/>\n&gt; small. Well i think i gave as much info as i can.  Good luck if ya come<br/>\n&gt; here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got 17-20th level in a week here and am skyrocketing up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
