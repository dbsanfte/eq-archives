Hot dam!<br/>\nI left Grobb and Innothule Swamp at 6th level and went <br/>\nto Neriak. Shortly after I got there, I went to the <br/>\ntroll armor merchant and bought a full set of leather <br/>\narmor.  <br/>\nAfter zoning to the forrest I still had my full set of <br/>\nnetted armor and a couple of woven items that I didn&#39;t <br/>\nsell.  I was in a really good mood so I ramdomly chose a <br/>\nDE necro and without a word gave her all the netted I <br/>\nhad.  She came back with a &quot;Why me? What do I owe you?&quot; <br/>\nI just said no reason, I know casters need all the help <br/>\nthey can get.  She thanked me profusely and said my <br/>\nkindness would someday be repaid.  I chuckled and said <br/>\nto help out others when able, and that would be enough. <br/>\nI left to stomp skele into powder and thought nothing of <br/>\nit.  I made 7th that night.<br/>\nThe next day when I got on I got a tell from the Necro <br/>\nabove asking to group. ? /who.  She made 6th from <br/>\n&lt;insert level here&gt;. Kewl. I said sure.  We then <br/>\nproceeded to stomp skele and young kody all over <br/>\nNecktulos(?) Forrest through 3/4 of my level 8 for <br/>\nSaturday and Sunday.  <br/>\nJust as I /shout &quot;Level 9! Hot dam!&quot; I get a tell from <br/>\nsomeone asking me to come to the EC side of the zone <br/>\nborder. Out of curiosity I went.  I had been saving many <br/>\nDE a$$ since I got there, so what the heck. <br/>\nAfter I zone, I get a hail and my trade window pops up. <br/>\n?   Then I see a FS2H sword and 8pp appear. I hit trade. <br/>\nI had been using a rusty Halberd for a while. This was <br/>\nawesome! I had been looking for a FS2H weapon all <br/>\nweekend, but they were going for 15-20pp which I did not <br/>\nhave after buying my armor :(.  The Highelf Wizard who <br/>\ngave me the stuff said the DE Necro I helped called in a <br/>\nfavor to him and to use my new weapon wisely.  <br/>\nTwo hours later I get a message from the female <br/>\nnecro.  &quot;Someone come visit you?&quot;  Yes.  &quot;Good. I hope <br/>\nthey treated you well.&quot;  Hell yes they did!  <br/>\n<br/>\nNew Thread<br/>\nI was in Neriak when I hit 9th, and the DE guild would <br/>\nnot train me cause I play a troll. grrr.  I went back to <br/>\nGrobb and trained my magic abilities and my 1H Slash to <br/>\nkeep it up a bit.  Then I bought all the 1st Rank <br/>\nspells. All righty then! kewl.  I zone to the swamp and <br/>\ncast my first pet. NOT!!!! <br/>\n&quot;Insufficiant mana to cast this spell.&quot; WTF!!! Try <br/>\nagain. Same thing. Mana cost: 40.  Hmmm.  Dam.  No big <br/>\ndeal really. Me not use one before. Is ok. <br/>\nNext spell.  <br/>\nInvis to Undead. &quot;Insufficiant mana to cast this spell.&quot; <br/>\nCrap! Mana cost: 40. <br/>\nGreat. The spell that makes a SK visible as a SK (pet) I <br/>\nam too stupid (Int of 62) to cast!  And the spell that <br/>\nwill keep annoying green skele from attacking me I can&#39;t <br/>\ncast either.  <br/>\nUsing a mana calculator from the net I found out I have <br/>\na 14 mana pool. Increasing Int by 2 points I think was a <br/>\nwaste of points.   Why? Using a mana calculator this is <br/>\nwhat I found out.<br/>\nLevel   Int:60 Int:70 Int:80<br/>\n9       14     16     18<br/>\n10      28     32     36<br/>\n11      42     48     54<br/>\n16      112    128    144<br/>\n22      196    224    252<br/>\n24      224    256    288<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get 1 point more base mana for every 5 points you <br/>\nincrease Int by.  Each level you add the base mana to <br/>\nyour curret total.  So, my advice to you all is not to <br/>\nbuy Int only items.  Get Int (+5 minimum if you didn&#39;t <br/>\nincrease int at the start) AND mana increasing items. <br/>\nJaded Electrum Bracers: Mana +10, HP +10 and AC +2 each <br/>\nbracer.  Keep them on you but not equiped when battling <br/>\nas you need the AC more. Equip them only when casting.  <br/>\nUnless the AC reduction doesn&#39;t bother you.  :)<br/>\nI do not know what other types of items are out there <br/>\nthat can help mana pool and not lose AC.<br/>\nAnyone on this list that does please let me know. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik <br/>\nServant of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n9th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
