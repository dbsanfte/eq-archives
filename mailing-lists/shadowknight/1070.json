A druid and a level 50 warrior were tracking<br/>\n&gt;down and killing all of the crusaders in cazic today so that they could<br/>\n&gt;do the quests, and then try to find a way to trade the nodrop armor<br/>\n&gt;to a low level twink.  She was not only doing this, but competing<br/>\n&gt;with me in /auction for looting pieces.  Earlier, I gave the rogue<br/>\n&gt;in my group the ravenscale legs without even doing a random, and she<br/>\n&gt;wasn&#39;t even someone I knew.  Both Verant and the players on my<br/>\n&gt;server have made it more of a chore to play than fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So good luck everyone finding your armor, hope you live on a more<br/>\n&gt;civil server than Tunare.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Xilith, signing off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
