This guy also wanders <br/>\naround that part of the zone. If I remember correctly <br/>\nthat is.  I was part of a Paladin Holy Sword mailing <br/>\nlist and it involved going to find someone in WC to give <br/>\nthem a note.  They in turn gave you a note to return to <br/>\nsomeone else.  I think this also involved turning around <br/>\nvery quickly and following someone that spawned behind <br/>\nyou, and killing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe paladin half came down to:<br/>\nGetting a note from the Marr Temple, giving it to the <br/>\nShield Merchant in WC to warn him about something, <br/>\ngetting a note to return to someone else, killing the <br/>\nabove NPC that spawns, taking his head or another <br/>\nsomething from him back to the Temple.<br/>\nThis is quick and dirty, and may also have changed <br/>\nsomewhat.  To find out for sure, go to the Paladin list <br/>\narchives on Onelist for <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Holyswords@onelist.com\">Holyswords@onelist.com</a> (may want <br/>\nto search for that as the name of the list is fuzzy) and <br/>\nscan through it.  It may take a bit, but it is worth a <br/>\ntry if you really, really, really want answers. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps you out.  It has been a while since I <br/>\nactually did anything Paladin related so things may have <br/>\nchanged.
