Anything that allows me to strike<br/>\neven one more time each minute is worth it. Especially with Double Attack.<br/>\nBut that is symantics and I do not want a &quot;word war&quot; over it. :-)<br/>\nI agree that raw AC comes first. Strength has more impact after 20. Agility<br/>\nis up in the air for me. Not quite sure what effect it has.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat armor under Darkforge and Planes armor is best for an SK? I am working<br/>\non getting some bronze armor, and not blackened because of the lower AC.<br/>\nWhat is better than bronze and what would I expect to pay for it? Or what<br/>\nMoB/level/zone is it in.<br/>\nI am ignorant as to &quot;good&quot; items as I normally wander Norrath with my /ooc,<br/>\n/auction, /shouts turned off. It is quite peaceful like this, no punk<br/>\nkiddies acting tough and cursing each other out across the zone. But I<br/>\ndigress.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy druid just hit 26 and I am looking into getting equipment for my SK. All<br/>\nI need is to be pointed in the right direction.
