I have not recd a digest since the 10th of Dec. and was wondering what&#39;s up?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone out there is getting this, what is a GOOD area for a 20th lvl DE SK to go and hunt?  I have been hunting in HPH and getting good xps, but wondering where to go next.  Also, has anyone *ever* gotten to the point where they were not KOS to the HP guards?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an additional aside, I was wondering what the general consensus was on costs for the following items:  Silvery-plated Bracer, Blackened Iron Armor (any piece or general guideline, like 5plat per AC or what?), BIBS, and Dark Reaver?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anyone out there?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
