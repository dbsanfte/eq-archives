EQ has been extremely well balanced from what<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen and half the fun for me is taking a game that&#39;s designed a<br/>\ncertain way and finding my own ways of dealing with whatever hardships<br/>\nI&#39;m presented with.  I feel like trying to ask the dev team at this point<br/>\nto make the game easier for me is pretty weak.  That was the point of the<br/>\nbeta.  Part of the reason I bought the game was because it seemed like a<br/>\nchallenge during the beta and a game that is challenging is much more<br/>\ninteresting than one that is easily mastered.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also heard a story about people complaining about the Sand Giants at the<br/>\nOasis saying they were interfering with their play.  My feeling about that<br/>\nissue is: duh!  thats what they&#39;re there for.  I felt like those people<br/>\nwere whining too much.  And while the issue of balance is a better issue<br/>\nto discuss than how to blatantly make the game easier, I still feel that<br/>\nit&#39;s slightly whiny to complain about a character that is intentionally<br/>\nmore difficult at the lower levels.  Let&#39;s face it, at the highest levels,<br/>\nwe&#39;re going to be the most powerful players in the game.  Wizards will be<br/>\nable to do more quick damage, but in a long run fight, SKs are the only<br/>\nones that can dish it out AND take it.  And if there&#39;s any such thing as a<br/>\nsoloable character at high levels (which I doubt), SKs are going to be the<br/>\nclosest thing to it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my perspective is to leave the HT alone and rise to the challenges that<br/>\nthe designers gave us.  After all, we did choose our characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nOogog<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************************************************<br/>\nAlways remember to pillage BEFORE you burn.<br/>\n************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 26 Apr 1999, Countess Bathory wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Countess Bathory &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I fully admit, and am glad for it, that SKs will indeed be a class to<br/>\n&gt; be reckoned with. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However i must stick with my previous comments on HT. Sure if a few SKs<br/>\n&gt; got together and HT&#39;d a Griffon to death quick and easy, they would get<br/>\n&gt; good exp. But that would be it for another hour and a half. If thats<br/>\n&gt; what they want to do with their HT instead of keeping it for an<br/>\n&gt; emergency where HT is the only thing that&#39;ll save them, thats up to the<br/>\n&gt; individuals involved. Its not like they&#39;ll be able to walk around and<br/>\n&gt; HT everything to death right after that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And as for LoH getting interrupted, i have heard this about HT,<br/>\n&gt; although its never happened to me. <br/>\n&gt; I would like to hear from any SK on this.<br/>\n&gt; If this is true, then we&#39;re back to square one. LoH 1000 healing, HT<br/>\n&gt; 500dmg, but resisted by the creatures you would actually use it<br/>\n&gt; against.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And we all know that a toning down of LoH just isn&#39;t going to happen.<br/>\n&gt; We could campaign the rest of our lives and it&#39;ll never even be<br/>\n&gt; considered. <br/>\n&gt; So what&#39;s left? <br/>\n&gt; Tweak HT. <br/>\n&gt; HT is only powerful WHEN it works. Which seems to be less and less as<br/>\n&gt; we gain higher levels and fight bigger creatures.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And i still feel that it should work every time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But aside from our differences of opinion, i would like to hear what<br/>\n&gt; you think would be a good way to get the Dev team&#39;s attention with our<br/>\n&gt; various concerns.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Talking about these topics on message boards and mailing lists is OK,<br/>\n&gt; but this wont accomplish anything as far as the game is concerned.<br/>\n&gt; Lets do that pro-active thing i hear so much about.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for responding,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bathory<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; i completely agree, i would personally like to sit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down with the game<br/>\n&gt; &gt; balance programmers and get THEIR explainations of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how paladins and SK are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; evenly matched. however, i think i can understand a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; few possible reasons why<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things are as they are:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ok, so at lvl 9 a paladin could probably beat up a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lvl 9 sk good, on account<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the paladin has 3 times normal hp (due to all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; healing), whereas we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get a spell that bites him for 5 damage and suck<br/>\n&gt; &gt; away some of his str. but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eventually i think we accelerate in power faster<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than paladins.. by the time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we get to lvl 50 in our best equipment, we would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fully capable of beating<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the snot out of a lvl 50 paladin in his best<br/>\n&gt; &gt; equipment. (also, we dont have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to kill the lava dragon for a darkreaver ;)) upon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; checking back to the guild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; periodically i have seen a great many necro spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being imped for SK use at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high level, including some of the powerful DOT<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells, spirit armor, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expulse undead.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; also, while i admit that HT vs lay on hands isnt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very fair, remember that HT<br/>\n&gt; &gt; IS rather powerful. most melee combat classes cant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boast the ability to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; knock off a third or a half of their target&#39;s life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a single attack and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still be able to go ahead and wail away with nasty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; implements of pointy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; death. my suggestion is not to boost HT, but to TONE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; DOWN lay on hands. the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ability to heal that much is just not reasonable;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; altho i have heard of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people having lay on hands interrupted, while it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not possible to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interrupt HT that i have seen, it being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instantaneous. can anyone confirm<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the possibility of lay on hands to be interrupted?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; there is a very good reason why HT can be resisted:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; imagine about 20 lvl 10<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sk all charge a griffin and simultaneously lay a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; harm touch on it, causing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it to die instantly. now somebody is going to get a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; crapload of xp out of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that, and it&#39;d be a hideously unfair trick for us.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; even more lame than the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; little bard accelerando-run in circles-bellow thing!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i admit i become quite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; annoyed seeing HT resisted or soaked altogether, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i try very hard not to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fight things that are guaranteed to resist it when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it can be helped anyway :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; now, if only they will figure out why we and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; paladins cant hit worth a damn,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i think both classes are fully toe to toe with most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other classes for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better part of the game. i still think it&#39;d be a bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; idea to duel a lvl 50<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wizard with an SK, but the again, who COULD? :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Beld Demonblade &lt;- just named! :D<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community<br/>\n&gt; &gt; service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the Week!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
