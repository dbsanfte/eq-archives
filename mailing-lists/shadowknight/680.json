I think i was getting smacked<br/>\naround by something :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway: heres the Bathory history to date.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently level 33. A very looong 33. This is my first<br/>\nand only character. I just dont do lots of XP camping.<br/>\nI take many breaks from that and try quests and a<br/>\nlittle adventuring. Which always equals little to no<br/>\nXP. But is more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am realatively untwinked. The only things i got that<br/>\ni didnt go get is some bronze armor. Which i didnt get<br/>\nuntil early 20s, which is the appropriate level for<br/>\nthat type of armor anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon history:<br/>\nFor the first 8 levels or so, i used either a rusty<br/>\nbattle axe or rusty 2H sword, that i got off of a<br/>\ndecaying skelton.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen i bought my mino axe. A mino for 8Pp at that time<br/>\nwas a deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used this until level 19 with a shiny brass shield.<br/>\nDuring my Befallen days i was switching off using a<br/>\nTeticle whip which i got for 15Pp for those magic only<br/>\nMOBs. During this time i tried for the BBC. Killed the<br/>\nTroll SK, but just wasnt lucky enough to get one.<br/>\nBut a guildmate was able to aquire one from that<br/>\nstingy troll and gave it to me. (I dont consider that<br/>\ntwinking since i killed him, i just wasnt lucky).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now at 19 i have a BBC. Minus 8 AGI you say? Thats<br/>\nwhere having a friend who does jeweling come in. Just<br/>\nboosted the AGI back up with rings and such and i was<br/>\ngood to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nStayed with the BBC until about level 30. Then i went<br/>\ninto runny eye to get my BIBS. Realistically i could<br/>\nhave gone in there at around level 25. But i had a<br/>\nheck of a time getting a group i could trust to go in<br/>\nthere and help me with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thats where i stand now. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 20 i was offered a DR as a gift. I turned it<br/>\ndown becasue that was one of the items i wanted to go<br/>\nget myself. But, now that i know you have to be 40ish<br/>\nto even have a shot at getting it, and on top of that,<br/>\nits only a damage 20 weapon, it doesnt seem worth the<br/>\nwait. The DR is good for level 30 to 40 i would say.<br/>\nBy the time i can go get it, it will be obsolete. So i<br/>\nhave a feeling i will be a DR twink soon :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other nice swords to consider, but havent<br/>\nhad a chance to get yet<br/>\n<br/>\nFleshripper: Nice weapon. But has a potentially<br/>\ndangerous area effect spell to it. So you wont want to<br/>\nuse it all the time. Now that i have a Box of Aku Bar<br/>\nthough (pulled it off a specter myself) carry extra<br/>\nweapons is no longer an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nMithril 2H. Sweet weapon. But its in Sol B somewhere<br/>\n(i Think). No group i can assemble would last in there<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, thats it for my weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have too much quest stuff to talk about so will just<br/>\ndo a different post.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
