Even before","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-739694151\">Now im not sure what level your SK, but after 40<br/>\nlevels, i am willing to stretch my neck out and say<br/>\nthat i have no problem with what they did.<br/>\nEven before they gave us the tap series, it was pretty<br/>\nmuch predicted that they werent going to be a huge<br/>\nfactor in our arsenal. But rather a nice little side<br/>\naddition. Keep in mind what they replaced.<br/>\nthe life taps arent meant to fill you up with only a<br/>\nfew castings. At level 40, 89 INT (im a human after<br/>\nall) it takes a full bub of mana to cast lifedraw.So i<br/>\ncan cast it 5 times.<br/>\nThats 225 HP i dont have to sit on my butt and wait<br/>\nfor. Mana comes back a heck of a lot quicker than HP<br/>\nthats for sure.<br/>\nIts either that or you can sit around and talk thru<br/>\nyour pet while you wait for those 225 to regen.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour point on HT is still an issue that we should<br/>\nindeed fight for.<br/>\nEspecially since they added in the 2/3 DMG with PvP.<br/>\nSo not only was our HT very resistable to begin with,<br/>\nnow they chopped it down even more.<br/>\nSo instead of doing 401, at best, i can do only 266,<br/>\nand thats if its not resisted at all.<br/>\nI am still a strong supported to have a Tap feature<br/>\nadded to the HT.<br/>\nNow fighting any form of healer (esp Pallies) with our<br/>\nweakened &quot;special ability&quot; has been made even more<br/>\ndifficult. Does that mean we will lose all the time?<br/>\nof course not. But still we have our already shaky HT<br/>\nmade even weaker. Weakening an already weak<br/>\n&quot;attribute&quot; doesnt sound like balancing to me.<br/>\nSo instead of making it unresistable, instead of<br/>\nboosting the DMG, just add a Tap.<br/>\nSo when it does that awesome 14DMG, you can at least<br/>\nheal up that same 14.<br/>\nexample:<br/>\n40 SK vs 40 Pal, equal equipment , all that stuff<br/>\nSK-HT=266<br/>\nPal-LoH=801<br/>\n266=801 ?  ummm..dont think so. But then again i am a<br/>\nproduct of the public school system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd the Tap feature:<br/>\nSK-HT=266, 266 tapped= 532<br/>\nPal-LoH=801<br/>\n532=801 ? Still nope..but its a hell of alot better<br/>\nthan the first example.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...thats my opinion of course<br/>\n<br/>\nStab a Light Bringer in the eye<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- r cuming &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rcuming@...\">rcuming@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is intentional to balance the power of the<br/>\n&gt; spells.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Brian<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First off, the spells are not all that powerful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For a necromancer at the levels he/she gets the<br/>\n&gt; spells yes they can be<br/>\n&gt; powerful for that class. They dont have much health<br/>\n&gt; to start with.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for when shadow knights get these spells, we are<br/>\n&gt; looking at a Troll Sk<br/>\n&gt; with almost 300 hitpoints (or more) at lvl 9 so the<br/>\n&gt; little life tap isnt<br/>\n&gt; going to effect him much. As he / she gets each<br/>\n&gt; additional spell at their<br/>\n&gt; corisponding levels it can help out in getting you<br/>\n&gt; that last hit in but<br/>\n&gt; thats about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For the so called &quot;power&quot; of the spells the mana<br/>\n&gt; requirement is going to<br/>\n&gt; keep them in the back of the book. I thoght the pets<br/>\n&gt; could be useless I now<br/>\n&gt; see the life taps are.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If your going to &quot;improve&quot; our class like this<br/>\n&gt; atleast give us one more<br/>\n&gt; thing, dont let Harm Touch be resisted. Its a power<br/>\n&gt; from the gods after all,<br/>\n&gt; I dont care how powerful you are unless your a god<br/>\n&gt; you shouldnt be able to<br/>\n&gt; resist this power.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And if you really want to help this less used class,<br/>\n&gt; make some shadow knight<br/>\n&gt; only spells. A paladin can use clerical spells<br/>\n&gt; pretty well because a Paladin<br/>\n&gt; is only a Cleric with a sword, now a Shadow Knights<br/>\n&gt; spells are from a PURE<br/>\n&gt; CASTER class wich is kind of odd that we use their<br/>\n&gt; spells way after they<br/>\n&gt; stop useing them their selves. A little more work is<br/>\n&gt; needed with the SK<br/>\n&gt; Class to truly balance them out, your paying<br/>\n&gt; customers are speeking out so<br/>\n&gt; you should listen (I see more complaints about SKs<br/>\n&gt; then any other class).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Uglugg<br/>\n&gt; Troll SK<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
