It wouldn&#39;t really unbalance the Necro side<br/>\nsince they don&#39;t engage in melee that often (at least they shouldn&#39;t be). <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way as an interesting side note, SK&#39;s rock in PVP at the later<br/>\nlevels. I beat a lvl 40 monk last night in a duel (Lvl 35 SK). I actually<br/>\nended up kind of kiting him. We were in Freeport Arena so it was hard to do,<br/>\nbut I kept hitting him with Eng. Darkness and Heat Blood while I used Shadow<br/>\nStep repeatedly. Oh and I finished him off with HT before he could mend.<br/>\n(Engulfing Darkness is a great counter to someone using J. Boots BTW)..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Chip Paul [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 20, 1999 9:08 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [shadowknight] Vampiric embrace or lifetap?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Chip Paul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPrincess Xaera wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Princess Xaera&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xaera@...\">xaera@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just as a quick note, the Necro and SK VE are the same spell but do<br/>\n </span></blockquote>totally<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; different damage.  The question is: Why?  It should work the same for both<br/>\n&gt; classes.  I don&#39;t see a Rangers heal do less then half of a druids.  Or a<br/>\n&gt; paladians heal do half of a clerics for the same spell.  If the spell is<br/>\n&gt; going to act differently should have a different name.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would guess teh damage is based on our level being 8 levels lower<br/>\nthan the necro using it.  Rememeber, since we got spells at 9th, our<br/>\neffective level in casting (and for mana) is 8 levels lower.  My VE<br/>\nis getting better at about 1HP / 2 levels I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
