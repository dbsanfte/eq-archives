That little<br/>\nnotice you get on character creation screen isn&#39;t for<br/>\nnothing.  I used to spend a very long time zoning as<br/>\nwell and I upped my RAM from 32 to 96 mb.  It&#39;s much<br/>\nbetter now, although I&#39;ve already gotten used to the<br/>\nspeed increase and have to remind myself how much<br/>\nslower it used to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI like hunting in souther ro.

That has<br/>\n&gt; been bugging me for quite a bit.  I hate having to<br/>\n&gt; zone to sell.  The major<br/>\n&gt; factor here is that it takes me 2-2.5 minutes to<br/>\n&gt; zone one way.  If it only<br/>\n&gt; took me 30 seconds like it does my wife, I may not<br/>\n&gt; have thought it a big<br/>\n&gt; deal.  It may be an oversight by Verant, but I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think it is a &quot;fair&quot;<br/>\n&gt; way of doing things.
