These guys have a song that greatly increases DEX and STR,  making them great melee characters.  I think my level 5 guy is about at the level my level 7 sk was.  If you think the classes are balanced try verifying this by playing other classes.  Sure the sk may have potential at higher levels, but it will take longer to get there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would want is to get a lifetap like spell (for healing), and a rapid movement type spell (for running away from kos npc&#39;s) at about level 15 if not sooner.  I know we get these eventually, but at the level we do they won&#39;t be quite as necessary.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
