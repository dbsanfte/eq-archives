For me, the choice is clear -- damage<br/>\n&gt; shields all the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Completely agreed. Problem is, Brian just said a few emails ago that it made<br/>\nus too powerful. I would gladly give up my pet for a damage shield, however,<br/>\nand I&#39;m not sure that this would really make us overpowerful. What it would<br/>\nmean is that we could use our spell in place we could never have used our<br/>\npet previously because of drawing puny creatures to fight, etc. I rarely use<br/>\nmy pet anymore except when soloing, so what is the point of it? (other than<br/>\nto serve as a reason to have voice graft! :D). Damage shields would be<br/>\nsomething effective for a GROUP situation and something that can actually be<br/>\nused. What about a line of damage shields ... maybe every other level, and<br/>\nthen the pet spells on other levels replaced with ... something. Still<br/>\nthinking on this one, but damage shields definitely would seem to be the way<br/>\nto go if they could be implemented without overbalancing us. (Heck, I<br/>\n*guess* I would agree to this even knowing my voice graft would be taken<br/>\naway!) And this does fit in character with a SK, I think, almost as well as<br/>\nlifetaps. Having people take damage just from hitting us ... sounds like<br/>\nsomething I could easily imagine happening with a Shadowknight.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and as a sidenote ... I rarely rarely experience damage shields since<br/>\nmost other damage shield having classing are by default &quot;good&quot; races or<br/>\nclasses and I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going to fight with a druid. My magician<br/>\nfriend casts it on me at times, but that is rare because we don&#39;t group too<br/>\nmuch anymore (surprise, he&#39;s pulling ahead of me in levels).<br/>\n<br/>\nvirten</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
