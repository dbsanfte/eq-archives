It is a major<br/>\nupgrade that lasts much longer and does more dmg. It does cost mroe mana<br/>\nthough so you may want to keep both memed until about lvl 24 or so. That way<br/>\nyou have that emergancy runner stopper.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvice to people reaching lvl 22. You&#39;re Evoke skill will be next to nothing<br/>\nhaving not had a spell to do. Cast a pet and then cast Ward undead on it to<br/>\nget yuor skill up. It took me about 3 hours, but is well worth it if you<br/>\nplan to hunt undead. Also, cast Endure Cold since this will keep your<br/>\nabjeration skill up I think. I found to my horror that it is still on 55 for<br/>\nme at lvl 27! What a slacker! 8)<br/>\n<br/>\n1H vs 2H - this argument will go on until the end of time. My thought? Use<br/>\nboth! Carry both types of weapon around and keep them maxed out. This will<br/>\nprepare you for all situations and also help you to find which you prefer<br/>\nusing. Which is better is almost totally weapon based. 2H is generally<br/>\nbetter then 1H, but I would preffer a PGT to a FS 2H any day!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for HT, I too used to keep it for an emergancy, butfrmo about lvl 24<br/>\nonwards it isn&#39;t all that great so I try to comromise and use it as often as<br/>\npossible while looking for the best time to use, multiple opponents etc. At<br/>\nlvl 27 , 271 dmg just isn&#39;t all that great. the max dmg I&#39;ve done in a round<br/>\nis 102 ( double attack 40, 48 and a Vamp for 14) so it only takes a few<br/>\nrounds to make tht sort of dmg. before lvl 24 though it is often a<br/>\nlifesaver! 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get a chance to party with a rogue do it! Between your ability to<br/>\nattract monsters and their backstab you&#39;ll do well. I partied with a lvl 27<br/>\nrogue when 24 and the mob never even looked at her despite backstabb for<br/>\n60&#39;s +<br/>\n<br/>\nAt lvl 20 or so when you start to get more financially well, build you&#39;re<br/>\nbind wound skill. I have found this to be invaluable. I&#39;ve maxed it at 100<br/>\nwhich is as high as it goes. It heals about 25 or 30 HP per bandage at that<br/>\nskill which is quite nice to cut down on down time. It is good even when<br/>\nwith a healer since it saves them mana and I&#39;m sure everyone&#39;s had a battle<br/>\nwhere their whole party is under 1 bub and no one has mana and someone yells<br/>\nTrain! 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat should just about do it for the moment. If anyone has any questions<br/>\ndon;t hesitate to ask! we&#39;re all here to help! 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nInos<br/>\nlvl 27 Veeshan.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
