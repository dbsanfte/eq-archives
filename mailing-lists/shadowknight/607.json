Unless you have friends, why would you want to <br/>\nhunt in Nektulous instead of Innothule swamp? <br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nI migrated simply because I wanted to group with my wife <br/>\nwhen she created her Dark Elf Necro.  I got bound inside <br/>\nNeriak, and then she didn&#39;t like her necro and went back <br/>\nto her Woodelf Bard.  I was 6th when I migrated and <br/>\nnearly died in the process in a nasty spot in Oasis. <br/>\nSomeone with an unmeasureable IQ was training Spectres <br/>\nall over the zone hoping someone would save them and <br/>\nkilling alot of people in the process. So I decided to <br/>\nstick around Neriak until I felt comfortable that even <br/>\nif attacked in Oasis that I could make the zone.<br/>\nI liked the Innuthule Swamp and am heading back there <br/>\nfor that reason.  I want to go to Faydwer because of the <br/>\nloot possibilities that I have seen with my own eyes. <br/>\nThe minos in Steamfont looks like a fun place.  Guk <br/>\nlooks promising, but I may lag too bad to make it worth <br/>\nmy while. We shall see. I am making a run tonight back <br/>\nto the swamp so I can train.<br/>\nI am interested in OOT because of the Grobb Cleaver <br/>\nQuest, but do not want to get into OOT and find out that <br/>\nthe Troll I need to kill is level 25 and I&#39;m only 10th.<br/>\nI also plan on completing the Mushroom Head quest for <br/>\nthe Froglock skin mask.  Any clue what level that MOB is?<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik <br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n9th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
