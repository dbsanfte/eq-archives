If it&#39;s similar it<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be that hard. The only part I see people having problems with is<br/>\ngetting the pieces off of the HG&#39;s, SG&#39;s or Griffins.. Hopefully the SK<br/>\nquest will be similar.. Still wondering if it will be better than Mithril<br/>\nthough, oh well guess I&#39;ll find out soon enough..<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another subject anybody else besides me seem to be carrying a lot of<br/>\nweapons around lately? Just realized last night that I have 3 different<br/>\nweapons on me at any given time...(Thank god for EE sacks..)..<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Chip Paul [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 12, 1999 10:57 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] SK Quest armor (Questions and spoiler/rumors)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Chip Paul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone on the list play on the Test Server?  I&#39;ve heard that the<br/>\nnew quest armor was broken on Test, but I assume will be fixed before<br/>\ntomorrow.  If anyone can post logs of talking to the quest giver I&#39;d<br/>\nlove to hear it.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quest is given by a Greater Skeleton in the Graveyard of Mistmoore.<br/>\nIt requires pieces of Decayed Armor found off Lizard Crusaders in<br/>\nCazic Thule.  I don&#39;t yet know what else is required, but I assume <br/>\nthat there is either more items or monetary components (metals or<br/>\ngems) involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not seen stats or screenshots of how it looks.  I can&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve they made the rogue armor look like plate.  It could have <br/>\nthe exact same stats, but I think black leather would have been<br/>\nmore fitting.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
