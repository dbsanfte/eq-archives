Please not has been least 6 months since ive been, there, and<br/>\narmor drops may have changed.  But, Dry bones are anywhere in the house, and<br/>\nthey used to drop small bronze...<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously I have srtuck a nerve.... my appologies.<br/>\nI may not have been entirely clear with why I am being so inquisitive about<br/>\narmor and such. Lasombra is 1st level and sitting on a log in Nektulos<br/>\nForrest. He has not been to the guild trainer, nor has he attacked anything<br/>\nyet. He has turned in his guild note though. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current primary character (26th level Druid) is going to twink Lasombra<br/>\nwith what I can find. Since I had (until you were kind enough to help me) no<br/>\nclue where to find small bronze armor, I continued to narrow the location<br/>\nfrom &quot;Unrest&quot; to a smaller area. Like &quot;the main floor back door entry has 4<br/>\nmobs that should have it&quot;.  Since it appears that Drybone skeletons are the<br/>\nprimary MoBs that have Small Bronze, I will be checking out 3 places as my<br/>\nDruid; Lake Rathetear, Befallen and Unrest. If this assumption is wrong, let<br/>\nme know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to waste time wandering Norrath auctioning for small bronze, or<br/>\nattacking the wrong MoBs looking for it, as I want Lasombra to become my<br/>\nPrimary character as fast as I can. Now I have specific locations to go and<br/>\nauction and/or hunt for it.  That was my goal, it has been achieved. Thank<br/>\nyou for your patience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan on being very vocal and asking alot of questions. I want my SK to do<br/>\nwell, and this is the best place to get the advise I am seeking. Future<br/>\ntopics include: weapons, tactics, faction, and quests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was my TSK, Xilth(sp?) and Beld were my source of knowledge, and I am<br/>\nhappy to see Beld out of his 30s and almost 50 (lets you know how long ago<br/>\nthat was. heh.). Congrats to you, you deserve it. Countess Bathory still<br/>\nhere as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nLook for many more exciting emails from my corner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nLasombra<br/>\n1st Tier of Hate<br/>\nBertoxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
