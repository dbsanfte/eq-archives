(this<br/>\nwould likely cause a major rampage and flood said area with a hideous number<br/>\nof people camping for it). personally i only found it through luck (if you<br/>\ncan call being killed by its wielder luck :)) and when we came back to get<br/>\nrevenge.. well, we were greatly surprised. <br/>\n<br/>\nthe stats on this thing are 1hs, 6 damage, 26 delay, magical attack, and<br/>\ncasts &#39;berserker strength&#39; randomly during a fight. it also weighs 6.5<br/>\npounds, and can be used by pretty much any of the melee combat-oriented<br/>\nclasses. the berserker strength is defined as follows: it adds 19 str,<br/>\nsubtracts 10 agi, and while you are affected you are INVULNERABLE to melee<br/>\ndamage. i am not kidding, you actually become partially invincible while<br/>\nthis is in effect! the downside is that this effect is cast randomly during<br/>\ncombat (you may be affected 5 times in one fight or not at all), and the<br/>\neffect is very shortlived and chaotic.. i&#39;ve seen it last almost 2 minutes<br/>\none time, and fade almost instantaneously another. even with that drawback<br/>\ntho, imagine a warrior dual wielding a pair of these and sinking into<br/>\nberserk fury range.. you can almost see the blood fly. just imagine a<br/>\nmagical dwarven battle axe that casts divine aura and a strengthen on<br/>\nsteroids, and you get the picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nnow, while i really cant tell you the exact location, i WILL say that this<br/>\nweapon is always wielded by a gnoll named Grenix Mucktail.  for<br/>\nwell-traveled shadow knights this should be ample information for you to<br/>\nbegin your hunt, but others may have to explore a bit before they figure out<br/>\nwhere he may be located ;) good hunting, and may all who stand in your path<br/>\nfeel the rage of Innoruuk!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeld</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
