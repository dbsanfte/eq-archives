Many<br/>\ndungeons are bugged, cant even walk into sola, get back down the stairs in<br/>\nunrest, etc. This change hurts the large races bad, and came way too late,<br/>\natfer everyone and the brother done got it. Now large races are dependent on<br/>\nshamans to enter the dungeons. Sucks to depend on 1 class. Maybe they will<br/>\nthrow out a shrink type item, course prob require getting a rare pop off a<br/>\ndragon or something. I also feel like all the real cool items are gone.<br/>\nManastones, guise, jboots, etc. On the older servers so many people already<br/>\nhave these, and the ogrew that got there late will have to stand and shout<br/>\nwill pay for shrink at the dungeon entrance, while other people just click<br/>\non there mask. I am sure you smaller race shadowknights like the change<br/>\nthough.... Dont see why they waited 9 months to do it....<br/>\n<br/>\nMorg<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wilson, ThomasX B&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thomasx.b.wilson@...\">thomasx.b.wilson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 09, 1999 11:53 AM<br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] About time<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Wilson, ThomasX B&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thomasx.b.wilson@...\">thomasx.b.wilson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Non Dark Elfs probably won&#39;t like this as much, but it looks as though the<br/>\n&gt; Guise is no longer dropping.
