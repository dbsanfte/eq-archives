My wife joined a &quot;good race only&quot;<br/>\nguild and I am now unable to join with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make up for this, I went to Neriak and started<br/>\nkilling things. Heh.<br/>\nI was on the hunt for Bone Chips so that I could stock<br/>\nup for my pet spells. Regular Skellies are now blue and<br/>\nocasionally black.  While there I saved the life of a DE<br/>\nNecro.  I ended up giving this Necro 14 bone chips, and<br/>\nan almost complete set of Netted (after I bought a<br/>\ncomplete set of leather, minus gloves and cap). I felt<br/>\ncontent to help out another player, especially since I<br/>\nknow how much spells cost and how weak magic using<br/>\npeople are at low level.<br/>\n&gt;From an RP perspective this was not against my class.<br/>\nWhy? I helped out an evil race necro.  In doing so I<br/>\nhave invested power in the war vs. the goodies.  It also<br/>\nputs that Necro in my debt. Which she says she is and to<br/>\nask her for help anytime I need it. heh! That will come<br/>\nin handy at later levels. ;)  Score one for Thule!<br/>\nNow ack to the original statement and an inquirey.<br/>\nDoes anyone on this list know of a guild on Bertoxxulous<br/>\nthat accepts evil characters and is looking for<br/>\nmembers?  The guild itself need not be evil, but that<br/>\nwould be ok too.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik<br/>\nServant of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n6th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick. Smash&#39;m and they<br/>\nblood same color a Froglok.  Me smash&#39;m Greenblood<br/>\nfor Thule. Thule make Cronik big feared.
