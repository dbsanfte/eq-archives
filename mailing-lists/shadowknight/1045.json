Example.<br/>\n<br/>\nIvy etched tunic (ranger):  19AC +3Str +3Wis +30HP<br/>\nDarkforge breastplate (sk):  18AC +10Sta +3Mr<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know exactly how stamina works, but I know that the +6 stamina<br/>\non my charred bp equates to about 13HP for me at level 33.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe leggings...<br/>\nLambent greaves (bard):  13AC +1Cha +5Agi weight 4.0<br/>\nDarkforge greaves(sk):  11AC +9Sta +3Mr weight 7<br/>\nIvy Etched greaves(rng): 12AC +5Agi +5Fire +5Cold<br/>\n<br/>\nBard:  2 AC more and weighs 3lbs less.  Also, the Agi bonus will give <br/>\nanother point or two of ac.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger:  1 more AC<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear they are upping the crusader spawns, which is good, but <br/>\nreally why do the rangers have higher ac on their chain armor? It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
