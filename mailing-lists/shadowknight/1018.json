A friend<br/>\nhas a Bracer.<br/>\nOut of maybe 5 or 6 kills, those are the ony 2.<br/>\nAnother friend has killed about the same number and<br/>\ngot none.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs mentioned before this is worse than camping rubi.<br/>\nNot only do they seem to be slow spawns, but the<br/>\ndecayed stuff is a semi-rare drop. AND you need<br/>\nmultiple pieces for each piece of SK armor. So since<br/>\nall the drops are random, you may never see the second<br/>\npart to the one you already have. And since they are<br/>\nNO DROP, you cant trade with your friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i am trying is offering cash for the location of<br/>\nany crusader or for the looting rights to any decaying<br/>\narmor. So far it hasnt worked. Too many SKs in the<br/>\nzone who want it for themselves, but their are lots of<br/>\nRogues in their now. So i plan on holding any Raven<br/>\narmor for ransom.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the grind<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Chip Paul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Has anyone found any yet?
