Damn I thought they were a rumor.. :)<br/>\n <br/>\nI would love to see some nice quest items. Especially other black armor<br/>\n(besides Umbral, which I still can&#39;t get). I&#39;m using a combo of Crested,<br/>\nRubi and Charred now, and while the Red, Silver and Black looks good I&#39;d<br/>\nlike to be in full black plate (especially if it only fits small races and<br/>\ngives STR, DEX and AGI bonuses). You could give the Trolls/Ogres specialty<br/>\nplate as well but make it give Int bonuses. If you think about it Warriors<br/>\njust got a armor quest (very nice stuff btw), so it wouldn&#39;t be that<br/>\nunfeasible for the SK&#39;s to get some.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso something other than the DR or Fleshripper would be nice, (I have to go<br/>\nwith the DR mainly since the the FR has that AE spell which seems to just<br/>\nhelp me piss off everything in a 10 sq mile radius).<br/>\n <br/>\nThom<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Brian Hook [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 17, 1999 1:42 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [shadowknight] I give up<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo do you think that equipment quests are a viable alternative?
