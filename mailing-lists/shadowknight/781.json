This is a really lame part of the Shadow Step spell.  The spell<br/>\nactually began to work against me since more often than not I would be the<br/>\none to get disoriented and my target would somehow miraculously know exactly<br/>\nwhere I was going to appear.  And may the &quot;gods&quot; help me if I was fighting a<br/>\ncaster when I used Shadow Step.  They simply just kept blasting as if I<br/>\ndecided &quot;No wait Mr. Caster, kill over here in this spot instead.&quot;  Complete<br/>\nand total waste of mana since the you remain targeted by your opponent.  So<br/>\nto answer your question if this spell is still the same as it was when I was<br/>\nusing my Necro than it wouldn&#39;t hurt my feelings to see it go.
