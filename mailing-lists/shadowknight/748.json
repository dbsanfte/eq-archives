What were the spells that SKs had removed from them back during beta,<br/>\nbefore the game went final? Like Boil Blood, Banshee Aura, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Why were those spells removed? If we can get some insight into Verant&#39;s<br/>\nreasons behind the removals, then it will make it easier for us to come up<br/>\nwith a &quot;least-offensive&quot; change that we (the SKs) would like.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I think it&#39;s great that someone from Verant is on this list and not just<br/>\nlistening, but actually polling us on what we would like to see changed.<br/>\nAdditionally, I do so enjoy seeing this list alive again. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n4. I understand that no new spells can just be added without a corresponding<br/>\nloss of some. But I think we need to hold this as two separate<br/>\nconversations -- i.e. first we need to decide possible spells (or<br/>\nspell-lines) to be added, and THEN concentrate on what we&#39;d give up for<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. I would personally prefer damageshielding over lifetapping. If you think<br/>\nabout it, lifetapping is one of those non-melee spells, meaning that you<br/>\nhave to step back out of combat to really effectively cast them. Being a<br/>\ntank-type class, that really isn&#39;t feasible for us, and I think this is<br/>\nbeing overlooked. A damageshield, on the other hand, is like VE, you cast it<br/>\nbefore the fight (when your puller says INC) and then it just works<br/>\nthroughout the fight. Sure, shielding doesn&#39;t give us healing like a lifetap<br/>\ndoes, but I actually agree with Beld after thinking about it -- giving us<br/>\nreal healing will (a.) draw fire from other hybrids, and (b.) overbalance<br/>\nthe class. Shielding won&#39;t change anything unless you&#39;re actually getting<br/>\nhit, and then it&#39;ll be very nice to see 8hp a pop (or whatever). Think about<br/>\nit folks, as a tanking SK, which would you rather have -- a spell that can<br/>\nheal you but you can&#39;t cast, or a spell you can put on beforehand that&#39;ll<br/>\nwork without you worrying about it? For me, the choice is clear -- damage<br/>\nshields all the way.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
