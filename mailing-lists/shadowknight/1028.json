They look<br/>\nlike arms.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn additional note. WWe happen to be grouped with the<br/>\nfirst level 50 SK on our server, Kagal (a Troll) and<br/>\nas far as i know still the only one and has been for a<br/>\nwhile. Anyway..he got both parts to the Breastplate.<br/>\nHe went off to Mistmoore to ckaim his prize. Not that<br/>\nhe needed it, he has PoF BP. But any he messaged us<br/>\nwith the stats.<br/>\n<br/>\n18AC<br/>\n10 STA (i think)<br/>\n3 SV MAgic<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like the BE chest<br/>\n<br/>\nThats it folks. Nothing all that spectacular. Andi its<br/>\nNO DROP. So no giving it to your friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats the only piec4e i have seen or heard of<br/>\ncompleted.<br/>\nWe have the parts to the Bracers, but need the Mino<br/>\nShackles..thats our next adventure.
