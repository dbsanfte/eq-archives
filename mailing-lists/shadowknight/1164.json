(i guess someone will say this can be <br/>\nreported under verant&#39;s new &quot;play nice rules&quot; but the last time i <br/>\nreported/petition anything the response took well over 4 hours to arrive <br/>\nwith the end effect being 0 due to the guide&#39;s apprectice status.)<br/>\n<br/>\nkg<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw - to add to the frustration of an idiotic change like this. anyone  can <br/>\ncomplete the quests...ranger, bard, wood elf, human...so, now you have not <br/>\nonly the threat of high level farmers but mid level quest sploiters who hunt <br/>\nthe TR or auction for spare decayed so that they (a human ranger for <br/>\ninstance) can grab a gate to Fay and make 1/2 bubble or more xp for every <br/>\npiece they complete.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhy should a non sk be able to start or complete a quest for an sk ONLY <br/>\nitem? (i know i already answered this with my own hypothesis but it would be <br/>\nnice to see what everyone else thinks. especially a verantite if they happen <br/>\nto read this.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [shadowknight] The madness has begun...<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 1 Nov 1999 18:50:02 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The other day a level 14 warrior messaged me and tried<br/>\n&gt;to get me to buy a DF Helm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Need i say more?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;=====<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
