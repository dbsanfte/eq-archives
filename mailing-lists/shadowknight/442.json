This isn&#39;t too bad but certainly get better.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I&#39;d like to see out harm touch be unresistable, or at least less<br/>\nsusesceptable. That is the primary concer for me.

I would be fantastic to have,<br/>\n&gt; but I doubt it will ever be implemented.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I think might be more feasible would be for Verant to increase the<br/>\n&gt; power of Vampiric Embrace so that it works exactly the same for both Necros<br/>\n&gt; and Shadow Knights. As near as I can tell, when we get it at level 22, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; effectiveness is already weaker then a Necromancer of around level 8. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; heard of many Necro&#39;s stating that it taps for 30+ a whack for them in the<br/>\n&gt; late teens, increasing by a point or so around every level. However, it<br/>\n&gt; seems that when we get the spell it is much weaker then a level 8 Necro&#39;s VE<br/>\n&gt; - which is why it taps for just six points or so at the start for us (which<br/>\n&gt; is in reality pretty useless). My Necro friend just confirmed that when<br/>\n&gt; Necro&#39;s get this spell around level 8, they tap for around 20 a whack. Why<br/>\n&gt; is it that when we get it, it starts at six?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now I&#39;m only a paltry level 13, so I can&#39;t confirm the Vampiric Embrace<br/>\n&gt; performance for Shadow Knights myself. But, from what I have been able to<br/>\n&gt; gather from message boards, this spell is definitely performing differently<br/>\n&gt; for us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My only other suggestion would be for Voice Graft to be replaced with Hungry<br/>\n&gt; Earth, a Necromancer spell of comparison level that would fit into our DOT<br/>\n&gt; theme as well providing a much needed Root type of spell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my two cents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zulk, Veeshan Troll SDK, 13th power<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
