That&#39;s the only<br/>\nrealistic<br/>\n&gt; way to get his attention.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I finally played with my pet last night, and have to say that in a party<br/>\n&gt; situation it&#39;s pretty useless.  When fighting in a party we tend to go<br/>\n&gt; after yellows a lot more, but most yellows will smack my pet in three<br/>\n&gt; blows, so I end up tanking for my pet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brian<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Share the wealth!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell a friend about ONElist&#39;s 130,000 free e-mail communities!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
