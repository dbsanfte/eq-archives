A few questions:<br/>\n|<br/>\n| 1)  What is the best god for HSK?  Innoruuk or Bertox?  Which cities can<br/>\neach enter safely without having to kill anything?  I&#39;m assuming the human<br/>\ncities plus High Hold for both, plus Neriak for Innoruuk SK&#39;s.  Can either<br/>\nsafely enter a city on either Faydwer or Erudin?<br/>\n|<br/>\n| 2)  Starting stats.  I was thinking +5 Str and + 15 AGI to set each to 90.<br/>\nAny thoughts on what a good Str value is.  Should I bump it to 100.  How<br/>\nheavy is medium armor?<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Thanks for any input.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Scragg Wraithbone (22nd TSK on Bristlebane)<br/>\n| Scregg Wraithbone (7th TSK on Mith.
