I&#39;m in a crested helm (steel plate look), charred<br/>\nbp (black plate look), steel greaves (soon to be rubicite if they would ever<br/>\nfix cazic), charred boots (black plate look), steel arms and bracers, and<br/>\nsnakeskin gloves (looks purple). And I use a Dark Reaver. This should give<br/>\nyou an idea of what I look like. I&#39;m in the Sol A/B area a lot trying to get<br/>\ncharred gauntlets to round out my black/steel look (it&#39;s the only charred<br/>\npiece I don&#39;t have) and go to B for exp.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just a generally nice guy (especially to lower level SKs). I didn&#39;t play<br/>\nan SK to be &quot;evil,&quot; I just liked the powers and abilities of the class. Plus<br/>\nI like (no, love) being a dark elf, all my characters are inkies. I don&#39;t<br/>\nusually roleplay that much, I just like to have a good time, and I<br/>\noftentimes do with my SK. This class really fit me more than any other I&#39;ve<br/>\ntried, and I have a hard time playing anything else. I was young once, like<br/>\nyou, and I asked all the same questions you did. Beld (Grant V) was kind<br/>\nenough to post some very detailed strategies and outlooks that I still use<br/>\nto this day. If you only get one thing off this list, make sure it&#39;s Beld&#39;s<br/>\nadvice. Listen to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, don&#39;t really have much to say. Being an SK is and always<br/>\nwill be fun to me, and I hope it will be for you as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nDravith Vandre&#39;i<br/>\nDark Elven SK (34)<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
