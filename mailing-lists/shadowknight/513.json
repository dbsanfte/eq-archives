But both<br/>\ntimes his corpse dissapears with no note! I complained to a GM that this<br/>\nhappened twice and my faction was going to hell with freeport merchants the<br/>\ngm replied -<br/>\n&quot;that merchants corpses dissapear to discourage players from killing them,<br/>\nand to send a email to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:questhelp@...\">questhelp@...</a> with details about the broken<br/>\nquest&quot; So, i sent my email and pretty much gave up on that one...<br/>\n<br/>\nIm currently trying to find the freeport guard traitor who works for the<br/>\nknights of truth, anyone know who it is? I sure do wish there was some high<br/>\nlevel SK quests like the paladins soulfire quest....im a level 40 human SK<br/>\nand have no real rewarding quests i can do....<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rufane darkmire of the stormravens-<br/>\ntunare<br/>\n<br/>\nCountess Bathory D&#39;Allatu wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So far these are the quests ive done and what i<br/>\n&gt; received for them. All in Qeynos<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kill Drosco: Sometimes a spell, little cash and Trumpy<br/>\n&gt; Quest<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trumpy: Kill him, bring in his Head. Little cash and<br/>\n&gt; his skull back for next quest.<br/>\n&gt; This ticks me off because if youre a goodie you can<br/>\n&gt; kill him bring in his head and get the BloodForge<br/>\n&gt; Hammer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trumpy&#39;s Skull: Bring it to Grimrot so it can be<br/>\n&gt; reanimated. Some cash, nice XP for my level at the<br/>\n&gt; time. 2 of us got nothing else, 2 got minor items.<br/>\n&gt; Onyx and raw hide cloak.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All that work and we received squat. VERY<br/>\n&gt; disappointing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kill Milea Clothspinner: brought back her cloth. got<br/>\n&gt; little cash and a rusty mace and a low level cleric<br/>\n&gt; spell. no new quest.<br/>\n&gt; Again VERY disappointing. Here i was level 10 or<br/>\n&gt; under, walking thru East Karana and taking on Milea<br/>\n&gt; who was red. (i did have help, but thats not the<br/>\n&gt; point) And i get a rusty mace.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kill Paladins and turn in their Amulets or prayer<br/>\n&gt; beads. I couldnt get this one to work for the life of<br/>\n&gt; me. But others have and they say the payoff was<br/>\n&gt; nothing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kill Arlena for Grimrot: this is in Mistmoore. Im only<br/>\n&gt; level 25 so thats out of my reach still.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s my question:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone done these quests recently or any of the<br/>\n&gt; Freeport quests and gotten anything worthwhile.<br/>\n&gt; The Trolls now have a couple good ones, and the<br/>\n&gt; goodies can kill the same target and get weapons that<br/>\n&gt; can sell for 100Pp.<br/>\n&gt; What do the Human Sks get now?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Have any of these Qeynos quests been upgraded or any<br/>\n&gt; added since ive been there? Are the Freeport quests,<br/>\n&gt; Steadirt in particualr, working?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n&gt; Minions of Darkness<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
