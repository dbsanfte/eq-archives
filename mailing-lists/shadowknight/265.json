Someone on the message board of my site was talking about the Soulfire, some sword which was originally intended to be Paladin-only, but was switched to SK-only. He said that in Beta 4, he went to get it with a group of level 35+ people, but the MOB carrying it was too tough, as he slashed for 140 points of damage. It seems that that would make the stats on this sword better than the Dark Reaver. Anyone else here anything about this sword?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTulwump, level 8 Shadow Knight</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
