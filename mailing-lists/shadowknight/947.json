Plus they can<br/>\noutrun SOW. How such stumpy little legs can move that<br/>\nfast is beyond me...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs suggested previously, con them...if they give you<br/>\nanything other than indifferent, they can see you.<br/>\nGather Shadows is REALLY flaky. Maybe i just have bad<br/>\nluck, but it will wear off sometimes even before the<br/>\nspell effects are finished swirling around me. And in<br/>\nsome places, its just horrible. In N Ro, oasis, and S<br/>\nRo, im lucky if it lasts 30 seconds. Cazic Thule and<br/>\nGuk also dont treat my invis with much respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would STRONGLY suggest against binding in Oggok.<br/>\nOgers dont like humans regardless of the fact that we<br/>\nare SKs. And the Bouncers see thru Shadows all the<br/>\ntime. Plus remember that when you hit your bind point,<br/>\nits usually after youre dead. No spells, no Invis at<br/>\nall. So if for some strange reason an Orge is near<br/>\nyour Bind point, you may get stuck in a very nasty<br/>\ndeath/spawn/death loop. No pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeign death. Has saved my but a few times. BUT..it<br/>\ndoes have a casting time of 1.5 seconds, so it can be<br/>\ninterrupted. And it doesnt always work. As a matter of<br/>\nfact, it has worked for me maybe only 25% of the time.<br/>\nHowever this may depend on how close you are to the<br/>\nMOB(s) that are aggro on you.<br/>\nIt seems to work pretty well in Guk. I went LD once<br/>\nand came back to my group being gone, a shaman, undead<br/>\nknight and some warrior who was hitting me for 80s. I<br/>\nfinally got a Feign off and it worked even with them<br/>\nbeating on me. It lasts forever as long as you just<br/>\nlay there. I believe the aggro eventually leaves the<br/>\nMOB, so you can theoretically, get up and walk away<br/>\nafter they are out of sight. Try that one at your own<br/>\nrisk though.<br/>\nCazic Thule on the other hand.. I have much less<br/>\nsuccess in CT with feign, though it has worked. They<br/>\njust arent fooled as easily as the froggies<br/>\napparently.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1) Do guards see invis? I wonder because I hope that<br/>\n&gt; now I can bind just<br/>\n&gt; inside oggok or grobb when in cazic (I hate that<br/>\n&gt; place) or guk (a little<br/>\n&gt; better) to avoid the long long run back from E<br/>\n&gt; Freeport.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) How long does feign death last? Indefinitely? Is<br/>\n&gt; it usable in combat<br/>\n&gt; situations? ie I am generally the only non-gater in<br/>\n&gt; my group. Does it cast<br/>\n&gt; quickly like shadow step so that I can cast it after<br/>\n&gt; taunting 5 mobs on me<br/>\n&gt; so my group can gate out of there? I know my<br/>\n&gt; girlfriend is looking forward<br/>\n&gt; to me getting feign death after I explained how it<br/>\n&gt; works because she started<br/>\n&gt; the game only recently but expects me to help her<br/>\n&gt; level. Hmmm. No Level no<br/>\n&gt; Lovin&#39;? Heh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
