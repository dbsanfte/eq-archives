I liked the fact that lowbies couldn&#39;t get the<br/>\narmor unless they did it themselves. My opinion is that all class specific<br/>\narmor should be No Drop, if you can&#39;t do the quest with the character that<br/>\nwill be wearing the armor then you shouldn&#39;t have it. (But of course i&#39;m one<br/>\nof those that thinks there should be level limits on armor and equipment<br/>\nanyway.. I hate seeing lvl 10 and under Sk&#39;s with a DR or similar)..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway... I think I&#39;ll feedback it as well when I get on tonight..<br/>\n<br/>\nOh something that was kind of bugging me, is there anyway to delete a spell<br/>\nfrom your spell book? The since the new lifetaps didn&#39;t overwrite the<br/>\nexisting spells I still have them in my book (and obviously can&#39;t use<br/>\nthem).. I&#39;ve moved them to like page 15 or so, but would like to delete<br/>\nthem. Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 29, 1999 11:27 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] AAAAAACCCCCCCCKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI came across some disturbing info last night...<br/>\nDarkforge Armor is no longer NO DROP.<br/>\nAll the pieces that I have that WERE NO DROP, arent<br/>\nany longer.<br/>\nThis is bad,bad,bad,bad....<br/>\nItem farming was bad enough before.<br/>\nHaving the DF armor NO DROP saved us from having to<br/>\ncompete with other who want the items to sell or twink<br/>\ntheir level 5 SKs with.<br/>\nNow we are back to square one.<br/>\nBTW...Why can ANYONE do these quests?<br/>\nIt is SK only armor.<br/>\nAnd the same should go for all the other class armors<br/>\nas well.
