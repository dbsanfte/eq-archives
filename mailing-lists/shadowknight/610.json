Wohoo. 2nd and most<br/>\n&gt; annoying, I cannot walk around the ledge of the pool of<br/>\n&gt; water because my troll a$$ is too wide. :( So if I am in<br/>\n&gt; Neriak or the commonlands then I can walk to the guild<br/>\n&gt; from West FP to East FP and train, but need to leave via<br/>\n&gt; East Treeport and Zone through the tunnel to the<br/>\n&gt; commonlands. That is still better than going through<br/>\n&gt; Oasis and both parts of Ro and the Innothule for half of<br/>\n&gt; the trip.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone out there ever see the Spore Guardian?  I<br/>\n&gt; wandered the entire swamp last night for 2 hours looking<br/>\n&gt; for him and only found fungusman trackers. Do you need<br/>\n&gt; to talk to the #2 for the SK guild to trigger him<br/>\n&gt; spawning?  Is there a certain time of the game day? It<br/>\n&gt; was 6PM gametime when I started looking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The swamp now gives very little XP except for the<br/>\n&gt; occasional fat and bull alligator, and the Lesser<br/>\n&gt; Mummmies that spawn at the tower. Nothing over a<br/>\n&gt; Froglock Fisherman spawned last night. Aren&#39;t there<br/>\n&gt; higher level Frogs that spawn in the swamp? If not then<br/>\n&gt; it looks like I will need to either try Guk solo or the<br/>\n&gt; bandit camps in South Ro. Of course it could be a time<br/>\n&gt; of game day issue again too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Got an Ogre to get me the HEHE meat from Chef Dooga.<br/>\n&gt; What a pain in the a$$.  The exchange went fine and we<br/>\n&gt; were both very happy.  I talked for a while then went to<br/>\n&gt; put them in the bank for when I give them to Carver.<br/>\n&gt; While I was talking, I ATE ONE!  I was very POed! I had<br/>\n&gt; 14 rations on me an the system had me eat a HEHE meat!<br/>\n&gt; The ogre that got them for me said &quot;maybe that why it<br/>\n&gt; called HEHE...&quot; DOH!  Anyway, I paid him to go get me<br/>\n&gt; more HEHE (5 this time in case he ate one by accident,<br/>\n&gt; and/or I ate another one) which I immediately ran and<br/>\n&gt; put in the bank. Now I have enough HEHE meat to do the<br/>\n&gt; Quest twice. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This list is VERY quiet. Make some noise people!!!!<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t care what you send. Just send something. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Left Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n&gt; 10th Season Troll SK<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
