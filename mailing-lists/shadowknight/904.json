I think I am not <br/>\nenjoying my Troll anymore.  Since I started playing my <br/>\nDruid, I dread getting on as my troll. But I can&#39;t put <br/>\nmy finger on why. I haven&#39;t played Cronik in a week or <br/>\nso.<br/>\nI have /played my Druid for &lt;14 hours and am 2 bubs into <br/>\n6th level.  I guess I have learned how to level rather <br/>\nquickly with my class of choice.  This may be slow to <br/>\nsome, but for me it is astronomically fast.<br/>\nI am in the middle of a mental debate on whether or not <br/>\nto scrap him, sell everything, run to my druid, die and <br/>\nleave him a big inheritance.<br/>\nAnyone else run into this problem of character ping-pong?<br/>\nThings at home are also very stressed, so that isn&#39;t <br/>\nhelping either.<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik Khaos &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
