There&#39;s always the<br/>\nboring old combine/well balanced weapons.  But more<br/>\ninterestingly, I&#39;ve seen several shadowknights go with<br/>\na bladed thulian claws from aof in cazic along with a<br/>\nshield.  There&#39;s also an obsidian scimitar that is a<br/>\nrare drop off the goblin foreman in sol a.  Personally<br/>\nI think that might be a nice look for a eurdite sk. <br/>\nThose are the options that occur to me right off the<br/>\ntop of my head.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more and also that<br/>\nKunark will bring more options as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtrocity<br/>\nthe Revelation<br/>\nTallon Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott.mcgougan@...\">scott.mcgougan@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello All,<br/>\n&gt; This is my first post to the list and I have only<br/>\n&gt; recently become<br/>\n&gt; interested in the ShadowKnight class.<br/>\n&gt; I started an Erudite SK with a vision of a shield<br/>\n&gt; and sword combo.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; learning that starting a character<br/>\n&gt; with a vision can be quite disappointing!  My<br/>\n&gt; efforts to find a nifty<br/>\n&gt; magical sword (1H Slash) have actually<br/>\n&gt; been the thing that has met with disappointment, the<br/>\n&gt; character himself is<br/>\n&gt; quite interesting and fun to<br/>\n&gt; play/ role-play. At any rate, I was wondering if I<br/>\n&gt; am just overlooking<br/>\n&gt; something....  Are there ANY 1H Slash<br/>\n&gt; SK specific weapons that don&#39;t come from the Planes?<br/>\n&gt;  I have been watching<br/>\n&gt; reports come out Kunark,<br/>\n&gt; and it would seem that NPCs there are only capable<br/>\n&gt; of dropping 2H Slash or<br/>\n&gt; 2H Blunt weapons<br/>\n&gt; (perhaps only a SLIGHT exaggeration :) ).  Failing<br/>\n&gt; SK specific weapons,<br/>\n&gt; what would the recommendation be?<br/>\n&gt; ...and sadly, a SS:Ykesha is going to be quite out<br/>\n&gt; of my grasp for a<br/>\n&gt; while....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Azamai Ebontide<br/>\n&gt; of Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend online invitations with Yahoo!
