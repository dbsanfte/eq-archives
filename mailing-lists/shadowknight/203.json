As for Grobb and Oggok.<br/>\n&gt; Trolls and Dark Elves can&#39;t travel into Oggok completely safe.  There are<br/>\n&gt; Ogres that will KoS us...as weird as it sounds.  I think between evil<br/>\n&gt; race/class&#39;s   Trolls and Dark Elves get along the best. From what I<br/>\n&gt; understand they trust each other the most. I don&#39;t really like Ogre&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; anyhow....so no skin off my back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Korm<br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the<br/>\nWeek!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
