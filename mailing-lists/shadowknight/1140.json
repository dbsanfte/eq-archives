(i&#39;m now only short the decayed<br/>\nhelm). am i a bastard for exploiting this? yes. but anything that gets me<br/>\nout of that gods forsaken hole known as cazic faster.. it wasnt a totally<br/>\nselfish affair tho, there were numerous lvl 30ish in the group, so i<br/>\nintroduced them to the xp money train. got at least two of them over a<br/>\nbubble and a half of xp in that timeframe. sadly we got trained out by<br/>\nsomebody before many tae ew lizards spawned, but we had both the upper and<br/>\nlower TR locked down with our lone group, and we didnt even have a dedicated<br/>\nhealer. it was pretty fun :)<br/>\n<br/>\nby the way, wearing a full suit of darkforge minus the helm (hatless<br/>\nactually) looks pretty damn cool ;p<br/>\n<br/>\nBeld Demonblade<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
