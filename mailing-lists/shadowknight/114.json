Necromancers get <br/>\nLeering Corpse at 4th, we get it at 9th. They get Bone walk at 8th and <br/>\nwe get it at 15th. Now.. this idea may make Shadow knights a bit <br/>\npowered up at 9th, but I think maybe SK&#39;s should get another pet level <br/>\nup at their level. Like at 9th they get Bone Walk. By the time we get <br/>\nour next rank, we get the 12th level pet, a few levels after the <br/>\nnecromancer, plus they&#39;ll be getting a better one at 16, while we get <br/>\nthat one at 22, by which time they already have a better one then what <br/>\nwe&#39;ll get. Would look something like this<br/>\n<br/>\nConvorting Bones<br/>\n  Necro: 8th<br/>\n  SK: 9th<br/>\nConvoke Shadow:<br/>\n  Necro 12th<br/>\n  SK: 15th<br/>\nRestless Bones<br/>\n  Necro: 16th<br/>\n  SK: 22nd<br/>\nAnimate Dead:<br/>\n  Necro 20th<br/>\n  SK: 30th<br/>\nHaunting Corpse:<br/>\n  Necro 24th<br/>\n  SK: 39th<br/>\nSummon Dead<br/>\n  Necro 29th<br/>\n  SK: 49th<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, at 9th level I suppose our pet might be just a bit to strong, but <br/>\nseeing as Leering Corpse isn&#39;t much while Paladins at level 9 will get <br/>\nto heal themselves and others, cure poison, and get a +AC/HP spell... <br/>\nwell two actually, one that lasts just 18 seconds while the other <br/>\nlasts a while. At 15th they&#39;ll get to Cure Disease, summon a magic <br/>\nweapon (so it&#39;s 1h blunt.. it&#39;s still magic, we only have disease <br/>\ncloud and engulfing darkness to do &quot;magic&quot; damage, if we want a weapon <br/>\nwe need a magician to get a magic weapon, or buy a 50+ plat combine <br/>\none..), heal themselves and others better, have another +AC spell, <br/>\nlull any monster (not just undead, that we get at 15), and get their  <br/>\nWard Undead spell at 15. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe being able to summon a magic weapon is another reason for the <br/>\nreason to increase out pets &quot;level&quot; by one.. because I believe that <br/>\nConvoke shadow pets can hit magic things also. That way we would have <br/>\na way to hit magic creatures a little easier also. <br/>\n<br/>\nLets move on to Rank 3 spells..<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins receieve another +AC/HP spell, resist poison, a light spell, <br/>\nability to restore stamina &lt;I think this means restore lost fatigue <br/>\n(I&#39;m looking at eq.stratic.com spell lists for SK and paladin..) get <br/>\nthier invis. to undead spell, lower a targets strength, and the nice <br/>\nhelpfull spell when things run away: root.<br/>\nWe get, at this time, convoke shadow, a heal other spell-harm <br/>\nourselves spell, see invis and in the night &lt;big whoop unless you&#39;re a <br/>\nhuman&gt;, another DoT spell, a Fear the Undead spell, Vampiric Brace <br/>\n&lt;which, according to all you which is all I really know about the <br/>\nspell, doesn&#39;t even work properly&gt;, and our DD spell for Undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn to Rank 4, which is the last list for both Paladins and SK&#39;s on <br/>\nthis web site..<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins recieve a better DD to undead only (Expluse Dead, 8-80) a <br/>\nsummoned magic warhammer (Hammer of Striking) , a better healing spell <br/>\n(Healing, for all those who want the exact name, which does 4-40 <br/>\nhp), an improved Lull (Soothe), another +AC spell (Spirit Armor), a <br/>\nprevent a target from moving spell (Stun), and a +HP spell.. (Symbol <br/>\nof Transal).<br/>\nWe get a plus to resisting disease spell (Endure Disease), a fake <br/>\ndeath spell (Feign death), our invisibility spell (finally, Gather <br/>\nShadows), another DoT Spell (Heat Blood), another pet spell (Restless <br/>\nBones), a talk through out pet spell (can you say useless? I knew that <br/>\nyou could, Voice Graft), and a area effect lower strength spell (Wave <br/>\nof Enfeeblement... has anyone really seen any difference in a monster <br/>\nwhen they&#39;ve been &#39;weakened&#39;? I&#39;m not saying this spell is useless, <br/>\nbut I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve seen a  difference between a &quot;weakened&quot; strength <br/>\nwise monsters to one that isn&#39;t..)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell that&#39;s it spell wise.. and this is longer then I thought I&#39;d <br/>\nramble on about. So far all I see from the difference spell wise is <br/>\nthat Paladins can heal alot and we get Damage of Time spells and one, <br/>\nto current knowledge, non-working Vampiric Touch spell.. <br/>\n<br/>\nI personally don&#39;t really know what spells we get at 39th or mostly at <br/>\n49.. I think at 49th we get area effect direct damage spell, called <br/>\nWord of Shadow, which is also a Cleric spell and Necromancer spell. I <br/>\nthink it does damage to those around the caster sense it&#39;s like a <br/>\nspoken word and only those near by will get effected. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Harm Touch.. eh.. I use it for emergencies and have only seen a <br/>\nfew &lt;about 20&gt; of the damage resist off it from whatever I was <br/>\nfighting.. I haven&#39;t had it resisted all together yet though... I <br/>\ndon&#39;t really care all that much if they do anything to it or not, <br/>\nunless of course they make it worse, should they tinker with it all. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell.. I&#39;m done.. and I&#39;m sure some people will disagree with <br/>\neverything I&#39;ve said, part of what I said, or agree with all of it, or <br/>\nagree with some of it... to each their own &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 13 Tier&#39;dal Shadow Knight, Bristlebane server..<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
