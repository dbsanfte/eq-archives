Hello?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blademaster@...\">blademaster@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWow, just wondering if Santa Claws got all of the other Shadow Knights out<br/>\nthere, or what?  I have not recd a digest since the 10th of Dec. and was<br/>\nwondering what&#39;s up?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone out there is getting this, what is a GOOD area for a 20th lvl DE<br/>\nSK to go and hunt?  I have been hunting in HPH and getting good xps, but<br/>\nwondering where to go next.  Also, has anyone *ever* gotten to the point<br/>\nwhere they were not KOS to the HP guards?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an additional aside, I was wondering what the general consensus was on<br/>\ncosts for the following items:  Silvery-plated Bracer, Blackened Iron Armor<br/>\n(any piece or general guideline, like 5plat per AC or what?), BIBS, and Dark<br/>\nReaver?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anyone out there?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re looking for an easy way to some decent armor you might want to see<br/>\nif you can creep down to Lower Guk and pick up some Shin armor. There are<br/>\noften corpses around just waiting to be looted since it is no drop and<br/>\nanyone there already has it or doesn&#39;t want it. It drops of Shin Ghoul<br/>\nKnights, although at 20 you certainly won&#39;t be killing them yourself (just<br/>\nmooching the loot lol), although people shouldn&#39;t mind. Silvery-Plated<br/>\nBracer is a nice thing to have, mainly because of the look of course (poison<br/>\nand disease resists are nice too since it augemnts our natural resists as<br/>\nsks), and the fact that it isn&#39;t too expensive.<br/>\nBI doesn&#39;t have good AC, but personally I put on certain pieces once I<br/>\nstarted to get really sick of bronze (to the point where I hated my char and<br/>\nrefused to play unless I looked sufficiently cool).<br/>\nThe BIBs is great for the 20s, try to have a Reaver by 30 tho (you won&#39;t<br/>\nregret it, being the DE you are hehe).<br/>\nAs for where to hunt, I soloed or grouped the Aviak Guards in Lake Rathe,<br/>\nanother option would be Unrest, although that might not be great exp since<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have to acquaint yourself with the dungeon (unless you alrady know<br/>\nit).<br/>\n<br/>\nPhantasaic Voidstone, DE SK, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
