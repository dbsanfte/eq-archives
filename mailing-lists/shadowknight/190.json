I like the fact that<br/>\nthere are only a few places for us to run and hide.  It will make or<br/>\nvictory that much sweeter.  And when I am sitting on the Throne...in the<br/>\ncity of Felwithe....Innoruuk himself will come down and cast the land back<br/>\ninto darkness.  ::wow:: that was weird.  I was taken over for a<br/>\nsecond::snickers::  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy one problem with playing an evil race or class is I(Dark Elf/SK) have<br/>\nbeen killed before and seen Necro&#39;s killed just for being necro&#39;s.  While<br/>\nI understand that people will hate certain class&#39;s, but what I don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand is how they can tell you are a Necro or SK.  An SK looks just<br/>\nlike a warrior...a Necro looks just like any other magic class...so people<br/>\nthat are class prejudice shoudln&#39;t be able to tell one way or another(IF<br/>\nYOU DON&quot;T HAVE A PET OBVIOUSLY).  It just annoy&#39;s me that he can tell I&#39;m<br/>\na SK and not possibly a warrior or something along those lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nKorm<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
