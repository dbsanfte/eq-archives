I doubt I will ever use a Druidic Succor for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obvious reasons.  My wife&#39;s Bard worships Veeshan, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when teleported to the Druidic ring in the Karanas she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was KoSed.

In other<br/>\n&gt; words, you can be invis and still ride along. I&#39;m a dark elf SK who&#39;s killed<br/>\n&gt; many many druids, yet I just go invis during his casting, and I still get to<br/>\n&gt; tag along. Just a little trick so when you get 30, you can invis yourself<br/>\n&gt; and not have to miss out on teleporting. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dravith Vandre&#39;i<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On a humorous side note, I had just feigned after a bad pull in Cazic,<br/>\nwhen the screen went to the Loading please wait...
