Get someone<br/>\nto cast &gt;invis or camo on you.  Make the /corpse command a hotkey.  Get near<br/>\nyour corpse &gt;and drag it along to a safe spot in the zone by contiually<br/>\nclicking the hotkey &gt;with your mouse.  Your invis will not wear off until<br/>\nyou right click on your &gt;corpse.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
