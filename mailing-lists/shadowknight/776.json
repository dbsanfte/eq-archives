Even thought that would most likely make a mage tank<br/>\nas stated before (but is a Cleric Tank legal too then?).  Think you will<br/>\nhave to go to the equipment item base, the real question is how hard are the<br/>\nquest going to be, like finding a Mammoth tusk, which I don&#39;t think anyone<br/>\nhas found in South K yet (which has been reported as a rare spawn).<br/>\n<br/>\n*Rant Start* -&gt; sorry<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I would like the remove disease spell, had rabies once (attacking<br/>\nmummy) and 2 ppl group with me.  The didn&#39;t know what happened, I went<br/>\nunconscious, they killed it (while I was unconscious), and with no healing<br/>\n(and nothing attacking me) I didn&#39;t die.  With them being fairly new level<br/>\n(7 or 8) and not knowing what was going on, I just sat for 90 minutes on<br/>\nline unconscious eating bandwidth.... didn&#39;t make me happy (went and watched<br/>\nTV for 90 minutes).  I know this would not have helped me in this case since<br/>\nI was unconscious, but it would be nice.  Oh, and to add salt to the wound<br/>\nthey ungrouped with me and let me sit.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Brian) Could you talk to your programmers and if you are unconscious with<br/>\nrabies take 1 hp away every 60 seconds or so.  I would have rather just died<br/>\nthan sit their like that for 90 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Rant End* -&gt; again sorry<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\nTenin - Dark Elf SK - 16th lvl<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 17, 1999 3:19 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Shadowknight@onelist.com\">Shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [shadowknight] Another suggestion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nWhy not ty this instead... make the SK into an Anti-<br/>\nPaladin (which we are supposed to be really).
