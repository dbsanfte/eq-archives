All in Qeynos<br/>\n<br/>\nKill Drosco: Sometimes a spell, little cash and Trumpy<br/>\nQuest<br/>\n<br/>\nTrumpy: Kill him, bring in his Head. Little cash and<br/>\nhis skull back for next quest.<br/>\nThis ticks me off because if youre a goodie you can<br/>\nkill him bring in his head and get the BloodForge<br/>\nHammer.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrumpy&#39;s Skull: Bring it to Grimrot so it can be<br/>\nreanimated. Some cash, nice XP for my level at the<br/>\ntime. 2 of us got nothing else, 2 got minor items.<br/>\nOnyx and raw hide cloak. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that work and we received squat. VERY<br/>\ndisappointing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKill Milea Clothspinner: brought back her cloth. got<br/>\nlittle cash and a rusty mace and a low level cleric<br/>\nspell. no new quest.<br/>\nAgain VERY disappointing. Here i was level 10 or<br/>\nunder, walking thru East Karana and taking on Milea<br/>\nwho was red. (i did have help, but thats not the<br/>\npoint) And i get a rusty mace.<br/>\n<br/>\nKill Paladins and turn in their Amulets or prayer<br/>\nbeads. I couldnt get this one to work for the life of<br/>\nme. But others have and they say the payoff was<br/>\nnothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKill Arlena for Grimrot: this is in Mistmoore. Im only<br/>\nlevel 25 so thats out of my reach still.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my question:<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone done these quests recently or any of the<br/>\nFreeport quests and gotten anything worthwhile.<br/>\nThe Trolls now have a couple good ones, and the<br/>\ngoodies can kill the same target and get weapons that<br/>\ncan sell for 100Pp.<br/>\nWhat do the Human Sks get now?<br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of these Qeynos quests been upgraded or any<br/>\nadded since ive been there? Are the Freeport quests,<br/>\nSteadirt in particualr, working?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
