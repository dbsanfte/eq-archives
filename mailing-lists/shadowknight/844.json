Does Unrest give negative faction hits \r<br/>\nwith any of the Nerco/Evil guilds that I will need to \r<br/>\nkeep high in my later career?\r<br/>\nMy major problem with leaving Antonica for Faydwer is \r<br/>\nthat my lag is so bad for crossing zones (2-2.5 minutes) \r<br/>\nmost times that I miss being able to get off the boat at \r<br/>\nall.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLoading Please wait...\r<br/>\nYou have entered Butcherblock!\r<br/>\nLoading Please Wait...\r<br/>\nYou have entered Ocean of Tears!\r<br/>\nLoading Please Wait...\r<br/>\nYou have entered East Freeport!\r<br/>\nLoading Please Wait...\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis has happened to me literally so that for 2 hours I \r<br/>\nwas stuck on that damn boat. I only got off the boat \r<br/>\nbecause I petitioned a GM who pulled me off with that \r<br/>\nvery nice... \r<br/>\n&quot;YOU have been SUMMONED by the gods, prepare yourself!&quot;\r<br/>\nFirst time though that jerk of a GM said I needed to be \r<br/>\nin the same zone. But I wanted to be in Freeport and was \r<br/>\non my way to BB having just missed the zone.  When he \r<br/>\nrealized how long he would need to wait for me to return \r<br/>\non the boat &quot;miraculously&quot; he was able to summon me from \r<br/>\nOOT.\r<br/>\nANYWAY...\r<br/>\nI also dread a teleport to Faydwer for the same reason. \r<br/>\nI have no idea what NPCs hang around wizard teleport \r<br/>\nrings.  I doubt I will ever use a Druidic Succor for \r<br/>\nobvious reasons.  My wife&#39;s Bard worships Veeshan, and \r<br/>\nwhen teleported to the Druidic ring in the Karanas she \r<br/>\nwas KoSed.  With my lag I would never see that I am \r<br/>\nbeing attacked, just the &quot;Returning to home point...&quot; \r<br/>\nmessage.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSomeone told me that getting more RAM would fix my lag \r<br/>\nproblems and that it may not be my 3d card. Anyone know \r<br/>\nPCs well enough to respond on this? Thanks.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n--\r<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;\r<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer\r<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK\r<br/>\nBertoxxulous\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
