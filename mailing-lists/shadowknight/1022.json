Up to five dark reavers at a time. Wow. What we lacked in nuking<br/>\npower we DEFINITELY made up for in staying power. We had some battles last<br/>\nupwards of 15 minutes, nonstop. We just hacked and slashed and slashed some<br/>\nmore. Our poor cleric. We just recruited her out of the blue. She was<br/>\njapanese and hardly spoke english at all, but DAMN was she a good cleric.<br/>\nOne of the better I have ever ever had the pleasure of being healed by.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, though, we got .....<br/>\n<br/>\na decayed right glove.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that was at about 10pm when the first SK was there waiting for the rest<br/>\nof us. During our 12 hours stint we actually got nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for those of you that haven&#39;t fought crusaders. My GOD are they tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell me this: Why is it that NPC SK&#39;s are just AWESOME (Lord Grimrot,<br/>\nHollish Tnoops, now Crusaders) but PC SK&#39;s suck so bad? Explain that to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well. I&#39;m glad to see this list be so active lately. And we&#39;ve all be<br/>\nsharing info and helping each other out. The one positive that has come out<br/>\nof this quest nonsense for me, at least, is that all the SK&#39;s (the like 15<br/>\nof us) on Solusek Ro are banding together to work with each other and help<br/>\neach other out. We&#39;ve always all been friends, but to see us all working<br/>\ntogether instead of trying to one-up each other like I see the Paladins and<br/>\nrangers etc doing, well, brings a tear to my evil eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck everyone! Someone get at least ONE piece out there, and let us<br/>\nknow, so we have a little hope!! (and if it is pink, is 3 ac, and -10 str,<br/>\ndex, agil, and -50 all saves, please keep it to yourself. Thanks. ;D)<br/>\n<br/>\nVirten,<br/>\nKnight of Innoruuk<br/>\n30th Circle of Hate</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
