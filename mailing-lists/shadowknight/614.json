This is an<br/>\nextremely rare spawn. In al the time I&#39;ve played I&#39;ve heard of him appearing<br/>\nONCE. (I&#39;m sure it has happened plenty more than that, but I heard it happen<br/>\nmerely once). He appears in a line straight out or so from Guk. Don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat level he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe troll in the OOT ... he&#39;s lvl 20. So don&#39;t bother to try him yet. Also,<br/>\nbe sure to get off the boat on the way BACK from Butcherblock, not on the<br/>\nway. The rocks are different rocks (as I found out to my dismay when I leapt<br/>\noff the boat). He isn&#39;t too tough for a lvl 20, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarves --- kill lots and lots of goblins. I&#39;ve killed lots of dwarves,<br/>\nthough, so I don&#39;t think I can ever get into Dwarf town, or Rivervale,<br/>\neither, since I have killed millions upon millions of halflings. Muhahahar.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil Norrath,<br/>\nVirten</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
