We will NEVER be as good a caster<br/>\n&gt; as a Necromancer.<br/>\n&gt; This should not take you by surprise.<br/>\n&gt; And you&#39;re only level 10? You&#39;re still a baby to the class, along with<br/>\n&gt; myself i will add.<br/>\n&gt; I have a friend who is level 20 SK and he&#39;s a major butt-kicker. We do<br/>\n&gt; come into our power, but patience and hard work is required.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And if you dont want to role-play the character, you chose the wrong<br/>\n&gt; line of work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am a level 12 Human SK. I have seen the Necromancers I travel with go<br/>\n&gt; from a level or 2 behind me, to 3 or levels ahead of me. And it is a<br/>\n&gt; little disheartening. But, this is the curse of the hybrid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But even these now higher level Necros like a little more muscle in<br/>\n&gt; between them and the creature wanting to dance on their foreheads. They<br/>\n&gt; cant cast if they&#39;re getting beat on.<br/>\n&gt; There have been many situations when even their pet has been killed and<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;m whats left to take the beating. Which i seem to enjoy in a weird<br/>\n&gt; and twisted way.<br/>\n&gt; I still save their butts as often as they save mine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And when they are out of mana and cant cast those spells that we are so<br/>\n&gt; jealous of and a train or high ranked creature decides to appear? Whos<br/>\n&gt; left? Us :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, in short, 10 is too young to decide. If you dont have the<br/>\n&gt; patience to wait until you come into your power, then SK is the wrong<br/>\n&gt; class for you. I can see my powers slowly, but surely rising.<br/>\n&gt; I have no doubt I WILL be feared.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bathory<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Explore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nYou can now easily share photos and documents with your fellow list members<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nCheck out our homepage for details on how to use our new shared files<br/>\nfeature!<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
