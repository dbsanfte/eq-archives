It would generate some<br/>\nmuch needed business for all the professional fletchers out there who devote<br/>\ntheir time and effort for the joy of it. Archery should be at least as viable as<br/>\nany other weapon, but it is clearly not. Archers a rare, when in my opinion,<br/>\neveryone that can carry a Bow should.<br/>\n<br/>\nInos<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJeremy Pollack wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Jeremy Pollack&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpollack@...\">jpollack@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I did not declare that anything was a bug exploit, I merely pointed out that<br/>\n&gt; these daggers are a pathetically easy way of raising your Archery skill. Due<br/>\n&gt; to Verant&#39;s EXCELLENT history of balancing this game, I find it extremely<br/>\n&gt; difficult to believe that they would put a component in the world that would<br/>\n&gt; allow you to raise your archery skill 5 points in 5 minutes when normally<br/>\n&gt; archery takes an extraordinary amount of time to raise unless you use it<br/>\n&gt; constantly. Yes, I did raise my own archery skill 5 points in 5 minutes (it<br/>\n&gt; was already at 72) while testing it to see if it worked. The ability to<br/>\n&gt; raise any skill, especially a combat one, that much in such a short amount<br/>\n&gt; of time must be considered a bug or something that Verant does not realize.<br/>\n&gt; If the daggers/pine needles were throwing weapons that went in the ranged<br/>\n&gt; weapon slot and used up one each time, that would make it a little bit<br/>\n&gt; better, but they are not, so for 8cp or something silly like that you get<br/>\n&gt; this item to raise your skill to its max with one nights work or less. As<br/>\n&gt; for waiting to hear back from someone of authority, I agree, that is why I<br/>\n&gt; and all my compatriots have /bug&#39;d this item. Your statement about them<br/>\n&gt; using the archery skill due to the aim factor is just as much conjecture as<br/>\n&gt; my statement, however. And by the way, the fact that they have such pathetic<br/>\n&gt; damage makes them the reason that they are that much more powerful at<br/>\n&gt; raising your archery skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyways, I just hope that Verant fixes this major game-balance problem soon<br/>\n&gt; before everyone and their momma is a master archer. :) I worked long and<br/>\n&gt; hard to become as good at Archery as I am, and it seems silly that someone<br/>\n&gt; can pick one of these items up and in a few hours of practice become a<br/>\n&gt; master archer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt; Jeremy Pollack, Shadow Knight, Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Leif Smart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leifsmart@...\">leifsmart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s hard;y a bug exploits. they use the arhcrey skill due to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aim factor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And the fact that they have such a pathetic damage. somthing like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1,  tends to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suggest this. I would suggest to wait to hear back from some one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in authority<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before declaring something to be a bug exploit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Inos<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jeremy Pollack wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jeremy Pollack&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpollack@...\">jpollack@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The tiny daggers and pine needles are *extremely likley* bugged melee<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weapons. I have seen them and tested them just enough to make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sure they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually bugged, and then I have /bug&#39;d them and continued on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my way. They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are melee weapons and help in the melee slot, there is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; absolutely no reason<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they should help out your archery skill.
