After doing several quests in Qeynos i became<br/>\nKOS on the docks (Trumpy and his buddies hang out<br/>\nthere). I had to wait for the boat to show and pay<br/>\nsomeone to invis me so i could make it to the boat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big problem for you is when you get to Erudin.<br/>\nThey didnt like me, but they didnt kill me either. You<br/>\nmay not be so lucky. You may want to consult other<br/>\nDark Elves on their faction in Erudin.<br/>\nThere may be other islands that have Kerrans on them<br/>\ntoo, not just Odus.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the Kerrans are a pain. They con green but beat<br/>\nthe heck out of you.<br/>\n--- atrocity apocalypse<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atrocity_apocalypse@...\">atrocity_apocalypse@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: atrocity apocalypse<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atrocity_apocalypse@...\">atrocity_apocalypse@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a DE Shadowknight and I&#39;ve been considering<br/>\n&gt; trying out the kerra<br/>\n&gt; island fire beetle quest.  Have any other DE SKs<br/>\n&gt; tried this?  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; interested in how you were able to get out to Kerra<br/>\n&gt; island.  I have a<br/>\n&gt; feeling that I&#39;ll be KOS in Quenos.  Is there a way<br/>\n&gt; to get to Kerra<br/>\n&gt; island without going through Quenos?  Is there some<br/>\n&gt; sort of way through<br/>\n&gt; Quenos similar to the sewers in freeport that is<br/>\n&gt; safe for DEs?  I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; love to hear from anyone who&#39;s done this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Atrocity<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxulous<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Books, music, auctions, and more.
