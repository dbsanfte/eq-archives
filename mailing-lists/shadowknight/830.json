It is a large place but if<br/>\nyou travel north and east until you near the river you will find it. Beware<br/>\nof the aviaks that inhabit this realm however as they do not like trolls for<br/>\nsome odd reason. I&#39;m not sure if it has anything to do with the fact that<br/>\nwhen you are older you will eat them or not? Anyways, if get to the river,<br/>\nyou&#39;ve gone too far (loc of camp is 200, -2300 because I know how much of a<br/>\npain in the arse it can be to find). The fletchie kits should be around 1<br/>\nplat or 2 (probably closer to 2 for you, my charismatic friend). The Centaur<br/>\nhas a name and is in one of the four centaur houses there. He also sells<br/>\nequipment for bowyery for when you decide to take up that trade.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you large one<br/>\n<br/>\nMay His Hate make you Strong<br/>\n<br/>\nVirten, Knight of Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
