For<br/>\nmost of us, the latter would put us right back in the<br/>\nsame spot we are in now. So no harm-no foul.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was really down on SheidSkin when they changed that.<br/>\nAnd though i would rather have Banshee back,<br/>\nSheildSkin isnt nearly as pathetic as i thought it<br/>\nwould be.<br/>\nI use it to pull casters or things with their own HT.<br/>\nAnd the SheildSkin usually eats a good part of the<br/>\ninitial casting. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo i dont think this will be as wonderful as some are<br/>\nhoping, but i dont think it will be as bad as some<br/>\nthink it will be either.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Wilson, ThomasX B&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thomasx.b.wilson@...\">thomasx.b.wilson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; While I applaud the removal of the useless spells<br/>\n&gt; listed, I see the spells<br/>\n&gt; them giving us to be equally useless. These spells<br/>\n&gt; will only benefit the<br/>\n&gt; lower level Sk&#39;s, and even then only in very limited<br/>\n&gt; situations (SOLO). In<br/>\n&gt; my opinion this is another example of listening to<br/>\n&gt; the majority sheep out<br/>\n&gt; there that get it in their head what would be good<br/>\n&gt; for the class without<br/>\n&gt; playing that class to a decent level (30+). I<br/>\n&gt; believe that SK&#39;s would have<br/>\n&gt; been better served by giving us better offensive<br/>\n&gt; spells, or even some<br/>\n&gt; defensive buffs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These lifetaps are barely adequate for Necros at the<br/>\n&gt; levels they get them,<br/>\n&gt; for SK&#39;s they would be a gimmick (and again now they<br/>\n&gt; can claim that SK&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; have healing). I would have much rather seen the<br/>\n&gt; skill cap on Bind wound<br/>\n&gt; bumped from 100 to 200. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh well just my opinion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thom<br/>\n&gt; Occasionally Columnist at the always tasty Voodoo<br/>\n&gt; Extreme...<br/>\n&gt; http:&#92;&#92;www.voodooextreme.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Chip Paul [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, October 22, 1999 1:36 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [shadowknight] Thank you Brian!
