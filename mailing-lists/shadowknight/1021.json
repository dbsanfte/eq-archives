The first would be to<br/>\nmake the armor always drop from the Crusaders. I don&#39;t mind the random<br/>\nspawns, in fact I find it preferable (Harder for higher lvls to farm the<br/>\nstuff for Twinks, BTW does anybody know if the armor itself is NO Drop???).<br/>\nThe other method would be to remove the no drop restriction from Decaying<br/>\narmor (this would cause item farming though).. Either way personally I find<br/>\nit unacceptable now and don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to go any further with the<br/>\nquest. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a complete side note which do you all prefer, A Lizzie Cloak or a White<br/>\nWolf Cloak?<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 15, 1999 10:30 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [shadowknight] Decayed armor?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is dropping..but it seems to be a 25% chance for a<br/>\ndrop..at least that has been our experience.<br/>\nI personally have a Decayed Left Vambrace. A friend<br/>\nhas a Bracer.<br/>\nOut of maybe 5 or 6 kills, those are the ony 2.<br/>\nAnother friend has killed about the same number and<br/>\ngot none.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs mentioned before this is worse than camping rubi.<br/>\nNot only do they seem to be slow spawns, but the<br/>\ndecayed stuff is a semi-rare drop. AND you need<br/>\nmultiple pieces for each piece of SK armor. So since<br/>\nall the drops are random, you may never see the second<br/>\npart to the one you already have. And since they are<br/>\nNO DROP, you cant trade with your friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i am trying is offering cash for the location of<br/>\nany crusader or for the looting rights to any decaying<br/>\narmor. So far it hasnt worked. Too many SKs in the<br/>\nzone who want it for themselves, but their are lots of<br/>\nRogues in their now. So i plan on holding any Raven<br/>\narmor for ransom.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the grind<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Chip Paul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Has anyone found any yet?
