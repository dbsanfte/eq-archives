By that I mean you don&#39;t <br/>\nsee the entire line of spells.  <br/>\nI never use my pet and consider it a waste of bone chips.<br/>\nAlso Dark Empathy sucks.  The amount of HPs transfered <br/>\nis minimal at 22nd level to really make a difference. Or <br/>\nam I wrong since I haven&#39;t reached that level yet?<br/>\nI would like to see a line of spells if given be <br/>\nprogressed to the endlike the Darkness line.  <br/>\nie. Disease Cloud, Aura Line, Damage Shields, Poison <br/>\nBolt Line, Undead DD  and Charm spells.  I would much <br/>\nrather have a Charm Undead spell than a Pet spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not give SKs the ability to gate?  <br/>\nLevel 22: Remove Dark Empathy<br/>\n          Enable Self Gate<br/>\nLevel 39: Remove Shield Skin (does it really do a        <br/>\n          whole lot at that high a level?  Does it even <br/>\n          absorb 1 hit from a creature?
