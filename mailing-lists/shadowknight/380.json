Until we know if<br/>\nShadow Vortex is &quot;better&quot; than Intensify Death, there&#39;s not much we can say<br/>\nhere, except that certainly sounds cool.<br/>\nNote also from the last patch, that Boil Blood is replaced with Dooming<br/>\nDarkness (not terrible, but probably not an upgrade, although it does seem<br/>\nfair, as someone pointed out a while ago, that someone who can melee the<br/>\nhell out of you shouldn&#39;t be able to have an extremely fast DoT spell as<br/>\nwell), and that Banshee Aura has been replaced with ShieldSkin (kind of an<br/>\ninteresting tradeoff, lose a spell that causes damage to the enemy when it<br/>\nhits you, to gain a spell that causes them to do less damage when hitting<br/>\nyou).<br/>\nNow if only they&#39;d add a decent SK-only 1H weapon...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
