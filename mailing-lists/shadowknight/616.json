You have to do the locker part of the quest as the locker contains the recipe.  The locker will actually raise faction.  I think the same faction that will suffer when you kill him, so killing him should be a wash faction wise.  And yes, I was able to give Carver C. the stuff despite him conning dubious to me.  There is no way that I know of that will raise faction with either the Ogres or Trolls when you can&#39;t do their quests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nScragg Wraithbone of Bristlebane (22nd level TSK)<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginal-From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\nOriginal-Reply-to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nOriginal-Date: Fri, 27 Aug 1999 16:26:28 +0000<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a post this morning that said the Troll in OOT is <br/>\nbetween 20-24th level MOB.
