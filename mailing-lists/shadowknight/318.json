But<br/>\nim at work now and bored, so i figured i just ask :)<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion #3:<br/>\nI just hit level 15 and got my second set of spells, but havent had a<br/>\nchance to use them yet.<br/>\nIs this the pet that has the magical attack?<br/>\nAnd if we have a pet and cast Shadow Step, does he commit suicide<br/>\nthinking we disappeared while in the teleportation stage?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just a note on archery. Apparently there are some pretty good bows<br/>\nout there that do a good 15 to 17 dmg per hit. So archery can be just<br/>\nas good as using a mino axe up close, but you dont have to worry about<br/>\ngetting hit melee wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny info will be appreciated.<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
