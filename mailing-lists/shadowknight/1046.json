I really don&#39;t buy the stats for it, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t see Verant giving us two pieces with nearly identical bonuses (Sta and<br/>\nMR in this case), I really hope this is not the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally with the stats as they stand now, I&#39;m sticking with my Charred BP<br/>\n(16AC, +3STR, +6 STA), at least until I can get a Dark Flame BP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know they mentioned that this armor is obviously not the best armor we can<br/>\nget (Umbral for now). I feel for what is required to obtain it though, we<br/>\nshould at least have decent stats (I still like the stats on the bracers,<br/>\njust not the red color). The majority of components needed can not be<br/>\nobtained without a well balanced full 30+ group (I would go so far as to say<br/>\nhigh 30&#39;s).

Example.<br/>\n<br/>\nIvy etched tunic (ranger):  19AC +3Str +3Wis +30HP<br/>\nDarkforge breastplate (sk):  18AC +10Sta +3Mr<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know exactly how stamina works, but I know that the +6 stamina<br/>\non my charred bp equates to about 13HP for me at level 33.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe leggings...<br/>\nLambent greaves (bard):  13AC +1Cha +5Agi weight 4.0<br/>\nDarkforge greaves(sk):  11AC +9Sta +3Mr weight 7<br/>\nIvy Etched greaves(rng): 12AC +5Agi +5Fire +5Cold<br/>\n<br/>\nBard:  2 AC more and weighs 3lbs less.  Also, the Agi bonus will give <br/>\nanother point or two of ac.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger:  1 more AC<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear they are upping the crusader spawns, which is good, but <br/>\nreally why do the rangers have higher ac on their chain armor? It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
