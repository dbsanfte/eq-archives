Why is it that sks have to be so balanced in there spells? Why is it that banshee aura was taken away ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1672231768\">This is gonna be a rant but please read it<br/>\neveryone....<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it that sks have to be so balanced in there<br/>\nspells? Why is it that banshee aura was taken away<br/>\ncause it was too good for big races?  Why is it that<br/>\nrangers are getting patched lately? Why is it that sks<br/>\nare the most underplayed class?  Why do we not have<br/>\nlifetap?...etc etc<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand at all why we can&#39;t have a spell<br/>\nlike banshee aura....it has been said that necros are<br/>\nthe most powerful magic class because of thier bad<br/>\nfaction..what do sks have? BAD FACTION!!!! maybe even<br/>\nworse than necros! shouldn&#39;t that make shadowknights<br/>\nthe most powerful hybrid class. even that fact that we<br/>\nare part necro should make us more powerful than the<br/>\nother hybrids cause necros are supposedly the most<br/>\npowerful mage class.  Why would it be so unbalanced<br/>\nthat we got a really nice spell??? i have gone through<br/>\n27 levels of:sitting on my ass waiting to<br/>\nheal(warriors have to do this but they don&#39;t take xp<br/>\npenalty), getting killed on sight by various npcs,<br/>\nbeing utterly worthless to a group now that darkness<br/>\nis canceled by everything, being shitted on by verant,<br/>\nand leveling so incredibly slow. would it be that<br/>\nunbalanced if we were admittenly more powerful than<br/>\nthe other hybrids. Shouldn&#39;t we be forces of pure<br/>\ndarkness and destruction and others run and hide when<br/>\nthey see us?  I would like to see us get some good god<br/>\ndamn spells for once and just have verant say &quot;over<br/>\nthe next few patches shadowknights will be the most<br/>\npowerful hybird, because of the sheer difficulty of<br/>\nthat class they deserve to be powerful&quot; but i doubt<br/>\nthis will happen because you guys(not you but others<br/>\nat verant) say things like HEY LETS PUT NEW RANGER<br/>\nWEAPONS IN ON THE TEST SERVER!!! if we were made the<br/>\nmost powerful class there would be a lot of bitching<br/>\nfrom paladins and rangers but i doubt they would play<br/>\nan sks due to the difficulty. I bet if verant just<br/>\ncame out and said we would be more powerful there<br/>\nwould be a lot less bitching from paladins and<br/>\nrangers.<br/>\n<br/>\ndone ranting <br/>\n<br/>\nTekman HateBringer <br/>\nOne pissed off shadowknight thats waiting to be flamed<br/>\nlevel 28<br/>\nrodcet nife server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
