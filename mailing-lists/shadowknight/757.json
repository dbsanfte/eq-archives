So for me I wouldn&#39;t change the resist rate. Now what I would<br/>\nlike is maybe instead of 10*Lvl what about 15*lvl, or have it recharge<br/>\nfaster based on level. (so say at lvl 40 it recharges once every 12 game<br/>\nhours).<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm not really sure on this one..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Brian Hook [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 17, 1999 1:26 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [shadowknight] Another suggestion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brian Hook&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkie dokie, seems like getting a consensus is NOT going to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo let&#39;s try another approach: what WOULD you like to see about the class to<br/>\nmake it more viable?  The reason the high level shields and DoTs were pulled<br/>\nis because (believe it or not) a lot of the players here are SKs and as such<br/>\nknow the class real well and giving them those capabilities made them into,<br/>\nliterally, tank mages.  It&#39;s a scary sight seeing these guys at work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve stated before, the thing that hurts the SK class are primarily race<br/>\nissues -- a damage shield on a human or DE SK is not unbalancing, however it<br/>\nIS unbalanced if you put it on a troll or ogre SK.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what can be changed that makes the class more viable for non-big-races<br/>\nbut at the same time is not unbalancing for trolls/ogres?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know HT comes up a lot, but there is a fear that HT could end up being<br/>\nheavily abused (worst nightmare....party of 6 50th level SKs stand around<br/>\nMr. Named Mob that only pops once a day anyway, BAM 3000HP gone instantly<br/>\nand you now have a mob that starts the fight at 1/2 HP).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf HT was upped slightly, had a slightly higher recharge rate, etc...what<br/>\nare your suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
