I am the leader of<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Da Bashin&#39; Iggles&gt;. My guild and our allies are preparing for a dragon<br/>\n&gt; raid in a month at the max. Tried Fire Giants for the first time on<br/>\n&gt; Saturday night, did ok on the first 3, but got massacred after that. Anyone<br/>\n&gt; got any tips on FG&#39;s, dragons, or breaking into the Planes? Pulling<br/>\n&gt; locations for FG&#39;s would be most beneficial at this time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A guildmate of mine has posted a fire giant pulling guide complete<br/>\nwith maps on everquest.allakhazam.com<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s called Aguro&#39;s guide to fire giants or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith T&#39;Vyn<br/>\n41st DESK<br/>\nStormravens</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
