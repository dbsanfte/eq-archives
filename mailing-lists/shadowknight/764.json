I agree though the task of finding something that would<br/>\nimprove the DE/Humans but not overpower the Trolls/Ogres is near impossible.<br/>\nHmm didn&#39;t they just improve warriors?? Since they are made up of mixed<br/>\nraces what did they do to them, so that the larger races aren&#39;t overpowered?<br/>\n <br/>\nSo far here is how I see it.<br/>\n <br/>\nLifetap - Useless for the level we would get them (plus take away from the<br/>\ndamage I would be doing engaging the mob).<br/>\nHarm Shields - Overbalancing for larger races and other classes have better<br/>\nones that are more effective anyway.<br/>\nAdditional Dot&#39;s - This might work (Give us back Boil blood and maybe Inf.<br/>\nCloud or something else).<br/>\nShields (Non Harm type - ala ShieldSkin) - At a lower level this would be<br/>\nuseful, also something past shield skin at the later levels.<br/>\nATK Enhancers - Would be nice..<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso what about criticals on 2hs?? Since the vast majority of SK&#39;s switch to<br/>\n2handers at the later levels - I really liked how my MM shield and Cry.<br/>\nSword looked though..<br/>\n <br/>\nHmm..<br/>\n <br/>\nThom<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Steven E.
