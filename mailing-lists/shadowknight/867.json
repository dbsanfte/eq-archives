This guy also wanders <br/>\n&gt;around that part of the zone. If I remember correctly <br/>\n&gt;that is.  I was part of a Paladin Holy Sword mailing <br/>\n&gt;list and it involved going to find someone in WC to give <br/>\n&gt;them a note.  They in turn gave you a note to return to <br/>\n&gt;someone else.  I think this also involved turning around <br/>\n&gt;very quickly and following someone that spawned behind <br/>\n&gt;you, and killing them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The paladin half came down to:<br/>\n&gt;Getting a note from the Marr Temple, giving it to the <br/>\n&gt;Shield Merchant in WC to warn him about something, <br/>\n&gt;getting a note to return to someone else, killing the <br/>\n&gt;above NPC that spawns, taking his head or another <br/>\n&gt;something from him back to the Temple.<br/>\n&gt;This is quick and dirty, and may also have changed <br/>\n&gt;somewhat.  To find out for sure, go to the Paladin list <br/>\n&gt;archives on Onelist for <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Holyswords@onelist.com\">Holyswords@onelist.com</a> (may want <br/>\n&gt;to search for that as the name of the list is fuzzy) and <br/>\n&gt;scan through it.  It may take a bit, but it is worth a <br/>\n&gt;try if you really, really, really want answers. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hope this helps you out.  It has been a while since I <br/>\n&gt;actually did anything Paladin related so things may have <br/>\n&gt;changed.
