Hidden messages and open interpretation writings have no place in<br/>\ninstruction manuals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd i personally dont mind how HT works now with only 1 use per<br/>\nday..BUT its all-too-often failure against creatures you really need it<br/>\nto work against makes it a weak &quot;special&quot; attack.<br/>\nAnd it is definitely not even close to being the equal on LoH. And ,<br/>\nyes, i am taking it literally that it is supposed to be its equal.<br/>\nIf its not equal, then our class isnt equal which means we are at a<br/>\ndistinct disadvantage in any PvP situation.<br/>\nThen add in the rest of the Paladins spells versus ours. We&#39;re in<br/>\ndefinite trouble.<br/>\nAnything we can cast on them , if its not resisted, they can heal.<br/>\nAnything they do to us, we&#39;re stuck with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe least they could do is make our HT more plausible.<br/>\nLoH heals totally... no resisted problems.<br/>\nHT does only 10dmg per level, but is resisted partially or totally on a<br/>\nregular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they added a lifetap funtion to this, i would have no complaints at<br/>\nall, resisted issues and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Krukhan Garabash [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krukhan@...\">krukhan@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, May 13, 1999 10:42 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [shadowknight] Concerns With SK Class<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Krukhan Garabash&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:krukhan@...\">krukhan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Did you ever think about the fact that the harm<br/>\n&gt; touch description could be<br/>\n&gt; intended to be read in a non-literal fashion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree that HT is somewhat weak. Though im not sure<br/>\n&gt; what to do about<br/>\n&gt; it...I&#39;ve never had an HT resisted while fighting<br/>\n&gt; creatures 8-10 levels<br/>\n&gt; above me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Really, I&#39;d like to see HT as a constant<br/>\n&gt; ability...One that decreases the<br/>\n&gt; casters health and mana with each cast.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
