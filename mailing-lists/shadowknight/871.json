Dismal Rage Message Intercept: Raltur Calikson in the shadowknights guild asks you to [serve] your Lord, Innoruuk.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2090536861\">Got all of this from Allakhazam&#39;s website.<br/>\n<br/>\nDismal Rage Message Intercept:<br/>\n<br/>\nRaltur Calikson in the shadowknights guild asks you to [serve] your Lord,<br/>\nInnoruuk. He explains that much like the Dark Elves of Neriak use trolls and<br/>\nogres as pawns,so does the Dismal Rage (the shadowknight guild) use the<br/>\nFreeport Militia.  Raltur wants you to report to Sir Lucan D&#39;Leer himself<br/>\n(found in the main militia building by the western gates), and tell him that<br/>\nyou [are from the Shrine of Innoruuk]. You are instructed to do whatever Sir<br/>\nLucan asks, because after all, little favors lead to large debts. Most<br/>\nimportantly, if you find something important, you are to bring it to him,<br/>\nnot Sir Lucan.  Talking to Sir Lucan reveals a different attitude as he<br/>\nberates the Dismal Rage for being slow to send an agent. He even threatens<br/>\nto have them broken up and jailed. Finally he tells you that his guards have<br/>\nreported that there is a messenger from Qeynos staying at an Inn on the<br/>\nwestern edge of the Commonlands. You are to go and intercept this message.<br/>\nIn fact you must kill Mojax Hikspin, who is sitting on the south ridge of<br/>\nthe lake in the western Commonlands. He has the message that was ment for<br/>\nthe Knights of Truth.  (and is the source of the Paladin&#39;s Message quest)<br/>\nIf you bring this message to Raltur Calikson in the Shadow Kngihts guild he<br/>\nwill give you a first level spell (other than faction and exp adjustment)<br/>\nand he will give you another quest to kill the traitor (see traitor quest<br/>\nbelow).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe faction for completing the quest is as follows:  Freeport Militia -<br/>\nBetter,  Coalition of Trade Folk III - Better,  Knights of Truth - Worse,<br/>\nPriest of Marr - Worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Traitor:<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter intercepting the message for Sir Lucan D&#39;Lere, he gives you the<br/>\nassignment to kill the traitor mentioned in the note and return his militia<br/>\ntunic.  The traitor&#39;s name is Guard Alayle, and he is in the Freeport<br/>\nMilitia House&#39;s backyard.  You may have to kill him several times before he<br/>\nwill give you a tunic .<br/>\n<br/>\nReturn the tunic for money and the following faction:  Freeport Militia -<br/>\nBetter,   Coalition of Trade Folk III - Better,   Knights of Truth - Worse,<br/>\nPriest of Marr - Worse.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nServant of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
