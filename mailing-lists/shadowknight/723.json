I estimate that in a standard fight using a 2 H sword I wouldswing 20<br/>\nto 30 times. so that is 40 to 60 dmg. times this by the 2 or 3 tanks you<br/>\nmight have in a group and you are looking at 100 to 180 extra dmg, roughly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile these numbers are fudged, it does show you how much extra dmg you mnay<br/>\ndo.
