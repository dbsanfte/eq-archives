Many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dungeons are bugged, cant even walk into sola, get back down the stairs<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unrest, etc. This change hurts the large races bad, and came way too<br/>\nlate,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; atfer everyone and the brother done got it. Now large races are<br/>\ndependent on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shamans to enter the dungeons. Sucks to depend on 1 class. Maybe they<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; throw out a shrink type item, course prob require getting a rare pop off<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dragon or something. I also feel like all the real cool items are gone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Manastones, guise, jboots, etc. On the older servers so many people<br/>\nalready<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have these, and the ogrew that got there late will have to stand and<br/>\nshout<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will pay for shrink at the dungeon entrance, while other people just<br/>\nclick<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on there mask. I am sure you smaller race shadowknights like the change<br/>\n&gt; &gt; though.... Dont see why they waited 9 months to do it....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a DESK, but ready to sign any petition for shrink potions available<br/>\n&gt; at potion shops at a reasonable price, and/or the inclusion of a<br/>\n&gt; clickable or wearable shrinking item.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; IMO, if size is the problem, there are better ways to fix it then<br/>\n&gt; turning into a DE.  A wearable all/all ring of shrink (or at least<br/>\n&gt; BAR,TRL,OGR) would be an ideal solution, but lets just hope they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; make it nodrop and in Sol A =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Xilith<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
