I also don&#39;t doubt that<br/>\neventually SK&#39;s will be powered up a little.  You played a human...a<br/>\nlittle stronger but limited magically.  Maybe if you tried a different<br/>\nrace you might have found more satisfaction.  I can&#39;t express how much I<br/>\nlove being a DE SK.  Not only for the evil nature I get to play...but also<br/>\nthe fact that when I get spells...i will get alot...not to mention that<br/>\nyour training and weapon skills have alot to do with how well your<br/>\ncharacter does.  Just because the SK isn&#39;t the most powerfull<br/>\nclass...doesn&#39;t mean its a bad class.  You played one race up to<br/>\n10....thats hardly anywhere in the world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKorm</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
