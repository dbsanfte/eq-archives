One of the things that Verant has<br/>\nbeen  bragging about for a long time is the fact that a level 50 warrior<br/>\ncould stand toe to toe with a level 50 wizzard or a level 50 shadow knight<br/>\nand the chances of winning would be 50-50.  Of course, I&#39;ve never actualy<br/>\npassed level 20 so I wouldn&#39;t know...Equiptment is suppose to be one of the<br/>\nequaling factors.  Warriors are suppose to get a shitload of kewl weaps and<br/>\narmer that no other class can, and so on.  But I have to agree, looking at<br/>\nthe game in turms of my lvl 7 shadow knight, I look pretty danm weak.  Just<br/>\nmy two cents<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tKanndar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
