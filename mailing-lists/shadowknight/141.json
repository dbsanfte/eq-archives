it will chase after<br/>\nanything that looks at it funny. luckily, the second pet and above are more<br/>\ncareful, only entering a battle if you order it or it sees that you have<br/>\nactually been attacked. also, pets are best used when solo, and then in wide<br/>\nopen areas. using a pet in a dungeon is a BAD idea. it is a good way to<br/>\nstart trains if your pet follows a fleeing target around a corner and you<br/>\nlose track of it. they also act as good repositories for any rusty weapons<br/>\nyou happen to come across in your travels. just be sure to learn ALL of the<br/>\npet commands, what they do, and have reclaim energy ready at all times if<br/>\nyou need to get rid of Jobaber in a hurry :)<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;m not sure how, but i&#39;ve actually gained xp FASTER than most of my usual<br/>\ngroup, who are mostly made up of humans. i myself am a human SK, and am now<br/>\nabout a full level higher than the people i&#39;ve been grouping with most. this<br/>\nwill sound really dumb, but here&#39;s my secret: don&#39;t die ;) wether it is by<br/>\nluck or some kind of instinct, i have managed to cut down my average of<br/>\ndeaths to a little under one death per level. i&#39;m not a coward; i have<br/>\nbrazenly ridden through areas that gave high level beta testers the jitters.<br/>\ni just take the time to know what to expect in the area i&#39;m in, and know how<br/>\nto avoid it, or how to get away from it :) death will STILL happen of<br/>\ncourse. the other day i crested a dune and suddenly found myself at the feet<br/>\nof three sand giants. it wasnt pretty, but at least i learned that spirit of<br/>\nthe wolf does no good if you are attacked by several giants at once. but<br/>\nmuch more often i have survived due to sheer luck, the quick actions of<br/>\ngroup members, or simply doing something really STUPID. (it may not sound<br/>\nwise to assist a dying high level in fighting a monstrous big baddie, but<br/>\nsometimes it actually saves you in the long run if it becomes too weak to<br/>\nfollow your retreat..)<br/>\n<br/>\nsorry if the email is too long or patronizing. i just dont like hearing<br/>\npeople thinking of giving up, so i make as many suggestions as i can :) hope<br/>\ni helped, or if i&#39;m just bugging you speak up and i wont ramble on so much<br/>\nagain ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeld Demonblade<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
