The classes are balanced for grouping, but not for pkill. I<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; also read that all tank types are getting smashed by pkill, as the mage<br/>\n&gt; types target you... and blast you..you however have to stay on them in<br/>\n&gt; order<br/>\n&gt; to hit them...if you have ever followed  someone, expecially someone<br/>\n&gt; trying<br/>\n&gt; to avoid you(zigging and zagging) it is very hard for you to hit them.<br/>\n&gt; As<br/>\n&gt; soon as the mage gets away from you he zaps you, and he does not even<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; to have you on his screen. All that I have read confirms this...If you<br/>\n&gt; think<br/>\n&gt; chasing a monster down to hit him is hard, try chasing a player...<br/>\n&gt; Throw in also pets, roots, sow etc...ermm...<br/>\n&gt; EQ was not desighned for pkill...try it, you will find the warr types<br/>\n&gt; are no<br/>\n&gt; match.<br/>\n&gt; Morgul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Countess Bathory &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 04, 1999 5:50 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [shadowknight] get this<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Countess Bathory &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I believe too that the Druid probably should have won, but it should<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; least have been a fight.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It sounds like the SK was used to mop the floor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And the HT did an absolutely pitiful amount of damage.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Which brings me back to my original complaints about the unreliability<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or our &quot;special&quot; weapon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Of course this does all depend on the types of weapons and armor both<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had and their skills in their weapon&#39;s type, offense and defense.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But i have a feeling that the buffing skills of druids are just way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more effective than any damage the SK could have done with his spells.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since a druid will do the same amount of melee damage with a chosen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapon as a SK, they have a distinct advantage.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But we already know that SKs will be considerably weaker than most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other classes at low-mid levels.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would like to hear from a SK 30+ and see if the clouds lining gets<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any shinier.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bathory<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist:  Where Star Wars fans unite!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Find your Star Wars list today!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join today!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
