Heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess when I look at Cronik, I feel limited in what I <br/>\ncan do. Granted, this is the purpose with a very <br/>\npowerful class.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI like the powerhouse that he is, but all the zone <br/>\ncrossing and limited bind points are frustrating. I will <br/>\nfigure something out.<br/>\nAgain thanks for your support. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik Khaos &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Princess Xaera&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xaera@...\">xaera@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My first character was a wizard, which I enjoyed playing (and still <br/>\n </span></blockquote>do from <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;time to time), but I enjoy my SK even more.

I think I am not<br/>\n&gt;enjoying my Troll anymore.  Since I started playing my<br/>\n&gt;Druid, I dread getting on as my troll. But I can&#39;t put<br/>\n&gt;my finger on why. I haven&#39;t played Cronik in a week or<br/>\n&gt;so.<br/>\n&gt;I have /played my Druid for &lt;14 hours and am 2 bubs into<br/>\n&gt;6th level.  I guess I have learned how to level rather<br/>\n&gt;quickly with my class of choice.  This may be slow to<br/>\n&gt;some, but for me it is astronomically fast.<br/>\n&gt;I am in the middle of a mental debate on whether or not<br/>\n&gt;to scrap him, sell everything, run to my druid, die and<br/>\n&gt;leave him a big inheritance.<br/>\n&gt;Anyone else run into this problem of character ping-pong?<br/>\n&gt;Things at home are also very stressed, so that isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;helping either.<br/>\n&gt;Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Cronik Khaos &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Left Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n&gt;15th Season Troll SK<br/>\n&gt;Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
