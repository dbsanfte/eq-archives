It has stats of 20 and 42, with a strength sapping spell. This is a 2 handed weapon as far as I know. However, the FIRST Paladin Holy sword is Ghoulbane, which is 1 handed and has 15 damage and 34 speed, not to mention casting Dismiss Undead. Does this seem a little unbalanced to anyone else? I am not sure that the Dark Reaver is our best weapon, but the stats I am sure of. One handed weapons are usually not that close in power to 2 handed weapons. Anyone else can clarify this issue for me?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTulwump, Troll Shadow Knight, Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
