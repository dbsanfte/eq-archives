At my level that is about 3/4 of a bubble healing and not even a scratch<br/>\nto the mob. Now at a cast time of 2.5 secs this is not a spell you want to<br/>\nbe casting when face up to a mob. Does to little damage to justify casting<br/>\nduring combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nA ranger can cast a 99dmg DD for 70 mana, and Heal for 80dmg at 60 mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats 495 dmg and 400 healing for the same mana cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe dont even wanna go to paladin healing/mana efficancy<br/>\n<br/>\nme thinks mr GZ is just snuffing his damn job and didnt really in house<br/>\nbalance test a damn thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf other hybrids get direct damage/heals that are so mana effeciant, why is<br/>\nit unbalancing if the SK get the same? Why is our armor less ac then<br/>\nrubi/ivy etc?  I mean, they can even do there heals while not in combat. We<br/>\nhave to backup, (not swinging), and cast these spells... Why is it so<br/>\nunbalancing? We are KOS everywhere. We have been on the nerfing end of<br/>\nverant since the game started. What is SO powerfull about us that we get<br/>\nthese ungodly exp  penalties, kos everywhere, BAD spells, lifetaps that cost<br/>\n3 times mana that heal a level 1 necro, and items, ermm, our new armor kinda<br/>\nsucks compared to everyone(except the paladins, lol, but at least they can<br/>\nbuff thereselves). I just dont get it. What is so tuff about a SK? Is there<br/>\nsomething I am missing?<br/>\nIt seems that for the exp penalties and KOS, we should be better in other<br/>\nareas. Paladins get the spanky swords, everyone else gets better equipment,<br/>\nevery other hybrids spells blow ours away. Hell, the warriors are getting<br/>\nbeefed up every patch, while we get these &quot;bones&quot; throwed at us, with hidden<br/>\nnerfs in them...<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for ranting/whining, but am I the only one that feels like we are<br/>\ngetting everscrewed?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
