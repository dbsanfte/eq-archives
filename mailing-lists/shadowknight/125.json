I would try<br/>\nto email Verant with a well written letter, and cross post it to the message<br/>\nboards as well as the major web pages. If all this doesn&#39;t work, it would be<br/>\nunderstandable if you went to greater length to be heard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I don&#39;t think there are any issues to be raised. I fully comprehended<br/>\nwhen it told me my character would be Hard to play, and that is half the<br/>\nchallenge of it. Sure it is a pain in the arse, but until you start to enjoy<br/>\nyour character for what it is and what it can do, you will never enjoy EQ. It<br/>\nis pointless compareing yourself to other characters and wishing you had what<br/>\nthey had. To be perfectely honest, I beleive I have no equal in combat at my<br/>\nlevel other then another SK, and i am only lvl 14. I have had this belief<br/>\nsince I was level 8 and beat the crap out of a lvl 9 monk. I still beleive I<br/>\ncan do the same against every other class.<br/>\n<br/>\nInos<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nerik lawrence antonsen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: erik lawrence antonsen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eantonse@...\">eantonse@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, it sounds like people are interested in trying something.

Have 1 day where everyone gets on and /feedbacks them either the<br/>\n&gt; same statement or a statement containing identical issues.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So how many people are on this list?
