The only think I want to say is that it better be a damn nice<br/>\nlooking shield to make me give up how my MM Shield looks (that and the MM<br/>\nshield has some nice stats as well). Also in regards to the sword, it would<br/>\nhave to have a really nice DMG/Dly ratio, due to the fact that when fighting<br/>\nin a group in L. Guk or Sol B. it comes down to how much damage you do in<br/>\nthe shortest amount of time (especially when a G. Mino decides he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike your cleric). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would like to see is a sword with identical stats to the Ghoulbane<br/>\n(just not that damn undead spell, give us a nice DD spell instead, or maybe<br/>\na nice effect like Banshee Aura???) that has kind of a black aura<br/>\nsurrounding it (I think someone else mentioned this, kind of like a black<br/>\nmist that covers us). That would look cool (Hell I gave up my Rubi legs and<br/>\nwent with Steel just because I couldn&#39;t stand how the Rubi looked).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and if you do it, make it so those of use past 30 can also get one, I<br/>\nwould hate to miss out on something just because I&#39;m too high a lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just my ramblings...<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy<br/>\n<br/>\nThom<br/>\n(Oh and kick would still be nice)..<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Brian Hook [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 21, 1999 3:35 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] SK Items<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brian Hook&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, been perusing the e-mails.
