I think our<br/>\nfriend who had it may have destroyed since he already<br/>\nhas Umbral.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have to say that in comparison, our new stuff<br/>\nstatwise isnt as good as some. But i will say we arent<br/>\nthe only ones. Ive been looking at various pieces of<br/>\nthe new armor and a lot of it isnt all that great for<br/>\nseveral of the classes.<br/>\nThough i am envious of the ranger greaves. I like AGI.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this armor came a little too late. Its too<br/>\neasy to just go buy better stuff now. If these items<br/>\nhad come out a few months ago, we would be happier. <br/>\nBut since it is so easy to get better items, that<br/>\nmakes this stuff seem worthless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cant wait to see which one of our items has Charisma<br/>\nas a stat.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
