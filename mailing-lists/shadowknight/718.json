Not too bad at all.<br/>\nThe main problem is with engulfing darkness. I may as well not have it<br/>\nmemorised since it is overriden but root ( all casters and paladins) snare<br/>\n(rangers and druids), ensnare ( those stupid ranger swords) and engulfing<br/>\ndarkness itself (a rogues SBD). so when I eliminate all the classes that<br/>\nwould interfere with one of my main spells, I am left to solo. God only<br/>\nknows why snare, a lvl 1 spell, overrides one of my main lvl 22 spells. It&#39;s<br/>\nalso a Necro lvl 8 or 12 spell I think.<br/>\nSomething has to be done to make this more effective again.<br/>\n- We can make it override the other spells, and let them get the crappy does<br/>\nnot hold message. I kinda like that one 8) given ther relative few SK&#39;s<br/>\naround this wouldn&#39;t happen to often, but no doubt the druid would start<br/>\nwhining about nerfing again.<br/>\n- We can change the whole line to some other line of spells. I don&#39;t like<br/>\nthis since I think many SK&#39;s love their darkness spells due to their dual<br/>\npurpose (dmg and slowing)<br/>\n- We can make it stack with the other spells such as snare and root. I don;t<br/>\nmind this one either but I can&#39;t see this one being impolemented.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are everyone else&#39;s thought on this problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nInosolan Braveheart<br/>\nHuman SK 43<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
