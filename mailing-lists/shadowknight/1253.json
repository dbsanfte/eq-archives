Killed like 12 drakes and 1 god so far, not seen one.  Just trying to home on it, so if you hear something let me know.  Btw the shield I received in there is ac 25 (adds 40), 5 STA and 100 hps.  Looks like a modifided cracked darkwood. I will post SS tomorrow.  Thanks guys and any info would help.<br/>\n-Metreus Del Sangre<br/>\nLevel 50 DE SK Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
