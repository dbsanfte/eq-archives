The Item could be crap, \r<br/>\nbut as long as it looks kewl, someone will pay through \r<br/>\nthe nose for it.  Personally, I would be willing to \r<br/>\ncarry the weapon around a zone for show if I had a \r<br/>\nbetter weapon, and switch to the good/better one when \r<br/>\nentering combat.\r<br/>\nAs for quests.\r<br/>\nBrian you are the one (other than Beld, and a few others \r<br/>\nI missed, sorry) that can answer this one.  You may \r<br/>\nchoose not to, or may not be allowed to, but I will give \r<br/>\nit a shot.\r<br/>\nIs there a Quest out there for SKs that will allow them \r<br/>\nto get a title similar to the Paladin Test of Truth in \r<br/>\nFreeport? I don&#39;t know about you, but I would quest to \r<br/>\nget Sir Cronik Khaos (what I want my last name to be) or \r<br/>\nLord Cronik Khaos or whatever an evil title would be as \r<br/>\npart of my character.\r<br/>\nI started a Paladin a while ago, but hated being human \r<br/>\nand dropped it. I only started it because of the tile.\r<br/>\nAnyone?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n--\r<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;\r<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer\r<br/>\n15th Season Troll SK\r<br/>\nBertoxxulous\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Chip Paul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cpaul@...\">cpaul@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;Grant Vanderhule wrote:\r<br/>\n&gt;&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;&gt; xilith, the soulfire really ISNT a very good weapon. in fact its \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>pretty\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; crappy once you get past the eye candy part. sure the stats are \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>NICE, but by\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; the time you can actually obtain one without a major twink job, \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; considering a paladin who wants it more or less has to continue \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the quest\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; through most of his paladin career, it is just complete junk when \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>set beside\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; a mithril 2h sword or a razing sword of skarlton. yes i know those \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>two\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; weapons are very difficult to obtain, but there is a big difference \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>between\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; several hours of camping and several months of active questing \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>:) which does\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; kind of confuse me.. since it is one of the hardest weapons in \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the game to\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; obtain (not to mention limited to a specific class) why is it so \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>chintzy?\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; not asking for an answer, just a not so subtle suggestion that \r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>any sk quest\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; swords be made a bit more utilitarian ;)\r<br/>\n&gt;&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;It is also a status symbol, and thus important in RP context.

Maybe I just think since\r<br/>\n&gt;they have two, so should we, but then I guess we get to share\r<br/>\n&gt;a few with warriors (Soul Leech should be SK only!)\r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;Xilith\r<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
