For","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-397609096\">I had a friend cast Shadow Vortex on me to see what it<br/>\ndoes. It lowered my AC by 7. She didnt say whether<br/>\nhers went up or not, so im not sure on that part.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor certain tactics: Darkness/fear.. great.. i use it<br/>\nall the time.. you can get several free hits in..but<br/>\nas warned before, make sure you know where he is going<br/>\nand that he doesnt have any friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also use fear when i am fighting more than one<br/>\ncreature at a time.. i cast fear on one (no<br/>\ndarkness..i want him to run far away :)  )  and hack<br/>\nat the other. the one i am beating on will either be<br/>\nclose to death or dead by the time the other one comes<br/>\nback.<br/>\n<br/>\nFear acts weird in the Arena though. it causes the<br/>\ntarget to warp. One time my friend cast it on me and i<br/>\nwarped to one of the spires. i was then hit by 633<br/>\npoints of non-melee damage then fell to my death :)<br/>\nI bugged it of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nShadow Step i have had problems with. Either it puts<br/>\nme right next to where i was, puts me thru a zone or<br/>\ndumps me into a body of water. Not to say it isnt<br/>\nhelpful, i have just had bad luck with it so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Harm Touch. When fighting anything that is magic<br/>\nhit only, be prepared to be disappointed. BUt on most<br/>\nother MOBs , depending on level, it does seem to work<br/>\nwell. Sometimes you may have to wait until the targets<br/>\nHP is below half before it will have a full effect.<br/>\nWhen i hit Broon with it (level 22ish Cyclops) to try<br/>\nand pull him off of my friend, it did a whopping 36<br/>\npoints of damage. My BBC did more in one swing than<br/>\nthe HT. Broon totally ignored me and continued to<br/>\nsmack around my friend. Eventually he turned on me,<br/>\ngiving my friend time to cast and we beat him. But HT<br/>\nwas worthless that time.<br/>\nIt can be a last resort however. Usually i do save it<br/>\nfor an emergency. And when it comes down to hit, i hit<br/>\nthe hot key and pray to Bertoxxulous. MOst times it<br/>\ngets me out of trouble. (example: goblin guard in<br/>\nrunnyeye. was the last one out of a train, he was<br/>\npounding on me. waited until he was below half, so was<br/>\ni too, then HT. He died..i didnt. without HT, i would<br/>\nhave been kibble). But this is not failsafe of course.<br/>\nI have heard some say that they use HT as soon as they<br/>\nget it. I see that as a waste. But whatever toots you<br/>\nflute.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats all for now<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
