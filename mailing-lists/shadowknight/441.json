If they won&#39;t talk to you or will KoS you, they you cannot do the quest as they will reject the items in my experience.  Therefore you cannot get the faction increase.  I have never found a way to increase faction with the guards in any of the evil race cities, only lower it.<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;hmm.. there IS a way to raise faction enough with the guild that you can <br/>\n&gt;train there, since you can get there in the first place. human SK cant even <br/>\n&gt;get past the first guards in grobb ;( <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;bring 4 bone chips at a time to the main sk guy in grobb, and he will give <br/>\n&gt;you a rusty 2h sword and some faction. while this may be a slow way for you <br/>\n&gt;to build money at your level, it DOES give the always-needed faction boosts, <br/>\n&gt;and eventually you should gain enough that they allow you to train there and <br/>\n&gt;gain quests. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Beld Demonblade <br/>\n&gt;Fennin Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
