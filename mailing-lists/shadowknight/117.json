(in general, once you get to high level<br/>\nyou will BE high level much longer than you were low level). for instance,<br/>\nat low level, warriors kick some major booty. they can solo fairly easily,<br/>\nare quite capable of dishing out damage and absorbing it too, and have a lot<br/>\nof str so they can wear heavy armor and carry a lot of loot. but once they<br/>\nget to high level, they become little more than cannon fodder to keep the<br/>\nnasties off of everybody else long enough to win the fight. on the other<br/>\nhand, a wizard is tremendously weak at low level, often unable to survive<br/>\nfor long outside a group that knows what its doing. but once you get high in<br/>\nlevel, the wizard gains godlike powers of destruction and mayhem that make<br/>\nthings scatter before them in fear. (thats the idea, anyway 8)). i think SKs<br/>\nare closer to the latter category.. remember, while paladins can heal, and<br/>\nrangers get a few modest DD spells, SK is the only class in the game that<br/>\ncan wear heavy armor and weapons AND cast significantly damaging combat<br/>\nspells once they get to high level. most people would be deathly afraid of<br/>\nsomebody in full plate with a 20 damage vampiric sword, can zap you for 501<br/>\ndamage, cast heart flutter, and teleport around and go invis when you try to<br/>\nfight back. and rightfully so :) remember, what you dont know sure can hurt<br/>\nyou!
