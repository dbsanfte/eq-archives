Also, Dark<br/>\nReavers are located in a very, very dangerous place, and I would imagine it takes a party of low-40s to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is my view of things really skewed?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that the BBC is pretty much valueless -- seems that you can get by with a Combine 2HS or SBH until you hit the level<br/>\nnecessary for BIBS.  Is there any real demand for the BBC?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried looking at the various Web pages for info on the SK quests, but they are sorted by zone, and it is much more interesting<br/>\nto me to see quests by class/race.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also interested in finding faction breakdowns, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
