I have found out recently that this isnt the case. They only<br/>\nhave medium nocks there.<br/>\nFriends had checked for me and they said that they found most of the<br/>\ncomponents. I assumed that it was Grobb that they were found in, since<br/>\nthat is one of my friends home town.<br/>\nHe will check in Oggok for me, its possible thats where they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appolgize for the misinformation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
