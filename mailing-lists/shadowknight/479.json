If you<br/>\ncan find a cleric there, even better.  There seems to be a LOT of creatures<br/>\nrunning around there.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe named orc drops the backpack that reduces weight and an idol that has 1<br/>\ncharge of divine aura, does anyone know if it will recharge itself?  The<br/>\nscalps you give to somone in HH and get exp/faction.  Unfortunatly I haven&#39;t<br/>\nkilled enough orcs and gotten a decent faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle tip, I would sit in the orc spawn and cast darkness or sap str, on<br/>\nevery orc I could.  I wouldn&#39;t get the exp, but I would get a faction hit<br/>\nfor every one.  This might have changed a little as this morning the sap<br/>\nstr, din&#39;t seem to give me the message.  something to try if you want to<br/>\nsafely go through HH.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:milamber@...\">milamber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, I was wondering what to fight when level 15?  I have been hunting<br/>\n&gt; Young Kodies, and weak Kodies in west commons but find the<br/>\n&gt; respawn rate bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for HH, I attacked some named orc just out side of hh pass, loc -500<br/>\n&gt; 4300, somewhere around their just watch out for the village, and someone<br/>\n&gt; told me that he was like killing 10 orcs in high hold pass, for<br/>\n&gt; just killing<br/>\n&gt; him.  He coned blue to me, but I was just exploring and didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have pet out,<br/>\n&gt; used HT and it didn&#39;t drop him (I figure he has about 300hp, as I<br/>\n&gt; did 303hp<br/>\n&gt; to him total), but he died none the less and me with 2 bubbles<br/>\n&gt; left.  I was<br/>\n&gt; told watch out for his friend that spawns with him on occasion.<br/>\n&gt; Oh, and he<br/>\n&gt; bashes, which I really don&#39;t like.  Plus what are you suppose to<br/>\n&gt; do with the<br/>\n&gt; orc scalp?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway anyone know where to hunt alone when you are level 15, no magic<br/>\n&gt; weapon yet, and not a whole lot of banded armor yet.  Or just<br/>\n&gt; stick to west<br/>\n&gt; commons.  Don&#39;t like mummy&#39;s because of the rabies thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Chris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roysca@...\">roysca@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 30, 1999 9:38 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [shadowknight] list and stuff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Chris&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roysca@...\">roysca@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That was a really good response Beld.  I currently play an ogre<br/>\n&gt; shadowknight<br/>\n&gt; lvl 22 on Povar.  I haven&#39;t really tried the fear and then chase to get a<br/>\n&gt; few hits in, but I definitly like the sound of it.  I normally hit with a<br/>\n&gt; darkness spell, then a str sapping spell and melee away.  My<br/>\n&gt; warrior side is<br/>\n&gt; much better than my spell casting side, so I play the tank<br/>\n&gt; mostly.  I always<br/>\n&gt; try to group with a cleric if possible.  Also, I TOTALLY agree with having<br/>\n&gt; your pet, I even try to get one when in a group.  This morning I was<br/>\n&gt; fighting in Highpass Hold (MY GOD, how many do I have to kill before I can<br/>\n&gt; go into HH :)  )  and they drop a lot of the rusty weapons.  I<br/>\n&gt; gave my pet a<br/>\n&gt; rusty mace and he was hitting in the range of 15-18.  Very nice little<br/>\n&gt; addition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have almost full bronze on finally, with a few exceptions.  I have a<br/>\n&gt; grotesque mask, and I finally got a greater zweihander (sp), which reminds<br/>\n&gt; me, i&#39;m selling a  2handed well balanced, magical axe on that server which<br/>\n&gt; normally sells for about 550 from the shady guy in the<br/>\n&gt; ecommons/nro tunnel.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m selling it for around 300 if anyone is interested.  I am also<br/>\n&gt; curious as<br/>\n&gt; to what type of armour/items other ogre sk&#39;s are wearing and any<br/>\n&gt; suggestoins<br/>\n&gt; they might have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chris/Barto.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With more than 20 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ...ONElist is home to the liveliest discussions on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
