There awful cheap when you think we have to level 9 to start <br/>\ncasting them!!!  I bought them all and was practicing them on some poor <br/>\nhelpless Froglok Tads near the bashers!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus I got to help some brand new characters against multiple Kobold&#39;s <br/>\nganging up on then, since I was in the area!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a couple of question for you experts out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n1 - Does that drain strength spell only work the once on you, ie It does or <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stack???<br/>\n<br/>\n2 - How does the Attack delay work on weapons???  I have both the Bone <br/>\nClaymore and then Big axe from Lynuga, I&#39;ve been using the Axe but I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure which is better?<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells are great especially Summon Skelly, it&#39;s actually nice to have <br/>\nsomebody to walk around with, since I solo most of the time.  I never seem <br/>\nto have players on-line at my level!! Oh well!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yea, I&#39;m on the Quellious Server, which had it&#39;s First Birthday <br/>\nYesterday, so any of you out there fancy playing a Troll Shadow Knight on a <br/>\nnew server come join me and build up quick, then we could start our own <br/>\nexclusive Guild!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJames(Goraknor the Troll)<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nPtS plc, Manor Park Avenue, Manor Park, Cheshire, WA7 1TL, UK<br/>\nVoice:   +44 (0)1928 579800<br/>\nFax  :   +44 (0)1928 579801<br/>\nEmail:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjones@...\">jjones@...</a><br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n** www.pts.com - Where e-development Comes Together</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
