He was a 18th level Halfling Druid I <br/>\nmyslef was a 17th level Dark Elf Shadowknight. He had full leather and a <br/>\nscreaming mace. I had a shiny brass halberd, Full bronze Platemail, 110 str <br/>\nafter siphoning. He rooted me and blasted me with a spell doing 37 pts a <br/>\nturn and Stinging swarm. I got the joy of casting my three spells at him <br/>\nuntil i was un rooted and harm touched him. The harm touch did HALF a bubble <br/>\nYES HALF. after he was taxed. Now at melee. My halberd was doing about one <br/>\nto twenty nine pints of damage. at one time in the duel, I did one point of <br/>\ndamage three times in a row. Also, 75% of my spells were laughed off. the <br/>\nonly good thing i did in my fight was dodge and parry quite often(helps to <br/>\nbe a dark elf fer that). Well thats about that. Rather embarrasing and <br/>\ndisheartening. In beta I played a warrior and never lost a battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
