I&#39;ve cast<br/>\nwave a few times, but again the whole AE thing is only good if you want to<br/>\nsee how much damage you can take in the shortest amount of time possible.<br/>\n(Hint: Never test it on 4 Greater Minos.

I have a 113 Int, more if my guild jeweler<br/>\ngets a little better<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion on Wave of Enfeeblement - how much does it siphon?  Is<br/>\nanyone else using this?  I have a Dark Reaver so I switched to it<br/>\ninstead of siphon and rely on the proc to raise my str.  Casting<br/>\ntime on Wave is pretty long it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saved myself with feign for the first time last night, the<br/>\ncasting time seemed reasonable to me (since I lived).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
