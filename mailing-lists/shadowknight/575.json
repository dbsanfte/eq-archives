The grobb cleaver is the one I know of. It is a great<br/>\nweapon, but you have to kill a lvl 20 NPC (he&#39;s not too tough, though ... a<br/>\nlvl 20 enchanter and I (lvl 20 at th etime) wiped the floor with him).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hukulk Helm quest gets you the, duh, Hukulk Helm. It&#39;s not bad ....<br/>\nthink it gives some +str too. It makes you lose faction with the indigo<br/>\nbrotherhood, however, so if you are not careful you will become KoS in the<br/>\ninner two parts of Neriak. A SK can do it at least once without becoming KoS<br/>\n(a warrior can&#39;t ... my friend found out the hard way) but it wouldn&#39;t hurt<br/>\nto raise your indigo brotherhood faction first (give LT caps to, umm, Narex<br/>\nV&#39;tam I think his name is. THe guy in chainmail in the warrior guild in<br/>\nNeriak commons.).<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure what other quests. I&#39;ll write more if I think of more. You can<br/>\ncheck the underground of Freeport, too, but none of those give anything<br/>\ngood.<br/>\n<br/>\nlater,<br/>\nvirten</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
