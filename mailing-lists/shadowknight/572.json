If you can find a Ranger with a Fletching <br/>\nskill of 160+ then they may be willing to make the bow <br/>\nfor you.  The only thing that would make this a pain in <br/>\nthe spleen is that the Micro Servos off clockworks are <br/>\nnow NO DROP items, and would require the maker of the <br/>\nbow to loot the creature.<br/>\nThere was 1 ranger that teamed up with a fighter to make <br/>\nthe bow and they spent 3 hours running around Ak&#39;annon <br/>\nfor the servos.  Then they sought the quest originator <br/>\nand failed many times even at 160+ skill.  It is a <br/>\ncheaper route (if the Fletcher is nice to try for free <br/>\nbecause of failure rate) than a Darkwood, but very time <br/>\nconsuming.<br/>\nI had a Ranger and was on the list.  Last I heard the <br/>\nquest needed a master fletcher, but that part was broken <br/>\nas many people with skills of 20-45 were able to make <br/>\nit. 1 person tried 40 times in a row and succeeded on <br/>\nthe 40th try at skill 32. Just pray to the random number <br/>\ngenerator.  They may have fixed that though.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant also fixed the range issue with bows.  Before <br/>\nevery bow had an effective range of 50 even if the stats <br/>\nsaid 150.  To do max damage with the bow you need to be <br/>\nalmost out of range.  The closer to the target the less <br/>\ndamage you do.<br/>\nTo max you skill in Archery is a long road.  What worked <br/>\nfor my Ranger was to stand behind a MOB already engaged <br/>\nand plink away at it.  You will NEVER do enough damage <br/>\nto kill steal and they usually like the help.  You may <br/>\nwant to ask, but I have yet to be told &quot;no I don&#39;t want <br/>\nyou to weaken this yellow MOB for me even if only by 10%&quot;<br/>\nGREEN and RED cons will not advance your skill. The <br/>\nreason for this is like a deep RED resisting a spell. <br/>\nSpelling it just won&#39;t happen.  And GREEN is always <br/>\ntrivial and will never advance any skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Rough Hickory Recurve Bow is cheap and can be made for <br/>\n3GP cost (I think) and any Ranger should be willing to <br/>\ndo this. Range is the same as a Hunting Bow, but damage <br/>\nis double. I hit for 11 damage consistantly at max range.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this was so long, but SKs need all the info they <br/>\ncan get. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik <br/>\nServant of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n6th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
