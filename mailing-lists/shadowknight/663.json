The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-855647016\">Somehow my email program burped and I lost your reply <br/>\nCountess.....<br/>\nAnyway, I can&#39;t remember what I have already sent, so I <br/>\nwill just pick a start point.<br/>\nThe last time I was in Freeport surface world was over 3 <br/>\nweeks ago. Last time I was in the Slums of the surface <br/>\nwas 2 months ago.  <br/>\nI was talking to my wife about this and when you brought <br/>\nup the 2 Opals I may have blurred 2 different topics <br/>\ntogether.<br/>\nIn the Slums of East Freeport, behind the leather <br/>\nshop/town wall, (I think I said West last time, sorry) <br/>\nmy wife said there is a Dark Elf Opal Darkbriar behind <br/>\none of the buildings, though she is not sure which one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCould you repost the Opals that you know the locations <br/>\nof? ie the HE Enchanter in Arcane Science is a <br/>\ndefinate.  Now I am fuzzy on where you said the other <br/>\nOpal is.   I don&#39;t have the thread that lead up to this, <br/>\nand can&#39;t remember if you said the 2nd Opal was a Human <br/>\nin the sewers by the other guild leaders, or if it was <br/>\nthe DE on the surface in the Slums of East Feerport. <br/>\nThere may be no 3rd Opal.  :)<br/>\nThe objet in the room I was thinking of happened at the <br/>\nsame time that my wife and I noticed 2 differant Opals <br/>\nand I may have put them together by association.  The <br/>\nobject was an incomplete vent pipe and steam in the <br/>\nupper floor of the forge house (I think Groflah&#39;s <br/>\nForge?) that was in the slum area of East Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very sorry for any wasted time you spent on my <br/>\nearlier post.  I hate Freeport anyway since my PC always <br/>\nlocks up when I enter it.  West Freeport is the worst <br/>\nbecause of the Arcane science building, followed by East <br/>\nFreeport because of the boat.  North Freeport never <br/>\nlocks me up.  The Bank in Neriak slows me down because <br/>\nof the magic guild next to it and all the spells going <br/>\noff.<br/>\nThis leads me to a new thread, coming soon to your <br/>\nmailbox. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n13th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
