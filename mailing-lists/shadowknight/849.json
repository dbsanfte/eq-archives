I have<br/>\nnoticed several small changes to certain lines of text<br/>\nwhen you speak to NPCs now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany have thought Shae to be broken because when you<br/>\nkilled her, she never dropped the note.<br/>\nBUT, if you read your instructions carefully, you are<br/>\nnever actually told to kill her. You are told to go<br/>\nfind her and you are given a phrase to say to her.<br/>\nWhich of course you wont get a response from because<br/>\nyou faction with her is horrible.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that is now. Before the patch i could trigger her<br/>\neven though she was threatening to me. She tells you<br/>\nwhat happened to the note she was carrying.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hard part is finding Dyllin when he has this part<br/>\nof the note. If you kill him in HH, he has a different<br/>\npart, NOT the one that Shae is supposed to have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus my need to know if there is a way to get him to<br/>\nspawn at the lake.
