I have<br/>\nbeen running into damage problems from creatures hitting me so hard.  I have<br/>\na complete set of leather and was thinking I needed better armor to get to a<br/>\nhigher level because they creatures keep hitting me so hard.  Maybe not now.<br/>\nAnyway now I have started Blacksmithing (up to 6 ya!) maybe I can postpone<br/>\nit for now until I get some more pp (cost is just below 1.5pp per skill<br/>\npoint so far without selling the bits).  And still haven&#39;t gotten any<br/>\nmovement/improvement out of my Archery skill.  And now looking for Fletching<br/>\nsupplies in Netrick to build my own Arrows/Bows.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes any one know where the book for Fletching is and/or the supplies are<br/>\n(found some behind the mushroom inn) or do I have to go to another city,<br/>\nhopefully evil because I am KOS anymore at Freeport, and of course the<br/>\nvendors wouldn&#39;t talk to me anyway?  Any ideas or do I have to make (don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do this) a mule character to get the items (still can&#39;t believe they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make the tools available to us at the bow shop). I have searched and<br/>\nhaven&#39;t found it, I will look again tonight, maybe I missed someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nTenin - Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
