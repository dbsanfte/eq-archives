Generally I strafe to<br/>\nthe left or right when shooting a runner. As for hitting something that is<br/>\ninbetween, I have not encountered this and don&#39;t know if it counts as a real<br/>\nattack.<br/>\n<br/>\nInos<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCountess Bathory wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Countess Bathory &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This one time i was practicing my archery and i was chasing this wolf,<br/>\n&gt; now a guard walked into the arrows path, and it said i attack Guard<br/>\n&gt; Jascen. And he proceeded to smack the heck out of me until i finally<br/>\n&gt; zoned.<br/>\n&gt; Now i checked my target and it still said the wolf.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have also noticed that when i cast fear on a creature and my pet is<br/>\n&gt; chasing it, when i fire an arrow, i dont get the hit/miss message. Its<br/>\n&gt; as if it was never reaching the target.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now heres my question,<br/>\n&gt; Do you need an unobstucted path for the arrow to hit?<br/>\n&gt; And if an NPC does get in the way, does it count as an attack, even<br/>\n&gt; though they arent targeted?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Im not complaining mind you. It actually makes sense. But i would like<br/>\n&gt; to know if this is the way it works so i can plan a strategy<br/>\n&gt; accordingly. Or was this just some weird fluke that could only happen<br/>\n&gt; to me?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Bathory<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See homepage for details.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
