BAH.<br/>\nits by far the most hilarious spell myself or any of my group buddies have<br/>\never seen :) there&#39;s something about hearing the mob you are fighting<br/>\nscreaming for help and whining about how cruel you are..<br/>\n<br/>\npets: they are not your tank. they are there to get a few extra hits in<br/>\nedgewise. and this damage adds up, especially if you give it a weapon. (i<br/>\nbelieve that animate dead and higher necro pets are able to dual wield, but<br/>\ni can&#39;t confirm this..)<br/>\n<br/>\nalso... i&#39;ve heard that some DE sk swear by quicker 1hs and piercing weapons<br/>\nrather than big slow 2hs weapons. this is because dark elves can rely on<br/>\ntheir dex and agility in a fight to be hit less often and deal max damage<br/>\nmore, while the trolls and ogres use 2hs mostly because it emphasizes their<br/>\nincredible strength that much more. me, as a human, i use both ;) also, a<br/>\ndark elf sk with a fanged skull stiletto or thulian claw and VE drains life<br/>\nat an incredible rate.. it might be something worth looking into :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeld Demonblade<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n*still stuck in hell level. does this thing ever end?* :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
