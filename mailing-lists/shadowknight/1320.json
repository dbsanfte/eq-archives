So Sabbat is the new me. Yes, I know you<br/>\nare all thrilled to death. As a side note: at 1st level 10 Stamina = 1 HP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought my Grobb Cleaver when I had my TSK and am seeking infomation from<br/>\nthose that have done the quest personally, DE xp preferred. I know the<br/>\nbasics of the quest. Kill Nerbilik in OOT and get 3 HEHE meat from Oggok,<br/>\ngive the recipe and meat (not stacked) to Carver. I also know that you can<br/>\naccidentally eat those stupid meats as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for my questions.<br/>\n1) What does Carver need to /con to recieve the Grobb Cleaver<br/>\n(indifferent/amiable/warmly)?<br/>\n2) What faction is Carver tied to?<br/>\n3) As a DE SK what faction hit do you take when you kill Nerbilik? Will<br/>\nkilling him make me KoS if I haven&#39;t raised faction first? All I could find<br/>\nwas &quot;you take a massive faction hit with trolls&quot; which doesn&#39;t tell me<br/>\ndidly.<br/>\n4) Is Lyguna tied to Troll Shaman faction?<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t killed a Froglock in a while, so I assume killing Froglocks<br/>\nincreases all Troll faction if killed in the swamp. If so I will do this to<br/>\nincrease faction in Grobb before I attempt this quest.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.- Wake up this list! The only mail I have seen is stuff I have sent and<br/>\nreplies to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nSabbat<br/>\nDE SK<br/>\n1st Tier of Hate</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
