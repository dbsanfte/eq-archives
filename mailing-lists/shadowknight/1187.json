If not, then I&#39;m not sure either choice is better.<br/>\nCronik worships Thule.  I am not entirely sure if it is racial or religious<br/>\ndifferances that prevent me from taining there. I am able to train in<br/>\nFreeport though.  I have yet to go into Oggok other than to be bound in the<br/>\nentrance.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes worshiping Bertoxx make you start in Qeynos?  I hate Freeport and would<br/>\nchoose to start in Qeynos anyday of the year. I have not done this, so I<br/>\nalso am not sure if the wandering Ranger NPCs will KoS you or not, though I<br/>\nthink they will. But it does give you access to the Karanas without all the<br/>\nhassle that a DE or Troll has.<br/>\nAs far as stats go, I think what you have in mind will work fine.<br/>\nPersonally, I would increase them both by 10. But then again I don&#39;t know<br/>\nhow much Agility affects AC after 20th either.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nAkenar &quot;Cronik&quot; Khaos &lt;Dark Omen&gt;<br/>\n15th Season TSK<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\nBertoxx<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Rich Hitz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 02, 1999 3:58 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [shadowknight] Human SK god and stats?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| From: Rich Hitz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n|<br/>\n| If you only play Trolls, be careful about creatures that attack with<br/>\npoison!<br/>\n| I had played Cronik so long that I didn&#39;t worry about poison attacks<br/>\nagainst<br/>\n| my DE Rogue because I was used to the troll regen rate for HPs.

A few questions:<br/>\n| |<br/>\n| | 1)  What is the best god for HSK?  Innoruuk or Bertox?  Which cities can<br/>\n| each enter safely without having to kill anything?  I&#39;m assuming the human<br/>\n| cities plus High Hold for both, plus Neriak for Innoruuk SK&#39;s.  Can either<br/>\n| safely enter a city on either Faydwer or Erudin?<br/>\n| |<br/>\n| | 2)  Starting stats.  I was thinking +5 Str and + 15 AGI to set each to<br/>\n90.<br/>\n| Any thoughts on what a good Str value is.  Should I bump it to 100.  How<br/>\n| heavy is medium armor?<br/>\n| |<br/>\n| | Thanks for any input.<br/>\n| |<br/>\n| | Scragg Wraithbone (22nd TSK on Bristlebane)<br/>\n| | Scregg Wraithbone (7th TSK on Mith.
