I, myself, bought a FS2HS at around 10th level for 5p.  It was a good deal, but good deals aren&#39;t twinks.  Now if someone sold me a Dark Reaver for 5p, then I&#39;d consider it a twink.  Gifts and such are not considered twinks IMHO unless you could not obtain them yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyguna gives you the Brutechopper (or other random item) through a quest.  Do not kill her, she is a nice Troll (although a bit of a heartbreaker of you ask Hulkuk).  Just talk to her, she&#39;ll tell you what she wants (a typical women, hehe).<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, don&#39;t go into Guk unless in an experience group.  It is a deathtrap, apparently designed by Verant for taking levels away from people.<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg Wraithbone of Bristlebane (22nd level TSK)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI made level 14 and am 1/2 way to 15 as of last night.  <br/>\nI have noticed that &quot;non twinked&quot; varries quite alot by <br/>\ndefinition.
