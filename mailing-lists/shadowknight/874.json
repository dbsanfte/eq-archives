The last time I<br/>\n&gt; was <br/>\n&gt; there my group was masacered after a very short<br/>\n&gt; distance.<br/>\n&gt; We didn&#39;t even kill anything except skeletons.<br/>\n&gt; Before that I was alone and only killed the 3 skeles<br/>\n&gt; at <br/>\n&gt; the entrance.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t remember seeing any faction adjustments, but<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; does anyone know for sure with these?<br/>\n&gt; Also in Befallen, do you only take a faction hit for<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; killing the Necro NPCs and initiates and named<br/>\n&gt; undead?<br/>\n&gt; I have killed 3 or 4 initiates when grouped with a <br/>\n&gt; fellow guildie.  I remember seeing a faction hit for<br/>\n&gt; The <br/>\n&gt; Dead.  Is that only with the DEs or does that<br/>\n&gt; include <br/>\n&gt; all Necros?  How do you increase faction with The<br/>\n&gt; Dead?<br/>\n&gt; This may also be why the DE Necro quest for<br/>\n&gt; Lindeal&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; Testimony didn&#39;t work for me.
