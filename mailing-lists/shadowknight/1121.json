I recently saw a picture of the Helm and<br/>\n&gt; noticed that it was not No<br/>\n&gt; Drop. So is it just this piece that doesn&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt; No Drop restriction or<br/>\n&gt; have they removed it from all pieces?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My personal opinion is that I would want all the<br/>\n&gt; pieces No Drop, that way we<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have other classes harvesting the armor and<br/>\n&gt; also it&#39;s kind of like a<br/>\n&gt; status symbol (You had to do the quest to get it).<br/>\n&gt; Of course as of yet I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t got any of the new armor (the whole camping<br/>\n&gt; Cazic thing doesn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; me too excited)..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enjoy...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thom<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
