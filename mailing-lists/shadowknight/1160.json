absolutely not, in my opinion. i tend to think most anyone <br/>\nwould agree. unfortunately, the idea that we are gods at lv50 lingers to <br/>\nthis day (most people don&#39;t even know that boil and banshee were taken from <br/>\nus, our skills cap low (bash, dodge, archery etc...), we have approx 50% <br/>\nless hp than a warrior at any given level [my TSK will have just over 1400 <br/>\nat lv50. as opposed to the 2100+ of a troll warrior.] etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nso, our penalty lingers even though our strengths don&#39;t...and...to give you <br/>\nan idea just how severe the penalty of playing a TSK is. i created a human <br/>\nmonk and a troll sk, put them both in the same zone and had them both kill <br/>\nthe EXACT same mobs (lv1 bats) the troll gained approx 60% less xp than the <br/>\nmonk each kill and continued to xp at the same -60% rate for as long as i <br/>\nplayed out the comparison (level 3).<br/>\n<br/>\ntis too bad i can&#39;t transfer all the xp from my tsk into a monk...he&#39;d <br/>\nlikely be about lv60 (after factoring in the exponential increases in xp <br/>\nreqs as levels progress) =)<br/>\n<br/>\nbrad/verant justifies this with &quot;you were told this race/class combination <br/>\nwas of HIGH DIFFICULTY in the beginning&quot;. yeah i was and that&#39;s all good, <br/>\nbut EQ is the only place i&#39;ve ever faced high difficulty without enhanced <br/>\nreward.<br/>\n<br/>\nin the end, i&#39;m happy with my character and i&#39;ll continue to play him...but <br/>\nsome explanation of exactly what about our class is so godly that we deserve <br/>\nlast place in leveling speed would be nice and likely very entertaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nkg - at least i can still solo the ghoul lord.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [shadowknight] one problem thats been bothering me<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sun, 31 Oct 1999 12:38:59 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;now, for the most part i&#39;m a &quot;happy sk&quot;. i enjoy playing the class, my<br/>\n&gt;friends seem to enjoy having me tag along, and i tend to dismiss most of <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;complains as whines or just uninformed rants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;but one comment keeps coming up that i find it hard to just dismiss <br/>\n&gt;offhand.<br/>\n&gt;that is the fact that sk, along with the other hybrids, have an experience<br/>\n&gt;penalty. and the question is, why? most sk (DE, troll, and ogre) have<br/>\n&gt;additional racial xp penalties, making them by far the slowest levelers of<br/>\n&gt;the game. but at high level, we really are not that much more powerful than<br/>\n&gt;anybody else, if at all. in fact, necromancers and druids have no<br/>\n&gt;discernable xp penalty by comparison, and, well, are incredibly powerful.<br/>\n&gt;now that warriors have had a lot of beefing, and their xp remains the <br/>\n&gt;same..<br/>\n&gt;the xp penalty does seem to make less and less sense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;an xp penalty assumes some sort of &quot;reward&quot; for reaching higher level..<br/>\n&gt;which there doesnt seem to be for the hybrid classes at this time..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;not a rant, just an observation on the ONE complaint of others that i am<br/>\n&gt;unable to readily answer :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Beld Demonblade<br/>\n&gt;Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(lvl 41, finally!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
