FINALLY!<br/>\nI got tired of running from Fire Elementals in Lavastorm <br/>\nand went to Befallen and camped Lrodd.  I noticed that <br/>\nafter killing him a few times at a yellow con, he <br/>\nstarted conning even a few times and then blue.  I guess <br/>\nthere is some anti camp code that makes him a weaker <br/>\nspawn, or it could be a set cycle. &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>\n3 very kewl things happened to me there. <br/>\nA high level shaman cast shrink on me!  That was so <br/>\nkewl. No ducking the entire time I was there, and I FLEW <br/>\nthrough everything.  <br/>\nA 34th level druid cast Regeneration on me. That was <br/>\nawesome!  I was at 1/4 bub of health after fighting <br/>\nLrodd (didn&#39;t use HT once since I was camping him :)  ) <br/>\nand I went up to full in a very short amount of time <br/>\ninstead of the 10+ minutes I normally spend healing.  It <br/>\nalso lasted through 3 more fights with Lrodd and other <br/>\nassorted denezines of Befallen.<br/>\nThat same Druid killed the Elf Skeleton (Red to me) and <br/>\ngot the Thex Mallet shaft and then gave it to me. He <br/>\nsaid he was on another quest and didn&#39;t need it. I have <br/>\nno idea if I can even comlete the quest, but I will look <br/>\nthat up shortly. Heh.<br/>\nAnyone alive out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n13th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
