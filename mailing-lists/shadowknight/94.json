(also, we dont have<br/>\nto kill the lava dragon for a darkreaver ;)) upon checking back to the guild<br/>\nperiodically i have seen a great many necro spells being imped for SK use at<br/>\nhigh level, including some of the powerful DOT spells, spirit armor, and<br/>\nexpulse undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nalso, while i admit that HT vs lay on hands isnt very fair, remember that HT<br/>\nIS rather powerful. most melee combat classes cant boast the ability to<br/>\nknock off a third or a half of their target&#39;s life with a single attack and<br/>\nstill be able to go ahead and wail away with nasty implements of pointy<br/>\ndeath. my suggestion is not to boost HT, but to TONE DOWN lay on hands. the<br/>\nability to heal that much is just not reasonable; altho i have heard of<br/>\npeople having lay on hands interrupted, while it is not possible to<br/>\ninterrupt HT that i have seen, it being instantaneous. can anyone confirm<br/>\nthe possibility of lay on hands to be interrupted?<br/>\n<br/>\nthere is a very good reason why HT can be resisted: imagine about 20 lvl 10<br/>\nsk all charge a griffin and simultaneously lay a harm touch on it, causing<br/>\nit to die instantly. now somebody is going to get a crapload of xp out of<br/>\nthat, and it&#39;d be a hideously unfair trick for us. even more lame than the<br/>\nlittle bard accelerando-run in circles-bellow thing! i admit i become quite<br/>\nannoyed seeing HT resisted or soaked altogether, but i try very hard not to<br/>\nfight things that are guaranteed to resist it when it can be helped anyway :)<br/>\n<br/>\nnow, if only they will figure out why we and paladins cant hit worth a damn,<br/>\ni think both classes are fully toe to toe with most other classes for the<br/>\nbetter part of the game. i still think it&#39;d be a bad idea to duel a lvl 50<br/>\nwizard with an SK, but the again, who COULD? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeld Demonblade &lt;- just named! :D<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
