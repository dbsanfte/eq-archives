I just thought I&#39;d add my<br/>\n2 cp worth.<br/>\nI play a Human Sk on Veeshan. Just a bub off lvl 28 now and hangin for my<br/>\nnew spells! I&#39;m still mostly in banded but quite a few magical pieces on me<br/>\nsuch as Barbed arms, grotesque mask and black crown. I carry a Bibs for 2H<br/>\nand a PGT with cracked darkwood for 1H. I&#39;ve founbd that in a small group of<br/>\nless then 3 I&#39;m better off with the 1 H since it is more of a defensive<br/>\nsetup while in a larger group dmg done is more important so I use the bibs.<br/>\nI also carry a Dragoon Dirk in my range slot foir the Dex bonus which means<br/>\nI can&#39;t carry my beloved Ashwood Bow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favourtie story would have to be when I dueled someone. The whole diel<br/>\nlasted 30 min which is more of a marathon. Using a combination of shadow<br/>\nstep and attckking I employed hit and run tactics. Eventually I succumbed<br/>\nhaving only done 127 dmg total 8( I don;t feel too bad however since the<br/>\nperson I was dueling was a lvl 38 Necro when I was just lvl 26. Imagine what<br/>\nit would have been like if we had been close in lvl! I trully beleive the SK<br/>\nare nest best duellers after the Casters and even then we can give them a<br/>\nrun for their mioney!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;&#39;s about it for me!<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep in touch!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting to you all!<br/>\n<br/>\nInos<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
