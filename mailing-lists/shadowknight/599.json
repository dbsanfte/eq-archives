Feel free to <br/>\ndelete this if you wish.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night was kewl yet slow for Cronik.  He only died <br/>\ntwice and that was not his fault, kind of.  The first <br/>\ntime was against a yellow lesser mummy.  I was really <br/>\nkicking it into the negative plane when suddenly I start <br/>\ngetting nailed by 3 other skeles!  I was not in the <br/>\naggro spawn range of the obilisk (I saw other skeles pop <br/>\nand not attack me) so I guess someone was out matched <br/>\nand trained me. That sucked since another person was <br/>\nKSing from me for 30 minutes.  I was getting really mad <br/>\nsince most of what I was attacking was green (yet giving <br/>\nxp sometimes) and blue. <br/>\nThen I see an auction for a Tentecle Whip for 25pp. Hot <br/>\ndam!  Now I have no idea what a TW is really worth, but <br/>\nI jumped on it after seeing someone here (sorry forgot <br/>\nyour name) talk about using their whip and I am very <br/>\nhappy. :)  Now I had been neglecting my 1HS since 4th <br/>\nlevel, but had a 26 in it after training at the guild. I <br/>\nwent out and fought any blue creature I could find. Last <br/>\nI remember my 1HS was at 40.  I killed 2 wisps at yellow <br/>\nand even. kewl!<br/>\nWhile getting my 1HS up I was killing kodies. On a <br/>\nyellow kodi it happened to be pretty even and was <br/>\nhovering over my Harm Touch hotkey when 2 skeles start <br/>\nhelping out. Dam. I was not able to get any Mana <br/>\nincreasing items last night and did not have Invis <br/>\nUndead up as a result.  I would have lived if I had. :(<br/>\nLast night ended with me 1/2 way to 10th.  Probably <br/>\nwould be into 10th but kodies were not plentiful, and I <br/>\ntrained my 1HS before it got too far behind to train it <br/>\neasy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also grouped with a 7th and an 8th DE trying to level <br/>\nthem up.  They weren&#39;t used to grouping and they would <br/>\nnot say where they were/loc when not in sight or that <br/>\nthey were getting attacked or how much mana they had. <br/>\n:(  Luckily no one died.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI will not fight on a mountain top anymore. When a <br/>\ncreature runs and rondomly switches direction (on a <br/>\ndime) and on mountains it sucks! Had a massive train <br/>\nwhen it came back at 1/2 health!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile running around the entrance to EC from Neriak I <br/>\nsee a 6th level Paladin running around. WTF?  I can see <br/>\na 18th level looking to pull a guard or two to the zone, <br/>\nbut a 6th level? Jeez. Never realized how easy it was to <br/>\njust wander around Neriak as a goody race. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone know what level Travis Two Tone is?<br/>\nI want to try to take him out soon. :)<br/>\nAnd those dam halflings! What level are they? The group <br/>\non the newbie side kicked my a$$ last weekend at blue. <br/>\nWhirl for 22 points and thrown back like 15 feet! <br/>\nCouldn&#39;t get in to Slam. Haven&#39;t been back since.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik <br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n9th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
