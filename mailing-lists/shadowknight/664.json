Last time I was in the Slums of the<br/>\n&gt; surface <br/>\n&gt; was 2 months ago.  <br/>\n&gt; I was talking to my wife about this and when you<br/>\n&gt; brought <br/>\n&gt; up the 2 Opals I may have blurred 2 different topics<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; together.<br/>\n&gt; In the Slums of East Freeport, behind the leather <br/>\n&gt; shop/town wall, (I think I said West last time,<br/>\n&gt; sorry) <br/>\n&gt; my wife said there is a Dark Elf Opal Darkbriar<br/>\n&gt; behind <br/>\n&gt; one of the buildings, though she is not sure which<br/>\n&gt; one.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Could you repost the Opals that you know the<br/>\n&gt; locations <br/>\n&gt; of? ie the HE Enchanter in Arcane Science is a <br/>\n&gt; definate.  Now I am fuzzy on where you said the<br/>\n&gt; other <br/>\n&gt; Opal is.   I don&#39;t have the thread that lead up to<br/>\n&gt; this, <br/>\n&gt; and can&#39;t remember if you said the 2nd Opal was a<br/>\n&gt; Human <br/>\n&gt; in the sewers by the other guild leaders, or if it<br/>\n&gt; was <br/>\n&gt; the DE on the surface in the Slums of East Feerport.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There may be no 3rd Opal.  :)<br/>\n&gt; The objet in the room I was thinking of happened at<br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; same time that my wife and I noticed 2 differant<br/>\n&gt; Opals <br/>\n&gt; and I may have put them together by association. <br/>\n&gt; The <br/>\n&gt; object was an incomplete vent pipe and steam in the <br/>\n&gt; upper floor of the forge house (I think Groflah&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; Forge?) that was in the slum area of East Freeport.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am very sorry for any wasted time you spent on my <br/>\n&gt; earlier post.  I hate Freeport anyway since my PC<br/>\n&gt; always <br/>\n&gt; locks up when I enter it.  West Freeport is the<br/>\n&gt; worst <br/>\n&gt; because of the Arcane science building, followed by<br/>\n&gt; East <br/>\n&gt; Freeport because of the boat.  North Freeport never <br/>\n&gt; locks me up.  The Bank in Neriak slows me down<br/>\n&gt; because <br/>\n&gt; of the magic guild next to it and all the spells<br/>\n&gt; going <br/>\n&gt; off.<br/>\n&gt; This leads me to a new thread, coming soon to your <br/>\n&gt; mailbox. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Left Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n&gt; 13th Season Troll SK<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
