The ability to snare with darkness, FD pull, and tank<br/>\nwith the best of them make it a awesome class. Also nice to have<br/>\ninvisibility to undead and self invis to move around. Great hybrid.  I would<br/>\nask you to consider your choice of race again. Another awesome aspect is we<br/>\nare the only class that can choose the ogre race, which gives great stats,<br/>\nand the ability to Slam.  You could still group with your &quot;goodie&quot; friends,<br/>\nhow often do you really need to enter a good city?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Matthew Studer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:matthew_studer@...\">matthew_studer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@egroups.com\">shadowknight@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 18, 2000 11:20 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [shadowknight] Digest Number 179<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi I am a Lvl 4 Human Shadowknight who worships Innorukk .. .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My friend is an Agnostic Human Mage and he is not KOS from Dark Elf<br/>\nguards.<br/>\n&gt; . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I should be at least apprehensive since he is dubious was my thinking, but<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; just wanted to know what any other human shadowknights experiences were. .<br/>\n.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I picked Human for 1 main reason, all my friends who I am playing my low<br/>\nlvl<br/>\n&gt; Shadowkngiht with are good and I thought Human would be the most welcome<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; other good cities . . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do you guys like playing a Shadowknight???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a L42 Ogre Shaman also and a L26 Necro Gnome . . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Naztek the SK<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Chocolate eggs, tulips, bunnies and more...<br/>\n&gt; Click Here<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3120/7/_/451547/_/956071336/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3120/7/_/451547/_/956071336/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
