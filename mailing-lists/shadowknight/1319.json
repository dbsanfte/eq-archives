I&#39;ve still never<br/>\nhunted there. I also won&#39;t hunt in Mistmoor because I still someday want to<br/>\nhave enuff faction to walk around freely in there. I found that there are<br/>\nsome peck NPC&#39;s in the mino caves past Meldrath that increase MM faction<br/>\npast that of the Bard&#39;s. Although they are low low green to me by now so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know If I have the patience for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hated oasis too but you will find no better xp from 13-20. (Of course<br/>\nagain this is on a Racewar server and is controlled by evils with a max of<br/>\n30 or so in the zone along the beach.<br/>\n<br/>\nalso in mid 30-mid 40 you can do spectres in oasis or Feerot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSquig</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
