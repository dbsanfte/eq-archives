She is in Mistmoore and she is a gyspy. Getting to Mistmoore is<br/>\na slight pain unless you can teleport over somewhere near there (and back).<br/>\nArlena is at least level 30. I say this because even the UNNAMED gyspy<br/>\nmusicians in Mistmoore are level 30, and they all can CHARM quite well. So,<br/>\nbe careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nDekam N&#39;Tazi may very well be in Neriak. N&#39;Tazi sounds like a dark elf name<br/>\nanyway. It was an assumption of mine he would be in Qeynos (cuz almost all<br/>\nthe quests in the west have something to do with Qeynos). If the site says<br/>\nhe&#39;s in Neriak, he&#39;s in Neriak. Come to think of it, that&#39;s actually a GOOD<br/>\nthing. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDV<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I said that was because a 23 shaman I was grouped with the other<br/>\nday told me that she was yellow to him (1 or 2 levels up) whether or not he<br/>\nwas lying is up in the air, but that&#39;s the only reason I said that. I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t seen her, and I wish someone who has could give us the real lowdown<br/>\non her.<br/>\nAnd yes it would be nice if Dekam is in Neriak, as I don&#39;t think Queynos has<br/>\nan easy to sneak into sewer system (but I know nothing about that).<br/>\nIf someone out there has done this quest please post everything you know<br/>\nabout it please hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\nIf you join ONElistï¿½s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
