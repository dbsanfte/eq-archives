(feel like i&#39;m under 21<br/>\nyrs old now :) )<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as far the fletching skill as it stands:<br/>\nFrom what i understand you have to buy them in bundles of 5 and fletch<br/>\nthem in those same bundles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is unconfirmed, but, people were noticing a drastic reduction in<br/>\nskill advancement per arrow fletched. It appears that the skill is only<br/>\nchecked once per bundle of 5 fletched, instead of 5 times (which it<br/>\nreally should be of course)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we should be able to do bundles of 5 for when we just want to<br/>\nmake a whole mess of arrows, and not care about the skill advancement.<br/>\nBut when we are trying to advance our skill, we should be able to do<br/>\none at a time to get the skill check per arrow as before. Or make it so<br/>\nthere are 5 skill checks per bundle. As it stands though, we are forced<br/>\nto do bundles of 5 only with only 1 skill check per 5. Not to mention<br/>\nthey raised the prices. Before each of the lamest components were 1Cp<br/>\neach. A bundle of 5 is now 6CP each. Not real bad, but after making<br/>\nsveral thousand arrows, it adds up. Dumb.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut i am usually full of really stupid ideas anyway, so what do i know?<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nMinions of Darkness<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
