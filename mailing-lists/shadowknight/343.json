I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t mind at all if that were so. However, I don&#39;t think that anyone who<br/>\nwants to be a master archer should be able to go spend 8cp and 3 hours and<br/>\nbecome one. If you want to be a master archer, you should have to spend as<br/>\nmuch time on it as you do any other combat skill. Why should archery be any<br/>\ndifferent? And as for professional fletchers... they still make a decent<br/>\nliving as it is. They save quite a bit on arrows over the long run, can have<br/>\nmore than 1 pt damage arrows, are the first to get the better bows, and they<br/>\nstill sell some bows for a decent amount (Spoke with someone yesterday who<br/>\nhad just sold an Ash bow for 32pp). Every other skill in this game,<br/>\nespecially combat skills, takes a lot of time and work to raise. Archery is<br/>\na very viable weapon, most people just don&#39;t have the patience to do it<br/>\nbecause at a low skill it is not very viable. You need to work on your skill<br/>\nand purchase some more powerful bows before it becomes a useful and viable<br/>\ncombat skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for archery and the auto-attack ... as far as I have found there is not.<br/>\nI have archery on a hot-key myself, and just have to switch off auto-attack<br/>\nand wait for the round time to end before using my bow. It can be a bit<br/>\nannoying, but at least the way I use the bow in a support role, this is not<br/>\ngenerally a problem. Bow&#39;s are used for pulling, for turning around and<br/>\nshooting, for chipping away at a mob while hurt in a group situation, and<br/>\nsometimes when they run. These generally do not require much auto-attack as<br/>\nnon of them last that long. Archery does go up, but only when in combat with<br/>\nexp giving creatures. The best way to get archery up is to either use your<br/>\nown friends, or find a group that will let you, and just stand off to the<br/>\nside and let fly with a shower of arrows during combat. Also, go buy a<br/>\nquiver as, especially while training, you will use arrows like they were<br/>\nwater. Good luck with your arching, it is a great skill to have if you have<br/>\nthe patience.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nJeremy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I see nothing wrong with everyone being a master archer. It would<br/>\n&gt; generate some<br/>\n&gt; much needed business for all the professional fletchers out there<br/>\n&gt; who devote<br/>\n&gt; their time and effort for the joy of it. Archery should be at<br/>\n&gt; least as viable as<br/>\n&gt; any other weapon, but it is clearly not. Archers a rare, when in<br/>\n&gt; my opinion,<br/>\n&gt; everyone that can carry a Bow should.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Inos<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jeremy Pollack wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jeremy Pollack&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpollack@...\">jpollack@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I did not declare that anything was a bug exploit, I merely<br/>\n&gt; pointed out that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these daggers are a pathetically easy way of raising your<br/>\n&gt; Archery skill. Due<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to Verant&#39;s EXCELLENT history of balancing this game, I find it<br/>\n&gt; extremely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; difficult to believe that they would put a component in the<br/>\n&gt; world that would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; allow you to raise your archery skill 5 points in 5 minutes<br/>\n&gt; when normally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; archery takes an extraordinary amount of time to raise unless you use it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; constantly. Yes, I did raise my own archery skill 5 points in 5<br/>\n&gt; minutes (it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was already at 72) while testing it to see if it worked. The ability to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; raise any skill, especially a combat one, that much in such a<br/>\n&gt; short amount<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of time must be considered a bug or something that Verant does<br/>\n&gt; not realize.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the daggers/pine needles were throwing weapons that went in<br/>\n&gt; the ranged<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapon slot and used up one each time, that would make it a little bit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better, but they are not, so for 8cp or something silly like<br/>\n&gt; that you get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this item to raise your skill to its max with one nights work<br/>\n&gt; or less. As<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for waiting to hear back from someone of authority, I agree,<br/>\n&gt; that is why I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and all my compatriots have /bug&#39;d this item. Your statement about them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using the archery skill due to the aim factor is just as much<br/>\n&gt; conjecture as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my statement, however. And by the way, the fact that they have<br/>\n&gt; such pathetic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage makes them the reason that they are that much more powerful at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; raising your archery skill.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyways, I just hope that Verant fixes this major game-balance<br/>\n&gt; problem soon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before everyone and their momma is a master archer. :) I worked long and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hard to become as good at Archery as I am, and it seems silly<br/>\n&gt; that someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can pick one of these items up and in a few hours of practice become a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; master archer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jeremy Pollack, Shadow Knight, Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Leif Smart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leifsmart@...\">leifsmart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s hard;y a bug exploits. they use the arhcrey skill due to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aim factor.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And the fact that they have such a pathetic damage. somthing like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1,  tends to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest this. I would suggest to wait to hear back from some one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in authority<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before declaring something to be a bug exploit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Inos<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy Pollack wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jeremy Pollack&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpollack@...\">jpollack@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tiny daggers and pine needles are *extremely likley*<br/>\n&gt; bugged melee<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weapons.
