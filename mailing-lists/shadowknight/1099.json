The main reason is lag. When you<br/>\nare moviing your pointer around trying to put the<br/>\nweapon back in its spot, lag can all too easily make<br/>\nyou miss the slot. And there for either pput it in a<br/>\ntrade window for another player. That 1. screws them<br/>\nup. 2. at the least forces you to hit cancel, reopen<br/>\ninventory, and then try again. Meanwhile you are<br/>\npunching for 2, 1, miss, miss, miss, etc. And thats if<br/>\nyou are even facing the battle anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr at the very worst, you miss the slot target and it<br/>\ndrops to the ground. That can get VERY messy.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that sound like i went a little overboard, but<br/>\neven if most dont see eye to eye with my specific<br/>\nreasons, i think it will still be the general<br/>\nconsensus that hand-to-hand spell is not desired.<br/>\nThere was rumor at first that thats how you activated<br/>\nVamp Embrace before they changed it. There were a<br/>\nwhole lot of unhappy SKs with that idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow dont get all weepy because i didnt agree with your<br/>\nideas. I post many that people dont agree with too.<br/>\nI just like that you are thinking about the class and<br/>\nways that it may be improved.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut i will say that you see things differently once<br/>\nyou have more levels under your belt. I came up with<br/>\nsome ideas when i first started that wouldnt have<br/>\nworked either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI still hold firmly to my idea that HT should have a<br/>\nLifeDrain effect added to it.<br/>\nSo if your HT does 14DMG , like mine did at level 39,<br/>\nthen you get that 14 drained into you.<br/>\nMy point with that VERY real illustration is that it<br/>\nwill not be too powerful because it will stll have the<br/>\nsame obsurd resist rate.<br/>\nSo its not doing more damage so all the wizards can<br/>\nstop shaking in their slippers thinking that we can<br/>\nnow steal kills from them. But at the same time add a<br/>\nvery useful function that we deserately need.<br/>\n(i know they are testing Drains on test server, but a<br/>\n45 max one will only be so useful).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway..i only have an hoour and a half til<br/>\nwork..gotts play, since the serverwide take downs last<br/>\nnight robbed me<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory D&#39;Allatu<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phreddy@...\">phreddy@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; granted i am only lvl 11, so these ideas might be<br/>\n&gt; really bad at high levels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i was thinking about Brian&#39;s comment about why they<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t change the resist rate on HT.  if 6 sks used<br/>\n&gt; HT all at once, that would be a lot of damage done<br/>\n&gt; to a mob, especially if it was a rare spawn.  what<br/>\n&gt; if HT was changed from dd to dot?  the total damage<br/>\n&gt; could be upped to 15 or 20 * lvl, and it could do<br/>\n&gt; 5*lvl dd, then the rest could be dot over 1-2<br/>\n&gt; minutes.  the resist rate could be lowered, and<br/>\n&gt; damage would be increased.  the only problem that i<br/>\n&gt; see is it would be less useful in emergency<br/>\n&gt; situations, because it would not do as much damage<br/>\n&gt; right away, and so could not kill a mob as quickly<br/>\n&gt; if you are about to die.  do people think this would<br/>\n&gt; be an improvement or a nerf?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; my other idea would be to create an sk only spell,<br/>\n&gt; that is like vampiric embrace.  it would be hand<br/>\n&gt; damage only, so no weapon.  it would be much harder<br/>\n&gt; or impossible to resist the damage, but each hit<br/>\n&gt; would take mana.  this way it could only be used for<br/>\n&gt; a little bit of time, like 1-3 min., before oom. <br/>\n&gt; would people find that useful?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; gugbug, Troll Shader Nite of the 11th season<br/>\n&gt; Povar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ich warte bis es dunkel ist<br/>\n&gt; Dann fass Ich an die nasse Haut<br/>\n&gt; Verrate Mich nicht<br/>\n&gt; Oh siehst Du nicht die Brucke brennt<br/>\n&gt; Hor auf zu schreien und wehr Dich nict<br/>\n&gt; Weil Sie sonst auseinander bricht<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get personalized e-mail and a web address or your<br/>\n&gt; own free e-mail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.networksolutions.com\">http://www.networksolutions.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
