You walk into a section of wall<br/>\nthat is indistinguishable from the rest (except you can walk through it).<br/>\nThere is a series of tunnels underneath that go throughout all three<br/>\nfreeports. It is found in East freeport. I have 2 loc&#39;s written down, don&#39;t<br/>\nremember which. (-356.70, -93.32) and (-893.84, -1253.82). It might be<br/>\neasier to find by creating a human character in freeport and following it<br/>\nout. The exit is under the docks to the south. You go down the stairs, under<br/>\nthe dock and in the corner by the fisherman you will mfind a door. Go into<br/>\nthis warehous, down the stairs and under the stairs. Under the stairs you<br/>\nwill find anot her secret door (cant be seen, just walk into the wall).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am now a level 16 Sk and have killed every orc I could (for a while in<br/>\nCrushbone and then in the commonlands). I am now able to walk the streets of<br/>\nEastern and Western Freeport unmolested (the guards con as Dubious). I was<br/>\nonly attacked by a Mage NPC by one of the zones to East Freeport. North<br/>\nFreeport (where the bank is) should be a little Dicer though as the Paladins<br/>\nlive there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSthiel<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blademaster@...\">blademaster@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blademaster@...\">blademaster@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, July 18, 1999 3:05 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] Qeynos & Freeport<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blademaster@...\">blademaster@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to the Kerra Isle quest, I have seen Dark Elves standing in the<br/>\nbank in Qeynos (with another of my characters), so it is possible.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how many gnolls you have to kill, but I am guessing quite a few.  As<br/>\nfar as the docks, that may be another matter, I haven&#39;t attempted it....<br/>\nFor Freeport, is there anyone else out there aware that in the<br/>\nsewers/aqueducts underneath Freeport that there is a group of evil charactes<br/>\ndown there, and it is possible to get some quests from them?  I have done<br/>\ntwo of them, minor things really, and was wondering if anyone else had any<br/>\nothers from below Freeport and if they were worth it?  If anyone else is<br/>\ninterested, i can give you details of what I know..... will have to dig out<br/>\nmy notes, though.
