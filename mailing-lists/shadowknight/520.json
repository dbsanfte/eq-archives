I don&#39;t know how many gnolls you have to kill, but I am guessing quite a few.  As far as the docks, that may be another matter, I haven&#39;t attempted it....\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor Freeport, is there anyone else out there aware that in the sewers/aqueducts underneath Freeport that there is a group of evil charactes down there, and it is possible to get some quests from them?  I have done two of them, minor things really, and was wondering if anyone else had any others from below Freeport and if they were worth it?  If anyone else is interested, i can give you details of what I know..... will have to dig out my notes, though.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTvar\r<br/>\nPovar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
