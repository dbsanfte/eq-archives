If you get one, consider keeping it, becuase it gives +10hp and<br/>\n+5char.  I sold one for 4pp.  If you decide to give it to the bloodsabers<br/>\nyou get a little xp and an item -- in my case it was a rusty broadsword.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe careful though when hunting them, because there is one that has killed me<br/>\n3 times already even though he conned green.  As a matter of fact he killed<br/>\nme and my buddy sk (both of us level 11 at the time) at once.  This guy (I<br/>\nforgot his name) only punches for about 8 damage but does so increadibly<br/>\nfast.  He was from the temple of life.  I have only found orders of thunder<br/>\non my victims.  Never have I seen a prayer bead.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, about finding them.  They seem to spawn randomly, but about every 10<br/>\nminutes at least.  The best place to wait is by the QH zone border, becuase<br/>\nthey spawn there and run someplace (T1 I think -- but maybe only if you are<br/>\nattacking) and back.  As far as I know they are about he only NPC&#39;s running<br/>\nthat path -- so con them from a distance and look for 2 names or whether it<br/>\nsays too far to inspect.  Note that the farther you have to chase them, they<br/>\nfarther you must go to the zone if you have to retreat.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can lure them easily, either with a spell or with an arrow, but catching<br/>\nthem and striking first with a melee weapon is very hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be quite frustrating waiting around for them so I don&#39;t do this quest<br/>\nanymore, but I still strike one down if I happen to see him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Countess Bathory &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 26, 1999 8:22 PM<br/>\nSubject: [shadowknight] Kill Paladin Quest in Qeynos<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Countess Bathory &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I received a Kill Paladin quest from a SK Guild Master in the Shrine of<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxxulous in Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt; Now we are supposed to kill the Paladins that run the path in W.<br/>\n&gt; Karanas and turn in either their Prayer Beads or House of Thunder<br/>\n&gt; Amulets.<br/>\n&gt; Now the first thing i did was kill Brother Trintle who hangs out by a<br/>\n&gt; tree in W. Karanas. When I turned in his beads, I got exp, and was then<br/>\n&gt; promptly killed by that same GM. This is when I learned that poor<br/>\n&gt; Brother Trintle was a mole for our organization inside the Temple of<br/>\n&gt; Life.<br/>\n&gt; OK<br/>\n&gt; Now, next time we were out there, we saw 2 guys beating up on Trintle.<br/>\n&gt; We killed the 2 that were trying to kill him. I tried talking to<br/>\n&gt; Trintle afterward and he still babbled about Rodcet Nife.<br/>\n&gt; I took one of the Prayer Beads to the GM, and he said &quot;Thank You&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Thats all. :(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I then killed one of the Paladins actually running, and he didnt drop<br/>\n&gt; any Beads or Amulets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question is, has anyone successfully completed this quest, and who<br/>\n&gt; did you have to kill?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Bathory<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the<br/>\nWeek!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
