If yer level 16-high 30&#39;s you will have <br/>\nsomething here to kill. A full group of 18+ can kill most anything if they <br/>\nhave enough clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get here you have to get to the freeport docks, Sail to yhe butcherblock <br/>\nmtns, Jump off the boat before the bay, best thing to do is find the road, <br/>\nget an invis and hire a guide if u dont know the way.<br/>\nAnd of course you want a bind. You will have to get to greater faydark. The <br/>\nhome of the wood elves. You can get bound right at the zone. be careful of <br/>\nwondering guards irf you get curious in that zone.<br/>\nAfter you get bound, Go back to the butcherblocks and follow the left wall. <br/>\nYou will avoid guards and get to Dagnor&#39;s cauldron. This is the zone that <br/>\ntakes you to unrest.<br/>\nNow, Run along the coastline, the zone wall is very difficult and you will <br/>\ntake lots of falling dmg. You will see a dimly blue lit tunnel about halfway <br/>\naround. This is unrest.<br/>\nUnreast is  an estate with a large mansion, a big courtyard with a 14th <br/>\ncentury style hedge maze and, a few lil tricks.<br/>\n     At low and mid teen levels, i would reccomend going on the right side <br/>\nof the estate near the gazebo. You will find Death beetles, tormented dead, <br/>\nJack o lanterns and  a few skeletons.<br/>\n    Later teens you will wnat to group and pull from the first level mansion <br/>\nand if you are in high teens and have a good FULL group, pull Carrion <br/>\nGhouls, Dry bones and lurking Mummies.<br/>\n   The things to look out for are Skeletal moinks, barbed bones, Greater <br/>\nDark Bones, Zombies of an unrest noble and MOST OF ALL, The festering hag. <br/>\nShe is a 30some level spellcaster from what i have seen. I have killed her <br/>\nbut only after she spends all her mana. at 20th level two spells from her <br/>\ncan kill me.<br/>\n  This is a great placee for loot. Many things carry small ringmail, spell <br/>\ncomponents, Platinum pieces and occasional bronze Platemail, vrey sought <br/>\nafter on this island. But unfortunaltely fer the ogers and Trolls, Its <br/>\nsmall. Well i think i gave as much info as i can.  Good luck if ya come <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got 17-20th level in a week here and am skyrocketing up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
