With the 1 dmg<br/>\narrows, I can do 14 damage to beasties. I also have an 80 skill in Archery,<br/>\nhaving practiced and practices (and practiced and practiced) till my thumbs<br/>\nbleed. Now that I have a good skill and a good bow, I find it quite<br/>\nworthwhile. But I would not reccomend it for anyone that is shy on spending<br/>\na LOT of time working on getting it up (I probably fired 3,000+ arrows in my<br/>\ntraining). My bow does almost as much damage as a mino axe, although it is<br/>\nslower (48 I think maybe 51, compared to 38 for mino axe).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for fletching ... there is nowhere on Antonica to get fletching supplies<br/>\nexcept surefall glade. The only other plalce I know to get bowyering<br/>\nsupplies is in Oggok which is not an option for humans (DE, Trolls and Ogres<br/>\nonly). Even ones that worship Innoruuk. :(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
