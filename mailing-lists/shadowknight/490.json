It is a major<br/>\n&gt; upgrade that lasts much longer and does more dmg. It does cost mroe mana<br/>\n&gt; though so you may want to keep both memed until about lvl 24 or so. That<br/>\nway<br/>\n&gt; you have that emergancy runner stopper.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Advice to people reaching lvl 22. You&#39;re Evoke skill will be next to<br/>\nnothing<br/>\n&gt; having not had a spell to do. Cast a pet and then cast Ward undead on it<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; get yuor skill up. It took me about 3 hours, but is well worth it if you<br/>\n&gt; plan to hunt undead. Also, cast Endure Cold since this will keep your<br/>\n&gt; abjeration skill up I think. I found to my horror that it is still on 55<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; me at lvl 27! What a slacker! 8)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1H vs 2H - this argument will go on until the end of time. My thought? Use<br/>\n&gt; both! Carry both types of weapon around and keep them maxed out. This will<br/>\n&gt; prepare you for all situations and also help you to find which you prefer<br/>\n&gt; using. Which is better is almost totally weapon based. 2H is generally<br/>\n&gt; better then 1H, but I would preffer a PGT to a FS 2H any day!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for HT, I too used to keep it for an emergancy, butfrmo about lvl 24<br/>\n&gt; onwards it isn&#39;t all that great so I try to comromise and use it as often<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; possible while looking for the best time to use, multiple opponents etc.<br/>\nAt<br/>\n&gt; lvl 27 , 271 dmg just isn&#39;t all that great. the max dmg I&#39;ve done in a<br/>\nround<br/>\n&gt; is 102 ( double attack 40, 48 and a Vamp for 14) so it only takes a few<br/>\n&gt; rounds to make tht sort of dmg. before lvl 24 though it is often a<br/>\n&gt; lifesaver! 8)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you get a chance to party with a rogue do it! Between your ability to<br/>\n&gt; attract monsters and their backstab you&#39;ll do well. I partied with a lvl<br/>\n27<br/>\n&gt; rogue when 24 and the mob never even looked at her despite backstabb for<br/>\n&gt; 60&#39;s +<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At lvl 20 or so when you start to get more financially well, build you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; bind wound skill. I have found this to be invaluable. I&#39;ve maxed it at 100<br/>\n&gt; which is as high as it goes. It heals about 25 or 30 HP per bandage at<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; skill which is quite nice to cut down on down time. It is good even when<br/>\n&gt; with a healer since it saves them mana and I&#39;m sure everyone&#39;s had a<br/>\nbattle<br/>\n&gt; where their whole party is under 1 bub and no one has mana and someone<br/>\nyells<br/>\n&gt; Train! 8)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That should just about do it for the moment. If anyone has any questions<br/>\n&gt; don;t hesitate to ask! we&#39;re all here to help! 8)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Inos<br/>\n&gt; lvl 27 Veeshan.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
