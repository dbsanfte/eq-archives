I think the consensus is don&#39;t take away Shadow Step, I<br/>\nlove that spell.  On the issue of making Humans and DE SKs more powerful<br/>\nwhile not overpowering Trolls and Ogres, I think more useful combat spells<br/>\nwill solve this.  If we got a lifetap and/or another stackable DOT spell,<br/>\nthe humans and DE will cast it much more because of their higher INT.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think Ogres and Trolls will be able to utilize it too many times in a<br/>\nbattle.  I just like the idea of a Shadow Knight SUCKING life out of his<br/>\nopponents.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
