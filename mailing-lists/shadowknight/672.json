You can get a BIBS at about 25, and<br/>\nusually most people trade their BIBS and about 500-700pp to upgrade to a<br/>\nZweihander. It happens a lot. As for a Dark Reaver, I got mine at 28 (paid<br/>\n1000pp, demon claw, and liz cloak for it), and most SKs 30+ will already<br/>\nhave one. The reason they aren&#39;t as expensive as you would think is<br/>\n*because* they are a class-specific weapon. When your customer base is made<br/>\nup of only SKs ranging from 20-30, you can&#39;t really charge an arm and a leg<br/>\nfor one and make the sale, ya know?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m guessing that the BBC is pretty much valueless -- seems that you can<br/>\n </span></blockquote>get by with a Combine 2HS or SBH until you hit the level<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; necessary for BIBS.  Is there any real demand for the BBC?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Back in the day, I used a BBC for a *long* time, I&#39;m talking from 18 to 28,<br/>\nI never cared much for the BIBS, and any dark elf can spare 9 Agility like<br/>\nits nothing. I don&#39;t see why the BBC is so undervalued -- if you can take<br/>\nthe Agi hit, it&#39;s better than the SBH and about the same price.<br/>\n<br/>\nDravith Vandre&#39;i<br/>\nDark Elf SK (38)<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Btw, the other guy was right, Beld *knows* his shtuff! &lt;g&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
