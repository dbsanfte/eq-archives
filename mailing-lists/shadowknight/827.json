You can be bound in Qeynos and there is a Barbarian<br/>\nmerchant that you can sell to in West Karanas.  Another good place is<br/>\nUnrest.  You can fight blue mobs in there until the cows come home, just<br/>\nstay in the back of the house area to keep away from the trains.  Some aqua<br/>\ngobs and orc camps can be solo&#39;ed outside in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron as well.  I<br/>\nnever found a merchant to sell to evils out in Faydwer though, so I would<br/>\nsell to other players at a reduced cost.  Be warned however, in both cases,<br/>\nyou will be far from any evil city bank and the coins can weigh you down<br/>\nquite a bit.  In long stays abroad, I typically use my copper to buy<br/>\nsummoned bandages and other such things that I don&#39;t really need, but it<br/>\nhelps keep my weight down.  Having a few thousand coins was not uncommon<br/>\n(but it&#39;s nice when you do return to town and bank your 30+ plat you&#39;ve<br/>\naccumulated).<br/>\n<br/>\nScragg Wraithbone of Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rich.hitz@...\">rich.hitz@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 20, 1999 10:21 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Shadowknight@onelist.com\">Shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [shadowknight] Troll SK questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere besides Commonlands Oasis and Ro would be a good<br/>\nplace for a 15th level SK to get to/adventure solo while<br/>\nlooking for a group?
