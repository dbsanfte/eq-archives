The way Beld did it was he met up with<br/>\none of my guild&#39;s clerics (Ternada) and after they cleared the necros, the<br/>\ncleric put a soothe-type spell (don&#39;t remember the cleric version&#39;s name) on<br/>\nthe UK and then Beld talked to him. Also, consider bringing along an<br/>\nenchanter to mes the necros and/or mindwipe the UK after you kill the<br/>\nnecros.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel it should be this hard to get to our quest giver, let alone<br/>\nhave him attack US. Anyway, /feedback or /petition it, I dunno. You CAN talk<br/>\nto the UK, but you definitely need some help.<br/>\n<br/>\nDravith Vandre&#39;i<br/>\n45 Dark Elven SK<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
