Unrest, right? Any idea where? In that<br/>\n&gt; basement? I&#39;ve been to unrest exactly one time but as soon as my wizzie<br/>\n&gt; friend hits 29 I&#39;m insisting that my group go there (fyi I play with a group<br/>\n&gt; of RL friends so we all play together) and kill stuff. The tail end of the<br/>\n&gt; group is a 22 cleric though so we are kinda spread out. (30 will be<br/>\n&gt; uber-hell for me as I&#39;ve promised to stop leveling for a while and help them<br/>\n&gt; catch up. :) Feign Death will be nice for that).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They are in Unrest on the Ghost, which is in the basement.
