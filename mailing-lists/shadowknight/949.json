I know that. Just wondering how reliable it is generally for guards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Gather Shadows is REALLY flaky. Maybe i just have bad<br/>\n&gt; luck, but it will wear off sometimes even before the<br/>\n&gt; spell effects are finished swirling around me. And in<br/>\n&gt; some places, its just horrible. In N Ro, oasis, and S<br/>\n&gt; Ro, im lucky if it lasts 30 seconds. Cazic Thule and<br/>\n&gt; Guk also dont treat my invis with much respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ugh. Sounds like fun. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would STRONGLY suggest against binding in Oggok.<br/>\n&gt; Ogers dont like humans regardless of the fact that we<br/>\n&gt; are SKs. And the Bouncers see thru Shadows all the<br/>\n&gt; time. Plus remember that when you hit your bind point,<br/>\n&gt; its usually after youre dead. No spells, no Invis at<br/>\n&gt; all. So if for some strange reason an Orge is near<br/>\n&gt; your Bind point, you may get stuck in a very nasty<br/>\n&gt; death/spawn/death loop. No pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah. I&#39;ve considered this. I plan on scouting out the towns a little bit to<br/>\nsee if there is a safe place ... perhaps on top of that little tower thingie<br/>\nnear the zone in Grobb? If I can get up there it should be safe from guards.<br/>\nAgain ... this will require testing. But I would gladly test it for a couple<br/>\nhours for the chance to save me a half hour run after every death.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Feign death. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, I plan on testing this and practicing this. As I said, being the<br/>\n(usually) only non-gater in my group can be troublesome when we are deep in<br/>\nguk (or heck, even trying to do the thex mallet quest in befallen and get<br/>\ntrained ... that wasn&#39;t fun. Dying from greens stinks!).<br/>\n<br/>\nlater,<br/>\njer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
