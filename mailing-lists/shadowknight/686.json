The Troll SK guild in Neriak is obviously <br/>\nInnoruuk, but I&#39;m not sure that section&#39;s code is active <br/>\nanymore.  I say thiis because the Shaman merchants that <br/>\nthe EQSS map shows in Neriak Foriegn Quarter are not <br/>\nthere anymore. <br/>\nNo one in the DE Necro/SK guildhall will give me quests <br/>\neither. They all sputter something about &quot;in the <br/>\npersence of The Dead. I shall strike you down.&quot; and then <br/>\njust stand there.<br/>\n<br/>\nPossible solution:<br/>\n1) To gain faction in Neriak give 1 bottle of Red Wine <br/>\nto the Scribe.  This gives minor XP and faction with <br/>\nguards and merchants.  Not sure about any other faction <br/>\nadjustments as I have yet to do this one. A guild member <br/>\ntold me abut it. This is like the Give the Dwarf an Ale <br/>\nto raise faction in Freeport (if I have the right <br/>\nquest... I hate Freeport!).<br/>\n2) To raise faction in Grobb with Night Keep SK guild  <br/>\ngive Hukulk 4 bone chips not stacked. Not sure what this <br/>\nwill accomplish with non-trolls. I got a rusty 2 hand <br/>\nsword and guild faction.  May try it and see.  This will <br/>\nlower faction with Da&#39;Bashers so con the guards first to <br/>\nsee how they react to you.  I have done this many times<br/>\n(over 30) and they /con apprehensively to me.  I have no <br/>\nidea what it was before though.<br/>\n3)To raise faction with Da&#39;Bashers (and lower it with <br/>\nNight Keep) give one of the leaders (no sure who) two <br/>\ntadpole flesh and an eye (I think).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now a Quest Question.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Mob drops a Ruby that Lyguna is looking to collect? <br/>\nI know the item does not say when right clicked on it <br/>\nwhat Lyguna&#39;s description is. I hear that a Necro in <br/>\nFeerot drops one. Is this correct? Any info would be <br/>\nhelpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n14th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
