Those swords can do some nice damage, but I&#39;m <br/>\nstill at a toss up point.  Right now I&#39;m using the Stilletto Bloodclaw which <br/>\nis MUCH faster.  And at level 22, with Vampiric Embrace, I have that and the <br/>\nBloodClaw effect going off a lot.  Hence the trade off.  If I go for just <br/>\nstaight Damage, I high with my 2hsword for about 47max, so I get double <br/>\nattacks of 40 and 42 quite commonly.
