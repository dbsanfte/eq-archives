(better than the<br/>\nbronze i have been sporty).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is my tale :<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter getting the key from Rathyl, go to Drelzna&#39;s<br/>\nroom. She isnt there, just 3 necros, pets and the<br/>\nUndead Knight. COOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo myself (40), another 40 SK and a 35 necro start to<br/>\nclear the necros. The Undead Knight suddenly jumps in<br/>\nand attacks our Necros pet. DOH!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he suddenly jumps on the other SK. DOH! And he<br/>\nisnt the wussie little greenie anymore either. He<br/>\ncon&#39;d white to our Necro and punches for 80s.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo i tell the necro to Gate to kill the Aggro while i<br/>\nfinish clearing the room. Meanwhile our other SK is<br/>\ntrying to zone...i dont know if he tried to Feign or<br/>\nnot, but if he did, it didnt work :(<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, since i didnt have the key, i had to wait for<br/>\nthe TT down in the jail to spawn, so he could come up<br/>\nand open the door for me so i can get to the Undead<br/>\nKnight who was very considerately guarding our friends<br/>\ncorpse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI turn in all the parts and get my boots..yipee<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Necro then sits down to med a little. A skeleton<br/>\nthat was near by gets up and attacks him. The Undead<br/>\nKnight then starts attacking me!?!?!?! First punch was<br/>\nfor 80..ouchy..almost died..zoned with 50HP..and that<br/>\nwas with all 3 of us beating on him. (Maybe he really<br/>\ndidnt care for the Heart Flutter i cast on him).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway..doesnt his sound odd to anyone else? Why would<br/>\nthe Knight turn aggro on me if the Necro was the one<br/>\nin combat with the skel.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the Drelzna room incident, i thought maybve it<br/>\nwas similar to Llrodd, where he is indifferent unless<br/>\nyou attack something, then he gets midevil on you. But<br/>\nif that was the case, then the Knight should have<br/>\nattacked the Necro and not me. It looks like he turns<br/>\nAggro..on anything thats around.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho cares you say? Well, this makes getting to him<br/>\nreally difficult. First off, even at level 40,<br/>\neverything in Drelzna&#39;s room attacks still. Which<br/>\nmeans, if he is in there, he will attack.<br/>\nWhich means we have to try to ignore something hitting<br/>\nus for 80s, while we clear the room, then either gate<br/>\nor feign. Which means only certain people can help<br/>\nyou, and they have to make sure that they dont attack<br/>\nhim, regardless of the DMG he is doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question to you all, is this:<br/>\nDoes this sound like a bug? The part of him going<br/>\nAggro on anyone instead of just the one who was<br/>\nfighting a Najena Inhabitant?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
