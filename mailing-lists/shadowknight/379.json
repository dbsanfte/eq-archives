(of course these will have to be<br/>\nobtained first, but we&#39;ll be working on it).<br/>\n<br/>\nMore info will be available after we are official. But if any are<br/>\ninterested at this point, feel free to email me, i will contact you and<br/>\ngive any info i currently have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bathory@...\">bathory@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
