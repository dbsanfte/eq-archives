Once inside, apparently, theres no prob, but the<br/>\nghouls seem to take offense for some reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough on the Dragoon part, i know that one of them is associated with<br/>\nSkelton Lrodd, so killing him may lower faction with that particular<br/>\nDragoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does seem that the Befallen inhabitants do indeed affect, at least<br/>\nsomewhat, the faction in Neriak.<br/>\n <br/>\nGuess theres no real way to know though.<br/>\n<br/>\nBathory<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; faction hits in befallen IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER affect<br/>\n&gt; faction with the<br/>\n&gt; lodge of the dead! killing things in befallen<br/>\n&gt; affects<br/>\n&gt; BefallenInhabitants, while the lodge is only<br/>\n&gt; affected by things that<br/>\n&gt; change faction with TheDead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Beld Demonblade<br/>\n&gt; Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Looking for a new hobby?
