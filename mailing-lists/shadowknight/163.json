I also don&#39;t doubt that<br/>\n&gt; eventually SK&#39;s will be powered up a little.  You played a human...a<br/>\n&gt; little stronger but limited magically.  Maybe if you tried a different<br/>\n&gt; race you might have found more satisfaction.  I can&#39;t express how much I<br/>\n&gt; love being a DE SK.  Not only for the evil nature I get to play...but also<br/>\n&gt; the fact that when I get spells...i will get alot...not to mention that<br/>\n&gt; your training and weapon skills have alot to do with how well your<br/>\n&gt; character does.  Just because the SK isn&#39;t the most powerfull<br/>\n&gt; class...doesn&#39;t mean its a bad class.  You played one race up to<br/>\n&gt; 10....thats hardly anywhere in the world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Korm<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Grow your list the most and receive a $5000 donation<br/>\n&gt; to the charity of your choice.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See our homepage for details on our new ONEreach incentive programs.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
