This is a downtime reducer at worst, and depending on<br/>\nhow long the casting time is, this may be able to be cast between swings.<br/>\nPlus, this will be great for those times when you get your butt kicked to<br/>\nthe point where you just have to back of fight your group&#39;s in.  This is<br/>\nalso something that the smaller race SKs can do with their mana that us<br/>\nlarge will not be able to do as much.  At level 33 my mana will be closer to<br/>\n450 with my troll.  That extra about 250 mana of a DE equals 4 45 point<br/>\nlifetaps.<br/>\n<br/>\nBazkak Gakaz<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Chip Paul<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSent: 10/22/99 4:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [shadowknight] Thank you Brian!

Being <br/>\nable to use all my mana for more than half my hit points at level 33<br/>\nis not a bad thing in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how you can complain about this.  Sure, we could probably<br/>\npick out better spells, but this is definately an improvement.  If<br/>\nI&#39;m soloing, I can use these to half my downtime, or as a healing<br/>\nboost once a mob is snared and running (in place) at the end of a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my math on this for my Level 33 DE SK:<br/>\nHP:  845<br/>\nMana:  700<br/>\nLifeDraw:  45 Hps for 63 Mana<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I can cast 11 lifedraws at FM, which is 495 HP.  Granted, <br/>\nthat&#39;s an ideal scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that not enough healing for a damage oriented class?<br/>\nNo hybrid will get bind or gate, so what other rank 1,2, and 4 spells <br/>\ncould they have given us?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes down to it, I have an option I never had before, and<br/>\nthat I cannot complain about.<br/>\n<br/>\nXilith<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
