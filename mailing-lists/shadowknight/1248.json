Every monk<br/>\npresent sent in a /Petition about the FD nerf and wanting it changed back.<br/>\nThe admins probably went nuts seeing 290 /petitions light up the screens all<br/>\nat once!  Then Smedley came on and said they would look at FD again. The<br/>\ngathering also crashed the zone once. Heh, just like a GM event, only the<br/>\nPlayers had control. There were also close to 3000 people on Fennin Ro that<br/>\nnight as well. This may have come close to server capasity, and sent a<br/>\n&quot;WTF?&quot; thought through quite a few heads.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminds me. If you really want to get Verant&#39;s attention for SK nerfs<br/>\nand issues, people from all servers need to meet at one server like the<br/>\nmonks did. That got Verant&#39;s attention better than one person petitioning or<br/>\n/feedback over and over because it involved realtime resources (the 290<br/>\n/petitions, and crashing the zone) that caused alot of headaches for the<br/>\nVerant staff. Send them an email with alot of signitures and they notice it<br/>\nand pass it up.  Crash the zone and alarms go off all the way to the top.<br/>\nEvery manager, team lead, and VP will want to know everything about the<br/>\nincident, and will want it fixed as fast as possible. Their jobs depend on<br/>\nit. You want a change and to have Verant look at it now? Get organized, and<br/>\ndo it on Fennin Ro. Fennin Ro is their biggest server and will give them the<br/>\nbiggest headache.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I will get off my soap box now.<br/>\n<br/>\nFormerly<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik Khaos &lt;Dark Omen&gt;<br/>\n16th Season TSK<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tony Donatelli [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:donatea@...\">donatea@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 23, 1999 5:12 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [shadowknight] Another Feign Death post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tony Donatelli&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:donatea@...\">donatea@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; did you actually use feign before the patch?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; you couldn&#39;t possibly have - and believe that this new fd system is &quot;more&quot;<br/>\n&gt; predictable...or even predictable at all (compared to the previous<br/>\n </span></blockquote>system).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i for one KNOW how fd worked before (the verant posted is complete bs, a<br/>\n&gt; blatant lie) and i know how it works now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course I used FD before the patch. I pull better than most monks, and I&#39;m<br/>\njust an SK. I was trained by a monk (THE premiere monk on Fennin) and I know<br/>\nhow to feign, believe me. My point was not whether the new FD was better or<br/>\nworse, I refuse to go down that road. I&#39;m telling you how it is NOW, after<br/>\nthe fact. You can use that information or you can bitch and moan. I was<br/>\ntrying to give you some advice on how the new FD is best used, even in its<br/>\n&quot;nerfed&quot; state, and you insult me. I guess I&#39;ll just go back to lurking on<br/>\nthe list, sorry to post.<br/>\n<br/>\nDravith<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
