To raise skills quickly you must attempt harder stuff.<br/>\nRunning around killing greens will get your skill up eventually but really<br/>\nslowly. To progress steadily attack blues, and to go fast attack yellows and<br/>\nabove. How? Given your crap at the skill and won&#39;t last long against yellows?<br/>\nKill Steal!! :) Seriously though, when you see othe people attack targets ask<br/>\nthem if they mind you attacking it to practice your skills. this will allow you<br/>\nto practice against the harder targets with relative safety. Most people won&#39;t<br/>\nmind since you wont do much damage, but you do get the occasionaly jerks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopw this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nInos<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShanti Ashtangi wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Shanti Ashtangi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zealpath@...\">zealpath@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a level 11 dark elf shadowknight, and while I love the 1H mino<br/>\n&gt; axe/shield combo, I&#39;m also interested in using 2H weapons, especially if the<br/>\n&gt; Dark Reaver turns out to be a 2H weapons. Howver I&#39;ve picked up a 2H sword<br/>\n&gt; and only managed to raise the skill to 5, now it won&#39;t move at all (and<br/>\n&gt; has&#39;t been for quite some time). Do I need to fight monsters that con blue<br/>\n&gt; or something like that? Those of you who have successfully raised 2H please<br/>\n&gt; let me know how you&#39;ve done it, although I suppose I&#39;ll always favor 1H<br/>\n&gt; since I&#39;l need a shield to bash as a dark elf.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
