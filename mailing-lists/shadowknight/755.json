The reason the high level shields and DoTs were pulled<br/>\nis because (believe it or not) a lot of the players here are SKs and as such<br/>\nknow the class real well and giving them those capabilities made them into,<br/>\nliterally, tank mages.  It&#39;s a scary sight seeing these guys at work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve stated before, the thing that hurts the SK class are primarily race<br/>\nissues -- a damage shield on a human or DE SK is not unbalancing, however it<br/>\nIS unbalanced if you put it on a troll or ogre SK.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what can be changed that makes the class more viable for non-big-races<br/>\nbut at the same time is not unbalancing for trolls/ogres?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know HT comes up a lot, but there is a fear that HT could end up being<br/>\nheavily abused (worst nightmare....party of 6 50th level SKs stand around<br/>\nMr. Named Mob that only pops once a day anyway, BAM 3000HP gone instantly<br/>\nand you now have a mob that starts the fight at 1/2 HP).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf HT was upped slightly, had a slightly higher recharge rate, etc...what<br/>\nare your suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
