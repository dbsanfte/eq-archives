(i guess someone will say this can be<br/>\n&gt; reported under verant&#39;s new &quot;play nice rules&quot; but the last time i<br/>\n&gt; reported/petition anything the response took well over 4 hours to arrive<br/>\n&gt; with the end effect being 0 due to the guide&#39;s apprectice status.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; kg<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; btw - to add to the frustration of an idiotic change like this. anyone<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; complete the quests...ranger, bard, wood elf, human...so, now you have not<br/>\n&gt; only the threat of high level farmers but mid level quest sploiters who<br/>\nhunt<br/>\n&gt; the TR or auction for spare decayed so that they (a human ranger for<br/>\n&gt; instance) can grab a gate to Fay and make 1/2 bubble or more xp for every<br/>\n&gt; piece they complete.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; why should a non sk be able to start or complete a quest for an sk ONLY<br/>\n&gt; item? (i know i already answered this with my own hypothesis but it would<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; nice to see what everyone else thinks. especially a verantite if they<br/>\nhappen<br/>\n&gt; to read this.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Countess Bathory D&#39;Allatu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:countess_bathory_69@...\">countess_bathory_69@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [shadowknight] The madness has begun...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 1 Nov 1999 18:50:02 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The other day a level 14 warrior messaged me and tried<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to get me to buy a DF Helm.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Need i say more?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;=====<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n&gt; -=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
