Due to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-67062146\">I did not declare that anything was a bug exploit, I merely pointed out that<br/>\nthese daggers are a pathetically easy way of raising your Archery skill. Due<br/>\nto Verant&#39;s EXCELLENT history of balancing this game, I find it extremely<br/>\ndifficult to believe that they would put a component in the world that would<br/>\nallow you to raise your archery skill 5 points in 5 minutes when normally<br/>\narchery takes an extraordinary amount of time to raise unless you use it<br/>\nconstantly. Yes, I did raise my own archery skill 5 points in 5 minutes (it<br/>\nwas already at 72) while testing it to see if it worked. The ability to<br/>\nraise any skill, especially a combat one, that much in such a short amount<br/>\nof time must be considered a bug or something that Verant does not realize.<br/>\nIf the daggers/pine needles were throwing weapons that went in the ranged<br/>\nweapon slot and used up one each time, that would make it a little bit<br/>\nbetter, but they are not, so for 8cp or something silly like that you get<br/>\nthis item to raise your skill to its max with one nights work or less. As<br/>\nfor waiting to hear back from someone of authority, I agree, that is why I<br/>\nand all my compatriots have /bug&#39;d this item. Your statement about them<br/>\nusing the archery skill due to the aim factor is just as much conjecture as<br/>\nmy statement, however. And by the way, the fact that they have such pathetic<br/>\ndamage makes them the reason that they are that much more powerful at<br/>\nraising your archery skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I just hope that Verant fixes this major game-balance problem soon<br/>\nbefore everyone and their momma is a master archer. :) I worked long and<br/>\nhard to become as good at Archery as I am, and it seems silly that someone<br/>\ncan pick one of these items up and in a few hours of practice become a<br/>\nmaster archer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nJeremy Pollack, Shadow Knight, Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Leif Smart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leifsmart@...\">leifsmart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s hard;y a bug exploits. they use the arhcrey skill due to the<br/>\n&gt; aim factor.<br/>\n&gt; And the fact that they have such a pathetic damage. somthing like<br/>\n&gt; 1,  tends to<br/>\n&gt; suggest this.

I have seen them and tested them just enough to make<br/>\n&gt; sure they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually bugged, and then I have /bug&#39;d them and continued on<br/>\n&gt; my way. They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are melee weapons and help in the melee slot, there is<br/>\n&gt; absolutely no reason<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they should help out your archery skill.
