The last time I was <br/>\nthere my group was masacered after a very short distance.<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t even kill anything except skeletons.<br/>\nBefore that I was alone and only killed the 3 skeles at <br/>\nthe entrance.<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember seeing any faction adjustments, but <br/>\ndoes anyone know for sure with these?<br/>\nAlso in Befallen, do you only take a faction hit for <br/>\nkilling the Necro NPCs and initiates and named undead?<br/>\nI have killed 3 or 4 initiates when grouped with a <br/>\nfellow guildie.  I remember seeing a faction hit for The <br/>\nDead.  Is that only with the DEs or does that include <br/>\nall Necros?  How do you increase faction with The Dead?<br/>\nThis may also be why the DE Necro quest for Lindeal&#39;s <br/>\nTestimony didn&#39;t work for me.
