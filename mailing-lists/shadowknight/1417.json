I just can&#39;t <br/>\nseem to find anywhere that is really intersting (or find a good grp <br/>\nthere).  I tried Karnor&#39;s recently but that place is a mess (and you <br/>\nget bad Venril Sathir (sp) faction (the outpost in OT))  so that was <br/>\nno good.  Many of the higher levels are either overcrowded or there&#39;s <br/>\njust no-one there.  I solo a lot so I was wondering if anyone knew of <br/>\nanywhere good.  my Velious faction is with the giants (Ally, Warm and <br/>\ndumbarse Tormax still scowels, which would be nice to get some help <br/>\nw/).  I dunno, any ideas?  Have all my DF armor etc, so there a very <br/>\nfew quests to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBored Ogre SK of Morell Thule<br/>\n<br/>\nFluxurak<br/>\n<br/>\nLong live the Warlord Rallos Zek <br/>\n(I&#39;m less evil, more into entropy and assisting it along =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
