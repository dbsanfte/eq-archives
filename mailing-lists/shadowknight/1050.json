But how many pieces of decaying do you ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1264037480\">Through a 6 hour period we killed about 8 Crusaders.<br/>\nNot bad. We&#39;ve spent much more time there and have<br/>\nkilled less. But how many pieces of decaying do you<br/>\nthink were dropped? one. 6 hours, 8 Crusaders one<br/>\ndrop.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut thats not even the best part. Now sit back and<br/>\nlisten to my tale.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are on our 3rd or 4th Crusader. KIll him. Loot.<br/>\nNothing again. Damnit.<br/>\nOur rogue says &quot;I got it!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;ummm..you got what?&quot;<br/>\nrogue, &quot;a BP!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;WHAT!?!?!&quot;<br/>\nrogue, &quot;a decaying BP&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nmuch swearing and cursing ensues.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;its NO DROP&quot;<br/>\nrogue,&quot;oh, damnit&quot;<br/>\n&quot;why do you think we were the only ones looting them?&quot;<br/>\nrogue,&quot;i didnt loot it. I pickpocketed it&quot;<br/>\n&quot;WHAT!?!?!&quot; &quot;i thought rogues pickpocket from a<br/>\ndifferent pool than the loot one&quot;<br/>\nrogue, &quot;different pool for cash, but not items. But<br/>\nthose items are supposed to be inaccessible&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now we have a rogue who pickpocketed our SK only NO<br/>\nDROP item.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend petitions. Rogue petitions.<br/>\nBoth end up talking to a guide since no real GM is on.<br/>\nShe &quot;can&#39;t&quot; do anything about it.<br/>\nThe rogue puts up a good fight though.She does feel<br/>\nreal bad about it. She goes thru how bad this<br/>\nknowledge would be if it got spread to the public. <br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it. How many people would want rogues<br/>\naround at all if they thought they might pickpocket<br/>\nthe quest items that they need?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guide started to see the resoning. However still<br/>\nno BP for us. Even the suggestion of creating a<br/>\ndynamic character and letting one of us loot the BP<br/>\nfrom him wasnt accepted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thats how we left it.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 or 4 Crusaders later with no decaying and both of us<br/>\nSKs were just too ticked to keep playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe moral of the story..ummm..there isnt one i dont<br/>\nthink..but do yourself a favor and make sure you tell<br/>\nany rigue you are grouped with to NOT pickpocket the<br/>\nCrusaders or you will be added a sequel to my little<br/>\nadventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow let me say this. The BP isnt all that great and i<br/>\nwouldnt wear it anyway. But i would still like to do<br/>\nthe quest if i happen to end up with the items. <br/>\nBut more importantly, this could have just as easily<br/>\nbeen an item i needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd i did a nice little FEEDBACK right before i logged<br/>\nletting &quot;them&quot; know how lame and pathetic this<br/>\nso-called &quot;quest&quot; is.<br/>\nAnd i dont consider this a quest. Sitting in CT<br/>\nwaiting for the same MOB over and over is camping, not<br/>\nquesting.<br/>\nThere was obviously no thought process put into this<br/>\nat all.<br/>\nAnd has anyone found a weapon quest for SKs yet?<br/>\nThroughout the different sites i have noticed that<br/>\nquite a few classes have had weapon quests put in with<br/>\nthe last patch. Just wondering if we got the same<br/>\nconsideration *snicker*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thats my rant for today.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy kiddies<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
