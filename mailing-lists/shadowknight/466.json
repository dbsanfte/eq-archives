Though it is debateable about <br/>\nits toughness to play.  The erudite necromancer is probably the most <br/>\ndifficult class to play.  I dunno about what other classes to play, but I <br/>\nthink that trolls are pretty nice.  They are extremely easy during their <br/>\nfirst 7 levels then it slows down to vast degrees.  They do become arguably <br/>\nmore powerful than the others because they can do more damage on average.  I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t stress this, but I recommend troll.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, shadowknight pets don&#39;t suck!! :P<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [shadowknight] shadowknight races<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sun, 20 Jun 1999 23:32:24 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Grant Vanderhule &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vandergm@...\">vandergm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;actually.. human sk is NOT easy. in fact, it is probably THE single hardest<br/>\n&gt;class/race combo in the game.. and if you are a worshipper of toxxy.. talk<br/>\n&gt;about hard times :) at least the qeynos SK guild kicks ass..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;the reason for this is that our stats are mediocre, and despite whatever<br/>\n&gt;info is out there our faction is NOT significantly better anywhere than the<br/>\n&gt;other SK races. human SK can still only get into 3 towns (freeport, qeynos,<br/>\n&gt;and neriak), which is par for SK of any race. really our main advantages is<br/>\n&gt;that we are physically a bit stronger than dark elves, are more agile and<br/>\n&gt;intelligent than ogres and trolls, and we have one of the highest charisma<br/>\n&gt;ratings in the game (buying things cheap is a definite plus).  with all my<br/>\n&gt;jeweller buddy&#39;s special equipment, i can get cha over 100 ;) if you want <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;make a first-time sk, be a troll. your xp gains will really suck (penalty<br/>\n&gt;for combo class AND penalty for large race) but the hp regen REALLY helps<br/>\n&gt;you, as well as your mighty trollish strength. plus trolls have some of the<br/>\n&gt;best SK quests that WORK at the moment.  so basically, be a troll unless <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;seek even greater challenge :) just my 2 pesos<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Beld Demonblade<br/>\n&gt;Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Last chance to earn $5000 for your charity of choice!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Deadline for &quot;GROW TO GIVE&quot; is June 19.
