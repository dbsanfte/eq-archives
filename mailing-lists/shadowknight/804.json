I have multiple characters, <br/>\njust like everyone else here I&#39;m sure.  But there&#39;s one thing I noticed <br/>\nabout my Wizard.  She can got to ANY guild (except the DE one) to go and <br/>\ntrain.  Which is great.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my DE SK, I can only train in my home town and with the Human guilds <br/>\n(ie Freeport and Qeynos).  The SK&#39;s in Grobb and Ogguk won&#39;t even talk to <br/>\nme.  That cuts down half my training options there almost (I never go out to <br/>\nQeynos with a DE SK).  Some people might see where this is going.  To <br/>\nBalance things, why not make some of the SK spells race specific.  IF hunans <br/>\nand DE&#39;s share the same traits, give them a damage shield, and give the <br/>\nogres and trolls something else.  I don&#39;t care what anyone else says, but <br/>\nthis game was not meant to be a soloing game.  Go play bard&#39;s tale if you <br/>\nwant to solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nHence if there are going to be training restrictions, I think that variation <br/>\nbetween the training houses would be a good thing.  And make sure that mask <br/>\nof the deceiver can&#39;t be used to get around this!  (I hate that mask with a <br/>\npassion).  If anything it should turn people into little halfling druids.  <br/>\nNow there&#39;s the REAL evil class! &lt;GRiN&gt; just kidding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brian Hook&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bhook@...\">bhook@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkie dokie, seems like getting a consensus is NOT going to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo let&#39;s try another approach: what WOULD you like to see about the class to<br/>\nmake it more viable?  The reason the high level shields and DoTs were pulled<br/>\nis because (believe it or not) a lot of the players here are SKs and as such<br/>\nknow the class real well and giving them those capabilities made them into,<br/>\nliterally, tank mages.  It&#39;s a scary sight seeing these guys at work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve stated before, the thing that hurts the SK class are primarily race<br/>\nissues -- a damage shield on a human or DE SK is not unbalancing, however it<br/>\nIS unbalanced if you put it on a troll or ogre SK.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what can be changed that makes the class more viable for non-big-races<br/>\nbut at the same time is not unbalancing for trolls/ogres?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know HT comes up a lot, but there is a fear that HT could end up being<br/>\nheavily abused (worst nightmare....party of 6 50th level SKs stand around<br/>\nMr. Named Mob that only pops once a day anyway, BAM 3000HP gone instantly<br/>\nand you now have a mob that starts the fight at 1/2 HP).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf HT was upped slightly, had a slightly higher recharge rate, etc...what<br/>\nare your suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
