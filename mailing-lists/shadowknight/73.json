Yes the sewers are a virtual maze.  I have ventured there many times because the shadowknight guild is in there.  I still find myself getting lost.  There are many water tunnels in there and I have found one exit that leads to the bay under the dock.  But I think it is just one way, if you go in that way you teleport to the pier.  However, there are numerous entrances to the sewer in the city.  One is under the arena, others are found by swimming to the bottom of ponds and fountains.   I suppose you could take one of these and try to find the one exit that leads to a secret door on the outer wall in North Qeynos.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mammoths you may be trying to hunt are all over South Karana, about 20 minutes from Qeynos.<br/>\nYou go north to Qeynos Hills, east through the mountain pass to west karana, east until you come to the river in that zone and take a left until you come to north karana.  Follow the river until you come to a large stone bridge with guards.  That goes to south karana.  I can only guess what level the mammoths are as they conned red to me when I was level 11.  They are probably really high.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaron</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
