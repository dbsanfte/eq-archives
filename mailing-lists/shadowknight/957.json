Why is our Bind Wound capped at<br/>\n100? I didn&#39;t even thing about this till yesterday when a Monk friend of<br/>\nmine happen to use the skill on me. Healed me for over twice what I could<br/>\nhave done. So I started asking around, hell a mage I group with has a higher<br/>\nbind skill then I do. Does anybody know what the other hybrids cap at? I<br/>\nwould have thought that since the other hybrids get some type of heal they<br/>\nwould cap lower and we would cap higher (200 would be nice). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway just a thought..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
