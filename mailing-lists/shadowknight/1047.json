(I hear that weapon skills cap at <br/>\n200 (ie level 39).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is this, since we&#39;re based on Warriors and Necros, why don&#39;t we <br/>\never get Dual Wield?  Some people say that we&#39;re the Anti-Paladin, but other <br/>\nthen HT, I see no other real opposites (and as to why paladains don&#39;t get it <br/>\neither, I don&#39;t know).  I understand why paladins don&#39;t get kick, but since <br/>\nwe&#39;re the evil opposite you figure we would.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Warriors, Rangers, Rogues, Bards, Monks ALL get dual wield.  Why don&#39;t <br/>\nSK&#39;s?  Now I&#39;m curious.  Paladins get awesome 1h slash weapons, and it would <br/>\nbe WAY too powerful for them to wield 2 weapons with a ghoul bane and some <br/>\nother combo.  But SK&#39;s never do get anything like that.  So why can&#39;t we <br/>\nhave something nice to play with like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nPrincess Xaera<br/>\nDark Princess of Hate</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
