Being a big dumb troll,<br/>\nit looks like you may have to wait until lvl 11 though. You either get more<br/>\nmana or things begin to cost less as your skill gets up, though. At the<br/>\nbeginning of lvl 9 my DE SK couldn&#39;t cast his pet, but after channeling and<br/>\n... conjuration? whatever the pet skill is, got maxed near the end of the<br/>\nlevel, then suddenly he could cast it at lvl 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for intelligence vs mana stuff ... your point is valid for the time, but<br/>\nonce you get a few more levels, well, you&#39;ll first off get a larger mana<br/>\namount per int point of course, plus you&#39;ll find that there are less and<br/>\nless pure mana bonuses, at least that aren&#39;t for pure casters. I would<br/>\nrather have dexterity bracers than and extra ten mana and HP at lvl 23.<br/>\n<br/>\nDexterity is also a good one to get up. As a troll, yours may be hopelessly<br/>\nlow already, but mine was a 75, now it is around an 85 or 90. My bloodclaw<br/>\nprocs a TON now, and I love it. In a duel the other day, it proc&#39;d *6*<br/>\ntimes, a total of 300 dmg just from the proc (probably a bit less since 30<br/>\nof it is a DoT that probably doesn&#39;t stack on itself). This was against a<br/>\nlvl 23 (I was 22 at the time) SK wielding a 2hs weapon and we didn&#39;t use<br/>\nspells or PvP tactics (it was just a straight up fight).<br/>\n<br/>\nback to work,<br/>\n<br/>\nlater,<br/>\nVirten, SK of Neriak, 23rd circle of hate</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
