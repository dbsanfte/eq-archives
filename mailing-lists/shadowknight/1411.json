Now she is looked on by most to be evil...yet..would<br/>\nshe not have a different view of herself?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould she believe herself, her race, and God are not the evil ones?<br/>\nHow can that really be roll-played..and remember this is a total<br/>\nnewbie to role-playing here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have other characters..but seem to find my little Sk the hardest to<br/>\nfigure out :(<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?
