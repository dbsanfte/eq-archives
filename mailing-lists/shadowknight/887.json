They are all or very nearly all casters (clerics and druids<br/>\netc) and this is a hard place to run because of all the hills (trust me,<br/>\nI&#39;ve fallen to my death here running from these schmose). I&#39;m 26 now and<br/>\nthey almost killed me yesterday when I was walking and not paying attention<br/>\nand passed the exit (easy to do in the Cauldron). I would be wary of these<br/>\npeople still with a full group but it is probably possible ...<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a better estimate of when it is safe to wipe these folks out,<br/>\nPrincess? They are blue at 26, I think they were white and yellow around 19<br/>\nbut I can&#39;t remember for sure (it&#39;s been a long time since I was 19).<br/>\n--<br/>\n-=The Shadow Knight Mailing List=-<br/>\n-=   Support Evil Roleplaying   =-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
