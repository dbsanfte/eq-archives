A new 1HS weapon, just wonderful.

We decided maybe a 1hander around<br/>\n&gt; 12dmg 36dly and an effect of poison bolt or a weak<br/>\n&gt; lifetap i dunno thats up to you. its basically<br/>\n&gt; supposed to be like  a ghoulbane.  You could even make<br/>\n&gt; it human and de only if you like. This would help us<br/>\n&gt; because now we can carry a shield and have a decent<br/>\n&gt; 1hander instead of always having to carry a 2hander<br/>\n&gt; and lose the ability to bash which the large races do<br/>\n&gt; not....let me know what you think<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A new 1HS weapon, just wonderful. As if carrying around the Dark Reaver and<br/>\nFleshripper weren&#39;t enough, now you want the SMALL guys to lug around a 1H<br/>\nsword AND a shield too. Yay. My Str is only 97, and even with an EE Bag,<br/>\nthat stuff is still heavy. Not to mention a whole &#39;nother skill to keep up<br/>\nwith, ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter options:<br/>\n1.) Give us kick. Humans and Dark Elves will use it, large races won&#39;t<br/>\n(because they have slam). Also fits into the image of SKs being mean,<br/>\nunder-handed, intense damage-dealing tanks.<br/>\n2.) Give us spells (like Banshee Aura) that are human/de only. Larges can<br/>\noutsource to druids/mages for their damshields.<br/>\n3.) Make some new human/de only items (not necessarily weapons). The easiest<br/>\nway to do this is just make some new SK armor that is medium-sized, the<br/>\nlarges just can&#39;t wear em, but the human/de SKs can.<br/>\n<br/>\nDravith Vandre&#39;i</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
