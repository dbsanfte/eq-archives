I love the sound it makes when <br/>\nyou level!<br/>\nFrom 5th - 10th I have remained exclusively in Neriak <br/>\nand Nektulos Forrest.  Needless to say I am now bored <br/>\nwith skeles and wandering the zone looking for kodies.  <br/>\nGranted, it is a very safe place for me to wander in <br/>\nnow. :)  Any suggestions on new hunting grounds for a <br/>\nsolo 10th level SK? I lag VERY badly in Freeport and <br/>\nGreater Fey, too much &quot;activity&quot; with merchants and <br/>\nspells makes my screen lock up. So do the Inns in the <br/>\nDesert and Commonlands. :(  I was debating on tying out <br/>\nLavastrom, but with my save vs Fire attacks at a <br/>\nwhopping 5 I will take quite a beating I think. I need <br/>\nto go back to Grobb to train my Bash skill (didn&#39;t <br/>\nrealize I hadn&#39;t trained in it yet. Doh!), Dodge, and <br/>\nBind Wound so I was debating on Upper Guk, or tryng the <br/>\nfurther reaches of the Innothule swamp.  North Ro is an <br/>\noption too. &lt;shrug&gt; But I am tired of that desert. Can <br/>\nyou get to the boat in Freeport from under the docks <br/>\nwithout seeing a guard? If I can then I was debating on <br/>\nOOT. Is all of OOT a high level zone or just parts of it?<br/>\nI really want to go to Faydwer and take on the Nitebrite <br/>\nSisters.  How do you increase faction with Dwarves in <br/>\nKaladim so as not to be KoS as a Troll SK?<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nBeld Demonblade,<br/>\nThe HT advise was very informative. I will use it from <br/>\nnow on like that. :)<br/>\nSince you are obviously a very expeienced SK can you <br/>\nwrite up  how you went about avoiding guards, increasing <br/>\nfactions (and which groups) and such as an SK?<br/>\nI do not want to wander zones in &quot;Panic Mode&quot; if there <br/>\nis a simple way around it. The Wood Elves of Lesser and <br/>\nGreater Fey are my main concern after getting Dwarves <br/>\nout of the way. :)<br/>\nThis assumes that it is possible of course.  Heh, can <br/>\nyou imagine going to Rivervale and getting the Healing <br/>\nring from the Sherrif or Deputy? Forgot it&#39;s name and <br/>\nwho gives it, sorry. :) &quot;I am one with the wall.&quot; heh.<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik <br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n9th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
