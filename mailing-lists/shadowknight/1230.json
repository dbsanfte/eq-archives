I would consider it to be another form of Harm Touch but used much<br/>\nmore often.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Quest itself is easily the hardest I have heard of so don&#39;t expect to do<br/>\nit straight away. The soulfire is a childs play in comparison.<br/>\nYou must be lvl 50 to talk to the guy giving out the quest but you can get<br/>\nthe details and start earlier then that. The spell is lvl 49.<br/>\nand start saving your money, need 3 K to do it 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
