He is 30 or 35 and also has a<br/>\n30 or 35 (actually, 30 I think for both of them) warrior guard. Jyle is a<br/>\ndruid so you can&#39;t kite him. But the Errolisi sisters are another story.<br/>\nThey are actually pretty low level. 10 maybe? I don&#39;t remember. They were<br/>\ngreen to me by the time I got there. There are some named sisters however<br/>\nthat are 25 or so and are quite good experience and generally not camped<br/>\nseeing as how they are &quot;good&quot; If you can take the two that are in a hut<br/>\ntogether you can also make good money seeing as how one of them (larissa I<br/>\nthink) has a 10-plat longsword every time (8minute spawn).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for crushbone, yeah, trolls are kos there by default. I don&#39;t know how<br/>\nhard it is to change that (I don&#39;t know any trolls that have tried). If/when<br/>\nyou do go there, the slaves are very low level, like level 5 maybe 10. I<br/>\noften killed them in a single double attack at level 20 with my reaper of<br/>\nthe dead. Do not try and kill the little gnome magician though unless you<br/>\nare 30+ (maybe higher) as he is a really nasty bugger.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Rich Hitz [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rich.Hitz@...\">Rich.Hitz@...</a>]On Behalf Of (Cronikx)<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 17, 2000 3:39 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadowknight@onelist.com\">shadowknight@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [shadowknight] Trolls and Freeport<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;(Cronikx)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vtemplarv@...\">vtemplarv@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;1) Not anymore as far as I know. You used to be able to but they removed<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Da Bastards! Heh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3) Yes, killing wood elf slaves raises indigo brotherhood faction, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;killing high elf slaves raises The Dead faction. I personally<br/>\n&gt; spent 5 days<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there, many hours a day, killing those elves until I could do<br/>\n&gt; the quests in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the house of the dead to raise my faction up. It took a long time but was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;worth it in the end.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; YES! Woohoo! Thanks for that update! I assume Crushbone Orcs KoS everboby.<br/>\n&gt; AllaKhazam says killing Eriolissi Sisters, and Jyle Windshot<br/>\n&gt; (assume the one<br/>\n&gt; in Freeport) increase faction in Crushbone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That gives me 3 more questions.<br/>\n&gt; 1) What level are the Highelf (or any for that matter) slaves?<br/>\n&gt; 2) What level are the Eriolissi Sisters in OOT? (lowest and what<br/>\n&gt; are of the<br/>\n&gt; island?)<br/>\n&gt; 3) What level is Jyle?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Cronikx<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
