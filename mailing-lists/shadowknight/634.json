I have yet to <br/>\ntrain my Meditation since I continued fighting till I <br/>\nwas comefortable enough that if I died I wouldn&#39;t lose <br/>\nmy level.<br/>\nI have been thinking on my last name for a while and <br/>\nhave narrowed the scope a bit.  Cronik likes to travel. <br/>\nI hate staying in the same zone for too long.  With that <br/>\nin mind can anyone here help me choose a last name?<br/>\nSomething dark, not light  like Silverfoot, or <br/>\nWindrider.  Maybe Bloodtoes, or Footsore or Darkstrider.<br/>\nI like Darkstrider.
