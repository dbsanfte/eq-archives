My question for more experienced shadowkinghts is, is clinging<br/>\ndarkness cumulative?  In other words if I cast it on an npc twice am I<br/>\ngetting twice the effect, or is there no difference.  Also, how long<br/>\ndoes the effect persist for?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also been using fear, but it seems to fizzle quite a bit.  It&#39;s<br/>\nbeen very handy when I&#39;m low on health from fighting something and then<br/>\nget jumped by a fire elemental or something.  I usually try to switch<br/>\ntargets and fear the new attacker so I can finish off the first and<br/>\nrun.  It gets a bit dangerous when I&#39;m under a bubble and fear keeps<br/>\nfizzling though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nAtrocity<br/>\nBertoxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
