Getting to Mistmoore is<br/>\na slight pain unless you can teleport over somewhere near there (and back).<br/>\nArlena is at least level 30. I say this because even the UNNAMED gyspy<br/>\nmusicians in Mistmoore are level 30, and they all can CHARM quite well. So,<br/>\nbe careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nDekam N&#39;Tazi may very well be in Neriak. N&#39;Tazi sounds like a dark elf name<br/>\nanyway. It was an assumption of mine he would be in Qeynos (cuz almost all<br/>\nthe quests in the west have something to do with Qeynos). If the site says<br/>\nhe&#39;s in Neriak, he&#39;s in Neriak. Come to think of it, that&#39;s actually a GOOD<br/>\nthing. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDV</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
