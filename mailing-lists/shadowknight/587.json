Sorry, I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been on lately, but bought a new house and moving everything over,<br/>\nhaven&#39;t had the computer hooked up for about a week and a half, so .....  I<br/>\nhave a question for all the SKs out there, I have just reached 14th lvl<br/>\n(woo-hoo!!), and things seem to be going okay.  My one major deficiency<br/>\nright now seems to be that I do not have a magic weapon.  I keep both 1HS<br/>\nand 2HS maxxed out, and have virtually no skill in the others (all below<br/>\n10).  Hunting in Lavastorm is very difficult without a magic weapon, and I<br/>\nam starting to run into more and more INVULNERABLE!s elsewhere as well.<br/>\n(Ghouls, etc.....)  What is a good 1H or 2H slashing weapon that is that is<br/>\nboth magic and inexpensive?  How much play should I plan on spending?  I can<br/>\nmake some cash, but never seem to have the 200-300 plat for the auctioned<br/>\nweapons I would *like* to have..... &lt;grin&gt;.  Any recommendations out there?<br/>\nAny higher level SKs with an old magic 1HS or 2HS that they would be willing<br/>\nto part with for a reasonable sum on the Povar server?  Any help my fellow<br/>\nSKs could lend would be very much appreciated!!
