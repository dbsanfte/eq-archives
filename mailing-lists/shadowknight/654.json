Is there a 1HS weapon <br/>\nthat does alot of damage?  The highest I&#39;ve seen is a <br/>\nCrystalline Blade at 11 damage (besides Ghoulbane at 15 <br/>\ndamage). <br/>\nAnyone on this list use a weapon other than a 2HS?  How <br/>\ndoes it compare to damage done by MOBS at higher level? <br/>\nIs it good as a solo adventurer? <br/>\nI sent out a website that lists SK weapons, but that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t tell you that a 12 damage sword with a strength <br/>\nof 124 will do 25 max damage at 12th level with 2HS <br/>\nmaxed. :)<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nCronik &lt;Brethren of ill Omen&gt;<br/>\nLeft Hand of Thule the Pain Bringer<br/>\n13th Season Troll SK<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Greenbloods jus be Froglok trick.
