He claims he can get the diamond dust for me, but won&#39;t<br/>\ngive up the npc that drops it. He claims that the npc is 50th level and <br/>\nthat the diamond dust is a rare drop item off it. I am thinking that this<br/>\ncould mean that the npc may be in the planes but that is merley speculation.<br/>\nI wish he would give up the info but he is keeping it hidden from all for<br/>\nanother gnome. Well i hope this gives all you tinkerers hope:) Has anyone <br/>\ndiscovered what the formula is for the Thermal Cloak? Where can i aquire <br/>\ntattered belts? Are they merely patchwork belts or are they actually called<br/>\nTattered belts? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGrudup PuddleJumperTinkertot.....Tallon Zek *80 skill*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
