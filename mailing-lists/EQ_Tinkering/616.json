At<br/>\nonly 57 skill I am pretty successful at making cams. Wisdom helps immensely<br/>\nwith all trade skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nFixer, 34 gnomish enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sragan@...\">sragan@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My first recommendation is find you an enchanter and buy you a couple of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>bracers and a necklass that raises charisma (not that expensive for a 20th<br/>\nlevel). Also see if you can get one of the +15 charisma &#39;crude steins&#39; from<br/>\nthe bouncer in feerot. Having a charisma of 86 instead of 60 makes a ton of<br/>\ndifference cash wise while you are doing all this tinkering.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also realize that you can NOT gain more than 1 point in tinkering until<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you get to *21*. You are stuck at 51 until then and I forget what your max<br/>\nis per level.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Note, your milage may vary, but the first thing one should try to tinker<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to gain skill is the flameless lanterns. I would usually do about 20 at a<br/>\ntime and it would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 plat to do<br/>\n(after selling the lanterns back) depending on your success rate and<br/>\ncharisma. Sometimes I would gain nothing, sometimes 4 or 5 points, its very<br/>\nrandom. On average I would say I gained about a point per 20 lanterns which<br/>\nmeans I approximately spent about 20 to 30 plat per point up to 68 where<br/>\nlanterns get trivial.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; YES, you CAN make some cash selling the cams to bowers. While nothing to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>write home about you can make some fairly decent pocket change. I started<br/>\nmaking cams at 68 (when lanterns became trivial) and my success rate was not<br/>\ntoo bad. I could sell the cams for 25 plat to bowers, where they would<br/>\nusually spend about 40 plat. They are usually VERY happy to find a tinker<br/>\nthat can make cams...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gaining skill gets a bit more expensive here since each attempt cost maybe<br/>\n </span></blockquote>12 to 15 plat. But as with the lanterns I figure I would gain about a point<br/>\nevery 20 cams or so, which means you really need to find a place to sell<br/>\nyour cams to support your tinkering habit. I was able to get my skill up to<br/>\n75 making cams.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; And thats where my story ends, without the fishing pole/telescope to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>practice on tinkering has no future for me short of making a bit of pocket<br/>\nchange on cams. Damn those verant bastards, I still get an unexeptable rate<br/>\nof failure on cams even though they are trivial. =|<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps, if there does exist a kind soul willing to share the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fishing pole recipe I would be eternally grateful.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FizzWizz of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; 35 Wizard<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
