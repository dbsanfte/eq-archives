Which means a ton of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, does any of the dropped items you need stack?  If <br/>\nso, it might be possible to carry over a nice supply of them to <br/>\nSteamfont and keep making attempts at the Watchman armor.  If the <br/>\nplate is returned, then it might be cheaper than Rebreathers.  Can <br/>\nanyone confirm this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, my tinkering is up to 128, so I know I have some work to do <br/>\nand any help would be appreciated.  Now, I just have to find the <br/>\nfunds.  hmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nNorbert Gearsmith<br/>\nGem Chopper on E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\n(Give me a tell sometime Ghirardelli and we can chat.
