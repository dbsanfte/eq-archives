I&#39;m pretty sure I got<br/>\nmy first point on making cams, too bad back then those were the non-working<br/>\ncams, a lot of platinum was flushed trying to make a bow with them.  A<br/>\nlevel 50 warrior on my server made some attempts at the stalking probes<br/>\nwith 50 skill, not a lot of successes but did get a skill increase after<br/>\njust a couple.  Might be a possible solution for the &#39;hundreds of plat on<br/>\nlanterns & no skill&#39;...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy tinkering skill raise story is pretty much the same as Fizzwiz&#39;. About a<br/>\n20pp per point average for me on the lanterns as well.  As he said,<br/>\nsometimes 2 or 3 points per round, sometimes none at all.  Then I made cams<br/>\nfrom about 65 to the trivial at 75.  Never got a skill increase off the<br/>\nmechanized lockpicks but they turned trivial around 67-68.  Spyglass wasn&#39;t<br/>\ntrivial at a low 70s skill, not surprisingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Luke<br/>\nTinkering site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering\">http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:34 PM 9/13/99 -0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sragan@...\">sragan@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Note, your milage may vary, but the first thing one should try to tinker<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to gain skill is the flameless lanterns. I would usually do about 20 at a<br/>\ntime and it would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 plat to do<br/>\n(after selling the lanterns back) depending on your success rate and<br/>\ncharisma. Sometimes I would gain nothing, sometimes 4 or 5 points, its very<br/>\nrandom. On average I would say I gained about a point per 20 lanterns which<br/>\nmeans I approximately spent about 20 to 30 plat per point up to 68 where<br/>\nlanterns get trivial.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;YES, you CAN make some cash selling the cams to bowers.

I started<br/>\nmaking cams at 68 (when lanterns became trivial) and my success rate was<br/>\nnot too bad. I could sell the cams for 25 plat to bowers, where they would<br/>\nusually spend about 40 plat. They are usually VERY happy to find a tinker<br/>\nthat can make cams...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Gaining skill gets a bit more expensive here since each attempt cost maybe<br/>\n </span></blockquote>12 to 15 plat. But as with the lanterns I figure I would gain about a point<br/>\nevery 20 cams or so, which means you really need to find a place to sell<br/>\nyour cams to support your tinkering habit. I was able to get my skill up to<br/>\n75 making cams.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
