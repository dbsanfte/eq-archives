Your analogy bears no resemblance<br/>\nto the market, high level people arenn&#39;t going to balk at paying 1000pp, which<br/>\nis exactly what these &quot;idiots&quot; as you call them have been saying, people are<br/>\nbuying them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuthless price undercutting leads to stagnation of the market - look at<br/>\nblacksmithing, the first people to start selling banded armor make quite a good<br/>\nprofit, but eventually so many people get onto the market that you get abused by<br/>\nyour customers if you ask anything apart from slightly above cost price, as<br/>\nthough they&#39;re doing you a favor by buying your product, instead of the other<br/>\nway around  - people like this I just tell &quot;Go buy chainmail from a vendor<br/>\nthen&quot;.  People complain about the Jewelley market&#39;s &quot;price fixing&quot;, but I<br/>\nbelieve that it&#39;s helped the market more than hurt it, becasue it makes it<br/>\nworthwhile for other people to invest in getting their jewellery skills up -<br/>\nrather than spending hundreds of plat to get your skill up, and find that you<br/>\ncan only make items for your guild/friends becasue ruthless competition has made<br/>\nit near unprofitable to sell to anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and <br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they   <br/>\nare addressed.
