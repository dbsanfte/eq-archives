Being an enchanter, I&#39;m told that<br/>\n&gt; monsters won&#39;t bother me if I&#39;m in elemental illusion, so maybe I can check<br/>\n&gt; the place out and get lucky, who knows.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Last night I went to Solusek&#39;s Eye at level 26.  In SolA I am majorly lost with<br/>\na ton of pitfalls into lava.  No thanks.  Some day I may both mapping it or<br/>\nfinding a map for it, and looking for the gnomes.  At the door is a couple of<br/>\ngoblins that were blue/green to me.  The shaman was blue, so I nuked him, and a<br/>\nWizard, Shaman, and two regular fire goblins came with him.  I zoned with 13 hp<br/>\nleft.  I might try going invis, but I know things in Nagafen&#39;s Lair can see<br/>\nthru invis, so I am weary.  I don&#39;t want to get in a situation where I am in<br/>\nthe middle of 10 goblins and my invis wears off.  I am a gnome wizard who<br/>\nfollows the diety of solusek ro so I was hoping I have good faction here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I haven&#39;t fished with animated bait yet, but I think its likely that it is<br/>\n&gt; a component in a recipie, maybe for the collapsable pole.  Either that or<br/>\n&gt; it may be a quest item or maybe it has some better fishing abilities.  No<br/>\n&gt; tests have really been done to see that I know of.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did some experiments with the animated bait last night.  The cork costs 1cp,<br/>\nthe spricket 3cp.  They combine perfectly and are trivial at 50 skill level<br/>\n(base).  So functionally they cost just as much as regular bait.  Performance<br/>\nwise they are identical to regular bait.  Just more cumbersome and tedious to<br/>\nmake.  There is nothing special about it.  It looks the same, acts the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kryogen Katspaw<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
