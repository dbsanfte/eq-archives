I realize that some of what I <br/>\nsaid are not skills, they are class specific, but I believe you get the <br/>\npoint.  We need something that only we can make and some people need, <br/>\neverything we can make now can be bought, we need to petition for the fishing <br/>\npole to be either unbreakable or take away animated bait and make the <br/>\ncollapseable fishing pole always have bait, the duration for stalking probes <br/>\nto last an entire zone, I am not even going to mention the fireworks, the <br/>\ncams that when enchanted increase a stat like delay.  I think we need to <br/>\norganize ourselves and I think Rotgut needs to organize us 8)  hee hee. <br/>\nRemember anything we dont complain about becomes that wonderful   &quot; feature &quot; <br/>\nof the game.  Again not to depress anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow taking your opinions. And yes all races and classes have a base 50 skill <br/>\nin tinker only gnomes can increase the skill, and yes the fishing pole is <br/>\ntrivial at lvl 1 which makes me wonder why the third book is so elusive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbat cleric of the once 14 after gnomestock 13 then by the gods of Norrath <br/>\nand a wonderful High lvl cleric Cantin I belive ..... 14 again.
