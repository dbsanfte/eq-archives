It is not going to cost <br/>\nthat much! Even if they never break no one would pay the 30 plat for the <br/>\nfishing pole that we&#39;d have to sell it for to make a profit. Anything <br/>\ncombination over 5 plat is an idiotic price to spend making a fishing pole. <br/>\nAnd if it really does cost more than 5 plat to make, then it&#39;s not worth it <br/>\nin the slightest amount! I already doubt that people are going to pay the <br/>\nprice we ask for the next to worthless toy that we call a spyglass! Any high <br/>\npriced components, such as gears now need to be left out, they aren&#39;t, or <br/>\nbetter not be part of the fishing pole.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;also a cam might be used for the reel of the fishing pole<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lukas@...\">lukas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Friday, August 20, 1999 6:36 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] Some thoughts<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lukas@...\">lukas@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Last night&#39;s attempts resulted in no luck again.  I think we&#39;re right <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the metal shaft and rod combos but we&#39;re missing something.  Here&#39;s a <br/>\n&gt;few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of my thoughts thus far:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Fletching strings or dwarven wire as a component seems unlikely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Although some items need things MADE by other trade skills (compass), I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t think of anything that requires you buy components from a <br/>\n&gt;different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trade skill.  Dwarven wire is for the Trueshot Bow quest (?) and takes a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while to obtain - lots of travelling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Spiderling silk sounds like a good possibility.  Watch out though, <br/>\n&gt;there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is SPIDER silk, and SPIDERLING silk.  The latter seems more likely as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spiderlings are right in Steamfont and it would be very similar to how <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lockpicks need a rat ear.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Spriket?  Assuming that the two books are all that exists of tinkering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now, a spriket is the only item not used for any project.  What is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spriket though?  Not in the dictionary...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Raw bamboo doesn&#39;t seem like a likely component.  It is a bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instrument, also the pic of the collapsible pole shows it constructed of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; metal.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - A bottle as a possible component.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Luke </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
