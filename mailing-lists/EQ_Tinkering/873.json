He is a GM, a game master, that means that he <br/>\nworks AT Verant, and gets payed for being a guide, and, he IS told stuff <br/>\nabout what happens in the game. He is a very trustworthy GM too.<br/>\nOne time, when I asked him about something, he said he could answer me, <br/>\nbecause he didn&#39;t know the full truth on it, and didn&#39;t want to start a <br/>\nbunch of rmors about it, so he doesn&#39;t say something unless it&#39;s confirmed. <br/>\nHe told me that tinkering WAS broken. I asked him what broken meant and he <br/>\nsaid there there was one tinkering book missing and some of the combinations <br/>\nthat should work don&#39;t. I asked him if the third book would be hidden or <br/>\nnot, and he said, that he didn&#39;t know. Also, he said that it will be put in <br/>\nthe patch info when tinkering is fixed, so we will know. I also asked him if <br/>\nthey will be working more on tinkering, and he said quite possibly so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere you have it. The truth. The REAL truth. I blelive this GM is to be <br/>\ntrusted. He dosn&#39;t lie, and he knew what he was talking about right away. <br/>\nWe&#39;ll just have to wait till we see that they&#39;ve fixed it till we look any <br/>\nfurther.<br/>\n<br/>\nSniffledoo.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
