But rather a suggestion. I&#39;m a level 20 Gnome Mage and have been <br/>\nactively tinkering for months now.. even before I hit level 16. I was <br/>\neagerly awaiting the day that I hit 16 and could raise my &quot;tinkering skill&quot; <br/>\nwith training. Heck I even saved up 25 points for that sole purpose. Well, <br/>\nI hit level 16 and CAN&#39;T train in the skill. Sooo... I have spent the last <br/>\n4 levels trying to get SOME kind of skill improvement. And so far to date I <br/>\nhave only gotten my Tinkering to raise from 50 to 53. I have spent and <br/>\nBURNED atleast 500 to 600 Platinum Pieces trying to get my skill to <br/>\nimprove. I tried everything from Flameless Lanterns to Spyglasses. If I got <br/>\na success, I tried to sell it for some kind of profit and put that same <br/>\nmoney right back into tinkering.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, to make a long story short. I have burned WAY too much money and am <br/>\nTIRED of this nonsense. Shamans have Alchemy (which granted can be more <br/>\nexpensive even than tinkering), and there was a recent addition for shamans <br/>\nto be able to put training points into Alchemy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT ABOUT TINKERING?!?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nI say we start a write in campaign of e-mail,  or a petition.. or SOMETHING <br/>\nto let Verant know that we Gnomes are tired of wasting needless amounts of <br/>\ncash to raise a skill that we can not train in... plus making things worse <br/>\nit being the MOST expensive trade skill in EQ. Something needs to be done <br/>\nabout this.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuni Gearspinner<br/>\n20th Season Mage Gnome<br/>\nKarana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
