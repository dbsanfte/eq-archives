The skill is very expensive (more expensive","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-239959464\">I wouldn&#39;t start tinkering until I had loads of money to spare. As the skill <br/>\nlooks now you will never break even.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe skill is very expensive (more expensive than jewelcraft even if we start <br/>\nat skill of 50) and the only things you can sell are rebreathers, aqualungs <br/>\nand spyglasses (bow cams if you find a fletcher to do business with or start <br/>\nfletching aswell) and none of em sells very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp at very high skills you can make some armor pieces too, most of em (if <br/>\nnot all) only usable by gnome warriors and/or clerics. By the time you can <br/>\ndo this you will have burned some 50 - 100 thousand pp and the components <br/>\nyou need to find for these pieces are not that easy to get. These armors are <br/>\npretty decent and they look just awesome so when you get there, you might <br/>\nstart selling stuff again, but gnome wars and clerics are not that common, <br/>\nand I find it hard to see that you will break even on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTinkering is a fun skill, there are not that many tinkerers at rebreather <br/>\nskill or higher but to make money you should look at jewelcraft (and then <br/>\nyou should be an enchanter). And this skill is also very expensive to raise <br/>\nto the point where you can make money off of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are thinking about doing tinkering anyway (it really is a kinda fun <br/>\nskill) and are looking for another tradeskill to start with, I would <br/>\nconsider fletching. One of the earlier items you can make are cams, which <br/>\nare used for making bows (fletching) and later on you will most likelly be <br/>\nmaking catapults to raise skill for which you will need player made bows to <br/>\nmake. Its kinda neat if you can do those yourself instead of running around <br/>\ntrying to find a fletcher to make you like 30-40 bows :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, bows and arrows can actually be sold at times, and its an easy and <br/>\ncheap skill to raise to around 180 skill..<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sandortien Stormwielder, Small Troll Wizard - Cult of Steel (Xegony)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Suthsayer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suthsayer@...\">suthsayer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Re: a beginner<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, 1 Sep 2001 19:34:52 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you want a money skill... get into gemcraft.

Unlimited (insta-cast) charges of a silly spell for 70pp.  <br/>\n&gt;People would buy them as fast as I could make em.  Not sure how the market <br/>\n&gt;is for that now.<br/>\n&gt;Tinkering is fun tho...  I still remember when I made my 1st rebreather at <br/>\n&gt;like 130 skill.  ROFL.  I was stoked.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;/gu OMG!  I made one!  I made one!  Rhaaaa!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;guild&gt; one of what?<br/>\n&gt;/gu a rebreather!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;guild&gt; GRATS!

You can sell them for around 2k.  <br/>\n&gt;Warriors need 2 of them for their epic quest. But lately I&#39;ve been noticing <br/>\n&gt;a lot more items that have endure breath on them so rebreathers probably <br/>\n&gt;aren&#39;t going to sell too well in the future.  I&#39;m hoping this isn&#39;t the <br/>\n&gt;case. But on the last few runs to Kedge Keep my guild has made, only a few <br/>\n&gt;people needed the aqualungs I have because most had some kind of breathing <br/>\n&gt;device already.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   As far as skill caps goes. the way I understand it is Gnomes can get <br/>\n&gt;tinkering to 250 along with another trade skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Concerning other trade skills. maybe tailoring would be good for you. <br/>\n&gt;Most of it up until the later levels are &quot;found&quot; components off mobs so at <br/>\n&gt;first it&#39;s not too expensive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Chesa&#39;s Player<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Ancient Warders<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kristinf@...\">kristinf@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kristinf@...\">kristinf@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Friday, August 31, 2001 6:18 PM<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] Re: a beginner<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Thank you, i knew it wouldnt be easy but what about that breather<br/>\n&gt;   thing. isnt that possible to use by others. and various other<br/>\n&gt;   trinkets. is it really a sinking hole or is it possible to make money<br/>\n&gt;   at some later date say at level 100 or so.
