So my question is simple:  As I see it there have been two or three recipies proposed, none of these involving rare components like Diamond Dust, why hasn&#39;t anyone tried these?  I don&#39;t have my tables of tinlering stuff with me right now but I know it couldn&#39;t cost more than 500pp to try all these recipies out, in fact it should cost much less.<br/>\n<br/>\n            Yattalren, Level 30 Wizard of the Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
