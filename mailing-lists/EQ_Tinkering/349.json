Thats<br/>\nfive items.  If you make the assumption that the collapsible fishing pole was<br/>\npossible from the get-go, It would have to consist of four or fewer pieces.  So<br/>\nthat lowers the combinations factorially :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nXillitil of Povar wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Xillitil of Povar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillitil@...\">xillitil@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; uhh...if i remember my math right,8 slots and 13 items(including empty)<br/>\n&gt; should be 13! - 5!...ummm...51,891,840 combinations...or is that<br/>\n&gt; permutations...and thats assuming we don&#39;t use anything less obvious like<br/>\n&gt; skins or something...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; guess we won&#39;t be doing an exhaustive search anytime soon....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Xillitil/Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:M_Bierce@...\">M_Bierce@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hello everyone on this list.  I&#39;m new to the list, just signed up today.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyway this is a question for any mathematic wizards out there.  We have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;total of 8 slots in the toolbox and a total of 12 items to use.  Does<br/>\n&gt; &gt;anyone know how many combinations that we can come up with?  Remember that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this includes just having 1 item in the box or 2 or 3 etc. etc.  Well me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;personally I would just like to know for curiousity sake.  And don&#39;t worry<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you now have another helping hand in the search for the collapsable fishing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pole recipie. :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Mike<br/>\n&gt; &gt;P.S. If we do find it imagine how much it can sell for. :) $$$$$$$$<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
