Personally I <br/>\ndon&#39;t care either the man gave us a clue that has started everyone <br/>\nsearching.  What else were you guys doing?  Nothing but searching, at least <br/>\nnow you have a clue to go along with it.  And whoever keeps telling the <br/>\ntroll that he has seen numerous messages from him that have amounted to <br/>\nnothing, well the past three that I have seen from you contain absolutley <br/>\nnothing to do with tinkering either.  My advice is let&#39;s just tinker and <br/>\nkeep the personal shit out of this damn list because I am sick and tired of <br/>\nreading stupid e-mails that try to degrade someone that is trying to help <br/>\nus.  To the troll if they keep giving you garbage get off this list but <br/>\nfirst get the e-mails of all the people that are behind you and just send <br/>\nthem the information.  That way you&#39;ll weed out all the nonsense that is <br/>\ngoing on here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcoux</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
