Look at other tinkering items the <br/>\nmechanical lock picks take rat ears, the spy glass takes a fishing pole, <br/>\nFirewater is gnomish spirits and water! Those are some pretty weird <br/>\ncomponents! Who knows, maybe the fishing pole takes a raw bamboo pole, then <br/>\na dagger (to cut it), then a sprinket (Who knows why.) then gears (for the <br/>\nreel?), and some bolts (to connect it all).<br/>\nHey...that might just work...got to go try it out now, bye!<br/>\n<br/>\nSniffledoo Copperheart. Common Squire of the Scarlet Blade -- Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: MAY-be that guild just found the quest that gives you the info to build <br/>\nit? Huh, who knows...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;For those of us hot on the trail of the ever elusive collapsable fishing <br/>\n&gt;pole, here is a compilation of ideas from myself and others that might aid <br/>\n&gt;a few folks with the cash to try different combinations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On the subject of which components are the most promising, I would start <br/>\n&gt;with excluding the reflective shard and the spriket. Next after those the  <br/>\n&gt;least likely candidates are the gnomish bolts, the metal twine, the bamboo <br/>\n&gt;pole, and the cork. Although there could be an argument made that a &#39;cork&#39; <br/>\n&gt;could be used.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, that leaves us the following 7 components to work with<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fishing Pole<br/>\n&gt;metal rod<br/>\n&gt;grease<br/>\n&gt;metal shaft<br/>\n&gt;gears<br/>\n&gt;sprockets<br/>\n&gt;Cloth Cord (from a tailor I assume, I have never used this in a <br/>\n&gt;combination)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This significantly narrows the field, and I would highly recommend that we <br/>\n&gt;exhaust all combinations of these items before moving on to others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mostly likely the recipe has from 3 to 5 components. Some have made an <br/>\n&gt;argument that since the original tinker tool box had only 4 spaces, that <br/>\n&gt;the recipe has 3 or 4 components. This may be true but hey, Verant screwed <br/>\n&gt;up on the compass, why not the pole? =|<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We should exhaust all combinations of 4 and 5 components before moving on <br/>\n&gt;to recipes with 6 or more components.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It is highly likely that the recipe contains more than 1 metal shaft or <br/>\n&gt;metal rod, perhaps as many as 3. While combinations using 2 and 3 <br/>\n&gt;rods/shafts WITH the fishing pole have almost been exhausted (check the <br/>\n&gt;&#39;pole database&#39;), I have noticed we still have quite a few combinations <br/>\n&gt;left to try that EXCLUDE a regular fishing pole, but INCLUDE 2/3 rods or <br/>\n&gt;shafts. There are very few of the &#39;double shaft&#39; and &#39;triple shaft&#39; <br/>\n&gt;combinations that exclude the fishing pole yet to be tried.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Having exhausted all of these, then the most likely possibilities are that <br/>\n&gt;there is some component somewhere that we are missing, perhaps there is a <br/>\n&gt;tinkered item like a &#39;reel&#39; that we need to make first before combining it <br/>\n&gt;to make the fishing pole, or Verant has once again screwed the tinkers of <br/>\n&gt;the world... =|<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;While I tend to lean toward the latter, the possibility of having to <br/>\n&gt;&#39;pre-tinker&#39; a reel for the rod sounds intriguing...  blah...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anywho, thats my 500 plat on the matter or so (I have spent a hell of a lot <br/>\n&gt;more than 2 cents).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;FizzWizz of tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
