If you think about<br/>\nsomething that collapses, what is it made of?<br/>\n<br/>\nA series of shafts that are different sizes.  The smaller shafts being made<br/>\nto fit inside the larger shafts.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, I believe the recipie is going to be made up of a number of<br/>\nshafts, 2 maybe 3, some kind of twine and some grease.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\nRotgut<br/>\n<br/>\nCollapsable Fishing Pole Known Failure database:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html\">http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
