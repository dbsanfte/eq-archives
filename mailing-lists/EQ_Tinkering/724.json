No one knows exactly what it does. <br/>\nSomewhere (EQ stratics perhaps?) I read an interview with Brad McQuaid. In <br/>\nthis interview, Brad hinted at the button opening a secret passage to a <br/>\ndungeon that located under the water near the island. This dungeon was <br/>\nsupposed to have very good loot, but is also supposed to be guarded well. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know firsthand if this is true or not, (one can never tell with Verant <br/>\nanyhow) because I&#39;ve never personally been there to check it out. So it all <br/>\nvery well may be just rumor. But if it isn&#39;t, it may be a very good lead.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
