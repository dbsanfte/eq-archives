I&#39;ve been carrying around all the<br/>\ncomponents to make them lately, and even though I always give them away<br/>\n(no-one has ever not accepted them), I seem to be making more money than<br/>\nthey cost me to make!  Occationally I do make a dud, but I&#39;d say they are<br/>\npretty much fixed now, good work verant!  for best results have as many<br/>\npeople casting them as possible, some from far away some from close.  I also<br/>\nthink that we should start flooding the servers with these, make loads and<br/>\ngive them away as much as possible (less than a gold piece for 4, I believe<br/>\nthey cost to make).  for those who &lt;dont&gt; know how to make them, its easy.<br/>\nput a gnomish spirits and a flask of water (flask) into your toolbox and<br/>\ncombine.  now put the firewater back in the toolbox, add a metal shaft, and<br/>\na batwing, press combine voila!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCogg - Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  dont forget to remind them not to use them near guards.  And make sure<br/>\nthey take them out of their backpacks before lighting them... that is real<br/>\nugly</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
