You only seem<br/>\nto get 1 extra point max per lvl.  Granted making the poles is trivial from<br/>\nthe get go, but taking account that getting ones skill high is obscenely<br/>\ndifficult to do, 5pp failures which seem to happen more even with my wisdom<br/>\nsuit on and I think 20pp is a fair price for the following reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\tAkanon is in the boonies.  Long walk from the only place to buy<br/>\ncomponents.  Travel expenses :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n2.\t This is a very very expensive trade with very little to show for it<br/>\n- i.e. things to sell.  Last night people asked what else I could make.<br/>\nWhen I told em the entire list of things tinkerable, the fishing pole was<br/>\nthe only thing they really wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.\tWhat&#39;s wrong with making a 10pp profit, taking into account the<br/>\nfailures?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSo, I say 20pp is a decent price to sell to people we don&#39;t<br/>\nknow, 10pp to those we do.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
