I believe there are folks on some servers that are making them now. My hat goes off to them and the astronomical price they had to pay to get the skill. I would be curious to know how they got the 40k+ plat that is required after you max out at 102 on stalking probes to get the skill raised. My guess would be thier guild put up the cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebreathers are doable, but like I said above you can expect to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of 40k+ making aqua lungs to get there. Thats a hell of a lot of aqua lungs to sell =|<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Diamond dust, I aint gonna believe shit till someone shows it to me in a trade window. If someone wants to show off, I would gladly hop on any server of your choice just to take a look at it =) I dont care if you tell me where you got it or not, I would just like to know if its in the game or not...heh-heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nFizzWizz of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
