If you talk to him<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; will talk about making a bridge to Odus.  He needs a<br/>\n&gt; list of engineers<br/>\n&gt; delivered to Antonius<br/>\n&gt; Bayles&#39; messenger.  He refused to give me the list<br/>\n&gt; to someone who conned<br/>\n&gt; indifferent, so I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know if a friendlier face will get it.  I have<br/>\n&gt; been told that if you<br/>\n&gt; keep asking him about<br/>\n&gt; the engineers (the text is not bracketed) he will<br/>\n&gt; drop the note, which lists<br/>\n&gt; the names of the<br/>\n&gt; three engineers.  The human engineer is located in<br/>\n&gt; the arcane science building<br/>\n&gt; in Freeport,<br/>\n&gt; but I don&#39;t know what you need to do to get him to<br/>\n&gt; respond (giving him the<br/>\n&gt; note doesn&#39;t work).<br/>\n&gt; But if you talk to Rucio Divella in the office of<br/>\n&gt; the people he says that<br/>\n&gt; Hansl Bigroon is the<br/>\n&gt; office manager.  If asked who are the other<br/>\n&gt; engineers he says he saw them<br/>\n&gt; once, one human,<br/>\n&gt; one dwarf and one gnome.  The gnome he said was<br/>\n&gt; followed around by some sort<br/>\n&gt; of automation<br/>\n&gt; (perhaps the one in Steamfont?).  I am not sure<br/>\n&gt; where to go from there, but it<br/>\n&gt; sounds<br/>\n&gt; intriguing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best place to EXPLORE topics, SHARE<br/>\n&gt; ideas, and <br/>\n&gt; CONNECT to people with the same interests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
