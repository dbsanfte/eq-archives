I have recently begun to have a yearning for tinkering away until<br/>\nall hours of the night, and am looking for some interesting technical<br/>\nscuttlebutt from my esteemed colleagues.  I hear that tinkering is being<br/>\nworked on mightily recently and is becoming ever more popular as a pursuit<br/>\nfor young gnomes in up and coming social circles.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat advice and tips can my learned friends in the not so arcane sciences<br/>\nteach me about this old sport with a new face?<br/>\n <br/>\nI have read all that I can find on the subject and have been both amazed and<br/>\nhorrified by much that I have seen.  Is it true that none have solved the<br/>\nmystery of the fabled thermal cloak?  Are aqualungs truly more expensive<br/>\nthan bardic clothing attire for an entire year?  Are fireworks as impressive<br/>\na sight as some have claimed?  Have any discovered the other fabled<br/>\nchronicles of Gimblestan in the depths of Ak&#39;Annon?  What other amazements<br/>\nand terrible setbacks can I expect as I embark upon my tinkering career?<br/>\n <br/>\n    Yours in all arcane sincerity,<br/>\n <br/>\n                Leagnomo<br/>\n <br/>\nPS  why is it nearly all Gnomish names are in punnish?  Doesn&#39;t anyone use<br/>\nFlemish anymore? }8-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
