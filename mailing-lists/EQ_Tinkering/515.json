I took all my knowledge, everything I know, used all <br/>\nthe common sense I have, and was able to talk my way into a clue from a <br/>\nperson that knows all about the fishing poles. At first I thought whoever <br/>\nknew about it was selfish, that they had no right to keep this, but then <br/>\nwhen I found out that this group of people worked hard for what they had <br/>\nfound, and are very secrective about it, don&#39;t deserve their secret to be <br/>\ngiven away. I mean, THEY are the ones that found the secret, and yes it is a <br/>\nsecret, so why is it that they should just go off and tell everyone? This <br/>\ngame is all about exploration and finding things, and having fun. Thats what <br/>\nthey did, and they found something, so why shouldn&#39;t you have to do the same <br/>\nthing that they did? Why should you just sit back and happily profit from <br/>\nall thier work? This group, whom is a very secretive group, whom I shall not <br/>\nname, worked hard to get what they know, and so I&#39;m not going to go giving <br/>\naway the clue I was told, especially after the rude, immature, derogatory <br/>\ncomments that were made about me. I will tell you this though. Waste not a <br/>\nplat more on trying combinations. You are not only wasting your money, but <br/>\nyou are wasting your time. Search the world, high and low, search the world <br/>\nabove and below...<br/>\nThis is all I will say. It&#39;s been nice being part of this list. I though you <br/>\nwere a bunch of decent people. Your coments have changed my mind. I will no <br/>\nlonger be a part of this list as you wish. It&#39;s been fun guys, and thanks <br/>\nfor all the fish.<br/>\n<br/>\nSniffledoo Copperheart 18th Common Squire of The Scarlet Blade</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
