The general<br/>\n&gt; understanding when someone says something will be done after something else<br/>\n&gt; is that there is a sequence involved.  2 comes after 1.  No one believes<br/>\n&gt; that means 2 comes sometime after 1, but not necessarily next.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tLeagnomo<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Joe D [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joed@...\">joed@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 31, 2000 11:08 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Sigh...
