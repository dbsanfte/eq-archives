I was there when I was in my teens, but have not returned to see<br/>\nwhat he did.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond I think most of us have cleared Ak&#39;anon as a source for any tinkering<br/>\nbook.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, where else do we have to search on Fadwyr?  Dagnors Cauldron (unlikely)<br/>\nis the only other prodominant water based zone.  Let&#39;s have a few teams scan it<br/>\nto make sure we&#39;re not missing anything.  Look for any doors or tunnels other<br/>\nthan kedge.  Not likely much will be found.  ButcherBlock also provides a edge<br/>\nof water that technically could be used for tunnels, holes, and possible mobs. <br/>\nNot likely however.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is OOT.  This zone is huge, and very un-used.  I have searched most<br/>\nof the aqua-goblin stand alone islands and I didn&#39;t see anything worthwhile<br/>\nthere.  The Oracles isle is pretty much just some dwarven smiths, some goblins<br/>\n(including one named goblin shaman that is red to me at 31st), and the oracle. <br/>\nMost of us however haven&#39;t scanned under water to see if anything exists.  I<br/>\nthink this is probably the most unexplored area and might be worth a gander. <br/>\nAlso when you say &quot;waves&quot; you usually mean ocean, not river or lake.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have water in and under freeport, in oasis, in guk, everfrost, lakerathe,<br/>\neruds crossing, and kerra isle.  So, we have a big journey ahead of us.  Anyone<br/>\nwanna start eliminating the possibilities?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kryogen Katpsaw<br/>\nThe almost completely fet-up with tinkering<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
