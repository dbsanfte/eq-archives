Guides are volunteers, but GMs are people that work <br/>\nactually in the Verant building, they know whats going on. They work at the <br/>\nbuilding, answering petitions and get payed for it. It is part of thier job <br/>\nresponsibilities to know what is going on, so that they do NOT give false <br/>\ninformation. Now...if you didn&#39;t read the message I sent here about that <br/>\nearlier, then you don&#39;t even have a right to be flaming me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;How do you know Josh? Are you one of Verant&#39;s game designers, planners,<br/>\n&gt;programmers, or developers?  Are you related to any of them and they have <br/>\n&gt;told<br/>\n&gt;you this is a fact?  Or are you as ignorant as the rest of us and just <br/>\n&gt;going by<br/>\n&gt;what someone told you?<br/>\n&gt;There are enough rumors and disinformation about the 3rd book, collapsible<br/>\n&gt;fishing pole, and fireworks going around that I wonder if anyone on any <br/>\n&gt;server<br/>\n&gt;really has solid information.  Until I recieve some word by an Everquest<br/>\n&gt;programmer or developer I&#39;m keeping my mind open.<br/>\n&gt;Don&#39;t count any information you have been told by the guides or GM&#39;s as<br/>\n&gt;factual.  None of them created this game. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
