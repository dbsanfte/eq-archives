But then he has a chart and<br/>\n&gt; equation posted that show your skill cannot break 50 until level<br/>\n&gt; 26.  I have also read in other places that the skill for<br/>\n&gt; tinkering is (5 * lvl) or (5 * lvl) - 5, which would mean that at<br/>\n&gt; 22 my skill could be 60 or 55, breaking 50 at 16 or 16,<br/>\n&gt; respectively.  Can a number of people please confirm one of these<br/>\n&gt; equations?  I&#39;ve already spent quite a bit of plat on non-trivial<br/>\n&gt; items and I don&#39;t believe my skill has increased.  BTW the newer<br/>\n&gt; equation at Gnomad&#39;s site is (5  * (lvl - 15)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any help is much appreciated<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lithuin Lightbringer<br/>\n&gt; Level 22 wizard<br/>\n&gt; Sylvan Guard<br/>\n&gt; Erollisi Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
