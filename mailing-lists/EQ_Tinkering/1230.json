But if you have made an Observer staff any time you know it�s the same with that, when you get it it had 50 charges if you dropp it on the ground or trade it it resets to 1. Tho in this case i dont mind ppl will trade the lens instead of the staff if they are after the staff for the spell, most ppl arent tho. But in the case with the aqua lung it must be a bug.
