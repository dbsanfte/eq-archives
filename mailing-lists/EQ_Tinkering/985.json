I would first<br/>\nlike to apologize for not being forthwith enough to<br/>\npost my name in game or out as I&#39;ve been somewhat<br/>\nstalked by upset tinkerers of Norath and wish not to<br/>\nbe pursude further.  Recently I was going through my<br/>\nlinks and popped on to the old bookmark I had of the<br/>\ntinkering site that I posted the book to (as it seemed<br/>\nthe most active).  I&#39;ve had the book in my posession<br/>\nsince the first month of relese, and felt totally bad<br/>\nfor you all seeing you bust your ass just for<br/>\nsomething I wrote off so long ago as useless (yeah I<br/>\ncame to the same conclusions of all of you for<br/>\nfireworks ;0).  As for the burning question you all<br/>\nhave on the location of the book, just let me say,<br/>\ndon&#39;t stress yourselves just goto the web page and get<br/>\nthe recipes from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for some of the rumors I&#39;ve read on this thread<br/>\nabout an even more infamous 4th book, I would like end<br/>\nthese rumors now.  This book as of right now is not,<br/>\nrepeat not in the game.  The recipes are working (if<br/>\nyou can figure them out) but they are not in a book<br/>\nthat is currently available in the game.  I have that<br/>\ninformation directly from verant staff. You all have<br/>\nall the books are recipes that are currently<br/>\navailable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome items of interest that I have noticed in Akanon,<br/>\nthere is a larger than normal clockwork spider on the<br/>\nramparts as you enter the city on the top level.  This<br/>\nclockwork is blue to a level 50! Someone go kill it<br/>\ncuz I&#39;m almost KOS in akanon due to killing all the<br/>\nnamed spawns in steamfont (I carry gnome heads around<br/>\nfor luck ;0).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pimp&#39;n fresh gnome of CT<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
