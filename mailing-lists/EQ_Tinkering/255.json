I read on a site that that someone got three of the lenses one<br/>\n&gt; fron the dark elf and two from killing the gnomes that tell you to come<br/>\nback<br/>\n&gt; in a few weeks. This is only what he said, so it looks like we will have<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; kill some of our own brethren to get the quest done. But it&#39;s still that<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; last lens thats missing.
