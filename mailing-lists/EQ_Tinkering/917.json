I went down, and there was an Efreeti by a huge stream of Lava<br/>\ncoming from the ceiling. When I hailed this guy, I lost faction with<br/>\n&quot;Faction 415&quot; which is apparently Solusek Ro temple people. I am now indif<br/>\ncompared to my old &quot;amiable&quot;. A Guide who was around at the time noticed<br/>\nthis, and as a joke, hailed the efreeti about 15 times. This resulted in the<br/>\nwhole room attacking the guide, and the guide had to suicide the whole room<br/>\nof NPCs. Interesting tidbit I thought. He also promised me a dynamic quest<br/>\nfor gnomes coming up.<br/>\n_______<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can only hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nMorty<br/>\nGnome Necromancer on E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
