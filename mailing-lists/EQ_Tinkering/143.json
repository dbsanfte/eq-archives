How do they expect people to make money at trades?  With static<br/>\n&gt; orbs costing about 1 pp, there is no way to make a reasonable profit given<br/>\n&gt; that you must also buy pie tins and skewers.  Yes, you can try to make the<br/>\n&gt; pie tins and skewers but how many people are masters at pottery,<br/>\n&gt; blacksmithing, and tinkering?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, rest assured, I will be sending /feedback to them on this subject.  I<br/>\n&gt; bet the next thing I will hear is that store bought cams are cheaper than<br/>\n&gt; tinkered cams.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 03:00 PM 07/06/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Apple&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scraple@...\">scraple@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Greetings Fellow Gnomes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am glad to hear that you are selling compasses at all. In many towns I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have come to there seems to be a merchant who will sell them. The merchant<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is not used often from what I can tell because they are always stuck in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;back corner. There is a merchant one in qeynos by the docks. if you walk out<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of Fishes ale and go to the docks you will see a tall building on your right<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and a merchant sitting in the middle of a counter that goes in a circle<br/>\n&gt; &gt;around him.. He sells compasses for 2pp and it seems to cost us 3pp to make.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyone else see a problem with this? I for one think that the vendors should<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be selling there compasses for around 7pp. That gives us some nice room to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;work. I have also seen compasses for sale in the High Elf City and Halas<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for 2pp).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Klade<br/>\n&gt; &gt;A Magician of Povar<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Check out this week&#39;s ONElist of the week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
