Sure you get em sold, and it is a way <br/>\nof keeping &quot;afloat&quot; as those who have plat to spare want to sell em off as <br/>\nfast as they can to tinker more. I am at the stage where I can do <br/>\nrebreathers, but I fail a LOT still. Some ppl on my server has been selling <br/>\noff rebreathers from 7-10kpp which is defenitly too much IMO. I was <br/>\nauctioning them for 3.5k which I thought was too low but I thought was the <br/>\ngoin price, now ppl tell me to sell them for no less than 5kp, so that is <br/>\nwhat I will charge for them, might go down to 4 or 4.5 if they buy more than <br/>\none, or return me an aqualung as a part deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a 50% failure rate, a rebreather would cost 1900p to make, at least for <br/>\nme, if you succeed on both lungs, sell em for 2500 and you make a measly <br/>\n600p profit. I have skill of 118 now, and it cost me nearly 28k to get there <br/>\n(i know, i have been doin something wrong somewhere probably, eheh) and with <br/>\na 600p profit on each rebreather I&#39;ll never get that money back. I think 5kp <br/>\nfor a rebreather is a decent price...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sandortien<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
