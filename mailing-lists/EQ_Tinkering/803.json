Heard a <br/>\nrumor under waves...That could be any body of water..(Taalk about the <br/>\nproverbial Needle in the haystack...Sheesh!!)..I also Heard  that as simple <br/>\nto get for a level 1 barbarian can do.....Hmmm ...Halas??? Well if you are a <br/>\nNew player in Halas with a barbarian whats the places you would explore to <br/>\nhave fun without getting killed too easy........The lake in front is one area <br/>\nthat has water....How about the bottom of the well there??...Has anyone <br/>\nreally sayed long enough in it to exlpore it extensively?? And  Barbarians <br/>\nwouldnt see much in the well cause they have poor vision and once established <br/>\nnot going anywere it would be abandoned in looking into? Just a <br/>\nthought...there is quite a few little areas in the game that have simple <br/>\nsmall areas of water that could be overlooked because they seem be part of <br/>\nthe eye candy of the scenery.....Like a fountain of blood in Crushbone  or <br/>\nseveral areas of water in CB<br/>\nthat seem to lead nowhere....Or just Consider this ...that the tinkering is <br/>\nscrewed up till they patch it to make it better.....I for one have had it in <br/>\nscowering searches for this book.....So...unless i come across it by accident <br/>\nor given the info ....I will have no more concern for tinkering except the <br/>\ncasual cam or compass to make for friend....Sincerely,   Cloverleaf &lt;Fennin <br/>\nRo server&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
