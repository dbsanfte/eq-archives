First off, what you<br/>\nsaw was not the Gnomish Fireworks that can (hopefully soon) be tinkered. <br/>\nYou saw the spell Fireworks3 (that I&#39;m assuming a GM cast) which was a<br/>\nmagician spell but was removed from the game due it&#39;s graphic-intensive<br/>\neffects that added a lot of lag to a zone.  Gnomish Fireworks are actually<br/>\npretty lame in comparison to the light show you saw.  Gnomish Fireworks<br/>\nproduce the effect of Fireworks1, the lowest form of this spell and<br/>\nconsists of a small orangish fireball to shoot from your hands (almost<br/>\nlooks like a bottle rocket on fire). It also appears to only shoots<br/>\nforward and not into the air (I could be mistaken about this).  The<br/>\n&quot;fireworks&quot; will not cause any damage and essentially they will be used<br/>\nfor weddings, special occassions, reunions, celebrations and anytime else<br/>\nyou want to have a &quot;fancy&quot; lightshow.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m guessing you want to now where I got this info from.  Just to be<br/>\nclear on this I can not tinker them nor do I know the recipe (wish I did<br/>\nthough).  I have one Gnomish Fireworks that was given to me by a GM on my<br/>\nserver, since they really are just a novelty item anyways.  (Oh and btw: <br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that&#39;s where everyone else is getting their &quot;tinkered&quot; goods<br/>\nfrom as certain GM&#39;s can summon up any item in the game at will - if this<br/>\nis the case then some GM&#39;s might be abusing their powers by supplying<br/>\nfriends with tinkered goods to sell).  If you want to see what the item<br/>\nlooks like, fell free to msg me in game and I&#39;ll show it to you. (but I&#39;m<br/>\nnot setting it off yet - however I might advertise a minor event where us<br/>\nGnomes on Mith Marr can all get together one day and discuss tinkering &quot;in<br/>\nperson&quot; and use the fireworks as the &quot;Grand Finale&quot; - perhaps we could<br/>\neven invite the GM&#39;s and let them know our discontent with the state of<br/>\ntinkering.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter questioning the GM further on the state of tinkering, he had no clue<br/>\nwhether the third book existed or not.  However I do have the GM&#39;s e-mail<br/>\naddress and I intend on asking him a variety of questions.  If there are<br/>\nany particular questions you would like ask, please let me know and I&#39;ll<br/>\nforward them on to the GM.
