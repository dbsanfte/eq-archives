Example: you are in a mall and you happen to <br/>\nsee, say, a golden chain. you dont need a golden chain but are intrigued by <br/>\nit so you check it out. $200! you say. &quot;HELL NO.&quot; you think. &quot;too much.&quot; <br/>\ni.e. customer walks away and sale is not made.  ok. same scenario..you are <br/>\nin a mall and you happen to see, say, a golden chain. you dont need a golden <br/>\nchain but are intrigued by it so you check it out. $80. &quot;wow. thas a good <br/>\nprice!&quot; ok. FIRST OFF, the customer, who didnt even need a golden chain in <br/>\nthe first place is ALREADY considering the purchase. this would not be the <br/>\ncase if the price were, oh, say $200.  the customer would have disregarded <br/>\nthe purchase right away because high prices are a turn -off.  yur already <br/>\nhalfway to a sale! congrats! so, say you offer something else that makes the <br/>\nsale almost unresistable ( time for you to get creative..i wont divulge my <br/>\nown methods). now the customer is almost ready to buy the item...he/she is <br/>\nalready considering the money they have in his/her pocket and, basically <br/>\ntalking themselves into buying said merchandise (ppl do this all the time, <br/>\nthey tell themselves it is a GREAT deal and they prolly wont find it ever <br/>\nagain..etc..etc) now for people skills. if yur good, the sale is complete, <br/>\nand you walk away with money in your pocket, as well as a satisfied <br/>\ncustomer. does this sound logical? ok, now take the prices i used, divide by <br/>\n2, and multiply by 10. Voila! Cest-Magifique! (my price vs these (fill in <br/>\nderogatory name here) suggested retail price)<br/>\nbtw... i HIGHLY encourage ppl on Veeshan (Askur&#39;s server), Zinken&#39;s server, <br/>\nand Gagaliya&#39;s server and show these &quot;buisness experts&quot; just how you can <br/>\nvery easily:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.)create a loyal customer base<br/>\n2.)make many ppl VERY happy/satisfied<br/>\n3.)make plenty of cash to tinker on<br/>\n4.)how to flatline your opponent&#39;s (in this case one of the 3 said arses) <br/>\nTinkering income.<br/>\n<br/>\ntake care honest gnomes out there.<br/>\n-Ranth Rathan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
