Keep in mind it was 4AM<br/>\nand I was running on nothing but Mountain Dew so if they sound ridiculous<br/>\nplease forgive me.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

I know it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make any sense to use something called a GEM cutter on a metal bar,<br/>\nbut this is Verant we&#39;re talking about after all.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  An expensive possibility but has anyone tried putting a gemcutter and a<br/>\ngem(probably a pearl judging by the recipe book) in a jeweler&#39;s kit without<br/>\na metal bar and seeing what happens?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
