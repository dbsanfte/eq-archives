I think<br/>\nI&#39;l keep the excel format of the database though, just as a tribute to all<br/>\nthose who tried or emailed me or submitted info in one way or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was disappointed in the fireworks to, I mean, one little teeny tiny PFFT<br/>\nand thats it?  I guess if you have 20 or 30 people and they all go PFFT at<br/>\nthe same time that might be kind of nice, but I&#39;d be embarassed to show up<br/>\nat a wedding, promise everyone a gnomish fireworks display, and all I get<br/>\nis a PFFT.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I got my pole, and after 3 attempts I got a spyglass, so I&#39;m a happy<br/>\ngnome now, I&#39;ll tinker myself some bait and go fishing at the pool in<br/>\nqeynos.  Maybe I&#39;ll get lucky and fish up a Kiolindl fish.  heh heh<br/>\n<br/>\nRotgut<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso known as Pahbi of Solusek Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
