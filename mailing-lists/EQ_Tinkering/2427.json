The next major item I&#39;d like to make for myself is the<br/>\n&gt; Footwarming boots.  Apparently the trivial for footwarming is around the<br/>\n168<br/>\n&gt; mark.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At what skill level will I have like a 25% chance of even accomplishing<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; item?  Obviously I&#39;ll continue making Powered Gloves until the trivial<br/>\nmark<br/>\n&gt; at 122, and then trying aqualungs.  Aqualungs&#39;s trivial is 148, which<br/>\ntakes<br/>\n&gt; me close to the ~168 trivial of Footwarming boots.  However, I&#39;d like to<br/>\ntry<br/>\n&gt; the boots earlier on if there&#39;s a chance for success.  However, I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow<br/>\n&gt; the formula for a chance of success being &quot;x&quot; number of skill points away<br/>\n&gt; from the trivial point of the item you&#39;re trying to tinker.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Soooooo....  I&#39;m at 102 now.  What skill level can I being trying to make<br/>\n&gt; Footwarming boots with somewhere around a 25% chance of success?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone have any idea?
