He was only on for a bit (at least i only saw him <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;a bit) he was talking to a friend whos name I forget and said he was gonna<br/>\n&gt;go play his gnome. So he does have a gnome char and his name spelling is<br/>\n&gt;Lindell. thats all I know. if its the same lindel/lindell..
