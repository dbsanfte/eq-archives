Can&#39;t remember<br/>\nclass or race. When I was in the cave (at level 13 maybe), I was just<br/>\nkilling a few ice boned skeletons. Someone said he had killed a level 22<br/>\nranger in seconds. Might be tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou find the cave by entering the river by a hole in the ice near Megan&#39;s<br/>\ntower. Then swim north (left) until you come to the mountains (if you are a<br/>\ndecent swimmer you will need no artificial breathing). There you will find<br/>\nthe cave.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might go there myself. Just rarely play any more...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZaltil [on Innoruuk]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
