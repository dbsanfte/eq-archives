There is a good chance that if it is in the game, that it <br/>\nmight contain the recipe for the scuba gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyone with a clue tell me, is the 3rd book really in the game and the <br/>\ngeneral public just not found it yet? Or does it not even exist.<br/>\nThanx,<br/>\nFizzWizz of tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
