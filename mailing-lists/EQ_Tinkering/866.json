He&#39;s a gnome cleric<br/>\n(Level 49) guide.  I asked him about tinkering and he said it wasn&#39;t fully<br/>\nimplemented.  I asked him if he tinkered and he said no, that basically because<br/>\nit was broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n***The following are my opinions, nothing to do with what the guide said ****<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that maybe the guy with the recipes got some inside information.  I<br/>\nalso suspect once they fix whatever the problem is, a third book will appear in<br/>\nthe windmills or the existing books will change carrying additional<br/>\ninformation.  I bet the third book contains, animated bait, firewater,<br/>\ncollapsible fishing pole and quite possibly gnomish fireworks.  Its quite likely<br/>\nthat they can&#39;t get the gnomish fireworks worked out right (balancing issues) so<br/>\nthey haven&#39;t released the book.  That&#39;s my thoughts, I won&#39;t try until I see the<br/>\nrecipes :|<br/>\n<br/>\nMadix/Atinky/Wildipus<br/>\nBristlebane Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
