I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-760523975\">Well here is my thought. Has any one Tried a Re-enforced leather Cloak? I<br/>\nknow it sounds a little far Fetched, BUT that Cloak has Metal Strips sewn<br/>\ninto it. I think since you guys are try your best to figure this out that<br/>\nyou should look at it from every angle. I know it says Tattered Gnomes<br/>\nCloak, but who is to say that it does not turn into one once you use the<br/>\nRe-enforced Cloak? Well I thought I would through my 2cp in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh Before I forget, Has any one tried to tailor one with a Ruined Wolf Pelt,<br/>\nCloak Pattern & maybe the Metal Rods? Maybe try Tailoring & then Tinkering.<br/>\nWhat I would think would be that the Cloak would be Tailored then Take the<br/>\ncloak, a Belt of some type, & Firewater & then combine them in a Toolbox to<br/>\nget the final Product. Or take the Pelt, Cloak Pattern, Rods, Belt, &<br/>\nFirewater & combine it all in the Toolkit. Cause to me it is saying with the<br/>\nRods in the Cloak it HAS to be done with the Pattern & not a Finished<br/>\nProduct, just like the Re-enforced leather.<br/>\n<br/>\nBattlestaff Fuzzietoe, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n40th Ranked Druid of Karana<br/>\nMaster Brewer, Master Baker, Master Potter, Master Fletcher<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BobbiS7@...\">BobbiS7@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BobbiS7@...\">BobbiS7@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 07, 2000 12:35 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Tinkering] Thermal Cloak ideas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI failed on my two attempts to make a mechanized lockpick<br/>\n(I only had 2 lockpicks).
