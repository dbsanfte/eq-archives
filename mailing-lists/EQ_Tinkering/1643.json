I had a bit of time on my hands, and needed some fish<br/>\nto practice cooking, so I decided to put it to the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tinkered up 40 animated baits.  Then I gated back to Freeport, bought 40<br/>\nbaits from the store, sat on the dock, and started fishing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results?  No difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the breakdown:<br/>\n<br/>\n40 STORE-BOUGHT BAIT<br/>\nCasts:                   115<br/>\nFish caught:              38<br/>\nScales/sandals/daggers:   10<br/>\nBeer spilled:             18<br/>\nBait lost:                 2<br/>\n<br/>\n40 TINKERED BAIT<br/>\nCasts:                   121<br/>\nFish caught:              38<br/>\nScales/sandals/daggers:   13<br/>\nBeer spilled:             13<br/>\nBait lost:                 2<br/>\n<br/>\nEach cast also took 11 or 12 seconds for each bait.  My fishing skill was<br/>\npreviously maxed at 70.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe D</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
