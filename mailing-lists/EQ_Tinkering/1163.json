Have a 39 shaman <br/>\nfriend who traded for an earring, couldn&#39;t get it personally a MAJOR favtion <br/>\nhit against Barbarians... and which race has most shamen? <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has used the earring and is talking obscene amounts of trade for it. It <br/>\nhas really become a need to have item with new quests. I&#39;m talking thousands <br/>\nhere. Work it out... 8 hour spwan 1 in 4 drop thats 1 earring every 24 hours <br/>\nIF you dont mind the BAD hit. The place was never camped whenever I passed it <br/>\nbefore, near Surefell Glade, bet it is now. <br/>\n<br/>\nTime for me to get going on my tinkering skill have neglected it waiting for <br/>\nit to work and avoid the frustrations but one of the reasons I chose gnomes <br/>\nin the first place, makes us stand apart from the rest of the reaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nStay Safe.....
