It mentioned somethin bout a clockwork <br/>\n  dragon, now the dragon, I don&#39;t believe, not by a longhshot. But it also <br/>\n  mentioned one of those lamp, star light post things, and when ya click it, it <br/>\n  makes a door opening sound and turns 90 degrees. I thought that it was worth <br/>\n  2 seconds investigation, so I found the one that wasn&#39;t soinning next to the <br/>\n  lake. I clicked it, and sure enough, it turned bout 90 degrees, and I heard <br/>\n  the door creak. I have no idea what this is about, knowing my luck, this <br/>\n  little topic has popped up on the list before, but I&#39;m a recent addition to <br/>\n  it. If it has, GOOD! someone please fill me in and quench my curiosity. If it <br/>\n  hasn&#39;t, anyone have any ideas what it is, cause who knows, what if it has <br/>\n  valid importance, this is a long shot, but it may have somethin to with <br/>\n  diamond dust. I know I know, there&#39;s a bunch of you thinking I&#39;m prime full <br/>\n  of it, but about the little door creak and star lamp thing, I&#39;m not, I invite <br/>\n  you to see it yourself. Anyways, I jus thought I&#39;d toss that one out there. <br/>\n  If it&#39;s been brought up before, forgive me for my insolence.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yigoron,<br/>\n  30 Magician,<br/>\n  Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
