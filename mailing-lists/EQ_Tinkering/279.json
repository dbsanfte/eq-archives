This is just my guess but maybe I was <br/>\nthinking that the collapsable ones weighed less or maybe couldn&#39;t break.  <br/>\nThey would have to have some improvement over the regular ones right now... <br/>\nbut being able to fit in backpacks wouldn&#39;t be it.

A<br/>\n&gt;telescope works similar to a ranger (?) spell (can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;remember the name of it).  It essentially &#39;zooms&#39; the<br/>\n&gt;screen so that you can see things farther away from<br/>\n&gt;you that you normally couldn&#39;t see.  (Is that train of<br/>\n&gt;orcs still chasing me? Hmm better try the telescope.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The collaspable fishing rod is just a regular fishing<br/>\n&gt;pole that will fit in your bakpack - as it stands now,<br/>\n&gt;a normal fishingpole you buy at a merchant will not<br/>\n&gt;fit into any pack making it cumbersome to bring with<br/>\n&gt;you on the road.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Quasinom de Plume of Ak&#39;anon<br/>\n&gt;Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any news on exactly what they do or their stats<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now that they are really here?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
