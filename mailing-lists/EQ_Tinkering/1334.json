Greed has nothing to do with <br/>\n&gt; running a business. The point of trading skill is for max profit. 100pp for <br/>\n&gt; spyglass is the going rate, I sold many and none of them are idiots. As for <br/>\n&gt; the Aqua Lung I sold about 9 so far at 650pp each, although 1000pp is a bit <br/>\n&gt; at the higher end if anyone can sell them then more power to him/her. And it <br/>\n&gt; is not fooling the masses, do you have any idea how much it cost to raise the <br/>\n&gt; skill to master? and even then the success rate is only 50% at best. Next <br/>\n&gt; time try to know what you are talking about before opening that little hole <br/>\n&gt; of yours. Lastly I am proud to be a gnome, and it&#39;s people like you who is <br/>\n&gt; ruining us gnomes. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gagaliya Ba&#39;La&#39;Boom<br/>\n&gt; Master Tinker<br/>\n&gt; Lev 40 wiz<br/>\n&gt; The Claw of Nagafan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;thank ye kindly for insulting my intelligence.  paying 1k for a <br/>\n&gt; Lung....congratulations on fooling the masses.  personnaly i think it is <br/>\n&gt; taking advantage of ppl.  the return i get far outweighs my expenses, and i <br/>\n&gt; am selling them faster than i can make em.  as for all gnomes who sell <br/>\n&gt; scopes for 100 plat...HAHAHA. wow, you must find the stupidest ppl in the <br/>\n&gt; world to pull that scam off.  personally, i am kind of disgusted that so <br/>\n&gt; many ppl here are so greedy. i have never before been disgusted to be a <br/>\n&gt; gnome...but there is a first time for everything i guess.<br/>\n&gt; -&quot;Honest&quot; Ranth Rathan, Affordable Tinkerer Extraoridnaire&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
