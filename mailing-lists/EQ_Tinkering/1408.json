Before the skill<br/>\ncap for jewelry was about 250-300 I think. But I know for sure it was able<br/>\nto go above 200. So what happened is that people could make more plat items<br/>\nbecause of less failures and lowerprices. They didn&#39;t like all the plat<br/>\nitems going around so they nerfed the skill to a 200 cap. So now it takes<br/>\n10-15 tries to make the higher end plat jewelery.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you do try to make rebreathers or aqualungs try to get your wis as high<br/>\nas possable because thats the stats that helps you fail less.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dave<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:35 PM 11/23/99 -0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just to let ya know my Tinkering Skill is at 125<br/>\n&gt;and neither the Aqualung or the Rebreather is Trivial at that lvl.<br/>\n&gt;The fail rate has not seemed to change much either.<br/>\n&gt;With a Int or 200 and Wis of 145 I still fail 40% of the time on the <br/>\n&gt;aqualungs and 60 to 70 % on the rebreathers.
