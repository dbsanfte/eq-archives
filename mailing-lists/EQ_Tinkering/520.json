Listen well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I do know something. I took all my knowledge, everything I know, used all <br/>\n&gt;the common sense I have, and was able to talk my way into a clue from a <br/>\n&gt;person that knows all about the fishing poles. At first I thought whoever <br/>\n&gt;knew about it was selfish, that they had no right to keep this, but then <br/>\n&gt;when I found out that this group of people worked hard for what they had <br/>\n&gt;found, and are very secrective about it, don&#39;t deserve their secret to be <br/>\n&gt;given away. I mean, THEY are the ones that found the secret, and yes it is a <br/>\n&gt;secret, so why is it that they should just go off and tell everyone? This <br/>\n&gt;game is all about exploration and finding things, and having fun. Thats what <br/>\n&gt;they did, and they found something, so why shouldn&#39;t you have to do the same <br/>\n&gt;thing that they did? Why should you just sit back and happily profit from <br/>\n&gt;all thier work? This group, whom is a very secretive group, whom I shall not <br/>\n&gt;name, worked hard to get what they know, and so I&#39;m not going to go giving <br/>\n&gt;away the clue I was told, especially after the rude, immature, derogatory <br/>\n&gt;comments that were made about me. I will tell you this though. Waste not a <br/>\n&gt;plat more on trying combinations. You are not only wasting your money, but <br/>\n&gt;you are wasting your time. Search the world, high and low, search the world <br/>\n&gt;above and below...<br/>\n&gt;This is all I will say. It&#39;s been nice being part of this list. I though you <br/>\n&gt;were a bunch of decent people. Your coments have changed my mind. I will no <br/>\n&gt;longer be a part of this list as you wish. It&#39;s been fun guys, and thanks <br/>\n&gt;for all the fish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sniffledoo Copperheart 18th Common Squire of The Scarlet Blade<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See ya.. take your secrets with you... you don&#39;t know anything and I&#39;m glad<br/>\nto see one more troll gone.
