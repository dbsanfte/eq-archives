There&#39;s no reason not to<br/>\nshare this information other then to make us mad.  It&#39;s not like they&#39;re<br/>\nprofiting off this information.  The knowledge for the other trade skills<br/>\nare always shared immediately.  Like when the new silk and cured silk was<br/>\nintroduced, the word was spread in days.  And people are making a lot of<br/>\nmoney from making the silk armor.  (I&#39;ve personally made over 600pp selling<br/>\nsuits of cured silk armor to high level monks) Yet this tinkering info must<br/>\nhave been around for months yet the few people who know won&#39;t tell anyone<br/>\nelse even tho there&#39;s no profit to be made in making a collapseable fishing<br/>\npole.  *sighs*<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the people who know where to get this book were on the Erollisi Marr<br/>\nserver, I&#39;d gladly offer 100pp for the book (maybe more), just because it<br/>\ndrives me nuts not knowing.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\ngr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n&quot;Linux... find out what you&#39;ve been missing while<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been rebooting Windows NT&quot; - Infoworld<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Ralph Scott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rscott@...\">rscott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Michael Ott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mott@...\">mott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the necro is not the way to go neiter is the spelunker...<br/>\n&gt; And you know this how?? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
