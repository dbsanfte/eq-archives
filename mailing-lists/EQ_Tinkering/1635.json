You have rekindled my interest in tinkering.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Haxtonia Firewater, Wayward Gnomish Mage (Mith Marr)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Brian Nelson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rock-on@...\">rock-on@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   As far as skill cap goes, I&#39;ll just let you all know that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it USED to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; capped at (level - 15) * 5. But Verant has recently either<br/>\n&gt; &gt; removed the skill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cap or changed it. How do I know this? Because I have been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level 30 for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about a month and a half now, and I have been tinkering a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whole lot in that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time. I was stuck for the longest time at 75 skill. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just think I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuck, I know I was because I made over 150 spyglasses after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was already<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at 75 skill and I didn&#39;t get a single skill point increase. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was selling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the spyglasses for between 70pp and 100pp and I sold over 150 of them,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; making me become one of the richest level 30 players I know.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t care<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much about the skill cap or being able to make aqualungs or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; even leveling, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was raking in the dough and that was all that I cared about.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well last week<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while I was making more spyglasses to sell my skill level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suddenly increased<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to 76 and I was completely astonished! I then proceeded to spend a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thousand platinum on spyglasses and stalking probes and a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; painstaking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hours later I was a master tinkerer. My skill is now 103 and I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attempted 6 aqualungs. I have made 3 out of those 6 attempts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   In my experience, I believe it is possible that tinkering MAY now be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; capped at Level * 5 - 13 (maybe not), but it used to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; capped at (level -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 15) * 5. I do know though that it is no longer capped at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (level - 15) * 5.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brillian<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 30 Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
