I have found<br/>\nbook XXXIII and it has:<br/>\n<br/>\nAqua Lung<br/>\nRe-Breather   (Aqua Lung with a longer duration)<br/>\nGemCutter     (Not sure what it is, but I think Jewelers will be happy with<br/>\nus!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI *WILL* be giving out the formulas, but I wanted to make some of the items<br/>\nto sell first.  I do have a &#39;deal&#39; if anyone wants the formulas early.  I<br/>\nwant to make these items, but I&#39;m low on cash and need a money backer.  If<br/>\nsomeone is willing to back me, I&#39;ll give them the formula, but with the<br/>\ncosts of even trying it, it will need a LOT of cash.  I plan on releasing<br/>\nall of them no later then December 1st (basically a month).<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent pages 1 and 2 to Gnomad to prove I have the book (and he can post it<br/>\nif he likes, it only shows one part of what you need.  I do not suggest just<br/>\nthrowing things into our toolbox, it uses items that are NOT tinker items<br/>\n(like fireworks used batwings) so you will never just guess it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEstimated costs are about 200 for aqualung, about 500 - 600 for the<br/>\nrebreather, and I&#39;m not sure on the GemCutter as it needs a part I have<br/>\nnever seen or heard of, but I think about 100-200 plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd GNOME, these things are expensive! Especially the rebreather.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-  Original message   -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Date: 31 Oct 1999 07:16:56 -0000<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sragan@...\">sragan@...</a><br/>\nSubject: combos I have tried for &#39;scuba gear&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are failures...<br/>\n<br/>\n1 Fastener<br/>\n1 Fish Scale<br/>\n1 Rod<br/>\n1 Bolts<br/>\n1 Gear<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\n1 Fastener<br/>\n1 fish scale<br/>\n1 Shaft<br/>\n1 bolts<br/>\n1 sprocket<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------<br/>\n1 Fastener<br/>\n1 fish scale<br/>\n1 Rod<br/>\n1 bolt<br/>\n1 sprocket<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\n1 fastener<br/>\n1 Fish scale<br/>\n1 shaft<br/>\n1 bolt<br/>\n1 twine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe series here is a combo of 5 with a fish scale,a fastener and 3 other<br/>\ncomponents.<br/>\nHelp me finish this series out by trying some of the other components at the<br/>\nmills and letting folks here know<br/>\n what you have failed on.
