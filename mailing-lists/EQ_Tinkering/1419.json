I nervously double clicked the fireworks (pressed f9 to get the best view) and phffff a little tiny poof of what i think it was color -- it was so damn quick and small i couldn&#39;t make out what had happened -- Verant come on geeze what would it take to make it at least look a little bit like fireworks. when you cast a spell you have beautiful colors and displays and then there is what you give the Gnome tinkering. dont give us a skill and make us look stupid by not having it do anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGnorm / level 34 / Cleric / Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
