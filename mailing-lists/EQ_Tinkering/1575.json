This will come out with the same number as another formula that someone on the list mentioned (lvl-16) x 5 plus 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the chart would go something like this<br/>\n<br/>\nLVL     SKILL<br/>\n29      75<br/>\n31      80<br/>\n32      85<br/>\n33      90<br/>\n34      95<br/>\n35      100<br/>\n36      105<br/>\n37      110<br/>\n38      115<br/>\n39      120<br/>\n40      125<br/>\netc...<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, there have been rumors that the cap might have been removed, its just like those Verant Bastards not to let us know in a patch message. At 40 my skill is only 115, so I am not sure if I will run into a wall at 125 or not. Probably by the time my skill gets 125 tho I will be a few levels higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is this, if your find yourself spending an inordinate amount of plat trying to get your skill up and its still not raising (and I&#39;m talking about 3 to 4 times the normal amount for a skill point) , check this chart, you may have hit the skill cap. If your skill per level is above the numbers in this chart, then its possible that the cap has been either changed or removed.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nFizzWizz of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
