HOWEVER!  The gnome sells<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; component called a metal disk.  Why?  This sounds like a tinkering item<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; why would this islolated gnome sell this?  Is it a hint of some sort?  I<br/>\n&gt; questioned the gnome at length and could get no information from him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The minotaur in the zoo of akanon, I killed this minotaur and lost<br/>\n&gt; faction<br/>\n&gt; with the king of akanon, someone went through the trouble of giving this<br/>\n&gt; one particular minotaur good faction with gnomes, why?  Was it a<br/>\n&gt; technical<br/>\n&gt; reason, to keep him from attacking newbie gnomes or is it related to the<br/>\n&gt; story in the tinkering book about Gimblestan bringing back a minotaur to<br/>\n&gt; the zoo?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A third book is a possibility, its also possible that someone just<br/>\n&gt; happened<br/>\n&gt; to have some cork and a spriket left over and thought what the hell...<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; trash two items in one click and be done with it.  But instead they<br/>\n&gt; found<br/>\n&gt; something new to make.  It is amazing, however, that the thousands and<br/>\n&gt; thousands of people out there who search for quests, search for new<br/>\n&gt; things<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t stumbled upon this third book though.  Considering how obscure<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; quests and some items are, this third book must be REALLY obscure.  But<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; could be out there!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Solusek gnomes seems like a good place to try to learn about tinkering<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; I intend to go there at level 24.  Being an enchanter, I&#39;m told that<br/>\n&gt; monsters won&#39;t bother me if I&#39;m in elemental illusion, so maybe I can<br/>\n&gt; check<br/>\n&gt; the place out and get lucky, who knows.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t fished with animated bait yet, but I think its likely that it<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; a component in a recipie, maybe for the collapsable pole.  Either that<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; it may be a quest item or maybe it has some better fishing abilities. <br/>\n&gt; No<br/>\n&gt; tests have really been done to see that I know of.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And the collapsable pole has one very good use, if you do fish a lot,<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; pole never breaks, it only weighs .1 lbs, and can be stored in small<br/>\n&gt; containers.  Those are some fairly nice benifits to it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rotgut<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How would you like to have a voice in the marketplace and be<br/>\n&gt; rewarded for it?
