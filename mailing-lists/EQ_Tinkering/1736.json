Is he 50th? Would be kida lame if <br/>\nthe info was commining from someone not capable of handling this 50 level <br/>\nNPC. i Think its alot more lower NPC than he leads it on to be.  As stated by <br/>\nanother person i seen here on Onelist, don&#39;t ever believe it till you see it <br/>\nin a trade window for yourself. I feel that .....if ......the cutter will be <br/>\nactually able to be done, the Diamond Dust component wouldn&#39;t be too far from <br/>\nthe already condenced tinkering supply location in Steamfront.  Treat this <br/>\nlike it has been told to you as...(a rumor)...Nothing more. But ,1 thing is <br/>\nfor sure is that even if you do get the dust and make the item for it...I <br/>\nwouldnt let him have it back until he gave you at least 1 dust per unit for <br/>\nyour trouble for you to keep.....Reguardless if it came out or <br/>\nnot...Especialy if he doesnt want to give you the acurate location of this <br/>\nmysterious NPC...Sincerely Cloverleaf  Lukyfeet, Gnome and Tinkerer (Fennin <br/>\nRo server)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 1/4/00 12:30:38 PM Eastern Standard Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cerceta@...\">cerceta@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cerceta@...\">cerceta@...</a><br/>\n <br/>\n OK don&#39;t get to excited but I have been asked by a fellow gnome to make<br/>\n the gemcutter. He claims he can get the diamond dust for me, but won&#39;t<br/>\n give up the npc that drops it. He claims that the npc is 50th level and <br/>\n that the diamond dust is a rare drop item off it. I am thinking that this<br/>\n could mean that the npc may be in the planes but that is merley speculation.<br/>\n I wish he would give up the info but he is keeping it hidden from all for<br/>\n another gnome. Well i hope this gives all you tinkerers hope:) Has anyone <br/>\n discovered what the formula is for the Thermal Cloak? Where can i aquire <br/>\n tattered belts?
