To my knowledge, they&#39;ve never<br/>\ndeleted an inactive character over level 1 (most pay services don&#39;t, to keep<br/>\npeople coming back), but keep in mind that they reserve the right to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re still _paying_ for your EQ subscription, they&#39;ll keep your<br/>\ncharacters (over level 1, at least) for an unlimited time even if you don&#39;t<br/>\nplay. Even when they deleted the level 1 characters, it was only ones that<br/>\nhadn&#39;t been played in an extremely long time. I believe the threshold was a<br/>\nyear of inactivity.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nEric Kenslow<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eric@...\">eric@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: jeff sikorski [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j_sikorsk@...\">j_sikorsk@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 13, 2002 1:00 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Tinkering] quick question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to play EQ a lot and still signed up to the<br/>\ntinkering newsletter, but my account hasnt been<br/>\n&#39;active&#39; in a while, i think i re-signed over last<br/>\nthanksgiving (november 2001) just to log in and<br/>\nremember the days.  I have a 45 necro and was<br/>\nwondering how long my account can be inactive until<br/>\nthey delete my character (which i dont want to<br/>\nhappen.)  I thought i read somewhere it was 3 months,<br/>\nbut I know that when i re-activated my account back in<br/>\nnovember i hadnt played in like 4-5 months and it was<br/>\nstill there...  anyone know the real answer to this, i<br/>\nwould really appreciate it :p<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nLAUNCH - Your Yahoo!
