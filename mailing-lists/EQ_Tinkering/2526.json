I&#39;d be happy to take that<br/>\noff your hands, as I&#39;m having to share my beta account with 3 other people<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to share, my email is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:osmosis@...\">osmosis@...</a> :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI played a Gnome enchanter on RZ, and so far it seems like there are some<br/>\nsimilarities in DaoC, but the enchanter class is nowhere near as<br/>\nversatile... the EQ class is spread out over several classes in Camelot.<br/>\nI&#39;m actually having the most fun playing a wizard-like character.  Chain<br/>\ncasting takes on a new level, as you can begin casting a new spell as the<br/>\nmost recent one is happening.  Excellent game, and I recommend the download.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Cogg-<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;James Leavings&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Argynt@...\">Argynt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 7:14 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] unsubscribe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;    Yes, you have to unsubscribe yourself.
