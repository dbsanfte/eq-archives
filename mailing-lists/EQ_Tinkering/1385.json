They won&#39;t tell anyone.  I&#39;ve looked<br/>\nall over too, and I can&#39;t find it.  I have heard that<br/>\nthere are NPC&#39;s who will cut/crush gems for you if you<br/>\ngive them a gem.  I don&#39;t know where these folks are<br/>\neither. <br/>\n<br/>\nTime will tell, these things will be turn up, and then<br/>\nwe&#39;ll be able to perform our trade like the other<br/>\ntradesman out there, who never have to worry about<br/>\nfinding their components.  /rude Verant<br/>\n<br/>\nGazamel Prime - Solusek Ro<br/>\nDealers of Death<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Andy Smith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AndyS@...\">AndyS@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another thought (just as expensive), perhaps you put<br/>\n&gt; the diamond in the<br/>\n&gt; toolkit by itself (or with something else), you can<br/>\n&gt; reduce it to diamond<br/>\n&gt; dust.  I&#39;d hope something like that would be trivial<br/>\n&gt; at all levels (like<br/>\n&gt; silk swatches from silk).  I mean, if you failed<br/>\n&gt; what would it produce (err,<br/>\n&gt; carbon filings?).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s more likely that the dust just isn&#39;t in<br/>\n&gt; the game yet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just a really expensive thought, but has anyone<br/>\n&gt; tried using a diamond?<br/>\n&gt; Maybe it gets turned to dust in the process.
