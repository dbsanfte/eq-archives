Go to the Island that the boat stops at on its<br/>\nway from Qeynos to Erudin.  I think thats Kerra Island.  Anyway, run along<br/>\nthe coast to your right from the dock.  You will see what looks like poles<br/>\nsticking out of the water.  Those are masts from a sunken ship.  There were<br/>\nsome green undead zombie sailors there.  Go directly out past the sunken<br/>\nboat and you will find the killer sharks.<br/>\nWarning.  I saw more than one when I was there invis last time.  And when<br/>\nmy invis poped right next to them, DOH, with my 165 swimming I didn&#39;t have<br/>\ntime to make it back to land before they got me.
