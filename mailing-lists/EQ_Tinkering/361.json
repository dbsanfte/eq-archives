You say that there is a<br/>\n&gt;certain amout of items that we can use to make it, what are you saying?<br/>\n&gt;Thats it&#39;s 13? Let&#39;s just say we decided that only 4 slots are used to make<br/>\n&gt;it, even then, you can&#39;t make any acurate calculation of the amount of<br/>\n&gt;combinations there are, I mean, I dout we will be using grease, sprockets,<br/>\n&gt;gnomish bolts, and gears to be making the fishing pole. We probably have to<br/>\n&gt;have some kind of rod or shaft too, and with your calulations, you are<br/>\n&gt;inluding various of those useless combinations, that we can probably guess<br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t make the pole. You are just going to have to face the fact that we<br/>\n&gt;just have to keep trying, or find some alternate way of learning the <br/>\n&gt;recipe,<br/>\n&gt;so no amount of calculations are going to help us much unless you aply them<br/>\n&gt;in a practical way, so you should stop wasting your time. That is all I <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;to say for now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sniffledoo Copperheart.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Xillitil of Povar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xillitil@...\">xillitil@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;oops...yer right...i was doin permutations...shoulda been divide instead <br/>\n&gt;&gt;o&#39;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;subtract...did it right on the calculator at least :)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;but since we can repeat items, i seem to recall that we don&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt;&gt;combinations or permutations...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;any slot could have any of the 13 items, regardless of the other slots, so<br/>\n&gt;&gt;we get the slightly less nice number of 13^8=815,730,721<br/>\n&gt;&gt;or if we assume, as some have suggested, that it worked with the old 4 <br/>\n&gt;&gt;slot<br/>\n&gt;&gt;toolbox, 13^4=28561 possibilities<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that sound right to those with more recent education or more convenient<br/>\n&gt;&gt;reference materials?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Xillitil/Povar<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
