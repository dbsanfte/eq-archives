They are in Lake of Rathe, but they are near the Rathe Mts zone<br/>\nentrance.  Left hand side when comming out of the water.  Ive killed lots of<br/>\nOgres in my day and these guys are still indifferent to me, so there should be<br/>\nno problem there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have talked to a GM that gave me a very cryptic response when I asked about<br/>\nDiamond Dust.  But everything I can tell leads me to believe that these Ogres<br/>\nare the ones that can make Diamonds into Diamond Dust.  If I had one Diamond I<br/>\nwould try it.  Unfortunately Diamonds just don&#39;t drop that often. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
