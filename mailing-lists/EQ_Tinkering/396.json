Yes, thats right, I elect myself to do it, why? <br/>\nWell for one thing I can get to a high level quickly. I can get a gnomish <br/>\nwarrior to level 8 in about a day or so easy, so that way I wouldn&#39;t walk up <br/>\nbeing level 1, and suspiciously ask to join. Also, I personnaly think I&#39;m <br/>\ngood at persuasion. (I mean, have any of you ever sold a book of Dischord <br/>\nfor one plat before?) I would get in swiftly, then discreetly extract the <br/>\ninformation. I&#39;d get it casually and without any suspicion. That is why I <br/>\nthink having me to do it would be the best, and quickest way. Let&#39;s not <br/>\nwaste hundereds of platinum pieces everyday, looking for a one in a million <br/>\nformula!<br/>\nCome on, who&#39;s with me!?<br/>\n<br/>\nSniffledoo Copperheart.
