On Monday, I hit 100 in tinkering, then tried 50 attempts on stalking probes without a single increase.  Prior to this, the worst number of attempts I ever<br/>\nhad for a point increase was 22 (INT 164).  Once I hit 50, I decided to /petition a guide to see if the cap had been lifted.  The response I received was that tinkering wasn&#39;t touched in the last<br/>\npatch *sighs*.  So, now I&#39;m trying to powerlevel through 35 so that I can do aqualungs.<br/>\n<br/>\nGnish,  Mage of Death<br/>\nExcellent Tinkerer, ONE freakin point from Master<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nI just read that the patch that was supposed to be this morning was actually<br/>\nalready done.  They did it when the servers were down with that Cerfnet and<br/>\nUUnet trouble.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has tried the tinkering<br/>\nskill since the patch to see if the skill cap (I think it was (Level - 15) x<br/>\n5) has been fixed yet.  I had been hoping that they would fix it in this<br/>\npatch after someone reported that a GM said they should be fixing it soon,<br/>\nmaybe even in the next patch.  If anyone knows if you can Tinker outside the<br/>\nlevel cap now please say so =)<br/>\n<br/>\nLogalog,<br/>\nVeeshan Server<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
