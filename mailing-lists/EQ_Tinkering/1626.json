Well, I thought I might as well do these remaining<br/>\nthat I had bought components for, so I clicked combine, and imagine my<br/>\nsurprise when it said I had gained skill 56...<br/>\nAccording to the formula mentioned before [(lvl - 15)*5] I could only tinker<br/>\nto 55...<br/>\nAnyway, as a happy little gnome I rushed to the bank to recover all my<br/>\nsavings so that I could tinker more things, and when I ran out of funds I<br/>\nhad hit 69 in skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust sold all the cams I made, and will hopefully be off tinkering again<br/>\ntonight...<br/>\n<br/>\n/Tmira Ahrimth - Gnome Enchantress on Bristlebain<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Brian Nelson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rock-on@...\">rock-on@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: den 17 december 1999 01:51<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Tinkering] Skill Cap<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Brian Nelson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rock-on@...\">rock-on@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   As far as skill cap goes, I&#39;ll just let you all know that it USED to be<br/>\n&gt; capped at (level - 15) * 5.
