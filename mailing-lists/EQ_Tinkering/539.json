I<br/>\n&gt;really was being pathetically immature, I guess it was just becuase I had<br/>\n&gt;just gotten a clue, that really helps the discovery or the pole. You see it<br/>\n&gt;would clear up alot, but I don&#39;t wish to tell because, I swore to the one<br/>\n&gt;who told me the clue that I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone what it was that he said,<br/>\n&gt;and I don&#39;t want to dishonor him, or myself. They hold this secret pretty<br/>\n&gt;close to thier hearts, and take it pretty seriously. I didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt;decieve this person. I can, when I want to, use words with the most<br/>\n&gt;excellent of skill, like when I got a clue from the guy that part of this<br/>\n&gt;unknown organization, and I can also be a jerk and come off sounding like <br/>\n&gt;an<br/>\n&gt;8 year old troll, as you have learned, well I&#39;m sorry, and I hope you can<br/>\n&gt;understand why I feel that I must keep my knowledge a secret for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have not been reading these messages have you?  Get your head out of <br/>\nyour ass.  I will state this YET AGAIN because certain blockheads like you <br/>\ndon&#39;t seem to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTHING on Everquest remains a secret, PERIOD.  With over 100,000 active <br/>\nplayers, and a very finite world size, there is just no way anyone can keep <br/>\nanything hidden from the rest of the playerbase for long periods of time.  A <br/>\nyear from now, your actions will seem futile and pointless.  I don&#39;t know <br/>\nwhy you are trying to maintain a roleplaying tone to your responses, but <br/>\nplease refrain.  We aren&#39;t in the game, and &quot;keeping your word&quot; with someone <br/>\nwho seems to be amazingly more anal than you is laughable.  Verant has <br/>\nreally done a disservice to the tinkerers out there by either hiding key <br/>\ninformation inappropriately or simply not implementing or implementing it <br/>\nincorrectly.  All you do is support their inept creative team and obviously <br/>\ndon&#39;t support the people on this list.  You gain nothing by providing us <br/>\nwith your &quot;information&quot;, so please leave, as you have been asked several <br/>\ntimes already.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat means STOP RESPONDING.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a different note, I verified the &quot;animated bait&quot; recipe, it is very cheap <br/>\nto make, and isn&#39;t trivial at skill 50.  But, I still haven&#39;t learned <br/>\ntinkering at all.  At least this is cheaper, at only 4cp a pop.  But, like <br/>\nother &quot;amazing&quot; tinker inventions, I have yet to find a reasonable use for <br/>\nit that can&#39;t be duplicated by store-bought items or mob drops.<br/>\n<br/>\nflameless lantern = crappy lightstone<br/>\ncompass = store-bought compass and trivial to everyone<br/>\nfirewater = component for random junk and trivial to everyone<br/>\nmechanized lockpicks = how many locks have you seen?<br/>\nthermal cloak = who&#39;s gonna wear it?<br/>\nanimated bait = who fishes as a profession?<br/>\n<br/>\ncams = useful!<br/>\nspyglass = useful?<br/>\ncollapsible fishing pole = the reason for this list<br/>\n<br/>\nI have missed some stuff, and obviously tinkered things exist out there that <br/>\nwe haven&#39;t seen yet (like the recently-introduced bait).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be very upset if that &quot;third book&quot; resided in an area that made it <br/>\ndifficult, if not impossible, for tinkers below level 35 to attain.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhenglei of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;             Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt;Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
