My main char is a druid and I can tell you I can get about 40 fish scales in about 10 minutes, plus I hear magicians will be able to summon water stones, so what is the point of having a aqua lung? until I see evidence otherwise (the rebreather upgrade eliminating the charges), this is just another bite in the ass for tinkering, Just like the 5 charges on stalking probes, now who would wanna buy an item with 5 charges? nobody. the spyglass is the only decent item that tinkers can make and even then its not so great, its only good for going to OOT and scoping out the other islands (to check if sentry xyrin is there). I am also a smith, so I know what you guys are going through, the items we make we cant even GIVE away, much less try to sell to make any profit. <br/>\n<br/>\nLvythn<br/>\nDruid of Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
