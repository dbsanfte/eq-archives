Its unknown if they will raise the Tinkering Cap to 250 with this<br/>\npatch. (When they raise the others) Or if they will wait to raise the cap<br/>\nuntill they overhaul the whole skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it stands now once you hit 104 you pretty much are SOL unless you have<br/>\nmoney to burn.  The only thing that can get you skill at this point are<br/>\nRebreathers and Aqualungs.  Even at max CHA it costs me roughly 225 plat to<br/>\nATTEMPT one Aqualung.  And they sell back for about 190 to a vendor, used<br/>\nor empty of charges.  I pretty much stoped at 109 skill because it was just<br/>\ncosting me too much money for virtually no gain.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully one of the first things they add is a relatively inexpensive way<br/>\nto gain skill after 104.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Elder of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
