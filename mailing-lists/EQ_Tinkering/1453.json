I&#39;m fairly sure that Verant made an official statement that there<br/>\nwould never be such things.  I also know (playing since beta 2) that there<br/>\nhave never been publicly available tinkered pets in the game.  Given their<br/>\nconcerns about balance, I find it highly unlikely that they would include<br/>\ntinkered pets.
