I would invest my money in all other trades before I would Tinkering <br/>\nand that is because of the sheer waste of time and pp it has become. Quite <br/>\nfrankly the items that people dreamed of sounded alot more exciting than the <br/>\nskill as it is right now. However, i am hopefull that someday verant will see <br/>\nhow disgusting the trade has become with virtually no beneifeits to the <br/>\ntinkerer....
