Flameless lanterns until trivial, bow cams until <br/>\ntrivial, and then a combination of stalking probes and spyglasses until <br/>\ntrivial. Spyglasses cost more to make than spyglasses, but become trivial <br/>\nat a lower level.  They also seem to be easier to sell.  I&#39;m now faced with <br/>\naqualungs, which don&#39;t become trivial for around 46 points I think.  I <br/>\nwould guess if the thermal cloak was in the game, it would fit in between <br/>\nstalking probes and aqualungs, maybe with a trivial point around 125 or <br/>\nso.  Anyway, at 210pp per attempt, I will be working lungs for quite some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, anyone on Bristlebane that can make rebreathers, a character named <br/>\nShale wants one.  I&#39;m too far away to make one for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtiny<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:51 PM 3/16/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Daniel1013@...\">Daniel1013@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just got my lvl 16 a week ago, what should I start tinkering first?
