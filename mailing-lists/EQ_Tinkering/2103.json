People<br/>\ndon&#39;t care that they can get infinite EB forever, they<br/>\ncare that they can get FREE EB for the trip that<br/>\nthey&#39;re going on.  I&#39;m lucky if I can sell Aqualungs<br/>\nanymore, and the last rebreather that I made is being<br/>\npassed around to guildmates who need it while I&#39;m<br/>\nplaying in the planes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the addition of magician summoned stones, this<br/>\nmarket has gone to the crappers.  And now they took<br/>\naway the lore tag as well.  Talk about adding insult<br/>\nto injury =(  There&#39;s nothing that I can make and sell<br/>\nto people which raises my skill anymore, so I&#39;m not<br/>\ngoing to bother sinking any more money into it until<br/>\nthey revamp the trade.<br/>\n<br/>\n/rude Verant dev team<br/>\n<br/>\nGazamel Prime<br/>\n50 Gnome Warrior<br/>\nMaster Tinker of 123 Aqualungs<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Tony Buser &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gr0k@...\">gr0k@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is the list still alive?

I can<br/>\n&gt; see his point, but I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t quite agree with it.  Tho I&#39;m no where near<br/>\n&gt; the tinkering level to<br/>\n&gt; make them, I can invision a situation like this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A poor Gnome who&#39;s spent months and several thousand<br/>\n&gt; plat, worked hard and <br/>\n&gt; spent an insane amount of time and effort to master<br/>\n&gt; tinkering walks into<br/>\n&gt; the zone outside Kedge and shouts &quot;Rebreather for<br/>\n&gt; sale 2k pp&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any mage walks in the zone outside Kedge and shouts<br/>\n&gt; &quot;a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; breathing stones for sale 20pp&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How many tells do you think the gnome will get?  :(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Q: This latest patch just made the mages 1-charge<br/>\n&gt; water breathing stones<br/>\n&gt; non-lore. I already had a heck of a time selling my<br/>\n&gt; aqualungs/rebreathers.<br/>\n&gt; Now any 50 lev can walk into unrest and offer 20pp<br/>\n&gt; for a backpack full of<br/>\n&gt; stones to any 20th level mage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A: This really shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Sure, they<br/>\n&gt; might be non-lore, but<br/>\n&gt; they are summoned so they will disappear on log out<br/>\n&gt; or on a lost <br/>\n&gt; connection. Something that does unlimited enduring<br/>\n&gt; breath is superior to<br/>\n&gt; the stones. -Gordon<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; gr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land -<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n&gt; Ubershadow Leprechaun - Level 35 Gnome Rogue -<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tunares.juju.org\">http://tunares.juju.org</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend online invitations with Yahoo!
