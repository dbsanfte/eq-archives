They sell three different kinds of twine and<br/>\nstring and they are very cheap, something like a few silver or copper each.<br/>\n So I&#39;m revising my theory of the pole as being something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nSome shafts maybe two or three or more<br/>\nA type of twine - possibly from fletcher merchants<br/>\npossibly some grease<br/>\npossibly some rods<br/>\ncork anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother hint we get is that the fishing pole works on a telescoping<br/>\nconcept, we can infer this since in the recipe book, the spy glass is<br/>\nconfused with a fishing pole.  So if its a telescoping kind of action, that<br/>\nimplies it uses shafts, possibly several.  The book also mentions, &quot;The<br/>\nextra rod provides support&quot;.  This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean there is a rod<br/>\nin the recipie, in fact, I believe this implies that the collapsable pole<br/>\nis so flimsy that it cannot support the weight of a bottle, reflective<br/>\nshard and twine modification without extra support from a rod.  Which I<br/>\nthink is further support for the shaft theory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother I noticed is that the spyglass picture kind of looks like a fishing<br/>\npole in reverse.  Its as if the reflective shard and bottle are kind of<br/>\neither tied on or connected to the handle part of the fishing pole.  The<br/>\nextra rod helps support this modification to the collapsable pole.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought I&#39;ve had is that the pole shouldn&#39;t be to expensive to<br/>\nmake, since its needed to make a spyglass which is also expensive to make.<br/>\nThe reflective shard alone is 16 plat!  So I&#39;d estimate the pole to be in<br/>\nthe &#39;cheap&#39; range of around 3 to 5 plat to make.  Similar in cost to the<br/>\ncompass and flameless lantern.  We should also consider that the recipie<br/>\nmay not have  been changed any since beta, that being the case, the old<br/>\ntool boxes has 4 slots in them, so its possible that the formula only has 4<br/>\nthings.  On the other hand there are several formulas that have 5 items in<br/>\nthem, 5 seems to be the max that anything has.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell.. thats just my guess at the moment.  Sometime I&#39;ll make the database<br/>\ninto a real database, right now its just a bunch of tables, but it would be<br/>\nneat to have it on excel so that people can sort/search out different<br/>\nrecipies.  But at the moment I&#39;m up to about 230 known recipes that don&#39;t<br/>\nwork.  So at least if you can print it out, it can help you avoid spending<br/>\ncash on things that others already know don&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPahbi of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html\">http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
