I know the guy personally, he&#39;s<br/>\nnot part of some secret EQ emu society , you guy&#39;s are so quick to believe<br/>\nanything that someone says.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why he hasn&#39;t released the info on the book is becuase he takes<br/>\npride in being the only person who has found it.  He doesn&#39;t want this to<br/>\nget ruined like every other damn secret in eq.  Yes, the book is IN GAME.<br/>\nIt&#39;s in steamfront, somewhere.  When I talked to him, he said that is was a<br/>\nfreak accident how he found it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Keeganex Gemchopper<br/>\nGnome Warrior<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: David &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imgsrc@...\">imgsrc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 20, 1999 6:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Tinkering] My thought on how the guy got the book...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: David &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:imgsrc@...\">imgsrc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now I&#39;m not saying anyone is a cheater but... If you have all these people<br/>\n&gt; looking for the book and it can&#39;t be found its most likely not in the game<br/>\nyet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As you may of heard people have been working on an eq emu.<br/>\n&gt; And as you may have known there is a command to summon items, each item<br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; a number. some people where summoning items starting from 0001 or<br/>\nsoemthing<br/>\n&gt; and working their way up. Baiscly I think that someone was summoning items<br/>\n&gt; and ran across the book. And blam history is made.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It would explaine why the person hasn&#39;t said where the book its and/or how<br/>\n&gt; to get it.<br/>\n&gt; -Dave<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
