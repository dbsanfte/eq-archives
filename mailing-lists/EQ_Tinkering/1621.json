You have rekindled my interest in tinkering.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaxtonia Firewater, Wayward Gnomish Mage (Mith Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Brian Nelson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rock-on@...\">rock-on@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   As far as skill cap goes, I&#39;ll just let you all know that <br/>\n&gt; it USED to be<br/>\n&gt; capped at (level - 15) * 5. But Verant has recently either <br/>\n&gt; removed the skill<br/>\n&gt; cap or changed it. How do I know this? Because I have been <br/>\n&gt; level 30 for<br/>\n&gt; about a month and a half now, and I have been tinkering a <br/>\n&gt; whole lot in that<br/>\n&gt; time. I was stuck for the longest time at 75 skill. I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; just think I was<br/>\n&gt; stuck, I know I was because I made over 150 spyglasses after <br/>\n&gt; I was already<br/>\n&gt; at 75 skill and I didn&#39;t get a single skill point increase. I <br/>\n&gt; was selling<br/>\n&gt; the spyglasses for between 70pp and 100pp and I sold over 150 of them,<br/>\n&gt; making me become one of the richest level 30 players I know. <br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t care<br/>\n&gt; much about the skill cap or being able to make aqualungs or <br/>\n&gt; even leveling, I<br/>\n&gt; was raking in the dough and that was all that I cared about. <br/>\n&gt; Well last week<br/>\n&gt; while I was making more spyglasses to sell my skill level <br/>\n&gt; suddenly increased<br/>\n&gt; to 76 and I was completely astonished! I then proceeded to spend a few<br/>\n&gt; thousand platinum on spyglasses and stalking probes and a few <br/>\n&gt; painstaking<br/>\n&gt; hours later I was a master tinkerer. My skill is now 103 and I have<br/>\n&gt; attempted 6 aqualungs. I have made 3 out of those 6 attempts.<br/>\n&gt;   In my experience, I believe it is possible that tinkering MAY now be<br/>\n&gt; capped at Level * 5 - 13 (maybe not), but it used to be <br/>\n&gt; capped at (level -<br/>\n&gt; 15) * 5. I do know though that it is no longer capped at <br/>\n&gt; (level - 15) * 5.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Brillian<br/>\n&gt; 30 Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
