Once you find one, tell him that you do can do cams and that you <br/>\ncan give him good prices. Most highskilled fletchers have a gnome tinkerer <br/>\nto provide cams for them, and they stick to one person, thats why they are <br/>\nhard to sell. Me, I got myself to 185 skill fletching and use the cams <br/>\nmyself, or will when i have maxed it which i cant afford because of this <br/>\ndamned tinkering :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo sell fireworks, make a whole bunch of em, take em with you, and just use <br/>\na few in a dungeon or somewhere where there is a lot of ppl, that will make <br/>\nem sell, same with spyglasses, just use em, best way to sell em.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sandortien, 50th wiz of Xegony<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
