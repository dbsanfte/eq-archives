Can<br/>\nyou imagine a gnome monk? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone that says a 6/20 weapon is crap becasue it&#39;s not magical probably hasnt<br/>\nused one - I primary wield the bullsmasher with a PGT and it kicks all sorts of<br/>\nmob tail :) On the rare occaison I need to fight a magic mob I switch the<br/>\nbullsmasher with a dragoon dirk. Considering that you can get this weapon at<br/>\nlevel 5-6, it gets my vote for the best weapon in the game :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, Manik Completon actually responds to &quot;What is Bull Smasher&quot;,<br/>\nwhich I find interesting - the text isn&#39;t too interesting, but perhaps its a<br/>\nplaceholder for a quest to get a magical upgrade...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
