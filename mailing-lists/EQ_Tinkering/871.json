First of all, guides are <br/>\nvolunteer players, who have characters of their own, and play EQ just like <br/>\nthe rest of us. If they are told everything there is to know about the game <br/>\nwhen they become a guide, there would be players, who knew everything there <br/>\nis to know, like tinkering recipes, for example. The other possibility is, <br/>\nthey don&#39;t tell them to much at all, that would make more sense, and it <br/>\nwould also mean that most guides, or rather, all of them, except a rare few, <br/>\nactually have no clue about tinkering. This would explain why they <br/>\ncontradict themselves so much. The people in charge at verant are more <br/>\nlikely to tell the guides to just say tinkering works fine, as apposed to <br/>\ntell them its broken, becaues they probably don&#39;t want to tell them why its <br/>\nbroken, or what parts are broken, or more precisly, what parts aren&#39;t <br/>\nbroken. Whether they tell guides about every little detail of the game or <br/>\nnot, either way, it explains some things that we havn&#39;t figured out, maybe <br/>\nSalvidori is a guide on a different server, maybe he got lucky, maybe the <br/>\nguides don&#39;t know, or care enough to do much explaining so they just tell us <br/>\ntinkering is just dandy. Either way, it would explain a lot.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
