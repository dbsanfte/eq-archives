I heard his name mentioned once before in this list. I am Raskur, a level 50 enchanter on Veeshan who plays his secondaries often. As for this Mauldoon, I suspect he&#39;s not a nice guy, but then again, that&#39;s your server and not mine :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRaskur Everheart, level 50 Enchanter<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: John F Vanden Bosch Jr <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, January 19, 2000 4:31 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Gazamel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: John F Vanden Bosch Jr &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfvbjr@...\">jfvbjr@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  As a Gnome Enchanter and one of the only two (now maybe three) in my guild,  a certin amout of request are made on my time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As of which I have not had a chance to spent time or the money (it goes to other projects) in what is my skill by race.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As i go about my life on the plant we call Norrath i have had to pleasure (and misfortune) to meet both Gazamel, and Mauldoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My metting with Gazamel was one of a polite gnome, asking how I was doing, and how my work progressed in Tinkering. The question here was more along the lines of &quot;How are you doing, adn do you need any help&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  MY metting with Mauldoon was any thing but. I once sent an appolige to Mauldoon for the wrong &quot;misinformed on my part&quot; done to him by other Gnomes trying to get him to tell them where the items to tinkering where. This was done in a chance to strick up a conversation and posible friendship. The responce i recived from Mauldoon was nada. My one metting with him, was when he apporched me, acted like we were old friends and asked for a Clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\n  At this point in my short life (pun intended) my respect is in Gazamel.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tinkerten Iktomi<br/>\n  37th circle Enchanter<br/>\n  Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
