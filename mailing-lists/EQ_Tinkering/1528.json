From seeing the recipe posted <br/>\nthere it looked as if someone had actually made one, I could be <br/>\nwrong. I also tried it as listed above with a small tattered belt.<br/>\n  If memory serves one thing I thought was odd was that when a <br/>\ntailor makes a belt it&#39;s listed as a tattered belt, but the cloak was <br/>\nlisted as a patchwork cloak.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 13 Dec 99, at 12:53, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbuckingham@...\">jbuckingham@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbuckingham@...\">jbuckingham@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I tried it after they put in the tailoring patch for cloaks. Wrong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cloak. The tailoring cloak comes out as a patchwork and won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; combine. They could have changed something since though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Combine with what though.. The recipe is not too specific as to how many metal<br/>\n&gt; rods to use, and also is bit ambigous as to wether the belt is required element,<br/>\n&gt; or just a bit of flavor - I&#39;d be more inclined towards the latte,r as it doesnt<br/>\n&gt; say what sort of belt it was... That&#39;s why I suggested the new failed attempt<br/>\n&gt; list..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, on a completely unrelated note.. The gnomish metal gauntlets and the silk<br/>\n&gt; lined steel cap that are sold at the vendor at the windmills - has anyone tried<br/>\n&gt; putting them on and seeing what they looked like? I wouldn&#39;t mind buying and<br/>\n&gt; wearing that cap if it looked like steel, though the icon makes me think it&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; end up as leather:)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
