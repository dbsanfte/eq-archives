The biggest proof <br/>\non this would be that Verant said that they were gonna fix, and if it is <br/>\ngone now, more power to the tinkering gnomes who have sent numerous <br/>\n/feedback /petition and mails to take it away..<br/>\n<br/>\nI have myself put over 10kp into tinkering and gotten it to a skill of 104 <br/>\nor 105 (not sure which) and realized that you cant make a profit from the <br/>\nlungs, my own sales argument on these is that i will trade em in for a <br/>\npricereduction of the same amount of pp on a rebreather when i can make <br/>\nthem. So, buy a lung from me for 500p, use it up, and when i can make the <br/>\nrebreather, trade it in for one and get price reduced with the same 500p.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will work out fine as i guess you will still fail a lot of lungs even <br/>\nwhen you can make the rebreathers, and the lungs would still work as a <br/>\nreagent i would think, even if the charges are out. and you would still make <br/>\na profit with a 500p reduction, if you take that in consideration when you <br/>\nset your price.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main income source on tinkering is the telescopes tho, ive sold at lease <br/>\n100 of those, for a price of about 80p each. The best way to sell these for <br/>\nme, has been to just use it where there are a lot of ppl :) And they DO have <br/>\nsome use, many ppl have bought em from me just to be able to see if the <br/>\nghoul lord in gukbottom is carrying a ssoy without having to get too close <br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep up the good work, and someone PLEASE find diamond dust :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandortien, 50th gnome wizard of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
