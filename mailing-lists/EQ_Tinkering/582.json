You just stay at the<br/>\nzone and pull things there and fight.  It is best to fight down in the room near<br/>\nthe sol b zone.  It is nicely spaced out and it is safe to zone into sol b.<br/>\nAtleast for a short while.  Have a tank with you, and a healer is always nice.<br/>\nWith those 3 in a party you should be fine, but even a full party is cool<br/>\nthere.  you can pull MoBs according to your party.  You get plenty of FS as<br/>\nloot, and good exp.<br/>\n<br/>\nTony Buser wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Tony Buser&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gr0k@...\">gr0k@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You went there at lvl 20?
