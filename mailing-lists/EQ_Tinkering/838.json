I asked him for a moment of<br/>\nhis time and he agreed. I mentioned tinkering to him and all the people that are<br/>\nfrustrated right now. He said he knew nothing personally and said he would ask<br/>\naround. He then reported back that tinkering IS indeed broken. It is a known<br/>\nissue and he suggested we be very persistant in our feedback and petitions until<br/>\nit is fixed or an anouncement is made saying that it will not be fixed etc. He<br/>\nalso said that as far as he knows there IS NOT a 3rd tinkering book.
