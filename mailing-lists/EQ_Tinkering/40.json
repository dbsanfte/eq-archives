No clue, maybe it has to be done after<br/>\nthe two Spare lens that are suppose to be there are found.<br/>\nOne is the freeport elf, which has been found and the other<br/>\nis on a Gnome, same last name as the Gnomes that you have<br/>\nto ask about the lens, but is found (rarely) in the Mino caves, way back<br/>\nin there.
