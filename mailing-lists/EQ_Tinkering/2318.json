After looking at the quest","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1205026550\">Okay let me clear this rumour up before this gets out of hand.  My<br/>\nguildmate Eltanin was asking my advice on his enchanter quest.  After<br/>\nlooking at the quest text (you: Where is the mechancial pen.  NPC: the<br/>\nanswer is in your question), I came up with the an idea that the location<br/>\nwas hidden as an anagram within the word Mechanical Pen.  It looked<br/>\npromising as Paineel was the only zone with all it&#39;s letters in Mechanical<br/>\nPen.  With the remaining letters, I came up with Mc&#39;Chanl or Mc&#39;Nulch,<br/>\nthinking a barbarian had the pen.  However, this was just a theory and not<br/>\na fact!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy theory was proved wrong as the actual quest is finished by giving a SMR<br/>\n&lt;gasp&gt; to the chanter NPC in the Mines of Malfucntion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if anyone tells you that the mechanical pen is in Paineel, please<br/>\ncorrect them!  Thanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I highly doubt that this item is tinkerable since it&#39;s part of the<br/>\nFA type quests for chanters.<br/>\n<br/>\nQdP - who is completely amazed how a theory turned into an assumed fact<br/>\novernight hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Quasinom de Plume is my quasi nom-de-plume&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Everque@...\">Everque@...</a> wrote: &gt; Mechanical Pen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone heard of a recipe for such a device?  Its may be a component of<br/>\n&gt; part <br/>\n&gt; of the FA quest for enchanters. Also have heard that it may be an<br/>\n&gt; anagram for <br/>\n&gt; something in Paineel.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Beralt Mindtwister (ready to start on catapults now!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
