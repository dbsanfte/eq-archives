Go up that gnome <br/>\nmerchant and hail him...<br/>\n<br/>\n/say &quot;Hail XXXXXXX&quot; (I forget his name)<br/>\n<br/>\nHello there! I haven&#39;t seen you around these parts have I? We don&#39;t get <br/>\nmany visitors around here.. must be the goblins that scare people <br/>\naway.  They aren&#39;t the greatest fellows but at least you can trade with <br/>\nthem.  There&#39;s this one that sells cloaks that they make.. Rather nice <br/>\nfitting on us gnomes.  I would love to have one to replace this [tattered <br/>\ngnomish cloak].<br/>\n<br/>\n/say What tattered gnomish cloak?<br/>\n<br/>\n/say What cloak? This old rag hanging off my back.  The goblin that sells <br/>\nthem will only barter with people.. He has a liking for Ogre heads for some <br/>\nreason.. I think they like to eat them.  Tell you what, you bring an Ogre&#39;s <br/>\nHead I&#39;ll give you one of us gnome&#39;s old cloak.. they&#39;re in decent shape, <br/>\nbetter than some old Ogre&#39;s head for sure.. sound like a deal?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you run out to OOT... whack one of them Ogres and take the head.  You <br/>\ncan get two heads per trip (two ogres and they heads are lore, but they are <br/>\ndifferent heads).  Much better than going in there an whacking <br/>\nclockworks.  Geez.  This isn&#39;t a very good quest example, but it certainly <br/>\nproves that if they spent 10 minutes they could come up with a lame quest <br/>\nlike this.. what if they spent an hour?  Could probably do something decent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 06:49 PM 7/24/00 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;1 Metal Rod<br/>\n&gt;1 Firewater<br/>\n&gt;1 Tattered Gnomish Cloak<br/>\n&gt;Sol A on Clockworks, Bartenders, Goblins Torturers<br/>\n&gt;Was discovered by Gozza. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
