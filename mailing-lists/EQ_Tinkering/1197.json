I have found<br/>\n&gt;  book XXXIII and it has:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Aqua Lung<br/>\n&gt;  Re-Breather   (Aqua Lung with a longer duration)<br/>\n&gt;  GemCutter     (Not sure what it is, but I think Jewelers will be happy with<br/>\n&gt;  us!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I *WILL* be giving out the formulas, but I wanted to make some of the items<br/>\n&gt;  to sell first.  I do have a &#39;deal&#39; if anyone wants the formulas early.  I<br/>\n&gt;  want to make these items, but I&#39;m low on cash and need a money backer.  If<br/>\n&gt;  someone is willing to back me, I&#39;ll give them the formula, but with the<br/>\n&gt;  costs of even trying it, it will need a LOT of cash.  I plan on releasing<br/>\n&gt;  all of them no later then December 1st (basically a month).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I sent pages 1 and 2 to Gnomad to prove I have the book (and he can post it<br/>\n&gt;  if he likes, it only shows one part of what you need.  I do not suggest just<br/>\n&gt;  throwing things into our toolbox, it uses items that are NOT tinker items<br/>\n&gt;  (like fireworks used batwings) so you will never just guess it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Estimated costs are about 200 for aqualung, about 500 - 600 for the<br/>\n&gt;  rebreather, and I&#39;m not sure on the GemCutter as it needs a part I have<br/>\n&gt;  never seen or heard of, but I think about 100-200 plat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  And GNOME, these things are expensive! Especially the rebreather.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;MAN ARE YOU EVER SO LAME...What&#39;s the sence of you even posting? .....Nobody<br/>\n&gt;is going to fund  your stuff unless you give them the recipie before<br/>\n&gt;hand.......Also tinkering levels so slow  that thier may be only a handfull<br/>\n&gt;of people that probly could tinker that high and you could be setting your<br/>\n&gt;self up for such a low demand...because the less people know about them the<br/>\n&gt;less they want them...low supply  and high demand is a good thing ,but you<br/>\n&gt;have people that are stingy in this game...IF you dont have others in the<br/>\n&gt;market for comparison shopping you can&#39;t  have people deciding that your sell<br/>\n&gt;price is good....and they will wait longer to buy your wears...unless you<br/>\n&gt;have a long line of desprate people waiting for it that dont know how to shop<br/>\n&gt;around...Which isnt very likely.  Until a REAL post that does something that<br/>\n&gt;it says it does comes along I wont believe you and most likely evry one else<br/>\n&gt;wont .. ...
