You<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have to bother making a second character. <br/>\nYou can get a crude stein, and a couple of jewelery<br/>\nitems and bump your CHA up plenty.  The vendor should<br/>\nbe at worst indifferent to you unless you&#39;ve killed<br/>\ngnomes somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I tested my CHA theory by getting a bard friend<br/>\n...bard had 200 CHA whom the vendor conned amiable...<br/>\nto tell me his prices for the same items I was<br/>\nchecking.  The vendor conned indifferent to me, and I<br/>\nhad CHA 104.  Turns out the prices were the same.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experiences have been varied, and I&#39;ve never once<br/>\nhad the books in my inventory.  With an int of 174,<br/>\nand a wisdom of 111, I made 10 of 24 lungs, raised 5<br/>\npoints (to get from 102 to 107) which made each lung<br/>\ncost about 504 plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow..  the strange part...  I didn&#39;t have my buddy to<br/>\nlend me all of his int gear (had a friend lend me WIS<br/>\ngear instead), so I tried some with an INT of 139, and<br/>\na WIS of 137.  I was 16 out of 24, and raised skill 7<br/>\npoints (from 107 to 114).  The made each lung cost<br/>\nabout 315 plat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn both cases, I sell lungs for 400 plat. So if I sell<br/>\nall of the lungs, I&#39;ll come out 300 or so plat<br/>\nnegative, but have raised up 12 points, at a cost of<br/>\nabout 27 plat per point.  Hopefully I can sell em all<br/>\n=)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on both occasions, I spent roughly 5,040pp.  With<br/>\nan uber INT, I raised 5 points.  With both a medium<br/>\nlevel INT and WIS, I raised 7 points and was more<br/>\nsuccessful (granted my skill was a little higher, that<br/>\nonly accounts for the increased successes, but not for<br/>\nthe increased skill point raises...Hmmmm *shrug*  ).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo based on my experiences, my advice would be to<br/>\nbalance out INT and WIS and try to keep them close to<br/>\neach other, but at a decently medium-high level.  Keep<br/>\na spare set of CHA gear in the bank for making<br/>\npurchases.  Just my experiences, take them how you<br/>\nwill.  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nGazamel Prime<br/>\nMaster Tinker<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Alex Shimanovsky &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:10815@...\">10815@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some Tips:<br/>\n&gt; I made a couple of rebreathers at skill 111, costed<br/>\n&gt; me 25,000 pp to make 5<br/>\n&gt; of them and 4 aqualungs where left<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I did is I made a High Elf pumpled CHA into<br/>\n&gt; him, twinked him a bit he<br/>\n&gt; had 198 CHA anyways I could buy all the stuff for<br/>\n&gt; aqualungs for about 200<br/>\n&gt; pp , and total cost for rebreather works to about<br/>\n&gt; 1000 pp / try . costed<br/>\n&gt; about 5000 pp each.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; so 1 / 5 tries it actualy worked on the avarage,<br/>\n&gt; also have the tinkering<br/>\n&gt; books in your GENERAL INVENTORY, aqualungs are<br/>\n&gt; actualy 1 /2 tried with the<br/>\n&gt; books about 1 / 3 without the books<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; anyways you get your main guy stand by the mule and<br/>\n&gt; the mule buys ( takes 2<br/>\n&gt; accounts tho ).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; anyways it works out great like that. But now the<br/>\n&gt; problem is selling those<br/>\n&gt; rebreathers on our server most people won&#39;t buy them<br/>\n&gt; for over 2 KPP, and I<br/>\n&gt; dont really like loosing 3,000 pp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyways the point of this thread is just to give<br/>\n&gt; tips, and I think if you<br/>\n&gt; guys also have some tips it would help a lot, on how<br/>\n&gt; to maybe reduce the<br/>\n&gt; cost or somthing like that etc.,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But we need to help each other<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ALSO: maybe we should ALL do a /feedback and ask<br/>\n&gt; them to give more useble<br/>\n&gt; stuff to tinkering, also maybe we can start a big<br/>\n&gt; post on the Offical<br/>\n&gt; Massage board, I think we should fight for our<br/>\n&gt; skill, I mean look at<br/>\n&gt; Shamans they got Alchamy working , and it is a great<br/>\n&gt; class-only skill, why<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t we make Verant get off their ass and make them<br/>\n&gt; do somthing about<br/>\n&gt; tinkering.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; like also tell us if that Diamond Dust actualy<br/>\n&gt; exist, like we been<br/>\n&gt; searching for it for what 2 month now ?!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -50 lvl nec , Emarr, gnome, skill 111<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
