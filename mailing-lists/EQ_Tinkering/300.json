I wasn&#39;t on at the time of the event, but I<br/>\n&gt;learned about it later when I logged on and got a tell about it and that<br/>\n&gt;one of the items found in the loot was a collapsible fishing pole.  I was<br/>\n&gt;given the pole, and from it I was able to make the spyglass (re-read my<br/>\n&gt;original message to the list...)  Yes, that spyglass formula on the site is<br/>\n&gt;correct :P  I put up a fairly quick update to the site with the screenshots<br/>\n&gt;and such.  On the main page news - &#39;Another update soon&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t know the formula for the fishing pole, in case you haven&#39;t guessed<br/>\n&gt;it yet.  Should I have mentioned this sooner?  A bad oversight in getting<br/>\n&gt;some info up on two items, which for a tough-to-find-anything skill like<br/>\n&gt;tinkering, is great news.  Still, I was rather disappointed at some of the<br/>\n&gt;comments I received...  Anyone remember the old saying for when people<br/>\n&gt;ASSUME? :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The items exist in the game.  We don&#39;t know the formula for the fishing<br/>\n&gt;pole, however.  In that case, why not start a project to find it.  I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;start (which I was intending to do aka the update...) creating a list of<br/>\n&gt;all the combinations that people try on the site.  Through that we should<br/>\n&gt;be able to find it, right?  I see no reason why not.  For those hesitant<br/>\n&gt;about spending the cash, think of it as an investment 8)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Awaiting feedback...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Luke<br/>\n&gt;Tinkering Guide website:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering\">http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering</a><br/>\n&gt;Last updated: 8-8-99<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\n&gt;For details and to order, go to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
