He had company of a RED skeleton monk, so I didnt go near, but he conned white (or black) to me, and he was indifferent. If someone could get rid of the undeads near to him, without angering him, one could make a try at hailing him. <br/>\nThe spelunker is most likely a necro, but does someone know anything about his class as a fact? And has any necro tried to communicate with him?<br/>\nAnd for the ones who has killed this guy, what does he drop?<br/>\n<br/>\nPiip Ignatz<br/>\nGnome Rogue of the 20th grade<br/>\nInnoruuk server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
