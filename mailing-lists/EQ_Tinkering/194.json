Those guards are level 40 or so, i hear, and Meldrath charms.  If he<br/>\n&gt; spawned, it would be near where the other slaves are.  I did see a mob in<br/>\n&gt; there though.  Can&#39;t remember his name, Londoor or something.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>\n&gt; him walking through Steamfont attacking rogue clocks.  He ignored me when i<br/>\n&gt; hailed and walked straight into the mine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 10:23 AM 07/22/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: mstokes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mstokes@...\">mstokes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hmm, good idea.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have a few thoughts on this as well.  Bidl Frugin may indeed be located in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the Steamfont Mino&#39;s cave.  I have a feeling that the guards may whack him as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;soon as he spawns, much like Bandits will kill Giant Spiders and Bears in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Karanas.  Not sure about this, but its a thought.  Secondly, is the lens quest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;class specific?  What generic gnome quests exist out there?  Brewing is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;another trade skill that is very quest related, so I think that this is a good<br/>\n&gt; &gt;avenue to pursue.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Cheers<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Malkin Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
