Firstly, he had to go and get the<br/>\nmolds from The Feerrott, cuz the Freeport shop only has medium molds.<br/>\nApparently there is no forge down there.  Secondly, it&#39;s nearly impossible<br/>\nfor me (skill 110 ish) to make about four of the banded armour pieces.<br/>\nThirdly, failures cost between 4pp and 6pp.  After three trips to the<br/>\nFeerrott for the troll, and literally hours of real time, I had made his<br/>\nbanded at a loss to me of 100pp.  Oh, and I gained 2 points of skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh well, I&#39;ll stick to jewellery and Steins I think.  I made the 100pp back<br/>\nin 1/2 hour from jewellery, and then sold a Stein for 300pp :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIan aka Poggin the Mostly-Deflated-but-now-Partially-Reinflated Gnome.<br/>\n-----<br/>\nICQ: 389422 / Mobile +44 966 360078</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
