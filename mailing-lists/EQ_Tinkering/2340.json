Then I realized that being a necro, i was<br/>\npretty well screwed for making the shaped ashwood recurve bows needed for<br/>\nthe catapults (after dropping 300pp into fletching to go from 0-125).<br/>\n<br/>\nFound a simple solution for that though, on the brell server there is a<br/>\nguild devoted to fletching &quot;Royal Fletchers&quot; is the name of the guild, I<br/>\noffered one of the members the job and he took it (well, i  /auc WTB shaped<br/>\nashwood recurve bows, need 10, 40pp each   and one of them was the first to<br/>\nrespond)<br/>\nSeems to me that this is a great way to get from 122 to 135 without having<br/>\nto travel all of Norath just to make some lousy bows for a useless piece yer<br/>\njust gonna sell back to the merchant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of course, is that if yer on Brell and at that point in yer<br/>\ntinkering career, you may want to give one of them a holler.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 bits.<br/>\n<br/>\nGentral Kalpariah<br/>\n40th Level Necrophile...errr, mancer<br/>\nBrell Serrilis<br/>\nAlliance of Exiled</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
