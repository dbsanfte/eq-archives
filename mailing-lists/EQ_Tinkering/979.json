I&#39;m not going to say anything more, not about tinkering, <br/>\nor about the third book of anything, not even my opinions. I just quit <br/>\nEverQuest, so I don&#39;t care anymore. I&#39;m sad about never being able to see <br/>\nthe golden age of tinkering, but maybe I&#39;ll stay subscrabed to this list to <br/>\nhear about it, since I won&#39;t ever witness it first hand...*sigh* tood bad. <br/>\nOh well....good luck, hope you all master it and make all of the money off <br/>\nof it before it becomes just another &quot;blacksmithing&quot; if you know what I <br/>\nmean.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve read all your messages since I got on this list, and so far nothing <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;have stated has come from any of the game designers, programmers, or<br/>\n&gt;developers.  I remember your rotten letter before you supposedly quit, I <br/>\n&gt;read<br/>\n&gt;your apology and promise to provide information in the future, and I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;read<br/>\n&gt;you flaming other people for being down on you and I never said a thing <br/>\n&gt;about<br/>\n&gt;any of it until now...because now you are making these absolute and <br/>\n&gt;unequivocal<br/>\n&gt;statments about how there is no 3rd book etc. and I&#39;m simply not going to<br/>\n&gt;believe it just because you say it.  Nor am I going to believe it because <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;say that some GM says it, and the reason for that is because we have <br/>\n&gt;already<br/>\n&gt;gotten conflicting statements from GMs!  One says tinkering is fine, <br/>\n&gt;another<br/>\n&gt;says it is broken, someone else says there is a 3rd book and yet another <br/>\n&gt;source<br/>\n&gt;says there isn&#39;t.   I still say nothing that comes from a Guide or even a <br/>\n&gt;staff<br/>\n&gt;GM means anything...good or bad.<br/>\n&gt;If you took what I wrote as a flame maybe YOU should re-read what I wrote<br/>\n&gt;instead of automatically going into defenseive mode. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
