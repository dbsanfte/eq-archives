The rewards I got were small leather boots, small leather<br/>\n writstbands, small round shield, bronze warhammer, bronze short sword...<br/>\n That hammer had me exited for a bit when I saw it appear, thinking it<br/>\n perhaps was an upgraded bullsmasher :) But so far the reward looks a little<br/>\n light for a level 30 quest... Though at level 20 the 10 attempts got me<br/>\n about 1.5 bubbles of exp :) My factilon at the time was Kindly, but after I<br/>\n got bored I went and killed rogue clockworks for scrap to try and get the<br/>\n compactor, which got my faction up to warmly, so I might try it a few more<br/>\n times next weekend..<br/>\n <br/>\n Voriig Kye<br/>\n Erollisi Marr.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
