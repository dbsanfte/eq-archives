PEOPLE DO NOT NEED THESE, that&#39;s right this are novelties they are NOT an intregal part of the game.  People can go camp the 8 hour spawn for the fishbone earring or they can completely avoid Kedge it is up to them it is not necessary.  Also people came to me and said they would pay me 1kpp for the aqaulungs I even told<br/>\nthem it had 50 charges and they didn&#39;t really care because they were rich.  One person even said this to me  &quot;I am a tradesman myself and I make sure to support other tradesman&quot;  hence I didn&#39;t feel bad when she gave me money to help with my tinkering skill and later on when she asks me to make her an aqua lung I am going to tell her it&#39;s on me.  What I have been telling people is what one of the other people on this list said 600pp for an aqua and later on when you can<br/>\nupgrade to a rebreather 1kpp, I will be selling rebreathers for 2kpp and by the way people who are smart try and haggle, I would sell a rebreather for 1600pp<br/>\n<br/>\nEfrieum<br/>\n32 warrior<br/>\nInnorruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPS yes this was a personal attack, please think before you type something</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
