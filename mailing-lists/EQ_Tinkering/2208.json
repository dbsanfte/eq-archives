Give it a few<br/>\nplat and send it off to the nearest vendor to bring back bandages, food,<br/>\nwater, arrows, etc.  Of course it would have to dodge monsters all the way<br/>\nthere and back!  I think watching these scurry across the zone would be a<br/>\nhoot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother clockwork guide would be able to cross zones.  Program it to take<br/>\nyou from Qeynos to Freeport, hit go and then run to keep up.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, a clockwork cargo follows you around carrying items when you are<br/>\noverburdened with weight.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if someone already posted these... I lost track of all the great<br/>\nconcepts!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
