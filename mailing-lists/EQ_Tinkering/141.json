In many towns I<br/>\nhave come to there seems to be a merchant who will sell them. The merchant<br/>\nis not used often from what I can tell because they are always stuck in a<br/>\nback corner. There is a merchant one in qeynos by the docks. if you walk out<br/>\nof Fishes ale and go to the docks you will see a tall building on your right<br/>\nand a merchant sitting in the middle of a counter that goes in a circle<br/>\naround him.. He sells compasses for 2pp and it seems to cost us 3pp to make.<br/>\nAnyone else see a problem with this? I for one think that the vendors should<br/>\nbe selling there compasses for around 7pp. That gives us some nice room to<br/>\nwork. I have also seen compasses for sale in the High Elf City and Halas<br/>\n(all<br/>\nfor 2pp).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKlade<br/>\nA Magician of Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
