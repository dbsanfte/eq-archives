I  have seen a person in freeport bank with the illusion on and no <br/>\none bothering him.....However i would be very upset if once i obtained the <br/>\nspirit wolf illusion on enchanter and find out that it has not the same <br/>\neffect as share wolf form with the faction issue alone...In unrest the undead <br/>\ndid not touch me while i under shared wolf ....I hope the same is true for <br/>\nthe enchanter based spell.  As for tinkering ....looks like on the backburner <br/>\ntill it gets easier ...Or i get alot richer......Sincerly Cloverleaf &lt;Fennin <br/>\nRo&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
