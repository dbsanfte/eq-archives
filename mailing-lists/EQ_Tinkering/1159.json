And I&#39;m also sorely disapointed to hear that the<br/>\ncollapsable fishing pole breaks, I thought it being unbreakable would be<br/>\nits one saving grace.  =(<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Verant seems to be working on tinkering skill, now would probably be<br/>\na prime time to slip them a little note about the pole and ask that it be<br/>\nmade unbreakable, so that people will want to buy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last time I tried to get a hold of someone in Verant was when I sent in<br/>\nthe tinkering petition that had about 400 some signatures on it, I sent<br/>\ncopies to Smedley and Brad but never got any feedback.  Not even a note<br/>\nsaying, &quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll foward this to the right guy&quot;.  Kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was able to get feedback from GZ (The guy who does the spells).<br/>\n<br/>\nHis email address is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gzatkin@...\">gzatkin@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI sure if people emailed him a NICE POLITE and SHORT letter concerning the<br/>\ncollapsable pole breaking, and ask him to forward this to the trade skills<br/>\nperson to look at, I&#39;m sure he would help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I think I&#39;m gonna send him a email right now, and I hope everyone<br/>\nelse will be able to too.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rotgut</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
