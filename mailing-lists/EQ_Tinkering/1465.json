Which of course, with the failure rate to make these items, will <br/>\nmake me loose money.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to tinkered pets, i dont think they can be made. I heard rumors on <br/>\ndiamond dust beeing found in Kaladim, but I checked every merchant i could <br/>\nfind, no luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, i would like to know if anyone was albe to find the coral mesh from <br/>\nsharks in oot still. I mean, this guy that didnt want to share his info <br/>\nwould of course say they dont drop anymore to keep em for himself if he <br/>\naccidentaly dropped that info..  I&#39;ll check it out myself too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sandortien Stormwielder, 50th wiz of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
