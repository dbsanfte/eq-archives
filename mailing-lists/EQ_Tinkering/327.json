Armor dyeing ... if the <br/>\nonly use for tinkering ever was armor dyeing I would consider tinkering <br/>\nsuccessful.  It would be cool if tanks could bring there armor to us gnomes <br/>\nand have us dye it cool colors.  Its kinda sad that the average tank that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t play in excess of 1-2 hours a day really doesn&#39;t have much of a <br/>\nchance to ever wear red armor or obtain special class armor.  This is off <br/>\nsubject but one of my favorite things about the old outdated UO was that <br/>\neveryone had there own style people could billions of different color <br/>\ncombinations.  Just my humble opinion on stuff I care about.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoj</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
