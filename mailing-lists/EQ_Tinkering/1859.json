Well<br/>\nas for Oot i will explore that zone as much as i can although i am still<br/>\n4 bloody skill pts away from my first attempt at an aqualung. Best of <br/>\nluck to all and might i recommend that useing locate undead because if there<br/>\nis a boat then there will probably be undead there:) Unfortunatly i don&#39;t <br/>\nthink it is a small tattered cloak we are looking for. In all the other books<br/>\ncomponents of the items are in caps and are always the same name for the item<br/>\nas in the books. So I think we are looking for a tattered gnomish cloak and <br/>\nrecommend killing any so called... BAD gnomes out in Norrath in the hopes that<br/>\nthey may have the item. BTW tinkering is the best skill in the game in the fact<br/>\nthat there is so much still to do with it that hasn&#39;t been discovered.<br/>\nIt may be expensive as all hell but who cares it is fun:)<br/>\n<br/>\nGrundup Puddlejumper Tinkerholic skill or 99 Tallon Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
