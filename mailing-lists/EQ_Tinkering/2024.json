The rewards I got were small leather boots, small leather<br/>\nwritstbands, small round shield, bronze warhammer, bronze short sword...<br/>\nThat hammer had me exited for a bit when I saw it appear, thinking it<br/>\nperhaps was an upgraded bullsmasher :) But so far the reward looks a little<br/>\nlight for a level 30 quest... Though at level 20 the 10 attempts got me<br/>\nabout 1.5 bubbles of exp :) My factilon at the time was Kindly, but after I<br/>\ngot bored I went and killed rogue clockworks for scrap to try and get the<br/>\ncompactor, which got my faction up to warmly, so I might try it a few more<br/>\ntimes next weekend..<br/>\n<br/>\nVoriig Kye<br/>\nErollisi Marr.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
