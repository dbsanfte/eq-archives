I tried it myself with a door in freeport.  I practiced until I <br/>\ncould just open the door using mechanical lockpicks, then tried to use <br/>\nregular lockpicks and the door opened.  So, doesn&#39;t matter which you <br/>\nuse.  Therefore, the mechanical lockpicks have no special ability that is <br/>\nreadily apparent.  At least not as advertized by Verant.  Before I found <br/>\nthis out, I was selling them for 40pp each.  Now, I won&#39;t sell them until I <br/>\nfind out what good they are.  As for spyglasses, 80pp is a normal price.  I <br/>\nalso give them away to people that resurrect me :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:00 PM 3/5/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Russ Wilcox&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rwilcox@...\">rwilcox@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What&#39;s the going price for mech lockpicks, cams, and especially spyglasses?<br/>\n&gt;Do any of these turn into moneymakers? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
