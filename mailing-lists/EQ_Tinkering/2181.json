Tinkerers are not their own <br/>\nclass, and probably won&#39;t be.  If a gnomish wizard tinkers a pet, you have a <br/>\nbetter wizard.  This would be true for any class a gnome can be, although <br/>\nthe impact on magicians and necromancers would be less.  The pet would have <br/>\nto be fairly silly to pass the balancing stick of Verant.  Lowering the cost <br/>\nof the skill across the board would make it a little more useful, but that <br/>\nprobably won&#39;t happen with their current policy of taking hoards of plat out <br/>\nof the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t a matter of unbalancing the world, but the tinkerer.  Why would you <br/>\nplay any other race (aside from roleplaying or class restrictions) if you <br/>\ncould be a tinkering gnome?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcs0001@...\">jcs0001@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EQ_Tinkering] Re: The Creation of Clockwork Machines<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 20 Jun 2000 20:48:50 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Good GOD.. 2 Million a MONTH???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You would think that they could Really afford to flesh this thing<br/>\n&gt;out then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Clockworks couldn&#39;t BE a trade system. They would be PETS nothing more,<br/>\n&gt;nothing less. Although they could be very POWERFUL pets, that would<br/>\n&gt;offset the fact that a MASTER TINKERER (MT) wouldn&#39;t have available to him<br/>\n&gt;the amenities of other classes that can have pets. MASTER TINKERERS<br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t have the ability to cast spells, although through their<br/>\n&gt;creations could approximate the effect of spells through their Tinkers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The issue of these things unbalancing the world through their sale<br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t BE a factor because all that would have to be done is make the<br/>\n&gt;life of these Tinkers finite. Rebreathers and Aqualungs for example<br/>\n&gt;would disintegrate FASTER than they do now if not being used by a<br/>\n&gt;MASTER TINKERER. This would be due to an implied ability of the MT to<br/>\n&gt;perform the required maintenance on the objects he creates. (No ACTUAL<br/>\n&gt;maintenance would have to be performed mind you, just having the object<br/>\n&gt;in one&#39;s inventory would be enough to extend the life of a Tinker)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Aranathes Bonethrower [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aranathes@...\">aranathes@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, June 20, 2000 7:47 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Re: The Creation of Clockwork Machines<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Heh, and the letter I sent in was just to improve the fireworks.  =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ghirardelli<br/>\n&gt;48 necro - e&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Gazamel Prime&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gazamel@...\">gazamel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, June 20, 2000 7:12 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Re: The Creation of Clockwork Machines<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I agree with much of what you have in this post.

This would work by keeping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tinkering a Gnome trait<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; available to ALL GNOMES, but those Gnomes that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; choose to become a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MASTER-TINKERER would have to coose to do so as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CLASS just like a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Magic-User has to choose what type of caster he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wants to be, a Gnome<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would have to choose between being a normal class of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gnome, or a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MASTER-TINKERER.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gnomes that do this would be able to create the more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; elaborate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tinkers such as the VLC&#39;s and VLH&#39;s and the more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sought-after pieces<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of equipment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are asking about the balance of having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; characters with Pet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Clockwork Dragons or Krackens&#39;, then remember. These<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MASTER-TINKERERS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to spend hundreds of plat just to earn the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SKILL to create these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; creatures, and then spend the time to collect the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pieces of these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; creatures (How many dragons do you think it would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; take to kill, just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to collect every single dragon piece? Thats a LOT of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WORK), and then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the pure plat and time to collect the pieces to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thier brainbox!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What if it fails? We are talking possibly 3-4 WEEKS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Real time in lost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Plat and Time, all in a blink of an eye.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, there would be lots of Clockwork rats and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiders, but who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cares? My Enchanter&#39;s First-level apparition can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; demolish those!
