I would never ever selll a aqua lung for 400 pp, thats just <br/>\n&gt;insane and plain stupid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;900-1000 pp for it is fair i think  and   with a note with it that if they <br/>\n&gt;come back for an uppgrade to Rebreather for say 1000 more + componet cost. <br/>\n&gt;That would be around 1600 pp i think, is that right ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I dont sell the fishing pole and those outher low skill items outher if <br/>\n&gt;anyone order it, i get to many failures even  on trivial items to be worth <br/>\n&gt;making them and selling them at a large scale. Take Bow cam�s for example, <br/>\n&gt;i gor an order of 8 cam�s it took 12 tries to make 8, thats 4 failures and <br/>\n&gt;i sold them for 25 pp each, it�s almost nno profit at all so     in the <br/>\n&gt;futare i�m going to charge 30 pp for them i think if i even sell them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Askur of Veeshan </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
