I had a partner stand by the star <br/>\nand keep it turned, here is what it doesn&#39;t do: Open the chest near the fish <br/>\ngoods selling clockwork. Open up anything in the deep deep pool of water in <br/>\nthe very back of Ak&#39;anon by the junk yard man. Open up anything in the zoo <br/>\nor the rest of that building, open up anything in the two smaller towers <br/>\noutside of the castle. I havn&#39;t searched the castle itself, or the mines, or <br/>\nnear the gate, or anywhere else i havn&#39;t mentioned. The door sound you hear <br/>\nwhen you turn the crystal is just the crystal itself turning, if it does in <br/>\nfact open something up, its not near by, i have also eliminated that, and <br/>\nalso, we checked the sound out, and the farther you are away from the <br/>\ncrystal the feinter the sound becomes, so its not the door yourself you are <br/>\nhearing. It might just not open anything at all, wouldn&#39;t be suprised, but <br/>\nthat would also be a waste of a hidden little level, anyway, i doubt i will <br/>\ndo a whole lot more searching, as its pretty boring, but i did a lot <br/>\nalready, try and work from there if you can, i would like to see if this <br/>\nthing does anything.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
