He claims that the npc is 50th level and <br/>\n&gt; that the diamond dust is a rare drop item off it. I am thinking that this<br/>\n&gt; could mean that the npc may be in the planes but that is merley speculation.<br/>\n&gt; I wish he would give up the info but he is keeping it hidden from all for<br/>\n&gt; another gnome.
