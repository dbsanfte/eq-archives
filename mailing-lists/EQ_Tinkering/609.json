I sank 300plat into tinkering (flameless lanterns)<br/>\nand didn&#39;t increase one darn skill point.  That&#39;s either broken, or a sick<br/>\njoke on verants side.  Good lord they must be laughin their asses off at<br/>\npeople that are tryin to raise skill in tinkering.  With the stuff being<br/>\nnon-stackable (for the most part), it takes forever and a year to make<br/>\nstuff, and then to get no skill raise.

He said he heard of cases<br/>\n&gt; that 10,000 Plat was needed to get a point, I kinda lost it there and<br/>\ncalled<br/>\n&gt; EQ many names we can&#39;t say in public (but not to him, just to EQ, not a<br/>\ngood<br/>\n&gt; idea to piss of a Guide  ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, I wanted to see if there were any Gnomes that did get their skill up,<br/>\n&gt; and if so how?  You can check to see if your skill has moved from its base<br/>\n&gt; 50 by going to your skills and checking to see if it is still &quot;Below<br/>\n&gt; Average&quot; or not, as average stats at 51.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trying to find a pattern here, GM said Tinkering not broken, I say it is<br/>\n&gt; from what I have seen on my character, and from listening to others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dass Swiftruner,<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Celebrate the NEW ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; Enter to win a trip to Hawaii!
