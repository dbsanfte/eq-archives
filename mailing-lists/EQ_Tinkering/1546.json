It&#39;s from killing Red 5 in the back of the mines of malfunction and bringing back his blackbox. Although you have to put blackbox fragments in it and combine it to get the complete blackbox. Then you take it back to Manik Compolten (?) in the warrior&#39;s guild to get a random piece of patchwork armor or the bullsmasher. Althought getting the bullsmasher is rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nDohpaz<br/>\nRetired gnome magician<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Quasinom de Plume <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, December 13, 1999 4:38 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Diamond Dust possible location...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ******************************  SPOILER  ********************************<br/>\n<br/>\n  You&#39;re looking for Duster X and Duster V.  Duster V is a fairly common<br/>\n  spawn and travels from the front gate to the throne room.  Duster X (and<br/>\n  do not mistake this with Cleaner X - you will take a faction hit if you<br/>\n  kill this one) is a much rarer spawn (heh I&#39;ve seen it once only) and<br/>\n  spawns back near the mines of malfuntion by the water wheel, although it<br/>\n  apparently will travel to the little islands in the lake.  Usually a<br/>\n  clockwork scrubber will spawn in it&#39;s place and will stay there for<br/>\n  several hours.  You could try killing the scrubber to get it to spawn but<br/>\n  you will take faction hits for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Once you return the two scrap metal pieces, you will receive the<br/>\n  Bullsmasher, which is a decent teen-lvl weapon.  I can&#39;t remeber the stats<br/>\n  off-hand but the weapon is for small races only and adds +2 to 3 stats if<br/>\n  I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\n  QdP<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- Gazamel Prime &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gazamel@...\">gazamel@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Ok, this may be another wild goose chase, but I poked<br/>\n  &gt; around some in Ak&#39;Anon, and I talked to everyone I<br/>\n  &gt; could find about diamond dust.
