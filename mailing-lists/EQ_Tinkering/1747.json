Expensive failures.<br/>\nI know I had the right items thanks to Gnomad&#39;s research.  <br/>\nI was sadden to discover it was no longer publically accessable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember seeing at EQVault that Tinkerer Fulcrum had <br/>\nrecently opened his library, but other than a quick summary <br/>\nvisit, I didn&#39;t have time to read it all in one sitting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI searched through the archives here and found the reference again:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/eqtinker\">http://www.geocities.com/eqtinker</a>  <br/>\n(I added it into the EQ_Gnomes community links also).<br/>\n<br/>\nI checked the research notes on the Failed Thermal Cloak Recipes <br/>\nand have some ideas of my own to throw out.
