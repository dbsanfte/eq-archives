I thought maybe there was something to the fact<br/>\nthat you can stop the wheels inside from spinning by clicking on them.  Also<br/>\nI discovered you can stop the windmill&#39;s blades from spinning by getting<br/>\nunder them and clicking on them.  When you click on the wheels inside they<br/>\nstop for a while then start spinning again, but when you click on the blades<br/>\nand make them stop, they stay stopped.  And the blades and the wheels spin<br/>\nindependently.  I haven&#39;t been able to figure out the purpose for making<br/>\nthem stop.  I also got someone cast levitate on me and I was able to explore<br/>\nthe outsides of the windmill towers.  I even managed to get to the top of<br/>\nthe windmills by climbing around on the blades.  I didn&#39;t find anything.<br/>\nI&#39;d really like to know what the purpose is of being able to control the<br/>\nwindmills like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly thing I can think of is either the gm meant the tinkering books at the<br/>\nmerchant or there&#39;s something to do with the npcs there.  I&#39;m level 22 and<br/>\nJogle cons blue to me.  And he does walk out into the field alone from time<br/>\nto time.  I&#39;d hate to do it, but it might be possible to kill him when he&#39;s<br/>\nout there.  Anyone know what he drops if anything?<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\ngr0k - Stranger in a Strange Land - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juju.org\">http://www.juju.org</a><br/>\n&quot;Linux... find out what you&#39;ve been missing while<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been rebooting Windows NT&quot; - Infoworld</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
