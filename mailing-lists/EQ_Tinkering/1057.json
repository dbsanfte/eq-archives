We&#39;re all on<br/>\ndifferent servers so we can do a monthly gnomefest.  Say the first of each<br/>\nmonth (since we&#39;re all so short) or if people find it easier to accomodate<br/>\nweekend schedules, the first Saturday of the month.  Pick a different server<br/>\nevery month.  Maybe do some dueling competitions, some drunken casting, some<br/>\nminor illusion art etc.  Perhaps see just how many level 1 chars it does<br/>\ntake to kill the mino hero (I&#39;ll bet on about 612, provided at least 20 are<br/>\non him at a time)...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought.  Preferably something that doesn&#39;t require a lot of<br/>\npreparations besides buying an insane amout of alcohol and a little advance<br/>\nwarning to the GMs to let them know to expect heavy zone loads.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would we call it?  Gnomapalooza?  Gnomestock?  Gnomes are not Eunuchs<br/>\n(that&#39;s one for you Gr0k)?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
