I set out with the intent of 16 flameless lanters (32pp). <br/>\nbought 16 waters, 16 gnomish spirits (combined to make firewater), 16 lanterns,<br/>\nand 16 metal twines.  I also grabbed some bolts and grease to make cams.  I sit<br/>\ndown, and start tinkering.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are my results:<br/>\n8 successful Flameless Lanterns<br/>\n8 failed lanterns<br/>\n2 failed cams <br/>\n0 raise in skill<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I quit.  No more tinkering for me.  If they are going to be so bold as to<br/>\nnever allow a SINGLE point of skill to raise after 50pp spent and 18 attempts<br/>\nat mediochre (useless) items, then to hell with this skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are we all getting hyped over anyway?  Every other trade skill I have<br/>\ntried went up after a few attempts/failures when I was doing items of an<br/>\nacceptable skill level.  If you spend 32pp doing bakery, you&#39;re close to<br/>\nmaster!  With smithing, I got into my 40&#39;s after about 10pp.  But nooooo... we<br/>\nstart at an even 50 so it&#39;s up to us to dump 1000&#39;s of pp into it to raise it<br/>\nfrom 50 to 70ish.  What a bunch of crap.  The ONLY profitable and worthwhile<br/>\ntrade skill is Jewelcraft, which is limited to Enchanters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is, the items we make are pointless.  Cams are the only plausable<br/>\nitem we can currently construct that might make tinkering worth it. <br/>\nUnfortunately BOWS aren&#39;t that great, and due to their limited usability cams<br/>\nare not a viable means of living.  Especially when you factor in failure rates<br/>\nand the amount of money you need to dump into it to get your skill high enough<br/>\nto make cams reliably.  A spyglass?  A collapsable fishing pole?  And to think<br/>\nof all the time and effort we have spent TRYING to figure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s your hint:  Verant doesn&#39;t care about tinkering and it&#39;s doubtful they<br/>\never will.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow often do you hear someone walk around screaming &quot;HEY!  SELLING large jars! <br/>\nonly 1pp!! gimme a tell!&quot;  The same addage carries over to tinkering.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck at finding something guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kryogen Katspaw<br/>\n31st Gnome Wizard, Bertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
