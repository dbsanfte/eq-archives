It has been awhile so please excuse me<br/>\nif I don&#39;t remember the notation so I&#39;ll do this long hand.  I can look up<br/>\nthe formula if you want but assuming you can use 2 of any item the one you<br/>\nare looking for is sampling with single replacement. The problem isn&#39;t a<br/>\nsimple factorial problem because in many cases we are allowing items to<br/>\nrepeat.  So it isn&#39;t 13x12...x6x5 one less for each slot of the box. In many<br/>\nof the formulas I see people use two or more ingredients (i.e. 2xmetal rods)<br/>\nAssuming that no item is used more than twice but that all items may be used<br/>\nup to twice you would end up with a max of<br/>\n13x13x12x12x11x11x10x10=294,465,600.  Even if you assume only one component<br/>\ncan be used twice with up to 8 components with 13 possible choices you get<br/>\n13x13x12x11x10x9x8x7=10,221,120<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I think the way you came up with that formula is good. (It must be, because<br/>\n&gt;it was what I came up with at first, lol)<br/>\n&gt;Problem is it is wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Suppose we have 13 types of items in 100 slots.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That gives us 13^100/100! which is less than 1. (Can&#39;t be right.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The other problem I had with it is that it does not produce an integer<br/>\n&gt;number. What is 0.3 combinations? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
