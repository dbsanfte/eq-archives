Why exactly do you think it&#39;s in Solusek&#39;s Eye?  What a<br/>\nhorrid place to hide something like that.  Tho, on second thought it&#39;s<br/>\nnot a bad idea.  Keep the good stuff for the brave.  As I understand<br/>\nit there is a way to tailor snakeskin gear.  I met someone who&#39;s<br/>\nfriend made some.
