That isn&#39;t worth 8000 pp to me!  If we<br/>\n&gt; could make one it&#39;ll likely cost us 13000pp to produce (compass).  Or it&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; cost 3000pp to make and then not work (cams).  Nonetheless, you won&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; any experience from it because you&#39;d get the tattered backpack back on a<br/>\n&gt; failed attempt.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, no luck yet on the other books.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations MilitaryEFM.
