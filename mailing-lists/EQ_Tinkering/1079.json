Well the new recipes kick ass, even a <br/>\nlvl 12 can tinkering most of em.  :P  Anyways last night I was messaging a <br/>\ncouple tinkers on Xegony who had been bothering my friend becuase he had a <br/>\ncollapsable fishing pole.  They said that they should be the only ones who <br/>\nknew how to do it and called him a cheater and a whole bunch of other stuff. <br/>\n  Anyway while I was talking to them I found out this is their price list:<br/>\n5pp for fireworks(Not sure there worth that much)<br/>\n50pp stalking probe<br/>\n15pp fishing pole<br/>\n100pp Spyglass<br/>\nAlso when I inquired where they got the book from they wouldn&#39;t tell me <br/>\nexactly but they did tell me that it was a very high quest.  It took a lvl <br/>\n47 warrior to complete the quest.  Also I found out that the quest is not in <br/>\nAkanon but I didn&#39;t ask about Steamfont.  Well that&#39;s all the info I have <br/>\nfor right now.  Happy questing. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcoux<br/>\nLvl 12 Magician on Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
