I read in another post that<br/>\nsomeone found one and the runes were very similar to the ones on the<br/>\nGnomish Clock in Qeynos. (I&#39;m trying to determine where he might have<br/>\nfound this note)  Perhaps if these runes could be deciphered, they might<br/>\nlead to a clue to tinkering a collapsable fishing rod.  Anyone notice<br/>\nthese runes anywhere else?  Perhaps somewhere in Ak&#39;anon?<br/>\n<br/>\nQuasinom de Plume<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
