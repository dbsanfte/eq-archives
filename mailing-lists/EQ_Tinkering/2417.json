Consumables are <br/>\naround 100pp.  The question is whether you will raise your skill from <br/>\nattempting armor.  Because the trivial point for the armor is higher than <br/>\nrebreathers, and you fail considerably on them, you will raise your skill <br/>\nat a slower rate than if you attempted the rebreathers.  Therefore, IF it <br/>\ntakes 100 attempts to raise one point from making armor versus 10 attempts <br/>\nfrom making rebreathers (I&#39;ve averaged one point per 10 attempts in <br/>\ngeneral), then it would be a wash besides the collection of the wings.  I <br/>\nwould be surprised its this bad, so I guess maybe 20 attempts at armor will <br/>\nraise a point.  Therefore, each point would cost 2000pp plus 20 holgresh <br/>\nwings.  Versus 10000pp involved with rebreathers.  And who knows, you&#39;re <br/>\nbound to get lucky once and actually make a piece of armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy plan is to camp the holgresh and collect a load of wings and fur and try <br/>\nto raise my skill that way.  Its currently 143, so I will finish out with <br/>\naqualungs at first.  At least they sell back at 30pp below cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso another factor is time.  Think about how much money you have to carry <br/>\nwith you from the bank if you want to attempt 10 rebreathers.  Thats <br/>\n10kpp.  You can&#39;t move with that much money, you will have to attempt 3 or <br/>\n4 rebreathers at a time max, then go back to the bank for more money.  With <br/>\nthe armor, most all items are stackable, the heavy non stackable items <br/>\nbeing the armor... which you get back when you fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 07:02 PM 12/20/2000 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;This seems really sad.  The only thing to raise tinkering that high<br/>\n&gt;currently is rebreathers, correct?  Which means a ton of money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On the other hand, does any of the dropped items you need stack?  If<br/>\n&gt;so, it might be possible to carry over a nice supply of them to<br/>\n&gt;Steamfont and keep making attempts at the Watchman armor.  If the<br/>\n&gt;plate is returned, then it might be cheaper than Rebreathers.  Can<br/>\n&gt;anyone confirm this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks, my tinkering is up to 128, so I know I have some work to do<br/>\n&gt;and any help would be appreciated.  Now, I just have to find the<br/>\n&gt;funds.  hmm...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Norbert Gearsmith<br/>\n&gt;Gem Chopper on E&#39;Ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
