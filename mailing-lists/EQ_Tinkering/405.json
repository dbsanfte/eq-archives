I think we&#39;re right with<br/>\nthe metal shaft and rod combos but we&#39;re missing something.  Here&#39;s a few<br/>\nof my thoughts thus far:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Fletching strings or dwarven wire as a component seems unlikely.<br/>\nAlthough some items need things MADE by other trade skills (compass), I<br/>\ncan&#39;t think of anything that requires you buy components from a different<br/>\ntrade skill.  Dwarven wire is for the Trueshot Bow quest (?) and takes a<br/>\nwhile to obtain - lots of travelling.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Spiderling silk sounds like a good possibility.  Watch out though, there<br/>\nis SPIDER silk, and SPIDERLING silk.  The latter seems more likely as<br/>\nspiderlings are right in Steamfont and it would be very similar to how the<br/>\nlockpicks need a rat ear.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Spriket?  Assuming that the two books are all that exists of tinkering<br/>\nnow, a spriket is the only item not used for any project.  What is a<br/>\nspriket though?  Not in the dictionary...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Raw bamboo doesn&#39;t seem like a likely component.  It is a bard<br/>\ninstrument, also the pic of the collapsible pole shows it constructed of<br/>\nmetal.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A bottle as a possible component.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLuke</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
