Or did they actually use it on a gem?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a few ideas for what I think it might be used for. And remember, the chopper probably has to be used be *US* tinkers in *OUR* toolbox to be effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nIDEAS:<br/>\nUsed by Jewelers to enhance jewelry making (probably not)<br/>\nUsed by Jewelers to enhance or split a gem into multiple gems (disproved)<br/>\nUsed by *US* tinkers in a tool box on a gem to enhance or split a gem (possible)<br/>\nUsed by *US* to enhance some other unknown item (possible as well)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the item is mentioned in the books, I dont think that it is just another component for another item, but something that is used somehow, its just up to us to figure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMY 2 cents,<br/>\n<br/>\nFizzWizz of Tunare<br/>\nMaster Tinker (148)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
