The cave is very, very<br/>\n&gt; dark, and also quite large. There is a glowing room with the rod for the Ice<br/>\n&gt; Comet quest in a little shack surrounded by ice bones. From there take a<br/>\n&gt; left I think and hug the right wall and you&#39;ll see him, a guy named<br/>\n&gt; Mc&lt;something&gt; standing next to a little goblin diver. I think he was a<br/>\n&gt; barbarian or human, but did not get close at all. In any case he conned red<br/>\n&gt; at L29 and was aggro to my usually-lovable agnostic barbarian warrior. I<br/>\n&gt; have heard rumor that he is L35. I have never heard of him being killed, so<br/>\n&gt; cannot say what he drops; not many people even seem to know he exists. I<br/>\n&gt; doubt that he is related to tinkering, but would be a fun fight so go kill<br/>\n&gt; him anyway &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Lenn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
