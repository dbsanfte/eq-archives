It was looted off the<br/>\ncorpse of the racekilling NPC Gnome...  The stats on the dagger are no<br/>\nbetter than one you&#39;d fish up but it is a LORE ITEM so I&#39;m guessing its<br/>\npart of one of those &#39;Bring proof you killed so-and-so for your reward&#39;<br/>\ntype deals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as for looking for more tinkering books, has anyone checked the Mino<br/>\ncaves?  There are Gnomes that walk around killstealing minos, has anyone<br/>\never tried right-clicking on them to attempt to buy?  Or trying to hail<br/>\nthem for a quest?  AFAIK, there are several Gnomes in the caves but I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t searched much, mainly because I&#39;m in the Karanas area :P  Anyone<br/>\nthat knows anything about the NPCs in the cave or want to check it out?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Luke<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ tinkering guide web site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home1.gte.net/jlukas/eq/tinker.htm\">http://home1.gte.net/jlukas/eq/tinker.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Sort of working on improving the site a bit, not much new news to add<br/>\nthough.
