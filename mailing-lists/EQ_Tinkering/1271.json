They allow trade skills because they are so<br/>\nwidely desired, but they always would prefer that you go out and kill things<br/>\nto get good items instead.  The trade skills will NEVER allow you to create<br/>\nsomething good for less effort than it would take to kill something for it<br/>\nor get enough money to buy it from somebody who did.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo really they&#39;re just following their design, which shows some remarkable<br/>\nunity of purpose.  On the flipside though, the emphasis on PvE turns a lot<br/>\nof people off over time.  It would be nice if there were ways to be a viable<br/>\n&quot;smith&quot; or &quot;artisan&quot; character.  There isn&#39;t though, and given their<br/>\ndedication to PvE (and their original design) it&#39;s highly unlikely it ever<br/>\nwill be.  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since beta 2 and I have to say that while I<br/>\ndon&#39;t always agree with Verant, they are remarkably consistent and they<br/>\nalmost always have good reasons for what they do (minus bugs).<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who want to do a lot of crafty type things will probably have to wait<br/>\nuntil a game comes along that emphasizes that instead of killing stuff.  EQ<br/>\nis an excellent game, but it&#39;s scope is somewhat limited in that respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ms277017@...\">ms277017@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYes... I think verant is still riding their same old no class useless<br/>\nfanatic rage... thats why you see gate potions cost about 1000pp, just<br/>\nbecause all the whining wizards and druids (im a druid btw, and they whine<br/>\nALOT, and have nothing to whine about!) think that they will become useless<br/>\nin groups... So I think this is part of it, they dont want to make<br/>\ndruids/enchanters/necros/sks feel less important by making it easy to<br/>\nobtain, so then people will think hmmm why dont I just get a druid or ranger<br/>\nto cast enduring breath instead of wasting 1000pp on a rebreather. Its a big<br/>\ndamn game for verant (literally) so they gotta make it as &quot;hard&quot; as possible<br/>\n=(. Not to mention that they doomed their own player economy by their making<br/>\ntrade skills damn near worthless, and weve seen evidence of that,<br/>\njewelcrafters have to sell their items at insane prices because they fail<br/>\neven at 200 skill, so nobody buys them. 600pp for a BP ring... hmm maybe I<br/>\ncan just keep my dervish rings and get a shaman in the party (I know its a<br/>\nludicrous thought but apparently this is what brad mcquaid thinks). lemme<br/>\nknow what you guys think on this whole trade skill business.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoisoner/potter/smith/baker/tinker of veeshan.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
