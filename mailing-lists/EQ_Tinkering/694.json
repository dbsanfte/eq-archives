I try to help, but you decline it. If what you<br/>\nwant is for me to truly leave with my information, then that is what I will<br/>\ndo. I will leave the choice up to you. I&#39;m trying to apologize by helping,<br/>\nbut you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all I&#39;m<br/>\nout here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What I<br/>\nhave to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just want<br/>\nto check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all hate<br/>\nme so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because<br/>\nyou think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all<br/>\nwith out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept it<br/>\nor decline it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
