So I went on to aqualungs.  10 attempts produced 2 aqualungs.<br/>\n&gt; No skill raises.  I had a Intel of 167, Wis of 137 and bought the items with<br/>\n&gt; 131 charisma (best price possible for my faction).  At this point I am<br/>\n&gt; doubting Wisdom has much to do with successful creations.  Am I haven&#39;t bad<br/>\n&gt; luck here?  Or is a 80% failure rate common?  I can&#39;t even imagine trying a<br/>\n&gt; rebreather at this rate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am wondering if we need to find a item that has better success rate than<br/>\n&gt; aqualungs to get skill higher.  But seems to be none to help with this.  Is<br/>\n&gt; anyone out there over 110 skill yet?  If so, give us some insight on costs<br/>\n&gt; and failure ratings.  At this rate, I need to sell aqualungs for thousands<br/>\n&gt; of PP rather than hundreds.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zebbi D&#39;Arcanus<br/>\n&gt; (45th Wizard of E&#39;Ci)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webmaster@...\">webmaster@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webmaster@...\">webmaster@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 3:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] A tale of woe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webmaster@...\">webmaster@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Although this is my first post to this list, ive been reading em everyday<br/>\n&gt; for the last few weeks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I too am an aspiring tinkerer (skill 106) and I have successfully made Lungs<br/>\n&gt; and Rebreathers alike.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well tonight, after a week of work, I took my 4000pp and went to make some<br/>\n&gt; lungs.
