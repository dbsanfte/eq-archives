Firstly, he had to go and get the<br/>\n&gt;molds from The Feerrott, cuz the Freeport shop only has medium molds.<br/>\n&gt;Apparently there is no forge down there.  Secondly, it&#39;s nearly impossible<br/>\n&gt;for me (skill 110 ish) to make about four of the banded armour pieces.<br/>\n&gt;Thirdly, failures cost between 4pp and 6pp.  After three trips to the<br/>\n&gt;Feerrott for the troll, and literally hours of real time, I had made his<br/>\n&gt;banded at a loss to me of 100pp.  Oh, and I gained 2 points of skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ah well, I&#39;ll stick to jewellery and Steins I think.  I made the 100pp back<br/>\n&gt;in 1/2 hour from jewellery, and then sold a Stein for 300pp :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ian aka Poggin the Mostly-Deflated-but-now-Partially-Reinflated Gnome.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who cares?  That isn&#39;t tinkering, and failures cost me more than it cost you <br/>\nfor an entire set of banded.  Quit whining, tinerers lose over 200plat on <br/>\nfailed aqua lungs and over 900plat on failed rebreathers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
