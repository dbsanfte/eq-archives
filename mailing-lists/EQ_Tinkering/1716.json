He claims he can get the diamond dust for me, but won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; give up the npc that drops it. He claims that the npc is 50th level and <br/>\n&gt; that the diamond dust is a rare drop item off it. I am thinking that this<br/>\n&gt; could mean that the npc may be in the planes but that is merley speculation.<br/>\n&gt; I wish he would give up the info but he is keeping it hidden from all for<br/>\n&gt; another gnome. Well i hope this gives all you tinkerers hope:) Has anyone <br/>\n&gt; discovered what the formula is for the Thermal Cloak? Where can i aquire <br/>\n&gt; tattered belts?
