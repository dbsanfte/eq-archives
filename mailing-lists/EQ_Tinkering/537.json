I <br/>\nreally was being pathetically immature, I guess it was just becuase I had <br/>\njust gotten a clue, that really helps the discovery or the pole. You see it <br/>\nwould clear up alot, but I don&#39;t wish to tell because, I swore to the one <br/>\nwho told me the clue that I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone what it was that he said, <br/>\nand I don&#39;t want to dishonor him, or myself. They hold this secret pretty <br/>\nclose to thier hearts, and take it pretty seriously. I didn&#39;t want to <br/>\ndecieve this person. I can, when I want to, use words with the most <br/>\nexcellent of skill, like when I got a clue from the guy that part of this <br/>\nunknown organization, and I can also be a jerk and come off sounding like an <br/>\n8 year old troll, as you have learned, well I&#39;m sorry, and I hope you can <br/>\nunderstand why I feel that I must keep my knowledge a secret for now.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
