How do we all know that someone on this <br/>\nvery list might have given us a so called &quot;broken recipe&quot; and it was actually <br/>\nthe right one but they wanted to throw people off and have people not try it? <br/>\n Cause think about it if someone turns in a recipe that so called &quot;doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwork&quot; then NO ONE will even try that recipe again because they know it <br/>\n&quot;doesn&#39;t work&quot; thus they are one of the few people who can actually make it.  <br/>\nSo those are just my thoughts.  And as 4 the four slot thing I think that <br/>\nmight be real.  I think this recipe probably is 4 slots.  But then again how <br/>\ndo you all know that I haven&#39;t made one my self and just lying?  Dont trust <br/>\nany one cept guildmates that&#39;s what I have learned over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoj</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
