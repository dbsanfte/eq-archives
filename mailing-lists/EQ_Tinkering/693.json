Yes, the coin is for<br/>\nanother quest, but the underwater part of your report is interesting.  I<br/>\nused the underwater breathing spell and searched the deep water area below<br/>\nthe water wheel looking all over for a secret part of the wall, but found<br/>\nnothing.  I think now I&#39;ll try the rest of the Ak&#39;Anon underwater areas<br/>\nunless someone else has already done so.  Long ago I heard someone shout in<br/>\nSteamfont that the 3rd book was in Akanon somewhere, but that was before I<br/>\ngot interested in Tinkering (probably before I even knew what Tinkering<br/>\nwas), so I have no idea how true that information is.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAs far as other underwater areas to explore where the 3rd<br/>\nbook might be located that I know of are: 1) Kedge Keep in the Cauldron zone<br/>\n(but I hear that zone is not itemized yet until next patch), 2) under lake<br/>\nRathetear there is an area of high level Gobs and 3) in Everfrost there is a<br/>\nsmall underwater area with an NPC who usually attacks anyone on sight.  I<br/>\nhave not searched any of these areas yet.  Anyone know of other underwater<br/>\nareas?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tGood luck brothers and sisters!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tKilkin Cobblepot - 25th Gemchopper - Fen Ro<br/>\n\t\tKilzixplik - 18th Enchanter - Fen Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
