I spent about<br/>\n&gt; 60pp after selling back everything I made and raised my skill from 50 to 58.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If the skill cap is indeed (lvl * 5) - 13 (thanks Diabloklr) I have quite a<br/>\n&gt; way to go before my lvl 18 gnome wiz hits 77.  Time to make some moola!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing I did learn last night.  Tinkering rocks!  I love it.  I have<br/>\n&gt; never had so much fun with a trade skill.  There are all kinds of things to<br/>\n&gt; make.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, last night people asked to buy a spyglass, cams, and a compass from me<br/>\n&gt; when they heard I was trying to tinker.  So there is a market for some of<br/>\n&gt; this stuff even though the market may be small.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wopr &lt;Valiant Souls&gt;<br/>\n&gt; gnome wizard<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
