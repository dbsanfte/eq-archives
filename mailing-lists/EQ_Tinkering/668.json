Remember me? Well now... I imagine that you all hate me, but <br/>\n it matters not...<br/>\n <br/>\n I am the 8-year-old troll that made his exit from this list with one last <br/>\n letter admitting his faults...oh that&#39;s right though...I didn&#39;t write it did <br/>\n I? I got my intelligent mother (or was in brother?) to write it, and any <br/>\n more, &quot;intellectual&quot; sounding letters that I wrote in those rough days <br/>\n before I left, because 8-year-old-trolls don&#39;t write like that, of course. <br/>\n Yes yes, well I could please some of you and be an 8-year-old-troll by <br/>\n coming back after leaving you with my final letter that admitted that I had <br/>\n been an ass, and told you that you were all jerks, or I could have flung <br/>\n more mud, and gotten more personal and done even worse, gotten even more <br/>\n immature and done something even more immature, but I didn&#39;t, but why? I <br/>\n mean...an     8-year-old troll would do that, but I didn&#39;t, how could it be? <br/>\n It&#39;s because I&#39;m not an 8-year old troll, its because I am better than you <br/>\n claim, its because I just let it go when you insulted me even after I <br/>\n totally, and outright apologized, and admitted all your true, but crude <br/>\n insults about me to be true. I am not back to start anything either. I am <br/>\n back to reveal something of great importance, not only to tinkering, but <br/>\n possibly to the entire world of Norrath. Yes yes, I know the information I <br/>\n hold in itself is truly more or less insignificant to anyone BUT tinkerers, <br/>\n and I know that it it can DIRECTLY not have much effect on much more than <br/>\n the tinkering world, but it potentially can have great effect indirectly of <br/>\n the entire game, in the long run when I really though about it. This is why <br/>\n I have decided to reveal me information to you. I know that I need help. I <br/>\n know that I alone cannot find something that a combined effort of maybe 1000 <br/>\n people or more could not, but I DID find out the information that could <br/>\n truly be one of the main reason that those 1000 people find the information <br/>\n that they seek. Many of you may belive that I tell you what I know now, <br/>\n because what needs to be done is out of my reach, for higher levels, and I <br/>\n cannot complete it, but this is not true. In fact, I don&#39;t even know for <br/>\n sure if you even need to be a high level to get what we seek so vehemently <br/>\n for, but I am going to tell you the information none-the-less. Right now, I <br/>\n haven&#39;t been able to search the area where I think that the item, or <br/>\n information is located in, because I have been caught somewhere trying to <br/>\n gain a few levels before I move on. I wish to check out the area I think it <br/>\n is in a bit myself before I reveal what I know. If I find nothing, I will <br/>\n tell you all the clue I have extracted, for I have realized in total <br/>\n wholeness the folly of my selfish, idiotic thinking, but, even if I DO find <br/>\n what we seek on my own, I shall reveal to all what I find, why? Because it <br/>\n is only right. You have ALL put so much money, time, mind, and heart into <br/>\n finding it, and you DO deserve to know if I find it.<br/>\n <br/>\n I wrote you all this letter to tell you my decision. I must now waste no <br/>\n more time, I will get those two levels with godspeed and race to where I <br/>\n need to go and search, for I want to have SOMETHING to report to you, my <br/>\n fellow, loyal tinkerers as soon as possible, for we are all united by this <br/>\n list for one goal, and one purpose, and that is to further, the research, <br/>\n and the legend, and legacy of tinkering!!!<br/>\n <br/>\n I shall now be off my friends, I will return with my report as soon as I <br/>\n can, and either way, I&#39;ll have something interesting to tell you.<br/>\n <br/>\n Good luck to you all till then.<br/>\n <br/>\n Sniffledoo Copperheart.<br/>\n <br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n ----------------------- Headers --------------------------------<br/>\n Return-Path: &lt;errors-150202-665-goodsmritn=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aol.com@onelist.com\">aol.com@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n Received: from  rly-yc05.mx.aol.com (rly-yc05.mail.aol.com [172.18.149.37]) <br/>\nby air-yc03.mail.aol.com (vx) with ESMTP; Sun, 03 Oct 1999 01:52:41 -0400<br/>\n Received: from  onelist.com (pop3.onelist.com [209.207.164.221]) by <br/>\nrly-yc05.mx.aol.com (v61.13) with ESMTP; Sun, 03 Oct 1999 01:52:29 -0400<br/>\n Received: (qmail 107 invoked by alias); 3 Oct 1999 05:52:33 -0000<br/>\n Received: (qmail 102 invoked from network); 3 Oct 1999 05:52:32 -0000<br/>\n Received: from unknown (209.207.164.241) by pop3.onelist.com with QMQP; 3 <br/>\nOct 1999 05:52:32 -0000<br/>\n Received: from unknown (HELO hotmail.com) (216.33.149.90) by <br/>\nmta2.onelist.com with SMTP; 3 Oct 1999 05:57:52 -0000<br/>\n Received: (qmail 42717 invoked by uid 0); 3 Oct 1999 05:52:27 -0000<br/>\n Message-ID: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:19991003055227.42716.qmail@...\">19991003055227.42716.qmail@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n Received: from 204.71.22.19 by www.hotmail.com with HTTP; Sat, 02 Oct 1999 <br/>\n22:52:24 PDT<br/>\n X-Originating-IP: [204.71.22.19]<br/>\n From: &quot;Joshua Bednarz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thewhitemage@...\">thewhitemage@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\n Date: Sun, 03 Oct 1999 05:52:24 GMT<br/>\n Mime-Version: 1.0<br/>\n Mailing-List: list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a>; contact <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering-owner@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering-owner@onelist.com</a><br/>\n Delivered-To: mailing list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\n Precedence: bulk<br/>\n List-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering-unsubscribe@...\">EQ_Tinkering-unsubscribe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n Reply-to: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a><br/>\n Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] Revelations...<br/>\n Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good luck sniffledoo......Cloverleaf&lt;Fennin Ro server&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
