Looking on the &#39;Database&#39; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)\">http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)</a> I see that not many <br/>\n&gt; &gt;combinations have been tried with the cork, sprocket, or cloth twine. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Although they dont seem to be the most likely candidates, I could see <br/>\n&gt; &gt;them as a possibility.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With all the misses, I just cant help thinking we have missed &gt;something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am also beginning to think that the earlier rumors of the fishing &gt;pole <br/>\n&gt;being makable are bull shit. If someone is making the poles and &gt;the eye <br/>\n&gt;glasses, I would have thought we would have heard about more &gt;people having <br/>\n&gt;them. We have not heard a peep from anyone since. &gt;Perhaps as Luke said, <br/>\n&gt;the pole was given as part of a GM quest, and &gt;was not actually tinkered.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think it says something about the sad state of tinkering when &gt;our &gt;&#39;holy <br/>\n&gt;grail&#39; is a damn fishing pole =|<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;FizzWizz of tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All I know is this much, the fishing pole was given out by a GM (from what <br/>\nI&#39;ve read and been told).
