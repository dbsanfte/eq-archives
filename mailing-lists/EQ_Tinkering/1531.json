People speak so freely about<br/>\nwhat they know is right or wrong without even really finding out a deffinent<br/>\nasnwer for themselves. As for the person that is angry about this thread,<br/>\nman lighten up. As for right now everyone knows that Tinkering like Reaserch<br/>\nis a trade skill. That means that when you learn it you can continue to<br/>\nlearn with out me capped out on a level. I have read many threads where<br/>\npeople believe this or that. Then when someone says something and everyone<br/>\nfinds out it was true they are like I knew that. Ok As far as it has been<br/>\nsaid my BM is that on all trade skills includeing research and the other<br/>\nhard to raise skills there is no cap per level. So I believe that it is<br/>\npossible to go above actually I have a gnome with 77 and I am 18 that is 2<br/>\npoints above max. I got the money to raise this from my guild but none the<br/>\nless. FRom my experiance and what has been said it seems the either one the<br/>\ncap is different or the cap is gone. I do not doubt anything people have<br/>\nsaid but it seems that, there may be alot of truth in some things.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
