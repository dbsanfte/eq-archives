He raised his skill up by harvesting<br/>\n&gt;the coral mesh from sharks (lvl 20ish) in the OOT.  He<br/>\n&gt;never shared the information with anyone.  Now the<br/>\n&gt;mobs stopped dropping the items, and he&#39;s got a lock<br/>\n&gt;on our market.  He also knows the location of diamond<br/>\n&gt;dust, but refuses to tell anyone where it is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pretty cool guy, eh?  He once told me that he&#39;d tell<br/>\n&gt;me where diamond dust was if I got him twinked to<br/>\n&gt;level 39.  Nope, not worth it to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, if you all want to complain about tinkering to<br/>\n&gt;someone, let Mauldoon, from Solusek Ro, know how you<br/>\n&gt;feel.  Be forewarned that his ego is about the size of<br/>\n&gt;Long Island.
