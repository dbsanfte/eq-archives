You <br/>\npeople that reply to messages and judt delete everything need to stop. I <br/>\nmean, you see I get a message saying one line of text answering a question, <br/>\nand since these messages are not all super orderly and arranges by topics of <br/>\nconversation or anythnig, its usually really hard to know whats being talk <br/>\nabout, for example: Say a message was sent saying: &quot;Is tinkering a cool <br/>\nskill?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen someone deletes everything in the previous message and says: &quot;No, it <br/>\nsucks, we can&#39;t make a darned useful thing!&quot;, well then unless you <br/>\nremembered back to the previous message, you might not know what he meant, <br/>\nas you can see, so could you at least leave the message text from the <br/>\nprevious message if possible so to make it easier for people to discuss <br/>\nthings, making it more like a &quot;Message Board&quot;, and less like a chat room. <br/>\nThanx.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
