Here&#39;s what<br/>\ni have heard, there are three other books(besides the two at mills)<br/>\nwhere or when you get em is beyond me. I too have made the firewater,<br/>\nand the lantern, and say one person auctioning off the cams for the<br/>\nbows, so i know those have been made also. As has already been posted i<br/>\ntoo heard that the infravision goggles instructions came from a quest.<br/>\nWhich one i don&#39;t know. Also i know as a fact that you can tinker<br/>\nsuccessfully at level 1, but cannot gain any skill level til level 16.<br/>\nSo all of you that are waiting to try it, go for it...it will work, i<br/>\ndecided to try it at level 11 with my gnome, and made fire water on<br/>\nfirst try. Also i believe that you can make the thermal cloak from just<br/>\nabout any cloak...doesn&#39;t have to be tattered... I am wanting to try<br/>\nsimilar things with lanterns ans stuff..(i.e. use small lantern and<br/>\nsuch). If anyone has tried it with other items please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Jaqui(math marr)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
