Robes are merely Cloaks with belts, if you think about it. Perhaps<br/>\nGimblestan used a Robe in his construction of the Thermal Cloak, and<br/>\nthat is why the Tattered Gnomish Cloak and belt are not two seperate<br/>\ncomponents. Also, most of the newbie robes have names like &#39;Singed&#39;,<br/>\n&#39;Old Torn&#39;, etc... perhaps one of the newbie robes from one of the<br/>\nguilds is a &#39;Tattered&#39; Robe, and it would be considered gnomish because<br/>\nonly gnomes can use it?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Also, when I was recently shopping at one of the merchants in the<br/>\nLibrary, I saw this item. (see attachment). Mantles can also be<br/>\nconsidered cloaks...<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Regards,<br/>\nRzech the Tinker<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Attachment is too big to send with this message, I will send it<br/>\nseperately</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
