<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728982266">I have 117 skill on Solusek Ro.  I have been selling<br/>
Aqualungs for 400 plat, and rebreathers for 3k plat. <br/>
My success rates vary on lungs, but are consistent<br/>
with rebreathers.  I have about 150 int and 135 wisdom<br/>
when I tinker, not too shabby for a warrior =)<br/>
<br/>
There really aren&#39;t more than a handful of tinkers on<br/>
our server (2, maybe 3 who can make lungs), yet there<br/>
is still no market.  It&#39;s really hard to sell either<br/>
of them since people can&#39;t really rationalize spending<br/>
that much money, even though it will save their life. <br/>
I tire of hearing the snide shouts when I auction my<br/>
wares, things like &quot;That&#39;s a waste of plat!&quot; and &quot;What<br/>
a rip off!&quot;, and quite a few more colorful ones, which<br/>
I won&#39;t go into detail here about.  The state of our<br/>
trade skill is sad, we are so limited in what we make<br/>
that it&#39;s almost pointless to pursue it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who sells rebreathers for 2500 is insane, I<br/>
agree there.  My success rate is 33% exactly, so the<br/>
3k plat I sell them for only covers my expenses, with<br/>
zero profit.  Ask a jeweller to sell their wares with<br/>
the same profit and they&#39;ll laugh you out of Kelethin.<br/>
 Lungs are equivalent in cost to a plat sapphire<br/>
necklace, yet are sold for 400 compared to 1000.  <br/>
<br/>
I am 100% on tinkering gemcutters - 3 for 3.  If you<br/>
can make those, do so, it&#39;s been hinted that they will<br/>
be EXTREMELY valuable in the expansion, and given the<br/>
difficulty of getting diamond dust, it makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you all, and pray for a re-vamp of the<br/>
trade soon.  Maybe we&#39;ll get to make more interesting<br/>
things. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Selling Rebreathers for 2500p is mad. Sure you get<br/>
&gt; em sold, and it is a way <br/>
&gt; of keeping &quot;afloat&quot; as those who have plat to spare<br/>
&gt; want to sell em off as <br/>
&gt; fast as they can to tinker more. I am at the stage<br/>
&gt; where I can do <br/>
&gt; rebreathers, but I fail a LOT still. Some ppl on my<br/>
&gt; server has been selling <br/>
&gt; off rebreathers from 7-10kpp which is defenitly too<br/>
&gt; much IMO. I was <br/>
&gt; auctioning them for 3.5k which I thought was too low<br/>
&gt; but I thought was the <br/>
&gt; goin price, now ppl tell me to sell them for no less<br/>
&gt; than 5kp, so that is <br/>
&gt; what I will charge for them, might go down to 4 or<br/>
&gt; 4.5 if they buy more than <br/>
&gt; one, or return me an aqualung as a part deal.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With a 50% failure rate, a rebreather would cost<br/>
&gt; 1900p to make, at least for <br/>
&gt; me, if you succeed on both lungs, sell em for 2500<br/>
&gt; and you make a measly <br/>
&gt; 600p profit. I have skill of 118 now, and it cost me<br/>
&gt; nearly 28k to get there <br/>
&gt; (i know, i have been doin something wrong somewhere<br/>
&gt; probably, eheh) and with <br/>
&gt; a 600p profit on each rebreather I&#39;ll never get that<br/>
&gt; money back. I think 5kp <br/>
&gt; for a rebreather is a decent price...<br/>
