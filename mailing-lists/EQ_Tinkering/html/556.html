<div id="ygrps-yiv-892429882">I really wanted to stay on this list and learn about tinkering but this is <br/>
damn pathetic.  We got people who make arrogant comments and then the people <br/>
who are even dumber are the people who fill up ur mailbox with complaints <br/>
about one single email and turn it into a big event or something.  I wanted <br/>
to share knowledge about tinkering and be taught knowledge but this list <br/>
keeps going in circles.  If you are sending something that you would not want <br/>
in ur mailbox then ur just messed up.  Think about it as if someone was <br/>
sending YOU an email that said &quot;screw that&quot; and that&#39;s it.  It would piss you <br/>
off.  And it has pissed me off.  So I am leaving this list until the people <br/>
on it can learn to respect the power over other peoples mailboxes that they <br/>
have.<br/>
