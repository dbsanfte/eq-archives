<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062854787">I firmly belive that there is NO third book in the game. Plus Duh! Meldrath <br/>
would be the first place to look, he&#39;s killed all the time, someone would <br/>
have said something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Was emailed a possible spoiler about the rumored missing 3rd book today. <br/>
&gt;The<br/>
&gt;email claimed that &quot;Meldrath&quot; drops the book we&#39;ve all been looking for. I<br/>
&gt;am unable to verify because I&#39;m at work. </span></blockquote></div>
