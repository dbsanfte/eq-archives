<b>Subject:</b> Looking for tinkering items on karana <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530465663">I&#39;m Davidson On the karana server. I am looking to buy 1 fishing pole, 1 for sure 2 maybe spy glasses. And 20 fireworks. I&#39;ve heard they are crapy but what the hey. Could someone post screen shots or something of them going off?<br/>
You can contact me on karana, e-mail or icq 549235.<br/>
<br/>
About the fishingpole and bait, is it true the pole never breaks and the bait never goes away?</div>
