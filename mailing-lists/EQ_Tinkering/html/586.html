<div id="ygrps-yiv-505890589">Well, I took my rogue to visit the gnome city to see things for myself... <br/>
Its actually a rather large city in there, well populated with gnome <br/>
miners, curators, and loads of clockworks... Unfortunately, there was only <br/>
one named gnome that I saw there, he was the one selling the bag of <br/>
tinkerers, broken frost modules, small power modules, etc...<br/>
<br/>
I could get no response from my hails... I asked about fishing poles, <br/>
journals, Gimblestan, the works... nada.<br/>
<br/>
I also got lost and died there... fully decked out in my gear.<br/>
<br/>
I went back to retrieve my corpse (which all i had was the loc of) and died <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
I then went back again and AMAZINGLY both my corpses were sitting at the <br/>
entrance... Praise Brell Serelis!  I thought I had lost my stuff... I <br/>
shuddered at the thought of losing my bloodclaw stiletto, shaped oaken <br/>
recurve bow, grotesque mask, and golden black pearl necklace.  I just love <br/>
bugs (makes up for all the bugs that got me killed).<br/>

&gt;You only need a group of 2 really.  One is a bit crazy.  You just stay at the<br/>
&gt;zone and pull things there and fight.  It is best to fight down in the <br/>
&gt;room near<br/>
&gt;the sol b zone.  It is nicely spaced out and it is safe to zone into sol b.<br/>
&gt;Atleast for a short while.  Have a tank with you, and a healer is always nice.<br/>
&gt;With those 3 in a party you should be fine, but even a full party is cool<br/>
&gt;there.  you can pull MoBs according to your party.  You get plenty of FS as<br/>
&gt;loot, and good exp. </span></blockquote></div>
