<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153845092">I just read from the Brewers list that Malt doesn&#39;t behave like other<br/>
alchohols. You can&#39;t right click on it to drink it. They think that it<br/>
behaves more like water and can possibly be used in place of water. Could<br/>
this be the elusive firewater. Someone try it and let me know please.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
