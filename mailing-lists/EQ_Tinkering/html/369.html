<b>Subject:</b> Other avenues for fishing pole <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-918542779">I have another theory.  The group making spyglasses on the Xegony server is <br/>
not actually making them.  I hypothesis, based upon Luke&#39;s ownership of a <br/>
fishing pole, that the collapsible fishing pole may be a drop from <br/>
Meldrath.  Has anyone killed and looted him?  His guards are around Level <br/>
35 or so, but Meldrath is around 26.  Perhaps a method to kill him would be <br/>
to get a druid or shaman with SOW to cast at the guards, pull them away out <br/>
of the cave and let a warrior and wizard finish Meldrath off.  Perhaps its <br/>
a common drop, maybe a rare drop.  Just another theory.</div>
