<b>Subject:</b> Trim the reply lengths a little please <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-804303053">Sorry to request, but could you folks trim up the reply lengths a tad? Some<br/>
folks are posting to the list and it&#39;s not appending a symbol infront of<br/>
reply sections... so it&#39;s hard to tell what&#39;s new and what&#39;s old without a<br/>
LOT of re-reading (becuase the last digest message I got was WAY longer than<br/>
it would have been with some selective reply trimming).<br/>
<br/>
This would help tons, thanks all. If ya don&#39;t wanna, don&#39;t worry. Just a<br/>
request. =)<br/>
