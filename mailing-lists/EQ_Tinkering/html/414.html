<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533975432">I was trying to complete a quest in Ogguk the other day and was exploring<br/>
the different parts of the city (ya, I know their arn&#39;t many) and checking<br/>
out the local merchants.  Deep inside Ogguk their is an NPC called chief<br/>
dooga (he&#39;s the one you get the HEHE meat off for a grobb quest) One of<br/>
things he was selling was wooden shards, sort of sounds like a tinkering<br/>
item... Any thoughts?  <br/>
