<div id="ygrps-yiv-492705320">I did kill her once.  All she dropped was a micro servo.  Of possible<br/>
note is that at times she just starts walking out into nowhere, towards<br/>
the valley in front of the ledge where Feddi Dooger spawns, Ive never<br/>
followed her though. (This info is from p4, as I havent been bold enough<br/>
to go around killing gnomes with my character in retail ;)<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t now what he drops but there is another lower level gnome npc that<br/>
&gt; stands near the path in front of the windmills. You get a faction hit for<br/>
&gt; killing her against gnomes and she cons blue to me at 9. Anyone kill her<br/>
&gt; recently? And if so what loot does that one have. </span></blockquote></div>
