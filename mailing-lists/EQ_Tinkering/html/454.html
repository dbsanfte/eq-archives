&gt; Thought #1:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Before taking an extended break from Everquest to pursue a job, I spent<br/>
&gt; nearly 150 pp making flameless lanterns and my skill remained &quot;Below<br/>
&gt; Average&quot;.  I was told by a GM that tinkering is one of the hardest skills to<br/>
&gt; train, so perhaps I am either unlucky, or the skill is nearly impossible to<br/>
&gt; train up now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;Assumption&gt; tinkering is broken. It doesn&#39;t matter what a GM tells you.  They<br/>
lie all the time.  I have even asked them on things I have known to be true just<br/>
to see if they would lie.  If any of you are Necromacers you know about the DoT<br/>
bug, where the corpse vanishes when the monster dies, and no one gets EXP.  Well<br/>
I was assured numerous time by Bargash (A real GM on Karana and not even a<br/>
guide) that this was supposed to be part of the game.  Of course, a few patches<br/>
latter Verant put in a &quot;fix&quot; for this &quot;part of the game&quot; which has helped but<br/>
the problem still exists.  This is my only instance of an actual GM lying to me,<br/>
but there are many other instances where guides will give answers to questions<br/>
they know nothing about.  So I would just disreguard the answer.  Because if<br/>
tinker could go up, then someone on this list would have had his/her skill go up<br/>
by now.  So if you have had your tinkering skill go up, please say something so<br/>
we know it is possible.<br/>

&gt; If the collapsible fishing pole was in a shop, it would have been found long<br/>
&gt; ago.  Of course, if it was only added in recently, then it may have yet to<br/>
&gt; be found.  In any case, it still doesn&#39;t solve the problem of not having the<br/>
&gt; recipe to make them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;Assumption&gt; Really only gnomes would be looking for this item. If it was in<br/>
grobb or oggok (don&#39;t ask me why, but they put some necromacers spells there)<br/>
then it is very unlikely that we would have found it.  If it was in neriak then<br/>
really only Necromacers could have found it.  This would mean that our<br/>
enchanters would have to check these cities.  There are also vendors all over.<br/>
A gnome, on this list, would have to hit one of these vendors and then scroll<br/>
down enough to see the pole if it was there.  It definitely could be out there.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Thought #3:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The collapsible fishing pole recipe should be fairly cheap to make.  I<br/>
&gt; really doubt that Verant made it difficult, considering it is a component<br/>
&gt; for another item.  So, this should limit the parts to those costing 1 pp or<br/>
&gt; less, with the total cost not exceeding 5 pp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;assumption&gt; Tinkering is broken, and the pole cannot be made at this time.<br/>
This is probably due to some poor coding or oversite (such as the DoT bug, which<br/>
effects every class with DoT or the Barbarian Shield).  Verant has put out a<br/>
good game, but made some large errors in coding that apparently cannot be fixed<br/>
until large areas of code can be patched (my guess would be this would not occur<br/>
until the expansion).<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Thought #4:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whoever assumed that the spyglasses were being sold for 50% over cost is<br/>
&gt; assuming way too much.  If you are the only producer of an item, you can<br/>
&gt; demand a much higher profit return on that item.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;Fact&gt; Spyglass are found as a rare drop off of some monsters.  They are a very<br/>
rare drop (like the box of abu-kar for which I kill about 300-400 monsters of<br/>
the appropriate type before one drops).  I have seen them for auction, and I<br/>
have seen people auctioning for them.  Every single person has given me the same<br/>
response to my inquiries, that they are looted.  If the person who was selling<br/>
it led you to believe he tinkered the item, he was most likely lying, and hoping<br/>
to get more to sell and keep the price up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Thought #5:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is no such thing as a &quot;secret&quot; on Everquest.  There are too many<br/>
&gt; people playing the game, making any new discovery part of the common<br/>
&gt; knowledge base within a few weeks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;Fact&gt; This is pretty true for the most part, but the glowing stein was a part<br/>
of the game from beta on, and it wasn&#39;t until 2 or 3 weeks ago that this became<br/>
common knowledge.  Verant also reports that less than 50% of the total different<br/>
items in the game have been found.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Thought #6:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seeing &quot;broken&quot; quests, items, and spells in the past, I wouldn&#39;t put it<br/>
&gt; past Verant that the collapsible fishing pole recipe isn&#39;t really in the<br/>
&gt; game.  I am merely speculating, but I find it rather hard to believe that<br/>
&gt; after months of uptime, not one gnome has found the recipe to such a trivial<br/>
&gt; item as the collapsible fishing pole.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;assumption&gt; I totally agree as stated above.<br/>
