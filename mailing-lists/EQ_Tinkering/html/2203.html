  have to agree,&nbsp; on my ranger, I can see exactly how this could give me an 
  unfair advantage, not as much as a warrior or wizzie, but still an 
  advantage.&nbsp; However, I have always wished my ranger could have a pet wolf 
  to follow me around in newbie zones, this used to be possible with the 
  Mistwalker, but they nerfed that, so now I pretty much have no hope.&nbsp; I 
  wish, they would make a tinkerable pet, or at least some way to summon a pet, 
  but just have a simple level 1 (20hp) pet that I could drag around a zone for 
  fun :P.&nbsp; It&#39;s a money sink, and useless in battle, so hey they should be 
  happy to.</span></font></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
