<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359051546"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I tried it after they put in the tailoring patch for cloaks. Wrong<br/>
&gt; cloak. The tailoring cloak comes out as a patchwork and won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; combine. They could have changed something since though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Combine with what though.. The recipe is not too specific as to how many metal<br/>
rods to use, and also is bit ambigous as to wether the belt is required element,<br/>
or just a bit of flavor - I&#39;d be more inclined towards the latte,r as it doesnt<br/>
say what sort of belt it was... That&#39;s why I suggested the new failed attempt<br/>
list..<br/>
<br/>
Also, on a completely unrelated note.. The gnomish metal gauntlets and the silk<br/>
lined steel cap that are sold at the vendor at the windmills - has anyone tried<br/>
putting them on and seeing what they looked like? I wouldn&#39;t mind buying and<br/>
wearing that cap if it looked like steel, though the icon makes me think it&#39;ll<br/>
end up as leather:)</div>
