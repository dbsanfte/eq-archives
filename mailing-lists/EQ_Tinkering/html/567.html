<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293048937">Gearheart is part of a warrior quest.<br/>
<br/>
The gnome in the emporium is part of a known quest that starts in qeynos I<br/>
think, and involved making a part for a ship.  HOWEVER!  The gnome sells a<br/>
component called a metal disk.  Why?  This sounds like a tinkering item but<br/>
why would this islolated gnome sell this?  Is it a hint of some sort?  I<br/>
questioned the gnome at length and could get no information from him.<br/>
<br/>
The minotaur in the zoo of akanon, I killed this minotaur and lost faction<br/>
with the king of akanon, someone went through the trouble of giving this<br/>
one particular minotaur good faction with gnomes, why?  Was it a technical<br/>
reason, to keep him from attacking newbie gnomes or is it related to the<br/>
story in the tinkering book about Gimblestan bringing back a minotaur to<br/>
the zoo?<br/>
<br/>
A third book is a possibility, its also possible that someone just happened<br/>
to have some cork and a spriket left over and thought what the hell... I&#39;ll<br/>
trash two items in one click and be done with it.  But instead they found<br/>
something new to make.  It is amazing, however, that the thousands and<br/>
thousands of people out there who search for quests, search for new things<br/>
haven&#39;t stumbled upon this third book though.  Considering how obscure some<br/>
quests and some items are, this third book must be REALLY obscure.  But it<br/>
could be out there!<br/>
<br/>
Solusek gnomes seems like a good place to try to learn about tinkering and<br/>
I intend to go there at level 24.  Being an enchanter, I&#39;m told that<br/>
monsters won&#39;t bother me if I&#39;m in elemental illusion, so maybe I can check<br/>
the place out and get lucky, who knows.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t fished with animated bait yet, but I think its likely that it is<br/>
a component in a recipie, maybe for the collapsable pole.  Either that or<br/>
it may be a quest item or maybe it has some better fishing abilities.  No<br/>
tests have really been done to see that I know of.<br/>
<br/>
And the collapsable pole has one very good use, if you do fish a lot, the<br/>
pole never breaks, it only weighs .1 lbs, and can be stored in small<br/>
containers.  Those are some fairly nice benifits to it.<br/>
