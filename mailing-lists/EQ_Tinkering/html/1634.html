<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242644130">The message said that I felt like I was dealing with mentally deficient<br/>
children.  Thus I was not directly calling anybody any names, merely drawing<br/>
an analogy to some of the behavior that is currently going on.  In fact, I<br/>
deliberately avoided using any names just so that nobody could accuse me of<br/>
attacking any specific person.  However, it seems that the post failed in<br/>
it&#39;s intended purpose, which was TO GET YOU ALL TO STOP SPAMMING ME WITH<br/>
YOUR PERSONAL VENDETTAS.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I stopped looking at names after the first flurry of insults<br/>
and just deleted any mail with &quot;Skill cap&quot; in it.  I have no idea, nor do I<br/>
really care, who started what and who&#39;s right or wrong at this point.  I&#39;d<br/>
be happy if we just started acting like adults again.<br/>

BTW, calling someone a mentally deficient child is not an insult??<br/>
<br/>
At my age, beeing called a child is a bit insulting :)<br/>
