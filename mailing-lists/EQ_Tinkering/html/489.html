<div id="ygrps-yiv-23521153">Yes they are for cookies,  There are cutters for Gnome, Animal, Troll and Barbarian shaped cookies.  The Gnome ones are by far the best :)  Im think the cutters are a smith made item but Since the friend I had make them for me was both a smith and a potter im not sure.  <br/>

&gt;&gt;     While doing pottery in Kelethin, I got aware of the merchant selling<br/>
&gt;&gt;pottery sketches also sold something called &quot;Gnome templates&quot;, &quot;Barbarian<br/>
&gt;&gt;     templates&quot; and a couple more I think. What is this? Anyone?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Uhm, I think those templates make those items you need to make those <br/>
&gt;adorable cookies, or something.  It is a bakery thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     In The Oasis of Marr I saw the gypsies were selling &quot;A ball of clay&quot;. <br/>
&gt;&gt;Is<br/>
&gt;&gt;this for pottery? (It could be that my memory betrays me, and that those<br/>
&gt;&gt;     clayballs were sold in &quot;The Emporium&quot; in FP, not sure).<br/>
&gt;&gt;     Anyway, if you have the answer, or facts on any of these subjects, <br/>
&gt;&gt;please<br/>
&gt;&gt;reply here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ball of clay?  No idea, but I would imagine its just more pottery stuff.<br/>
