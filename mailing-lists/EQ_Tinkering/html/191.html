<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lets find Bidl Frugin <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-84471205">Hmm, good idea.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few thoughts on this as well.  Bidl Frugin may indeed be located in<br/>
the Steamfont Mino&#39;s cave.  I have a feeling that the guards may whack him as<br/>
soon as he spawns, much like Bandits will kill Giant Spiders and Bears in the<br/>
Karanas.  Not sure about this, but its a thought.  Secondly, is the lens quest<br/>
class specific?  What generic gnome quests exist out there?  Brewing is<br/>
another trade skill that is very quest related, so I think that this is a good<br/>
avenue to pursue.<br/>
<br/>
