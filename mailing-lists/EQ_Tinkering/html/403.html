<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854842201">One of the gnomes at the windmills has Charlotte, his<br/>
pet clockwork spider.  I am a wizard of the 25th<br/>
level, so I can warp everywhere there needs to be<br/>
questions asked.  I will ask him about the engineers<br/>
tonight.<br/>
<br/>
I will also initiate the quest and see what I can<br/>
find.<br/>

&gt; Pulled this from Allakhazams<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Bridge: In Queynos there is a guy named Hansl<br/>
&gt; Bigroon.  If you talk to him<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; will talk about making a bridge to Odus.  He needs a<br/>
&gt; list of engineers<br/>
&gt; delivered to Antonius<br/>
&gt; Bayles&#39; messenger.  He refused to give me the list<br/>
&gt; to someone who conned<br/>
&gt; indifferent, so I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know if a friendlier face will get it.  I have<br/>
&gt; been told that if you<br/>
&gt; keep asking him about<br/>
&gt; the engineers (the text is not bracketed) he will<br/>
&gt; drop the note, which lists<br/>
&gt; the names of the<br/>
&gt; three engineers.  The human engineer is located in<br/>
&gt; the arcane science building<br/>
&gt; in Freeport,<br/>
&gt; but I don&#39;t know what you need to do to get him to<br/>
&gt; respond (giving him the<br/>
&gt; note doesn&#39;t work).<br/>
&gt; But if you talk to Rucio Divella in the office of<br/>
&gt; the people he says that<br/>
&gt; Hansl Bigroon is the<br/>
&gt; office manager.  If asked who are the other<br/>
&gt; engineers he says he saw them<br/>
&gt; once, one human,<br/>
&gt; one dwarf and one gnome.  The gnome he said was<br/>
&gt; followed around by some sort<br/>
&gt; of automation<br/>
&gt; (perhaps the one in Steamfont?).  I am not sure<br/>
&gt; where to go from there, but it<br/>
&gt; sounds<br/>
&gt; intriguing.<br/>
