<b>Subject:</b> Re: Cap on tinkering? and a fifth book.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-236978100"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;ok i am a level 17 gnome necro with a 71 in the skill, with a cap that<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t possible. 16th level = 50 skill pts in tinkering+10 for actually<br/>
&gt;tinkering. 17th 60+5 more = 65pts. I am a 71 6pts above max i think<br/>
&gt;the cap is gone or it never was either way give thanks rejoice and sing<br/>
&gt;to the power of the gnome:) Could there possibly be a 5th book? I have<br/>
&gt;read no where about the infravison goggles with may/may not exist, but<br/>
&gt;people seem to think they do and that we can make um. I am going exploring<br/>
&gt;after 20 to find any and all gnomes in this god for saken land and see<br/>
&gt;what they say, even with bad faction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for the reply btw on the red 5 stuff just curious if that was<br/>
&gt;what we needed and (thanks verant) it wasn&#39;t<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I verified a couple months ago that the level cap did indeed exist.  You may <br/>
wonder how I managed to prove something like that, but what I did was level, <br/>
run to the windmills, and begin tinkering flameless lanterns.  I got the <br/>
first 5 points within 40 tries or so.  I then spent 7 more hours of real <br/>
time attempting lanterns, with no learns.  I would estimate that I made <br/>
almost 500 attempts at lanterns.  I cannot verify if the cap still exists, <br/>
mainly because the cheapest thing I can learn with at the moment is the aqua <br/>
lung, and at almost 250pp a shot, learns come rather slow.</div>
