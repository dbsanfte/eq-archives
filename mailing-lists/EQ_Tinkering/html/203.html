<div id="ygrps-yiv-240621347">Well, i&#39;ve heard from an &quot;assistant guide&quot; (sarcasm) that said tinkering <br/>
was fully functional and said to go exploring.<br/>
Not sure if I believe him, but him, he was very tight lipped.<br/>
<br/>
Are we sure that its not working or do we think that it is because we can&#39;t <br/>
find the plans for some items.<br/>
<br/>
As for the bug using cams, has anyone tried to combine them with an oak or <br/>
an darkwood staff?  regular cams don&#39;t work<br/>
for hickory, elm, or ashwoods.  I haven&#39;t tried it yet on an oak or a <br/>
darkwood cause I am relatively poor.<br/>

&gt;I think you guys gotta realize that tinkering is just plain bugged and you <br/>
&gt;have to wait till they fix it.<br/>
