<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847542596">Selling the poles for 10pp seems fair until one takes in<br/>
consideration the problem with the skill level in our trade.  You only seem<br/>
to get 1 extra point max per lvl.  Granted making the poles is trivial from<br/>
the get go, but taking account that getting ones skill high is obscenely<br/>
difficult to do, 5pp failures which seem to happen more even with my wisdom<br/>
suit on and I think 20pp is a fair price for the following reasons.<br/>
<br/>
1.	Akanon is in the boonies.  Long walk from the only place to buy<br/>
components.  Travel expenses :-)<br/>
<br/>
2.	 This is a very very expensive trade with very little to show for it<br/>
- i.e. things to sell.  Last night people asked what else I could make.<br/>
When I told em the entire list of things tinkerable, the fishing pole was<br/>
the only thing they really wanted.<br/>
<br/>
3.	What&#39;s wrong with making a 10pp profit, taking into account the<br/>
failures?<br/>
<br/>
		So, I say 20pp is a decent price to sell to people we don&#39;t<br/>
know, 10pp to those we do.</div>
