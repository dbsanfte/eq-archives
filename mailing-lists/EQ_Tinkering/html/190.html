<b>Subject:</b> Lets find Bidl Frugin <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176005738">Ok, all you tinkerer&#39;s out there.  My suspicion is that further information <br/>
regarding tinkering may be quest related.  Seeing as the Library of <br/>
Mechanica houses the Eldritch Collective, a group of tinkerers, it may be <br/>
necessary to complete their quest for the telescope lens to recieve a new <br/>
quest for tinkering information, and maybe inductance into the Eldritch <br/>
Collective.<br/>
<br/>
The telescope lens quest requires one to gather four spare telescope lenses <br/>
from the observatories in Steamfont and Lesser Fay.  Two of them tell you <br/>
to come back in two weeks, one tells you it has been stolen by a dark elf <br/>
who may be in Freeport, and one tells you his brother, Bidl Frugin, has it, <br/>
but was captured and enslaved by the minos.<br/>
<br/>
First, the dark elf is in Freeport and readily easy to find near the docks, <br/>
I&#39;ll post the name once I remember it.  Second, I can&#39;t seem to get the <br/>
&#39;two-weekers&#39; to say any more so I&#39;ve skipped them for now.  Third, Bidl <br/>
Frugin is not in the Mino Caves in Steamfont, I went throughout the cave <br/>
and could not find him, saw two other slaves though, but they would not <br/>
speak to me.  Hummph.  I think it might be possible that he is at a <br/>
different Mino camp, but can&#39;t be sure.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest that we try to find the locations of all mino camps and search <br/>
them.  Its relatively safe to do so when invisible (as I&#39;ve searched the <br/>
Steamfont Mino mine with no problem from Meldrath and his guards).  If you <br/>
know the location of other mino camps, please post them as replies and I <br/>
will go check them out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
