<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371591172">yeh, there is probably no practical use for the numbers, but it&#39;s been a <br/>
while since my brain got any exercise...and being realistic is no fun :)<br/>
<br/>
realized that i forgot order is not important again...<br/>
current guess is 13^8/8!...~20231<br/>
or 13^4/4!=~1120 for 4 slots used...<br/>
<br/>
hmmm...that seems to be not quite right either...dunno...gonna have to go <br/>
find some old textbooks or something...<br/>

&gt;Guys, you aren&#39;t really being realistic here. You say that there is a<br/>
&gt;certain amout of items that we can use to make it, what are you saying?<br/>
&gt;Thats it&#39;s 13? Let&#39;s just say we decided that only 4 slots are used to make<br/>
&gt;it, even then, you can&#39;t make any acurate calculation of the amount of<br/>
&gt;combinations there are, I mean, I dout we will be using grease, sprockets,<br/>
&gt;gnomish bolts, and gears to be making the fishing pole. We probably have to<br/>
&gt;have some kind of rod or shaft too, and with your calulations, you are<br/>
&gt;inluding various of those useless combinations, that we can probably guess<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t make the pole. You are just going to have to face the fact that we<br/>
&gt;just have to keep trying, or find some alternate way of learning the <br/>
&gt;recipe,<br/>
&gt;so no amount of calculations are going to help us much unless you aply them<br/>
&gt;in a practical way, so you should stop wasting your time. That is all I <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;to say for now.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;oops...yer right...i was doin permutations...shoulda been divide instead <br/>
&gt;&gt;o&#39;<br/>
&gt;&gt;subtract...did it right on the calculator at least :)<br/>
&gt;&gt;but since we can repeat items, i seem to recall that we don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt;&gt;combinations or permutations...<br/>
&gt;&gt;any slot could have any of the 13 items, regardless of the other slots, so<br/>
&gt;&gt;we get the slightly less nice number of 13^8=815,730,721<br/>
&gt;&gt;or if we assume, as some have suggested, that it worked with the old 4 <br/>
&gt;&gt;slot<br/>
&gt;&gt;toolbox, 13^4=28561 possibilities<br/>
&gt;&gt;that sound right to those with more recent education or more convenient<br/>
&gt;&gt;reference materials?<br/>
