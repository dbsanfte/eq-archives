<div id="ygrps-yiv-383868200">As for poison, you do not need to right click the weapon on top of the <br/>
poison.  Simply right-clicking the poison applies it to the weapon in the <br/>
primary melee slot.  Right clicking a weapon in the secondary slot on top <br/>
of the poison still poisons the primary weapon slot.  Basically, Verant <br/>
threw in the step of right clicking the weapon to make people think they <br/>
wrote more code than they actually did :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;The only thing that works by right-clicking one item over another is rogue<br/>
&gt;poisoning, but I don&#39;t think you can really use the word &#39;works&#39; in<br/>
&gt;connection with that.  But this does tell us that that particular game<br/>
&gt;mechanic exists. </span></blockquote></div>
