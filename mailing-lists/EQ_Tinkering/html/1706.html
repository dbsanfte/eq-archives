<b>Subject:</b> Watchman Drexlin quest... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-74529089">Watchman Drexlin - this is a new quest, where one of the guys the<br/>
Gemchoppers hall who previously never said anything now directs you to find<br/>
Watchman Drexlin near Qeynos. According to Allakhazam&#39;s site, he spawns<br/>
near/on the stone bridge between north and south karana, on the north<br/>
Karana side and gives you a quest to kill Tiny Skeletons. I&#39;ve never been<br/>
able to find him, probably due ot the sheer number of powergaming weenies<br/>
that are KoS to gemchoppers from killing gnome guards, so he probably<br/>
doesnt last too long once he pops. Has anyone managed to complete this<br/>
quest yet? Is he always there unless someone kills him, or does he only<br/>
spawn at certain times of the day... I&#39;m hoping the later, cos it really<br/>
bugs me when people kill quest creatures - I still remember when I was<br/>
young and I could only do the report quests after a server reboot, becasue<br/>
the guard killers would often kill Joogl Doobraugh as well, and he has a<br/>
really long spawn time..</div>
