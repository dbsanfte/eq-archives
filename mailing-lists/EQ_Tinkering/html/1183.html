The person said he will tell how he got the book on dec 1st. There are<br/>
gnomes all over the world so maybe there is a quest from one of them to get<br/>
the books but who knows.<br/>

&gt;The reason we don&#39;t know where the book came from is because the book came from<br/>
&gt;no where.  It was hacked out of the code on the disk.  The person does not want<br/>
&gt;to banned that is why we don&#39;t know where it came from and the information is<br/>
&gt;anonymous.  But as most hackers, he/she apparently believes in freedom of<br/>
&gt;knowledge and shared it with us.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I totaly agree.The only reason o can see for them not telling where the booik<br/>
&gt;&gt; can be found is if there is something else whereever it is they found the<br/>
&gt;&gt; book that they dont want people to know about.<br/>
