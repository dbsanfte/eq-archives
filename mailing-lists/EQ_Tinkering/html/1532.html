<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948856276">It appears as though the cap has been removed.  My gnome is 27th and<br/>
according to the skill cap that we had figured out [(lvl-15)*5], my max<br/>
skill should be 60.  However on the weekend I was able to raise it to 65<br/>
with no problems at all.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I had a very good success rate.  I was able to raise my<br/>
skill 15 points after making 37 flameless lanterns and only failed 5 times<br/>
- I had worse results with blacksmithing!  My Int was 163 and my wis was<br/>
91  (thanks to a kind enchanter who cast Insight and Brilliance on me -<br/>
highly recommend getting these buffs before attempting to raise skill). <br/>
Has anyone else had similar results?  I&#39;m wondering if Verrant made the<br/>
skill a little easier after receiving so many complaints.<br/>

&gt; I have a lvl 18 gnome that hasn&#39;t even trained or attempted one point in<br/>
&gt; tinkering, yet.  I will set him tinkerin&#39; until I don&#39;t see any more<br/>

&gt; Its not that I don&#39;t believe you, Grundup the necro, I just want a<br/>

&gt; opinion. :)<br/>
