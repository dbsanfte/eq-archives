<div id="ygrps-yiv-414991616">thank ye kindly for insulting my intelligence.  paying 1k for a <br/>
Lung....congratulations on fooling the masses.  personnaly i think it is <br/>
taking advantage of ppl.  the return i get far outweighs my expenses, and i <br/>
am selling them faster than i can make em.  as for all gnomes who sell <br/>
scopes for 100 plat...HAHAHA. wow, you must find the stupidest ppl in the <br/>
world to pull that scam off.  personally, i am kind of disgusted that so <br/>
many ppl here are so greedy. i have never before been disgusted to be a <br/>
gnome...but there is a first time for everything i guess.<br/>

&gt;I dont know what the hell you outhers do but i think you need an marketing <br/>
&gt;department.  I would never ever selll a aqua lung for 400 pp, thats just <br/>
&gt;insane and plain stupid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;900-1000 pp for it is fair i think  and   with a note with it that if they <br/>
&gt;come back for an uppgrade to Rebreather for say 1000 more + componet cost. <br/>
&gt;That would be around 1600 pp i think, is that right ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I dont sell the fishing pole and those outher low skill items outher if <br/>
&gt;anyone order it, i get to many failures even  on trivial items to be worth <br/>
&gt;making them and selling them at a large scale. Take Bow cam�s for example, <br/>
&gt;i gor an order of 8 cam�s it took 12 tries to make 8, thats 4 failures and <br/>
&gt;i sold them for 25 pp each, it�s almost nno profit at all so     in the <br/>
&gt;futare i�m going to charge 30 pp for them i think if i even sell them.<br/>
