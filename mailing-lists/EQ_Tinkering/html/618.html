<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502247698">I have heard that in Beta you were able to make &quot;Mech Pets&quot;, from Vender<br/>
looking dudes, to clockworks.  I was told this was removed as it<br/>
&quot;Unbalanced&quot; the game as you could have a wizard with a pet, or any class<br/>
with a pet.<br/>

If you invis yourself, you can get to the gnome castle easily.  I have run<br/>
all over it, and hailed almost every gnome I have found there.  The one<br/>
vendor does have the bag of the tinkerers and I&#39;m wondering if we can tinker<br/>
it somehow.  He also carries broken force modules, broken frost modules,<br/>
functional frost modules, and a power module.  THIS intrigues me!  Could it<br/>
be that the force and power module might be needed to make the bag, or maybe<br/>
the collapsible fishing pole is powered?</div>
