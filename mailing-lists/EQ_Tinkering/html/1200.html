&gt;Well it seems all the peices to the puzzle are there now.<br/>
&gt;Its obvious they start everything on test then transfer it to live servers as <br/>
&gt;its working.I keep a guy on test, nongnome, forgive me, just to play and see <br/>
&gt;the new items etc..As far as the first guy who found the book and refuses to <br/>
&gt;share til dec 1st, I say your greedy and may the gods strike you down! lest i <br/>
&gt;get a hold of u 1st! I wil go to akanon tonight on test to verify all the <br/>
&gt;above info. Further, if the books are there expect to see a post from myself <br/>
&gt;with ALL the recipes in full, as this is the nature of gnomes being the most <br/>
&gt;prolific race in the game,to share with our brothers and sisters. <br/>
