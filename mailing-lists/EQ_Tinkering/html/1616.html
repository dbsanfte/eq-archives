<div id="ygrps-yiv-187863649"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   What is this ledendary Gnomish Blunderbuss you mention?  Was that the flying<br/>
 </span></blockquote>machine someone posted a pic<br/>
of?<br/>
<br/>
A while ago, the guy that did the EQ Emulator project (the one that got shut<br/>
down for legal reasons) posted a few pics - one of them showed a gun of some<br/>
sort in the range slot of a gnome, giving rise to the rumors of a gnomish gun of<br/>
some kind - after all, if the icon is there in the bmpwad, it might very well be<br/>
in the game..<br/>
<br/>
Another pic also showed the gnome flying around, though in reality the &quot;flying<br/>
machine&quot; was 2 kiln models used as weapons, making it look like they were<br/>
engines/wings of some sort. This is more likely to just be a hack job of moving<br/>
models around, rather than an actual item in the game - especially as Brad has<br/>
said there will be no flight in the game (&#39;twas in one of the Kunark forums)..</div>
