<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180215575">Ohh Please, don&#39;t start spreading this bs.  I know the guy personally, he&#39;s<br/>
not part of some secret EQ emu society , you guy&#39;s are so quick to believe<br/>
anything that someone says.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why he hasn&#39;t released the info on the book is becuase he takes<br/>
pride in being the only person who has found it.  He doesn&#39;t want this to<br/>
get ruined like every other damn secret in eq.  Yes, the book is IN GAME.<br/>
It&#39;s in steamfront, somewhere.  When I talked to him, he said that is was a<br/>
freak accident how he found it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I&#39;m not saying anyone is a cheater but... If you have all these people<br/>
&gt; looking for the book and it can&#39;t be found its most likely not in the game<br/>
yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you may of heard people have been working on an eq emu.<br/>
&gt; And as you may have known there is a command to summon items, each item<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; a number. some people where summoning items starting from 0001 or<br/>
soemthing<br/>
&gt; and working their way up. Baiscly I think that someone was summoning items<br/>
&gt; and ran across the book. And blam history is made.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It would explaine why the person hasn&#39;t said where the book its and/or how<br/>
&gt; to get it.<br/>
