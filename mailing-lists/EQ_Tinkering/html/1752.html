<div id="ygrps-yiv-615132997">Killing DE necros would not increase your faction with the merchants -<br/>
with the Eldritch yes but not the merchants.  The tinkering merchants use<br/>
the faction merchantsofak&#39;anon, which can only be raised by doing the<br/>
tedious Red V quest, the scrap metal quest and a few others.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
able to get my merchant faction up to amiable from indifferent but it<br/>
takes a LONG time to do so.<br/>
<br/>
As far as raising your Eldritch faction (although I hope I don&#39;t have that<br/>
mixed up with the Gemchoppers) - I believe you can do so by killing the<br/>
Kerrans.  However, it has been a while since I&#39;ve killed them and I&#39;m not<br/>
sure about the negative faction losses.  Can anyone else verify that this<br/>
is true and what the negative faction loss is?  <br/>

&gt; mage in the 3rd Windmill did not kill me at all b4, 3 patches ago I<br/>
&gt; tried<br/>
&gt; tinkering again, maken aqualungs and all of a sudden that SOB attacks<br/>
&gt; me. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; did any necro had that problem ? sure killen DE necros can raise my<br/>
&gt; faction<br/>
&gt; but I really don&#39;t want to kill my DE faction then kill Halflings to<br/>
&gt; rais<br/>
&gt; it again, this faction thing is really hard to raise if they con READY<br/>
&gt; TO<br/>
&gt; ATTACK, from that to Dubiously might take like 30 hours of killing. If<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; more... <br/>
