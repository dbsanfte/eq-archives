<b>Subject:</b> Glad to hear it&#39;s not broken - Now let&#39;s solve the problem <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-375612489">I for one am relieved to see that the recipe for spyglass is<br/>
not broken.  I am also really happy to get more information on the fishing<br/>
pole.  Thanks for telling us that you were given the fishing pole and had<br/>
not made it.  I, for one, am reluctant to start experimenting on an<br/>
expensive trade for fear that the correct recipe is broken &lt; for those that<br/>
bake remember the dough recipe? &gt;  It&#39;s rather interesting to see that most<br/>
of the trade skills are in a deadlock over certain components for high end<br/>
skills:<br/>
<br/>
		Alchemy- Doesn&#39;t seem to be widely implemented yet<br/>
		Poison - still too new in my opinion<br/>
		Tailoring - lack of resources: i.e. hq pelts<br/>
		Blacksmithing - always lack the skill for folded sheets of<br/>
metal and lack of weapon/plate molds<br/>
		Baking - smoker available for purchase but not use<br/>
		Brewing - no one can find many of the components &lt;morning<br/>
dew for one&gt; and no one knows how to make vodka<br/>
		Jewelry - extreme shortage of high end components<br/>
		Fletching - have been told that our cams can be used, but<br/>
not verified<br/>
		Pottery - many of the recipes are invalid (mixing bowl for<br/>
one) <br/>
<br/>
		And then comes ours - Tinkering - an extreme lack of<br/>
information.  Having dabbled in all the trade skill this one seems the most<br/>
frustrating.  In all of the other skill, one buys the book, reads it and<br/>
voila..on the road to success, until one gets high enough where the<br/>
mysteries of the game come in.  Which I can respect.  But from step one,<br/>
things like firewater are left out.  &lt;yes I do know how to make it by the<br/>
way&gt;  I can&#39;t seem to get anyone to talk about it, npc&#39;s that is. &lt;but that<br/>
could be due to my faction - I&#39;m a necro&gt;  So here is my idea.  If Lukas<br/>
would be willing &lt;since his web page has 10,000 hits&gt; There can&#39;t be that<br/>
many combinations to make the pole.  Have Lukas make up a spreadsheet of<br/>
every combination and people email him request 5 things to try and he give<br/>
it to him.  Trial and error, we will succeed.  Then, say, oh for a week keep<br/>
the recipe to ourselves before posting.  <br/>
<br/>
		So, what shall we sell this pole for anyway?  Double the<br/>
cost of components?  Just my 2 cents.</div>
