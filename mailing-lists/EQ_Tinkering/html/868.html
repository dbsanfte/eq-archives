<b>Subject:</b> Re: Searching in OOT, just sharks so far... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733138377"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: &quot;Aaron Bolch&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:aaronbolch@...">aaronbolch@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, I heard there&#39;s a sunken ship somewhere possibly within the OOT or<br/>
&gt;&gt;Erud&#39;s Crossing that is it&#39;s own zone. Perhaps one of these suggestions is<br/>
&gt;&gt;what we seek?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Again - I based all this off of various rumors I heard and pieced <br/>
&gt;&gt;together,<br/>
&gt;&gt;plus the clue &quot;search under the waves&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They can&#39;t possibly be their own zones.  Check your eq directory.. All the<br/>
&gt;zones are listed there, period.  If it ain&#39;t there, it ain&#39;t a zone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know. Again, as I said, it&#39;s all RUMOR and that I haven&#39;t verified <br/>
it either way. Did I stress that this was rumor? No? Ok. This is rumor.</div>
