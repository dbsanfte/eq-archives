&gt; would disintegrate FASTER than they do now if not being used by a<br/>
&gt; MASTER TINKERER. This would be due to an implied ability of the MT to<br/>
&gt; perform the required maintenance on the objects he creates. (No ACTUAL<br/>
&gt; maintenance would have to be performed mind you, just having the object<br/>
&gt; in one&#39;s inventory would be enough to extend the life of a Tinker)<br/>

large-scale changes to the game engine just to keep track of the current<br/>
decay states of the items involved.<br/>

I&#39;d prefer that Verant focus their attention on fixing things that are<br/>
currently broken rather than try to extend the game like this.<br/>
<br/>
For tinkering, I&#39;d like to see:<br/>
Stackable components<br/>
Cheaper components<br/>
Stackable fireworks (if I could only choose ONE THING, this would be it)<br/>
Tinkering vendors in Freeport and Qeynos<br/>
More USEFUL things to make<br/>
