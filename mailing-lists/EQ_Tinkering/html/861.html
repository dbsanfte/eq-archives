&gt;There are killer sharks out in those waters that con red to me at level 25, <br/>
&gt;and I hear they are VERY deadly to confront.<br/>

If you want to find them.  Go to the Island that the boat stops at on its<br/>
way from Qeynos to Erudin.  I think thats Kerra Island.  Anyway, run along<br/>
the coast to your right from the dock.  You will see what looks like poles<br/>
sticking out of the water.  Those are masts from a sunken ship.  There were<br/>
some green undead zombie sailors there.  Go directly out past the sunken<br/>
boat and you will find the killer sharks.<br/>
Warning.  I saw more than one when I was there invis last time.  And when<br/>
my invis poped right next to them, DOH, with my 165 swimming I didn&#39;t have<br/>
time to make it back to land before they got me.  Hitting for 70 to 90<br/>
damage per hit, with multiple attacks.<br/>
