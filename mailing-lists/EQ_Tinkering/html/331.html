<b>Subject:</b> Looking for recruits to try fishing pole combinations. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736005033">Hello Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Me and Luke (of the tinkering web page) have tried quite a few combinations to figure out the recipe for the collapsable fishing pole, I would like to recruit more folks that would be willing to try different combinations of tinkering components that we have not.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the beef, IF you have AT LEAST 50 plat that you are willing to spend, give me an email at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:fizzban@...">fizzban@...</a> and I will email you back the some odd 40 failures that we have had along with some other ideas on combinations that you can try.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know, I want to nail this bugger down.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
