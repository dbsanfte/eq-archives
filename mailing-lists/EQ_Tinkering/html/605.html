&gt; &gt;I would pay 6000pp for the bag if it does indeed reduce weight to zero.  But<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt;your haste to critique my post you failed to read it.  I want to know how<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt;person does indeed know that the bag reduces weight to zero and that it<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t just<br/>
&gt; &gt;a useless item.  Which is what I asked the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes this info on the bag is correct.  While I have not acquired even close to<br/>
the 6k plat required to buy the bag myself.  A few of my guild Brothers and<br/>
Sisters have managed to make enough plat to buy a bag or 2 in one case (traded<br/>
for the second).  The tinker bag does reduce weight of all items contained<br/>
there in to zero.  Its not useless just darn expensive.<br/>
Its also not a lore or no drop.  You can carry as many of the Tinker Bags as<br/>
you have room for.<br/>
