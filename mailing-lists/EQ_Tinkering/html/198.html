&gt;Frugin is not in the Mino Caves in Steamfont, I went throughout the cave<br/>
&gt;and could not find him, saw two other slaves though, but they would not<br/>
&gt;speak to me.  Hummph.  I think it might be possible that he is at a<br/>
&gt;different Mino camp, but can&#39;t be sure.<br/>

certain keywords trigger him to respond strangely.  Have you tried<br/>
everything you can with these two slaves?  Just and idea ;)</div>
