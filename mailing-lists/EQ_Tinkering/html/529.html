<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074599620">Stop sending useless messages like this.  if you are gone from the list I am<br/>
very glad.  Why do so many immature people keep sending these &quot;I know you and<br/>
you know so screw you&quot; messages.  I thought most of us got past that by the time<br/>
we were in kindergarten.  It seems that may people on this list did not have the<br/>
box marked &quot;Plays well with others&quot;  Because they are arrogant and selfish.<br/>
Every day brings another message like this drivel.  This guy knows nothing at<br/>
all, and is simply an immature jerk.<br/>

&gt; I do know something. I took all my knowledge, everything I know, used all<br/>
&gt; the common sense I have, and was able to talk my way into a clue from a<br/>
&gt; person that knows all about the fishing poles. At first I thought whoever<br/>
&gt; knew about it was selfish, that they had no right to keep this, but then<br/>
&gt; when I found out that this group of people worked hard for what they had<br/>
&gt; found, and are very secrective about it, don&#39;t deserve their secret to be<br/>
&gt; given away. I mean, THEY are the ones that found the secret, and yes it is a<br/>
&gt; secret, so why is it that they should just go off and tell everyone? This<br/>
&gt; game is all about exploration and finding things, and having fun. Thats what<br/>
&gt; they did, and they found something, so why shouldn&#39;t you have to do the same<br/>
&gt; thing that they did? Why should you just sit back and happily profit from<br/>
&gt; all thier work? This group, whom is a very secretive group, whom I shall not<br/>
&gt; name, worked hard to get what they know, and so I&#39;m not going to go giving<br/>
&gt; away the clue I was told, especially after the rude, immature, derogatory<br/>
&gt; comments that were made about me. I will tell you this though. Waste not a<br/>
&gt; plat more on trying combinations. You are not only wasting your money, but<br/>
&gt; you are wasting your time. Search the world, high and low, search the world<br/>
&gt; above and below...<br/>
&gt; This is all I will say. It&#39;s been nice being part of this list. I though you<br/>
&gt; were a bunch of decent people. Your coments have changed my mind. I will no<br/>
&gt; longer be a part of this list as you wish. It&#39;s been fun guys, and thanks<br/>
&gt; for all the fish.<br/>

&quot;To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I struck the pedestrian.&quot;</div>
