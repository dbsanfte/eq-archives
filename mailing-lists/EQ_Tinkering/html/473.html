<div id="ygrps-yiv-300598914">The fact that someone is selling spyglasses is completely irrelevent. It is <br/>
quite possible that the spyglass is a rare drop item, or loads on some <br/>
unknown mob.  I have not seen a shred of proof that anyone has ever tinkered <br/>
a collapsible fishing pole.  Try to get this Salvador guy or whatever his <br/>
name is to sell you a fishing pole.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, this is irrelevent too, because the fishing pole could be <br/>
loading on some unknown mob as well, or be part of a quest, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of numbers are we talking about with this guy selling spyglasses?  <br/>
Does he actually sell them?  I doubt he tells anyone how many he has, and it <br/>
is possible he only has one that he keeps trying to sell.</div>
