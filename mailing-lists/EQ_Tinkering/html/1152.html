When I was messing around with tailoring (many levels ago)<br/>
I was making only patchwork.  I seem to recall that when you<br/>
put patchwork on it was mysteriously called &quot;tattered.&quot;  Now<br/>
I don&#39;t seem to recall ever being able to make a cloak,<br/>
but then again, I haven&#39;t don&#39;t tailoring in months.<br/>

Has anyone had any luck finding the small tattered cloak for the thermal<br/>
cloak?</div>
