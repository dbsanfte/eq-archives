<b>Subject:</b> Some Tinkering Thoughts <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434960020">Does anyone else other than me think that the silk lined steel helm<br/>
is a tinkering component? It really isn&#39;t that good as armour, and<br/>
the silk lining makes me think that its for insulation....<br/>
<br/>
Also I was looking at that pic of the gnomish pistol/shotgun that was<br/>
posted before and noticed some other pics on that page that should be<br/>
of interest. Looks like a gnomish flying machine!<br/>

Doesn&#39;t look like he was successful but it shows that once upon a time<br/>
Verant DID work on the tinkering skill.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of these recipe&#39;s are not in the books at all - tinkering is<br/>
like inventing - sometimes you just do it with no guidance....<br/>
