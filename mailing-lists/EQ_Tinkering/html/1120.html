<br/>
<br/>
So we all know that &quot;according to the patch&quot; Kedge has been itemized and <br/>
underwater breathing apparatus&#39; have been introduced.  Many people are going <br/>
to be begging us for these items, and they will be willing to pay top <br/>
dollar.  HOPEFULLY Verant has included the recipe for the underwater <br/>
breathing aparatus somewhere that is somewhat easy to locate.  A possible <br/>
solution is kedge keep itself.  It makes sense...  No recipe until now...new <br/>
items there...maybe something drops it.  Just a thought, not spreading any <br/>
rumors just wanna get ideas floating.  I haven&#39;t been on since the patch as <br/>
I am currently at work, but if any of you have any ideas, post &#39;em.<br/>
