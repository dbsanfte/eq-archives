say it. So yes, he will use the excuse &quot;after doesn&#39;t mean next&quot;.<br/>

&gt; Whoa, now you are using semantics as an excuse?  If I&#39;m a cashier and I tell<br/>
&gt; you I&#39;ll help you after I help this other gentleman, do you really expect I<br/>
&gt; might not get to you for several weeks?  I think not.  The general<br/>
&gt; understanding when someone says something will be done after something else<br/>
&gt; is that there is a sequence involved.  2 comes after 1.  No one believes<br/>
&gt; that means 2 comes sometime after 1, but not necessarily next.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I started up a thread on the Gameplay boards, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Abashi actually answered it.  He is now saying that<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tinkering was never promised to us after poison, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; 100% contradiction of what Aradune stated earlier this<br/>
&gt; &gt; year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To be fair, he never did say what you attributed to him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You said that he said the tinkering would be done NEXT after poisoning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is incorrect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All he said was that it would be done after poisoning, not IMMEDIATELY after<br/>
&gt; poisoning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be patient.  They&#39;ll get to it.<br/>
