<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-263300038">I would like to know exactly what item i should start tinkering first <br/>
to raise my level.  I am currently a 16 Gnome Rogue, and have made <br/>
(albeit with a few failed attemps) fishing poles, fire water, 1 cam, <br/>
flameless lanterns, and 1 mechanical lockpick.  I have seen the <br/>
trivial message with lanterns, fishing poles, and fire water.  I know <br/>
my skill level is around 26-28, and i dont want to spend any more <br/>
money then i have to.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx<br/>

&lt;note&gt; Gnomish Bolts are shockingly expensive, and non-stackable<br/>
items suck.</div>
