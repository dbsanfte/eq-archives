Deepwater Harpoon/Deep-Six Cutlass.. Yeah I know its stupid for a Paladin<br/>
to kill a gnome, along with a dwarf and a human, but thats Verant for ya.<br/>
He has a really long spawn time from what I&#39;ve seen too, along the lines of<br/>
a day or more :( Though on the plus side, a friend of mine told me they<br/>
upped the resist rate on the gnome guards, so there&#39;s been less guard<br/>
killers around than normal :)</div>
