<div id="ygrps-yiv-727312800">The Gem Cutter, once combined with diamonds, black pearls, power module and<br/>
twine will create a Gnomish Ray Gun able to disintegrate most critters!<br/>
Well, I wish...  I have yet to talk to anyone who has even found diamond<br/>
dust.  A few gnomish friends are even thinking of giving up the tinkering<br/>
trade; seems like the wind was taken out of them when they heard 20th Mages<br/>
will be able to create water breathing stones (with charges) making the<br/>
aqualung/rebreather a moot trade item.  Sort of the last straw.   But so far<br/>
the purpose of the gem cutter is anyone&#39;s guess.  Maybe it&#39;s one of the<br/>
ingredients for the illusive Infrared Goggles or for an item not yet<br/>
implemented in game. <br/>
