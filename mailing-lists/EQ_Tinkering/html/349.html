Well compasses consist of water, static orb, skewer, cork, and pie tin.  Thats<br/>
five items.  If you make the assumption that the collapsible fishing pole was<br/>
possible from the get-go, It would have to consist of four or fewer pieces.  So<br/>
that lowers the combinations factorially :)<br/>

&gt; uhh...if i remember my math right,8 slots and 13 items(including empty)<br/>
&gt; should be 13! - 5!...ummm...51,891,840 combinations...or is that<br/>
&gt; permutations...and thats assuming we don&#39;t use anything less obvious like<br/>
&gt; skins or something...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; guess we won&#39;t be doing an exhaustive search anytime soon....<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hello everyone on this list.  I&#39;m new to the list, just signed up today.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyway this is a question for any mathematic wizards out there.  We have a<br/>
&gt; &gt;total of 8 slots in the toolbox and a total of 12 items to use.  Does<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone know how many combinations that we can come up with?  Remember that<br/>
&gt; &gt;this includes just having 1 item in the box or 2 or 3 etc. etc.  Well me<br/>
&gt; &gt;personally I would just like to know for curiousity sake.  And don&#39;t worry<br/>
&gt; &gt;you now have another helping hand in the search for the collapsable fishing<br/>
&gt; &gt;pole recipie. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Mike<br/>
&gt; &gt;P.S. If we do find it imagine how much it can sell for. :) $$$$$$$$<br/>
