<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440575794">I tried the thermal cloak, no go. Said these items don&#39;t combine. (Small<br/>
cloak was<br/>
what I used) But I could have just been wrong. Because I used a Belt as<br/>
well.<br/>
And a cloth rope, because I&#39;m a mage and can&#39;t were a belt. So, I&#39;ve got no<br/>
clue.<br/>

P.S. the Eldritch Collective is the keepers of Tinkering info I think.<br/>
But what that means? Good question. I think that you have to complete<br/>
quests for the Collective, the Spare Lens quest would be one to try,<br/>
but at level 19 I can&#39;t even get the quest. Anyone of a lower level want<br/>
to try this one? No one has finished it as far as I know.<br/>

&gt; first i would like to say ya&#39;ll are doin a great thing here. Here&#39;s what<br/>
&gt; i have heard, there are three other books(besides the two at mills)<br/>
&gt; where or when you get em is beyond me. I too have made the firewater,<br/>
&gt; and the lantern, and say one person auctioning off the cams for the<br/>
&gt; bows, so i know those have been made also. As has already been posted i<br/>
&gt; too heard that the infravision goggles instructions came from a quest.<br/>
&gt; Which one i don&#39;t know. Also i know as a fact that you can tinker<br/>
&gt; successfully at level 1, but cannot gain any skill level til level 16.<br/>
&gt; So all of you that are waiting to try it, go for it...it will work, i<br/>
&gt; decided to try it at level 11 with my gnome, and made fire water on<br/>
&gt; first try. Also i believe that you can make the thermal cloak from just<br/>
&gt; about any cloak...doesn&#39;t have to be tattered... I am wanting to try<br/>
&gt; similar things with lanterns ans stuff..(i.e. use small lantern and<br/>
&gt; such). If anyone has tried it with other items please let me know.<br/>
