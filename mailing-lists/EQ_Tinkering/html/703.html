<div id="ygrps-yiv-985001254">With a level 16 requirement on tinkering it could mean that it takes at<br/>
least that level to travel wherever or complete whatever quest.  Anyway,<br/>
some things you might want to look out for when looking:<br/>
<br/>
1) The butcher knife quest.  The knife is now lore/no drop so its very<br/>
likely that someone somewhere wants it.  Anyone that has the identify spell<br/>
and that they can get one themselves and cast on it?  I don&#39;t have the<br/>
spell much less a spellbook lol and since its no trade I&#39;m at a dead end...<br/>
 On a related note go to the magic hall in Ak&#39;anon and ask Tergon &#39;Who is<br/>
Meldrath?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
2) Non-rusted Blackbox.  Very rarely when killing clockworks in Steamfont<br/>
you get a &#39;Blackbox&#39; (Non-rusted) and the warrior guild leader won&#39;t take<br/>
it.  Again, maybe with the identify spell it might say who it belongs to.<br/>
<br/>
3) Gnome in Erudin.  Go to the jail cells by the bank and there&#39;s a gnome<br/>
in there doing time for something about smuggling Erud&#39;s tonic into Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
4) The Great Span.  This quest probably has nothing to do with tinkering<br/>
but sounds interesting and it looks like nobody has ever completed it.  In<br/>
one of the houses in S. Qeynos there&#39;s an NPC named Hansl Bigroon or<br/>
something like that.  On the floor in his house (across from the tax<br/>
collector) is a note that is supposed to be delivered to Antonius Bayle&#39;s<br/>
messanger.  Basically he&#39;s working with 3 other engineers (listed on the<br/>
note, one of them is Jogl) to create a giant bridge to Odus.  Nobody has<br/>
found out who gets the note, but each of the engineers drops a decapitated<br/>
head as loot when killed.  You take quite a bit of faction hits for<br/>
collecting them, I&#39;d imagine there must be a fairly good reward for this<br/>
quest...<br/>
