from The Simpsons:  During contract negotiations.<br/>
<br/>
Burns :  We don&#39;t have to be adversaries Homer, we both want a fair Union<br/>
contract...<br/>
Homer (To Brain) : Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me?<br/>
Burns:  ...and if you scratch my back,  I&#39;ll scratch yours!<br/>
Homer&#39;s Brain:  Wait a minute, is he coming onto me?<br/>
Burns:  I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what&#39;s the harm?<br/>
Homer&#39;s Brain: Oh my God! He is coming onto me!<br/>
Burns: After all, negotiations make strange bed-fellows, [Friendly Laugh]<br/>
