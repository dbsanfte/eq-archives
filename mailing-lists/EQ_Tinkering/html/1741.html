<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763678732">As a necro gnome its very tuff to get your faction up with the eldrich <br/>
collective it would take you a very long time.   I have tried I am a level 30 <br/>
necro on povar.   That stupid black box quest and the keycards take forever.  <br/>
 But those are the only 2 ways I have found to raise it.   Because the <br/>
eldrich collective themselves won&#39;t give you any quests as a necro.   And <br/>
there are no enemies you can kill that raise it.   Ever since the patch <br/>
anyway.<br/>
