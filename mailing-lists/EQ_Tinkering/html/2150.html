&gt; &gt; Hmm if it only certain gems try these:  Ruby, Sapphire, diamond, Star<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rose Quartz and any other faceted gems (they will have the sharp angles<br/>

<br/>
Let&#39;s take a step back and look at how other things work.  This may give us<br/>
a clue to the gemcutter.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, the only way to use items is to either put them in a<br/>
container and hit combine, to equip them, or to right-click on the item<br/>
while it&#39;s in a main inventory slot (like a drink or potion).<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that works by right-clicking one item over another is rogue<br/>
poisoning, but I don&#39;t think you can really use the word &#39;works&#39; in<br/>
connection with that.  But this does tell us that that particular game<br/>
mechanic exists.<br/>
<br/>
Have I missed anything?<br/>
<br/>
Putting it in a container may work, but we don&#39;t know which container to<br/>
use, much less the items to use with it, and since diamond dust isn&#39;t<br/>
exactly easy to get, people are understandably reluctant to experiment along<br/>
this line.<br/>
<br/>
Can the gemcutter be equipped?  Since it doesn&#39;t have class and race<br/>
designations on it, I don&#39;t think so, but this would be easy to test.<br/>
<br/>
You can also try right-clicking on it in a main inventory slot while not<br/>
holding anything.  Simple, non-destructive, easy to test.<br/>
<br/>
That leaves right-clicking stuff on it, or right clicking it on stuff.  <br/>
We just have to find out what kind of stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I wish I had one to play with myself...<br/>
