<div id="ygrps-yiv-446921217">Believe it , verant has this sick and twisted thing about making quests<br/>
ungettable at higher levels, and impossible for low levels to actually<br/>
solve, for instance this quest. one of the lens you need tog et from<br/>
Borxx, a level *30*+ Evil Eye. With verants normal sense of rewards well<br/>
get 20 exp pts, a faction adjustment and a tarnished dagger as reward,<br/>
note this is a step up from the usual rusty dagger they give us.<br/>
 another example (again gnome) get tergons spellbook, OK this spawns on<br/>
a level 18 or so mob... your reward for solving the quest? a level 4<br/>
mage spell.<br/>

&gt; I can&#39;t believe that if Bidl Frugin is in the Steamfont cave, that he would<br/>
&gt; be too deep.<br/>
&gt; This quest is supposed to be completed by level 12s or maybe up to<br/>
&gt; 16.  Those guards are level 40 or so, i hear, and Meldrath charms.  If he<br/>
&gt; spawned, it would be near where the other slaves are.  I did see a mob in<br/>
&gt; there though.  Can&#39;t remember his name, Londoor or something.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; him walking through Steamfont attacking rogue clocks.  He ignored me when i<br/>
&gt; hailed and walked straight into the mine.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hmm, good idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have a few thoughts on this as well.  Bidl Frugin may indeed be located in<br/>
&gt; &gt;the Steamfont Mino&#39;s cave.  I have a feeling that the guards may whack him as<br/>
&gt; &gt;soon as he spawns, much like Bandits will kill Giant Spiders and Bears in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Karanas.  Not sure about this, but its a thought.  Secondly, is the lens quest<br/>
&gt; &gt;class specific?  What generic gnome quests exist out there?  Brewing is<br/>
&gt; &gt;another trade skill that is very quest related, so I think that this is a good<br/>
&gt; &gt;avenue to pursue.<br/>
