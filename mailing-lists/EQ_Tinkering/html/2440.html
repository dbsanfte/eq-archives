<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568231612">You skill level is at least 50.  All gnomes start with that.  Go to <br/>
www.tinkering.org and check out the information there.  If money is an <br/>
issue, then don&#39;t even bother.  I&#39;ve dumped over 50,000pp into it so <br/>
far.  Only have skill of 158.  Regardless, make lanterns until <br/>
trivial.  That&#39;s the first item to make.<br/>
