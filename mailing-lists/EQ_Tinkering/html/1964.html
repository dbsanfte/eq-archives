<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684028180">what the definition means is 3D glasses. red on the left, blue (contrasts<br/>
red) on the right :)<br/>
<br/>
  of course, the infra/ultra vision goggles are close enough to that<br/>
principal. nice work. i never thought to look up the word.<br/>
<br/>
  this leaves us with a few possibilities. the one which i think may be most<br/>
possible is that this is groundwork, and the actual product made from this<br/>
is not as of yet in game. keep it up gnomes! i&#39;m soon to be 16th and i&#39;m<br/>
eager to help with the knowledge quest!<br/>

Gimbelstan&#39;s journal mentions that the Gemcutter is used to make pearl<br/>
anaglyphs.<br/>

2 : a stereoscopic motion or still picture in which the right component of a<br/>
composite image usually red in color is superposed on the left component in<br/>
a contrasting color to produce a three-dimensional effect when viewed<br/>
through correspondingly colored filters in the form of spectacles<br/>
