<b>Subject:</b> Diamond Dust? Bah... probably another wild goose chase. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-398030196">Ok folks,<br/>
<br/>
How many times have us gnomes been sent on wild goose chases because of the &#39;rumored&#39; location of a tinkering component?<br/>
<br/>
MY rule of thumb is generally I dont believe jack till someone shows it to me in a trade window =|.<br/>
<br/>
The rumor on Fulcrums web site (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/eqtinker/)">http://www.geocities.com/eqtinker/)</a> says that the gnome that actually successfully combined the components for the gem chopper produced a &quot;dummy product&quot; and not really a chopper.<br/>
<br/>
Whether this fella is lying thru his teeth or really did make a dummy item, either way it doesnt do us any good.<br/>
<br/>
Chances are when Verant finally gets its head out of its ass and fully implements the gem chopper, we will just be able to buy Diamond Dust from Bom Knotwood at the Wind Mills.<br/>
<br/>
My educated 2 cents.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
