<div id="ygrps-yiv-122224924">Well I got really frastarated I tell ya looken for that Diamond Dust and<br/>
Tattred Gnomish Cloak.<br/>
so I petitioned, and the GM told me it was a Verant GM too, he told me that<br/>
I should try Crushed Dauphire (not sure about spelling) instead of Diamond<br/>
Dust. Also about tattred Gnomish Cloak, he said it DOES exist in the game<br/>
but wont tell me if it is human made or not .</div>
