<br/>
First sorry missed the Gnomestock... had an early start next day and that was <br/>
2 am here in England sigh... will make the next even if I have to wander <br/>
round like an undead the next day ;-).<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t anything on the scyba gear yet EXCEPT that it is our path to RICHES <br/>
if it has a decent duration... maybe a tank level indicator.<br/>
<br/>
These are the reasons,,,, Fishbone earring is an 8 hour spawn and drops 1 in <br/>
4 spawns.... underwater breathing is needed for some quests Shaman for one <br/>
and not I think in just kedge keep but underwater in Perma. Have a 39 shaman <br/>
friend who traded for an earring, couldn&#39;t get it personally a MAJOR favtion <br/>
hit against Barbarians... and which race has most shamen? <br/>
<br/>
He has used the earring and is talking obscene amounts of trade for it. It <br/>
has really become a need to have item with new quests. I&#39;m talking thousands <br/>
here. Work it out... 8 hour spwan 1 in 4 drop thats 1 earring every 24 hours <br/>
IF you dont mind the BAD hit. The place was never camped whenever I passed it <br/>
before, near Surefell Glade, bet it is now. <br/>
<br/>
Time for me to get going on my tinkering skill have neglected it waiting for <br/>
it to work and avoid the frustrations but one of the reasons I chose gnomes <br/>
in the first place, makes us stand apart from the rest of the reaces.<br/>
