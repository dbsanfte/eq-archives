<div id="ygrps-yiv-180623644"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Did anyone ever learn what the Gemcutter is for?  How about the Catapult?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   No and yes.  No idea what the gemcutters are for yet or, at the least, if<br/>
anyone does know they haven&#39;t posted it anywhere.  Yes, I know what<br/>
catapults are for.  Unfortunately they don&#39;t do anything, they&#39;re just one<br/>
more item in a list of items that only exist as a &quot;less expensive&quot; way of<br/>
training up the skill. :(  Still, I&#39;ll tke having useless skill-up items<br/>
over going back to that long stretch between<br/>
gem-cutters-aqualungs-rebreathers.  <br/>
<br/>
   One would almost think gemcutters were skill-up items as well but they<br/>
have that one hard to get item meaning they aren&#39;t really that at all.<br/>
Verant people have alternatively waffled on statements as to whether or not<br/>
the gemcutter has an actual, functioning use but no one seems able to find.<br/>
I think the &quot;actual use&quot; they ascribe to it is as an item meant to drive<br/>
tinkers nuts trying to figure out what it &quot;does&quot; when it doesn&#39;t &quot;do&quot;<br/>
anything. :P<br/>
<br/>
   Its good to see the list getting a bit active again, even if there isn&#39;t<br/>
really much going on to be active about.  Maybe with more support rolling in<br/>
we can get more nice tinkered items in or, at the least, make some of the<br/>
old useless ones useful again if we put our voices behind the desire.<br/>
