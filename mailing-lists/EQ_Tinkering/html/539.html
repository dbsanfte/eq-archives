<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I apologize, I didn&#39;t mean to come off sounding so pompous, and arrogant. I<br/>
&gt;really was being pathetically immature, I guess it was just becuase I had<br/>
&gt;just gotten a clue, that really helps the discovery or the pole. You see it<br/>
&gt;would clear up alot, but I don&#39;t wish to tell because, I swore to the one<br/>
&gt;who told me the clue that I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone what it was that he said,<br/>
&gt;and I don&#39;t want to dishonor him, or myself. They hold this secret pretty<br/>
&gt;close to thier hearts, and take it pretty seriously. I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt;decieve this person. I can, when I want to, use words with the most<br/>
&gt;excellent of skill, like when I got a clue from the guy that part of this<br/>
&gt;unknown organization, and I can also be a jerk and come off sounding like <br/>
&gt;an<br/>
&gt;8 year old troll, as you have learned, well I&#39;m sorry, and I hope you can<br/>
&gt;understand why I feel that I must keep my knowledge a secret for now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have not been reading these messages have you?  Get your head out of <br/>
your ass.  I will state this YET AGAIN because certain blockheads like you <br/>
don&#39;t seem to understand.<br/>
<br/>
NOTHING on Everquest remains a secret, PERIOD.  With over 100,000 active <br/>
players, and a very finite world size, there is just no way anyone can keep <br/>
anything hidden from the rest of the playerbase for long periods of time.  A <br/>
year from now, your actions will seem futile and pointless.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
why you are trying to maintain a roleplaying tone to your responses, but <br/>
please refrain.  We aren&#39;t in the game, and &quot;keeping your word&quot; with someone <br/>
who seems to be amazingly more anal than you is laughable.  Verant has <br/>
really done a disservice to the tinkerers out there by either hiding key <br/>
information inappropriately or simply not implementing or implementing it <br/>
incorrectly.  All you do is support their inept creative team and obviously <br/>
don&#39;t support the people on this list.  You gain nothing by providing us <br/>
with your &quot;information&quot;, so please leave, as you have been asked several <br/>
times already.<br/>
<br/>
That means STOP RESPONDING.<br/>
<br/>
On a different note, I verified the &quot;animated bait&quot; recipe, it is very cheap <br/>
to make, and isn&#39;t trivial at skill 50.  But, I still haven&#39;t learned <br/>
tinkering at all.  At least this is cheaper, at only 4cp a pop.  But, like <br/>
other &quot;amazing&quot; tinker inventions, I have yet to find a reasonable use for <br/>
it that can&#39;t be duplicated by store-bought items or mob drops.<br/>
<br/>
flameless lantern = crappy lightstone<br/>
compass = store-bought compass and trivial to everyone<br/>
firewater = component for random junk and trivial to everyone<br/>
mechanized lockpicks = how many locks have you seen?<br/>
thermal cloak = who&#39;s gonna wear it?<br/>
animated bait = who fishes as a profession?<br/>
<br/>
cams = useful!<br/>
spyglass = useful?<br/>
collapsible fishing pole = the reason for this list<br/>
<br/>
I have missed some stuff, and obviously tinkered things exist out there that <br/>
we haven&#39;t seen yet (like the recently-introduced bait).<br/>
<br/>
I would be very upset if that &quot;third book&quot; resided in an area that made it <br/>
difficult, if not impossible, for tinkers below level 35 to attain.<br/>
