<div id="ygrps-yiv-537724125">I reached 135 a bit ago and have been making Rebreathers upon request.<br/>
Marginal success rate.  What I am curious about is has anyone noticed that<br/>
skill seemed to go up strangly.  A few days ago (last time I was making<br/>
rebreathers) I went from 138 to 140 in one shot...<br/>
<br/>
Is this just me or did I just miss the 139 skill improvment message?<br/>
