<div id="ygrps-yiv-511475371">I sell Rebreathers for 3k on Rathe Server sell about 5 a week. As for<br/>
Aqualungs I get 650 but no one on our server buys them much.<br/>
<br/>
Also my skill is at 130 and the Aqualung is NOT trivial at that skill lvl. <br/>
Fail rate on the Aqualungs is 30% and rebreathers is 50% to 60%.<br/>
<br/>
So at a skill of 130 I am makeing money doing this. Still would like to<br/>
find Diamond Dust though :(<br/>
