&gt;<br/>
&gt;Step 1: When you introduce something to the game, make it royally suck, in <br/>
&gt;the name of class balance, so no one will get pissed off about becoming <br/>
&gt;useless.<br/>
&gt;Step 2: Slowly make incremental improvements until the people who want the <br/>
&gt;change stop bitching a lot.<br/>
&gt;Step 3: Walk away for months to see if bitching continues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Case Study: Rogue Poison<br/>
&gt;Step 1a: Royally sucks - Must become master at pottery.  Must collect rare <br/>
&gt;drops from various low-level creatures (wasps, spiders, snakes).  Make very <br/>
&gt;difficult to apply poison to blade.  Only blade in primary slot can be <br/>
&gt;poisoned.  Randomize when it will proc (if it does).  If the rogue is <br/>
&gt;moving when procing, it is interrupted.  Make it highly resistable by the <br/>
&gt;mob.  Ungodly epensive.<br/>
&gt;Step 1b: No One Complains About Being Useless - Warriors do not bitch about <br/>
&gt;being outdamaged cause no one will ever see a poison actually work anyway...<br/>
&gt;Step 2: Make Incremental Improvements- Make it so poison will proc on first <br/>
&gt;stab and fix interruption bug.<br/>
&gt;Step 3: Walk away for months to see if bitching continues - (In progress)<br/>

Hehe, glad to see someone else other then us Whiners (its the new name<br/>
for rogues, dontcha know.;P) seeing this.  But your not quite right.<br/>
they didnot fix the interrupt bug.  being smash hard at the instant it<br/>
procs, or moving, and the poison is still wasted.  Its still 2-3 hrs<br/>
of killing green for 5ish bottles (during which we have to ignore the<br/>
youngins complaing that we are killing everything in sight  and that<br/>
theres noting to kill now), still costs 2+p per use, still heavily<br/>
resisted, and still has (start to finish (block of clay to successfull<br/>
poisoning)) 5 chances to fail and wipe out all the work done on it<br/>
before.  But it does proc the first attack, so thats sumthin.<br/>
