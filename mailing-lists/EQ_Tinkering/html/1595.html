<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054677735"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;ve had one of those packs for a few weeks now.  Got it for the Duster<br/>
&gt;quest.  It&#39;s a nice item, but it&#39;s NOT a weight-reducing pack.  It&#39;s just a<br/>
&gt;10-slot backpack, lore, nodrop.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is a weight-reducing pack.  You need to find something really damn heavy <br/>
to put in there, since the weight reduction is 10% or maybe 20%.  Nothing <br/>
special, but 10-slot packs are just nice to have.  I will stick a couple <br/>
blackboxes in there (weight 5 each) to verify it.  I didn&#39;t think to give <br/>
Hastan Bootstrutter the pack when I did the jboots quest, but I am pretty <br/>
sure it would be fruitless.</div>
