&gt;I&#39;m new to this list and if somone could please inform<br/>
&gt;me as too what items we can currently make and which<br/>
&gt;ones are still broken, I&#39;d greatly appreciate it.  As<br/>
&gt;of right now I believe we can make compasses, cams<br/>
&gt;(they work now right, even though they are just the<br/>
&gt;standard ones?), flameless lanterns, stalking probes<br/>
&gt;(is this one one still way to expensive to bother with<br/>
&gt;considering it&#39;s just an Eye of Zomm spell? - I have<br/>
&gt;to say I was greatly disappointed to learn that it was<br/>
&gt;only the spell - I was hoping to have my own pet<br/>
&gt;&quot;Charlotte&quot;), firewater and mechanical lockpicks. <br/>
&gt;What skill level should you be before making cams? <br/>
&gt;They sound like the best way to make a profit. <br/>

thermal cloak.  The collapsible fishing pole as well assuming it can be made.<br/>
<br/>
Cams are the normal ones now which do work.  Greater than 50% success on<br/>
these means you can sell them for a profit.<br/>
