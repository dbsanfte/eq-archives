&gt;Subject: Apology<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was the one who first found the book and said I would give out the info<br/>
&gt;Dec 1st.  I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know what came over me...  I actually was <br/>
&gt;going<br/>
&gt;to ship it to Gnomad Monday morning, but someone I had spoken to that night<br/>
&gt;beat me too it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, I apologize again... I found the light, but someone beat me to the<br/>
&gt;flashlight  ;)<br/>
