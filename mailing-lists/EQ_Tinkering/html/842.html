&gt; Good luck, btu he also has his little pet Charolette, right? Watch out for <br/>
&gt; her and other gnomes. Actually, I don&#39;t think you have to kill anyone like <br/>
&gt; that to get information, but if you want to, go ahead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Someone mentioned that a gm said there was tinkering info in the windmills.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Well I search it throughly.  I thought maybe there was something to the <br/>
&gt; &gt;fact<br/>
&gt; &gt;that you can stop the wheels inside from spinning by clicking on them.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;Also<br/>
&gt; &gt;I discovered you can stop the windmill&#39;s blades from spinning by getting<br/>
&gt; &gt;under them and clicking on them.  When you click on the wheels inside they<br/>
&gt; &gt;stop for a while then start spinning again, but when you click on the <br/>
&gt; &gt;blades<br/>
&gt; &gt;and make them stop, they stay stopped.  And the blades and the wheels spin<br/>
&gt; &gt;independently.  I haven&#39;t been able to figure out the purpose for making<br/>
&gt; &gt;them stop.  I also got someone cast levitate on me and I was able to <br/>
&gt; &gt;explore<br/>
&gt; &gt;the outsides of the windmill towers.  I even managed to get to the top of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the windmills by climbing around on the blades.  I didn&#39;t find anything.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d really like to know what the purpose is of being able to control the<br/>
&gt; &gt;windmills like that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Only thing I can think of is either the gm meant the tinkering books at the<br/>
&gt; &gt;merchant or there&#39;s something to do with the npcs there.  I&#39;m level 22 and<br/>
&gt; &gt;Jogle cons blue to me.  And he does walk out into the field alone from time<br/>
&gt; &gt;to time.  I&#39;d hate to do it, but it might be possible to kill him when he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;out there.  Anyone know what he drops if anything?<br/>
