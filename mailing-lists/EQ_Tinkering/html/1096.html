<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137249031">I&#39;m going to take the initiative and go ahead and try and set this up, and<br/>
if the person who coined the phrase, &quot;Gnomestock&quot; doesn&#39;t mind, thats what<br/>
I&#39;m going to call the event&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
--  Welcome to Gnomestock &#39;99  --<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this event is to celebrate the discovery of the Third Book<br/>
of Gimbleston.  This book contains many useful tinkering formulas, as well<br/>
as some more words of wisdom from Gimbleston himself.  While the location<br/>
of the book is still only known to a few, those few have been generous<br/>
enough to share its contents with all gnomes.  This act of sharing shows<br/>
true gnome spirit.  I and many others are forever indebted and grateful to<br/>
this person.<br/>
<br/>
Some events at Gnomestock &#39;99 will include:<br/>
<br/>
- Fishing with collapsable fishing poles and animated bait.<br/>
- A small fireworks display. (snicker)<br/>
- Free beer and booze for all.<br/>
- High Diving at the great wheel.<br/>
- And just some general, &#39;Gnomeing about&#39;.<br/>
