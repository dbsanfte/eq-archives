<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580115028"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; does this sound logical?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not if that bracelet cost you $75-80 to make.. Your analogy bears no resemblance<br/>
to the market, high level people arenn&#39;t going to balk at paying 1000pp, which<br/>
is exactly what these &quot;idiots&quot; as you call them have been saying, people are<br/>
buying them.<br/>
<br/>
Ruthless price undercutting leads to stagnation of the market - look at<br/>
blacksmithing, the first people to start selling banded armor make quite a good<br/>
profit, but eventually so many people get onto the market that you get abused by<br/>
your customers if you ask anything apart from slightly above cost price, as<br/>
though they&#39;re doing you a favor by buying your product, instead of the other<br/>
way around  - people like this I just tell &quot;Go buy chainmail from a vendor<br/>
then&quot;.  People complain about the Jewelley market&#39;s &quot;price fixing&quot;, but I<br/>
believe that it&#39;s helped the market more than hurt it, becasue it makes it<br/>
worthwhile for other people to invest in getting their jewellery skills up -<br/>
rather than spending hundreds of plat to get your skill up, and find that you<br/>
can only make items for your guild/friends becasue ruthless competition has made<br/>
it near unprofitable to sell to anyone else.<br/>
