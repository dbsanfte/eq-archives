<div id="ygrps-yiv-78952039">You know, I was thinking the same thing after someone said you can stop the<br/>
wheels from spinning by clicking on them.  Well I went there the other day<br/>
and spent about an hour clicking and stopping the wheels.  Tried to get them<br/>
all to stop at once.  Nothing happened.  I tried clicking on all the little<br/>
dodads in the windmills (the barrels and that odd out of place set of<br/>
drawers) Nothing happened.  Tried spewing off every possible term (meldrath,<br/>
gimblestein, etc) to the npcs in there.  Nothing happened.  I got so<br/>
frustrated that I created a newbie gnome named Tinkering and attacked the<br/>
tinkering merchant. hehe so now on Erollisi Marr there&#39;s &quot;Tinkering&#39;s<br/>
Corpse&quot; laying at the feet of the tinkering merchant.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] Talked to Viik<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello Friends<br/>
<br/>
I got booted from my server Veeshan 10 min ago so i joind the chat to try<br/>
and talk to an GM or something and i talked to one called Viik, and asked<br/>
why is the tinkering screwed and itï¿½s so damn hard to raise the skill and he<br/>
told me that is becouse the tinkering skill are so cool. Well me response<br/>
was how is it cool we cant make anything not even an collapsable fishing<br/>
pole who shouldnt be that hard to make or find the recipe for. He then told<br/>
me that  the recipe for the collapsable fishing pole are in the windmills<br/>
and that he hade done ALL the items last night on the test server. So i<br/>
asked if it was on the test server only, and he said no on ALL the servers.<br/>
I then asked what about gnomish fireworks can that be made to ? and he said<br/>
yes it can be done. </span></blockquote></div>
