<div id="ygrps-yiv-659994813"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hehe, glad to see someone else other then us Whiners (its the new name<br/>
&gt;for rogues, dontcha know.;P) seeing this.  But your not quite right.<br/>
&gt;they didnot fix the interrupt bug.  being smash hard at the instant it<br/>
&gt;procs, or moving, and the poison is still wasted.  Its still 2-3 hrs<br/>
&gt;of killing green for 5ish bottles (during which we have to ignore the<br/>
&gt;youngins complaing that we are killing everything in sight  and that<br/>
&gt;theres noting to kill now), still costs 2+p per use, still heavily<br/>
&gt;resisted, and still has (start to finish (block of clay to successfull<br/>
&gt;poisoning)) 5 chances to fail and wipe out all the work done on it<br/>
&gt;before.  But it does proc the first attack, so thats sumthin.<br/>
