&gt;kind of hack job...there is no way to be a level 100 and have all those<br/>
&gt;maxed out numbers and only weigh 2 pounds!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is a hack job... whoever made the emuQ are the only guys in the world to <br/>
ever make an everquest emulator. They can give any item different <br/>
attributes, as well as create new classes and levels.. (The guy shown is a <br/>
high elf shadownight at lvl 100)<br/>
They can also place enimies wherever they want.. etc<br/>

I picked Bertoxx as my server because it has two X&#39;s and X&#39;s are cool <br/>
looking =)</div>
