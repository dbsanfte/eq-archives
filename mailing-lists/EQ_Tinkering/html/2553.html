<b>Subject:</b> Hi, new to list and tinkering <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071771658"><p>Hi, I&#39;m Twilyte, Wizard of the 22nd season, Terris - Thule Server.&nbsp; I had an Erudite Wizard and changed over at level 17 for many obvious reasons about 48 hours a go.&nbsp; One of my major points in deciding to go Gnome (other than cuter and can&#39;t sharpen weapons on my forehead)&nbsp; was tinkering.&nbsp; However I know nothing about it.&nbsp; I have trained as many points into it as it would let me.&nbsp; But don&#39;t know where to start.&nbsp; Can anyone help me with some friendly advice on raising tinkering quickly and as cheaply as possible?&nbsp; I have a level 60 ranger as a main so funds are limited but obtainable.&nbsp; Any suggestions and such you can offer would be greatly appreciated.</p>
