&gt;Anyone know of an easy way to get the tattered cloak?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The &#39;tattered Gnomish cloak&#39; is actually a SMALL size patchwork cloak from<br/>
what I understand.  The problem is tailors can&#39;t make them as patterns<br/>
don&#39;t exist.  Patchwork pieces, including the cloak, are sometimes given as<br/>
a reward for completeing low level quests.<br/>
<br/>
Best example I can think of is the Crushbone Belt quest, where you turn in<br/>
Crushbone Belts to one of the NPCs in the Dwarven warrior&#39;s guild.  I&#39;ve<br/>
turned in about 30 belts and have not gotten a cloak, but I&#39;ve only turned<br/>
them in one at a time.  Perhaps giving him more than one at a time results<br/>
in a better item... the items I&#39;ve gotten so far are only sleeves, cap,<br/>
boots, gloves, shoulderpads.<br/>
<br/>
There is also the Aviak chick talon quest, in the Dwarf paladin guild.<br/>
Never tried this one, but it should give out patchwork rewards.<br/>
<br/>
In Kelethin (warriors?) guild there is a NPC who asks you to bring him a<br/>
ruined wolf pelt, bone chips, spiderling eye and a bat fur.  He gives out<br/>
patchwork as well, but more commonly cheap gems and rusty weapons.<br/>
<br/>
One quest I would NOT do however, is the pixie dust one in Kelethin.  I<br/>
actually got a cloak from this one but it is MED size :(  Won&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
The small size cloaks do exist, its just a very rare item.<br/>
