<b>Subject:</b> Diamond Dust and the Ogres/Gnome in Rathe <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-225066334">Do not give your diamond to the ogres in Lake Rathe.  They will not crush it.  I gave one to them, they said thanks and i had to kill him to get it back.<br/>
Also tried this with the &quot;gem-cutting&quot; Gnome in rathe mnts by the inn.  He just says &quot;hrmm, I guess i&#39;ll find some use for this&quot; (even after you talk to him about gem cutting) and obviously you can&#39;t kill him to get it back cuz he&#39;s a vendor.<br/>
Keep looking fellas and when ya do find it, share the wealth!<br/>
