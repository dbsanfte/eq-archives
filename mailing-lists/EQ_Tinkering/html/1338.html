<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150999715">It amazes me how many can actually read, your ignorance shines. You missing <br/>
the point, maybe next time you will actually read my note before babbling off <br/>
or just dont quote it if you dont understand it. My note was simply directed <br/>
to the guy who flames everyone for selling at a price he does not agree, no <br/>
one cares for your price calculation or &quot;logical selling price&quot; which is not <br/>
possible if you are actually a tinker. I do not want to argue on this <br/>
pointless issue, some loser who did not want to spend the time nor money to <br/>
invest in tinkering started, to flame everyone who did.  Sell at what you <br/>
will, no one really cares except the buyer. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;While there is a reasonable price for the items, that allows for<br/>
continuance of working on the skills, some ppl are gona charge less,<br/>
and some more...  If your a greedy SOB, then anyone selling for less<br/>
than you are is hurting your profit, as they steal bussiness and give<br/>
you a bad rep (?desearved?).  If you undercut all the time, you hurt<br/>
yourself long term as you slowly go broke.   You hurt the others that<br/>
just want to continue to practice the skill in the short term as they<br/>
cant sell. its all a balance...  if matterals cost X and you fail 50%<br/>
of the time on average, then logical selling price is 2X, most tack on<br/>
a profit so that they dont feel its wasted time, when they coulda been<br/>
sitten on their butts waiting for mob X with cool/sellable/tradable<br/>
item Y to pop....  The question is: if somebody walks up to you and<br/>
says &quot;heres all the parts, please combine those for me. if you fail,<br/>
no worrys.&quot; would you do it?  Or would you charge them for the 30sec<br/>
it takes to hit combine.  You didn&#39;t spend any cash on the item, and<br/>
if its not a triv item, then your gaining skill (possibly) for free.&quot;</div>
