<b>Subject:</b> gem cutter idea. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613526431">I am new to this mailing list as I am fairly new to fairly new to Tinkering<br/>
(skill 45).  I had this idea after reading the passage about the gemcutter<br/>
from the latest journal.  Feel free to point out any misinformation that I<br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
The book said the machine was designed by his friend a jeweler who wanted to<br/>
cut anaglyphs in gems, specifically pearls.  This leads me to believe that<br/>
the gemcutter is used by the jeweler, possible in much the same way as a<br/>
planing tool, or carving knife is used by a Fletcher to improve the stats on<br/>
their bows.  In the case of the Fletcher the tool is consumed if you get the<br/>
message about components not combining in these quantities, however, it is<br/>
not absorbed if you have the right component quantities and simply fail,<br/>
but, is consumed if you succeed.  What I&#39;m getting at, is that maybe the<br/>
gemcutter is used by a jeweler during production to improve the stats on<br/>
jewelry.  The definition of Anaglyph talks about the 3D image, but it also<br/>
says that an anaglyph (in so many words), is a decorative carving on some<br/>
piece of jewelry.  The book states that the machine can make fine cuts on<br/>
even the smallest gems using only a small bit of grease to reduce friction.<br/>
At first I assumed the grease was used in the crafting of the machine, which<br/>
is the case, but I then began to think, when engraving in RL, oil is often<br/>
used to lubricate the cutting bit to reduce friction so as to not &quot;burn&quot; the<br/>
bit, and/or the engraved object.  So maybe grease needs to be used when<br/>
using the gemcutter.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I am still too low lvl and too poor to try these ideas, but wanted<br/>
to present them to the tinkering community for appraisal.  Here is my idea<br/>
of what might work.<br/>
<br/>
A jeweler combines in his bag.<br/>
<br/>
1 pearl or black pearl (this might be used on other gems, but this seems the<br/>
best place to start considering it is stated in the journal)<br/>
+ all other components need to create any given jewelry piece. (might start<br/>
off with a ring, as that seems a good place for an anaglyph)<br/>
1 gemcutter<br/>
1 grease<br/>
<br/>
This is my base test idea, I have other thoughts for components, for example<br/>
runes, spells, etc. for a pattern for the anaglyph.  If anyone has any other<br/>
ideas, please post them, as I am interested in reading all thoughts on the<br/>
subject.  And if anyone who is rich enough and brave enough to try my idea,<br/>
please let me know.<br/>
