<div id="ygrps-yiv-250084488">Oh, and Gnomad, if you don&#39;t actually have the plans, let us know.  Your <br/>
posting suggests that you do have them, but are keeping them secret.  I <br/>
still have hope that your website &quot;is&quot; open....<br/>

&gt;I was asked by someone to make me a fishing pole yesterday.  He said he knew<br/>
&gt;two people who could but they were on another continent.  I said I would if he<br/>
&gt;told me the recipe =)   But he said they would not reveal it.  People know and<br/>
&gt;they are not sharing!@<br/>
