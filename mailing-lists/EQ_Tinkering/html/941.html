<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089909066">the guy on Cazic-Thule who has the book is going to post a screen pic of the<br/>
book on their web site www.shadowedsoul.com<br/>
it&#39;s not there yet, but keep checking back<br/>
I think it was available a while ago but isn&#39;t anymore because some of the<br/>
recipe&#39;s don&#39;t work and they took the book out, but he says it is<br/>
I don&#39;t know how recently he&#39;s tried to get it<br/>

&gt; What will it take to get it through to you guys? There is NO damn third<br/>
&gt; book, ANY formulas for items that have been figured out how to be made, if<br/>
&gt; any at all were figured out by trial and error. There is absolutely NO<br/>

&gt; thats all I can say, doing anything else about tinkering, like trying to<br/>
&gt; find a non-existant book, or trying to figure out a formula with next to<br/>
&gt; nothing odds is just a TOTAL 100% waste of time!<br/>
