Ok. Not to get everyone too excited, but I&#39;ve heard rumors of a third<br/>
tinkering book. Someone said there are clockworks and gnomes in <br/>
Solusek A and also that there is a tinkering book for sale in there.<br/>
But it was said that is costs 7000pp. I camped last night in the entrance<br/>
to Solusek A, so I&#39;ll try to check it out tomorrow and report back. I <br/>
won&#39;t be walking out with the 7000pp book, but I&#39;ll hopefully have<br/>
the title of it *grin*.<br/>
<br/>
Any confirmations of this? I did hear this directly from someone in game <br/>
inside Solusek A, so I wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;d be wrong. How&#39;s everyone&#39;s <br/>
tinkering skill going? Any master tinkers yet or is it too expensive?<br/>
<br/>
