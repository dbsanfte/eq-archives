&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I hit 16 I decided to try tinkering so I bought some gears and<br/>
&gt;sprockets to make lockpicks.  I dropped about 60 plat and got nothing in<br/>
&gt;return.  Anyway, I gave up on tinkering for a long time, but recently have<br/>
&gt;gotten back into it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At level 47 and with a 184 int, I have gotten increases from making the<br/>
&gt;lanterns about every 5 attempts.  It may be my imagination, but even a<br/>
&gt;little extra int seems to help, so if you can get an int buff before going<br/>
&gt;to work, do it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You didn&#39;t mention what level your tinkering is at..  I have a 165 int <br/>
currently, so there is not a lack of int involved for my attempts.<br/>
