<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489732529">Yes that is the observer quest and you have to kill Broxx (Not sure of <br/>
spelling) a 30th lvl Evil Eye at the bottom or Runnyeye to get the staff <br/>
(Been camping with friends trying to get for one), or to be exact the lens <br/>
to give for the staff.<br/>

I follow the note to Grub n Grob but get stuck there.<br/>
Two of the lens people say &quot;come back next week&quot;, the<br/>
third I tried leads me to Freeport.  At the store I<br/>
ask eveyrone about the dark elf rogue but no one<br/>
replies, and I can&#39;t find an underground enterance.  I<br/>
have heard of the name the woman is supposed to be,<br/>
HOWEVER, she cons red to me and when I approach her<br/>
about the lens she does nothing.  I believe it to be<br/>
an unfinished quest.  I heard it was supposed to be<br/>
part or near the Staff of the Observer (best staff in<br/>
game for casters) quest...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try the thermal cloak tonight as well, using<br/>
leather, cloth, and various other equipment.  I think<br/>
I decyphered it well enough to get it.<br/>

&gt; I tried the thermal cloak, no go. Said these items<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t combine. (Small<br/>
&gt; cloak was<br/>
&gt; what I used) But I could have just been wrong.<br/>
&gt; Because I used a Belt as<br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
&gt; And a cloth rope, because I&#39;m a mage and can&#39;t were<br/>
&gt; a belt. So, I&#39;ve got no<br/>
&gt; clue.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. the Eldritch Collective is the keepers of<br/>
&gt; Tinkering info I think.<br/>
&gt; But what that means? Good question. I think that you<br/>
&gt; have to complete<br/>
&gt; quests for the Collective, the Spare Lens quest<br/>
&gt; would be one to try,<br/>
&gt; but at level 19 I can&#39;t even get the quest. Anyone<br/>
&gt; of a lower level want<br/>
&gt; to try this one? No one has finished it as far as I<br/>
&gt; know.<br/>

&gt; &gt; first i would like to say ya&#39;ll are doin a great<br/>
&gt; thing here. Here&#39;s what<br/>
&gt; &gt; i have heard, there are three other books(besides<br/>
&gt; the two at mills)<br/>
&gt; &gt; where or when you get em is beyond me. I too have<br/>
&gt; made the firewater,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the lantern, and say one person auctioning off<br/>
&gt; the cams for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bows, so i know those have been made also. As has<br/>
&gt; already been posted i<br/>
&gt; &gt; too heard that the infravision goggles<br/>
&gt; instructions came from a quest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which one i don&#39;t know. Also i know as a fact that<br/>
&gt; you can tinker<br/>
&gt; &gt; successfully at level 1, but cannot gain any skill<br/>
&gt; level til level 16.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So all of you that are waiting to try it, go for<br/>
&gt; it...it will work, i<br/>
&gt; &gt; decided to try it at level 11 with my gnome, and<br/>
&gt; made fire water on<br/>
&gt; &gt; first try. Also i believe that you can make the<br/>
&gt; thermal cloak from just<br/>
&gt; &gt; about any cloak...doesn&#39;t have to be tattered... I<br/>
&gt; am wanting to try<br/>
&gt; &gt; similar things with lanterns ans stuff..(i.e. use<br/>
&gt; small lantern and<br/>
&gt; &gt; such). If anyone has tried it with other items<br/>
&gt; please let me know.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
