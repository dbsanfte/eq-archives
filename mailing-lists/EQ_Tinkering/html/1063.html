<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063018864">I don&#39;t know, But if there is a Gnome guild out there on Fennin Ro . I am <br/>
thinking of changing guilds to where I can develop and not worry about <br/>
prejeduces from the tall races. If i were to recieve an invite From a gnome <br/>
guild at this point I would gladly join them since my guild where i currently <br/>
reside has very little activity in cooperation except in the warrior <br/>
type...Sincerely a tired of soloing gnome..... Cloverleaf (23rd season <br/>
enchanter extrordinare)</div>
