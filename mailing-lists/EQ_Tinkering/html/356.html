<b>Subject:</b> Combinations for that fishing pole = 1,287 are possible <br/>
<br/><br/>

&quot;I knew that I kept this thing around for some reason.  *grin*<br/>
<br/>
They are unorderd (it doesn&#39;t matter which slot you place that rat ear at), so, they are combinations. Way to go Xillitil.<br/>
<br/>
Formula:  nCr = n!/[r!(n-r)!]<br/>
    n = items we have to play with (12 here - we think)<br/>
    r = the set (8 spots in this case)<br/>
<br/>
But an empty slot counts as an item too, so we need to count an additional one for our number of items.<br/>
        13C8    = 13!/[8!(13-8)!]<br/>
                    =    6,227,020,800 / [40,320(120)]<br/>
                    =    6,227,020,800 / [4,838,400]<br/>
                    =    1,287<br/>
<br/>
As you can tell, my professors were big fans of &#39;Show Your Work&#39;.  *grins*<br/>
<br/>
But, at least it isn&#39;t some way the heck out there number - thank goodness.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, other factors too, that will decrease our combinations.  We know that certain items are not useable.  ie.  We know it will take more than one metal rod (or any other given item).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently working on all listing all those darn combinations.  Eww...<br/>
<br/>
It shall be ours soon.<br/>

&gt; Hello everyone on this list.  I&#39;m new to the list, just signed up today.  Anyway this is a question for any mathematic wizards out there.  We have a total of 8 slots in the toolbox and a total of 12 items to use.  Does anyone know how many combinations that we can come up with?  Remember that this includes just having 1 item in the box or 2 or 3 etc. etc.  Well me personally I would just like to know for curiousity sake.  And don&#39;t worry you now have another helping hand in the search for the collapsable fishing pole recipie. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; P.S. If we do find it imagine how much it can sell for. :) $$$$$$$$<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; uhh...if i remember my math right,8 slots and 13 items(including empty)<br/>
&gt; should be 13! - 5!...ummm...51,891,840 combinations...or is that<br/>
&gt; permutations...and thats assuming we don&#39;t use anything less obvious like<br/>
&gt; skins or something...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; guess we won&#39;t be doing an exhaustive search anytime soon....<br/>
