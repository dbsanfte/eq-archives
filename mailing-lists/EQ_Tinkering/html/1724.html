&gt; OK don&#39;t get to excited but I have been asked by a fellow gnome to make<br/>
&gt; the gemcutter. He claims he can get the diamond dust for me, but won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; give up the npc that drops it. He claims that the npc is 50th level and <br/>
&gt; that the diamond dust is a rare drop item off it. I am thinking that this<br/>
&gt; could mean that the npc may be in the planes but that is merley speculation.<br/>
&gt; I wish he would give up the info but he is keeping it hidden from all for<br/>
&gt; another gnome. Well i hope this gives all you tinkerers hope:)<br/>

Tell him that if he gets you the dust, you&#39;ll make him the item.<br/>
<br/>
If he hems and haws about it, or can&#39;t produce it, then you&#39;ll have your<br/>
answer.<br/>
