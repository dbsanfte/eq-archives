<br/>
Anyone know what quest the Butcher Knife is for?  It was looted off the<br/>
corpse of the racekilling NPC Gnome...  The stats on the dagger are no<br/>
better than one you&#39;d fish up but it is a LORE ITEM so I&#39;m guessing its<br/>
part of one of those &#39;Bring proof you killed so-and-so for your reward&#39;<br/>
type deals.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as for looking for more tinkering books, has anyone checked the Mino<br/>
caves?  There are Gnomes that walk around killstealing minos, has anyone<br/>
ever tried right-clicking on them to attempt to buy?  Or trying to hail<br/>
them for a quest?  AFAIK, there are several Gnomes in the caves but I<br/>
haven&#39;t searched much, mainly because I&#39;m in the Karanas area :P  Anyone<br/>
that knows anything about the NPCs in the cave or want to check it out?<br/>

PS: Sort of working on improving the site a bit, not much new news to add<br/>
though.  BTW, trying to make bows using tinker-made cams is BUGGED.  Won&#39;t<br/>
work.  Period.  That&#39;s the latest word from GMs.</div>
