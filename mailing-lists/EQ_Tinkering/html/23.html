<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361382594">I made infravision goggles during beta... You need amber lenses and some other misc tinkering items... You used to be able to find these in Rivervale (the amber lens), i dont know if you still can... And the entire quest that tells you how to make them is either broken, or moved... So if anyone has an update on this then feel free to post it<br/>

I believe you can&#39;t Tinker at all until level 16. Books are cheap, 2gp or<br/>
something<br/>
Toolbox? can&#39;t remember 2-5pp or something.<br/>
<br/>
Infravision goggles? Well, I don&#39;t know that any of us have found the book to<br/>
make those yet. It&#39;s not in either book I have.<br/>

+AD4APg- WOOHOO,<br/>
+AD4APg-<br/>
+AD4APg- I&#39;m Really excited to here some people are successfully tinkering.  I&#39;ve just<br/>
+AD4APg- reached level 9 myself, and finished buying all the 3rd circle spells that I<br/>
+AD4APg- need.  Tinkering is now my next goal.  I have a few questions though. At what<br/>
+AD4APg- level will your tinkering skills improve.  I haven&#39;t been back to my homeland<br/>
+AD4APg- in a while and I was wondering how much the toolkit and the first book cost.<br/>

+AD4APg-  Ok, so after the solution for Firewater was given<br/>
+AD4APg-  to me, I tried Tinkering the stuff, simple. Worked<br/>
+AD4APg-  every time. Then I tried the only item that I could afford and tada, the<br/>
+AD4APg-  first(in the game I think) Flameless Lantern (gave it away) then two<br/>
+AD4APg-  failures. But all in all I made 3. They seem to be<br/>
+AD4APg-  at least as bright as Lightstone, possibly brighter, but being a Gnome, what<br/>
+AD4APg-  do I need it for? :) But it&#39;s been done. Tinkering works.<br/>
+AD4APg-  Going to put in my order for Pie Tins and start<br/>
+AD4APg-  making Compasses. And as soon as I find a tattered<br/>
+AD4APg-  cloak, it&#39;s Thermal Cloak time. Man I need more money.<br/>
