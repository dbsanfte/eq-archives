<br/>
&gt;In general I would agree with you but bear in mind this.  There are<br/>
&gt;probably<br/>
&gt;no more than a couple of dozen serious tinkerers.  Heck gnomes<br/>
&gt;themselves are<br/>
&gt;very rare.  I see very few as compared to elves or humans.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With such a small population, it IS possible for the secret to be held.<br/>
&gt;Even more so when all the other things you get from tinkering are useful<br/>
&gt;to practically no one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do agree that the entire tinkering population is quite small, but there <br/>
are literally thousands of players out there that search for new quests and <br/>
item info every day.  In the course of these events, they will eventually <br/>
find something to do with tinkering.  No one specifically looks for new <br/>
quests in hopes of getting a specific result.  They search for them to find <br/>
something new in hopes of profitting from it in some way.  These people <br/>
don&#39;t say &quot;let&#39;s find tinkering stuff today&quot;.  They say &quot;let&#39;s find <br/>
something new tody&quot;.  So, I do not agree with your statement that only a <br/>
tiny fraction of the world actively searches for things.  People stumble <br/>
upon stuff, its just unfortunate that none of it has been about tinkering.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; spyglass = useful?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Apparently wizards have a spell that does the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wizards have a whole line of such spells, but others don&#39;t, so I believe <br/>
that the spyglass is, at least, marginally useful.  The reasons are:<br/>
<br/>
1.  No merchant or mob drop supplies similar items.<br/>
2.  Most people can&#39;t perform similar feats using their class     abilities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; collapsible fishing pole = the reason for this list<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Useful??  Who the hell fishes anymore.  I can get free food from<br/>
&gt;clerics, mages,<br/>
&gt;rangers, druids...  Its use is only as a component, much like firewater.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, its useful, only to make spyglasses and to provide discussion on this <br/>
list.  Nothing more.  Not sure why you read that as &quot;game usefullness&quot;.  By <br/>
itself, it has no value.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I made a trip through akanon asking everyone about tinkering and fishing<br/>
&gt;poles<br/>
&gt;and looking at every merchant.  Couldn&#39;t find anything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is very clear that Akanon, city of the tinkering gnomes, has either <br/>
well-hidden tinker info or none at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As an aside, I heard from a post either here or on a WWW site that one<br/>
&gt;of the<br/>
&gt;files contains the text aqua-lung.  Could this be another tinkering<br/>
&gt;item?<br/>
&gt;It certainly sounds so.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It could be anything, or something not implemented, etc.  There really isn&#39;t <br/>
any reason to believe it is one thing or another.</div>
