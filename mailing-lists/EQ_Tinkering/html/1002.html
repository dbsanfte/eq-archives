<b>Subject:</b> My thoughts on pricing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-337638693"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So I charged 20plat.   Think it costs roughly 5-6<br/>
&gt;plat to make depending on your faction.  And take in consideration of<br/>
&gt;failures and 20pp seems fair to me, especially considering the travel<br/>
&gt;involved.  Shall we be agreed on what to charge for this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been trying to get the gnomes on Bertoxx to have a set price and not <br/>
have any undercutters. I myself was thinking 7pp for a pole.. but if you can <br/>
sell em for 20pp, I&#39;m game. As for a spyglass I was thinking 40pp was a nice <br/>
set price, but again.. if people buy em for 75pp that sounds good too =) But <br/>
I&#39;m positive we can sell a lot more if we charge double the cost of the <br/>
parts as opposed to 5x. I&#39;d like to see what you guys have to say about this <br/>
subject.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if we can work together and all sell for the same price so <br/>
it&#39;s not like other trade skills where someone sells something for the cost <br/>
+ 1pp or something then when you try to sell your wares for the cost x 5 you <br/>
don&#39;t have some newbie yelling out &quot;D00d I just bought my fishing pole for <br/>
5pp man this guy is rippin you all off.&quot; Yeah that was a run-on sentence.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I think it would be great if we could keep the tinkering market <br/>
controlled. I know we have a gnome guild on Bertoxx so it will be easy to <br/>
keep the items at a set price for awhile, and if you see anyone else <br/>
starting tinkering then tell em the deal too.<br/>
<br/>
I think I worded all that right. yeah.<br/>
<br/>
So what are your commments about what the fixed price for each item should <br/>
be? I&#39;ll start with this little table (thanks to Gnomad for the table from <br/>
his website =):<br/>
<br/>
ITEM               ROUGH COST TO MAKE  MY SUGGESTED FIXED PRICE<br/>
Animated Bait              4cp         5cp No one buys this anyway<br/>
Compass                    4pp         5pp Evil races may want this<br/>
(note that compasses cost more to make since the pottery patch)<br/>
Flameless Lantern          2pp         2pp No one buys this anyway<br/>
Mechanized Lockpicks       18pp        40pp Still hard to sell<br/>
Bow Cam                    15pp        30pp Sounds right<br/>
Stalking Probes            18pp        25pp? no clue<br/>
Spyglass                   20pp        40pp 2x cost sounds right to me<br/>
Collapsible Fishing Pole   5pp         7pp Sounds ok<br/>
Gnomish Fireworks          5g          Wait till this is fixed before we <br/>
even think of selling these =(<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also let&#39;s find a way to raise our faction with the merchants too so we pay <br/>
a lot less for those expensive components =) Also note that Merchant Faction <br/>
only affects the, umm.. &quot;real&quot; gnome merchants, not the clockwork <br/>
merchants... I think<br/>
