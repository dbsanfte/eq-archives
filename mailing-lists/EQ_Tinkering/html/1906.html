<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-574362234">I think I have noticed is several jewelry pieces that jewelers cant seem to<br/>
make, for example the ruby crown at the merchant in the freeport bank.  I<br/>
think there are some more of these &#39;unmade&#39; pieces of jewelry in high keep<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps what Gordon meant when he said that the gemcutter would not<br/>
&#39;enhance&#39; jewelcraft is that it wont make it easier to make items like the<br/>
platinum ruby vail.  This is what I hope!<br/>
