<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473123803">I think Str for smithing is supposed to help in learning, not <br/>
success.  This is for all those dumb, strong people (i.e. barbarians) <br/>
out there that say they should be able to learn smithing as easily as <br/>
someone who is smart but weak.  I didn&#39;t think stats affected success <br/>
rate, but if anyone has any good experimental data that shows <br/>
otherwise, I&#39;d like to know.<br/>
<br/>
What I have found is that when I boost INT up, I have a much better <br/>
chance in increasing skill.  Duh!  I have tried dex to a small degree <br/>
and didn&#39;t really notice any difference, but I didn&#39;t raise it as <br/>
high as I had raised INT so there might still be some hope.  However, <br/>
I don&#39;t think that the learning bonuses are cumulative, but rather <br/>
affected by your highest stat.  So for most gnomes, it will be <br/>
easiest to raise INT with regard to practicing tinkering.  I had been <br/>
raising my int to about 115, but with some borrowed items I raised it <br/>
fairly easily to around 145.  I didn&#39;t take down any stats, but it <br/>
did make a noticeable difference.  Keeping track of numbers makes it <br/>
seem too much like work. :P  But now that I&#39;m into the grownup <br/>
tinkering things I have to be a little more thrifty with my plat.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my long term goals are to make watchman armor for myself.  <br/>
Not that I would use it in battle, but it looks like it could freak <br/>
out some folks.  They already freak out at a gnome warrior.  Wait til <br/>
they see me running around with those bug eyes.<br/>
