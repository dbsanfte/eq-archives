<b>Subject:</b> Price of a spyglass <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-455699295">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
How much was Salvador selling his spyglasses for to the Xegony populous?  If<br/>
we had his selling price, we could assume he was making a profit of 50% and<br/>
that the spyglass was trivial to him.  Thus we could divide by 3/2, subtract<br/>
away all the other components of the spyglass, and viola!, have a rough<br/>
estimate of the fishing pole&#39;s component&#39;s cost!<br/>

<br/>
What a mouthful =),<br/>
