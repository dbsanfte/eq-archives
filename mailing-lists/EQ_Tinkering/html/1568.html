<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809096730">Hi<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To all the new ppl who dosent seam to think there is a skill cap and alsp who has it all wront.<br/>
The skill is caped Lv x 5 + 5 starting at lv 16, so lets make an example.<br/>
<br/>
Lv 32 Gnome wizard will be like this 32-16=16x5=80+5=85<br/>
<br/>
ANd nothing else, i put  in over 2 k on the skill and talked withe the head GM on Veeshan who tried it out with his char. Itï¿½s the same level cap as for research.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Askur Lv 32 Wizard of Veeshan with an Tinkering skill at 95 (Magicaly enhanced by the GM for all the cash i  put in and didnt get any points in it)<br/>

&gt; Last night I did my first tinkering of my gnomish career.  I spent about<br/>
&gt; 60pp after selling back everything I made and raised my skill from 50 to 58.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the skill cap is indeed (lvl * 5) - 13 (thanks Diabloklr) I have quite a<br/>
&gt; way to go before my lvl 18 gnome wiz hits 77.  Time to make some moola!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One thing I did learn last night.  Tinkering rocks!  I love it.  I have<br/>
&gt; never had so much fun with a trade skill.  There are all kinds of things to<br/>
&gt; make.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, last night people asked to buy a spyglass, cams, and a compass from me<br/>
&gt; when they heard I was trying to tinker.  So there is a market for some of<br/>
&gt; this stuff even though the market may be small.<br/>
