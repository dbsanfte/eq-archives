<b>Subject:</b> Re: Combinations for that fishing pole = 1,287 are possible (?) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-538427255">We can always resort to begging.    EVERYONE email EQ and tell them we are <br/>
pissed that the damned Collapsible fishing pole is so damned hard to find or <br/>
make.    For the time we have put into it it should be the Equivelant of the <br/>
Fiery avenger sword or SOUFIRE.     And the spyglass isn&#39;t too great!    Lets <br/>
show EQ the database and how much money has been invested maybe they feel <br/>
sorry for us and give us a hint.  <br/>
<br/>
Second idea,  That gnome that somone claims to have seen selling spyglasses.  <br/>
 Somone infiltrate his guild to get the damned secret.    Whoever told us <br/>
about it.   You volunteered.    Now away brave soldier and don&#39;t come back <br/>
unless you have something!<br/>
