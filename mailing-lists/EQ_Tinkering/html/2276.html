 </span></blockquote>We can&#39;t get over 200 skill yet, not untill at the very least the next<br/>
patch.  Its unknown if they will raise the Tinkering Cap to 250 with this<br/>
patch. (When they raise the others) Or if they will wait to raise the cap<br/>
untill they overhaul the whole skill.<br/>
<br/>
As it stands now once you hit 104 you pretty much are SOL unless you have<br/>
money to burn.  The only thing that can get you skill at this point are<br/>
Rebreathers and Aqualungs.  Even at max CHA it costs me roughly 225 plat to<br/>
ATTEMPT one Aqualung.  And they sell back for about 190 to a vendor, used<br/>
or empty of charges.  I pretty much stoped at 109 skill because it was just<br/>
costing me too much money for virtually no gain.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully one of the first things they add is a relatively inexpensive way<br/>
to gain skill after 104.<br/>
