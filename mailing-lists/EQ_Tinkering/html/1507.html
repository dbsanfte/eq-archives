<b>Subject:</b> RE: Enchanters (OFF TOPIC) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-836093152">The enchanter illusions are there as they are for a couple reasons.  The<br/>
fact that they cannot be shared is primarily due to the fact that if they<br/>
were sharable, then the faction system would largely be moot.  Why even<br/>
bother having a faction system when everybody can &quot;illusion&quot; to a<br/>
neutral/amiable race.<br/>
<br/>
The dev team is annoyed enough at the way &quot;guise of the deceiver&quot; is used<br/>
that they&#39;ve considered taking it out of the game.  There&#39;s no way they will<br/>
ever allow enchanter illusions to be cast on others.  While making them high<br/>
level would be an effective deterrent for folks on their own, anybody in a<br/>
guild with a high level enchanter would not be similarly disadvantaged.<br/>
<br/>
Currently the system is set up to allow ONLY enchanters to have this<br/>
advantage.  That&#39;s also why enchanters get the benevolence series and<br/>
charisma buffs.  Enchanters are the class that can go anywhere and do<br/>
(almost) any quest.  Allowing casting on others would grant that power to<br/>
all classes, if only indirectly through the enchanter.  It&#39;s not a matter of<br/>
limiting the enchanter, it&#39;s done to limit the other classes.  Frankly, the<br/>
illusions are about 20% of the reason that I love playing an enchanter so<br/>
much.  Too bad they limited the minor illusion object size.  It used to be<br/>
that you could minor illusion yourself to be the entire entry area to<br/>
felwith (big keep-like structure).  Now I just drop a plat coin down and<br/>
illusion myself to be it (and then pick it up) to amuse myself...<br/>

<br/>
die in a zone hostile to you, but a druid or an enchanter could just wander <br/>
in untouched due to thier illusion....makes you stew right?....Well ,I am an<br/>
<br/>
enchanter  tring to get support for request on change on how enchanters<br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
share illusions with others if given permission to it would be a neat way to<br/>
<br/>
get your corpse or ya thru a dangous area without cring foul to a GM or<br/>
