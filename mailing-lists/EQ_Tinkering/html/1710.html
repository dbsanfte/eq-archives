&gt;He gives you a 4 slot Box which is No Drop i belive.  Last i heard this<br/>
&gt;quest was broken because the Tiny skelitens you recive when you kill the<br/>
&gt;undead brownies are NO DROP, so getting 4 of them and filling the box is<br/>
&gt;not possible.  He also says he is in a hurry and gives you a deadline for<br/>
&gt;returning the full box to him.  I dont think anyone is killing him when he<br/>
&gt;spawns , just that he is rare and only spawns a certain times and then goes<br/>
&gt;away again.   hope this helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its not that the skels are NO DROP, its that they are LORE and all<br/>
Ident as the same item (rather than TSkel1, Tskel2, Tskel3, Tskel4 or<br/>
something similar).  Sorta like the cards quest outa akanon (take and<br/>
give this card to 5 different clockworks to get something from them.<br/>
the painfull thing is that the card he gives ya is lore. so ya get<br/>
one, do a cleaner, go back get another....)<br/>
<br/>
If you managed to get all 4 skels, once you box them and hit combine,<br/>
you would get a totally dif item (prolly a &quot;box of tiny bones&quot; or<br/>
something).</div>
