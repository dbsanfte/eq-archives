<div id="ygrps-yiv-934002291">Can you tell us where and when he spawns?  I can roam<br/>
the karanas for days without a tracker, so this<br/>
information would be really helpful <br/>
<br/>
Thanks =)<br/>

&gt; He gives you a 4 slot Box which is No Drop i belive.<br/>
&gt;  Last i heard this<br/>
&gt; quest was broken because the Tiny skelitens you<br/>
&gt; recive when you kill the<br/>
&gt; undead brownies are NO DROP, so getting 4 of them<br/>
&gt; and filling the box is<br/>
&gt; not possible.  He also says he is in a hurry and<br/>
&gt; gives you a deadline for<br/>
&gt; returning the full box to him.  I dont think anyone<br/>
&gt; is killing him when he<br/>
&gt; spawns , just that he is rare and only spawns a<br/>
&gt; certain times and then goes<br/>
&gt; away again.   hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Watchman Drexlin - this is a new quest, where one<br/>
&gt; of the guys the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Gemchoppers hall who previously never said anything<br/>
&gt; now directs you to find<br/>
&gt; &gt;Watchman Drexlin near Qeynos. According to<br/>
&gt; Allakhazam&#39;s site, he spawns<br/>
&gt; &gt;near/on the stone bridge between north and south<br/>
&gt; karana, on the north<br/>
&gt; &gt;Karana side and gives you a quest to kill Tiny<br/>
&gt; Skeletons. I&#39;ve never been<br/>
&gt; &gt;able to find him, probably due ot the sheer number<br/>
&gt; of powergaming weenies<br/>
&gt; &gt;that are KoS to gemchoppers from killing gnome<br/>
&gt; guards, so he probably<br/>
&gt; &gt;doesnt last too long once he pops. Has anyone<br/>
&gt; managed to complete this<br/>
&gt; &gt;quest yet? Is he always there unless someone kills<br/>
&gt; him, or does he only<br/>
&gt; &gt;spawn at certain times of the day... I&#39;m hoping the<br/>
&gt; later, cos it really<br/>
&gt; &gt;bugs me when people kill quest creatures - I still<br/>
&gt; remember when I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;young and I could only do the report quests after a<br/>
&gt; server reboot, becasue<br/>
&gt; &gt;the guard killers would often kill Joogl Doobraugh<br/>
&gt; as well, and he has a<br/>
&gt; &gt;really long spawn time..<br/>
