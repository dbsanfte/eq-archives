<div id="ygrps-yiv-635375238">I would think that varying levels of pets would be possible.  A 100 pt pet<br/>
would probably suffice as a maximum.  While such a pet would be overpowering<br/>
for a lower level character, they could easily restrict the level so that<br/>
only a 20+ lvl character could activate the best pet.<br/>
