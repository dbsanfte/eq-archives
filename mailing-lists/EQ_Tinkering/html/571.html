<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Solusek gnomes seems like a good place to try to learn about tinkering and<br/>
&gt; I intend to go there at level 24.  Being an enchanter, I&#39;m told that<br/>
&gt; monsters won&#39;t bother me if I&#39;m in elemental illusion, so maybe I can check<br/>
&gt; the place out and get lucky, who knows.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last night I went to Solusek&#39;s Eye at level 26.  In SolA I am majorly lost with<br/>
a ton of pitfalls into lava.  No thanks.  Some day I may both mapping it or<br/>
finding a map for it, and looking for the gnomes.  At the door is a couple of<br/>
goblins that were blue/green to me.  The shaman was blue, so I nuked him, and a<br/>
Wizard, Shaman, and two regular fire goblins came with him.  I zoned with 13 hp<br/>
left.  I might try going invis, but I know things in Nagafen&#39;s Lair can see<br/>
thru invis, so I am weary.  I don&#39;t want to get in a situation where I am in<br/>
the middle of 10 goblins and my invis wears off.  I am a gnome wizard who<br/>
follows the diety of solusek ro so I was hoping I have good faction here.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I haven&#39;t fished with animated bait yet, but I think its likely that it is<br/>
&gt; a component in a recipie, maybe for the collapsable pole.  Either that or<br/>
&gt; it may be a quest item or maybe it has some better fishing abilities.  No<br/>
&gt; tests have really been done to see that I know of.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did some experiments with the animated bait last night.  The cork costs 1cp,<br/>
the spricket 3cp.  They combine perfectly and are trivial at 50 skill level<br/>
(base).  So functionally they cost just as much as regular bait.  Performance<br/>
wise they are identical to regular bait.  Just more cumbersome and tedious to<br/>
make.  There is nothing special about it.  It looks the same, acts the same.<br/>
