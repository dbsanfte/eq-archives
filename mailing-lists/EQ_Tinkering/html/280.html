<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891606454">Time to revisit Akanon I think.  Maybe the guy down by the mines of<br/>
malfunction?  Also he probably meant that collapsable fishing poles fit in<br/>
small containers.  You cannot fit a large fishing pole into one of these.<br/>

&gt; Hi, I an a fisher and just have to tell you that regular fishing poles fit<br/>
&gt; in backpacks already right now.  This is just my guess but maybe I was<br/>
&gt; thinking that the collapsable ones weighed less or maybe couldn&#39;t break.<br/>
&gt; They would have to have some improvement over the regular ones right now...<br/>
&gt; but being able to fit in backpacks wouldn&#39;t be it.  See ya<br/>
