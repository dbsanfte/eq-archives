<div id="ygrps-yiv-787659380">Most of the clockwork merchants in Akanon and the vendors in Steamfont<br/>
(including the tinkering merchant) use the MerchantsofAkanon faction.  The<br/>
merchants at the caster&#39;s library use the Eldritch faction and the merchant<br/>
in the warriors guild uses the Gemchoppers faction.  Not sure about the<br/>
necro guild, cleric guild and the rest.<br/>
<br/>
You can raise the merchant faction by turning in rusted blackboxes to Manik<br/>
and  turning in scrap metal and micro servos to the scrapyard gnome.  After<br/>
handing in those items in very large quantities (I was bored, heh) I<br/>
finally saw my faction go from indifferent to amiable.  There are probably<br/>
some quests at the library that also raise the merchant faction and<br/>
probably faster but they won&#39;t give quests out with an apprehensive /con.<br/>
:(  However, from what I see faction doesn&#39;t seem to have as much of an<br/>
impact as CHA does.<br/>
<br/>
Fizzwiz pointed out a while back that if you plan to do some serious<br/>
tinkering you&#39;ll want to pick up some +CHA items like a Crude Stein.  Also<br/>
Enchanters have a nice +30 CHA buff that they can cast on you.  There&#39;ll be<br/>
a several plat difference on the more expensive components and that quickly<br/>
adds up.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt;Also let&#39;s find a way to raise our faction with the merchants too so we pay <br/>
&gt;a lot less for those expensive components =) Also note that Merchant Faction <br/>
&gt;only affects the, umm.. &quot;real&quot; gnome merchants, not the clockwork <br/>
&gt;merchants... I think<br/>
