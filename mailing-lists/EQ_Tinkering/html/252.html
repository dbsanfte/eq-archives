<div id="ygrps-yiv-312047081">They arn&#39;t patching the test server because they &quot;care&quot; more about the test server... as the name &quot;Test&quot; implies, it is a sever used for testing knew and updated source code... Most everything that is altered and/or added passes through the test server first... So is understandable that there will be multiple patches on the test server. Once they get it right, they dont need to patch more then once with the regular servers...<br/>

&gt;Look. That is the best news I&#39;ve heard in awhile on this mailing list, but I <br/>
&gt;think that Verant has been forggeting something.<br/>
&gt;They are about to patch the test server for the third! time in a row.<br/>
&gt;Alas they have not even patched the real game with the &quot;warrior patch&quot;<br/>
&gt;as it&#39;s called, which is the patch with the warrior improvements that they <br/>
&gt;patched onto the test server when they implemented the RW server codes into <br/>
&gt;the Test server. It just seems fishy that they only care about patching the <br/>
&gt;test server now, doesn&#39;t it to you?<br/>
