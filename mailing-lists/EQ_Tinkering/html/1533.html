<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866987398">There most defenitly used to be a skillcap on tinkering. The biggest proof <br/>
on this would be that Verant said that they were gonna fix, and if it is <br/>
gone now, more power to the tinkering gnomes who have sent numerous <br/>
/feedback /petition and mails to take it away..<br/>
<br/>
I have myself put over 10kp into tinkering and gotten it to a skill of 104 <br/>
or 105 (not sure which) and realized that you cant make a profit from the <br/>
lungs, my own sales argument on these is that i will trade em in for a <br/>
pricereduction of the same amount of pp on a rebreather when i can make <br/>
them. So, buy a lung from me for 500p, use it up, and when i can make the <br/>
rebreather, trade it in for one and get price reduced with the same 500p.<br/>
<br/>
This will work out fine as i guess you will still fail a lot of lungs even <br/>
when you can make the rebreathers, and the lungs would still work as a <br/>
reagent i would think, even if the charges are out. and you would still make <br/>
a profit with a 500p reduction, if you take that in consideration when you <br/>
set your price.<br/>
<br/>
My main income source on tinkering is the telescopes tho, ive sold at lease <br/>
100 of those, for a price of about 80p each. The best way to sell these for <br/>
me, has been to just use it where there are a lot of ppl :) And they DO have <br/>
some use, many ppl have bought em from me just to be able to see if the <br/>
ghoul lord in gukbottom is carrying a ssoy without having to get too close <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work, and someone PLEASE find diamond dust :)<br/>
