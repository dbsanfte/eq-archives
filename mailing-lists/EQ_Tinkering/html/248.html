<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114950495">Heh, I think I am one of the ones that started this thread a ways back<br/>
there...<br/>
 Anyway, I may have gotten confused due to the fact that as a newbie I<br/>
was attempting to do the quest (hey I was level 4, how was I to know<br/>
that Verant quest people are evil?) and was running around to all the<br/>
NPC&#39;s in the observatories asking if they &quot;had any spare lenses&quot; and one<br/>
of the mentions that Borxx&#39;s retina would make a perfect lens. hence my<br/>
confusion.<br/>

&gt; Let&#39;s get this straight. I DO know what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Borxx lens has nothing to do with the telescope quest.<br/>
&gt; The telescope lens has nothing to do with the staff quest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They are completely different. Just because there is a lens involved DOES<br/>
&gt; not mean that they are related. One is a lens made of biological material<br/>
&gt; that is gotten off of an evil eye named Borxx, if I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The others are 4 telescope lenses made of glass, probably made by the<br/>
&gt; gnomes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A piece of glass for a telescope lens couldn&#39;t be substituted with a lens<br/>
&gt; from a living things eye, just as the lens of an eye could not be<br/>
&gt; substituted with a glass lens (and no contacts only assist is correcting<br/>
&gt; your vision problems which are caused by the actual eye lens). That is all<br/>
&gt; there is two it -- end of story. The two quests are completely seperate and<br/>
&gt; have absolutely nothing to do with each other. So if you want to talk about<br/>
&gt; how to get the Staff of the Observers, then maybe you should subscribe to a<br/>
&gt; mailing list that is interested in it. This is a tinkering list, so unless<br/>
&gt; you have some kind of evidence that The Staff is involed in a tinkering<br/>
&gt; quest, then lets drop it, ok?<br/>
