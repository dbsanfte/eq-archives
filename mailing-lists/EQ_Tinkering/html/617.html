<b>Subject:</b> Animated Fishing Bait <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-262488186">Has anyone tried animated fishing bait as an ingredient for the collapsable<br/>
fishing pole? It isn&#39;t really mentioned in the recipe, but it is directly<br/>
related to fishing and extremely cheap/easy to make, making it a likely<br/>
ingrediant for the apparantly inexpensive fishing pole and easy to<br/>
incorporate into the existing failed recipes.<br/>
