<br/>
Long time reader, first time poster here. I spoke with a GM last night on<br/>
Rallos Zek and although he would not say for sure if the fail ratio was<br/>
increased he did say that Verant is actively looking for ways to get rid of<br/>
platinum in the realms and this may very likely be one of them. Just a<br/>
thought.<br/>

&gt; Subject: RE: Success / Failure ratios<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a feeling the way skill lvls for trades is set up, it may be<br/>
exactly<br/>
&gt; like ones level, complete with hell levels.  I haven&#39;t raised my tinkering<br/>
&gt; skill very high yet, but with my primary character, I have my fletching<br/>
&gt; skill to 135 currently.  During that time, I noticed that the level or two<br/>
&gt; right before the trivial point of what I was working on would take a<br/>
&gt; disproportionately high number of attempts to gain, and my success rate<br/>
&gt; would be extremely low.  Often just after trivializing something I would<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; fairly good success rates and skill increase on the next level of product.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps this was a fluke with my observations, but maybe it explains some<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the success ratios and maddeningly expensive skill point gains.  Another<br/>
&gt; thing I have noticed, which may be just my luck, is I seem to have a<br/>
better<br/>
&gt; success ratio and skill gain if my wisdom is higher than my int,<br/>
regardless<br/>
&gt; of how high they are.  Higher int does seem to help skill gain to a good<br/>
&gt; degree, but it really seemed that if I got my int higher than my wis, the<br/>
&gt; skill gain would slow a bit, and my success ratio would go way down.  Just<br/>
&gt; some of my observations, take em with a grain of salt.<br/>

&gt;     I think it has to do with the skill level you are at.  I suspect there<br/>
&gt; may<br/>
&gt;     be &#39;hell&#39; levels you have to work through.  I recently started to<br/>
tinker<br/>
&gt;     with my character.  I made flameless lanterns all the way to 68, then<br/>
&gt;     switched to cams.  I did 8 at a time with the cams.  The first batch,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt;     6 for 8.  The next batch, I was 8 for 8.  I was at skill 74 after that<br/>
&gt; (75<br/>
&gt;     is trivial).  I then went 1 for 6 getting that last point.  I&#39;ve begun<br/>
&gt;     making stalking probes since they are cheaper to make than the<br/>
&gt;     spyglasses.  I don&#39;t have firm stats on it, but I did 50% for about<br/>
10,<br/>
&gt;     then went on a 1 for 6 streak, then back to 50% again for the next 4.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt;     suspect there may be some sticking points you have to work through<br/>
(for<br/>
&gt;     example, skill level of 73 might bring more successes than 74).   I<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt;     seems odd, but its either that, or I had a run of bad luck.  BTW,<br/>
&gt; nothing<br/>
&gt;     changed during any of the attempts, 109 wisdom, 140 intelligence.<br/>

&gt;     &gt;Out of my first 2 attempts I manufactured 2.<br/>
&gt;     &gt;Out of my next 8 attemps I manufactured NONE!<br/>
