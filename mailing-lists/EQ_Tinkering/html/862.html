<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654468619">I searced all over that tent with the dwarves on the sisters island. I saw<br/>
no bags whatsoever, only 2 dwarves, a fire, and a tree stump with a forge on<br/>
it. I am on the Solusek Ro server. Is this only missing on my server? Or<br/>
maybe only select servers have this &quot;secret button&quot;.<br/>

&gt; &gt;The shark I found was due south of the &#39;sisters&#39; isle and conned green to<br/>
&gt; &gt;me at 34. Its probably in the mid to high 20&#39;s. It didnt attack me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That was the only monster I found underwater so far, except perhaps for a<br/>
&gt; &gt;few wading cyclops =).<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve managed to piece this together from a lot of rumors... for all of you<br/>
&gt; out there with a Fishbone Earring or such.... go to the sisters isle in<br/>
&gt; OOT.... have someone find the dwarves at the forge (located on the isle)<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; click on one of the bags located there (heard one is a secret button)...<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; should hear a grating noise... the person with the earring should search<br/>
&gt; under the water for an open secret passage that should be open now...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I heard there&#39;s a sunken ship somewhere possibly within the OOT or<br/>
&gt; Erud&#39;s Crossing that is it&#39;s own zone. Perhaps one of these suggestions is<br/>
&gt; what we seek?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again - I based all this off of various rumors I heard and pieced<br/>
together,<br/>
&gt; plus the clue &quot;search under the waves&quot;.<br/>
