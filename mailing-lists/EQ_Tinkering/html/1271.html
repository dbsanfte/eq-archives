<div id="ygrps-yiv-396338127">Well, to their credit, they maintain and have always maintained that EQ is a<br/>
Player vs. Environment game.  They allow trade skills because they are so<br/>
widely desired, but they always would prefer that you go out and kill things<br/>
to get good items instead.  The trade skills will NEVER allow you to create<br/>
something good for less effort than it would take to kill something for it<br/>
or get enough money to buy it from somebody who did.<br/>
<br/>
So really they&#39;re just following their design, which shows some remarkable<br/>
unity of purpose.  On the flipside though, the emphasis on PvE turns a lot<br/>
of people off over time.  It would be nice if there were ways to be a viable<br/>
&quot;smith&quot; or &quot;artisan&quot; character.  There isn&#39;t though, and given their<br/>
dedication to PvE (and their original design) it&#39;s highly unlikely it ever<br/>
will be.  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since beta 2 and I have to say that while I<br/>
don&#39;t always agree with Verant, they are remarkably consistent and they<br/>
almost always have good reasons for what they do (minus bugs).<br/>
<br/>
Those who want to do a lot of crafty type things will probably have to wait<br/>
until a game comes along that emphasizes that instead of killing stuff.  EQ<br/>
is an excellent game, but it&#39;s scope is somewhat limited in that respect.<br/>

Yes... I think verant is still riding their same old no class useless<br/>
fanatic rage... thats why you see gate potions cost about 1000pp, just<br/>
because all the whining wizards and druids (im a druid btw, and they whine<br/>
ALOT, and have nothing to whine about!) think that they will become useless<br/>
in groups... So I think this is part of it, they dont want to make<br/>
druids/enchanters/necros/sks feel less important by making it easy to<br/>
obtain, so then people will think hmmm why dont I just get a druid or ranger<br/>
to cast enduring breath instead of wasting 1000pp on a rebreather. Its a big<br/>
damn game for verant (literally) so they gotta make it as &quot;hard&quot; as possible<br/>
=(. Not to mention that they doomed their own player economy by their making<br/>
trade skills damn near worthless, and weve seen evidence of that,<br/>
jewelcrafters have to sell their items at insane prices because they fail<br/>
even at 200 skill, so nobody buys them. 600pp for a BP ring... hmm maybe I<br/>
can just keep my dervish rings and get a shaman in the party (I know its a<br/>
ludicrous thought but apparently this is what brad mcquaid thinks). lemme<br/>
know what you guys think on this whole trade skill business.<br/>
