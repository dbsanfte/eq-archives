<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009451244">As far as the AC goes, I am expecting that it will fall in line with <br/>
the fine steel plate AC with random &quot;right-clickable&quot; effects. (Hence <br/>
the need for mana batteries.)  Will be off and running with the <br/>
footwarming boots, with my secondary tinkerer to attempt to find the <br/>
trivial point next week after I get back from my extended holiday <br/>
vacation.<br/>

&gt; I just want to know if Watchman armor is going to be worthwhile or <br/>
&gt; not.  I hope they give it decent AC and we don&#39;t have the <br/>
&gt; mysteriously disappearing AC like we do for rebreathers.  But we <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t know until someone makes it.  Sigh...<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the info in advance.<br/>
