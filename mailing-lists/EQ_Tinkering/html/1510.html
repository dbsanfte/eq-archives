<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089165212">Of course enchanter illusions should not be shared. I totally agree that it <br/>
would make the game faction useless in many aspects. About the druid spell <br/>
share wolfform it only makes you non KoS to undead, as in Unrest or <br/>
Mistmoore. And if you stay in Mistmoore to long, you will still get your <br/>
faction down so much that you are KoS even in wolfform (dunno about Unrest, <br/>
never liked that place much :P), while if enchanter illusions would make you <br/>
non KoS in just about any zone in game, ending with shared illusion:skeleton <br/>
(non KoS in Hate). Illusion Werewolf might also be a lil too much as it has <br/>
a &quot;SoW&quot; effect to it that also works indoors. One would say that its not <br/>
fair to other classes that enc can do all this but well, enc can do just <br/>
about nothing solo, so if they are indifferent or fast it dont do them much <br/>
good in a dungeon anyhow as their teammates are not. And even if i am wrong <br/>
about them not beeing able to solo (after lvl 30 or so) the enc class is a <br/>
GROUP class like no other (well maybe clerics :P) and they just plain <br/>
shouldnt be soloing anyhow :)<br/>
<br/>
And someone PLEASE find diamond dust soon, i need to get my skill up bu <br/>
something cheaper than aqualungs :)<br/>
