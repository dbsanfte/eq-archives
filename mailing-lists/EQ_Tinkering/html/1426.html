Stop your whinning about not having a web site to hold your hand while you tinker. Every recipe in the game can be found in a book either on Bom Knotwood at the wind mills or another gnome in Akanon.<br/>
<br/>
Geez, after all the pain and suffering most of us tinkers have gone thru if you newcomers cant even scrape up a few gold to buy a damn book you dont deserve to be tinkers, and I sure as hell aint gonna help ya ... =|<br/>
