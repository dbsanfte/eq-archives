<b>Subject:</b> Need to find Diamond Dust!! Plz Help! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266509639">Where is Diamond Dust found? i am stuck at 102 skill and find it hard to <br/>
believe that the aqua lung is the next step up from probes. i also attempted <br/>
a lung at skill 102...failed.<br/>
somoe else posted that they believe the gem cutter is the next step <br/>
item..and i must say i agree with this, if only we could find the diamond <br/>
dust...<br/>
so please, anyone who might know this information, please post it here so <br/>
that your fellow gnomes can trudge on through the skill in the hopes of one <br/>
day tinkering a rebreather that is &quot;trivial.&quot; thx.<br/>
