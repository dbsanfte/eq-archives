&gt; Fellow Tinkers,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I come before you with open arms and open log books<br/>
&gt; to report the history of my tinkering.  Please<br/>
&gt; forgive my verbosity for I am a quiet tinkering<br/>
&gt; gnome wizard that spends much time muttering to<br/>
&gt; himself. :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I made each of the following in order until it went<br/>
&gt; trivial.  Flameless Lanterns, Standard Bow Cams,<br/>
&gt; Spyglasses, and finally Stalking Probes.  This of<br/>
&gt; course got me to 102 skill.  At no point did I<br/>
&gt; attempt an item until every lesser item was<br/>
&gt; trivial.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a side note, I have always sold Spyglasses for<br/>
&gt; 80pp and have sold well over 100 of them but lost<br/>
&gt; count.  I&#39;ve sold 18 in a night before.  I have<br/>
&gt; firmly established 80pp as the going rate on Povar<br/>
&gt; through endless auctioning in all manner of zones,<br/>
&gt; be it newbie, mid-level, or LGuk/SolB.  Spyglasses<br/>
&gt; are a great way to help finance Aqualung attempts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /auction Selling tinkered Spyglass with unlimited<br/>
&gt; charges of Telescope (like binoculars).  Great for<br/>
&gt; pullers!  80pp.  Use it to spot that rare wandering<br/>
&gt; spawn!<br/>

&gt; pullers!  80pp.  Use it to spot naked newbies!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of the below Aqualungs, I painfully, over many<br/>
&gt; weeks, sold all of the first 30 I produced.  I<br/>
&gt; charged 500pp for each and barely covered costs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /auction Selling a tinkered Aqualung with 50<br/>
&gt; charges of waterbreathing (half hour RL each) for<br/>
&gt; 500pp (merchant pays 190pp, so 310pp net). To<br/>
&gt; compare, 50 EB potions costs 600pp and do not<br/>
&gt; stack!  Declare your independence from EB casters!<br/>
&gt; Support the trades!<br/>

&gt; stack!  It&#39;s winter, help the fish keep their<br/>
&gt; scales!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When tinkering Aqualungs, I got a wis suit from<br/>
&gt; a plat level enchanter friend.  I would get these<br/>
&gt; buffs from a 44+ enchanter (/who all enc 44 50):<br/>
&gt; wis/int/str/cha.  Since I am a wizard, I could<br/>
&gt; go to them while being bound at the tinkering<br/>
&gt; merchant or the Ak&#39;Anon bank as the mood struck.<br/>
&gt; I would replace int gear with wis gear until my<br/>
&gt; int (with buff) was 199 and my wis was 132.  I<br/>
&gt; never bought or sold with a cha less than 100.  By<br/>
&gt; the way, cha over 100 is the same as cha 100.<br/>
&gt; Also, pay a plat and get a SoW...speeds things up.<br/>

&gt;  100%   69.10%   30.89%      18.70%<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Was trivial on the 3rd try of this batch.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After the first 30 successes were sold, I sold<br/>
&gt; my Runed Cowl for fort knox to a level 50 wizard<br/>
&gt; and converted all the items into cash.  Along<br/>
&gt; with what I already had, this got me a nestegg<br/>
&gt; of 17kpp.  I did the last 180 tries of Aqualungs<br/>
&gt; by selling the successes back to the merchant.<br/>
&gt; This cost me 12.5kpp to reach the trivial point.<br/>
&gt; If anyone on Povar has a spare Runed Cowl, I<br/>
&gt; would be very thankful. :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Given that my cost-with-failures per Aqualung is<br/>
&gt; now 270pp, Rebreathers are 966pp per try.  I will<br/>
&gt; now charge the public 400pp per Aqualung.  The<br/>
&gt; Rebreather will cost the public 3000pp or trade<br/>
&gt; equivalent.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Given just those prices, 7.5 Aqualungs can be<br/>
&gt; bought for the price on one Rebreather.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; 187.5 RL hours under water.  And that doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; count the fact that the Aqualung, once used, can<br/>
&gt; be sold to a merchant for some plats to help buy<br/>
&gt; even more Aqualungs for the same net cost as the<br/>
&gt; Rebreather.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s no question in my mind that the Aqualung<br/>
&gt; is a much more economical solution and the<br/>
&gt; Rebreather is just nice for those people with too<br/>
&gt; much money.  To put the final nail in the coffin,<br/>
&gt; Aqualungs can be activated from the inventory<br/>
&gt; but Rebreathers must be worn in the head slot.<br/>
&gt; For the average caster with a Runed Cowl or tank<br/>
&gt; with a massive helm, this is a real pain.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally, I thought I&#39;d share my broader trade<br/>
&gt; skill experience.<br/>
