&gt; I am one of those people that truly believes in conspiracy theories and<br/>
&gt; in my <br/>
&gt; opinion the CFPole is a conspiracy.  How do we all know that someone on<br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; very list might have given us a so called &quot;broken recipe&quot; and it was<br/>
&gt; actually <br/>
&gt; the right one but they wanted to throw people off and have people not<br/>
&gt; try it? <br/>
&gt;  Cause think about it if someone turns in a recipe that so called<br/>
&gt; &quot;doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; work&quot; then NO ONE will even try that recipe again because they know it <br/>
&gt; &quot;doesn&#39;t work&quot; thus they are one of the few people who can actually make<br/>
&gt; it.  <br/>
&gt; So those are just my thoughts.  And as 4 the four slot thing I think<br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; might be real.  I think this recipe probably is 4 slots.  But then again<br/>
&gt; how <br/>
&gt; do you all know that I haven&#39;t made one my self and just lying?  Dont<br/>
&gt; trust <br/>
&gt; any one cept guildmates that&#39;s what I have learned over the years.<br/>
