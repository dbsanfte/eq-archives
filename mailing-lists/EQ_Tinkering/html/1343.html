<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569623337">where to start...where to start...ok. First off...whoever stated to &quot;not <br/>
care what others sell them for,&quot; well, that is a GREAT idea, so why dont we <br/>
all just follow it?  This whole argument started because some smart-ass <br/>
attacked my post of how i sold Lungs.  Therefore i felt i had to defend <br/>
myself.  Admit it or not, greed has and will play a BIG part of your sales i <br/>
presume...if you are such good buisnessmen/women that you all say you are <br/>
then you will not have any trouble selling these.  Good for you. i really <br/>
dont care.  This board is meant for tinkering, so lets keep it at that.  No, <br/>
i am not ashamed for posting my last post, as everything i stated is true.<br/>
As for the buisness side of things, you may be making more money than i am, <br/>
but i still have a net profit, and my skill has gone up a lot, and MOST <br/>
importantly, i have a VERY loyal customer base. So before you jump on the <br/>
bandwagon to attack a perfect stranger, why dont you take a look at <br/>
yourselves first.  last night i sold 8 lungs, think you an do better? net <br/>
profit: 1400plat ( after replenishing my stock).<br/>
this is my style of buisness, it is working rather splendidly for me, so why <br/>
do you care?<br/>
