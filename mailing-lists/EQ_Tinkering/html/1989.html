&gt;    The pattern idea has piqued my interest, unfortunately my young <br/>
&gt; Tinkerer does not have the skill or the diamond dust for a gemcutter yet but <br/>
&gt; there are several patterns that you can buy in the Southern Desert of Ro<br/>
&gt; from the dark elf merchants that had no use as far as I could tell.<br/>
&gt; They may be idol patterns of some sort I&#39;ll doublecheck today and see.<br/>
&gt; Could it possibly be one of these patterns along with gemcutter/stone/metal bar<br/>
&gt; that give the elusive gemcutter a purpose?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those patterns are used in the pottery skill to make cookie molds used in<br/>
the baking skill, so you can make &quot;Barbarian Cookies&quot;, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Unless these are different patterns.<br/>
