<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598676075"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Correct me if I am wrong, but are you saying that spell <br/>
&gt; research does not <br/>
&gt; have a cap?  You are mistaken if you think so.  To be as objective as <br/>
&gt; possible, I will detail the circumstances that convince me that spell <br/>
&gt; research is capped per level.<br/>

]&gt; The conventional knowledge right now is that there is a skill cap of<br/>
]&gt; (level-15)*5 for research. I really hope that this is not the case.<br/>
]&gt;<br/>
]&gt; Could you please quickly outline how research is supposed to work, and<br/>
]also<br/>
]&gt; outline how guild practices work? Can we train up to this supposed level<br/>
]cap<br/>
]&gt; at the magic users guild? or is there a magic number at which we can no<br/>
]&gt; longer train - like trade skills (21)?<br/>
]&gt;<br/>
]&gt; Is research considered a trade skill or a casting skill?<br/>
]<br/>
]    Research is more of a trade skill - I believe that the skill is NOT<br/>
]capped.<br/>

Although unrelated to tinkering, I thought you should be corrected on this<br/>
issue - if you dont beleive me, email GZ yourself - he is very forthcoming<br/>
and has ALWAYS replied to my emails.<br/>
