If these are his true feelings, then wouldn&#39;t it be &quot;common sense&quot; to assum that he himself should have also worked towards this &quot;secret&quot;... the old fashion way.. yet instead, from the way he has worded it, and I understand, he has (if there is any truth to this at all) conned this information out of this &quot;Secret group&quot;. If you look beyond his flavored use of words and meaningless advice, he is no better... nothing more... then us, the people who instead of researching ourselves want the information handed to us... although we attempt some form of detective work, it is mainly the view of a bat... we look around blindly for the answer, however we still, deep down expect the answer to be handed to us through sound (word of mouth). My point is, if this was something that people wanted to keep secret, they would not let it leak to ppl such as &quot;Joshua Bednarz&quot; who brag about this so called knowledge on the Tinkering list itself... because this, this is how stuff gets leaked.. one person says something, which leads to someone else gaining the knowledge, and the never ending catalyist begins. So thank you Joshua, thank you for pushing over the first domino... now the fun begins! <br/>

&gt;I do know something. I took all my knowledge, everything I know, used all <br/>
&gt;the common sense I have, and was able to talk my way into a clue from a <br/>
&gt;person that knows all about the fishing poles. At first I thought whoever <br/>
&gt;knew about it was selfish, that they had no right to keep this, but then <br/>
&gt;when I found out that this group of people worked hard for what they had <br/>
&gt;found, and are very secrective about it, don&#39;t deserve their secret to be <br/>
&gt;given away. I mean, THEY are the ones that found the secret, and yes it is a <br/>
&gt;secret, so why is it that they should just go off and tell everyone? This <br/>
&gt;game is all about exploration and finding things, and having fun. Thats what <br/>
&gt;they did, and they found something, so why shouldn&#39;t you have to do the same <br/>
&gt;thing that they did? Why should you just sit back and happily profit from <br/>
&gt;all thier work? This group, whom is a very secretive group, whom I shall not <br/>
&gt;name, worked hard to get what they know, and so I&#39;m not going to go giving <br/>
&gt;away the clue I was told, especially after the rude, immature, derogatory <br/>
&gt;comments that were made about me. I will tell you this though. Waste not a <br/>
&gt;plat more on trying combinations. You are not only wasting your money, but <br/>
&gt;you are wasting your time. Search the world, high and low, search the world <br/>
&gt;above and below...<br/>
&gt;This is all I will say. It&#39;s been nice being part of this list. I though you <br/>
&gt;were a bunch of decent people. Your coments have changed my mind. I will no <br/>
&gt;longer be a part of this list as you wish. It&#39;s been fun guys, and thanks <br/>
&gt;for all the fish.<br/>
