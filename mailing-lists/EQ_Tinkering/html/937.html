 </span></blockquote>Actually, he didn&#39;t used to be shrunk.  I think it&#39;s a bug that was <br/>
introduced somewhat recently.  Kinda like how the guise of the deciever can <br/>
bugout and make the wearer a 10ft tall dark elf.<br/>
<br/>
I have always wondered why he is seemingly always in human form.<br/>
