<div id="ygrps-yiv-617853607">Yup, I knew exactly what kind of message to expect from this troll,<br/>
something along the lines of: &quot;I wanted to help but you were mean to me, so<br/>
now its your fault you don&#39;t know&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m unsure of is how was this one-list chosen to be your trolling<br/>
grounds?  Did you figure it would be the place most likely to give you<br/>
attention because we seemed so intent on finding out new things about<br/>
tinkering?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At anyrate, until I read otherwise, you don&#39;t know jack, you don&#39;t have any<br/>
good leads, any good knowledge, any good anything.  Until I see it in black<br/>
and white, your just a troll trying to get some attention...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why do you all act like this? I try to help, but you decline it. If what you <br/>
&gt;want is for me to truly leave with my information, then that is what I will <br/>
&gt;do. I will leave the choice up to you. I&#39;m trying to apologize by helping, <br/>
&gt;but you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;out here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What I <br/>
&gt;have to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just want <br/>
&gt;to check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all hate <br/>
&gt;me so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because <br/>
&gt;you think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all <br/>
&gt;with out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept it <br/>
&gt;or decline it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The fact that your not willing to reveal what it is you have to do, so that<br/>
&gt;&gt;others on the list, some of whom are in the high level 40s can do this only<br/>
&gt;&gt;suggests that your simply back to troll some more.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;So why don&#39;t you just kindly leave?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Oh wait, you want to troll a bunch of messages so then you can come back in<br/>
&gt;&gt;a couple days and say something like, &quot;Well, I found the important thing,<br/>
&gt;&gt;but since you all were unkind to me I won&#39;t reveal it, but this time its<br/>
&gt;&gt;your alls faults, not mine.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Gimme a break and just leave...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
