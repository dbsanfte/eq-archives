<div id="ygrps-yiv-917796197">I found it odd that the book mentions this:<br/>
<br/>
The flask of firewater attached to my belt ... metal<br/>
rod in the Tattered Gnomish Cloak.<br/>
<br/>
Now, currently we need to know two things:<br/>
<br/>
1 - Which quest gives the tattered items?  I heard<br/>
there was one in the warriors guild.  Which one?<br/>
<br/>
2 - Why does this mention &quot;firewater attached to my<br/>
belt&quot;.  Do we need to add some sort of &quot;belt&quot; into the<br/>
equation?  Although this would be contradictory to a<br/>
cloak for the most part, it WOULD make sense.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Where can I find store-bought pie tins?  Or do I have<br/>
to smith them myself?  Everyone else wants money to do<br/>
it (when I offer to buy the parts).<br/>
<br/>
I have this to make the compass:<br/>
<br/>
1 flask water<br/>
1 static orb<br/>
1 skewers<br/>
1 cork<br/>
<br/>
I just need the pie tin.  Damn is it hard to find<br/>
someone who SELLS them.<br/>
