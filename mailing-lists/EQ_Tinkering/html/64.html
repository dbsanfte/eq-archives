<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131823891">Ive never done that lens quest, so i suppose you could try that. However often quest items are different with each item, however it doesnt show physicaly. For instance the jumjum quest in rivervale.. The jumjum dropped from Nillipus looks just the same, and its discription when right clicked is exacly the same as the jumjum bought from a npc, however when you try to use the boughten jumjum, it doenst work. The same theory may apply with trying to get the same lens over and over and using them all... just a thought...<br/>

It just says +ACI-telescope lens+ACI- and is stackable. I guess I could <br/>
just kill her 4 times and hand over the lenses and see what <br/>
happens. Never thought about that.<br/>
