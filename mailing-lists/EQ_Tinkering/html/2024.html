<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293661355">Just in case anyone was interested, I did the Gearheart quest 10 times on<br/>
the weekend, to see if there was a hidden reward in the style of<br/>
bullsmasher or the fabulous compactor - my friend was killing him for the<br/>
exp, he was blue to a 32-33 and I was running backwards and fowards turning<br/>
in his blackbox.. The rewards I got were small leather boots, small leather<br/>
writstbands, small round shield, bronze warhammer, bronze short sword...<br/>
That hammer had me exited for a bit when I saw it appear, thinking it<br/>
perhaps was an upgraded bullsmasher :) But so far the reward looks a little<br/>
light for a level 30 quest... Though at level 20 the 10 attempts got me<br/>
about 1.5 bubbles of exp :) My factilon at the time was Kindly, but after I<br/>
got bored I went and killed rogue clockworks for scrap to try and get the<br/>
compactor, which got my faction up to warmly, so I might try it a few more<br/>
times next weekend..<br/>
