<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729898262">I never said the fishing pole was a rare drop.  The spyglass is most definitely<br/>
a rare drop.  Things are only worth as much as they are useful.  People don&#39;t<br/>
collect things in everquest.  They buy things to use.  I don&#39;t know how good<br/>
the spyglass is, but if it isn&#39;t that good then it would not be worth that<br/>
much.<br/>

&gt; Hey again,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the fishing pole were a very rare item in the game (1 out of 400 drops),<br/>
&gt; then that would make it worth more money.  But if Salvador was including<br/>
&gt; them in his spyglasses cheaply, then he had to making them (or being given<br/>
&gt; them by some unknown source).  I believe that the fishing pole is a real<br/>
&gt; tinkerable item for this reason and that Salavador (if he can be trusted)<br/>
&gt; told us the cork isn&#39;t in the formula (thus, he knows it).<br/>
