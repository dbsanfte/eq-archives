<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547221090">Has anyone tried just going on the test server and seeing if that gnome that <br/>
is selling those other 2 books sells the 3rd one? The gm he talked to in the <br/>
chat room said he was on the test server and had them. Maybe there testing a <br/>
new item no one has discovered or has been able to make and want to see if it <br/>
works before puting on live servers. I would do this myself but for some <br/>
reason the unrest.xm_ file won&#39;t download fully from the patch. oh well. Tell <br/>
me what you find. or don&#39;t find.<br/>
