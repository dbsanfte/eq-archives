<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092688454">Wings are fairly easy to get (still rare) and they stack.  Consumables are <br/>
around 100pp.  The question is whether you will raise your skill from <br/>
attempting armor.  Because the trivial point for the armor is higher than <br/>
rebreathers, and you fail considerably on them, you will raise your skill <br/>
at a slower rate than if you attempted the rebreathers.  Therefore, IF it <br/>
takes 100 attempts to raise one point from making armor versus 10 attempts <br/>
from making rebreathers (I&#39;ve averaged one point per 10 attempts in <br/>
general), then it would be a wash besides the collection of the wings.  I <br/>
would be surprised its this bad, so I guess maybe 20 attempts at armor will <br/>
raise a point.  Therefore, each point would cost 2000pp plus 20 holgresh <br/>
wings.  Versus 10000pp involved with rebreathers.  And who knows, you&#39;re <br/>
bound to get lucky once and actually make a piece of armor.<br/>
<br/>
My plan is to camp the holgresh and collect a load of wings and fur and try <br/>
to raise my skill that way.  Its currently 143, so I will finish out with <br/>
aqualungs at first.  At least they sell back at 30pp below cost.<br/>
<br/>
Also another factor is time.  Think about how much money you have to carry <br/>
with you from the bank if you want to attempt 10 rebreathers.  Thats <br/>
10kpp.  You can&#39;t move with that much money, you will have to attempt 3 or <br/>
4 rebreathers at a time max, then go back to the bank for more money.  With <br/>
the armor, most all items are stackable, the heavy non stackable items <br/>
being the armor... which you get back when you fail.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the other hand, does any of the dropped items you need stack?  If<br/>
&gt;so, it might be possible to carry over a nice supply of them to<br/>
&gt;Steamfont and keep making attempts at the Watchman armor.  If the<br/>
&gt;plate is returned, then it might be cheaper than Rebreathers.  Can<br/>
&gt;anyone confirm this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks, my tinkering is up to 128, so I know I have some work to do<br/>
&gt;and any help would be appreciated.  Now, I just have to find the<br/>
&gt;funds.  hmm...<br/>
