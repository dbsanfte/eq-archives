<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793757649">I am new to the list and to tinkering as well.  I decided to<br/>
give my hand at tinkering because I wanted to find a skill that<br/>
would serve some purpose to other (higher level) players.  <br/>
I didn&#39;t want to do jewelry, because it seemed pretty overdone.<br/>
Nothing else seemed interesting, and although I read many<br/>
posts about how useless tinkering is, I thought I would<br/>
give it a go anyway in hopes that it would at least provide<br/>
some depth of character and entertainment to me and my<br/>
friends.  Perhaps it will be more valuable since the<br/>
scuba diving and Kedge Keep patch?<br/>
<br/>
Few questions - <br/>
<br/>
- Can people actually sell the stuff that they have made?<br/>
 I&#39;ve put together a couple fishing poles, but ended up <br/>
just giving them away since no one would buy them (even at<br/>
cost...)<br/>
<br/>
- With 195 int, how much money does it take to get up to<br/>
  a reasonable tinkering skill (like 60,75,100...?)<br/>
<br/>
- Does anyone know if these things will become stackable?<br/>
  I have to carry around like 8 backpacks just to practice<br/>
  tinkering with!<br/>
<br/>
- Do you see any hope of this being a player valuable skill<br/>
  besides just being a scuba gear maker?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more questions later.  I too will be<br/>
searching for the scuba gear information and will post if I get it<br/>
or any clues.<br/>

P.S. I made some fireworks for my friends going away party.  Although<br/>
     it didn&#39;t oooo and aaahhh them, they did get a good laugh out of it<br/>
     and had a good time...  (10 elven wines might have helped too....)</div>
