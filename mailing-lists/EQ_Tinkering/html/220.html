<div id="ygrps-yiv-259249255">No, I unvis when I try to talk to them.  Meldrath and the guards dont <br/>
attack me, I am Level 26, so they spawns in the room dont mess with me <br/>
unless i try to med while visible.  The only time i get attacked by <br/>
Meldrath is when I try to kill a spawn in the room and he runs for <br/>
it.  Meldrath then hits me with an infectous cloud and I can&#39;t go back into <br/>
that room without getting hit with it again until I zone and come back.<br/>

&gt;Actually, they won&#39;t respond anyway. You have to be visible to get NPC&#39;s <br/>
&gt;to respond to you. This would mean you&#39;d have to kill the guards and <br/>
&gt;Meldrath.... </span></blockquote></div>
