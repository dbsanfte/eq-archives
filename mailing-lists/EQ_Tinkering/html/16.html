<b>Subject:</b> Been there done that, Flameless Lantern <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-842635845">Ok, so after the solution for Firewater was given<br/>
to me, I tried Tinkering the stuff, simple. Worked<br/>
every time. Then I tried the only item that I could afford and tada, the first(in the game I think) Flameless Lantern (gave it away) then two<br/>
failures. But all in all I made 3. They seem to be<br/>
at least as bright as Lightstone, possibly brighter, but being a Gnome, what do I need it for? :) But it&#39;s been done. Tinkering works. <br/>
Going to put in my order for Pie Tins and start<br/>
making Compasses. And as soon as I find a tattered<br/>
cloak, it&#39;s Thermal Cloak time. Man I need more money.<br/>
