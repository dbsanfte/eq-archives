<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-290343633">Today I was in freeport and talked to the gnome merchents in the Emporium<br/>
next to the bank in North Freeport named Svinal Wyspin.  I couldn&#39;t get any<br/>
information from him, but he does respond to a Hail (unlike most merchents)<br/>
and that usually means they have something to interact with.  He basically<br/>
said Welcome to the Emporium if we don&#39;t have what you want, we can get it.<br/>
Well I wish he could get me a tinkering book.  :)  Anyone ever get any other<br/>
information from him?  Is he involved in a quest?<br/>
