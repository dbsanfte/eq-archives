<b>Subject:</b> Question:Tinkering skill max? Yeah or Nay? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-800368479">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Ok I&#39;ve seen the posts where folks say we have a skill max of 5 x (level -15). As a 35th level wizzy that would put my skill max at 100.<br/>
<br/>
Are we SURE about this? Why do I see Master Fletchers with a skill of 200 that are lower level than I am? Is this max just a Tinker thing? <br/>
<br/>

Can someone confirm this for me? Its going to be hell getting thru 35, and it may be a while before I&#39;m 36 =( I would hate to think my tinkering is dependent on killing more lizzys in Cazic.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
