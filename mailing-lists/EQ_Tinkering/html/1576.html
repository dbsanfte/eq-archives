<div id="ygrps-yiv-706130082">Now I feel stupid roaming 4 hours waiting for Duster X to spawn. *sighs*  <br/>
How do I get this Duster Report to make him spawn? I already got Duster V.<br/>
<br/>
Thx<br/>

I can confrim this as I completed the duster quest last night and got the<br/>
Bootstrutters Pack (Isn&#39;t the Gnome who gives you the Jboots quest named<br/>
Bootstrutter?  Heh - anyone try giving him his pack back?  Just an idea).<br/>
<br/>
These junk items that you talk about - I&#39;ve never seen them before.<br/>
Gnomish Glow Rods?  Perhaps these are the rods needed for the thermal<br/>
cloak...  I just received a patchwork cloak after completing the Red V<br/>
quest - I&#39;ll try to do the Duster and scrap metal quests a few more times<br/>
to get these Rods and try a few combinations.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Duster V is still a rare spawn around the enterence.<br/>
 &gt; Duster X now only spawns once you turn in the report, he spawns down by<br/>
 &gt; the<br/>
 &gt; tinkering merchant, and doesnt wander anymore, he just stands in place.<br/>
 &gt; I did this quest once (and am waiting for Duster V to do it again) and<br/>
 &gt; got the<br/>
 &gt; Bootstrutters Pack, 10slot backpack with 10% weight reduction..<br/>
 &gt; A lot of the junk that you used to get for this quest (back when Dustre<br/>
 &gt; X was a<br/>
 &gt; wandering rare spawn) can now also be gotten by turning in scrap metal<br/>
 &gt; from<br/>
 &gt; rogues to Sanfryd Feathertop (who used to be called Sanfryd<br/>
 &gt; somethingelse).<br/>
 &gt; Amongst the normal lanterns/shield junk you can also get gnomish glow<br/>
 &gt; rods, and<br/>
 &gt; chunks of metal ore that look like balls instead of bricks...<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Getting the duster report seems to be less common than it used to be as<br/>
 &gt; well - I<br/>
 &gt; get the Red V report a lot more now, previously it was the other way<br/>
 &gt; around..<br/>
