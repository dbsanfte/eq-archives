<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084467143">In Oasis, the same gypsy camp that sells combine sells Compasses.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know exactly how to explain it, when you run at the camp from the<br/>
hunting point next to the water she is the one on the back left.  Bad<br/>
directions I know.  She sells them to me with 65 charisma for about 3.4<br/>
pp I would say.<br/>
<br/>
This is about the same price it costs me to make them.  Which means<br/>
tinkering a compass is a moot point.<br/>

&gt; Murrisa Sandwhisper in Northern Ro sells compasses<br/>
&gt; for about 2 plat.  The good<br/>
&gt; news is that killing Dervs hurts your faction with<br/>
&gt; her, so she won&#39;t deal with<br/>
&gt; most people in the area.  (Who hangs out in Ro and<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t kill Dervs?)  I<br/>
&gt; managed to sell a few in the Qeynos area for 4-5pp,<br/>
&gt; but haven&#39;t been tinkering<br/>
&gt; much since I&#39;m about as far away from my tinkering<br/>
&gt; supplies that I can get :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am by no means condoning price fixing, however,<br/>
&gt; i would like to know at<br/>
&gt; &gt; what price are you selling compasses.  It costs a<br/>
&gt; bit over 3pp to make (I<br/>
&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t failed yet..knock on wood).  I&#39;m currently<br/>
&gt; selling for 5 pp, most<br/>
&gt; &gt; people who want one have no problem paying the 5<br/>
&gt; pp.  I have found some<br/>
&gt; &gt; people who will only pay 4pp, to whom I tell to<br/>
&gt; come back to me when you<br/>
&gt; &gt; get a bit more frustrated hitting sense heading. <br/>
&gt; However, I do manage to<br/>
&gt; &gt; sell one, maybe two a day.  I here that you can<br/>
&gt; buy compasses from gypsies<br/>
&gt; &gt; in North Karana but I haven&#39;t made the trip to<br/>
&gt; check it out (last time I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was there i got mauled by a grif).  I also heard<br/>
&gt; you could get them in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kithicor forest but I went through all the shops<br/>
&gt; and didn&#39;t find any.  I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; go to the gypsies and check them out then head to<br/>
&gt; lavastorm to see if they<br/>
&gt; &gt; have them also.<br/>
