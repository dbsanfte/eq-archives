<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853707873">Anyone else heard that DEX is the # 1 roll check for skill successes?<br/>
Reading eq.castersrealm.com check the necro creation guide, and it states <br/>
this.   Anyone try anything with DEX?  I have a jeweling paladin and can get <br/>
his WIS up to 162/171 with gear and over 180 with buffs.  Havent tried DEX <br/>
although later tonight I intend on trying with a Shaman DEX buff to see if I <br/>
find a difference.<br/>
Let me know what yall think<br/>
