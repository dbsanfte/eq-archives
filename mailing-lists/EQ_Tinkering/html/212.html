<div id="ygrps-yiv-146286751">hmm, pretty sure Borxx&#39;s lens is one of them, you re supposed to get one<br/>
&quot;free&quot; (the one in LF I believe) than one is one the gnome taken<br/>
prisoner by Minotaurs, and one was stolen by a dark elf, and the only<br/>
other lens I have heard about is the Borxx lens (at least this is what<br/>
they respond when asked about spare lens&#39;s)<br/>
 Maybe I missed one, if so please tell me which one.<br/>

&gt; While I agree that Verant is sick & twisted, you are confusing two quests.  The Evil<br/>
&gt; Eye is part of the Observer Staff Quest and originates at an Observitory.  The<br/>
&gt; Telescope Lens Quest orignates in the Wizards? Guild and it requires you to get four<br/>
&gt; lenses.  None of them are on Borxx.  Two are given to you by the observitories.  One<br/>
&gt; is obtained by killing a 14ish (and nasty) DE in Freeport, and the last is on this<br/>
&gt; missing gnome.  Please also note that this quest will not be given to wizards above<br/>
&gt; level 12.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Believe it , verant has this sick and twisted thing about making quests<br/>
&gt; &gt; ungettable at higher levels, and impossible for low levels to actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; solve, for instance this quest. one of the lens you need tog et from<br/>
&gt; &gt; Borxx, a level *30*+ Evil Eye. With verants normal sense of rewards well<br/>
&gt; &gt; get 20 exp pts, a faction adjustment and a tarnished dagger as reward,<br/>
&gt; &gt; note this is a step up from the usual rusty dagger they give us.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  another example (again gnome) get tergons spellbook, OK this spawns on<br/>
&gt; &gt; a level 18 or so mob... your reward for solving the quest? a level 4<br/>
&gt; &gt; mage spell.<br/>
