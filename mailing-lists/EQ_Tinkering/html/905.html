<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-838491061">first off, I&#39;ve been on this mailing list for a long time, since issue 7 or <br/>
so. NOTHING on tis list is BS, so don&#39;t say it is. second thing. on a <br/>
website, EQ trading corner, I looked up matriels for tinkering, and it said <br/>
fishing pole, sold on two vendors.Was the person too lazy to write all the <br/>
places where you could find fishing poles, or do they know something we <br/>
don&#39;t? The vendors were someone on Kerra island/wisp island, in eruds <br/>
crossing i think, and someone with a ogrelike name in Lake Rathe or Rathe <br/>
Mountains(can&#39;t remember which). this is all speculating though. Last thing, <br/>
right now I&#39;m on aol(blagh) and I want to change to something else.Any ideas <br/>
on what I should get?</div>
