<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144700784">Hello Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Is Gimblestones book IX (the 3rd book of tinkering) in the game or not ?<br/>
<br/>
I have heard some folks say that it is, and other folks say that it was <br/>
taken out. There is a good chance that if it is in the game, that it <br/>
might contain the recipe for the scuba gear.<br/>
<br/>
So anyone with a clue tell me, is the 3rd book really in the game and the <br/>
general public just not found it yet? Or does it not even exist.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx,<br/>
<br/>
