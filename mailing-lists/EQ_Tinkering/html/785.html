<b>Subject:</b> Re: More clues from Lindell, third book confirmed, and more... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-619697021"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: &quot;Joshua Bednarz&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:thewhitemage@...">thewhitemage@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I talked to Lindell again. He doesn&#39;t seem to want to tell me out-right,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he was willing to tell me a little more, sort of. First of all, he<br/>
 </span></blockquote>confirmed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that the thing I was looking for truly WAS a third tinkering book. He also<br/>
&gt; said that to get it involed going under water. He also said that it was<br/>
&gt; somewhere you wouldn&#39;t expact it to be. He also said that is was NOT in<br/>
&gt; Ak&#39;Anon, that looking there was a waste of time. He also confirmed that it<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t is Kedge&#39;s Keep. He said that the person to first find it stummbled<br/>
&gt; upon it by luck, so if we are actually looking for it we should be able to<br/>
&gt; find it. Lindell also told me if I find the book, I can join The Mark.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sorry, I don&#39;t want to join those people, they are with holding info from<br/>
&gt; everyone else like that, so if I find it, I&#39;m gonigto let everyone know<br/>
&gt; about it, not join they&#39;re group. They want to keep it secret, but I have<br/>
&gt; absolutely NO affiliation to them, and don&#39;t want to keep it secrect, so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>why<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; would I want to join them? First of all, they won&#39;t let me join because<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not worthy to them, plus if they had their way, I, or no one else would<br/>
 </span></blockquote>find<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that book ever, and they would probably do anything in their power to stop<br/>
&gt; me from getting it, and they sort of have, but then, if I found it, since<br/>
&gt; they still want to keep it secret, they want me to join them, even after<br/>
&gt; what they&#39;ve acted like?! No way! I don&#39;t think so!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hahaha! Let&#39;s show them! Let&#39;s all re-double our efforts to find the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>book!!!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Come on, guys! Let&#39;s go get it! Good luck to you all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know this might be a little underhanded, but hey! Thats why i play a gnome<br/>
necro! Anybody ever try to pretend to sell these in the zone he was in? If<br/>
yeah did get some tells on buying it, just tell the person that yeah just<br/>
sold it. Might upset him enough, that he might let something slip out?<br/>
Another idea i had is the Reanimated Hand in unrest, he drops severals<br/>
books, a cooking book, and a wizard book, i got off him once that i sold to<br/>
the merchant for 12pp not bad, and i know there are a couple others, but was<br/>
just thinking the 3rd Tinkering book, might be a rare drop by the hand? Plus<br/>
is he really wants to keep it a secret, who&#39;s to say he is giving us the<br/>
correct clues, maybe info to throw us off the trail of finding it.<br/>
