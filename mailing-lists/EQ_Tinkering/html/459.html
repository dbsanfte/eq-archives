<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065774197"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&lt;Assumption&gt; Really only gnomes would be looking for this item. If it was <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;grobb or oggok (don&#39;t ask me why, but they put some necromacers spells <br/>
&gt;there)<br/>
&gt;then it is very unlikely that we would have found it.  If it was in neriak <br/>
&gt;then<br/>
&gt;really only Necromacers could have found it.  This would mean that our<br/>
&gt;enchanters would have to check these cities.  There are also vendors all <br/>
&gt;over.<br/>
&gt;A gnome, on this list, would have to hit one of these vendors and then <br/>
&gt;scroll<br/>
&gt;down enough to see the pole if it was there.  It definitely could be out <br/>
&gt;there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;FACT&gt; I play a dark elf and regularly frequent Ogguk, Grobb, and Neriak. I <br/>
have not seen either the collapseable fishing pole or the spyglass, and I <br/>
HAVE looked everywhere within those cities (I was looking for them out of <br/>
curiosity to if owning them would benefit me). I even went as far as <br/>
creating mules, as well as having high level friends of the appropriate <br/>
races search within those cities, and NONE of them have seen one yet. Come <br/>
to think of it, I&#39;ve never seen either on ANY merchant with ANY of my <br/>
characters - and I&#39;ve been to all but the high level dungeons (haven&#39;t been <br/>
to: Lower Guk; Plane of Fear; Plane of Hate; Plane of Air; Sol A and B; <br/>
Kedge Keep; the tunnel/cave under Lake Rathetear; the tunnel/cave under the <br/>
ice in Everfrost; Spectre Isle in Oasis - not sure if it&#39;s a zone though; <br/>
hidden underwater dungeon in Ocean of Tears - if it exists; tunnels/caves <br/>
beneath Neriak - if they exist)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;ASSUMPTION/CONJECTURE&gt; No one to date has yet to discover the recipe, (and <br/>
judging by the ton of email about what has failed, and the sheer numbers of <br/>
players working collectively) then it would ONLY make sense to me, that <br/>
they&#39;re found on certain rare spawns or given as loot for quest completion. <br/>
Hence, it would only be natural that the one person who supposively <br/>
discovered the secret of which we all search, has merely found WHICH spawn <br/>
or WHICH quest. However, and I do stress however, it may even possibly be <br/>
WHICH correct recipe that may have previously not worked.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;FACT&gt; Verant has added in new NPC&#39;s and new quests; not to mention having <br/>
fixed recipes and quests that had previously been broken. Judging from past <br/>
personal experiences, I would say that we have more questions than answers, <br/>
and at this point, we can only conjecture. My best guess/suggestion at this <br/>
point, would be to email/petition the GM in charge of the trade skills, <br/>
about a hint or two or perhaps a spoiler like us Master Brewers got. After <br/>
all, they leaked out the recipe for bog juice, (and just recently Vodka) <br/>
because no one could figure out the recipe. And we Master Brewers didn&#39;t <br/>
have a quarter of the collective effort that I see coordinating here.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two coppers worth</div>
