<b>Subject:</b> Tinkering is &quot;worth it&quot; <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576479699"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I went ahead and talked to a gm and a bunch of higher level gnomes.  From<br/>
&gt; the high levels gnomes I got the impression that tinkering was a complete<br/>
&gt; and total waste of time.  In fact one told me he didn&#39;t do it because the<br/>
&gt; skill sucked and it wasn&#39;t worth it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Since when were ANY of the trade skills &quot;worth it?&quot; I don&#39;t think what<br/>
drives people to learn skills have anything to do with making money (at<br/>
least not since they nerfed pottery) it&#39;s some other sense of expanding<br/>
their character. No one makes any money on any of the skills and yet<br/>
people still do them for several reasons. In fact my character right now<br/>
is working on baking, tailoring, blacksmithing, and jewlcraft.  I&#39;m<br/>
losing lots of money but I&#39;m having a great time. When I reach 16, you<br/>
better believe I&#39;m going to work my tinkering. Just because I can.  So<br/>
don&#39;t try and tell me that tinkering isn&#39;t &quot;worth it.&quot;<br/>
