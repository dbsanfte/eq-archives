<div id="ygrps-yiv-826815083">My faction with Bom Knotwood (tinkering vendor) is apprehensive. This is not so good since I buy a lot from him. I don&#39;t know how it got there, but do any of you know how I can fix this faction? All of the vendors in Ak&#39;Anon are apprehensive to me.<br/>
 Oh, and congrats Fizzwizz for making a rebreather, what is your skill and how many tries did it take you?<br/>
