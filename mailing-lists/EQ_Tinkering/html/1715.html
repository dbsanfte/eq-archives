<b>Subject:</b> Diamond Dust..... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-780161050">OK don&#39;t get to excited but I have been asked by a fellow gnome to make<br/>
the gemcutter. He claims he can get the diamond dust for me, but won&#39;t<br/>
give up the npc that drops it. He claims that the npc is 50th level and <br/>
that the diamond dust is a rare drop item off it. I am thinking that this<br/>
could mean that the npc may be in the planes but that is merley speculation.<br/>
I wish he would give up the info but he is keeping it hidden from all for<br/>
another gnome. Well i hope this gives all you tinkerers hope:) Has anyone <br/>
discovered what the formula is for the Thermal Cloak? Where can i aquire <br/>
tattered belts? Are they merely patchwork belts or are they actually called<br/>
Tattered belts? <br/>
