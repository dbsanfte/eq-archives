<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849708018">Oh yeah, we gotta have a monthly Gnomestock!<br/>
<br/>
I say we throw the first one on Bertoxx since there are a lot of gnomes on<br/>
this list and on that server and it is the first server alphabetically<br/>
anyways.<br/>
<br/>
And I agree the date should be easy to remember so I vote for the First of<br/>
every month.  That way people who have something else they should be doing<br/>
on Saturdays (I am not sure what that would be but I&#39;ve heard that there are<br/>
people who do something other that work and play EQ) will be able to make<br/>
it.  Plus, that is closer than the first Saturday of November.<br/>
<br/>
I know nothing about organizing an event on EQ but I am willing to help out<br/>
anyway I can.<br/>
