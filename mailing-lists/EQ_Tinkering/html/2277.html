<div id="ygrps-yiv-359454866">I&#39;ve had the exact same problems. I&#39;m stranded at 104 and just cannot keep up <br/>
with the amount it takes to get steady skill imps. In my rush to level I <br/>
don&#39;t have time to stop somewhere and just farm cash, it takes too much <br/>
money, if they don&#39;t implement a cheaper way raise skills, I&#39;m gonna have to <br/>
schedule a meeting with my foot and and the trade skill prgrammers balls. I <br/>
don&#39;t know about all of yall, but it&#39;s a little frustrating trying to raise <br/>
skill this way.</div>
