<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-624939730"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Also, I heard there&#39;s a sunken ship somewhere possibly within the OOT or<br/>
&gt;Erud&#39;s Crossing that is it&#39;s own zone. Perhaps one of these suggestions is<br/>
&gt;what we seek?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again - I based all this off of various rumors I heard and pieced together,<br/>
&gt;plus the clue &quot;search under the waves&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They can&#39;t possibly be their own zones.  Check your eq directory.. All the <br/>
zones are listed there, period.  If it ain&#39;t there, it ain&#39;t a zone.</div>
