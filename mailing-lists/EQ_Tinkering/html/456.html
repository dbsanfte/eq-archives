<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795982513">Minor Correction here.  The Glowing Stien was NOT part of the game until less than<br/>
1 week before the spoiler went up.  It was the reward for the Brewers Compendium<br/>
Quest.  The quest, until recently, was broken.  It returned Pungala&#39;s head (Ogre<br/>
Head), not the compendium.  Many bartender&#39;s have tried this quest, and it was a<br/>
bartender who first completed it.   On a side note,  GM&#39;s informed several players<br/>
that the quest indeed worked, before the patch.  They then came back and said it<br/>
will be fixed in an up coming patch (Another Lie)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thought #5:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is no such thing as a &quot;secret&quot; on Everquest.  There are too many<br/>
&gt; &gt; people playing the game, making any new discovery part of the common<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowledge base within a few weeks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;Fact&gt; This is pretty true for the most part, but the glowing stein was a part<br/>
&gt; of the game from beta on, and it wasn&#39;t until 2 or 3 weeks ago that this became<br/>
&gt; common knowledge.  Verant also reports that less than 50% of the total different<br/>
&gt; items in the game have been found.<br/>
