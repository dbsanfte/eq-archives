<div id="ygrps-yiv-306679988">Bow Cams you&#39;ll want to sell to boyers, and there arent a lot of those (at<br/>
least I&#39;ve never sold many).  They&#39;re a fairly hard item to push.  Fireworks<br/>
I personally give away to gain a client base... people generally remember<br/>
them and will ask you what other toys you have, and this is where I show<br/>
them the stalking probe.  Since you&#39;re a gnome you start out such that many<br/>
items are already trivial (fishpole, fireworks, ect), and stalking probes<br/>
can recompense &lt;some&gt; of your money, but dont expect to sell many.  They&#39;re<br/>
toys for rich people, which in essence is what all tinkered items are.  Its<br/>
too bad that we cant get any items that everyone WANTS to have, like<br/>
virtually every other trade (platinum ruby vail, vodka, trushot longbow,<br/>
handmade backpack, ect).... the rebreather hardly qualifies. A good fellow<br/>
gnome named Yugi I often see selling telescopes for 100 plat per pop... he<br/>
tells me this is working fine for him, and anyone that says &#39;thats too much&#39;<br/>
he tells them simply that it is a toy for those who can afford it, and those<br/>
that cannot can do without.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&quot;m to generous with my tinkered items... I find them so<br/>
wonderful I have to give them to all my friends!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; First off I want to say how great it is that there ARE other gnomes out<br/>
&gt; there who take such an avid interest in one of the few things that set us<br/>
&gt; apart in Gnorrath.  Having followed your adventures and attempts at<br/>
&gt; discovering the lost knowledge of tinkering has kept me going...and now I<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; ready to start working as well.<br/>
&gt; A few questions though....<br/>
&gt; I already know what to make as I progress, but I&#39;m curious...how do you<br/>
sell<br/>
&gt; the items you make (ie fireworks, cams, etc?)  I really doubt anyone would<br/>
&gt; buy a flameless lantern, and I don&#39;t blame them, but what about other<br/>
items?<br/>
&gt; I have successfully made some cams and can&#39;t seem to sell them.  Nor<br/>
&gt; fireworks, which I have heard are a hit...which makes me feel useless<br/>
since<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t get rid of them.<br/>
&gt; Any advice would be appreciated, and since I don&#39;t know of any other<br/>
gnomes<br/>
&gt; tinkering on my world this was the only place I knew to ask.  Of course,<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; there is another one out there that&#39;d be great...<br/>
