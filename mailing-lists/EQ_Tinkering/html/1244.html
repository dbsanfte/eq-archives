<b>Subject:</b> Um.. Aqualungs wont sell for 300pp <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496229792">I dont know about you guys, but if an item costs in components alone - 225pp<br/>
(or so). And I&#39;m not trivial in making it. There is no WAY I could make <br/>
any profit selling it at 300pp.  In fact, that means you have a success rate<br/>
of 75% JUST to break even!<br/>
<br/>
Does my tinkering suck? Are you guys making 3 successes out of 4 tries on very <br/>
non-trivial stuff? Or even better assuming your profitable?<br/>
<br/>
I have found I need to charge 2.5x on non-trivial to make any profit. Thats <br/>
560pp, not 300pp. Sorry, I&#39;m still not too impressed with Aqualungs -<br/>
especially at that price.</div>
