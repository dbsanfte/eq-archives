<div id="ygrps-yiv-596048265">Heya guys,<br/>
<br/>
Like i said quite a while ago, the gnome named Salvadori on Xegony is the<br/>
one that has learned the secret of how to make the collapsable fishing pole,<br/>
but is not willing to share the recipe.  He&#39;s only one who can make them<br/>
that I know of.  Just a reminder of that info for those of you that weren&#39;t<br/>
on the board, or who don&#39;t remember.  Also, yes, he is not on very often<br/>
anymore.<br/>

&gt; I went ahead and talked to a gm and a bunch of higher level gnomes.  From<br/>
&gt; the high levels gnomes I got the impression that tinkering was a complete<br/>
&gt; and total waste of time.  In fact one told me he didn&#39;t do it because the<br/>
&gt; skill sucked and it wasn&#39;t worth it.  I did get a name from a high level<br/>
&gt; gnome who said he knew someone who used to tinker a lot.  He said the guys<br/>
&gt; name was salvadori or something like that and that he rarely came on.  He<br/>
&gt; does however come on every once in a while.  The other thing that I found<br/>
&gt; out, from the gm&#39;s, was that the skill is not broken.  I asked every gm<br/>
