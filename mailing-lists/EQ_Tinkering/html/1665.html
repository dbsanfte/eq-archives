<b>Subject:</b> Skill cap.. damnit <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-15180091">Okay. PLEASE don&#39;t take this as a restart of the WHAT IS THE SKILL CAP <br/>
argument. But rather a suggestion. I&#39;m a level 20 Gnome Mage and have been <br/>
actively tinkering for months now.. even before I hit level 16. I was <br/>
eagerly awaiting the day that I hit 16 and could raise my &quot;tinkering skill&quot; <br/>
with training. Heck I even saved up 25 points for that sole purpose. Well, <br/>
I hit level 16 and CAN&#39;T train in the skill. Sooo... I have spent the last <br/>
4 levels trying to get SOME kind of skill improvement. And so far to date I <br/>
have only gotten my Tinkering to raise from 50 to 53. I have spent and <br/>
BURNED atleast 500 to 600 Platinum Pieces trying to get my skill to <br/>
improve. I tried everything from Flameless Lanterns to Spyglasses. If I got <br/>
a success, I tried to sell it for some kind of profit and put that same <br/>
money right back into tinkering.<br/>
<br/>
Well, to make a long story short. I have burned WAY too much money and am <br/>
TIRED of this nonsense. Shamans have Alchemy (which granted can be more <br/>
expensive even than tinkering), and there was a recent addition for shamans <br/>
to be able to put training points into Alchemy.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT ABOUT TINKERING?!?!?<br/>
<br/>
I say we start a write in campaign of e-mail,  or a petition.. or SOMETHING <br/>
to let Verant know that we Gnomes are tired of wasting needless amounts of <br/>
cash to raise a skill that we can not train in... plus making things worse <br/>
it being the MOST expensive trade skill in EQ. Something needs to be done <br/>
about this.<br/>
