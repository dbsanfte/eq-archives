<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545147055">Another thought (just as expensive), perhaps you put the diamond in the<br/>
toolkit by itself (or with something else), you can reduce it to diamond<br/>
dust.  I&#39;d hope something like that would be trivial at all levels (like<br/>
silk swatches from silk).  I mean, if you failed what would it produce (err,<br/>
carbon filings?).<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s more likely that the dust just isn&#39;t in the game yet.<br/>

Just a really expensive thought, but has anyone tried using a diamond?<br/>
Maybe it gets turned to dust in the process.  Its probably off base but with<br/>
so much searching and no finding you have to wonder.</div>
