<br/>
&lt;&lt; Must be in the room where the dwarf, wood elf, and other two gnomes show <br/>
up.<br/>
 Do you know if they were able to talk to Bidl to get the lens or had to <br/>
 kill him or something.<br/>
 What about the other observatories?  Any information on those?<br/>

that are there and let new ones spawn in their place.     You should be able <br/>
to hail him.   Or give him a copper and see if he tells you anything like he <br/>
needs keys or anything like that.</div>
