<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345657596">If you buy enough you will probably find that they run out, because<br/>
a player character sold them to the merchent, but if that person makes as<br/>
many as a potter friend of mine you&#39;ll spend a fortune first.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
done much of any tinkering, has anyone found an item that can turn a profit<br/>
when sold to merchants?</div>
