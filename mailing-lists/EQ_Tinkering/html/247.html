<b>Subject:</b> I know how to get three of the lenses. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084752176">Yes, you do in fact haev to kill the gnomes that tell you to come back in a <br/>
few weeks. I read on a site that that someone got three of the lenses one <br/>
fron the dark elf and two from killing the gnomes that tell you to come back <br/>
in a few weeks. This is only what he said, so it looks like we will have to <br/>
kill some of our own brethren to get the quest done. But it&#39;s still that one <br/>
last lens thats missing. I also heard that someone saw Bidl Frugrin in the <br/>
clutches of the evil Erudites in thier palace. I&#39;m going to check it out <br/>
soon and make a new character and see.</div>
