<div id="ygrps-yiv-816363359">The library is the mage/enchanter/wizard guild.  It used to be the<br/>
necromancer guild as well but it was getting rediculously crowded so they<br/>
moved the necros down to the mines of malfunction.  As you go up the ramp to<br/>
the guild, stop at the top and look at it.  There is actually a sign that<br/>
says &quot;Library Mechamagica&quot; above the door.<br/>
<br/>
The secret wall is the only corner that does not have a (visible) area for a<br/>
specific guild.  Since there are obvious areas for mages, wizards, and<br/>
enchanters, just walk through the one remaining wall that isn&#39;t taken up.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly that secret isn&#39;t nearly so perplexing as the location of the rogue<br/>
guild.  I had to start a newbie wood elf ranger to track the guildmaster<br/>
before I could find it.<br/>

There&#39;s a wall you can walk through in the Library??  Where in the Library?<br/>
I could have sworn that was one of the many places I searched extensively in<br/>
the past looking for secrets.  :)</div>
