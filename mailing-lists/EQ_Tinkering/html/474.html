<b>Subject:</b> I doubt there is a reel <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399242433">Just my 2c worth, but I seriously doubt there is a reel of any sort in the<br/>
formula.  Considering the level of technology we are dealing with, a fishing<br/>
pole was little more then a stick with a string tied at the end and a hook<br/>
at the end of the string.<br/>
<br/>
That brings up a rather interesting thought, though - a hook.  Probably not<br/>
likely, but might be worth trying if something can be used as a hook or if<br/>
there is something from which a hook can be made.<br/>
