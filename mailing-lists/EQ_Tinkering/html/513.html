<b>Subject:</b> Idea for fishing pole and slightly stupid idea <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381350534">First off, I was playing with my ranger earlier today and just had a quick<br/>
thought, has anyone tried using drawven wire to make the pole?  Second of<br/>
all, i&#39;ve decided to take a slightly more offensive approach then most.<br/>
I&#39;m taking my high level character and am going to start killing off NPC&#39;s<br/>
in and around steamfront.  I was think of the Zoo keeper, and that guy<br/>
beside the person who sells tinkering components (the one with the pet<br/>
spider).  Any other suggestions as to who should die?</div>
