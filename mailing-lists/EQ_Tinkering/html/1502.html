&gt;Have been upgraded in the latest patch<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you have no target they operate much like a colored version of the <br/>
&gt;magicians<br/>
&gt;flare spell - shooting straight outwards as a lightsource until they hit<br/>
&gt;terrain.<br/>
&gt;Except for the blue one (can&#39;t remember which number), which does a little<br/>
&gt;circle/spiral. If you have someone targeted when you let them off you see a<br/>
&gt;message &quot;&lt;Target&gt; lights a firework&quot;, though it always explodes around <br/>
&gt;you, in a<br/>
&gt;shower of sparks, and it makes an explosion type sound.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I /bugged the fact that they still look like they have a charge after you use<br/>
&gt;them though.<br/>
