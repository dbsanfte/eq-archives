<div id="ygrps-yiv-450050157">While I think you are correct about the previous post being full of crap,<br/>
you can tell what weapon a mob has without there being a graphic by reading<br/>
the damage messages, (a kobold pierces you, a kobold hits you, a kobold<br/>
slashes you...etc.)<br/>

&gt; ok, this isn&#39;t a bash on anyone, but ready this guys posts just makes me<br/>
&gt; laugh, he appears to have all this knowledge about tinkering and the pets<br/>
&gt; then the next post he says &quot;charmed the executioner cuz he had an<br/>
&gt; axe&quot; ? i<br/>
&gt; dont&#39; think so, first of all you can&#39;t charm if you have a<br/>
&gt; pet/animation, or<br/>
&gt; ppl could make multiple animations, and secondly the ghoul exec has no<br/>
&gt; animation for when he holds the axe.  so you couldn&#39;t possible have seen<br/>
&gt; it...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; you just lost all your credibility man<br/>
