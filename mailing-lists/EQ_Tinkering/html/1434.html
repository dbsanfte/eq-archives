<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463395598">My skill is at 125 has cost me over 30k to get there and the aqualung is<br/>
still not trivial. Fail rate is at 30% on them at that skill. The<br/>
rebreather has a fail rate of 60% at that lvl. <br/>
<br/>
Wisdom does play a factor in fail rate. my Int is 200 and wisdom is at 145<br/>
with my buffs.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps ya<br/>

&gt; I sympathize with ya, Surastik...<br/>
&gt; 	I started tinkering recently, and after investing around 3000PP I got up to<br/>
&gt; 104 skill.  So I went on to aqualungs.  10 attempts produced 2 aqualungs.<br/>
&gt; No skill raises.  I had a Intel of 167, Wis of 137 and bought the items with<br/>
&gt; 131 charisma (best price possible for my faction).  At this point I am<br/>
&gt; doubting Wisdom has much to do with successful creations.  Am I haven&#39;t bad<br/>
&gt; luck here?  Or is a 80% failure rate common?  I can&#39;t even imagine trying a<br/>
&gt; rebreather at this rate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am wondering if we need to find a item that has better success rate than<br/>
&gt; aqualungs to get skill higher.  But seems to be none to help with this.  Is<br/>
&gt; anyone out there over 110 skill yet?  If so, give us some insight on costs<br/>
&gt; and failure ratings.  At this rate, I need to sell aqualungs for thousands<br/>
&gt; of PP rather than hundreds.<br/>

&gt; Although this is my first post to this list, ive been reading em everyday<br/>
&gt; for the last few weeks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I too am an aspiring tinkerer (skill 106) and I have successfully made Lungs<br/>
&gt; and Rebreathers alike.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well tonight, after a week of work, I took my 4000pp and went to make some<br/>
&gt; lungs.  Out of 10 attempts,<br/>
&gt; i succeeded on 4 of em.  I then attempted to make 4 Rebreathers... Failure<br/>
&gt; on all four...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another 4000pp gone and not ONE point of skill advancement.  Int is 182, wis<br/>
&gt; is 100, lvl 50 character.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If any of you have any tips for me, let me know, im very close to just<br/>
&gt; giving the damn skill up, ive got over<br/>
&gt; 13K pp invested into it and im quite frustrated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>

&gt; P.S.  Have we just given up on the Diamond dust?  I for one am still looking<br/>
&gt; everywhere that i can and one<br/>
&gt; thing&#39;s for sure, Faeries DON&#39;T drop it.  I&#39;ve killed about 1000 faeries,<br/>
&gt; maidens, guards, royal guards and the like. not one diamond dust drop/<br/>
