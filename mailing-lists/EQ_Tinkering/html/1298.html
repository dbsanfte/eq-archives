<div id="ygrps-yiv-565612635">Well this is my 2nd attempt at this message list.  For one thing, why they <br/>
heck isn&#39;t a NORMAL message board being used instead of this current method<br/>
of posting?<br/>
<br/>
My other question is, how do you fire the firworks once they are made?<br/>
<br/>
Although I doubt this message will get out, as it said I was subscribed<br/>
to onelist before, but gives an error when I try to post.  Very annonying<br/>
way to post messages.</div>
