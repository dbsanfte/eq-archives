<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122866523">my simple point is that there IS no market for a charged item that costs 1k. <br/>
my pricing is my choice, yes it is undercutting the competition...but then <br/>
again there really wasnt any competition to begin with aside from a <br/>
guildmate, whom, as it turned out is more interested in jewelry than <br/>
tinkering, and therefore told all his customers to come to me for tinkered <br/>
stuff such as Lungs.(before i set my price)  My guild has discussed this <br/>
issue a lot...everyone sides with me in fact.  Nobody is even willing to pay <br/>
600 for these Lungs...i get tells all the time about it. sure, there are <br/>
those lvl 50 ppl out tehre who WILL pay more $ for em...but they are the <br/>
minority.  HOW do you expect to raise your skill in tinkering if you cannot <br/>
sell your products to make more cash to tinker more to...yada yada <br/>
yada....endless cycle of cash flow. i sold 2 more lungs last night, and <br/>
brought my skill pt up one more time(YAY!).  i have sold 17 total Lungs and <br/>
have 5 ppl waiting for me to find the time to craft theirs.  last night i <br/>
did something that i would like to share with all of you...<br/>
i heard a KK raid was about to occur so, what did i do? i went to KK.<br/>
that little trip added 2 more ppl to the list, and about 10 others said the <br/>
usual &quot;when ya get to rebreathers i&#39;ll buy one.&quot; money in the bag. i did <br/>
adjust my price tag after some careful consideration...but not greatly...and <br/>
i adjusted my &quot;throw in deals&quot; to compensate.  buisness is booming...and if <br/>
this keeps up, you should see me screaming &quot;LUNGS ARE TRIVIAL&quot; in a <br/>
relatively short amount of time :)<br/>
even with an int of 195 it takes me maybe 1500 plat to raise one skill. <br/>
anyone having any better luck than this?<br/>

hands with this trade)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;Not if that bracelet cost you $75-80 to make.. Your analogy bears no <br/>
&gt;&gt;resemblance<br/>
&gt;to the market, high level people arenn&#39;t going to balk at paying 1000pp, <br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt;is exactly what these &quot;idiots&quot; as you call them have been saying, people <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;buying them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ruthless price undercutting leads to stagnation of the market - look at<br/>
&gt;blacksmithing, the first people to start selling banded armor make quite a <br/>
&gt;good<br/>
&gt;profit, but eventually so many people get onto the market that you get <br/>
&gt;abused by<br/>
&gt;your customers if you ask anything apart from slightly above cost price, as<br/>
&gt;though they&#39;re doing you a favor by buying your product, instead of the <br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt;way around  - people like this I just tell &quot;Go buy chainmail from a vendor<br/>
&gt;then&quot;.  People complain about the Jewelley market&#39;s &quot;price fixing&quot;, but I<br/>
&gt;believe that it&#39;s helped the market more than hurt it, becasue it makes it<br/>
&gt;worthwhile for other people to invest in getting their jewellery skills up <br/>
&gt;-<br/>
&gt;rather than spending hundreds of plat to get your skill up, and find that <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;can only make items for your guild/friends becasue ruthless competition has <br/>
&gt;made<br/>
&gt;it near unprofitable to sell to anyone else. </span></blockquote></div>
