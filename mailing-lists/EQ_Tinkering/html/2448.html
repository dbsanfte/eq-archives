<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032376275">This is ridiculous and hopefully an oversight.<br/>
<br/>
Having a trade skill produce items with a level limitation is of<br/>
questionable logic at best, but a telescopic eyepatch???  The spyglass is<br/>
usable by all, my level 2 gnome paladin, err cleric, had one for some time.<br/>
Hopefully that has not been changed as well, but either way it is silly.<br/>
