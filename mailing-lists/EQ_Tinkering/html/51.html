&gt;     No, the lens quest he refers to, and the lens quest for the Observer staff is different. The observer staff quest is given out at the observatory North of the Windmills, where as the other lens quest is given by the observitory by Akanon. And just for the record the Obeserver staff is NOT the best staff in the game for mage classes.. The Staff of Writhing is much better+ACE- It casts random chaotic feedbacks... and its has some nice +- stats too. Cant remember them all exacly. Ill look next time i log on. I havnt been playing much lately...<br/>

First they are two different styles of weapon but the Observer staff is much more deadly, not in melee power but at level 30 (or thereabouts) when you can get either staff the Observer staff adds 60 mana with bonus mana and bonus intelligence and it only goes up with levels. Just one more thing personally I would rather carry a Black Tome with Silver Runes and a Glowing Black Stone at that level......<br/>

That would be around 120 extra mana at level 30. I will let the tanks hit, I rather have a few &quot;roots&quot; left in me then rather to be able to hope to get good shot in with mobs that hit for 100 points of dmg.</div>
