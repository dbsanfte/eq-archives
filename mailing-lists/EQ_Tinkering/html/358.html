<div id="ygrps-yiv-600865048">oops...yer right...i was doin permutations...shoulda been divide instead o&#39; <br/>
subtract...did it right on the calculator at least :)<br/>
but since we can repeat items, i seem to recall that we don&#39;t want <br/>
combinations or permutations...<br/>
any slot could have any of the 13 items, regardless of the other slots, so <br/>
we get the slightly less nice number of 13^8=815,730,721<br/>
or if we assume, as some have suggested, that it worked with the old 4 slot <br/>
toolbox, 13^4=28561 possibilities<br/>
that sound right to those with more recent education or more convenient <br/>
reference materials?<br/>

&gt;&quot;I knew that I kept this thing around for some reason.  *grin*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They are unorderd (it doesn&#39;t matter which slot you place that rat ear at), <br/>
&gt;so, they are combinations. Way to go Xillitil.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Formula:  nCr = n!/[r!(n-r)!]<br/>
&gt;     n = items we have to play with (12 here - we think)<br/>
&gt;     r = the set (8 spots in this case)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But an empty slot counts as an item too, so we need to count an additional <br/>
&gt;one for our number of items.<br/>
&gt;         13C8    = 13!/[8!(13-8)!]<br/>
&gt;                     =    6,227,020,800 / [40,320(120)]<br/>
&gt;                     =    6,227,020,800 / [4,838,400]<br/>
&gt;                     =    1,287<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As you can tell, my professors were big fans of &#39;Show Your Work&#39;.  *grins*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But, at least it isn&#39;t some way the heck out there number - thank goodness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh, other factors too, that will decrease our combinations.  We know that <br/>
&gt;certain items are not useable.  ie.  We know it will take more than one <br/>
&gt;metal rod (or any other given item).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m currently working on all listing all those darn combinations.  Eww...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It shall be ours soon.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello everyone on this list.  I&#39;m new to the list, just signed up today. <br/>
&gt;  Anyway this is a question for any mathematic wizards out there.  We have <br/>
&gt;a total of 8 slots in the toolbox and a total of 12 items to use.  Does <br/>
&gt;anyone know how many combinations that we can come up with?  Remember that <br/>
&gt;this includes just having 1 item in the box or 2 or 3 etc. etc.  Well me <br/>
&gt;personally I would just like to know for curiousity sake.  And don&#39;t worry <br/>
&gt;you now have another helping hand in the search for the collapsable fishing <br/>
&gt;pole recipie. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mike<br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S. If we do find it imagine how much it can sell for. :) $$$$$$$$<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; uhh...if i remember my math right,8 slots and 13 items(including empty)<br/>
&gt; &gt; should be 13! - 5!...ummm...51,891,840 combinations...or is that<br/>
&gt; &gt; permutations...and thats assuming we don&#39;t use anything less obvious <br/>
&gt;like<br/>
&gt; &gt; skins or something...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; guess we won&#39;t be doing an exhaustive search anytime soon....<br/>
