<b>Subject:</b> Re: Need to find Diamond Dust!! Plz Help! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640420516"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I got a Diamond today from plane of hate but no dust, maybe a diamond would<br/>
&gt;work?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; Where is Diamond Dust found? i am stuck at 102 skill and find it hard to<br/>
&gt;&gt; believe that the aqua lung is the next step up from probes. i also<br/>
&gt;attempted<br/>
&gt;&gt; a lung at skill 102...failed.<br/>
&gt;&gt; somoe else posted that they believe the gem cutter is the next step<br/>
&gt;&gt; item..and i must say i agree with this, if only we could find the diamond<br/>
&gt;&gt; dust...<br/>
&gt;&gt; so please, anyone who might know this information, please post it here so<br/>
&gt;&gt; that your fellow gnomes can trudge on through the skill in the hopes of<br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt;&gt; day tinkering a rebreather that is &quot;trivial.&quot; thx.<br/>

are indifferent to everyone as they are quest ogres for making some of the<br/>
special metals for the quests.  I think I remembe one of them saying that<br/>
they can crush stuff.<br/>
Personally I would not want to waste a diamond.  Those things are kinda<br/>
rare and expensive.  But you may want to check this out if your interested.<br/>
