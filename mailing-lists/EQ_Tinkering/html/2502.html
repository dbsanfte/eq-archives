<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102075">Thank you, i knew it wouldnt be easy but what about that breather <br/>
thing. isnt that possible to use by others. and various other <br/>
trinkets. is it really a sinking hole or is it possible to make money <br/>
at some later date say at level 100 or so. Is it a bad idea to start <br/>
right away. im only at level 3.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi there, just joined. I have a young Negromancer Gnome on Karana <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; I would like to know how to be a successful Tinker. For instance <br/>
what<br/>
&gt; is the most easier thing to make that does not have a high failier<br/>
&gt; rate for a beginner. Where can I find the best recipes and such and <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; list of Trivials.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance Stina. </span></blockquote></div>
