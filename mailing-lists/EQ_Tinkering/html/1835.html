<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216267083">Ok has anyone gone out and tryed this yet? I belive you have to go to Halas<br/>
and buy the dufrenite then take it to Rathe and have it crushed, after that<br/>
head home and try to get the components for the gemchopper together and<br/>
make it. As for the tattered gnomish cloak, well you have me. I belive that<br/>
it may possibly be a tattered small cloak you have to use, and without a belt<br/>
because it is not in caps like all the other components in gimblestans book. <br/>
However this is just a suggestion and i am not certain that it will work. As<br/>
to where to find the tattered small cloak, well um... i don&#39;t know. Ask around<br/>
I am told it exists somewhere.<br/>
