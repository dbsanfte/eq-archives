<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866182026">It is very very tedious. You have to make a whole bunch of Flameless Lanterns which will get you up to 68, then Cams or Spyglasses will get you to 70. But don&#39;t even bother trying to raise skill in tinkering if you are not level 26 or above because you will not raise a single point. There is a level cap on tinkering, I hope it&#39;s a bug but nonetheless, there is a cap. The formula for the cap is 5x(your level-15). This means that if you are not level 26 or above you can&#39;t get any skill raise. I wish you luck friend.<br/>

      I am a 29 gnome Wiz, I cannot seem to get my tinkering skill above 70, does anyone know why? I have spent so much money on tinkering now and my skill is 70, but even after I got to 70 skill I have made 30 spyglasses and 24 cams, no skill gain. Is there some kind of level cap?<br/>
