<div id="ygrps-yiv-101094443">With all the combinations that we have tried, perhaps the collapsable fishing pole *IS* in a shop somewhere. The graphic is the same one used for a regular fishing pole, I could see how it would easily be over looked.<br/>
<br/>
Lets shift gears and start hunting, put up where you have looked on the board and we will scout the planet for this sucker...<br/>
