&gt;<br/>
&gt;     While doing pottery in Kelethin, I got aware of the merchant selling<br/>
&gt;pottery sketches also sold something called &quot;Gnome templates&quot;, &quot;Barbarian<br/>
&gt;     templates&quot; and a couple more I think. What is this? Anyone?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uhm, I think those templates make those items you need to make those <br/>
adorable cookies, or something.  It is a bakery thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     In The Oasis of Marr I saw the gypsies were selling &quot;A ball of clay&quot;. <br/>
&gt;Is<br/>
&gt;this for pottery? (It could be that my memory betrays me, and that those<br/>
&gt;     clayballs were sold in &quot;The Emporium&quot; in FP, not sure).<br/>
&gt;     Anyway, if you have the answer, or facts on any of these subjects, <br/>
&gt;please<br/>
&gt;reply here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ball of clay?  No idea, but I would imagine its just more pottery stuff.</div>
