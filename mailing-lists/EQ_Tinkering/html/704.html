<div id="ygrps-yiv-993201661">Only 18 tries? ;P  I agree though, the improvement rate is messed up and if<br/>
anyone is thinking of starting the skill with hopes of high profits and<br/>
useful items, they are in for a bit of a disappointment, lol.  Cams give a<br/>
decent profit but don&#39;t expect them to give back all or even part of the<br/>
plat you put into the skill.  The spyglass is actually a fairly &#39;good&#39;<br/>
item, but for a NON-MAGIC class.  An unlimted charges magic item is just<br/>
fun to have, even if the efect isn&#39;t that great.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with tinkering is that if you want to merchant your items to<br/>
PCs, there is a very, very limited market for every item.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line tinkering is more of an &#39;adds flavor&#39; skill than anything else.<br/>
 Myself and a few others on this list I know took up this skill because we<br/>
simply got sick of monster killing, had a chunk of plat sitting in the bank<br/>
and said &#39;hey, since nobody else has tried this skill let&#39;s see if we can<br/>
figure it out.&#39;  Well, as we&#39;ve found out, the skill isn&#39;t worth it<br/>
profit-wise, and that as you said Verant doesn&#39;t care or even know anything<br/>
about the skill for that matter.  In any case, its still fun to work on now<br/>
and again and search for the missing item/books, but yep it does get old<br/>
after awhile, too.<br/>

&gt;Well so I am level 31, I bumped my INT down to 151 and my WIS up to 105 to<br/>
&gt;attempt tinkering.  I set out with the intent of 16 flameless lanters<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;These are my results:<br/>
&gt;8 successful Flameless Lanterns<br/>
&gt;8 failed lanterns<br/>
&gt;2 failed cams <br/>
&gt;0 raise in skill<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, I quit.  No more tinkering for me.  If they are going to be so bold as to<br/>
&gt;never allow a SINGLE point of skill to raise after 50pp spent and 18 attempts<br/>
&gt;at mediochre (useless) items, then to hell with this skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What are we all getting hyped over anyway?  Every other trade skill I have<br/>
&gt;tried went up after a few attempts/failures when I was doing items of an<br/>
&gt;acceptable skill level.  If you spend 32pp doing bakery, you&#39;re close to<br/>
&gt;master!  With smithing, I got into my 40&#39;s after about 10pp.  But<br/>

&gt;trade skill is Jewelcraft, which is limited to Enchanters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;Here&#39;s your hint:  Verant doesn&#39;t care about tinkering and it&#39;s doubtful they<br/>
&gt;ever will.<br/>

&gt;Good luck at finding something guys.<br/>
