<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839282">I used to play EQ a lot and still signed up to the<br/>
tinkering newsletter, but my account hasnt been<br/>
&#39;active&#39; in a while, i think i re-signed over last<br/>
thanksgiving (november 2001) just to log in and<br/>
remember the days.  I have a 45 necro and was<br/>
wondering how long my account can be inactive until<br/>
they delete my character (which i dont want to<br/>
happen.)  I thought i read somewhere it was 3 months,<br/>
but I know that when i re-activated my account back in<br/>
november i hadnt played in like 4-5 months and it was<br/>
still there...  anyone know the real answer to this, i<br/>
would really appreciate it :p<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>
