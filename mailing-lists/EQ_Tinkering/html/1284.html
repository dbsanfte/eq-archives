<b>Subject:</b> How to sell an aqua lung <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-328300124">My question is, does it matter if the aqua lung has 0 charges or 50 charges <br/>
when you use it to make a rebreather?<br/>
<br/>
If not, here&#39;s my plan: Offer a deal to anyone that buys an aqua lung, that <br/>
when you are ready to make rebreathers, you will take their aqua lung and <br/>
only charge for the cost of the parts of the upgrade. Then gouge anyone that <br/>
wants to buy a rebreather without buying an aqua lung first. There&#39;s just a <br/>
pesky problem with failures, and how to work that out with people. But I <br/>
think it could be a workable plan.<br/>

&gt;Hi Folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I have been having a bitch of a time trying to sell the aqua lungs.<br/>
&gt;With a cost of 225 to make, people just will not buy them, even for a price<br/>
&gt;as low as 500 or 600 plat (which is a deal considering cost/failure rate).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They hear &#39;charges&#39; and they run away. They tell me to come back when I am<br/>
&gt;able to make the rebreather =( Of course I may never be able to make the<br/>
&gt;rebreather if I am never able to sell my aqua lungs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;bah...<br/>
