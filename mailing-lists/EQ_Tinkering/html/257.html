<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lens Quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539985008">Here is my personal theory: I belive that becuase of Bidl Frugrin not being <br/>
implemented yet, the quest was not finished. With this patch they might have <br/>
put Bidl in, as I have heard, and have made the other two gnomes actually <br/>
give the lenses when you talk to them. I have heard that Bidl will be <br/>
located as a random spawn in one of the Faydarks. I have also heard that to <br/>
get the other two lenses, you MUST kill the gnomes. In this new patch, they <br/>
might have fixed it, but has anyone ever tried comeing back in two weeks? <br/>
You know that the world of Norrath actually has time, right? Just type /time <br/>
to see what time it is in the game. So maybe if you came back in exactly two <br/>
weeks, they&#39;d give it to you. I don&#39;t know, we will have to see what changes <br/>
have been made when the servers come back up.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Well, this is my first post, someone told me about this, and I was <br/>
&gt;thrilled!  Anyhow, on to the good stuff.  I have put over 200p into <br/>
&gt;Tinkering (i&#39;m a lvl 22 magician), creating flameless lanterns.  That&#39;s <br/>
&gt;INCLUDING the $$ i get back from selling them.  I have yet to raise a skill <br/>
&gt;level..=(  This makes me wonder if I will get through 1000p and still not <br/>
&gt;raise it a point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the quest for the lenses.  I have tried it myself, and have had little <br/>
&gt;success.  First of all I ask the gnome right outside akanon, and he tells <br/>
&gt;me i&#39;m too experienced.  The one in Fay says that I have to come back in <br/>
&gt;two weeks.  I am not high enough to kill either of them and take the lens.  <br/>
&gt;I got the third lens from the DE in freeport, I killed her (she was blue <br/>
&gt;dangerous).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But, I would not stop there, so I went back to steamfont, and tried to <br/>
&gt;discover WHO the gnomes would actually give the lens to.  Well, I tried lvl <br/>
&gt;4 magician, lvl 7 wizard, lvl 8 wizard, lvl 11 magician.  They all were <br/>
&gt;told to come back two weeks later.  Then i tried a lvl 13 Wizard, who was <br/>
&gt;told he was too experienced!  Argh!  If any of you have gotten the lens <br/>
&gt;from them, what class/lvl where you?  Unfortunately I cannot kill either of <br/>
&gt;the gnomes, neither do I want to, as it would ruin my standing with my own <br/>
&gt;race.  Any advice?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On one last note, hoping that since Bidl Frufrun was being fixed during <br/>
&gt;last test server, that he will be repaired for this patch.  Not sure if <br/>
&gt;he&#39;ll be in Steamfont as he is supposed to be, or if he&#39;ll be in The <br/>
&gt;Fayder&#39;s as the Guide mentioned earlier.  I may just go runnin <br/>
&gt;Steamfont/Fay&#39;s offering a reward for anyone who can find Bidl....heh.  <br/>
&gt;Anyhow, hope this all helps, and would like some help myself!<br/>
