<b>Subject:</b> Cazic Thule Gnomes <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-113824304">I&#39;m a tinkerer on Cazic Thule with a skill lvl of 103. I would like to <br/>
suggest that we fix prices on Cazic Thule for items.  The only other gnome <br/>
tinkerer I have seen on Cazic is Gnomos and he&#39;s obviously bored with too <br/>
much money as the amount he sells things for I could never compete with.  I <br/>
would like get back a little of the money i&#39;ve put into this skill ;-)<br/>
<br/>
May I suggest<br/>
70pp for spyglasses<br/>
650pp for Auqalungs<br/>
2000pp for rebreathers (not sure on this as I am not at this lvl)<br/>
<br/>
And if you see gnomos (well he&#39;ll actually approach you telling you you&#39;re <br/>
selling them for too much and giving tinkerers a bad name.  Tell him that <br/>
this was the price agreed by the tinkerers of Cazic.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone does disagree with these prices please reply with your ideas :)<br/>
<br/>

Tinkerer Of Cazic<br/>
