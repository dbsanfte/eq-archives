<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885233629">The cams do work.  A member of my guild is a fletcher.  He used a cam I<br/>
tinkered for him and successfully made a very nice bow.  I will try to get<br/>
stats and a screen shot and send it into the web page.<br/>

&gt;		I for one am relieved to see that the recipe for spyglass is<br/>
&gt;not broken.  I am also really happy to get more information on the fishing<br/>
&gt;pole.  Thanks for telling us that you were given the fishing pole and had<br/>
&gt;not made it.  I, for one, am reluctant to start experimenting on an<br/>
&gt;expensive trade for fear that the correct recipe is broken &lt; for those that<br/>
&gt;bake remember the dough recipe? &gt;  It&#39;s rather interesting to see that most<br/>
&gt;of the trade skills are in a deadlock over certain components for high end<br/>
&gt;skills:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;		Alchemy- Doesn&#39;t seem to be widely implemented yet<br/>
&gt;		Poison - still too new in my opinion<br/>
&gt;		Tailoring - lack of resources: i.e. hq pelts<br/>
&gt;		Blacksmithing - always lack the skill for folded sheets of<br/>
&gt;metal and lack of weapon/plate molds<br/>
&gt;		Baking - smoker available for purchase but not use<br/>
&gt;		Brewing - no one can find many of the components &lt;morning<br/>
&gt;dew for one&gt; and no one knows how to make vodka<br/>
&gt;		Jewelry - extreme shortage of high end components<br/>
&gt;		Fletching - have been told that our cams can be used, but<br/>
&gt;not verified<br/>
&gt;		Pottery - many of the recipes are invalid (mixing bowl for<br/>
&gt;one) <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;		And then comes ours - Tinkering - an extreme lack of<br/>
&gt;information.  Having dabbled in all the trade skill this one seems the most<br/>
&gt;frustrating.  In all of the other skill, one buys the book, reads it and<br/>
&gt;voila..on the road to success, until one gets high enough where the<br/>
&gt;mysteries of the game come in.  Which I can respect.  But from step one,<br/>
&gt;things like firewater are left out.  &lt;yes I do know how to make it by the<br/>
&gt;way&gt;  I can&#39;t seem to get anyone to talk about it, npc&#39;s that is. &lt;but that<br/>
&gt;could be due to my faction - I&#39;m a necro&gt;  So here is my idea.  If Lukas<br/>
&gt;would be willing &lt;since his web page has 10,000 hits&gt; There can&#39;t be that<br/>
&gt;many combinations to make the pole.  Have Lukas make up a spreadsheet of<br/>
&gt;every combination and people email him request 5 things to try and he give<br/>
&gt;it to him.  Trial and error, we will succeed.  Then, say, oh for a week keep<br/>
&gt;the recipe to ourselves before posting.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;		So, what shall we sell this pole for anyway?  Double the<br/>
&gt;cost of components?  Just my 2 cents.<br/>
