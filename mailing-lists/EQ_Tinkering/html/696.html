<div id="ygrps-yiv-302479147">Well so I am level 31, I bumped my INT down to 151 and my WIS up to 105 to<br/>
attempt tinkering.  I set out with the intent of 16 flameless lanters (32pp). <br/>
bought 16 waters, 16 gnomish spirits (combined to make firewater), 16 lanterns,<br/>
and 16 metal twines.  I also grabbed some bolts and grease to make cams.  I sit<br/>
down, and start tinkering.<br/>
<br/>
These are my results:<br/>
8 successful Flameless Lanterns<br/>
8 failed lanterns<br/>
2 failed cams <br/>
0 raise in skill<br/>
<br/>
So, I quit.  No more tinkering for me.  If they are going to be so bold as to<br/>
never allow a SINGLE point of skill to raise after 50pp spent and 18 attempts<br/>
at mediochre (useless) items, then to hell with this skill.<br/>
<br/>
What are we all getting hyped over anyway?  Every other trade skill I have<br/>
tried went up after a few attempts/failures when I was doing items of an<br/>
acceptable skill level.  If you spend 32pp doing bakery, you&#39;re close to<br/>
master!  With smithing, I got into my 40&#39;s after about 10pp.  But nooooo... we<br/>
start at an even 50 so it&#39;s up to us to dump 1000&#39;s of pp into it to raise it<br/>
from 50 to 70ish.  What a bunch of crap.  The ONLY profitable and worthwhile<br/>
trade skill is Jewelcraft, which is limited to Enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is, the items we make are pointless.  Cams are the only plausable<br/>
item we can currently construct that might make tinkering worth it. <br/>
Unfortunately BOWS aren&#39;t that great, and due to their limited usability cams<br/>
are not a viable means of living.  Especially when you factor in failure rates<br/>
and the amount of money you need to dump into it to get your skill high enough<br/>
to make cams reliably.  A spyglass?  A collapsable fishing pole?  And to think<br/>
of all the time and effort we have spent TRYING to figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s your hint:  Verant doesn&#39;t care about tinkering and it&#39;s doubtful they<br/>
ever will.<br/>
<br/>
How often do you hear someone walk around screaming &quot;HEY!  SELLING large jars! <br/>
only 1pp!! gimme a tell!&quot;  The same addage carries over to tinkering.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck at finding something guys.<br/>
