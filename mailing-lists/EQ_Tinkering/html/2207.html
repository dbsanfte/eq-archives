<b>Subject:</b> Possible new pet idea (Tinkerable) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-335258211">I&#39;ve got an interesting notion on a Tinkerable Pet.<br/>
<br/>
How about something that&#39;s Ogre/Troll sized, and has NO combat abilities<br/>
(cons neutral with mobs, they won&#39;t attack  it). Make it a Mechanical Pet<br/>
that serves that function of &quot;Cargo Lifting&quot; or whatnot. So Mobs won&#39;t<br/>
attack the pet, it won&#39;t defend / fight for you. AND when you have this<br/>
Cargo Pet active, you get DOUBLE your normal weight allowance for inventory<br/>
/ carrying stuff?<br/>
<br/>
That way it can&#39;t be used as a combat advantage since it won&#39;t  fight/ be<br/>
fought. AND since it&#39;s using a pet slot for any normal pet classes, they<br/>
would be sacrificing a regular pet just to have this one and lug around<br/>
extra stuff. I think it balances nicely.<br/>
<br/>
It would STILL disappear when you zone/LD... which would put you WAY over<br/>
weight limit next time you got back in.. unlesss you had another you could<br/>
&quot;deploy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Well? What do you folks think? Seems to me it&#39;s:<br/>
<br/>
1.) Balanced<br/>
2.) Usefull<br/>
3.) It would look DAMN cool having a mechanical Ogre following you around =)<br/>
