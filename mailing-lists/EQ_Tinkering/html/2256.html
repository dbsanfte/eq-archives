<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320524447">Greetings, Fellow Tinkerers!<br/>
<br/>
I am Gertii, the Tinkering Gnomette of Grey &lt;Xegony&gt;.  Various <br/>
members of my guild, The Greys &lt;Xegony&gt; have reached the lofty <br/>
heights of leveling where the are going to be needing some serious <br/>
help in carcass retrieval.  I&#39;ve been reading the community receipes <br/>
posted in Fulcrum&#39;s and saw one for a floating coffin.  I was <br/>
wondering if anyone has actually made one of these and if it worked.  <br/>
Also, if the first two are true, if there&#39;s anyone on Xegony, who is <br/>
of a high enough level to try and make one for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
