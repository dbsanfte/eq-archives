<div id="ygrps-yiv-920024001">As a Gnome Enchanter and one of the only two (now maybe three) in my guild,  a certin amout of request are made on my time.<br/>
<br/>
As of which I have not had a chance to spent time or the money (it goes to other projects) in what is my skill by race.<br/>
<br/>
As i go about my life on the plant we call Norrath i have had to pleasure (and misfortune) to meet both Gazamel, and Mauldoon.<br/>
<br/>
My metting with Gazamel was one of a polite gnome, asking how I was doing, and how my work progressed in Tinkering. The question here was more along the lines of &quot;How are you doing, adn do you need any help&quot;<br/>
<br/>
MY metting with Mauldoon was any thing but. I once sent an appolige to Mauldoon for the wrong &quot;misinformed on my part&quot; done to him by other Gnomes trying to get him to tell them where the items to tinkering where. This was done in a chance to strick up a conversation and posible friendship. The responce i recived from Mauldoon was nada. My one metting with him, was when he apporched me, acted like we were old friends and asked for a Clarity.<br/>
<br/>
At this point in my short life (pun intended) my respect is in Gazamel.<br/>
