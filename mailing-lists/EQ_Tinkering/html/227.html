<div id="ygrps-yiv-479008473">This is news to me.  Well, I will have to keep camping it when I get back <br/>
on the game Sunday.<br/>
Well, can you tell me where Bidl spawns and how to get the other two lenses <br/>
from the observatories?<br/>

&gt;All the lenses are for the observer Staff.    For sure.    That is not an<br/>
&gt;issue.<br/>
&gt;     I have seen people complete this quest in akanon so it can be done.<br/>
&gt;    There is a whole guild on the Povar server Named the Harmonium that have<br/>
&gt;these staffs from accomplishing the four lenses quest.     granted You can<br/>
&gt;also get the staff off the borxx evil eye by obtaining his lense.    But I<br/>
&gt;have seen high level characters in the mino caves in steam font get the lense<br/>
&gt;from the slave in there.    They do it regularly to keep their lower level<br/>
&gt;guildies equipped.<br/>
