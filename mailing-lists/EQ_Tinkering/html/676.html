<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016286456">Why do you all act like this? I try to help, but you decline it. If what you <br/>
want is for me to truly leave with my information, then that is what I will <br/>
do. I will leave the choice up to you. I&#39;m trying to apologize by helping, <br/>
but you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all I&#39;m <br/>
out here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What I <br/>
have to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just want <br/>
to check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all hate <br/>
me so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because <br/>
you think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all <br/>
with out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept it <br/>
or decline it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;The fact that your not willing to reveal what it is you have to do, so that<br/>
&gt;others on the list, some of whom are in the high level 40s can do this only<br/>
&gt;suggests that your simply back to troll some more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So why don&#39;t you just kindly leave?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh wait, you want to troll a bunch of messages so then you can come back in<br/>
&gt;a couple days and say something like, &quot;Well, I found the important thing,<br/>
&gt;but since you all were unkind to me I won&#39;t reveal it, but this time its<br/>
&gt;your alls faults, not mine.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Gimme a break and just leave...<br/>
