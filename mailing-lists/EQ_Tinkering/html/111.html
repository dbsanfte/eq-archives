<br/>
I have been keeping up with this off topic question and I have a bit of news<br/>
that will burst your bubble a bit or perhaps not. The staff from the priest<br/>
can not be made by any quest or skill it is just an item from loot further<br/>
more it is not even a 2h weapon it is a 1h weapon I think it has 23 to 28<br/>
dly and has 10dmg a friend of mine killed the priest and had one for a<br/>
while... I have Heard a bit about other staff quests. There is one in the<br/>
quenos hills for a jaggedpine crook (a druid and ranger only weapon) for<br/>
this quest you must be below lvl 8 and have a top and bottom of a broken<br/>
staff.. If my memory servers it does about 5dmg and has 23 dly plus gives<br/>
like 5hp and mana. In the Karanas I have talked to people who have found<br/>
other staff segment pieces for what this quest is for I am not sure ( I have<br/>
been told there is 13 staff segments in all and the top looks like a skull<br/>
but I can not confirm this for sure) I hope this helps those out there.. As<br/>
for the King he looks like a small male human so that he can not be mistaken<br/>
as just another gnome a gm has told me that in the long run they were<br/>
thinking of adding a quest that he gives out but as for now he just acts<br/>
like another clockwork gnome.<br/>
