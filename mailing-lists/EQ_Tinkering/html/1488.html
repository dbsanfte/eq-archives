<div id="ygrps-yiv-334703660">I wouln&#39;t waste the diamond.  I was at the ogres last night with my<br/>
shaman, and all 3 of the ogres say this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;gimme Duffeenitey rocks, me ---- em gud!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With the ---- replaced by crush, grind, etc.  Perhaps the gnome in Rathe<br/>
Mountains will be a better bet...<br/>
