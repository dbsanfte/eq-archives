<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694738093">Let me tell you about my story last night<br/>
<br/>
With the recipe in hand I gleefully trekked back to ak&#39;anon and proceed to<br/>
spend 150pp making all the fishing poles I could.  Then I gated back to<br/>
South Karana&#39;s and began hawking my wares.  Sold quite a few and then one<br/>
person came up to me asking for spyglass.  I said sure &lt;had that recipe<br/>
also&gt; and so she teleported me to Butcherblock and away I went.<br/>
<br/>
10 tries, 4 successes, 2 skill point increases. 150pp gone<br/>
<br/>
Ouch.  I really need to get a wisdom suit.  Failures hurt way bad.<br/>
<br/>
But I get more requests for spyglasses than fishing poles.  Sold em for 75pp<br/>
each.  Everyone happy.</div>
