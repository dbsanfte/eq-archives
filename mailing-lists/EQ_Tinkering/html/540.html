&gt;And I quote:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Thats what they did, and they found something, so why shouldn&#39;t you have <br/>
&gt;to do the same thing that they did? Why should you just sit back and <br/>
&gt;happily profit from<br/>
&gt;all thier work?&quot;<br/>
&gt;If these are his true feelings, then wouldn&#39;t it be &quot;common sense&quot; to assum <br/>
&gt;that he himself should have also worked towards this &quot;secret&quot;... the old <br/>
&gt;fashion way.. yet instead, from the way he has worded it, and I understand, <br/>
&gt;he has (if there is any truth to this at all) conned this information out <br/>
&gt;of this &quot;Secret group&quot;. If you look beyond his flavored use of words and <br/>
&gt;meaningless advice, he is no better... nothing more... then us, the people <br/>
&gt;who instead of researching ourselves want the information handed to us... <br/>
&gt;although we attempt some form of detective work, it is mainly the view of a <br/>
&gt;bat... we look around blindly for the answer, however we still, deep down <br/>
&gt;expect the answer to be handed to us through sound (word of mouth). My <br/>
&gt;point is, if this was something that people wanted to keep secret, they <br/>
&gt;would not let it leak to ppl such as &quot;Joshua Bednarz&quot; who brag about this <br/>
&gt;so called knowledge on the Tinkering list itself... because this, this is <br/>
&gt;how stuff gets leaked.. one person says something, which leads to someone <br/>
&gt;else gaining the knowledge, and the never ending catalyist begins. So thank <br/>
&gt;you Joshua, thank you for pushing over the first domino... now the fun <br/>
&gt;begins!<br/>

&gt;all its worth yet after all...<br/>

&gt;in the hopes that everyone will beg you for info was immature to begin<br/>

&gt;Im sure mr Berdnaz or something is just plain selfish.  The point of giving<br/>
&gt;the information is that then on websites you get your name up there.  And<br/>
&gt;secrets dont stay long in Norrath<br/>

&gt;		Because of my obvious genius, I was able to find more out<br/>
&gt;about the<br/>
&gt;		collapsible fishing pole than ALL OF YOU put together, and<br/>
&gt;not only do I<br/>
&gt;		think that I&#39;m on the verge of discovering the secret of the<br/>
&gt;fishing pole,<br/>
&gt;		but I think I&#39;m on the verge of discovering the lost<br/>
&gt;tinkering book! Hahaha!<br/>
&gt;		I know something none of you know, but I&#39;m not going to<br/>
&gt;tell. I will not<br/>
&gt;		dishonor my self or others, so sorry. I just wanted you guys<br/>
&gt;to know tat I<br/>
&gt;		know something, and could very well soon find out the<br/>
&gt;secret, but like I<br/>
&gt;		said, I won&#39;t tell.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;while I agree that Josh is an ass I think he&#39;s right, we should stop <br/>
&gt;wasting time trying to guess the formula and work on finding the third book <br/>
&gt;(which is actually the first). even if someone does guess the fishing pole <br/>
&gt;there are still other things in the book that we don&#39;t know, like <br/>
&gt;fireworks. I know this book exists and to prove it I&#39;ll give you the one <br/>
&gt;formula I was able to get out of the person who has it. animated bait -- 1 <br/>
&gt;cork, 1 spricket. the only purpose I can find for this is practice for non <br/>
&gt;gnomes since the two things cost much more than bait and it&#39;s trivial for a <br/>
&gt;gnome. personally I think the book is in Solusek&#39;s eye, the tinkering <br/>
&gt;merchant has to be there for some reason. I just hope we don&#39;t have to kill <br/>
&gt;a gnome for it.<br/>

&gt;and<br/>
&gt;you know so screw you&quot; messages.  I thought most of us got past that by the <br/>
&gt;time<br/>
&gt;we were in kindergarten.  It seems that may people on this list did not <br/>
&gt;have the<br/>

&gt;Every day brings another message like this drivel.  This guy knows nothing <br/>

&gt; &gt; I do know something. I took all my knowledge, everything I know, used <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the common sense I have, and was able to talk my way into a clue from a<br/>
&gt; &gt; person that knows all about the fishing poles. At first I thought <br/>
&gt;whoever<br/>
&gt; &gt; knew about it was selfish, that they had no right to keep this, but then<br/>
&gt; &gt; when I found out that this group of people worked hard for what they had<br/>
&gt; &gt; found, and are very secrective about it, don&#39;t deserve their secret to <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; given away. I mean, THEY are the ones that found the secret, and yes it <br/>
&gt;is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; secret, so why is it that they should just go off and tell everyone? <br/>
&gt;This<br/>
&gt; &gt; game is all about exploration and finding things, and having fun. Thats <br/>
&gt;what<br/>
&gt; &gt; they did, and they found something, so why shouldn&#39;t you have to do the <br/>
&gt;same<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing that they did? Why should you just sit back and happily profit <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt; &gt; all thier work? This group, whom is a very secretive group, whom I shall <br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt; &gt; name, worked hard to get what they know, and so I&#39;m not going to go <br/>
&gt;giving<br/>
&gt; &gt; away the clue I was told, especially after the rude, immature, <br/>
&gt;derogatory<br/>
&gt; &gt; comments that were made about me. I will tell you this though. Waste not <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; plat more on trying combinations. You are not only wasting your money, <br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt; &gt; you are wasting your time. Search the world, high and low, search the <br/>
&gt;world<br/>
&gt; &gt; above and below...<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is all I will say. It&#39;s been nice being part of this list. I though <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; were a bunch of decent people. Your coments have changed my mind. I will <br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt; &gt; longer be a part of this list as you wish. It&#39;s been fun guys, and <br/>

&gt;You know I thought of that, so I went and hunted him and I think all he had<br/>
&gt;was some leather armor or something.  His name is Feddi Dooger.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
&gt;that he sometimes carries a lore item knife of some sort, but I wasn&#39;t able<br/>
&gt;to get one and couldn&#39;t find any mention of the knife anywhere in ak&#39;anon.<br/>

&gt;That reminds me, has any tried doing anything with the gnomes in the mino<br/>

&gt;animated bait works just like regular bait, maybe it increases your chances<br/>
&gt;of catching something but I&#39;m not sure because I&#39;m a master fisherman<br/>
&gt;anyway. and I&#39;m pretty sure that anyone can tinker, gnomes just start out<br/>

&gt;Yes, and here is what information I gained from that attempt. I did not <br/>

&gt;Salvador (thats not his name, but I know it&#39;s something like that) online,<br/>
&gt;but I did a who 40-50 gnome all serch to see if any of them were his<br/>

&gt;be rather (they seem to have had a fight) He said Salvador hadn&#39;t been on<br/>
&gt;for a long time, but he had been acting strange before he left. He said <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;Salvador would be the kind of person that would do something like find a<br/>
&gt;secret that he could make pofit off of, then keep it to himself, but his<br/>
&gt;friend said he had no knowledge that Salvador had ever been making<br/>
&gt;collapsible fishing poles, or spy glasses. He also said it was very <br/>
&gt;unlikely<br/>
&gt;that he could have found out the recipe also, since Salvador never was<br/>

&gt;I reread my message, and these words below basically do explain what I was<br/>
&gt;being like.<br/>

&gt; &gt;You are an asshole<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I apologize, I didn&#39;t mean to come off sounding so pompous, and arrogant. I<br/>
&gt;really was being pathetically immature, I guess it was just becuase I had<br/>
&gt;just gotten a clue, that really helps the discovery or the pole. You see it<br/>
&gt;would clear up alot, but I don&#39;t wish to tell because, I swore to the one<br/>
&gt;who told me the clue that I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone what it was that he said,<br/>
&gt;and I don&#39;t want to dishonor him, or myself. They hold this secret pretty<br/>
&gt;close to thier hearts, and take it pretty seriously. I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt;decieve this person. I can, when I want to, use words with the most<br/>
&gt;excellent of skill, like when I got a clue from the guy that part of this<br/>
&gt;unknown organization, and I can also be a jerk and come off sounding like <br/>
&gt;an<br/>
&gt;8 year old troll, as you have learned, well I&#39;m sorry, and I hope you can<br/>
&gt;understand why I feel that I must keep my knowledge a secret for now.<br/>

&gt; &gt;animated bait works just like regular bait, maybe it increases your <br/>
&gt;chances<br/>
&gt; &gt;of catching something but I&#39;m not sure because I&#39;m a master fisherman<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyway. and I&#39;m pretty sure that anyone can tinker, gnomes just start out<br/>
&gt; &gt;with some skill in it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;No no NO!  Gnomes are the only ones that can tinker, period.  That&#39;s why<br/>
&gt;they have such ugly stats, and that Erudites make better casters, period.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s all a balance issue.<br/>
