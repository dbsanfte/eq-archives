<b>Subject:</b> On possible changes in success rates <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053229923">:Somewhere in the last several patches, something must have changed<br/>
:with success ratios for tinkering.  My skill is currently 118, in my<br/>
:last 16 lung attempts, I&#39;ve succeeded only 4 times.  These attempts<br/>
:were done over a period of a month or so.  I only recently decided to<br/>
:try tinkering again, thinking that my prior experience was just a<br/>
:bad-luck streak.<br/>
:<br/>
:My 2nd to last batch of lungs cost me 800p per lung.  My most recent<br/>
:batch cost me 1000p per lung.<br/>
:<br/>
:Has anyone else noticed or experienced this?<br/>
:<br/>
:Perhaps a change was made to weigh wisdom more heavily in the<br/>
:formula?<br/>
:<br/>
:I blew 1750p last night, and walked away with ONE lung.<br/>
<br/>
This past weekend a buddy of mine and I tinkered away for about 45<br/>
minutes he buying the components and selling the completed aqualungs<br/>
for me (he has a charisma of 180+) and I just combining the<br/>
components he gave me.  With 2500 plat I was able to make 17<br/>
attempts, after taking into account the coin I got back from selling<br/>
the completed lungs.  I figgure I succeeded roughly half the time<br/>
(maybe a little less), and those 17 attempts turned into 8 skill<br/>
points for me, from 106 to 114.<br/>
<br/>
So I think you must have just had a run of bad luck, becuase my stats<br/>
aren&#39;t really that terriffic: 158 or so INT and a WIS of maybe 80 if<br/>
even that.<br/>
<br/>
