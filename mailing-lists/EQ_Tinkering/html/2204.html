<div id="ygrps-yiv-420603860">Yup, they definitely can&#39;t make it a high HP pet.  I just want a pet to show<br/>
off my tinkering skill and to goof off with.  It would provide a great money<br/>
sink which Verant seems to love, as well.  I don&#39;t even care if it will<br/>
fight anything.  A pet that follows me like a shadow or at most even looks<br/>
for food and that&#39;s it is good enough for me. Some people had some great<br/>
suggestions on different kinds of pets and the various pricing.  Good work.<br/>
I&#39;ll keep my fingers crossed and hope my warrior gets to tinker a playmate<br/>
someday. <br/>

What about a wizard class. Which all in all would be the strongest class<br/>
with even a crappy little pet. A wizards biggest problem is keeping the mob<br/>
occupied while he/she cast a spell. Think about it even if the pet had 200<br/>
HP it would take a giant 2 hits to kill it giving the casting times on<br/>
wizard spells. He could get his root off and then proceed to whip up the<br/>
giant I am not saying he would still win, but a class that is strong like<br/>
wizards that do not use pets and would really damn strong if they did, would<br/>
be something Verant would not ever do.<br/>
