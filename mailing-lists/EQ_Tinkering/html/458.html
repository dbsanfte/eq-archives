<div id="ygrps-yiv-283062470">Beg to differ, but I am an enchanter.  Returning the head resulted in a thank you, and<br/>
some minor coin.  Also created a mule Ogre, with a friend, turned in like 20 guild notes,<br/>
gave the mule the head (It was NOT no drop like the compendium).   Same reward.  I also<br/>
recieved an E-Mail from the person in charge of quests (I can look up his address if you<br/>
want it)  He told us (EQ-Brewers) to try the quest after the next patch, &quot;but I don&#39;t<br/>
know if the results will be what you expect&quot;  We did, we recieved the compendium then the<br/>
Stien.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Minor Correction here.  The Glowing Stien was NOT part of the game until less than<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 week before the spoiler went up.  It was the reward for the Brewers Compendium<br/>
&gt; &gt; Quest.  The quest, until recently, was broken.  It returned Pungala&#39;s head (Ogre<br/>
&gt; &gt; Head), not the compendium.  Many bartender&#39;s have tried this quest, and it was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bartender who first completed it.   On a side note,  GM&#39;s informed several players<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the quest indeed worked, before the patch.  They then came back and said it<br/>
&gt; &gt; will be fixed in an up coming patch (Another Lie)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No the quest always worked, the problem was that no one had used all the proper spells<br/>
&gt; on the Ogre to raise the faction high enough.  That is why an enchanter was required<br/>
&gt; to do the quest, which was the part that the general population of norrath didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; figure out until a week before the last patch. </span></blockquote></div>
