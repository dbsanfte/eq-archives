<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469187207">I&#39;m very glad we all finally have the ability to make it, not that it<br/>
is more than novelty but hey, at least we can make jokes about our<br/>
extendable rods *smirk*...  On a more grim note, at what skill can you<br/>
start making the spyglass?  I tried once last night and bombed, not<br/>
having another 20pp to drop I decided to wait until I was a more mature<br/>
gnome or at least had a big wad-o-coin to pump into this venture.  And<br/>
yes, fireworks seem too pooped to pop.<br/>
