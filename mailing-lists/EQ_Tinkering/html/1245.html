<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904165635">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Dont forget to /petition and /bug tonight about us losing the 50 charges on the aqua lung when its traded. Even is you have not made one yet... do it.<br/>
<br/>
Just got my skill up to 95 by the way with spyglasses. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone here below with a skill above 100 yet their character is below 35? I would like to confirm/bunk the skill level max theory.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
