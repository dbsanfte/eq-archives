&gt; Found out something interesting on stratististics.  One of the quests from<br/>
&gt; Gem Choppers hall (Warriors Guild) rewards people with Tattered armor.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve only talked to 1 person who has done this quest and he recieved<br/>
&gt; Tattered cloth arm bands as his reward.  Maybe this is the place to obtain<br/>
&gt; the cloak.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually I&#39;ve done the quest it&#39;s a bit drawn out, but I did get &quot;tattered&quot;<br/>
gloves.<br/>
So, it appears we must repeat this quest again and again to get a cloak?<br/>
<br/>
Which would make sense, sort of, if Thermal Cloaks are REALLY cool.<br/>
(Ok, I&#39;m dreaming about Thermal Cloaks doing damage like a Flame Shield)<br/>
