<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045892058">I played since beta 1 and tinkering was not implimented untill the very end<br/>
of phase 4.. and even then it was essentially non-functioning... You say<br/>
robots were taken out? I don&#39;t know where you heard this rumor.. there NEVER<br/>
ever were robots.. not even the notion. I remember a post back in beta<br/>
asking about this.. and all the gm had to say was that it would unbalance<br/>
the game uncontrolably.. and it would. Imagine a wizard with a robot pet...<br/>
or something like that. Anyway just wanted to clear that up..<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] My remaining big questions...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Whats the lodestone for at our new merchant?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Has anyone done any research into the unstable firewater mentioned in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;    journal? The one that sent a firework screaming into the storage<br/>
facility?<br/>
&gt;    I tried several combinations of multiple Gnomish Spirits and water, but<br/>
no<br/>
&gt;    progress.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. Any idea where this &quot;storage cavern&quot; mentioned is?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. I tried combining a stalking probes and a firewater from the other<br/>
reference<br/>
&gt;    in the first (2nd?) journal. Where Gimble was afraid the probe could<br/>
&gt;    explode (funny, I&#39;m HOPING the dam probes will explode!  :)  Anyone<br/>
else<br/>
&gt;    try stuff along this line?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5. Anyone do tinkering when EQ was beta? Any formulas for robots and such?<br/>
&gt;    I know they were taken out, but maybe such recipes would give clues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 6. Anyone find any use for the small power sources and function force<br/>
modules<br/>
&gt;    found in Solusek?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
