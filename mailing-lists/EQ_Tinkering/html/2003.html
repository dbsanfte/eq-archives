&gt; Hi all :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Today I boldly agreed to make a full set of large banded for a troll for<br/>
&gt; 90pp.  I soon discovered the problems..  Firstly, he had to go and get the<br/>
&gt; molds from The Feerrott, cuz the Freeport shop only has medium molds.<br/>
&gt; Apparently there is no forge down there.  Secondly, it&#39;s nearly impossible<br/>
&gt; for me (skill 110 ish) to make about four of the banded armour pieces.<br/>
&gt; Thirdly, failures cost between 4pp and 6pp.  After three trips to the<br/>
&gt; Feerrott for the troll, and literally hours of real time, I had made his<br/>
&gt; banded at a loss to me of 100pp.  Oh, and I gained 2 points of skill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ah well, I&#39;ll stick to jewellery and Steins I think.  I made the 100pp back<br/>
&gt; in 1/2 hour from jewellery, and then sold a Stein for 300pp :)<br/>
