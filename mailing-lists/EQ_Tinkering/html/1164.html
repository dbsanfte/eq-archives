<div id="ygrps-yiv-49212635">I am a 29 gnome Wiz, I cannot seem to get my tinkering skill above 70, does anyone know why? I have spent so much money on tinkering now and my skill is 70, but even after I got to 70 skill I have made 30 spyglasses and 24 cams, no skill gain. Is there some kind of level cap?<br/>
