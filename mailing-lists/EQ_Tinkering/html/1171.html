<div id="ygrps-yiv-974242308">there is an enchanter quest in the new temple zone which calls for a silvered wand, which is supposed to be gotten from a silvered guard in the same temple.  It could be the same thing though I am not sure.<br/>

  Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] Killed a clockwork<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    I was with a couple of friends yesterday who are level 50. They were bored so I suggested going to kill a clockwork spider in Ak&#39;Anon. We all went in and they ended up killing Clockwork XIIC (a spider). It was blue to both of them. Loot that came from the spider was a C series blackbox (Which I believe is part of a warrior quest), and a Silvered Rod which is a lore item. Does anyone know what this silvered rod is for?<br/>
