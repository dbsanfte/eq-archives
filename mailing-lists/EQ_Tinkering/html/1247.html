<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824605258">I disagree with your comments.  Verant is trying desperately to take money out<br/>
of the system.  Almost all of the new quests involve a method of depleting your<br/>
bank account.  Trade skills have always been a money pit.   Decreasing the<br/>
charges from 50 to 1 upon trade would accomplish nothing but making the item<br/>
unsellable, and causing distrust between the players who are driving the<br/>
&quot;player driven economy&quot;, this fact alone seems to be in direct conflict with<br/>
Verant&#39;s vision.  Its a bug.  I suggest we all /bug it, and if you can<br/>
fabricate an aqua lung, I suggest you do so and /petition a GM so he can see<br/>
first hand.<br/>
