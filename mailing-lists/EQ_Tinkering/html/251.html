&gt; Look. That is the best news I&#39;ve heard in awhile on this mailing list, but I<br/>
&gt; think that Verant has been forggeting something.<br/>
&gt; They are about to patch the test server for the third! time in a row.<br/>
&gt; Alas they have not even patched the real game with the &quot;warrior patch&quot;<br/>
&gt; as it&#39;s called, which is the patch with the warrior improvements that they<br/>
&gt; patched onto the test server when they implemented the RW server codes into<br/>
&gt; the Test server. It just seems fishy that they only care about patching the<br/>
&gt; test server now, doesn&#39;t it to you?<br/>
