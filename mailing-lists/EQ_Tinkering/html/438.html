<div id="ygrps-yiv-810248318"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I think that fireworks were mentioned only as a marketing ploy, and not<br/>
&gt;actually put into the game.  I hope someone dispels this thought, because <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;would make my year to please others with free fireworks shows.  Of course, <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;doubt the are implemented because the game engine wouldn&#39;t be able to <br/>
&gt;handle<br/>
&gt;that kind of complex graphics, without seriously taxing the client <br/>
&gt;computer.<br/>
&gt;  My 128meg RAM, 32meg video RAM computer still bogs down with lots of<br/>
&gt;entities in view (players, mobs, corpses, etc), and fireworks would be an<br/>
&gt;enormous amount of entities to deal with.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Next time you load the game up to play.. and the splash screen comes up with <br/>
the EQ chick on it... Notice all those pics are probably from some early <br/>
beta or even alpha... Sky in Everfrost and Greater fay? The gnoll with the <br/>
bow? Anyway... Look at the pic in the top middle.. I have a feeling this is <br/>
what the gnomish fireworks were and what they look like. The fireworks <br/>
probably got taken out of the game just like the sky in Everfrost and <br/>
Greater Fay did (go figure). So.. they would be just as CPU crunching as any <br/>
spell that someone casts.<br/>
Just some more silly meaningless info...<br/>
