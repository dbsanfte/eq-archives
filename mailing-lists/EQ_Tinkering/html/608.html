<b>Subject:</b> Tinkering skill increase <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074263888">I just did a Petition to a GM today, and after being shuffled around a bit,<br/>
I was able to bring up that I was a 29th level Gnome that has been Tinkering<br/>
for quite a while and had sunk over 100 plat into getting ONE tick, and I<br/>
tought Tinkering skill was broke or messed up.  He said he heard of cases<br/>
that 10,000 Plat was needed to get a point, I kinda lost it there and called<br/>
EQ many names we can&#39;t say in public (but not to him, just to EQ, not a good<br/>
idea to piss of a Guide  ;)<br/>
<br/>
So, I wanted to see if there were any Gnomes that did get their skill up,<br/>
and if so how?  You can check to see if your skill has moved from its base<br/>
50 by going to your skills and checking to see if it is still &quot;Below<br/>
Average&quot; or not, as average stats at 51.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to find a pattern here, GM said Tinkering not broken, I say it is<br/>
from what I have seen on my character, and from listening to others.<br/>
