I am very intersted in knowing what this staff does or<br/>
is like.  I know there is a skull that you can obtain<br/>
for a quest that has two open slots in it, where you<br/>
can place them in the skull and hit combine.  Now, I<br/>
assume the quest is for the ruby eyes and I forget<br/>
what and who it is for.  However, wouldn&#39;t it be nice<br/>
if you could place the two staff parts into the slots<br/>
and combine to make a staff of discord?  That&#39;s just a<br/>
high hope.<br/>
<br/>
Would the staff of discord be &quot;tinkered&quot; or &quot;smithed&quot;?<br/>
  Most weapons are smithed, and tinkering is competely<br/>
un-finished and bugged.  So it is hard to say.<br/>

&gt; First the King of Akanon is a Gnomish Enchanter.  He<br/>
&gt; usually has the human<br/>
&gt; illusion spell active.  Second,  While I haven&#39;t yet<br/>
&gt; obtained the staff of<br/>
&gt; writhing, I do have its stats.  Hmmm must be at<br/>
&gt; home.  Well I can&#39;t remember<br/>
&gt; damage/delay but the effect is &quot;casts chaotic<br/>
&gt; feedback&quot;.   This is NOT the staff<br/>
&gt; of the Priest of Discord.  He carries the Staff of<br/>
&gt; Discord.<br/>
