&gt;Subject: Thermal cloak idea<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had this idea while re-reading the instuctions as to make a Thermal Cloak.<br/>
&gt;Maybe we need to combine a few objects (Like FireWater and Belt) to create<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a new<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;object (maybe &quot;fuel belt&quot; or something) to be used in the final construction<br/>
&gt;(I.E. fuel belt, rods and tattered cloak)- The way it&#39;s phrased in the tome<br/>
&gt;insinuates that. I&#39;ll try it tonight.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dunno what to say about the belts...  its either a component problem like a<br/>
gnome tattered cloak isn&#39;t a patchwork cloak, or it could be another item<br/>
is needed in the formula like a needle or something, or its just flat out<br/>
broken.  =(<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really peeved about it though, it was something I wanted to make as it<br/>
sounded kind of cool.  <br/>
