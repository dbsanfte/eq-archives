<div id="ygrps-yiv-788107366">Any word on the gemcutter? Has anyone yet to try the grease,<br/>
gemcutter, bar and gem? Where can these patterns that don&#39;t work for<br/>
anyone be aquired hell I will try it if no one else will I hope that<br/>
the Cutter is worth while unlike the majority of tinkered stuff. If<br/>
it is in anyway akin to fireworks I will be upset:) As for the<br/>
expansion I have heard there will be three underwater dungons I hope<br/>
against hope that this is fact and not fiction. <br/>
