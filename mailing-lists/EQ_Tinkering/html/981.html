<div id="ygrps-yiv-735748807">Today I also made gnomish fireworks. I was a little pissed that they<br/>
totally suck so I petitioned a GM. He went ahead and summoned the items to<br/>
make fireworks and made some. The reply I got from him after he tried them<br/>
out was &quot;That totally sucked! I shall see to it that the game developers get<br/>
a nice little letter concearning gnomish fireworks&quot;. So I hope this helps. I<br/>
think that all of you should petition in game about the firewors sucking.<br/>
Maybe they will feel sorry for us little old gnomes and decide to make the<br/>
fireworks look better. The more petitions they get, the better the chances<br/>
of that happening. I&#39;m crossing my fingers.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been wanting this formula for a long time, and Luke has been looking<br/>
&gt; even longer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3 rods and some gnomish bolts<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; go figure eh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Interesting to note, I went through the database and noticed someone had<br/>
&gt; tried 2 rods and gnomish bolts, that was the closest anyone came.  I think<br/>
&gt; I&#39;l keep the excel format of the database though, just as a tribute to all<br/>
&gt; those who tried or emailed me or submitted info in one way or another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was disappointed in the fireworks to, I mean, one little teeny tiny PFFT<br/>
&gt; and thats it?  I guess if you have 20 or 30 people and they all go PFFT at<br/>
&gt; the same time that might be kind of nice, but I&#39;d be embarassed to show up<br/>
&gt; at a wedding, promise everyone a gnomish fireworks display, and all I get<br/>
&gt; is a PFFT.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I got my pole, and after 3 attempts I got a spyglass, so I&#39;m a happy<br/>
&gt; gnome now, I&#39;ll tinker myself some bait and go fishing at the pool in<br/>
&gt; qeynos.  Maybe I&#39;ll get lucky and fish up a Kiolindl fish.  heh heh<br/>
