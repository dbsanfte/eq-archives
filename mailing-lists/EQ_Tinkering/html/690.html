<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I found, on the ground, an item called An old silver coin. It looked like a normal <br/>
&gt;silver coin, but it was an actual item. The strangest thing, though was that <br/>
&gt;it was a MAGIC ITEM, a LORE ITEM, AND...NO DROP! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not that I try to discourage you, but the coin is supposed to be for the Enchanter quest for a high level spell, Tashania.<br/>
The coins have only been in the game for about three weeks, so I doubt that they have anything to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
But the Idea of searching under water sounds possible, I mean, how many people have actually been in places like Kedge Keep...<br/>
<br/>
So, keep on searching.<br/>
