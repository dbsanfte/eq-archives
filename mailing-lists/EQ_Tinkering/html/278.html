<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683522169">I can answer that one without even seeing them.  A<br/>
telescope works similar to a ranger (?) spell (can&#39;t<br/>
remember the name of it).  It essentially &#39;zooms&#39; the<br/>
screen so that you can see things farther away from<br/>
you that you normally couldn&#39;t see.  (Is that train of<br/>
orcs still chasing me? Hmm better try the telescope.)<br/>

The collaspable fishing rod is just a regular fishing<br/>
pole that will fit in your bakpack - as it stands now,<br/>
a normal fishingpole you buy at a merchant will not<br/>
fit into any pack making it cumbersome to bring with<br/>
you on the road.<br/>
