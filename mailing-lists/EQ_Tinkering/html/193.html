<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lets find Bidl Frugin <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860524414">I can&#39;t believe that if Bidl Frugin is in the Steamfont cave, that he would <br/>
be too deep.<br/>
This quest is supposed to be completed by level 12s or maybe up to <br/>
16.  Those guards are level 40 or so, i hear, and Meldrath charms.  If he <br/>
spawned, it would be near where the other slaves are.  I did see a mob in <br/>
there though.  Can&#39;t remember his name, Londoor or something.  I&#39;ve seen <br/>
him walking through Steamfont attacking rogue clocks.  He ignored me when i <br/>
hailed and walked straight into the mine.<br/>

&gt;Hmm, good idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a few thoughts on this as well.  Bidl Frugin may indeed be located in<br/>
&gt;the Steamfont Mino&#39;s cave.  I have a feeling that the guards may whack him as<br/>
&gt;soon as he spawns, much like Bandits will kill Giant Spiders and Bears in the<br/>
&gt;Karanas.  Not sure about this, but its a thought.  Secondly, is the lens quest<br/>
&gt;class specific?  What generic gnome quests exist out there?  Brewing is<br/>
&gt;another trade skill that is very quest related, so I think that this is a good<br/>
&gt;avenue to pursue.<br/>
