<div id="ygrps-yiv-285448712">Sort of a perhaps, maybe, I dunno, but could be a dumb question. =)  Has<br/>
anyone else noticed if they get faster skill advances when they are sitting?<br/>
I sure seem to.  I sit, put my items in my toolbox and combine.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
done any scientific research, it&#39;s just my perception and wonder if anyone<br/>
else has had the same luck.  And no, I haven&#39;t turned clockwise three times<br/>
and point north prior to sitting down yet, but maybe I&#39;ll give that a shot,<br/>
too. =)<br/>
