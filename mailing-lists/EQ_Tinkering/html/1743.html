<div id="ygrps-yiv-618530406">I was readin a post, I discounted it as major B.S. but checked it out <br/>
regardless since I was in Ak&#39;anon. It mentioned somethin bout a clockwork <br/>
dragon, now the dragon, I don&#39;t believe, not by a longhshot. But it also <br/>
mentioned one of those lamp, star light post things, and when ya click it, it <br/>
makes a door opening sound and turns 90 degrees. I thought that it was worth <br/>
2 seconds investigation, so I found the one that wasn&#39;t soinning next to the <br/>
lake. I clicked it, and sure enough, it turned bout 90 degrees, and I heard <br/>
the door creak. I have no idea what this is about, knowing my luck, this <br/>
little topic has popped up on the list before, but I&#39;m a recent addition to <br/>
it. If it has, GOOD! someone please fill me in and quench my curiosity. If it <br/>
hasn&#39;t, anyone have any ideas what it is, cause who knows, what if it has <br/>
valid importance, this is a long shot, but it may have somethin to with <br/>
diamond dust. I know I know, there&#39;s a bunch of you thinking I&#39;m prime full <br/>
of it, but about the little door creak and star lamp thing, I&#39;m not, I invite <br/>
you to see it yourself. Anyways, I jus thought I&#39;d toss that one out there. <br/>
If it&#39;s been brought up before, forgive me for my insolence.<br/>
