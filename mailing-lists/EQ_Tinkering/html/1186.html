<b>Subject:</b> Both Books on merchant on Test server <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-491383989">Ok guys, here&#39;s the info we all have been looking for.  On the Test server<br/>
in Ak&#39;anon there is a new merchant by the big cascading waterfall next to a<br/>
mechanic (the water area between the cleric/rouge house and the tunnel to<br/>
the water wheel area).  He is selling the XI book (aka Colapsable Fishing<br/>
Pole Book) and the XXXIII book (aka the aqualung and rebreather book)  He<br/>
also has a few other tinker components on him.  I have both books now.  I<br/>
don&#39;t have time to get the new book and post it on the web,  But I am sure<br/>
with this info, Gnomad will have it on his page shortly.  CURRENTLY, THE NEW<br/>
TINKERING ITEMS CAN ONLY BE MADE ON THE TEST SERVER.  So, stop wasting your<br/>
cash/time on finding items.  All the items needed for the tinkering items<br/>
are in the windmills and the new merchant.  Also, some strange items like a<br/>
medium sized plate helmut and a &quot;live Fish&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Tinkering guys =)<br/>
