One minor detail needs to be attended to, and thats finding this third<br/>
book, just for the sake of completely wrapping up this mystery, and putting<br/>
everything to rest.  According to latest rumors its in Steamfont somewhere...<br/>
<br/>
Then secondly I think all the gnomes from this one-list, and those who post<br/>
on eq.stratics.com and anyone else who was ever interested in this mystery<br/>
should pick a server, and get together in Akanon and have a good ole<br/>
fashion drunken fishing festival!<br/>
<br/>
Complete with high diving at the great wheel, and lots of just general<br/>
&quot;Gnoming about&quot;.<br/>
