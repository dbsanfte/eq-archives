<div id="ygrps-yiv-744660938">The sunken ship you refer too is not in it&#39;s own zone.  It&#39;s in Erud&#39;s<br/>
Crossing and spawns zombie sailors.  One of them drops the &quot;blurred map&quot;<br/>
used for a quest.  None of them drop any tinkering info, nor is there a<br/>
book anywhere on the ship as I have thoroughly serached it.<br/>

&gt; &gt;The shark I found was due south of the &#39;sisters&#39; isle and conned green<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;me at 34. Its probably in the mid to high 20&#39;s. It didnt attack me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That was the only monster I found underwater so far, except perhaps for<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;few wading cyclops =).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;FizzWizz&quot; of tunare<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve managed to piece this together from a lot of rumors... for all of<br/>
&gt; you <br/>
&gt; out there with a Fishbone Earring or such.... go to the sisters isle in <br/>
&gt; OOT.... have someone find the dwarves at the forge (located on the isle)<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; click on one of the bags located there (heard one is a secret button)...<br/>
&gt; you <br/>
&gt; should hear a grating noise... the person with the earring should search<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; under the water for an open secret passage that should be open now...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, I heard there&#39;s a sunken ship somewhere possibly within the OOT or<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Erud&#39;s Crossing that is it&#39;s own zone. Perhaps one of these suggestions<br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; what we seek?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again - I based all this off of various rumors I heard and pieced<br/>
&gt; together, <br/>
&gt; plus the clue &quot;search under the waves&quot;.<br/>
