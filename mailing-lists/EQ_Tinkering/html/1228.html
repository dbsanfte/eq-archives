<div id="ygrps-yiv-787037599">Has anybody ever confirmed clockwork pets?  I&#39;ve always been under the<br/>
impression that this was a rumor.  Back in beta 3 they mentioned that plans<br/>
to allow clockwork pets had been scrapped.  I never saw any in beta 2 so I<br/>
assumed that meant they&#39;d never had any at all.<br/>

some kewl stuff to make.  Now if only they would put back in the Jet Pack,<br/>
and the pet rat/spider/gnome.</div>
