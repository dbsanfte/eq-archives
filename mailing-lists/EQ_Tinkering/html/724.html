&gt;Hey guys,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If the clue was to look below waves, and before it was stated that a<br/>
&gt;Barbarian Shaman would do the exploring, what about the lake outside of<br/>
&gt;Halas?  Has that already been brought up?  If need be, I can take my<br/>
&gt;Magician up there and poke around?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I heard that on the Isle of Sisterhood, there&#39;s a secret button you push and <br/>
you can hear grating stone once pushed. No one knows exactly what it does. <br/>
Somewhere (EQ stratics perhaps?) I read an interview with Brad McQuaid. In <br/>
this interview, Brad hinted at the button opening a secret passage to a <br/>
dungeon that located under the water near the island. This dungeon was <br/>
supposed to have very good loot, but is also supposed to be guarded well. I <br/>
don&#39;t know firsthand if this is true or not, (one can never tell with Verant <br/>
anyhow) because I&#39;ve never personally been there to check it out. So it all <br/>
very well may be just rumor. But if it isn&#39;t, it may be a very good lead.</div>
