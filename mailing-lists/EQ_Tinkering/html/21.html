<div id="ygrps-yiv-727471846">I believe you can&#39;t Tinker at all until level 16. Books are cheap, 2gp or<br/>
something<br/>
Toolbox? can&#39;t remember 2-5pp or something.<br/>
<br/>
Infravision goggles? Well, I don&#39;t know that any of us have found the book to<br/>
make those yet. It&#39;s not in either book I have.<br/>

&gt; WOOHOO,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m Really excited to here some people are successfully tinkering.  I&#39;ve just<br/>
&gt; reached level 9 myself, and finished buying all the 3rd circle spells that I<br/>
&gt; need.  Tinkering is now my next goal.  I have a few questions though. At what<br/>
&gt; level will your tinkering skills improve.  I haven&#39;t been back to my homeland<br/>
&gt; in a while and I was wondering how much the toolkit and the first book cost.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Same here.. made the Flameless Lantern last night myself.  Glad to finally<br/>
&gt; &gt; see something happen with tinkering!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok, so after the solution for Firewater was given<br/>
&gt; &gt; to me, I tried Tinkering the stuff, simple. Worked<br/>
&gt; &gt; every time. Then I tried the only item that I could afford and tada, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; first(in the game I think) Flameless Lantern (gave it away) then two<br/>
&gt; &gt; failures. But all in all I made 3. They seem to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; at least as bright as Lightstone, possibly brighter, but being a Gnome, what<br/>
&gt; &gt; do I need it for? :) But it&#39;s been done. Tinkering works.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Going to put in my order for Pie Tins and start<br/>
&gt; &gt; making Compasses. And as soon as I find a tattered<br/>
&gt; &gt; cloak, it&#39;s Thermal Cloak time. Man I need more money.<br/>
