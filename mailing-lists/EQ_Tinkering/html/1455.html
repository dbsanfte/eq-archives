<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554998590">Has anyone tried making a super firework out of the 4 smaller fireworks?<br/>
Theres nothing in game to indicate that there is one, but I&#39;&#39;ve tried a few<br/>
combinations nonetheless...<br/>
<br/>
Fwk1 + Fwk2 + Fwk3 + Fwk4<br/>
 as above + metal twine.<br/>
<br/>
Just interested to see if anyone else has tried anything :)<br/>
