<b>Subject:</b> Collapsable Pole Theories <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-379647398">I notice that no one has experimented with any of the strings you can buy<br/>
from fletcher merchants.  They sell three different kinds of twine and<br/>
string and they are very cheap, something like a few silver or copper each.<br/>
 So I&#39;m revising my theory of the pole as being something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Some shafts maybe two or three or more<br/>
A type of twine - possibly from fletcher merchants<br/>
possibly some grease<br/>
possibly some rods<br/>
cork anyone?<br/>
<br/>
Another hint we get is that the fishing pole works on a telescoping<br/>
concept, we can infer this since in the recipe book, the spy glass is<br/>
confused with a fishing pole.  So if its a telescoping kind of action, that<br/>
implies it uses shafts, possibly several.  The book also mentions, &quot;The<br/>
extra rod provides support&quot;.  This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean there is a rod<br/>
in the recipie, in fact, I believe this implies that the collapsable pole<br/>
is so flimsy that it cannot support the weight of a bottle, reflective<br/>
shard and twine modification without extra support from a rod.  Which I<br/>
think is further support for the shaft theory.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another I noticed is that the spyglass picture kind of looks like a fishing<br/>
pole in reverse.  Its as if the reflective shard and bottle are kind of<br/>
either tied on or connected to the handle part of the fishing pole.  The<br/>
extra rod helps support this modification to the collapsable pole.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought I&#39;ve had is that the pole shouldn&#39;t be to expensive to<br/>
make, since its needed to make a spyglass which is also expensive to make.<br/>
The reflective shard alone is 16 plat!  So I&#39;d estimate the pole to be in<br/>
the &#39;cheap&#39; range of around 3 to 5 plat to make.  Similar in cost to the<br/>
compass and flameless lantern.  We should also consider that the recipie<br/>
may not have  been changed any since beta, that being the case, the old<br/>
tool boxes has 4 slots in them, so its possible that the formula only has 4<br/>
things.  On the other hand there are several formulas that have 5 items in<br/>
them, 5 seems to be the max that anything has.<br/>
<br/>
Well.. thats just my guess at the moment.  Sometime I&#39;ll make the database<br/>
into a real database, right now its just a bunch of tables, but it would be<br/>
neat to have it on excel so that people can sort/search out different<br/>
recipies.  But at the moment I&#39;m up to about 230 known recipes that don&#39;t<br/>
work.  So at least if you can print it out, it can help you avoid spending<br/>
cash on things that others already know don&#39;t work.<br/>
