<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067438377">Thats a bunch of bull since the King cons me kindly. You can raise faction <br/>
higher than amiable<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Amiable is the highest faction<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know about it being a quest.  I have killed hundreds upon <br/>
&gt;hundreds<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Minotaurs, I have killed Meldrath many times, and I have also killed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; minotaur guards. Yet my faction with King Akanon isn&#39;t warm.  It maybe<br/>
&gt;because I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am a necro and there is a certain cap to faction, I really don&#39;t know. </span></blockquote></div>
