<b>Subject:</b> Has tinkering been changed? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-168363222">This morning, I finally decided to try some tinkering.  Hey, what the heck, things are starting to work, so perhaps some things<br/>
have changed (actually I really wanted to create that spyglass). Anyhow, this is what I found out.<br/>
<br/>
1)  You cannot train any additional points to tinkering.  I&#39;m level 31 and have never trained in tinkering before.  When I<br/>
tried this morning, I got the message about going out in the field and trying it.  So, I had to start out at 50.<br/>
<br/>
2)  The Collapsable Fishing Pole is trivial at 53.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Flameless Lanterns are trivial at 54 (I know, Gnomad list them trivial at 60 something, but not anymore).<br/>
<br/>
4)  To raise my skill anymore, it costs 15pp per try (the cams).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of a cheaper way to raise skill?  At 15pp per try, I spent about 300pp to raise two points.  Talk about an<br/>
expensive habit.  For those kind of rates, I could become a jeweler and at least they have a market.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, last question.  Does the spyglass have charges?<br/>
<br/>
All come to us eventually,<br/>
