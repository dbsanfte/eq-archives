<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439356632">the charges issue that was brought up before...that is an old bug that <br/>
effected staves of the observer and ..well..just about ALL charged <br/>
items...looks like they have another &quot;patch&quot; to make now ;p ...so <br/>
anyways...a friend tested the Lung yesterday...50 charges of an effect that <br/>
lasts ALMOST 30 MINUTES! ppl WILL buy Lungs...AND to top it off...they can <br/>
use say, 49 of the charges and THEN get a rebreather (supplying their old <br/>
aqua lung for the finished product) so basically rebreathers can just be <br/>
&quot;upgrades&quot;.&quot; personally i think this is really cool ;) AND it gives us a <br/>
chance to make good cash and have a satisfied cuztomer base while postponing <br/>
the inevitable &quot;upgrade&quot; everyone is gonna want so we can actually get our <br/>
skill lvl high enough to create the rebreather :)<br/>
