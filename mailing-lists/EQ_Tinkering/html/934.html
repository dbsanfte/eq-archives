<div id="ygrps-yiv-979204475">How do you know Josh? Are you one of Verant&#39;s game designers, planners,<br/>
programmers, or developers?  Are you related to any of them and they have told<br/>
you this is a fact?  Or are you as ignorant as the rest of us and just going by<br/>
what someone told you?<br/>
There are enough rumors and disinformation about the 3rd book, collapsible<br/>
fishing pole, and fireworks going around that I wonder if anyone on any server<br/>
really has solid information.  Until I recieve some word by an Everquest<br/>
programmer or developer I&#39;m keeping my mind open.<br/>
Don&#39;t count any information you have been told by the guides or GM&#39;s as<br/>
factual.  None of them created this game.<br/>

&gt; What will it take to get it through to you guys? There is NO damn third<br/>
&gt; book, ANY formulas for items that have been figured out how to be made, if<br/>
&gt; any at all were figured out by trial and error. There is absolutely NO BOOK!<br/>
&gt; NONE not -ANYWHERE- in the game! When there IS something will be said about<br/>
&gt; it in the patch. Until then , just work on raising your tinkering skill,<br/>
&gt; thats all I can say, doing anything else about tinkering, like trying to<br/>
&gt; find a non-existant book, or trying to figure out a formula with next to<br/>
&gt; nothing odds is just a TOTAL 100% waste of time!<br/>
