<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399106909">I don&#39;t know if this has any relevency, but I was talking to a GM in Ak&#39;Anon <br/>
next to one of the clock work spiders, and we all know what happens when you <br/>
hail them right? They say something to the effect of:<br/>
&quot;This unit is not designed for casual conversation. Please move along.&quot;<br/>
Well, when I was done talking to the GM he said Good night to me before he <br/>
left. The spider said his usual message about moving along. I said good <br/>
night to the GM and the spider said it again. All the spiders respond to <br/>
&quot;Good night.&quot; in the same way. This could mean abolutely nothing, but I just <br/>
though it was odd.</div>
