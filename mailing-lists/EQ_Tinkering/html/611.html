<b>Subject:</b> The gnome spelunker <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037165691">According to the dictionary a &quot;Spelunker&quot; means an explorer of caves. <br/>
The other day I went down to take a peek at him with my rogue. He had company of a RED skeleton monk, so I didnt go near, but he conned white (or black) to me, and he was indifferent. If someone could get rid of the undeads near to him, without angering him, one could make a try at hailing him. <br/>
The spelunker is most likely a necro, but does someone know anything about his class as a fact? And has any necro tried to communicate with him?<br/>
And for the ones who has killed this guy, what does he drop?<br/>
