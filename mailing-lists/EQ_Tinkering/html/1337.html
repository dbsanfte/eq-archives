<b>Subject:</b> Fireworks and skill <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-735772984">I have a quick question about fireworks.   I have been able to tinker<br/>
them at level 21 with no problem.  However, they are a pathetic <br/>
ight to behold. All I see when I use them is a little flash of <br/>
colored light move away from me for about a quarter of a second.  <br/>
I read a post though a while back of someone describing a very neat <br/>
firework effect.  Can anyone please confirm this?  Also, I talked to <br/>
a couple GMs on Erollisi Marr and the information I gathered is <br/>
that gnomish fireworks are not even listed as being broken and that<br/>
there is therefore no ETA on fixing them.  This really bothers me <br/>
because they could be a very interesting item in terms of role-<br/>
playing.  Would anyone out there be interested in them enough to <br/>
start a petition?  I know there are more worth-while things to <br/>
petition about, but this is one thing that could actually be <br/>
fixed quite easily if Verant knew that there were enough people <br/>
out there that wanted these to work right.<br/>
<br/>
Also, at one point at Gnomad&#39;s web site it says that your tinkering<br/>
skill cannot increase until level 16.  But then he has a chart and <br/>
equation posted that show your skill cannot break 50 until level <br/>
26.  I have also read in other places that the skill for <br/>
tinkering is (5 * lvl) or (5 * lvl) - 5, which would mean that at <br/>
22 my skill could be 60 or 55, breaking 50 at 16 or 16, <br/>
respectively.  Can a number of people please confirm one of these<br/>
equations?  I&#39;ve already spent quite a bit of plat on non-trivial <br/>
items and I don&#39;t believe my skill has increased.  BTW the newer <br/>
equation at Gnomad&#39;s site is (5  * (lvl - 15)<br/>
<br/>
Any help is much appreciated<br/>
