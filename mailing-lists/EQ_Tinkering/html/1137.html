<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681949399">You also need to realize that Fishbone Earrings are very limited, Even with <br/>
Kedge Keep being Itemized, and people camp the mob that drops it, it is <br/>
still going to be limited.  I already have a slew of high levels waiting for <br/>
scuba gear.  And they are willing to pay quite a bit for it.  So don&#39;t think <br/>
we are out of the race yet.  If you were a high lvl sitting in the camp line <br/>
for Fishbone Earrings, and you saw a gnome sitting there saying, selling <br/>
Scuba Gear. Which would you choose? hehe..thought so..;-)<br/>
