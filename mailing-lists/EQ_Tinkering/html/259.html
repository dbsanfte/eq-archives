<br/>
The quest is fixed (I think).  The lense quest appears to be working again.  You can ask both of the observers who before told us to come back or we weren&#39;t experienced.  I now have the three lenses.  Also, if you go to Trudon (sp) he will tell you his brother (Bidl) is in Kelethin at nights in a tavern, and wandering around during the day.  I haven&#39;t found Bidl yet, but am hangin out in Kelethin looking for him!  Let me know if you find him, and where.  I also suspect that Trudon could have been wrong, and meant Kaladim, since that is where Bidl was on the test server.  Let me know what you guys find, I&#39;ll be looking tonite.<br/>
