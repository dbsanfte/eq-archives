<div id="ygrps-yiv-762217471">Ok folks lets get back to the topics at hand:) Gemcutter proposed<br/>
uses are the following: Used only in the sk quest to obtain a<br/>
facitaed hycanthe ( see fulcrums ), that it can be used to seperate<br/>
jewlery, that it can be used to modify already made jewlery ( which<br/>
personally i don&#39;t think would work but hey), that is can be used in<br/>
the construction of magical armor ( because the blacksmith box got 2<br/>
extra slots about the same time the gemcutter was introduced) or that<br/>
it is used with pattern&#39;s not used in anything else to make cut<br/>
stones. If you have any input right in I have a gemcutter and have<br/>
more diamond dust I just want to get some feedback which seems more<br/>
likely to everyone else. <br/>
