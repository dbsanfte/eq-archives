<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736291889">Has anyone ever heard of a gnome clockwork NPC called Cognoggin?  I was <br/>
leaving Steamfont and he was sitting right by the zone border in Lesser Fay. <br/>
  He conned blue to me at 18, and since he didn&#39;t respond to my hails, I <br/>
promptly killed him.  I was afraid that he would drop my faction with people <br/>
in Ak&#39;anon, but it dropped with fairies instead. All he had for loot was a <br/>
rusty short sword. I have never heard of him nor seen him before today, has <br/>
anyone else?<br/>
<br/>
Also, has there always been a gnome observitory in Lesser Fay? I don&#39;t ever <br/>
remember seeing it there.<br/>
