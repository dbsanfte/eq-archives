&gt;Heya guys,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like i said quite a while ago, the gnome named Salvadori on Xegony is the<br/>
&gt;one that has learned the secret of how to make the collapsable fishing<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;but is not willing to share the recipe.  He&#39;s only one who can make them<br/>
&gt;that I know of.  Just a reminder of that info for those of you that weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;on the board, or who don&#39;t remember.  Also, yes, he is not on very often<br/>
&gt;anymore.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I went ahead and talked to a gm and a bunch of higher level gnomes.  From<br/>
&gt;&gt; the high levels gnomes I got the impression that tinkering was a complete<br/>
&gt;&gt; and total waste of time.  In fact one told me he didn&#39;t do it because the<br/>
&gt;&gt; skill sucked and it wasn&#39;t worth it.  I did get a name from a high level<br/>
&gt;&gt; gnome who said he knew someone who used to tinker a lot.  He said the<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; name was salvadori or something like that and that he rarely came on.  He<br/>
&gt;&gt; does however come on every once in a while.  The other thing that I found<br/>
&gt;&gt; out, from the gm&#39;s, was that the skill is not broken.  I asked every gm<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;&gt; has been on for the past two nights and they all keep telling me it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;&gt; broken.  Well that&#39;s my search so far.<br/>
