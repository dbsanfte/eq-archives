<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120298151">Yes, i think checking the gnome city is Solusek is the next way to go.  I<br/>
was also thinking of killing some random people in Ak&#39;anon even if it does<br/>
totaly my faction there.  I&#39;d really like to see what is on the King&#39;s<br/>
body.  I know its a long shot but best I can think of.</div>
