<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063203623">Hi there!<br/>
 <br/>
I am getting set to begin my tinkering career.. and have been unable to<br/>
loacte any really informative sites about the trade. A fe that list basic<br/>
recipies of what seem to be useless things (not that thye describe the<br/>
functions much) but surely there are great things to make!<br/>
 <br/>
Any thoughts, clues, trivial lists, pointers, ideas.. etc would be great.<br/>
This list seems to be the best place so far that i have found. <br/>
 <br/>
Though that post about blowing 4000 plat in trying to make rebreathers is<br/>
scary..<br/>
