<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106310066">Ok here&#39;s my plan.. Someone find out where Brad McQuaid lives tie him up and interriogate him until he gives us the information. :)  Seriously though someone give me the guild name that supposedly has the recipe and I&#39;ll try to get into it.  You said it was on Xegony right?  I still think that the first way that I said would be much quicker and even more fun. :)<br/>
