a feeling the way skill lvls for trades is set up, it may be exactly like ones 
level, complete with hell levels.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t raised my tinkering skill very 
high yet, but with my primary character, I have my fletching skill to 135 
currently.&nbsp; During that time, I noticed that the level or two right before 
the trivial point of what I was working on would take a disproportionately high 
number of attempts to gain, and my success rate would be extremely low.&nbsp; 
Often just after trivializing something I would see fairly good success rates 
and skill increase on the next level of product.&nbsp; Perhaps this was a fluke 
with my observations, but maybe it explains some of the success ratios and 
maddeningly expensive skill point gains.&nbsp; Another thing I have noticed, 
which may be just my luck, is I seem to have a better success ratio and skill 
gain if my wisdom is higher than my int, regardless of how high they are.&nbsp; 
Higher int does seem to help skill gain to a good degree, but it really seemed 
that if I got my int higher than my wis, the skill gain would slow a bit, and my 
success ratio would go way down.&nbsp; Just some of my observations, take em 
with a grain of salt.</font></span></div>

    <tt>Madgrizzle &lt;MadGrizzle@...&gt;</tt> <br><br><tt>I think 
    it has to do with the skill level you are at.&nbsp; I suspect there may 
    <br>be &#39;hell&#39; levels you have to work through.&nbsp; I recently started to 
    tinker <br>with my character.&nbsp; I made flameless lanterns all the way to 
    68, then <br>switched to cams.&nbsp; I did 8 at a time with the cams.&nbsp; 
    The first batch, I was <br>6 for 8.&nbsp; The next batch, I was 8 for 
    8.&nbsp; I was at skill 74 after that (75 <br>is trivial).&nbsp; I then went 
    1 for 6 getting that last point.&nbsp; I&#39;ve begun <br>making stalking probes 
    since they are cheaper to make than the <br>spyglasses.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have 
    firm stats on it, but I did 50% for about 10, <br>then went on a 1 for 6 
    streak, then back to 50% again for the next 4.&nbsp; I <br>suspect there may 
    be some sticking points you have to work through (for <br>example, skill 
    level of 73 might bring more successes than 74).&nbsp;&nbsp; I know it 
    <br>seems odd, but its either that, or I had a run of bad luck.&nbsp; BTW, 
    nothing <br>changed during any of the attempts, 109 wisdom, 140 
    intelligence.<br><br>Atiny of Bristlebane<br>16th Enchanter<br>~80 tinkering
