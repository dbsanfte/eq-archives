<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-4637172">GM appeared in Lower Guk last night on Fennin Ro. I asked him for a moment of<br/>
his time and he agreed. I mentioned tinkering to him and all the people that are<br/>
frustrated right now. He said he knew nothing personally and said he would ask<br/>
around. He then reported back that tinkering IS indeed broken. It is a known<br/>
issue and he suggested we be very persistant in our feedback and petitions until<br/>
it is fixed or an anouncement is made saying that it will not be fixed etc. He<br/>
also said that as far as he knows there IS NOT a 3rd tinkering book. Take this<br/>
information as you would any GM info. Could be BS but he did seem sympathetic.<br/>
