<b>Subject:</b> Tinkering items need to be made stackable <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-103693131">If everyone could send feedback while in the game that many of the Tinkering<br/>
items found in the Windmill need to be made stackable.  Come on, CORKS not<br/>
stackable?  And bolts, maybe wire, lots of stuff.  I know it has been a pain<br/>
for me to have to go back for a simple CORK that was not stackable.<br/>
<br/>
This minor change is possible, if enough people ask for it.<br/>
