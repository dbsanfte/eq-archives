<b>Subject:</b> Re: Combinations for that fishing pole = 1,287 are possible (?) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-910399456">Guys, you aren&#39;t really being realistic here. You say that there is a <br/>
certain amout of items that we can use to make it, what are you saying? <br/>
Thats it&#39;s 13? Let&#39;s just say we decided that only 4 slots are used to make <br/>
it, even then, you can&#39;t make any acurate calculation of the amount of <br/>
combinations there are, I mean, I dout we will be using grease, sprockets, <br/>
gnomish bolts, and gears to be making the fishing pole. We probably have to <br/>
have some kind of rod or shaft too, and with your calulations, you are <br/>
inluding various of those useless combinations, that we can probably guess <br/>
wouldn&#39;t make the pole. You are just going to have to face the fact that we <br/>
just have to keep trying, or find some alternate way of learning the recipe, <br/>
so no amount of calculations are going to help us much unless you aply them <br/>
in a practical way, so you should stop wasting your time. That is all I have <br/>
to say for now.<br/>

&gt;oops...yer right...i was doin permutations...shoulda been divide instead o&#39;<br/>
&gt;subtract...did it right on the calculator at least :)<br/>
&gt;but since we can repeat items, i seem to recall that we don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt;combinations or permutations...<br/>
&gt;any slot could have any of the 13 items, regardless of the other slots, so<br/>
&gt;we get the slightly less nice number of 13^8=815,730,721<br/>
&gt;or if we assume, as some have suggested, that it worked with the old 4 slot<br/>
&gt;toolbox, 13^4=28561 possibilities<br/>
&gt;that sound right to those with more recent education or more convenient<br/>
&gt;reference materials?<br/>

&gt;&gt;*digs out the statistics book*<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;I knew that I kept this thing around for some reason.  *grin*<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;They are unorderd (it doesn&#39;t matter which slot you place that rat ear <br/>
&gt;&gt;at),<br/>
&gt;&gt;so, they are combinations. Way to go Xillitil.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Formula:  nCr = n!/[r!(n-r)!]<br/>
&gt;&gt;     n = items we have to play with (12 here - we think)<br/>
&gt;&gt;     r = the set (8 spots in this case)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;But an empty slot counts as an item too, so we need to count an additional<br/>
&gt;&gt;one for our number of items.<br/>
&gt;&gt;         13C8    = 13!/[8!(13-8)!]<br/>
&gt;&gt;                     =    6,227,020,800 / [40,320(120)]<br/>
&gt;&gt;                     =    6,227,020,800 / [4,838,400]<br/>
&gt;&gt;                     =    1,287<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;As you can tell, my professors were big fans of &#39;Show Your Work&#39;.  *grins*<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;But, at least it isn&#39;t some way the heck out there number - thank <br/>
&gt;&gt;goodness.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Oh, other factors too, that will decrease our combinations.  We know that<br/>
&gt;&gt;certain items are not useable.  ie.  We know it will take more than one<br/>
&gt;&gt;metal rod (or any other given item).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;m currently working on all listing all those darn combinations.  Eww...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;It shall be ours soon.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hello everyone on this list.  I&#39;m new to the list, just signed up <br/>
&gt;&gt;today.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  Anyway this is a question for any mathematic wizards out there.  We have<br/>
&gt;&gt;a total of 8 slots in the toolbox and a total of 12 items to use.  Does<br/>
&gt;&gt;anyone know how many combinations that we can come up with?  Remember that<br/>
&gt;&gt;this includes just having 1 item in the box or 2 or 3 etc. etc.  Well me<br/>
&gt;&gt;personally I would just like to know for curiousity sake.  And don&#39;t worry<br/>
&gt;&gt;you now have another helping hand in the search for the collapsable <br/>
&gt;&gt;fishing<br/>
&gt;&gt;pole recipie. :)<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Mike<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; P.S. If we do find it imagine how much it can sell for. :) $$$$$$$$<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; uhh...if i remember my math right,8 slots and 13 items(including empty)<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; should be 13! - 5!...ummm...51,891,840 combinations...or is that<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; permutations...and thats assuming we don&#39;t use anything less obvious<br/>
&gt;&gt;like<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; skins or something...<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; guess we won&#39;t be doing an exhaustive search anytime soon....<br/>
