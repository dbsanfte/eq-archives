&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, the Observer staff is ANOTHER lens quest, not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the spare lens one. But the DE in Freeport, I&#39;ve never found.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I hear that people have found her, killed her and gotten the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lens. I&#39;m sure I can kill her, but I can&#39;t find her.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just happened across her and killed her and got that lens. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t however have any of the other ones and now when I ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; about the quest I get a message saying you are too high level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does it say who&#39;s lens it is, or does it just say a telescope lens? You<br/>
&gt; might be able to kill her 5 times and get enough lenses to complete the<br/>
&gt; quest. I saw her when I went to Freeport. She is in the thieves guild. I<br/>
&gt; thought killing her might work, but I was about 5th level at the time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It just says &quot;telescope lens&quot; and is stackable. I guess I could <br/>
just kill her 4 times and hand over the lenses and see what <br/>
happens. Never thought about that.<br/>
