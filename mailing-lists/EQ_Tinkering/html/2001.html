&gt;Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] Deflated Gnome :)<br/>

&gt;Hi all :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Today I boldly agreed to make a full set of large banded for a troll for<br/>
&gt;90pp.  I soon discovered the problems..  Firstly, he had to go and get the<br/>
&gt;molds from The Feerrott, cuz the Freeport shop only has medium molds.<br/>
&gt;Apparently there is no forge down there.  Secondly, it&#39;s nearly impossible<br/>
&gt;for me (skill 110 ish) to make about four of the banded armour pieces.<br/>
&gt;Thirdly, failures cost between 4pp and 6pp.  After three trips to the<br/>
&gt;Feerrott for the troll, and literally hours of real time, I had made his<br/>
&gt;banded at a loss to me of 100pp.  Oh, and I gained 2 points of skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ah well, I&#39;ll stick to jewellery and Steins I think.  I made the 100pp back<br/>
&gt;in 1/2 hour from jewellery, and then sold a Stein for 300pp :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Who cares?  That isn&#39;t tinkering, and failures cost me more than it cost you <br/>
for an entire set of banded.  Quit whining, tinerers lose over 200plat on <br/>
failed aqua lungs and over 900plat on failed rebreathers.<br/>
<br/>
