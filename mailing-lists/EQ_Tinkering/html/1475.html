<div id="ygrps-yiv-934249369">ok, this isn&#39;t a bash on anyone, but ready this guys posts just makes me <br/>
laugh, he appears to have all this knowledge about tinkering and the pets <br/>
then the next post he says &quot;charmed the executioner cuz he had an axe&quot; ? i <br/>
dont&#39; think so, first of all you can&#39;t charm if you have a pet/animation, or <br/>
ppl could make multiple animations, and secondly the ghoul exec has no <br/>
animation for when he holds the axe.  so you couldn&#39;t possible have seen <br/>
it...<br/>
<br/>
you just lost all your credibility man<br/>
