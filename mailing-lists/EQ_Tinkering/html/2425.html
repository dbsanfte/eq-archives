<b>Subject:</b> When to try something else? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-845384714">I just hit 102 skill in tinkering tonite and made some Powered Gloves<br/>
(woohoo!).  The next major item I&#39;d like to make for myself is the<br/>
Footwarming boots.  Apparently the trivial for footwarming is around the 168<br/>
mark.<br/>
<br/>
At what skill level will I have like a 25% chance of even accomplishing this<br/>
item?  Obviously I&#39;ll continue making Powered Gloves until the trivial mark<br/>
at 122, and then trying aqualungs.  Aqualungs&#39;s trivial is 148, which takes<br/>
me close to the ~168 trivial of Footwarming boots.  However, I&#39;d like to try<br/>
the boots earlier on if there&#39;s a chance for success.  However, I don&#39;t know<br/>
the formula for a chance of success being &quot;x&quot; number of skill points away<br/>
from the trivial point of the item you&#39;re trying to tinker.<br/>
<br/>
Soooooo....  I&#39;m at 102 now.  What skill level can I being trying to make<br/>
Footwarming boots with somewhere around a 25% chance of success?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any idea?  Thanks if you do. :)<br/>
