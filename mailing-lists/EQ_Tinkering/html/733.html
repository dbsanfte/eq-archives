<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035510019">I would just like to say that every quest ecept the high level ones that i <br/>
seen thus far have not been far fro the point of where it originated. I very <br/>
much doubt if the 3rd book does exist that it would be more than a 1-3 zones <br/>
away. Try keeping the search if any .......more local to Akanons Contient of <br/>
Faydwer. Acording to the map there is 3 lakes to explore on this continent <br/>
one in Dagnors Cauldron (unlikey) , Wayunder Lake, and Elizerain <br/>
lake......Besides that there is some water in the greater fairdark section <br/>
(Looks like part of a river) if i do beleive  to be correct I would start my <br/>
search there and work outwards to other ajacent zones.   Cloverleaf &lt;Fennin <br/>
