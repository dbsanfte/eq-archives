<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787864204">Recently, I was walking through Ak&#39;Anon, searching the merchants, when a<br/>
<br/>
couple of thoughts struck me.<br/>
<br/>
1. Robes are merely Cloaks with belts, if you think about it. Perhaps<br/>
Gimblestan used a Robe in his construction of the Thermal Cloak, and<br/>
that is why the Tattered Gnomish Cloak and belt are not two seperate<br/>
components. Also, most of the newbie robes have names like &#39;Singed&#39;,<br/>
&#39;Old Torn&#39;, etc... perhaps one of the newbie robes from one of the<br/>
guilds is a &#39;Tattered&#39; Robe, and it would be considered gnomish because<br/>
only gnomes can use it?<br/>
<br/>
2. Also, when I was recently shopping at one of the merchants in the<br/>
Library, I saw this item. (see attachment). Mantles can also be<br/>
considered cloaks...<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,<br/>
Rzech the Tinker<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Attachment is too big to send with this message, I will send it<br/>
seperately</div>
