<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227446730">Well, Lindell said to search beneath the waves, so maybe there is a secret <br/>
cave under some water somewhere. Maybe it might even be in one of the <br/>
oceans. I&#39;m planning on borrowing a fish bone earring from one of my guild <br/>
members (the fish bone earring gives unlimited enduring breath) and I&#39;ll <br/>
check out the oceans for a bit, heck, if I don&#39;t find any tinkering stuff, <br/>
it will be fun, and I could find something else too.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;OK guys I may just be shooting air but I thought about what he had said and<br/>
&gt;he didnt say that it was actually under WATER.  What about the catacombes<br/>
&gt;under freeport i get lost in there a lot and there are a lot of npc&#39;s down<br/>
&gt;there... any thoughts? </span></blockquote></div>
