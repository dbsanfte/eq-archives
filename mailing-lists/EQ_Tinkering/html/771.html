<div id="ygrps-yiv-673132229">I agree with Rotgut.  All the books have different recipies.  There has got <br/>
to be more than just the fishing pole.  Sounds like a joke at our expense.  <br/>
If the combo to the fishing pole is in there, maybe the gnomish fireworks or <br/>
other combos are in there...the fishing pole would not sell for as much as <br/>
fireworks would, so you&#39;d figure that these &quot;elite tinkerers&quot; would be <br/>
flooding the market with fireworks or any other contraption...doesn&#39;t look <br/>
like it&#39;s happend....maybe the found a rare drop on a rare mob that drops <br/>
the pole and that&#39;s how they&#39;re getting their supply...<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought<br/>
