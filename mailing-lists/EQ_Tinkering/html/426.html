<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-664984115">Reading this, a thought occured to me. I wouldn&#39;t put it past Verant to have<br/>
made a way to make spyglasses without collapsible fishing poles. Then, they will<br/>
change that &quot;bug&quot; once collapsible fishing poles can be made by players. If this<br/>
is true, the person selling spyglasses really can&#39;t tell us how to make<br/>
collapsible fishing poles because he doesn&#39;t know. He&#39;s just making<br/>
spyglasses... he could be lying about making collapsible fishing poles to throw<br/>
us off. I&#39;m not saying somebody would do that, but he IS trying to keep a<br/>
monopoly on the market, and I can&#39;t say I blame him with the money he&#39;s making.<br/>
All I&#39;m really trying to say is we&#39;re probably assuming too much. The brewers<br/>
went through something similar with bog juice awhile back. Nobody knew it and<br/>
EVERYBODY was trying to figure out the recipe. Once the recipe was found<br/>
(actually, it got posted by a GM), it was nothing like anybody had been trying.<br/>
People were using yeast, malt, hops, and barley in a drink that requires nothing<br/>
more than snake scales and water. Collapsible fishing poles, if they&#39;re possible<br/>
to begin with, could be made with a rod, a pine needle, and a gear for all we<br/>
know. Hell, for all we know, a rod, a pine needle, and a gear makes the<br/>
spyglass!<br/>

&gt; Thought #1:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Before taking an extended break from Everquest to pursue a job, I spent<br/>
&gt; nearly 150 pp making flameless lanterns and my skill remained &quot;Below<br/>
&gt; Average&quot;.  I was told by a GM that tinkering is one of the hardest skills to<br/>
&gt; train, so perhaps I am either unlucky, or the skill is nearly impossible to<br/>
&gt; train up now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fact #1:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You cannot train tinkering using skill points.  I have tried it.  It is just<br/>
&gt; like other trade skills, in that you can only use training points to get it<br/>
&gt; so far before you must actually use the skill to learn it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thought #2:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the collapsible fishing pole was in a shop, it would have been found long<br/>
&gt; ago.  Of course, if it was only added in recently, then it may have yet to<br/>
&gt; be found.  In any case, it still doesn&#39;t solve the problem of not having the<br/>
&gt; recipe to make them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thought #3:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The collapsible fishing pole recipe should be fairly cheap to make.  I<br/>
&gt; really doubt that Verant made it difficult, considering it is a component<br/>
&gt; for another item.  So, this should limit the parts to those costing 1 pp or<br/>
&gt; less, with the total cost not exceeding 5 pp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thought #4:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whoever assumed that the spyglasses were being sold for 50% over cost is<br/>
&gt; assuming way too much.  If you are the only producer of an item, you can<br/>
&gt; demand a much higher profit return on that item.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thought #5:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is no such thing as a &quot;secret&quot; on Everquest.  There are too many<br/>
&gt; people playing the game, making any new discovery part of the common<br/>
&gt; knowledge base within a few weeks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thought #6:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seeing &quot;broken&quot; quests, items, and spells in the past, I wouldn&#39;t put it<br/>
&gt; past Verant that the collapsible fishing pole recipe isn&#39;t really in the<br/>
&gt; game.  I am merely speculating, but I find it rather hard to believe that<br/>
&gt; after months of uptime, not one gnome has found the recipe to such a trivial<br/>
&gt; item as the collapsible fishing pole.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thought #7:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is perhaps the most overriding aspect of this whole ridiculous thread<br/>
&gt; about the collapsible fishing pole recipe.  There are literally hundreds of<br/>
&gt; items that could be used as a component, and it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to<br/>
&gt; make any sense whatsoever.  Trying to guess it blindly is just like playing<br/>
&gt; the lottery.  You might get lucky, but we don&#39;t have the hundreds of<br/>
&gt; thousands of players needed to insure that SOMEONE gets lucky.<br/>
