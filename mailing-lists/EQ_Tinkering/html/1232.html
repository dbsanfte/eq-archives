<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647635225">One charge for the cost of making a aqualung is absolutely preposterous. <br/>
Enchanters would cast that on a whole party for less then a quarter of<br/>
that cost - most even give it for free.  Plus the high-level magi&#39;s will<br/>
soon be able to summon water stones that have 2 charges.  An aqualung<br/>
should have ten charges at least.  That way, an adventurer who paid the<br/>
high price would be able to spend a reasonable amount of time in Kedge<br/>
Keep and probably make enough to get his investmet back.<br/>
<br/>
I really hope that the one charge was a fluke or else we will never be<br/>
able to sell them. &lt;sigh&gt;  Heh - however it will be a long time before I<br/>
get to the level where I could even try Tinkering them.  This level cap<br/>
seems a little harsh if you ask me.  If we can&#39;t gain past 50 in tinkering<br/>
until lvl 25-26, why would they state that we can start increasing our<br/>
tinkering skill at 16th?  In ten levels we can gain one point?  What a web<br/>
of deception Verrant likes to weave.  Verrant:&quot;Yeah sure we&#39;ll give you an<br/>
aqualung &lt;snicker&gt;.... Good luck trying to sell it. BaHahahaha.&quot;  Well,<br/>
hopefully the Rebreather is much better although somehow I doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe our saving grace will be in the Gem Cutter?  Verrant: &quot;Hehe - can&#39;t<br/>
wait to see their faces when they find out we gave them another recycled<br/>
ability at a price no one would ever pay. Bahahahaha.  We&#39;ll have to<br/>
create a few new animated emotes /distraught, /broke and nothing to show<br/>
for it, /disappointed, /embarassed, /tinkered (new expression combining<br/>
all the above emotes) Bahahaha.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heh - I know I&#39;m sounding a little negative and tinkering does have a few<br/>
neat elements to it but I feal like tinkering is evolving more like a<br/>
novelty skill (like cooking and pottery) then an actual trade skill (like<br/>
jewelcraft and smithing).<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could roleplay a &quot;sloppy&quot; tinkerer who pays more attention to<br/>
his booze then details but I&#39;d rather not...<br/>
<br/>
QdP<br/>
<br/>
Two levels away from the &quot;real&quot; tinkering level.<br/>

&gt; You still consume oxygen, so you need to refill those oxygen tubes now<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; then...<br/>
&gt; It would make sense if you somehow could recharge these things though...<br/>
&gt; few ppl<br/>
&gt; would buy aqua lungs for any reasonably profit bringing price if they<br/>
&gt; last only<br/>
&gt; 1 charge. Sounds pretty ridiculous to me... oh well...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Miffe Treetall, still making cams to raise skill<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Btw, what is your tinkering skill, FizzWizz?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; well just a few real life facts a rebreather is a device that recycles<br/>
&gt; your own<br/>
&gt; air you breath and feeds it back to you after the filter takes out some<br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; carbon dioxide.  So if Verant follows the real thing it should have<br/>
&gt; unlimited<br/>
&gt; charges.<br/>
