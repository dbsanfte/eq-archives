<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578542149">This latest patch just made the mages 1-charge water <br/>
breathing stones non-lore. I already had a heck of a time<br/>
selling my aqualungs/rebreathers. Now any 50 lev can <br/>
walk into unrest and offer 20pp for a backpack full of stones<br/>
to any 20th level mage.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, with Kunark coming out -- Kedge will get less and<br/>
less traffic. I hope there&#39;s an underwater zone or two in Kunark.<br/>
