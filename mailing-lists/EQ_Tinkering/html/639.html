<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847989345">I have come to the conclusion that learning tinkering is one of the lamest<br/>
things Verant has implemented.  Last night, I reached level 27 with my<br/>
wizard and sat down to make flameless lanterns.  I started out at skill 50.<br/>
About 120 lanterns later, I get to 51.  About 40-50 lanterns later, I get to<br/>
60.  Then I called it quits and started again this morning.<br/>
<br/>
SEVEN hours later my skill has not budged.  I made approximately 360<br/>
attempts at lanterns (costing around 600pp after selling them back) and<br/>
gaining nothing but a sore disposition.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here is the conclusion that I came up with:  I have only been able to<br/>
train my skill up to 10 past what it started, which is the same as the<br/>
number of levels I have achieved since being able to gain tinkering skill in<br/>
the first place.  Yeah, 16 is when it says in the guild you get the skill,<br/>
but you really can&#39;t increase it til 17.<br/>
<br/>
What I need to hear from everyone is what level they are and what their<br/>
tinkering level is at.. I really don&#39;t want to have to level repeatedly just<br/>
to get decent at tinker.<br/>
