<div id="ygrps-yiv-565410774">Now i bet 95% of the Gnomes who make this item and think this is worthless <br/>
have never thought of the real reason these things where made.  A necro who <br/>
is low on hp and there is nothing but high level NPC&#39;s around. He makes an <br/>
eye of zomm and life taps it.  Hes healed with no fear of having to fight <br/>
because its dead after 1 tap.  So this item is more of a necro lifesaver then <br/>
anything else.  So with that said im sure any high level necro out there <br/>
would pay a measly 40pp to save his own hide.<br/>
