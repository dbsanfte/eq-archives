&gt; Back in beta i asked a Brad while he was in the chat<br/>
&gt; channel during a period of server down time if<br/>
&gt; tinkeres would ever be able to make +ACI-Clockwork<br/>
&gt; pets+ACI- because i had heard rumors.. but he said<br/>
&gt; no, it would offset the balance to much... Imagin a<br/>
&gt; wizard being able to have a pet at any time. Even if<br/>
&gt; it was a weak pet....<br/>

&gt; Note: I&#39;m not a Mac person, but you have to admit,<br/>
&gt; the following is funny+ACEAIQ- :) And if you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; +ACI-get+ACI- it, then I guess the media hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; soaked it for all its worth yet after all...<br/>

&gt; right, but<br/>
&gt; atleast we knew the century was going to end.+ACI-<br/>

&gt; definition of a line),  delibrate mistake, dry wine,<br/>
&gt; earth angel(ok thats just going back a ways +ADs-),<br/>
