<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172763357">With all this discussion going on, I had to see if I could resolve it.  So I<br/>
did.  Our King IS a gnome, as I discovered when I dispelled his strange<br/>
desire to look like a regular human.  He was quick to put his disguise back<br/>
on however, and I am curious as to why...<br/>

End of discussion, IMHO<br/>

&gt; Ever since retail release I have been wondering about this and bugging<br/>
&gt; gms for an explanation.  I can not remember a time when Akanon was not a<br/>
&gt; SMALL human.  The only guide to give any explanation said (opinion only,<br/>
&gt; he/she remembered him being a small human since retail as well) that<br/>
&gt; maybe Verant was waiting for something worthy of a King...Who knows.<br/>
&gt; Someone I know went in and killed him once, so I&#39;ll ask him what Akanon<br/>
&gt; repoped as...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Phizn<br/>
&gt; Mith Marr<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS  A dark elf once told me that Akanon is really a brownie that has all<br/>
&gt; us gnomes fooled...scary thought!<br/>
