&gt; I&#39;ve read all your messages since I got on this list, and so far nothing<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; have stated has come from any of the game designers, programmers, or<br/>
&gt; developers.  I remember your rotten letter before you supposedly quit, I<br/>
read<br/>
&gt; your apology and promise to provide information in the future, and I&#39;ve<br/>
read<br/>
&gt; you flaming other people for being down on you and I never said a thing<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; any of it until now...because now you are making these absolute and<br/>
unequivocal<br/>
&gt; statments about how there is no 3rd book etc. and I&#39;m simply not going to<br/>
&gt; believe it just because you say it.  Nor am I going to believe it because<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; say that some GM says it, and the reason for that is because we have<br/>
already<br/>
&gt; gotten conflicting statements from GMs!  One says tinkering is fine,<br/>
another<br/>
&gt; says it is broken, someone else says there is a 3rd book and yet another<br/>
source<br/>
&gt; says there isn&#39;t.   I still say nothing that comes from a Guide or even a<br/>
staff<br/>
&gt; GM means anything...good or bad.<br/>
&gt; If you took what I wrote as a flame maybe YOU should re-read what I wrote<br/>
&gt; instead of automatically going into defenseive mode.<br/>

&gt; &gt; GM&#39;s are told stuff. Guides are volunteers, but GMs are people that work<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually in the Verant building, they know whats going on. They work at<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; building, answering petitions and get payed for it. It is part of thier<br/>
job<br/>
&gt; &gt; responsibilities to know what is going on, so that they do NOT give<br/>
false<br/>
&gt; &gt; information. Now...if you didn&#39;t read the message I sent here about that<br/>
&gt; &gt; earlier, then you don&#39;t even have a right to be flaming me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;How do you know Josh? Are you one of Verant&#39;s game designers, planners,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;programmers, or developers?  Are you related to any of them and they<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;told<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;you this is a fact?  Or are you as ignorant as the rest of us and just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;going by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;what someone told you?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;There are enough rumors and disinformation about the 3rd book,<br/>
collapsible<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;fishing pole, and fireworks going around that I wonder if anyone on any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;server<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;really has solid information.  Until I recieve some word by an<br/>
Everquest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;programmer or developer I&#39;m keeping my mind open.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Don&#39;t count any information you have been told by the guides or GM&#39;s as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;factual.  None of them created this game.<br/>
