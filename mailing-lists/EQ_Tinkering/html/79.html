<b>Subject:</b> Pie tins and skewers..... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728206656">Interesting note..... I created a secondary character and went to Halas,<br/>
rode the ferry, entered the gates, went left and entered a shop. Lo and<br/>
behold!! They had pie tins and skewers for sale for about 9 gold each. Don&#39;t<br/>
know if a player sold them to the shopkeeper or not, but they were<br/>
definitely there. FYI.....</div>
