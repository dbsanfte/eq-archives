does or not.  They haven&#39;t gone back and added limits to the other stuff,<br/>
though.<br/>

Eyepatches are a joke.  Use spyglasses.<br/>

Most of tinkering is a joke right now.  I got my skill to 135 via power<br/>
gloves and catapults, and it&#39;s going to sit there until more items get added<br/>
that will raise it, and that are realistically able to be built.<br/>
<br/>
Side note: getting to the point where I could make the 60 or so bows I<br/>
needed for the catapults got my fletching up to 182.  Heh.  I just might<br/>
spend some time and get it to 200, just for grins.<br/>
