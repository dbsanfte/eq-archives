<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018416607">I�ve posted this on the info page about Kelethin on<br/>
Everlore already, but it�s probably a good idea to<br/>
post it here too. <br/>
One day as I was omw to the rogue guild in Kelethin I<br/>
went in to one of the shops on the way to sell. In<br/>
there was a huge gnome, the size of a woodelf, which<br/>
I�ve never seen or heard about before. His name was<br/>
some typical gnome name, with a four letter first<br/>
name, and Fiddlebiddle or something as his surname.<br/>
When I hailed him he said something like: &quot;Don�t you<br/>
find the girls in Kelethin sweet as their wine?&quot; I<br/>
tried to ask him different things, but he didn�t<br/>
react. I also tried to give him elven wine, but he<br/>
only said &quot;thank you&quot;. I can�t remember what he<br/>
conned, but I wouldn�t have killed him anyway,<br/>
probably bad faction. <br/>
Does anyone have any experience or information about<br/>
this guy? Could he be tinkering related? This happened<br/>
after the last patch.<br/>
<br/>
Also, concerning the gnome spelunker in Unrest: You<br/>
say he KOS everyone, but has any necro tried to go<br/>
near him? If there are any high level necro�s on this<br/>
list, would they be interested in trying to get in<br/>
touch with him?<br/>
<br/>
Also, about gathering tinkering info: Wouldn�t it be a<br/>
good idea to gather all info we found about all the<br/>
NPC gnomes in Norrath on a web-page? What all gnome<br/>
merchants sold, what quests they are related too and<br/>
so on? What factions do you get if you kill them, who<br/>
do they KOS and not? <br/>
Anyone interested in doing this?<br/>
