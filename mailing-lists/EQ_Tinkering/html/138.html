<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083713975">I am by no means condoning price fixing, however, i would like to know at <br/>
what price are you selling compasses.  It costs a bit over 3pp to make (I <br/>
haven&#39;t failed yet..knock on wood).  I&#39;m currently selling for 5 pp, most <br/>
people who want one have no problem paying the 5 pp.  I have found some <br/>
people who will only pay 4pp, to whom I tell to come back to me when you <br/>
get a bit more frustrated hitting sense heading.  However, I do manage to <br/>
sell one, maybe two a day.  I here that you can buy compasses from gypsies <br/>
in North Karana but I haven&#39;t made the trip to check it out (last time I <br/>
was there i got mauled by a grif).  I also heard you could get them in <br/>
Kithicor forest but I went through all the shops and didn&#39;t find any.  I&#39;ll <br/>
go to the gypsies and check them out then head to lavastorm to see if they <br/>
have them also.</div>
