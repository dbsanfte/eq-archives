<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579799304">Interesting, originally I think they appeared on test with 2 charges.  I<br/>
suspect the bitching of tinkers may have had an impact :)<br/>
<br/>
So it looks like a rebreather is still the ultimate in underwater breathing<br/>
but a water stone is an excellent emergency measure for when the party gets<br/>
in a bind.<br/>

Well, the summoned water stone has one (1) charge of enduring breath,<br/>
and the stone is lore, so I still think (hope) there is a market out there<br/>
for<br/>
us. I was about the only happy magician on Bristlebane last night, I think<br/>
;)<br/>

PS: How about this for luck. Made 4 aqua lung attempts last night, 3<br/>
succeeded and skill raised from 102 to 104!</div>
