<div id="ygrps-yiv-961160037"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Frankly that secret isn&#39;t nearly so perplexing as the location of the rogue<br/>
&gt;guild.  I had to start a newbie wood elf ranger to track the guildmaster<br/>
&gt;before I could find it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A friend of mine started a gnome rogue. Since I was familiar with the area,<br/>
I helped her find it. I asked the bartender &#39;where is the rogue guild&#39; and<br/>
he told me where it was.</div>
