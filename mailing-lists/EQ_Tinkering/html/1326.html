<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490261783">And just how are you going to carry 50 enduring breath potions?  hehe sorry<br/>
don&#39;t mean to be sarcastic here...  Besides I would think that any high<br/>
level people that wanted to camp cauldronbubble or the king in Kedge would<br/>
really be interested in these for a few reasons.<br/>
1. No need for someone to break out of combat to start recasting enduring<br/>
breath on the entire party.  Ive been to kedge a few times now, its a pain<br/>
unless you have multiple persons that can cast EB.<br/>
2.  Remember most of your EB casters also have to memorize the stamina<br/>
spells.  an Aqualung just freed up one of your spell slots.  Humm should I<br/>
memorize the evac or the enduring breath? :)<br/>
3.  Ok so 50 fishscales don&#39;t really take up that much weight, and its only<br/>
3 stacks of stuff.  But thats 2 extra stacks that aren&#39;t going to be<br/>
holding loot.  And its also 1,750 mana saved, not including fizzels, which<br/>
are not possible with the aqualung.<br/>
4. Mermaids and seahorses can cast dispell magic.  Sure that just means the<br/>
Druid, Shamen, or Enchanter needs to recast EB on someone in a hurry.  Or<br/>
they could just click off a charge from the aqualung and keep on trucking.<br/>
Not many fighters are going to have their mind firmly on the battle at hand<br/>
if they start running on the air left in their lungs.<br/>
<br/>
Thats all I could come up with off the top of my head.  As was mentioned in<br/>
another post, its all how you sell them.  I am getting better at it, and I<br/>
do offer any persons that purchass an aqualung from me, 50% of their money<br/>
back if they trade in their aqualung for a rebreather once I am able to<br/>
make them.  No matter how many charges are remaining.<br/>
<br/>
Heh on a side note, if I had been selling rebreathers, I was offered a<br/>
Yeksha for one till they learned it was the charged version. :)  I added<br/>
that name to my friends list for when I am crafting rebreathers. :)<br/>

&gt;wherein<br/>
&gt;we gig anyone who wont purchase the aqualung but wants a rebreather and cut <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt;slack to those who purchase both. this isnt really a prob for me as im only <br/>
&gt;in it<br/>
&gt;to equip my guild and have full backing from them. just an opinion and glad <br/>
&gt;to hear<br/>
&gt;the level cap is going to get fixed. you wouldnt believe the amount of cash <br/>
&gt;i wasted<br/>
&gt;of the guild treasury trying to raise my skill. well see you all in game.<br/>
