<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056315460">There was a map that was posted to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.majestic-worlds.com/runnyeye/">http://www.majestic-worlds.com/runnyeye/</a><br/>
that was listed on stratics about a week ago.  I just tried the link and it<br/>
was giving me a 403 error so it may be that the link has been restricted.<br/>
It had a detailed map of the entire runnyeye zone that was far more detailed<br/>
than any other map I&#39;d seen.  The place is huge.  If you really want to see<br/>
it and you can&#39;t get the link to work, send me a private email and I&#39;ll see<br/>
if I can find it in my temp files.<br/>

Runny Eye.  Broxx the Evil Eye with the Observor Staff spawns here.  But<br/>
there is also a seemingly massive canal system (I heard four levels deep)<br/>
that I saw with a waterfall flowing down into it.  I dropped onto the bridge<br/>
but had to gate out when a slime elemental ran into me.  Has anyone explored<br/>
the water in this zone?  What is down there?<br/>
