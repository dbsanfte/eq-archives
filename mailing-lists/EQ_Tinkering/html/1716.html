&gt; OK don&#39;t get to excited but I have been asked by a fellow gnome to make<br/>
&gt; the gemcutter. He claims he can get the diamond dust for me, but won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; give up the npc that drops it. He claims that the npc is 50th level and <br/>
&gt; that the diamond dust is a rare drop item off it. I am thinking that this<br/>
&gt; could mean that the npc may be in the planes but that is merley speculation.<br/>
&gt; I wish he would give up the info but he is keeping it hidden from all for<br/>
&gt; another gnome. Well i hope this gives all you tinkerers hope:) Has anyone <br/>
&gt; discovered what the formula is for the Thermal Cloak? Where can i aquire <br/>
&gt; tattered belts? Are they merely patchwork belts or are they actually called<br/>
&gt; Tattered belts? <br/>
