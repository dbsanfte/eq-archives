	I started tinkering recently, and after investing around 3000PP I got up to<br/>
104 skill.  So I went on to aqualungs.  10 attempts produced 2 aqualungs.<br/>
No skill raises.  I had a Intel of 167, Wis of 137 and bought the items with<br/>
131 charisma (best price possible for my faction).  At this point I am<br/>
doubting Wisdom has much to do with successful creations.  Am I haven&#39;t bad<br/>
luck here?  Or is a 80% failure rate common?  I can&#39;t even imagine trying a<br/>
rebreather at this rate.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if we need to find a item that has better success rate than<br/>
aqualungs to get skill higher.  But seems to be none to help with this.  Is<br/>
anyone out there over 110 skill yet?  If so, give us some insight on costs<br/>
and failure ratings.  At this rate, I need to sell aqualungs for thousands<br/>
of PP rather than hundreds.<br/>

Although this is my first post to this list, ive been reading em everyday<br/>
for the last few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I too am an aspiring tinkerer (skill 106) and I have successfully made Lungs<br/>
and Rebreathers alike.<br/>
<br/>
Well tonight, after a week of work, I took my 4000pp and went to make some<br/>
lungs.  Out of 10 attempts,<br/>
i succeeded on 4 of em.  I then attempted to make 4 Rebreathers... Failure<br/>
on all four...<br/>
<br/>
Another 4000pp gone and not ONE point of skill advancement.  Int is 182, wis<br/>
is 100, lvl 50 character.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you have any tips for me, let me know, im very close to just<br/>
giving the damn skill up, ive got over<br/>
13K pp invested into it and im quite frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

P.S.  Have we just given up on the Diamond dust?  I for one am still looking<br/>
everywhere that i can and one<br/>
thing&#39;s for sure, Faeries DON&#39;T drop it.  I&#39;ve killed about 1000 faeries,<br/>
maidens, guards, royal guards and the like. not one diamond dust drop/</div>
