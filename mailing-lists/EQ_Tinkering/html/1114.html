<div id="ygrps-yiv-67232614">Gnomestock99 was a success!  At least I had a blast.  Thanks to Rotgut for<br/>
putting it togeather and also to the other brother and sister gnomes of Sol<br/>
Ro for bringing the kegs!  It was a nice way to celebrate the knowledge of<br/>
the 3rd Tinkering Book.  We had cliff jumping, a drunken race, a party at<br/>
King Akanon&#39;s in which he actually killed himself for some reason, a<br/>
levitate party and many brawls.  Some of us turned in our books to the POD.<br/>
I think I saw 3 GMs there, 2 of which were fellow gnomes.  A great time of<br/>
general Gnomeing about.  And I kicked a couple butts, including Ubershadows!<br/>
=)   But I died many horrible deaths, too.  I look forward to the next<br/>
Gnomestock!<br/>

		Well I had fun.  heh but I didn&#39;t see any fireworks display!<br/>
:(  Well maybe<br/>
		there was a display, but I blinked and missed it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
		At the next one we should all get levitate and go to the top<br/>
of the<br/>
		windmills!  :)  I did that once before, it was pretty fun.<br/>
Would be quite a<br/>
		sight to see 40 gnomes all crowded on the roofs of the<br/>
windmills.  heh  you<br/>
		can see pictures of me on the roofs at<br/>

<br/>
		Also next time we should try and get the news sites like<br/>
stratics to post a<br/>
		message on the news page about it so we can get even more<br/>
people to come.<br/>
		Though I&#39;ve never seen that many people in the akanon zone<br/>
at one time.  heh<br/>
