<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105527514">I thought you were leaving the list.  I am most dissapointed to see you still<br/>
here.  I hope you reconsider and do indeed leave us. If I have to beg I will,<br/>
please, please, please leave the list. Because there is no way I would ever want<br/>
anyone to share anything with someone as selfish and egotistical as yourself.<br/>
We know you don&#39;t want to help us, and guess what.  We don&#39;t want to help you.<br/>
So please remove yourself from this list.  You are not wanted here.<br/>

&gt; I apologize, I didn&#39;t mean to come off sounding so pompous, and arrogant. I<br/>
&gt; really was being pathetically immature, I guess it was just becuase I had<br/>
&gt; just gotten a clue, that really helps the discovery or the pole. You see it<br/>
&gt; would clear up alot, but I don&#39;t wish to tell because, I swore to the one<br/>
&gt; who told me the clue that I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone what it was that he said,<br/>
&gt; and I don&#39;t want to dishonor him, or myself. They hold this secret pretty<br/>
&gt; close to thier hearts, and take it pretty seriously. I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; decieve this person. I can, when I want to, use words with the most<br/>
&gt; excellent of skill, like when I got a clue from the guy that part of this<br/>
&gt; unknown organization, and I can also be a jerk and come off sounding like an<br/>
&gt; 8 year old troll, as you have learned, well I&#39;m sorry, and I hope you can<br/>
&gt; understand why I feel that I must keep my knowledge a secret for now.<br/>

&quot;To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I struck the pedestrian.&quot;</div>
