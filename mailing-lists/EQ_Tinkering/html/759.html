<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872518452">Guys, look. I said that a what I wanted to do (which was just look around <br/>
Ak&#39;Anon) could be done by a level 1 barbarian shaman just as easily as a <br/>
level 50 wizard or somethnig could do it, I was only giving an example. <br/>
Barbarian shamans have nothing to do with this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Barbarians get caught in our town, so if a barbarian shaman found the clue <br/>
&gt;it is<br/>
&gt;very unlikely in akanon.  Because my friend is a shaman and due to game <br/>
&gt;bugs has<br/>
&gt;had to gate out of akanon almost every time he entered it.<br/>
