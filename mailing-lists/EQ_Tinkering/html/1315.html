<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053519060">I believe that the reason things tend to suck at first implementation is<br/>
that they&#39;d rather have something suck and power it up, than have it too<br/>
powerful and have folks bitch about gimping.  People get so bloody pissed at<br/>
gimping that they try to avoid it at all costs.  Plus they dislike putting<br/>
in items that completely unbalance the game.<br/>

My take on Verant&#39;s philosophy:<br/>
<br/>
Step 1: When you introduce something to the game, make it royally suck, in <br/>
the name of class balance, so no one will get pissed off about becoming <br/>
useless.<br/>
Step 2: Slowly make incremental improvements until the people who want the <br/>
change stop bitching a lot.<br/>
Step 3: Walk away for months to see if bitching continues.</div>
