&lt;&lt; I talked to several guides last night on the Xegony server and they all <br/>
told <br/>
 me that tinkering was NOT a broken skill.  I ran this by them twice saying <br/>
 that a couple of the guides had said that some parts of it were broken and <br/>
 they told me that it was working fine.  Just thought I would share that info <br/>
 with you guys. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     I think that what is happening here is that the initial aspects of <br/>
tinkering are working. As we know we CAN make some items. Therefore some <br/>
guides say that yes, it is working. On the other hand, It is broken as far as <br/>
the more advanced items .. broken meaning that there IS NO recipe. Some <br/>
guides seem to know this. As much work that has been put into this I&#39;m quite <br/>
certain that if it were working correctly it would be common knowledge by now.<br/>
     I think we need to really start pushing this issue with the GM&#39;s in a <br/>
FRIENDLY manner, hoping they will put it in their reports to Verant. Also the <br/>
&quot;Feedback&quot; option must be used to its fullest potential. Everytime I sign on <br/>
from now till I see a recipe I will send feedback regarding this potentially <br/>
wonderfull skill. Its easy for them to put this issue on the back burner, but <br/>
if they see feedback (Constructive feedback) everyday from many many gnomes <br/>
it will have to be moved up their ladder of priorities. Until then nothing we <br/>
do will work.<br/>
