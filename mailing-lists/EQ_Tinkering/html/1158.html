&gt; The clockwork is part of a quest.  I believe that the quest is from Manik in<br/>
&gt; the Gemchopper area, but I could be wrong.  Usually he&#39;s guarded by a lot of<br/>
&gt; fairies (a LOT of NASTY fairies), but somebody probably lured him to the<br/>
&gt; zone.  You&#39;re supposed to kill him (to prevent fairies from getting gnome<br/>
&gt; technology) and bring back proof of killing him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The observatory has always been there.  It&#39;s part of the lens quest.<br/>

&gt; Has anyone ever heard of a gnome clockwork NPC called Cognoggin?  I was<br/>
&gt; leaving Steamfont and he was sitting right by the zone border in Lesser Fay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   He conned blue to me at 18, and since he didn&#39;t respond to my hails, I<br/>
&gt; promptly killed him.  I was afraid that he would drop my faction with people<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; in Ak&#39;anon, but it dropped with fairies instead. All he had for loot was a<br/>
&gt; rusty short sword. I have never heard of him nor seen him before today, has<br/>
&gt; anyone else?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, has there always been a gnome observitory in Lesser Fay? I don&#39;t ever<br/>
&gt; remember seeing it there.<br/>
