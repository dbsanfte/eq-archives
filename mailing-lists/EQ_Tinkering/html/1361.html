<div id="ygrps-yiv-159810042">I would seem to me that a depleted aqualung could still be used to make a <br/>
rebreather...Sell aqualung for 1000pp, buy back empty for 100 or 200pp, <br/>
make a rebreather from it and sell for 2000pp<br/>

&gt;I had a thought..... perhaps those being supported by their Guild can check<br/>
&gt;this out - aqua lung used.... all charges gone.... how much does a HIGH<br/>
&gt;charisma charchter get offered from a Merchant? Ineteresting to know whether<br/>
&gt;thats less than a Merchant offers for a charged one. It may not be very<br/>
&gt;much... but intersting to find out and as far as marketing goes a good sale<br/>
&gt;point &#39;you get x hundred plat back on selling to merchant....&#39; </span></blockquote></div>
