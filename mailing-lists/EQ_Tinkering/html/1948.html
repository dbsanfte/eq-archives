<b>Subject:</b> Starting out <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-815855316">First off I want to say how great it is that there ARE other gnomes out<br/>
there who take such an avid interest in one of the few things that set us<br/>
apart in Gnorrath.  Having followed your adventures and attempts at<br/>
discovering the lost knowledge of tinkering has kept me going...and now I am<br/>
ready to start working as well.<br/>
A few questions though....<br/>
I already know what to make as I progress, but I&#39;m curious...how do you sell<br/>
the items you make (ie fireworks, cams, etc?)  I really doubt anyone would<br/>
buy a flameless lantern, and I don&#39;t blame them, but what about other items?<br/>
I have successfully made some cams and can&#39;t seem to sell them.  Nor<br/>
fireworks, which I have heard are a hit...which makes me feel useless since<br/>
I can&#39;t get rid of them.<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated, and since I don&#39;t know of any other gnomes<br/>
tinkering on my world this was the only place I knew to ask.  Of course, if<br/>
there is another one out there that&#39;d be great...<br/>
