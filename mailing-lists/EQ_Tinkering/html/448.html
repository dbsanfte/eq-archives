<div id="ygrps-yiv-760725743">Maybe we are looking in the wrong areas.   I was thinking last night while I <br/>
was sleeping and having those EQ dreams I often do from playing so much.    <br/>
That maybe its a faction issue.   I would like to try this but I am a necro <br/>
and it would be very difficult and I will do nothing but obtain KOS status <br/>
with the Dark reflection.<br/>
<br/>
If I remember right that wizard or merchant or whatever he is in the third <br/>
windmill says something about the Eldrich collective.   About being a member <br/>
or something.   Same with the wizard behind the library.    And I think Jogle <br/>
and his spider are a key to tinkering also.    Maybe if someone does the <br/>
smaller quests in akanon over and over their faction will get high enough <br/>
with some of the surrounding guilds that maybe jogl or that wizard will give <br/>
some sort of quest.    I believe that maybe its a faction issue.    And we <br/>
may just be looking in the wrong area.     Or something to do that zoo keeper <br/>
mentioned in the book.    Gimblestein states in his book about the quest he <br/>
did with him.   Maybe there is some sort of quest to obtain a scroll or third <br/>
tinkering book.     And what about all those mechanics around akanon they <br/>
have to be used for some type of quest or other.      Just some ideas.     <br/>
Let me know what you think or if this has already been discussed.     Because <br/>
I haven&#39;t heard much word from our infiltrator???   So I take it the <br/>
infiltration plan isn&#39;t going to well.<br/>
