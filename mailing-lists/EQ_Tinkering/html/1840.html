<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-412479809">Ever since retail release I have been wondering about this and bugging<br/>
gms for an explanation.  I can not remember a time when Akanon was not a<br/>
SMALL human.  The only guide to give any explanation said (opinion only,<br/>
he/she remembered him being a small human since retail as well) that<br/>
maybe Verant was waiting for something worthy of a King...Who knows. <br/>
Someone I know went in and killed him once, so I&#39;ll ask him what Akanon<br/>
repoped as...<br/>

PS  A dark elf once told me that Akanon is really a brownie that has all<br/>
us gnomes fooled...scary thought!</div>
