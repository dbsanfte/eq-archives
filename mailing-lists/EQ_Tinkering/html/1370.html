<b>Subject:</b> Tinkering skill cap, fixed? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-887417454">I just read that the patch that was supposed to be this morning was actually<br/>
already done.  They did it when the servers were down with that Cerfnet and<br/>
UUnet trouble.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has tried the tinkering<br/>
skill since the patch to see if the skill cap (I think it was (Level - 15) x<br/>
5) has been fixed yet.  I had been hoping that they would fix it in this<br/>
patch after someone reported that a GM said they should be fixing it soon,<br/>
maybe even in the next patch.  If anyone knows if you can Tinker outside the<br/>
level cap now please say so =)<br/>
