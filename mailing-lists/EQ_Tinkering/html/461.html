&gt; A few things here.  If it is a known fact I will put &lt;fact&gt; before it, if<br/>
it is<br/>
&gt; an assumptions I will place &lt;assumption&gt; before it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thought #1:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Before taking an extended break from Everquest to pursue a job, I spent<br/>
&gt; &gt; nearly 150 pp making flameless lanterns and my skill remained &quot;Below<br/>
&gt; &gt; Average&quot;.  I was told by a GM that tinkering is one of the hardest<br/>
skills to<br/>
&gt; &gt; train, so perhaps I am either unlucky, or the skill is nearly impossible<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; train up now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;Assumption&gt; tinkering is broken. It doesn&#39;t matter what a GM tells you.<br/>
They<br/>
&gt; lie all the time.  I have even asked them on things I have known to be<br/>
true just<br/>
&gt; to see if they would lie.  If any of you are Necromacers you know about<br/>
the DoT<br/>
&gt; bug, where the corpse vanishes when the monster dies, and no one gets EXP.<br/>
Well<br/>
&gt; I was assured numerous time by Bargash (A real GM on Karana and not even a<br/>
&gt; guide) that this was supposed to be part of the game.  Of course, a few<br/>
patches<br/>
&gt; latter Verant put in a &quot;fix&quot; for this &quot;part of the game&quot; which has helped<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; the problem still exists.  This is my only instance of an actual GM lying<br/>
to me,<br/>
&gt; but there are many other instances where guides will give answers to<br/>
questions<br/>
&gt; they know nothing about.  So I would just disreguard the answer.  Because<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; tinker could go up, then someone on this list would have had his/her skill<br/>
go up<br/>
&gt; by now.  So if you have had your tinkering skill go up, please say<br/>
something so<br/>
&gt; we know it is possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thought #2:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If the collapsible fishing pole was in a shop, it would have been found<br/>
long<br/>
&gt; &gt; ago.  Of course, if it was only added in recently, then it may have yet<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be found.  In any case, it still doesn&#39;t solve the problem of not having<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; recipe to make them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;Assumption&gt; Really only gnomes would be looking for this item. If it was<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; grobb or oggok (don&#39;t ask me why, but they put some necromacers spells<br/>
there)<br/>
&gt; then it is very unlikely that we would have found it.  If it was in neriak<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; really only Necromacers could have found it.  This would mean that our<br/>
&gt; enchanters would have to check these cities.  There are also vendors all<br/>
over.<br/>
&gt; A gnome, on this list, would have to hit one of these vendors and then<br/>
scroll<br/>
&gt; down enough to see the pole if it was there.  It definitely could be out<br/>
there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thought #3:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The collapsible fishing pole recipe should be fairly cheap to make.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; really doubt that Verant made it difficult, considering it is a<br/>
component<br/>
&gt; &gt; for another item.  So, this should limit the parts to those costing 1 pp<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; &gt; less, with the total cost not exceeding 5 pp.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;assumption&gt; Tinkering is broken, and the pole cannot be made at this<br/>
time.<br/>
&gt; This is probably due to some poor coding or oversite (such as the DoT bug,<br/>
which<br/>
&gt; effects every class with DoT or the Barbarian Shield).  Verant has put out<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; good game, but made some large errors in coding that apparently cannot be<br/>
fixed<br/>
&gt; until large areas of code can be patched (my guess would be this would not<br/>
occur<br/>
&gt; until the expansion).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thought #4:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Whoever assumed that the spyglasses were being sold for 50% over cost is<br/>
&gt; &gt; assuming way too much.  If you are the only producer of an item, you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; demand a much higher profit return on that item.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;Fact&gt; Spyglass are found as a rare drop off of some monsters.  They are a<br/>
very<br/>
&gt; rare drop (like the box of abu-kar for which I kill about 300-400 monsters<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the appropriate type before one drops).  I have seen them for auction, and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; have seen people auctioning for them.  Every single person has given me<br/>
the same<br/>
&gt; response to my inquiries, that they are looted.  If the person who was<br/>
selling<br/>
&gt; it led you to believe he tinkered the item, he was most likely lying, and<br/>
hoping<br/>
&gt; to get more to sell and keep the price up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thought #5:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is no such thing as a &quot;secret&quot; on Everquest.  There are too many<br/>
&gt; &gt; people playing the game, making any new discovery part of the common<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowledge base within a few weeks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;Fact&gt; This is pretty true for the most part, but the glowing stein was a<br/>
part<br/>
&gt; of the game from beta on, and it wasn&#39;t until 2 or 3 weeks ago that this<br/>
became<br/>
&gt; common knowledge.  Verant also reports that less than 50% of the total<br/>
different<br/>
&gt; items in the game have been found.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thought #6:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Seeing &quot;broken&quot; quests, items, and spells in the past, I wouldn&#39;t put it<br/>
&gt; &gt; past Verant that the collapsible fishing pole recipe isn&#39;t really in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game.  I am merely speculating, but I find it rather hard to believe<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; after months of uptime, not one gnome has found the recipe to such a<br/>
trivial<br/>
&gt; &gt; item as the collapsible fishing pole.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;assumption&gt; I totally agree as stated above.<br/>
