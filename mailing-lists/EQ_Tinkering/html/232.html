<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238275100">I&#39;ve made a small profit from selling compasses.  I make them for about <br/>
3pp, better now with my +17 charisma gear I have, and sell them for 5pp <br/>
each.  This is the auction line I have found works the best:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Selling TINKERED compass, 5pp, great if you have poor sense heading, 100% <br/>
success rate, don&#39;t be fooled by cheap knock-off imports, buy direct from <br/>
the artisan, support the trades!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think the last bit &quot;support the trades&quot; helps a bit since I have sold 2 <br/>
to people with good sense heading but buy trade items just to provide support.<br/>
<br/>
I have sold only 10 so far, so I guess I&#39;ve made 20pp, not much, but better <br/>
than losing money.  Just sucks that you don&#39;t get experience from them.<br/>

&gt;Yikes! It costs approx. 2pp to make a flameless lantern, and THIS is the <br/>
&gt;item used to increase skill??<br/>
&gt;How many lanterns does it take to increase 1 point?  This sounds extremely <br/>
&gt;expensive to me.<br/>
&gt;I eventually want to make Mechanized Lockpicks, but it sounds like this is <br/>
&gt;gonna be way too costly.  Any profit in tinkering at all?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for any help,<br/>

&gt;&gt;Making flameless lanterns is the way to go to gain skill, a warning though<br/>
&gt;&gt;one of the patches sort of messed with tinkering where you will rarely gain<br/>
&gt;&gt;skill points now.  I don&#39;t know if this has been changed.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The only place to buy tinkering components is in Steamfont.<br/>
