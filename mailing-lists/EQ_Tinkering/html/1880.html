<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801137133">I&#39;m Fairly new to this list, so I&#39;m not sure what has been discussed before <br/>
I was here, so if this has been mentioned or brought up before please excuse <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t there a quest in Kaladim that yields a cloak as a reward? I was <br/>
thinking it was a cleric or paladin quest, and had something to do with <br/>
faction with the Underfoot people. I could be wrong, its something to think <br/>
about.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;OK first of all I think that tattred gnomish cloak can be MADE from err<br/>
&gt;tailoring skill, and I saw a few posts that you can aquire the scteches<br/>
&gt;somewhere in Kelethin ( Wood Elf City, ahh those sexy women of theirs :))<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;second this would be a very prized item to have , for dragon raids I would<br/>
&gt;suspec it would be somthing like 20 sv cold 20 sv fire. and the high lvl<br/>
&gt;people would be glad to buy it! So it is also away to make contacts for<br/>
&gt;dragon / and even plane raids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;anyways . as a necro I can not buy in klethin so I can;t find out where the<br/>
&gt;sketches are. but if somoene can go ahead and try it:)<br/>
