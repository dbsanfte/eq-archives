<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-963797675">Yah, research is NOT a regular tradeskill and is capped at lvls, only <br/>
&quot;regular&quot; tradeskill that ever was capped was tinkering, and well, tinkering <br/>
is not really &quot;regular&quot; :) Only gnomes can do it and we start with a skill <br/>
of 50 :)<br/>
<br/>
So yes, as late as 2 weeks ago, research was lvl capped. Btw, the diamond <br/>
dust thing, i HAVE been thinking about the akanon mines a lot, i spose the <br/>
gnomes mine there for gems, and these &quot;dusters&quot; may well have picked up some <br/>
diamond dust remains from there ;)<br/>
<br/>
was in AkAnon today, but TOTALLY forgot to check the mines, even tho that <br/>
was the main reason i went there, hehe<br/>

&gt;&gt;	As people began to believe one thing nad become so advant abouit it, they<br/>
&gt;&gt;tend to become ugly to the point of hatred. People speak so freely about<br/>
&gt;&gt;what they know is right or wrong without even really finding out a<br/>
&gt;&gt;deffinent<br/>
&gt;&gt;asnwer for themselves. As for the person that is angry about this thread,<br/>
&gt;&gt;man lighten up. As for right now everyone knows that Tinkering like<br/>
&gt;&gt;Reaserch<br/>
&gt;&gt;is a trade skill. That means that when you learn it you can continue to<br/>
&gt;&gt;learn with out me capped out on a level. I have read many threads where<br/>
&gt;&gt;people believe this or that. Then when someone says something and everyone<br/>
&gt;&gt;finds out it was true they are like I knew that. Ok As far as it has been<br/>
&gt;&gt;said my BM is that on all trade skills includeing research and the other<br/>
&gt;&gt;hard to raise skills there is no cap per level. So I believe that it is<br/>
&gt;&gt;possible to go above actually I have a gnome with 77 and I am 18 that is 2<br/>
&gt;&gt;points above max. I got the money to raise this from my guild but none the<br/>
&gt;&gt;less. FRom my experiance and what has been said it seems the either one <br/>
&gt;&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;cap is different or the cap is gone. I do not doubt anything people have<br/>
&gt;&gt;said but it seems that, there may be alot of truth in some things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Correct me if I am wrong, but are you saying that spell research does not<br/>
&gt;have a cap?  You are mistaken if you think so.  To be as objective as<br/>
&gt;possible, I will detail the circumstances that convince me that spell<br/>
&gt;research is capped per level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I play on Erollisi Marr, and general consensus is that each server has its<br/>
&gt;own tweaked code, for whatever reason.  On this server, I have played a<br/>
&gt;wizard up to level 44, and spent training points/cash on most of my spell<br/>
&gt;research skill learns.  I would say maybe 15% of my gains in spell research<br/>
&gt;have come strictly from combining runes.  Now, everytime I level, I go to a<br/>
&gt;guildmaster and train this skill.  It goes up 5 times, and then the<br/>
&gt;guildmaster refuses to train me anymore, until I level again.  As a test,<br/>
&gt;once I did nothing but rune practice for 5 points, then went to the<br/>
&gt;guildmaster.  He could not train me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is possible that some servers have skill caps, and others do not.  Just<br/>
&gt;compare zone closings on different servers.  If they are supposedly the <br/>
&gt;same<br/>
&gt;code base, why do some servers go down for software maintenance and others<br/>
&gt;do not?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is also possible that the guildmaster is level capped, but practice is<br/>
&gt;not.  This is difficult for me to verify because, at level 44 with max<br/>
&gt;research, I first have to level to 45, then collect a ton of level 44 runes<br/>
&gt;to combine.  I have had a problem acquiring those runes, so it would take<br/>
&gt;weeks to verify a level cap or not in that fashion.  But, in that amount of<br/>
&gt;time, I will have levelled, so the process is a waste for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess what I am trying to say is that it may very well be possible that<br/>
&gt;some servers have a level-cap on tinkering, and others do not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know that Erollisi Marr had a tinkering cap 2 months ago for sure.<br/>
