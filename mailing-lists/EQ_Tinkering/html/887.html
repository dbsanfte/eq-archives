<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038893422">I&#39;ve been hearing a lot about people seeing collapsing fishing rods and the<br/>
telescope that&#39;s made from them. But I seam to remember reading an article<br/>
back when I first started playing Everquest (that was back in July), about a<br/>
collapsing fishing rod that could be obtained from a quest or NPC some<br/>
where, don&#39;t remember where or what article it was.<br/>
<br/>
That might be the source of all these sightings, and not someone who is too<br/>
selfish to share the info.<br/>
