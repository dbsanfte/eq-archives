&lt;&lt; I hate to be a downer... but I doubt the 50 charges to 1 charge is a bug. <br/>
 Verrant has a long history of defusing ways of making easy money. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Nice theory but I DO believe it is a bug. You mentioned the O Staff losing <br/>
charges but that has been fixed. Now when you trade it it keeps the same <br/>
charges it had. I&#39;m sure they will do the same for the Aqua lung. They didnt <br/>
put tinkered items in the game for only tinkerers to use. Its a TRADE skill. <br/>
Trade skill items are meant to be traded.<br/>
