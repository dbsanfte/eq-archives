<b>Subject:</b> GemCutter probably not functional at the moment... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974470893">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Made another gem chopper last night. Tried picking up the chopper and right clicking over a perl and nothing happened. Tried manipulating it several other ways with no results.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you guys have any other &#39;non-destructive&#39; ideas for the gems chopper let me know and I&#39;ll try them out.<br/>
<br/>
After I made the chopper, I gave GM &#39;NYXX&#39; of Tunare a buzz and out right asked him if the gem chopper is a functional item at the moment or should I wait for another patch. He told me, &quot;I dont think that it is functional right now&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Now admittedly a GM&#39;s word is not neccesarily law, but this is proof enough for me to wait for a future patch before we start destroying more gemcutters.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How many gems can ya chop if gemchopper dont chop gems?&quot;   bah...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
