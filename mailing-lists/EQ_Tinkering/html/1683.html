<div id="ygrps-yiv-154529432">If you give scrap metal to Sanfyrd Featherhead (the gnome outside the mines of malfunction) you may possilbe get &quot;Timmerman&#39;s Fabulous Compacter &quot; Its a container that hold four items and has a combine button.  If you ask Sanfryd about the compactor he says  &#39;I don&#39;t know. It is in fine condition. I never heard of any tinkerer named Tinmizer. At least you can hold items with it. Just do not press the activation button unless you know what you are doing.&#39;<br/>
Since compactors crush things... could it work?<br/>
<br/>
(Please note I&#39;m only level 13 and have neight the compactor or a diamond to try this out on.  i read about this on www.everlore.com)<br/>
