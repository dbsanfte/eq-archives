I strongly believe that you are just starved for attention, and to put such a post on this board as you did, shows your childish ways, and imature intelect... You are flaunting people as if they should beg for your knowledge.. well as you can probably see thats not going to happen, your just going to get flamed... I suggest you pack up your bag of lies and make a hasty retreat!<br/>

Note: I&#39;m not a Mac person, but you have to admit, the following is funny!! :) And if you don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; it, then I guess the media hasn&#39;t soaked it for all its worth yet after all...<br/>

&gt;Because of my obvious genius, I was able to find more out about the <br/>
&gt;collapsible fishing pole than ALL OF YOU put together, and not only do I <br/>
&gt;think that I&#39;m on the verge of discovering the secret of the fishing pole, <br/>
&gt;but I think I&#39;m on the verge of discovering the lost tinkering book! Hahaha! <br/>
&gt;I know something none of you know, but I&#39;m not going to tell. I will not <br/>
&gt;dishonor my self or others, so sorry. I just wanted you guys to know tat I <br/>
&gt;know something, and could very well soon find out the secret, but like I <br/>
&gt;said, I won&#39;t tell.<br/>
