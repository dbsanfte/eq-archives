<div id="ygrps-yiv-575144215">Aqua Lungs...well, they cost a ton to make. have a failure rate of like 50% <br/>
(rally hurts) but you really wont be able to sell a charged item for too <br/>
much. i sell em for around 400 which is an extreme deal, but then again i <br/>
have 6 on order right now and i can hardly keep up.<br/>
the charge bug..it is NOT fixed. i sold one lung to a very honorable guy and <br/>
he had one charge on it...my guess is that because his inventory wan not <br/>
redy to hold the Lung(it must be placed either in one of the regular <br/>
inventory slots OR a large box/Box of Abu Kar) well..his Lung dropped to the <br/>
ground during the trade..and this might have been the cause for the bug. i <br/>
dunno. i just make sure the ppl check the charges before AND after the <br/>
purchase.<br/>
