<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860145641">sorry to say, but dont believe a frigging word the GMs say.<br/>
 they also told me that compasses were *not* broken in anyway, and that<br/>
we could make them, this is *before* they made our toolboxes have 8<br/>
slots. Whoosh, there goes 100pp and 2 hours of time trying everything I<br/>
could think of to get them to work.... We did petition and were told<br/>
that they were, infact, tinkerable (is this a word?).<br/>
 4 days later they patch the toolbox and suddenly, viola, we really can<br/>
make compasses...<br/>

&gt; Well, i&#39;ve heard from an &quot;assistant guide&quot; (sarcasm) that said tinkering<br/>
&gt; was fully functional and said to go exploring.<br/>
&gt; Not sure if I believe him, but him, he was very tight lipped.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are we sure that its not working or do we think that it is because we can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; find the plans for some items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the bug using cams, has anyone tried to combine them with an oak or<br/>
&gt; an darkwood staff?  regular cams don&#39;t work<br/>
&gt; for hickory, elm, or ashwoods.  I haven&#39;t tried it yet on an oak or a<br/>
&gt; darkwood cause I am relatively poor.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I think you guys gotta realize that tinkering is just plain bugged and you<br/>
&gt; &gt;have to wait till they fix it.<br/>
