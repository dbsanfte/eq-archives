<div id="ygrps-yiv-772391325">also noticed one day that one of the windmills blades were not <br/>
spinning...not related to the central pillar that i could tell, and was to <br/>

&gt;2)  I notices an oddity with the mills.  If you touch (click on) the<br/>
&gt;rotating pillars inside the mills, they stop spinning.  Any thoughts on<br/>
&gt;this?<br/>
