<div id="ygrps-yiv-297506405">There is a file named something like spelleff.dat. I am at work and can&#39;t<br/>
look, but it is close to that. Anyway if you look at it with a hex editor<br/>
you can see the names of all the spells in the game. Some things like poison<br/>
which are not spells are treated as spells by the game engine. There are two<br/>
fireworks spells. There is also one called aqualung. That does not mean<br/>
there is a way that we can create them, but they are in the game at some<br/>
level.</div>
