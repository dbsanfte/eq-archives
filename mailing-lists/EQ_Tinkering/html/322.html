<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997019794">I mentioned these two items earlier on the list.. incase you missed it: I dont know what the power source is for, but force modules are usually items that have a few charges of a dmg spell... at least the ones ive come accrost have. Possible some other types of spells too, but ive only seen dmg spells. As for the power source, i dunno. I came accrost the power source in Sol A at the gnome castle thing, but force modules ive found off loot.. <br/>

Came across a functional force module and a small power source.  Thought<br/>
they might be used for tinkering...  Any ideas?<br/>
