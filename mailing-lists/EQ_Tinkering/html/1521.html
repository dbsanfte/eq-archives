<b>Subject:</b> the dude with 172 skill..BS <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-333947103">guys why are ya listening to that crap....he said the guy wanted him to twink him to 39<br/>
you all forget the cap or something...no way a level 39 could have a 172 skill..its all BS<br/>
and what has happened to the board here...we are falling apart...anyway now that i think<br/>
about it its true that if there was no cap you would have gnomes powered to 16 and bam overmite<br/>
master tinkerers....much as i hate it ive spent too much time and money to be pushed out <br/>
of the market cause of some level 50 rich pc...now lets pull back together and get back on the<br/>
problems at hand...thx:)</div>
