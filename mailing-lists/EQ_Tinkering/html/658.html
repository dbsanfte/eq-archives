&gt;I made 8 Cams in a row with out anything.. not counting the two lockpicks<br/>
&gt;and about 40 - 50 lanterns.  Told a guide I was bugged, told me to stop<br/>
&gt;bugging him.. sigh...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It seems to me that it depends greatly on your experience level.  At level <br/>
27 I was only able to raise tinkering to 60.  The skill does not take dozens <br/>
and dozens of attempts to raise.  If it doesn&#39;t go up after 20, it isn&#39;t <br/>
going up til you level.  So far, it seems that you can only learn one point <br/>
per level til 28, then 5 points per level after that.  I am level 30 now, <br/>
and I will try to get past 75 to see if one can gain more than 5 points per <br/>
level.<br/>
