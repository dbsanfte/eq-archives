&gt; The GM is mistaken.  Whether it&#39;s a bug or not, the Tinkering skill<br/>
&gt; follows the same rules as Caster research.  The level is capped at<br/>
&gt; (level -15) * 5.  The reason you didn&#39;t gain a single point is because<br/>
&gt; at Level 31, 80 skill is your max.  Wait until Level 32 and try again.<br/>
&gt; You should go up 5 pts and stop at 85.  Forget the /petition and /bugs<br/>
&gt; about Aqualung charges, THIS is the problem we should be complaining<br/>
&gt; about.  Tinkering should have the cap removed and made like every other<br/>
&gt; trade skill.<br/>

&gt; &gt;    Well i started the day with an skill of 80 and a lv of 31, i put<br/>
&gt; &gt; down over 1100 pp in making stalking probes and spyglasses and my<br/>
&gt; &gt; reward was NOT 1 single point gained :-((((  This cant be right.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was told by GM Caphys on Veeshan that Tinkering is like any outher<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade skill and i should be able to gain past 80 skill regardless of<br/>
&gt; &gt; my level after i get the skill at lv 16.   Askur Soon a poor wizard<br/>
