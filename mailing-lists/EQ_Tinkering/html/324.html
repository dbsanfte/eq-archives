 I agree...the quest system is quite irritating.  I keep a<br/>
running list of all items in game and off my list there are only 54 items<br/>
one can receive from a quest mind you 8 of those are the monk<br/>
headband/sashes .  To my knowledge the following quests are the only ones<br/>
worth doing for item rewards not faction fixes that one could conceivably<br/>
sell.<br/>
<br/>
 Brewer&#39;s compendium - glowing stein<br/>
 Jewel quest - Ivandyr&#39;s hoop/midnight/mallet<br/>
 Hollow skull quest - jeweled skull<br/>
 Red V quest - Bullsmasher<br/>
 Lens quest - staff of the observers<br/>
 Trueshot quest - trueshot bow<br/>
 Centaur quests - crafted armor<br/>
<br/>
 Did I miss any?<br/>
