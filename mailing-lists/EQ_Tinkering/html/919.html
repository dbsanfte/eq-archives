<div id="ygrps-yiv-129452273">Hail Tinkers,<br/>
<br/>
The following is an email thread between myself and the webadmin of Cazic<br/>
Thule<br/>
Corner (CTC) which is the site that had the item info pic for gnomish<br/>
fireworks.<br/>
<br/>
The summary is:<br/>
1) The fireworks were created from tinkering (not given out by GM and not<br/>
looted off mob)<br/>
2) The recipe exists in-game (not found through trial-n-error and not leaked<br/>
by Verant)<br/>

Hail,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question regarding the following Tinkering Equipment Item:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqcorner.com/equipment/items/gnomishfirework.htm">http://www.eqcorner.com/equipment/items/gnomishfirework.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I understand that the source of the image is anonymous.  I would like to<br/>
clarify one thing if you know the answer or can ask the person who<br/>
contributed the image.<br/>
<br/>
How did they acquire the gnomish fireworks item:<br/>
1) They created it in a toolbox via tinkering<br/>
2) They were rewarded the item by a GM run dynamic quest<br/>
3) They looted it off of a mob.<br/>
<br/>
I assure you that this image is going to cause a lot of stress among the<br/>
tinkers.  Knowing whether it came from (1), (2), or (3) will reduce that<br/>
stress greatly.<br/>
<br/>
There is still residual stress from a collabsible fishing pole which was<br/>
acquired<br/>
through (2).  It launched a still ongoing crusade to find the recipe.  At<br/>
first,<br/>
much paranoid accusation surrounded the image.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that the gnomish fireworks also came from (2).<br/>
<br/>
If they came from (1), then I would ask whether the recipe was discovered<br/>
by accident or from an in-game recipe.  I am not asking for the recipe<br/>
(and not refusing it).  I simply want to know where the legions of tinkerers<br/>
should be looking to discover the answer on their own.   I.E. a hint.<br/>
<br/>
Any and all information I receive will be forwarded to the tinkering<br/>
one_list<br/>
and to Lucas, admin of the tinkering website.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for any relief you can give the Tinkers of Norrath,<br/>

Next time I see him I will ask him ... however the reason he asked to remain<br/>
anon is because (he told me this, don&#39;t know how true or untrue it is): he<br/>
did in fact make both the fireworks and the fishing pole ... somehow knows<br/>
the secret to making them both.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll see if I can at least get him to tell me &quot;how&quot; he got the recipe .. but<br/>
I know for a fact that he won&#39;t tell me how to make them :)<br/>

<br/>
Okie ... I asked him last night in the game and he said that you can find<br/>
the recipes for both the fishing pole and fireworks within the game.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps ya :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kat,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you very much.  Well, it ends the theory that it was found through<br/>
&gt; trial and error and it ends the theory that the recipe was leaked by a GM<br/>
&gt; or some such.  It does help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m fowarding our email thread to the one_list now.<br/>

<br/>
NP .. just wish I could have gained more information for you.  He&#39;s very<br/>
protective of the recipes it seems ... I guess with somewhat good reason :)<br/>
