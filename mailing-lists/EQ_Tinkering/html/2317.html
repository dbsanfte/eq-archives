<div id="ygrps-yiv-855464347">I haven&#39;t seen him on EQ in ages.  We were trying to establish an Ak&#39;Anonian<br/>
government as part of Fennin Ro&#39;s Roleplaying Collective (a group of<br/>
individuals and guilds working to enhance RP).  Fulcrum did TONS of work on<br/>
the foundations for Ak&#39;Anon and led the work on an exhaustive indepth series<br/>
of documents and recommendations.  We even had an historic &quot;Congress&quot; with a<br/>
handful of other gnomes to talk about the Ak&#39;Anon government.  This was in<br/>
April/May/June.  Probably bad timing since summer was starting and ppl get<br/>
busy with RL.  Anyway, he said later he would be busy, but would try to keep<br/>
up with both the Tinkering and Ak&#39;Anon gov&#39;t web sites.  He must be busier<br/>
than we thought since I haven&#39;t seen him for months. <br/>
Fulcrum, we need ya! Come back!  <br/>

All I can tell you is that he hasn&#39;t had an update to his site since July<br/>
21st.  I don&#39;t think he has had much time to do much work on it.  I can<br/>
just imagine how many e-mails he has in his In Box. (Eeeeks!) Too busy<br/>
playing EQ perhaps? ;)  I was able to connect to it today, however, with<br/>
no problems.<br/>
