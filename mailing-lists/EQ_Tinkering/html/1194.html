<b>Subject:</b> my thoughts on Tinkering <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-671309322">Well the scuba gear info is refreshing.  I suddenly want to be a tinkerer<br/>
again!  It sounds as if there were two underwater breathers (aqua lung and<br/>
rebreather)... or was it two parts to facilitate underwater breathing?  (all<br/>
this assumes that the info is correct)  If there are two parts one might<br/>
control the number of charges you have left?  Or they both let you breath<br/>
underwater but one might be unlimited and the other limited?<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought that if the item was not unlimited then it would be<br/>
virtually useless because everyone would just get a fishbone earring, but if<br/>
the fishbone earring was REAL hard to get (or maybe made limited, hehe) then<br/>
maybe people would want the scuba gear instead... and we could have repeat<br/>
business selling the scuba refills. :)<br/>
<br/>
Another thought I had was on the fishing pole.  Does anyone remember that<br/>
device someone made that would fish for them when they were away from their<br/>
computer?  What was that thing called?  Anyway he had it setup so that he<br/>
could make all kinds of money fishing while he went down to the pub and had<br/>
a beer.  It just kept clicking on the keys and the mouse button.  Verant<br/>
made the pole break so that you couldn&#39;t do that anymore.  So it is unlikely<br/>
that the collapsible fishing pole will ever be unbreakable.  Besides since<br/>
any race can make it, if it was truly profitable then we would have<br/>
barbarian fishing pole muscling in on our turf.  But perhaps a collapsible<br/>
fishing pole/animated bait combo would raise your skill level or you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t lose your bait as often... something like that.<br/>
