&gt;yeh, there is probably no practical use for the numbers, but it&#39;s been a<br/>
&gt;while since my brain got any exercise...and being realistic is no fun :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;realized that i forgot order is not important again...<br/>
&gt;current guess is 13^8/8!...~20231<br/>
&gt;or 13^4/4!=~1120 for 4 slots used...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;hmmm...that seems to be not quite right either...dunno...gonna have to go<br/>
&gt;find some old textbooks or something...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the way you came up with that formula is good. (It must be, because<br/>
it was what I came up with at first, lol)<br/>
Problem is it is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose we have 13 types of items in 100 slots.<br/>
<br/>
That gives us 13^100/100! which is less than 1. (Can&#39;t be right.)<br/>
<br/>
The other problem I had with it is that it does not produce an integer<br/>
number. What is 0.3 combinations?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish this was even worth 2 cp...</div>
