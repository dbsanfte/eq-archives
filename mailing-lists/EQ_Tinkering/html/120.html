<div id="ygrps-yiv-302785114">I can confirm we (A full group of Lvl30+) went down there and we were<br/>
running around the town when One of my party said &quot;Hey Zak they got a<br/>
tinkering book here&quot; I said, &quot;Is it volume 14 or 15&quot; he said, &quot;No it&#39;s...&quot;<br/>
and then some idiot Dark elf wizard pulled the whole zone down on us.  He<br/>
said he believed that it was 12 or 13 and he said the price was ridiculous<br/>
in the thousands of PP range.  Haven gone back yet since I don&#39;t have that<br/>
kind of cash and we went to Guk instead.<br/>

[sorry if this is sent multiple times. Onelist is being crappy to me]<br/>

Ok. Not to get everyone too excited, but I&#39;ve heard rumors of a third<br/>
tinkering book. Someone said there are clockworks and gnomes in<br/>
Solusek A and also that there is a tinkering book for sale in there.<br/>
But it was said that is costs 7000pp. I camped last night in the entrance<br/>
to Solusek A, so I&#39;ll try to check it out tomorrow and report back. I<br/>
won&#39;t be walking out with the 7000pp book, but I&#39;ll hopefully have<br/>
the title of it *grin*.<br/>
<br/>
Any confirmations of this? I did hear this directly from someone in game<br/>
inside Solusek A, so I wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;d be wrong. How&#39;s everyone&#39;s<br/>
tinkering skill going? Any master tinkers yet or is it too expensive?<br/>
