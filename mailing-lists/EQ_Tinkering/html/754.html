<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013898562">Yep, I think ocean when I think waves, and I think waves when I think ocean.<br/>
If you believe the clue at all I&#39;d say it is a waste of time to look in any<br/>
bodies of water other OOT, Erud&#39;s crossing, and possibly Dagnor&#39;s and Lake<br/>
Rathe.<br/>
<br/>
As far as OOT, there is the hill giant Gronnit &lt;sp&gt; that stands in the water<br/>
near Pirate Isle, viewable from the boat. If you watch him a while he&#39;ll<br/>
walk up on shore and stand around very briefly before walking back. I always<br/>
thought it&#39;d be neat if he were standing on something there in the water and<br/>
you could sneak over and steal it when he was away. Check it out if you are<br/>
near the island, and check again at another time because the item may not<br/>
always be spawned. Interesting idea at least &lt;grin&gt;. FYI there is an evil<br/>
Gnome Pirate there that is part of an Ak&#39;Anon enchanter quest, so the whole<br/>
thing is not *totally* un-related to Gnomes.<br/>
<br/>
Also, FYI, there is indeed a high level, aggro NPC in the underwater cave in<br/>
Everfrost (north side under the west river fork). The cave is very, very<br/>
dark, and also quite large. There is a glowing room with the rod for the Ice<br/>
Comet quest in a little shack surrounded by ice bones. From there take a<br/>
left I think and hug the right wall and you&#39;ll see him, a guy named<br/>
Mc&lt;something&gt; standing next to a little goblin diver. I think he was a<br/>
barbarian or human, but did not get close at all. In any case he conned red<br/>
at L29 and was aggro to my usually-lovable agnostic barbarian warrior. I<br/>
have heard rumor that he is L35. I have never heard of him being killed, so<br/>
cannot say what he drops; not many people even seem to know he exists. I<br/>
doubt that he is related to tinkering, but would be a fun fight so go kill<br/>
him anyway &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
