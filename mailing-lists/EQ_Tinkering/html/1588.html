<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749562158">In reality, the bootstrutter pack IS weight reducing, by 10% as someone<br/>
earlier posted. If you put something heavy like a two handed sword in it,<br/>
you&#39;ll see that it drops a pound or two.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the gnomish glow rods are just light sources, but they look pretty<br/>
darn spiffy (like a glowing reddish candle). Besides, it has &#39;gnomish&#39; in<br/>
the name of it, so we should all carry one with pride. ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I can confrim this as I completed the duster quest last night and got<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bootstrutters Pack (Isn&#39;t the Gnome who gives you the Jboots quest named<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bootstrutter?  Heh - anyone try giving him his pack back?  Just an<br/>
idea).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had one of those packs for a few weeks now.  Got it for the Duster<br/>
&gt; quest.  It&#39;s a nice item, but it&#39;s NOT a weight-reducing pack.  It&#39;s just<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; 10-slot backpack, lore, nodrop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; These junk items that you talk about - I&#39;ve never seen them before.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gnomish Glow Rods?  Perhaps these are the rods needed for the thermal<br/>
&gt; &gt; cloak...  I just received a patchwork cloak after completing the Red V<br/>
&gt; &gt; quest - I&#39;ll try to do the Duster and scrap metal quests a few more<br/>
times<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get these Rods and try a few combinations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also have a Gnome Glow Rod.  I got it for turning in scrap metal.  As<br/>
far<br/>
&gt; as I can tell, it&#39;s just a light source.  I have had comments from people<br/>
&gt; asking me what the heck I was carrying, so they don&#39;t seem to be that<br/>
&gt; common.<br/>
