<div id="ygrps-yiv-577632698">I highly doubt that the third book or even any tinkering info would be found <br/>
from killing gnomes.Why would we have to kill our own to get something for a <br/>
gnome only skill.that would mean taking faction hits just to get something <br/>
that a gnome should have .But thats just my opinion, so im not going out <br/>
killing any gnomes for it.I think that you are looking in the wrong place by <br/>
doing that<br/>
