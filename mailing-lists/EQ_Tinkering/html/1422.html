<b>Subject:</b> Tinkering Cap <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-303715770">People don&#39;t know there is a cap so if the wanted to power level a Gnome o<br/>
16th to let him tinker away they would have.  The cap only hurts people, it<br/>
will not crush the market.  No one cares about tinkering because there isn&#39;t<br/>
many useful things to make.  In your example you said a master jeweler still<br/>
needs enchanted bars more than likely the guild is going to provide those for<br/>
you, hence it doesn&#39;t matter.  The major reason I have heard from people why<br/>
they will NOT take up tinkering is because, &quot;it sucks there is noting to make<br/>
and it takes several hundred plat per skill point&quot;  I have heard that from so<br/>
many people BOTH of the level 50 Gnomes on my server said that, Silvera and<br/>
Grumblethorpe.  The cap should be removed because tinkering is just like any<br/>
other trade skill with the exception only gnomes can advance in it, and I say<br/>
advance in it because any race can tinker.  I have tinkered with every race<br/>
except trolls and ogres because I kept getting killed by the guards, my dark<br/>
elf was a necro so he had invis and I had good faction with the merchant.<br/>
