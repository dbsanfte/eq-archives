<div id="ygrps-yiv-672371007">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I started an attempt to tinker before the patch, but gave up after I surfed the internet and heard that tinkering did not pay off and was very expensive.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been playing EQ for about 3 or 4 months now and so far all my pp has gone towards spells.  In fact, my 18 level gnome wizard has a total of 16pp to her name.  With that in mind, what kind of advise can you give me?  Is tinkering worth spending my hard earned pp on that I have been saving for my 20 level spells?  With the new patch, I have high hopes of finally making some pp.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have going to ask a dumb question.  What is a gem chopper?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
