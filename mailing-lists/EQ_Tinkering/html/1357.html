<b>Subject:</b> Charging for combines <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-225084603"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Unless they were a guildmate then yes, I would charge them - I spent a lot of<br/>
&gt; time, effort and money getting my tinkering skill to where it is, and people<br/>
&gt; like this hypothetical person you mention who wan&#39;t the quick reward with none<br/>
&gt; of the effort annoy me. No, I&#39;m not charging them for the 30sec combine, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; charging them for the hours I spent combining items over and over to get a skill<br/>
&gt; increase.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  Quite frankly, I&#39;ve stopped answering /shouts /oocs /etc&#39;s for someone<br/>
asking to get something combined unless they&#39;re offering the money in their<br/>
original request.  There are just to many people wanting handouts, and it has begun<br/>
to annoy me.  I do however still bind for free.  Different issue in my opinion.</div>
