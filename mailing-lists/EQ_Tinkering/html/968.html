<b>Subject:</b> Gnomish Fireworks - Ugh! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-848869517">I just made a bunch of sets of gnomish fireworks...The recipe is <br/>
Firewater (1)<br/>
Bat Wing (1)<br/>
Metal Shaft (1). <br/>
<br/>
 This costs around a gold to make and produces 4 separate fireworks. <br/>
They differ in that each one has a different effect (Fireworks1,<br/>
Fireworks2, Fireworks3, Fireworks4).   Unfortunately the effect of each<br/>
one is horrible!  They might be broken, but as of right now they do<br/>
nothing but send a TINY colored flame straight out from your body and<br/>
lasts about a tenth of a second at best.  The difference between the 4<br/>
types seems to be color of the flame. That is IF you even catch a<br/>
glimpse of the flame (if you blink you will miss it).  About the only<br/>
good thing I can say about them is that Im glad they cost me next to<br/>
nothing to make, since for now they seem to be a complete waste.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this was an isolated experience and that other people have more<br/>
luck than I do with them.<br/>
