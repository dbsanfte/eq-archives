<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549373083">This being the 3rd useless message I&#39;ve seen from you in my short time on<br/>
this list, I am prepared to decline your help.<br/>
<br/>
If all you can do is talk about how unreasonable people are (without<br/>
providing any useful tinkering info), please go away.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&gt; Why do you all act like this? I try to help, but you decline it. If what<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; want is for me to truly leave with my information, then that is what I<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; do. I will leave the choice up to you. I&#39;m trying to apologize by helping,<br/>
&gt; but you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; out here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What I<br/>
&gt; have to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just want<br/>
&gt; to check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all hate<br/>
&gt; me so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because<br/>
&gt; you think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all<br/>
&gt; with out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; or decline it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The fact that your not willing to reveal what it is you have to do, so<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt;others on the list, some of whom are in the high level 40s can do this<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; &gt;suggests that your simply back to troll some more.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So why don&#39;t you just kindly leave?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Oh wait, you want to troll a bunch of messages so then you can come back<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt;a couple days and say something like, &quot;Well, I found the important thing,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but since you all were unkind to me I won&#39;t reveal it, but this time its<br/>
&gt; &gt;your alls faults, not mine.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Gimme a break and just leave...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Rotgut<br/>
