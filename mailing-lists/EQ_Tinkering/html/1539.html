<b>Subject:</b> Gnomad is gone! What happened to the research?!?! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961363505">Since Gnomad&#39;s guide is gone, what will we do now? I cant find any other informative guide on the net that has recipies! <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a old copy of gnomads pages to send to me? Or perhaps a recipie list/trivial list to send to me?<br/>
<br/>
Anything at this point is appreciated...I just made my tinkering level and the best guide out there has been deleted!<br/>
<br/>
ACK! <br/>
