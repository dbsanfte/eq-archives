<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306456416">You have to complete the Clockwork C quest first (and possibly more then<br/>
once).  Go to Manik and say &quot;I am a new warrior.&quot;  He will then give you a<br/>
shiny card to give to the clockworks with a C in there name one at a time.<br/>
 One is located near the throne room, one is on the island in the lake<br/>
near the cleric/thieves guild, one is by the tunnel leading into the area<br/>
with water wheel and one is by the entrance to the Mines of Malfunction<br/>
(this one will alternate with an &quot;A&quot; clockwork).  Give all four of the<br/>
blackboxes you receive to Manik for faction/minor item.  He will then give<br/>
you a blackbox that you have to give to Jogl - the gnome by the windmills<br/>
with the pet clockwork Charlotte.  Jogl will give you one of two &quot;writen<br/>
orders&quot; that you give to the merchant in the warrior guild.  The merchant<br/>
will either give you to Red V quest or the Duster quest.  If he gives you<br/>
the Duster quest, then the Duster X will spawn by the broken wheelbarrow<br/>
near the second tinker merchant in the room with the cleric guild.<br/>

&gt; How do I get this Duster Report to make him spawn? I already got Duster<br/>

&gt; I can confrim this as I completed the duster quest last night and got<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; Bootstrutters Pack (Isn&#39;t the Gnome who gives you the Jboots quest named<br/>
&gt; Bootstrutter?  Heh - anyone try giving him his pack back?  Just an<br/>
&gt; idea).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These junk items that you talk about - I&#39;ve never seen them before.<br/>
&gt; Gnomish Glow Rods?  Perhaps these are the rods needed for the thermal<br/>
&gt; cloak...  I just received a patchwork cloak after completing the Red V<br/>
&gt; quest - I&#39;ll try to do the Duster and scrap metal quests a few more<br/>
&gt; times<br/>
&gt; to get these Rods and try a few combinations.<br/>

&gt; &quot;Quasinom de Plume is my quasi nom-de-plume&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Duster V is still a rare spawn around the enterence.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Duster X now only spawns once you turn in the report, he spawns down<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; tinkering merchant, and doesnt wander anymore, he just stands in<br/>
&gt; place.<br/>
&gt;  &gt; I did this quest once (and am waiting for Duster V to do it again)<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; got the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Bootstrutters Pack, 10slot backpack with 10% weight reduction..<br/>
&gt;  &gt; A lot of the junk that you used to get for this quest (back when<br/>
&gt; Dustre<br/>
&gt;  &gt; X was a<br/>
&gt;  &gt; wandering rare spawn) can now also be gotten by turning in scrap<br/>
&gt; metal<br/>
&gt;  &gt; from<br/>
&gt;  &gt; rogues to Sanfryd Feathertop (who used to be called Sanfryd<br/>
&gt;  &gt; somethingelse).<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Amongst the normal lanterns/shield junk you can also get gnomish glow<br/>
&gt;  &gt; rods, and<br/>
&gt;  &gt; chunks of metal ore that look like balls instead of bricks...<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Getting the duster report seems to be less common than it used to be<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt;  &gt; well - I<br/>
&gt;  &gt; get the Red V report a lot more now, previously it was the other way<br/>
&gt;  &gt; around..<br/>
