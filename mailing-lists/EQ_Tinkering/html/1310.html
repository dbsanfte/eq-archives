<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021980723">You get a small wooden shield or something like it... Worthless in general, <br/>
except for faction adjustments... I think it helps with the Eldritch <br/>
Collective.  I got killed in a few seconds trying to take out Gearheart so <br/>
I don&#39;t recommend it.  A friend of mine managed to kill him as Gearheart <br/>
was apparently wandering near the zone (someone attacked and managed to run <br/>
away from the farie onslaught).  The quest is supposed to be for a <br/>
low-level character... Yeah, right.  Level 29 wizard dead in about 20 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still hopeful that they will make some type of Tinkering quest given <br/>
out by the Eldritch Collective when you get your faction high enough.. The <br/>
Collective are &#39;The Tinkerers&#39; aren&#39;t they?<br/>

&gt;grouped together.  If memory serves they cast nasty spells too.  While<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re there you can do the gearheart quest and tell us what it rewards.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve never heard of anybody completing that quest. </span></blockquote></div>
