&gt; Has anyone tried just going on the test server and seeing if that gnome<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; is selling those other 2 books sells the 3rd one? The gm he talked to in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; chat room said he was on the test server and had them. Maybe there testing<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; new item no one has discovered or has been able to make and want to see if<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; works before puting on live servers. I would do this myself but for some<br/>
&gt; reason the unrest.xm_ file won&#39;t download fully from the patch. oh well.<br/>
Tell<br/>
&gt; me what you find. or don&#39;t find.<br/>
