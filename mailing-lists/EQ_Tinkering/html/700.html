&gt; The coins are for something else, but the water clue at least makes me<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; of something.  There&#39;s a really deep section of water at the bottom of<br/>
&gt; Akanon by the mines.  I tried swimming to the bottom as a newbie, but<br/>
didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have the air.  Later, once my swimming was at a reasonable level, I did<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; it down and tried swimming into the walls in all directions.  I was really<br/>
&gt; looking for a passage or something like that.  If anything was lying on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; ground and didn&#39;t stand out, I could easily have missed it.  Anyway, it&#39;s<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; bit strange for the &#39;abyss&#39; to be there without a purpose.  Well lets hope<br/>
&gt; it isn&#39;t just a newbie deathtrap.<br/>
