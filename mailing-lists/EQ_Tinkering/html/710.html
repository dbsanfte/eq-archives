I understand your feelings, but I don&#39;t think that we should. You see I <br/>
myself approaced him VERY cautiously, so if we had tons of people bothering <br/>
him,then he might close up completely, let me talk to him again, I was <br/>
planning on it anyway. Maybe I can use some swaying words to get him to <br/>
reaveal what he knows.</div>
