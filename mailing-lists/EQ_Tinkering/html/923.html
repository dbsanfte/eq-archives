<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952794587">None of what I mention here are facts so don&#39;t take them as facts. I am just <br/>
going from what little I now.<br/>
<br/>
    While I was riding on the boat to fp i decided to bring some reading <br/>
along. (EX: tinkering books). While reading it over I was thinking if any of <br/>
these things could be hints on how to make some other stuff or find the <br/>
missing book. Well here are some suggestions to check into. Talk to King <br/>
Akannon about it. In the book it mentions at the begging he is writing it for <br/>
him or something along those lines. His wife might be in the game (not sure). <br/>
He mentions her in the books as compassvess or something close to that. He <br/>
named the compass after her. Maybe she has something about it. Talk to the <br/>
zookeeper cause he was the one that practically sent them to the mino caves <br/>
to get a minotaur for the zoo. Try killing the minotaur in the zoo. He might <br/>
somehow have the book. Thats all I could think of about this. If anyone else <br/>
has some ideas send them in.<br/>
<br/>
Also I was thinking of some gnomish firework recipes. Maybe we have to add a <br/>
stalking probe and a flask of water and maybe some other item to make the <br/>
fireworks. It mentions in one of the books that he was worried about the <br/>
scouts exploding when the were doing something and he mentions a something <br/>
about a flask of water with it. Maybe add a metal rod or that cheaper rod <br/>
thing for the stalking probe to shoot out of when it comes in contact with <br/>
the water. shoots in the air and explodes. I dunno don&#39;t take these litteraly <br/>
and rely on them alot. There just some guesses i thought of.</div>
