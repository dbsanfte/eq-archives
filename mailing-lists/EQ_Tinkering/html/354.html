<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-572625495">Hello. Im new to this list and rarely play my gnome, but it appears to me<br/>
that if I was to make a colapsable fishing pole, I&#39;d tryusing something<br/>
other than a normal pole.. maybe 2 or 3 rods instead? It just seems (to me<br/>
anyway) that that would be the way to go. Do we know for sure that it<br/>
requires a fishing pole? I&#39;d be out there in a second combining poles and<br/>
wire and stuff, but I am so broke its not funny ;p<br/>
