<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646343512"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Has anybody bothered to do an analysis of the &quot;Clock of Ak&#39;Anon&quot; in south<br/>
&gt;qeynos?  There are some runes on the surface of it that look like some of<br/>
&gt;the runes that I&#39;ve seen in Tolkien&#39;s books.  I know Tolkien did a<br/>
&gt;comprehensive language system using runes and such, but I&#39;m not enough of a<br/>
&gt;fantasy geek to actually know any of the specifics.  Given that the clock <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;supposedly gnome built, it might have a tidbit of information on it.  The<br/>
&gt;fact that it&#39;s in plain sight would make it a prime target for a designer<br/>
&gt;with a sense of humor too.<br/>

<br/>
something like<br/>
<br/>
Qeynos<br/>
Gnomes of Akanon<br/>
<br/>
over and over and over and over and over.. =)<br/>
