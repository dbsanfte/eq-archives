<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083122548">Why do people have to keep playing games with us?  There&#39;s no reason not to<br/>
share this information other then to make us mad.  It&#39;s not like they&#39;re<br/>
profiting off this information.  The knowledge for the other trade skills<br/>
are always shared immediately.  Like when the new silk and cured silk was<br/>
introduced, the word was spread in days.  And people are making a lot of<br/>
money from making the silk armor.  (I&#39;ve personally made over 600pp selling<br/>
suits of cured silk armor to high level monks) Yet this tinkering info must<br/>
have been around for months yet the few people who know won&#39;t tell anyone<br/>
else even tho there&#39;s no profit to be made in making a collapseable fishing<br/>
pole.  *sighs*<br/>
<br/>
If the people who know where to get this book were on the Erollisi Marr<br/>
server, I&#39;d gladly offer 100pp for the book (maybe more), just because it<br/>
drives me nuts not knowing.<br/>
