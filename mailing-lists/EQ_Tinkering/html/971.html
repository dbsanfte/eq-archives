<div id="ygrps-yiv-127078745">Now that the cats out of the bag for the recipes.  I want to find the last<br/>
book, I don&#39;t know if the info released was from the same person who told<br/>
me the recipes, but, the only clue that I got from this person was that<br/>
the book was in Steamfront Mountains and NOT in Ak&#39;anon . <br/>
<br/>
Thats all I have got to go on, and he/she will not give me any more info.<br/>
I am thinking it may be a timed spawn somewhere.  The person who found the<br/>
book said it was by some freak accident and that he/she happened apon the<br/>
&quot;LOCATION&quot; by accident. He/she also said you need to be patient.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun with this, maybe we can find it out.  I don&#39;t understand if the<br/>
recipe is out why wouldn&#39;t this person want to release the info.  I dunno</div>
