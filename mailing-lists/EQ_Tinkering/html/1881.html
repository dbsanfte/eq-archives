<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182463861">If your on bristlbane, and want to tinker goo stuff, your a little late, I <br/>
have a guildmate who&#39;s already up there in skill. As for pearl shards, it may <br/>
have been mentioned on this list before, but you never know, it could be a 49 <br/>
level mage research item, because I knoe we use jade shards. I&#39;m am mage <br/>
myself<br/>
