<div id="ygrps-yiv-652983131">In the context of the Deepwater Harpoon/Deep-Six<br/>
Cutlass quest it isn&#39;t &quot;stupid&quot; at all. <br/>
<br/>
Euridites split off from the rest of society on<br/>
purpose. Jogl was part of a consortium that attempted<br/>
to build a bridge from Qeynos to Odus. I can also<br/>
assume Prexus would be none to pleased about someones<br/>
attempt to build a bridge through his oceanic domain<br/>
and has asked his followers the Deepwater Knights to<br/>
put an end to this bridge building venture. Not to<br/>
mention Euridites in general would be upset about<br/>
someone who sought to create a faster means of travel<br/>
to their secluded city. <br/>
<br/>
Just because you don&#39;t understand the history of the<br/>
quest doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s &quot;stupid&quot;.<br/>

&gt; There is a problem there though - Jogl is a target<br/>
&gt; for a Paladin quest, the<br/>
&gt; Deepwater Harpoon/Deep-Six Cutlass.. Yeah I know its<br/>
&gt; stupid for a Paladin<br/>
&gt; to kill a gnome, along with a dwarf and a human, but<br/>
&gt; thats Verant for ya.<br/>
