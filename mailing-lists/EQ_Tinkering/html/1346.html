<b>Subject:</b> RE: Tinkering should be like pottery <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122687487">It&#39;s all price vs. performance.  If tinkering was as easy to boost as<br/>
pottery (which has to be the easiest trade skill in the game), then<br/>
everything we&#39;d make would have to be gimped to the level of our fireworks.<br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t make anything that easy unless it is near useless.<br/>
