<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238629475">Gordon really has no idea how wrong he is.  People<br/>
don&#39;t care that they can get infinite EB forever, they<br/>
care that they can get FREE EB for the trip that<br/>
they&#39;re going on.  I&#39;m lucky if I can sell Aqualungs<br/>
anymore, and the last rebreather that I made is being<br/>
passed around to guildmates who need it while I&#39;m<br/>
playing in the planes.<br/>
<br/>
With the addition of magician summoned stones, this<br/>
market has gone to the crappers.  And now they took<br/>
away the lore tag as well.  Talk about adding insult<br/>
to injury =(  There&#39;s nothing that I can make and sell<br/>
to people which raises my skill anymore, so I&#39;m not<br/>
going to bother sinking any more money into it until<br/>
they revamp the trade.<br/>

&gt; Just thought I&#39;d pass on a quote from Gordon.  I can<br/>
&gt; see his point, but I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t quite agree with it.  Tho I&#39;m no where near<br/>
&gt; the tinkering level to<br/>
&gt; make them, I can invision a situation like this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A poor Gnome who&#39;s spent months and several thousand<br/>
&gt; plat, worked hard and <br/>
&gt; spent an insane amount of time and effort to master<br/>
&gt; tinkering walks into<br/>
&gt; the zone outside Kedge and shouts &quot;Rebreather for<br/>
&gt; sale 2k pp&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any mage walks in the zone outside Kedge and shouts<br/>
&gt; &quot;a bunch of<br/>
&gt; breathing stones for sale 20pp&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How many tells do you think the gnome will get?  :(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Q: This latest patch just made the mages 1-charge<br/>
&gt; water breathing stones<br/>
&gt; non-lore. I already had a heck of a time selling my<br/>
&gt; aqualungs/rebreathers.<br/>
&gt; Now any 50 lev can walk into unrest and offer 20pp<br/>
&gt; for a backpack full of<br/>
&gt; stones to any 20th level mage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A: This really shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Sure, they<br/>
&gt; might be non-lore, but<br/>
&gt; they are summoned so they will disappear on log out<br/>
&gt; or on a lost <br/>
&gt; connection. Something that does unlimited enduring<br/>
&gt; breath is superior to<br/>
&gt; the stones. -Gordon<br/>
