<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301000623">Unfortunately we can&#39;t be too excited by this event.  First off, what you<br/>
saw was not the Gnomish Fireworks that can (hopefully soon) be tinkered. <br/>
You saw the spell Fireworks3 (that I&#39;m assuming a GM cast) which was a<br/>
magician spell but was removed from the game due it&#39;s graphic-intensive<br/>
effects that added a lot of lag to a zone.  Gnomish Fireworks are actually<br/>
pretty lame in comparison to the light show you saw.  Gnomish Fireworks<br/>
produce the effect of Fireworks1, the lowest form of this spell and<br/>
consists of a small orangish fireball to shoot from your hands (almost<br/>
looks like a bottle rocket on fire). It also appears to only shoots<br/>
forward and not into the air (I could be mistaken about this).  The<br/>
&quot;fireworks&quot; will not cause any damage and essentially they will be used<br/>
for weddings, special occassions, reunions, celebrations and anytime else<br/>
you want to have a &quot;fancy&quot; lightshow.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m guessing you want to now where I got this info from.  Just to be<br/>
clear on this I can not tinker them nor do I know the recipe (wish I did<br/>
though).  I have one Gnomish Fireworks that was given to me by a GM on my<br/>
server, since they really are just a novelty item anyways.  (Oh and btw: <br/>
I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s where everyone else is getting their &quot;tinkered&quot; goods<br/>
from as certain GM&#39;s can summon up any item in the game at will - if this<br/>
is the case then some GM&#39;s might be abusing their powers by supplying<br/>
friends with tinkered goods to sell).  If you want to see what the item<br/>
looks like, fell free to msg me in game and I&#39;ll show it to you. (but I&#39;m<br/>
not setting it off yet - however I might advertise a minor event where us<br/>
Gnomes on Mith Marr can all get together one day and discuss tinkering &quot;in<br/>
person&quot; and use the fireworks as the &quot;Grand Finale&quot; - perhaps we could<br/>
even invite the GM&#39;s and let them know our discontent with the state of<br/>
tinkering.)  <br/>
<br/>
After questioning the GM further on the state of tinkering, he had no clue<br/>
whether the third book existed or not.  However I do have the GM&#39;s e-mail<br/>
address and I intend on asking him a variety of questions.  If there are<br/>
any particular questions you would like ask, please let me know and I&#39;ll<br/>
forward them on to the GM.  Hope this helps out a little,<br/>

&gt; believe it. . now based that the highest level at this time was only<br/>
&gt; bout<br/>
&gt; 8ish. . must have been a GM. . there was one online. . and that was the<br/>
&gt; busiest zone . . . I did shout out to see who was making them but got no<br/>
&gt; response.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However it does provide me with that glimmer that they are out there<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; waiting to be found. . if you haven&#39;t seen them go off. . its<br/>
&gt; green/blueish<br/>
&gt; trails going up. . which explode in the big firework white fashion. .<br/>
&gt; jsut<br/>
&gt; thought. . . DAMN shoulda taken a screenie =(<br/>
