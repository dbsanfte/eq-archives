<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610302921">Last night I did my first tinkering of my gnomish career.  I spent about<br/>
60pp after selling back everything I made and raised my skill from 50 to 58.<br/>
<br/>
If the skill cap is indeed (lvl * 5) - 13 (thanks Diabloklr) I have quite a<br/>
way to go before my lvl 18 gnome wiz hits 77.  Time to make some moola!!<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did learn last night.  Tinkering rocks!  I love it.  I have<br/>
never had so much fun with a trade skill.  There are all kinds of things to<br/>
make.<br/>
<br/>
Also, last night people asked to buy a spyglass, cams, and a compass from me<br/>
when they heard I was trying to tinker.  So there is a market for some of<br/>
this stuff even though the market may be small.<br/>
