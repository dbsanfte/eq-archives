<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873866859">If I was to hazard a guess, I would assume that the gem cutter would<br/>
increase a jewel smiths&#39; skill level in a similar way that the mechanical<br/>
lockpicks provide a bonus to lockpicking.  It would make sense since a lot<br/>
of jeweler&#39;s are upset about the cap imposed on their skill.  This is just<br/>
a guess however.<br/>
