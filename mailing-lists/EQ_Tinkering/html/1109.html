<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091997248">Hi<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to make a few telesopes last night, but i even failed at the fishing poles and they are trivial ? what the hell is that i failed 8 times out of 10 on them. so in the end it cost me<br/>
2000-300 pp (not sure didnt look how much i hadde on me when i started)  to make 2 Telescopes. I sold 1 for 90 pp. So if i am gonna make any more of them i wont sell for under 100 Plat, itï¿½s just not worth it.<br/>
