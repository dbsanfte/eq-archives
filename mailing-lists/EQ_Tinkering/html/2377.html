<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272655821">The gnomish pirate village, such as it is, has new tinkered items!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a telescopic eyepatch, trivial less than 104.<br/>
AC 3, face slot, effect: telescope<br/>
Basically a spyglass you can wear. Unlimited charges.<br/>
Recipe: velium shard, gnomish bolts, reflective shard, LQ Dire Wolf <br/>
Pelt.<br/>
I combined this in a Deluxe Tinkering Kit since it was available at <br/>
the same shop as the recipe book.<br/>
<br/>
Something that seems to imply it will make you invisible, I forget <br/>
what it was called exactly, a disapearing device or something.<br/>
<br/>
A whole new set of armor. I believe this is our gnomish tinkered <br/>
armor!  <br/>
It requires unstained small fine steel armor plus some other items <br/>
including batteries. There are 5 different batteries and the armor <br/>
needs to be recharges so it may have some built in effects that get <br/>
used up. Fortunately the batteries are available at the pirate village <br/>
and they STACK!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a new tinkering book that pretty clearly explains it all.<br/>
Tinkering gear available at the shop includes:<br/>
Deluxe Tinkering Kit<br/>
Thread, I believe it was steel thread though it may have been metal <br/>
thread<br/>
5 types of batteries (looks like various gems)<br/>
Velium Shard<br/>
<br/>
Shade and sweet water,<br/>
