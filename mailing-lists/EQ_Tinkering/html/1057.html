<b>Subject:</b> re:  gnome parties <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-567658024">Seeing all these responses to the party idea, I find myself asking the<br/>
inevitable question:  why not do a whole slew of parties?  We&#39;re all on<br/>
different servers so we can do a monthly gnomefest.  Say the first of each<br/>
month (since we&#39;re all so short) or if people find it easier to accomodate<br/>
weekend schedules, the first Saturday of the month.  Pick a different server<br/>
every month.  Maybe do some dueling competitions, some drunken casting, some<br/>
minor illusion art etc.  Perhaps see just how many level 1 chars it does<br/>
take to kill the mino hero (I&#39;ll bet on about 612, provided at least 20 are<br/>
on him at a time)...<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.  Preferably something that doesn&#39;t require a lot of<br/>
preparations besides buying an insane amout of alcohol and a little advance<br/>
warning to the GMs to let them know to expect heavy zone loads.<br/>
<br/>
What would we call it?  Gnomapalooza?  Gnomestock?  Gnomes are not Eunuchs<br/>
(that&#39;s one for you Gr0k)?</div>
