<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414967375">while I agree that Josh is an ass I think he&#39;s right, we should stop wasting time trying to guess the formula and work on finding the third book (which is actually the first). even if someone does guess the fishing pole there are still other things in the book that we don&#39;t know, like fireworks. I know this book exists and to prove it I&#39;ll give you the one formula I was able to get out of the person who has it. animated bait -- 1 cork, 1 spricket. the only purpose I can find for this is practice for non gnomes since the two things cost much more than bait and it&#39;s trivial for a gnome. personally I think the book is in Solusek&#39;s eye, the tinkering merchant has to be there for some reason. I just hope we don&#39;t have to kill a gnome for it.<br/>
