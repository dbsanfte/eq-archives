&gt;I have a question,<br/>
&gt;I am a 22 lvl wizzard with a pretty high INT, and so far I made 6 cams, 4<br/>
&gt;mechanical lockpicks,2 stalking probes, 5 compasses which are trivial but<br/>
&gt;my skill is not going up. Any ideas? Has anybody ever made a collapsable<br/>
&gt;fishing pole or a spy glass?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you are planning to raise your skill, you might want to forget it at the<br/>
moment.  Why?  As of the last big patch a week ago every trade skill<br/>
suffers from a huge increase penalty becuase bakers get the muffin tin back<br/>
:P  They did that even though the vast majority of trade skill items and<br/>
all of tinkering wasn&#39;t coded to return items.  So if you work on tinkering<br/>
you are paying tons more for the same skill increase vs. before the patch<br/>
WTG Verant!  I urge everyone to /feedback this.<br/>
<br/>
Spyglass is currently broken or requires the fishing pole which there is no<br/>
documentation on.<br/>

Verant still hasn&#39;t itemized the majority of high level mobs in the game.<br/>
