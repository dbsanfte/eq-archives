<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092346028">Eh. I actually like the cap. It means that a gnome that is a master tinkerer <br/>
has WORKED for it.. it&#39;s not some level 16 that was powerleveled by his <br/>
guild and given tons of cash to go wild with. Every copper I&#39;ve put into <br/>
tinkering has come the hard way, and I&#39;d be a little ticked if a level 16 <br/>
could undercut my prices because the cap is removed.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like that the cap was unadvertised, and it cost so many people so <br/>
much money to discover it. But it only helps those of us who have achieved <br/>
level and money the hard way.<br/>
<br/>
Rogue greed, maybe, but my opinion :)<br/>

&gt;I am planning a revolt of sorts on The Innoruuk server after the patch on <br/>
&gt;Dec 1st if they do not remove the tinkering cap.  I have gotten about 6 <br/>
&gt;guilds so far to help me with this, we are all going to petition that the <br/>
&gt;cap should be removed at the same time with anyone who doesn&#39;t have a clue <br/>
&gt;having the Guide/Gm refer to me.  If anyone else wanted to join in on the <br/>
&gt;fun please do I will have a<br/>
&gt;better idea what time next week<br/>
