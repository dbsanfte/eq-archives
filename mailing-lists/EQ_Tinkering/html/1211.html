<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-439129420">Well from speculations.  Tinker..seem to have a &quot;Spell Research&quot; level caps. <br/>
  Other Trade Skills does not seem to have level cap.  Fishing has a Level <br/>
Cap similar to Melee level cap (Level*5)+5...<br/>
<br/>
Spell Research seem to follow...level 16=50...then +5 on every level there <br/>
after. (anyone know the actual formula?)<br/>

Another thing found, I was checking out the guy (dwarf) that give out the <br/>
quest for Dragon Scale Armor in Rathe Mtn. (Inn near the Lake Rathe zone).  <br/>
Well, there&#39;s a gnome next to him who sell gems..(never seen him before).  <br/>
IF you hail this gnome, he talk about better stones and stones cutting (gem <br/>
cutting).   Well that seem to relate to the new tinker item GEM Cutter.  So <br/>
any info, you guys can give...(He won&#39;t say much about it.)<br/>
