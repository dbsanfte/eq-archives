&gt; Actually Skewers can be made with pottery. So you would just have to master<br/>
&gt; pottery. I do agree though that Verant needs to do something about it&#39;s economy.<br/>
&gt; It really hurts when the 1 basic item that tinker&#39;s can make costs 3PP to make,<br/>
&gt; but can be bought for 2PP!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. Do tinkered cams work yet?<br/>
