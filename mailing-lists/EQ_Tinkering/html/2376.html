 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve spent thousands of plat on various trade skills, mainly Jewelry.  But<br/>
not all at once.  The most I&#39;ve ever had at one time was a bit over 4000pp.<br/>
<br/>
All it took to get rid of that was 9 (nine) failures in a row attempting to<br/>
make a platinum ruby veil, which I had previously agreed to sell for 800pp.<br/>
This was at skill 199.<br/>
<br/>
Woo, I made money on that deal, you bet!<br/>
<br/>
I have since stopped making jewelry for strangers.  I make it for friends<br/>
and guildmates, cost of materials per attempt.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about getting a whole pile of cash before starting.  When you<br/>
get enough to make a few attempts, do it.<br/>
