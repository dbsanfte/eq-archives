<b>Subject:</b> Re: Fireworks recipe said to be in-game and working <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026614065">Though not directly related, there was a recent post from Brad stating that<br/>
they might be making the Firey Avenger quest a bit easier since no one has<br/>
found it (neither the quest nor the Sword) in 7 months that it&#39;s been in the<br/>
game.  Just becuase we haven&#39;t found the third book in all this time doesn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily mean it isn&#39;t there.<br/>

&gt; the person who donated those things did so to prove that the third book<br/>
&gt; exists<br/>
&gt; he refuses to give any help whatsoever even to his fellow Shadowed Souls<br/>
&gt; he says the book is easy to find, people just aren&#39;t patient enough to find<br/>
&gt; it<br/>

&gt; &gt; The following is an email thread between myself and the webadmin of Cazic<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thule<br/>
&gt; &gt; Corner (CTC) which is the site that had the item info pic for gnomish<br/>
&gt; &gt; fireworks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The summary is:<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) The fireworks were created from tinkering (not given out by GM and not<br/>
&gt; &gt; looted off mob)<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2) The recipe exists in-game (not found through trial-n-error and not<br/>
&gt; leaked<br/>
&gt; &gt; by Verant)<br/>
