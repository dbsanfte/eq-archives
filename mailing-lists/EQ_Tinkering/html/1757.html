<div id="ygrps-yiv-899022144">Well, with 104 CHA on my gnome warrior, I can buy the<br/>
lung components for roughly roughly 210pp.  I&#39;m fairly<br/>
confident that this is the lowest you can buy them for<br/>
(there is a min purchase price set in the game).  You<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have to bother making a second character. <br/>
You can get a crude stein, and a couple of jewelery<br/>
items and bump your CHA up plenty.  The vendor should<br/>
be at worst indifferent to you unless you&#39;ve killed<br/>
gnomes somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
(I tested my CHA theory by getting a bard friend<br/>
...bard had 200 CHA whom the vendor conned amiable...<br/>
to tell me his prices for the same items I was<br/>
checking.  The vendor conned indifferent to me, and I<br/>
had CHA 104.  Turns out the prices were the same.)<br/>
<br/>
My experiences have been varied, and I&#39;ve never once<br/>
had the books in my inventory.  With an int of 174,<br/>
and a wisdom of 111, I made 10 of 24 lungs, raised 5<br/>
points (to get from 102 to 107) which made each lung<br/>
cost about 504 plat.<br/>
<br/>
Now..  the strange part...  I didn&#39;t have my buddy to<br/>
lend me all of his int gear (had a friend lend me WIS<br/>
gear instead), so I tried some with an INT of 139, and<br/>
a WIS of 137.  I was 16 out of 24, and raised skill 7<br/>
points (from 107 to 114).  The made each lung cost<br/>
about 315 plat.  <br/>
<br/>
In both cases, I sell lungs for 400 plat. So if I sell<br/>
all of the lungs, I&#39;ll come out 300 or so plat<br/>
negative, but have raised up 12 points, at a cost of<br/>
about 27 plat per point.  Hopefully I can sell em all<br/>
=)<br/>
<br/>
Now on both occasions, I spent roughly 5,040pp.  With<br/>
an uber INT, I raised 5 points.  With both a medium<br/>
level INT and WIS, I raised 7 points and was more<br/>
successful (granted my skill was a little higher, that<br/>
only accounts for the increased successes, but not for<br/>
the increased skill point raises...Hmmmm *shrug*  ).  <br/>
<br/>
So based on my experiences, my advice would be to<br/>
balance out INT and WIS and try to keep them close to<br/>
each other, but at a decently medium-high level.  Keep<br/>
a spare set of CHA gear in the bank for making<br/>
purchases.  Just my experiences, take them how you<br/>
will.  =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some Tips:<br/>
&gt; I made a couple of rebreathers at skill 111, costed<br/>
&gt; me 25,000 pp to make 5<br/>
&gt; of them and 4 aqualungs where left<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I did is I made a High Elf pumpled CHA into<br/>
&gt; him, twinked him a bit he<br/>
&gt; had 198 CHA anyways I could buy all the stuff for<br/>
&gt; aqualungs for about 200<br/>
&gt; pp , and total cost for rebreather works to about<br/>
&gt; 1000 pp / try . costed<br/>
&gt; about 5000 pp each.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; so 1 / 5 tries it actualy worked on the avarage,<br/>
&gt; also have the tinkering<br/>
&gt; books in your GENERAL INVENTORY, aqualungs are<br/>
&gt; actualy 1 /2 tried with the<br/>
&gt; books about 1 / 3 without the books<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; anyways you get your main guy stand by the mule and<br/>
&gt; the mule buys ( takes 2<br/>
&gt; accounts tho ).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; anyways it works out great like that. But now the<br/>
&gt; problem is selling those<br/>
&gt; rebreathers on our server most people won&#39;t buy them<br/>
&gt; for over 2 KPP, and I<br/>
&gt; dont really like loosing 3,000 pp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyways the point of this thread is just to give<br/>
&gt; tips, and I think if you<br/>
&gt; guys also have some tips it would help a lot, on how<br/>
&gt; to maybe reduce the<br/>
&gt; cost or somthing like that etc.,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But we need to help each other<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ALSO: maybe we should ALL do a /feedback and ask<br/>
&gt; them to give more useble<br/>
&gt; stuff to tinkering, also maybe we can start a big<br/>
&gt; post on the Offical<br/>
&gt; Massage board, I think we should fight for our<br/>
&gt; skill, I mean look at<br/>
&gt; Shamans they got Alchamy working , and it is a great<br/>
&gt; class-only skill, why<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t we make Verant get off their ass and make them<br/>
&gt; do somthing about<br/>
&gt; tinkering.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; like also tell us if that Diamond Dust actualy<br/>
&gt; exist, like we been<br/>
&gt; searching for it for what 2 month now ?!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -50 lvl nec , Emarr, gnome, skill 111<br/>
