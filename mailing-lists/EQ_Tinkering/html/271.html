<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067130562">Ok, has anyone I mean ANYONE on this mailing list been able to raise your <br/>
skill in tinkering? Just on point? If you did tell us how so that we can try <br/>
that too. If no one on the list has risen even a point, then we REALLY need <br/>
to petition about tinkering. We need to tell them to start working on it and <br/>
get it at least as finished as brewing or another skill like that. I think <br/>
we are just going on a wild goose chaase here. We are probably looking for <br/>
something that doesn&#39;t even exist yet. Anyways, tinkering needs to be <br/>
changed so that skill points can be gotten easier anyway. We need to get <br/>
this through to Verant. We should no longer just stand by, hoping Verant <br/>
will come through, and spending tons of money trying to get skill points. We <br/>
must act!<br/>
