<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434190199">Hello Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m torn, I have to admit wanting to know about the pole, but dang it, if I were to spend several hundred/thousand plat trying to figure something out I sure as hell would not want to just give it away either to some joe with a skill of 50 =P.<br/>
<br/>
I would at least want a bit of time to get a jump on the competition before giving away my hard earned secrets.<br/>
<br/>
Thats why most of the EQ fan sites are not posting the location of newly found magic items, cuz they know if they did, a flock of players would swarm the place.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll figure it out eventually any way =)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
