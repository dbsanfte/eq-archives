&gt;Ok. Not to get everyone too excited, but I&#39;ve heard rumors of a third<br/>
&gt;tinkering book. Someone said there are clockworks and gnomes in <br/>
&gt;Solusek A and also that there is a tinkering book for sale in there.<br/>
&gt;But it was said that is costs 7000pp. I camped last night in the entrance<br/>
&gt;to Solusek A, so I&#39;ll try to check it out tomorrow and report back. I <br/>
&gt;won&#39;t be walking out with the 7000pp book, but I&#39;ll hopefully have<br/>
&gt;the title of it *grin*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the third e-mail I&#39;ve gotten regarding this item, supposedly called<br/>
a &quot;Bag of tinkerers&quot;  Judging from the insane price I doubt this item is<br/>
finished (5000pp is way more than you can ever hope to attempt to make with<br/>
the skill)...<br/>

&gt;inside Solusek A, so I wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;d be wrong. How&#39;s everyone&#39;s <br/>
&gt;tinkering skill going? Any master tinkers yet or is it too expensive?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most everyone&#39;s tinkering skill is at a standstill at the moment, including<br/>
mine.  The last big patch a week ago really destroyed the improvement rate.<br/>
