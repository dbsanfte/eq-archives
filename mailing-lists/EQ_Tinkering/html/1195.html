 You may want to stop as you are throwing a LOT of plat away. I have found<br/>
 book XXXIII and it has:<br/>
 <br/>
 Aqua Lung<br/>
 Re-Breather   (Aqua Lung with a longer duration)<br/>
 GemCutter     (Not sure what it is, but I think Jewelers will be happy with<br/>
 us!)<br/>
 <br/>
 I *WILL* be giving out the formulas, but I wanted to make some of the items<br/>
 to sell first.  I do have a &#39;deal&#39; if anyone wants the formulas early.  I<br/>
 want to make these items, but I&#39;m low on cash and need a money backer.  If<br/>
 someone is willing to back me, I&#39;ll give them the formula, but with the<br/>
 costs of even trying it, it will need a LOT of cash.  I plan on releasing<br/>
 all of them no later then December 1st (basically a month).<br/>
 <br/>
 I sent pages 1 and 2 to Gnomad to prove I have the book (and he can post it<br/>
 if he likes, it only shows one part of what you need.  I do not suggest just<br/>
 throwing things into our toolbox, it uses items that are NOT tinker items<br/>
 (like fireworks used batwings) so you will never just guess it.<br/>
 <br/>
 Estimated costs are about 200 for aqualung, about 500 - 600 for the<br/>
 rebreather, and I&#39;m not sure on the GemCutter as it needs a part I have<br/>
 never seen or heard of, but I think about 100-200 plat.<br/>
 <br/>
 And GNOME, these things are expensive! Especially the rebreather.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>MAN ARE YOU EVER SO LAME...What&#39;s the sence of you even posting? .....Nobody <br/>
is going to fund  your stuff unless you give them the recipie before <br/>
hand.......Also tinkering levels so slow  that thier may be only a handfull <br/>
of people that probly could tinker that high and you could be setting your <br/>
self up for such a low demand...because the less people know about them the <br/>
less they want them...low supply  and high demand is a good thing ,but you <br/>
have people that are stingy in this game...IF you dont have others in the <br/>
market for comparison shopping you can&#39;t  have people deciding that your sell <br/>
price is good....and they will wait longer to buy your wears...unless you <br/>
have a long line of desprate people waiting for it that dont know how to shop <br/>
around...Which isnt very likely.  Until a REAL post that does something that <br/>
it says it does comes along I wont believe you and most likely evry one else <br/>
wont .. ... Graphics can be manipulated in pictures submitted you know. Just <br/>
like that supposed flying machine   .... Sincerely Cloverleaf &lt;Fennin Ro  <br/>
