<br/>
I had a thought..... perhaps those being supported by their Guild can check <br/>
this out - aqua lung used.... all charges gone.... how much does a HIGH <br/>
charisma charchter get offered from a Merchant? Ineteresting to know whether <br/>
thats less than a Merchant offers for a charged one. It may not be very <br/>
much... but intersting to find out and as far as marketing goes a good sale <br/>
point &#39;you get x hundred plat back on selling to merchant....&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I am too poor to practise tinkering yet, and need another couple of levels to <br/>
get some benefit.... sigh, gave up the Guild I helped get started cos of some <br/>
flexibility on KStealing... so now I wander lonely as a Gnome,,,,,, <br/>
hehehe..... perhaps us independents should hire our tinkering skills out to <br/>
guilds.....?<br/>

ZERO diamond dust and WHAT does the gem cutter do... okokok it cuts gems... <br/>
