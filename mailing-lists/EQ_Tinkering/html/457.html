&gt; Minor Correction here.  The Glowing Stien was NOT part of the game until less than<br/>
&gt; 1 week before the spoiler went up.  It was the reward for the Brewers Compendium<br/>
&gt; Quest.  The quest, until recently, was broken.  It returned Pungala&#39;s head (Ogre<br/>
&gt; Head), not the compendium.  Many bartender&#39;s have tried this quest, and it was a<br/>
&gt; bartender who first completed it.   On a side note,  GM&#39;s informed several players<br/>
&gt; that the quest indeed worked, before the patch.  They then came back and said it<br/>
&gt; will be fixed in an up coming patch (Another Lie)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No the quest always worked, the problem was that no one had used all the proper spells<br/>
on the Ogre to raise the faction high enough.  That is why an enchanter was required<br/>
to do the quest, which was the part that the general population of norrath didn&#39;t<br/>
figure out until a week before the last patch.<br/>

<br/>
Bart:  Is there a Doggie Hell??<br/>
Homer:  Well.... Of course! There couldn&#39;t be a heaven if there weren&#39;t a hell.<br/>
Bart:  Who&#39;s in there??<br/>
Homer:  Oh, uh...Hitler&#39;s dog.  And that dog Nixon had, whassisname, um, Chester...<br/>
Lisa:  Checkers.<br/>
Homer:  Yeah! One of the Lassies is in there too.  The mean one---the one that mauled<br/>
