<div id="ygrps-yiv-127123342">Sorry to have annoyed you with the facts, Diablokilr,  life is like that<br/>
sometimes.  How long have I been on this list?  Around 6 months or so.  Do<br/>
I know the formula because I read the list?  No.  I know the formula<br/>
because I do both Research and Tinkering.  Since you&#39;ve been on the list<br/>
for so long, let me repost a message from 10/30/99 for you.<br/>

Yes.  For some reason, that&#39;s impossible to fathom, tinkering seems to<br/>
be on the same level cap as Caster Research - namely, 5 * (Level - 15).<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is a bug or deliberate but we should petition<br/>
Verant and ask that the cap be removed so that Tinkering is on a par<br/>
with the other trade skills (Tailor, blacksmith, etc.)<br/>

Why is that repost significant?  Because in the 6 months I&#39;ve been on the<br/>
list, that was the FIRST mention of a specific level cap and formula.  (If<br/>
you can find an earlier one, please post it.).  It is also the formula that<br/>
Gnomad put up on his site AFTER I posted it here.  As to how I came up with<br/>
the formula, that was simple.  I ran into it exactly the same way Mr.<br/>
Nelson did (as he explains quite eloquently in a recent post), by actually<br/>
doing the work.  I just figured it out sooner than he did, because I had<br/>
already run into the same cap using Caster Research and noticed the<br/>
parallels  in the level limits.  I&#39;d just LOVE to see the underlying math<br/>
behind your formula, please, please feel free to share it with us. - or at<br/>
least show us the post that you&#39;re quoting (i.e. date and author ) when you<br/>
say you remember the formula from your long experiences here.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Nelson now claims that the cap has been removed or altered (I&#39;m betting<br/>
removed) and I believe him.  Why?  Because he&#39;s actually doing the work,<br/>
not simply claiming he&#39;s been here for a while and remembers seeing someone<br/>
else post about it.  I haven&#39;t been tinkering since the last patch (on the<br/>
wrong continent) so I have not yet experienced the removal of the cap.  You<br/>
can bet I&#39;ll be running my little Gnome feet back to Ak&#39;Anon forthwith.<br/>
You should do the same - after you get your feet out of  your mouth :)<br/>
