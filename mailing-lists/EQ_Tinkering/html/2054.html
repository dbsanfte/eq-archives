<div id="ygrps-yiv-884369576">Not much help in that one specifically, but somewhat related ...<br/>
another way to get a great 100% weight reducing 10 slot bag, is to go<br/>
to SolB, kill Guano Harvester who is 15 lvl gob who hangs out near<br/>
the sonic Bats. That critter has the bag and we saw him about every<br/>
hour it seems; most everyone in our party got one. He remains visible<br/>
for a short time while he roams around the bats, but soon casts<br/>
inviso on himself. Will need to be in your mid-high 30&#39;s tho, to get<br/>
that far into the zone and hope to survive. But as a gnome that bag<br/>
is a blessing! I can now hold tons more stuff before I get<br/>
encumbered. But, it&#39;s a medium bag, which means it won&#39;t hold many<br/>
weapons, they being too big. The bag is called A Soiled Backpack, I<br/>
think and looks like an open backpack. And to anyone who knows about<br/>
this item, what would be the going price selling one?<br/>

Oops, realized its not really tinkering related...=)<br/>
