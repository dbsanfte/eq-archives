I dont know what the hell you outhers do but i think you need an marketing department.  I would never ever selll a aqua lung for 400 pp, thats just insane and plain stupid.<br/>
<br/>
900-1000 pp for it is fair i think  and   with a note with it that if they come back for an uppgrade to Rebreather for say 1000 more + componet cost. That would be around 1600 pp i think, is that right ?<br/>
<br/>
I dont sell the fishing pole and those outher low skill items outher if anyone order it, i get to many failures even  on trivial items to be worth making them and selling them at a large scale. Take Bow cam�s for example, i gor an order of 8 cam�s it took 12 tries to make 8, thats 4 failures and i sold them for 25 pp each, it�s almost nno profit at all so     in the futare i�m going to charge 30 pp for them i think if i even sell them.<br/>

&gt; Fairy guards were blue to me at 30, the princess was white to me.  On<br/>
&gt; Aqualungs you guys are selling them ALL WRONG!!!!!  I have 15 orders at 1kpp<br/>
&gt; each for a 50 charge item, yes 1,000pp per lung.  you need to make it seem<br/>
&gt; as though this is the most difficult thing in the world to make never sell<br/>
&gt; them directly either only take orders for them.  I have so many level 50<br/>
&gt; druids who want them because they hate having to carry enough fish scales<br/>
&gt; for their party.<br/>
