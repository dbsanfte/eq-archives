<b>Subject:</b> New to this forum....Infravision goggles <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-863121497">I be new to this forum, So I am not sure if it has been discussed or not, <br/>
Has anyone figured out the other pieces to the infravision goggles yet?  I <br/>
am just not sure which pieces to start trying out, I was thinking maybe some <br/>
metal twine to connect the lenses. Has this been discussed, anyone brought <br/>
any ideas into it?  And also for those of you who haven&#39;t heard, I&#39;ve had 2 <br/>
people mail me on existance of the lenses.. They are called the &quot;Lens of <br/>
Glowing Amber&quot; Which makes me pretty much think that they are definately the <br/>
first component.  And they are dropped by a froglock summoner in upper guk.  <br/>
Personally I am not high enough to go find these myself yet..So have not <br/>
personally seen one but have seen various posts enough to know that they do <br/>
exist..except people don&#39;t know what to do with them. And I am sure this is <br/>
a rare drop because you just don&#39;t see those over the auction channels <br/>
everyday..;)<br/>
