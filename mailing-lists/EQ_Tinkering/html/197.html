get them, they kept telling me to come back in two weeks.<br/>

&gt;While I agree that Verant is sick & twisted, you are confusing two <br/>
&gt;quests.  The Evil<br/>
&gt;Eye is part of the Observer Staff Quest and originates at an Observitory.  The<br/>
&gt;Telescope Lens Quest orignates in the Wizards? Guild and it requires you <br/>
&gt;to get four<br/>
&gt;lenses.  None of them are on Borxx.  Two are given to you by the <br/>
&gt;observitories.  One<br/>
&gt;is obtained by killing a 14ish (and nasty) DE in Freeport, and the last is <br/>
&gt;on this<br/>
&gt;missing gnome.  Please also note that this quest will not be given to <br/>
&gt;wizards above<br/>
&gt;level 12. </span></blockquote></div>
