<div id="ygrps-yiv-396296799">Hey hey! So now we&#39;ve come up with a verb based off of me? Thanks! Tch!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, well seriously. Like I said, I talked t othe TRUSTABLE GM and, well. I <br/>
told you what he said, so it looks like until then all we can do is wait. On <br/>
a side note, according to Zamtil (probably one of the richest darn people in <br/>
the game) when I talked to him, he had gotten his tinkering skill to 107, <br/>
and it seems there is NOTHING to tinker that will currently raise it beyond <br/>
that, so thats the max skill we can get to for now. Wait, I belive that we <br/>
will in the end be rewarded with this skill....I can feel it.<br/>

&gt;trolling<br/>
&gt;location? Must be becasue its so hard to verify..<br/>
&gt;So far, down on the ocean floor we have (gathered from many messageboards)<br/>
&gt;      -  The tinkering book<br/>
&gt;      -  The best shadowknight unholy sword<br/>
&gt;      -  A 50ac breastplate<br/>
&gt;      - Pottery sketches required to make weapon molds..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It must be getting pretty crowded down there with all these super items :).<br/>
&gt;Seriously though, the guy that came up with the &quot;search beneath the waves&quot; <br/>
&gt;tip<br/>
&gt;has subsequently apologised and retracted, saying that he was misled.<br/>
