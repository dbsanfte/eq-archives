<div id="ygrps-yiv-614728653">If only we could all make lvl 1s and go to PoF to see Cazic! it would be like <br/>
bixie vs. sand giant! it would be cool to have a plain old gnomey party, <br/>
gnomes taking out Meldrath, the nercomancer guild, the hero, Feddi the mad, <br/>
and every thing else in between! how about a pie eating contest too? get a <br/>
gnome baker and see which gnome can eat the most in 10 minutes? HURRAY FOR <br/>
GNOMES! I like the multi server idea, changing every month or so. how about a <br/>
Oasis take-over for one server? this would be real cool. In the words of <br/>
Tinik, there&#39;s no place like gnome!</div>
