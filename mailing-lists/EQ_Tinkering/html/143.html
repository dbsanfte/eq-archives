<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765726048">Actually Skewers can be made with pottery. So you would just have to master<br/>
pottery. I do agree though that Verant needs to do something about it&#39;s economy.<br/>
It really hurts when the 1 basic item that tinker&#39;s can make costs 3PP to make,<br/>
but can be bought for 2PP!<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Do tinkered cams work yet?<br/>

&gt; It is outrageous that you can not produce an item for less than what it<br/>
&gt; sells.  How do they expect people to make money at trades?  With static<br/>
&gt; orbs costing about 1 pp, there is no way to make a reasonable profit given<br/>
&gt; that you must also buy pie tins and skewers.  Yes, you can try to make the<br/>
&gt; pie tins and skewers but how many people are masters at pottery,<br/>
&gt; blacksmithing, and tinkering?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, rest assured, I will be sending /feedback to them on this subject.  I<br/>
&gt; bet the next thing I will hear is that store bought cams are cheaper than<br/>
&gt; tinkered cams.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Greetings Fellow Gnomes<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am glad to hear that you are selling compasses at all. In many towns I<br/>
&gt; &gt;have come to there seems to be a merchant who will sell them. The merchant<br/>
&gt; &gt;is not used often from what I can tell because they are always stuck in a<br/>
&gt; &gt;back corner. There is a merchant one in qeynos by the docks. if you walk out<br/>
&gt; &gt;of Fishes ale and go to the docks you will see a tall building on your right<br/>
&gt; &gt;and a merchant sitting in the middle of a counter that goes in a circle<br/>
&gt; &gt;around him.. He sells compasses for 2pp and it seems to cost us 3pp to make.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyone else see a problem with this? I for one think that the vendors should<br/>
&gt; &gt;be selling there compasses for around 7pp. That gives us some nice room to<br/>
&gt; &gt;work. I have also seen compasses for sale in the High Elf City and Halas<br/>
&gt; &gt;(all<br/>
&gt; &gt;for 2pp).<br/>
