<b>Subject:</b> Kizdean Gix and the Eldritch Collective <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-576395209">Does anyone know the relationship between Kizdean Gix and the Eldritch <br/>
Collective.  He&#39;s an inkie that spawns behind Inn 1 in West Commons.  When <br/>
you kill him, you get faction adjustment for the Eldritch Collective and he <br/>
drops Noresa&#39;s purse.  I went around the Library of Mechamagica and asked <br/>
&#39;who is Kizdean&#39;, &#39;who is Kizdean Gix&#39;, and &#39;who is Noresa&#39; and got no <br/>
responses... Anyone have any clue why killing Kizdean gives you a faction <br/>
adjustment with the Eldritch Collective... Also, what is everyones faction <br/>
with them.. I have been trying to improve it but still stuck at Amiable.<br/>
