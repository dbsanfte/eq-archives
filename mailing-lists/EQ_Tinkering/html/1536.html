<b>Subject:</b> RE: Diamond Dust possible location... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993557573">This is part of a quest that&#39;s been around for a while.  The dusters roam<br/>
around Ak&#39;Anon and are often extremely difficult to find (very easy to kill<br/>
though).  Search the archives for &quot;duster&quot;, I&#39;m pretty sure somebody posted<br/>
their approximate spawn points a while back.  Regrettably, nothing to do<br/>
with diamond dust.<br/>

Ok, this may be another wild goose chase, but I poked<br/>
around some in Ak&#39;Anon, and I talked to everyone I<br/>
could find about diamond dust. Only one NPC responded<br/>
to my queries, and it seemed kind of related. He told<br/>
me that I needed to kill &quot;clockwork dusters&quot; and<br/>
return their remains to him since they&#39;re obsolete.<br/>
This NPC is just across the water near the Mines of<br/>
Malfunction. I looked all over for these dusters, but<br/>
couldn&#39;t find any, all I found were scrubbers,<br/>
cleaners, and sweepers. If you happen to come across<br/>
any, let me know how it turns out!</div>
