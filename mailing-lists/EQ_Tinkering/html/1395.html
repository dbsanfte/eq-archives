<div id="ygrps-yiv-232521474">Lungs are not trivial at skill 106. i am impressed someone here made ONLY 10 <br/>
Lungs and raised skill 3 times.  that is quite impressive. with an int of <br/>
195, and after successfully crafting 17 Lungs, and probably failing maybe 15 <br/>
times...i have only raised skill 4 times.<br/>
my thoughts on dismond dust: the key lies in Rathe Mtns...<br/>
Possibilities:<br/>
         1.) Take diamond to Ogre &quot;gem crusher guy&quot; and he crushes           <br/>
       diamond-get dust back.<br/>
         2.) Take diamond to Gnome gem cutter guy, have him cut the          <br/>
       diamond...and get dust back.<br/>
now all i need is a diamond and i&#39;ll give choice #2 a try.<br/>
