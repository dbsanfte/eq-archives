<div id="ygrps-yiv-931355610">Unlike outher trade skills tinkering starts at 50, much better then having to put down traning points in to it. Dont tinker until lv 30 or so, then you will have cash for it and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Start by making Flameless lanterns until itï¿½s trivial, took me about 120 lanterns or so i  think or was it 80 :-) or 180  ? well alot of them anyways.<br/>

&gt; Okay. PLEASE don&#39;t take this as a restart of the WHAT IS THE SKILL CAP <br/>
&gt; argument. But rather a suggestion. I&#39;m a level 20 Gnome Mage and have been <br/>
&gt; actively tinkering for months now.. even before I hit level 16. I was <br/>
&gt; eagerly awaiting the day that I hit 16 and could raise my &quot;tinkering skill&quot; <br/>
&gt; with training. Heck I even saved up 25 points for that sole purpose. Well, <br/>
&gt; I hit level 16 and CAN&#39;T train in the skill. Sooo... I have spent the last <br/>
&gt; 4 levels trying to get SOME kind of skill improvement. And so far to date I <br/>
&gt; have only gotten my Tinkering to raise from 50 to 53. I have spent and <br/>
&gt; BURNED atleast 500 to 600 Platinum Pieces trying to get my skill to <br/>
&gt; improve. I tried everything from Flameless Lanterns to Spyglasses. If I got <br/>
&gt; a success, I tried to sell it for some kind of profit and put that same <br/>
&gt; money right back into tinkering.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, to make a long story short. I have burned WAY too much money and am <br/>
&gt; TIRED of this nonsense. Shamans have Alchemy (which granted can be more <br/>
&gt; expensive even than tinkering), and there was a recent addition for shamans <br/>
&gt; to be able to put training points into Alchemy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WHAT ABOUT TINKERING?!?!?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I say we start a write in campaign of e-mail,  or a petition.. or SOMETHING <br/>
&gt; to let Verant know that we Gnomes are tired of wasting needless amounts of <br/>
&gt; cash to raise a skill that we can not train in... plus making things worse <br/>
&gt; it being the MOST expensive trade skill in EQ. Something needs to be done <br/>
&gt; about this.<br/>
