<div id="ygrps-yiv-14765868">I decided to check out the theory about where does this light lead. I asked <br/>
the same question, and got the same responses. However, I also got the sams <br/>
response when I said, &quot;Where Leader.&quot; Which can only mean that the guide <br/>
system works by picking up word fragments instead of exact words, so it <br/>
percievs Where does this light lead, to, Where Leader, by picking out WHERE do<br/>
es this light LEAD. Jus though I&#39;d share my revelation and be of some help.</div>
