<div id="ygrps-yiv-197299969">Ok ok, what happened to tinkering? :)<br/>
<br/>
Get to work on yer diamond dust instead of discussing the race of the king <br/>
of gnomes!<br/>
<br/>
Bought dufrenite, crushed it, but havent had enuff money since to buy the <br/>
rest of the reagents of the gemcutter, sad news is that it wont be much <br/>
cheaper than the aqualung, different in price is like 50p or so, but maybe <br/>
the gemcutter will be easier to sell, if it makes successrate on JC go up, <br/>
it should be :)<br/>
<br/>
sidenote: cost of getting tinkering to 108 skill has cost me over 15kp now <br/>
(might be all the way up at 20, yuck), but that should be a bit my own <br/>
fault, havent really sold my successes to players, but to vendors to get a <br/>
few extra tries :) Also have a really sucky cha, 85 with equipment only, <br/>
hehe<br/>
