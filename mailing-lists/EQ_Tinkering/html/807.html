I want a flying machine where i can pass over mobs and drop gnomish bombs and <br/>
use my gnomish gun to POW em!<br/>
Hold onto this idea fellow gnomes, even if there is no 3rd book, even if <br/>
tinkering now sux and costs a million dollars! One day and 10 patches later <br/>
everyone might want to be a gnome and we will already have maxxed skill and <br/>
be the 1sts to use it! BTW what is the origin of those ss? im interested as <br/>
well, that flying machine was just TITS! And it only seems natural that we <br/>
get to build a flying machine, gnomes in other games get flying machines. <br/>
Still psyched<br/>
