<b>Subject:</b> Re: New to tinkering...best way to raise skill? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-372667445">Yikes! It costs approx. 2pp to make a flameless lantern, and THIS is the <br/>
item used to increase skill??<br/>
How many lanterns does it take to increase 1 point?  This sounds extremely <br/>
expensive to me.<br/>
I eventually want to make Mechanized Lockpicks, but it sounds like this is <br/>
gonna be way too costly.  Any profit in tinkering at all?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help,<br/>

&gt;one of the patches sort of messed with tinkering where you will rarely gain<br/>
&gt;skill points now.  I don&#39;t know if this has been changed.<br/>
