<b>Subject:</b> On Tinkering books <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978769000">Well I bought my tool kit and the two books from the tinkering vendor<br/>
last night.  After reading I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that there must<br/>
be more books somewhere, as these two seem to center on &quot;higher level&quot;<br/>
projects.   Tonight I hope to talk to every NPC in Ak&#39;anon for the<br/>
remainder of the books especially the ones that contain firewater and<br/>
collapsible fishing poles.  I will keep you posted on my results.<br/>
