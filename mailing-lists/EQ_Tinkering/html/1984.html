&gt; well personally I think this is at least worth a<br/>
&gt; try.... maybe for a gnome enchanter. heck actually<br/>
&gt; anyone who can make a gemcutter could test this by<br/>
&gt; themselfs. toss 20 points into Jewel making, and pay<br/>
&gt; someone to make you some enchanted bars of silver<br/>
&gt; &lt;actually you don&#39;t even need to enchant the bars to<br/>
&gt; make stuff... but I would think it would be a MUCH<br/>
&gt; better idea&gt;   then toss everything in a back and see<br/>
&gt; what comes from a catseye neckless with the gemcutter<br/>
&gt; and greese... or catseye gem, silver enchanted bar,<br/>
&gt; gemcutter and greese.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

materials.  If you get the &quot;You lack the skills...&quot; message, then you know<br/>
you&#39;re on the right track.<br/>
