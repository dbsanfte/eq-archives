&gt; Yes, it IS possible. I went to Halas through level 15 through 18, and I<br/>
&gt; learned alot about it. I think there is a high level gnome necromancer<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hey guys,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If the clue was to look below waves, and before it was stated that a<br/>
&gt; &gt;Barbarian Shaman would do the exploring, what about the lake outside of<br/>
&gt; &gt;Halas?  Has that already been brought up?  If need be, I can take my<br/>
&gt; &gt;Magician up there and poke around?<br/>

class or race. When I was in the cave (at level 13 maybe), I was just<br/>
killing a few ice boned skeletons. Someone said he had killed a level 22<br/>
ranger in seconds. Might be tough.<br/>
<br/>
You find the cave by entering the river by a hole in the ice near Megan&#39;s<br/>
tower. Then swim north (left) until you come to the mountains (if you are a<br/>
decent swimmer you will need no artificial breathing). There you will find<br/>
the cave.<br/>
<br/>
I might go there myself. Just rarely play any more...<br/>
