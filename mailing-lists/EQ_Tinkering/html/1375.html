<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250430263">Although this is my first post to this list, ive been reading em everyday for the last few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I too am an aspiring tinkerer (skill 106) and I have successfully made Lungs and Rebreathers alike.<br/>
<br/>
Well tonight, after a week of work, I took my 4000pp and went to make some lungs.  Out of 10 attempts,<br/>
i succeeded on 4 of em.  I then attempted to make 4 Rebreathers... Failure on all four...<br/>
<br/>
Another 4000pp gone and not ONE point of skill advancement.  Int is 182, wis is 100, lvl 50 character.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you have any tips for me, let me know, im very close to just giving the damn skill up, ive got over<br/>
13K pp invested into it and im quite frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

P.S.  Have we just given up on the Diamond dust?  I for one am still looking everywhere that i can and one<br/>
thing&#39;s for sure, Faeries DON&#39;T drop it.  I&#39;ve killed about 1000 faeries, maidens, guards, royal guards and the like. not one diamond dust drop/</div>
