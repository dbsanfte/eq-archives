<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515761902">This is a very active mailing list!<br/>
1st I have ever been on that has a thirst for game solving.<br/>
Update of last night, I spent the night vanquishing gobs in sol A and spoke <br/>
to the gnomes there, err rather lack of speaking, nothing came of it.<br/>
As far as the 3rd book of tinkering, is it a fact that it exists? Sounds like <br/>
an extensive search of akanon has yielded nothing fruitful. I myself have <br/>
swam the depths in the past without finding anything.<br/>
As far as the inner circle goes, there is more then 1 guild that has this <br/>
type of set up. So i am assuming its a guild tagged or no, i would guess <br/>
tagged.<br/>
Its kind of a shame that if people have this information they wont share, its <br/>
not like we dont deserve to have special abilities we are gnomes!!<br/>
