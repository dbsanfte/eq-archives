<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474182257"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Actually, the Observer staff is ANOTHER lens quest, not<br/>
&gt; &gt; the spare lens one. But the DE in Freeport, I&#39;ve never found.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I hear that people have found her, killed her and gotten the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lens. I&#39;m sure I can kill her, but I can&#39;t find her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just happened across her and killed her and got that lens. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t however have any of the other ones and now when I ask<br/>
&gt; about the quest I get a message saying you are too high level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does it say who&#39;s lens it is, or does it just say a telescope lens? You<br/>
might be able to kill her 5 times and get enough lenses to complete the<br/>
quest. I saw her when I went to Freeport. She is in the thieves guild. I<br/>
thought killing her might work, but I was about 5th level at the time.</div>
