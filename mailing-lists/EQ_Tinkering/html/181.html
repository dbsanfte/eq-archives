<div id="ygrps-yiv-803633787">I found a rawhide cloak in kithicor forest in a shop near the west end of<br/>
the zone. I did not have the money to buy one, so I do not know if they were<br/>
sold by a player, or always offered by the merchant. If they were sold by a<br/>
player, then they probably come from the orcs near there.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Which quest gives out the tattered cloak as a reward?  I heard the newbie<br/>
&gt; gnome warrior Red V  provides them sometimes (unfortunately I got rawhide<br/>
&gt; shoulderpads when I did it).  Then I heard of a felwithe quest.  Anyone<br/>
&gt; know for sure? </span></blockquote></div>
