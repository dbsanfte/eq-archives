<div id="ygrps-yiv-705294661">Hello all,<br/>
Long time listener, first time caller :)<br/>
<br/>
Any way, about the formula for the scuba gear, I frankly have no idea. <br/>
However, I can verify that there is no new information in the tinkering <br/>
books.  I went back to Ak&#39;anon and bought both of them again, and nada. <br/>
Also, I looked around Ak&#39;anon and was able to find any new quests.  Being a <br/>
rogue, however, I wasn&#39;t able to really check the caster quests, so <br/>
something might be there.<br/>
<br/>
I do have an idea though.  Since this came in the same patch as Kedge Keep, <br/>
the formula might be in or around there, like the Cauldron.  Not much, but <br/>
all I can think of.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting,<br/>
