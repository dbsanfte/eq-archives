<b>Subject:</b> Killed a clockwork <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-142554643">I was with a couple of friends yesterday who are level 50. They were bored so I suggested going to kill a clockwork spider in Ak&#39;Anon. We all went in and they ended up killing Clockwork XIIC (a spider). It was blue to both of them. Loot that came from the spider was a C series blackbox (Which I believe is part of a warrior quest), and a Silvered Rod which is a lore item. Does anyone know what this silvered rod is for?<br/>
