  IF you have only 16 pp i wouldnt put them in to tinkering. Make levels fast to around lv 30 or so and you will not have problems with money i can easy go out and earn 200 plat  hunting HG&#39;s and such for a night, been doing Giant&#39;s since lv 28.<br/>

  The olny thing i have made any money on at all of the things i can tinker is the Spyglass and if you have only 16 pp you wont even make one.<br/>

    Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
    I started an attempt to tinker before the patch, but gave up after I surfed the internet and heard that tinkering did not pay off and was very expensive.  <br/>
     <br/>
    I have been playing EQ for about 3 or 4 months now and so far all my pp has gone towards spells.  In fact, my 18 level gnome wizard has a total of 16pp to her name.  With that in mind, what kind of advise can you give me?  Is tinkering worth spending my hard earned pp on that I have been saving for my 20 level spells?  With the new patch, I have high hopes of finally making some pp.<br/>
<br/>
    Also, I have going to ask a dumb question.  What is a gem chopper?<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks </span></blockquote></div>
