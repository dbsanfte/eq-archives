<b>Subject:</b> Re: More &#39;theory&#39; on the collapsable fishing pole... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472793255">Actually, we may be totally off. Look at other tinkering items the <br/>
mechanical lock picks take rat ears, the spy glass takes a fishing pole, <br/>
Firewater is gnomish spirits and water! Those are some pretty weird <br/>
components! Who knows, maybe the fishing pole takes a raw bamboo pole, then <br/>
a dagger (to cut it), then a sprinket (Who knows why.) then gears (for the <br/>
reel?), and some bolts (to connect it all).<br/>
Hey...that might just work...got to go try it out now, bye!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;For those of us hot on the trail of the ever elusive collapsable fishing <br/>
&gt;pole, here is a compilation of ideas from myself and others that might aid <br/>
&gt;a few folks with the cash to try different combinations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the subject of which components are the most promising, I would start <br/>
&gt;with excluding the reflective shard and the spriket. Next after those the  <br/>
&gt;least likely candidates are the gnomish bolts, the metal twine, the bamboo <br/>
&gt;pole, and the cork. Although there could be an argument made that a &#39;cork&#39; <br/>
&gt;could be used.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, that leaves us the following 7 components to work with<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fishing Pole<br/>
&gt;metal rod<br/>
&gt;grease<br/>
&gt;metal shaft<br/>
&gt;gears<br/>
&gt;sprockets<br/>
&gt;Cloth Cord (from a tailor I assume, I have never used this in a <br/>
&gt;combination)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This significantly narrows the field, and I would highly recommend that we <br/>
&gt;exhaust all combinations of these items before moving on to others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mostly likely the recipe has from 3 to 5 components. Some have made an <br/>
&gt;argument that since the original tinker tool box had only 4 spaces, that <br/>
&gt;the recipe has 3 or 4 components. This may be true but hey, Verant screwed <br/>
&gt;up on the compass, why not the pole? =|<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We should exhaust all combinations of 4 and 5 components before moving on <br/>
&gt;to recipes with 6 or more components.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is highly likely that the recipe contains more than 1 metal shaft or <br/>
&gt;metal rod, perhaps as many as 3. While combinations using 2 and 3 <br/>
&gt;rods/shafts WITH the fishing pole have almost been exhausted (check the <br/>
&gt;&#39;pole database&#39;), I have noticed we still have quite a few combinations <br/>
&gt;left to try that EXCLUDE a regular fishing pole, but INCLUDE 2/3 rods or <br/>
&gt;shafts. There are very few of the &#39;double shaft&#39; and &#39;triple shaft&#39; <br/>
&gt;combinations that exclude the fishing pole yet to be tried.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Having exhausted all of these, then the most likely possibilities are that <br/>
&gt;there is some component somewhere that we are missing, perhaps there is a <br/>
&gt;tinkered item like a &#39;reel&#39; that we need to make first before combining it <br/>
&gt;to make the fishing pole, or Verant has once again screwed the tinkers of <br/>
&gt;the world... =|<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While I tend to lean toward the latter, the possibility of having to <br/>
&gt;&#39;pre-tinker&#39; a reel for the rod sounds intriguing...  blah...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anywho, thats my 500 plat on the matter or so (I have spent a hell of a lot <br/>
&gt;more than 2 cents).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
