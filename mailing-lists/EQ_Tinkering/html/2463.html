<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307619802">Hello.<br/>
 <br/>
I am a student at Queen&#39;s University in Canada who is taking part in <br/>
a research project that is studying Everquest.  After spending <br/>
numerous hours (or perhaps months would be a better way to put it!) <br/>
playing the game we have put together a brief survey, which should <br/>
take no more than ten minutes to complete.  We are trying to get a <br/>
better understanding of the relationships which develop in the vast <br/>
land of Norrath.  If you are interested in participating merely cut <br/>
and paste the questions below and e-mail your replies to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:7jss1@...">7jss1@...</a> Any comments or questions would be welcome and <br/>
appreciated.  The survey can also be found at <br/>
