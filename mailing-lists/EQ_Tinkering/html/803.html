<b>Subject:</b> Re: Third book.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905896183">I have been researching and listening to all the jabber about the third <br/>
book..and have heard just about every roumor there is known to gnome. Heard a <br/>
rumor under waves...That could be any body of water..(Taalk about the <br/>
proverbial Needle in the haystack...Sheesh!!)..I also Heard  that as simple <br/>
to get for a level 1 barbarian can do.....Hmmm ...Halas??? Well if you are a <br/>
New player in Halas with a barbarian whats the places you would explore to <br/>
have fun without getting killed too easy........The lake in front is one area <br/>
that has water....How about the bottom of the well there??...Has anyone <br/>
really sayed long enough in it to exlpore it extensively?? And  Barbarians <br/>
wouldnt see much in the well cause they have poor vision and once established <br/>
not going anywere it would be abandoned in looking into? Just a <br/>
thought...there is quite a few little areas in the game that have simple <br/>
small areas of water that could be overlooked because they seem be part of <br/>
the eye candy of the scenery.....Like a fountain of blood in Crushbone  or <br/>
several areas of water in CB<br/>
that seem to lead nowhere....Or just Consider this ...that the tinkering is <br/>
screwed up till they patch it to make it better.....I for one have had it in <br/>
scowering searches for this book.....So...unless i come across it by accident <br/>
or given the info ....I will have no more concern for tinkering except the <br/>
casual cam or compass to make for friend....Sincerely,   Cloverleaf &lt;Fennin <br/>
