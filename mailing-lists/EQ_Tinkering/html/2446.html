<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156779652">You haven&#39;t reached the hard part.  I spent about that to get to 103.  It <br/>
was the journey to 120 that cost me 10&#39;s of thousands of plats.. before <br/>
they released the recipe for powered gloves and catapults.  Mind you, this <br/>
recipe IS NOT IN THE GAME, you can only find it by reading the strategy <br/>
guide.  This is the most offensive part of the whole ordeal.<br/>
