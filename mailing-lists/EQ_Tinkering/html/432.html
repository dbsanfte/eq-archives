<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702822470">To raise skill:<br/>
<br/>
-Be level 16 or higher<br/>
<br/>
-&#39;Try&#39; to train it at your guildhall - perhaps even though it says you<br/>
can&#39;t train it (you must learn advanced skills in this field...), it does<br/>
record that you did meet the requirements to get it (level 16) <br/>
<br/>
-Spend A LOT of platinum!  To give you an idea, Vaprak spent about 3500pp<br/>
to become a tinkering master (101 skill)  At the pace I&#39;m at I&#39;ll probably<br/>
be spending about the same amount, maybe a bit less since I was able to<br/>
profit on the cams by selling them to fletchers.<br/>

&gt;According to Luke&#39;s site, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering,">http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering,</a> you can not<br/>
&gt;gain tinkering skill until 16th Level.  Perhaps that&#39;s the problem.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt;also why I haven&#39;t started tinkering: only learning.<br/>
