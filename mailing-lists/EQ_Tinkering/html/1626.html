Yesterday, I was running around in lesser fay, when I suddenly got homesick<br/>
and ran to Ak&#39;Anon to meet my family and say hello to old friends.<br/>
After much kissing and rejoice, and comments like - Look how big your nose<br/>
have become, I thought that I should give tinkering a try, now that I had<br/>
turned 26 and could tinker away up to 55.<br/>
So I ran to the bartender and bought 40 bottles of gnomish spirits, he<br/>
peered at me and probably wondered what I was going to do with all that<br/>
liqour, but anyway, on to the mills I went, hopping along the same path as I<br/>
used to several years ago.<br/>
On the way there I bought a lot of lanterns, for some serious tinkering.<br/>
So to the mill I went, and I started making flameless lanterns.<br/>
<br/>
I was making very good progress, almost 1 Skill point for every 4 lanterns<br/>
made, and I soon hit 55. Well, I thought I might as well do these remaining<br/>
that I had bought components for, so I clicked combine, and imagine my<br/>
surprise when it said I had gained skill 56...<br/>
According to the formula mentioned before [(lvl - 15)*5] I could only tinker<br/>
to 55...<br/>
Anyway, as a happy little gnome I rushed to the bank to recover all my<br/>
savings so that I could tinker more things, and when I ran out of funds I<br/>
had hit 69 in skill.<br/>
<br/>
Just sold all the cams I made, and will hopefully be off tinkering again<br/>
tonight...<br/>

&gt;   As far as skill cap goes, I&#39;ll just let you all know that it USED to be<br/>
&gt; capped at (level - 15) * 5. But Verant has recently either removed the<br/>
skill<br/>
&gt; cap or changed it. </span></blockquote></div>
