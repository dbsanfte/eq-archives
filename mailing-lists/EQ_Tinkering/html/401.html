The Bridge: In Queynos there is a guy named Hansl Bigroon.  If you talk to him<br/>
he<br/>
will talk about making a bridge to Odus.  He needs a list of engineers<br/>
delivered to Antonius<br/>
Bayles&#39; messenger.  He refused to give me the list to someone who conned<br/>
indifferent, so I<br/>
don&#39;t know if a friendlier face will get it.  I have been told that if you<br/>
keep asking him about<br/>
the engineers (the text is not bracketed) he will drop the note, which lists<br/>
the names of the<br/>
three engineers.  The human engineer is located in the arcane science building<br/>
in Freeport,<br/>
but I don&#39;t know what you need to do to get him to respond (giving him the<br/>
note doesn&#39;t work).<br/>
But if you talk to Rucio Divella in the office of the people he says that<br/>
Hansl Bigroon is the<br/>
office manager.  If asked who are the other engineers he says he saw them<br/>
once, one human,<br/>
one dwarf and one gnome.  The gnome he said was followed around by some sort<br/>
of automation<br/>
(perhaps the one in Steamfont?).  I am not sure where to go from there, but it<br/>
sounds<br/>
intriguing.</div>
