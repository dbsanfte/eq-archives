It was not fixed in the last patch.  On Monday, I hit 100 in tinkering, then tried 50 attempts on stalking probes without a single increase.  Prior to this, the worst number of attempts I ever<br/>
had for a point increase was 22 (INT 164).  Once I hit 50, I decided to /petition a guide to see if the cap had been lifted.  The response I received was that tinkering wasn&#39;t touched in the last<br/>
patch *sighs*.  So, now I&#39;m trying to powerlevel through 35 so that I can do aqualungs.<br/>

I just read that the patch that was supposed to be this morning was actually<br/>
already done.  They did it when the servers were down with that Cerfnet and<br/>
UUnet trouble.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has tried the tinkering<br/>
skill since the patch to see if the skill cap (I think it was (Level - 15) x<br/>
5) has been fixed yet.  I had been hoping that they would fix it in this<br/>
patch after someone reported that a GM said they should be fixing it soon,<br/>
maybe even in the next patch.  If anyone knows if you can Tinker outside the<br/>
level cap now please say so =)<br/>
