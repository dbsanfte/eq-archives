<div id="ygrps-yiv-83012575">To andy smith who so uttered the reply that it would make it unbalanced to <br/>
have an enchanter share illusions....I say that yer full of crock when it <br/>
comes to the druid spell share wolf form sould be at least the one thing they <br/>
could duplicate to share since the shareing thing is in the system .As with <br/>
the others maybe werewolf should be too sice it dont really cover your <br/>
faction.   I  have seen a person in freeport bank with the illusion on and no <br/>
one bothering him.....However i would be very upset if once i obtained the <br/>
spirit wolf illusion on enchanter and find out that it has not the same <br/>
effect as share wolf form with the faction issue alone...In unrest the undead <br/>
did not touch me while i under shared wolf ....I hope the same is true for <br/>
the enchanter based spell.  As for tinkering ....looks like on the backburner <br/>
till it gets easier ...Or i get alot richer......Sincerly Cloverleaf &lt;Fennin <br/>
