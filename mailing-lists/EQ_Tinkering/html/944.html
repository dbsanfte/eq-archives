<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163210526">Another quick note. . .<br/>
<br/>
I have actually seen the fireworks going off!! In Kelethin on the new server<br/>
on the second night. . . . actually fireworks in the sky. . .couldn&#39;t<br/>
believe it. . now based that the highest level at this time was only bout<br/>
8ish. . must have been a GM. . there was one online. . and that was the<br/>
busiest zone . . . I did shout out to see who was making them but got no<br/>
response.<br/>
<br/>
However it does provide me with that glimmer that they are out there just<br/>
waiting to be found. . if you haven&#39;t seen them go off. . its green/blueish<br/>
trails going up. . which explode in the big firework white fashion. . jsut<br/>
thought. . . DAMN shoulda taken a screenie =(<br/>

&gt; None of what I mention here are facts so don&#39;t take them as facts. I am<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; going from what little I now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     While I was riding on the boat to fp i decided to bring some reading<br/>
&gt; along. (EX: tinkering books). While reading it over I was thinking if any<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; these things could be hints on how to make some other stuff or find the<br/>
&gt; missing book. Well here are some suggestions to check into. Talk to King<br/>
&gt; Akannon about it. In the book it mentions at the begging he is writing it<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; him or something along those lines. His wife might be in the game (not<br/>
sure).<br/>
&gt; He mentions her in the books as compassvess or something close to that. He<br/>
&gt; named the compass after her. Maybe she has something about it. Talk to the<br/>
&gt; zookeeper cause he was the one that practically sent them to the mino<br/>
caves<br/>
&gt; to get a minotaur for the zoo. Try killing the minotaur in the zoo. He<br/>
might<br/>
&gt; somehow have the book. Thats all I could think of about this. If anyone<br/>
else<br/>
&gt; has some ideas send them in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also I was thinking of some gnomish firework recipes. Maybe we have to add<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; stalking probe and a flask of water and maybe some other item to make the<br/>
&gt; fireworks. It mentions in one of the books that he was worried about the<br/>
&gt; scouts exploding when the were doing something and he mentions a something<br/>
&gt; about a flask of water with it. Maybe add a metal rod or that cheaper rod<br/>
&gt; thing for the stalking probe to shoot out of when it comes in contact with<br/>
&gt; the water. shoots in the air and explodes. I dunno don&#39;t take these<br/>
litteraly<br/>
&gt; and rely on them alot. There just some guesses i thought of.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
