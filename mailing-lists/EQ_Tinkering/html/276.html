<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707735744">This is what we&#39;ve been waiting for! People, we must renew efforts! We must <br/>
try harder to discory the methods used to make these items. I myself would <br/>
except: A I&#39;m not level 16. B I&#39;m almost always broke now, anyway. But when <br/>
I get more money I&#39;ll start working on it.<br/>
Now we know that there are more items. Just keep trying....or maybe we could <br/>
just bribe that guy....hmmm....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I have good news and bad news.  The good news is the Telescope Lens <br/>
&gt;and Collapsable Fishing Pole CAN be made.  And, you DO have to use a <br/>
&gt;collapsable fishing pole to make the telescope.  Both of these items are <br/>
&gt;makeable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now for the bad news.  The only person I know that can make them WILL NOT <br/>
&gt;share the recipe!  Can you believe that?  He is a gnome on Xegony by the <br/>
&gt;name of Salvadori, so if you can pry the recipe from him, good luck.  I <br/>
&gt;tried.  Well, also, he said that Tinkering skill improvement had been <br/>
&gt;fixed, and he was up in the 60&#39;s on skill.  So keep tinkering.<br/>
