<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947386363">Some Tips:<br/>
I made a couple of rebreathers at skill 111, costed me 25,000 pp to make 5<br/>
of them and 4 aqualungs where left<br/>
<br/>
What I did is I made a High Elf pumpled CHA into him, twinked him a bit he<br/>
had 198 CHA anyways I could buy all the stuff for aqualungs for about 200<br/>
pp , and total cost for rebreather works to about 1000 pp / try . costed<br/>
about 5000 pp each.<br/>
<br/>
so 1 / 5 tries it actualy worked on the avarage, also have the tinkering<br/>
books in your GENERAL INVENTORY, aqualungs are actualy 1 /2 tried with the<br/>
books about 1 / 3 without the books<br/>
<br/>
anyways you get your main guy stand by the mule and the mule buys ( takes 2<br/>
accounts tho ).<br/>
<br/>
anyways it works out great like that. But now the problem is selling those<br/>
rebreathers on our server most people won&#39;t buy them for over 2 KPP, and I<br/>
dont really like loosing 3,000 pp.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways the point of this thread is just to give tips, and I think if you<br/>
guys also have some tips it would help a lot, on how to maybe reduce the<br/>
cost or somthing like that etc.,<br/>
<br/>
But we need to help each other<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ALSO: maybe we should ALL do a /feedback and ask them to give more useble<br/>
stuff to tinkering, also maybe we can start a big post on the Offical<br/>
Massage board, I think we should fight for our skill, I mean look at<br/>
Shamans they got Alchamy working , and it is a great class-only skill, why<br/>
don&#39;t we make Verant get off their ass and make them do somthing about<br/>
tinkering.<br/>
<br/>
like also tell us if that Diamond Dust actualy exist, like we been<br/>
searching for it for what 2 month now ?!<br/>
