<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184838447">Because of my obvious genius, I was able to find more out about the <br/>
collapsible fishing pole than ALL OF YOU put together, and not only do I <br/>
think that I&#39;m on the verge of discovering the secret of the fishing pole, <br/>
but I think I&#39;m on the verge of discovering the lost tinkering book! Hahaha! <br/>
I know something none of you know, but I&#39;m not going to tell. I will not <br/>
dishonor my self or others, so sorry. I just wanted you guys to know tat I <br/>
know something, and could very well soon find out the secret, but like I <br/>
said, I won&#39;t tell.</div>
