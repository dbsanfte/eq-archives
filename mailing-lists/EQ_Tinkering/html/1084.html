<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971393944">I&#39;m all for Gnomestock! There are a few things we need before we have it. We need someone to be in charge of setting up a date, place, and server. I suggest that we vote on someone on this list to become the Gnomestock coordinator. Another thing we will need is for the people who are already on that server to be willing to donate some cash for booze. After all, the rest of the people will only be level 1&#39;s since it&#39;s not the server that they usually play on, and therefore they will have no money.</div>
