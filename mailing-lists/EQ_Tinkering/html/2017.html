<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404040796">Somewhere in the last several patches, something must have changed<br/>
with success ratios for tinkering.  My skill is currently 118, in my<br/>
last 16 lung attempts, I&#39;ve succeeded only 4 times.  These attempts<br/>
were done over a period of a month or so.  I only recently decided to<br/>
try tinkering again, thinking that my prior experience was just a<br/>
bad-luck streak.<br/>
<br/>
My 2nd to last batch of lungs cost me 800p per lung.  My most recent<br/>
batch cost me 1000p per lung.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else noticed or experienced this?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a change was made to weigh wisdom more heavily in the formula?<br/>
<br/>
I blew 1750p last night, and walked away with ONE lung.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m about ready to write off tinkering as a skill only practiced by<br/>
the insane.  I&#39;d love to make lungs and provide them to my party<br/>
members for kedge hunting - but at these prices, it&#39;s just insanity.<br/>
