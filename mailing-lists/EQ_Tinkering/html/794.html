<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I got booted from my server Veeshan 10 min ago so i joind the chat to try and talk to an GM or something and i talked to one called Viik, and asked why is the tinkering screwed and itï¿½s so damn hard to raise the skill and he told me that is becouse the tinkering skill are so cool. Well me response was how is it cool we cant make anything not even an collapsable fishing pole who shouldnt be that hard to make or find the recipe for. He then told me that  the recipe for the collapsable fishing pole are in the windmills and that he hade done ALL the items last night on the test server. So i asked if it was on the test server only, and he said no on ALL the servers. I then asked what about gnomish fireworks can that be made to ? and he said yes it can be done.<br/>
