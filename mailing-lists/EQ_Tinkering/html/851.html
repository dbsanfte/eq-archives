<div id="ygrps-yiv-172393843">Honestly people, you think that we&#39;d have to kill an extremely high level <br/>
NPC to get a tinkering book? No! And especially not on that is GOOD, and of <br/>
our own race! Thinking that it would be on someone like that is totally <br/>
rediculous and unlogical and insane even! Verant would honestly NEVER do <br/>
something like THAT, so you need to foregt it and start looking for more <br/>
logical answers. Gimblestan was the helper of the king, right? Maybe we need <br/>
to ask the king &quot;Did you know Gimblestan?&quot; Or something like that. There HAS <br/>
to be some kind of information somewhere about it, I think Verant meant <br/>
tinkering to be a lore related skill, so they wouldn&#39;t just A: shove the <br/>
book on some GOOD high level NPC, or B: put in in some weird place with no <br/>
kind of information pointing to it anywhere!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Actually on the thought that someone said the gm claimed all the <br/>
&gt;information<br/>
&gt;was at the mills, I coaxed a lvl 49 druid to take out all of the npc&#39;s at <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;mills even the merchents for me as I healed him with my druid 8)  they were<br/>
&gt;very tough and we had to zone once as things went awry and we were both<br/>
&gt;attacked by the guard there, they dropped nothing... nothing at all.... I<br/>
&gt;cried that night... hard thinking I might have our answer and then come up<br/>
&gt;empty.  However, I have never seen Feddie Dooger and dont know about <br/>
&gt;him.....<br/>
&gt;  charlotte was tough but not as tough as the npc with the elemental pet... <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt;was nasty .... just so we can rule out a drop,  unless it is a rare drop.<br/>
&gt;That my friends would suk. </span></blockquote></div>
