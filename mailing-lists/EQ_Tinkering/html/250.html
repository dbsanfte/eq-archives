<div id="ygrps-yiv-356758875">Look. That is the best news I&#39;ve heard in awhile on this mailing list, but I <br/>
think that Verant has been forggeting something.<br/>
They are about to patch the test server for the third! time in a row.<br/>
Alas they have not even patched the real game with the &quot;warrior patch&quot;<br/>
as it&#39;s called, which is the patch with the warrior improvements that they <br/>
patched onto the test server when they implemented the RW server codes into <br/>
the Test server. It just seems fishy that they only care about patching the <br/>
test server now, doesn&#39;t it to you?<br/>
