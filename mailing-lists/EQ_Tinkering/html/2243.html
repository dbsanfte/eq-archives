<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177536991">It was with great trepidation that I was summoned into the presence of King<br/>
Ak&#39;Anon. What could he want with me? Was he angry about that spider trap I<br/>
had been experimenting with? No, that couldn&#39;t be it. The damage has been<br/>
cleaned up, and my assistant&#39;s wounds are healing nicely. Was it the<br/>
exploding fishing bait I was testing in the lake? Maybe. The waves it<br/>
generated did inundate parts of the city, but only temporarily, and they did<br/>
wash away a bit of grime. Perhaps I should use a smaller amount of<br/>
Firewater...<br/>
<br/>
As I was escorted into the throne room, I spied a Human! I was about to grab<br/>
the nearest guard and have the intruder booted from the room, when he spoke.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pasketti! I have summoned you here because I believe you may be able to<br/>
help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What? Our king is a Human? Ah, yes! He must be an Enchanter like myself, and<br/>
cloaking himself in Human guise for amusement. That must be it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How may I help, Sire?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It seems that many throughout the land are having problems editing their<br/>
INI files to correctly set text colors.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sire? I don&#39;t understand. It&#39;s simplicity itself. Set User_15_Red to 0,<br/>
User_15_Green to 0, and User_15_Blue to 128 to make your skill messages come<br/>
out in a pleasing dark blue color.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, yes, to us it is. But to those that haven&#39;t been blessed with keen<br/>
Gnomish minds adept at tinkering, it can be confusing. Therefore I task you,<br/>
Pasketti! Create a way to allow everyone to configure their text colors!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, Sire! I&#39;ll get right on it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I returned to my workshop posthaste, and have crafted this program. It&#39;s so<br/>
simple even an Ogre can use it.<br/>
