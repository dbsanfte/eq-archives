lanterns and I got some points from cams as well.  The item-return patch<br/>
KILLED the improvement rate drastically, also you still don&#39;t get items<br/>
back on failure.  BTW if you see your skill as &#39;Average&#39; in the skills list<br/>
that means you gained a point or more somewhere in your tinkering.<br/>

(translation: tailors can&#39;t make them) but the &#39;rare&#39; patchwork pieces are<br/>
sometimes given as rewards for low level warrior quests.  I have yet to<br/>
come across a SMALL size tattered cape, though.<br/>
