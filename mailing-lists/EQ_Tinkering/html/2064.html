<div id="ygrps-yiv-890289973">about the gaurd killing topic from a few days ago i think it rocks! I <br/>
remember when I first came to fennin, before only being on rallos and vallon, <br/>
and coming to corpses of gaurds with lots of 1-4 pp items on them. In an hour <br/>
i had more than 100pp. Whenever i&#39;m low on cash i just go bak to sf and load <br/>
up. As for newboes getting killed the garud killers usually helpem.<br/>
