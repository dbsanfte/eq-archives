<div id="ygrps-yiv-915682902">You are very wrong! That quest DID NOT always work!!! I did that quest with <br/>
my level 6 monk on tunare and got an ogre head. It ws when the quest was <br/>
still easy to do and not fully implimented. I don&#39;t know where you get this <br/>
about it always being in the game, because you are dead wrong, I know that <br/>
first hand to.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; Minor Correction here.  The Glowing Stien was NOT part of the game until <br/>
&gt;less than<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 week before the spoiler went up.  It was the reward for the Brewers <br/>
&gt;Compendium<br/>
&gt; &gt; Quest.  The quest, until recently, was broken.  It returned Pungala&#39;s <br/>
&gt;head (Ogre<br/>
&gt; &gt; Head), not the compendium.  Many bartender&#39;s have tried this quest, and <br/>
&gt;it was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bartender who first completed it.   On a side note,  GM&#39;s informed <br/>
&gt;several players<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the quest indeed worked, before the patch.  They then came back and <br/>
&gt;said it<br/>
&gt; &gt; will be fixed in an up coming patch (Another Lie)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No the quest always worked, the problem was that no one had used all the <br/>
&gt;proper spells<br/>
&gt;on the Ogre to raise the faction high enough.  That is why an enchanter was <br/>
&gt;required<br/>
&gt;to do the quest, which was the part that the general population of norrath <br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;figure out until a week before the last patch.<br/>
