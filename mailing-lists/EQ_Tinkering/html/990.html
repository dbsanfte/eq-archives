<div id="ygrps-yiv-618017745">Last night I got into the game and made up a whole slew of<br/>
the fishing poles.  It&#39;s a pity that they are trivial, but made em anyway.<br/>
Made a set of the fireworks and was kinda disappointed in their graphic.<br/>
I&#39;m sure that they&#39;ll patch em now that we know how to make them.  Anywho, I<br/>
teleported back to South Karana&#39;s and began to auction my wares.  I&#39;ve<br/>
always charged 5X whatever something sells back to the vendors.  I tried<br/>
selling my pole back to a vendor &lt;who was apprehensive to me&gt; and he would<br/>
give me 4 plat for it.  So I charged 20plat.   Think it costs roughly 5-6<br/>
plat to make depending on your faction.  And take in consideration of<br/>
failures and 20pp seems fair to me, especially considering the travel<br/>
involved.  Shall we be agreed on what to charge for this?<br/>
<br/>
		Also, one character came up to me and demanded the recipe.<br/>
Bah on him.  Another came up begging.  So I played the guessing game with<br/>
him till he got it right. :-)  I will willingly share, but some people are<br/>
awfully demanding.   Just so nice to finally be able to make something.</div>
