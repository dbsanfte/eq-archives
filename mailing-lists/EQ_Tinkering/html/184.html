<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741710096">So do you have one or know someone who has one? Could you take a screen shot<br/>
with items in the pack and nothing else on. Have the inventory screen on to<br/>
show that you are at 0 weight. I know a monk that would love this item.<br/>

&gt; reduction.  It can be bought with max Charisma for about 6000 plat. </span></blockquote></div>
