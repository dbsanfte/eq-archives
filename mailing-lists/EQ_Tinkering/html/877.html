<div id="ygrps-yiv-900411688">Anyone else notice that the Ocean of Tears seems to be the standard trolling<br/>
location? Must be becasue its so hard to verify..<br/>
So far, down on the ocean floor we have (gathered from many messageboards)<br/>
     -  The tinkering book<br/>
     -  The best shadowknight unholy sword<br/>
     -  A 50ac breastplate<br/>
     - Pottery sketches required to make weapon molds..<br/>
<br/>
It must be getting pretty crowded down there with all these super items :).<br/>
Seriously though, the guy that came up with the &quot;search beneath the waves&quot; tip<br/>
has subsequently apologised and retracted, saying that he was misled.<br/>
