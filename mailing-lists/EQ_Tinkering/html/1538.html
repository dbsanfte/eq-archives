<div id="ygrps-yiv-69794745"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ok, this may be another wild goose chase, but I poked<br/>
&gt;around some in Ak&#39;Anon, and I talked to everyone I<br/>
&gt;could find about diamond dust. Only one NPC responded<br/>
&gt;to my queries, and it seemed kind of related. He told<br/>
&gt;me that I needed to kill &quot;clockwork dusters&quot; and<br/>
&gt;return their remains to him since they&#39;re obsolete.<br/>
&gt;This NPC is just across the water near the Mines of<br/>
&gt;Malfunction. I looked all over for these dusters, but<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t find any, all I found were scrubbers,<br/>
&gt;cleaners, and sweepers. If you happen to come across<br/>
&gt;any, let me know how it turns out!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the quests you can get from the warrior guild is to turn in key cards <br/>
to certain clockworks and get black boxes in return.  You turn in the <br/>
blackboxes for a blackbox that gets sent to Joogl somethingorother at the <br/>
windmills (the master of Charlotte).  He can give you one of 2 reports to <br/>
give back to the warrior guy.  One results in the Duster Quest.  As far as I <br/>
can tell, the dusters referred to, Duster X and Duster V, only appear once <br/>
you turn in the report.  You then take those pieces to that guy across from <br/>
the Mines of Malfunction, and you get faction and a random item (nothing, <br/>
junk, Bullsmasher, or Bootstrutters Framed Pack 20%weight reduction 10 slots <br/>

I have yet to get diamond dust for it :P</div>
