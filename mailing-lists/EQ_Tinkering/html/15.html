<b>Subject:</b> FINALLY FIREWATER <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-87652432">Hi, I just got an email from Matt Yaney, he does<br/>
trade skills, I think. I had emailed him before <br/>
about firewater, which he said was in the game and<br/>
in the Books. So I thought I&#39;m crazy, but I checked<br/>
and rechecked. Nada. He still says it&#39;s in there<br/>
but did tell me what Firewater is made from.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, spoiler gap and then I&#39;ll tell you<br/>
<br/>

Combine Flask Of Water + Gnomish Spirits (where <br/>
you get this? I&#39;m guessing in the Bar in Ak&#39;Anon)<br/>
<br/>
Please someone tell me I just missed this in the <br/>
two books I have on Tinkering. Because I&#39;m <br/>
leaning towards thinking it&#39;s NOT in fact in the books. Someone test it, I&#39;m at work and can&#39;t. :)<br/>
