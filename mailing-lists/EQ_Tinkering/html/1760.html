<b>Subject:</b> Aqualung Trivial Point FOUND! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803432052">Fellow Tinkers,<br/>
<br/>
I come before you to announce that I have found the sought after number.<br/>
My tinkering is now at 148 and Aqualungs are trivial to make.<br/>
<br/>
Upon reaching 148, I made my first Rebreather and it&#39;s a beaut.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow I will post a long email to the tinkering onelist detailing my exact<br/>
failure, success, and skill raise history (too tired now :o).  The main point <br/>
is<br/>
that I&#39;m getting 7 out of 9 successes on Aqualungs over a sampling of 180 <br/>
tries.<br/>
<br/>
I offer this information in the spirit of sharing that has always permeated <br/>
this<br/>
email list.  Please post the location of diamond dust if you&#39;re reading Mr. <br/>
Anon.<br/>
Share and play nice with others.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Now, in regard to the GM that said they were waiting for tinkers to get higher<br/>
before they finished putting the GemCutter in-game.  We&#39;re there!  Do it!!!!  <br/>
