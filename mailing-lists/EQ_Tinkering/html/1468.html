<div id="ygrps-yiv-994941199">Where are you getting information on availability of tinkered pets?  So far<br/>
as I know that remains an unverified rumor that they even exist...<br/>

guys the recipe is for a level 8 pet, now I know how unbalancing that would<br/>
be<br/>
to have a level 50 wizard with a level 8 pet cause damn that pet could dish<br/>
out<br/>
some heinous damage 8-12 points of damage per swing and it could take two<br/>
whole<br/>
hits, assuming the creature actually attacks  it and doesn&#39;t accidently<br/>
riposte<br/>
it to death.  To get your hopes up even higher the large power module lets<br/>
you<br/>
create a level 16 pet, OHHH THE POWER I HOLD WITHIN MY HANDS!!!!!  it&#39;s<br/>
novelty<br/>
for people is all but trust me as soon as I find the recipe you will see the<br/>
first warrior with a pet.<br/>
<br/>
On what someone else said about enchanters, Animations don&#39;t count as pets<br/>
so<br/>
the creature dubbed &quot;evil eye pet&quot; is actually an animation not a pet, they<br/>
just screwed up when the text wrote it</div>
