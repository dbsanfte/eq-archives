<div id="ygrps-yiv-193104224">Thank you much for the hint you were given.  I&#39;ll try that as soon as<br/>
I log in.  Why exactly do you think it&#39;s in Solusek&#39;s Eye?  What a<br/>
horrid place to hide something like that.  Tho, on second thought it&#39;s<br/>
not a bad idea.  Keep the good stuff for the brave.  As I understand<br/>
it there is a way to tailor snakeskin gear.  I met someone who&#39;s<br/>
friend made some.  Of course, that and the bait could be either lucky<br/>
finds or false alltogether.<br/>
