Throwing more money at problems typically makes them worse, unless you throw<br/>
the money at the right things.  Verant needs to throw money at things like<br/>
process control and testing.<br/>

&gt; Specialty-Class. This would work by keeping Tinkering a Gnome trait <br/>
&gt; available to ALL GNOMES, but those Gnomes that choose to become a <br/>
&gt; MASTER-TINKERER would have to coose to do so as a CLASS just like a <br/>
&gt; Magic-User has to choose what type of caster he wants to be, a Gnome <br/>
&gt; would have to choose between being a normal class of Gnome, or a <br/>
&gt; MASTER-TINKERER.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying here.  Tinkering is a SKILL, not a<br/>
CLASS.  Are you saying that all gnomes would have to change classes to a new<br/>
&quot;Tinkerer&quot; class?<br/>
<br/>
The &#39;unbalancing&#39; part came in because the ability to have a clockwork pet<br/>
gives pets to the classes that don&#39;t already get pets.  Even if you limit it<br/>
to gnome-only, you are faced with gnome rogues, warriors, and clerics<br/>
getting pets.  Pets are useful.  Even my dirt-stupid enchanter pet is quite<br/>
a large edge.<br/>
