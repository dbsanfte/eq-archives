<b>Subject:</b> Re: Perhaps the pole IS in a shop somewhere. Lets start looking... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878183791">I do have to admit, that now I&#39;ve been right clicking on all the fishing <br/>
poles in the shops, and I always check out every shop anyway, and even <br/>
though I&#39;ve been from Tox Forest to Ak&#39;Anon, I still say it&#39;s pretty <br/>
unlikely that you could find it in any store. Trade skill items are not <br/>
usually found in stores, save the compass, but that is only in a few remote <br/>
stores. I just think that maybe we are mising somethings, maybe a quest? You <br/>
know, some quests are not given, or even talked about unless you have high <br/>
faction, so maybe if your faction with King Ak&#39;Anon is warmly, he talks to <br/>
you and gives you a quest. Might be the same with others, you have to raise <br/>
faction high enough, and one of them might give you a quest.</div>
