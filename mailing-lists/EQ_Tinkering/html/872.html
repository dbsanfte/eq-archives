&gt; I talked to several guides last night on the Xegony server and they all<br/>
told<br/>
&gt; me that tinkering was NOT a broken skill.  I ran this by them twice saying<br/>
&gt; that a couple of the guides had said that some parts of it were broken and<br/>
&gt; they told me that it was working fine.  Just thought I would share that<br/>
info<br/>
&gt; with you guys.<br/>
