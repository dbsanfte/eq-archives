<div id="ygrps-yiv-908322847">The ball is the same graphic as the metal disk that you can buy in<br/>
Freeport.  However the reason why the guy is lvl 100 (not to mention all<br/>
his other stats are huge) is that his emulator allowed him to edit his<br/>
character and give him any item (In the same way a GM can summon any item<br/>
in the game).  Now I&#39;m willing to believe that gun exists as a graphic in<br/>
the game - but that we would never be able to tinker it and that it would<br/>
be used more-so for a special GM event.  Perhaps one lucky player in the<br/>
future will have this item but I can not imagine it will be widely<br/>
available.  I could be wrong though - heh wouldn&#39;t be the first time. :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; and used the gun in the picture as a refrence, since looking at the pic<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; site, you 1st notice the guy is lvl 100... umm YEA.. Gotta start looking<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; that :) Open graphics program and notice that the text was changed,<br/>
&gt; almost all<br/>
&gt; the text on this page was change.. other then the message text.<br/>
&gt; &lt;Graphics guy<br/>
&gt; here sorry folks&gt; You&#39;ll notice that some of the items have been<br/>
&gt; &quot;PASTED&quot; into<br/>
&gt; there respected positions, not a bad job thou.. but the smuging is<br/>
&gt; blantly<br/>
&gt; obvious even for a jpg....but the gun isn&#39;t smudged.. &lt;go look - zoom<br/>
&gt; in&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; HOWEVER... that would mean that this guy would have had to goto great<br/>
&gt; lengths<br/>
&gt; to make a new graphic and model for the &quot;gun&quot;, even thou the model info<br/>
&gt; is not<br/>
&gt; avable to public &lt;989 propritary&gt; HUMM... makes me wonder... even the<br/>
&gt; &quot;BALL&quot;<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t pasted in......<br/>
