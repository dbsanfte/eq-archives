<div id="ygrps-yiv-926094200">Someone said that in beta it was used to cut the gem out of a jeweler made <br/>
item in order for the jeweler to be able to attempt again without having to <br/>
buy another gem.  I don&#39;t have a gemcutter, but I would suspect either 1) <br/>
putting the gemcutter in a jeweler&#39;s bag with a jeweler made item and <br/>
combining or 2) putting the gemcutter in a tinkerer&#39;s toolbox with a <br/>
jeweler made item and combining would either 1) produce a gem, or 2) will <br/>
not combine.  Worth a shot.. wish I had one.<br/>
