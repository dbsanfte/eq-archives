<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811937284">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m brand new to the list, and before I go asking a bunch of questions<br/>
that I&#39;m sure have been asked a million times before, is there a<br/>
compiled email of all the knowledge that has been passed around here? If<br/>
so, can someone post it to the list or send it directly to me?<br/>
<br/>
If not, let me know that and I&#39;ll start regaling you all with questions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a million.<br/>
<br/>
-Michael O&#39;Reilly</div>
