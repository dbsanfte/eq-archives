<div id="ygrps-yiv-965896367">incidently, any bard can go down there too and speak with them. one of the<br/>
bard songs will boost faction enough so that they view amiably. i wandered<br/>
around for a while, but didn&#39;t find anything useful myself. all i found<br/>
was the vendor who sells the tinkered bag, which he would sell to me for<br/>
5700pp.<br/>

Well, I have a gnome rogue (level 25) who I just brought there last <br/>
night... I&#39;m going to see if I can sneak my way down to the gnomes.  If<br/>
not <br/>
I will try to get a group that is heading that way...  Problem with<br/>
soloing <br/>
there is that the gobs run when low on hps and go get help.. Can start <br/>
really vicious trains there.</div>
