<b>Subject:</b> thoughts about the pole... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-208199481">I think the pole is in the game and it is tinkerable.<br/>
<br/>
But at the moment I&#39;m at a loss as to what to try in terms of a formula.<br/>
<br/>
Some thoughts I have about different components are:<br/>
<br/>
Fishing poles - It seems resonable, I suppose, if your looking at the<br/>
collapsable fishing pole as a modification of an existing pole.  Or perhaps<br/>
from the standpoint of cannibalizing the reel and string from a pole.<br/>
<br/>
Shafts - I think so, just from the statement that the pole was comfused<br/>
with a spyglass, which operates on a telescoping mechanism.<br/>
<br/>
Rods - Well, the pole is very light and flimsy, thats why you have to add<br/>
an extra rod to support the weight of a bottle, lens and twine in order to<br/>
make a spyglass.  So I don&#39;t think a rod is in the recipie<br/>
<br/>
Gears - If a fishing pole is in the recipe because the reel is being<br/>
cannibalized I don&#39;t see any logical reason to have gears<br/>
<br/>
Sprocket - Same as gear<br/>
<br/>
String - possibly...  depends on weather or not the fishing line is<br/>
cabbibalized from the other fishing poles in the recipe.  At any rate I<br/>
doubt it is the metal twine, more likely its a clothe twine or cord or<br/>
silken thread of some sort.<br/>
<br/>
Cork - could be a possibility<br/>
<br/>
Spricket - what the hell is a spriket?<br/>
<br/>
Bolts - Its possible that if the reel is cannibalized from an existing<br/>
pole, that a bolt will be needed to mount it to a shaft<br/>
<br/>
Grease - Also possible to lubricate the shafts so that they collapse easily.<br/>
<br/>
Raw bamboo - another possibility<br/>
<br/>
Price for pole:  I bet it doesn&#39;t cost much more than 5 plat to make, and<br/>
is an easy item like the lantern and compass.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the decision that needs to be made is this:<br/>
<br/>
Is the collapsable fishing pole a modification of a regular pole<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
Is the collapsable fishing pole something created entirely from tinker<br/>
components<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I think this question needs to be answered is that if it is a<br/>
modification, then we need to look at parts that would follow that line of<br/>
reasoning.<br/>
