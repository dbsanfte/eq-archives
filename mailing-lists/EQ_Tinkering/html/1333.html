<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177526264">You dont have a company of your own thats for sure. If i am making something and have alot failures i have to count that in to the price.<br/>
Lets take this example:<br/>
<br/>
I got an order of 8 Bow cam�s for 25 pp each.<br/>
I started making cam�s and hade 4 failures even tho they are trivial to me.<br/>
That�s 8x15=120 + 4x15=60 =180 Profit of 20 pp.<br/>
Well with that kind of profit i just wont do the work i rather go  out and get me some some XP and 100 pp in loot for the same amount of time it take, or just sitt around talking with friends  wich i do the most.<br/>
<br/>
And you also have to see to  the market here,  what is the easiest to get your hands on in EQ ??? right CASH CASH CASH.<br/>
<br/>
So many ppl that bought the spyglass from he says that Kewl that was a nice trinket for 100 pp (pocket change). Atleast on Veeshan who has alot of high level ppl.  i�m just so damn glad that you arent on the same server as me, or i would for sure quit playing. Well not quiting just dont do Tinkering. I dont know your level but if you can tinker the lung�s you must be fairly high and are you doing it for fun maybe and if so it�s even worse then i could imagen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And what the hell is that stupid talk about greedy ??????????????????????<br/>
<br/>
If i make something i want to cover my costs and get a profit out of it, it dosent have to be a large profit but  you say that you sell the lung for 400 pp and you have how many failures ? if you just have a failure rate of 50% that�s 500 pp for each lung and you lose 100 pp and that�s good and &quot;honest&quot;   ?????????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Either you are an high level player who is bored or you cant sell things.<br/>
<br/>
I tried selling the spyglass for 100 pp each and ppl bought them, and bought them alot !! i have so much cash in the bank  now that i can get my skill up and start making aqua lungs for guild friends and such. One last thing by taking maybe a bit high price for my wares i can give away some  of the things i make, take the stalking probes for an example if i make on i dont sell it i give it away to someone who  either is a newbie or to 1 who  buying a spyglass from me.<br/>
<br/>
And what realy make me sick is when ppl come up to me and  says:  Hey why are you charging that ? it only cost this much to make so i wont pay more then this!!. Huh ?? i would like to see the company that dosent charge for development and failures and still be in business for long.<br/>
<br/>
PS If this sounds like a flame and personal attack it is not, couse you arent on the same server as me :-)<br/>
Even tho i heard that someone is selling rebreathers for 800 pp on Veeshan wich i am gonna belive when i see it, and if they do i  just dont tinker to sell any more just to friends and guildmates.<br/>

&gt; thank ye kindly for insulting my intelligence.  paying 1k for a <br/>
&gt; Lung....congratulations on fooling the masses.  personnaly i think it is <br/>
&gt; taking advantage of ppl.  the return i get far outweighs my expenses, and i <br/>
&gt; am selling them faster than i can make em.  as for all gnomes who sell <br/>
&gt; scopes for 100 plat...HAHAHA. wow, you must find the stupidest ppl in the <br/>
&gt; world to pull that scam off.  personally, i am kind of disgusted that so <br/>
&gt; many ppl here are so greedy. i have never before been disgusted to be a <br/>
&gt; gnome...but there is a first time for everything i guess.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I dont know what the hell you outhers do but i think you need an marketing <br/>
&gt; &gt;department.  I would never ever selll a aqua lung for 400 pp, thats just <br/>
&gt; &gt;insane and plain stupid.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;900-1000 pp for it is fair i think  and   with a note with it that if they <br/>
&gt; &gt;come back for an uppgrade to Rebreather for say 1000 more + componet cost. <br/>
&gt; &gt;That would be around 1600 pp i think, is that right ?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I dont sell the fishing pole and those outher low skill items outher if <br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone order it, i get to many failures even  on trivial items to be worth <br/>
&gt; &gt;making them and selling them at a large scale. Take Bow cam�s for example, <br/>
&gt; &gt;i gor an order of 8 cam�s it took 12 tries to make 8, thats 4 failures and <br/>
&gt; &gt;i sold them for 25 pp each, it�s almost nno profit at all so     in the <br/>
&gt; &gt;futare i�m going to charge 30 pp for them i think if i even sell them.<br/>
