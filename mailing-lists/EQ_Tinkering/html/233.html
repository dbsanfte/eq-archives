<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;All the lenses are for the observer Staff.    For sure.    That is not an<br/>
&gt;issue.    I have seen people complete this quest in akanon so it can be <br/>
&gt;done.<br/>
&gt;    There is a whole guild on the Povar server Named the Harmonium that <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;these staffs from accomplishing the four lenses quest.     granted You can<br/>
&gt;also get the staff off the borxx evil eye by obtaining his lense.    But I<br/>
&gt;have seen high level characters in the mino caves in steam font get the <br/>
&gt;lense<br/>
&gt;from the slave in there.    They do it regularly to keep their lower level<br/>
&gt;guildies equipped. </span></blockquote></div>
