That hole is huge.  If you swim down far enough you hit... NOTHING!  I even<br/>
scraped the walls to see if I could find a secret room, nothing.  Anywho.  I<br/>
scanned all of Ak&#39;anon today underwater (145 swimming currently).  Didn&#39;t see<br/>
anything cool to note.  Scanned for about an hour or so.  Was a waste of time I<br/>
think.<br/>

&gt; Though one time I thought there might be something under all that water in<br/>
&gt; ak&#39;anon and I swam around all one day.  Didn&#39;t find anything.  I did find a<br/>
&gt; place where you can swim behind the wall out in front of the mines where the<br/>
&gt; Necro guild is, but I drowned and had to call a gm to get my corpse out.<br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;ll see if I can find someone to cast endureing breath so I can<br/>
&gt; search in there more fully.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Nay, actually, when I want to be, I can get much of what I want. Thats how<br/>
