<b>Subject:</b> Cap on tinkering? and a fifth book.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534873534">ok i am a level 17 gnome necro with a 71 in the skill, with a cap that <br/>
isn&#39;t possible. 16th level = 50 skill pts in tinkering+10 for actually <br/>
tinkering. 17th 60+5 more = 65pts. I am a 71 6pts above max i think<br/>
the cap is gone or it never was either way give thanks rejoice and sing<br/>
to the power of the gnome:) Could there possibly be a 5th book? I have <br/>
read no where about the infravison goggles with may/may not exist, but<br/>
people seem to think they do and that we can make um. I am going exploring<br/>
after 20 to find any and all gnomes in this god for saken land and see<br/>
what they say, even with bad faction.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reply btw on the red 5 stuff just curious if that was <br/>
what we needed and (thanks verant) it wasn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
Grundup the necro</div>
