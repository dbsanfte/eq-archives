<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552983622">If you&#39;re talking to the bank teller, you can freely exchange money in<br/>
your inventory screen to whatever type of coin you want.  I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
it would be all that difficult to say that if PlayerX is holding a<br/>
coin-changer then it would run the same subroutine - minus the ability to<br/>
interchange items in the bank.<br/>
<br/>
But then again - I have no way of knowing how they have programmed EQ. :)<br/>

&gt; That would be truely usefull and I can&#39;t see how it could imbalance the<br/>
&gt; game if it were to be made a charged item.  The only problem is I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; see how they could possible implement such a thing.  All items that have<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; special ability are based on magic and there&#39;s no magic equivalent to<br/>
&gt; this.  I could see how this could work as a combine/tradeskill based<br/>
&gt; item<br/>
&gt; if you could put money in an inventory slot and press combine, but I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think you can put money in an inventory slot can you?<br/>
