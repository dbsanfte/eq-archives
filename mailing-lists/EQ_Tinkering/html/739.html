<b>Subject:</b> Re: lindel has a gnome! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-906444963">Hey I was in qeynos with my gnome today and I saw a Lindell (2 L&#39;s) but I<br/>
didn&#39;t ask about the pole because like someone said, it might not be a good<br/>
idea to scare him off. He was only on for a bit (at least i only saw him for<br/>
a bit) he was talking to a friend whos name I forget and said he was gonna<br/>
go play his gnome. So he does have a gnome char and his name spelling is<br/>
Lindell. thats all I know. if its the same lindel/lindell.. Sorry i dont<br/>
know more</div>
