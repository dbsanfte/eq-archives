<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378736025">I was at some wedding on Fen Ro a few weeks ago and one of the GMs there was<br/>
a gnome (Can&#39;t recall name now)  At the end the gnome was casting some<br/>
awesome spells that made the whole area light up with amazing techno colors.<br/>
I didn&#39;t think to ask then if they were fireworks, tho.  But it was the most<br/>
amazing light show I&#39;ve seen on EQ.  I wonder if they were infact the<br/>
gnomish fireworks....?<br/>
