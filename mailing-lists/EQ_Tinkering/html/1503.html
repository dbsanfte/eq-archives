<div id="ygrps-yiv-989242283">Last night I headed over to Felwithe and fetched <br/>
a handful of Bat Wings.<br/>
<br/>
I was suprised that I got a set of 4 rockets back.<br/>
I sparked off the first saw a red flare and thought &#39;cool&#39;.<br/>
Hit it again, nothing.  /shrug.<br/>
<br/>
Tried another one, this time Green, alright.<br/>
Right Click &quot;ah&quot;, 1 charge I got it...<br/>
I&#39;ll try outside ontop of a hill and futz around<br/>
with firing angle, but for a first experience, it&#39;s<br/>
still a novelty item.<br/>
<br/>
So if Rod & Wing + FireWater for fuel, <br/>
can an empty rocket be recharged?<br/>
<br/>
My toolbox is full of the 8 others I made, <br/>
so I didn&#39;t have room to try reloading &#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
Will search the Archives here, but figured I&#39;d ask anew.<br/>
