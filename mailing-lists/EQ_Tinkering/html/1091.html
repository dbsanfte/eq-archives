<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671161371">Well, I don�t know if this has anything at all to do<br/>
with tinkering, but I�ll post it here in case any of<br/>
you have the resources and contacts to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
You see, the other day as I was on my way in Steamfont<br/>
to try out the new tinkering recipies, I met the Cargo<br/>
clockwork on it�s way to the windmills. (It was that<br/>
big one that usually stands beside the entrance to<br/>
Ak�Anon).<br/>
<br/>
As I came closer I saw an ogre player beating on it,<br/>
and I waited till he finished, to hear from him what<br/>
loot he�d get. He killed it, and to my big surprise a<br/>
gnome appeared from under the corpse. His name was<br/>
driver Bryggin, and it seems he is driving the Cargo<br/>
clockwork.<br/>
<br/>
Before I could hail him the ogre started killing him<br/>
too. The gnome beat hard so the ogre had to flee, but<br/>
the gnome died anyway. I guess the ogre had cast a DoT<br/>
spell on it or something. With the ogre away I looted<br/>
the corpses, but they had nothing valuable. The<br/>
clockwork had scrap metal and the gnome had a rusty<br/>
dagger.<br/>
So my question is, has any of you ever tried to hail<br/>
Driver Bryggin? Could he have a quest, or even be a<br/>
merchant? Anyone interested in checking? I surely<br/>
don�t want to get messed up factins in Ak�Anon by<br/>
killing the clockwork myself.<br/>
