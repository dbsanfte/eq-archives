<div id="ygrps-yiv-606035169">While I&#39;m happy about the new tinker items, I&#39;m also sad to see them<br/>
implemented in such a poor fashion.<br/>
<br/>
I could see the aqualung costing 150 plat per attempt if it only weighed 1<br/>
lb, but at 10lbs, its also to the point of being to heavy for most casters<br/>
to use, and certainly no monk is going to want it, especially with just 50<br/>
charges, and it not being rechargable.<br/>
<br/>
The rebreather seems kind of nice, with infinate charges of enduring<br/>
breathe (picture on equalizer) but it weighs 10 lbs as well, and costs 750<br/>
plat per attempt.  Thats once again, way to heavy, unless you carry it<br/>
around in a weight reducing bag.<br/>
<br/>
At the very least, they could uncap our tinker skills from our level so we<br/>
can train up to be able to make these things.  And they could revamp the<br/>
trivial level for items to give us a few cheaper items to raise skill on.<br/>
For example, collapsable poles could trivial out at 65, then lanterns at<br/>
85, then cams, then spyglasses etc...<br/>
