<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-748484020">I talked to guide Terald the Tall today on Bristlebane... He&#39;s a gnome cleric<br/>
(Level 49) guide.  I asked him about tinkering and he said it wasn&#39;t fully<br/>
implemented.  I asked him if he tinkered and he said no, that basically because<br/>
it was broken.<br/>
<br/>
***The following are my opinions, nothing to do with what the guide said ****<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that maybe the guy with the recipes got some inside information.  I<br/>
also suspect once they fix whatever the problem is, a third book will appear in<br/>
the windmills or the existing books will change carrying additional<br/>
information.  I bet the third book contains, animated bait, firewater,<br/>
collapsible fishing pole and quite possibly gnomish fireworks.  Its quite likely<br/>
that they can&#39;t get the gnomish fireworks worked out right (balancing issues) so<br/>
they haven&#39;t released the book.  That&#39;s my thoughts, I won&#39;t try until I see the<br/>
recipes :|<br/>
