<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516896028">Money is still an issue with me at level 54.  I tend to give good loot <br/>
items to friends.  I&#39;m sure I could have gotten a mint for the Sword of the <br/>
Morning I looted (was offered such), but a guildmate is a high level <br/>
paladin and really wanted the sword.  So I gave it to him.  Now I&#39;m out <br/>
50,000pp, but it doesn&#39;t bother me.  Given that its 220pp per attempt on <br/>
aqualungs and no one wants them, I&#39;ve pretty much stopped trying to raise <br/>
my tinkering skill pass the catapult trivial point.  Just don&#39;t have that <br/>
kind of cash lying around.<br/>

&gt; &gt; yeah, but at what levels does this start happening? i mean cmon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Somewhere around 45 money became a nonissue. I had most that I wanted, the<br/>
&gt;rest was loot or trade only or was silly expensive. Highest I have ever seen<br/>
&gt;is 8k but I buy things for friends often as well so money never stays long. I<br/>
&gt;still stay at 5k or so avg but if I would sell items rather than give them<br/>
&gt;away to friends I would alwyas have lots more :) </span></blockquote></div>
