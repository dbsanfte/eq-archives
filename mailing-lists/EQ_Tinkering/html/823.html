<b>Subject:</b> Exploring the windmills <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-776594523">Someone mentioned that a gm said there was tinkering info in the windmills.<br/>
Well I search it throughly.  I thought maybe there was something to the fact<br/>
that you can stop the wheels inside from spinning by clicking on them.  Also<br/>
I discovered you can stop the windmill&#39;s blades from spinning by getting<br/>
under them and clicking on them.  When you click on the wheels inside they<br/>
stop for a while then start spinning again, but when you click on the blades<br/>
and make them stop, they stay stopped.  And the blades and the wheels spin<br/>
independently.  I haven&#39;t been able to figure out the purpose for making<br/>
them stop.  I also got someone cast levitate on me and I was able to explore<br/>
the outsides of the windmill towers.  I even managed to get to the top of<br/>
the windmills by climbing around on the blades.  I didn&#39;t find anything.<br/>
I&#39;d really like to know what the purpose is of being able to control the<br/>
windmills like that.<br/>
<br/>
Only thing I can think of is either the gm meant the tinkering books at the<br/>
merchant or there&#39;s something to do with the npcs there.  I&#39;m level 22 and<br/>
Jogle cons blue to me.  And he does walk out into the field alone from time<br/>
to time.  I&#39;d hate to do it, but it might be possible to kill him when he&#39;s<br/>
out there.  Anyone know what he drops if anything?<br/>
