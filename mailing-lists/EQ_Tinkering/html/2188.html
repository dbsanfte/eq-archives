<div id="ygrps-yiv-9242165">I understand what you are saying regarding a tinkering class, and it does <br/>
sound real cool.  Will it happen? no, but still it would be <br/>
awesome.  Imagine at the character creation screen, you select a gnome, and <br/>
the option for a tinkerer as the class is selectable.  You pick that class, <br/>
then a name and religion.  You start out with a tinkerer&#39;s toolbox, 5 <br/>
breads, 5 waters, and a note to go see Tobon Starpyre (if you are a good <br/>
religion) or Meldrath the Mad (if you are an evil religion).  At level one, <br/>
you get small clockwork rat plans.  This gets &#39;learned&#39; (memorized) into <br/>
your notebook (spellbook).  You get the components of the rat (firewater, <br/>
Sprocket #6, Gizmo #4, 2 gears, bottle, and metal twine) and hit the <br/>
clockwork pet create button (spell button).  If you fail (fizzle) you loose <br/>
some of the components, if not, you just created your level 1 pet.  Now, <br/>
level 30 comes and you get the plans for a tinkered boom stick (metal <br/>
shaft, 3 gears, and a Sprocket #5) that uses ammo (level 30) created from <br/>
(firework, metal ball, and metal shaft).  Maybe level 35 could be a double <br/>
barreled boom stick.  Some devices would be class restrictive (like boom <br/>
stick where only tinkerer could use) others not (like rebreather where all <br/>
could use)  This could be fun.  Will it happen.  No, not a chance.  Darn it.<br/>
