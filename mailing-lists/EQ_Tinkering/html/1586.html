<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738610876">Actaullty the humorous thing about Bullsmasher is that it is listed as being<br/>
useable by all classes that can use regular warhammers, including Monks.. Can<br/>
you imagine a gnome monk? :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone that says a 6/20 weapon is crap becasue it&#39;s not magical probably hasnt<br/>
used one - I primary wield the bullsmasher with a PGT and it kicks all sorts of<br/>
mob tail :) On the rare occaison I need to fight a magic mob I switch the<br/>
bullsmasher with a dragoon dirk. Considering that you can get this weapon at<br/>
level 5-6, it gets my vote for the best weapon in the game :)<br/>
<br/>
On another note, Manik Completon actually responds to &quot;What is Bull Smasher&quot;,<br/>
which I find interesting - the text isn&#39;t too interesting, but perhaps its a<br/>
placeholder for a quest to get a magical upgrade...</div>
