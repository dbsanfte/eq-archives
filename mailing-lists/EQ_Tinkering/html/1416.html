<div id="ygrps-yiv-945838170">Damn if I could make a bag of the tinkers, I&#39;d be the most popular (and<br/>
rich) gnome ever!  IF we get the opportunity to discover a recipe for this,<br/>
I&#39;m sure it will also involve tailoring, and lord knows what other<br/>
skills....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok folks i have searched for a good long time and found a few items I knew<br/>
how to make, a few I previously did not know how to make and also a few<br/>
theory items. Here goes: Firewater, flameless torch, compass, cams,<br/>
lockpicks, spyglass, stalking probs, animated bait, collapsable fishing<br/>
pole, aqua lung,<br/>
&gt; rebreather, Gem cutter ( if we could get a hold of diamond dust any new<br/>
info out there?. Now we come to what is only theory and people ( at least<br/>
from what i have read) arn&#39;t real sure about..... Thermal cloak ( Tattered<br/>
gnomish cloak, metal rods firwater and maybe a belt..) Infered goggles ( no<br/>
clue).  Here is something that just might make our tinkering worth while....<br/>
the tinkerer&#39;s bag.<br/>
&gt; This bag which can be purchased in Sol A ( only rumor, but from 2 sources)<br/>
this item costs 6k plat and has ten slots, everything in the bag is<br/>
weightless 100%.<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know if WE the tinkerer&#39;s of Norath can make this item ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; side note : this was all extracted from the web and a few good tinkerer&#39;s<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; several servers i hope it may be of some use to u all and if there is any<br/>
info<br/>
&gt; please share it:) where do we buy the third tinkerers book btw?<br/>
