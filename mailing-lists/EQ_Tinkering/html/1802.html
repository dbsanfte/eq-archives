<div id="ygrps-yiv-274460430">Duster V and Duster X give no faction hits<br/>
I&#39;ve never cleaned any of the cleaners or scrubbers though, and I&#39;m not<br/>
keen to..<br/>
Though when I was playing my dwarf and doing the metal rat quest, I killed<br/>
the cleaner X that was in Kaladim, and took a faction hit with &quot;Clockwork<br/>
gnome&quot;, a faction I hadn&#39;t seen before.. As well as dropping the scrap<br/>
metal required for the dwarf quest, the cleaner also dropped a &quot;Bozanite<br/>
pestle&quot;, a no -drop lore item that looked like a metal rod, though turning<br/>
it in with the scrap did nothing.</div>
