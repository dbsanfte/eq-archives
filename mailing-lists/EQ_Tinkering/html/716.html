<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372171407">I killed the gnome spelunker in Unrest a few minutes ago... He and his skel monk<br/>
friend attacked me on site... He shouted something about hating wizards and then<br/>
they promptly dispatched me... I gathered a group and went and killed him... His<br/>
drop, gnome meat.  Yep, the group said he also dropped a nice bag sometimes.  I&#39;m<br/>
gonna keep at him, maybe get something good... but at 27 I could enstill him and<br/>
hit him with 3 frost shocks and he went down.. The skel monk friend is tougher...<br/>
resisted my enstill and resisted much of my frost shocks, but we got him finally.<br/>
<br/>
I get experience from him, so I may just camp him if I can.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I got no faction hit for killing him.  I think he has something against<br/>
gnomes.  He didnt attack our puller until he was attacked (high elf, I think)...<br/>
when I went in, the both jumped me.<br/>
