<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191057706">Well , There are certainly alot of issues with this Tinkering problem that we <br/>
gnomes are having and granted we spend alot of money and time doing these <br/>
things...Now I want to lay an Idea or two I have about Enchanters and the <br/>
issues we all face here in Norratth how many time do you wish that you didnt <br/>
die in a zone hostile to you, but a druid or an enchanter could just wander <br/>
in untouched due to thier illusion....makes you stew right?....Well ,I am an <br/>
enchanter  tring to get support for request on change on how enchanters can&#39;t <br/>
share illusions with others if given permission to it would be a neat way to <br/>
get your corpse or ya thru a dangous area without cring foul to a GM or Guide <br/>
about how your stuck somewhere and wiat 4 hours...just to hear them say i <br/>
can&#39;t help you.....here is a letter Written by me to verant....If ya wanna <br/>
help its up to you but only the players can make a difference&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Today I witnessed a great fun it was to have the spirit wolf Illusion <br/>
 </span></blockquote>shared by a druid to me. However , that distresses me about the way <br/>
Enchanters are capeable of illusions long before the druids can and there art <br/>
involves illusions so much, but not have a system of sharing any of the <br/>
illusions like the druid. A few friends and I came with a few Ideas to be <br/>
involved with either Everquest as it is now or when you up the level limit. <br/>
The main purpose of this letter is to express on how illusions can be <br/>
benificial to not only the player but the staff at EQ. Here is a few possiple <br/>
examples to introduce to you the ways to incoperate this:  (1) Limit it to <br/>
high level enchanters spells only....24th and up...... (2) could make it a <br/>
group only function like the share wolf form with druid............(3) As a <br/>
safeguard so no one is turned into a illusion without permission....make it <br/>
like the ressurect spell posting ,so before you turn into another form so <br/>
people can choose yes or no....  /   As for the benifiet of the staff if you <br/>
include the casting of all race illusions you will possibly cut down the <br/>
nagging of players needlessly asking for your guides to get them out of zones <br/>
they should have not been in the first place...and would add some more spice <br/>
to the game.Asit is ya guys looked like you ran out of ideas for illusions <br/>
once you  hit the levels of 34th(only 1) , 44th (only 1), and ,49th <br/>
(none)......Before that you had at least 2 per level starting at level <br/>
4....if enchanters cant at least share a few illusions by level 9th we are <br/>
really should be ashamed since the druid can share wolf form at level 39th <br/>
and enchanters with the art of illusion in our back pocket <br/>
cant......Sincerely Cloverleaf &lt;Fennin Ro Server&gt;</div>
