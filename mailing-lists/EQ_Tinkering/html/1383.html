<div id="ygrps-yiv-505161331">I&#39;m not a tinker, I&#39;ll say that from the start... but my girlfriend plays a<br/>
gnome, so I joined this list about.. oh, 143 messages ago in hope of getting<br/>
information to help her tinker.<br/>
<br/>
I have spoken to the little gnome in Rathe Mountains, and from the dialog,<br/>
it would seem that he is willing to work on the more exquisite gems, and<br/>
asks what I have... at this point, I ran out of time and had to go, but I<br/>
think that exploring the possible dialogs with him is the answer.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest everyone go talk to him, as he did offer to work on gems, we just<br/>
have to find out the hidden key words.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your tinkering everyone, if anyone on Bertoxxulous ever gets<br/>
to the re-breather stage, I would love to buy or trade for one.<br/>
