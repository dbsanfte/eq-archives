<div id="ygrps-yiv-393121064">Dont forget to do a &quot;/feedback&quot; and tell Verant they need to reduce the weigh of the lungs and rebreathers.<br/>
<br/>
As I figured, after I maxed on stalking probes at 102, I had to cycle about 40,000 plat thru the skill to get to the point where rebreathers can be made with a tolerable success rate.<br/>
<br/>
My skill is 127 at the moment and my success rate for rebreathers is 1 out of 3. I am trying to sell them for 3250 on tunare.<br/>
<br/>

P.S. To the guy that asked where all the component are for the lungs and rebreathers, check in the back of the necro guild in akanon, you should find a vendor in there somewhere...heh-heh...</div>
