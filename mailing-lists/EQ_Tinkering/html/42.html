<div id="ygrps-yiv-887133373">My question is Where do you find the gnome spirits for the fire water (Or <br/>
does any alcohol work?) and is the Tool box still bugged?  AKA can&#39;t put in <br/>
bank, drop, trade, etc?  Also does anyone have a listing of what tinkering <br/>
components there are?  Are the Gizmos and sprockets used?  I travel a lot <br/>
as a monk and I have never seen ANY other books.  I DO know there are 5 <br/>
volumes to the Alchemy books so maybe there are 5 to the tinkers.  Though <br/>
the alchemy ones are all in the same place.<br/>
<br/>
I want to set up a site on my page for tinkering so am gathering any info <br/>
on it I can.<br/>

first i would like to say ya&#39;ll are doin a great thing here. Here&#39;s what<br/>
i have heard, there are three other books(besides the two at mills)<br/>
where or when you get em is beyond me. I too have made the firewater,<br/>
and the lantern, and say one person auctioning off the cams for the<br/>
bows, so i know those have been made also. As has already been posted i<br/>
too heard that the infravision goggles instructions came from a quest.<br/>
Which one i don&#39;t know. Also i know as a fact that you can tinker<br/>
successfully at level 1, but cannot gain any skill level til level 16.<br/>
So all of you that are waiting to try it, go for it...it will work, i<br/>
decided to try it at level 11 with my gnome, and made fire water on<br/>
first try. Also i believe that you can make the thermal cloak from just<br/>
about any cloak...doesn&#39;t have to be tattered... I am wanting to try<br/>
similar things with lanterns ans stuff..(i.e. use small lantern and<br/>
such). If anyone has tried it with other items please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
