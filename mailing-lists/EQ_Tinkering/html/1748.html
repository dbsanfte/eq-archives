<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218965482">I would not recommend tinkering rebreathers until a skill of 125. By then you can expect around a 1 in 3 success rate. I did ok trying to sell them for 3250, after I got my skill up some more my success rate improved a bit and am doing better selling them for 3100. Aqua lungs are still not trivial at 135.<br/>
