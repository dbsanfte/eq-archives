<b>Subject:</b> Flaming and the thermal cloak <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-334730464">1) Please keep your silly flames off this board.  I was excited to<br/>
see <br/>
that there were 8 items in the summary post that got emailed to me, <br/>
and disappointed that 7 of them were just you people calling each <br/>
other names.  <br/>
<br/>
2) I believe that we were told specifically by Abashi that the <br/>
&#39;Tattered Gnomish Cloak&#39; was not in fact in the game in any form.  I <br/>
would not waste any resources trying to create the thermal cloak<br/>
until <br/>
we&#39;ve been told by Verant that they&#39;re actively working on the <br/>
tinkering skill.  Especially given the info received by the anon. GM <br/>
over at Fulcrum&#39;s site about the personal heater being a red herring. <br/>
 The time frame was &#39;after poison.&#39;  Poison is slated to be fixed by <br/>
the end of June - I&#39;m not gonna worry about new tinkering items until <br/>
July at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to save you folks some effort in case you missed the <br/>
abashi quote the first time around.<br/>
