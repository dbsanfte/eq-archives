&lt;&lt; thank ye kindly for insulting my intelligence.  paying 1k for a <br/>
 Lung....congratulations on fooling the masses.  personnaly i think it is <br/>
 taking advantage of ppl.  the return i get far outweighs my expenses, and i <br/>
 am selling them faster than i can make em.  as for all gnomes who sell <br/>
 scopes for 100 plat...HAHAHA. wow, you must find the stupidest ppl in the <br/>
 world to pull that scam off.  personally, i am kind of disgusted that so <br/>
 many ppl here are so greedy. i have never before been disgusted to be a <br/>
 gnome...but there is a first time for everything i guess.<br/>
