<div id="ygrps-yiv-159769685">To answer all of you I am going to tell you. I&#39;m going to get level 19, <br/>
which won&#39;t take me long at all, and check it out tonight. I&#39;m  just holding <br/>
back a little because I want to deliver a full report, which would be the <br/>
most useful to us all, rather than just giving you the information and that <br/>
all. The next message I send should be later tonight. I think I will be able <br/>
to include a full report and account. I will do it as soon as I can.<br/>
<br/>
Until then, good luck friends.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; Well than, Mr Buser. You can belive what you want, and you can choose <br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; listen, or belive what I tell you, but I have information, and I think <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt; &gt; could assist us all greatly. If you disagree, then you can go about your<br/>
&gt;own<br/>
&gt; &gt; way to finding the fishing pole, or the thirs book, or whatever our goal<br/>
&gt;is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;oh, I&#39;d gladly believe in you and worship you, if you tell us where instead<br/>
&gt;of playing games.<br/>
