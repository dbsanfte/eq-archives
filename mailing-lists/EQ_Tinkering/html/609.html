<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101182641">Same experience here.  I sank 300plat into tinkering (flameless lanterns)<br/>
and didn&#39;t increase one darn skill point.  That&#39;s either broken, or a sick<br/>
joke on verants side.  Good lord they must be laughin their asses off at<br/>
people that are tryin to raise skill in tinkering.  With the stuff being<br/>
non-stackable (for the most part), it takes forever and a year to make<br/>
stuff, and then to get no skill raise.  Ugh!<br/>

&gt; I just did a Petition to a GM today, and after being shuffled around a<br/>
bit,<br/>
&gt; I was able to bring up that I was a 29th level Gnome that has been<br/>
Tinkering<br/>
&gt; for quite a while and had sunk over 100 plat into getting ONE tick, and I<br/>
&gt; tought Tinkering skill was broke or messed up.  He said he heard of cases<br/>
&gt; that 10,000 Plat was needed to get a point, I kinda lost it there and<br/>
called<br/>
&gt; EQ many names we can&#39;t say in public (but not to him, just to EQ, not a<br/>
good<br/>
&gt; idea to piss of a Guide  ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I wanted to see if there were any Gnomes that did get their skill up,<br/>
&gt; and if so how?  You can check to see if your skill has moved from its base<br/>
&gt; 50 by going to your skills and checking to see if it is still &quot;Below<br/>
&gt; Average&quot; or not, as average stats at 51.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trying to find a pattern here, GM said Tinkering not broken, I say it is<br/>
&gt; from what I have seen on my character, and from listening to others.<br/>
