      <p><font size="2">Hiya all, I&#39;m a moron and managed to pick up a virus, I 
      really had no idea it was there until i started getting strange crashes 
      (IEXPLORE cause a general protection fault in module wsock32.dll) and a 
      bunch of my everquest log files and opt files started showing up on my 
      desktop. If you arent running any antivirus software/havent run it in a 
      while, please do so soon. </font>

      <p><font size="2">Below you will find some info on the nasty little bug that 
      got me. Sorry all, I&quot;ll try and be a little more vigilant in the 
      future</font>

      <p>Win32:Hybris</p><b>Win32:Hybris</b> is an Internet worm which has the 
      capability to update itself via Internet. There is a kernel part and 
      separate &quot;plugins&quot; which can be swaped or even upgraded via Internet. 
      These plugins are encrypted with quite strong cryptography. 
      <p>When executed, Win32:Hybris infects WSOCK32.DLL and sends itself in a 
      separate message complementary&nbsp; to any meassage sent from the 
      infected computer.&nbsp; The subject, text of the message and the name of 
      the attached file are part of the plugin so they could be changed via 
      upgrade mechanism. The basic version can contain the texts in English, 
      French, Spanish and Portugese. The English message has sometimes the 
      subject &quot;Snowhite and the Seven Dwarfs - The REAL story!&quot; and the body 
      contains the adult version of the well known tale.&nbsp; 
      <p>The upgrade mechanism of this worm is very flexible and could be 
      changed in the future via the special plugins. Currently it can download 
      the plugins from the dedicated web page and it can get them from the 
      special Usenet discussion group called alt.comp.virus. All instances of 
      worm can upload and download the encrypted plugins in a special format 
      with identifier and version number into this mailing group. Another 
      plugins are responsible for ZIP and RAR infections. There could be some 
      more in the future. </p></td></tr></tbody></table></font></div></html></div>
