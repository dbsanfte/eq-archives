<b>Subject:</b> Wooden Shards - doubtful tinkering item <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-120299379"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I doubt that wooden shards are used in tinkering.  The reason being that you have to kill Treants to get them, not to mention they are way out in the Karanas and you take some major faction hits.  All tinkering supplies<br/>
&gt; are currently found in Steamfont, so I doubt that they would make a gnome travel all that way just for a fishing pole.  But hey, it was worth a try.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Wooden Shards<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was trying to complete a quest in Ogguk the other day and was exploring<br/>
&gt; the different parts of the city (ya, I know their arn&#39;t many) and checking<br/>
&gt; out the local merchants.  Deep inside Ogguk their is an NPC called chief<br/>
&gt; dooga (he&#39;s the one you get the HEHE meat off for a grobb quest) One of<br/>
&gt; things he was selling was wooden shards, sort of sounds like a tinkering<br/>
&gt; item... Any thoughts?<br/>
