<b>Subject:</b> Perhaps the Gemchopper needs an actual gem to work? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-707678262">As mentioned in my previous post, I tried the gemchopper in a tool box with a perl and got jack...<br/>
<br/>
However that does not rule out the possibility that it might work with some thing that is actually a gem, like a ruby or a diamond or something. Perhaps a less expensive gem.<br/>
<br/>
Talked to a GM after I made my first chopper, all he said was that it chops gems... Has anyone tried right clicking on it or something to see if it can be used directly on a gem? Seems to be pretty fucking worthless as a gem chopper to me.<br/>
