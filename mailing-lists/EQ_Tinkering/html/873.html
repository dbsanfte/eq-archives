<div id="ygrps-yiv-759671990">I talked to a GM tonight. He is a GM, a game master, that means that he <br/>
works AT Verant, and gets payed for being a guide, and, he IS told stuff <br/>
about what happens in the game. He is a very trustworthy GM too.<br/>
One time, when I asked him about something, he said he could answer me, <br/>
because he didn&#39;t know the full truth on it, and didn&#39;t want to start a <br/>
bunch of rmors about it, so he doesn&#39;t say something unless it&#39;s confirmed. <br/>
He told me that tinkering WAS broken. I asked him what broken meant and he <br/>
said there there was one tinkering book missing and some of the combinations <br/>
that should work don&#39;t. I asked him if the third book would be hidden or <br/>
not, and he said, that he didn&#39;t know. Also, he said that it will be put in <br/>
the patch info when tinkering is fixed, so we will know. I also asked him if <br/>
they will be working more on tinkering, and he said quite possibly so.<br/>
<br/>
There you have it. The truth. The REAL truth. I blelive this GM is to be <br/>
trusted. He dosn&#39;t lie, and he knew what he was talking about right away. <br/>
We&#39;ll just have to wait till we see that they&#39;ve fixed it till we look any <br/>
further.<br/>
