I&#39;m Really excited to here some people are successfully tinkering.  I&#39;ve just<br/>
reached level 9 myself, and finished buying all the 3rd circle spells that I<br/>
need.  Tinkering is now my next goal.  I have a few questions though. At what<br/>
level will your tinkering skills improve.  I haven&#39;t been back to my homeland<br/>
in a while and I was wondering how much the toolkit and the first book cost.<br/>

&gt; Ok, so after the solution for Firewater was given<br/>
&gt; to me, I tried Tinkering the stuff, simple. Worked<br/>
&gt; every time. Then I tried the only item that I could afford and tada, the<br/>
&gt; first(in the game I think) Flameless Lantern (gave it away) then two<br/>
&gt; failures. But all in all I made 3. They seem to be<br/>
&gt; at least as bright as Lightstone, possibly brighter, but being a Gnome, what<br/>
&gt; do I need it for? :) But it&#39;s been done. Tinkering works.<br/>
&gt; Going to put in my order for Pie Tins and start<br/>
&gt; making Compasses. And as soon as I find a tattered<br/>
&gt; cloak, it&#39;s Thermal Cloak time. Man I need more money.<br/>
