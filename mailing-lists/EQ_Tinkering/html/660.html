<b>Subject:</b> Tinkering skill increase <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930998550">I would not feel so bad if I were not 29 and been tinkering since I was 20.<br/>
Through the levels I have made a BUNCH of lanterns, 2 lockpicks (no buyers<br/>
;), over 16 compasses (gave away), and 9 Cams.  I have not had my skill<br/>
increase even one point (checked it out at guild).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at a loss what do to, sent in bug report after bug report, but nothing<br/>
from them.<br/>

Research for Casters works the same way.  If so, Tinkering becomes more like<br/>
fishing, begging, and research (in that it has a level cap) than like the<br/>
other<br/>
&quot;Trade&quot; skills - Tailoring, baking, pottery, etc.  This makes no sense and<br/>
(again, if true) may be a bug.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I made 8 Cams in a row with out anything.. not counting the two lockpicks<br/>
&gt; &gt;and about 40 - 50 lanterns.  Told a guide I was bugged, told me to stop<br/>
&gt; &gt;bugging him.. sigh...<br/>

&gt; It seems to me that it depends greatly on your experience level.  At level<br/>
&gt; 27 I was only able to raise tinkering to 60.  The skill does not take<br/>
