<div id="ygrps-yiv-997431609">Man.. they should have just made it a quest item.  Go up that gnome <br/>
merchant and hail him...<br/>

Hello there! I haven&#39;t seen you around these parts have I? We don&#39;t get <br/>
many visitors around here.. must be the goblins that scare people <br/>
away.  They aren&#39;t the greatest fellows but at least you can trade with <br/>
them.  There&#39;s this one that sells cloaks that they make.. Rather nice <br/>
fitting on us gnomes.  I would love to have one to replace this [tattered <br/>
gnomish cloak].<br/>
<br/>
/say What tattered gnomish cloak?<br/>
<br/>
/say What cloak? This old rag hanging off my back.  The goblin that sells <br/>
them will only barter with people.. He has a liking for Ogre heads for some <br/>
reason.. I think they like to eat them.  Tell you what, you bring an Ogre&#39;s <br/>
Head I&#39;ll give you one of us gnome&#39;s old cloak.. they&#39;re in decent shape, <br/>
better than some old Ogre&#39;s head for sure.. sound like a deal?<br/>
<br/>
So you run out to OOT... whack one of them Ogres and take the head.  You <br/>
can get two heads per trip (two ogres and they heads are lore, but they are <br/>
different heads).  Much better than going in there an whacking <br/>
clockworks.  Geez.  This isn&#39;t a very good quest example, but it certainly <br/>
proves that if they spent 10 minutes they could come up with a lame quest <br/>
like this.. what if they spent an hour?  Could probably do something decent.<br/>
