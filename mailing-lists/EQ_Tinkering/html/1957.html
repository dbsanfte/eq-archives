<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970381462">About selling Cams and Fireworks...<br/>
<br/>
At first I had trouble selling Cams (I haven&#39;t really tried anything else<br/>
yet &#39;cause my skill isn&#39;t high enough and I run out of money), but lately<br/>
I&#39;ve been able to sell all I could make and even have trouble keeping them<br/>
in stock.  (I blew all my money on my lvl 24 spells)  I&#39;m not really making<br/>
money on the skill yet though.  I am hoping that changes with spyglasses.<br/>
<br/>
I have had wonderful success selling one cam for 20pp or two for 35pp.  What<br/>
is everyone else&#39;s price point on these?  At 40pp for two cams, there aren&#39;t<br/>
as many people that want to buy.<br/>
<br/>
Fireworks have been a big hit.  I even have people I&#39;ve never met asking me<br/>
to make them.  I&#39;ve sold them for 1pp for the 4 pieces you get with each<br/>
attempt.  I even made 12 fireworks (48 pieces) for someone once for 25pp!<br/>
It&#39;s kind of a pain to get the bat wings (there is a vendor in ECommons) but<br/>
they seem to sell well.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my usual speil... (if you are on Bertoxxulous you can&#39;t steal this<br/>
:-P )<br/>
<br/>
/auction Attention Fletchers: Tinkered Bow Cams.  Half the price of the<br/>
vendors!  Make a two cam bow for the cost of a one cam bow!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps someone.<br/>
