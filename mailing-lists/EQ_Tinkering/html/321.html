<div id="ygrps-yiv-602509526">Well one of my guild members offered me 50 pp for the pole, he is a lvl 40 pala. And the reason he offered me this is because he fishs a lot and finds it annoying when the poles snap. He has heard a rumor that collapsable poles dont break. Anyway i regretted informing him, that i cant make one :(<br/>

I think the fishing pole itself is a bit useless.  So it&#39;s lighter and can <br/>
be placed in a small bag, not too thrilling.<br/>
The real value comes from using the pole to make the spyglasses, unlimited <br/>
charges of telescopic sight.<br/>

+AD4APg-I guess I&#39;m just a little curious as to why we think the collapsable <br/>
+AD4APg-fishing pole will be so profitable?  Is it the pole itself?  Or the <br/>
+AD4APg-potential to make the spyglass?  Just a little curious.<br/>
