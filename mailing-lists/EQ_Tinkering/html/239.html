<div id="ygrps-yiv-310120113">The lens that Borxx drops is a +ACI-evil eye lens+ACI- it has one charge of sight or something like that.. one of those spells that zooms your vision in cant remember exacly. It has NOTHING to do with the telescope lens quest, hence the difference- Evil eye lens VS. Telescope lens... And a note on someone elses post: the telescope quest does NOT give the observer staff when completed.. that is without a doubt factual information+ACE- The only quest that is rewarded with the observer staff is the Borxx quest given by the female enchanter way out behind the windmills in one of the houses. And yet another side note: on my server the observer staff is and has been bugged for some time... it is supposed to have 50 charges of Sentinal, which it does when first recieved but after you log and come back on, it is reduced to one charge. I was told not to use the charge and that it will be fixed, but that was over a month ago. :)<br/>

hmm, pretty sure Borxx&#39;s lens is one of them, you re supposed to get one<br/>
+AD4AIg-free+ACI- (the one in LF I believe) than one is one the gnome taken<br/>
prisoner by Minotaurs, and one was stolen by a dark elf, and the only<br/>
other lens I have heard about is the Borxx lens (at least this is what<br/>
they respond when asked about spare lens&#39;s)<br/>
 Maybe I missed one, if so please tell me which one.<br/>

+AD4APg- While I agree that Verant is sick +ACY- twisted, you are confusing two quests.  The Evil<br/>
+AD4APg- Eye is part of the Observer Staff Quest and originates at an Observitory.  The<br/>
+AD4APg- Telescope Lens Quest orignates in the Wizards? Guild and it requires you to get four<br/>
+AD4APg- lenses.  None of them are on Borxx.  Two are given to you by the observitories.  One<br/>
+AD4APg- is obtained by killing a 14ish (and nasty) DE in Freeport, and the last is on this<br/>
+AD4APg- missing gnome.  Please also note that this quest will not be given to wizards above<br/>
+AD4APg- level 12.<br/>
+AD4APg- <br/>
+AD4APg-  Believe it , verant has this sick and twisted thing about making quests<br/>
+AD4APg-  ungettable at higher levels, and impossible for low levels to actually<br/>
+AD4APg-  solve, for instance this quest. one of the lens you need tog et from<br/>
+AD4APg-  Borxx, a level +ACo-30+ACo- Evil Eye. With verants normal sense of rewards well<br/>
+AD4APg-  get 20 exp pts, a faction adjustment and a tarnished dagger as reward,<br/>
+AD4APg-  note this is a step up from the usual rusty dagger they give us.<br/>
+AD4APg-   another example (again gnome) get tergons spellbook, OK this spawns on<br/>
+AD4APg-  a level 18 or so mob... your reward for solving the quest? a level 4<br/>
+AD4APg-  mage spell.<br/>
