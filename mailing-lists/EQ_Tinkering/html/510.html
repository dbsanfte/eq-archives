<div id="ygrps-yiv-442646140">The four trade skills messages you can get (that I know of at least hehe):<br/>
<br/>
-You have fashioned the items together to create something new!<br/>
<br/>
Made a new item<br/>
<br/>
-You lacked the skills to fashion the items together.<br/>
<br/>
Failed making the item but the components and quantities you used were<br/>
correct.<br/>
<br/>
-These items don&#39;t combine in these quantities to produce anything.<br/>
<br/>
Wrong formula or quantities, remember not to stack components that are<br/>
stackable such as water.<br/>
<br/>
-You have fashioned the items together to create an alternate product.<br/>
<br/>
You failed making an item but the game gives you back 1 or more of the<br/>
components you used.<br/>
