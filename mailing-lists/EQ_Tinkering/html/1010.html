<b>Subject:</b> Level CAP for tinkering. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-906692452">From my reading many posts (ever since before Gnomad)brought up his great <br/>
page.  I have seen and read and watch everything.<br/>
<br/>
My conclusions on Level CAP for tinkering skill is as follow:<br/>
<br/>
It has the same exact scheme and Spell Caster Research...<br/>
<br/>
it start at 16 (the same)..you can only get 1 level of skill up at 16th.<br/>
<br/>
On research, I could not TRAIN anymore point until I hit 20th.<br/>
<br/>
Seem to the same with all the tinkering story.<br/>
<br/>
Once you hit 20th, you could train 5 points...and every level 5 more <br/>
points...(or was it every 4 levels)..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, from what I read, what happened seem to conform with my theory.<br/>
<br/>
What is you guys feedback?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the info.  (all in the list..yes even joshua.)<br/>
