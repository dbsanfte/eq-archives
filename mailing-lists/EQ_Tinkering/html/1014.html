<div id="ygrps-yiv-717696590">the programmers know very well that the fireworks don&#39;t work, that&#39;s why<br/>
they removed the book from the game<br/>
bugging them about it will probably just result in them removing the shaft<br/>
from the game because fixing the fireworks is at the VERY bottom of the to<br/>
do list, even lower than creating some kind of itch relieving cream for ogre<br/>

&gt;  Today I also made gnomish fireworks. I was a little pissed that they<br/>
&gt; totally suck so I petitioned a GM. He went ahead and summoned the items to<br/>

&gt; out was &quot;That totally sucked! I shall see to it that the game developers<br/>

&gt; Maybe they will feel sorry for us little old gnomes and decide to make the<br/>
&gt; fireworks look better. The more petitions they get, the better the chances<br/>
&gt; of that happening. I&#39;m crossing my fingers.<br/>
