<b>Subject:</b> More clues from Lindell, third book confirmed, and more... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084664288">I talked to Lindell again. He doesn&#39;t seem to want to tell me out-right, but <br/>
he was willing to tell me a little more, sort of. First of all, he confirmed <br/>
that the thing I was looking for truly WAS a third tinkering book. He also <br/>
said that to get it involed going under water. He also said that it was <br/>
somewhere you wouldn&#39;t expact it to be. He also said that is was NOT in <br/>
Ak&#39;Anon, that looking there was a waste of time. He also confirmed that it <br/>
wasn&#39;t is Kedge&#39;s Keep. He said that the person to first find it stummbled <br/>
upon it by luck, so if we are actually looking for it we should be able to <br/>
find it. Lindell also told me if I find the book, I can join The Mark. Well, <br/>
sorry, I don&#39;t want to join those people, they are with holding info from <br/>
everyone else like that, so if I find it, I&#39;m gonigto let everyone know <br/>
about it, not join they&#39;re group. They want to keep it secret, but I have <br/>
absolutely NO affiliation to them, and don&#39;t want to keep it secrect, so why <br/>
would I want to join them? First of all, they won&#39;t let me join because I&#39;m <br/>
not worthy to them, plus if they had their way, I, or no one else would find <br/>
that book ever, and they would probably do anything in their power to stop <br/>
me from getting it, and they sort of have, but then, if I found it, since <br/>
they still want to keep it secret, they want me to join them, even after <br/>
what they&#39;ve acted like?! No way! I don&#39;t think so!<br/>
<br/>
Hahaha! Let&#39;s show them! Let&#39;s all re-double our efforts to find the book!!! <br/>
Come on, guys! Let&#39;s go get it! Good luck to you all!</div>
