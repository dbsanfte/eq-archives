<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147559763">Hi<br/>
There certainly seem to be nothing wrong with the will<br/>
for exploration among us gnomes. This is as it should<br/>
be, gnomes ARE the most curious race of Norrath.<br/>
 <br/>
Now, a fact is also that we are among the fewest in<br/>
numbers of all races, and not all of us do even bother<br/>
to tinker. <br/>
What I have been pondering about is a way to spread<br/>
the word about what we are searching for. This way we<br/>
may find our treasures and get to our conclusions<br/>
earlier.<br/>
 <br/>
What if Fulcrum or some other spokesperson among us<br/>
posted it on EQvault, Stratics, Allakhazam, Everlore,<br/>
EQlizer and so on, that we are searching for tattered<br/>
gnomish cloaks and diamond dust. We may even put out a<br/>
reward for it.<br/>
Please tell me what you think about it.<br/>
<br/>
(Perhaps we should wait till a few days after the<br/>
patch, in case Mr.Knotwood suddenly supports diamond<br/>
dust).<br/>
