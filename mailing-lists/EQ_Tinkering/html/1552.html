<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089214539">Ok has anyone actually seen a tattered cloak or is it a pipe dream...<br/>
I spent 2 hrs last night tying for the cloak red 5 quest didn&#39;t work<br/>
and i didn&#39;t think it would but ohh well. The other option was the orcs<br/>
in butcher block and lesser fay that supposidly drop it following up on <br/>
this tommorrow. we should do a list on known failures i agree:) Btw has<br/>
anyone heard anything about a bomb that we can make that does 60dmg? <br/>
There was talk of fireworks and big bumba from a gnome site my friend saw<br/>
combine all 4 works and bomb is made.... doesn&#39;t work of course. Could be<br/>
a dream but worth a shot. I will update on the cloak quest i am on hehe.:)<br/>
