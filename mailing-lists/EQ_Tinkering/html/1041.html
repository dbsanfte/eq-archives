<b>Subject:</b> My thought on how the guy got the book... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994441188">Now I&#39;m not saying anyone is a cheater but... If you have all these people<br/>
looking for the book and it can&#39;t be found its most likely not in the game yet.<br/>
<br/>
As you may of heard people have been working on an eq emu. <br/>
And as you may have known there is a command to summon items, each item has<br/>
a number. some people where summoning items starting from 0001 or soemthing<br/>
and working their way up. Baiscly I think that someone was summoning items<br/>
and ran across the book. And blam history is made.<br/>
<br/>
It would explaine why the person hasn&#39;t said where the book its and/or how<br/>
to get it.<br/>
