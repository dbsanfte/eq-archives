<b>Subject:</b> To the programmer in charge of trade skills <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115491203">a few simple questions.<br/>
<br/>
1) Is there a third tinkering book on the normal servers?<br/>
2) Are there recipes available that are not in the 2 books by the windmill?<br/>
3) Are you planning on enhancing this skill in the near future?  The Distant<br/>
future?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions for us.  We are a group<br/>
of dedicated tinkerers who have been chasing our tails for several months now,<br/>
and we are all getting pretty frustrated.  Several of us have had numerous<br/>
conversations with different GM&#39;s.  Some have said the skill was broken, others<br/>
have said that it works perfectly.  If you could shed some light on this<br/>
subject we would all greatly appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You Again<br/>
