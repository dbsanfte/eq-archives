<div id="ygrps-yiv-794225661">hello guys. just wanted to say hi & all. i have been reading this list for a<br/>
longtime now. i never really tinkered cuz i went so broke doing it & didnt<br/>
even get one point of a skill up. =) glad to see that we are able to make<br/>
new things now. gonna try tinkering again as soon as i can get some more<br/>
cash in.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if anyone wants to setup a party on The Rathe. My gnome guildies & I<br/>
will donate to the Gnome cause. I beat if we spread the word around we can<br/>
get lots of Gnomes together.<br/>

Best of luck to all me Gnome Brethens,<br/>
