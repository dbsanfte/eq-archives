<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568454132">Down in the caves is the necroguild.  They don&#39;t talk even if you like<br/>
them.  They are guildmasters and there are 3 there.  If you tried to<br/>
kill him you would prolly get hit for around 1000 damage in one round.<br/>
Deeper in the caves there are other NPCs that you could possibly talk<br/>
to. They all have killed me in the past, since I am a necro and they<br/>
don&#39;t seem to like us very much.<br/>
