<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003200701"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I wish whoever had the book would just post the recipies.  Why do they have<br/>
&gt;to keep it secret?  Is it an ego thing?  Is it greed because they think<br/>
&gt;they will make a million plat from the formula&#39;s?<br/>

spyglass.  In my travels, I have never seen anyone request the aid of a <br/>
caster who could use glimpse or whatever.  Fireworks would be great from a <br/>
roleplaying perspective, but the market for it will be erratic at best, and <br/>
they may not be very cheap to make.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this isn&#39;t to discourage anyone from pursuing tinkering in any way.  <br/>
I would think it neat to show off fireworks sometime or use the spyglass for <br/>
my solo explorations.  But I don&#39;t expect a profit from it.  Obviously, <br/>
neither do these other people who seem to know the formula, because we have <br/>
no reports of large amounts of people owning either a spyglass or fireworks.<br/>
