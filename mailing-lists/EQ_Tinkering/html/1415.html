<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949691153">I am planning a revolt of sorts on The Innoruuk server after the patch on Dec 1st if they do not remove the tinkering cap.  I have gotten about 6 guilds so far to help me with this, we are all going to petition that the cap should be removed at the same time with anyone who doesn&#39;t have a clue having the Guide/Gm refer to me.  If anyone else wanted to join in on the fun please do I will have a<br/>
better idea what time next week<br/>
