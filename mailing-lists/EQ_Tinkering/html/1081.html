<div id="ygrps-yiv-494802847">I don&#39;t think the book is very high level, I just have very serious doubt<br/>
that it is.<br/>
<br/>
All of the recipies in it are very simple and easy to do and require<br/>
minimal tinkering skill, but what confuses me is that those gnomes, even in<br/>
light of the third book being posted, are still refusing to share info, and<br/>
are still trying to exort extremely high prices for things.  I guess its a<br/>
greed thing...<br/>
<br/>
At anyrate, doesn&#39;t it make sense that gnomes who won&#39;t tell you recipies<br/>
will also lie to you about how they came about the third book?<br/>
