<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176553021">It had an axe graphic I was there and he charmed him maybe a week ago, weekend<br/>
sometime.  The person who looted it never mentioned it not being the exe axe and<br/>
this is the first time I have ever heard of a critter not having a graphic for a<br/>
weapon it has, it was also my second time in lower guk.  As for the pet thing it<br/>
may have been a fluke I don&#39;t know as I don&#39;t play anything that uses pets so I<br/>
can&#39;t tell you, but I did clearly see from the executioner &quot;guarding with my<br/>
life oh splendid one&quot; Mersinaz even laughed because we didn&#39;t know what he was<br/>
doing at first.  AND WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO INSULT ME AT LEAST GET THE NAME<br/>
SPELLED RIGHT!!!!   As for the pets I am pretty sure the guy who has the<br/>
information attained it though illegal methods because he seems very greasy and<br/>
probably won&#39;t ever tell me but I am gonna try and when I get it the person who<br/>
doubted me doesn&#39;t have to use it<br/>
