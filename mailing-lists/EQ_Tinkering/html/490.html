<b>Subject:</b> the fishing pole dilema <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-590564952">I am an aspiring tinkerer and have just joined this mailing list.  I was <br/>
just writing to share my opinion that the collapsible fishing pole can not <br/>
be tinkered.  I say this based on a couple of things.  In the gimblestan <br/>
books all the things mentioned that are tinkerable are listed with their <br/>
component pieces.  This is pretty straightforward.  There is no mention of <br/>
infravision goggles or gnomish fireworks in either of the gimblestan books.  <br/>
These were probably in beta but taken out of the game.  The fact that the <br/>
fidshing pole is mentioned does not mean it can be tinkered.  It was <br/>
mentioned in the same context as a cork, or a pie tin, or a static orb etc.  <br/>
It is mentioned as a component, not as a project.  That is why i think that <br/>
a recipe will not be forund.  I don&#39;t think it can be made (at least not at <br/>
this point in time).  Gnomad had a collapse pole that someone gave him after <br/>
they won a GM quest.  To my knowledge no one has ever seen a collapsible <br/>
pole dropped as a loot item or in any store anywhere.  THIS is what leads <br/>
people to think it can be tinkered.  It sounds like something we should be <br/>
able to tinker, but I believe this is not the case.  Maybe the pole was <br/>
meant to be sold in shops as a component but never made it there.  I think <br/>
that it may be the case that poles can only be obtained by being given them <br/>
from a GM.  That or there is a quest somewhere that returns one.  I just <br/>
don&#39;t think the pole is an item we can make, because there is no recipe for <br/>
it anywhere.  Something that could use infinate combinations of components <br/>
to make would have some kind of clue in-game.  That is just my humble <br/>
opinion.  I admit, there could very well be a recipe for it out there, but I <br/>
think with the sheer mathmatics of trying combinations we will just be <br/>
chasing our tails until verant thows us a clue.  I mean, pie tins are <br/>
mentioned in gimblestan MORE than the fishing pole is.  Can we take the fact <br/>
that it is mentioned as a component for another item to mean that we can <br/>
tinker them?  I&#39;m not so sure about that.  On a side note i made an <br/>
uneventful trip to the ak&#39;anon zoo and talked the ear off the zookeeper, but <br/>
couldn&#39;t get him to say anything other than the generic &quot;I am the zookeeper, <br/>
yada yada&quot; speach.  I tried asking about gimblestan, the old zookeeper and <br/>
&quot;binky&quot; the minotaur.  I can only assume that is the same mino gimblestan <br/>
captured.  Not sure tho.  Anyone get the zookeeper to say anything at all <br/>
other than the generic yada yada speach?  If so post it her please!<br/>
