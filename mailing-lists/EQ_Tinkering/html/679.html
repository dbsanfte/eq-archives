<div id="ygrps-yiv-272864645">If all you want to do is check something out that any level 1 shaman<br/>
barbarian can do, then why haven&#39;t you checked it out already ? You&#39;ve had<br/>
plenty of time since you sent your first message, but instead of verifying<br/>
your information that is SO important to our group here, you&#39;re just sitting<br/>
there watching our replies to your original message. Either check it out or<br/>
tell us so we can. IF you have any info, that is...<br/>
<br/>
Yours doubtfully,<br/>

&gt; Why do you all act like this? I try to help, but you decline it. If what<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; want is for me to truly leave with my information, then that is what I<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; do. I will leave the choice up to you. I&#39;m trying to apologize by helping,<br/>
&gt; but you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; out here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What I<br/>
&gt; have to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just want<br/>
&gt; to check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all hate<br/>
&gt; me so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because<br/>
&gt; you think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all<br/>
&gt; with out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; or decline it.<br/>
