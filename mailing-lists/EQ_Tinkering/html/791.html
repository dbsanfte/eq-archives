<div id="ygrps-yiv-342455573">Here here! Bravo! Couldn&#39;t have said it better myself. I too am going to <br/>
make an expedition there, and, as soon as I can get to level 20 (because of <br/>
the sharks and other powerful things) I&#39;m going to borrow a fishbone earring <br/>
from a guild member and search the ocean floor. The earring gives unlimited <br/>
breath, so I won&#39;t need to come up for air.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;A little bird told me.<br/>
&gt;If anyone would think about it...from every lie to every truth I have ever<br/>
&gt;heard, the one thing that is constant is that we should &quot;search beneath the<br/>
&gt;waves&quot;. Think about the story behind things. If I have learned anything <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;playing EverQuest for all of these months, I have learned that Verant and<br/>
&gt;the programmers love a good story. They love to flesh things out, why else<br/>
&gt;would so many of these quests be long and drawn out. Think of the story<br/>
&gt;behind the cave ad the necro there, he is supposed to be banished there by<br/>
&gt;the gods in a huge epic tale, not because of some measly tinkering book. As<br/>
&gt;well with the spelunker fer one thing he is NOT beneath the waves. I dont<br/>
&gt;know what the story behind him is but come on if it were that easy do you<br/>
&gt;not think someone has tried that by now? NO our answer does lie in the<br/>
&gt;realms of the submerged, no probably not kedge keep as it is not itemized.<br/>
&gt;Has anyone ever heard someone say anything about the battle they ad against<br/>
&gt;sea serpents? Probably not. Why? because no one as explored the depths. No<br/>
&gt;one has spent an entire month drudging the ocean floors. Maybe one or two<br/>
&gt;people were masicistic enough or maybe just bored enough to one day decide<br/>
&gt;to go hunt the oceans for things maybe they fell off a boat and <br/>
&gt;accidentally<br/>
&gt;caught a glimpse of something that changed everything. Maybe its in lake<br/>
&gt;rathe, mayvbe its in the ocean of tears, maybe its in erud&#39;s crossing, I<br/>
&gt;dont know but if anywere these are the three likely places.<br/>
&gt;I have heard multiple rumors of a secret cave on erollisi island wher you<br/>
&gt;push a button and hear some grinding. I have yet to find this button but it<br/>
&gt;has been said enough to me to get some of my attention. Im planning an<br/>
&gt;expedidtion on the bertoxxulous server for this next weekend to go to the<br/>
&gt;ocean of tears and to comb the ocean floor if i have to but if its there to<br/>
&gt;find i will find it. Subsequest trips will be to erud&#39;s crossing and lake<br/>
&gt;rathe but for now my hopes and my ideas are drawing me to the ocean of<br/>
&gt;tears. Start your own expeditions. With enough people looking for it it <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;be found and the secrets of tinkering will belong to us all!<br/>
