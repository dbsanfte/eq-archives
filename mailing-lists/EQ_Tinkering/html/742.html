<div id="ygrps-yiv-185324718">Yes, it IS possible. I went to Halas through level 15 through 18, and I <br/>
learned alot about it. I think there is a high level gnome necromancer under <br/>
the frozen river in Everfrost, but he attackes everyone on site. He has a <br/>
few skellie cronies too. I never saw him for myself, so it may not be true.<br/>

&gt;If the clue was to look below waves, and before it was stated that a<br/>
&gt;Barbarian Shaman would do the exploring, what about the lake outside of<br/>
&gt;Halas?  Has that already been brought up?  If need be, I can take my<br/>
&gt;Magician up there and poke around?<br/>
