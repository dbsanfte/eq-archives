<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138891015">That is correct.  The effect is limited to speeded up attack speed.<br/>
Movement rate is identical.  While it is stackable with alacrity, it&#39;s not<br/>
usually wise for an enchanter to go around trying to be a tank at level 44+<br/>
given what most MOBs hit for at that range (and how few HP enchanters have).<br/>
Better to illusion:troll and get the increased regen since by the time an<br/>
enchanter manages to kill something with physical attacks, he&#39;ll probably<br/>
have taken enough damage to kill him 10 times over.<br/>

I don&#39;t believe illusion werewolf has a saw effect.  It does however<br/>
increase<br/>
your attack rate, and is stackable with the Alcracity line of spells</div>
