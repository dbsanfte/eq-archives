<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340467618">You have a beta account that you&#39;re not using?!?  I&#39;d be happy to take that<br/>
off your hands, as I&#39;m having to share my beta account with 3 other people<br/>
:)<br/>

I played a Gnome enchanter on RZ, and so far it seems like there are some<br/>
similarities in DaoC, but the enchanter class is nowhere near as<br/>
versatile... the EQ class is spread out over several classes in Camelot.<br/>
I&#39;m actually having the most fun playing a wizard-like character.  Chain<br/>
casting takes on a new level, as you can begin casting a new spell as the<br/>
most recent one is happening.  Excellent game, and I recommend the download.<br/>

&gt;    Yes, you have to unsubscribe yourself. You can&#39;t expect others to do it<br/>
&gt; for you. You did sign yourself up, you know, so you are all certainly able<br/>
&gt; to handle unsubscribing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I got a beta invite on DaoC, but haven&#39;t yet DL&#39;ed it to try it. I will<br/>
&gt; certainly be playing. I was a Female Gnome Warrior on Quellious, and plan<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; play a Lurikeen Champion in DaoC.<br/>
