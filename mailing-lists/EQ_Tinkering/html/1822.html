<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532869247">Sometimes a user takes over an old username, I&#39;ve ran<br/>
Isp&#39;s and seen this. and alas they get old e-mail<br/>
&lt;mailing lists generally&gt; and stuff for the old person<br/>
that had the account. not much you can do about it.<br/>
except to be asked to be removed from the list, and<br/>
inform the others of the account change.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing for a mailing list to do is to add a<br/>
link at the bottom of all e-mails that pass thru with<br/>
a way to unsubscribe. Generally this is considered<br/>
curtious, as people do also forget where they signed<br/>
up at. they now feel the only recourse is to simply<br/>
add the address to there &quot;delete&quot; box automaticly &lt;if<br/>
they even know HOW to do this&gt;<br/>
