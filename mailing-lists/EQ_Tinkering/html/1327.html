supposedly the charges in the aqualung last much<br/>
longer then enduring breath<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And just how are you going to carry 50 enduring<br/>
&gt; breath potions?  hehe sorry<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t mean to be sarcastic here...  Besides I would<br/>
&gt; think that any high<br/>
&gt; level people that wanted to camp cauldronbubble or<br/>
&gt; the king in Kedge would<br/>
&gt; really be interested in these for a few reasons.<br/>
&gt; 1. No need for someone to break out of combat to<br/>
&gt; start recasting enduring<br/>
&gt; breath on the entire party.  Ive been to kedge a few<br/>
&gt; times now, its a pain<br/>
&gt; unless you have multiple persons that can cast EB.<br/>
&gt; 2.  Remember most of your EB casters also have to<br/>
&gt; memorize the stamina<br/>
&gt; spells.  an Aqualung just freed up one of your spell<br/>
&gt; slots.  Humm should I<br/>
&gt; memorize the evac or the enduring breath? :)<br/>
&gt; 3.  Ok so 50 fishscales don&#39;t really take up that<br/>
&gt; much weight, and its only<br/>
&gt; 3 stacks of stuff.  But thats 2 extra stacks that<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t going to be<br/>
&gt; holding loot.  And its also 1,750 mana saved, not<br/>
&gt; including fizzels, which<br/>
&gt; are not possible with the aqualung.<br/>
&gt; 4. Mermaids and seahorses can cast dispell magic. <br/>
&gt; Sure that just means the<br/>
&gt; Druid, Shamen, or Enchanter needs to recast EB on<br/>
&gt; someone in a hurry.  Or<br/>
&gt; they could just click off a charge from the aqualung<br/>
&gt; and keep on trucking.<br/>
&gt; Not many fighters are going to have their mind<br/>
&gt; firmly on the battle at hand<br/>
&gt; if they start running on the air left in their<br/>
&gt; lungs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thats all I could come up with off the top of my<br/>
&gt; head.  As was mentioned in<br/>
&gt; another post, its all how you sell them.  I am<br/>
&gt; getting better at it, and I<br/>
&gt; do offer any persons that purchass an aqualung from<br/>
&gt; me, 50% of their money<br/>
&gt; back if they trade in their aqualung for a<br/>
&gt; rebreather once I am able to<br/>
&gt; make them.  No matter how many charges are<br/>
&gt; remaining.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heh on a side note, if I had been selling<br/>
&gt; rebreathers, I was offered a<br/>
&gt; Yeksha for one till they learned it was the charged<br/>
&gt; version. :)  I added<br/>
&gt; that name to my friends list for when I am crafting<br/>
&gt; rebreathers. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;sorry my friend but for 700 plat anyone can<br/>
&gt; purchase 50 enduring breath<br/>
&gt; potions<br/>
&gt; &gt;i dont really see why anyone would pay that UNLESS<br/>
&gt; as stated earlier we<br/>
&gt; provide<br/>
&gt; &gt;an upgrade to rebreather for a viable cost. i agree<br/>
&gt; with an earlier post <br/>
&gt; &gt;wherein<br/>
&gt; &gt;we gig anyone who wont purchase the aqualung but<br/>
&gt; wants a rebreather and cut <br/>
&gt; &gt;some<br/>
&gt; &gt;slack to those who purchase both. this isnt really<br/>
&gt; a prob for me as im only <br/>
&gt; &gt;in it<br/>
&gt; &gt;to equip my guild and have full backing from them.<br/>
&gt; just an opinion and glad <br/>
&gt; &gt;to hear<br/>
&gt; &gt;the level cap is going to get fixed. you wouldnt<br/>
&gt; believe the amount of cash <br/>
&gt; &gt;i wasted<br/>
&gt; &gt;of the guild treasury trying to raise my skill.<br/>
&gt; well see you all in game.<br/>
