<div id="ygrps-yiv-279360109">Yes, I would also like to know this.  One way I have been trying is freeing <br/>
slaves but it can be time consuming finding keys 18 and 19.  I would <br/>
seriously like to know how to raise faction with them.  Also because I am a <br/>
bowyer in addition those prices could go down if I had good faction.<br/>
