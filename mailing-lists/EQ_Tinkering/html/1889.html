<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261862073">WARNING:<br/>
<br/>
This has nothing to do with tinkering... and since this is the first time <br/>
I&#39;ve spoken out since I last tried to speak out and give the formula for the <br/>
tinkering spellcap I need to speak out on Gazamel&#39;s behalf....Gazamel has <br/>
been a great help in doing things and trying things that the only Lvl 50 <br/>
gnome warrior could I believe she found the diamond and was willing to have <br/>
one of the ogres crush it .. knowing she might lose it... and she eventually <br/>
did. (and there could be another lvl 50 gnome warrior by now.  I to am on the <br/>
solusek ro server with a lvl 30 enchanter a lvl 22 rogue and a lvl 21 druid.  <br/>
Muldoon is quite the deciever and since I promised not to post again after <br/>
being flamed to death I apologize for the post  that I am making no as it has <br/>
nothing to do with actual tinkering.<br/>
<br/>
Currently playing Abunia Matadore<br/>
Rogue of 22 Solusek Ro.</div>
