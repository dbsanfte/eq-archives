<div id="ygrps-yiv-531911373">Ok, if anyone has received a SPARE TELESCOPE LENS, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
So far, I have been able to get only the one off the dark elf in Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
The one that Bidl Frugrin has, well, as we all know, I haven&#39;t found.<br/>
<br/>
The other two from the observatories, well, they keep telling me to come <br/>
back in a few weeks.  Has anyone gotten one from them?  Please let me know how.<br/>
