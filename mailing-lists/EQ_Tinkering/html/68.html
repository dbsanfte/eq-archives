&gt;I read someone finally got their tinkering skill to go up. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;burnt through about 24 plat of Flameless Lanterns and had nothing<br/>
&gt;go up. Anyone know how long it takes? Is it just luck?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My skill is going up quite nicely on lanterns, and they are still not<br/>
trivial.  I&#39;m getting similar increases to when I was trying to get<br/>
blacksmithing up.  Getting that first point sure was a surprise though,<br/>
after having experimented trying to make everything recently it never went<br/>
up.  I&#39;m level 27 BTW so it had nothing to do with not having the<br/>
appropriate level.  Making the lanterns is a bit expensive, however, about<br/>
1pp5gp a pop... you get 8gp or so selling back to vendors.  Will need to do<br/>
some more Sand Giant hunting with my guild to fund this skill :)<br/>
