<b>Subject:</b> Collapsible fishing pole price? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462396780">Has anyone ever offered one of these collapsible fishing poles to an NPC<br/>
merchant to see how much they offered for it?  I know that only a handful of<br/>
people have these things, but I was wondering what they were offering for<br/>
such a specialty item.<br/>
