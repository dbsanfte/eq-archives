<br/>
Thanx for the info, what do you sell your rebreathers for? Only succeeding on 1 out of 3 trys means your looking at a price of 3000+ plat for a rebreather. And thats AFTER you succeed on making 3 aqua lungs =|.<br/>
<br/>
All this may be moot if those Verant Bastards allow the mages to cast a 20th level spell to create water stones. If that is put in the game, I&#39;m thinking it will devastate the tinkering trade unless they put something else in the game for us to make.<br/>
