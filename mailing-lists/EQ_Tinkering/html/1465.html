<b>Subject:</b> Ok, the magician summoned underwater breathing is here, /feedback time <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-727894167">Well, this kinda sucks, after spending a good 8kpp to get my skill to 104, <br/>
and after getting some sponsors to keep tinkering up so that one day I can <br/>
make good money for both me and my sponsors, they instate the magician no <br/>
cost summoned items.<br/>
<br/>
I DO think that there will still be a market for the rebreathers, unlimited <br/>
i-never-have-to-worry-about-underwaterbreathing-with-this items will always <br/>
have a market, its just the aqualung market that died.<br/>
<br/>
I still have LOTS of orders for rebreathers for when i can make em, although <br/>
a price of 2kp is, I think, the highest price tolerable to most parts of the <br/>
market. Which of course, with the failure rate to make these items, will <br/>
make me loose money.<br/>
<br/>
As to tinkered pets, i dont think they can be made. I heard rumors on <br/>
diamond dust beeing found in Kaladim, but I checked every merchant i could <br/>
find, no luck.<br/>
<br/>
Also, i would like to know if anyone was albe to find the coral mesh from <br/>
sharks in oot still. I mean, this guy that didnt want to share his info <br/>
would of course say they dont drop anymore to keep em for himself if he <br/>
accidentaly dropped that info..  I&#39;ll check it out myself too.<br/>
