<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537599662">the thing is you&#39;re not giving us any information. you&#39;re just telling us<br/>
that you have it and that doesn&#39;t help us at all. why don&#39;t you tell us what<br/>
your idea is and some of us will look while you level. if it doesn&#39;t work<br/>
out that&#39;s fine, there have been lots of ideas here that haven&#39;t worked out.<br/>
but by continuously telling us that you have info, even though you&#39;re<br/>
appologizing, is like walking up to someone and repeatedly kicking them in<br/>
the shin and saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m kicking you in the shin, I promise I&#39;ll<br/>
stop soon and when I do we&#39;ll both be better off, trust me&quot;<br/>

&gt; Why do you all act like this? I try to help, but you decline it. If what<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; want is for me to truly leave with my information, then that is what I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>will<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do. I will leave the choice up to you. I&#39;m trying to apologize by helping,<br/>
&gt; but you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; out here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What I<br/>
&gt; have to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just want<br/>
&gt; to check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all hate<br/>
&gt; me so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because<br/>
&gt; you think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all<br/>
&gt; with out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; or decline it.<br/>
