Lets see just how bad 1000pp per Aqualung is shall we?<br/>
<br/>
OK first, the base cost to tinker it, assuming the following:<br/>
1) No Failures<br/>
2) Maximum Charisma<br/>
3) Absolutely no money invested to get skill high enough to tinker them<br/>
<br/>
209pp 4g 7s 4c (We&#39;ll round it to 200pp for easy figuring)<br/>
<br/>
Now, lets assume for the sake of arguement that you have max charisma so<br/>
that doesn&#39;t factor into this.<br/>
<br/>
At a failure rate of 10% on the Aqualungs, the price goes to 222pp<br/>
At 20% cost is 250pp<br/>
At 30% cost is 285pp<br/>
At 40% cost is 333pp<br/>
At 50% cost is 400pp<br/>
<br/>
Now, I know that from my experiences, it has cost me roughly 5000pp getting<br/>
to 100 skill, but I have wasted some due to the level limit being unknown to<br/>
me, and I would guess that amount to be roughly 1500pp, so I have spent to<br/>
date, 3500pp getting to the point where I can make these things.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take a small percentage of failure, 30% (which is not unreasonable,<br/>
and I venture to guess if you tracked your failures, you would find this to<br/>
be low to average).  At 30% failure rating cost to make the Aqualung is<br/>
285pp or roughly 300pp.  So for selling them at 1000pp, you make about 700pp<br/>
profit per aqualung, and after 5 I would be at the break even point.<br/>
Everything after that is profit or money that will be reinvested in the<br/>
future to get the skill necessary to tackle the Rebreathers.<br/>
<br/>
Now Askur also said that he would be giving them a discount equal to 50% of<br/>
the cost of the Aqualung to his return customers.  That&#39;s 500pp per return<br/>
customer, which lowers his profit to 200pp per Aqualung, and now he would<br/>
have to sell 18 of these to break even on his original investment.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you are willing to sell them so low, you might want to start keeping<br/>
better track of your failure rates on these items, and not belittle the<br/>
business practices of others.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think he&#39;s doing it right, he insures return customers and is<br/>
giving them a good deal to boot.  I did the very same thing on bows.. I<br/>
would charge roughly 2 to 2.5 times my cost on the bow, and offer them a<br/>
discount for turning in their old bows for an upgrade, and I have a huge<br/>
number of customers returning to me, and they are constantly referring<br/>
people to me for their bows.  I get /tells from people I have never heard of<br/>
all the time, saying &quot;So-an-so told me to get my bow from you, can you make<br/>
blah blah blah&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion, and it&#39;s worth what you are paying for it.<br/>

thank ye kindly for insulting my intelligence.  paying 1k for a<br/>
Lung....congratulations on fooling the masses.  personnaly i think it is<br/>
taking advantage of ppl.  the return i get far outweighs my expenses, and i<br/>
am selling them faster than i can make em.  as for all gnomes who sell<br/>
scopes for 100 plat...HAHAHA. wow, you must find the stupidest ppl in the<br/>
world to pull that scam off.  personally, i am kind of disgusted that so<br/>
many ppl here are so greedy. i have never before been disgusted to be a<br/>
gnome...but there is a first time for everything i guess.<br/>

&gt;I dont know what the hell you outhers do but i think you need an marketing<br/>
&gt;department.  I would never ever selll a aqua lung for 400 pp, thats just<br/>
&gt;insane and plain stupid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;900-1000 pp for it is fair i think  and   with a note with it that if they<br/>
&gt;come back for an uppgrade to Rebreather for say 1000 more + componet cost.<br/>
&gt;That would be around 1600 pp i think, is that right ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I dont sell the fishing pole and those outher low skill items outher if<br/>
&gt;anyone order it, i get to many failures even  on trivial items to be worth<br/>
&gt;making them and selling them at a large scale. Take Bow cam�s for example,<br/>
&gt;i gor an order of 8 cam�s it took 12 tries to make 8, thats 4 failures and<br/>
&gt;i sold them for 25 pp each, it�s almost nno profit at all so     in the<br/>
&gt;futare i�m going to charge 30 pp for them i think if i even sell them.<br/>
