<div id="ygrps-yiv-818257763">I think what Tinkers charge is fine for the crap they have to put up with and <br/>
go through to make these . Also they should charge double or triple the price <br/>
 to scorners of their prices if they change their puny minds and want the <br/>
items. He He He.........I Just say if you dont like the prices ,then just <br/>
don&#39;t  buy the items and be off with it...Don&#39;t whine on here like some baby <br/>
and go away mad....Just go away!  I heard too much complainers of tinkered <br/>
stuff who are just cheap skates!  <br/>
