Quite honestly its was your usage of the word &quot;Greed&quot; when refering to<br/>
others and &quot;Honest&quot; when refering to yourself that sparked my rant<br/>
<br/>
The implication there is clearly that you are the good guy here and all<br/>
others selling for more profit are the bad guys.  Had you worded it<br/>
differentlty, I might never have responded.  I would venture to guess that<br/>
Greed also plays an important part in YOUR costs as well (interesting how<br/>
you leave yourself out of your statement when you say &quot;Admit it or not,<br/>
greed has and will play a BIG part of your sales i presume&quot;), what is it<br/>
that plays a BIG part in your sales?<br/>
<br/>
Get off your moral high horse Ranth<br/>

where to start...where to start...ok. First off...whoever stated to &quot;not<br/>
care what others sell them for,&quot; well, that is a GREAT idea, so why dont we<br/>
all just follow it?  This whole argument started because some smart-ass<br/>
attacked my post of how i sold Lungs.  Therefore i felt i had to defend<br/>
myself.  Admit it or not, greed has and will play a BIG part of your sales i<br/>
presume...if you are such good buisnessmen/women that you all say you are<br/>
then you will not have any trouble selling these.  Good for you. i really<br/>
dont care.  This board is meant for tinkering, so lets keep it at that.  No,<br/>
i am not ashamed for posting my last post, as everything i stated is true.<br/>
As for the buisness side of things, you may be making more money than i am,<br/>
but i still have a net profit, and my skill has gone up a lot, and MOST<br/>
importantly, i have a VERY loyal customer base. So before you jump on the<br/>
bandwagon to attack a perfect stranger, why dont you take a look at<br/>
yourselves first.  last night i sold 8 lungs, think you an do better? net<br/>
profit: 1400plat ( after replenishing my stock).<br/>
this is my style of buisness, it is working rather splendidly for me, so why<br/>
do you care?<br/>
