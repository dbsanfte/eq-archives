<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246683528">Oh, well thats ok. I&#39;m not going to say anything more, not about tinkering, <br/>
or about the third book of anything, not even my opinions. I just quit <br/>
EverQuest, so I don&#39;t care anymore. I&#39;m sad about never being able to see <br/>
the golden age of tinkering, but maybe I&#39;ll stay subscrabed to this list to <br/>
hear about it, since I won&#39;t ever witness it first hand...*sigh* tood bad. <br/>
Oh well....good luck, hope you all master it and make all of the money off <br/>
of it before it becomes just another &quot;blacksmithing&quot; if you know what I <br/>
mean.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I&#39;ve read all your messages since I got on this list, and so far nothing <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;have stated has come from any of the game designers, programmers, or<br/>
&gt;developers.  I remember your rotten letter before you supposedly quit, I <br/>
&gt;read<br/>
&gt;your apology and promise to provide information in the future, and I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;read<br/>
&gt;you flaming other people for being down on you and I never said a thing <br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt;any of it until now...because now you are making these absolute and <br/>
&gt;unequivocal<br/>
&gt;statments about how there is no 3rd book etc. and I&#39;m simply not going to<br/>
&gt;believe it just because you say it.  Nor am I going to believe it because <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;say that some GM says it, and the reason for that is because we have <br/>
&gt;already<br/>
&gt;gotten conflicting statements from GMs!  One says tinkering is fine, <br/>
&gt;another<br/>
&gt;says it is broken, someone else says there is a 3rd book and yet another <br/>
&gt;source<br/>
&gt;says there isn&#39;t.   I still say nothing that comes from a Guide or even a <br/>
&gt;staff<br/>
&gt;GM means anything...good or bad.<br/>
&gt;If you took what I wrote as a flame maybe YOU should re-read what I wrote<br/>
&gt;instead of automatically going into defenseive mode. </span></blockquote></div>
