<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976256221">Like I said, I&#39;m just going to be in the backround from now on, and won&#39;t <br/>
really give any opinions on anything (heh it&#39;s not like you guys really care <br/>
though, right?) but I did want to give a few last &quot;parting&quot; words. You <br/>
people that reply to messages and judt delete everything need to stop. I <br/>
mean, you see I get a message saying one line of text answering a question, <br/>
and since these messages are not all super orderly and arranges by topics of <br/>
conversation or anythnig, its usually really hard to know whats being talk <br/>
about, for example: Say a message was sent saying: &quot;Is tinkering a cool <br/>
skill?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then someone deletes everything in the previous message and says: &quot;No, it <br/>
sucks, we can&#39;t make a darned useful thing!&quot;, well then unless you <br/>
remembered back to the previous message, you might not know what he meant, <br/>
as you can see, so could you at least leave the message text from the <br/>
previous message if possible so to make it easier for people to discuss <br/>
things, making it more like a &quot;Message Board&quot;, and less like a chat room. <br/>
Thanx.</div>
