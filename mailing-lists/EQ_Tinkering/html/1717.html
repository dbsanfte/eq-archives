<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860034762">I&#39;ve been wandering the alter planes for months now,<br/>
and I&#39;ve never heard of diamond dust dropping. <br/>
Everyone knows I&#39;m looking for it too, so there&#39;s not<br/>
much chance that they&#39;d hide it.  My guess is that<br/>
it&#39;s a lvl 50 mob somewhere else, but I have no idea<br/>
where 8(<br/>

&gt; that the diamond dust is a rare drop item off it. I<br/>
&gt; am thinking that this<br/>
&gt; could mean that the npc may be in the planes but<br/>
&gt; that is merley speculation.<br/>
&gt; I wish he would give up the info but he is keeping<br/>
&gt; it hidden from all for<br/>
&gt; another gnome. Well i hope this gives all you<br/>
&gt; tinkerers hope:) Has anyone <br/>
&gt; discovered what the formula is for the Thermal<br/>
&gt; Cloak? Where can i aquire <br/>
&gt; tattered belts? Are they merely patchwork belts or<br/>
&gt; are they actually called<br/>
&gt; Tattered belts? <br/>
