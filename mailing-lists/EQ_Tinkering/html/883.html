<div id="ygrps-yiv-381747749">If it&#39;s true its a rare drop... I talked to someone who was at the mines <br/>
killing the Hero.. He said he had killed Meldrath a number of times and I <br/>
asked if he dropped a book or anything, he said he dropped only money each <br/>
time.  But, I could not confirm myself.  I still believe the book isn&#39;t out <br/>
there and those that made the fishing pole and animated bait had inside <br/>
information.  I expect that the problem is with the gnomish fireworks and <br/>
when the appropriate patch is made, the third book will appear, perhaps <br/>
even at the windmills.<br/>

&gt;Was emailed a possible spoiler about the rumored missing 3rd book today. <br/>
&gt;The email claimed that &quot;Meldrath&quot; drops the book we&#39;ve all been looking <br/>
&gt;for. I am unable to verify because I&#39;m at work. </span></blockquote></div>
