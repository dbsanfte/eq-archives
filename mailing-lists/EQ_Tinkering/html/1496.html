&gt; created them and could not wait to try them out and see this wonderful<br/>
&gt; display of bursting colors. I nervously double clicked the fireworks<br/>
&gt; (pressed f9 to get the best view) and phffff a little tiny poof of what<br/>
&gt; i think it was color -- it was so damn quick and small i couldn&#39;t make<br/>
&gt; out what had happened -- Verant come on geeze what would it take to make<br/>
&gt; it at least look a little bit like fireworks. when you cast a spell you<br/>
&gt; have beautiful colors and displays and then there is what you give the<br/>
&gt; Gnome tinkering. dont give us a skill and make us look stupid by not<br/>
&gt; having it do anything.<br/>
