<b>Subject:</b> Re: New Idea for tinkering <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-216046224">hehe I love that idea.  I&#39;ve never heard of anyone suggesting that one.<br/>
That would be truely usefull and I can&#39;t see how it could imbalance the<br/>
game if it were to be made a charged item.  The only problem is I don&#39;t<br/>
see how they could possible implement such a thing.  All items that have a<br/>
special ability are based on magic and there&#39;s no magic equivalent to<br/>
this.  I could see how this could work as a combine/tradeskill based item<br/>
if you could put money in an inventory slot and press combine, but I don&#39;t<br/>
think you can put money in an inventory slot can you?<br/>
<br/>
As a rogue I&#39;d love to have this, I can&#39;t even count how many times I&#39;ve<br/>
either dropped or deleted 100s of copper because I was overloaded.<br/>
(pickpocketing tends to steal large amounts of copper)  Even if it<br/>
returned a fraction of the total value of the coins, it would help.  Like<br/>
put 250 copper in there and get 2 gold back.<br/>
