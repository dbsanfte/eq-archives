&gt; This is all I will say. It&#39;s been nice being part of this list. I though you<br/>
&gt; were a bunch of decent people. Your coments have changed my mind. I will no<br/>

&gt; for all the fish.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Woohoo one Troll boy down, half a billion to go! Listen pallie you sign<br/>
up for the list, which has the purpose of *sharing* info, than turn<br/>
around and say you wont share your info with the rest of us, well good<br/>
riddance to you we don&#39;t need or want your kind (note I speak only for<br/>
myself and do not necessarily represent the rest of the list (though I<br/>
would bet I do speak for a majority of them)) <br/>
