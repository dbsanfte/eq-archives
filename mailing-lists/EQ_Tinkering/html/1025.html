<div id="ygrps-yiv-970333986">Ok I made 5 spyglasses last night and 4 fishing poles after raising my skill <br/>
a bit. I went to Ecomm and tried to sell off these great new things. I <br/>
figured I&#39;d charge 60pp for the spyglass and 20 for the pole at first just <br/>
to see what would happen. I did get sell two spyglasses, 1 for 53pp and 1 <br/>
for 60pp. The first guy told me how much the thing sucks then sold it to <br/>
someone else for 55pp. Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
I think it wil be hard to sell these things for such a bloated price. I <br/>
think 40pp may be right and *maybe* 10pp for the pole, but no one wants that <br/>
(by the way.. did anyone see if it breaks?). But we could get away with 60pp <br/>
or more at the bazaar in Ecomm on Bertoxx anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting story ..... =)<br/>
<br/>
I myself think that the spyglasses are definatley worth 60pp just for the <br/>
roleplaying aspects ; ) I was trying to sell some cams and I had my first <br/>
spyglass on me and this big barbarian female started talking to me. So I <br/>
used the telescope to see her better (she was pretty tall)<br/>
and next thing I know she took off her shirt for me! Then I gave her 20 <br/>
gnomish spirits and badabing bada boom she propositioned me for sex! LOL <br/>
Perhaps I should use this as an advertisement for selling my spyglasses... <br/>
sex sells after all =)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it was my new sexy red robe that got her goin&#39;? hmm...<br/>
