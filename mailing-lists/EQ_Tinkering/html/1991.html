<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517061595">Has any one tried placing 4 gem cutters (are they lore) in a Tinmeizer&#39;s<br/>
Fabulous Compactor and pressing the combine button?<br/>
<br/>
It may turn out to be a huge waste, but the compactor did show up around the<br/>
same time as the info on the gem gutter did, maybe they are related in some<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
We could also try to put one cutter with a gem in the compactor and try it<br/>
that way also.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway here are two more Ideals to add to the heap.</div>
