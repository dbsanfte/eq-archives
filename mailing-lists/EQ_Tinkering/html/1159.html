<div id="ygrps-yiv-471864650">I sure hope they introduce some new books, with part prices like the ones<br/>
you mentioned luke.  And I&#39;m also sorely disapointed to hear that the<br/>
collapsable fishing pole breaks, I thought it being unbreakable would be<br/>
its one saving grace.  =(<br/>
<br/>
Since Verant seems to be working on tinkering skill, now would probably be<br/>
a prime time to slip them a little note about the pole and ask that it be<br/>
made unbreakable, so that people will want to buy it.<br/>
<br/>
The last time I tried to get a hold of someone in Verant was when I sent in<br/>
the tinkering petition that had about 400 some signatures on it, I sent<br/>
copies to Smedley and Brad but never got any feedback.  Not even a note<br/>
saying, &quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll foward this to the right guy&quot;.  Kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
But I was able to get feedback from GZ (The guy who does the spells).<br/>
<br/>
His email address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gzatkin@...">gzatkin@...</a><br/>
<br/>
I sure if people emailed him a NICE POLITE and SHORT letter concerning the<br/>
collapsable pole breaking, and ask him to forward this to the trade skills<br/>
person to look at, I&#39;m sure he would help.  <br/>
<br/>
In fact, I think I&#39;m gonna send him a email right now, and I hope everyone<br/>
else will be able to too.<br/>
