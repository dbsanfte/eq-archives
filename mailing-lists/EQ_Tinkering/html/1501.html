If you have no target they operate much like a colored version of the magicians<br/>
flare spell - shooting straight outwards as a lightsource until they hit<br/>
terrain.<br/>
Except for the blue one (can&#39;t remember which number), which does a little<br/>
circle/spiral. If you have someone targeted when you let them off you see a<br/>
message &quot;&lt;Target&gt; lights a firework&quot;, though it always explodes around you, in a<br/>
shower of sparks, and it makes an explosion type sound.<br/>
<br/>
I /bugged the fact that they still look like they have a charge after you use<br/>
them though.<br/>
