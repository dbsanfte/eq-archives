<div id="ygrps-yiv-77384618">I have something to present to everyone............Ive talked to a friend <br/>
who has been playing since the beta..   And he told me that he saw it in a <br/>
shop somewhere but he dosent remember where.    Someone might have just sold <br/>
it to the shop keeper or There might be one out of the way shop keeper that <br/>
sells it.     Maybe we should check everyplace that sells stuff just not in <br/>
the citys but the out of the way places like entrace to ro or the out of the <br/>
way shops....</div>
