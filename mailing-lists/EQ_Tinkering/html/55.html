<div id="ygrps-yiv-897400297">Quest #1 Telescope Lens quest.  Originates in wizards guild.  Obtain 4<br/>
spare telescope lenses and return to guild master.  Reward in beta was a<br/>
level 24 spell.<br/>
<br/>
Quest #2 Observer staff quest.  Originates in steamfont.  Kill 30ish level<br/>
Eye, return cornea (lens) and get a staff of the observer in return.<br/>

* Pie tins are available in the blue building next to the bank in Free Port<br/>
(If I remember correctly)<br/>
* You can tinker below level 16 successfully.  (Verified last night) Woohoo<br/>
<br/>
* Toolbox is fixed.  Mine is sitting in the bank unbagged as we speak.<br/>
* Still haven&#39;t found any leads on the other tinkering books, and I&#39;ve been<br/>
through most of Freeport now.<br/>
* They put a whole lot of new quest/skill related stuff in yesterday.  It<br/>
may be worthwhile to revisit the vendors in Akanon, Steamfont, and Lesser<br/>
Faydark Observitory.<br/>

Found out something interesting on stratististics.  One of the quests from<br/>
Gem Choppers hall (Warriors Guild) rewards people with Tattered armor.<br/>
I&#39;ve only talked to 1 person who has done this quest and he recieved<br/>
Tattered cloth arm bands as his reward.  Maybe this is the place to obtain<br/>
the cloak.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
