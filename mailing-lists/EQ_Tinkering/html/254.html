<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555918921">Might be waiting for the next scheduled downtime to implement the changes since<br/>
they seem to affect gameplay greatly. If a patch has something that you MUST<br/>
have in order to play, then they need to implement it when the servers are down.<br/>
This means server downtime or waiting until the scheduled downtime. Just giving<br/>
it from a programmer&#39;s viewpoint :) I really have no idea why they haven&#39;t<br/>
patched it all in yet, but this could be why...<br/>

&gt; That could be the case, but it&#39;s not becuase they are not making changes to<br/>
&gt; the previous changes that they made becuade they didn&#39;t work. They are just<br/>
&gt; adding new patches with new changes completely different from the last<br/>
&gt; patch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;They arn&#39;t patching the test server because they &quot;care&quot; more about the test<br/>
&gt; &gt;server... as the name &quot;Test&quot; implies, it is a sever used for testing knew<br/>
&gt; &gt;and updated source code... Most everything that is altered and/or added<br/>
&gt; &gt;passes through the test server first... So is understandable that there<br/>
&gt; &gt;will be multiple patches on the test server. Once they get it right, they<br/>
&gt; &gt;dont need to patch more then once with the regular servers...<br/>
