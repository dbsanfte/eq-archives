<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301484613">You are wrong. Gnomad himself made a spyglass, and he used a collapsible <br/>
fishing pole that was given to him from a GM quest in steamfont. He knows <br/>
the formula and it&#39;s posted on his webpage.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Reading this, a thought occured to me. I wouldn&#39;t put it past Verant to <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;made a way to make spyglasses without collapsible fishing poles. Then, they <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;change that &quot;bug&quot; once collapsible fishing poles can be made by players. If <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;is true, the person selling spyglasses really can&#39;t tell us how to make<br/>
&gt;collapsible fishing poles because he doesn&#39;t know. He&#39;s just making<br/>
&gt;spyglasses... he could be lying about making collapsible fishing poles to <br/>
&gt;throw<br/>
&gt;us off. I&#39;m not saying somebody would do that, but he IS trying to keep a<br/>
&gt;monopoly on the market, and I can&#39;t say I blame him with the money he&#39;s <br/>
&gt;making.<br/>
&gt;All I&#39;m really trying to say is we&#39;re probably assuming too much. The <br/>
&gt;brewers<br/>
&gt;went through something similar with bog juice awhile back. Nobody knew it <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;EVERYBODY was trying to figure out the recipe. Once the recipe was found<br/>
&gt;(actually, it got posted by a GM), it was nothing like anybody had been <br/>
&gt;trying.<br/>
&gt;People were using yeast, malt, hops, and barley in a drink that requires <br/>
&gt;nothing<br/>
&gt;more than snake scales and water. Collapsible fishing poles, if they&#39;re <br/>
&gt;possible<br/>
&gt;to begin with, could be made with a rod, a pine needle, and a gear for all <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;know. Hell, for all we know, a rod, a pine needle, and a gear makes the<br/>
&gt;spyglass!<br/>
