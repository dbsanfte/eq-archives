<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806938339">As i posted earlier, a friend of mine have found the Dimmond dust inside PAW. He was then level 28 and he did only get 1 wich he sold for 150 in SK zone.Maybe it drops for a number of spawn but inside is a fact.<br/>
This is a RL friend but he didnt know that i was looking for it :-(.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I am a lvl 50 nec, I cleared paw maybe like 2 times already for my<br/>
&gt; spell, (I know there is a short cut to the Ishiva, but clearing paw is more<br/>
&gt; fun plus I wanted to get that 10 int book :) ) anyways I never got the<br/>
&gt; diamond dust and i would think after clearing it for a few times it might<br/>
&gt; drop.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now--&gt; Ideas<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - it is very very rare and is a random drop on ALL of the Gnolls, i.e like<br/>
&gt; the Paw armor , its a drop off of any gnoll.<br/>
&gt; - a rare spawn gnoll either out side or inside paw. ( if he is a lvl 25<br/>
&gt; ench he could not get very far into paw.)<br/>
&gt; - Maybe, it would make sense of a rare spawn farrie or somthing like that.<br/>
&gt; - Maybe that flying horse drops it ( i never killed it but I seen it once<br/>
&gt; at lvl 35)<br/>
&gt; - Grizzelnot (??) I would guess a lvl 25 enchancer can kill him , I did at<br/>
&gt; lvl 25, he is sometimes low lvl, and he does go thru paw, his pathing.<br/>
&gt; - maybe an aviak ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also a clue if he (/ooc What is Diamond dust?) in SK, he probobly got it in<br/>
&gt; SK. so I dont think it may have been any zones that are close to SK. <br/>
&gt; ( At least now we know where to look )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also , to get more info out of that guy even if we dont play on F-Ro maybe<br/>
&gt; we should creat a mule char and bug the sht out of that guy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; just make a char then go /anon so he does not see your lvl. and start<br/>
&gt; bugging him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; also maybe he will reveal the location for some good cash ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; he is lvl 25, those guys can be bought out easly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
