&gt; NOTHING on Everquest remains a secret, PERIOD.  With over 100,000 active<br/>
&gt; players, and a very finite world size, there is just no way anyone can keep<br/>
&gt; anything hidden from the rest of the playerbase for long periods of time.  A<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In general I would agree with you but bear in mind this.  There are<br/>
probably<br/>
no more than a couple of dozen serious tinkerers.  Heck gnomes<br/>
themselves are<br/>
very rare.  I see very few as compared to elves or humans.<br/>
<br/>
With such a small population, it IS possible for the secret to be held.  <br/>
Even more so when all the other things you get from tinkering are useful<br/>
to practically no one.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; other &quot;amazing&quot; tinker inventions, I have yet to find a reasonable use for<br/>
&gt; it that can&#39;t be duplicated by store-bought items or mob drops.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; flameless lantern = crappy lightstone<br/>
&gt; compass = store-bought compass and trivial to everyone<br/>
&gt; firewater = component for random junk and trivial to everyone<br/>
&gt; mechanized lockpicks = how many locks have you seen?<br/>
&gt; thermal cloak = who&#39;s gonna wear it?<br/>
&gt; animated bait = who fishes as a profession?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  All this is all the more reason to believe the secret may be known<br/>
but<br/>
just hidden.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; cams = useful!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really?  I keep on asking for fletchers if they want it and never got a <br/>
reply.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; spyglass = useful?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Apparently wizards have a spell that does the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; collapsible fishing pole = the reason for this list<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Useful??  Who the hell fishes anymore.  I can get free food from<br/>
clerics, mages,<br/>
rangers, druids...  Its use is only as a component, much like firewater.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I have missed some stuff, and obviously tinkered things exist out there that<br/>
&gt; we haven&#39;t seen yet (like the recently-introduced bait).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I made a trip through akanon asking everyone about tinkering and fishing<br/>
poles<br/>
and looking at every merchant.  Couldn&#39;t find anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would be very upset if that &quot;third book&quot; resided in an area that made it<br/>
&gt; difficult, if not impossible, for tinkers below level 35 to attain.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As an aside, I heard from a post either here or on a WWW site that one<br/>
of the<br/>
files contains the text aqua-lung.  Could this be another tinkering<br/>
item?<br/>
It certainly sounds so.<br/>
