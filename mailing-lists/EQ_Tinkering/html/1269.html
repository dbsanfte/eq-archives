<b>Subject:</b> RE: Why aqualungs will be totally useless UNLESS.. . <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-400944486">I actually think that aqualungs would be viable if they were in the 50 plat<br/>
range instead of the 225 plat range.� Inevitably, all tinkered items are<br/>
simply not worth the cost.� The same goes for a number of other trade<br/>
skills, especially jewelery (and they&#39;ve rubbed it in by making plat<br/>
jewelery never trivial).� I suppose it&#39;s nice for folks that have money to<br/>
burn and nothing better to do.<br/>

They take away the charges... My main char is a druid and I can tell you I<br/>
can get about 40 fish scales in about 10 minutes, plus I hear magicians will<br/>
be able to summon water stones, so what is the point of having a aqua lung?<br/>
until I see evidence otherwise (the rebreather upgrade eliminating the<br/>
charges), this is just another bite in the ass for tinkering, Just like the<br/>
5 charges on stalking probes, now who would wanna buy an item with 5<br/>
charges? nobody. the spyglass is the only decent item that tinkers can make<br/>
and even then its not so great, its only good for going to OOT and scoping<br/>
out the other islands (to check if sentry xyrin is there). I am also a<br/>
smith, so I know what you guys are going through, the items we make we cant<br/>
even GIVE away, much less try to sell to make any profit. <br/>
