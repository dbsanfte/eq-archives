<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932818366">Yes, the Gnome that comes out of the destroyed Cargo Clockwork is the Cargo<br/>
Clockwork Driver.  I had a minute to try getting him to talk after some high<br/>
levels killed the clockwork.  I tried the standard hails, clicked on him to<br/>
see if he sold anything and even mentioned tinkering, but I didn&#39;t try<br/>
Gimblestan, because after a minute he just disappears.  I didn&#39;t get him to<br/>
open his mouth one bit.  I asked the high levels why they didn&#39;t attack the<br/>
Driver and they said he was too tough for them, even tougher than the Guards<br/>
and that he didn&#39;t have any loot that they heard of.  <br/>

		Well, I don?t know if this has anything at all to do<br/>
		with tinkering, but I?ll post it here in case any of<br/>
		you have the resources and contacts to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
		You see, the other day as I was on my way in Steamfont<br/>
		to try out the new tinkering recipies, I met the Cargo<br/>
		clockwork on it?s way to the windmills. (It was that<br/>
		big one that usually stands beside the entrance to<br/>
		Ak?Anon).<br/>
<br/>
		As I came closer I saw an ogre player beating on it,<br/>
		and I waited till he finished, to hear from him what<br/>
		loot he?d get. He killed it, and to my big surprise a<br/>
		gnome appeared from under the corpse. His name was<br/>
		driver Bryggin, and it seems he is driving the Cargo<br/>
		clockwork.<br/>
<br/>
		Before I could hail him the ogre started killing him<br/>
		too. The gnome beat hard so the ogre had to flee, but<br/>
		the gnome died anyway. I guess the ogre had cast a DoT<br/>
		spell on it or something. With the ogre away I looted<br/>
		the corpses, but they had nothing valuable. The<br/>
		clockwork had scrap metal and the gnome had a rusty<br/>
		dagger.<br/>
		So my question is, has any of you ever tried to hail<br/>
		Driver Bryggin? Could he have a quest, or even be a<br/>
		merchant? Anyone interested in checking? I surely<br/>
		don?t want to get messed up factins in Ak?Anon by<br/>
		killing the clockwork myself.<br/>
