<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161743700">Well, on one hand I&#39;m glad to hear it (that you aren&#39;t keeping it secret)...<br/>
on the other hand, im not (that its still unknown).  I do overreact sometimes.<br/>
Sorry about it, but with the previous posts of some guy knowing the plans and<br/>
keeping it secret and what you said in your mailing list post and the website<br/>
changes, it was hard not to draw that conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
Again, sorry, but nevertheless, I still would understand if you did (or are)<br/>
keeping it secret :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; A few days back on the Tarew Marr server, GMs did a dynamic quest in<br/>
&gt; Steamfont (Meldrath invasion).  I wasn&#39;t on at the time of the event, but I<br/>
&gt; learned about it later when I logged on and got a tell about it and that<br/>
&gt; one of the items found in the loot was a collapsible fishing pole.  I was<br/>
&gt; given the pole, and from it I was able to make the spyglass (re-read my<br/>
&gt; original message to the list...)  Yes, that spyglass formula on the site is<br/>
&gt; correct :P  I put up a fairly quick update to the site with the screenshots<br/>
&gt; and such.  On the main page news - &#39;Another update soon&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know the formula for the fishing pole, in case you haven&#39;t guessed<br/>
&gt; it yet.  Should I have mentioned this sooner?  A bad oversight in getting<br/>
&gt; some info up on two items, which for a tough-to-find-anything skill like<br/>
&gt; tinkering, is great news.  Still, I was rather disappointed at some of the<br/>
&gt; comments I received...  Anyone remember the old saying for when people<br/>
&gt; ASSUME? :P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The items exist in the game.  We don&#39;t know the formula for the fishing<br/>
&gt; pole, however.  In that case, why not start a project to find it.  I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; start (which I was intending to do aka the update...) creating a list of<br/>
&gt; all the combinations that people try on the site.  Through that we should<br/>
&gt; be able to find it, right?  I see no reason why not.  For those hesitant<br/>
&gt; about spending the cash, think of it as an investment 8)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Awaiting feedback...<br/>
