&gt;     No, the lens quest he refers to, and the lens quest for the Observer <br/>
 </span></blockquote>staff is different. The observer staff quest is given out at the <br/>
observatory North of the Windmills, where as the other lens quest is given <br/>
by the observitory by Akanon. And just for the record the Obeserver staff <br/>
is NOT the best staff in the game for mage classes.. The Staff of Writhing <br/>
is much better+ACE- It casts random chaotic feedbacks... and its has some <br/>
nice +- stats too. Cant remember them all exacly. Ill look next time i log <br/>
on. I havnt been playing much lately...<br/>
<br/>
Observer Staff 2H<br/>
Damage 12<br/>
Delay 35<br/>
Ratio 342<br/>
Intelligence +5<br/>
Wisdom +5<br/>
Mana +30<br/>
48 Charges of Sentinel Enchanter spell, warns while meditating<br/>
<br/>
Staff of Writhing 1H<br/>
Damage 9<br/>
Delay 33<br/>
Ratio 273<br/>
Chaotic Feedback upto 48 damage when successful<br/>
<br/>
First they are two different styles of weapon but the Observer staff is <br/>
much more deadly, not in melee power but at level 30 (or thereabouts) when <br/>
you can get either staff the Observer staff adds 60 mana with bonus mana <br/>
and bonus intelligence and it only goes up with levels. Just one more thing <br/>
personally I would rather carry a Black Tome with Silver Runes and a <br/>
Glowing Black Stone at that level......<br/>
<br/>
Tome<br/>
Mana +30<br/>
Intelligence +4<br/>
<br/>
Stone<br/>
Intelligence +9<br/>
Save Magic +10<br/>
<br/>
That would be around 120 extra mana at level 30. I will let the tanks hit, <br/>
I rather have a few &quot;roots&quot; left in me then rather to be able to hope to <br/>
get good shot in with mobs that hit for 100 points of dmg.<br/>
