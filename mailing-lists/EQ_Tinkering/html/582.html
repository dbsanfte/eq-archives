<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599662427">You only need a group of 2 really.  One is a bit crazy.  You just stay at the<br/>
zone and pull things there and fight.  It is best to fight down in the room near<br/>
the sol b zone.  It is nicely spaced out and it is safe to zone into sol b.<br/>
Atleast for a short while.  Have a tank with you, and a healer is always nice.<br/>
With those 3 in a party you should be fine, but even a full party is cool<br/>
there.  you can pull MoBs according to your party.  You get plenty of FS as<br/>
loot, and good exp.<br/>

&gt; You went there at lvl 20?  With how many people in your group?  Did you talk<br/>
&gt; to the gnomes and check for any info?  For the heck of it, I did a /who all<br/>
&gt; gnome 40 50 and found one at lvl 43 and asked him about solusek.  He said<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s been there and talked to the gnomes and they didn&#39;t have any tinkering<br/>
&gt; information.  But he said he doesn&#39;t tinker so he wasn&#39;t specifically<br/>
&gt; looking for that kind of info.<br/>
