&gt; Making those bags would be quite impressive, however I imagine also very<br/>
&gt; expensive to make taking in consideration how much they vendors sell them.<br/>
&gt;  Personally, I&#39;m not convinced Verant would allow us to make such a<br/>
&gt; powerful item but it will be interesting to see.<br/>

plain old longsword then a combine.  The price isn&#39;t determined by the power<br/>
of an item with merchants, and in fact verant seems to have made more powerful<br/>
items worth less to vendors in order to promote a player run economy.<br/>
