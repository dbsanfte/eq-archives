&gt;These will probably be nothing, but, if you got a few minutes, might be<br/>
&gt;worth looking into.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1)  Most likely someone&#39;s checked into this already, but what about the<br/>
&gt;gnomes in the mino caves?  Gimbalstan DID go on an expedition into those<br/>
&gt;caves, after all...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I spent a bunch of time in there trying to get them to talk... got <br/>
nothing out of them... no response, i gave them money, even gave one of <br/>
them an axe so he could kill off the minos quicker.  I asked about <br/>
Gimblestan, I asked about tinkering, Eldritch Collective, fishing pole, you <br/>
name it... My primary reason was to find Bidl Frugrin to complete the <br/>
telescope lens quest (this was prior to them fixing the telescope lens <br/>
quest), but I did ask tinkering questions since I hoped solving the <br/>
telescope lens quest would lead to a further quest related to tinkering.<br/>
