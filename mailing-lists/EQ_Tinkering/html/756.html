<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777525480">After you give Tergon the book, he gives you a quest to kill a pirate gnome<br/>
magician in OOT. I killed the pirate gnome and he dropped a Tier&#39;Dal Head. I<br/>
took the head to Tergon and he gave me the Elemental Grimoire (Magician<br/>
research book). The quest ends there and has nothing to do with tinkering.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The gnome in crushbone is actually part of the Tergon&#39;s Spellbook quest<br/>
&gt; which has recently been fixed since Bugglepup the gnome now spawns in<br/>
&gt; steamfont.  When you talk to Tergon in ak&#39;anon he says to retrieve a metal<br/>
&gt; pellet that he shot Bugglepup with and lost.  Well once you return it to<br/>

&gt; that tells him to give you the spellbook.  So you goto freeport and learn<br/>
&gt; that he was captured by the orcs.  So you take the letter to him in<br/>
&gt; crushbone and he tells you the oracle in the castle took the book.  Kill<br/>
