<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116206479">I agree with much of what you have in this post.  I<br/>
highly doubt, however, that they will include<br/>
clockwork pets on any scale beyond a novelty.  Trade<br/>
skills weren&#39;t really meant to become this elaborate,<br/>
at least that&#39;s the message I&#39;ve gotten from all of<br/>
the staff I&#39;ve talked to at Verant.<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify one point you made below..  you really<br/>
took a low guess at their revenue numbers..  Last I<br/>
heard, the monthly income from EQ is &gt; 2M/month (there<br/>
are over 200k subscribed players)<br/>
<br/>
hrmmmm....<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, I definately hope that Virant does SOMETHING<br/>
&gt; with the<br/>
&gt; Tinkering, because as of 6PM Jun 20th there are<br/>
&gt; roughly 50,000 people<br/>
&gt; playing Everquest. Now, this is a low figure, as the<br/>
&gt; TEST server is<br/>
&gt; down and its not a weekend, where most servers<br/>
&gt; average more than 2000<br/>
&gt; people at a time, and not 1600 as it is right now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This means Verant is Making the profit from the<br/>
&gt; actual SALES of<br/>
&gt; Everquest AND at least FIVE-HUNDRED-THOUSAND dollars<br/>
&gt; a month on top<br/>
&gt; of that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Figures taken from:<br/>
&gt; ... 50,000 people<br/>
&gt; ...x $ 100 a year (assuming they pay PER six months<br/>
&gt; and not per month)<br/>
&gt; ......ï¿½ 12 months<br/>
&gt; ---------<br/>
&gt; $ 500,000 PER MONTH<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My point being this. If they are making so much damn<br/>
&gt; money a month,<br/>
&gt; they can get off thier collective butts and do<br/>
&gt; something about<br/>
&gt; Tinkering. I know it has been said that it will be<br/>
&gt; coming after the<br/>
&gt; Poison Patch, but DAMN.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ya Know?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Im talking Clockwork Pets Here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the all the components of a corpse can be<br/>
&gt; collected, then there<br/>
&gt; should be corresponding brainboxes to them, and we<br/>
&gt; should be able to<br/>
&gt; create them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If people cry out &quot;UNBALANCING!&quot; then we should<br/>
&gt; remind them that it<br/>
&gt; takes THOUSANDS of plat to Level our skills, and<br/>
&gt; that the components<br/>
&gt; to the brainboxes for these things should be<br/>
&gt; difficult to quest by<br/>
&gt; corresponding to the Creature being Clockworked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (SC) Small Creatures     : Brainboxes can be bought<br/>
&gt; or made for 5-20pp<br/>
&gt; (LC) Large Creatures     : 25-55pp<br/>
&gt; (SH) Small Humanoid      : 60-125pp<br/>
&gt; (LH) Large Humanoid      : 130-250pp<br/>
&gt; (VLH) VERY Large Humanoid : 255-500pp<br/>
&gt; (VLC) VERY Large Creature : 1000-5000pp<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The large gap between VLH&#39;s and VLC&#39;s is because<br/>
&gt; Ogres and Trolls<br/>
&gt; wouldnt do NEAR as much damage as Krackens and<br/>
&gt; Dragons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This should keep the VLH/VLC Clockworks from being a<br/>
&gt; dime a dozen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course the actual costs and quest difficulties<br/>
&gt; can be hashed over<br/>
&gt; for balance, but this shouldnt cause any unbalancing<br/>
&gt; issues if done<br/>
&gt; right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Verant is being PAID to do it right, and keep us<br/>
&gt; PAYING people happy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To make things more balanced, Tinkering could be<br/>
&gt; made a Race-Specific<br/>
&gt; Specialty-Class. This would work by keeping<br/>
&gt; Tinkering a Gnome trait<br/>
&gt; available to ALL GNOMES, but those Gnomes that<br/>
&gt; choose to become a<br/>
&gt; MASTER-TINKERER would have to coose to do so as a<br/>
&gt; CLASS just like a<br/>
&gt; Magic-User has to choose what type of caster he<br/>
&gt; wants to be, a Gnome<br/>
&gt; would have to choose between being a normal class of<br/>
&gt; Gnome, or a<br/>
&gt; MASTER-TINKERER.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gnomes that do this would be able to create the more<br/>
&gt; elaborate<br/>
&gt; Tinkers such as the VLC&#39;s and VLH&#39;s and the more<br/>
&gt; sought-after pieces<br/>
&gt; of equipment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are asking about the balance of having<br/>
&gt; characters with Pet<br/>
&gt; Clockwork Dragons or Krackens&#39;, then remember. These<br/>
&gt; MASTER-TINKERERS<br/>
&gt; have to spend hundreds of plat just to earn the<br/>
&gt; SKILL to create these<br/>
&gt; creatures, and then spend the time to collect the<br/>
&gt; pieces of these<br/>
&gt; creatures (How many dragons do you think it would<br/>
&gt; take to kill, just<br/>
&gt; to collect every single dragon piece? Thats a LOT of<br/>
&gt; WORK), and then<br/>
&gt; the pure plat and time to collect the pieces to<br/>
&gt; thier brainbox!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What if it fails? We are talking possibly 3-4 WEEKS<br/>
&gt; Real time in lost<br/>
&gt; Plat and Time, all in a blink of an eye.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sure, there would be lots of Clockwork rats and<br/>
&gt; spiders, but who<br/>
&gt; cares? My Enchanter&#39;s First-level apparition can<br/>
&gt; demolish those! Its<br/>
&gt; not like they would be the most sturdy of<br/>
&gt; Clockworks...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have taken the time to read this Very long<br/>
&gt; Post,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please offer your opinion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank-you for your time.<br/>
