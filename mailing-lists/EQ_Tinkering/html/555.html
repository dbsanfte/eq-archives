<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-61035467">Solusek&#39;s Eye is home to a pretty large population of gnomes which I think<br/>
is the Solusek Mining Company. I think they might know something about<br/>
tinkering because there is one merchant there that sells a tinkerer&#39;s bag, I<br/>
don&#39;t know what the bag does because I just don&#39;t have the 5600 platinum he<br/>
wants for it. I can&#39;t find anything to say to get him to talk to me. I know<br/>
there&#39;s another gnome with a name in the room just across from the merchant<br/>
but unfortunately she isn&#39;t always there and I would have to destroy a<br/>
clockwork to get her to spawn which I am personaly opposed to and when she<br/>
does show up she doesn&#39;t live long because she carries a much sought after<br/>
cloak so I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to talk to her. I got the info about the<br/>
bait second hand so I don&#39;t know the name of the person who found the book<br/>
to get a screenshot or even give him credit. I was told he is going to post<br/>
the recipes so whoever you are if you&#39;re reading this please hurry!<br/>

&gt; Thank you much for the hint you were given.  I&#39;ll try that as soon as<br/>
&gt; I log in.  Why exactly do you think it&#39;s in Solusek&#39;s Eye?  What a<br/>
&gt; horrid place to hide something like that.  Tho, on second thought it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not a bad idea.  Keep the good stuff for the brave.  As I understand<br/>
&gt; it there is a way to tailor snakeskin gear.  I met someone who&#39;s<br/>
&gt; friend made some.  Of course, that and the bait could be either lucky<br/>
&gt; finds or false alltogether.<br/>
