dearly love to find a source of HQ wolf pelts to outfit all those halfling<br/>
druids with reinforced leather.  I&#39;ve seen one in all my lifetimes!<br/>

About diamond dust..  someone on our server knows<br/>
where to get it.  They won&#39;t tell anyone.  I&#39;ve looked<br/>
all over too, and I can&#39;t find it.  I have heard that<br/>
there are NPC&#39;s who will cut/crush gems for you if you<br/>
give them a gem.  I don&#39;t know where these folks are<br/>
either. <br/>
<br/>
Time will tell, these things will be turn up, and then<br/>
we&#39;ll be able to perform our trade like the other<br/>
tradesman out there, who never have to worry about<br/>
finding their components.  /rude Verant<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s more likely that the dust just isn&#39;t in<br/>
&gt; the game yet.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a really expensive thought, but has anyone<br/>
&gt; tried using a diamond?<br/>
&gt; Maybe it gets turned to dust in the process.  Its<br/>
&gt; probably off base but with<br/>
&gt; so much searching and no finding you have to wonder.<br/>
