<div id="ygrps-yiv-64430404">Bad news, apparently the &#39;Bag of the Tinkerers&#39; is a backpack that has 10 <br/>
slots with 100% weight reduction.  That isn&#39;t worth 8000 pp to me!  If we <br/>
could make one it&#39;ll likely cost us 13000pp to produce (compass).  Or it&#39;ll <br/>
cost 3000pp to make and then not work (cams).  Nonetheless, you won&#39;t get <br/>
any experience from it because you&#39;d get the tattered backpack back on a <br/>
failed attempt.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, no luck yet on the other books.</div>
