<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405577097"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;i dont think thats for the pole at all. Why would it say anything about<br/>
&gt;vision if it was. That might be for glasses of some sort or something. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;never even tinkered (im not even a gnome :), but &quot;vision&quot; has nothing to do<br/>
&gt;with fishing poles.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  no, no. though, you are right that it isn&#39;t the pole recipe, but the<br/>
spyglass recipe. however, you need the pole to make the spyglass. the books,<br/>
unfortunately don&#39;t tell us how to make the pole, so we need to deduce from<br/>
the spyglasss recipe what might be needed.<br/>
<br/>
  on that note, i firmly believe there is a metal rod in the collapsible<br/>
pole and NO fishing pole in it. that is silly. yeah, yeah, so are rat ears.<br/>
i don&#39;t care. we need to pound these things out methodically. we know the<br/>
recipe for the spyglass. we can go from there. go to lucas&#39; site, and then<br/>
the guy with the spreadsheet&#39;s site (i forget his name). this needs to be<br/>
organized into a team effort.<br/>
<br/>
  here&#39;s what we need:<br/>
<br/>
   -a project coordinator (to deal out recipes and make<br/>
announcements/decisions)<br/>
   -volunteers with some cash and/or skill (i can&#39;t, i&#39;m 10th lvl, i have<br/>
neither)<br/>
   -a volunteer to make an excel spreadsheet of all combinations with likely<br/>
components, and a way to mark what has been done (i was going to, but no<br/>
time anymore)<br/>
<br/>
  another thing that might be helpful. anyone who is on the server (xegony?)<br/>
with the gnome who claims to know how to make poles, we need to put a tail<br/>
on him. constantly. see where he goes, what he does. see if he&#39;s trying to<br/>
sell the same glass over and over, or is making new ones. he no doubt reads<br/>
this digest, so he&#39;d be on to us. i still have a hard time believing he can<br/>
do it, and would bet money the pole is broken. i wish we could confirm it.<br/>
god damn verant and their &quot;you&#39;ll just have to find out&quot; attitude. if it&#39;s<br/>
F$%#@N broken then tell us. ok that ends my rant section.<br/>
<br/>
   let&#39;s get this!!!<br/>
