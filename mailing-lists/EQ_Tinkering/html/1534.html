<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088101900">This is so funny.... for all of us old Onelist Tinker Email people I thought <br/>
we decided that the skill cap was LEVEL X 5 - 13    or    (lvlx5)-13   <br/>
<br/>
That would make the lvl 27 guy  be able to max out at 122 and that lvl 18 guy <br/>
at his current max of 77.  The one list is definately falling apart if we <br/>
cant remember what we have learned.</div>
