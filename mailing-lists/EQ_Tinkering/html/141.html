I am glad to hear that you are selling compasses at all. In many towns I<br/>
have come to there seems to be a merchant who will sell them. The merchant<br/>
is not used often from what I can tell because they are always stuck in a<br/>
back corner. There is a merchant one in qeynos by the docks. if you walk out<br/>
of Fishes ale and go to the docks you will see a tall building on your right<br/>
and a merchant sitting in the middle of a counter that goes in a circle<br/>
around him.. He sells compasses for 2pp and it seems to cost us 3pp to make.<br/>
Anyone else see a problem with this? I for one think that the vendors should<br/>
be selling there compasses for around 7pp. That gives us some nice room to<br/>
work. I have also seen compasses for sale in the High Elf City and Halas<br/>
(all<br/>
for 2pp).<br/>
