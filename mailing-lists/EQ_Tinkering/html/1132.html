<br/>
*Trade Skill Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
Enhancements have been made to the Tinkering trade skill to facilitate<br/>
underwater breathing.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had a chance to look, but I&#39;m going to be checking my tinkering<br/>
books to see if this new recipe magically appeared. It&#39;s probably in Journal<br/>
IX, which would suck because we would have to get hold of that Cazic Thule<br/>
guy and have him cough it up.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what the stats are, but if this allows one to actually have<br/>
underwater breathing, we could make a fortune. Especially since they just<br/>
itemized Kedge as well. Just hang out in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron with your<br/>
supplies and bug the people heading in to Kedge.<br/>
