&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been a member of this list for some time now, just waiting, reading,<br/>
&gt;and hoping for the day that tinkering would become useful.  Well I decided<br/>
&gt;when these aqualungs and rebreathers came out to give it a shot.  Here is<br/>
&gt;my story<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Day 1: Invested 750plat into tinkering and got to 75 skill<br/>
&gt;Day 2: Invested another 750plat and got to 85 skill.<br/>
&gt;Day 3: Invested 1400plat and got my skill to 102.<br/>
&gt;Day 3: Invested 1000plat in aqualungs, 4 attempts, 2 successes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As updated information for the website<br/>
&gt;The spyglass trivilas at 101.  it wasn&#39;t trivial at 100 (I checked)<br/>
&gt;The Stalking Probes Trivial out at 102.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unless the Gemcutter comes through somehow (assuming someone finds out<br/>
&gt;where diamond dust can be found, only aqualungs can raise my skill any<br/>

&gt;I haven&#39;t sold any yet, but I am hopeing to get between 600 and 750 plat<br/>
&gt;for them.  I don&#39;t see much of a market for them as Shamen, Druids, and<br/>
&gt;Enchanters all can cast the Enduring Breath spell.<br/>
&gt;Just as a note of the 3900plat I have spent, a good chunk of it came from<br/>
&gt;members of my guild.  Even at level 42 I just don&#39;t have this kind of money<br/>
&gt;kicking around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With the help of friendly enchanters and a Crude Stine I try to get the<br/>
&gt;best prices.  Current Relavent stats are<br/>
&gt;Wisdom: 88<br/>
&gt;Intiligence: 187<br/>
&gt;Charisma: 75 (87-110) (buffed)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I had truely known it was going to be this expensive, I may not have<br/>
&gt;started the task, but once I took the first donation from my guildmates I<br/>
&gt;had no choice but to continue.  So if anyone wants aqualungs on Fennin Ro,<br/>
&gt;just look me up.  I am shooting for 750pp each to the public, but if you<br/>
&gt;tell me you read it here I will go as low as 600.  With a 50% succes rate I<br/>
&gt;just can&#39;t go any lower and still hope to break try to break even.<br/>
