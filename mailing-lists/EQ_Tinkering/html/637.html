&gt; That&#39;s wacky, I&#39;ve heard about silk armor and someone made some bone a<br/>
&gt; while back.  I met someone who&#39;s friend made them some snakeskin but<br/>
&gt; obviously they weren&#39;t willing to part with the secret.  One of my<br/>
&gt; characters just found the cash cow and milked it dry so I think it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; time to start tailoring.. not being a gnome he can&#39;t put the coin to<br/>
&gt; REAL use.  Ah well..<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve not found any sites with info except &#39;hey, lookie what I did!&#39;.<br/>
&gt; If anyone wants me to report my findings (if there are any...) I will,<br/>
&gt; just give me your E, I&#39;d like to post it here but off topic is a nasty<br/>
&gt; nasty thing on an elist.<br/>
&gt; So.. pardon for the offtopic.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just go to EQ_Tailors on onelist.  The last digest will have the new<br/>
tailoring info.</div>
