<b>Subject:</b> Getting to 200 skill cheaply <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545750639">Hi  a post from the mailing list had this:<br/>
<br/>
Here comes the interesting bit. She claimed to have a primary<br/>
character that<br/>
was a level 48 Gnome WIzard, who had an almost 200 Tinkering skill.<br/>
AND she<br/>
stated that it only cost her 400PP to get it up to 200 ! ! ! HOW in<br/>
THE HELL<br/>
is this ACCOMPLISHED?! Am I the only person who thinks this number is<br/>
just<br/>
impossible? 400pp barely covers the cost of 2 Aqualungs, much less<br/>
Cams and<br/>
Spyglasses etc etc to get the skill 100... much less OVER 100 ! Has<br/>
anyone<br/>
else run across a person making such FRIVILOUS claims?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I actually spoke with someone on the TM server who said something<br/>
much along the same lines...that that they had gotten a first<br/>
character up to a very high skill at not a lot of expense.  THis was<br/>
a few months ago, and I wonder if the prices of the components have<br/>
simply risen a lot recently (or the trivial points changed).  <br/>
<br/>
Were the components for tinkering much lower priced (or even<br/>
available) last fall?  If so, then maybe these people could have<br/>
gotten their skill up so cheaply.  <br/>
<br/>
I posted a message about this a few months ago, and didn&#39;t get any<br/>
responses, so figured that person was pulling my leg.<br/>
