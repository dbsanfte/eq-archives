<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543982007">I didn;t have a gnome, so i decided to start one up on xegony to see if<br/>
i can get the cash to try a few things, i had been thinking about<br/>
adding a cork to the shafts or rods, who knows maybe it needed<br/>
somehtign to stop it from collapsing too far. I had read about<br/>
salvadori, did a who all sal, and guess who was on, i asked him if he<br/>
was the guy making the poles, he said yes, i told him about my cork<br/>
idea, and he laughed and assured me a cork is not used. take that as<br/>
you will, i tried to get anymore info out of him, but was unable, only<br/>
found out his group is working on finding the ever elusive infra<br/>
goggles. also if gnomish fireworks are ever made, i would assume they<br/>
would cast some sort of dmg spell, maybe they;ve been replaced by those<br/>
generator or modulators, or whatever people were talkign about a few<br/>
weeks ago (I just read all the digest archives for fun tonight :P).<br/>
anyways thats my 0 cp, sinc ei got killed by a large rat and decided to<br/>
quit tinkering till tommorow.<br/>
