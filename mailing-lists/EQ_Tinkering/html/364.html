&gt;Hello Folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After seeing all the different combinations that we have tried to no <br/>
&gt;avail, I&#39;m beginning to think there might be a component somewhere that we <br/>
&gt;are not using. Looking on the &#39;Database&#39; <br/>
&gt;(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)">http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)</a> I see that not many <br/>
&gt;combinations have been tried with the cork, sprocket, or cloth twine. <br/>
&gt;Although they dont seem to be the most likely candidates, I could see them <br/>
&gt;as a possibility.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With all the misses, I just cant help thinking we have missed something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am also beginning to think that the earlier rumors of the fishing pole <br/>
&gt;being makable are bull shit. If someone is making the poles and the eye <br/>
&gt;glasses, I would have thought we would have heard about more people having <br/>
&gt;them. We have not heard a peep from anyone since. Perhaps as Luke said, <br/>
&gt;the pole was given as part of a GM quest, and was not actually tinkered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think it says something about the sad state of tinkering when our &#39;holy <br/>
&gt;grail&#39; is a damn fishing pole =|<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cheers,<br/>
