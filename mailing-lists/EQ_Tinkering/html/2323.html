<b>Subject:</b> Rebreather pricing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585666056">i know many of you accross all the servers that have high tinkering skills<br/>
have probably been propositioned to make rebreathers.  especially now that<br/>
they are part of the warrior FA quest.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just curious what a reasonable rate might be?<br/>
i know it kinda depends on the server, but i have had people tell me to<br/>
charge anywhere from 2k - 10k for EACH rebreather.  While i don&#39;t mind a<br/>
profit, i really would hate to be raping my customers, and at the same time<br/>
I don&#39;t want to undercut everyone else.  i tinker because its fun, not as a<br/>
way to make cash.<br/>
