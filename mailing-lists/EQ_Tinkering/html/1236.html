<b>Subject:</b> All charged items are total garbage. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890005865">I dont know why verant even brought charged items into the game, they are so<br/>
stupid. There is no way to recharge them so why even use them? Anyone else<br/>
agree? do a /feedback and join me... Tinkers really got the shaft, 50<br/>
charges, 1 charge, still the same bullshit, its by far easier to camp HADDEN<br/>
a 8 hour spawn with a rare drop fishbone earring than to shell out 300+ pp<br/>
for a lousy 50 charges (or 1 charge). Verant really messed this game up in<br/>
that way IMHO..</div>
