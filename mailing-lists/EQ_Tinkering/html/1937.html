<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086565058">Toko Binlittle is one of the pirates at that island in<br/>
OOT. He have only dropped a pirate earring each time I<br/>
have killed him. You arent losing any faction with<br/>
AkAnon either, actually killing these pirates gives<br/>
some nice factions with &quot;good&quot; people around Norrath.<br/>
Gornit, the giant at their side, will not trouble you<br/>
either, as long as you keep a watchful eye on him<br/>
while you pull (it may pay off to keep an eye on<br/>
cyclopes too). He regularilly wanders from the waters<br/>
edge, to the pirate camp, and back, but can easily be<br/>
timed. I was doing this with a lvl 20ish group, to get<br/>
the Bracer of Errolisi, that drops from the pirate<br/>
captain. Anyway, my point is I doubt it drops from<br/>
him, but it even if I think so, it could still be a<br/>
rare drop, I havent killed him that many times.<br/>
