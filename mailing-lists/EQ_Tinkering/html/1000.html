<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, here is how I have seen tinkering work with my own character.  Others&#39; <br/>
results may vary, but no one has reported such yet.<br/>
<br/>
Hit level 16.  Yay you get to tinker and learn right?  No.  You won&#39;t learn <br/>
a thing.  The skill is at 50 and won&#39;t move.<br/>
<br/>
Level 17:  Okay, you get to have real tinkering enjoyment.  You get to gain <br/>
one whole point.  So, skill is now at 51.<br/>
<br/>
The next level I tried anything was 27.  I was able to train my tinkering up <br/>
to 60, then it stopped.  I may be off a level here, but the pattern of <br/>
1pt/level seems to have held up to here.<br/>
<br/>
Level 28:  This is where it got frustrating for me.  I plunked about 500pp <br/>
making nothing but flamesless lanterns.  My skill went up 5 points rather <br/>
quickly (within 20-30 lanterns), then stopped for the other 400 or so <br/>
lanterns.  Is there a pattern here?  Maybe.  I haven&#39;t tried since I ran out <br/>
of money once after hitting 74 in the skill.  But, at other points where I <br/>
levelled, I would learn 5 points pretty quick, then spend a few hours not <br/>
learning anything.  I don&#39;t know if you are limited to 5 pts/level after 27.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you really need to be in your mid to upper 20&#39;s before trying to <br/>
learn the skill in any real manner, at least in my short experience.<br/>
