<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-698259018">There are ONLY sharks in OOT in the water. They are usually around level 18, <br/>
and scowl, ready to attack at everyone, but, for some reason, they will <br/>
still not attack you, unless you hang around one for too long. They all look <br/>
like hammerheads, but, for some reason, there is no other kind of fish or <br/>
animal in the water. The ocean bottem is rather borng in most places. It <br/>
usually looks just like a totally flat plane, so it will usually be easy to <br/>
spot an abnormality.<br/>
The icean floor is not really as deep as you might think though. You can <br/>
easily go to the bottom and search it for a little bit with a high enough <br/>
swimming skill, but I also highly reccommend a fish bone earring.<br/>
