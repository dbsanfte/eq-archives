<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067958451">I tried it after they put in the tailoring patch for cloaks. Wrong <br/>
cloak. The tailoring cloak comes out as a patchwork and won&#39;t <br/>
combine. They could have changed something since though.<br/>

&gt; Actually, the reward in question was just a small tattered cloak, which prior to<br/>
&gt; the tailoring patch was the only way to get one...<br/>
&gt; Since the tailoring patch I havent seen much activity on the Thermal Cloak line,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;d be willing to give it a few tries if I wasn&#39;t over in Freeport.<br/>
&gt; Gnomads Tinkering site no longer exists, so I can;t check it known failures list<br/>
&gt; either, perhaps we should start a new known failure list here..<br/>
&gt; Gonna take some cash though, those rods are 9gp a pop..<br/>
