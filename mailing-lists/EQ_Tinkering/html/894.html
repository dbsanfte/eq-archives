&lt;&lt; PLEASE DONT EMAIL BULLSHIT ..................UNLESS YOU HAVE FACTS THEN <br/>
EMAIL <br/>

     Does someone have an attitude here? As far as I know this is a mailing <br/>
list to discuss issues about tinkering. Never did I read in the discription <br/>
of this list that &quot;ONLY FACTS&quot; should be discussed. It takes many ideas .. <br/>
some will prove to be helpfull and some will not. Get off this facts only <br/>
kick of yours and try having some fun with it. That whole &quot;search beneath the <br/>
waves&quot; thing turned out to be nothing but it sure was fun !<br/>
