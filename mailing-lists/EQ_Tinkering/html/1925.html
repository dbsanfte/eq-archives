<b>Subject:</b> Horribly Frustrated on Tarrew Marr <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-84104628">Greetings Fellow Tinkers!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently at 104 skill, and so am making aqualungs.  So far I&#39;m 4/8, so each aqualung is costing me about 500.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is that no one wants to buy them from me.  How much are people <br/>
selling these for on other servers, and where? Even in Dagnor&#39;s I can&#39;t seem<br/>
to get anyone to buy.  I think I&#39;m the only active tinker on the server, but <br/>
that doesn&#39;t help if no one wants to buy my wares (.  Should I just be selling <br/>
back to the vendor?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m I out of luck til I can make rebreathers?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all<br/>
