<b>Subject:</b> Tattered gnomish cloack.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679944879">This is the only item we need for the thermal cloak as i see it, but<br/>
you already knew that. Ok i was reviewing the log for anything on this<br/>
subject. In a previous digest it was said that tattered gnomish armor <br/>
is in a quest for warriors. We have to find red 5 and give the black <br/>
to manik compoltn a warrior dude in the hallway that we take going<br/>
to the bank. Red 5 can be found in the scrapyard ( one level down).<br/>
Has anyone completed this quest and if so what were the results?<br/>
btw spyglass is trivial at 68 skill just in case anyone out there was<br/>
wondering hehee. If u have any info on this please post it<br/>
<br/>
PS and enough of this off topic crap we are tinkerers lets discuss <br/>
tinkering instead of enchanter stuff.... i like enchanters and all<br/>
but they should get their own messeage board:)<br/>
