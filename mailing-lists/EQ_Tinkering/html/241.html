<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011128387">Let&#39;s get this straight. I DO know what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>
<br/>
The Borxx lens has nothing to do with the telescope quest.<br/>
The telescope lens has nothing to do with the staff quest.<br/>
<br/>
They are completely different. Just because there is a lens involved DOES <br/>
not mean that they are related. One is a lens made of biological material <br/>
that is gotten off of an evil eye named Borxx, if I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
The others are 4 telescope lenses made of glass, probably made by the <br/>
gnomes.<br/>
<br/>
A piece of glass for a telescope lens couldn&#39;t be substituted with a lens <br/>
from a living things eye, just as the lens of an eye could not be <br/>
substituted with a glass lens (and no contacts only assist is correcting <br/>
your vision problems which are caused by the actual eye lens). That is all <br/>
there is two it -- end of story. The two quests are completely seperate and <br/>
have absolutely nothing to do with each other. So if you want to talk about <br/>
how to get the Staff of the Observers, then maybe you should subscribe to a <br/>
mailing list that is interested in it. This is a tinkering list, so unless <br/>
you have some kind of evidence that The Staff is involed in a tinkering <br/>
quest, then lets drop it, ok?<br/>
