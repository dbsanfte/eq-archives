<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113186964">Yes, it is true. Components used to drop off mobs just as the diamond dust<br/>
drops off Ice Giant Priests now (and had been dropping there since the<br/>
summer).  I have a feeling that if the ice giant priest dropping hadn&#39;t been<br/>
so publicized, as in the other situations, Verant would have let the dust<br/>
simply sell on the vendor. In other words, any item you have seen added to<br/>
that vendor in the third windmill since about September had once dropped off<br/>
a mob somewhere. I believe the helm may be an exception, but only because I<br/>
never found out where it dropped. ;)<br/>
