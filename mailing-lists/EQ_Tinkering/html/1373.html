<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812342440">No  you cant, they didnt fix it in the server patch. I petitioned again about  it but the only one i got an anwser from  was an aprentice guide. And you all   know how much they can help you.<br/>
<br/>
But he thought that when they fix it we are gonna see a msg about it, so keep on petition about this until they fix it.<br/>

&gt; I just read that the patch that was supposed to be this morning was actually<br/>
&gt; already done.  They did it when the servers were down with that Cerfnet and<br/>
&gt; UUnet trouble.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has tried the tinkering<br/>
&gt; skill since the patch to see if the skill cap (I think it was (Level - 15) x<br/>
&gt; 5) has been fixed yet.  I had been hoping that they would fix it in this<br/>
&gt; patch after someone reported that a GM said they should be fixing it soon,<br/>
&gt; maybe even in the next patch.  If anyone knows if you can Tinker outside the<br/>
&gt; level cap now please say so =)<br/>
