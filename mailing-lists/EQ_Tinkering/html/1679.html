<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-948761411">I posted this once before. This is a screenshot taken from some people who <br/>
made an EQ emulator. Browse thru the directories, there&#39;s a lot more pics in <br/>
there. The reason the items don&#39;t change his stats to green is because they <br/>
are merely items taken from one of the files in the EQ directory, they <br/>
havn&#39;t been programmed to give any stat boosts.<br/>
<br/>
As an addition, I&#39;ve also downloaded that viewer that lets you view the EQ <br/>
files, for instance you can listen to all the sounds and look at the <br/>
graphics. The gun is indeed in the graphics file (can&#39;t think of the name of <br/>
the file right now). This is one reason I&#39;ve been so bent on wrestling more <br/>
info from Tergon, the gnome who says he shot the iron pellet into Bugglegup <br/>
(spellcheck).<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;and used the gun in the picture as a refrence, since looking at the pic and<br/>
&gt;site, you 1st notice the guy is lvl 100... umm YEA.. Gotta start looking at<br/>
&gt;that :) Open graphics program and notice that the text was changed, almost <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;the text on this page was change.. other then the message text. &lt;Graphics <br/>
&gt;guy<br/>
&gt;here sorry folks&gt; You&#39;ll notice that some of the items have been &quot;PASTED&quot; <br/>
&gt;into<br/>
&gt;there respected positions, not a bad job thou.. but the smuging is blantly<br/>
&gt;obvious even for a jpg....but the gun isn&#39;t smudged.. &lt;go look - zoom in&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;HOWEVER... that would mean that this guy would have had to goto great <br/>
&gt;lengths<br/>
&gt;to make a new graphic and model for the &quot;gun&quot;, even thou the model info is <br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt;avable to public &lt;989 propritary&gt; HUMM... makes me wonder... even the <br/>
&gt;&quot;BALL&quot;<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t pasted in......<br/>
