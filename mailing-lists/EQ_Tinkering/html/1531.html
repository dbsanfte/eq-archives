<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-405526415">As people began to believe one thing nad become so advant abouit it, they<br/>
tend to become ugly to the point of hatred. People speak so freely about<br/>
what they know is right or wrong without even really finding out a deffinent<br/>
asnwer for themselves. As for the person that is angry about this thread,<br/>
man lighten up. As for right now everyone knows that Tinkering like Reaserch<br/>
is a trade skill. That means that when you learn it you can continue to<br/>
learn with out me capped out on a level. I have read many threads where<br/>
people believe this or that. Then when someone says something and everyone<br/>
finds out it was true they are like I knew that. Ok As far as it has been<br/>
said my BM is that on all trade skills includeing research and the other<br/>
hard to raise skills there is no cap per level. So I believe that it is<br/>
possible to go above actually I have a gnome with 77 and I am 18 that is 2<br/>
points above max. I got the money to raise this from my guild but none the<br/>
less. FRom my experiance and what has been said it seems the either one the<br/>
cap is different or the cap is gone. I do not doubt anything people have<br/>
said but it seems that, there may be alot of truth in some things.</div>
