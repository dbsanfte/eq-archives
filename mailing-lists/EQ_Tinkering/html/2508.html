<div id="ygrps-yiv-239959464">I wouldn&#39;t start tinkering until I had loads of money to spare. As the skill <br/>
looks now you will never break even.<br/>
<br/>
The skill is very expensive (more expensive than jewelcraft even if we start <br/>
at skill of 50) and the only things you can sell are rebreathers, aqualungs <br/>
and spyglasses (bow cams if you find a fletcher to do business with or start <br/>
fletching aswell) and none of em sells very well.<br/>
<br/>
Up at very high skills you can make some armor pieces too, most of em (if <br/>
not all) only usable by gnome warriors and/or clerics. By the time you can <br/>
do this you will have burned some 50 - 100 thousand pp and the components <br/>
you need to find for these pieces are not that easy to get. These armors are <br/>
pretty decent and they look just awesome so when you get there, you might <br/>
start selling stuff again, but gnome wars and clerics are not that common, <br/>
and I find it hard to see that you will break even on it.<br/>
<br/>
Tinkering is a fun skill, there are not that many tinkerers at rebreather <br/>
skill or higher but to make money you should look at jewelcraft (and then <br/>
you should be an enchanter). And this skill is also very expensive to raise <br/>
to the point where you can make money off of it.<br/>
<br/>
If you are thinking about doing tinkering anyway (it really is a kinda fun <br/>
skill) and are looking for another tradeskill to start with, I would <br/>
consider fletching. One of the earlier items you can make are cams, which <br/>
are used for making bows (fletching) and later on you will most likelly be <br/>
making catapults to raise skill for which you will need player made bows to <br/>
make. Its kinda neat if you can do those yourself instead of running around <br/>
trying to find a fletcher to make you like 30-40 bows :)<br/>
<br/>
Besides, bows and arrows can actually be sold at times, and its an easy and <br/>
cheap skill to raise to around 180 skill..<br/>

&gt;If you want a money skill... get into gemcraft.  Gemgrafting is THE most <br/>
&gt;usefull and indemand skill.<br/>
&gt;Oh, and change from Necro to enchanter  =)<br/>
&gt;Other than that trades are for fun/quests and you rarly will see a true <br/>
&gt;profit.<br/>
&gt;I found I made the most profit I made was when I was lvl 25-40 maken <br/>
&gt;Spyglasses.  Unlimited (insta-cast) charges of a silly spell for 70pp.  <br/>
&gt;People would buy them as fast as I could make em.  Not sure how the market <br/>
&gt;is for that now.<br/>
&gt;Tinkering is fun tho...  I still remember when I made my 1st rebreather at <br/>
&gt;like 130 skill.  ROFL.  I was stoked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/gu OMG!  I made one!  I made one!  Rhaaaa!<br/>
&gt;&lt;guild&gt; one of what?<br/>
&gt;/gu a rebreather!<br/>
&gt;&lt;guild&gt; GRATS!  Whats that?<br/>
&gt;*sigh*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That was with my 1st char, a gnome necro also...<br/>

&gt;   I hope that it isn&#39;t a sinking hole trade.  Otherwise I&#39;m out a lot of <br/>
&gt;plat. I&#39;m hoping one day Verant will wake up and gives us gnomes a chance J<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   If you have a bit of cash, make up some fireworks and you can probably <br/>
&gt;get rid of some of them to players just for the fun of it. You can start <br/>
&gt;anytime you have the money, just have to wait until level 16 to be able to <br/>
&gt;gain skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Rebreathers cost 916pp per attempt.  You can sell them for around 2k.  <br/>
&gt;Warriors need 2 of them for their epic quest. But lately I&#39;ve been noticing <br/>
&gt;a lot more items that have endure breath on them so rebreathers probably <br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t going to sell too well in the future.  I&#39;m hoping this isn&#39;t the <br/>
&gt;case. But on the last few runs to Kedge Keep my guild has made, only a few <br/>
&gt;people needed the aqualungs I have because most had some kind of breathing <br/>
&gt;device already.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   As far as skill caps goes. the way I understand it is Gnomes can get <br/>
&gt;tinkering to 250 along with another trade skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Concerning other trade skills. maybe tailoring would be good for you. <br/>
&gt;Most of it up until the later levels are &quot;found&quot; components off mobs so at <br/>
&gt;first it&#39;s not too expensive.<br/>

&gt;   Thank you, i knew it wouldnt be easy but what about that breather<br/>
&gt;   thing. isnt that possible to use by others. and various other<br/>
&gt;   trinkets. is it really a sinking hole or is it possible to make money<br/>
&gt;   at some later date say at level 100 or so. Is it a bad idea to start<br/>
&gt;   right away. im only at level 3.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Hi there, just joined. I have a young Negromancer Gnome on Karana<br/>
&gt;   and<br/>
&gt;   &gt; I would like to know how to be a successful Tinker. For instance<br/>
&gt;   what<br/>
&gt;   &gt; is the most easier thing to make that does not have a high failier<br/>
&gt;   &gt; rate for a beginner. Where can I find the best recipes and such and<br/>
&gt;   a<br/>
&gt;   &gt; list of Trivials.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Thanks in advance Stina.<br/>
