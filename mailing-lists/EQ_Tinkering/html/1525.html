<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-501670732">Actually, the reward in question was just a small tattered cloak, which prior to<br/>
the tailoring patch was the only way to get one...<br/>
Since the tailoring patch I havent seen much activity on the Thermal Cloak line,<br/>
but I&#39;d be willing to give it a few tries if I wasn&#39;t over in Freeport.<br/>
Gnomads Tinkering site no longer exists, so I can;t check it known failures list<br/>
either, perhaps we should start a new known failure list here..<br/>
Gonna take some cash though, those rods are 9gp a pop..</div>
