Many thanks for your information it greatly helped seeing it.  Your <br/>
experiences seem to be similar to others I have seen.  However, I would like <br/>
you and other gnome tinkerers in your situation to take into consideration <br/>
us other gnomes who are trying to tinker.  As you stated in your post you <br/>
started off selling Aqualungs at 500pp and this barely covered costs. I <br/>
myself am at this stage and am trying to sell my aqualungs.  However, I have <br/>
come accross a problem.  As there are 2 or 3 tinkerers who have got to the <br/>
rebreather stage on my server they have are selling their aqualungs at 400pp <br/>
and I find that to sell any of my aqualungs I also have to sell them at <br/>
400pp.<br/>
<br/>
I realise this keeps the number of tinkerers and so competition on the <br/>
servers down,  however, we are fellow gnomes and not many of us are even <br/>
trying tinkering. Have a thought for us who have already put thousands of <br/>
plat into the skill only to be penalised as we don&#39;t have as much <br/>
money/don&#39;t play as much as some others.<br/>
<br/>
This post is not aimed at Flintnilf but at Tinkerers in general.  I am <br/>
actually on Cazic Thule and have more of a problem as even when I get to <br/>
rebreather stage they are being sold for 2500pp and one of the higher level <br/>
tinkerers told me off for trying to sell Spyglasses for 80pp and trying to <br/>
give tinkerers a bad name but this is the only way I can make any money out <br/>
of the skill.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying lets rip ppl off. I&#39;m saying we have put alot of money and <br/>
time into our skill.  Lets at least get some of that money back.<br/>
