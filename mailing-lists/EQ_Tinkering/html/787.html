<div id="ygrps-yiv-270742271">A little bird told me.<br/>
If anyone would think about it...from every lie to every truth I have ever<br/>
heard, the one thing that is constant is that we should &quot;search beneath the<br/>
waves&quot;. Think about the story behind things. If I have learned anything from<br/>
playing EverQuest for all of these months, I have learned that Verant and<br/>
the programmers love a good story. They love to flesh things out, why else<br/>
would so many of these quests be long and drawn out. Think of the story<br/>
behind the cave ad the necro there, he is supposed to be banished there by<br/>
the gods in a huge epic tale, not because of some measly tinkering book. As<br/>
well with the spelunker fer one thing he is NOT beneath the waves. I dont<br/>
know what the story behind him is but come on if it were that easy do you<br/>
not think someone has tried that by now? NO our answer does lie in the<br/>
realms of the submerged, no probably not kedge keep as it is not itemized.<br/>
Has anyone ever heard someone say anything about the battle they ad against<br/>
sea serpents? Probably not. Why? because no one as explored the depths. No<br/>
one has spent an entire month drudging the ocean floors. Maybe one or two<br/>
people were masicistic enough or maybe just bored enough to one day decide<br/>
to go hunt the oceans for things maybe they fell off a boat and accidentally<br/>
caught a glimpse of something that changed everything. Maybe its in lake<br/>
rathe, mayvbe its in the ocean of tears, maybe its in erud&#39;s crossing, I<br/>
dont know but if anywere these are the three likely places. <br/>
I have heard multiple rumors of a secret cave on erollisi island wher you<br/>
push a button and hear some grinding. I have yet to find this button but it<br/>
has been said enough to me to get some of my attention. Im planning an<br/>
expedidtion on the bertoxxulous server for this next weekend to go to the<br/>
ocean of tears and to comb the ocean floor if i have to but if its there to<br/>
find i will find it. Subsequest trips will be to erud&#39;s crossing and lake<br/>
rathe but for now my hopes and my ideas are drawing me to the ocean of<br/>
tears. Start your own expeditions. With enough people looking for it it will<br/>
be found and the secrets of tinkering will belong to us all!<br/>
