&gt;I really wanted to stay on this list and learn about tinkering but this is<br/>
&gt;damn pathetic.  We got people who make arrogant comments and then the <br/>
&gt;people<br/>
&gt;who are even dumber are the people who fill up ur mailbox with complaints<br/>
&gt;about one single email and turn it into a big event or something.  I wanted<br/>
&gt;to share knowledge about tinkering and be taught knowledge but this list<br/>
&gt;keeps going in circles.  If you are sending something that you would not <br/>
&gt;want<br/>
&gt;in ur mailbox then ur just messed up.  Think about it as if someone was<br/>
&gt;sending YOU an email that said &quot;screw that&quot; and that&#39;s it.  It would piss <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;off.  And it has pissed me off.  So I am leaving this list until the people<br/>
&gt;on it can learn to respect the power over other peoples mailboxes that they<br/>
&gt;have.<br/>

ask you this:<br/>
<br/>
Do you follow your own rules?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care one way or the other if you stay or leave.  So why did you <br/>
post?<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, if I stated before that the bait was nontrivial, I was mistaken.  <br/>
Forgive me for being illiterate.<br/>
