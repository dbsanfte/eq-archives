<b>Subject:</b> Collapseable Fishing Pole Ideas <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654081716">First of all, I personally think that makeing a collapseable fishing pole is<br/>
impossible since no books with instructions to make one has been found.<br/>
However that hasn&#39;t stopped me with throwing away a few plat now and then to<br/>
try it.  :)  A lot of people have been trying to make one without useing a<br/>
normal fishing pole as one of the components, which I think is wrong.  I<br/>
think its going to be like making a flameless lantern where a normal lantern<br/>
is needed.  Instead of trying to find some type of string, I think it&#39;s<br/>
going to involve takeing the fishing line out of the normal pole and putting<br/>
it on the metal rod/shaft&#39;s just like you take out the light in a lantern<br/>
and replaceing it with firewater in a flameless lantern.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a few questions about the components.  What the heck is the<br/>
difference shape-wise between a rod and a shaft??  Originally I thought<br/>
maybe a shaft was hollow and a rod solid, so that one could slide inside the<br/>
other and hence, collapse.  But then I went to look both words up in the<br/>
dictionary and they both seem to be the exact same thing.  And what the heck<br/>
is a spriket?  I can&#39;t even find that word in a dictionary.  :)  Also, what<br/>
is raw bamboo used for in the game?  Seems like every single merchant sells<br/>
them, but I&#39;ve never seen any mention of using them for anything??  And<br/>
another possible component might be something I got off a clockwork cleaner<br/>
in kaladim as part of a quest where I had to exterminate a rare spawning<br/>
cleaner in the mines of kaladim.  When I finally killed it, it had scrap<br/>
metal and something called a byzantine pestle that looks like a rod/shaft.<br/>
In the quest I had to return the scrap metal, but not the pestle and I have<br/>
no idea what to do with the pestle?<br/>
