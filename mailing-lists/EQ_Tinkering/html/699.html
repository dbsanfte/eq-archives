<div id="ygrps-yiv-785281368">Ok, lets get on veeshan, find Lindel and find out more. You said this was a<br/>
long time ago, maybe he has changed his POV and will tell us now. Maybe if<br/>
he knows that we NEED this secret, he will tell us... he is on your friends<br/>
list, tell him ill pay him! 1000pp if he tells me! my god, i need to know<br/>
NOW!! ahhhh..well, 1000pp if the formula works.. but you said you thought he<br/>
was telling the truth, ill give 1000pp before it works (if he sounds<br/>
trustworthy) maybe 1000pp is too steep.. thats all i have kinda.. maybe a<br/>
few 100 is a better deal.. Lindel is the correct spelling? ill start on<br/>
veeshan today and find that monk. you said he didn&#39;t come on very much. this<br/>
might mean he has a other character (most likely a gnome) that he plays more<br/>
often. lets try to find its name. For now, I think Lindel the monk is my<br/>
best bet so im gonna pester him till he tells me.. or maybe not.. ill be<br/>
nice and start to cry.. Ill tell anyone if I find anything more out. if not,<br/>
i wont post repeated info. Off to veeshan I go</div>
