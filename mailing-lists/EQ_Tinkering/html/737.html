<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350341471">So, let&#39;s go on the vague hint of &quot;beneath the waves&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
First I want someone to tell me what the gnome in the back of crushbone in the<br/>
pit is for?  I was there when I was in my teens, but have not returned to see<br/>
what he did.<br/>
<br/>
Second I think most of us have cleared Ak&#39;anon as a source for any tinkering<br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
Third, where else do we have to search on Fadwyr?  Dagnors Cauldron (unlikely)<br/>
is the only other prodominant water based zone.  Let&#39;s have a few teams scan it<br/>
to make sure we&#39;re not missing anything.  Look for any doors or tunnels other<br/>
than kedge.  Not likely much will be found.  ButcherBlock also provides a edge<br/>
of water that technically could be used for tunnels, holes, and possible mobs. <br/>
Not likely however.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is OOT.  This zone is huge, and very un-used.  I have searched most<br/>
of the aqua-goblin stand alone islands and I didn&#39;t see anything worthwhile<br/>
there.  The Oracles isle is pretty much just some dwarven smiths, some goblins<br/>
(including one named goblin shaman that is red to me at 31st), and the oracle. <br/>
Most of us however haven&#39;t scanned under water to see if anything exists.  I<br/>
think this is probably the most unexplored area and might be worth a gander. <br/>
Also when you say &quot;waves&quot; you usually mean ocean, not river or lake.<br/>
<br/>
You have water in and under freeport, in oasis, in guk, everfrost, lakerathe,<br/>
eruds crossing, and kerra isle.  So, we have a big journey ahead of us.  Anyone<br/>
wanna start eliminating the possibilities?<br/>
