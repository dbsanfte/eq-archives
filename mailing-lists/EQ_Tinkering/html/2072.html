<div id="ygrps-yiv-481430546">This is what I did.  Flameless lanterns until trivial, bow cams until <br/>
trivial, and then a combination of stalking probes and spyglasses until <br/>
trivial. Spyglasses cost more to make than spyglasses, but become trivial <br/>
at a lower level.  They also seem to be easier to sell.  I&#39;m now faced with <br/>
aqualungs, which don&#39;t become trivial for around 46 points I think.  I <br/>
would guess if the thermal cloak was in the game, it would fit in between <br/>
stalking probes and aqualungs, maybe with a trivial point around 125 or <br/>
so.  Anyway, at 210pp per attempt, I will be working lungs for quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
Also, anyone on Bristlebane that can make rebreathers, a character named <br/>
Shale wants one.  I&#39;m too far away to make one for him.<br/>

&gt;I just got my lvl 16 a week ago, what should I start tinkering first?  All I<br/>
&gt;need is to get my skill up high enough that I wont fail at cams.  Any advice?<br/>
