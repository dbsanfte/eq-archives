<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004826379">A cam?! That is insane! This is just a fishing pole! It is not going to cost <br/>
that much! Even if they never break no one would pay the 30 plat for the <br/>
fishing pole that we&#39;d have to sell it for to make a profit. Anything <br/>
combination over 5 plat is an idiotic price to spend making a fishing pole. <br/>
And if it really does cost more than 5 plat to make, then it&#39;s not worth it <br/>
in the slightest amount! I already doubt that people are going to pay the <br/>
price we ask for the next to worthless toy that we call a spyglass! Any high <br/>
priced components, such as gears now need to be left out, they aren&#39;t, or <br/>
better not be part of the fishing pole.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Last night&#39;s attempts resulted in no luck again.  I think we&#39;re right <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the metal shaft and rod combos but we&#39;re missing something.  Here&#39;s a <br/>
&gt;few<br/>
&gt; &gt; of my thoughts thus far:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Fletching strings or dwarven wire as a component seems unlikely.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Although some items need things MADE by other trade skills (compass), I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t think of anything that requires you buy components from a <br/>
&gt;different<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade skill.  Dwarven wire is for the Trueshot Bow quest (?) and takes a<br/>
&gt; &gt; while to obtain - lots of travelling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Spiderling silk sounds like a good possibility.  Watch out though, <br/>
&gt;there<br/>
&gt; &gt; is SPIDER silk, and SPIDERLING silk.  The latter seems more likely as<br/>
&gt; &gt; spiderlings are right in Steamfont and it would be very similar to how <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lockpicks need a rat ear.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Spriket?  Assuming that the two books are all that exists of tinkering<br/>
&gt; &gt; now, a spriket is the only item not used for any project.  What is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; spriket though?  Not in the dictionary...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Raw bamboo doesn&#39;t seem like a likely component.  It is a bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; instrument, also the pic of the collapsible pole shows it constructed of<br/>
&gt; &gt; metal.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - A bottle as a possible component.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
