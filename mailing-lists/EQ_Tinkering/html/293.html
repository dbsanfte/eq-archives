<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000522480">Well, I will admit I would be tempted to keep the plans secret, however, I <br/>
decided a long time ago that any information that I found, I would share, <br/>
just to get tinkering off the ground.  I do understand how people would <br/>
want to keep their trade secrets to themselves, there is a lot of money to <br/>
be made from the spyglasses, I know I want one.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, I am looking into setting up an &quot;open-source&quot; (most <br/>
appropriate term) web site that will contain all available tinkering <br/>
information.  I need to find an ISP that supports Frontpage extensions (I&#39;m <br/>
not a web guru so I need to use something that is simple to use and has a <br/>
lot of built in features).  I will keep this list posted on the status of <br/>
the site.  I will use this mailing list also as the sites mailing list so I <br/>
don&#39;t have to pay someone $20 a month for that feature.<br/>
<br/>
I know it doesn&#39;t matter much, because as soon as someone leaks the plans <br/>
for the fishing pole, it will be spread around very quickly and Gnomad will <br/>
post it to his site since the cats already out of the bag.  However, I hope <br/>
&quot;our&quot; site somehow will become an instrument to get people to open up (my <br/>
hopes aren&#39;t high though).  Gnomad mentioned his site reached 10,000 <br/>
hits.  That means a lot of people were visiting the site, therefore, I know <br/>
a lot of people are disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
And to Gnomad, please do not take this as an insult or anything.  I respect <br/>
your decision to keep the information secret.  That is your choice, not <br/>
mine.  More power to you.<br/>

&gt;I was asked by someone to make me a fishing pole yesterday.  He said he knew<br/>
&gt;two people who could but they were on another continent.  I said I would if he<br/>
&gt;told me the recipe =)   But he said they would not reveal it.  People know and<br/>
&gt;they are not sharing!@<br/>
