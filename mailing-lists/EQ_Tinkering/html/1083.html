So they are just toys so far for high-mid level people who have nothing<br/>
better to spend their money on.<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t think the book is very high level, I just have very serious doubt<br/>
&gt;that it is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All of the recipies in it are very simple and easy to do and require<br/>
&gt;minimal tinkering skill, but what confuses me is that those gnomes, even in<br/>
&gt;light of the third book being posted, are still refusing to share info, and<br/>
&gt;are still trying to exort extremely high prices for things.  I guess its a<br/>
&gt;greed thing...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At anyrate, doesn&#39;t it make sense that gnomes who won&#39;t tell you recipies<br/>
&gt;will also lie to you about how they came about the third book?<br/>
