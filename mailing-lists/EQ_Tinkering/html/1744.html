<div id="ygrps-yiv-40095518">I have seen the lamp you are talking about. Never found out what it was triggering. It was <br/>
mentioned a few months ago on this list when we were still looking desperately for the 3rd <br/>
book/fishing pole recipe. I don&#39;t remember anyone coming up with an answer about it.<br/>

&gt; I was readin a post, I discounted it as major B.S. but checked it out <br/>
&gt; regardless since I was in Ak&#39;anon. It mentioned somethin bout a clockwork <br/>
&gt; dragon, now the dragon, I don&#39;t believe, not by a longhshot. But it also <br/>
&gt; mentioned one of those lamp, star light post things, and when ya click it, it <br/>
&gt; makes a door opening sound and turns 90 degrees. I thought that it was worth <br/>
&gt; 2 seconds investigation, so I found the one that wasn&#39;t soinning next to the <br/>
&gt; lake. I clicked it, and sure enough, it turned bout 90 degrees, and I heard <br/>
&gt; the door creak. I have no idea what this is about, knowing my luck, this <br/>
&gt; little topic has popped up on the list before, but I&#39;m a recent addition to <br/>
&gt; it. If it has, GOOD! someone please fill me in and quench my curiosity. If it <br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t, anyone have any ideas what it is, cause who knows, what if it has <br/>
&gt; valid importance, this is a long shot, but it may have somethin to with <br/>
&gt; diamond dust. I know I know, there&#39;s a bunch of you thinking I&#39;m prime full <br/>
&gt; of it, but about the little door creak and star lamp thing, I&#39;m not, I invite <br/>
&gt; you to see it yourself. Anyways, I jus thought I&#39;d toss that one out there. <br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s been brought up before, forgive me for my insolence.<br/>
