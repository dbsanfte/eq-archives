<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094888748">Ok we have discovered the gemcutter hurray! As for the thermal cloak.<br/>
Staying with the idea that it can&#39;t be made and it is a mob drop just<br/>
like the diamond dust and the fact that diamond dust is a HIGH level mob<br/>
drop. I was wondering if anyone has killed Toko Binlittle in OOT? He himself<br/>
is not a high level npc but the giant that stands next to him is, 40&#39;s or so <br/>
I hear. Just a thought.<br/>
