I understand this list is all ages but, I have seen 7 flame posts from you<br/>
in the past two days, and personally I don&#39;t need to see some jerk flaming<br/>
people. Regardless of what the issue is about, there are better ways to talk<br/>
to people, learn some respect.<br/>

&gt; reach the limit of his skill so kiss off Thank you.<br/>
