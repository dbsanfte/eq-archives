<b>Subject:</b> Diamond Dust <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-299975601">ell I don&#39;t think Verant is tooooo Stupid and will put the Dust in PoF... I<br/>
would think it is somewhere in Noratth, I been to PoF and PoH for a few<br/>
runs now and never got the Diamond Dust from there... here are some lvl 50<br/>
things I know of that are not in PoF...or PoH<br/>
<br/>
Dino - oot, named Allazuer or somthing like that.<br/>
Another Lizard - this one is in Ferott and its a rare spawn from what I<br/>
heard and I dont thikn anyone yet killed it, it spawns by the Spec Caves.<br/>
Shark(not sure what lvl may be 50 + conned yeallow at 49) - in Lake Rathe,<br/>
I tried to kill him a few times but he seems to kill itself when he is<br/>
close to death or if you run to land .... but I only tried 2 times or so.<br/>
<br/>
and then there is also the named Treand in North Karans (NOT IN SOUTH )<br/>
Grizzelhop or somthing not the Grizzelknot (that one drops the CLoak of<br/>
Leaves) but I am not exactly sure how to spell his name, I never seen him<br/>
befor, he is a rare spawn too.<br/>
<br/>
Also lvl 50 mobs<br/>
<br/>
Lord Erfitii (not sure spelling) he spawns in Sol B drops the Golden boots<br/>
and the Ring<br/>
<br/>
Some Fire Giants are lvl 50 and some Ice Giants also are lvl 50<br/>
<br/>
it would make sence if they dropped them but again I never got the dust<br/>
from them, not once yet and I did nag and Vox run like 3 or 4 times ..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nag / Vox are ovewr 50 so I donno if they drops it or not .<br/>
<br/>
btw Meldrath is lvl 35 or 36 cons blue at 48 (thats the last time I conned<br/>
him)<br/>
<br/>
lvl 50 nec gnome, eMarr<br/>
<br/>
btw, anyone know how to fix Eldritch faction, I never had a problem with<br/>
them befor but 3 patches ago that Mage in the 3rd Windmill is attacking me,<br/>
and so is the Mage Guildmaster (he killed me), and I am not sure what to do<br/>
exactly to fix the faction, killing minos does not help at all ...</div>
