<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805581580">Animated Bait<br/>
1 cork<br/>
1 spricket<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see that one posted anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Firewater<br/>
1 bottle of water<br/>
1 gnomish spirits<br/>
<br/>
Tell me which tinkering book that formula is posted in?<br/>
<br/>
Now these may not be in a third book, but don&#39;t just give up and call the<br/>
grapes sour, little fox.<br/>
