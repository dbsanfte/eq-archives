<b>Subject:</b> Making aqua lungs and what I charge... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667657984">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
With a tinkering skill of 102, depending on your stats you can expect to have <br/>
a failure rate of about 50% on aqua lungs. With a component cost around 225 that<br/>
means your cost would be around 450. I would have prefered to sell them at 600, <br/>
but people balked too much (a lot depends on the maturity of your server and <br/>
how many high levels you have). So, I wound up selling them for about 550, which<br/>
has become a popular item for folks headed to Kedge Keep, and nets me 100 plat.<br/>
However, I have no problem with someone trying to get upward of 800 to 900 plat<br/>
on them given the chance and the &#39;right&#39; customer...heh-heh.<br/>
<br/>
With a skill below 100, I would not recomend trying them yet. Mainly because you <br/>
can get your skill up to 102 with the probes, and you will have to charge around<br/>
700 plat or so for your lungs to break even with a failure rate in the 65% range.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
