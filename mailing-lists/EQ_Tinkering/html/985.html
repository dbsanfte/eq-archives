<b>Subject:</b> Hi <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-481508877">Hi, I&#39;m the gnome that posted the book. I would first<br/>
like to apologize for not being forthwith enough to<br/>
post my name in game or out as I&#39;ve been somewhat<br/>
stalked by upset tinkerers of Norath and wish not to<br/>
be pursude further.  Recently I was going through my<br/>
links and popped on to the old bookmark I had of the<br/>
tinkering site that I posted the book to (as it seemed<br/>
the most active).  I&#39;ve had the book in my posession<br/>
since the first month of relese, and felt totally bad<br/>
for you all seeing you bust your ass just for<br/>
something I wrote off so long ago as useless (yeah I<br/>
came to the same conclusions of all of you for<br/>
fireworks ;0).  As for the burning question you all<br/>
have on the location of the book, just let me say,<br/>
don&#39;t stress yourselves just goto the web page and get<br/>
the recipes from there.<br/>
<br/>
As for some of the rumors I&#39;ve read on this thread<br/>
about an even more infamous 4th book, I would like end<br/>
these rumors now.  This book as of right now is not,<br/>
repeat not in the game.  The recipes are working (if<br/>
you can figure them out) but they are not in a book<br/>
that is currently available in the game.  I have that<br/>
information directly from verant staff. You all have<br/>
all the books are recipes that are currently<br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
Some items of interest that I have noticed in Akanon,<br/>
there is a larger than normal clockwork spider on the<br/>
ramparts as you enter the city on the top level.  This<br/>
clockwork is blue to a level 50! Someone go kill it<br/>
cuz I&#39;m almost KOS in akanon due to killing all the<br/>
named spawns in steamfont (I carry gnome heads around<br/>
for luck ;0).<br/>
