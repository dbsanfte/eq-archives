<div id="ygrps-yiv-499431016">{}I also spent over 100PP without a single point advance. The GM I <br/>
petitioned said it had recently come to their attention and was being <br/>
addressed... whatever that means.<br/>
Until it&#39;s fixed Tinkering is pretty useless. I&#39;d love to make some of the <br/>
harder items but don&#39;t really have 1000&#39;s of plat to throw around.{}<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting this bit. I hope the GM that told this to Focasa is right <br/>
and they are &quot;addressing&quot; it. I still want as many of you to do a /petition <br/>
or a /feedback so they REALLY take a look at it.<br/>
<br/>
{} yes im having the same problem but i know the skill is inproving cause <br/>
when i go see my trainer it has the money symblols so it must be going up.   <br/>
  I petion it to a gm and all he told me was that it should be improving and <br/>
he didnt believe me that the skill is not imporving.  He thought i was <br/>
making trivial items.   I havent tried since casue im tring to save money to <br/>
put into the skill {}<br/>
<br/>
The tinkering skill starts at skill 50, plus you CAN&#39;T train it because it <br/>
is a trade skill, and you can&#39;t train trade skills, you have to do em <br/>
yourself.</div>
