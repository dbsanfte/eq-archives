<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-740573193">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
To settle this once and for all, through experimentation and the witness of many Gnomes, the tinkering skill cap used to be your level minus 15 times 5. This will come out with the same number as another formula that someone on the list mentioned (lvl-16) x 5 plus 5.<br/>
<br/>
So the chart would go something like this<br/>
<br/>
LVL     SKILL<br/>
29      75<br/>
31      80<br/>
32      85<br/>
33      90<br/>
34      95<br/>
35      100<br/>
36      105<br/>
37      110<br/>
38      115<br/>
39      120<br/>
40      125<br/>
etc...<br/>
<br/>
However, there have been rumors that the cap might have been removed, its just like those Verant Bastards not to let us know in a patch message. At 40 my skill is only 115, so I am not sure if I will run into a wall at 125 or not. Probably by the time my skill gets 125 tho I will be a few levels higher.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is this, if your find yourself spending an inordinate amount of plat trying to get your skill up and its still not raising (and I&#39;m talking about 3 to 4 times the normal amount for a skill point) , check this chart, you may have hit the skill cap. If your skill per level is above the numbers in this chart, then its possible that the cap has been either changed or removed.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
