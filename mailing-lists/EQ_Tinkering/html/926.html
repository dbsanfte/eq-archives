<div id="ygrps-yiv-603703537">Its there life, and playing time, if they want to search for a book let<br/>
them. Personally it doesn&#39;t really matter to me whether the formulas are<br/>
found or not. All im saying is if they want to go on a crusade to find &quot;X&quot;<br/>
then it shouldn&#39;t bother you. :)<br/>

&gt;What will it take to get it through to you guys? There is NO damn third<br/>
&gt;book, ANY formulas for items that have been figured out how to be made, if<br/>
&gt;any at all were figured out by trial and error. There is absolutely NO<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BOOK!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;NONE not -ANYWHERE- in the game! When there IS something will be said about<br/>
&gt;it in the patch. Until then , just work on raising your tinkering skill,<br/>
&gt;thats all I can say, doing anything else about tinkering, like trying to<br/>
&gt;find a non-existant book, or trying to figure out a formula with next to<br/>
&gt;nothing odds is just a TOTAL 100% waste of time!<br/>
