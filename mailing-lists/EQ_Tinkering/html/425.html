<br/>
Before taking an extended break from Everquest to pursue a job, I spent <br/>
nearly 150 pp making flameless lanterns and my skill remained &quot;Below <br/>
Average&quot;.  I was told by a GM that tinkering is one of the hardest skills to <br/>
train, so perhaps I am either unlucky, or the skill is nearly impossible to <br/>
train up now.<br/>
<br/>
Fact #1:<br/>
<br/>
You cannot train tinkering using skill points.  I have tried it.  It is just <br/>
like other trade skills, in that you can only use training points to get it <br/>
so far before you must actually use the skill to learn it.<br/>
<br/>
Thought #2:<br/>
<br/>
If the collapsible fishing pole was in a shop, it would have been found long <br/>
ago.  Of course, if it was only added in recently, then it may have yet to <br/>
be found.  In any case, it still doesn&#39;t solve the problem of not having the <br/>
recipe to make them.<br/>
<br/>
Thought #3:<br/>
<br/>
The collapsible fishing pole recipe should be fairly cheap to make.  I <br/>
really doubt that Verant made it difficult, considering it is a component <br/>
for another item.  So, this should limit the parts to those costing 1 pp or <br/>
less, with the total cost not exceeding 5 pp.<br/>
<br/>
Thought #4:<br/>
<br/>
Whoever assumed that the spyglasses were being sold for 50% over cost is <br/>
assuming way too much.  If you are the only producer of an item, you can <br/>
demand a much higher profit return on that item.<br/>
<br/>
Thought #5:<br/>
<br/>
There is no such thing as a &quot;secret&quot; on Everquest.  There are too many <br/>
people playing the game, making any new discovery part of the common <br/>
knowledge base within a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Thought #6:<br/>
<br/>
Seeing &quot;broken&quot; quests, items, and spells in the past, I wouldn&#39;t put it <br/>
past Verant that the collapsible fishing pole recipe isn&#39;t really in the <br/>
game.  I am merely speculating, but I find it rather hard to believe that <br/>
after months of uptime, not one gnome has found the recipe to such a trivial <br/>
item as the collapsible fishing pole.<br/>
<br/>
Thought #7:<br/>
<br/>
This is perhaps the most overriding aspect of this whole ridiculous thread <br/>
about the collapsible fishing pole recipe.  There are literally hundreds of <br/>
items that could be used as a component, and it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to <br/>
make any sense whatsoever.  Trying to guess it blindly is just like playing <br/>
the lottery.  You might get lucky, but we don&#39;t have the hundreds of <br/>
thousands of players needed to insure that SOMEONE gets lucky.<br/>
