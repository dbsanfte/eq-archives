<b>Subject:</b> Its time to petition for the infrared goggles. <br/>

<br/>
Finally it looks like Verant has started to take notice of the poor plight of tinkering. So, I think its time we banded together and started up a /petition for what was once our Holy Grail, The Infrared Goggles =).<br/>
<br/>
We need something between the 30 plat(cost) spyglass and the 225 plat (cost), unsellable Aqua lung. How about the infrared goggles?<br/>
<br/>
Despite the fact that several casters can cast this spell, I think that humans and other &#39;night blind&#39; races would willingly pay between 150 and 200 plat for a pair of them.  Infinite charges of course !!<br/>
<br/>
So... how about this. Put components in the game that cost somewhere around 75 plat to make the goggles. It could become trivial somewhere in the 110 or 115 range. and we could sell them between 150 and 200 plat.<br/>
<br/>
It could happen!<br/>
<br/>
Do a &quot;/suggestion&quot; today, and perhaps we can get them in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
