<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410930291">First the King of Akanon is a Gnomish Enchanter.  He usually has the human<br/>
illusion spell active.  Second,  While I haven&#39;t yet obtained the staff of<br/>
writhing, I do have its stats.  Hmmm must be at home.  Well I can&#39;t remember<br/>
damage/delay but the effect is &quot;casts chaotic feedback&quot;.   This is NOT the staff<br/>
of the Priest of Discord.  He carries the Staff of Discord.</div>
