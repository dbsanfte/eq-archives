<div id="ygrps-yiv-794758950">My ONLY Comment, Is in regards to the stats. Uhm Why aren&#39;t any of them <br/>
green? IF this character existed, and WAS wearing all these things, The <br/>
Stats on the char SHOULD be green. No char could have a base of 254 for <br/>
every stat. Sorries.<br/>
<br/>
I could see a Level bug, like the lvl 75 char. However, his stats wern&#39;t <br/>
wack.<br/>

<br/>
and used the gun in the picture as a refrence, since looking at the pic and<br/>
site, you 1st notice the guy is lvl 100... umm YEA.. Gotta start looking at<br/>
that :) Open graphics program and notice that the text was changed, almost <br/>
all<br/>
the text on this page was change.. other then the message text. &lt;Graphics <br/>
guy<br/>
here sorry folks&gt; You&#39;ll notice that some of the items have been &quot;PASTED&quot; <br/>
into<br/>
there respected positions, not a bad job thou.. but the smuging is blantly<br/>
obvious even for a jpg....but the gun isn&#39;t smudged.. &lt;go look - zoom in&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER... that would mean that this guy would have had to goto great <br/>
lengths<br/>
to make a new graphic and model for the &quot;gun&quot;, even thou the model info is <br/>
not<br/>
avable to public &lt;989 propritary&gt; HUMM... makes me wonder... even the &quot;BALL&quot;<br/>
isn&#39;t pasted in......<br/>
