<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102282118">Gormit&#39;s a big ole Hill Giant in the ocean of tears. Oh, and btw, on raising <br/>
your skill to 53 Tuni...I earned about two_hundred_plat in greater faydark <br/>
selling fireworks for 2pp each. Then I found some guy who bought 80 for half <br/>
price and shot all of them off in front of the kelethin bank (lol don&#39;t ask <br/>
me he did it). Talk about good advertisement! I then sold some for 1 and 2pp. <br/>
I didn&#39;t auction until afterwards when the zone was less populated. I did it <br/>
by people&#39;s equipment...LOL, oracle robe 2 plat, SMR 5 plat, patchwork 8gp, <br/>
etc. Then after that I went and sold some more and eventually twinked a <br/>
halfling warrior in full bronze and then traded a PBB for a shield of the <br/>
slain unicorn...oops...I&#39;m getting off subject. Anyway in the end I went and <br/>
bought enough for a lot of flameless lanterns (and I mean a lot!) then made <br/>
and sold them at a gnome vendor (with good faction) for a plat each. I didn&#39;t <br/>
get through all my lanterns, unfortunately, but I did get to about 58 skill <br/>
in an hour. The other items are nice, but a bit pricey to raise skill--some <br/>
super high level tried to get me to make a telescope. He supplied the <br/>
wholesale money and I failed 8 times before I made it. I can understand why <br/>
you spent so much raising it!<br/>
