<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112761001">Unfortunately this ability is not currently in the game.  It was in beta,<br/>
but was taken out prior to release.  Tinkering is due for a supposed upgrade<br/>
after poison is done near the end of this month.  So possibly by the end of<br/>
September, we might have some items worth tinkering.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] The Creation of Clockwork Machines<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Forgive me if this sounds &quot;new&quot; as i have just joined Everquest Last<br/>
&gt; night, but i have tried searching for any information on the<br/>
&gt; whereabouts of clockwork information, and I havent found anthing to<br/>
&gt; dissuade my inquiry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a Gnome in the 3rd tower with a pet Clockwork Spider<br/>
&gt; named &quot;Charlotte&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are 5 distinct types of clockworks that i have seen: Male Rat,<br/>
&gt; Female Rat, Spider, Female Humanoid, Male Humanoid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Parts for the majority of these creatures can be found in abundance<br/>
&gt; outside Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone tried Merging the various parts to constuct a Pet<br/>
&gt; Clockwork?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
