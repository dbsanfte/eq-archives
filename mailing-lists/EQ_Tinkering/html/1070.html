&lt;&lt; A better answer to &quot;Where do we go from here is?&quot;  we write a petition<br/>
 or something to fix fireworks.  ANd to make the fishing pole unbreakable<br/>
 so it will have some real advantage over the normal fishing pole.<br/>
 Reusable bait would be nice too.  Then we ask for a 3rd or 4th book<br/>
 describing infravision goggles , aqualungs and jet packs.<br/>
