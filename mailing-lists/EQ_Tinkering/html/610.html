&gt; So, I wanted to see if there were any Gnomes that did get their skill up,<br/>
&gt; and if so how?  You can check to see if your skill has moved from its base<br/>
&gt; 50 by going to your skills and checking to see if it is still &quot;Below<br/>
&gt; Average&quot; or not, as average stats at 51.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trying to find a pattern here, GM said Tinkering not broken, I say it is<br/>
&gt; from what I have seen on my character, and from listening to others.<br/>
