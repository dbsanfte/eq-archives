<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090981348">Its been one of those weeks hehe.  Tried to make the event but noticed that<br/>
it was 7pm EST...4pm on the West coast meaning I was still at work :-/  I<br/>
stopped by but by then there was only 5 or so in the zone, doh..  <br/>
<br/>
In any case it looks like a success for probably the first event of its<br/>
kind (hmm that reminds me anyone remember reading about the troll run? lol)<br/>
 With the upgrades announced on tinkering maybe another one of these events<br/>
will help get some ideas on how we might find the plans.<br/>

&gt;Gnomestock was fun, but I have to apologize for not being online early<br/>
&gt;enough to make some fireworks and fishing poles for everyone, as I was<br/>
&gt;delayed at work, and then when I got home, my cable company decided it was<br/>
&gt;time for them to start fiddeling about in the cable box, this caused my<br/>
&gt;cable modem to go dead.  But I still managed to get online about 7:05.  =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For advertising gnomestock, I sent emails to EQvault, EQstratics,<br/>
&gt;Crossroads of Norrath, the Official Everquest site, Gnomads tinkering<br/>
&gt;realm, the Casters Realm, Graffes Wizard realm and I think EQhaven.  The<br/>
&gt;email was sent out 4 days before the event, which was a sunday, Luke posted<br/>
&gt;the news on Wed, the day of the event.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Luke you slacker.  hee hee  =)  Everyone was asking about you...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of those, only EQvault and Crossroads of Norrath posted the email, to be<br/>
&gt;honest, I was a bit disappointed in the other sites for not helping us out.<br/>
&gt; =(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At anyrate, I think Gnomestock was a success, there were gnomes everywhere,<br/>
&gt;in fact, I think it was the most crouded Ak&#39;anon had been in a long long<br/>
