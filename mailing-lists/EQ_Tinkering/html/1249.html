<div id="ygrps-yiv-218839707">I disagree.. you mentioned this 50 charges to 1 charge thing is a plot by<br/>
verant to make things only useful to their original owner.. but if you have<br/>
gotten a observer staff recently the 50 to 1 charge thing no longer<br/>
exisist.. it WAS a bug!! And about the aqua lungs only being ment for<br/>
gnomes.. HIGHLY doubtful. Just ride it out guys.. quit making speculations<br/>
that can&#39;t be backed up. Its no use... just wait and see what happens.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Verrant has started a tradition now of making things useful to their<br/>
&gt; original owner be it by making the item no-drop, or changing the charges<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; an item when traded. As noted in previous mesaages, this is already in<br/>
place<br/>
&gt; with items such as the Staff of Observers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Verrant is not likely aiming to replace the long lines for a fishbone<br/>
&gt; earring with a tinkered item.  It seems they are coming up with a variety<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; ways for different classes to make the journey into Kedge. They merely<br/>
added<br/>
&gt; a way for us tinkerers to journey there ourselves with the help of our on<br/>
&gt; trade skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been to Kedge Keep twice merely on enduring breath,<br/>
