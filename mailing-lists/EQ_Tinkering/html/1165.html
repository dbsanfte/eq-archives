<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467155246">Yes.  For some reason, that&#39;s impossible to fathom, tinkering seems to<br/>
be on the same level cap as Caster Research - namely, 5 * (Level - 15).<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is a bug or deliberate but we should petition<br/>
Verant and ask that the cap be removed so that Tinkering is on a par<br/>
with the other trade skills (Tailor, blacksmith, etc.)<br/>
