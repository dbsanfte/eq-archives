<b>Subject:</b> Re: Question about aqualung ... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947516714">Here&#39;s what I do for aqualungs, and people do buy<br/>
them.  I advertise them for 750 plat.  I tell them<br/>
that when they run out of charges, I will buy them<br/>
back for 200 plat.  That&#39;s 550 plat total.  Ok, you<br/>
get 50 charges from each, so that&#39;s 11 plat per<br/>
charge.  With my charisma at shaman vendors, my<br/>
minnimum purchase price for Fish Gill Extract is near<br/>
13 plat.  So I tell them why buy the potions that<br/>
don&#39;t stack when you can buy the lung instead.  50<br/>
charges, use it just like jboots, and only takes up<br/>
one inv slot.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s my theory.  Jewelers charge 3x to 4x<br/>
cost for their products, I&#39;m not even charging 2x for<br/>
mine.  Success rate is exactly 50% for me at skill<br/>
102. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just have 2 questions...<br/>
&gt; 1)what prices are people selling these usually?<br/>
&gt; (since people all <br/>
&gt; aruond me have told me that they would rather buy<br/>
&gt; rebreather at a <br/>
&gt; later time instead of spending &quot;any&quot; pp on these..)<br/>
&gt; I mean, I can<br/>
&gt; maybe support myself and train up my skills .. but<br/>
&gt; this is getting<br/>
&gt; me down. <br/>
&gt;         (600pp..including 500pp credit for a<br/>
&gt; rebreather later..it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;                   like a loan yet no one&#39;s buying<br/>
&gt; it...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2)At what skill level should I start attempting on<br/>
&gt; making rebreathers?<br/>
