<div id="ygrps-yiv-639649271">In all honesty, I would be amazed if all of the possible combinations have<br/>
actually been attempted :).... but truly never in all of the experimentation<br/>
has an item been produced beyond what is taught in the journals of<br/>
Gimblestan (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering/gimblestan.html)">http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering/gimblestan.html)</a>.  There are<br/>
many anomalous items that seem to be related to tinkering, but as of yet<br/>
wont fit into any of the blueprints.  Hopefully, a new journal will be<br/>
discovered soon on the new continents, as there is rumour of a clockwork<br/>
dragon (which means a tinker is nearby).  Also, its obvious that a tinker<br/>
founded the outpost in the overthere due to the large number of metal<br/>
merchants.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] The Creation of Clockwork Machines<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Forgive me if this sounds &quot;new&quot; as i have just joined Everquest Last<br/>
&gt; night, but i have tried searching for any information on the<br/>
&gt; whereabouts of clockwork information, and I havent found anthing to<br/>
&gt; dissuade my inquiry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a Gnome in the 3rd tower with a pet Clockwork Spider<br/>
&gt; named &quot;Charlotte&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are 5 distinct types of clockworks that i have seen: Male Rat,<br/>
&gt; Female Rat, Spider, Female Humanoid, Male Humanoid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Parts for the majority of these creatures can be found in abundance<br/>
&gt; outside Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone tried Merging the various parts to constuct a Pet<br/>
&gt; Clockwork?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
