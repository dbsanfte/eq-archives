<div id="ygrps-yiv-402981962">They seemed to have nerfed tinkering like they did jewerly. Before the skill<br/>
cap for jewelry was about 250-300 I think. But I know for sure it was able<br/>
to go above 200. So what happened is that people could make more plat items<br/>
because of less failures and lowerprices. They didn&#39;t like all the plat<br/>
items going around so they nerfed the skill to a 200 cap. So now it takes<br/>
10-15 tries to make the higher end plat jewelery.<br/>
<br/>
When you do try to make rebreathers or aqualungs try to get your wis as high<br/>
as possable because thats the stats that helps you fail less.<br/>

&gt;Just to let ya know my Tinkering Skill is at 125<br/>
&gt;and neither the Aqualung or the Rebreather is Trivial at that lvl.<br/>
&gt;The fail rate has not seemed to change much either.<br/>
&gt;With a Int or 200 and Wis of 145 I still fail 40% of the time on the <br/>
&gt;aqualungs and 60 to 70 % on the rebreathers. As for the Gemcutter <br/>
&gt;would love to find the Diamond Dust.<br/>
