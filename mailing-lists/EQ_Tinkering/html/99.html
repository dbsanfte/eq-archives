<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038301371">To the best of my understanding, the Priest has a Staff of Writhing. It<br/>
is a staff you can get in game, but is not made like that. The 2 Items in<br/>
question are the Runed Totem Staff, and the Skull of Jen Tra. I may have<br/>
pelled it wrong, but them&#39;s the stuff!<br/>
