 <br/>
    I am a new and budding, but not in the strictest sense, Gnomish wizard<br/>
on E&#39;ci.  I have recently begun to have a yearning for tinkering away until<br/>
all hours of the night, and am looking for some interesting technical<br/>
scuttlebutt from my esteemed colleagues.  I hear that tinkering is being<br/>
worked on mightily recently and is becoming ever more popular as a pursuit<br/>
for young gnomes in up and coming social circles.  <br/>
 <br/>
What advice and tips can my learned friends in the not so arcane sciences<br/>
teach me about this old sport with a new face?<br/>
 <br/>
I have read all that I can find on the subject and have been both amazed and<br/>
horrified by much that I have seen.  Is it true that none have solved the<br/>
mystery of the fabled thermal cloak?  Are aqualungs truly more expensive<br/>
than bardic clothing attire for an entire year?  Are fireworks as impressive<br/>
a sight as some have claimed?  Have any discovered the other fabled<br/>
chronicles of Gimblestan in the depths of Ak&#39;Annon?  What other amazements<br/>
and terrible setbacks can I expect as I embark upon my tinkering career?<br/>
 <br/>
    Yours in all arcane sincerity,<br/>
 <br/>

PS  why is it nearly all Gnomish names are in punnish?  Doesn&#39;t anyone use<br/>
Flemish anymore? }8-)</div>
