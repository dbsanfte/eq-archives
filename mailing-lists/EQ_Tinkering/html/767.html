<b>Subject:</b> Third book doesn&#39;t make sence... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-761146505">If there was a third book, it would seem logical that it would have<br/>
recipies for things in it other than a collapsable fishing pole.  So why<br/>
aren&#39;t we seeing more tinkered items besides this pole come out of that<br/>
book?  Unless all the other formulas in it are broken.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect this is a wild goose chase, and someone, somewhere is having a<br/>
good laugh at our expense.<br/>
