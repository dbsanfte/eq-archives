<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945993953">I do know something. I took all my knowledge, everything I know, used all <br/>
the common sense I have, and was able to talk my way into a clue from a <br/>
person that knows all about the fishing poles. At first I thought whoever <br/>
knew about it was selfish, that they had no right to keep this, but then <br/>
when I found out that this group of people worked hard for what they had <br/>
found, and are very secrective about it, don&#39;t deserve their secret to be <br/>
given away. I mean, THEY are the ones that found the secret, and yes it is a <br/>
secret, so why is it that they should just go off and tell everyone? This <br/>
game is all about exploration and finding things, and having fun. Thats what <br/>
they did, and they found something, so why shouldn&#39;t you have to do the same <br/>
thing that they did? Why should you just sit back and happily profit from <br/>
all thier work? This group, whom is a very secretive group, whom I shall not <br/>
name, worked hard to get what they know, and so I&#39;m not going to go giving <br/>
away the clue I was told, especially after the rude, immature, derogatory <br/>
comments that were made about me. I will tell you this though. Waste not a <br/>
plat more on trying combinations. You are not only wasting your money, but <br/>
you are wasting your time. Search the world, high and low, search the world <br/>
above and below...<br/>
This is all I will say. It&#39;s been nice being part of this list. I though you <br/>
were a bunch of decent people. Your coments have changed my mind. I will no <br/>
longer be a part of this list as you wish. It&#39;s been fun guys, and thanks <br/>
for all the fish.<br/>
