<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725612108">Hi, I an a fisher and just have to tell you that regular fishing poles fit <br/>
in backpacks already right now.  This is just my guess but maybe I was <br/>
thinking that the collapsable ones weighed less or maybe couldn&#39;t break.  <br/>
They would have to have some improvement over the regular ones right now... <br/>
but being able to fit in backpacks wouldn&#39;t be it.  See ya<br/>

&gt;I can answer that one without even seeing them.  A<br/>
&gt;telescope works similar to a ranger (?) spell (can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;remember the name of it).  It essentially &#39;zooms&#39; the<br/>
&gt;screen so that you can see things farther away from<br/>
&gt;you that you normally couldn&#39;t see.  (Is that train of<br/>
&gt;orcs still chasing me? Hmm better try the telescope.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The collaspable fishing rod is just a regular fishing<br/>
&gt;pole that will fit in your bakpack - as it stands now,<br/>
&gt;a normal fishingpole you buy at a merchant will not<br/>
&gt;fit into any pack making it cumbersome to bring with<br/>
&gt;you on the road.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Any news on exactly what they do or their stats<br/>
&gt; &gt; now that they are really here?<br/>
