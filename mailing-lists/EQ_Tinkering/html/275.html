<div id="ygrps-yiv-490045499">Hiya guys,<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have good news and bad news.  The good news is the Telescope Lens and Collapsable Fishing Pole CAN be made.  And, you DO have to use a collapsable fishing pole to make the telescope.  Both of these items are makeable.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the bad news.  The only person I know that can make them WILL NOT share the recipe!  Can you believe that?  He is a gnome on Xegony by the name of Salvadori, so if you can pry the recipe from him, good luck.  I tried.  Well, also, he said that Tinkering skill improvement had been fixed, and he was up in the 60&#39;s on skill.  So keep tinkering.<br/>
