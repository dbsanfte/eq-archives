<div id="ygrps-yiv-420590770">Yes the firework looks crappy, however try to get a circle of say 6 people <br/>
and make them all cast at once:P it&#39;s a little better, still needs fixing <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
The level cap (5*(lev-15)) still stands, but they will fix it soon in the <br/>
patches. Finally I guess we got the idea through verant that the skill is <br/>
capped, took a while. I suggesst you wait till level 30 before start <br/>
tinkering, it will cost a lot of time and money, and by then you will know <br/>
for sure the skill cap is at 75 if it&#39;s not fixed and some nice wis/int gear <br/>
i hope.<br/>
