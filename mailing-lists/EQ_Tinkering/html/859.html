&gt;e-mail adress but it&#39;s someling lordgrunk or something . He said he will <br/>
&gt;show<br/>
&gt;it to any one who wants to see it. I made a character on cazicthule just to<br/>
&gt;see.Who cares if he doesnt  know the guy personally. The important thing is<br/>
&gt;that some one gave him a collapsible pole to make a spyglass with which <br/>
&gt;means<br/>
&gt;that it is NOT broke.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Quit making claims you cannot back up with any known facts whatsoever.  I am <br/>
sick of this crap.  He showed you a spyglass, big deal.  That means <br/>
absolutely NOTHING.  Gnomad himself got a fishing pole from a gm-quest and <br/>
made a spyglass.  What says this new source didn&#39;t do the same thing?<br/>
<br/>
Until I see a reference to where new recipes are, or find them myself, <br/>
please refrain from such worthless speculation.<br/>
<br/>
When people refer to the skill being &quot;broken&quot;, they mean that the recipes <br/>
simply don&#39;t exist to be found.</div>
