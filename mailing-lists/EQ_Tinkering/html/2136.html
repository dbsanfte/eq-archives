<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_Tinkering] The exact recipe <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-451807519">ok i asked if someone tried the recipe WITH GIZMO #6<br/>
that is what was made with it, it wasn&#39;t made with<br/>
gizmo #4...<br/>
<br/>
if you haven&#39;t noticed, a lot of gnome tinkered<br/>
objects are supposedly &quot;dangerous&quot; like the stalking<br/>
probes for example...read the gimblestan heh<br/>
<br/>
so again, has anyone tried this recipe with gizmo #6?<br/>
p.s. as far as i can tell i doubt this will work<br/>
myself, seeing how you usually don&#39;t stack items..oh<br/>
well if you are that bored pls try it<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Those items did not combine in those quantities.  I<br/>
&gt; did it with the <br/>
&gt; gizmo number 4, the one that was supposed to be the<br/>
&gt; replacement.  I <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t bother with the gizmo number 6.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m thinking that this is a red herring, since<br/>
&gt; Verant said they were <br/>
&gt; going to address tinkering after they did poison,<br/>
&gt; which was due for <br/>
&gt; fixing in may.<br/>
