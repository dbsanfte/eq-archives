<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590502900">Well, actually, there is alot of water, yes, but at least we have an idea. I <br/>
mean, before we were searching the entire planet, oceans and all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Well I hate to say it, but it wasn&#39;t much of a clue.  I mean... there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;LOT of water in the game.  Could be anywhere.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Though one time I thought there might be something under all that water in<br/>
&gt;ak&#39;anon and I swam around all one day.  Didn&#39;t find anything.  I did find a<br/>
&gt;place where you can swim behind the wall out in front of the mines where <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;Necro guild is, but I drowned and had to call a gm to get my corpse out.<br/>
&gt;Maybe I&#39;ll see if I can find someone to cast endureing breath so I can<br/>
&gt;search in there more fully.<br/>
