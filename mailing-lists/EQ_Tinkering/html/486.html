    While doing pottery in Kelethin, I got aware of the merchant selling<br/>
pottery sketches also sold something called &quot;Gnome templates&quot;, &quot;Barbarian<br/>
    templates&quot; and a couple more I think. What is this? Anyone?<br/>
    In The Oasis of Marr I saw the gypsies were selling &quot;A ball of clay&quot;. Is<br/>
this for pottery? (It could be that my memory betrays me, and that those<br/>
    clayballs were sold in &quot;The Emporium&quot; in FP, not sure).<br/>
    Anyway, if you have the answer, or facts on any of these subjects, please<br/>
reply here.<br/>
