Ah thanks for the reminder, I forgot there was so many of those bastards<br/>
out there, and at 39 as a necro I can solo them and have 60 mana left<br/>
after the fight (but sometimes the shit hits the fan and it&#39;s much<br/>
harder; doh!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try those. Wish I could get those damn JBoots, that&#39;s one annoying<br/>
camp.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I was surprised I saw a guy /auctionning to buy rebreathers, lots of<br/>
them (guess he was going to go in KK with his whole guild).<br/>
<br/>
PS: can you make rebreathers with used aqualungs? </span></blockquote></div>
