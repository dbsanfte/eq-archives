<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421744884">Get as much Cha items as you can and wear them hile buying and selling from <br/>
vendors....Enchanters make the best price shoppers due to high base Cha, <br/>
Items they make if into jewlery skill ,and get a CHA Buff spell they cast on <br/>
ya...it helps alot to know how to shop ..Take to heart if you are only <br/>
worried about Skill level advancement not the failure rate,  &lt;Int &gt;Items to <br/>
boost you up is the only thing you should be concerned about ....A stein of <br/>
muggok would help as well as it boosts intelligence  as well as dex and hp&lt;a <br/>
nifty item for casters who use 1 hand blunt or pierce &gt;..Sincerely <br/>

&lt;&lt; wisdom determines your success rate (but also matters how high your int is<br/>
 to be ABLE to succeed) and int determines your rate of skill increase.<br/>
 cha helps with pricing, get a crude stein if you can<br/>
