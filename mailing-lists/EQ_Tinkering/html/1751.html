<div id="ygrps-yiv-202711860">Well, ok my question now then, any necro gnomes here tried Tinkering befor<br/>
say 3 patches ago ? As far as I know i could tinker then and that stupid<br/>
mage in the 3rd Windmill did not kill me at all b4, 3 patches ago I tried<br/>
tinkering again, maken aqualungs and all of a sudden that SOB attacks me. <br/>
<br/>
did any necro had that problem ? sure killen DE necros can raise my faction<br/>
but I really don&#39;t want to kill my DE faction then kill Halflings to rais<br/>
it again, this faction thing is really hard to raise if they con READY TO<br/>
ATTACK, from that to Dubiously might take like 30 hours of killing. If not<br/>
more... <br/>
