<b>Subject:</b> Question about aqualung ... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-488345279">I just gain the master in tinkering couple days ago and have since<br/>
made 10 aqualungs ... to skill of 105 now.<br/>
<br/>
I just have 2 questions...<br/>
1)what prices are people selling these usually? (since people all <br/>
aruond me have told me that they would rather buy rebreather at a <br/>
later time instead of spending &quot;any&quot; pp on these..) I mean, I can<br/>
maybe support myself and train up my skills .. but this is getting<br/>
me down. <br/>
        (600pp..including 500pp credit for a rebreather later..it&#39;s <br/>
                  like a loan yet no one&#39;s buying it...)<br/>
<br/>
2)At what skill level should I start attempting on making rebreathers?<br/>
