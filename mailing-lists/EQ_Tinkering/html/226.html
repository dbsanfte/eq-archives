<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469451392">All the lenses are for the observer Staff.    For sure.    That is not an <br/>
issue.    I have seen people complete this quest in akanon so it can be done. <br/>
   There is a whole guild on the Povar server Named the Harmonium that have <br/>
these staffs from accomplishing the four lenses quest.     granted You can <br/>
also get the staff off the borxx evil eye by obtaining his lense.    But I <br/>
have seen high level characters in the mino caves in steam font get the lense <br/>
from the slave in there.    They do it regularly to keep their lower level <br/>
guildies equipped.</div>
