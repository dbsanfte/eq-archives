<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061839412">Well I had fun.  heh but I didn&#39;t see any fireworks display!  :(  Well maybe<br/>
there was a display, but I blinked and missed it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
At the next one we should all get levitate and go to the top of the<br/>
windmills!  :)  I did that once before, it was pretty fun.  Would be quite a<br/>
sight to see 40 gnomes all crowded on the roofs of the windmills.  heh  you<br/>
can see pictures of me on the roofs at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.juju.org/photos/everquest/">http://www.juju.org/photos/everquest/</a><br/>
<br/>
Also next time we should try and get the news sites like stratics to post a<br/>
message on the news page about it so we can get even more people to come.<br/>
Though I&#39;ve never seen that many people in the akanon zone at one time.  heh<br/>
