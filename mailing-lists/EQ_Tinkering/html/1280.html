<b>Subject:</b> Cant seem to sell the aqua lungs =( <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-331702569">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have been having a bitch of a time trying to sell the aqua lungs. <br/>
With a cost of 225 to make, people just will not buy them, even for a price <br/>
as low as 500 or 600 plat (which is a deal considering cost/failure rate).<br/>
<br/>
They hear &#39;charges&#39; and they run away. They tell me to come back when I am <br/>
able to make the rebreather =( Of course I may never be able to make the <br/>
rebreather if I am never able to sell my aqua lungs.<br/>
<br/>
bah...<br/>
