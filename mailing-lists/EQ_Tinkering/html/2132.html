<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_Tinkering] The exact recipe <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726948601">I think that tinkering is a waste of time unless we have the exact recipies. <br/>
I cannot personaly afford to waste so much PP on rumours and wild goblin <br/>
chases. I would invest my money in all other trades before I would Tinkering <br/>
and that is because of the sheer waste of time and pp it has become. Quite <br/>
frankly the items that people dreamed of sounded alot more exciting than the <br/>
skill as it is right now. However, i am hopefull that someday verant will see <br/>
how disgusting the trade has become with virtually no beneifeits to the <br/>
tinkerer....  Cloverleaf &lt;Fennin Ro&gt;</div>
