Do you know if they were able to talk to Bidl to get the lens or had to <br/>
kill him or something.<br/>
What about the other observatories?  Any information on those?<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; This is news to me.  Well, I will have to keep camping it when I get back<br/>
&gt;  on the game Sunday.<br/>
&gt;  Well, can you tell me where Bidl spawns and how to get the other two lenses<br/>
&gt;  from the observatories? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have never went back there.    But from the conversations they have it it<br/>
&gt;is somewhere very close to meldrith.    When I go invisible back there he can<br/>
&gt;see me and kills me so I never go back there.<br/>
