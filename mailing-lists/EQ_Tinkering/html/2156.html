<b>Subject:</b> Gemcutter ideas <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-797520534">Here&#39;s just a couple of thoughts I had last night. Keep in mind it was 4AM<br/>
and I was running on nothing but Mountain Dew so if they sound ridiculous<br/>
please forgive me.  :)<br/>
<br/>
1. Has anyone tried right clicking the gemcutter on a metal bar?  I know it<br/>
doesn&#39;t make any sense to use something called a GEM cutter on a metal bar,<br/>
but this is Verant we&#39;re talking about after all.<br/>
<br/>
2.  An expensive possibility but has anyone tried putting a gemcutter and a<br/>
gem(probably a pearl judging by the recipe book) in a jeweler&#39;s kit without<br/>
a metal bar and seeing what happens?</div>
