<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961435808">Alright as I stated already I am on Xegony.  There is no need for someone to start a new char just to get into this guild.  I can and will do it.  Right now I am searching for the name Salvador but haven&#39;t been able to find anyone by that name.  I am also researching the guilds that are in Xegony.  I know of 6, the ones that are listed in eqvault, can anyone give me any other names?<br/>
