<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030934223">Perhaps someone out there could at least give a hint<br/>
as where to go?  The Gnome Citadel in Sol?  Back in<br/>
Ak&#39;anon?  The BB Docks?  Somewhere else?<br/>

&gt; I was asked by someone to make me a fishing pole<br/>
&gt; yesterday.  He said he knew<br/>
&gt; two people who could but they were on another<br/>
&gt; continent.  I said I would if he<br/>
&gt; told me the recipe =)   But he said they would not<br/>
&gt; reveal it.  People know and<br/>
&gt; they are not sharing!@<br/>
