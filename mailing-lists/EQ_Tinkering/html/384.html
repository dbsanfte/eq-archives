<b>Subject:</b> Collapsable pole <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838971499">The pole IS in the game, it was found on a GM quest mob and given to Gnomad<br/>
who successfully used it in the recipie to make the spyglass.<br/>
<br/>
My theory on the pole is that it is made up of shafts.  If you think about<br/>
something that collapses, what is it made of?<br/>
<br/>
A series of shafts that are different sizes.  The smaller shafts being made<br/>
to fit inside the larger shafts.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, I believe the recipie is going to be made up of a number of<br/>
shafts, 2 maybe 3, some kind of twine and some grease.  <br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts...<br/>
