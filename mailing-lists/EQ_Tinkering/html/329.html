<div id="ygrps-yiv-316438779">Back in beta i asked a Brad while he was in the chat channel during a period of server down time if tinkeres would ever be able to make +ACI-Clockwork pets+ACI- because i had heard rumors.. but he said no, it would offset the balance to much... Imagin a wizard being able to have a pet at any time. Even if it was a weak pet....<br/>

Here is a revision that my friend and I were<br/>
discussing:<br/>
<br/>
Practical --<br/>
<br/>
1. augmented boots (ex: jboots)<br/>
2. fix cams<br/>
3. lightsource from inventory (ex: lightstone)<br/>
4. augmented armor (ex: thermal cloak)<br/>
5. infravision goggles (ex: heat sight)<br/>
6. clockwork pet (ex: elemental, Charlotte +AEA-<br/>
windmills)<br/>
<br/>
Wishful Thinking --<br/>
<br/>
1. dyeing armor colors (ex: black platemail)<br/>
2. flippers (ie: to augment swimming speed)<br/>
3. crossbow (give stuff to bower to do this)<br/>
<br/>
Any additions?  I separated it out into pratical<br/>
(stuff that exists in the game that tinkerers CAN<br/>
technically do already or should be able to) and<br/>
wishful thinking (stuff we WISH we could do).<br/>
