<b>Subject:</b> Re: Bertoxx tinkering prices <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880804941">I disagree.  On the basis that the items do not provide enough functionality to<br/>
merit a price.  You can buy regular bait, a regular fishing pole, and cast<br/>
spells and be better off than the items they left in the game for tinkering. <br/>
Yeah I made a compass and it rocks for my RL wife who can&#39;t follow directions<br/>
in game, but the majority of the GOOD items in the game that might sell were<br/>
left out.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;only&quot; possibility I can think of is Cams, since bows (although for anyone<br/>
but a ranger are almost cumbersome) are sellable in limited quantity.<br/>

&gt; Maybe its my faction with the merchants but at 7pp i am just making a profit<br/>
&gt; off of the poles themselves.  I think we should shoot for something closer<br/>
&gt; to 10pp for the poles... maybe 8 or 9pp.  The spyglass should be expensive.<br/>
&gt; 75pp seems like the right price, :)<br/>

&gt; Here&#39;s to making a profit off of a trade skill for a change!<br/>
