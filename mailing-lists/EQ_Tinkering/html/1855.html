<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224036749">Maybe one of the good gnomes on this list that owns a tinkering site will do <br/>
this for us? Because it is a good idea, not only the oot searchthing but <br/>
also failed rumours, I have yet to try crushed dufrenite, but that will be <br/>
tried in a very near future and if it fails, It would be good to have it <br/>
mentioned more than on this list so that no others spend their hard earned, <br/>
and much needed tinkering money to fail on the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
keep up the good work<br/>
