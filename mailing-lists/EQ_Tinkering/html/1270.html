<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479773681">Yes... I think verant is still riding their same old no class useless<br/>
fanatic rage... thats why you see gate potions cost about 1000pp, just<br/>
because all the whining wizards and druids (im a druid btw, and they whine<br/>
ALOT, and have nothing to whine about!) think that they will become useless<br/>
in groups... So I think this is part of it, they dont want to make<br/>
druids/enchanters/necros/sks feel less important by making it easy to<br/>
obtain, so then people will think hmmm why dont I just get a druid or ranger<br/>
to cast enduring breath instead of wasting 1000pp on a rebreather. Its a big<br/>
damn game for verant (literally) so they gotta make it as &quot;hard&quot; as possible<br/>
=(. Not to mention that they doomed their own player economy by their making<br/>
trade skills damn near worthless, and weve seen evidence of that,<br/>
jewelcrafters have to sell their items at insane prices because they fail<br/>
even at 200 skill, so nobody buys them. 600pp for a BP ring... hmm maybe I<br/>
can just keep my dervish rings and get a shaman in the party (I know its a<br/>
ludicrous thought but apparently this is what brad mcquaid thinks). lemme<br/>
know what you guys think on this whole trade skill business.<br/>
