<div id="ygrps-yiv-513797529">Amen.   I have been on this message board since it started.   Watching, <br/>
observing, and contributing ideas.    The whitemage has been on it from near <br/>
the start also and contributed his fair share of ideas I doubt he is an 8 <br/>
year old troll.   He simply made one mistake when we posted that letter about <br/>
how he had the information for the pole.   He apologized for it lets forget <br/>
about it and move on for all you new people.   If you don&#39;t like what he has <br/>
to say or any info he has to contribute simply press the old delete button <br/>
whenever you see the thewhitemages name in your mailbox.   Problem solved.</div>
