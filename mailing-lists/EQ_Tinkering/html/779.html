<div id="ygrps-yiv-288184821">Well, it turns out that The Mark was not as big of a bunch of idiotic <br/>
freakish morons as I thought. That idiotic pathetic excuse for a human<br/>
being Lindell really was on the tinkering list all along. The freak said (at <br/>
least he said) that he was leading me along all along. He&#39;s probably just <br/>
some pathetic kid starved for attention. He knows nothing, I bet, he must <br/>
just be a sad abused person in need of mental help dearly. There was no Mark <br/>
I bet, like I said, that little whelp that doesn&#39;t even deserve the breath <br/>
that he breaths is just a big evil liar. Sorry guys.<br/>
It seems we can almost trust no one on the list now.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;If there was a third book, it would seem logical that it would have<br/>
&gt;recipies for things in it other than a collapsable fishing pole.  So why<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t we seeing more tinkered items besides this pole come out of that<br/>
&gt;book?  Unless all the other formulas in it are broken.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I suspect this is a wild goose chase, and someone, somewhere is having a<br/>
&gt;good laugh at our expense.<br/>
