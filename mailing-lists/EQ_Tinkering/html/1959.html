<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738546531">Gimbelstan&#39;s journal mentions that the Gemcutter is used to make pearl<br/>
anaglyphs.  I&#39;d assumed that this meant some kind of carving, but decided to<br/>
check the dictionary.  I was right, but the second definition was<br/>
intriguing.  I doubt that it&#39;s relevant to anything.<br/>
