<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058797335">hello my friends and brethren. ok just wanted to clear up an item or two here.<br/>
#1: when the jeweler tried the combination i had her use a pearl:) hehe as you<br/>
    can see i was very intent on trying to cover all bases as i knew the probabilty<br/>
    of lossing it was going to be high and wanted to lessen that chance as much<br/>
    as possible.<br/>
#2: i have hence sent a email to Fulcrum with a cut and paste from eqcasters<br/>
    wherein Abashi directly addresses the gemcutter as a skill enhancer. no way<br/>
    is the brunt of his answer.<br/>
#3: i saw where someone suggested that *WE* maybe should be trying to use the<br/>
    gemcutter. hmmm this is a distinct possibility but as i only had one and my<br/>
    interpertation of the story in our journal led me to believe the jeweler <br/>
    would be the one to use it, i opted for the route i took.<br/>
#4: i see that the diamond dust has been found on the IG magi. ok after reading<br/>
    this i contacted Qualtz, who btw i feel didnt get the reconigtion he deserved,<br/>
    and he told me that this may be a correct as it didnt occur to him till several<br/>
    loots what he had but was trying to recall the &quot;drop mob&quot; by the process of  <br/>
    elimination and it could very well had been the magi (btw it was found during<br/>
    a Vox raid as you might suspect) there is also the possibilty that more than<br/>
    one IG can produce the diamond dust:) we shall see but at least we now have <br/>
    nailed down a mob-type and an area. <br/>
ok i think that covers my thoughts for now. ive said it once and ill say it again<br/>
i really do beleive the gemcutter to be a dummy item at this time. hate to be a<br/>
procrastinator but this is my gut feeling on the thing. i still think the real<br/>
product will be a container of some sort. after we destroy a few so we can, in <br/>
unison, prove to Verant that we know they havent put the real thing in game, then<br/>
we can take steps to get it rectified. in the meantime all we can do is run the tests.<br/>
Farewell and be well, <br/>
