&gt;Well does your friend remember who droped it? I would geuss some sort of<br/>
&gt;enchancer, but I donno.<br/>
&gt;I will try to find out this weekend again, will spend sometime in PAW, but<br/>
&gt;if it is a rare drop I would imagine the Gem Cutter would be very very<br/>
&gt;expencive on the market and is somthing nice , maybe the first item that is<br/>
&gt;ACTUALY good and that you can&#39;t fine somewhere else, i.e Rebreather is same<br/>
&gt;as Fishbone earring.<br/>
