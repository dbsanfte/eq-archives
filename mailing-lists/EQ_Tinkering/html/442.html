There are data files that mention magician spells called Fireworks I to<br/>
III.   However, their spell level is set to 0 and are not currently<br/>
implemtented.  I imagine this is the reason we can&#39;t make them.  I assume<br/>
that this is due to game balance, but it could also be that they haven&#39;t<br/>
finished woriking out the final details with the spell.  (Wouldn&#39;t<br/>
surprise me with Verant&#39;s track record).  Is there anyone on this list who<br/>
played in the Beta who witnessed the Fireworks spell?  Is it just simply a<br/>
dazzling effects of lights (possibly even stunning a mob)?  Is it an AOE<br/>
dmg spell?  Something else?<br/>
