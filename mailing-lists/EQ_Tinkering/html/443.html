<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538059124">Has anyone found a note that had runes on it?  I read in another post that<br/>
someone found one and the runes were very similar to the ones on the<br/>
Gnomish Clock in Qeynos. (I&#39;m trying to determine where he might have<br/>
found this note)  Perhaps if these runes could be deciphered, they might<br/>
lead to a clue to tinkering a collapsable fishing rod.  Anyone notice<br/>
these runes anywhere else?  Perhaps somewhere in Ak&#39;anon?<br/>
