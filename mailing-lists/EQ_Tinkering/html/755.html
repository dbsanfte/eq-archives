<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908106936">Barbarians get caught in our town, so if a barbarian shaman found the clue it is<br/>
very unlikely in akanon.  Because my friend is a shaman and due to game bugs has<br/>
had to gate out of akanon almost every time he entered it.<br/>

&gt; Hey guys,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the clue was to look below waves, and before it was stated that a<br/>
&gt; Barbarian Shaman would do the exploring, what about the lake outside of<br/>
&gt; Halas?  Has that already been brought up?  If need be, I can take my<br/>
&gt; Magician up there and poke around?<br/>
