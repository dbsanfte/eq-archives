<div id="ygrps-yiv-78635814">Well i started the day with an skill of 80 and a lv of 31, i put down over 1100 pp in making stalking probes and spyglasses and my reward was NOT 1 single point gained :-((((<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This cant be right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was told by GM Caphys on Veeshan that Tinkering is like any outher trade skill and i should be able to gain past 80 skill regardless of my level after i get the skill at lv 16.<br/>
