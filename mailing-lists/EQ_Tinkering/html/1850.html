<div id="ygrps-yiv-119740474">I was reading through the tinkering book that has the aqualungs and rebreathers and such in it. I was trying to look for clues and I noticed something. Surely you have all read this yourself, but I think there might be something important here. The book talks of an expedition to the Ocean of Tears in which the gnomes were using thier underwater breathing apparatus to find the wreckage of a &quot;sunken vessel&quot;. I know that the Ocean of Tears is a very large zone and perhaps largely unexplored under water. Maybe it&#39;s possible that somewhere out there lies this wreckage and it has not yet been found. <br/>
 Gimblestan says in the book that while he was at the wreckage he was mindful to pick up a few pearls for his friend Simpkin the jeweler. Of course Simpkin would use these pearls and the gemcutter to make those wonderful pearl anaglyphs that he was so fond of. Somehow, if there is a wreckage, I think it might just hold a clue to tinkering in one way or another. Perhaps a lost book, perhaps diamond dust, perhaps nothing at all. But to me it&#39;s worth a look. Heck, I can make aqualungs, not like I&#39;ll run out of breath searching, though it may take a while. <br/>
  Anyone who is adventurous and would like to take a shot at finding a sunken vessel that may or may not be there please do so. I&#39;m going to do it, but the ocean is very large and it will be difficult to navigate my way through it without missing an area here or there. The more people who do this, the better chance we have. So the next time you&#39;re in the Ocean of Tears, jump on in and have a swim. Bring along your favorite sexy wood elf, go skinny dipping! And keep a keen eye out for that wreckage, cause if it&#39;s there I&#39;m sure it wants to be found. And if you find it you&#39;ll be the talk of the town (as well as my hero) 8). Good luck to you all, I wish you safe travels and tremendously amazing tinkering skill increases.<br/>
