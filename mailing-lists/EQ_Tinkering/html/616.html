<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838610528">I recommend you also get as much wisdom increasing jewelry as you can. At<br/>
only 57 skill I am pretty successful at making cams. Wisdom helps immensely<br/>
with all trade skills.<br/>

&gt; My first recommendation is find you an enchanter and buy you a couple of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bracers and a necklass that raises charisma (not that expensive for a 20th<br/>
level). Also see if you can get one of the +15 charisma &#39;crude steins&#39; from<br/>
the bouncer in feerot. Having a charisma of 86 instead of 60 makes a ton of<br/>
difference cash wise while you are doing all this tinkering.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Also realize that you can NOT gain more than 1 point in tinkering until<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you get to *21*. You are stuck at 51 until then and I forget what your max<br/>
is per level.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Note, your milage may vary, but the first thing one should try to tinker<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to gain skill is the flameless lanterns. I would usually do about 20 at a<br/>
time and it would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 plat to do<br/>
(after selling the lanterns back) depending on your success rate and<br/>
charisma. Sometimes I would gain nothing, sometimes 4 or 5 points, its very<br/>
random. On average I would say I gained about a point per 20 lanterns which<br/>
means I approximately spent about 20 to 30 plat per point up to 68 where<br/>
lanterns get trivial.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; YES, you CAN make some cash selling the cams to bowers. While nothing to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>write home about you can make some fairly decent pocket change. I started<br/>
making cams at 68 (when lanterns became trivial) and my success rate was not<br/>
too bad. I could sell the cams for 25 plat to bowers, where they would<br/>
usually spend about 40 plat. They are usually VERY happy to find a tinker<br/>
that can make cams...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Gaining skill gets a bit more expensive here since each attempt cost maybe<br/>
 </span></blockquote>12 to 15 plat. But as with the lanterns I figure I would gain about a point<br/>
every 20 cams or so, which means you really need to find a place to sell<br/>
your cams to support your tinkering habit. I was able to get my skill up to<br/>
75 making cams.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; And thats where my story ends, without the fishing pole/telescope to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>practice on tinkering has no future for me short of making a bit of pocket<br/>
change on cams. Damn those verant bastards, I still get an unexeptable rate<br/>
of failure on cams even though they are trivial. =|<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps, if there does exist a kind soul willing to share the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fishing pole recipe I would be eternally grateful.<br/>
