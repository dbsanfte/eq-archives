<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933081945">There is a file in the eq directory that contains spell info. I was looking<br/>
through it a while back and there was a spell called aqua lung. My guess is<br/>
that this is what we are looking for. We might want to start asking &quot;what<br/>
about the aqua lung&quot; to all the gnome npc&#39;s. I am at work, so I can not<br/>
verify that it was called aqua lung, but I am 95% sure thats what it was<br/>
called. Can someone that knows how to use a hex editor verify this for me?<br/>
Otherwise I have to wait until I get home from work.</div>
