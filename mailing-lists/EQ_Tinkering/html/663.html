&gt;   Since when were ANY of the trade skills &quot;worth it?&quot; I don&#39;t think what<br/>
&gt;drives people to learn skills have anything to do with making money (at<br/>
&gt;least not since they nerfed pottery) it&#39;s some other sense of expanding<br/>
&gt;their character. No one makes any money on any of the skills and yet<br/>
&gt;people still do them for several reasons. In fact my character right now<br/>
&gt;is working on baking, tailoring, blacksmithing, and jewlcraft.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;losing lots of money but I&#39;m having a great time. When I reach 16, you<br/>
&gt;better believe I&#39;m going to work my tinkering. Just because I can.  So<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t try and tell me that tinkering isn&#39;t &quot;worth it.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jewelcraft is a worthwhile skill, only because you can make very nice items <br/>
once you reach a skill of 200.  Tailoring is worthwhile because you can make <br/>
10slot backpacks.  Blacksmithing and pottery are a waste of time because <br/>
they make nothing useful.  Sure, that first suit of banded will make you <br/>
happy, but once you develop a character etc, the skill quickly goes to <br/>
waste.  Pottery makes absolutely nothing useful. This has nothing to do with <br/>
money, but what you can do with the skill.<br/>
<br/>
As for tinkering, the only thing even mildly useful is cams.  A tinker can <br/>
produce these much cheaper than you can buy them.  Unfortunately, bows <br/>
really aren&#39;t that important in the game, aside from a way to pull mobs from <br/>
long distance.  So, unless someone discovers a globally useful item to be <br/>
tinkered, don&#39;t expect it to reward you in any way, except for the personal <br/>
satisfaction that you have a good tinker skill.<br/>
