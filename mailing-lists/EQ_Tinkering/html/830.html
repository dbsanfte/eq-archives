<div id="ygrps-yiv-540859552">Hello Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I took out the &#39;ol fishbone ear ring tonight and did a bit of searching in OOT. The zone is HUGE, so I didnt finish before I had to quit.<br/>
<br/>
The area that I searched (and found nothing but a shark guarding a lock box) is the area south of the &#39;sisters of erollisis&#39; isle and &#39;seafury cyclops&#39; isle all the way to the south zone border. I did not search north of these isles or west of them.<br/>
<br/>
So if you drew a box with these coordinates you would get the area that I have searched:<br/>
<br/>
2000, -6000   <br/>
2000, -10000<br/>
-5000,-6000<br/>
-5000, -1000<br/>
<br/>
Make a box out of these and that is the area that I have searched so far in OOT.<br/>
<br/>
I would highly reccomend a fish bone ear ring as you are spending a LOT of time underwater.<br/>
<br/>
I also searched all the water in east freeport from the docks and found nothing...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
