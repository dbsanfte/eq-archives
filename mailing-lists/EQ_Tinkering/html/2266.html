<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569752556">Whoa, now you are using semantics as an excuse?  If I&#39;m a cashier and I tell<br/>
you I&#39;ll help you after I help this other gentleman, do you really expect I<br/>
might not get to you for several weeks?  I think not.  The general<br/>
understanding when someone says something will be done after something else<br/>
is that there is a sequence involved.  2 comes after 1.  No one believes<br/>
that means 2 comes sometime after 1, but not necessarily next.<br/>

&gt; Abashi actually answered it.  He is now saying that<br/>
&gt; Tinkering was never promised to us after poison, a<br/>

&gt; year.<br/>
<br/>
To be fair, he never did say what you attributed to him.<br/>
<br/>
You said that he said the tinkering would be done NEXT after poisoning.<br/>
<br/>
This is incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
All he said was that it would be done after poisoning, not IMMEDIATELY after<br/>
poisoning.<br/>
<br/>
Be patient.  They&#39;ll get to it.<br/>
