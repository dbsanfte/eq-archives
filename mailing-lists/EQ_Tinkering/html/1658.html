<div id="ygrps-yiv-193870541">Yes I know we have a suggested list, and I know that they are cheap to make, but I have been selling fireworks for 1pp EACH and making a fortune.  Since the change to the graphics I can&#39;t make enough of them!  Just walk into a group of high levels, set two of them off and voila  instant sales!  Alos been selling my services as fireworks and high diving gnome - with safe fall looks pretty spectacular!<br/>
