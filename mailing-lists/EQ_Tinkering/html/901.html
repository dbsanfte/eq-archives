<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459086638">I&#39;m a newbie to the list, just thought I&#39;d sum up my impressions of the<br/>
tinkering craft with a bit of humor.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  I really like tinkering, I&#39;m just making light of recent events.  No<br/>
hand puppets were harmed in the making of this parody.<br/>
<br/>
To the tune of the Rolling Stones &quot;Satisfaction&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t get no tinker info<br/>
I can&#39;t get no tinker info<br/>
&#39;Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try<br/>
I can&#39;t get no, I can&#39;t get no<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m hanging by the mills<br/>
And that GM giving me some /tells<br/>
He says he&#39;s sure he knows the drill<br/>
And he&#39;s got good information<br/>
Supposed to fuel my machinations<br/>
I can&#39;t get no, oh no no no<br/>
Hey hey hey, Meldrath I&#39;ve got to slay?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t get no tinker info<br/>
I can&#39;t get no tinker info<br/>
&#39;Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try<br/>
I can&#39;t get no, I can&#39;t get no<br/>
<br/>
So I open up my kit<br/>
But that GM is full of cheese<br/>
Now I&#39;ve lost my only cloak<br/>
&#39;Cause those items don&#39;t combine in those quantities<br/>
And they say this skill ain&#39;t broke!?<br/>
I can&#39;t get no, oh no no no<br/>
Hey hey hey, gotta try the gnomes in lesser fay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I could come up with on the spot.  Thanks to<br/>
