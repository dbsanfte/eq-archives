<div id="ygrps-yiv-767962576">The shark I found was due south of the &#39;sisters&#39; isle and conned green to <br/>
me at 34. Its probably in the mid to high 20&#39;s. It didnt attack me.<br/>
<br/>
That was the only monster I found underwater so far, except perhaps for a <br/>
few wading cyclops =).<br/>
