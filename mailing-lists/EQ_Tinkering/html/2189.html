<div id="ygrps-yiv-252027722">Heck, decay could be even easier than that, and is already programmed in,<br/>
and even has a feature that would make you guard your pet very carefully.<br/>
As I&#39;m sure everyone knows, you cannot zone with a pet, the pet 32k&#39;s This<br/>
would mean you would have to re-deploy the pet on the other side of the<br/>
zone.  Just make the pet have charges, thus decay, when all charges are<br/>
gone, so is your pet. On a different line, you would have to pick up your<br/>
pet before zoning (dangerous if running from a train) or you would loose it<br/>
as it would 32k.  If the pet is destroyed in battle, then you loose the pet<br/>
permanently, including all parts.  Obviously, going LD would be bad, but<br/>
hey, that makes this even more interesting to Verant as a money sink right.<br/>
Just my 2 cp worth<br/>

Simple.<br/>
1. 	Fine Steel Longsword (Item ID#123) undergoes a decay thru a check<br/>
after a<br/>
	successful hit<br/>
2. 	A message is propagated, &quot;Your Fine Steel Longsword has been<br/>
damaged&quot;<br/>
3.	The Fine Steel Longsword is replaced, as in a Combine button<br/>
operation with<br/>
	A Damaged Fine Steel Longsword (Item ID#1230)<br/>
<br/>
To repair:<br/>
<br/>
1.	Place A Damaged Fine Steel Longsword (Item ID#1230) and a sharpening<br/>
stone in<br/>
	a forge with a file and a flask of water<br/>
<br/>
2.	Skill check succeeds Item ID#1230 is replaced with Item ID#123<br/>
<br/>
No columns needed to be added to the database record for item 123.<br/>
Yes code needed to be added to check to see if decay occurred and to<br/>
propagate the result of that decay.<br/>

&gt; No need to keep track of item decay.  If an item decayed it could just be<br/>

&gt; don;t think this will ever happen despite its triviality coding-wise.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t keep track of it, then how are you going to know when it<br/>
decays?<br/>
<br/>
Item decay is something that would have to have been planned from the very<br/>
start.  It&#39;s not something that you can just patch in.<br/>
