<div id="ygrps-yiv-526403820">It is outrageous that you can not produce an item for less than what it <br/>
sells.  How do they expect people to make money at trades?  With static <br/>
orbs costing about 1 pp, there is no way to make a reasonable profit given <br/>
that you must also buy pie tins and skewers.  Yes, you can try to make the <br/>
pie tins and skewers but how many people are masters at pottery, <br/>
blacksmithing, and tinkering?<br/>
<br/>
Well, rest assured, I will be sending /feedback to them on this subject.  I <br/>
bet the next thing I will hear is that store bought cams are cheaper than <br/>
tinkered cams.<br/>

&gt;Greetings Fellow Gnomes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am glad to hear that you are selling compasses at all. In many towns I<br/>
&gt;have come to there seems to be a merchant who will sell them. The merchant<br/>
&gt;is not used often from what I can tell because they are always stuck in a<br/>
&gt;back corner. There is a merchant one in qeynos by the docks. if you walk out<br/>
&gt;of Fishes ale and go to the docks you will see a tall building on your right<br/>
&gt;and a merchant sitting in the middle of a counter that goes in a circle<br/>
&gt;around him.. He sells compasses for 2pp and it seems to cost us 3pp to make.<br/>
&gt;Anyone else see a problem with this? I for one think that the vendors should<br/>
&gt;be selling there compasses for around 7pp. That gives us some nice room to<br/>
&gt;work. I have also seen compasses for sale in the High Elf City and Halas<br/>
&gt;(all<br/>
&gt;for 2pp).<br/>
