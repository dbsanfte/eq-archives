<div id="ygrps-yiv-945277052">The pattern idea has piqued my interest, unfortunately my young <br/>
Tinkerer does not have the skill or the diamond dust for a gemcutter yet but <br/>
there are several patterns that you can buy in the Southern Desert of Ro<br/>
from the dark elf merchants that had no use as far as I could tell.<br/>
They may be idol patterns of some sort I&#39;ll doublecheck today and see.<br/>
Could it possibly be one of these patterns along with gemcutter/stone/metal bar<br/>
that give the elusive gemcutter a purpose?<br/>
