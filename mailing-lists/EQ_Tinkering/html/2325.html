<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Rebreather pricing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233934655">Greetings from Grizer on Veeshan<br/>
<br/>
8-10 months it seemed like 3k each was the price.  Kedge was still popular<br/>
and Fishbone still went from 5k as well.<br/>
<br/>
Today on Veeshan,  before the quests but after expansion I was thankful<br/>
when I got 1500-1800 this summer.  Since the quest was announced I have<br/>
gone back to asking for 2k and selling them to guilds that want more then 3<br/>
for 1800. Then again my tinkering is at 172, so I my failures are pretty<br/>
rare so those prices still make cash.<br/>
<br/>
Like you I would be interested in hearing what people are selling them for.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers - Gesler/Grizer<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;i know many of you accross all the servers that have high tinkering skills<br/>
&gt;have probably been propositioned to make rebreathers.  especially now that<br/>
&gt;they are part of the warrior FA quest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m just curious what a reasonable rate might be?<br/>
&gt;i know it kinda depends on the server, but i have had people tell me to<br/>
&gt;charge anywhere from 2k - 10k for EACH rebreather.  While i don&#39;t mind a<br/>
&gt;profit, i really would hate to be raping my customers, and at the same time<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t want to undercut everyone else.  i tinker because its fun, not as a<br/>
&gt;way to make cash.<br/>
