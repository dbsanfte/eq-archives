<div id="ygrps-yiv-467928055">If you complete the scrap metal quest, it is one of the possible rewards<br/>
you can receive.  You must bring 4 pieces of stacked scrap metal to<br/>
Synford, (sp?) the NPC gnome who resides opposite the entrance to the<br/>
mines of malfunction.  You can get the scrap metal from the two different<br/>
varieties of clockworks that are located near the mills (north and east<br/>
from mills to be exact).  Red V also drops scrap metal occasionally but he<br/>
is a much rarer spawn.<br/>
<br/>
A few notes on this quest:<br/>
<br/>
I recommend obtaining a dimensional pocket or spirit pouch as each piece<br/>
of scrap metal weighs 7.5 - very heavy indeed considering you need at<br/>
least 4 of them.<br/>
<br/>
The scrap metal is NOT no-drop so you can buy it from any player hunting<br/>
the clockworks.<br/>
<br/>
When hunting the clockworks, it&#39;s a good idea to pick up the rusty black<br/>
boxes as well.  You can turn in two at a time to Manik for chump change,<br/>
minute exp and faction.  Although you might not think that&#39;s a big deal,<br/>
but one of the faction increases is with merchants of ak&#39;anon - same with<br/>
scrap metal quest.  <br/>
<br/>
As of this moment I&#39;ve completed the quest about 20 times and still<br/>
haven&#39;t received the trash compactor nor the gnomish glow rod (another<br/>
possible reward according to Alakhazam&#39;s).  Question to those who have the<br/>
rod - are the rods lore?  If not, could they be the rods that need to be<br/>
sewn in the tattered cloak to make the thermal cloak?  Just an idea... :)<br/>
<br/>
The only odd reward I&#39;ve received so far (mostly get rusty weapons) is an<br/>
item that looks like hematite but apparently is some kind of ore - I&#39;ve<br/>
never seen ore that looks like this and I have no idea what it&#39;s for<br/>
(however I&#39;m not a blacksmith and perhaps it is just a common piece).<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
