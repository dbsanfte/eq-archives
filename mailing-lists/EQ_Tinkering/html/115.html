<div id="ygrps-yiv-17071939">I have a question,<br/>
I am a 22 lvl wizzard with a pretty high INT, and so far I made 6 cams, 4<br/>
mechanical lockpicks,2 stalking probes, 5 compasses which are trivial but<br/>
my skill is not going up. Any ideas? Has anybody ever made a collapsable<br/>
fishing pole or a spy glass?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a theory on where other books may be, I think Hero or Meldrath drops<br/>
em (maybe) brcuase the 2 I have talk about mino&#39;s through the whole book.<br/>
<br/>
Well lmk<br/>
Dan</div>
