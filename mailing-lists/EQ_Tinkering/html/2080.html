&gt; &gt; Does this sound like the guy is pulling my leg?  Wisdom of 80 and<br/>
&gt; &gt; succeeding 75% versus wisdom of 153 and succeeding 60%?  And not raising<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill on 100 attempts with INT of 200 versus raising skill 4 points with<br/>
&gt; &gt; INT of 156.  What you think?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The first is not too unbelievable, considering Abashi stated that no stats<br/>
&gt; have any effect on your chance of a skill succeeding. The second sounds a<br/>
&gt; little bogus though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you believe every thing that Abashi Says? If So I fill sorry for you. He<br/>
has Stated before that he WILL NOT say what stats do effect that we should<br/>
figure that out ourselves so what makes you think he means what he says when<br/>
he states that stats don&#39;t effect skill Succeeding? Sorry not a Flame just<br/>
wanting you to Realize that all of what Abasi Says is not true.<br/>
