<div id="ygrps-yiv-882554579">I am level 31 with a maxed out swimming skill.  There is nothing in that deep<br/>
hole, it just dead-ends.  I haven&#39;t tried bumping around to see if the walls<br/>
are secret however.  To get my skill maxed I have swam ALL around the Ak&#39;anon<br/>
underground sea, specifically looking for tunnels or any hidden routes.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t find anything special.  I am however in Ak&#39;anon as we speak and will<br/>
look around when I get home, if the wife permits. ;)<br/>

&gt; Akanon by the mines.  I tried swimming to the bottom as a newbie, but didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have the air.  Later, once my swimming was at a reasonable level, I did make<br/>
&gt; it down and tried swimming into the walls in all directions.  I was really<br/>
&gt; looking for a passage or something like that.  If anything was lying on the<br/>
&gt; ground and didn&#39;t stand out, I could easily have missed it.  Anyway, it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; bit strange for the &#39;abyss&#39; to be there without a purpose.  Well lets hope<br/>
&gt; it isn&#39;t just a newbie deathtrap.<br/>
