<b>Subject:</b> Skill Cap <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-608119672">As far as skill cap goes, I&#39;ll just let you all know that it USED to be<br/>
capped at (level - 15) * 5. But Verant has recently either removed the skill<br/>
cap or changed it. How do I know this? Because I have been level 30 for<br/>
about a month and a half now, and I have been tinkering a whole lot in that<br/>
time. I was stuck for the longest time at 75 skill. I don&#39;t just think I was<br/>
stuck, I know I was because I made over 150 spyglasses after I was already<br/>
at 75 skill and I didn&#39;t get a single skill point increase. I was selling<br/>
the spyglasses for between 70pp and 100pp and I sold over 150 of them,<br/>
making me become one of the richest level 30 players I know. I didn&#39;t care<br/>
much about the skill cap or being able to make aqualungs or even leveling, I<br/>
was raking in the dough and that was all that I cared about. Well last week<br/>
while I was making more spyglasses to sell my skill level suddenly increased<br/>
to 76 and I was completely astonished! I then proceeded to spend a few<br/>
thousand platinum on spyglasses and stalking probes and a few painstaking<br/>
hours later I was a master tinkerer. My skill is now 103 and I have<br/>
attempted 6 aqualungs. I have made 3 out of those 6 attempts.<br/>
  In my experience, I believe it is possible that tinkering MAY now be<br/>
capped at Level * 5 - 13 (maybe not), but it used to be capped at (level -<br/>
15) * 5. I do know though that it is no longer capped at (level - 15) * 5.<br/>
