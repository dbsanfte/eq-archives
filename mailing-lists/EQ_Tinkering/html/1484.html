the list, but now how do I remove myself?<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; It had an axe graphic I was there and he charmed him maybe a week ago,<br/>
weekend<br/>
&gt; sometime.  The person who looted it never mentioned it not being the exe<br/>
axe and<br/>
&gt; this is the first time I have ever heard of a critter not having a graphic<br/>
for a<br/>
&gt; weapon it has, it was also my second time in lower guk.  As for the pet<br/>
thing it<br/>
&gt; may have been a fluke I don&#39;t know as I don&#39;t play anything that uses pets<br/>
so I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t tell you, but I did clearly see from the executioner &quot;guarding with<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; life oh splendid one&quot; Mersinaz even laughed because we didn&#39;t know what he<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; doing at first.  AND WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO INSULT ME AT LEAST GET THE NAME<br/>
&gt; SPELLED RIGHT!!!!   As for the pets I am pretty sure the guy who has the<br/>
&gt; information attained it though illegal methods because he seems very<br/>
greasy and<br/>
&gt; probably won&#39;t ever tell me but I am gonna try and when I get it the<br/>
person who<br/>
&gt; doubted me doesn&#39;t have to use it<br/>

&gt; by the way congratulations Piip on 34<br/>
