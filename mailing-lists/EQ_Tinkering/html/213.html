<b>Subject:</b> Bidl Frugin, Feddi Dooger and cams <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625833830">On the 4 lens quest:<br/>
You don&#39;t have to kill the DE to get the lens, you can play a card game<br/>
with her if you buy her a brew or something along the lines (forgot where I<br/>
read this)<br/>
<br/>
Bidl is in the Steamfont Mino mines, you will be told this when asked to<br/>
find him.  I suspect he&#39;s either a rare spawn or a at low level which the<br/>
minos will slaughter him easily.<br/>
<br/>
After that I suspect the two other NPCs will give you their lenses once you<br/>
have the first two in possesion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Feddi Dooger spawns ocassionaly on the hill and drops a &#39;Butcher Knife&#39;<br/>
Its the same stats as a rusty dagger but says LORE ITEM so I highly suspect<br/>
it is part of a quest.  For what though, I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
