<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328555312">I thinke one cool thing about Tinkered pets would be maybe not even for<br/>
fighting but maybe have it like a pack animal or soemthing. Say you big MEch<br/>
spider that is like a 20 slot back pack that can hold alot of Items. Have it<br/>
have no attack ability and just carry stuff and if you die it stands buy<br/>
your body also make it zone with you it wouldn&#39;t take much. Or how about the<br/>
ability to make a portable House a little building big enough for you that<br/>
you can rest in that is just a fare thing but the pet idea would be neat or<br/>
maybe have differnet pets one that gaurds you like a gnome gaurd or one to<br/>
ride so you wont lose stamina many ideas but yes it would make gnomes a<br/>
little stronger but there are ways to make it even just have to work it out<br/>
say if you had the back pack animal you it takes time to go through it or if<br/>
it dies you loose your stuff. If it is a gaurd it can only go about 10 feet<br/>
from you and gaurd from being rushed een better make it so you can give<br/>
these pets to other people there fore it will make tinkering profitable but<br/>
this is just my 2cp thanks for listening.<br/>
