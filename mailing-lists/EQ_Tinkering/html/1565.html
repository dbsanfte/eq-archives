<div id="ygrps-yiv-270330481"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ok has anyone actually seen a tattered cloak<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ruined wolf pelt + cloak pattern in a tailoring kit = small tattered cloak<br/>
<br/>
All the rumors of getting it from the Manik quest were becasue the cloak pattern<br/>
is only a recent addition, and previously it was impossible to make a tattered<br/>
cloak, only get one as a reward for a quest..</div>
