<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436652429">I assumed the same thing but I was confused as to how he shrunk himself<br/>
considering that is a shaman-only spell.  If a gnome enchanter was to<br/>
illusion him/herself as a human, he/she would be full size.  <br/>
<br/>
One question I have to you enchanter folks - does the illusion ever run<br/>
off?  If so - then wouldn&#39;t the King periodically have to recast the<br/>
illusion?  <br/>
<br/>
Hehe perhaps if someone killed him, he would drop a item that would have<br/>
&quot;shrinked illusion&quot; as an effect.  I for one am not about to attempt it<br/>
however.  I like having a &quot;kindly&quot; faction to my own king. :)<br/>
