 </span></blockquote>Yes, and here is what information I gained from that attempt. I did not find <br/>
Salvador (thats not his name, but I know it&#39;s something like that) online, <br/>
but I did a who 40-50 gnome all serch to see if any of them were his <br/>
friends. It turns out, the first guy I talked to was his friend, or used to <br/>
be rather (they seem to have had a fight) He said Salvador hadn&#39;t been on <br/>
for a long time, but he had been acting strange before he left. He said that <br/>
Salvador would be the kind of person that would do something like find a <br/>
secret that he could make pofit off of, then keep it to himself, but his <br/>
friend said he had no knowledge that Salvador had ever been making <br/>
collapsible fishing poles, or spy glasses. He also said it was very unlikely <br/>
that he could have found out the recipe also, since Salvador never was <br/>
interested in tinkering. That was the information I was able to gather from <br/>
that expedition.<br/>
