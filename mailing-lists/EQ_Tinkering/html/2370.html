 </span></blockquote>Somewhere around 45 money became a nonissue. I had most that I wanted, the <br/>
rest was loot or trade only or was silly expensive. Highest I have ever seen <br/>
is 8k but I buy things for friends often as well so money never stays long. I <br/>
still stay at 5k or so avg but if I would sell items rather than give them <br/>
away to friends I would alwyas have lots more :)</div>
