<div id="ygrps-yiv-140431783">Agreed - Wisdom helps determine how often you fail at making an item and<br/>
Intelligence helps determine how often you will gain a skill level.  A<br/>
nice balance of attribute increases for both WIS and INT will help you out<br/>
quite a bit.  If you have an high level Enchanter or Shamen friend, have<br/>
them boost your Int, Wis and Chr before attempting any trade skills.<br/>

&gt; I recommend you also get as much wisdom increasing jewelry as you can.<br/>
&gt; At<br/>
&gt; only 57 skill I am pretty successful at making cams. Wisdom helps<br/>
&gt; immensely<br/>
&gt; with all trade skills.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My first recommendation is find you an enchanter and buy you a couple<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; bracers and a necklass that raises charisma (not that expensive for a<br/>
&gt; 20th<br/>
&gt; level). Also see if you can get one of the +15 charisma &#39;crude steins&#39;<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; the bouncer in feerot. Having a charisma of 86 instead of 60 makes a ton<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; difference cash wise while you are doing all this tinkering.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also realize that you can NOT gain more than 1 point in tinkering<br/>
&gt; until<br/>
&gt; you get to *21*. You are stuck at 51 until then and I forget what your<br/>
&gt; max<br/>
&gt; is per level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Note, your milage may vary, but the first thing one should try to<br/>
&gt; tinker<br/>
&gt; to gain skill is the flameless lanterns. I would usually do about 20 at<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; time and it would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 plat to<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; (after selling the lanterns back) depending on your success rate and<br/>
&gt; charisma. Sometimes I would gain nothing, sometimes 4 or 5 points, its<br/>
&gt; very<br/>
&gt; random. On average I would say I gained about a point per 20 lanterns<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; means I approximately spent about 20 to 30 plat per point up to 68 where<br/>
&gt; lanterns get trivial.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; YES, you CAN make some cash selling the cams to bowers. While nothing<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; write home about you can make some fairly decent pocket change. I<br/>
&gt; started<br/>
&gt; making cams at 68 (when lanterns became trivial) and my success rate was<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; too bad. I could sell the cams for 25 plat to bowers, where they would<br/>
&gt; usually spend about 40 plat. They are usually VERY happy to find a<br/>
&gt; tinker<br/>
&gt; that can make cams...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gaining skill gets a bit more expensive here since each attempt cost<br/>
&gt; maybe<br/>
&gt; 12 to 15 plat. But as with the lanterns I figure I would gain about a<br/>
&gt; point<br/>
&gt; every 20 cams or so, which means you really need to find a place to sell<br/>
&gt; your cams to support your tinkering habit. I was able to get my skill up<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; 75 making cams.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And thats where my story ends, without the fishing pole/telescope to<br/>
&gt; practice on tinkering has no future for me short of making a bit of<br/>
&gt; pocket<br/>
&gt; change on cams. Damn those verant bastards, I still get an unexeptable<br/>
&gt; rate<br/>
&gt; of failure on cams even though they are trivial. =|<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope this helps, if there does exist a kind soul willing to share the<br/>
&gt; fishing pole recipe I would be eternally grateful.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>
