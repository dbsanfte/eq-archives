<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857919147">No kidding, especially don&#39;t count on information from guides. They are<br/>
nothing but regular players such as you and I. They don&#39;t get any inside<br/>
information. I know this because my best friend in real life is a guide on<br/>
EQ. They are really nothing more than a filter for stupid questions.<br/>

&gt; How do you know Josh? Are you one of Verant&#39;s game designers, planners,<br/>
&gt; programmers, or developers?  Are you related to any of them and they have<br/>
told<br/>
&gt; you this is a fact?  Or are you as ignorant as the rest of us and just<br/>
going by<br/>
&gt; what someone told you?<br/>
&gt; There are enough rumors and disinformation about the 3rd book, collapsible<br/>
&gt; fishing pole, and fireworks going around that I wonder if anyone on any<br/>
server<br/>
&gt; really has solid information.  Until I recieve some word by an Everquest<br/>
&gt; programmer or developer I&#39;m keeping my mind open.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t count any information you have been told by the guides or GM&#39;s as<br/>
&gt; factual.  None of them created this game.<br/>

&gt; &gt; What will it take to get it through to you guys? There is NO damn third<br/>
&gt; &gt; book, ANY formulas for items that have been figured out how to be made,<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; &gt; any at all were figured out by trial and error. There is absolutely NO<br/>
BOOK!<br/>
&gt; &gt; NONE not -ANYWHERE- in the game! When there IS something will be said<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; &gt; it in the patch. Until then , just work on raising your tinkering skill,<br/>
&gt; &gt; thats all I can say, doing anything else about tinkering, like trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find a non-existant book, or trying to figure out a formula with next to<br/>
&gt; &gt; nothing odds is just a TOTAL 100% waste of time!<br/>
