<div id="ygrps-yiv-27088281">Duster V is still a rare spawn around the enterence.<br/>
Duster X now only spawns once you turn in the report, he spawns down by the<br/>
tinkering merchant, and doesnt wander anymore, he just stands in place.<br/>
I did this quest once (and am waiting for Duster V to do it again) and got the<br/>
Bootstrutters Pack, 10slot backpack with 10% weight reduction..<br/>
A lot of the junk that you used to get for this quest (back when Dustre X was a<br/>
wandering rare spawn) can now also be gotten by turning in scrap metal from<br/>
rogues to Sanfryd Feathertop (who used to be called Sanfryd somethingelse).<br/>
Amongst the normal lanterns/shield junk you can also get gnomish glow rods, and<br/>
chunks of metal ore that look like balls instead of bricks...<br/>
<br/>
Getting the duster report seems to be less common than it used to be as well - I<br/>
get the Red V report a lot more now, previously it was the other way around..</div>
