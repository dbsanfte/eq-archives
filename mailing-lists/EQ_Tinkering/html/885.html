<b>Subject:</b> Re: Collapsable Fishing Pole <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640398901">In the picture of the pole that was up at the cazic-thule corner the pole has 6<br/>
sections..<br/>
The pole could therefore be 6 metal rods + 2 other items :) (Toolbox has 8 slots<br/>
if I recall).. Perhaps 6 rods, metal twine, and some sort of gear for the round<br/>
thingy that winds the twine (yeah I know, I dont fish IRL). Just a thought, as<br/>
all the attempts that i saw on the pole database cap out at 3-4 rods, it might<br/>
be worth a try :)<br/>

&lt;I am in now way responsible for the next part of the message, I wish they&#39;d<br/>
make it less ostentatious&gt;<br/>
