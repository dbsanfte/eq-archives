<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034309374">Ok I know I&#39;ve only been on this list for about a month now and don&#39;t really <br/>
know about the arguments that are going on with this list.  Personally I <br/>
don&#39;t care either the man gave us a clue that has started everyone <br/>
searching.  What else were you guys doing?  Nothing but searching, at least <br/>
now you have a clue to go along with it.  And whoever keeps telling the <br/>
troll that he has seen numerous messages from him that have amounted to <br/>
nothing, well the past three that I have seen from you contain absolutley <br/>
nothing to do with tinkering either.  My advice is let&#39;s just tinker and <br/>
keep the personal shit out of this damn list because I am sick and tired of <br/>
reading stupid e-mails that try to degrade someone that is trying to help <br/>
us.  To the troll if they keep giving you garbage get off this list but <br/>
first get the e-mails of all the people that are behind you and just send <br/>
them the information.  That way you&#39;ll weed out all the nonsense that is <br/>
going on here.<br/>
