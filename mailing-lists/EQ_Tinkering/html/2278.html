<div id="ygrps-yiv-228707359">I&#39;m at about 78/127 in making aqualungs, and 5/12 on<br/>
making rebreathers.  Do some quick math..  I keep<br/>
records on exactly how much I spend per try, and how<br/>
much I succeed and fail.  The rates aren&#39;t all *too*<br/>
bad, but the cost associated is off the deep end.<br/>
<br/>
at 225 plat/try on lungs, I&#39;ve spent about 28.5k plat<br/>
in attempts<br/>
<br/>
at 997 plat/try on rebs, I&#39;ve spent about 11.9k plat<br/>
in attempts<br/>
<br/>
I know you can get to 175 smithing with about 700 to<br/>
1k plat..  TOTAL<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve given up on making any tinkered items (unless<br/>
someone pays for the parts up front) until they<br/>
address the cost/output issues..  it&#39;s disgusting that<br/>
we can make a whopping 2 items which increase our<br/>
skill past 104.<br/>

&gt; cash, it takes too much <br/>

&gt; schedule a meeting with my foot and and the trade<br/>

&gt; don&#39;t know about all of yall, but it&#39;s a little<br/>
&gt; frustrating trying to raise <br/>
&gt; skill this way. <br/>
