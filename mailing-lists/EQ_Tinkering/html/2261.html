<div id="ygrps-yiv-234227587">Yup, been that way for awhile now.  Varant may think it&#39;s cute or obvious to<br/>
make the gnome king a clockwork, but I think it&#39;s rather lame.  Especially a<br/>
King who won&#39;t even talk to ya, unless you give him something ... then he&#39;ll<br/>
say Thanks.  I also miss the giant gnome at the mills.  Non-tinkering issue,<br/>
but wanted to voice my dislike of our Tin-King. &gt;:-[<br/>

&gt; Your link is dead - but if you&#39;re refering to the fact that he&#39;s know a<br/>
&gt; clockwork - that WAS Verant&#39;s fix.  I have no clue why they can&#39;t make him<br/>
&gt; a Gnome...<br/>

Ack.  My bad.  Link is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cws.org/~pasketti/pics/pask-ack.jpg">http://www.cws.org/~pasketti/pics/pask-ack.jpg</a><br/>

Yes, that&#39;s what I was referring to.  I was expecting to see the small human<br/>
there, so it was quite a shock.<br/>
