<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087848223">OK thats it guys we need to power lvl ourselves to 50 take 10 of us with a <br/>
good mix and 2 clerics over ther and kill that little necro till he drops the <br/>
book... if he has the book.  I have begged different gm&#39;s for any kind of a  <br/>
hint and I did it rather well. In character, nothing no hint at all they will <br/>
not someone has to know someone that can help, if it is that necro that drops <br/>
it.. that is soo wrong by verant, cons red to lvl 46... that is just wrong <br/>
anyway just wanted to throw in my 2 cents.</div>
