&gt;that trivials at 50.  When I hit 16, probably in the next week or so, I can<br/>
&gt;settle this.  According to one of you, I should max out at 55.  According <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;the other, I should max out at 67.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, at 16 you will gain nothing.  At 17 you will gain 1 point.  For a few <br/>
levels afterwards, you gain a point.  Then magically, you can start gaining <br/>
5 points per level.  The skill isn&#39;t worth training til level 30 or so.</div>
