<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571189518">Well, i thought i would just bring this up. First of all, guides are <br/>
volunteer players, who have characters of their own, and play EQ just like <br/>
the rest of us. If they are told everything there is to know about the game <br/>
when they become a guide, there would be players, who knew everything there <br/>
is to know, like tinkering recipes, for example. The other possibility is, <br/>
they don&#39;t tell them to much at all, that would make more sense, and it <br/>
would also mean that most guides, or rather, all of them, except a rare few, <br/>
actually have no clue about tinkering. This would explain why they <br/>
contradict themselves so much. The people in charge at verant are more <br/>
likely to tell the guides to just say tinkering works fine, as apposed to <br/>
tell them its broken, becaues they probably don&#39;t want to tell them why its <br/>
broken, or what parts are broken, or more precisly, what parts aren&#39;t <br/>
broken. Whether they tell guides about every little detail of the game or <br/>
not, either way, it explains some things that we havn&#39;t figured out, maybe <br/>
Salvidori is a guide on a different server, maybe he got lucky, maybe the <br/>
guides don&#39;t know, or care enough to do much explaining so they just tell us <br/>
tinkering is just dandy. Either way, it would explain a lot.</div>
