<b>Subject:</b> Tinkering skill increase? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-834448311">This may be an odd question, but has anyone SEEN their tinkering skill<br/>
increase?  I have made like 70 lanterns, 20 compasses, some lockpicks, but<br/>
have never seen my skill increase like other trade skills.  I fact I spent<br/>
an hour yesterday just making lanterns.  I attempted to make 36 of them<br/>
(made like 32), but never say any comments about my skill increasing.  Are<br/>
we wasting our time on practice?<br/>
<br/>
(Could someone send me a quick Email not as to if they got this message or<br/>
not?  Not sure if my messages appear in digest mode and want to make sure<br/>
I&#39;m getting out to the world  ;)<br/>
