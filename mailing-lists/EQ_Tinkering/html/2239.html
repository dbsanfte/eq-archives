type of quest they could implement.  This was not a real quest.<br/>

&gt;Hello there! I haven&#39;t seen you around these parts have I? We don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt;many visitors around here.. must be the goblins that scare people<br/>
&gt;away.  They aren&#39;t the greatest fellows but at least you can trade with<br/>
&gt;them.  There&#39;s this one that sells cloaks that they make.. Rather nice<br/>
&gt;fitting on us gnomes.  I would love to have one to replace this [tattered<br/>
&gt;gnomish cloak].<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/say What tattered gnomish cloak?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/say What cloak? This old rag hanging off my back.  The goblin that sells<br/>
&gt;them will only barter with people.. He has a liking for Ogre heads for some<br/>
&gt;reason.. I think they like to eat them.  Tell you what, you bring an Ogre&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Head I&#39;ll give you one of us gnome&#39;s old cloak.. they&#39;re in decent shape,<br/>
&gt;better than some old Ogre&#39;s head for sure.. sound like a deal?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So you run out to OOT... whack one of them Ogres and take the head.  You<br/>
&gt;can get two heads per trip (two ogres and they heads are lore, but they are<br/>
&gt;different heads).  Much better than going in there an whacking<br/>
&gt;clockworks.  Geez.  This isn&#39;t a very good quest example, but it certainly<br/>
&gt;proves that if they spent 10 minutes they could come up with a lame quest<br/>
&gt;like this.. what if they spent an hour?  Could probably do something decent.<br/>
