<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EQ_Tinkering] Possible new pet idea (Tinkerable) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-418595733">How about a clockwork pet that could run errands for you?  Give it a few<br/>
plat and send it off to the nearest vendor to bring back bandages, food,<br/>
water, arrows, etc.  Of course it would have to dodge monsters all the way<br/>
there and back!  I think watching these scurry across the zone would be a<br/>
hoot.<br/>
<br/>
Another clockwork guide would be able to cross zones.  Program it to take<br/>
you from Qeynos to Freeport, hit go and then run to keep up.<br/>
<br/>
Or, a clockwork cargo follows you around carrying items when you are<br/>
overburdened with weight.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if someone already posted these... I lost track of all the great<br/>
concepts!</div>
