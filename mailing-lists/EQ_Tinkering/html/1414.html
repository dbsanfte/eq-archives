<b>Subject:</b> Tinkered items we know how to make, things we have therioes on and just rumor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118385537">Ok folks i have searched for a good long time and found a few items I knew how to make, a few I previously did not know how to make and also a few theory items. Here goes: Firewater, flameless torch, compass, cams, lockpicks, spyglass, stalking probs, animated bait, collapsable fishing pole, aqua lung, <br/>
rebreather, Gem cutter ( if we could get a hold of diamond dust any new info out there?. Now we come to what is only theory and people ( at least from what i have read) arn&#39;t real sure about..... Thermal cloak ( Tattered gnomish cloak, metal rods firwater and maybe a belt..) Infered goggles ( no clue).  Here is something that just might make our tinkering worth while.... the tinkerer&#39;s bag.<br/>
This bag which can be purchased in Sol A ( only rumor, but from 2 sources) this item costs 6k plat and has ten slots, everything in the bag is weightless 100%. <br/>
Does anyone know if WE the tinkerer&#39;s of Norath can make this item ? <br/>
<br/>
side note : this was all extracted from the web and a few good tinkerer&#39;s on <br/>
several servers i hope it may be of some use to u all and if there is any info<br/>
please share it:) where do we buy the third tinkerers book btw?<br/>
