<div id="ygrps-yiv-976647612"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Has anyone actually made aprofit off of any of this yet.I am guessing that <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;will be quite hard just becaus ewho the hell is going to be willing to <br/>
&gt;pay75<br/>
&gt;pp for a spyglass or for that fact for anything we have there isnt much<br/>
&gt;demand for.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I sold one Spyglass for 53pp. Another for 60pp.<br/>
And a fishing pole for 40pp (It was a good friend of mine who bought it-- he <br/>
felt sorry for me =) The number of tells I get is simply enormous, all just <br/>
asking &quot;Are they worth it?&quot; Of course I say yes, but still I only had those <br/>
3 buyers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m going to try selling the poles for 10pp and the spyglasses <br/>
for 60pp (maybe 50pp) this week and see how it works out.<br/>
