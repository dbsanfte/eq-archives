<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043299947"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hehe nice site - one question though.  What is this ledendary Gnomish<br/>
&gt; Blunderbuss you mention?  Was that the flying machine someone posted a pic<br/>
&gt; of?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not the flying machine, but the gun from the same set of pictures.  The<br/>
flying machine could easily have been done just by equipping items like<br/>
barrels in odd places.  The gun graphic in the inventory appears to be a<br/>
game graphic, and not some kind of graphic editing hack.  (Obviously, quite<br/>
a lot of other things were hacked on the programming side.  Bad, evil,<br/>
wrong.)<br/>

For those of you who missed it the first time, check out<br/>

the same directory.<br/>

I don&#39;t expect to ever see it, but just knowing there&#39;s a graphic for it in<br/>
the game gives me a warm feeling.  It would just HAVE to be a tinkered item.<br/>
Blunderbuss seemed like a good name for it, even though it&#39;s really more of<br/>
a pistol.<br/>
