<div><font face="Nosferatu"><tt>Hey guys, I know this isn&#39;t a magician related 
topic, but I figure <br>that there are quite a few gnomes here so it might be 
worthwile to <br>post.&nbsp; There was a GM event in Everfrost last night were a 
gnome <br>showed off a new &#39;invention&#39;.&nbsp; It was a floating lantern called a 
<br>personal heater.&nbsp; (Actually, it was a shadow man holding a lamp, 
<br>renamed to &#39;a personal heater&#39;).&nbsp; Anyways, the lamp had some cool 
<br>effects, casting fireshield on everyone around it (then it started <br>doing 
an AOE that affected all pc&#39;s too close).&nbsp; The gnomes decided <br>it must 
be destroyed, because the creator used the wrong items in <br>it&#39;s making.&nbsp; 
Anyways, the players around slaughtered the personal <br>heater, and both 
members in my group managed to loot/inspect the <br>items on the corpse.&nbsp; 
The following is the log from what they <br>reported:<br><br>[Wed Apr 19 
20:11:58 2000] Calador tells the group, &#39;wiz spell, <br>inferno shock&#39;<br>[Wed 
Apr 19 20:12:07 2000] Calador tells the group, &#39;metal twine&#39;<br>[Wed Apr 19 
20:12:11 2000] Calador tells the group, &#39;metal rod&#39;<br>[Wed Apr 19 20:12:22 
2000] Calador tells the group, &#39;and gizmo #6&#39;<br>[Wed Apr 19 20:14:07 2000] 
Ursoo tells the guild, &#39;gears, amber, <br>large lantern, metal parts&#39;<br><br>Now 
the gnomes argued over the fact that they &#39;should have&#39; used <br>gizmo #4 to 
keep the item from being dangerous.&nbsp; Plus, I think Ursoo <br>was refering 
to metal bits, not metal parts.. but I dont know for <br>sure, since Dark Elves 
don&#39;t meddle much into tinkering.<br><br>Anyways, if anyone feels brave and has 
a few plat to burn, tinker <br>this item and let us all know what comes of 
it!&nbsp; Even if you get <br>that &#39;you lack the skill to fashion the items 
together&#39; message, at <br>least that tells us that there IS something 
there.</tt></font></div>
