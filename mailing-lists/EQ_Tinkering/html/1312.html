<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745152673">Actually the quest is super easy.  the key is to attack one of the fairies<br/>
that are away from the town in lesser faydark, then gearheart will run after<br/>
you, minus the fairy gaurds. If you do some experimenting you will find he<br/>
will chase you if you attack a fairy quite far out from the town.<br/>

You get a small wooden shield or something like it... Worthless in general,<br/>
except for faction adjustments... I think it helps with the Eldritch<br/>
Collective.  I got killed in a few seconds trying to take out Gearheart so<br/>
I don&#39;t recommend it.  A friend of mine managed to kill him as Gearheart<br/>
was apparently wandering near the zone (someone attacked and managed to run<br/>
away from the farie onslaught).  The quest is supposed to be for a<br/>
low-level character... Yeah, right.  Level 29 wizard dead in about 20<br/>
seconds.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still hopeful that they will make some type of Tinkering quest given<br/>
out by the Eldritch Collective when you get your faction high enough.. The<br/>
Collective are &#39;The Tinkerers&#39; aren&#39;t they?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Lesser faydark.  Good luck, I believe they&#39;re over level 30 and they&#39;re all<br/>
&gt;grouped together.  If memory serves they cast nasty spells too.  While<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re there you can do the gearheart quest and tell us what it rewards.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve never heard of anybody completing that quest. </span></blockquote></div>
