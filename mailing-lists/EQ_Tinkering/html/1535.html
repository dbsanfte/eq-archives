<b>Subject:</b> Re: Diamond Dust possible location... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999972272">Ok, this may be another wild goose chase, but I poked<br/>
around some in Ak&#39;Anon, and I talked to everyone I<br/>
could find about diamond dust. Only one NPC responded<br/>
to my queries, and it seemed kind of related. He told<br/>
me that I needed to kill &quot;clockwork dusters&quot; and<br/>
return their remains to him since they&#39;re obsolete.<br/>
This NPC is just across the water near the Mines of<br/>
Malfunction. I looked all over for these dusters, but<br/>
couldn&#39;t find any, all I found were scrubbers,<br/>
cleaners, and sweepers. If you happen to come across<br/>
any, let me know how it turns out!<br/>
