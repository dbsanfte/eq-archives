<div id="ygrps-yiv-95421960">The coins are for something else, but the water clue at least makes me think<br/>
of something.  There&#39;s a really deep section of water at the bottom of<br/>
Akanon by the mines.  I tried swimming to the bottom as a newbie, but didn&#39;t<br/>
have the air.  Later, once my swimming was at a reasonable level, I did make<br/>
it down and tried swimming into the walls in all directions.  I was really<br/>
looking for a passage or something like that.  If anything was lying on the<br/>
ground and didn&#39;t stand out, I could easily have missed it.  Anyway, it&#39;s a<br/>
bit strange for the &#39;abyss&#39; to be there without a purpose.  Well lets hope<br/>
it isn&#39;t just a newbie deathtrap.<br/>
