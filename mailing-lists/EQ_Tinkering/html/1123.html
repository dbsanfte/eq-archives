<b>Subject:</b> Underwater Breathing Apparatus!  OUR holy grail! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194466741">Greetings.<br/>
<br/>
Did everyone see the patch message?  They have implemented a tinkerable underwater breathing apparatus in the game!  <br/>
<br/>
So, the next question becomes, does anyone know the recipe?  THIS is MAJOR!  Kedge Keep has just been itemized as well!  Can you all hear that?  Its the clink of coins as everyone waits in lines for this new item. Especially the high levellers out there!<br/>
