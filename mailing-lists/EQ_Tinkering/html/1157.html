<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030888960">When the cloaks hit the servers I had a friend of mine make me <br/>
some small ones. They all come across as Small Patchwork <br/>
Cloak, the belts come across as Small Tattered belt.<br/>
 I think so far the only way to get a Tattered cloak is through the <br/>
newbie quests and the items given for that are random. I personally <br/>
have done the Red V one over 20 times and have yet to get one, <br/>
but now I have one Bull Smasher and really good faction with the <br/>
guards. :)<br/>

&gt; Well the Cloaks only hit Live Servers  like 2 or 3 Patches Back. I do<br/>
&gt; believe ALL patchwork is called Tattered.<br/>

&gt; When I was messing around with tailoring (many levels ago)<br/>
&gt; I was making only patchwork.  I seem to recall that when you<br/>
&gt; put patchwork on it was mysteriously called &quot;tattered.&quot;  Now<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t seem to recall ever being able to make a cloak,<br/>
&gt; but then again, I haven&#39;t don&#39;t tailoring in months.<br/>

&gt; Has anyone had any luck finding the small tattered cloak for the thermal<br/>
&gt; cloak?<br/>
