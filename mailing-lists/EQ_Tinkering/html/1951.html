<b>Subject:</b> Skill Level Cap <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-623986321">Not sure if this has been addressed, but is there still a skill level cap <br/>
based upon level?  I&#39;ve been using a 29 wizard to learn tinkering but I <br/>
don&#39;t play him anymore so he won&#39;t likely go up in level anymore.  I&#39;m <br/>
approaching the point where the cap could come into effect and I don&#39;t want <br/>
to blow money if I&#39;m not going to gain any points.<br/>
