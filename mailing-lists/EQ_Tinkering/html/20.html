<br/>
Bad news first. Tinker is a skill that doesn&#39;t become<br/>
available till level 16. Can&#39;t help you there.<br/>
<br/>
Good news. It works.<br/>
You need to get a Toolbox you can find them in<br/>
Steamfont. And you need directions, which you<br/>
can get from books also bought in Steamfont.<br/>
<br/>
Firewater (which is suppose to be in the books, but<br/>
unless it&#39;s subtle it&#39;s not there, and I mean REALLY<br/>
subtle) I know how to make that. And I&#39;ve posted<br/>
how.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s expensive to Tinker, but I think worth it. Good luck.<br/>

p.s. If you need me to repost making Firewater I will.<br/>
Didn&#39;t learn it myself (no directions) so I was told how.<br/>
