<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711298254">As for the permafrost clue.  There is gnome located underneath the water<br/>
in everfrost.  It was once rumored that this was a necromancer city, but<br/>
to the best of my knowledge this is false.  There are some skeletons<br/>
around him, but I really don&#39;t know what he says or what he drops if you<br/>
kill him.<br/>

&gt; been searching for the past several days (and he was level 8 at the<br/>
&gt; time).  I&#39;m convinced he is on to something, nobody in their right<br/>
&gt; mind would risk that kind of venture without good reason.  However, I<br/>
&gt; have not heard anything from him in several weeks, he may have given<br/>
&gt; up or lost his level many times, I don&#39;t know.  But I&#39;m going back<br/>
&gt; there to do some more exporing myself.<br/>

<br/>
Mulder:  There&#39;s been another unsubstantiated UFO sighting in the<br/>
heartland of America. We&#39;ve got to get there right away.<br/>
Scully:  Well, gee Mulder, there&#39;s also this report of a shipment of<br/>
drugs and illegal weapons coming into New Jersey tonight.<br/>
Mulder:  I hardly thing the FBI&#39;s concerned with matters like that.</div>
