&gt; Jogl can sometimes be found in the Third Windmill with Bom Knotwood as well.<br/>
&gt; He will walk back and forth while he is popped in. BUT, the person who<br/>
&gt; remarked about the guard killers is VERY right. Jogl stands right next to<br/>
&gt; the watchman at the Windmills when he&#39;s outside.. and WILL aggro on guard<br/>
&gt; killers ... so he usually ends up getting popped if that happens.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The REALLY bad news? Jogl Doobraugh is on a RARE RARE spawn timer. 9 times<br/>
&gt; out of 10 when I was first trying to do the Bootstrutter&#39;s Pack quest.. he<br/>
&gt; was dead and wouldn&#39;t repop. He doesn&#39;t pop in and out, he stays popped in..<br/>
&gt; and moves around from outside Windmill 1 to inside Windmill 3. If you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; find him anywhere, he&#39;s been killed and will most likely NOT repop until the<br/>
&gt; next Server Reboot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anytime I am trying to finish quests in / around AkAnon I always wait till<br/>
&gt; right after a server reboot. Makes it easier.<br/>
