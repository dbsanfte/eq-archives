<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538857243">When I hit 16 I decided to try tinkering so I bought some gears and<br/>
sprockets to make lockpicks.  I dropped about 60 plat and got nothing in<br/>
return.  Anyway, I gave up on tinkering for a long time, but recently have<br/>
gotten back into it.<br/>
<br/>
At level 47 and with a 184 int, I have gotten increases from making the<br/>
lanterns about every 5 attempts.  It may be my imagination, but even a<br/>
little extra int seems to help, so if you can get an int buff before going<br/>
to work, do it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have come to the conclusion that learning tinkering is one <br/>
&gt; of the lamest<br/>
&gt; things Verant has implemented.  Last night, I reached level 27 with my<br/>
&gt; wizard and sat down to make flameless lanterns.  I started <br/>
&gt; out at skill 50.<br/>
&gt; About 120 lanterns later, I get to 51.  About 40-50 lanterns <br/>
&gt; later, I get to<br/>
&gt; 60.  Then I called it quits and started again this morning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SEVEN hours later my skill has not budged.  I made approximately 360<br/>
&gt; attempts at lanterns (costing around 600pp after selling them <br/>
&gt; back) and<br/>
&gt; gaining nothing but a sore disposition.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, here is the conclusion that I came up with:  I have only <br/>
&gt; been able to<br/>
&gt; train my skill up to 10 past what it started, which is the same as the<br/>
&gt; number of levels I have achieved since being able to gain <br/>
&gt; tinkering skill in<br/>
&gt; the first place.  Yeah, 16 is when it says in the guild you <br/>
&gt; get the skill,<br/>
&gt; but you really can&#39;t increase it til 17.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I need to hear from everyone is what level they are and <br/>
&gt; what their<br/>
&gt; tinkering level is at.. I really don&#39;t want to have to level <br/>
&gt; repeatedly just<br/>
&gt; to get decent at tinker.<br/>
