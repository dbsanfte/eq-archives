I was 120 when the powered gloves were discovered.&nbsp; Dumped a lot of
cash into attempting rebreathers since it was the only thing sellable at
the time.&nbsp; Right now, the only thing I attempt to make is watchman
armor.&nbsp; I will not try rebreathers unless someone wants to buy
one.&nbsp; My skill is now 157 and probably can make them without &#39;too
many&#39; failures.&nbsp; Reason why I only attempt watchman armor is that it
only costs 120pp per attempt.&nbsp; Much better than the 1000pp for the
rebreathers.<br>
<br>
As for being stuck, I haven&#39;t seen a skill point increase since the last
patch that changed the drop rate of haze panther eyes.&nbsp; They
probably broke it.&nbsp; They suck.<br>
