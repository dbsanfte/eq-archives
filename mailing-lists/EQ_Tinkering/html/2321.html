&gt; So I might as well ask.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On fulcrums tinkering website there is a recipe for a skin improver. <br/>
&gt; IE 2 lq pelts make a medium. Is this fact or fantasy?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are two recipe sections: &quot;Recipes&quot; and &quot;Community Recipes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Recipes&quot; section is the official stuff that actually works in-game, and<br/>
with the exception of the Power Gloves and the Catapult, is complete.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Community Recipes&quot; section is a list of things that people would like<br/>
to see.  They do not work in game.  The Skin Improver is one of these.  So<br/>
no, it&#39;s fantasy.<br/>

&gt; rebreather. Is that it? Looks like there&#39;s only about 8 items that <br/>
&gt; can be made. Is this comprehensive? (Only got one tinkering book <br/>
&gt; myself).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, that&#39;s it.<br/>
