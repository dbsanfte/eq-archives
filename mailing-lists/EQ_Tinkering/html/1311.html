<div id="ygrps-yiv-818889806">My take on Verant&#39;s philosophy:<br/>
<br/>
Step 1: When you introduce something to the game, make it royally suck, in <br/>
the name of class balance, so no one will get pissed off about becoming <br/>
useless.<br/>
Step 2: Slowly make incremental improvements until the people who want the <br/>
change stop bitching a lot.<br/>
Step 3: Walk away for months to see if bitching continues.<br/>
<br/>
Case Study: Rogue Poison<br/>
Step 1a: Royally sucks - Must become master at pottery.  Must collect rare <br/>
drops from various low-level creatures (wasps, spiders, snakes).  Make very <br/>
difficult to apply poison to blade.  Only blade in primary slot can be <br/>
poisoned.  Randomize when it will proc (if it does).  If the rogue is <br/>
moving when procing, it is interrupted.  Make it highly resistable by the <br/>
mob.  Ungodly epensive.<br/>
Step 1b: No One Complains About Being Useless - Warriors do not bitch about <br/>
being outdamaged cause no one will ever see a poison actually work anyway...<br/>
Step 2: Make Incremental Improvements- Make it so poison will proc on first <br/>
stab and fix interruption bug.<br/>
Step 3: Walk away for months to see if bitching continues - (In progress)<br/>
<br/>
Case Study: Aqua Lung<br/>
Step 1a: Royally sucks - Must be high level (40+) in order to build skill <br/>
up to a point to attempt to create aqua lung. Must be god awful expensive <br/>
to attempt (250pp+).<br/>
Step 1b: No One Complains About Being Useless - Make it a charge item (like <br/>
stalking probes) so that druids, shaman, etc., don&#39;t complain about losing <br/>
enduring breath.<br/>
Step 2: Make Incremental Improvements: Unknown at this time, but might <br/>
require some rare drop consumable (such as a decaying sharks left gill - <br/>
right gills won&#39;t work).<br/>
Step 3: Walk away (might skip step 2 and go directly here)<br/>
<br/>
The same can be done for pretty much everything they&#39;ve introduced. I don&#39;t <br/>
like it, but I live with it.</div>
