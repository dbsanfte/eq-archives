<b>Subject:</b> Re: My experience getting Tinkering to 75 ... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320452968">For those stuck at 50 skill yet meet the level requirements, I might<br/>
suggest trying a few cams or stalking probes even.  I&#39;m pretty sure I got<br/>
my first point on making cams, too bad back then those were the non-working<br/>
cams, a lot of platinum was flushed trying to make a bow with them.  A<br/>
level 50 warrior on my server made some attempts at the stalking probes<br/>
with 50 skill, not a lot of successes but did get a skill increase after<br/>
just a couple.  Might be a possible solution for the &#39;hundreds of plat on<br/>
lanterns & no skill&#39;...<br/>
<br/>
My tinkering skill raise story is pretty much the same as Fizzwiz&#39;. About a<br/>
20pp per point average for me on the lanterns as well.  As he said,<br/>
sometimes 2 or 3 points per round, sometimes none at all.  Then I made cams<br/>
from about 65 to the trivial at 75.  Never got a skill increase off the<br/>
mechanized lockpicks but they turned trivial around 67-68.  Spyglass wasn&#39;t<br/>
trivial at a low 70s skill, not surprisingly.<br/>

time and it would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 plat to do<br/>
(after selling the lanterns back) depending on your success rate and<br/>
charisma. Sometimes I would gain nothing, sometimes 4 or 5 points, its very<br/>
random. On average I would say I gained about a point per 20 lanterns which<br/>
means I approximately spent about 20 to 30 plat per point up to 68 where<br/>
lanterns get trivial.<br/>

&gt;YES, you CAN make some cash selling the cams to bowers. While nothing to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>write home about you can make some fairly decent pocket change. I started<br/>
making cams at 68 (when lanterns became trivial) and my success rate was<br/>
not too bad. I could sell the cams for 25 plat to bowers, where they would<br/>
usually spend about 40 plat. They are usually VERY happy to find a tinker<br/>
that can make cams...<br/>

&gt;Gaining skill gets a bit more expensive here since each attempt cost maybe<br/>
 </span></blockquote>12 to 15 plat. But as with the lanterns I figure I would gain about a point<br/>
every 20 cams or so, which means you really need to find a place to sell<br/>
your cams to support your tinkering habit. I was able to get my skill up to<br/>
75 making cams.<br/>
