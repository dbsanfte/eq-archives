<div id="ygrps-yiv-67005005">Aye I know. My Halfling Druid Can make collapsible Fishing pole & it is<br/>
Trivial to him also. So I guess that means that I have 50 Skill also. I have<br/>
talked to a GM, one that I trust, & was told Base 50 for all.<br/>

I heard a guy saying that other races couldn&#39;t have a base skill of 50<br/>
because even gnomes don&#39;t until lvl 16...<br/>
<br/>
Well that&#39;s not entirely true.  My lvl 1 mule gnome made a collapsiable<br/>
fishing pole and it was trivial.  Does that mean he has a base of 50 or does<br/>
a fishing pole take negative 1 skill to make?  Hmmm?</div>
