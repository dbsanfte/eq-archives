I was the one who first mailed this list saying the Fishing pole is in the<br/>
game.  Because it is.  There was a high level gnome on Xegony that was<br/>
selling spy glasses, which require the fishing pole.  He had more than one,<br/>
which dispels the idea that he just got one from a gm quest.  According to<br/>
him, he is in a guild who specifically had been working to find the recipe<br/>
for the pole, and had finally been successful.  Unfortunately, he was<br/>
unwilling to share his recipe.  No doubt, the recipe is out there.<br/>

&gt; Hello Folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After seeing all the different combinations that we have tried to no<br/>
avail, I&#39;m beginning to think there might be a component somewhere that we<br/>
are not using. Looking on the &#39;Database&#39;<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)">http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)</a> I see that not many<br/>
combinations have been tried with the cork, sprocket, or cloth twine.<br/>
Although they dont seem to be the most likely candidates, I could see them<br/>
as a possibility.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With all the misses, I just cant help thinking we have missed something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am also beginning to think that the earlier rumors of the fishing pole<br/>
being makable are bull shit. If someone is making the poles and the eye<br/>
glasses, I would have thought we would have heard about more people having<br/>
them. We have not heard a peep from anyone since. Perhaps as Luke said, the<br/>
pole was given as part of a GM quest, and was not actually tinkered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it says something about the sad state of tinkering when our &#39;holy<br/>
grail&#39; is a damn fishing pole =|<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
