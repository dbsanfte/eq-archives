<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482963273">If anyone on this list reads a vendor to you, they are misinformed.  The only<br/>
way to make pie-tins is through smithing or pottery.  Being a master potter is<br/>
a huge advantage for you, as you can make the pie tin and make the compass. <br/>
That is what I will be doing tonight.<br/>
<br/>
When someone says &quot;it&#39;s on the vendor next to the blue building in freeport&quot;<br/>
they are mistaken.  Because you can buy the tin sketch (1pp and change) from<br/>
the vendor to make the tin, but then most will just sell it back to the vendor<br/>
since they are not in demand.  Thus why you see it occasionally off a vendor,<br/>
someone actually made that tin and sold it back.<br/>
<br/>
Your best bet is to become a master potter.  Preferrable an Enchanter with<br/>
Benevolence and Illusions so you can get bare base price on everything from<br/>
jewelry to clay.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of clay, I know muddites drop ore in Gorge, does anything drop clay?<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been a subscriber to the list for quite a while, but must have missed <br/>
&gt; this part.  I understand that the main topic right now is finding combos for <br/>
&gt; the fishing pole, but I wanted to get off topic real quick.  So, my goal is <br/>
&gt; to make compasses for my guild and I was wondering is there any place to buy <br/>
&gt; pie tins?  I&#39;ve mastered pottery just to make them, but it would be soooo <br/>
&gt; handy just to be able to buy them.  Anyone know?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
