<b>Subject:</b> Re: Watchman Drexlin quest... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-189529652">I have spoken to Drexlin and recived the Quest.  He says he was sent to the<br/>
Karanas to Kill some undead Brownies, and return their remains to Akannon.<br/>
He gives you a 4 slot Box which is No Drop i belive.  Last i heard this<br/>
quest was broken because the Tiny skelitens you recive when you kill the<br/>
undead brownies are NO DROP, so getting 4 of them and filling the box is<br/>
not possible.  He also says he is in a hurry and gives you a deadline for<br/>
returning the full box to him.  I dont think anyone is killing him when he<br/>
spawns , just that he is rare and only spawns a certain times and then goes<br/>
away again.   hope this helps.<br/>

&gt;Watchman Drexlin - this is a new quest, where one of the guys the<br/>
&gt;Gemchoppers hall who previously never said anything now directs you to find<br/>
&gt;Watchman Drexlin near Qeynos. According to Allakhazam&#39;s site, he spawns<br/>
&gt;near/on the stone bridge between north and south karana, on the north<br/>
&gt;Karana side and gives you a quest to kill Tiny Skeletons. I&#39;ve never been<br/>
&gt;able to find him, probably due ot the sheer number of powergaming weenies<br/>
&gt;that are KoS to gemchoppers from killing gnome guards, so he probably<br/>
&gt;doesnt last too long once he pops. Has anyone managed to complete this<br/>
&gt;quest yet? Is he always there unless someone kills him, or does he only<br/>
&gt;spawn at certain times of the day... I&#39;m hoping the later, cos it really<br/>
&gt;bugs me when people kill quest creatures - I still remember when I was<br/>
&gt;young and I could only do the report quests after a server reboot, becasue<br/>
&gt;the guard killers would often kill Joogl Doobraugh as well, and he has a<br/>
&gt;really long spawn time..<br/>
