<div id="ygrps-yiv-866588348">Click on the item to place it onto the cursor, then right click it on top <br/>
of the gem.  This is how a rogue applies poison to his dagger, he selects <br/>
the dagger with the cursor so that it appears ontop of the cursor, then he <br/>
right clicks the poison (and waits 8 seconds now) and places the dagger <br/>
back in his primary slot.  This would seem to be the best way of using the <br/>
gemchopper if its not a container.  Very good idea FizzWizz, you beat me to <br/>
it :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Talked to a GM after I made my first chopper, all he said was that it <br/>
&gt;chops gems... Has anyone tried right clicking on it or something to see if <br/>
&gt;it can be used directly on a gem? Seems to be pretty fucking worthless as <br/>
&gt;a gem chopper to me.<br/>
