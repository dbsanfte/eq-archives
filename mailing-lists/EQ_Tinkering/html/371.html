<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468407288">I am one of those people that truly believes in conspiracy theories and in my <br/>
opinion the CFPole is a conspiracy.  How do we all know that someone on this <br/>
very list might have given us a so called &quot;broken recipe&quot; and it was actually <br/>
the right one but they wanted to throw people off and have people not try it? <br/>
 Cause think about it if someone turns in a recipe that so called &quot;doesn&#39;t <br/>
work&quot; then NO ONE will even try that recipe again because they know it <br/>
&quot;doesn&#39;t work&quot; thus they are one of the few people who can actually make it.  <br/>
So those are just my thoughts.  And as 4 the four slot thing I think that <br/>
might be real.  I think this recipe probably is 4 slots.  But then again how <br/>
do you all know that I haven&#39;t made one my self and just lying?  Dont trust <br/>
any one cept guildmates that&#39;s what I have learned over the years.<br/>
