<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103986373">I know this was mentioned before but in akanon there is that star thing <br/>
floating above the pedestal.They re all over but the one near guide one <br/>
across from the palace doesnt move .When you click on it it turns and it <br/>
sounds as if a door is opening.It stays turned for a bout 10 seconds and then <br/>
turns back .I havent had much chance to look around after clicking it mainly <br/>
because I didnt have anyone to help me ,but mi sure that this must be <br/>
something of importance.I am on Bertoxx and i know there are a lot of people <br/>
on this list als on Bertoxx so if anone wants to try and figure out what this <br/>
thing is just give me a tell.<br/>
