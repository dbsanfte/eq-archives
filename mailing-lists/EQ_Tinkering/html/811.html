&gt; &gt; It is a hack job... whoever made the emuQ are the only guys in the world to<br/>
&gt; &gt; ever make an everquest emulator. They can give any item different<br/>
&gt; &gt; attributes, as well as create new classes and levels.. (The guy shown is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; high elf shadownight at lvl 100)<br/>
&gt; &gt; They can also place enimies wherever they want.. etc<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And where do we get this emulator? ;)<br/>
