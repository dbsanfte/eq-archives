&gt; Okay let me clear this rumour up before this gets out of hand.  My<br/>
&gt; guildmate Eltanin was asking my advice on his enchanter quest.  After<br/>
&gt; looking at the quest text (you: Where is the mechancial pen.  NPC: the<br/>
&gt; answer is in your question), I came up with the an idea that the location<br/>
&gt; was hidden as an anagram within the word Mechanical Pen.  It looked<br/>
&gt; promising as Paineel was the only zone with all it&#39;s letters in Mechanical<br/>
&gt; Pen.  With the remaining letters, I came up with Mc&#39;Chanl or Mc&#39;Nulch,<br/>
&gt; thinking a barbarian had the pen.  However, this was just a theory and not<br/>
&gt; a fact!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My theory was proved wrong as the actual quest is finished by giving a SMR<br/>
&gt; &lt;gasp&gt; to the chanter NPC in the Mines of Malfucntion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So if anyone tells you that the mechanical pen is in Paineel, please<br/>
&gt; correct them!  Thanks in advance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I highly doubt that this item is tinkerable since it&#39;s part of the<br/>
&gt; FA type quests for chanters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; QdP - who is completely amazed how a theory turned into an assumed fact<br/>
&gt; overnight hehe.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Anyone heard of a recipe for such a device?  Its may be a component of<br/>
&gt; &gt; part<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the FA quest for enchanters. Also have heard that it may be an<br/>
&gt; &gt; anagram for<br/>
&gt; &gt; something in Paineel.<br/>
