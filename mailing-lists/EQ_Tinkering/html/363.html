<div id="ygrps-yiv-134394663">Hello Folks,<br/>
<br/>
After seeing all the different combinations that we have tried to no avail, I&#39;m beginning to think there might be a component somewhere that we are not using. Looking on the &#39;Database&#39; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)">http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)</a> I see that not many combinations have been tried with the cork, sprocket, or cloth twine. Although they dont seem to be the most likely candidates, I could see them as a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
With all the misses, I just cant help thinking we have missed something.<br/>
<br/>
I am also beginning to think that the earlier rumors of the fishing pole being makable are bull shit. If someone is making the poles and the eye glasses, I would have thought we would have heard about more people having them. We have not heard a peep from anyone since. Perhaps as Luke said, the pole was given as part of a GM quest, and was not actually tinkered.<br/>
<br/>
I think it says something about the sad state of tinkering when our &#39;holy grail&#39; is a damn fishing pole =|<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
