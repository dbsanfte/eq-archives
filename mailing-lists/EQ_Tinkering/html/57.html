&gt; Why can you not join your guild??  Also are you over lvl 16?  If not you<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t go up.  Also it is like smithing some items are just way too easy to<br/>
&gt; raise skill.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s a figurative &quot;join my guild&quot;. I assume that if I could<br/>
get 4 lenses I could join the Eldritch Collective like it sounds like<br/>
when I got the quest at level 1. I don&#39;t know what the reward actually<br/>
is. I was hoping for something neat since it is so hard to do. <br/>
<br/>
I am level 18, so yes, over 16. I&#39;ve blown 12pp in making flameless lanterns<br/>
no one will buy and not a single skill increase. I just got 50 more plat<br/>
from adventuring around Antonica. I&#39;ll probably save some for level 20<br/>
spells and put the rest into more tinkering hoping it will go up<br/>
sooner or later. Are flameless lanterns the best thing to make to<br/>
get your skill up?<br/>
<br/>
When something is too easy to make your skill go up, it normally says<br/>
that the item is trivial. Firewater does this for me, but not<br/>
lanterns. I haven&#39;t made a compass yet because I need a smith to<br/>
make skewers and I need to find pie tins.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well. Eventually I will tinker! *grin*<br/>
