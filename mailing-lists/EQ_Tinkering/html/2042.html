<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523781781">I did bootstrutters backpack quest at lvl 29 so I dont think there is a <br/>
level cap. Remember ONLY Duster X & V.. The cleaners will get you killed. <br/>
And BTW the guy who gives you the backpack after you have the two pieces is <br/>
across from the mines... swim across the water and he&#39;s there next to some <br/>
machine.. you can hail him. or just give him the pieces.  BTW for you non <br/>
Enchanters, I &quot;heard&quot; there was a faction requirement but i&#39;mm not sure. I <br/>
cast belevolence on him (+200 faction) and had no problems.. FYI<br/>
