<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403544724">What will it take to get it through to you guys? There is NO damn third <br/>
book, ANY formulas for items that have been figured out how to be made, if <br/>
any at all were figured out by trial and error. There is absolutely NO BOOK! <br/>
NONE not -ANYWHERE- in the game! When there IS something will be said about <br/>
it in the patch. Until then , just work on raising your tinkering skill, <br/>
thats all I can say, doing anything else about tinkering, like trying to <br/>
find a non-existant book, or trying to figure out a formula with next to <br/>
nothing odds is just a TOTAL 100% waste of time!</div>
