&gt; another way to get a great 100% weight reducing 10<br/>
&gt; slot bag, is to go<br/>
&gt; to SolB, kill Guano Harvester who is 15 lvl gob who<br/>
&gt; hangs out near<br/>
&gt; the sonic Bats. That critter has the bag and we saw<br/>
&gt; him about every<br/>
&gt; hour it seems; most everyone in our party got one.<br/>
&gt; He remains visible<br/>
&gt; for a short time while he roams around the bats, but<br/>
&gt; soon casts<br/>
&gt; inviso on himself. Will need to be in your mid-high<br/>
&gt; 30&#39;s tho, to get<br/>
&gt; that far into the zone and hope to survive. But as a<br/>
&gt; gnome that bag<br/>
&gt; is a blessing! I can now hold tons more stuff before<br/>
&gt; I get<br/>
&gt; encumbered. But, it&#39;s a medium bag, which means it<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t hold many<br/>
&gt; weapons, they being too big. The bag is called A<br/>
&gt; Soiled Backpack, I<br/>
&gt; think and looks like an open backpack. And to anyone<br/>
&gt; who knows about<br/>
&gt; this item, what would be the going price selling<br/>
&gt; one?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oops, realized its not really tinkering related...=)<br/>
