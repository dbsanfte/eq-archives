<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-701992479">I have had mine priced at 3k for singles and steadily decreasing prices<br/>
from there for multiples.  I have one guild possibly ordering 18, and<br/>
quoted them a price of 33k.(&lt;2k each).  The problem with selling them to<br/>
the public, is that fishbones sell for around 3k on E&#39;ci, and most people<br/>
do not want to give up whatever their headslot item is.  The weight is a<br/>
HUGE concern for casters.  I will be glad when we can finally make <br/>
something that is useful to the general public.<br/>
<br/>
I had thought the powergloves would be a good seller, but again, it is<br/>
not, being gnome only shot that down in a heartbeat.  Is anyone else<br/>
confused as to why they didn&#39;t make them like the rest of the armors<br/>
seem to be.....small race.  Monks would love gnomish power gloves,<br/>
as would most clerics, rogues, and some of the warriors I know.  I had<br/>
one guy offer me 500pp for a pair before he found out that they were<br/>
gnome only.  =(<br/>
