<div id="ygrps-yiv-441572782">As a point of reference, I have now tried a total of 26 attempts at armor<br/>
pieces, and have not been successful on any of them.  I lost one piece of<br/>
armor out of the 26 failures.  The armor, I am getting fairly cheap, as I<br/>
can make it myself, although, I am actually buying it from a friend who is<br/>
selling it to me at basically cost of materials with a small kickback for<br/>
his time.  (He has less failures than I do, being well over 200 smithing<br/>
now.)  To be completely honest with you, I am going back to rebreathers to<br/>
raise the skill.  I did not gain a single skill point in the 26 failures,<br/>
and average about one skill point per 6-8 rebreather attempts.  I figure<br/>
that at around 175, I will most likely start having a small amount of<br/>
success with the smaller armor pieces.  Although, I am going to attempt to<br/>
make a number of footwarming boots, and see how the success rates are.  Will<br/>
post as I continue trying.<br/>
<br/>
The only components that I know of that do not stack are the velium lens&#39;<br/>
for the helms, and I am assuming that the vanishing devices required for the<br/>
chestplate will not, but I believe that the components to make it do.<br/>
<br/>
I had spent approx. 10 hours total to gather the components that I had,<br/>
which included 10 sifaye dust, 12 globs of tar, 16 holgresh wings, 6<br/>
holgresh fur, and 3 blocks of living granite.  Still have not gotten my<br/>
hands on any haze panther eyes.<br/>

&gt; Wings are fairly easy to get (still rare) and they stack.  Consumables are<br/>
&gt; around 100pp.  The question is whether you will raise your skill from<br/>
&gt; attempting armor.  Because the trivial point for the armor is higher than<br/>
&gt; rebreathers, and you fail considerably on them, you will raise your skill<br/>
&gt; at a slower rate than if you attempted the rebreathers.  Therefore, IF it<br/>
&gt; takes 100 attempts to raise one point from making armor versus 10 attempts<br/>
&gt; from making rebreathers (I&#39;ve averaged one point per 10 attempts in<br/>
&gt; general), then it would be a wash besides the collection of the wings.  I<br/>
&gt; would be surprised its this bad, so I guess maybe 20 attempts at armor<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; raise a point.  Therefore, each point would cost 2000pp plus 20 holgresh<br/>
&gt; wings.  Versus 10000pp involved with rebreathers.  And who knows, you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; bound to get lucky once and actually make a piece of armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My plan is to camp the holgresh and collect a load of wings and fur and<br/>
try<br/>
&gt; to raise my skill that way.  Its currently 143, so I will finish out with<br/>
&gt; aqualungs at first.  At least they sell back at 30pp below cost.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also another factor is time.  Think about how much money you have to carry<br/>
&gt; with you from the bank if you want to attempt 10 rebreathers.  Thats<br/>
&gt; 10kpp.  You can&#39;t move with that much money, you will have to attempt 3 or<br/>
&gt; 4 rebreathers at a time max, then go back to the bank for more money.<br/>
With<br/>
&gt; the armor, most all items are stackable, the heavy non stackable items<br/>
&gt; being the armor... which you get back when you fail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; At 07:02 PM 12/20/2000 +0000, you wrote:<br/>
&gt; &gt;This seems really sad.  The only thing to raise tinkering that high<br/>
&gt; &gt;currently is rebreathers, correct?  Which means a ton of money.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;On the other hand, does any of the dropped items you need stack?  If<br/>
&gt; &gt;so, it might be possible to carry over a nice supply of them to<br/>
&gt; &gt;Steamfont and keep making attempts at the Watchman armor.  If the<br/>
&gt; &gt;plate is returned, then it might be cheaper than Rebreathers.  Can<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone confirm this?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks, my tinkering is up to 128, so I know I have some work to do<br/>
&gt; &gt;and any help would be appreciated.  Now, I just have to find the<br/>
&gt; &gt;funds.  hmm...<br/>
