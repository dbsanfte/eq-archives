<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499771351">FACT: The spyglass needs a collapsible fishing pole to make.  I should<br/>
know, I made one :P<br/>
<br/>
FACT: The collapsible fishing pole is a player made item.  Here&#39;s a snip<br/>
right from the everquestmanual.txt:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;TINKERING:  Allows Gnomes to fabricate mechanical items.<br/>
&gt;Example: Collapsible fishing pole, Gnomish Fireworks, and a Spyglass.<br/>
&gt;Requires: Toolbox<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm what ever happend to the fireworks BTW?  Probably in the same book as<br/>
the firewater and collapsible pole :P<br/>
<br/>
In any case, its in there but we haven&#39;t found it yet.<br/>
<br/>
Some newly found info: The spyglass sells to merchants for exactly 16pp.<br/>
By comparison, I get 8gp/1.6pp flameless lantern, 9.6pp/15pp cams,<br/>
12pp/18.4pp for stalking probes and lockpicks.  This is with a Bristlebane<br/>
Rogue with a 60cha and indifferent /con.  In that case the pole could cost<br/>
4-8pp to make (ballpark figure).  Keep in mind that the sell back price<br/>
ISN&#39;T always directly related to component costs.  Pie tin patch comes to<br/>
mind...<br/>

&gt;&gt; Thought #1:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Before taking an extended break from Everquest to pursue a job, I spent<br/>
&gt;&gt; nearly 150 pp making flameless lanterns and my skill remained &quot;Below<br/>
&gt;&gt; Average&quot;.  I was told by a GM that tinkering is one of the hardest<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; You cannot train tinkering using skill points.  I have tried it.  It is<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; If the collapsible fishing pole was in a shop, it would have been found<br/>
 </span></blockquote>long<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; ago.  Of course, if it was only added in recently, then it may have yet to<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; recipe to make them.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thought #3:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The collapsible fishing pole recipe should be fairly cheap to make.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt; really doubt that Verant made it difficult, considering it is a component<br/>
&gt;&gt; for another item.  So, this should limit the parts to those costing 1 pp or<br/>
&gt;&gt; less, with the total cost not exceeding 5 pp.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thought #4:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Whoever assumed that the spyglasses were being sold for 50% over cost is<br/>
&gt;&gt; assuming way too much.  If you are the only producer of an item, you can<br/>
&gt;&gt; demand a much higher profit return on that item.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thought #5:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; There is no such thing as a &quot;secret&quot; on Everquest.  There are too many<br/>
&gt;&gt; people playing the game, making any new discovery part of the common<br/>
&gt;&gt; knowledge base within a few weeks.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thought #6:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Seeing &quot;broken&quot; quests, items, and spells in the past, I wouldn&#39;t put it<br/>
&gt;&gt; past Verant that the collapsible fishing pole recipe isn&#39;t really in the<br/>
&gt;&gt; game.  I am merely speculating, but I find it rather hard to believe that<br/>
&gt;&gt; after months of uptime, not one gnome has found the recipe to such a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>trivial<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; item as the collapsible fishing pole.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thought #7:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; This is perhaps the most overriding aspect of this whole ridiculous thread<br/>
&gt;&gt; about the collapsible fishing pole recipe.  There are literally hundreds of<br/>
&gt;&gt; items that could be used as a component, and it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; make any sense whatsoever.  Trying to guess it blindly is just like playing<br/>
&gt;&gt; the lottery.  You might get lucky, but we don&#39;t have the hundreds of<br/>
&gt;&gt; thousands of players needed to insure that SOMEONE gets lucky.<br/>
