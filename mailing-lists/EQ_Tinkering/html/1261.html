<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620050703">so does anyone know what the skill cap is for the lung? or even the <br/>
rebreather? got 20 more pts to my skill..and will add more tonight(unless my <br/>
friends are gonna hit guk again..hehe got a de mask last night..I AM NOT <br/>
SHORT ANYMORE!!!) anyways...about what i said concerning the loss of <br/>
chaarges being a bug..IT IS. the crafted gauntlets post...hmm..well, the <br/>
only reason verant changed the merchant&#39;s payment to players is becuase <br/>
there is NOT ANY items in the game taht you can perchase then sell for more <br/>
to merchants. merchants are only there for item elimination..not for a <br/>
&quot;market.&quot; verants also did this to increase the player economy..as players <br/>
wanting to make profit on the gloves would have to sell to other <br/>
players(unfortunately this back-fired because, 1. the gloves are easy to <br/>
get, and 2. the market was already flooded with them.)..soo anywyas..what is <br/>
a good skill lvl to make Lungs at? thx.<br/>
