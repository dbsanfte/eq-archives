<div id="ygrps-yiv-855465849">Things must have changed.  I  made lots of poles prior to<br/>
yesterdays patch and they were trivial from the get go.  <br/>
<br/>
		Was hoping flameless lanterns weren&#39;t so low lvl trivial.<br/>
<br/>
		I do know that the spyglasses aren&#39;t trivial at 52, but out<br/>
of 10 tries only got 2 skill increases with INT of 175.  This is one hobby<br/>
you only make things to sell, not for practice.  Kinda like high lvl<br/>
fletching.</div>
