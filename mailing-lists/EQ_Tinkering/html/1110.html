<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866267951">Is the celebration on for tonight?  What time and server?<br/>
<br/>
As a traditionalist I would like to ask a gnome of repute on the host server to pick me up a scarab helm for my poor head.  I have worn one since level 1 on Karana and it is my trademark.  I am afraid my gnomish brains would fall out if I did not have one!  <br/>
