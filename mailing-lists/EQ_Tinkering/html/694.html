<div id="ygrps-yiv-964267858">There are a lot of jaded folks here, and some not without good reason, but<br/>
I, for one, am willing to hear what you have to say and appreciate your<br/>
help. Look forward to seeing your message after you make your trip.<br/>

Why do you all act like this? I try to help, but you decline it. If what you<br/>
want is for me to truly leave with my information, then that is what I will<br/>
do. I will leave the choice up to you. I&#39;m trying to apologize by helping,<br/>
but you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all I&#39;m<br/>
out here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What I<br/>
have to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just want<br/>
to check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all hate<br/>
me so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because<br/>
you think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all<br/>
with out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept it<br/>
or decline it.</div>
