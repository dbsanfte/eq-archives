<div id="ygrps-yiv-307533901">Yes I have finished it.  No tinkering info though - you end up with a free<br/>
Elemental Grimoire (great quest for Magician&#39;s - will save you 11pp+). <br/>
However, the wording is incorrect in the quest and might be a little<br/>
confusing to some.  Tergon asks you to bring back Toko Binlittle&#39;s<br/>
spellbook (the renegade mage-turned-pirate).  Toko drops a Tier&#39;dal head<br/>
(casting Identify on it reveals &quot;a cowardly dark elf head&quot;).  Perhaps the<br/>
head is hollowed out and he stores is scrolls in it &lt;g&gt;.  Anyways, take<br/>
that head back to Tergon and he will give you the Grimoire + the usual<br/>
exp/faction bonus.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, I finished this quest without talking to the gnome in<br/>
Crushbone - perhaps he might have more info on this tinkered &quot;shotgun&quot;.  I<br/>
also completed this quest quite some time ago and it may have been<br/>
changed.<br/>

&gt; &gt; First I want someone to tell me what the gnome in the back of<br/>
&gt; crushbone in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; pit is for?  I was there when I was in my teens, but have not returned<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; what he did.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The gnome in crushbone is actually part of the Tergon&#39;s Spellbook quest<br/>
&gt; which has recently been fixed since Bugglepup the gnome now spawns in<br/>
&gt; steamfont.  When you talk to Tergon in ak&#39;anon he says to retrieve a<br/>
&gt; metal<br/>
&gt; pellet that he shot Bugglepup with and lost.  Well once you return it to<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; he tells you to search out his brother in Freeport and give him a letter<br/>
&gt; that tells him to give you the spellbook.  So you goto freeport and<br/>
&gt; learn<br/>
&gt; that he was captured by the orcs.  So you take the letter to him in<br/>
&gt; crushbone and he tells you the oracle in the castle took the book.  Kill<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; oracle, return the book and tergon sends you to oot to kill a renegade<br/>
&gt; gnome<br/>
&gt; thats taken up with the pirates of gunthark.  Thats as far as I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; gotten<br/>
&gt; with the quest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was really hopeing it would yield tinkering info because Tergon says<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; shot bugglepup with one of his contraptions.  (a tinker made shotgun of<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; sort??)  :)  Anyone ever finish all of Tergon&#39;s quests to the end?<br/>
