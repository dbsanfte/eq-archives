<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602348693">This seems really sad.  The only thing to raise tinkering that high <br/>
currently is rebreathers, correct?  Which means a ton of money.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, does any of the dropped items you need stack?  If <br/>
so, it might be possible to carry over a nice supply of them to <br/>
Steamfont and keep making attempts at the Watchman armor.  If the <br/>
plate is returned, then it might be cheaper than Rebreathers.  Can <br/>
anyone confirm this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, my tinkering is up to 128, so I know I have some work to do <br/>
and any help would be appreciated.  Now, I just have to find the <br/>
funds.  hmm...<br/>
