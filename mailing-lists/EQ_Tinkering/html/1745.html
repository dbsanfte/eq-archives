<div id="ygrps-yiv-229053419">I have heard the sound but never found out where the door was or how to make<br/>
the sound (the button). There is an area near the basement underwater that<br/>
looks like it should be a zone to somewhere. perhaps if someone clicked the<br/>
button and someone swam down the tunnel?.... If you try it PLEASE let me<br/>
know I am in Permafrost!<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] an Idea<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was readin a post, I discounted it as major B.S. but checked it out<br/>
&gt; regardless since I was in Ak&#39;anon. It mentioned somethin bout a clockwork<br/>
&gt; dragon, now the dragon, I don&#39;t believe, not by a longhshot. But it also<br/>
&gt; mentioned one of those lamp, star light post things, and when ya click it,<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; makes a door opening sound and turns 90 degrees. I thought that it was<br/>
worth<br/>
&gt; 2 seconds investigation, so I found the one that wasn&#39;t soinning next to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; lake. I clicked it, and sure enough, it turned bout 90 degrees, and I<br/>
heard<br/>
&gt; the door creak. I have no idea what this is about, knowing my luck, this<br/>
&gt; little topic has popped up on the list before, but I&#39;m a recent addition<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; it. If it has, GOOD! someone please fill me in and quench my curiosity. If<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t, anyone have any ideas what it is, cause who knows, what if it has<br/>
&gt; valid importance, this is a long shot, but it may have somethin to with<br/>
&gt; diamond dust. I know I know, there&#39;s a bunch of you thinking I&#39;m prime<br/>
full<br/>
&gt; of it, but about the little door creak and star lamp thing, I&#39;m not, I<br/>
invite<br/>
&gt; you to see it yourself. Anyways, I jus thought I&#39;d toss that one out<br/>
there.<br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s been brought up before, forgive me for my insolence.<br/>
