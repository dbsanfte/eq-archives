&gt; &gt; oh, ok i heard the king was a clockwork, i mean why would a human be the<br/>
&gt; king<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the land of gnomes...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Morelikely it&#39;s a bug, and becasue the king gives no quests or anything<br/>
&gt; else of importance its not high on the list of things to fix..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m told, in the beta/early release event where all the kings came out,<br/>
&gt; King Ak&#39;anon was a gnome necromancer..Don&#39;t know how accurate that is,<br/>
&gt; heard it on the paladin list, where some were using it as justification for<br/>
&gt; killing gnomes in SolA :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>King Akanon was indeed a real live gnome in beta, not sure about his class<br/>
though, didnt stick around and take note of his spells while I was there.  (was<br/>
too busy becoming addicted to eq ;)</div>
