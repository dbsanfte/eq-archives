<b>Subject:</b> The exact recipe <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-56384855">Yes, I did try the exact recipe.<br/>
<br/>
Those items did not combine in those quantities.  I did it with the <br/>
gizmo number 4, the one that was supposed to be the replacement.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t bother with the gizmo number 6.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that this is a red herring, since Verant said they were <br/>
going to address tinkering after they did poison, which was due for <br/>
fixing in may.<br/>
