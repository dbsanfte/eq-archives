<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113261476">Ok need some help.. <br/>
<br/>
1) I know books one and two have locations in Steamfont at the windmills (common knowledge)<br/>
but where is book 3? and is there a book 4?<br/>
<br/>
I have all the recipies for book 3 but want the actual books so when changes are made i can find<br/>
them quickly.<br/>
<br/>
2) UNDERWATER BREATHING.. well according to the patch we have this now.. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure which book yet as i can&#39;t get ingame. but i&#39;ll check books one and two however<br/>
something tells me that it&#39;s not going to be in those.. anyone HAVE 3 and can check there<br/>
and post it perhaps.. or give location of book 3?<br/>
<br/>
3) PETITION/FEEDBACK/BUG the fireworks.. yes as you all know they are bad.. but it LOOKS like<br/>
the same bug that FLARE had a while ago.. so i think it&#39;s FIXABLE.. seen some posts that<br/>
said a guide saw it and laughed well all i can say is i think he didn&#39;t know he was looking<br/>
at a BUG.. that is NOT supposed to do that.. Flare had the same problem after thier 2nd major <br/>
patch.. took em 6 weeks to fix. but it&#39;s working now.. so i think it can be patched rather easily <br/>
if they know the cause.<br/>
<br/>
4) Are there more books out there?? new recipies to find, etc... so far I see perhaps 2 items of any USE<br/>
in this trade.. Cams, and possibly the lockpicks.  The rest are for FUN and not really needed in the<br/>
game yet.. (possibly the Stalking probes could be usefull if the duration was not 5 seconds :(<br/>
