<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866149560">random info i have...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;1) The butcher knife quest.  The knife is now lore/no drop so its very<br/>
 </span></blockquote>butchers knife identifies as &#39;Killer&#39;s knife&#39; not very helpful,<br/>
and never found anyone who wanted it...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  On a related note go to the magic hall in Ak&#39;anon and ask Tergon &#39;Who is<br/>
&gt;Meldrath?&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a number of people in and around akanon have things to say about meldrath <br/>
and whatever his group is called, i specifically remember the warriors <br/>
guild, but i think there were others....never got to a related quest out of <br/>
any of them tho...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) Non-rusted Blackbox.  Very rarely when killing clockworks in Steamfont<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thought i had seen a request for these at one point...but couldn&#39;t find it <br/>
again last time i found one...might try doing the warrior quest to give the <br/>
cards to the clockworks and get whatever it was...that seems like it was <br/>
related, tho been a while since i did it...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3) Gnome in Erudin.  Go to the jail cells by the bank and there&#39;s a gnome<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not gotten anything useful out of him...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;4) The Great Span.  This quest probably has nothing to do with tinkering<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i would guess that the heads are wanted by the erudites, since they are <br/>
opposed to the great span, but haven&#39;t heard of any specific quests for <br/>
them...mebbe need to give the letter to some erudite? or find the erudite <br/>
assassins the guy in qeynos is afraid of?<br/>
<br/>
nothing directly useful, but mebbe one of you can find more than i <br/>
did...gotten a bit disillusioned with quests since going thru and doing all <br/>
that i could find when i started(beta4/beginning of release), and finding <br/>
out that many of them would be worth doing now, but not knowing which <br/>
without digging thru spoiler sites, which would ruin the fun anyway :(<br/>
