<div id="ygrps-yiv-480064455">If you&#39;re not currently subscribed, I believe you&#39;re _guaranteed_ 3 months,<br/>
but after that it&#39;s at their discretion. To my knowledge, they&#39;ve never<br/>
deleted an inactive character over level 1 (most pay services don&#39;t, to keep<br/>
people coming back), but keep in mind that they reserve the right to do so.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re still _paying_ for your EQ subscription, they&#39;ll keep your<br/>
characters (over level 1, at least) for an unlimited time even if you don&#39;t<br/>
play. Even when they deleted the level 1 characters, it was only ones that<br/>
hadn&#39;t been played in an extremely long time. I believe the threshold was a<br/>
year of inactivity.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] quick question<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I used to play EQ a lot and still signed up to the<br/>
tinkering newsletter, but my account hasnt been<br/>
&#39;active&#39; in a while, i think i re-signed over last<br/>
thanksgiving (november 2001) just to log in and<br/>
remember the days.  I have a 45 necro and was<br/>
wondering how long my account can be inactive until<br/>
they delete my character (which i dont want to<br/>
happen.)  I thought i read somewhere it was 3 months,<br/>
but I know that when i re-activated my account back in<br/>
november i hadnt played in like 4-5 months and it was<br/>
still there...  anyone know the real answer to this, i<br/>
would really appreciate it :p<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>
