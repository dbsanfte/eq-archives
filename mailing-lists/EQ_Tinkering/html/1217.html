<div id="ygrps-yiv-566785313">You still consume oxygen, so you need to refill those oxygen tubes now and<br/>
then...<br/>
It would make sense if you somehow could recharge these things though... few ppl<br/>
would buy aqua lungs for any reasonably profit bringing price if they last only<br/>
1 charge. Sounds pretty ridiculous to me... oh well...<br/>

well just a few real life facts a rebreather is a device that recycles your own<br/>
air you breath and feeds it back to you after the filter takes out some of the<br/>
carbon dioxide.  So if Verant follows the real thing it should have unlimited<br/>
charges.</div>
