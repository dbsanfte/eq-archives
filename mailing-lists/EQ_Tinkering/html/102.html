<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596401500">I have the Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra (or whatever its called) and i have two staff<br/>
segments. maybe this is what gets combined.  what do ya&#39;ll think?  i have seen<br/>
nothing on the staff segments.  got one off a bandit in east karana and the other<br/>
in a lockbox in highpass hold (bandit has the key).  Been trying to find out what<br/>
the segments are for and how to combine.<br/>

&gt;   Hmm ive heard that to but i talk to a friend on the pvp server and he says<br/>
&gt; he seen the finished product.    I dont think he was making it up casue he<br/>
&gt; confronted me about tinkering and asked if i new how to make one.  Also ive<br/>
&gt; been to a few web sittes that kinda talk about it.  Its mentioned that there<br/>
&gt; is a third componet to combine to make this staff.  To bad they wouldnt say,<br/>
&gt; also the priest discord has that black robe.   When i first started i thought<br/>
&gt; it was just for show but the higher i get in levels i starting to see other<br/>
&gt; people wear this robe.  You can get that robe in a dungeon.   I also tried to<br/>
&gt; combine the skull and rune totum staff and it tells me that they dont<br/>
&gt; combine.<br/>
