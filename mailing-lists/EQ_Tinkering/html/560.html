<div id="ygrps-yiv-21458366">You went there at lvl 20?  With how many people in your group?  Did you talk<br/>
to the gnomes and check for any info?  For the heck of it, I did a /who all<br/>
gnome 40 50 and found one at lvl 43 and asked him about solusek.  He said<br/>
he&#39;s been there and talked to the gnomes and they didn&#39;t have any tinkering<br/>
information.  But he said he doesn&#39;t tinker so he wasn&#39;t specifically<br/>
looking for that kind of info.<br/>

&gt; Sol A is the one with the gnomes.  It is a serverly underutilized level<br/>
20-30<br/>
&gt; dungeon.  For some reason no one really goes there.  But as the only group<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; my friends and I spent level 20-27 there and leveled very quickly and<br/>
relatively<br/>
&gt; safely.  There was rarely more then us 4-6 people in the zone.  Maybe 10<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; at the most. </span></blockquote></div>
