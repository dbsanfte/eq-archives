<b>Subject:</b> Made My First Aqua Lung last night =) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-918978732">Hello Folks,<br/>
<br/>
It was a good day to be a gnome. With the new patch, everything one needs to make the &#39;aqua lung&#39; is at the wind mills except for the fish...heh.<br/>
<br/>
I lucked out and found a &#39;sugar daddy&#39; in my guild who was willing to cough up a ton of cash to let me try a few aqua lung attempts, and I made one first try. I failed the next 3 though and my skill is in the high 80&#39;s now.<br/>
<br/>
But! *FizzWizz starts her mantra* &quot;Verant Bastards!&quot;, Apparently, the aqua lung has ONE CHARGE !! A damn 225 plat or so for a single shot of &#39;dead mans breath&#39; or whatever the water breathing spell is. This could be my imagination, because I only glanced at the stats before I handed it to a Dwarf friend of mine, but I thought I saw 50 charges before I handed it to him. Not sure, but perhaps the Gnome that makes it can get 50, and if you give it to someone else, they get only 1...not sure... I would like some more feedback on this.<br/>
<br/>
So... that leaves us with the &#39;rebreather&#39; version, which probably has unlimited charges. I dont know (need feedback) I have not made one yet. I would like to hear what the stats are on the rebreather if anyone knows.<br/>
<br/>
Also I would like to know if anyone has found diamond dust yet for the gem chopper.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, thats all for now... Just thought folks might like to know.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
