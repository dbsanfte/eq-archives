<b>Subject:</b> Diamond Dust & Aqualungs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020873466">I talked to a GM yesterday about Diamond Dust.  Basically I asked if it was<br/>
in the game and if he could give me any hint.  I was told that it was in<br/>
the game and that I should look toward the Rathe Mountains to some NPCs<br/>
that Crush gems.  I do believe he specifically was refering to the Ogres.<br/>
If I can get my hands on a Diamond that is where I will be trying.<br/>
Unfortunately Diamonds are only droped by Very high level mobs.  Like Plane<br/>
of Fear, Hate kinda places and even then not in abundance.  Ive herd that<br/>
vendors will pay 200pp if you try to sell them a diamond.  So expect to pay<br/>
through the nose for one if you find someone selling.<br/>
<br/>
As for aqualungs, on the next patch the 20th level magician spell summon<br/>
waterstone will most likely be in place.  5 charges of enduring breath.<br/>
That kinda puts a kink in aqualung sales.  Only saving grace is that its a<br/>
no rent stone.  But rumor has it that it won&#39;t be lore, so if you find a<br/>
magician before you head under the waves, you can pick up a pack full.<br/>
Other sad note is that if you should sell an aqualung to a merchant for the<br/>
190 plat they will give you.  The merchant charges 500 plat to buy it back.<br/>
 So unfortunately being that most of our failure rates are around 50% is<br/>
the cost that we need to sell them for to break even.<br/>
Please if your going to make aqualungs and sell them back to vendors.<br/>
Don&#39;t leave any charged on them.  It only helps to ruin the aqualung<br/>
market, whats left of it anyway.<br/>
