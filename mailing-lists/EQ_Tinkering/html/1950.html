<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272468664">To sell cams, dont auction that you are selling them, auction for a good <br/>
fletcher. Once you find one, tell him that you do can do cams and that you <br/>
can give him good prices. Most highskilled fletchers have a gnome tinkerer <br/>
to provide cams for them, and they stick to one person, thats why they are <br/>
hard to sell. Me, I got myself to 185 skill fletching and use the cams <br/>
myself, or will when i have maxed it which i cant afford because of this <br/>
damned tinkering :)<br/>
<br/>
To sell fireworks, make a whole bunch of em, take em with you, and just use <br/>
a few in a dungeon or somewhere where there is a lot of ppl, that will make <br/>
em sell, same with spyglasses, just use em, best way to sell em.<br/>
