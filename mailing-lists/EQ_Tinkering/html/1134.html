<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105417835">Hey my Tinkering friends,<br/>
<br/>
I had a Great time at Gnomefest  dueled a lvl 1 and lost my lvl it was great!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I REALLY hate to burst anyones bubble too much but there is a higher <br/>
lvl item that gives unlimited underwater breathing, yes the fish bone earing. <br/>
 Until verrant makes us a commodity like rogues Make poison, enchanter&#39;s <br/>
Enchant &quot; place your metal here&quot; wizards &quot; I can kill anything faster than <br/>
you AND translocate to a different plane&quot;.  I realize that some of what I <br/>
said are not skills, they are class specific, but I believe you get the <br/>
point.  We need something that only we can make and some people need, <br/>
everything we can make now can be bought, we need to petition for the fishing <br/>
pole to be either unbreakable or take away animated bait and make the <br/>
collapseable fishing pole always have bait, the duration for stalking probes <br/>
to last an entire zone, I am not even going to mention the fireworks, the <br/>
cams that when enchanted increase a stat like delay.  I think we need to <br/>
organize ourselves and I think Rotgut needs to organize us 8)  hee hee. <br/>
Remember anything we dont complain about becomes that wonderful   &quot; feature &quot; <br/>
of the game.  Again not to depress anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Now taking your opinions. And yes all races and classes have a base 50 skill <br/>
in tinker only gnomes can increase the skill, and yes the fishing pole is <br/>
trivial at lvl 1 which makes me wonder why the third book is so elusive.  <br/>

Abat cleric of the once 14 after gnomestock 13 then by the gods of Norrath <br/>
and a wonderful High lvl cleric Cantin I belive ..... 14 again.  Solusek Ro</div>
