<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044014109">tho i&#39;ve heard of a few instances where items can be gotten from doing a <br/>
quest or just killing the person who gives the quest...so possibly we aren&#39;t <br/>
supposed to kill any good gnomes, but it would work anyway...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I highly doubt that the third book or even any tinkering info would be <br/>
&gt;found<br/>
&gt;from killing gnomes.Why would we have to kill our own to get something for <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;gnome only skill.that would mean taking faction hits just to get something<br/>
&gt;that a gnome should have .But thats just my opinion, so im not going out<br/>
&gt;killing any gnomes for it.I think that you are looking in the wrong place <br/>
&gt;by<br/>
&gt;doing that<br/>
