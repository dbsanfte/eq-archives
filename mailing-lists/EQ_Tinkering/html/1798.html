<div id="ygrps-yiv-501315808">THE MINERAL DUFRENITE<br/>
<br/>
Chemistry: Fe5(PO4)3(OH)5 - 2H2O, Hydrated Iron Phosphate Hydroxide. <br/>
Class: Phosphates <br/>
Uses: Only as mineral specimens. <br/>
Specimens <br/>
Dufrenite is a classic phosphate mineral. It is known from classic<br/>
localities in Devon, England and elsewhere. Often associated with other rare<br/>
minerals, dufrenite specimens can easily be a collectors favorite. Although<br/>
not particularly colorful unless fresh, dufrenite&#39;s muted yellowish-brown<br/>
color is none-the-less unique and distinctive. In fact, it produces a nice<br/>
backdrop to the more colorful minerals that may be attached to the rounded<br/>
botryoidal landscape. <br/>
<br/>
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:<br/>
Color is yellowish-green or olive when fresh but turns brown when oxidized. <br/>
Luster is varied from vitreous or silky to dull or earthy. <br/>
Transparency: Specimens are translucent to transparent. <br/>
Crystal System is monoclinic; 2/m <br/>
Crystal Habits include botryoidal and globular masses or tabular crystals.<br/>
Also found in radiating clusters and crusts. <br/>
Cleavage is perfect in two directions. <br/>
Fracture is uneven. <br/>
Hardness is 3.5 - 4.5 <br/>
Specific Gravity is approximately 3.1 - 3.3 (slightly above average). <br/>
Streak is yellow-green. <br/>
Associated Minerals include hureaulite, laubmannite, kidwellite, quartz,<br/>
limonite and rockbridgeite. <br/>
Notable Occurrences include Cornwall, England; Westphalia, Germany; Anglar,<br/>
France and Cherokee County, Alabama, USA. <br/>
Best Field Indicators are crystal habit, color, associations and streak. <br/>

Given this information - that Dufrenite has nothing whatsoever to do with<br/>
Diamond, it would make perfect Verant-sense to have Dufrenite dust be used<br/>
in a recipe that calls for diamond dust...<br/>
<br/>
LOL!<br/>

&gt; Pretty sure it&#39;s Dufrenite.... that&#39;s the stuff used for the <br/>
&gt; Totemic armor<br/>
&gt; quests for Shamans in Lake Rathe.  Well it&#39;s cheaper than <br/>
&gt; tring to crush a<br/>
&gt; diamond I guess ;&gt;  Anyone got the skill to try it ?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I got really frastarated I tell ya looken for that <br/>
&gt; Diamond Dust and<br/>
&gt; Tattred Gnomish Cloak.<br/>
&gt; so I petitioned, and the GM told me it was a Verant GM too, <br/>
&gt; he told me that<br/>
&gt; I should try Crushed Dauphire (not sure about spelling) <br/>
&gt; instead of Diamond<br/>
&gt; Dust. Also about tattred Gnomish Cloak, he said it DOES exist <br/>
&gt; in the game<br/>
&gt; but wont tell me if it is human made or not .<br/>
