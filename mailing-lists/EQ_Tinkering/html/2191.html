<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950586181">instead of a pet w/ charges, why can&#39;t the ets be &quot;deployable&quot;. You tinker a <br/>
pet-in-a-box which wighs, lets say 25. when you want a pet you right click <br/>
the boc. the box&#39;s weight drops to .5, and in about 30 seconds of cast time a <br/>
pet apears. to make the pet refold and go back in it&#39;s box, you right click <br/>
the box again, and afyer another 30 seconds of cast time the pet folds up and <br/>
goes in it&#39;s box. to make sure ppl dont take advantage of ee bags you make <br/>
the box count as a container. if you zoe w/out folding ur pet your pet will <br/>
disapear. Also weight and cast times of the pet and box will very from it&#39;s <br/>
cost, power, and level. IE a level 16 tinkered pet would have a 15 second <br/>
cast, and weigh 10, but is the same as a 16 mage earth pet. however a lv 30 <br/>
tinkered pet would have acast time of 120, and weigh 40.</div>
