<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031942846">Hi my gnome friends<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Atlast i have been getting skill improvments in tinkering, i started out with Flameless lanterns up to 68 and made that on 50-60 lanterns. I did cam�s after that to 75 and have gotten the skill up to 77 on Telescopes. I am lv 31 now and can anyone confirm that my cap is 80 for sure ? if so i have to get up in levels fast as hell couse all my higher level friends what aqua lungs as fast as i can make them it seams. Evryone wants to go to Kedge keep it seams :-)<br/>
<br/>
I must say that it didnt cost me that much to get to 77 skill and now i make Telescopes without to much fails so i can make a profit of them selling them for 100 pp and they sell quite good at that price.<br/>
<br/>
To summ this up should i continue with telescopes or should i go over to stalking probes to get my skill up fast ? i�d rather go with Telescopes if thats possible when the stalking probe is not easy to sell when it has only 5 charges.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One thing more, why the hell can i get 2 failures out of 3 when making a fishing pole ? sometimes i fail so damn much on things that are trivial to me that it eats up the little profit i get. This holds true for cam�s to i havent sold more then 9 of those but when i made 8 for a cusomer the outher day i failed on 2 or 3 when making 8 and selling them for 25 pp will not be profitble if i�m gonna fail that much. I know that i still make money on them but it just nags me that i�m failling to make an item that are trivial especial thos damn fishing poles that are trivial at a kill of 1 if i�m not wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well a rather long story there but i thought i wanted to share this with you who i regards as friends and fellow gnomes.<br/>
