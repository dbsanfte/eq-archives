<div id="ygrps-yiv-767565948">Speaking of weird things in ak&#39;anon, have you ever been to that room in the<br/>
king&#39;s palace that has the glowing white diagram on the floor with a rather<br/>
low level clockwork spider standing on it?  I&#39;m a lvl 22 gnome rogue, and<br/>
thats the only clockwork spider in town that cons green to me.  Plus that<br/>
glowing white design on the floor is unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen in<br/>
ak&#39;anon.  I played a dark elf once, and this design is very much like the<br/>
glowing neon designs in neriak.  I was considering trying to kill that<br/>
clockwork, but there&#39;s a blood red clockwork guard in the room opposite and<br/>
was afraid it might join in.  (not to mention all the other guards in the<br/>
palace)  :)  I also tried hailing the clockwork and clicking all over<br/>
everything in that room and didn&#39;t find anything.  One thing I didn&#39;t try<br/>
was getting someone to click on the rotateing star while I was in that room<br/>
to see if something happens.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m actually interested to the allusion (from the text) that mixing<br/>
&gt; &gt; different amounts of water can cause a different (not necessarily good)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is also the allusion to a storage cavern in akanon.  My theory<br/>
&gt; is that the rotating star thingy opens the door to the cavern and<br/>
&gt; someone figured it all out this weekend. </span></blockquote></div>
