-------------------------------<br/>
Some facts: According to Verant, Tinkering unbalanced the game. This is<br/>
evident by the many items that where removed, statements from Lead GM&#39;s of<br/>
certain servers, and statements from several gnomes that during BETA<br/>
actually saw the items and the books. at least Verant saw fit that they<br/>
unbalanced the game, so they removed them. Second, many of the tinkerable<br/>
items where severly bugged, and do to the release schedule (which was<br/>
hurried out the door in May) caused the work on these items to be diverted<br/>
on others.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the items where magicly charged items. In other words, the item was<br/>
held and then when clicked used a charge and casted the spell that was<br/>
relevant to the item.  For example; Gnomish Goggles are NOT permanent<br/>
goggles that you wear and can see at night, They are the level 16? Heat<br/>
Sight spell that has 5 charges. When right clicked the user uses a charge<br/>
and has Heat sight for its standard duration.  Sorry to spoil it, but this<br/>
is how ALL or most of the items worked.<br/>
Scouts; which are tinkerable now, are the level 8 Eye of Zomm spell with 5<br/>
charges, right clicking uses a charge and gives the user the Eye of Zomm<br/>
view for its standard duration.<br/>
<br/>
Now some info from BETA: According to Eboo (or was it Dworkin?) whom ever it<br/>
was that worked with me and I&#39;m so sorry I forgot your name, but thanks for<br/>
repling to my cries, hehehe) a guild spent over 500 platinum on trying out<br/>
the different tinkerable items that where in the books. I can attest to<br/>
this, because I myself (a Wood Elf ranger that needed a compass but had no<br/>
idea only gnomes could make them). Bought one of the books, and it had the<br/>
info on collapsible fishing poles.<br/>
<br/>
According to these books, the following items could be made:<br/>
<br/>
-Firewater*+<br/>
Mechanical-<br/>
-Compasses?*<br/>
-Flameless Lanterns*+<br/>
-Collapsible fishing poles<br/>
-Mechanized Lockpicks*+<br/>
-Cams*+<br/>
-Thermal Cloaks?*<br/>
-Gnomish Clockwork I (pet rat)<br/>
-Gnomish Clockwork IV (pet spider)<br/>
-Gnomish Clockwork XI (pet gnome male)<br/>
<br/>
Magicly &quot;charged&quot; items<br/>
-Scouts (level 8 Eye of Zomm)*+<br/>
-Spyglasses (level 8 Glimpse )?*<br/>
-Gnomish Fireworks (level 8 Fingers of Fire)<br/>
-Gnomish Goggles (level 16 Heat Sight)<br/>
-Scuba Gear (Level ? Underwater Breathing)<br/>
-Jet Pack (level 24 Levitate)<br/>
<br/>
-Steel Lined Silk armor?*<br/>
<br/>
The ones marked with the (*) asterisks are remnants of the tinkering trade.<br/>
The ones with the (?) question mark are those that where also left, but are<br/>
questionable. Since many of the other components may have been removed,<br/>
these items have been destroyed and cannot be made. Those with a (+) plus<br/>
sign are those I successfully made and sold throughout Greater Faydark and<br/>
Freeport. The charged items can be used by any race/class. This supports the<br/>
theory that Verant removed them becuase of game inbalance.</div>
