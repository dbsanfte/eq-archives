&gt;The shark I found was due south of the &#39;sisters&#39; isle and conned green to<br/>
&gt;me at 34. Its probably in the mid to high 20&#39;s. It didnt attack me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That was the only monster I found underwater so far, except perhaps for a<br/>
&gt;few wading cyclops =).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve managed to piece this together from a lot of rumors... for all of you <br/>
out there with a Fishbone Earring or such.... go to the sisters isle in <br/>
OOT.... have someone find the dwarves at the forge (located on the isle) and <br/>
click on one of the bags located there (heard one is a secret button)... you <br/>
should hear a grating noise... the person with the earring should search <br/>
under the water for an open secret passage that should be open now...<br/>
<br/>
Also, I heard there&#39;s a sunken ship somewhere possibly within the OOT or <br/>
Erud&#39;s Crossing that is it&#39;s own zone. Perhaps one of these suggestions is <br/>
what we seek?<br/>
<br/>
Again - I based all this off of various rumors I heard and pieced together, <br/>
plus the clue &quot;search under the waves&quot;.</div>
