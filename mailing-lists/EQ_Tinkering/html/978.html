<div id="ygrps-yiv-629493162">I&#39;ve been wanting this formula for a long time, and Luke has been looking<br/>
even longer.<br/>
<br/>
3 rods and some gnomish bolts<br/>
<br/>
go figure eh?<br/>
<br/>
Interesting to note, I went through the database and noticed someone had<br/>
tried 2 rods and gnomish bolts, that was the closest anyone came.  I think<br/>
I&#39;l keep the excel format of the database though, just as a tribute to all<br/>
those who tried or emailed me or submitted info in one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
I was disappointed in the fireworks to, I mean, one little teeny tiny PFFT<br/>
and thats it?  I guess if you have 20 or 30 people and they all go PFFT at<br/>
the same time that might be kind of nice, but I&#39;d be embarassed to show up<br/>
at a wedding, promise everyone a gnomish fireworks display, and all I get<br/>
is a PFFT.<br/>
<br/>
But I got my pole, and after 3 attempts I got a spyglass, so I&#39;m a happy<br/>
gnome now, I&#39;ll tinker myself some bait and go fishing at the pool in<br/>
qeynos.  Maybe I&#39;ll get lucky and fish up a Kiolindl fish.  heh heh<br/>
