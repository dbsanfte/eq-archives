&gt;glass,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Finally there is true and FACTUAL confirmation that these items do exist.  <br/>
It is now just a matter of time before the info is commonplace.  Gee, I <br/>
remember crafted armor being pretty rare and no one knew how to do it.  Now, <br/>
every warrior and their cousin wears the stuff, running around like <br/>
varying-sized blueberries.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t blame &quot;Anonymous&quot; for withholding information.  How often do you <br/>
discover something and immediately share it with every Tom, Dick, and Harry <br/>
that comes along?</div>
