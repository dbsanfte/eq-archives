<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-816163124">To let everyone know, in case there are some that don&#39;t already know (I was <br/>
one), Mechanized lockpicks do not provide any increase in stats when <br/>
used.  I have a rogue character and was able to pick a lock in Freeport <br/>
using mechanized lockpicks with a skill level of 125.  I know 120 was not <br/>
sufficient since I received a cannot pick lock message at that level.  When <br/>
I reached skill of 125, the door opened.  I assumed that the mechanized <br/>
lockpicks helped, but when I recently tried regular lockpicks, the door <br/>
opened also.  So basically, there is no difference between the two.  What a <br/>
bunch of crap.<br/>
