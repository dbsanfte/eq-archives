<div id="ygrps-yiv-536004743">Thanks for the report Sniffledoo.  Yes, the coin is for<br/>
another quest, but the underwater part of your report is interesting.  I<br/>
used the underwater breathing spell and searched the deep water area below<br/>
the water wheel looking all over for a secret part of the wall, but found<br/>
nothing.  I think now I&#39;ll try the rest of the Ak&#39;Anon underwater areas<br/>
unless someone else has already done so.  Long ago I heard someone shout in<br/>
Steamfont that the 3rd book was in Akanon somewhere, but that was before I<br/>
got interested in Tinkering (probably before I even knew what Tinkering<br/>
was), so I have no idea how true that information is.  <br/>
<br/>
		As far as other underwater areas to explore where the 3rd<br/>
book might be located that I know of are: 1) Kedge Keep in the Cauldron zone<br/>
(but I hear that zone is not itemized yet until next patch), 2) under lake<br/>
Rathetear there is an area of high level Gobs and 3) in Everfrost there is a<br/>
small underwater area with an NPC who usually attacks anyone on sight.  I<br/>
have not searched any of these areas yet.  Anyone know of other underwater<br/>
areas?<br/>
<br/>
		Good luck brothers and sisters!<br/>
