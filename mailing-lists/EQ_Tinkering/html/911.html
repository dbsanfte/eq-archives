<div id="ygrps-yiv-201937134">If you&#39;ve reached your faction limit, you will no longer get the message that faction is being adjusted.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone know if you will continue to get faction adjustments for<br/>
&gt; completing a quest if you have already completed it before.  I know that it<br/>
&gt; says your faction has been increased, but they could just increase it by<br/>
&gt; 0.  Has anyone successfully raised faction by redoing quests?  If so, the<br/>
&gt; clockwork access card would be a very easy faction adjuster.  Just get a<br/>
&gt; card from Manik, give to the closest clock and get faction adjustment, just<br/>
&gt; repeat it over and over... don&#39;t even give cards to the other three clocks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have never ran into a quest that doesn&#39;t continously raise (or lower) your<br/>
faction.  Tillin in Qeynos loves me, corrupt guards hate me.  Bards think I&#39;m<br/>
the cats meow, and Majoong  Mistmoore has me on his 10 most wanted list.</div>
