<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520262631">You may want to stop as you are throwing a LOT of plat away. I have found<br/>
book XXXIII and it has:<br/>
<br/>
Aqua Lung<br/>
Re-Breather   (Aqua Lung with a longer duration)<br/>
GemCutter     (Not sure what it is, but I think Jewelers will be happy with<br/>
us!)<br/>
<br/>
I *WILL* be giving out the formulas, but I wanted to make some of the items<br/>
to sell first.  I do have a &#39;deal&#39; if anyone wants the formulas early.  I<br/>
want to make these items, but I&#39;m low on cash and need a money backer.  If<br/>
someone is willing to back me, I&#39;ll give them the formula, but with the<br/>
costs of even trying it, it will need a LOT of cash.  I plan on releasing<br/>
all of them no later then December 1st (basically a month).<br/>
<br/>
I sent pages 1 and 2 to Gnomad to prove I have the book (and he can post it<br/>
if he likes, it only shows one part of what you need.  I do not suggest just<br/>
throwing things into our toolbox, it uses items that are NOT tinker items<br/>
(like fireworks used batwings) so you will never just guess it.<br/>
<br/>
Estimated costs are about 200 for aqualung, about 500 - 600 for the<br/>
rebreather, and I&#39;m not sure on the GemCutter as it needs a part I have<br/>
never seen or heard of, but I think about 100-200 plat.<br/>
<br/>
And GNOME, these things are expensive! Especially the rebreather.<br/>

These are failures...<br/>
<br/>
1 Fastener<br/>
1 Fish Scale<br/>
1 Rod<br/>
1 Bolts<br/>
1 Gear<br/>

1 Fastener<br/>
1 fish scale<br/>
1 Shaft<br/>
1 bolts<br/>
1 sprocket<br/>

1 Fastener<br/>
1 fish scale<br/>
1 Rod<br/>
1 bolt<br/>
1 sprocket<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
1 fastener<br/>
1 Fish scale<br/>
1 shaft<br/>
1 bolt<br/>
1 twine<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The series here is a combo of 5 with a fish scale,a fastener and 3 other<br/>
components.<br/>
Help me finish this series out by trying some of the other components at the<br/>
mills and letting folks here know<br/>
 what you have failed on. I have reason to believe this is close to the<br/>
&#39;scuba gear&#39; recipe<br/>
<br/>
