<div id="ygrps-yiv-103327052">Ugh.  It was me who said I saw the guy with the spyglasses.  His name was<br/>
Salvador (i think), on Xegony.  He is a higher lvl gnome (above 40 i<br/>
believe) but I don&#39;t know what guild he was in, you&#39;ll have to figure that<br/>
out yourself.  I have for the most part quit EQ because of time, so I cannot<br/>
&quot;infiltrate&quot;.  Good luck.<br/>

&gt; I have heard no word from our infiltrator, maybe he doesn&#39;t want to?<br/>
&gt; If you aren&#39;t going to, Mr. Infiltrator, then please, tell me the name of<br/>
&gt; the guild so I can do it. Yes, thats right, I elect myself to do it, why?<br/>
&gt; Well for one thing I can get to a high level quickly. I can get a gnomish<br/>
&gt; warrior to level 8 in about a day or so easy, so that way I wouldn&#39;t walk<br/>

&gt; good at persuasion. (I mean, have any of you ever sold a book of Dischord<br/>
&gt; for one plat before?) I would get in swiftly, then discreetly extract the<br/>
&gt; information. I&#39;d get it casually and without any suspicion. That is why I<br/>
&gt; think having me to do it would be the best, and quickest way. Let&#39;s not<br/>
