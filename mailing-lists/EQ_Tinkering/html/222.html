<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lets find Bidl Frugin <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831589197">Well, I camped out in the mino cave for a couple of hours last night.  Just <br/>
saw Lorand Diddlenob (sp?) and Theathertag something, both gnomes, fighting <br/>
the minos there.  Neither would respond to may hails (when visible).  Maybe <br/>
I need better faction.  The two will die occasionally and I have been <br/>
hoping Bidl will spawn in there place, but I dont know.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in Kaladim, i&#39;m viewed amiably by the dwarves (for some reason) but <br/>
the dwarf in the mino cave views me apprehensively.  Also, the wood elfs in <br/>
Kelethin view my apprehensively, but the wood elf in the mino cave views me <br/>
amiably.  Weird!</div>
