<div id="ygrps-yiv-784956437">While I agree that Verant is sick & twisted, you are confusing two quests.  The Evil<br/>
Eye is part of the Observer Staff Quest and originates at an Observitory.  The<br/>
Telescope Lens Quest orignates in the Wizards? Guild and it requires you to get four<br/>
lenses.  None of them are on Borxx.  Two are given to you by the observitories.  One<br/>
is obtained by killing a 14ish (and nasty) DE in Freeport, and the last is on this<br/>
missing gnome.  Please also note that this quest will not be given to wizards above<br/>
level 12.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Believe it , verant has this sick and twisted thing about making quests<br/>
&gt; ungettable at higher levels, and impossible for low levels to actually<br/>
&gt; solve, for instance this quest. one of the lens you need tog et from<br/>
&gt; Borxx, a level *30*+ Evil Eye. With verants normal sense of rewards well<br/>
&gt; get 20 exp pts, a faction adjustment and a tarnished dagger as reward,<br/>
&gt; note this is a step up from the usual rusty dagger they give us.<br/>
&gt;  another example (again gnome) get tergons spellbook, OK this spawns on<br/>
&gt; a level 18 or so mob... your reward for solving the quest? a level 4<br/>
&gt; mage spell. </span></blockquote></div>
