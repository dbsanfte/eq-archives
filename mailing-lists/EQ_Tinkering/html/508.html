&gt;actually you can make the pole in the game. that doesn&#39;t mean this guy <br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;lying, but if he&#39;s telling the truth perhaps there&#39;s a clue there. Start<br/>
&gt;thinking like a child!<br/>

evidence indicating that the collapsible fishing pole is anything more than <br/>
a wild goose chase.<br/>
<br/>
I will reiterate my earlier statement about &quot;secrets of Everquest&quot;.. They <br/>
never remain a secret for any extended period of time.  There are just too <br/>
many players, ensuring that there is a healthy population of people that <br/>
will tell the world anything new that they find.  This isn&#39;t a bad thing, <br/>
but I really find it hard to believe that there are items out there in <br/>
Everquest that only a select few know about.  In time, it gets posted on a <br/>
web page.</div>
