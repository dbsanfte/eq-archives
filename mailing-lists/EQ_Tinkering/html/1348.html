<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759888298">Somebody brought up the point that Aqua Lungs are NOT NEEDED. ok, lets use <br/>
some logic to figure this out.  Example: you are in a mall and you happen to <br/>
see, say, a golden chain. you dont need a golden chain but are intrigued by <br/>
it so you check it out. $200! you say. &quot;HELL NO.&quot; you think. &quot;too much.&quot; <br/>
i.e. customer walks away and sale is not made.  ok. same scenario..you are <br/>
in a mall and you happen to see, say, a golden chain. you dont need a golden <br/>
chain but are intrigued by it so you check it out. $80. &quot;wow. thas a good <br/>
price!&quot; ok. FIRST OFF, the customer, who didnt even need a golden chain in <br/>
the first place is ALREADY considering the purchase. this would not be the <br/>
case if the price were, oh, say $200.  the customer would have disregarded <br/>
the purchase right away because high prices are a turn -off.  yur already <br/>
halfway to a sale! congrats! so, say you offer something else that makes the <br/>
sale almost unresistable ( time for you to get creative..i wont divulge my <br/>
own methods). now the customer is almost ready to buy the item...he/she is <br/>
already considering the money they have in his/her pocket and, basically <br/>
talking themselves into buying said merchandise (ppl do this all the time, <br/>
they tell themselves it is a GREAT deal and they prolly wont find it ever <br/>
again..etc..etc) now for people skills. if yur good, the sale is complete, <br/>
and you walk away with money in your pocket, as well as a satisfied <br/>
customer. does this sound logical? ok, now take the prices i used, divide by <br/>
2, and multiply by 10. Voila! Cest-Magifique! (my price vs these (fill in <br/>
derogatory name here) suggested retail price)<br/>
btw... i HIGHLY encourage ppl on Veeshan (Askur&#39;s server), Zinken&#39;s server, <br/>
and Gagaliya&#39;s server and show these &quot;buisness experts&quot; just how you can <br/>
very easily:<br/>
<br/>
1.)create a loyal customer base<br/>
2.)make many ppl VERY happy/satisfied<br/>
3.)make plenty of cash to tinker on<br/>
4.)how to flatline your opponent&#39;s (in this case one of the 3 said arses) <br/>
Tinkering income.<br/>
<br/>
take care honest gnomes out there.<br/>
