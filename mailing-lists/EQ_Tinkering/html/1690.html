<div id="ygrps-yiv-813448526">Well Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I finally made it! After a long and depressing road I finally built up the skill needed to make the tinkered rebreathers. But, they are too dang heavy! At a cost of 3250 (price I&#39;m trying to sell them for) peaple are reluctant to buy them since they weigh 10 stone.<br/>
<br/>
Its time every gnome on the list here did a &quot;/feedback&quot; and tell Verant they need to reduce the weigh on them to 5 stone. We have had enough trouble making and selling them as it is.<br/>
<br/>
Just do it, a quick 30 second note will go a long way.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
