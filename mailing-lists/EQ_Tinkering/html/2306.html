<div id="ygrps-yiv-750124259">The reports of new quests are already starting to come in from this latest<br/>
patch.  Just about everyone is looking for a lead on one or more of the new<br/>
FA Type quests.  While looking around the Safehouse (rogue message board) I<br/>
found a post where someone found some interesting information.<br/>
<br/>
The NPC who mentions the following information can be found on the top<br/>
floor of the Vasty Deep Inn in Erudin.<br/>
----------<br/>
-Stofo Olan says &#39;Good day, I have discovered something truly wonderful! If<br/>
I only had the materials required so I can copy my notes and send them to<br/>
my teacher. <br/>
-You say, &#39;who is your teacher?&#39;<br/>
-Stofo Olan says &#39;My teacher is Jeb Lumsed. He was last seen in the regions<br/>
of the newly discovered lands. If you wish to find him that is where you<br/>
must seek him out. <br/>
-Jaxel says, &#39;what materials?&#39;<br/>
-Stofo Olan says &#39;The materials I need are a mechanical pen, ink of the<br/>
dark, and white paper. Bring me those and I will give you a copy of this<br/>
information. <br/>
-Jaxel says, &#39;where mechanical pen?&#39;<br/>
-Stofo Olan says &#39;The answer you seek is in your question. If you are<br/>
unable to figure it out, then perhaps you are not ready to travel along<br/>
this path. <br/>
-Jaxel says, &#39;what is ink of the dark?&#39;<br/>
-Stofo Olan says &#39;Dark illusions, thievery, and the plague of the living<br/>
will guide you. These are the only hints I can provide. Safe travels and<br/>
may you be protected from all maladies. <br/>
-Jaxel says, &#39;what is white paper?&#39;<br/>
-Stofo Olan says &#39;It may seem like ordinary paper at first. However, this<br/>
paper was enchanted by a friend of mine. This paper was given to a lass in<br/>
the Karanas to help with her writings. The paper will guide her hands and<br/>
draw forth the thoughts in her mind. I no longer have any and I have not<br/>
had contact with my friend in some time. Search them out. <br/>
<br/>
In this excerpt from the log file that I cut and pasted here you will<br/>
notice the mention of a mechanical pen.  Its totally unconfirmed but this<br/>
is a possible lead in to a new tinkering item that may become creatable<br/>
soon or is now creatable.<br/>
<br/>
In another post, one most assuredly designed for the warrior quest an NPC<br/>
was found in OOT, on the Aviak Island, that requires the following item to<br/>
complet his portion of the quest.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Denken Strongpick says &#39;I would be willing to part with this very fine<br/>
blade for; a keg of Vox tail ale, a block of permafrost to keep it cool and<br/>
two new rebreathers to get this operation back underway.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While this may not be the use for rebreathers that we all wanted, it does<br/>
make them a bit more needed than the FB earing, atleast for something.<br/>
