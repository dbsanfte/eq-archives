<br/>
Someone wanted to know the cost of the spyglass.  He was charging 40-50p for<br/>
the spyglasses, so figure it from there.  I believe it takes about 20p for<br/>
the parts for the spyglass, not including the fishing pole, so either the<br/>
pole is cheaply made, or he wasn&#39;t making much of a profit.  Also, has<br/>
anyone else here actually talked with him?<br/>
