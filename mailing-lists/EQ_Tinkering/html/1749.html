<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-760523975">Well here is my thought. Has any one Tried a Re-enforced leather Cloak? I<br/>
know it sounds a little far Fetched, BUT that Cloak has Metal Strips sewn<br/>
into it. I think since you guys are try your best to figure this out that<br/>
you should look at it from every angle. I know it says Tattered Gnomes<br/>
Cloak, but who is to say that it does not turn into one once you use the<br/>
Re-enforced Cloak? Well I thought I would through my 2cp in there.<br/>
<br/>
Oh Before I forget, Has any one tried to tailor one with a Ruined Wolf Pelt,<br/>
Cloak Pattern & maybe the Metal Rods? Maybe try Tailoring & then Tinkering.<br/>
What I would think would be that the Cloak would be Tailored then Take the<br/>
cloak, a Belt of some type, & Firewater & then combine them in a Toolbox to<br/>
get the final Product. Or take the Pelt, Cloak Pattern, Rods, Belt, &<br/>
Firewater & combine it all in the Toolkit. Cause to me it is saying with the<br/>
Rods in the Cloak it HAS to be done with the Pattern & not a Finished<br/>
Product, just like the Re-enforced leather.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] Thermal Cloak ideas<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I failed on my two attempts to make a mechanized lockpick<br/>
(I only had 2 lockpicks).  Expensive failures.<br/>
I know I had the right items thanks to Gnomad&#39;s research.<br/>
I was sadden to discover it was no longer publically accessable.<br/>
<br/>
I remember seeing at EQVault that Tinkerer Fulcrum had<br/>
recently opened his library, but other than a quick summary<br/>
visit, I didn&#39;t have time to read it all in one sitting.<br/>
<br/>
I searched through the archives here and found the reference again:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/eqtinker">http://www.geocities.com/eqtinker</a><br/>
(I added it into the EQ_Gnomes community links also).<br/>
<br/>
I checked the research notes on the Failed Thermal Cloak Recipes<br/>
and have some ideas of my own to throw out.  Time to Prattle.<br/>
<br/>
from Gimblestan XV<br/>
&quot;The Firewater flask, carefully positioned on my belt, causes<br/>
no hindrance to my movement, and the Metal Rods sewn in to the<br/>
Tattered Gnomish Cloak conduct the heat well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A small patchwork cloak has been described as tattered,<br/>
but would the Thermal Cloak have the same class and/or<br/>
race/size restrictions?<br/>
<br/>
Cloth capes are open to all, but there is still the size issue.<br/>
<br/>
Raw Silk is Caster/Monk restricted however One size does fit all!<br/>
<br/>
While Meditating, I contemplated that &quot;on my belt&quot; may mean a Belt Pouch!<br/>
Upto 4 Firewater flasks would make it very very warm for chilly bones.<br/>
Alas I have a feeling that no amount of stuffing will allow one to fit<br/>
in either a sewing kit nor the toolbox, but I still wonder if it could<br/>
be part of the final formula. /Shrug<br/>
<br/>
I am far from being a language scholar, but taken literally<br/>
as past discoveries have proven:<br/>
&quot;The Firewater Flask&quot; would be just one - we hope.<br/>
&quot;Metal Rods&quot; would imply there is more than one,<br/>
             just a guess as to how many.<br/>
<br/>
I am a beginning tailor so the reference to &#39;sewn&#39; does make one<br/>
ponder about adding rods with pelts and patterns.<br/>
Would Tinkering really require other than our toolboxes?<br/>
Yes, Yes, Tailored cloaks, but only Bom Knowtood in the<br/>
Steamfont Mills sells the needed rods.  /shutter at the thought of...<br/>
<br/>
Funny how the Collapsable Fishing pole required three rods<br/>
when the research from Tinkerer Rotgut McDougle notes<br/>
didn&#39;t reflect anyone using that many with Gnomish bolts...<br/>
