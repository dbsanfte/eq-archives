<div id="ygrps-yiv-406083634">When I was running around akanon today to find some merchant that sold <br/>
jewelry stuff I ran into King Akanon. And I noticed something. He&#39;s not a <br/>
gnome. I mean why would we have a King that isn&#39;t a gnome? Or if he is the <br/>
King why doesn&#39;t he have anything on? He&#39;s naked (no visible items). Also <br/>
when I went to the top of the King Akanon Palace I found something that looks <br/>
like an arrow. It points to the merchant that sells fishing stuff that is to <br/>
the left of the big waterfall near entrance.</div>
