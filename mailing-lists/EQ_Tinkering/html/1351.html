<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099199730">With all due respect, everything  tinkers can make is as useless as<br/>
fireworks when it comes to price vs what you get, I can buy a riptide spear<br/>
for way less than 1500 plat and it does the same thing for me that the<br/>
rebreather does. Stalking probes might as well be garbage. people trying to<br/>
sell them for 50pp on my server (LOL), I hate the eye of zomm spell<br/>
(although it WOULD be fun to have unlimited charges) enough already but why<br/>
would anyone pay 10pp for one charge of eye of zomm? that is crazy</div>
