<div id="ygrps-yiv-496916131">Tinkering is not &quot;worth it&quot; because really there is very little of any thing<br/>
useful you can make.  Unless you want to make cams for bows. Instead of calling<br/>
the skill tinkering and making it seperate they should have just incorportated<br/>
it into fletching and then it would have been much more &quot;worth it.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I went ahead and talked to a gm and a bunch of higher level gnomes.  From<br/>
&gt; &gt; the high levels gnomes I got the impression that tinkering was a complete<br/>
&gt; &gt; and total waste of time.  In fact one told me he didn&#39;t do it because the<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill sucked and it wasn&#39;t worth it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Since when were ANY of the trade skills &quot;worth it?&quot; I don&#39;t think what<br/>
&gt; drives people to learn skills have anything to do with making money (at<br/>
&gt; least not since they nerfed pottery) it&#39;s some other sense of expanding<br/>
&gt; their character. No one makes any money on any of the skills and yet<br/>
&gt; people still do them for several reasons. In fact my character right now<br/>
&gt; is working on baking, tailoring, blacksmithing, and jewlcraft.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; losing lots of money but I&#39;m having a great time. When I reach 16, you<br/>
&gt; better believe I&#39;m going to work my tinkering. Just because I can.  So<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t try and tell me that tinkering isn&#39;t &quot;worth it.&quot;<br/>
