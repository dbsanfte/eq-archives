<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532722212">Fellow tinkerers...<br/>
I have begun a process on Bertoxxulous Server to unite the Gnomes of Norrath<br/>
under one banner.<br/>
I have started the Guild GNOME FORCE!!<br/>
This Guild is comprised of GNOMES GNOMES GNOMES!!!<br/>
We will be tackling all things Gnomish including the ever elusive Tinkering<br/>
Problems we all seem to be having.<br/>
If anyone is on bertoxx or wants a guild that will cater to their every<br/>
gnomish need then Gnome Force is the guild for you.<br/>
our guildhall will soon be going up with a compilation of all thinks<br/>
tinkered once this is set we will post here any new finding we may have to<br/>
share our wealth of knowledge. All we ask is that if you have a small tidbit<br/>
of interest let us know we would love to swap knowledge with our fellow<br/>
gnomes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening and good hunting.<br/>
