Today I heard the words  &quot;What is diamond dust used for?&quot; and I just<br/>
couldn&#39;t<br/>
believe my ears when i was outside PAW......a 25th  high elf enchanter was<br/>
asking this in &quot;Out of Character&quot;  while on the Fennin Ro Server in the Zone<br/>
of South Karanna..........I thought he may have been pullling my leg ,but I<br/>
dont think so..... i tried  really hard to get the info first before telling<br/>
him, but once he sold the dust and found out what it was used for from<br/>
someone else he clamed up and wouldnt say where ....He got me soo<br/>
pissed!!.....Im at work now so i dont have the name handy of this whacked<br/>
guy<br/>
 that found the dust ,but I will post it when  i get home by 8 am tomorrow<br/>
eastern standard time .Need to constantly bug this guy if were gong to get<br/>
any clue on this Location......This really happened people, this is no<br/>
bull...There is a Good possibility the Diamond Dust lies within the zone of<br/>
South Karana....If i find the source i will post it......Sincerely<br/>
