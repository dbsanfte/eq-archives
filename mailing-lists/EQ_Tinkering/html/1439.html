<div id="ygrps-yiv-71335236">Get Ready for ALOT of emails. Well at first level all the way up to 16th<br/>
it can only be raised by buying a tool box and starting you tinkering. There<br/>
are many guides on the net one good one thou not complete is at<br/>
www.everlore.com. I suggest look there when you get a chance they have alot<br/>
of help there. But if you lack the time. Get alot of money saved up and at<br/>
16 buy tinker up as high as you can and then build Gnomish firewater until<br/>
its trivial then just start on the next best thing the list was passed out a<br/>
minute ago but if you didn&#39;t get it here ya go.<br/>
