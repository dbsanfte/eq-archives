  Tinkering being after Poison,&nbsp;that it was next,&nbsp;however, for now, 
  I&#39;ll be content to wait and see what happens with tinkering in the next month 
  or so.&nbsp; The last few&nbsp;patches have brought about a lot of changes in 
  various trade skills.&nbsp; Many were merely fixes to things that were not 
  working, but several have been additions.&nbsp; One of these to smithing, 
  allows the smith to create arrow heads, albeit for around the same cost as 
  simply buying the arrow heads.&nbsp; Their have been several things&nbsp;being 
  done on test too, such as tinted armor, different types of armor, 
  and&nbsp;some additions to tailoring (these I have&nbsp;tested myself).&nbsp; 
  I have also heard rumors of&nbsp;being able to craft enchanted items, such as 
  weapons, but have not verified this myself.&nbsp; Most of these new additions 
  aren&#39;t really money sinks either (tinted armor may be).&nbsp; I&#39;m hoping this 
  boasts well for the future of tinkering.&nbsp; They are actively working on 
  the upgrades&nbsp;and small things, and the person who they have doing 
  it&nbsp;doesn&#39;t seem to be solely interested in creating a money sink, so it 
  may very well be a good thing that tinkering has been put off.&nbsp; Would you 
  rather have a money sink implemented a couple months ago, or a viable usefull 
  skill implemented next month?&nbsp; I am also looking for an improvement to 
  the fletching skill for my ranger, and a general upgrade to archery though I 
  don&#39;t think the later will happen.</span></font></font></font></div>

  after 1.&nbsp; No one believes<br>&gt; that means 2 comes sometime after 1,
