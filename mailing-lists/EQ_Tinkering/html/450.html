<div id="ygrps-yiv-997464102">Well I have the highest possible faction (reguards you kindly or something)<br/>
and none of those people have said anything different to me.  I&#39;ve done<br/>
pretty much all the other quests that work. (the cargo clockwork never<br/>
worked)  You know I had the same idea about the zookeeper.  :)  But when you<br/>
go down to him, he has a different name.  The zookeeper in the book was<br/>
something like Vlsgig.<br/>

&gt; Maybe we are looking in the wrong areas.   I was thinking last night while<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was sleeping and having those EQ dreams I often do from playing so much.<br/>
&gt; That maybe its a faction issue.   I would like to try this but I am a<br/>
necro<br/>
&gt; and it would be very difficult and I will do nothing but obtain KOS status<br/>
&gt; with the Dark reflection. </span></blockquote></div>
