I have heard no word from our infiltrator, maybe he doesn&#39;t want to?<br/>
If you aren&#39;t going to, Mr. Infiltrator, then please, tell me the name of <br/>
the guild so I can do it. Yes, thats right, I elect myself to do it, why? <br/>
Well for one thing I can get to a high level quickly. I can get a gnomish <br/>
warrior to level 8 in about a day or so easy, so that way I wouldn&#39;t walk up <br/>
being level 1, and suspiciously ask to join. Also, I personnaly think I&#39;m <br/>
good at persuasion. (I mean, have any of you ever sold a book of Dischord <br/>
for one plat before?) I would get in swiftly, then discreetly extract the <br/>
information. I&#39;d get it casually and without any suspicion. That is why I <br/>
think having me to do it would be the best, and quickest way. Let&#39;s not <br/>
waste hundereds of platinum pieces everyday, looking for a one in a million <br/>
formula!<br/>
Come on, who&#39;s with me!?<br/>
