<div id="ygrps-yiv-945534052">The Aqualung has charges of &quot;breath of the dead&quot;.  Just look at the pics on<br/>
the tinkering site.  The rebreather is the one that has a perpetual enduring<br/>
breath effect.  Breath of the dead is a self only necro spell.  Obviously<br/>
there so that you don&#39;t use the charges to cast the effect on somebody else.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what the difference is in duration (having never played a necro<br/>
past 7th) but it&#39;s quite possible it&#39;s longer than enduring breath.<br/>

Also about buying 50 enduring breath potions,<br/>
supposedly the charges in the aqualung last much<br/>
longer then enduring breath</div>
