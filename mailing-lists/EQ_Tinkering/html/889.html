the above site&#39;s message boards&gt;<br/>

The message subject was &quot;Just made a collapsible fishing pole&quot; or some such..<br/>

                                                                                <br/>
 Not gonna spoil it for ye all though, ye gotta kill Meldrath for the recipes.  <br/>
                                                                                <br/>

Also, of a side note, Meldrath will be holding one of the components for the new<br/>
ranger only armor thats coming in with the next patch :)<br/>
So, if he does indeed carry tinkering recipes, it should soon become apparent,<br/>
as all those rangers go gunning for him :)<br/>
