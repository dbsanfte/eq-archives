<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963367469">Yesterday I was fighting in CB and two GMs walked by me (yes I know how rare <br/>
that is) then I asked them both if they know ANYTHING about tinkering skill <br/>
in terms of lowering component prices increasing skill rates or even reusable <br/>
pieces and they said and I quote &quot;I honestly have no idea as to future plans <br/>
of tinkering skill&quot; so maybe this is helpful maybe it is not.  Remember that <br/>
I asked 2 GMs at the same time and they both gave the same answer.<br/>
