<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316575978">Yes Lore...didnt i say that? :) My bad. I was typing in a hurry.  They are no<br/>
longer lore, however...after hunting them tonight, it still apears to be<br/>
broken.   We gatered 3 boxes full of the &quot;very tiny crumpled skeleton&quot;, (Which<br/>
when identify is cast on them are found to be &quot;undead brownie&quot;) but were not<br/>
able to get them to combine in the box.  They spawn in North K near the gypsy<br/>
camp and wander around.  You may need to start the quest with Drexlin to make<br/>
them pop.  Found him upstairs in the bridge tower.  Also tryied giving him the<br/>
skeletons in the box uncombined. Didn&#39;t work.  I say keep trying it and see if<br/>
it gets fixed.<br/>
