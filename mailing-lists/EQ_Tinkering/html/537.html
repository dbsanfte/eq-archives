<div id="ygrps-yiv-916336950">I reread my message, and these words below basically do explain what I was <br/>
being like.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From: Michael Ott &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mott@...">mott@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You are an asshole<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I apologize, I didn&#39;t mean to come off sounding so pompous, and arrogant. I <br/>
really was being pathetically immature, I guess it was just becuase I had <br/>
just gotten a clue, that really helps the discovery or the pole. You see it <br/>
would clear up alot, but I don&#39;t wish to tell because, I swore to the one <br/>
who told me the clue that I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone what it was that he said, <br/>
and I don&#39;t want to dishonor him, or myself. They hold this secret pretty <br/>
close to thier hearts, and take it pretty seriously. I didn&#39;t want to <br/>
decieve this person. I can, when I want to, use words with the most <br/>
excellent of skill, like when I got a clue from the guy that part of this <br/>
unknown organization, and I can also be a jerk and come off sounding like an <br/>
8 year old troll, as you have learned, well I&#39;m sorry, and I hope you can <br/>
understand why I feel that I must keep my knowledge a secret for now.</div>
