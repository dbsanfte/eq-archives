<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252132733">Forgive me if this sounds &quot;new&quot; as i have just joined Everquest Last <br/>
night, but i have tried searching for any information on the <br/>
whereabouts of clockwork information, and I havent found anthing to <br/>
dissuade my inquiry.<br/>
<br/>
There is a Gnome in the 3rd tower with a pet Clockwork Spider <br/>
named &quot;Charlotte&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are 5 distinct types of clockworks that i have seen: Male Rat, <br/>
Female Rat, Spider, Female Humanoid, Male Humanoid.<br/>
<br/>
Parts for the majority of these creatures can be found in abundance <br/>
outside Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried Merging the various parts to constuct a Pet <br/>
Clockwork?</div>
