&lt;&lt; I do enjoy the fact that someone was willing to share the secrets of that <br/>
 tinkering book with us.<br/>
 <br/>
 Now, on to your question about the quote you have posted:<br/>
 <br/>
 The person known as Joshua Bednarz said the quote, multiple times if I <br/>
 remember correctly.  This is also the guy that claims his little brother <br/>
 posted as him, claimed to have gained supersecret important information <br/>
 about tinkering, claimed to have communicated with important tinering <br/>
 people, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
 Trust this person no more.  Everything he has said up to this point can be <br/>
 considered falsehoods.  I know not why he wasted the time of everyone on <br/>
 this list, flooded their mailboxes with trash, or claimed to have any real <br/>
 information whatsoever.  If it indeed was a joke, his laugh upon us has <br/>
 seriously backfired.  To you, Joshua Bednarz, if that really is your real <br/>
 name, I salute you for a job well screwed.  I would hire you to work for the <br/>
 other guy.  I would ask you for a handshake, then say &quot;too slow&quot; and jerk my <br/>
 hand away.  I say &quot;neener neener&quot; to you and your descendants for 3 <br/>
 generations of twins.  I wiggle my bum at thee.  School children pass by and <br/>
 snicker at you.  You would fail as court jester.  No one would come to your <br/>
 hanging.  When you go shopping, people hand you clues.  When the waiter <br/>
 gives you the check he says &quot;oh, its you, nevermind&quot;.  Girl scouts wouldn&#39;t <br/>
 wash your car at Hardees.  The gas station attendant won&#39;t give you the <br/>
 bathroom key, even if you pay him.  Dogs hump your leg at every bar and <br/>
 dance club.  Ugly women won&#39;t even date you.<br/>
 <br/>
 You, sir, have been flamed.  Burn for TTL= -1.<br/>
 <br/>
 And now, for useful tinkering info.<br/>
 <br/>
 There are 4 pieces from the gnomes in Solusek that might be logically useful <br/>
 for tinkering: Small Power Source, Large Power Source, Functional Force <br/>
 Module, Broken Force Module.  The following combinations have failed to <br/>
 produce anything:<br/>
 <br/>
 Functional Force Module + Large Power Source<br/>
 Broken Force Module + Small Power Source<br/>
 Broken Force Module + Broken Force Module<br/>
 <br/>
 You may ask why I tried such strange combinations but not a logical flow.  <br/>
 Well, the items don&#39;t load evenly.  I have a lot of broken pieces, one or <br/>
 two small power sources, and I used up the only functional force module and <br/>
 large power source I had.  So, if these really are tinkerable, it will prove <br/>
 a pain to gather materials to use them.<br/>

Oh man I just have to say this is some funny shit!!!!!!!!!!  LOL.   And josh <br/>
