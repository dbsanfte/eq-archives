FUN IN TEMPLE OF SOL RO  2:41PM PST    Palamides<br/>
<br/>
Well, not much to report, but I was exploring the Temple of Solusek Ro, and<br/>
I clicked on bookcase type thing, and there was a passage behind a fake<br/>
wall... I went down, and there was an Efreeti by a huge stream of Lava<br/>
coming from the ceiling. When I hailed this guy, I lost faction with<br/>
&quot;Faction 415&quot; which is apparently Solusek Ro temple people. I am now indif<br/>
compared to my old &quot;amiable&quot;. A Guide who was around at the time noticed<br/>
this, and as a joke, hailed the efreeti about 15 times. This resulted in the<br/>
whole room attacking the guide, and the guide had to suicide the whole room<br/>
of NPCs. Interesting tidbit I thought. He also promised me a dynamic quest<br/>
for gnomes coming up.<br/>
