<div id="ygrps-yiv-794528282">hmm...did some empirical testing, and generalized a bit to get<br/>
125970 possibilities for 13 items in 8 slots....or mebbe 14 items...mighta <br/>
counted empty twice...hmmm...<br/>
or 1820 possibilities for 4 slots...<br/>
<br/>
thinking is fun...<br/>

&gt; &gt;current guess is 13^8/8!...~20231<br/>
&gt; &gt;or 13^4/4!=~1120 for 4 slots used...<br/>
&gt; &gt;hmmm...that seems to be not quite right either...dunno...gonna have to go<br/>
&gt; &gt;find some old textbooks or something...<br/>

&gt;I think the way you came up with that formula is good. (It must be, because<br/>
&gt;it was what I came up with at first, lol)<br/>
&gt;Problem is it is wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Suppose we have 13 types of items in 100 slots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That gives us 13^100/100! which is less than 1. (Can&#39;t be right.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The other problem I had with it is that it does not produce an integer<br/>
&gt;number. What is 0.3 combinations?<br/>
