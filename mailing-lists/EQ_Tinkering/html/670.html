<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361464464">Hello all<br/>
I am new to this email list as this is my 1st gnome<br/>
I, as have all of you checked all the web sites and made the basics, <br/>
lanterns, bait, compass, cams etc...i have done nothing as i am sure all u <br/>
have but pump money into the skill and into supplies. We all know that much <br/>
of what we make is useless, Lets hope this will change I have made only 4 <br/>
points in the skill and it has cost me considerable money, but I am holding <br/>
onto th notion that many of the BETTER items can be produced given time and <br/>
levels and a cooperative spirit that we share information. <br/>
Lets keep at it<br/>
