<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895917743">Last night&#39;s attempts resulted in no luck again.  I think we&#39;re right with<br/>
the metal shaft and rod combos but we&#39;re missing something.  Here&#39;s a few<br/>
of my thoughts thus far:<br/>
<br/>
- Fletching strings or dwarven wire as a component seems unlikely.<br/>
Although some items need things MADE by other trade skills (compass), I<br/>
can&#39;t think of anything that requires you buy components from a different<br/>
trade skill.  Dwarven wire is for the Trueshot Bow quest (?) and takes a<br/>
while to obtain - lots of travelling.<br/>
<br/>
- Spiderling silk sounds like a good possibility.  Watch out though, there<br/>
is SPIDER silk, and SPIDERLING silk.  The latter seems more likely as<br/>
spiderlings are right in Steamfont and it would be very similar to how the<br/>
lockpicks need a rat ear.<br/>
<br/>
- Spriket?  Assuming that the two books are all that exists of tinkering<br/>
now, a spriket is the only item not used for any project.  What is a<br/>
spriket though?  Not in the dictionary...<br/>
<br/>
- Raw bamboo doesn&#39;t seem like a likely component.  It is a bard<br/>
instrument, also the pic of the collapsible pole shows it constructed of<br/>
metal.<br/>
<br/>
- A bottle as a possible component.<br/>
