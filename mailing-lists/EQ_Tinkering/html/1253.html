<div id="ygrps-yiv-745570040">The GM is mistaken.  Whether it&#39;s a bug or not, the Tinkering skill<br/>
follows the same rules as Caster research.  The level is capped at<br/>
(level -15) * 5.  The reason you didn&#39;t gain a single point is because<br/>
at Level 31, 80 skill is your max.  Wait until Level 32 and try again.<br/>
You should go up 5 pts and stop at 85.  Forget the /petition and /bugs<br/>
about Aqualung charges, THIS is the problem we should be complaining<br/>
about.  Tinkering should have the cap removed and made like every other<br/>
trade skill.<br/>
