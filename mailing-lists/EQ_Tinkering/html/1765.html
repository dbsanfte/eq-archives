 </span></blockquote>No attributes enhance/detract from you chance of success when making a<br/>
skill roll, they only change the chance of making a successful skill<br/>
increase roll. That was posted by Abashi on the everquest forums.<br/>
e.g. Weapon skill increases are based on (higher of int/wis) + dex. But dex<br/>
does not change your chance to hit.<br/>

I&#39;m sure if someone asked him directly on the forums which skills are<br/>
involved in trade skills he&#39;d probably answer...</div>
