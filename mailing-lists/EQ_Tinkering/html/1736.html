<div id="ygrps-yiv-816787532">First of all What is the level of this guy? Is he 50th? Would be kida lame if <br/>
the info was commining from someone not capable of handling this 50 level <br/>
NPC. i Think its alot more lower NPC than he leads it on to be.  As stated by <br/>
another person i seen here on Onelist, don&#39;t ever believe it till you see it <br/>
in a trade window for yourself. I feel that .....if ......the cutter will be <br/>
actually able to be done, the Diamond Dust component wouldn&#39;t be too far from <br/>
the already condenced tinkering supply location in Steamfront.  Treat this <br/>
like it has been told to you as...(a rumor)...Nothing more. But ,1 thing is <br/>
for sure is that even if you do get the dust and make the item for it...I <br/>
wouldnt let him have it back until he gave you at least 1 dust per unit for <br/>
your trouble for you to keep.....Reguardless if it came out or <br/>
not...Especialy if he doesnt want to give you the acurate location of this <br/>
mysterious NPC...Sincerely Cloverleaf  Lukyfeet, Gnome and Tinkerer (Fennin <br/>

 OK don&#39;t get to excited but I have been asked by a fellow gnome to make<br/>
 the gemcutter. He claims he can get the diamond dust for me, but won&#39;t<br/>
 give up the npc that drops it. He claims that the npc is 50th level and <br/>
 that the diamond dust is a rare drop item off it. I am thinking that this<br/>
 could mean that the npc may be in the planes but that is merley speculation.<br/>
 I wish he would give up the info but he is keeping it hidden from all for<br/>
 another gnome. Well i hope this gives all you tinkerers hope:) Has anyone <br/>
 discovered what the formula is for the Thermal Cloak? Where can i aquire <br/>
 tattered belts? Are they merely patchwork belts or are they actually called<br/>
 Tattered belts? <br/>
