&gt;Hello all<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m new to this list and tho the art of tinkering. Could someoone point me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to an hompage where i can read more about tinkering like wich books i need<br/>
( I need books on tinkering right ?) and outher stuff. also if there has<br/>
been any good post to this list before and you have saved them i would be<br/>
glad if you could mail them to me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:zinken@...">zinken@...</a><br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I run a tinkering site that was created off all the info I and others<br/>
(including those on this list) have found and shared.  You can view it at<br/>
the URL: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqportal.com/Tinkering">http://www.eqportal.com/Tinkering</a><br/>
<br/>
For the tinkering books, one vendor at the windmills in Steamfont sells two<br/>
books - Journals of Gimblestan XIV and XV.  They will cost you a gold or<br/>
two each.<br/>
<br/>
I believe if you go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a> and search for this list it<br/>
has an archive of all the digests - all of the e-mail that was ever sent?<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
