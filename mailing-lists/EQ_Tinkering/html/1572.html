<b>Subject:</b> RE: Skill Cap <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994386930">Research is definitely capped and is easier to prove than Tinkering.  You<br/>
may continue to put practice points into it each and every level until you<br/>
hit the cap for that level.  Once you hit the cap, at the next level you<br/>
will be able to raise the skill EXACTLY 5 more points whether you do it<br/>
through actually using the skill or spending practice points.  The fact is<br/>
that every mage has known that research is level capped since it was<br/>
implemented.  It was only fairly recently (two or three months) that it was<br/>
shown that Tinkering follows the same cap formula as Research (which btw is<br/>
(level - 15) * 5 for levels 20 or greater.  For levels 16 through 18 you<br/>
can add one point, 19 adds 2 points ).  <br/>
<br/>
GZ may be very forthcoming, but on this point he is also very wrong.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Believe me I have been on the one list for a LONG time the <br/>
&gt;&gt; cap is  LEVEL  X 5 <br/>
&gt;&gt; -13<br/>

&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; If you dont beleive me tell GZ to chek the live servers himself<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was speaking to the assertion that research is capped - we all know that<br/>
&gt;tinkering has been capped since release and is soon to be fixed. <br/>
