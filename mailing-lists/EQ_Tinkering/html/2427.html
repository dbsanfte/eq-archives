<div id="ygrps-yiv-783617320">I had read somewhere that a good rule of thumb is 75% sucess when your skill<br/>
level is at the trivial point for the item your trying to make +/- 1% for<br/>
every skill level away from the trivial. That is, with a skill level 20<br/>
points past the trivial point, you&#39;d have a 95% sucess rate, and with skill<br/>
50 points below trivial, you&#39;d get about 25%.<br/>

Unfortunately, I can&#39;t remember where I saw this, so I can&#39;t direct you to<br/>
my source.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] When to try something else?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I just hit 102 skill in tinkering tonite and made some Powered Gloves<br/>
&gt; (woohoo!).  The next major item I&#39;d like to make for myself is the<br/>
&gt; Footwarming boots.  Apparently the trivial for footwarming is around the<br/>
168<br/>
&gt; mark.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At what skill level will I have like a 25% chance of even accomplishing<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; item?  Obviously I&#39;ll continue making Powered Gloves until the trivial<br/>
mark<br/>
&gt; at 122, and then trying aqualungs.  Aqualungs&#39;s trivial is 148, which<br/>
takes<br/>
&gt; me close to the ~168 trivial of Footwarming boots.  However, I&#39;d like to<br/>
try<br/>
&gt; the boots earlier on if there&#39;s a chance for success.  However, I don&#39;t<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; the formula for a chance of success being &quot;x&quot; number of skill points away<br/>
&gt; from the trivial point of the item you&#39;re trying to tinker.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Soooooo....  I&#39;m at 102 now.  What skill level can I being trying to make<br/>
&gt; Footwarming boots with somewhere around a 25% chance of success?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone have any idea?  Thanks if you do. :)<br/>
