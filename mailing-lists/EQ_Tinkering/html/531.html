Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] third tinkering book<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
while I agree that Josh is an ass I think he&#39;s right, we should stop wasting<br/>
time trying to guess the formula and work on finding the third book (which<br/>
is actually the first). even if someone does guess the fishing pole there<br/>
are still other things in the book that we don&#39;t know, like fireworks. I<br/>
know this book exists and to prove it I&#39;ll give you the one formula I was<br/>
able to get out of the person who has it. animated bait -- 1 cork, 1<br/>
spricket. the only purpose I can find for this is practice for non gnomes<br/>
since the two things cost much more than bait and it&#39;s trivial for a gnome.<br/>
personally I think the book is in Solusek&#39;s eye, the tinkering merchant has<br/>
to be there for some reason. I just hope we don&#39;t have to kill a gnome for<br/>
it.<br/>
