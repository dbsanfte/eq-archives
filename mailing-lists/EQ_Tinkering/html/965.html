<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945956286">Runny Eye.  Broxx the Evil Eye with the Observor Staff spawns here.  But<br/>
there is also a seemingly massive canal system (I heard four levels deep)<br/>
that I saw with a waterfall flowing down into it.  I dropped onto the bridge<br/>
but had to gate out when a slime elemental ran into me.  Has anyone explored<br/>
the water in this zone?  What is down there?<br/>
