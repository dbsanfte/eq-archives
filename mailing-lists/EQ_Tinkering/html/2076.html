<div id="ygrps-yiv-707124630">Selling Rebreathers for 2500p is mad. Sure you get em sold, and it is a way <br/>
of keeping &quot;afloat&quot; as those who have plat to spare want to sell em off as <br/>
fast as they can to tinker more. I am at the stage where I can do <br/>
rebreathers, but I fail a LOT still. Some ppl on my server has been selling <br/>
off rebreathers from 7-10kpp which is defenitly too much IMO. I was <br/>
auctioning them for 3.5k which I thought was too low but I thought was the <br/>
goin price, now ppl tell me to sell them for no less than 5kp, so that is <br/>
what I will charge for them, might go down to 4 or 4.5 if they buy more than <br/>
one, or return me an aqualung as a part deal.<br/>
<br/>
With a 50% failure rate, a rebreather would cost 1900p to make, at least for <br/>
me, if you succeed on both lungs, sell em for 2500 and you make a measly <br/>
600p profit. I have skill of 118 now, and it cost me nearly 28k to get there <br/>
(i know, i have been doin something wrong somewhere probably, eheh) and with <br/>
a 600p profit on each rebreather I&#39;ll never get that money back. I think 5kp <br/>
for a rebreather is a decent price...<br/>
