<div id="ygrps-yiv-289643554">That could be the case, but it&#39;s not becuase they are not making changes to <br/>
the previous changes that they made becuade they didn&#39;t work. They are just <br/>
adding new patches with new changes completely different from the last <br/>
patch.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;They arn&#39;t patching the test server because they &quot;care&quot; more about the test <br/>
&gt;server... as the name &quot;Test&quot; implies, it is a sever used for testing knew <br/>
&gt;and updated source code... Most everything that is altered and/or added <br/>
&gt;passes through the test server first... So is understandable that there <br/>
&gt;will be multiple patches on the test server. Once they get it right, they <br/>
&gt;dont need to patch more then once with the regular servers...<br/>
