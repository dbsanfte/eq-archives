<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147130232">Just to let ya know my Tinkering Skill is at 125<br/>
and neither the Aqualung or the Rebreather is Trivial at that lvl.<br/>
The fail rate has not seemed to change much either.<br/>
With a Int or 200 and Wis of 145 I still fail 40% of the time on the <br/>
aqualungs and 60 to 70 % on the rebreathers. As for the Gemcutter <br/>
would love to find the Diamond Dust.<br/>
