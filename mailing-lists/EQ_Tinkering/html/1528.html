<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622698649">The helm looks like leather. :)<br/>
  As I remember I tried 2 metal rods, firewater and a small cloak as <br/>
was on the original tinkering site. From seeing the recipe posted <br/>
there it looked as if someone had actually made one, I could be <br/>
wrong. I also tried it as listed above with a small tattered belt.<br/>
  If memory serves one thing I thought was odd was that when a <br/>
tailor makes a belt it&#39;s listed as a tattered belt, but the cloak was <br/>
listed as a patchwork cloak.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I tried it after they put in the tailoring patch for cloaks. Wrong<br/>
&gt; &gt; cloak. The tailoring cloak comes out as a patchwork and won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; combine. They could have changed something since though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Combine with what though.. The recipe is not too specific as to how many metal<br/>
&gt; rods to use, and also is bit ambigous as to wether the belt is required element,<br/>
&gt; or just a bit of flavor - I&#39;d be more inclined towards the latte,r as it doesnt<br/>
&gt; say what sort of belt it was... That&#39;s why I suggested the new failed attempt<br/>
&gt; list..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, on a completely unrelated note.. The gnomish metal gauntlets and the silk<br/>
&gt; lined steel cap that are sold at the vendor at the windmills - has anyone tried<br/>
&gt; putting them on and seeing what they looked like? I wouldn&#39;t mind buying and<br/>
&gt; wearing that cap if it looked like steel, though the icon makes me think it&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; end up as leather:)<br/>
