<div id="ygrps-yiv-109309646">Well if that quewst is designed for level 12 players they definately<br/>
weren&#39;&#39;t talking about any mino locations except for the ones in Steamfont.<br/>
 But if you want to check other places here you go.<br/>
Locations I have seen minos:<br/>
Steamfont (in the mino mines)<br/>
Gorge of king Xorbb (Beholder Maze)<br/>
Najena (back with the goblen magicians and that huge spider)<br/>
Herd there were some in Lower Guk, but I don&#39;t think I am quite ready to go<br/>
exploring there.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck finding him.  He probably spawned inside a wall and got stuck. :(<br/>
