&gt; Well I bought my tool kit and the two books from the tinkering vendor<br/>
&gt; last night.  After reading I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that there must<br/>
&gt; be more books somewhere, as these two seem to center on &quot;higher level&quot;<br/>
&gt; projects.   Tonight I hope to talk to every NPC in Ak&#39;anon for the<br/>
&gt; remainder of the books especially the ones that contain firewater and<br/>
&gt; collapsible fishing poles.  I will keep you posted on my results.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Firewater is the first thing you can make. I&#39;ll tell you this much, I<br/>
didn&#39;t find<br/>
it in the two books. But was emailing the guy (can&#39;t remember his name,<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
in my email) who works on Trade skills. He kept suggesting that it&#39;s in the<br/>
<br/>
books. He of course didn&#39;t mention which books. I talked to the NPC&#39;s<br/>
is Ak&#39;Anon, all of them I could find. Nada and more zip. I do know how<br/>
to make Firewater, but it came from my emails not the game. It is possible<br/>
that there is an NPC I missed, I&#39;ve been through more then twice. I was<br/>
hoping<br/>
it was a quest, but haven&#39;t found it yet. May try Gnome&#39;s in Steamfont? Or<br/>
if you&#39;re brave the ones in Mino Cave. Or in Lesser Fay.<br/>

P.S. I can post the items that make up Firewater or just email me.</div>
