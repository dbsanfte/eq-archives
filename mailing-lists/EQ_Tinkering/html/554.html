 </span></blockquote>Okay, so tinkerers can make items that load in tough zones.  Still makes <br/>
them marginally useful because it&#39;s not often that things migrate out of <br/>
that place, at least not on Erollisi Marr, which is a somewhat new server, <br/>
being only a few months old.<br/>

What&#39;s silly is that the only trade skill that can actually make money is <br/>
jewelcraft.  Jewelcraft items are always in demand, and the guild i am in <br/>
happens to have a crafter with over 190 skill in it. Of course, he has spent <br/>
literally 1000&#39;s of plat to train it.  No other skill can seem to turn a <br/>
reasonable profit though.</div>
