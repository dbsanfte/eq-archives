&gt;<br/>
&gt;How old are you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>21<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are you male or female?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Male<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How long have you been playing Everquest?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since January of 2000. (15 Months)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is Everquest the first on-line roleplaying game you&#39;ve played?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Why did you start playing Everquest?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had on-line friends who recommended I play.  I started in order to join <br/>
them in the game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Avatar questions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What level, race, class, gender is your main avatar?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>45 Gnome Wizard Male<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you have secondary avatars?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What levels, races, classes, genders are your secondary avatars?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>12 Troll Shadowknight Male<br/>
8 Gnome Rogue Male<br/>
7 Iksar Necromancer Male<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Why did you choose the classes you did for your avatars?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I chose Wizard because of what I read on fansites before I joined.  I chose <br/>
Wizard to be the master of magical damage.<br/>
I chose a Rogue because I needed it&#39;s sneak skill to multi-quest for a <br/>
spell for my Wizard.  I have yet to do the multi-quest, but like the class.<br/>
I chose Necromancer just to try out the class that everyone was talking <br/>
about at the time I created it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you play on a PvP server?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are you in a guild?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;For what reasons are you in a guild (or alternatively for what<br/>
&gt;reasons are you not in a guild)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To be able to converse with people I know in the game world easily.  To be <br/>
able to find groups to play with and friends to talk with more easily.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you attend guild events?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you plan to ahead of time to attend guild events?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Occassionally.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you normally group with<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) People you meet that session<br/>
&gt;2) People you knew prior to playing Everquest<br/>
&gt;3) People you met through Everquest<br/>
&gt;4) Guildmate you found in your area<br/>
&gt;5) Other (please specify)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A combination of all.  Sometimes it&#39;s 2, sometimes it&#39;s 3, sometimes it&#39;s <br/>
4, and sometimes it&#39;s 1.  It depends where I am.  I suppose I would answer <br/>
3 as the most common, but it&#39;s close.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Have your grouping patterns changed as you&#39;ve gained experience at<br/>
&gt;the game?  How so?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  I initially grouped most often with 1 - people I meet that <br/>
session.  Then as I got more powerful and could move around I grouped with <br/>
mostly 2 - people I knew prior to everquest.  Then as I got more powerful <br/>
and met more people and entered a guild I grouped with mostly 3 - people I <br/>
met in game.  Now I group with whatever fits my mood, or nobody.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Time questions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How many hours a week (on average) do you play Everquest?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, when I started I would say about 40.  Now I would say maybe 6.  But <br/>
it fluctuates.  I will go a couple of weeks where it is closers to zero, <br/>
and other weeks where it&#39;s 6, and others where it&#39;s 20.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How many hours do you play each session?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Usually if I&#39;m logging in my primary, about 4.  But if I only plan on <br/>
having a little bit of time I will play an &#39;alt&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How do you normally spend your time in Norrath?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hunting creatures for experience, or sometimes questing, and occasionally <br/>
doing trade skills.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are you on a constant quest to level or do you take time off from<br/>
&gt;gaining experience while playing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I will take time off, like I will do a week of hardcore experience-gaining, <br/>
followed by a week of questing/trade skills, followed by a few weeks of <br/>
nearly not playing at all.  Rinse, repeat!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What do you do when you take time off from the mobs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Trade skills and class-specific quests.  My tradeskills are Tinkering, <br/>
Blacksmithing (as 2 primary ones) and Tailoring, Brewing, Baking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;While trying to level do you ever take time out to help others?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If yes (to the previous question), in what ways?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll teleport others sometimes (and sometimes for profit too).  I&#39;ll bind <br/>
newbies and give them stuff I don&#39;t really need.  I&#39;ll powerlevel newbies <br/>
for an hour here or there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Did you know the other avatars prior to helping them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Can you give any reasons why you chose to help others?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because it&#39;s fun in it&#39;s own way, and rewarding.  It&#39;s both a chance to <br/>
help someone else, and to show off your power.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Have you ever died helping others (outside of a group situation)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not that I can think of.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Calls for help<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do you ever help newbies?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If yes (to the previous question), how do you help newbies?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same as how I help people out.  Teleports, powerlevelling, train-breaking, <br/>
twinking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Can you give any reasons why you helped them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fun and showing off.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Were you helped as a newbie? (This does not include help from friends<br/>
&gt;you met prior to playing)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A little bit, yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If yes (to the previous question), how were you helped?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People saved my butt from dying a few times.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you respond to the /yell command?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, if I&#39;m not occupied.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Does your respose to a plea for help depend on any factors? What are<br/>
&gt;those factors?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If someone is polite and articulate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are you more likely to help members of a specific race? gender?<br/>
&gt;class? Why?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope.  Because people lie about who they are and what sex they are <br/>
anyhow.  I just judge people on how they act toward me.  If someone plays a <br/>
really funny male Troll I&#39;m just as likely to help him out as I am a female <br/>
woodelf character.  In fact, perhaps more likely, because the female <br/>
woodelf is more likely to be a male using the sexualization of an avatar <br/>
for profit.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Was there any time in your avatars life when you were more likely to<br/>
&gt;help others?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If yes (to the previous question), what brought about the difference<br/>
&gt;in game play?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>N/A.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Why do you think that people help others in Everquest?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because they want to show off their power and they want to be respected.<br/>
