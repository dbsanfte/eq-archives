&gt; There are quests, that involve you saying things to NPCs that aren&#39;t in<br/>
&gt; brackets.  You usually find out this information from other NPC.  But it is<br/>
&gt; quite common.  So it is possible there may be some question you have to ask<br/>
&gt; Jogl like &quot;what is a collapsable fishing pole?&quot; or some such thing and they he<br/>
&gt; will ask you to bring him a few items (like the jum jum quest) and then he will<br/>
&gt; give you the pole.  If someone is truely making the poles, then I think this is<br/>
&gt; how it is being done.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, or maybe it is like the trueshot bow quest and it is possible to<br/>
mkae the actual item...<br/>

&gt; As for faction mattering.  I know of very few quests that need a faction better<br/>
&gt; then dubious (which NPC will usually not talk to you if you are dubious, so<br/>
&gt; this suprised me.  But since I am dubious with almost all of Norrath,<br/>
&gt; indifferent to some, and my pet considers me kindly (I didn&#39;t know other NPC<br/>
&gt; could do so also).  It is pretty unlikely that your faction has to be that<br/>
&gt; high.  Especially for a quest that involves multiple classes.  For the vast<br/>
&gt; majority the quests that involve faction being high are quests designed for a<br/>
&gt; single class to complete.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Jogle doesn&#39;t say anything different to me.  One thing I did notice is, if<br/>
&gt; &gt; you say &quot;What do you do?&quot; to an important npc, they respond with a message.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I ended up going all over steamfont and ak&#39;non saying that to everyone.  :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Like Jogl says &quot;I am the master engineer for the Eldritch Collective..&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Zondo says something about him being the Chief Mechanic for the Eld<br/>
&gt; &gt; Collective... etc I didn&#39;t find out anything important tho.<br/>
