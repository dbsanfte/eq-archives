<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333657168">I think it has to do with the skill level you are at.  I suspect there may <br/>
be &#39;hell&#39; levels you have to work through.  I recently started to tinker <br/>
with my character.  I made flameless lanterns all the way to 68, then <br/>
switched to cams.  I did 8 at a time with the cams.  The first batch, I was <br/>
6 for 8.  The next batch, I was 8 for 8.  I was at skill 74 after that (75 <br/>
is trivial).  I then went 1 for 6 getting that last point.  I&#39;ve begun <br/>
making stalking probes since they are cheaper to make than the <br/>
spyglasses.  I don&#39;t have firm stats on it, but I did 50% for about 10, <br/>
then went on a 1 for 6 streak, then back to 50% again for the next 4.  I <br/>
suspect there may be some sticking points you have to work through (for <br/>
example, skill level of 73 might bring more successes than 74).   I know it <br/>
seems odd, but its either that, or I had a run of bad luck.  BTW, nothing <br/>
changed during any of the attempts, 109 wisdom, 140 intelligence.<br/>

&gt;Out of my first 2 attempts I manufactured 2.<br/>
&gt;Out of my next 8 attemps I manufactured NONE!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And here I thought I was just a stupid warrior! (106<br/>
&gt;int/80 wis or so)!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Up until aqualungs I was making a pretty dandy profit<br/>
&gt;with spyglasses and the occasional bow cam or stalking<br/>
&gt;probe made to order.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh well....<br/>
