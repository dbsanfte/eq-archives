&gt; &gt;In general I would agree with you but bear in mind this.  There are<br/>
&gt; &gt;probably<br/>
&gt; &gt;no more than a couple of dozen serious tinkerers.  Heck gnomes<br/>
&gt; &gt;themselves are<br/>
&gt; &gt;very rare.  I see very few as compared to elves or humans.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;With such a small population, it IS possible for the secret to be held.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Even more so when all the other things you get from tinkering are useful<br/>
&gt; &gt;to practically no one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do agree that the entire tinkering population is quite small, but there<br/>
&gt; are literally thousands of players out there that search for new quests and<br/>
&gt; item info every day.  In the course of these events, they will eventually<br/>
&gt; find something to do with tinkering.  No one specifically looks for new<br/>
&gt; quests in hopes of getting a specific result.  They search for them to find<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well.  I am not sure that what we want is at the end of a quest.  It<br/>
just may <br/>
be yet another book in some smithy shop that no one ever bothers to<br/>
check out<br/>
because we&#39;ve seen those same books many times.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; something new in hopes of profitting from it in some way.  These people<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t say &quot;let&#39;s find tinkering stuff today&quot;.  They say &quot;let&#39;s find<br/>
&gt; something new tody&quot;.  So, I do not agree with your statement that only a<br/>
&gt; tiny fraction of the world actively searches for things.  People stumble<br/>
&gt; upon stuff, its just unfortunate that none of it has been about tinkering.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spyglass = useful?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Apparently wizards have a spell that does the same thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wizards have a whole line of such spells, but others don&#39;t, so I believe<br/>
&gt; that the spyglass is, at least, marginally useful.  The reasons are:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  No merchant or mob drop supplies similar items.<br/>
&gt; 2.  Most people can&#39;t perform similar feats using their class     abilities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Spyglasses are apparently drops in solusek.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;As an aside, I heard from a post either here or on a WWW site that one<br/>
&gt; &gt;of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;files contains the text aqua-lung.  Could this be another tinkering<br/>
&gt; &gt;item?<br/>
&gt; &gt;It certainly sounds so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It could be anything, or something not implemented, etc.  There really isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; any reason to believe it is one thing or another.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably not implemented i agree.  But it doesn&#39;t sound like anything<br/>
other<br/>
than a potential item to be tinkered.<br/>
