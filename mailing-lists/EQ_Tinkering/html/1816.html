<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924788461">i was bored tonight and decided to check out this mesterious lamp, i cliked <br/>
it and was lookin around, and decided to ask guide 1. i asked her &quot;where <br/>
does this light lead&quot; and she said to go check in with the receptionist, i <br/>
asked him the same and he mentioned king akannon. well i went to our good <br/>
king and asked the same question but go the same response from him as i got <br/>
from everyone else, the schpeal about the founding of teh city. well it <br/>
sounded like the creek from the lamp came from this area, but i couldnt find <br/>
anything. alos im only indiferent to the king so, mabey faction affects it. <br/>
well this is just my bit of help. hopefully this lil bit of info will lead <br/>
somewhere.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was readin a post, I discounted it as major B.S. but checked it out<br/>
&gt;regardless since I was in Ak&#39;anon. It mentioned somethin bout a clockwork<br/>
&gt;dragon, now the dragon, I don&#39;t believe, not by a longhshot. But it also<br/>
&gt;mentioned one of those lamp, star light post things, and when ya click it, <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;makes a door opening sound and turns 90 degrees. I thought that it was <br/>
&gt;worth<br/>
&gt;2 seconds investigation, so I found the one that wasn&#39;t soinning next to <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;lake. I clicked it, and sure enough, it turned bout 90 degrees, and I heard<br/>
&gt;the door creak. I have no idea what this is about, knowing my luck, this<br/>
&gt;little topic has popped up on the list before, but I&#39;m a recent addition to<br/>
&gt;it. If it has, GOOD! someone please fill me in and quench my curiosity. If <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;hasn&#39;t, anyone have any ideas what it is, cause who knows, what if it has<br/>
&gt;valid importance, this is a long shot, but it may have somethin to with<br/>
&gt;diamond dust. I know I know, there&#39;s a bunch of you thinking I&#39;m prime full<br/>
&gt;of it, but about the little door creak and star lamp thing, I&#39;m not, I <br/>
&gt;invite<br/>
&gt;you to see it yourself. Anyways, I jus thought I&#39;d toss that one out there.<br/>
&gt;If it&#39;s been brought up before, forgive me for my insolence.<br/>
