<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055659062">Whats wrong with this skill is that i tried to make collapsible fishing poles and i failed more times then i made one about 6 out of 10. WTF is that the damn pole is trivial and still i fail so much in making them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have the same problem ?<br/>

&gt; Hello Folks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fizz here, been a while.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been making spyglasses, failing about one out of every 3, but am able to make a profit selling them for 60 plat or so. There are enough folks on my server that are 40+ that consider 60 plat chump change. My rule of thumb is I charge twice the component cost (or however much I can get for them...heh)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got my first point since Cams became trivial at 75... I&#39;m at 76 now. Its haaaard gaining points tho. I have made 10 spyglasses without a point gain, but if I can make a bit of profit at it, I can support the habit without going broke.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To make a profit, ya gotta have some stuff that gets your charisma up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
