<b>Subject:</b> Fishing Pole - Wasting time with combinations... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985975031">Wasting time?  I don&#39;t think so.  Plus I&#39;m at work and its nice to do something different for a change (aside from cruising the chat boards looking for that recipe. *grin*).  You are also correct in that some combinations just won&#39;t work - ie 8 fishing poles, 1 fishing pole, etc, etc, etc...  But, we&#39;re going the methodical route.  The list I&#39;m currently creating lists EVERY possible combination with the 13 items we know of or guess will be used.  Now, I do recall someone saying that the CFPole could be made when the tool box was only<br/>
4 slots.  Does anyone know if this is true for sure?  If so, that makes life TONS easier.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Guys, you aren&#39;t really being realistic here. You say that there is a<br/>
&gt; certain amout of items that we can use to make it, what are you saying?<br/>
&gt; Thats it&#39;s 13? Let&#39;s just say we decided that only 4 slots are used to make<br/>
&gt; it, even then, you can&#39;t make any acurate calculation of the amount of<br/>
&gt; combinations there are, I mean, I dout we will be using grease, sprockets,<br/>
&gt; gnomish bolts, and gears to be making the fishing pole. We probably have to<br/>
&gt; have some kind of rod or shaft too, and with your calulations, you are<br/>
&gt; inluding various of those useless combinations, that we can probably guess<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t make the pole. You are just going to have to face the fact that we<br/>
&gt; just have to keep trying, or find some alternate way of learning the recipe,<br/>
&gt; so no amount of calculations are going to help us much unless you aply them<br/>
&gt; in a practical way, so you should stop wasting your time. That is all I have<br/>
&gt; to say for now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Fizz, I think you might be onto something here.  It seems I might need to head home (Ak&#39;Anon) to try some stuff out.  Although I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get far on 100pp.  Hmm, flowing black robe or the recipe for a CFPole?  ...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m outta cash, and this is an expensive &#39;series&#39; that I hate to assign to one of the brave souls that has been blowing cash coming and going trying to figure out the right recipe for the collapsable fishing pole.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its the &quot;2 metal Rods and a gear&quot; Theory. Give me a buzz at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:fizzban@...">fizzban@...</a> if you are brave enough to give it a try and I will make sure it gets posted to the &#39;Collapsable Fishing Pole Database&#39;. Please note that I have already tried a few of the combinations myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You might also let folks here know if you are going to give it a shot so someone else doesnt try that same thing. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fizz..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. please include the following list in any email that you send me so that I can keep track of who does what =)<br/>
