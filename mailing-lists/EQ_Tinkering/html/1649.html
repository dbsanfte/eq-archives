<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783480442"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; have had success selling and for how much.  I will<br/>
&gt; also tell you that it is near impossible to sell<br/>
&gt; Standard Bow Cams.  The fletching trade is pretty<br/>
&gt; much used up and not in demand, thus making our<br/>
&gt; Standard Bow Cams not in demand.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can tell you that I make most of my money selling<br/>
standard bow cams.  I&#39;ve gotten a few regular<br/>
customers, and at least once a week I get an order for<br/>
some.  Sometimes it&#39;s 4, sometimes it&#39;s 8, but it&#39;s<br/>
consistent.  I sell them for 20 each, and it costs me<br/>
about 12 to make them.  You may call this &quot;gouging&quot;<br/>
but I&#39;m still saving them 13 plat per cam (lowest I&#39;ve<br/>
ever seen cams in stores was 33 plat).<br/>
<br/>
Aqualungs...  they just piss me off.  I made 10 in 24<br/>
attempts last night, and spent 5k plat.  Raised up 5<br/>
points with an INT of 168.  That&#39;s just sad, 1000 plat<br/>
per skill point raise and under 50% success rate,<br/>
those numbers are worse than platinum jewel crafting. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All 10 of them were bugged (if you trade them, they<br/>
drop to 1 charge).  So I have to get the GM to come<br/>
fix them everytime I sell them.  I think she&#39;ll be<br/>
bugging the crap out of the development team since she<br/>
knows how much I tinker a lot and she&#39;ll get tired of<br/>
hearing from me =)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck my fellow gnomes, and I hope we&#39;re all<br/>
praying for diamond dust for Christmas!<br/>
