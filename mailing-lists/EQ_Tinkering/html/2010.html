<b>Subject:</b> New Idea for tinkering <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-371998231">After reading about all the usefull potions that can be made through<br/>
Alchemy (SoW, IvU, Shrink, stat buffs - even rumored tele potions to Halas<br/>
and Ino Swamp!!) I couldn&#39;t believe Verant could consider tinkering to be<br/>
viable trade skill.  The majority of tinkered goods are novelty items at<br/>
best with less then a handfull of items that we can actually sell or that<br/>
people would want.<br/>
<br/>
However, I thought of a new tinkered item the other day that would be<br/>
unique and I imagine it would be in very high demand.  I have no idea is<br/>
this has been suggested before but I&#39;d love to see it in action.<br/>
<br/>
A tinkered portable coin-changer!<br/>
<br/>
How many times have you been forced to break away from your party due to<br/>
the loads of coins you&#39;ve collected - thereby endagering the safety of<br/>
your group?  How many times have you seen players ask others to buy their<br/>
massive amounts of change in areas where banks are miles and miles away -<br/>
especially in areas where you&#39;re not welcome in nearby cities?<br/>
<br/>
If Verant believes this item is too powerful, should be difficult to make<br/>
or should have some balancing issues then I suggest the following (however<br/>
not all these should be used):<br/>
<br/>
- One of the ingredients could be the Shamen spell Spirit Pouch since we<br/>
know how Verant likes us to travel the world for quest items (this spell<br/>
enables the coin changer to hold huge amounts of coins without additional<br/>
weight)<br/>
<br/>
- The coin-changer could have the characteristics of a no-slot bag thereby<br/>
sacrificing an inventory spot and &quot;balancing&quot; the usefulness of the bag. <br/>
(Not a big fan of this option but Verant can be hard to convince that some<br/>
usefull items don&#39;t always need a drawback heh)<br/>
<br/>
- The coin-changer could be limited is it&#39;s use by having to &quot;preload&quot; it<br/>
with PP.  For example - you head to the bank and deposit 500pp max into<br/>
your coin-changer and you could exchange up to that limit before removing<br/>
the change and &quot;re-loading&quot; it at a bank.  This might be too difficult to<br/>
program however.<br/>
<br/>
- The coin-changer could have charges associated with it so that you could<br/>
only use it 10 times - assuming this item is cheap to make or 50 times if<br/>
it&#39;s a more expensive item - before the user has to purchase another. This<br/>
option has a benifit to tinkers as it means we&#39;d sell more of them. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The coin-changer should have a maximum weight of 5 (or less) attached to<br/>
it no matter how many coins it&#39;s holding.  You could use this item has a<br/>
money-maker and charge a commision for changing coins (most requests I&#39;ve<br/>
seen allows for this anyways as I occasionally hear things like<br/>
Bigdumbogre shouts, &quot;Buying 50pp for 450gp&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions/comments?<br/>
