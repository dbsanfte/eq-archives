<b>Subject:</b> tinkered pets <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014368278">Just a word of warning, I wouldn&#39;t get your hopes up too high for tinkered<br/>
pets.  I&#39;m fairly sure that Verant made an official statement that there<br/>
would never be such things.  I also know (playing since beta 2) that there<br/>
have never been publicly available tinkered pets in the game.  Given their<br/>
concerns about balance, I find it highly unlikely that they would include<br/>
tinkered pets.  Think of how much more powerful a gnome wizard with tinkered<br/>
pet would be compared to a wizard of any other race.</div>
