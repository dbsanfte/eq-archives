<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234940955">Has anyone had success combining tinkered cams to create a cammed bow?  The <br/>
&quot;Apprentice Guide&quot; told me to try and let me know if they didn&#39;t <br/>
work.  Well, I&#39;m not Level 16 yet and don&#39;t want to try to make the cams <br/>
until I can get experience from it and know that they would combine.  Geez, <br/>
these gears are expensive, anyone know if they can be forged or something!</div>
