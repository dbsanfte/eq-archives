<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061615096">Gnomestock was fun, but I have to apologize for not being online early<br/>
enough to make some fireworks and fishing poles for everyone, as I was<br/>
delayed at work, and then when I got home, my cable company decided it was<br/>
time for them to start fiddeling about in the cable box, this caused my<br/>
cable modem to go dead.  But I still managed to get online about 7:05.  =)<br/>
<br/>
For advertising gnomestock, I sent emails to EQvault, EQstratics,<br/>
Crossroads of Norrath, the Official Everquest site, Gnomads tinkering<br/>
realm, the Casters Realm, Graffes Wizard realm and I think EQhaven.  The<br/>
email was sent out 4 days before the event, which was a sunday, Luke posted<br/>
the news on Wed, the day of the event.<br/>
<br/>
Luke you slacker.  hee hee  =)  Everyone was asking about you...<br/>
<br/>
Of those, only EQvault and Crossroads of Norrath posted the email, to be<br/>
honest, I was a bit disappointed in the other sites for not helping us out.<br/>
 =(<br/>
<br/>
At anyrate, I think Gnomestock was a success, there were gnomes everywhere,<br/>
in fact, I think it was the most crouded Ak&#39;anon had been in a long long time.<br/>
