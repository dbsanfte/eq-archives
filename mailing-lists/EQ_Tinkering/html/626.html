<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085366772"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Down in the caves is the necroguild.  They don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; talk even if you like<br/>
&gt; them.  They are guildmasters and there are 3 there. <br/>
&gt; If you tried to<br/>
&gt; kill him you would prolly get hit for around 1000<br/>
&gt; damage in one round.<br/>
&gt; Deeper in the caves there are other NPCs that you<br/>
&gt; could possibly talk<br/>
&gt; to. They all have killed me in the past, since I am<br/>
&gt; a necro and they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t seem to like us very much.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&gt; The only people in the &#39;basement&#39; are the<br/>
&gt; guildmasters for gnomes who<br/>
&gt; worship Bertox.  Good place for low levels to kill<br/>
&gt; clockworks for<br/>
&gt; faction stuffs tho.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We aren�t talking about the gnome spelunker in Unrest<br/>
here, are we? Didn�t know there was a spelunker in<br/>
Ak�Anon. If there is, and he is associated with<br/>
necromancers, I really can�t see the logic, if Verrant<br/>
do know what a spelunker is, that is.<br/>
