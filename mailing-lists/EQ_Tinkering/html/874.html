<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170587817">I never usually post but I thought this must be mentioned. If you go to the <br/>
cazic-thule corner (www.cazic-thule.com) and look under raffle news you will <br/>
see some of the items up for raffle on Nov 2nd. Scroll down a bit and you <br/>
will see gnomish fireworks (4) a spyglass, a collapsible fishing pole, and <br/>
some other tinkered things. Obviously someone on my server knows how to <br/>
tinker these items. I do not suggest you give up trying to hunt him out. <br/>
Because I doubt he would tell you. What this means that if these were not <br/>
given by GM&#39;s then tinkering is not broken and eventually we will be able to <br/>
tinker these things as soon as we find a logical recipe. Good luck.</div>
