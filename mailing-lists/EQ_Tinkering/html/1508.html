<div id="ygrps-yiv-216020569">If somebody dies in a tough area then it should be tough to get the corpse<br/>
out.  Giving it to clerics wouldn&#39;t really effect that anyway, as it&#39;s easy<br/>
enough to get somebody to invis the cleric or the corpse owner to /corpse it<br/>
out.  Also, no matter if clerics did have invis, to actually res you&#39;d<br/>
become visible as soon as you started casting.<br/>

What about Clerics?  Shouldnt they be allowed regular invis.  Especially<br/>
when<br/>
they have to see corpse in order to res?</div>
