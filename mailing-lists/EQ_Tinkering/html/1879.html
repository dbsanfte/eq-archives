<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130221574">OK first of all I think that tattred gnomish cloak can be MADE from err<br/>
tailoring skill, and I saw a few posts that you can aquire the scteches<br/>
somewhere in Kelethin ( Wood Elf City, ahh those sexy women of theirs :))<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
second this would be a very prized item to have , for dragon raids I would<br/>
suspec it would be somthing like 20 sv cold 20 sv fire. and the high lvl<br/>
people would be glad to buy it! So it is also away to make contacts for<br/>
dragon / and even plane raids.<br/>
<br/>
anyways . as a necro I can not buy in klethin so I can;t find out where the<br/>
sketches are. but if somoene can go ahead and try it:)</div>
