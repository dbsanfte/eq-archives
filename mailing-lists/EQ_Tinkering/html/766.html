<br/>
&lt;&lt; I�ve posted this on the info page about Kelethin on<br/>
 Everlore already, but it�s probably a good idea to<br/>
 post it here too. <br/>
 One day as I was omw to the rogue guild in Kelethin I<br/>
 went in to one of the shops on the way to sell. In<br/>
 there was a huge gnome, the size of a woodelf, which<br/>
 I�ve never seen or heard about before. His name was<br/>
 some typical gnome name, with a four letter first<br/>
 name, and Fiddlebiddle or something as his surname.<br/>
 When I hailed him he said something like: &quot;Don�t you<br/>
 find the girls in Kelethin sweet as their wine?&quot; I<br/>
 tried to ask him different things, but he didn�t<br/>
 react. I also tried to give him elven wine, but he<br/>
 only said &quot;thank you&quot;. I can�t remember what he<br/>
 conned, but I wouldn�t have killed him anyway,<br/>
 probably bad faction. <br/>
 Does anyone have any experience or information about<br/>
 this guy? Could he be tinkering related? This happened<br/>
 after the last patch.<br/>
 <br/>
 Also, concerning the gnome spelunker in Unrest: You<br/>
 say he KOS everyone, but has any necro tried to go<br/>
 near him? If there are any high level necro�s on this<br/>
 list, would they be interested in trying to get in<br/>
 touch with him?<br/>
 <br/>
 Also, about gathering tinkering info: Wouldn�t it be a<br/>
 good idea to gather all info we found about all the<br/>
 NPC gnomes in Norrath on a web-page? What all gnome<br/>
 merchants sold, what quests they are related too and<br/>
 so on? What factions do you get if you kill them, who<br/>
 do they KOS and not? <br/>
 Anyone interested in doing this?<br/>

I have a level 27 necro and I tried to go in there and I hailed him from <br/>
under the water.   He didn&#39;t attack me and he was indifferent but with in <br/>
seconds about 2 monks a barb and a drybone all jumped me and chased me out of <br/>
the river.   He is surronded by nasty things.</div>
