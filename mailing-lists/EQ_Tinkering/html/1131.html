<b>Subject:</b> New Tinkerable item, scuba gear ? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339086373">Hello folks,<br/>
<br/>
Well, it looks like Verant actually threw us a bone this time, with the new patch, apparently there is a new tinkerable item that we have. I have heard that it is some kind of water breathing item.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a new component at the windmills in Steamfont, a &#39;hinge&#39; or something I forget what it was called.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the recipe is a mystery at the moment, (Lets all say it together... &quot;Verant Bastards!&quot; ) I talked to all the  npc&#39;s in steamfont and no new quests, the water breathing thing is NOT mentioned in any of the tinkering books that we have a present.<br/>
<br/>
So, just as we figure out the fishing pole mystery, we have a new one in trying to find out the recipe of the &#39;scuba gear&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t have too much time to do much searching tonight, but keep your ears open for rumors about another book with more recipes or the recipe for the &#39;scuba gear&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
