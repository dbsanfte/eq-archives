<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Then secondly I think all the gnomes from this one-list, and those who post<br/>
&gt;on eq.stratics.com and anyone else who was ever interested in this mystery<br/>
&gt;should pick a server, and get together in Akanon and have a good ole<br/>
&gt;fashion drunken fishing festival!<br/>

&gt;Complete with high diving at the great wheel, and lots of just general<br/>
&gt;&quot;Gnoming about&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>WHOO HOO!!! I suggest Bertoxx, it seems that everyone is on Bertoxx =)<br/>
I say we clear out the mines of malfunction while we&#39;re at it too.<br/>
That&#39;s an incredibly good idea you have there! Maybe we can have the Gnome <br/>
Force guild invite you all in just for the heck of it too =)<br/>
Yeah! And we can have female barbarians dancing in cages!<br/>
