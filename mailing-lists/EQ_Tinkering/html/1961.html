<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597182916">after 100 fishes and a whole afternoons of tinkering<br/>
(and loads of cash), finally made it to 140 skill.<br/>
feel pretty good now as i&#39;m approaching that all important<br/>
148 skill mark... (i wonder how much more money i <br/>
need... sigh).<br/>
<br/>
couple question though, for those who are making and <br/>
selling rebreathers.  1)it is a &quot;medium plate helm&quot; that<br/>
is needed for rebreather, right? (i have the book but just<br/>
want to make sure) 2)how much are you guys selling rebreather<br/>
for?<br/>
<br/>
thx for all the helps in advance.<br/>
