<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924504721">Well, I definately hope that Virant does SOMETHING with the<br/>
Tinkering, because as of 6PM Jun 20th there are roughly 50,000 people<br/>
playing Everquest. Now, this is a low figure, as the TEST server is<br/>
down and its not a weekend, where most servers average more than 2000<br/>
people at a time, and not 1600 as it is right now.<br/>
<br/>
This means Verant is Making the profit from the actual SALES of<br/>
Everquest AND at least FIVE-HUNDRED-THOUSAND dollars a month on top<br/>
of that.<br/>
<br/>
Figures taken from:<br/>
.. 50,000 people<br/>
..x $ 100 a year (assuming they pay PER six months and not per month)<br/>
.....รท 12 months<br/>
---------<br/>
$ 500,000 PER MONTH<br/>
<br/>
My point being this. If they are making so much damn money a month,<br/>
they can get off thier collective butts and do something about<br/>
Tinkering. I know it has been said that it will be coming after the<br/>
Poison Patch, but DAMN.<br/>
<br/>
Ya Know?<br/>
<br/>
Im talking Clockwork Pets Here.<br/>
<br/>
If the all the components of a corpse can be collected, then there<br/>
should be corresponding brainboxes to them, and we should be able to<br/>
create them.<br/>
<br/>
If people cry out &quot;UNBALANCING!&quot; then we should remind them that it<br/>
takes THOUSANDS of plat to Level our skills, and that the components<br/>
to the brainboxes for these things should be difficult to quest by<br/>
corresponding to the Creature being Clockworked.<br/>
<br/>
(SC) Small Creatures     : Brainboxes can be bought or made for 5-20pp<br/>
(LC) Large Creatures     : 25-55pp<br/>
(SH) Small Humanoid      : 60-125pp<br/>
(LH) Large Humanoid      : 130-250pp<br/>
(VLH) VERY Large Humanoid : 255-500pp<br/>
(VLC) VERY Large Creature : 1000-5000pp<br/>
<br/>
The large gap between VLH&#39;s and VLC&#39;s is because Ogres and Trolls<br/>
wouldnt do NEAR as much damage as Krackens and Dragons.<br/>
<br/>
This should keep the VLH/VLC Clockworks from being a dime a dozen.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the actual costs and quest difficulties can be hashed over<br/>
for balance, but this shouldnt cause any unbalancing issues if done<br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
Verant is being PAID to do it right, and keep us PAYING people happy.<br/>
<br/>
To make things more balanced, Tinkering could be made a Race-Specific<br/>
Specialty-Class. This would work by keeping Tinkering a Gnome trait<br/>
available to ALL GNOMES, but those Gnomes that choose to become a<br/>
MASTER-TINKERER would have to coose to do so as a CLASS just like a<br/>
Magic-User has to choose what type of caster he wants to be, a Gnome<br/>
would have to choose between being a normal class of Gnome, or a<br/>
MASTER-TINKERER.<br/>
<br/>
Gnomes that do this would be able to create the more elaborate<br/>
Tinkers such as the VLC&#39;s and VLH&#39;s and the more sought-after pieces<br/>
of equipment.<br/>
<br/>
If you are asking about the balance of having characters with Pet<br/>
Clockwork Dragons or Krackens&#39;, then remember. These MASTER-TINKERERS<br/>
have to spend hundreds of plat just to earn the SKILL to create these<br/>
creatures, and then spend the time to collect the pieces of these<br/>
creatures (How many dragons do you think it would take to kill, just<br/>
to collect every single dragon piece? Thats a LOT of WORK), and then<br/>
the pure plat and time to collect the pieces to thier brainbox!<br/>
<br/>
What if it fails? We are talking possibly 3-4 WEEKS Real time in lost<br/>
Plat and Time, all in a blink of an eye.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, there would be lots of Clockwork rats and spiders, but who<br/>
cares? My Enchanter&#39;s First-level apparition can demolish those! Its<br/>
not like they would be the most sturdy of Clockworks...<br/>

Please offer your opinion.<br/>

Thank-you for your time.</div>
