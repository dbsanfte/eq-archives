<b>Subject:</b> Firewater <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409231930">I emailed the guy doing the coding for skills<br/>
and he replayed that the first thing you learn<br/>
as a Tinker is making Firewater. That&#39;s like<br/>
skewers for smiths. He also said it&#39;s in the<br/>
game. Ok, is it me or have I seen NOTHING <br/>
that tells me how to make Firewater? <br/>
<br/>
But I can&#39;t test what I think it might be, so<br/>
I&#39;m posting my idea out there and maybe someone<br/>
can try it and post the results, I&#39;m going to <br/>
a wedding, so I can&#39;t try it myself(yet).<br/>
<br/>
My idea is combine a Flask of Water (Real not<br/>
summoned) with Firebeetle Eye. The eye seems to<br/>
be used in a lot of things, it&#39;s a light source<br/>
and it&#39;s another spell, so try those two in <br/>
the tool box, maybe (hope of hopes) my 2am<br/>
revelation is right. <br/>

<br/>
p.s. Anyone make anything at all?<br/>
I&#39;m going to try compasses (I found someone<br/>
that specializes in Pie Tins, who would have<br/>
thought) and they are all that expensive, I&#39;m<br/>
paying him 6gp/tin. Think I&#39;ll buy 10-20, and <br/>
start making compasses.</div>
