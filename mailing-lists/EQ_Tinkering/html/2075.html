<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Have a thought <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-285715588">I had an interesting conversation with a tinkerer on Bristlebane.  He <br/>
&#39;claims&#39; to be a level 50 character with a skill of 102 in tinkering.  He <br/>
has attempted 100 aqualungs, succeeding on 75 to 80 of them with a wisdom <br/>
of 80.  Also, he claims to have an intelligence of 200 and has not seen his <br/>
skill increase yet.  I, on the other hand, am a level 16 with a wisdom of <br/>
153 and an intelligence of 156.  I succeed, on average, 12 of 19 attempts <br/>
and have gained skill up to 106.<br/>
<br/>
Does this sound like the guy is pulling my leg?  Wisdom of 80 and <br/>
succeeding 75% versus wisdom of 153 and succeeding 60%?  And not raising <br/>
skill on 100 attempts with INT of 200 versus raising skill 4 points with <br/>
INT of 156.  What you think?<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I raised skill last night making lungs, so the skill cap isn&#39;t present <br/>
for myself at level 16.<br/>
<br/>
Also.  I sell for 500pp in order to stay afloat.  Its a hard sell, but I <br/>
have my methods ;)</div>
