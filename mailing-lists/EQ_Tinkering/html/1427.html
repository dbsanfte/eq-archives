<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264847611">I could not agree more with this arguement.  I have gotten many questions<br/>
from higher levels eluding to just this, and as soon as I tell them it&#39;s<br/>
capped, they just abandon the character.<br/>

If there were no tinkering cap.. every character with a few thousand plat<br/>
lying around (40th plus folks in general), regardless<br/>
of race, class, etc. can roll up a 1st level gnome (or if we leave limit<br/>
at 16th level, then power level a small gnome necro to 16) and get them<br/>
maxed on tinkering in a few days. This would crush our market. If you<br/>
had a 50th hi-elf enchanter, there&#39;s no way you&#39;d feel like starting a new<br/>
gnome mage and take him to 40th JUST to tinker (it may have a factor in<br/>
their<br/>
choice if they&#39;re choosing a new character anyway).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 35th level, been tinkering since 29th. This is my first character and<br/>
I dont have lots of cash (mostly thanks to tinkering). If the cap is removed<br/>
I&#39;m confident the market will crash worse than it already is.<br/>
<br/>
Jewelry works this way too.. any first level character can get 200 skill BUT<br/>
its a continual hassle to get enchanted gold/plat if yer not a high lev<br/>
enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
I am certainly bias, because my meager savings only lets me advance in<br/>
spurts.<br/>
If 50 master tinkerers show up on my server I&#39;m probably screwed. All my<br/>
previous time and cash (ALL that cash!) will be wasted. If they<br/>
were all 16th level, I must admit I&#39;d probably be a bit annoyed.</div>
