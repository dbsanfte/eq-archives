<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629154052">Just let you know, I received a response to my letter to Verant.  It contained<br/>
no real tinkering info, but it was not the form letter I am accustomed to<br/>
receiving (Thank you for your input, your ideas have been forwarded to the<br/>
development.....)  I sent a follow up to their reply and will let you know<br/>
what the outcome is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers</div>
