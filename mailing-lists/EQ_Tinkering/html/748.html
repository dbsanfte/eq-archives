Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] Optional locations<br/>
&gt; First I want someone to tell me what the gnome in the back of crushbone in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; pit is for?  I was there when I was in my teens, but have not returned to<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; what he did.<br/>
<br/>
The gnome in crushbone is actually part of the Tergon&#39;s Spellbook quest<br/>
which has recently been fixed since Bugglepup the gnome now spawns in<br/>
steamfont.  When you talk to Tergon in ak&#39;anon he says to retrieve a metal<br/>
pellet that he shot Bugglepup with and lost.  Well once you return it to him<br/>
he tells you to search out his brother in Freeport and give him a letter<br/>
that tells him to give you the spellbook.  So you goto freeport and learn<br/>
that he was captured by the orcs.  So you take the letter to him in<br/>
crushbone and he tells you the oracle in the castle took the book.  Kill the<br/>
oracle, return the book and tergon sends you to oot to kill a renegade gnome<br/>
thats taken up with the pirates of gunthark.  Thats as far as I&#39;ve gotten<br/>
with the quest.<br/>
<br/>
I was really hopeing it would yield tinkering info because Tergon says he<br/>
shot bugglepup with one of his contraptions.  (a tinker made shotgun of some<br/>
sort??)  :)  Anyone ever finish all of Tergon&#39;s quests to the end?<br/>
