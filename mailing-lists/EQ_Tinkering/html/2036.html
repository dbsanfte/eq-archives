<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-333576050">I recently traveled back to akanon to try and get some of the new quest<br/>
items (glow rod and bootstrutter&#39;s pack) and talked to the scrapyard guy<br/>
about blackboxes (I think I said &quot;what blackbox&quot;) and he talked about how<br/>
the blackboxes contain information which can be gotten only by useing a<br/>
Blackbox Refiner.  This is something I&#39;ve never heard of before and he<br/>
didn&#39;t respond differently to the words Blackbox Refiner or Refiner.  He<br/>
also talked about the Eldritch Collective useing them and I talked to<br/>
everyone in ak&#39;anon and the gnomes in the windmills and no one responded<br/>
differently to it.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know anything about this?  I think it was the scrapyard guy<br/>
that mentioned it, either him or Manic in the gemchopper&#39;s hall.<br/>
