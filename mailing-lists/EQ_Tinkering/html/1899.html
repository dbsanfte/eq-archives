<b>Subject:</b> Derkal, Using the gemchopper... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-806431581">Hi Derkal,<br/>
<br/>
Grats on finding the diamond dust!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to ask, did your jeweler friend combine the gemchopper in an attempt to make an item? Or did they actually use it on a gem?<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few ideas for what I think it might be used for. And remember, the chopper probably has to be used be *US* tinkers in *OUR* toolbox to be effective.<br/>
<br/>
IDEAS:<br/>
Used by Jewelers to enhance jewelry making (probably not)<br/>
Used by Jewelers to enhance or split a gem into multiple gems (disproved)<br/>
Used by *US* tinkers in a tool box on a gem to enhance or split a gem (possible)<br/>
Used by *US* to enhance some other unknown item (possible as well)<br/>
<br/>
Since the item is mentioned in the books, I dont think that it is just another component for another item, but something that is used somehow, its just up to us to figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
MY 2 cents,<br/>
