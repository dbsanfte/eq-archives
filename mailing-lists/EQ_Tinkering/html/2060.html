<div id="ygrps-yiv-647427497">Hmm...it seems odd that your level 33 friend was killing and getting exp from <br/>
it. It cons blue/green to me at _22_ and I can kill it with 2-3 shots of a <br/>
magician spell. My 2cp.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Just in case anyone was interested, I did the Gearheart quest 10 times on<br/>
 the weekend, to see if there was a hidden reward in the style of<br/>
 bullsmasher or the fabulous compactor - my friend was killing him for the<br/>
 exp, he was blue to a 32-33 and I was running backwards and fowards turning<br/>
 in his blackbox.. The rewards I got were small leather boots, small leather<br/>
 writstbands, small round shield, bronze warhammer, bronze short sword...<br/>
 That hammer had me exited for a bit when I saw it appear, thinking it<br/>
 perhaps was an upgraded bullsmasher :) But so far the reward looks a little<br/>
 light for a level 30 quest... Though at level 20 the 10 attempts got me<br/>
 about 1.5 bubbles of exp :) My factilon at the time was Kindly, but after I<br/>
 got bored I went and killed rogue clockworks for scrap to try and get the<br/>
 compactor, which got my faction up to warmly, so I might try it a few more<br/>
 times next weekend..<br/>
