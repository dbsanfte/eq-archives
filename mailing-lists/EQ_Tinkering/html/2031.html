<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Bag of the Tinkerers <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656532430">I to have only heard of the bag of the tinkerers being<br/>
sold in the Sol A gnome stronghold. It is the<br/>
&quot;replacement&quot; for the Box of Abukar. 100% weight<br/>
reduction, ALL items fit in it. It is quite possible<br/>
that some insane individual sold it back to the<br/>
merchant in Ak&#39;Anon because he needed the cash. Next<br/>
time I&#39;m back home I&#39;ll do a quick circuit of the<br/>
vendors and see if it has been added. Could you give a<br/>
hint to which section of the city the Merchant was in?<br/>
<br/>
Additionally the quest pack you are talking about is<br/>
the Bootstrutter Framed Pack - It has 10 slots, 20-25%<br/>
weight reduction, NO DROP/LORE and a weight of 2.5<br/>
stones. I just picked one up doing the Duster V/X<br/>
quest, although I have heard it given as a reward for<br/>
the Red V quest as well.<br/>

&gt; I have seen the bag two different times however it<br/>
&gt; is not there when I just<br/>
&gt; checked 5 minutes ago.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately my notes do not specify *which*<br/>
&gt; merchant in Ak&#39;Anon but I<br/>
&gt; believe it was in the main square of the city (both<br/>
&gt; times).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There was a quest given by warrior&#39;s guild where you<br/>
&gt; get a 10-slot bag that<br/>
&gt; reduces weight of carried items; having not<br/>
&gt; completed this quest I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know if this is the same bag but in any case I<br/>
&gt; thought that quest gave a NO<br/>
&gt; DROP.<br/>
