<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025890600">I talked to several guides last night on the Xegony server and they all told <br/>
me that tinkering was NOT a broken skill.  I ran this by them twice saying <br/>
that a couple of the guides had said that some parts of it were broken and <br/>
they told me that it was working fine.  Just thought I would share that info <br/>
with you guys.<br/>
