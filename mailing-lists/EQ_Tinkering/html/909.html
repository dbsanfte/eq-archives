<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004376626">The lens quest is functional and does raise your eldritch collective <br/>
faction.  I haven&#39;t tried the gearheart quest (which i believe is the <br/>
lessery fey fairy camp one you talked about).  I heard that Bugglegup does <br/>
spawn now, but I haven&#39;t seen him so it still might be a <br/>
rumor.  Supposedly, he is one of the bandits that attack the cargo <br/>
clockwork, but I&#39;ve also never seen the cargo clockwork get attacked.  I <br/>
did the observer lens quest but do not remember getting Eldritch Collective <br/>
adjustment, but I could easily be wrong about it.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if you will continue to get faction adjustments for <br/>
completing a quest if you have already completed it before.  I know that it <br/>
says your faction has been increased, but they could just increase it by <br/>
0.  Has anyone successfully raised faction by redoing quests?  If so, the <br/>
clockwork access card would be a very easy faction adjuster.  Just get a <br/>
card from Manik, give to the closest clock and get faction adjustment, just <br/>
repeat it over and over... don&#39;t even give cards to the other three clocks.<br/>

&gt;Not sure about Kizdean, but the eldritch collective seems to have a limited<br/>
&gt;set of quests to improve their faction.  I have not done the observer staff<br/>
&gt;quest, but I suspect that one will give eldritch faction.  There is also a<br/>
&gt;quest (also never done) to kill the clockwork in the middle of the lesser<br/>
&gt;fay fairy camp that I believe gives both gemchopper and eldritch faction.<br/>
&gt;The Bugglegup and the lens quests were still broken last time I checked<br/>
&gt;(about 3 months ago) so I have no idea if it is possible to use those to<br/>
&gt;improve faction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anybody have a list of all gnome NPCs in the world?  I don&#39;t recall<br/>
&gt;ever meeting a Noresa... </span></blockquote></div>
