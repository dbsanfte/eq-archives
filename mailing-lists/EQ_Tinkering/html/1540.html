<b>Subject:</b> RE: Skill Cap <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-456768463">That is a very good point, to make out. I agree that some servers may be<br/>
different. See I played on Tarew Marr up to lv 36 at that current level my<br/>
research should have been around 185 max if you followed the traditional<br/>
lv*5+5=Max for casters this is such. And there melee states are lv*3+3=max.<br/>
Anyway. My research after much help from friends and working I had a<br/>
research of 191 with the cost of many runes and the like of words. So this<br/>
with what has been said it seems that there is no cap when you train. The<br/>
same goes for Smithing, when you smith they train you to a point then tell<br/>
you I can no longer train you fine exp some where else blah blah blah..... I<br/>
am not going to post about this after this one until some more hard proof is<br/>
found about this. I am sorry if I have caused any convience to anyone. Lets<br/>
just get on with Tinkering and see how things go. Again I apologize. And<br/>
what is with the servers going down at differnet times. Some conspericy<br/>
hmmmmmm.</div>
