<b>Subject:</b> The Fishing Pole can be Tinkered! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805612552">Hey again,<br/>
<br/>
If the fishing pole were a very rare item in the game (1 out of 400 drops),<br/>
then that would make it worth more money.  But if Salvador was including<br/>
them in his spyglasses cheaply, then he had to making them (or being given<br/>
them by some unknown source).  I believe that the fishing pole is a real<br/>
tinkerable item for this reason and that Salavador (if he can be trusted)<br/>
told us the cork isn&#39;t in the formula (thus, he knows it).<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought. Could the collapsable fishing pole, just be a pole that is<br/>
collapsable?  I&#39;m not sure if I see a reel on it or not.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>
