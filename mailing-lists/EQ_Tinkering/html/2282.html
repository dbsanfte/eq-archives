in a chat that you can read @ the casters realm there is a bit about 
tinkering... here, read the tinkering bits...</font></div>

<div><strong>Yakatizma: There&#39;s a small fishing upgrade that is in the coming 
patch and we have plans for a bigger variety of fish to catch. Fletching will 
get an upgrade but it&#39;s a complicated one so it may not be before Velious. I&#39;m 
saving a lot of the Tinkering ideas for Velious as well.</strong><br></div>

<div>TGnome: Will the Gnome only race armor, which I understand has a tinkering 
component, have any procs/effects like normal tinkered 
items?<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Yakatizma: I&#39;ve been designing a couple variations of it. 
For it to be truly a gnomish marvel of mechanics it would naturally have some 
sort of purpose other than just fashion or protection<br></b></div>
<div><strong>Yakatizma: There&#39;s been some really good suggestions for gnomish 
firearms but Everquest may be just a bit to high fantasy for 
them<br></strong></div>
<div>TGnome: One common question I&#39;m getting, is there/will there ever be a use 
for the gemcutter?<br>&nbsp;<br>TGnome: Thanks 
yak!<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Yakatizma: Good question, we&#39;ll find some use for that 
contraption some day</strong></div>
