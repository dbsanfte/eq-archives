<b>Subject:</b> Re: A clue about the fishing pole? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395841840">Here&#39;s something that crossed my mind. Not sure where it may lead, but here <br/>
goes. In Freeport by the docks, there&#39;s a female NPC who has her extra <br/>
fishing pole stolen while she&#39;s there fishing. Perhaps if someone were to <br/>
give her a fishing pole?</div>
