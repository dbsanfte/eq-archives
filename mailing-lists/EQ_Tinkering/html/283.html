&gt;Hi, I an a fisher and just have to tell you that regular fishing poles fit<br/>
&gt;in backpacks already right now.  This is just my guess but maybe I was<br/>
&gt;thinking that the collapsable ones weighed less or maybe couldn&#39;t break.<br/>
&gt;They would have to have some improvement over the regular ones right now...<br/>
&gt;but being able to fit in backpacks wouldn&#39;t be it.  See ya<br/>

collapsable ones fit into small packs unlike a normal fishing pole?</div>
