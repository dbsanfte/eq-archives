<br/>
As a wizard I have never really had a problem keeping my intiligence high.<br/>
It used to be said that for tradeskills high INT would help you gain skill<br/>
and high WIS would help you succeed.  In a patch about a month ago Verant<br/>
claimed that they were changing this so that even the not so bright would<br/>
be able to succeed and gain skill relatively easier than before.<br/>
With reguards to tinkering I worked my skill up in the normal fashion<br/>
(using the old rules for stats) with Flameless lanterns till 68, Standard<br/>
Bow Camms till 75, and then Stalking Probes till they trivialed (I forge<br/>
the number).  At that point the Thermal Cloak, Powdered Gloves and<br/>
Catipults had not been able to be fashioned.  Aqualungs saw my skill up to<br/>
111 where I stoped tinkering for a while due to cost.<br/>
Eventually Powdered Gloves to 122 and then Catipults to 135? put me in<br/>
range that I could make Rebreathers about 35 - 40% of the time.  Thankfully<br/>
the Warrior Epic Quest helped sales.  At first I had to charge 2.5k for<br/>
each rebreather but have since pulled my prices down to 2k each.<br/>
<br/>
When the patch came into play that changed the way the stats affected<br/>
tradeskills I noticed that I seemed to gain alot of skill, in my next<br/>
tinkering session.  Prior to the patch I had gotten my skill to 139, and on<br/>
that first after patch session I attempted a dozen Rebreathers and saw my<br/>
skill climb to 145 (between raises from aqualungs and rebreathers).<br/>
<br/>
Str: 107, Sta: 98, Agi: 111, Dex: 99, Wis: 82, Int: 204, Cha: 54<br/>
The Low Cha is because I have some other stat items that lower my Cha, I<br/>
would remove the negative Cha items when buying.  Before every tinkering<br/>
session I would ALWAYS get a CHA buff from a Shaman or Enchanter, and if<br/>
Enchanter I would get an INT/WIS buff as well.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if my stats are aranged great or what just though I would<br/>
share some anctitdotal(sp?) evidence with my brother and sister Gnomes.  I<br/>
don&#39;t go way out of the way to tinker.  I usually keep 2 - 4 Rebreathers on<br/>
me, and I generally don&#39;t advertise except by word of mouth from my<br/>
clients.  Since there will never be a shortage of warriors wanting to work<br/>
on their epic I just plan to tinker as needed and when Rebreathers<br/>
eventually trivial, great I will give some armor a shot.  I would expect<br/>
Rebreathers to trivial some where around 170 - 180.<br/>
