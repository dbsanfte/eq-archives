<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481076622">This is a bit off topic from tinkering, but you folks seem like a<br/>
resourceful bunch.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know any online resources for investigating the pottery craft?<br/>
I&#39;m aware of the vault and stratics, but their guides are a little bit<br/>
limited.  Please respond directly to me, no need to clutter the list.<br/>
<br/>
Time to check out that thickened mana glove recipe, and I need some poison<br/>
vials.  I figure I might as well learn the entire craft while I&#39;m at it.</div>
