<div id="ygrps-yiv-359466304">Greetings:<br/>
<br/>
Hey there fellow tinkerers:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list and if somone could please inform<br/>
me as too what items we can currently make and which<br/>
ones are still broken, I&#39;d greatly appreciate it.  As<br/>
of right now I believe we can make compasses, cams<br/>
(they work now right, even though they are just the<br/>
standard ones?), flameless lanterns, stalking probes<br/>
(is this one one still way to expensive to bother with<br/>
considering it&#39;s just an Eye of Zomm spell? - I have<br/>
to say I was greatly disappointed to learn that it was<br/>
only the spell - I was hoping to have my own pet<br/>
&quot;Charlotte&quot;), firewater and mechanical lockpicks. <br/>
What skill level should you be before making cams? <br/>
They sound like the best way to make a profit. <br/>
<br/>
BTW - I&#39;m Quasinom on the Mithaniel Marr server if any<br/>
of my &quot;brothers&quot; or &quot;sisters&quot; are on this list.<br/>
