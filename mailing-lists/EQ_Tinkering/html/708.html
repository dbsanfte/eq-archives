<div id="ygrps-yiv-775988734">Why don&#39;t you shut up, you jerk? I told everyone the information, and <br/>
unfortunately I had to give it to you too, but I wasn&#39;t going to be a jerk <br/>
and not give it to everyone else just because you are a jerk.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Yup, I knew exactly what kind of message to expect from this troll,<br/>
&gt;something along the lines of: &quot;I wanted to help but you were mean to me, so<br/>
&gt;now its your fault you don&#39;t know&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What I&#39;m unsure of is how was this one-list chosen to be your trolling<br/>
&gt;grounds?  Did you figure it would be the place most likely to give you<br/>
&gt;attention because we seemed so intent on finding out new things about<br/>
&gt;tinkering?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At anyrate, until I read otherwise, you don&#39;t know jack, you don&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt;good leads, any good knowledge, any good anything.  Until I see it in black<br/>
&gt;and white, your just a troll trying to get some attention...<br/>
