<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048587801">I think tinkered pets would be just what we need to make the skill at least <br/>
tolerable and unique..... All they have to do is put the scripting ....Cant  <br/>
have more than one pet at a time when trying to do a casted pet ....Although <br/>
I wonder what good is it that we make items that can be out done by <br/>
characters conjuring or Items that sound good ,but have limits imposed on <br/>
them that make them Lame ... for Example : Fireworks milli -second burst or <br/>
short duration of stalking probes.......If verant was so concerned about <br/>
unfair advantage he sure wasn&#39;t applying them to the monsters..... Rules like <br/>
 No 2 pets don&#39;t seem to apply to monsters.. I  still must wonder how they <br/>
get away with Evil Eyes charming ya and still having a pet.....Cloverleaf <br/>
