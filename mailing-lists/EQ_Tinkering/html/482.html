<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935731845">No no no! You are actually wrong! A few people do actually collect items in <br/>
Everquest. I&#39;ve been in Everfrost lately trying to raise my faction so I can <br/>
get a quest to get a Langseax or two, and actually have a decent 1 hand <br/>
slashing weapon, well any way, I sold a Seax, which is a nice little low <br/>
level peircing weapon to someone who couldn&#39;t even use it (because it was <br/>
rogue and warrior only) for 5pp just because the person likes collecting <br/>
things.<br/>

&gt;the spyglass is, but if it isn&#39;t that good then it would not be worth that<br/>
&gt;much.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey again,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If the fishing pole were a very rare item in the game (1 out of 400 <br/>
&gt;drops),<br/>
&gt; &gt; then that would make it worth more money.  But if Salvador was including<br/>
&gt; &gt; them in his spyglasses cheaply, then he had to making them (or being <br/>
&gt;given<br/>
&gt; &gt; them by some unknown source).  I believe that the fishing pole is a real<br/>
&gt; &gt; tinkerable item for this reason and that Salavador (if he can be <br/>
&gt;trusted)<br/>
&gt; &gt; told us the cork isn&#39;t in the formula (thus, he knows it).<br/>
