&gt;Library, I saw this item. (see attachment). Mantles can also be<br/>
&gt;considered cloaks...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If thats the case perhapse the Tattered Mantle that commonly drops from<br/>
Gullerback in the Burning woods is a posibility.  Gullerback is a gorilla<br/>
that can range from 46th to 52st level.  At 51 and 52 he can summon and he<br/>
does hit quite hard.  Decent group of 50s can take him expecially if<br/>
reverse kiting is used.<br/>
<br/>
The Mantles that are droped are kinda wuss gear for the level of Gullerback<br/>
but maybe they can be used in the making of the thermal cloak.  Just<br/>
something to try.<br/>
