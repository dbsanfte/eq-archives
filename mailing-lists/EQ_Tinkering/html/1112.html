<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018577689">I heard a guy saying that other races couldn&#39;t have a base skill of 50 because even gnomes don&#39;t until lvl 16...<br/>
<br/>
Well that&#39;s not entirely true.  My lvl 1 mule gnome made a collapsiable fishing pole and it was trivial.  Does that mean he has a base of 50 or does a fishing pole take negative 1 skill to make?  Hmmm?</div>
