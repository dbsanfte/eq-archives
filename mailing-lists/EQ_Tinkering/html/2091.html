<div id="ygrps-yiv-786591115">A while back you were able to get that expansive part (i forgot the name, <br/>
gave up tinkerin a long long time ago after mastering)  of the aqualung from <br/>
critters, it was some type of shark in oot i believe. So yes it WAS possible <br/>
to max out tinkering at relative low cost since you dont need to buy what is <br/>
needed. And 400pp was too low (unless you can sell everything you make at <br/>
good price), more like a few thousand plats. Since then the aqualung parts <br/>
was removed from the sharks i believe, so i doubt it will be possible to get <br/>
to 200 at this low cost nowdays. <br/>

P.S. why the hell would ANYONE want to bother with tinkering it is a waste of <br/>
15k+ cash with no rewards, hopefully they will fix it up sometime like with <br/>
jewelry and alchemy...should wait till then...my opinion anyway</div>
