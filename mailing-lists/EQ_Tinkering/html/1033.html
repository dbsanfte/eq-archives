&gt;on eq.stratics.com and anyone else who was ever interested in this mystery<br/>
&gt;should pick a server, and get together in Akanon and have a good ole<br/>

&gt;Complete with high diving at the great wheel, and lots of just general<br/>

Force guild invite you all in just for the heck of it too =)<br/>
Yeah! And we can have female barbarians dancing in cages!<br/>
