<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405084486">well personally I think this is at least worth a<br/>
try.... maybe for a gnome enchanter. heck actually<br/>
anyone who can make a gemcutter could test this by<br/>
themselfs. toss 20 points into Jewel making, and pay<br/>
someone to make you some enchanted bars of silver<br/>
&lt;actually you don&#39;t even need to enchant the bars to<br/>
make stuff... but I would think it would be a MUCH<br/>
better idea&gt;   then toss everything in a back and see<br/>
what comes from a catseye neckless with the gemcutter<br/>
and greese... or catseye gem, silver enchanted bar,<br/>
gemcutter and greese.<br/>
