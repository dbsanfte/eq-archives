<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413715798">Well, I am a lvl 50 nec, I cleared paw maybe like 2 times already for my<br/>
spell, (I know there is a short cut to the Ishiva, but clearing paw is more<br/>
fun plus I wanted to get that 10 int book :) ) anyways I never got the<br/>
diamond dust and i would think after clearing it for a few times it might<br/>
drop.<br/>
<br/>
Now--&gt; Ideas<br/>
<br/>
- it is very very rare and is a random drop on ALL of the Gnolls, i.e like<br/>
the Paw armor , its a drop off of any gnoll.<br/>
- a rare spawn gnoll either out side or inside paw. ( if he is a lvl 25<br/>
ench he could not get very far into paw.)<br/>
- Maybe, it would make sense of a rare spawn farrie or somthing like that.<br/>
- Maybe that flying horse drops it ( i never killed it but I seen it once<br/>
at lvl 35)<br/>
- Grizzelnot (??) I would guess a lvl 25 enchancer can kill him , I did at<br/>
lvl 25, he is sometimes low lvl, and he does go thru paw, his pathing.<br/>
- maybe an aviak ?<br/>
<br/>
Also a clue if he (/ooc What is Diamond dust?) in SK, he probobly got it in<br/>
SK. so I dont think it may have been any zones that are close to SK. <br/>
( At least now we know where to look )<br/>
<br/>
Also , to get more info out of that guy even if we dont play on F-Ro maybe<br/>
we should creat a mule char and bug the sht out of that guy.<br/>
<br/>
just make a char then go /anon so he does not see your lvl. and start<br/>
bugging him.<br/>
<br/>
also maybe he will reveal the location for some good cash ?<br/>
<br/>
he is lvl 25, those guys can be bought out easly.</div>
