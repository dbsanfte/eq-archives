<div id="ygrps-yiv-477894235">There isnt much in the gnome city from what i can tell... I didnt get to really search it down to every crack and corner, but from what i saw there is only one merchant. On this one merchant I found 3 interesting things... One, i think everyone knows about+ADs- the bag of tinkerers, which is rumored to reduce the wt of anything put in it 100+ACU- and have 10 slots. I dont know if that is true though. Another thing i found was a +ACI-Large power source+ACI- and it looked kinda like a little generator. Does anyone know what this could be for? And last there was a +ACI-Broken force modular+ACI- Now if you dont know what a force modular is, then ill tell you. Its a item that usually casts some sort of dmg spell... Found on various high lvl mobs. But the strange thing was, this broken one was found in a regular sale slot... On a different topic, when tinkering first started up in beta, it was rumored we would be able to make the infamous Clockwork spiders and have them as pets. Of course this was soon put to rest by a GM who said that tinkering will consist of stat boosting items, mostly. Well so far i havent seen very many stat boosting items at all. One or two, at the most... And on another note: wouldnt it be cool if we could MAKE force modulars... with maybe like 5 charges of insert a spell here... that would be profitable+ACE-<br/>

Hehe, yeah, I finished the quest and sent the info to Allakhazaam.  Oh <br/>
well, was worth a try.<br/>
I think we need to take a look at Solusek.  There is a gnome city within.<br/>
