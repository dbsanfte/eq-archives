<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171816447"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Um, I ran into a clockwork merchant in the Magician Guild who would not <br/>
&gt;sell<br/>
&gt;to me because of my reputation...<br/>
&gt;later I was able to buy from this merchant...<br/>
&gt;so faction does seem to effect clockwerk merchants as well<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was just guessing about the faction thing, for some reason the clockworks <br/>
regard me indifferently and the gnomes regard me warmly or amiably or <br/>
something... maybe the clockworks are moneyhuggers who just like to charge <br/>
more =)<br/>
