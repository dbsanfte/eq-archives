<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045722302">Well, the summoned water stone has one (1) charge of enduring breath,<br/>
and the stone is lore, so I still think (hope) there is a market out there<br/>
for<br/>
us. I was about the only happy magician on Bristlebane last night, I think<br/>
;)<br/>

PS: How about this for luck. Made 4 aqua lung attempts last night, 3<br/>
succeeded and skill raised from 102 to 104!<br/>

&gt; Well, this kinda sucks, after spending a good 8kpp to get my skill to 104,<br/>
&gt; and after getting some sponsors to keep tinkering up so that one day I can<br/>
&gt; make good money for both me and my sponsors, they instate the magician no<br/>
&gt; cost summoned items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I DO think that there will still be a market for the rebreathers,<br/>
unlimited<br/>
&gt; i-never-have-to-worry-about-underwaterbreathing-with-this items will<br/>
always<br/>
&gt; have a market, its just the aqualung market that died.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I still have LOTS of orders for rebreathers for when i can make em,<br/>
although<br/>
&gt; a price of 2kp is, I think, the highest price tolerable to most parts of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; market. Which of course, with the failure rate to make these items, will<br/>
&gt; make me loose money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As to tinkered pets, i dont think they can be made. I heard rumors on<br/>
&gt; diamond dust beeing found in Kaladim, but I checked every merchant i could<br/>
&gt; find, no luck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, i would like to know if anyone was albe to find the coral mesh from<br/>
&gt; sharks in oot still. I mean, this guy that didnt want to share his info<br/>
&gt; would of course say they dont drop anymore to keep em for himself if he<br/>
&gt; accidentaly dropped that info..  I&#39;ll check it out myself too.<br/>
