<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842563980">Just as a little aside, Ak&#39;Anon is the only zone that Geoffrey Zatkin did.<br/>
Those that don&#39;t know GZ, he is the man behind the magic system in EQ.  He<br/>
also loves hiding stuff.  I suspect that if any city does have a secret<br/>
area, then it&#39;s Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>

Alright, here is a quick report, so you don&#39;t have to do what i did over <br/>
again, reguarding the star gadget thing. I had a partner stand by the star <br/>
and keep it turned, here is what it doesn&#39;t do: Open the chest near the fish<br/>
<br/>
goods selling clockwork. Open up anything in the deep deep pool of water in <br/>
the very back of Ak&#39;anon by the junk yard man. Open up anything in the zoo <br/>
or the rest of that building, open up anything in the two smaller towers <br/>
outside of the castle. I havn&#39;t searched the castle itself, or the mines, or<br/>
<br/>
near the gate, or anywhere else i havn&#39;t mentioned. The door sound you hear <br/>
when you turn the crystal is just the crystal itself turning, if it does in <br/>
fact open something up, its not near by, i have also eliminated that, and <br/>
also, we checked the sound out, and the farther you are away from the <br/>
crystal the feinter the sound becomes, so its not the door yourself you are <br/>
hearing. It might just not open anything at all, wouldn&#39;t be suprised, but <br/>
that would also be a waste of a hidden little level, anyway, i doubt i will <br/>
do a whole lot more searching, as its pretty boring, but i did a lot <br/>
already, try and work from there if you can, i would like to see if this <br/>
thing does anything.</div>
