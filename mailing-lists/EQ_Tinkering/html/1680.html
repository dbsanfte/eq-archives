<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836941107">I agree to a point. I have sold Fireworks for 25P a set. This was when I was<br/>
the only one who could make them on the server and the price will have to go<br/>
down A LITTLE soon. The point is I made some cash to help me tinker some<br/>
more. Only high level people want the Fireworks anyway and they dont mind<br/>
paying a little for the novelty. I say they are great for parties and<br/>
weddings. 1P  is a waste of our talent and I wouldnt take the time out to<br/>
make them for that since they are trivial and I would have to go to Ak&#39;anon<br/>
for the stuff. I have sold over 15 sets at this price and that is 6 last<br/>
week.<br/>

out!!<br/>
<br/>
So we all have a different story.....<br/>

&gt; I think alot of folks here charge way to low. I&#39;m not saying this from a<br/>
&gt; &quot;moral sense&quot;. I&#39;m saying it from a business sense.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First off, lets say you charge 2000pp for a rebreather (a price I&#39;ve<br/>
heard).<br/>
&gt; Chances are, your skill is under 110. That means 1 out of 2 failures on<br/>
&gt; aqualungs and higher on rebreathers. I certainly see no profit there.<br/>
&gt; So, if I had a hamburger stand and my competitors undercut themselves, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; laugh. Why? Because soon they&#39;d run out of money to make more hamburgers.<br/>
&gt; In EQ, it works the same way. However, customers have some ridiculous idea<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; things in EQ have &quot;real&quot; prices (like a dragoon dirk for 30pp). The Price<br/>
&gt; is WHATEVER the buyer is willing to pay! (thats my sermon, no one in EQ<br/>
&gt; listens to that :).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, if you sell for 2000pp not only are you taking a loss, but you are<br/>
&gt; killing young tinkerers. Even if 2000pp was profitable for you, you are<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; killing young tinkerers because its not profitable for them. Maybe thats<br/>
ok<br/>
&gt; with you, but you still hurt yourself, because if folks would ESTABLISH<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; the start a price of rebreathers at say 4000pp then everyone would BELIEVE<br/>
&gt; that is the price! You say &quot;no one will pay 4000!&quot; - Yes they would IF<br/>
everyone<br/>
&gt; agreed that is the established price.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shamans! Heres a tip for you. Before you make ONE potion! Run through<br/>
every<br/>
&gt; zone in norrath - and Auction your potions for 10 TIMES your cost. This<br/>
price<br/>
&gt; will be way too high and no one will buy and everyone will gasp. BUT you<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; not there to sell a thing - you are there to put a seed in peoples minds<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; potion prices. Do this 10 days in a row in popular zones. Then, when you<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; potions, sell them for 8 times your cost. By then, no one will gasp<br/>
anymore<br/>
&gt; because you established the price in their minds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thats price gouging? Please. Everytime I run near Mistmoore I check on the<br/>
&gt; caitliff. If he&#39;s there (he&#39;s not a horribly rare spawn), I kill him and<br/>
&gt; loot either Crested spaulders or the Crested helm. I got it for 5 minutes<br/>
&gt; work and sell it for 250pp or 600pp respectively - THATS price gouging.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Low prices kill the market for future tinkerers. Also Rebreather customers<br/>
&gt; are NOT repeat customers. My prices that work for me (except aqualungs,<br/>
&gt; because I&#39;m sick of explaining the details (limited charges, weight, size)<br/>
&gt; to an excited customer only to hear them say forget it.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cams - 25pp  (I sell a TON)<br/>
&gt; Telescopes - 90pp  (sell a TON)<br/>
&gt; Lockpicks - 35pp  (not many rogues, but I sell a few)<br/>
&gt; Probes - 35pp  (I sell some of these, God only knows why, just a novelty)<br/>
&gt; Rebreathers - I&#39;ll let you know cuz I just made one, will be 3-4k, your<br/>
&gt;                    input appreciated<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I give tons of fireworks away (although one guy wanted them so bad once<br/>
&gt; he paid me 5pp per!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Publish your prices. I know a few tinkerers on my server and I explained<br/>
&gt; this to them. If they cut their prices, I have to cut mine. And we both<br/>
&gt; lose. (This is illegal in the real world now isnt it, its called price<br/>
fixing).<br/>
&gt; But then again, selling less than cost to undermine competitors (just<br/>
&gt; because you have huge resources and they dont) isn&#39;t exactly &quot;nice&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People complain about this skill, but it could WORK if we made a profit<br/>
right?<br/>
