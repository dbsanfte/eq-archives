<b>Subject:</b> RE: Cost of the Aqualung & Rebreather <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565420265">I would like to know where everyone is buying their supplies since the new<br/>
items cost me more than what I am seeing.<br/>
<br/>
Aqualung<br/>
189000 copper (189pp) Fine Coral Mesh<br/>
15750 copper (15.75pp) Silk Lined Steel Helm<br/>
1050 copper (1.05pp) Metal Twine<br/>
2887 copper (2.887pp) Gnomish Bolts<br/>
787 copper (0.787pp) Metal Rod<br/>
0 copper Fresh Fish<br/>
<br/>
209474 copper (209.474pp) Total Cost<br/>
<br/>
Rebreather<br/>
209474 copper (209.474pp) Aqualung (this is assuming NO failures on the<br/>
Aqualung<br/>
157500 copper (157.5pp) Lime Coated Meshing<br/>
141750 copper (141.75pp) Sharkskin Tubing<br/>
91 copper (0.091pp) Firewater<br/>
15750 copper (15.75pp) Metal Fastening<br/>
367500 copper (367.5pp) Medium Plate Helm<br/>
<br/>
892065 copper (892.065pp) Total Cost (this is again assuming NO failures on<br/>
the Aqualung)<br/>
<br/>
Now lets start applying some failure rates to the Aqualung<br/>
<br/>
At a 10% failure rate on the Aqualung goes to 232749, and the cost of the<br/>
Rebreather goes to 915340 (915pp)<br/>
At a 20% failure rate on the Aqualung goes to 261843, and the cost of the<br/>
Rebreather goes to 944434 (944pp)<br/>
At a 30% failure rate on the Aqualung goes to 299249, and the cost of the<br/>
Rebreather goes to 981840 (981pp)<br/>
At a 40% failure rate on the Aqualung goes to 349123, and the cost of the<br/>
Rebreather goes to 1031715 (1031pp)<br/>
At a 50% failure rate on the Aqualung goes to 418948, and the cost of the<br/>
Rebreather goes to 1101539 (1101pp)<br/>
<br/>
Now let&#39;s go one step further, since the above costs are only figuring in<br/>
the failure rate of the Aqualung.  What happens when you fail the<br/>
Rebreather?<br/>
<br/>
At a 10% Failure rate on the Rebreather add 11% to the above prices for the<br/>
Rebreather<br/>
At a 20% Failure rate on the Rebreather add 25% to the above prices for the<br/>
Rebreather<br/>
At a 30% Failure rate on the Rebreather add 43% to the above prices for the<br/>
Rebreather<br/>
At a 40% Failure rate on the Rebreather add 67% to the above prices for the<br/>
Rebreather<br/>
At a 50% Failure rate on the Rebreather add 100% to the above prices for the<br/>
Rebreather<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So taking an extreme example, at a 50% failure rate on the Aqualung and a<br/>
50% failure rate on the Rebreather, we are talking a cost of 2202pp per<br/>
Rebreather (that is Cost to make it, not what it would actually sell for).<br/>
<br/>
Something to think about<br/>
<br/>
And if my prices above on the parts are wrong, please tell me where you are<br/>
getting them, since that is the price I get with a 110 charisma at the<br/>
Windmills.<br/>
