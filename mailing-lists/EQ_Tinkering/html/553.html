<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243815801">Sol A is the one with the gnomes.  It is a serverly underutilized level 20-30<br/>
dungeon.  For some reason no one really goes there.  But as the only group there<br/>
my friends and I spent level 20-27 there and leveled very quickly and relatively<br/>
safely.  There was rarely more then us 4-6 people in the zone.  Maybe 10 people<br/>
at the most.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I would be very upset if that &quot;third book&quot; resided in an area that made it<br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult, if not impossible, for tinkers below level 35 to attain.<br/>

&gt; I agree, I&#39;m in a guild with some reasonably high level members (well high<br/>
&gt; 20s low 30s) and they laughed at me when I asked them to go to solusek to<br/>
&gt; look for tinkering info for me.  :)  They said they heard that lvl 50s run<br/>
&gt; around there like newbies.  hehe  Well I&#39;m only lvl 18 so I won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; exploring that area anytime soon.<br/>

&quot;To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I struck the pedestrian.&quot;</div>
