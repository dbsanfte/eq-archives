<b>Subject:</b> Gnome clock in Qeynos <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-107746742">Has anybody bothered to do an analysis of the &quot;Clock of Ak&#39;Anon&quot; in south<br/>
qeynos?  There are some runes on the surface of it that look like some of<br/>
the runes that I&#39;ve seen in Tolkien&#39;s books.  I know Tolkien did a<br/>
comprehensive language system using runes and such, but I&#39;m not enough of a<br/>
fantasy geek to actually know any of the specifics.  Given that the clock is<br/>
supposedly gnome built, it might have a tidbit of information on it.  The<br/>
fact that it&#39;s in plain sight would make it a prime target for a designer<br/>
with a sense of humor too.</div>
