<div id="ygrps-yiv-330406366">So out of curiosity, if these recipes always existed,<br/>
I wonder why no one ever posted to the tinkering site<br/>
about them, or to this list, before now.<br/>
<br/>
The main complaint from tinkers was that it was too<br/>
expensive past skill 102, and that no one would buy<br/>
our items.  Well, people still won&#39;t buy what we make,<br/>
but with these new items, at least we can raise up<br/>
skill at a more reasonable rate.<br/>
