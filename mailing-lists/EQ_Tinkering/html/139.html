<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300051246">Murrisa Sandwhisper in Northern Ro sells compasses for about 2 plat.  The good<br/>
news is that killing Dervs hurts your faction with her, so she won&#39;t deal with<br/>
most people in the area.  (Who hangs out in Ro and doesn&#39;t kill Dervs?)  I<br/>
managed to sell a few in the Qeynos area for 4-5pp, but haven&#39;t been tinkering<br/>
much since I&#39;m about as far away from my tinkering supplies that I can get :)<br/>

&gt; I am by no means condoning price fixing, however, i would like to know at<br/>
&gt; what price are you selling compasses.  It costs a bit over 3pp to make (I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t failed yet..knock on wood).  I&#39;m currently selling for 5 pp, most<br/>
&gt; people who want one have no problem paying the 5 pp.  I have found some<br/>
&gt; people who will only pay 4pp, to whom I tell to come back to me when you<br/>
&gt; get a bit more frustrated hitting sense heading.  However, I do manage to<br/>
&gt; sell one, maybe two a day.  I here that you can buy compasses from gypsies<br/>
&gt; in North Karana but I haven&#39;t made the trip to check it out (last time I<br/>
&gt; was there i got mauled by a grif).  I also heard you could get them in<br/>
&gt; Kithicor forest but I went through all the shops and didn&#39;t find any.  I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; go to the gypsies and check them out then head to lavastorm to see if they<br/>
&gt; have them also.<br/>
