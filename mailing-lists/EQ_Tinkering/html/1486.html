&gt; From: Brad Balatgek Well, I have 5 diamonds on me...I guess that I can break<br/>
&gt; down and get one crushed... Where exactly are these ogres? And what kind of<br/>
&gt; faction do I need to talk to them? Gazamel Prime Master Tinker Solusek Ro <br/>

Anyway as was mentioned above the Ogres are quest ogres and are indifferent to<br/>
everyone.  They are in Lake of Rathe, but they are near the Rathe Mts zone<br/>
entrance.  Left hand side when comming out of the water.  Ive killed lots of<br/>
Ogres in my day and these guys are still indifferent to me, so there should be<br/>
no problem there.<br/>
<br/>
I have talked to a GM that gave me a very cryptic response when I asked about<br/>
Diamond Dust.  But everything I can tell leads me to believe that these Ogres<br/>
are the ones that can make Diamonds into Diamond Dust.  If I had one Diamond I<br/>
would try it.  Unfortunately Diamonds just don&#39;t drop that often. :(<br/>
