&gt; I can confrim this as I completed the duster quest last night and got the<br/>
&gt; Bootstrutters Pack (Isn&#39;t the Gnome who gives you the Jboots quest named<br/>
&gt; Bootstrutter?  Heh - anyone try giving him his pack back?  Just an idea).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had one of those packs for a few weeks now.  Got it for the Duster<br/>
quest.  It&#39;s a nice item, but it&#39;s NOT a weight-reducing pack.  It&#39;s just a<br/>
10-slot backpack, lore, nodrop.<br/>

&gt; Gnomish Glow Rods?  Perhaps these are the rods needed for the thermal<br/>
&gt; cloak...  I just received a patchwork cloak after completing the Red V<br/>
&gt; quest - I&#39;ll try to do the Duster and scrap metal quests a few more times<br/>
&gt; to get these Rods and try a few combinations.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also have a Gnome Glow Rod.  I got it for turning in scrap metal.  As far<br/>
as I can tell, it&#39;s just a light source.  I have had comments from people<br/>
asking me what the heck I was carrying, so they don&#39;t seem to be that<br/>
common.<br/>
