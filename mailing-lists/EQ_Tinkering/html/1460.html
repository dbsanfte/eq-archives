<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819041767">well the waterstone spell for magicians are in the game so now we all can kiss the tinkering skill goodbye! *kiss kiss*<br/>
And they have still not removed the skill cap, if I would run my company as verant does i would be out of work in no time. but how many of us want to cancel our account to make a point and lose our hard earned items and levels ? not many i would think.<br/>
<br/>
Iï¿½m werry sorry to see anather potential good game being nerfed to unplayble.<br/>
