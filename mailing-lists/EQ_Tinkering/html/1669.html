<div id="ygrps-yiv-575583513">I think alot of folks here charge way to low. I&#39;m not saying this from a<br/>
&quot;moral sense&quot;. I&#39;m saying it from a business sense.<br/>
<br/>
First off, lets say you charge 2000pp for a rebreather (a price I&#39;ve heard).<br/>
Chances are, your skill is under 110. That means 1 out of 2 failures on <br/>
aqualungs and higher on rebreathers. I certainly see no profit there.<br/>
So, if I had a hamburger stand and my competitors undercut themselves, I&#39;d<br/>
laugh. Why? Because soon they&#39;d run out of money to make more hamburgers.<br/>
In EQ, it works the same way. However, customers have some ridiculous idea that<br/>
things in EQ have &quot;real&quot; prices (like a dragoon dirk for 30pp). The Price<br/>
is WHATEVER the buyer is willing to pay! (thats my sermon, no one in EQ<br/>
listens to that :).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you sell for 2000pp not only are you taking a loss, but you are<br/>
killing young tinkerers. Even if 2000pp was profitable for you, you are still<br/>
killing young tinkerers because its not profitable for them. Maybe thats ok<br/>
with you, but you still hurt yourself, because if folks would ESTABLISH from<br/>
the start a price of rebreathers at say 4000pp then everyone would BELIEVE<br/>
that is the price! You say &quot;no one will pay 4000!&quot; - Yes they would IF everyone <br/>
agreed that is the established price.<br/>
<br/>
Shamans! Heres a tip for you. Before you make ONE potion! Run through every<br/>
zone in norrath - and Auction your potions for 10 TIMES your cost. This price<br/>
will be way too high and no one will buy and everyone will gasp. BUT you are<br/>
not there to sell a thing - you are there to put a seed in peoples minds about<br/>
potion prices. Do this 10 days in a row in popular zones. Then, when you make<br/>
potions, sell them for 8 times your cost. By then, no one will gasp anymore<br/>
because you established the price in their minds.<br/>
<br/>
Thats price gouging? Please. Everytime I run near Mistmoore I check on the <br/>
caitliff. If he&#39;s there (he&#39;s not a horribly rare spawn), I kill him and<br/>
loot either Crested spaulders or the Crested helm. I got it for 5 minutes<br/>
work and sell it for 250pp or 600pp respectively - THATS price gouging.<br/>
<br/>
Low prices kill the market for future tinkerers. Also Rebreather customers<br/>
are NOT repeat customers. My prices that work for me (except aqualungs, <br/>
because I&#39;m sick of explaining the details (limited charges, weight, size)<br/>
to an excited customer only to hear them say forget it.)<br/>
<br/>
Cams - 25pp  (I sell a TON)<br/>
Telescopes - 90pp  (sell a TON)<br/>
Lockpicks - 35pp  (not many rogues, but I sell a few)<br/>
Probes - 35pp  (I sell some of these, God only knows why, just a novelty)<br/>
Rebreathers - I&#39;ll let you know cuz I just made one, will be 3-4k, your<br/>
                   input appreciated<br/>
<br/>
I give tons of fireworks away (although one guy wanted them so bad once<br/>
he paid me 5pp per!)<br/>
<br/>
Publish your prices. I know a few tinkerers on my server and I explained <br/>
this to them. If they cut their prices, I have to cut mine. And we both<br/>
lose. (This is illegal in the real world now isnt it, its called price fixing).<br/>
But then again, selling less than cost to undermine competitors (just<br/>
because you have huge resources and they dont) isn&#39;t exactly &quot;nice&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
People complain about this skill, but it could WORK if we made a profit right?</div>
