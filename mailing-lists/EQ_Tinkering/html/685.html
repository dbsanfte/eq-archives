<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761847623">I&#39;m begining to think that tinkering is a lost art.  Look all around ak&#39;anon<br/>
and steamfont.  All the clockwork stuff looks old and rusty.  We&#39;re<br/>
surrounded by malfunctioning runaway clockworks.  There&#39;s guys standing<br/>
around called &quot;mechanics&quot; but they don&#39;t do anything but stand there and<br/>
look at it as it decays and breaks down.  There&#39;s a guy in the scrap yard<br/>
that just keeps taking load after load of scrap metal, but nothing ever gets<br/>
done with it.  Our underground lake is so polluted by the rust and decay<br/>
that it&#39;s turned green.  It&#39;s quite sad really.  Maybe thats why we can&#39;t<br/>
make anything.<br/>
