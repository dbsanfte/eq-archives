<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I made a collapsible fishing pole and 20 animated bait and set off to raise <br/>
my fishing<br/>
which has lagged behind at skill 115.  Here&#39;s what I found:<br/>
<br/>
1) I got mostly fish, but did get a rusty dagger like my 6th catch.<br/>
2) I did have casts catch nothing<br/>
3) I did lose a bait<br/>
4) I did break the pole (like 7th cast)<br/>
5) I did sell the rest of the bait and give up worrying about it. ;oP<br/>
