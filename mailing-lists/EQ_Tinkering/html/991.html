&gt;You, my enemy, are a bastard. If I ever met you in real life, I would <br/>
&gt;charge<br/>
&gt;you full speed and attack you out right, I wouldn&#39;t care if you were a <br/>
&gt;huge,<br/>
&gt;700 ton sumo, or a muscle bound Goldberg-wannabe, or if you were a weak<br/>
&gt;frail, dying old granny, or whatever. I would make a swift attampt to kick<br/>
&gt;you with (I&#39;d be wearing me wonderful cleats of course)  all my evil hatred<br/>
&gt;and rage I have sucesessfully built up my entire life. I&#39;d attempt to kick<br/>
&gt;you in the face, which, if succsessful would probably send you to the <br/>
&gt;ground<br/>
&gt;in pain, then I wouldn&#39;t stop. I&#39;d beat you around, crush your ribs, kick<br/>
&gt;you where it hurts till there wasn&#39;t even enough for the docters to scrap,<br/>
&gt;making it so wouldn&#39;t ever be able to have any more bastard offspring to<br/>
&gt;polute the world, then I&#39;d crush your face a little more, mutilating it<br/>
&gt;beyond reccognition, and do a little bit more for good measure. Why?<br/>
&gt;Because, you are a bastard. I&#39;d be one too if I did that, but frankly I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t care, because I hate you, bastard. Yes yes, hate. Hate is used so<br/>
&gt;much, but it is so often not used correctly, true hate is like true love, <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;is an extremely powerful thing, but it is also extremely rare, for it is <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;exact opposite of ture love. I truely hate you. Now you look up at what I<br/>
&gt;said I would do to you, and you ask yourself, what could cause someone to<br/>
&gt;want to do that? Well, it was your horrible, totally unnesassary words that<br/>
&gt;you said so horribly about me. Now, really think to yourself, do you feel<br/>
&gt;GOOD that you said something so bad,so HORRIBLE that you made a person<br/>
&gt;TRUELY HATE you?<br/>
&gt;I hope you don&#39;t think this is funny because it is not at all. I hope you<br/>
&gt;are sorry for doing that, you must be a truely horrid person if you could <br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;quickly make someone hate you like you have to me. And if you think it is<br/>
&gt;funny, or don&#39;t care, then you are a truely sick person too. People like <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;are so terribly sick, and don&#39;t deserve the very oxygen they breath. I wish<br/>
&gt;to never hear from you again. If I never even think about you even in my<br/>
&gt;subconcious again, it will be WAY to soon. Just get out of my life, and<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t even bother replying to this message becasue I&#39;m quittingthis letter<br/>
&gt;right now so I don&#39;t have to hear from you again. I hope you are happy <br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt;this horrible sick, disgusting thing you have done, I hope you&#39;re real<br/>
&gt;happy...<br/>
