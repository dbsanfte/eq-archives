<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-896951391">No, I don&#39;t think it sucks at all.   <br/>
<br/>
		Aqualung.  50 charges.  Not bad.  Is there anything else in<br/>
the game with this many charges?<br/>
<br/>
		Rebreather - unlimited.  Now, how much have you seen the<br/>
Fishbone earring sell for?  Eh?  Oh, NO ONE is selling them?  Oh, Trade<br/>
ONLY?  Hehehehe, well, now we can make an item that EVERYONE will want if<br/>
they want to go to Kedge Keep.  Yes yes yes, it weighs 10.  Small price to<br/>
pay instead of camping a 6 hour spawn with a rare drop.<br/>
<br/>
		Just my 2 cents.  I for one am happy tinkering finally has<br/>
some kewl stuff to make.  Now if only they would put back in the Jet Pack,<br/>
and the pet rat/spider/gnome.<br/>
<br/>
		On another note, what the heck does the gemcutter do?</div>
