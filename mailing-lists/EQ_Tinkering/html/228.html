&lt;&lt; This is news to me.  Well, I will have to keep camping it when I get back <br/>
 on the game Sunday.<br/>
 Well, can you tell me where Bidl spawns and how to get the other two lenses <br/>
 from the observatories? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have never went back there.    But from the conversations they have it it <br/>
is somewhere very close to meldrith.    When I go invisible back there he can <br/>
see me and kills me so I never go back there.</div>
