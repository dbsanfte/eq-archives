<b>Subject:</b> Animated Bait <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438699242">The journals imply that the tinkered animated bait is superior to the<br/>
store-bought stuff.  I had a bit of time on my hands, and needed some fish<br/>
to practice cooking, so I decided to put it to the test.<br/>
<br/>
I tinkered up 40 animated baits.  Then I gated back to Freeport, bought 40<br/>
baits from the store, sat on the dock, and started fishing.<br/>
<br/>
The results?  No difference.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the breakdown:<br/>
<br/>
40 STORE-BOUGHT BAIT<br/>
Casts:                   115<br/>
Fish caught:              38<br/>
Scales/sandals/daggers:   10<br/>
Beer spilled:             18<br/>
Bait lost:                 2<br/>
<br/>
40 TINKERED BAIT<br/>
Casts:                   121<br/>
Fish caught:              38<br/>
Scales/sandals/daggers:   13<br/>
Beer spilled:             13<br/>
Bait lost:                 2<br/>
<br/>
Each cast also took 11 or 12 seconds for each bait.  My fishing skill was<br/>
previously maxed at 70.<br/>
