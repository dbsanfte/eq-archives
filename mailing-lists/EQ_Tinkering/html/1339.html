<div id="ygrps-yiv-269872337">the newer formula is correct currently. they are probably gonna fix it soon<br/>
so that it matches the other trade skill with no level cap<br/>

&gt; Also, at one point at Gnomad&#39;s web site it says that your tinkering<br/>
&gt; skill cannot increase until level 16.  But then he has a chart and<br/>
&gt; equation posted that show your skill cannot break 50 until level<br/>
&gt; 26.  I have also read in other places that the skill for<br/>
&gt; tinkering is (5 * lvl) or (5 * lvl) - 5, which would mean that at<br/>
&gt; 22 my skill could be 60 or 55, breaking 50 at 16 or 16,<br/>
&gt; respectively.  Can a number of people please confirm one of these<br/>
&gt; equations?  I&#39;ve already spent quite a bit of plat on non-trivial<br/>
&gt; items and I don&#39;t believe my skill has increased.  BTW the newer<br/>
&gt; equation at Gnomad&#39;s site is (5  * (lvl - 15)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any help is much appreciated<br/>
