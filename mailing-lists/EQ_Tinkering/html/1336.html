&gt;&gt;   You are the only idiot, plain and simple. Greed has nothing to do with <br/>
&gt;&gt; running a business. The point of trading skill is for max profit. 100pp for <br/>
&gt;&gt; spyglass is the going rate, I sold many and none of them are idiots. As for <br/>
&gt;&gt; the Aqua Lung I sold about 9 so far at 650pp each, although 1000pp is a bit <br/>
&gt;&gt; at the higher end if anyone can sell them then more power to him/her. And it <br/>
&gt;&gt; is not fooling the masses, do you have any idea how much it cost to raise the <br/>
&gt;&gt; skill to master? and even then the success rate is only 50% at best. Next <br/>
&gt;&gt; time try to know what you are talking about before opening that little hole <br/>
&gt;&gt; of yours. Lastly I am proud to be a gnome, and it&#39;s people like you who is <br/>
&gt;&gt; ruining us gnomes. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The point of the trading skills is NOT max profit, but to make another<br/>
part of the game enjoyable for others.  Just like the point of the<br/>
game in general is NOT to reach lvl 50 fastest.  Its only the inborn<br/>
greed that causes 80+% of the players to play that way.<br/>
<br/>
While there is a reasonable price for the items, that allows for<br/>
continuance of working on the skills, some ppl are gona charge less,<br/>
and some more...  If your a greedy SOB, then anyone selling for less<br/>
than you are is hurting your profit, as they steal bussiness and give<br/>
you a bad rep (?desearved?).  If you undercut all the time, you hurt<br/>
yourself long term as you slowly go broke.   You hurt the others that<br/>
just want to continue to practice the skill in the short term as they<br/>
cant sell. its all a balance...  if matterals cost X and you fail 50%<br/>
of the time on average, then logical selling price is 2X, most tack on<br/>
a profit so that they dont feel its wasted time, when they coulda been<br/>
sitten on their butts waiting for mob X with cool/sellable/tradable<br/>
item Y to pop....  The question is: if somebody walks up to you and<br/>
says &quot;heres all the parts, please combine those for me. if you fail,<br/>
no worrys.&quot; would you do it?  Or would you charge them for the 30sec<br/>
it takes to hit combine.  You didn&#39;t spend any cash on the item, and<br/>
if its not a triv item, then your gaining skill (possibly) for free...<br/>
<br/>
grr, this develeped into a rant about the economy. grrr. sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I just hate to see this go the way of jewelry. where they all sat<br/>
down, and desided what they would sell at, and to ostrisize anyone<br/>
that didn&#39;t follow the norm. most of the prices where 2-3x _profit_ at<br/>
that point...</div>
