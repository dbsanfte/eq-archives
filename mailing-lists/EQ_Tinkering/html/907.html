<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963446989">Not sure about Kizdean, but the eldritch collective seems to have a limited<br/>
set of quests to improve their faction.  I have not done the observer staff<br/>
quest, but I suspect that one will give eldritch faction.  There is also a<br/>
quest (also never done) to kill the clockwork in the middle of the lesser<br/>
fay fairy camp that I believe gives both gemchopper and eldritch faction.<br/>
The Bugglegup and the lens quests were still broken last time I checked<br/>
(about 3 months ago) so I have no idea if it is possible to use those to<br/>
improve faction.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody have a list of all gnome NPCs in the world?  I don&#39;t recall<br/>
ever meeting a Noresa...<br/>

Does anyone know the relationship between Kizdean Gix and the Eldritch <br/>
Collective.  He&#39;s an inkie that spawns behind Inn 1 in West Commons.  When <br/>
you kill him, you get faction adjustment for the Eldritch Collective and he <br/>
drops Noresa&#39;s purse.  I went around the Library of Mechamagica and asked <br/>
&#39;who is Kizdean&#39;, &#39;who is Kizdean Gix&#39;, and &#39;who is Noresa&#39; and got no <br/>
responses... Anyone have any clue why killing Kizdean gives you a faction <br/>
adjustment with the Eldritch Collective... Also, what is everyones faction <br/>
with them.. I have been trying to improve it but still stuck at Amiable.<br/>
