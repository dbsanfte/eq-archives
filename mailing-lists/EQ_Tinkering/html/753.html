<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374783370">Kedge keep is not an itemized dungeon at this time. MoBs have level appropriate loot, but no unique or special items.  You can ask<br/>
any GM and they will confirm this, if they bother to answer you.  Brad has addressed this and promised it will be itemized by the<br/>
end of the month.<br/>
