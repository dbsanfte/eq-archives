<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874869517">1 - some sort of really expensive boots that enhance<br/>
running speed (like jboots), when I say really<br/>
expensive, I mean 500pp-1000pp.  They should not be<br/>
easy to make, and the ultimate accolade.  Possibly<br/>
even have a version that uses an expensive item (like<br/>
a 1pp stone or power supply) that gives temporary<br/>
speed of cheetah (2000pp+)<br/>
<br/>
2 - cams, twine, and metals for flethchers to make<br/>
bows needs to be fixed/improved.<br/>
<br/>
3 - the ability to combine armor + items to produce a<br/>
more powerful armor (like taking a tattered cloak and<br/>
turning it into a thermal cloak -- possible AC boost<br/>
and alternate effects)<br/>
<br/>
4 - the ability to make boxes that store items more<br/>
efficiently, as well as reduce weight (very expensive<br/>
again, 100pp-2000pp)<br/>
<br/>
5 - a lightsource you don&#39;t have to hold<br/>
<br/>
Those are just some realistic ideas that could easily<br/>
be implemented in the game and NOT unbalance the game<br/>
(dupe items already exist).  Right now tinkering has<br/>
NO REAL useful items.  Those that are in the game can<br/>
easily be supplimented in some other way.  Example:<br/>
compasses can be bought, casters can use their sight<br/>
spells, fishing poles are easy to come by and<br/>
insignificant anyway, and you have to hold a lantern)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s toss some ideas around, and try to get a<br/>
petition pulled up.  I really think Verant needs to<br/>
implement trade skills in a MUCH better way, all of<br/>
them are severly lacking (Smithing needs to make<br/>
platemail and magical platemail, tailoring needs to be<br/>
made magical as well, brewing, bakery, and pottery<br/>
need practical applications)<br/>
