<b>Subject:</b> Shifting gears to thermal cloak... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514748167">Prior to this patch some thermal cloak combos that have been tried by Luke<br/>
include:<br/>
<br/>
small patchwork cloak<br/>
firewater<br/>
2 - 5 rods<br/>
<br/>
regular patchwork cloak<br/>
firewater <br/>
2 - 5 rods<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
any myself i tried<br/>
<br/>
small patchwork cloak<br/>
firewater<br/>
2 rods<br/>
<br/>
small raw-hide cloak<br/>
firewater<br/>
2 rods<br/>
1 belt<br/>
<br/>
small raw-hide cloak<br/>
firewater<br/>
2 rods<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This recipe shouldn&#39;t be as hard to figure out, we KNOW that a type of<br/>
cloak, some firewater and some rods are a part of it.  That much is<br/>
absolutely certain, what is uncertain is if there is a 4th item in the<br/>
recipie.  It could be a needle, since the book says the rods are sewn into<br/>
the cloak, it could be the cloak is a clothe cloak of somekind.  The book<br/>
just says small tattered cloak.  Its also possible that a belt is in the<br/>
formula, it shouldn&#39;t be hard to figure this one out.<br/>
