<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922437441">There&#39;s a gnome on our server, Mauldoon, who has a<br/>
skill of 172.  He raised his skill up by harvesting<br/>
the coral mesh from sharks (lvl 20ish) in the OOT.  He<br/>
never shared the information with anyone.  Now the<br/>
mobs stopped dropping the items, and he&#39;s got a lock<br/>
on our market.  He also knows the location of diamond<br/>
dust, but refuses to tell anyone where it is.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty cool guy, eh?  He once told me that he&#39;d tell<br/>
me where diamond dust was if I got him twinked to<br/>
level 39.  Nope, not worth it to me.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you all want to complain about tinkering to<br/>
someone, let Mauldoon, from Solusek Ro, know how you<br/>
feel.  Be forewarned that his ego is about the size of<br/>
Long Island.  He gets a /rude everytime I see him.<br/>
