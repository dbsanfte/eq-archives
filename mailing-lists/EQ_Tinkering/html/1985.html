<br/>
In my travels I hear grumbling from rouges unable to find <br/>
any traps to disarm while peddling mechanical lockpicks.<br/>
Bards wishing they could make their own instruments.  <br/>
(neither apparently implemented)<br/>
<br/>
Many merchants across Norrath sell unfinished horns, <br/>
lute strings, mouth pieces etc...<br/>
<br/>
Then I pondered on how organized the tinkering community <br/>
has always been.  Research into Gimblestan&#39;s puzzling<br/>
notes as seen at Fulcrum&#39;s Compendium.<br/>
<br/>
Could our Workbox be useful for other than tinkering?  <br/>
For those who have bard friends, I know there is no trade <br/>
skill like fletching or jewelry that is unique to them.<br/>
Singing, blowing horns, pounding on drums and strumming of course.<br/>
