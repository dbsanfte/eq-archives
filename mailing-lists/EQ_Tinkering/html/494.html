<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137447948">During the beta, the developer for the trade skils said that<br/>
for Tinkering it was VERY IMPORTANT to read between the lines<br/>
in the Journals of Gimblestan.  If that&#39;s a given lets look<br/>
at the description of the Spyglass.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...The extra Metal Rod gives it a good shell while the bottle and<br/>
metal twine hold and amplify the vision...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve taken this to mean that because it says extra the collapsable<br/>
pole must have at least 1 metal rod.  I&#39;m also assuming since it<br/>
doesn&#39;t say extra or additional on the metal twine or bottle that<br/>
they probably aren&#39;t a component.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I may be way off base.  As soon as I have more money <br/>
to experiment with I&#39;m going to start trying to make this one.<br/>
