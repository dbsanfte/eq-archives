&gt; &gt; Not sure if this has been addressed, but is there still a skill level cap <br/>
&gt; &gt; based upon level?  I&#39;ve been using a 29 wizard to learn tinkering but I <br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t play him anymore so he won&#39;t likely go up in level anymore.  I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; &gt; approaching the point where the cap could come into effect and I don&#39;t want <br/>
&gt; &gt; to blow money if I&#39;m not going to gain any points.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was just getting ready to start looking into this.  I made 16 a few days<br/>
&gt; ago.  If there&#39;s still a cap, then I won&#39;t be able to gain any skill yet. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got a bit of cash saved up, and was going to head over to Steamfont and<br/>
&gt; see what happened when I started tinkering.  I&#39;ll let you know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK.  I made it over to Steamfont today.  210pp later, my tinkering skill is<br/>
71.  I&#39;m level 16.  I&#39;m thinking the cap is gone.<br/>
