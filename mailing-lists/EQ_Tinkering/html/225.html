<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530197945">I don&#39;t know, but I hjave heard that you can kill the gnoms at the two other <br/>
obsearvatories and they will have the lens on them.<br/>
Who was it that said an assistant guide told him that tinkering was fully <br/>
functional? Well that may be true, maybe it is fully fuctional now. But that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that the related quests are ;)<br/>
Another thing, for all we know, this may have nothing to do with tinkering. <br/>
Maybe when we finish the quest we&#39;ll get a piece of cloth armor and a few <br/>
sliver. I&#39;m not saying we should give up, because it&#39;s the best lead we have <br/>
for now, but I&#39;m just saying, don&#39;t get your hopes to high, even if we can <br/>
find all he lenses.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;So far, I have been able to get only the one off the dark elf in Freeport.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The one that Bidl Frugrin has, well, as we all know, I haven&#39;t found.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The other two from the observatories, well, they keep telling me to come<br/>
&gt;back in a few weeks.  Has anyone gotten one from them?  Please let me know <br/>
&gt;how.<br/>
