<div id="ygrps-yiv-490261455">I took a look around Akanon, noticed that the scrapyard gnome now has a new<br/>
name and a different newbie quest, don&#39;t know how long that&#39;s been around.<br/>
Saw the new part at the tinkering merchant, the metal fastening that costs<br/>
18pp.<br/>
<br/>
Later I stopped by the Test server and the Bom Knotwood there has 3 other<br/>
new tinkering pieces along with the fastening: Sharkskin tubing (168pp),<br/>
Lime coated meshing (187pp) and Fine Coral Mesh (225pp).  If these are in<br/>
fact new tinkering components and now required to make the scuba gear it&#39;ll<br/>
be quite a project.  With a cost like that its safe to say it probably is<br/>
the same as a Fishbone earring, as well as an excellent money sink hehe<br/>
<br/>
You lacked the skills to fashion the items together.  lol<br/>

&gt;If the hinge is part of the formula, its going to be expensive to just<br/>
&gt;randomly try things to see if they work.  That hinge is 13 plat a pop.<br/>
