<b>Subject:</b> Re: New to this forum....Infravision goggles <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-260242703">I have also seen these.. and in Beta i was approached (i was a gnome wizard) and asked to make the infravision goggles out of these lens... The person said that they were a required component which he found out through a quest or something.. however tinkering was not yet fully implimented so i was unable to do this. I should have followed up on it more though.... :(<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&quot;They are called the &quot;Lens of <br/>
&gt;Glowing Amber&quot; Which makes me pretty much think that they are definately the <br/>
&gt;first component.  And they are dropped by a froglock summoner in upper guk.  <br/>
&gt;Personally I am not high enough to go find these myself yet..So have not <br/>
&gt;personally seen one but have seen various posts enough to know that they do <br/>
&gt;exist..except people don&#39;t know what to do with them. And I am sure this is <br/>
&gt;a rare drop because you just don&#39;t see those over the auction channels <br/>
&gt;everyday..;)<br/>
