don&#39;t however have any of the other ones and now when I ask <br/>
about the quest I get a message saying you are too high level.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard the &quot;come back later&quot; gnomes actually have a lens <br/>
every so often, but I don&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve never heard anyone<br/>
who has gotten a lens from them. I always figured I had to be<br/>
higher level. I left Faydwer for Antonica around level 10 and came<br/>
back around level 16 and they said I was too powerful now. I guess<br/>
I&#39;ll never be able to join my guild there *g*<br/>

I read someone finally got their tinkering skill to go up. I&#39;ve<br/>
burnt through about 24 plat of Flameless Lanterns and had nothing<br/>
go up. Anyone know how long it takes? Is it just luck?<br/>
