<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695114015">I would take a guess - and this is only a guess - that the power mudules<br/>
may be used in the making of the Thermal Cloak - or even perhaps the<br/>
Gnomish Environmental Suit (even though I still think this is a fake<br/>
item).  I can&#39;t imagine a fishing pole needing any kind of power source,<br/>
unless the gears are &quot;automatic&quot; and need &quot;batteries,&quot; but this still<br/>
sounds farfetched.  I could also see the infavision goggles needing a mock<br/>
power source but again this is only a guess.  <br/>
<br/>
Making those bags would be quite impressive, however I imagine also very<br/>
expensive to make taking in consideration how much they vendors sell them.<br/>
 Personally, I&#39;m not convinced Verant would allow us to make such a<br/>
powerful item but it will be interesting to see.  I can&#39;t wait to check<br/>
out the third book - I imagine it will be quite the eye opener.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the location of the book goes, there must be some clues within<br/>
Soluesk and the mino caves (considering the author had quite a few<br/>
dealings with minos).  Has anyone tried going around to each NPC and asked<br/>
&quot;Do you know Gimble-so-and-so? (I can&#39;t remember the spelling)<br/>
<br/>
As anyone experimented with the Glowing Amber Lens to see if they can make<br/>
the goggles yet?  Any beta-testers on this list who knew the beta-recipe?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On the third book:<br/>
&gt; I know a gnome on my server (Fennin Ro) named Renten I think, that was<br/>
&gt; utterly obsessed with finding the third book.  He said he found clues<br/>
&gt; that led him to Permafrost where he had been searching for the past<br/>
&gt; several days (and he was level 8 at the time).  I&#39;m convinced he is on<br/>
&gt; to something, nobody in their right mind would risk that kind of venture<br/>
&gt; without good reason.  However, I have not heard anything from him in<br/>
&gt; several weeks, he may have given up or lost his level many times, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know.  But I&#39;m going back there to do some more exporing myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On Solusek&#39;s Eye:<br/>
&gt; If you invis yourself, you can get to the gnome castle easily.  I have<br/>
&gt; run all over it, and hailed almost every gnome I have found there.  The<br/>
&gt; one vendor does have the bag of the tinkerers and I&#39;m wondering if we<br/>
&gt; can tinker it somehow.  He also carries broken force modules, broken<br/>
&gt; frost modules, functional frost modules, and a power module.  THIS<br/>
&gt; intrigues me!  Could it be that the force and power module might be<br/>
&gt; needed to make the bag, or maybe the collapsible fishing pole is<br/>
&gt; powered?  <br/>
&gt; Maybe these items are needed as well as the vendor-sold gizmos and such<br/>
&gt; in ak&#39;anon to construct things like the Pole or the Bag, or maybe even<br/>
&gt; things none of us players have thought of yet.  The last idea seems<br/>
&gt; reasonable to me since most the junk we know how to make and can make is<br/>
&gt; virtually worthless to other players since they can get cheaper<br/>
&gt; alternatives than our stuff.<br/>
