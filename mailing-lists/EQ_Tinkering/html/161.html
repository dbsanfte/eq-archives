<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102095565">First and foremost, delete the &quot;muffin tin&quot; patch!  Lets start getting <br/>
experience again.  Really, where did they find these programmers?<br/>
<br/>
Onto the items:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Flameless lanterns:  Ok, yet I haven&#39;t sold any.<br/>
2)  Compasses:  Make components cheaper to buy, namely the static <br/>
orb.  However, I have sold 8 so far for 5pp each, about 16pp profit (over a <br/>
two week period).  So I won&#39;t be too upset if they leave it alone.<br/>
3)  Stalking Probes:  Make them explode for LOTS (few hundred points or so, <br/>
AE) of damage when hit by attackers.  Then it&#39;ll be more than a VERY <br/>
expensive Eye of Zomm clone.  This would make it useful and desirable to <br/>
handle big mobs.  And make them last a bit longer than 30 seconds, and make <br/>
them reusable if not destroyed.<br/>
4)  Cams:  Besides getting them to work (really, if its hard to do then <br/>
they&#39;ve botched the whole EQ system design from the start, anyone ever hear <br/>
of Object Oriented Programming?), make them premium cams providing better <br/>
range than any other cams available.<br/>
5)  Thermal Cloak:  Why must one use a TATTERED cloak!  This is ridiculous <br/>
and another sign of poor programming.  Make it so that a small cloth cape <br/>
works too, geez.  OR!  make a cloak pattern for tailors!  Wow!  What a <br/>
novel idea!<br/>
6)  Mechanical Lockpicks:  Haven&#39;t made any, but will as I am a <br/>
rogue.  Hope at least that they work.<br/>
7)  The remaining items:  I have no idea how to make them because I don&#39;t <br/>
have the books (and I am not sure they exist) so I have no ideas on their <br/>
improvement.<br/>
<br/>
Uggg!</div>
