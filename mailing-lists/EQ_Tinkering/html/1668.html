<b>Subject:</b> My first Rebreather! Woohoo! (sort of) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754713578">Last nite (with a skill of 104) I risked every last dime I had<br/>
and attempted a rebreather! It worked! I was pretty excited.<br/>
<br/>
But... I&#39;m amazed at this thing. It sorta sucks.<br/>
<br/>
1. you have to wear it. So all those melee&#39;rs with fancy helms have<br/>
 to wear this stupid 1 AC rebreather instead. (They&#39;ll love that)<br/>
<br/>
2. It weighs 10. I know this has been lamented before, but there goes<br/>
  the monk market.<br/>
<br/>
3. Fishbone earring gives +3 dex.<br/>
<br/>
So, still the fishbone earrings are much more desirable (hate to say it).<br/>
Personally, I want an aqualung more than this, at least it sits in my<br/>
inventory slot.</div>
