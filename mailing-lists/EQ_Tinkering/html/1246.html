<br/>
I hate to be a downer... but I doubt the 50 charges to 1 charge is a bug. <br/>
Verrant has a long history of defusing ways of making easy money.<br/>
EXAMPLE: Crafted Gauntlets were originally not lore and could be sold back <br/>
to a merchant to actually make a tad bit of profit if you had high enough <br/>
CHA. After a few GMs noted at how many crafted gauntlets were popping up at <br/>
merchants, they changed crafted to lore (except bracers of course.) I <br/>
realize this isn&#39;t a trade skill item but many  items that were once <br/>
sellable or tradeable are now not. Tis sad, but it defeats the idea of TRADE <br/>
skills.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind of Tinkering&#39;s track record... has anything up to this point <br/>
been vitally useful to sell? nope.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna change now <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
Verrant has started a tradition now of making things useful to their <br/>
original owner be it by making the item no-drop, or changing the charges on <br/>
an item when traded. As noted in previous mesaages, this is already in place <br/>
with items such as the Staff of Observers.<br/>
<br/>
Verrant is not likely aiming to replace the long lines for a fishbone <br/>
earring with a tinkered item.  It seems they are coming up with a variety of <br/>
ways for different classes to make the journey into Kedge. They merely added <br/>
a way for us tinkerers to journey there ourselves with the help of our on <br/>
trade skill.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been to Kedge Keep twice merely on enduring breath,<br/>
