<div id="ygrps-yiv-247152209"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;	As people began to believe one thing nad become so advant abouit it, they<br/>
&gt;tend to become ugly to the point of hatred. People speak so freely about<br/>
&gt;what they know is right or wrong without even really finding out a <br/>
&gt;deffinent<br/>
&gt;asnwer for themselves. As for the person that is angry about this thread,<br/>
&gt;man lighten up. As for right now everyone knows that Tinkering like <br/>
&gt;Reaserch<br/>
&gt;is a trade skill. That means that when you learn it you can continue to<br/>
&gt;learn with out me capped out on a level. I have read many threads where<br/>
&gt;people believe this or that. Then when someone says something and everyone<br/>
&gt;finds out it was true they are like I knew that. Ok As far as it has been<br/>
&gt;said my BM is that on all trade skills includeing research and the other<br/>
&gt;hard to raise skills there is no cap per level. So I believe that it is<br/>
&gt;possible to go above actually I have a gnome with 77 and I am 18 that is 2<br/>
&gt;points above max. I got the money to raise this from my guild but none the<br/>
&gt;less. FRom my experiance and what has been said it seems the either one the<br/>
&gt;cap is different or the cap is gone. I do not doubt anything people have<br/>
&gt;said but it seems that, there may be alot of truth in some things.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Correct me if I am wrong, but are you saying that spell research does not <br/>
have a cap?  You are mistaken if you think so.  To be as objective as <br/>
possible, I will detail the circumstances that convince me that spell <br/>
research is capped per level.<br/>
<br/>
I play on Erollisi Marr, and general consensus is that each server has its <br/>
own tweaked code, for whatever reason.  On this server, I have played a <br/>
wizard up to level 44, and spent training points/cash on most of my spell <br/>
research skill learns.  I would say maybe 15% of my gains in spell research <br/>
have come strictly from combining runes.  Now, everytime I level, I go to a <br/>
guildmaster and train this skill.  It goes up 5 times, and then the <br/>
guildmaster refuses to train me anymore, until I level again.  As a test, <br/>
once I did nothing but rune practice for 5 points, then went to the <br/>
guildmaster.  He could not train me.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that some servers have skill caps, and others do not.  Just <br/>
compare zone closings on different servers.  If they are supposedly the same <br/>
code base, why do some servers go down for software maintenance and others <br/>
do not?<br/>
<br/>
It is also possible that the guildmaster is level capped, but practice is <br/>
not.  This is difficult for me to verify because, at level 44 with max <br/>
research, I first have to level to 45, then collect a ton of level 44 runes <br/>
to combine.  I have had a problem acquiring those runes, so it would take <br/>
weeks to verify a level cap or not in that fashion.  But, in that amount of <br/>
time, I will have levelled, so the process is a waste for me.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am trying to say is that it may very well be possible that <br/>
some servers have a level-cap on tinkering, and others do not.<br/>
<br/>
I know that Erollisi Marr had a tinkering cap 2 months ago for sure.</div>
