<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014298239">1. Whats the lodestone for at our new merchant?<br/>
<br/>
2. Has anyone done any research into the unstable firewater mentioned in the<br/>
   journal? The one that sent a firework screaming into the storage facility?<br/>
   I tried several combinations of multiple Gnomish Spirits and water, but no<br/>
   progress.<br/>
<br/>
3. Any idea where this &quot;storage cavern&quot; mentioned is?<br/>
<br/>
4. I tried combining a stalking probes and a firewater from the other reference<br/>
   in the first (2nd?) journal. Where Gimble was afraid the probe could<br/>
   explode (funny, I&#39;m HOPING the dam probes will explode!  :)  Anyone else<br/>
   try stuff along this line?<br/>
<br/>
5. Anyone do tinkering when EQ was beta? Any formulas for robots and such?<br/>
   I know they were taken out, but maybe such recipes would give clues.<br/>
<br/>
6. Anyone find any use for the small power sources and function force modules<br/>
   found in Solusek?</div>
