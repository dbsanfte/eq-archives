<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916066718">Well being that I am old :)  Money for me didn&#39;t start to come in till I<br/>
was in the mid 20s.  When I say money I mean having enough to have all your<br/>
spells in your book with change left over. :)  Now a days to get loads of<br/>
cash (10k+) you either need to sell items for cash or farm mobs for it.<br/>
Undeniably one of the best ways is to be a pet caster at 49+ and hit the<br/>
hill giants.  A friend of mine made over 20k+ in one week between her and<br/>
her partner doing just that.<br/>
As for levels one of the places you can try would be sol A.  The items from<br/>
there don&#39;t trade that great but you get lots of FineSteel drops with a<br/>
vendor in the zone.  Enchanter pets aren&#39;t quite as good at the job as are<br/>
Mage and Necro pets but at your level, and more than likely even better at<br/>
44+ you should do ok in Sol A.<br/>
Hill Giants are generally though of as better, but at your level you should<br/>
probably enlist the help of a partner or two.</div>
