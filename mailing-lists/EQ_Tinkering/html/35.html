<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686544852">first i would like to say ya&#39;ll are doin a great thing here. Here&#39;s what<br/>
i have heard, there are three other books(besides the two at mills)<br/>
where or when you get em is beyond me. I too have made the firewater,<br/>
and the lantern, and say one person auctioning off the cams for the<br/>
bows, so i know those have been made also. As has already been posted i<br/>
too heard that the infravision goggles instructions came from a quest.<br/>
Which one i don&#39;t know. Also i know as a fact that you can tinker<br/>
successfully at level 1, but cannot gain any skill level til level 16.<br/>
So all of you that are waiting to try it, go for it...it will work, i<br/>
decided to try it at level 11 with my gnome, and made fire water on<br/>
first try. Also i believe that you can make the thermal cloak from just<br/>
about any cloak...doesn&#39;t have to be tattered... I am wanting to try<br/>
similar things with lanterns ans stuff..(i.e. use small lantern and<br/>
such). If anyone has tried it with other items please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
