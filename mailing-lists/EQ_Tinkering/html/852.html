<div id="ygrps-yiv-471982917">Okay I guess you didnt see the rest of the mail buddy because i said I SAW <br/>
with my own eyes spyglass.That was the important part.I dont remeber Fxeers <br/>
e-mail adress but it&#39;s someling lordgrunk or something . He said he will show <br/>
it to any one who wants to see it. I made a character on cazicthule just to <br/>
see.Who cares if he doesnt  know the guy personally. The important thing is <br/>
that some one gave him a collapsible pole to make a spyglass with which means <br/>
that it is NOT broke.<br/>
