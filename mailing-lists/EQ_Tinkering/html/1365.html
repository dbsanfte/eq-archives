<b>Subject:</b> Apologies and a Funny Story <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-679340083">I apologize for angering anyone who was not a part of this stupid little <br/>
flame war.  I worded my second post wrong, as it was not intended to <br/>
attacked anyone not a part of the &quot;hmm...lets attack Ranth&#39;s buisness <br/>
techinques&quot; group.  This subject has now boiled down to, well, worthless <br/>
crap...for example:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hmmm BTW what age are you ? if you could read then you would have noticed <br/>
that<br/>
zinken aint a player ITï¿½S MY E-MAIL  DUMBASS!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
this is completely irrelivant to anything that is supposed to be discussed <br/>
here, and i apologize for zinken/askur.(i incited him to write this).<br/>
<br/>
Focasa and Vapn, i was not trying to be self-righteous, and i see now that i <br/>
in fact came off that way.  i am in no way better than anyone else.  <br/>
Ok...well...enough of this. Check this out..i laughed my ass off:<br/>
<br/>
I got this off of everquest.com from somoene who got it elsewhere...i <br/>
figured i should post it here ;)<br/>
Verant Headquarters, the near future:<br/>
Brad McQuaid sits at his desk, sipping a coke and reading the<br/>
alt.games.everquest newsgroup. Suddenly cola shoots from his mouth and<br/>
nose as something he reads makes him sputter and choke. He sits still for<br/>
several seconds in stunned silence and springs into action<br/>
<br/>
He leaps from his chair and runs to his bookshelf, and pulls gently on a <br/>
book<br/>
titled: &quot;Customer Service Fundamentals&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The book is fake, of course, as such a text would never be present on a<br/>
bookshelf of a Verant employee. The book slides out one inch, and stops with <br/>
a<br/>
&quot;click&quot;. The gentle hum of machinery is heard and a section of the wall <br/>
slides<br/>
open, revealing a table. The table is bare marble except for what appears to <br/>
be<br/>
a rectangular block of obsidian, set on the table at a 45 degree angle.<br/>
<br/>
Brad takes a deep breath, and steps forward. He places his right hand upon <br/>
the<br/>
obsidian block. It is warm to the touch. Suddenly, the stone flares hot for <br/>
an<br/>
instant and a soft disembodied voice proclaims &quot;Aradune Identified. Welcome<br/>
Mr. McQuaid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Brad hesitates, fearing and dreading what he is about to do. His hand leaves <br/>
the<br/>
obsidian identification panel and he clenches his fist and stares down at <br/>
his<br/>
reflection in the smooth marble. A single tear drips down and slightly <br/>
distorts<br/>
the image. &quot;No, I must!&quot; he shouts &quot;Its for the good of overall gameplay! <br/>
Its for<br/>
the good of overall gameplay!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With new resolve, his hand slaps roughly against the obsidian panel. Again, <br/>
a<br/>
hot flash, and the same voice announces &quot;Aradune Identified. Welcome Mr.<br/>
McQuaid&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Computer. This is Aradune. Activate the Nerf Protocols&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A white aura speads around Brad, and the door shuts with a loud slam.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately around San Diego, pagers begin to beep. Scores of engineers<br/>
become pale, and the one common thought among them is &quot;Oh no, for the love<br/>
of God no. Not again. Not now!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They soon arrive at Verant headquarters and file slowly into a meeting room.<br/>
The eerie red alert light of the Nerf Protocols makes the water cooler seem <br/>
to<br/>
be filled with blood, and despite their thirst, nobody is drinking.<br/>
<br/>
A man dressed in what appears to be green metal enters the room. The<br/>
engineers&#39; last hopes that this is a drill fade. The man sits in a chair and <br/>
the<br/>
room waits in silence for several minutes. Finally, one brave programmer<br/>
speaks up timidly,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Umm, Brad, why a----&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;WHO IS BRAD????&quot; the man booms, rising from his seat in anger.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No!! No!!! I mean Aradune!! Aradune!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;THIS IS A ROLE PLAYING GAME, FOOL!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am sorry, Aradune! I meant no disrespect! We just wish to know why once<br/>
again, the Nerf Protocols have been activated?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why don&#39;t you ask Thomas?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The entire room turns twiftly to focus in on Thomas, a young level designer <br/>
for<br/>
Everquest. The blood drains out of his face and a look of pure horror <br/>
spreads<br/>
across his features. The engineers on either side of him slowly begin moving<br/>
their chairs away.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;W--w--what did I do?&quot; begged Thomas, &quot;I&#39;ve been working on the Hole, and I<br/>
helped out on that new patch program, I haven&#39;t started too much other stuff<br/>
since I finished up the plane of hate, and-&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While Aradune says nothing, the flair of his eyes says more than words ever<br/>
could.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;NO!! NO!! You approved of the Hateplane! Don&#39;t you remember? We took items<br/>
from the POF? We actually managed to charge a 200pp toll to get in there!&quot;<br/>
Thomas was openly weeping now, the tears flowing unchecked down his face, &quot;I<br/>
remember how you laughed when I told you we were just going to kill everyone<br/>
in a zone and call it a &#39;GM Event&#39; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Aradune waits for the sobbing to fade then speaks, dangerously quietly<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you know how the Plane of Hate was described on usenet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;H-h-h-how?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;POSSIBLE&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The room gasps in terror, and they know Thomas&#39; fate is sealed.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How can we keep our L50 customers, &quot; says Aradune, trembling with anger, <br/>
&quot;if<br/>
the opening of a new zone doesn&#39;t immediately make them loose three or four<br/>
levels???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;M SORRY!!!!&quot; Thomas screams<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I know, I know, &quot; Aradune sooths, leading Thomas out of the room. The other<br/>
engineers look at each other, hoping that this time will be different. <br/>
Suddenly<br/>
the sobbing turns into a shriek, and is abruptly cut off.<br/>
<br/>
Aradune re-enters the room, along, washing his hands on a towel. Several<br/>
engineers begin crying, quietly.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Say It!&quot; Aradune demands, and the engineers repeat the prayer they&#39;ve come<br/>
to learn too well.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thomas was nerfed for the good of everquest. For the long term enjoyment<br/>
of the players, and the viability of the company, it had to be done. There <br/>
never<br/>
was a Thomas.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The engineers knew by tomorrow that Thomas&#39; cube would be empty, and all<br/>
records of his employment would be gone. Spontaneously, they began shouting<br/>
over each other trying to impress their leader. &quot;Lay Hands can Fizzle now!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Lifetaps are resistible!&quot; &quot;Yeah, well, i&#39;m in charge of ROGUES!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Aradune quiets them all with a sharp wave of his hand.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have already repaired the problem. The new wizard teleport point is <br/>
directly<br/>
between the legs of Innoruuk. We&#39;ll keep it that way for a few days until <br/>
people<br/>
tire of losing their corpses, then we&#39;ll try to fix the mistakes made by the <br/>
One<br/>
who is No More.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The engineers left the room slowly. Each of them felt as if they had aged 10<br/>
years in the few hours they had been in the room. They each swore to<br/>
themselves that they would never repeat the mistake that Thomas had, for <br/>
they<br/>
feared the wraith of Aradune.<br/>
<br/>
Whats everyone else think?</div>
