<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-380450886">Hmm...what is the trivial level for Footwarming Boots?  They may be <br/>
the missing link.  If they are higher than aqualungs (148) and more <br/>
economical than rebreathers, then they could help boost skill for all <br/>
of us tinkerers that are on a budget.  Can someone post what they <br/>
have found on the boot&#39;s trivial level?  Also, can someone past 148 <br/>
make some boots to see if they increase skill about the same or <br/>
better than rebreathers?<br/>
<br/>
This will help me a bunch in trying to put together a training plan.  <br/>
Might also help someone increase their skill to the point where they <br/>
can make at least one piece of Watchman armor.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to know if Watchman armor is going to be worthwhile or <br/>
not.  I hope they give it decent AC and we don&#39;t have the <br/>
mysteriously disappearing AC like we do for rebreathers.  But we <br/>
won&#39;t know until someone makes it.  Sigh...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info in advance.<br/>

&gt; Was afraid of that.. 26 attempts and no increases.  I might make <br/>
&gt; footwarming boots before I would do rebreathers perhaps.  At least <br/>
I can <br/>

rebreathers to<br/>

failures,<br/>
