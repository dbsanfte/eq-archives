<div id="ygrps-yiv-109841227">sorry my friend but for 700 plat anyone can purchase 50 enduring breath potions<br/>
i dont really see why anyone would pay that UNLESS as stated earlier we provide<br/>
an upgrade to rebreather for a viable cost. i agree with an earlier post wherein<br/>
we gig anyone who wont purchase the aqualung but wants a rebreather and cut some<br/>
slack to those who purchase both. this isnt really a prob for me as im only in it<br/>
to equip my guild and have full backing from them. just an opinion and glad to hear<br/>
the level cap is going to get fixed. you wouldnt believe the amount of cash i wasted<br/>
of the guild treasury trying to raise my skill. well see you all in game.<br/>
