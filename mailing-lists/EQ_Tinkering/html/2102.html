<b>Subject:</b> Gordon on summoned water breathing stones <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-769285688">Is the list still alive?  Haven&#39;t seen a post in quite a while.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d pass on a quote from Gordon.  I can see his point, but I<br/>
don&#39;t quite agree with it.  Tho I&#39;m no where near the tinkering level to<br/>
make them, I can invision a situation like this:<br/>
<br/>
A poor Gnome who&#39;s spent months and several thousand plat, worked hard and <br/>
spent an insane amount of time and effort to master tinkering walks into<br/>
the zone outside Kedge and shouts &quot;Rebreather for sale 2k pp&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any mage walks in the zone outside Kedge and shouts &quot;a bunch of<br/>
breathing stones for sale 20pp&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How many tells do you think the gnome will get?  :(<br/>
<br/>
Q: This latest patch just made the mages 1-charge water breathing stones<br/>
non-lore. I already had a heck of a time selling my aqualungs/rebreathers.<br/>
Now any 50 lev can walk into unrest and offer 20pp for a backpack full of<br/>
stones to any 20th level mage.<br/>
<br/>
A: This really shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Sure, they might be non-lore, but<br/>
they are summoned so they will disappear on log out or on a lost <br/>
connection. Something that does unlimited enduring breath is superior to<br/>
the stones. -Gordon<br/>
