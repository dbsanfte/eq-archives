<b>Subject:</b> Are there different kinds of fishing poles?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-229046947">Not having done much fishing, I seem to remember there being a couple different kinds of fishing poles.<br/>
<br/>
Since a pole is probably one of the components of the tinkered collapsable fishing pole, just wanted to make sure I used the right one in my attempts.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
