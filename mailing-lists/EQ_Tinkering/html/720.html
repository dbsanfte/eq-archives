<div id="ygrps-yiv-919158052">LOL so did I.  As a matter of fact I got a bunch of people from my guild and<br/>
we all got enduring breath and we scoured every inch of that water and<br/>
didn&#39;t come up with anything!  :(  Though we all mastered swimming.  (I&#39;m at<br/>
116 now) It was kinda fun actually.  Beats sitting and waiting for the the<br/>
next spawn to hack and slash.  I just hope it&#39;s not down in that kedge keep<br/>
place.  But why on earth would they put information to find such basic<br/>
tinering knowledge on how to make a fishing pole in such a dangerous place<br/>
like that.  I mean the book of wu (contains tailoring info for the hard to<br/>
make cured silk and stuff) can be found on a lvl 20 orc in lesser feydark.<br/>
That thing is simple to get.  Does anyone else know of any other trade books<br/>
that are gotten off a monster or some other way other then buying off a<br/>
merchant?<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did find was a swimming guide!  heh never saw that before.<br/>
There was a Guide V swimming around down there around the king&#39;s palace.<br/>
Hailed her, but just gave the standard guide response.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t find any coin.  Where exactly is that at?<br/>

&gt; Heh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That hole is huge.  If you swim down far enough you hit... NOTHING!  I<br/>
even<br/>
&gt; scraped the walls to see if I could find a secret room, nothing.  Anywho.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; scanned all of Ak&#39;anon today underwater (145 swimming currently).  Didn&#39;t<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; anything cool to note.  Scanned for about an hour or so.  Was a waste of<br/>
time I<br/>
&gt; think. </span></blockquote></div>
