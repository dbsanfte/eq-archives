<div id="ygrps-yiv-253110814">Do any of you actually sell these?  I&#39;ve been carrying around all the<br/>
components to make them lately, and even though I always give them away<br/>
(no-one has ever not accepted them), I seem to be making more money than<br/>
they cost me to make!  Occationally I do make a dud, but I&#39;d say they are<br/>
pretty much fixed now, good work verant!  for best results have as many<br/>
people casting them as possible, some from far away some from close.  I also<br/>
think that we should start flooding the servers with these, make loads and<br/>
give them away as much as possible (less than a gold piece for 4, I believe<br/>
they cost to make).  for those who &lt;dont&gt; know how to make them, its easy.<br/>
put a gnomish spirits and a flask of water (flask) into your toolbox and<br/>
combine.  now put the firewater back in the toolbox, add a metal shaft, and<br/>
a batwing, press combine voila!<br/>

PS.  dont forget to remind them not to use them near guards.  And make sure<br/>
they take them out of their backpacks before lighting them... that is real<br/>
ugly</div>
