<div id="ygrps-yiv-706287824">Well, I will definitely keep my eyes open. Ak&#39;anon sounds like a good bet<br/>
for locating the solution. I HOPE we don&#39;t have to search every inch of<br/>
water in Norrath ! Perhaps it is the 3rd book that they found. It might have<br/>
been lost in the water of Ak&#39;anon, kind of like how the One Ring was lost in<br/>
the river Anduin. We just have to be as clever as Smeagol in finding it. )<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here, as I promised is a full report of not only what information I<br/>
posess,<br/>
&gt; but what I discovered by applying it (which currently is not much,<br/>
&gt; unfortunately). First, I will tell you exactly HOW I came upon the<br/>
&gt; information as well as some other things, then I will tell you what my<br/>
&gt; search yeilded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First, it was long ago, on this very list that one person said something<br/>
&gt; about a monk. He said the the monk named Lindel on the Veeshan server<br/>
seemed<br/>
&gt; to know more thta he let&#39;s on. No one payed much mind to the statement,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; I figured &quot;Heck, I play on the Veeshan, so I can check it out, see if he<br/>
&gt; does know anything&quot;. I added him to my friends list and checked if he was<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; all the time. He didn&#39;t come on for a long time, but then he did. I very<br/>
&gt; politely asked if he knew anything about the collapsible fishing pole, and<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; lagre conversation ensuded. I led on that I had spent much time searching<br/>
&gt; for the pole, and it&#39;s secret. (I know it was a lie, but I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; just demand the information) I told him that I would tell no one, and<br/>
begged<br/>
&gt; it from him. He told me that he couldn&#39;t tell me, and I asked him why. He<br/>
&gt; said that only he and other &quot;members of the mark&quot; knew about it. He said<br/>
&gt; they were a small group of friends that knew the secret. I asked him if I<br/>
&gt; could join the mark, but he said that they approach YOU about joining, not<br/>
&gt; the other way around. I think the the mark, as he called it, it probably a<br/>
&gt; &quot;secret&quot; group of people, not bound by any guild name. They might be even<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; inter-server group. I begged and pushed him more, telling him that I had<br/>
&gt; searched forever, and deserved at least a hint. I told him that I had<br/>
&gt; searched the world over many times. Then he said something to the effect<br/>
of:<br/>
&gt; &quot;You have searched the world over, but have you searched it below?&quot; He<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; went to further say: &quot;Search beneath the waves.&quot;<br/>
&gt; This I though, could be the break we needed, now we don&#39;t have to search<br/>
&gt; totaly aimlessly. I doubt that he was lying, too, the way we went about<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; conversation, I belive he was giving true hints.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, I will tell what I came up with. The first part of the clue he said<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; search underground, basically. Ak&#39;Anon is underground, so that was the<br/>
first<br/>
&gt; place to come to mind, because it also had a lake, which would justify the<br/>
&gt; &quot;Search beneath the waves&quot; part, which could also mean the oceans, or<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; bodies of water, but for now, I wanted to stick with Ak&#39;Anon. I figured<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; there could be some sort of secret entrance, a fake wall leading into a<br/>
&gt; hidden cave or something. I finally got back to Ak&#39;Anon tonight and search<br/>
&gt; around a bit. Altough my search was not thuroughly extensive, I did find<br/>
&gt; something VERY VERY interesting (altough it wasn&#39;t in the water). I found,<br/>
&gt; on the ground, an item called An old silver coin. It looked like a normal<br/>
&gt; silver coin, but it was an actual item. The strangest thing, though was<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; it was a MAGIC ITEM, a LORE ITEM, AND...NO DROP! But wait! Items that are<br/>
no<br/>
&gt; drop can&#39;t be on the ground, but that was where I found it. SO! It must be<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; quest item, an item that spawned, not something dropped by another player.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; think that it may be related to something we are looking for. For now,<br/>
&gt; though, we should all have our very own old silver coins. I found it in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; room with the ater wheel, on the other side of the bridge on the high<br/>
cliff<br/>
&gt; above the scrap yard with the Syford Montop guy. It was next to one<br/>
ofthose<br/>
&gt; rotating little star thingies. One without a stand. Hope you can all find<br/>
&gt; one, so that we can have more and see about what they might be used for.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I think we should all try to brainstorm about what Lindels clues<br/>
might<br/>
&gt; have meant. Well now that you have it, my information, feel free to make<br/>
&gt; comments and add ideas. For now, I must part. Good luck, friends.<br/>
