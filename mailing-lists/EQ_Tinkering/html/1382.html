<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-404560473">did anyone ever try the NPC who crushes gems for quests?<br/>
might be worth looking into if not...<br/>
<br/>
Xillitil/Povar(who would try if he had a diamond and wasn&#39;t too low level to <br/>
advance tinkering anyway...stupid level caps)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I&#39;ve been looking for the Diamond Dust also... looked everywhere from LGukk<br/>
&gt;to OOT over to Dagnors Cauldron and up on the Plane of Hate and found<br/>
&gt;nothing... not even a rumor of it.  If anyone finds it, please send it out<br/>
&gt;to the list.  Even rumors we can follow up on.  Oh and I checked Sol A also<br/>
&gt;in the gnome area over there and found nothing.<br/>
