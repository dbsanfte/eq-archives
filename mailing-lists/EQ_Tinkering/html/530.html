<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282111324">You know I thought of that, so I went and hunted him and I think all he had<br/>
was some leather armor or something.  His name is Feddi Dooger.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
that he sometimes carries a lore item knife of some sort, but I wasn&#39;t able<br/>
to get one and couldn&#39;t find any mention of the knife anywhere in ak&#39;anon.<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me, has any tried doing anything with the gnomes in the mino<br/>
caves?  They never seem to respond to anything I say.  What are they doing<br/>
down there anyway?<br/>

&gt; There is some insane guy in the hills that kills certain PCs and then<br/>
&gt; mutters something about the madness.  I haven&#39;t run into him since I was<br/>
&gt; level 12 or so, though I have tried to find him to kill or talk to now<br/>
&gt; that I could whoop his ass. </span></blockquote></div>
