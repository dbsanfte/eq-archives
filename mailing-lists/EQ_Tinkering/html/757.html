&gt; Comet quest in a little shack surrounded by ice bones. From there take a<br/>
&gt; left I think and hug the right wall and you&#39;ll see him, a guy named<br/>
&gt; Mc&lt;something&gt; standing next to a little goblin diver. I think he was a<br/>
&gt; barbarian or human, but did not get close at all. In any case he conned red<br/>
&gt; at L29 and was aggro to my usually-lovable agnostic barbarian warrior. I<br/>
&gt; have heard rumor that he is L35. I have never heard of him being killed, so<br/>
&gt; cannot say what he drops; not many people even seem to know he exists. I<br/>
&gt; doubt that he is related to tinkering, but would be a fun fight so go kill<br/>
&gt; him anyway &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
