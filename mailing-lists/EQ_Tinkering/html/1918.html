<div id="ygrps-yiv-63018766">While wandering about the Rathe Mountains last night I happened upon a small<br/>
hut, where inside seemed to live a dwarf and a gnome.  The dwarf babbled<br/>
some dribbel about dragonscale cloaks and armour, but the gnome had a much<br/>
more interesting story to tell.  He told me he was in the jewelling<br/>
business, and that he had mastered a unique gem cutting technique.  He asked<br/>
me if I needed a stone [cut] or if I needed some jewelry [repaired].  After<br/>
inquiring about how he was cutting these gems, he told me that he could do<br/>
it yes, but only to rare or exceptional stones, and asked me what kind of<br/>
stone I had.  I lied, I told him I had every stone I had ever heard of, from<br/>
malachite to black sky diamonds, but he did not seem interested in and of<br/>
these.  I asked him all about his repair services, and he told me that for a<br/>
small fee he would repair a piece of jewelry, but that this was more of a<br/>
hobby of his and would not comment further on it.<br/>
<br/>
This gnome went by the name of Darfumple Zirubbel, his location in the Rathe<br/>
Mountains is about 5000, 900 (both positive).  Perhaps you can garner more<br/>
information from him, and learn his gemcutting techniques.<br/>
