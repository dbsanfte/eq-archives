<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-583217917">I failed on my two attempts to make a mechanized lockpick<br/>
(I only had 2 lockpicks).  Expensive failures.<br/>
I know I had the right items thanks to Gnomad&#39;s research.  <br/>
I was sadden to discover it was no longer publically accessable.<br/>
<br/>
I remember seeing at EQVault that Tinkerer Fulcrum had <br/>
recently opened his library, but other than a quick summary <br/>
visit, I didn&#39;t have time to read it all in one sitting.<br/>
<br/>
I searched through the archives here and found the reference again:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/eqtinker">http://www.geocities.com/eqtinker</a>  <br/>
(I added it into the EQ_Gnomes community links also).<br/>
<br/>
I checked the research notes on the Failed Thermal Cloak Recipes <br/>
and have some ideas of my own to throw out.  Time to Prattle.<br/>
<br/>
from Gimblestan XV <br/>
&quot;The Firewater flask, carefully positioned on my belt, causes<br/>
no hindrance to my movement, and the Metal Rods sewn in to the<br/>
Tattered Gnomish Cloak conduct the heat well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A small patchwork cloak has been described as tattered, <br/>
but would the Thermal Cloak have the same class and/or <br/>
race/size restrictions?<br/>
<br/>
Cloth capes are open to all, but there is still the size issue.<br/>
<br/>
Raw Silk is Caster/Monk restricted however One size does fit all!<br/>
<br/>
While Meditating, I contemplated that &quot;on my belt&quot; may mean a Belt Pouch!<br/>
Upto 4 Firewater flasks would make it very very warm for chilly bones.<br/>
Alas I have a feeling that no amount of stuffing will allow one to fit <br/>
in either a sewing kit nor the toolbox, but I still wonder if it could <br/>
be part of the final formula. /Shrug<br/>
<br/>
I am far from being a language scholar, but taken literally <br/>
as past discoveries have proven:<br/>
&quot;The Firewater Flask&quot; would be just one - we hope.<br/>
&quot;Metal Rods&quot; would imply there is more than one, <br/>
             just a guess as to how many.  <br/>
<br/>
I am a beginning tailor so the reference to &#39;sewn&#39; does make one <br/>
ponder about adding rods with pelts and patterns.<br/>
Would Tinkering really require other than our toolboxes?<br/>
Yes, Yes, Tailored cloaks, but only Bom Knowtood in the <br/>
Steamfont Mills sells the needed rods.  /shutter at the thought of...<br/>
<br/>
Funny how the Collapsable Fishing pole required three rods<br/>
when the research from Tinkerer Rotgut McDougle notes<br/>
didn&#39;t reflect anyone using that many with Gnomish bolts...<br/>
