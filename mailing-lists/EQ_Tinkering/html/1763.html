<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001668073">Heres the name of that 25th level High elf  enchanter who won&#39;t Share the <br/>
location of the diamond dust on Fennin Ro due to sheer greed    &quot; GLENIN &quot;  <br/>
.... I told him that now that the word is out that he knows when he blurted <br/>
it out that he had it openly ....he wont be left alone by every Tinkerer in  <br/>
that server till its location is known..... He still doesnt care ....So good <br/>
luck if you can get him to talk i sure would love to know so when i am able <br/>
to tinker that level i could know where to get the components <br/>
too........Sincerely Cloverleaf Fennin Ro Server</div>
