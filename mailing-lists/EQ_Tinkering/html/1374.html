level 50!  Muahahaha...  No skill caps here =)<br/>

Anyway, I hit skill 102 tonight, tried 8 lungs, made<br/>

&gt; I petitioned again about  it but the only one i got<br/>
&gt; an anwser from  was an aprentice guide. And you all <br/>
&gt;  know how much they can help you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But he thought that when they fix it we are gonna<br/>
&gt; see a msg about it, so keep on petition about this<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just read that the patch that was supposed to be<br/>
&gt; this morning was actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; already done.  They did it when the servers were<br/>
&gt; down with that Cerfnet and<br/>
&gt; &gt; UUnet trouble.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone<br/>
&gt; has tried the tinkering<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill since the patch to see if the skill cap (I<br/>
&gt; think it was (Level - 15) x<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5) has been fixed yet.  I had been hoping that<br/>
&gt; they would fix it in this<br/>
&gt; &gt; patch after someone reported that a GM said they<br/>
&gt; should be fixing it soon,<br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe even in the next patch.  If anyone knows if<br/>
&gt; you can Tinker outside the<br/>
&gt; &gt; level cap now please say so =)<br/>
