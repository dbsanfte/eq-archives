<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156560515"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The question is: if somebody walks up to you and<br/>
&gt; says &quot;heres all the parts, please combine those for me. if you fail,<br/>
&gt; no worrys.&quot; would you do it?  Or would you charge them for the 30sec<br/>
&gt; it takes to hit combine.  You didn&#39;t spend any cash on the item, and<br/>
&gt; if its not a triv item, then your gaining skill (possibly) for free<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unless they were a guildmate then yes, I would charge them - I spent a lot of<br/>
time, effort and money getting my tinkering skill to where it is, and people<br/>
like this hypothetical person you mention who wan&#39;t the quick reward with none<br/>
of the effort annoy me. No, I&#39;m not charging them for the 30sec combine, I&#39;m<br/>
charging them for the hours I spent combining items over and over to get a skill<br/>
increase.<br/>
