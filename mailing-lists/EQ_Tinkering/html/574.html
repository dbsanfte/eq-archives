<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-326883061">I&#39;ve been a subscriber to the list for quite a while, but must have missed <br/>
this part.  I understand that the main topic right now is finding combos for <br/>
the fishing pole, but I wanted to get off topic real quick.  So, my goal is <br/>
to make compasses for my guild and I was wondering is there any place to buy <br/>
pie tins?  I&#39;ve mastered pottery just to make them, but it would be soooo <br/>
handy just to be able to buy them.  Anyone know?<br/>
<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
