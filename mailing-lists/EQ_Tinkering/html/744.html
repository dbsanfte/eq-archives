<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381286476">You are right. Lindell does have two l&#39;s I wasn&#39;t sure how to spell it <br/>
though. Good workj though. I&#39;m going to try to question him, hoping to <br/>
change his mind. Anyone have some good (but not rude) arguments I can use <br/>
when I present my &quot;speech&quot; to him?<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Hey I was in qeynos with my gnome today and I saw a Lindell (2 L&#39;s) but I<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t ask about the pole because like someone said, it might not be a good<br/>
&gt;idea to scare him off. He was only on for a bit (at least i only saw him <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;a bit) he was talking to a friend whos name I forget and said he was gonna<br/>
&gt;go play his gnome. So he does have a gnome char and his name spelling is<br/>
&gt;Lindell. thats all I know. if its the same lindel/lindell.. Sorry i dont<br/>
&gt;know more<br/>
&gt;<br/>
