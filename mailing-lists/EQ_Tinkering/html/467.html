<div id="ygrps-yiv-631953301">I sent an email to verant explaining our plight. So far I&#39;ve gotten a <br/>
responce from someone who said they forwarded it to who he thinks (yes, <br/>
thinks) is the programmer that handles the trade skills. If you guys want to <br/>
see the actual email I sent and the replies, just say so and I&#39;ll post em. <br/>
I&#39;m sure someone else could have sent a better or more intricate email, but <br/>
I got tired and just wrote it and sent it out.<br/>
