<b>Subject:</b> Bertoxx tinkering prices <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-975655159">Well I am willing to agree to a selling price on Bertoxx, but I am dubious<br/>
that this price fixing will hold for very long.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe its my faction with the merchants but at 7pp i am just making a profit<br/>
off of the poles themselves.  I think we should shoot for something closer<br/>
to 10pp for the poles... maybe 8 or 9pp.  The spyglass should be expensive.<br/>
75pp seems like the right price, :)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s to making a profit off of a trade skill for a change!<br/>
