<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206931716">As far as it goes the person that is 27 with skill of 65 that shows that<br/>
the math of (level-15) *5 is wrong, and if there still is a  cap which I<br/>
hope there isn&#39;t then, the only one that is stated other then the one<br/>
metioned was diabloklr and it was (level *5) - 13 which is the only opther<br/>
one metioned. I think it may be it but I also disagre with the formuala . I<br/>
can think of no other formuala in the game that uses this, and the math does<br/>
seem consistant but we will see. But I agree with Diabloklr on one thing it<br/>
is at least not (level-15) *5. Hey guys this is a thread on Tinkering lets<br/>
figure out what this is and see what we can come up with this. Thanks :)<br/>

The funny thing about this response was that it was meant for the other guy<br/>
who says my formula is incorrect.... according to my formula he had yet to<br/>
reach the limit of his skill so kiss off Thank you.</div>
