<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748493396">I think it is much worse than that.  It has been awhile so please excuse me<br/>
if I don&#39;t remember the notation so I&#39;ll do this long hand.  I can look up<br/>
the formula if you want but assuming you can use 2 of any item the one you<br/>
are looking for is sampling with single replacement. The problem isn&#39;t a<br/>
simple factorial problem because in many cases we are allowing items to<br/>
repeat.  So it isn&#39;t 13x12...x6x5 one less for each slot of the box. In many<br/>
of the formulas I see people use two or more ingredients (i.e. 2xmetal rods)<br/>
Assuming that no item is used more than twice but that all items may be used<br/>
up to twice you would end up with a max of<br/>
13x13x12x12x11x11x10x10=294,465,600.  Even if you assume only one component<br/>
can be used twice with up to 8 components with 13 possible choices you get<br/>
13x13x12x11x10x9x8x7=10,221,120<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I think the way you came up with that formula is good. (It must be, because<br/>
&gt;it was what I came up with at first, lol)<br/>
&gt;Problem is it is wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Suppose we have 13 types of items in 100 slots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That gives us 13^100/100! which is less than 1. (Can&#39;t be right.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The other problem I had with it is that it does not produce an integer<br/>
&gt;number. What is 0.3 combinations? </span></blockquote></div>
