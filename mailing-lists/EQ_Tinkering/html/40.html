&gt; I follow the note to Grub n Grob but get stuck there.<br/>
&gt; Two of the lens people say &quot;come back next week&quot;, the<br/>
&gt; third I tried leads me to Freeport.  At the store I<br/>
&gt; ask eveyrone about the dark elf rogue but no one<br/>
&gt; replies, and I can&#39;t find an underground enterance.  I<br/>
&gt; have heard of the name the woman is supposed to be,<br/>
&gt; HOWEVER, she cons red to me and when I approach her<br/>
&gt; about the lens she does nothing.  I believe it to be<br/>
&gt; an unfinished quest.  I heard it was supposed to be<br/>
&gt; part or near the Staff of the Observer (best staff in<br/>
&gt; game for casters) quest...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll try the thermal cloak tonight as well, using<br/>
&gt; leather, cloth, and various other equipment.  I think<br/>
&gt; I decyphered it well enough to get it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, the Observer staff is ANOTHER lens quest, not<br/>
the spare lens one. But the DE in Freeport, I&#39;ve never found.<br/>
I hear that people have found her, killed her and gotten the<br/>
lens. I&#39;m sure I can kill her, but I can&#39;t find her.<br/>
<br/>
The two that say come back? No clue, maybe it has to be done after<br/>
the two Spare lens that are suppose to be there are found.<br/>
One is the freeport elf, which has been found and the other<br/>
is on a Gnome, same last name as the Gnomes that you have<br/>
to ask about the lens, but is found (rarely) in the Mino caves, way back<br/>
in there. Which would be dangerous for me, but near suicide for someone<br/>
level 11 or lower.<br/>
