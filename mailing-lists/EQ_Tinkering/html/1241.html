&gt; I dont know why verant even brought charged items into the game, they are so<br/>
&gt; stupid. There is no way to recharge them so why even use them? Anyone else<br/>
&gt; agree? do a /feedback and join me... Tinkers really got the shaft, 50<br/>
&gt; charges, 1 charge, still the same bullshit, its by far easier to camp HADDEN<br/>
&gt; a 8 hour spawn with a rare drop fishbone earring than to shell out 300+ pp<br/>
 </span></blockquote> You , and the other 200 people that want fishbone earrings, not to<br/>
mention those that don&#39;t care about their faction with the barbies...<br/>
(some of us do) and so will kill him repeatedly to sell off the<br/>
earrings... think 300pp is unreasonable, try buying that fishbone<br/>
earrings , all I have to say is good luck.<br/>
