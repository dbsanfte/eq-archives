<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865168056">It has a weight of 10? (monks and/or us frail gnomes will hate that)<br/>
<br/>
Its components cost around 225pp. Since its trivial for basically no one,<br/>
you have to count on a 3x multiplier for a sale price to survive. That 675pp<br/>
selling price (typically failure rates of non-trivials I&#39;ve seen to run about <br/>
2.5x cost). In other words, you succeed once every 2.5 times (total estimate,<br/>
just what I&#39;ve seen).<br/>
<br/>
It has 50 charges - thats 13.5 plat per use, if you can sell it for 2x the<br/>
cost then its 9 plat per use.<br/>
<br/>
Does it have to be worn? (doubt it just asking).<br/>
<br/>
Magicians might be able to summon a stone that provides 2 charges of<br/>
Enduring breath.<br/>
<br/>
Everytime I auction tinkered items, I get tons of tells asking about these<br/>
things. What can I say? <br/>
<br/>
Rebreathers make me shudder. Whats the going price on the fishbone earring?<br/>
The estimate on rebreather is what? 750pp for components alone? That makes<br/>
a minimum selling price of 1500pp? and thats IF they&#39;re every trivial? (they<br/>
changed jewelry so platinum is never trivial.. I wouldnt be surprised to see<br/>
that here).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I dont mean to be a downer. I&#39;m really into Tinkering but I was sorta<br/>
devoting (lots) of time and (lots) of money into raising my skill mostly to<br/>
make these things. I&#39;m a bit discouraged.  Please all you tinkering masters!<br/>
What do YOU think?</div>
