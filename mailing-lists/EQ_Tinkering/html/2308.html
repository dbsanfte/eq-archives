<br/>
He cons amiable.  But whenever I try to talk to him, he says:<br/>
Forpar Fizfla says &#39;Get out you pesky Gnome!  I don&#39;t need any Gnome germs! <br/>
Out, ye filthy beast! <br/>
<br/>
Gnome germs?<br/>
<br/>
The good thing is that he protects newbies.  His aggro radius extends well<br/>
outside the windmill, and he has a quick reaction time.  Just running a mob<br/>
behind the windmill is enough to make him jump out and kill it.</div>
