<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-557979434">Actually on the thought that someone said the gm claimed all the information <br/>
was at the mills, I coaxed a lvl 49 druid to take out all of the npc&#39;s at the <br/>
mills even the merchents for me as I healed him with my druid 8)  they were <br/>
very tough and we had to zone once as things went awry and we were both <br/>
attacked by the guard there, they dropped nothing... nothing at all.... I <br/>
cried that night... hard thinking I might have our answer and then come up <br/>
empty.  However, I have never seen Feddie Dooger and dont know about him..... <br/>
 charlotte was tough but not as tough as the npc with the elemental pet... he <br/>
was nasty .... just so we can rule out a drop,  unless it is a rare drop.  <br/>
That my friends would suk.</div>
