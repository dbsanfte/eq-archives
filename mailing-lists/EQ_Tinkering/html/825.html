<div id="ygrps-yiv-204652438">You know I thought of that once, but a long time ago when I was a newbie, I<br/>
remember trying to hail her and accidentally hitting the attack key and<br/>
ended up killing her.  :)  She didn&#39;t drop anything.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t now what he drops but there is another lower level gnome npc that<br/>
&gt; stands near the path in front of the windmills. You get a faction hit for<br/>
&gt; killing her against gnomes and she cons blue to me at 9. Anyone kill her<br/>
&gt; recently? And if so what loot does that one have. </span></blockquote></div>
