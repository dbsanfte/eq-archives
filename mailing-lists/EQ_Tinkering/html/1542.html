<b>Subject:</b> 5 books!?! Where are 3 & 4?! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-297138444">Pardon my late arrival on the scene of this mailing list but I am curious <br/>
if someone can confirm the whereabouts of the 3rd and 4th books refered to <br/>
in some earlier posts. I have been out of EQ until recently when someone <br/>
brought to my attention that there were additions made to Tinkering. I <br/>
stepped back in and have been at it for some 3 weeks now.. but can&#39;t find <br/>
any new books put into the game on Tinkering. I would LOVE someone&#39;s help <br/>
with books 3&4, or just a new list of items and components required.<br/>
