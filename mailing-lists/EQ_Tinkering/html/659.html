<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564039519">Research for Casters works the same way.  If so, Tinkering becomes more like<br/>
fishing, begging, and research (in that it has a level cap) than like the other<br/>
&quot;Trade&quot; skills - Tailoring, baking, pottery, etc.  This makes no sense and<br/>
(again, if true) may be a bug.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I made 8 Cams in a row with out anything.. not counting the two lockpicks<br/>
&gt; &gt;and about 40 - 50 lanterns.  Told a guide I was bugged, told me to stop<br/>
&gt; &gt;bugging him.. sigh...<br/>

&gt; It seems to me that it depends greatly on your experience level.  At level<br/>
&gt; 27 I was only able to raise tinkering to 60.  The skill does not take dozens<br/>
&gt; and dozens of attempts to raise.  If it doesn&#39;t go up after 20, it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; going up til you level.  So far, it seems that you can only learn one point<br/>
&gt; per level til 28, then 5 points per level after that.  I am level 30 now,<br/>
&gt; and I will try to get past 75 to see if one can gain more than 5 points per<br/>
&gt; level.<br/>
