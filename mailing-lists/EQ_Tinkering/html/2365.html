<div id="ygrps-yiv-457360489">yeah, but at what levels does this start happening? i mean cmon.<br/>
<br/>
Im a 34 enchanter, and i cant even come CLOSE that 10-15kpp or even have a<br/>
dream of it.<br/>
<br/>
The only things i know that drop decent play are Hill Gisnts in Rathe, and<br/>
they are too high a level for me to Solo effectively.<br/>
<br/>
does it start at 40? what about 50?<br/>
<br/>
cause i know that 50 is at least 2-3 months away for me, which is sad =(<br/>

&gt; Ok i have a question. how in the world are you all getting multi-thousands<br/>
&gt; of platinum?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the most ive ever owned is 2250pp at one time, and that was after<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; LOT of saving...<br/>
<br/>
As you get higher and higher in level, the plat comes easier.<br/>
<br/>
There are things you can kill or camp to get money, or things that can sell<br/>
for money, either to players or merchants.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that if I don&#39;t worry about it, my bank account seems to do a<br/>
good job of increasing on its own.<br/>
