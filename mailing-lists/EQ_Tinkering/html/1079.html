<div id="ygrps-yiv-115695398">Hello everyone I have been on this list now for about month just watching <br/>
hoping something good would come up.  Well the new recipes kick ass, even a <br/>
lvl 12 can tinkering most of em.  :P  Anyways last night I was messaging a <br/>
couple tinkers on Xegony who had been bothering my friend becuase he had a <br/>
collapsable fishing pole.  They said that they should be the only ones who <br/>
knew how to do it and called him a cheater and a whole bunch of other stuff. <br/>
  Anyway while I was talking to them I found out this is their price list:<br/>
5pp for fireworks(Not sure there worth that much)<br/>
50pp stalking probe<br/>
15pp fishing pole<br/>
100pp Spyglass<br/>
Also when I inquired where they got the book from they wouldn&#39;t tell me <br/>
exactly but they did tell me that it was a very high quest.  It took a lvl <br/>
47 warrior to complete the quest.  Also I found out that the quest is not in <br/>
Akanon but I didn&#39;t ask about Steamfont.  Well that&#39;s all the info I have <br/>
for right now.  Happy questing. :)<br/>
