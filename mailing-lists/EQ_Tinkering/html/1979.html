<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078649942">Or possibly cutter, (Pattern of some sort), gem and bar of metal, or taking<br/>
into account D. Smiths post, it could be that you have to use a finished<br/>
piece of jewelry, then maybe it could be jewelry, grease, cutter, (possibly<br/>
a pattern).<br/>
<br/>
I have always wandered why the jewelry bag had four slots, and this seems<br/>
like the best reason I have seen yet.  Also, it&#39;s been a long time, but I<br/>
can almost swear that I once saw a scroll or parchment being sold by a<br/>
merchant that was titled bear pattern.  Maybe I&#39;m imagining it, or maybe it<br/>
was for something else, who knows. I would like to see a good listing of<br/>
tried attempts. If gnomes on all of the servers were able to coordinate<br/>
their attempts, we would probably be able to zero in on the answer rather<br/>
quickly while minimizing cost.<br/>

    Yes,  but the format for any jewelry is one bar of metal and one gem....<br/>
    never anything more than 2 items... this could be why the jewel kit has<br/>
4<br/>
    slots.... cutter, grease, gem, bar of metal<br/>
