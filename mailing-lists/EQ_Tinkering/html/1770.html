		Fellow Tinkers,<br/>
<br/>
		I come before you with open arms and open log books<br/>
		to report the history of my tinkering.  Please<br/>
		forgive my verbosity for I am a quiet tinkering<br/>
		gnome wizard that spends much time muttering to<br/>
		himself. :o)<br/>
<br/>
		I made each of the following in order until it went<br/>
		trivial.  Flameless Lanterns, Standard Bow Cams,<br/>
		Spyglasses, and finally Stalking Probes.  This of<br/>
		course got me to 102 skill.  At no point did I<br/>
		attempt an item until every lesser item was<br/>
		trivial.<br/>
<br/>
		On a side note, I have always sold Spyglasses for<br/>
		80pp and have sold well over 100 of them but lost<br/>
		count.  I&#39;ve sold 18 in a night before.  I have<br/>
		firmly established 80pp as the going rate on Povar<br/>
		through endless auctioning in all manner of zones,<br/>
		be it newbie, mid-level, or LGuk/SolB.  Spyglasses<br/>
		are a great way to help finance Aqualung attempts.<br/>
<br/>
		/auction Selling tinkered Spyglass with unlimited<br/>
		charges of Telescope (like binoculars).  Great for<br/>
		pullers!  80pp.  Use it to spot that rare wandering<br/>
		spawn!<br/>

		/auction Selling tinkered Spyglass with unlimited<br/>
		charges of Telescope (like binoculars).  Great for<br/>
		pullers!  80pp.  Use it to spot naked newbies!<br/>
<br/>
		etc.<br/>
<br/>
		Of the below Aqualungs, I painfully, over many<br/>
		weeks, sold all of the first 30 I produced.  I<br/>
		charged 500pp for each and barely covered costs.<br/>
<br/>
		/auction Selling a tinkered Aqualung with 50<br/>
		charges of waterbreathing (half hour RL each) for<br/>
		500pp (merchant pays 190pp, so 310pp net). To<br/>
		compare, 50 EB potions costs 600pp and do not<br/>
		stack!  Declare your independence from EB casters!<br/>
		Support the trades!<br/>

		scales!<br/>
<br/>
		etc.<br/>
<br/>
		When tinkering Aqualungs, I got a wis suit from<br/>
		a plat level enchanter friend.  I would get these<br/>
		buffs from a 44+ enchanter (/who all enc 44 50):<br/>
		wis/int/str/cha.  Since I am a wizard, I could<br/>
		go to them while being bound at the tinkering<br/>
		merchant or the Ak&#39;Anon bank as the mood struck.<br/>
		I would replace int gear with wis gear until my<br/>
		int (with buff) was 199 and my wis was 132.  I<br/>
		never bought or sold with a cha less than 100.  By<br/>
		the way, cha over 100 is the same as cha 100.<br/>
		Also, pay a plat and get a SoW...speeds things up.<br/>

		* Was trivial on the 3rd try of this batch.<br/>
<br/>
		After the first 30 successes were sold, I sold<br/>
		my Runed Cowl for fort knox to a level 50 wizard<br/>
		and converted all the items into cash.  Along<br/>
		with what I already had, this got me a nestegg<br/>
		of 17kpp.  I did the last 180 tries of Aqualungs<br/>
		by selling the successes back to the merchant.<br/>
		This cost me 12.5kpp to reach the trivial point.<br/>
		If anyone on Povar has a spare Runed Cowl, I<br/>
		would be very thankful. :o)<br/>
<br/>
		Given that my cost-with-failures per Aqualung is<br/>
		now 270pp, Rebreathers are 966pp per try.  I will<br/>
		now charge the public 400pp per Aqualung.  The<br/>
		Rebreather will cost the public 3000pp or trade<br/>
		equivalent.<br/>
<br/>
		Given just those prices, 7.5 Aqualungs can be<br/>
		bought for the price on one Rebreather.  That&#39;s<br/>
		187.5 RL hours under water.  And that doesn&#39;t<br/>
		count the fact that the Aqualung, once used, can<br/>
		be sold to a merchant for some plats to help buy<br/>
		even more Aqualungs for the same net cost as the<br/>
		Rebreather.<br/>
<br/>
		There&#39;s no question in my mind that the Aqualung<br/>
		is a much more economical solution and the<br/>
		Rebreather is just nice for those people with too<br/>
		much money.  To put the final nail in the coffin,<br/>
		Aqualungs can be activated from the inventory<br/>
		but Rebreathers must be worn in the head slot.<br/>
		For the average caster with a Runed Cowl or tank<br/>
		with a massive helm, this is a real pain.<br/>
<br/>
		Finally, I thought I&#39;d share my broader trade<br/>
		skill experience.<br/>
