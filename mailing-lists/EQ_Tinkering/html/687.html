<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221196522">Here, as I promised is a full report of not only what information I posess, <br/>
but what I discovered by applying it (which currently is not much, <br/>
unfortunately). First, I will tell you exactly HOW I came upon the <br/>
information as well as some other things, then I will tell you what my <br/>
search yeilded.<br/>
<br/>
First, it was long ago, on this very list that one person said something <br/>
about a monk. He said the the monk named Lindel on the Veeshan server seemed <br/>
to know more thta he let&#39;s on. No one payed much mind to the statement, but <br/>
I figured &quot;Heck, I play on the Veeshan, so I can check it out, see if he <br/>
does know anything&quot;. I added him to my friends list and checked if he was on <br/>
all the time. He didn&#39;t come on for a long time, but then he did. I very <br/>
politely asked if he knew anything about the collapsible fishing pole, and a <br/>
lagre conversation ensuded. I led on that I had spent much time searching <br/>
for the pole, and it&#39;s secret. (I know it was a lie, but I didn&#39;t want to <br/>
just demand the information) I told him that I would tell no one, and begged <br/>
it from him. He told me that he couldn&#39;t tell me, and I asked him why. He <br/>
said that only he and other &quot;members of the mark&quot; knew about it. He said <br/>
they were a small group of friends that knew the secret. I asked him if I <br/>
could join the mark, but he said that they approach YOU about joining, not <br/>
the other way around. I think the the mark, as he called it, it probably a <br/>
&quot;secret&quot; group of people, not bound by any guild name. They might be even an <br/>
inter-server group. I begged and pushed him more, telling him that I had <br/>
searched forever, and deserved at least a hint. I told him that I had <br/>
searched the world over many times. Then he said something to the effect of: <br/>
&quot;You have searched the world over, but have you searched it below?&quot; He then <br/>
went to further say: &quot;Search beneath the waves.&quot;<br/>
This I though, could be the break we needed, now we don&#39;t have to search <br/>
totaly aimlessly. I doubt that he was lying, too, the way we went about the <br/>
conversation, I belive he was giving true hints.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I will tell what I came up with. The first part of the clue he said to <br/>
search underground, basically. Ak&#39;Anon is underground, so that was the first <br/>
place to come to mind, because it also had a lake, which would justify the <br/>
&quot;Search beneath the waves&quot; part, which could also mean the oceans, or other <br/>
bodies of water, but for now, I wanted to stick with Ak&#39;Anon. I figured that <br/>
there could be some sort of secret entrance, a fake wall leading into a <br/>
hidden cave or something. I finally got back to Ak&#39;Anon tonight and search <br/>
around a bit. Altough my search was not thuroughly extensive, I did find <br/>
something VERY VERY interesting (altough it wasn&#39;t in the water). I found, <br/>
on the ground, an item called An old silver coin. It looked like a normal <br/>
silver coin, but it was an actual item. The strangest thing, though was that <br/>
it was a MAGIC ITEM, a LORE ITEM, AND...NO DROP! But wait! Items that are no <br/>
drop can&#39;t be on the ground, but that was where I found it. SO! It must be a <br/>
quest item, an item that spawned, not something dropped by another player. I <br/>
think that it may be related to something we are looking for. For now, <br/>
though, we should all have our very own old silver coins. I found it in the <br/>
room with the ater wheel, on the other side of the bridge on the high cliff <br/>
above the scrap yard with the Syford Montop guy. It was next to one ofthose <br/>
rotating little star thingies. One without a stand. Hope you can all find <br/>
one, so that we can have more and see about what they might be used for.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think we should all try to brainstorm about what Lindels clues might <br/>
have meant. Well now that you have it, my information, feel free to make <br/>
comments and add ideas. For now, I must part. Good luck, friends.<br/>
