<b>Subject:</b> Re: Tinkering skill increase <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-401947443">I went ahead and talked to a gm and a bunch of higher level gnomes.  From <br/>
the high levels gnomes I got the impression that tinkering was a complete <br/>
and total waste of time.  In fact one told me he didn&#39;t do it because the <br/>
skill sucked and it wasn&#39;t worth it.  I did get a name from a high level <br/>
gnome who said he knew someone who used to tinker a lot.  He said the guys <br/>
name was salvadori or something like that and that he rarely came on.  He <br/>
does however come on every once in a while.  The other thing that I found <br/>
out, from the gm&#39;s, was that the skill is not broken.  I asked every gm that <br/>
has been on for the past two nights and they all keep telling me it&#39;s not <br/>
broken.  Well that&#39;s my search so far.<br/>
