<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021694835">you are forgetting one thing...the Gnome in the Inn in Rathe Mtns. he will <br/>
&quot;cut&quot; jewels of exceptional quality...&lt;cough&gt; diamond &lt;cough&gt;. how do you <br/>
think &quot;dust&quot; is gotten? i wouldnt waste time with the ogres...go to the <br/>
gnome. let him cut a diamond for you...at the very least you will have a <br/>
diamond that is cut..(prolly worth more) and perhaps even get dust as a <br/>
side...or maybe the gnome is an npc who is programmed to screw up the <br/>
cutting...hence creating dust. just my 2cp.<br/>
