<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936490710">Hmm ive heard that to but i talk to a friend on the pvp server and he says <br/>
he seen the finished product.    I dont think he was making it up casue he <br/>
confronted me about tinkering and asked if i new how to make one.  Also ive <br/>
been to a few web sittes that kinda talk about it.  Its mentioned that there <br/>
is a third componet to combine to make this staff.  To bad they wouldnt say, <br/>
also the priest discord has that black robe.   When i first started i thought <br/>
it was just for show but the higher i get in levels i starting to see other <br/>
people wear this robe.  You can get that robe in a dungeon.   I also tried to <br/>
combine the skull and rune totum staff and it tells me that they dont <br/>
combine.</div>
