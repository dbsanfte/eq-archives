Its sad to know that most tinkered items are all but useless (compass,<br/>
spyglass, stalking probe, ect ect), but essentially we&#39;re makers of<br/>
&#39;trinkets&#39; that our customers can show off to their friends.  It would be<br/>
VERY easy for verant to make tinkered items with REAL uses, but of course<br/>
that would add to the economy and our pocketbooks and we cant have that now,<br/>
can we?<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;ve petitioned for a tinkerable oven, brewery, pet, flying<br/>
machine, infravision goggles, tinkers bag, and several armour pieces that I<br/>
cant remember what they were.  I&#39;d keep doing this, but presently I am too<br/>
busy /petitioning for &#39;Coin only loot&#39; on RZ (/feedback is a joke, I&#39;d<br/>
rather annoy the guides to the point that THEY start suggesting it).... yes<br/>
yes flame me out PKs.  I think tinkering is a money sink but I&#39;ve heard that<br/>
there may be money to be made on higher level items... even though once<br/>
rebreathers are trivial there is no way to improve beyond that YET.  Cross<br/>
your fingers for the expantion.  I&#39;m hoping for some more underwater<br/>
dungeons myself, not to mention more tinker-able items.<br/>
