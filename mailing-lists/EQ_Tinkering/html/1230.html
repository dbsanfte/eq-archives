<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277232484">I havent made one yet tho i can connect at all since yesterday :-(((. But if you have made an Observer staff any time you know itï¿½s the same with that, when you get it it had 50 charges if you dropp it on the ground or trade it it resets to 1. Tho in this case i dont mind ppl will trade the lens instead of the staff if they are after the staff for the spell, most ppl arent tho. But in the case with the aqua lung it must be a bug. We need to petition about this and do it fast !!!<br/>

&gt; Hi Folks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I know for sure that the aqua lung had 50 charges on it when I first made it. After I gave it to a friend, the thing only had a single charge!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone else seen this? Is this a bug or a feature!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ack.<br/>
