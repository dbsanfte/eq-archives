<div id="ygrps-yiv-545405856"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lukas@...">lukas@...</a><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the above fellow for <br/>
maintaining the tinkering web page.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;FACT: The spyglass needs a collapsible fishing pole to make.  I &gt;should <br/>
&gt;know, I made one :P<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do not deny this, and since you have no reason to deceive us, I trust your <br/>
judgement.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;FACT: The collapsible fishing pole is a player made item.  Here&#39;s a &gt;snip <br/>
&gt;right from the everquestmanual.txt:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I snipped the manual text, because I think we are all familiar with it.  I <br/>
do not trust the manual unless it mentions the most basic of information <br/>
however.  Verant has shown that they were not prepared to release their <br/>
product when they did, and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me in their editing of code, <br/>
items, and zones, that they inadvertantly removed either the information for <br/>
making the fishing pole, or the ability to make them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hmm what ever happend to the fireworks BTW?  Probably in the same &gt;book as <br/>
&gt;the firewater and collapsible pole :P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In any case, its in there but we haven&#39;t found it yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that fireworks were mentioned only as a marketing ploy, and not <br/>
actually put into the game.  I hope someone dispels this thought, because it <br/>
would make my year to please others with free fireworks shows.  Of course, I <br/>
doubt the are implemented because the game engine wouldn&#39;t be able to handle <br/>
that kind of complex graphics, without seriously taxing the client computer. <br/>
  My 128meg RAM, 32meg video RAM computer still bogs down with lots of <br/>
entities in view (players, mobs, corpses, etc), and fireworks would be an <br/>
enormous amount of entities to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Some newly found info: The spyglass sells to merchants for exactly &gt;16pp. <br/>
&gt;By comparison, I get 8gp/1.6pp flameless lantern, <br/>
&gt; &gt;9.6pp/15ppcams,12pp/18.4pp for stalking probes and lockpicks.  This &gt;is <br/>
&gt;with a Bristlebane Rogue with a 60cha and indifferent /con.  In &gt;that case <br/>
&gt;the pole could cost 4-8pp to make (ballpark figure). Keep &gt;in mind that the <br/>
&gt;sell back price ISN&#39;T always directly related to &gt;component costs.  Pie tin <br/>
&gt;patch comes to mind...<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am glad this information was compiled, and does show at least some <br/>
progress towards feasible pole solutions.  I suspect that no trade skill <br/>
item will sell more than the components were purchased for ever again.  The <br/>
pie tin patch made it evident that Verant does not want players to make a <br/>
profit simply by manufacturing their own items and selling them to mindless <br/>
mobs.<br/>
<br/>
I welcome all comments about any thoughts I have put forth, because I only <br/>
have about 3 months experience with Everquest, and only about 3 weeks <br/>
experience making almost 100 flameless lanterns with no skill increase.<br/>
