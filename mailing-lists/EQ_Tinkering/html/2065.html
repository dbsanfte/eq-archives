&lt;&lt; Whenever i&#39;m low on cash i just go bak to sf and load <br/>
 up. As for newboes getting killed the garud killers usually helpem. &gt;&gt;<br/>

In my opinion, the problem is what you said earlier: it makes it that much <br/>
easier to get items/cash...it&#39;s obviously really hurting the economy...soon <br/>
plat won&#39;t be valuable to anyone, for the same reasons it is worthless to <br/>
higher levels. The entire reason guard killers don&#39;t loot the plat is because <br/>
they don&#39;t need it...while that&#39;s ok for them. But &quot;newbies&quot; shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
able to gain plat so easily. At level 5, it takes about 30 minutes to earn a <br/>
plat, but with guard killing it takes 5 seconds to earn 4 plat. . .<br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>
