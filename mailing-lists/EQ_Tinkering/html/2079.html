<div id="ygrps-yiv-542355104">Had an interesting conversation about a week or two ago with a female bard<br/>
on the Karana server by the name of Cleff. She was level 8 or so, and<br/>
claimed to have a level 48 Gnome Wizard with an almost 200 TInkering Skill.<br/>
This person in particular started publicly (in AUCTION and OOC) berating me<br/>
for trying to sell Spyglasses for 80pp, or Mechanical Lockpicks for 50pp.<br/>
She stated that another level 50 Gnome Tinkerer on the Karana server was<br/>
selling those items for half that price and I was giving tinkerers a BAD<br/>
NAME. After I started giving the person tells asking why she was trying to<br/>
ruin me financially (which is what she was doing), she gave me a tell back<br/>
saying my prices where ridiculous even for a person trying to recover costs.<br/>
I was &quot;price gouging&quot; and &quot;trying to rip people off&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Here comes the interesting bit. She claimed to have a primary character that<br/>
was a level 48 Gnome WIzard, who had an almost 200 Tinkering skill. AND she<br/>
stated that it only cost her 400PP to get it up to 200 ! ! ! HOW in THE HELL<br/>
is this ACCOMPLISHED?! Am I the only person who thinks this number is just<br/>
impossible? 400pp barely covers the cost of 2 Aqualungs, much less Cams and<br/>
Spyglasses etc etc to get the skill 100... much less OVER 100 ! Has anyone<br/>
else run across a person making such FRIVILOUS claims?<br/>
<br/>
She stated that she was best friends with two of the prominent highlevel<br/>
tinkerers on the Server (Knok, and Thinktink), and that THIS mailing list<br/>
was &quot;total bullshit&quot; (and I quote). The mailing list was full of newbie<br/>
geeks who only wanted recipes for tinkering items and wheren&#39;t smart enough<br/>
to look it up on the web.<br/>
<br/>
Please anyone else on Karana who reads this, respond. Let me know if you&#39;ve<br/>
met this person also. She/He is give us a REAL bad name.<br/>
