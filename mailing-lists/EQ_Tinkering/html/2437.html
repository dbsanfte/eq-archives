<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466893876">My INT usually hangs around 200-215 as I am a wizard. <br/>
I don&#39;t know about those of you with lesser INT but<br/>
pre-aqualung was pretty easy but now it is getting<br/>
much harder to raise a point.  This is probably just<br/>
due to the fact that I make less because of the absurd<br/>
amount of money each try costs.  Is the going rate on<br/>
Aqualungs still 500pp btw?  I&#39;m having a hard time<br/>
selling these.  Silly people always wait till we can<br/>
make redbreathers but I don&#39;t think they realize we<br/>
need plat from our sales to get that high hehe<br/>

&gt; (i.e. barbarians) <br/>
&gt; out there that say they should be able to learn<br/>
&gt; smithing as easily as <br/>
&gt; someone who is smart but weak.  I didn&#39;t think stats<br/>
&gt; affected success <br/>
&gt; rate, but if anyone has any good experimental data<br/>
&gt; that shows <br/>
&gt; otherwise, I&#39;d like to know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I have found is that when I boost INT up, I<br/>
&gt; have a much better <br/>
&gt; chance in increasing skill.  Duh!  I have tried dex<br/>
&gt; to a small degree <br/>
&gt; and didn&#39;t really notice any difference, but I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t raise it as <br/>
&gt; high as I had raised INT so there might still be<br/>
&gt; some hope.  However, <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think that the learning bonuses are<br/>
&gt; cumulative, but rather <br/>
&gt; affected by your highest stat.  So for most gnomes,<br/>
&gt; it will be <br/>
&gt; easiest to raise INT with regard to practicing<br/>
&gt; tinkering.  I had been <br/>
&gt; raising my int to about 115, but with some borrowed<br/>
&gt; items I raised it <br/>
&gt; fairly easily to around 145.  I didn&#39;t take down any<br/>
&gt; stats, but it <br/>
&gt; did make a noticeable difference.  Keeping track of<br/>
&gt; numbers makes it <br/>
&gt; seem too much like work. :P  But now that I&#39;m into<br/>
&gt; the grownup <br/>
&gt; tinkering things I have to be a little more thrifty<br/>
&gt; with my plat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, my long term goals are to make watchman<br/>
&gt; armor for myself.  <br/>
&gt; Not that I would use it in battle, but it looks like<br/>
&gt; it could freak <br/>
&gt; out some folks.  They already freak out at a gnome<br/>
&gt; warrior.  Wait til <br/>
&gt; they see me running around with those bug eyes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; High Int and Cha are indeed good for the<br/>
&gt; purposes with which you <br/>
&gt; associated<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them, but the only factor that determines your<br/>
&gt; sucess rate is <br/>
&gt; your skill<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Yak has insinuated that there are secondary stats<br/>
&gt; that boost <br/>
&gt; success rate,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but the only one known is str for smithing.  My<br/>
&gt; money would be on <br/>
&gt; dex for<br/>
&gt; &gt; tinkering...<br/>
