<b>Subject:</b> Bag of the Tinkerers <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-735268347">I found this bag available from a merchant in Ak&#39;Anon for 5868plat.  It has<br/>
a capacity of 10 slots.  Anybody know what this is about?<br/>
<br/>
I have seen the bag two different times however it is not there when I just<br/>
checked 5 minutes ago.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately my notes do not specify *which* merchant in Ak&#39;Anon but I<br/>
believe it was in the main square of the city (both times).<br/>
<br/>
There was a quest given by warrior&#39;s guild where you get a 10-slot bag that<br/>
reduces weight of carried items; having not completed this quest I don&#39;t<br/>
know if this is the same bag but in any case I thought that quest gave a NO<br/>
DROP.<br/>
<br/>
Any info appreciated.</div>
