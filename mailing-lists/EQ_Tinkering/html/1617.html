<div id="ygrps-yiv-985664243">I am not insulting anyone, i just got angry when Diablokilr said the got <br/>
pissed off by a guy with a different opinion than his own. I am not saying <br/>
one is right about the skill cap or the other, i have NO idea myself, i <br/>
started working on my skill at lvl 40, am 50 now and only at skill 104.<br/>
<br/>
I just think that getting &quot;pissed off&quot; because someone is doubting your <br/>
information is immature and not necessary in a list like this, and to use <br/>
his &quot;time spent&quot; in the list as an argument to right? well...<br/>
<br/>
Just dont want to see it again :)<br/>
