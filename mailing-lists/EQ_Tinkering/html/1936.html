<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583085343">I think I have killed Toko Binlittle about a dozen times.  Toko is the pirate over by the tent near the Giants and Cyclops right?  If so, then I have indeed killed him about a dozen times, and he never dropped the cloak.  I guess this doesn&#39;t mean that he doesn&#39;t drop it, but if he does it is not a common drop.  Also, I killed him before the last patch.  So, maybe they added it when they added diamond dust.  Don&#39;t know.  I am bound over there; so, I will try to go kill him another 12 to 20 times to see if he drops it.  I&#39;ll report back in about a week.<br/>
