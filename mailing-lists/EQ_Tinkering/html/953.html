<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-168469591">The contents of the Journal of Gimblestan XI has been put up on the<br/>
website, included in it is the plans to make the fireworks and the<br/>
collapsible fishing pole.<br/>
<br/>
I was e-mailed this information last night directly from the person who<br/>
found the book.  One point I want to make clear - he is anonymous and wants<br/>
to remain so to avoid getting swarmed by people asking how/where he got the<br/>
book.  So if you think you know who he is, don&#39;t ask.<br/>
<br/>
BTW Rotgut you can take down the database :)  Anyone who was trying to<br/>
figure out the fishing pole formula, you&#39;re going to be kicking yourself<br/>
when you see how #%$^ close we were. LOL<br/>
