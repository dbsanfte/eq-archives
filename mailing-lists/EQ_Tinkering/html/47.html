&gt; My question is Where do you find the gnome spirits for the fire water (Or<br/>
&gt; does any alcohol work?) and is the Tool box still bugged?  AKA can&#39;t put in<br/>
&gt; bank, drop, trade, etc?  Also does anyone have a listing of what tinkering<br/>
&gt; components there are?  Are the Gizmos and sprockets used?  I travel a lot<br/>
&gt; as a monk and I have never seen ANY other books.  I DO know there are 5<br/>
&gt; volumes to the Alchemy books so maybe there are 5 to the tinkers.  Though<br/>
&gt; the alchemy ones are all in the same place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I want to set up a site on my page for tinkering so am gathering any info<br/>
&gt; on it I can.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In Ak&#39;Anon, near bank. You can get Gnomish Spirits, actually a few other<br/>
places as well. High Pass hold, I THINK had it. Odd that. Toolbox is fixed,<br/>
and<br/>
number of slots has been increased. Gizmos and sprockets aren&#39;t used, well not<br/>
<br/>
gizmos as far as I can tell, but that&#39;s limited information considering there<br/>
are<br/>
books I haven&#39;t seen.<br/>
