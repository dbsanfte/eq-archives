<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I just happened across her and killed her and got that lens. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t however have any of the other ones and now when I ask<br/>
&gt; about the quest I get a message saying you are too high level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard the &quot;come back later&quot; gnomes actually have a lens<br/>
&gt; every so often, but I don&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve never heard anyone<br/>
&gt; who has gotten a lens from them. I always figured I had to be<br/>
&gt; higher level. I left Faydwer for Antonica around level 10 and came<br/>
&gt; back around level 16 and they said I was too powerful now. I guess<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll never be able to join my guild there *g*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I read someone finally got their tinkering skill to go up. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; burnt through about 24 plat of Flameless Lanterns and had nothing<br/>
&gt; go up. Anyone know how long it takes? Is it just luck?<br/>
