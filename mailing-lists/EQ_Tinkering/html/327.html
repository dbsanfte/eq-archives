<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668807929">Those are all good ideas, one I would like to add.  Armor dyeing ... if the <br/>
only use for tinkering ever was armor dyeing I would consider tinkering <br/>
successful.  It would be cool if tanks could bring there armor to us gnomes <br/>
and have us dye it cool colors.  Its kinda sad that the average tank that <br/>
doesn&#39;t play in excess of 1-2 hours a day really doesn&#39;t have much of a <br/>
chance to ever wear red armor or obtain special class armor.  This is off <br/>
subject but one of my favorite things about the old outdated UO was that <br/>
everyone had there own style people could billions of different color <br/>
combinations.  Just my humble opinion on stuff I care about.<br/>
