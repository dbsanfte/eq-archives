<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555024547">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
As it sounds like a lot of Gnomes are now getting into fireworks, I would like<br/>
to pose a question: Has any one figured out how to determine which type of<br/>
firework will be launched?  I&#39;ve had two types go off: flare and explosion.<br/>
It would be great if I knew which one would go off before I used it.  Or<br/>
better yet, if there was some way to determine this at the Tinkering stage.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
