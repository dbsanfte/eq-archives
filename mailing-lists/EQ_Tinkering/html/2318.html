<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205026550">Okay let me clear this rumour up before this gets out of hand.  My<br/>
guildmate Eltanin was asking my advice on his enchanter quest.  After<br/>
looking at the quest text (you: Where is the mechancial pen.  NPC: the<br/>
answer is in your question), I came up with the an idea that the location<br/>
was hidden as an anagram within the word Mechanical Pen.  It looked<br/>
promising as Paineel was the only zone with all it&#39;s letters in Mechanical<br/>
Pen.  With the remaining letters, I came up with Mc&#39;Chanl or Mc&#39;Nulch,<br/>
thinking a barbarian had the pen.  However, this was just a theory and not<br/>
a fact!!!<br/>
<br/>
My theory was proved wrong as the actual quest is finished by giving a SMR<br/>
&lt;gasp&gt; to the chanter NPC in the Mines of Malfucntion.  <br/>
<br/>
So if anyone tells you that the mechanical pen is in Paineel, please<br/>
correct them!  Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I highly doubt that this item is tinkerable since it&#39;s part of the<br/>
FA type quests for chanters.<br/>
<br/>
QdP - who is completely amazed how a theory turned into an assumed fact<br/>
overnight hehe.<br/>

&gt; Anyone heard of a recipe for such a device?  Its may be a component of<br/>
&gt; part <br/>
&gt; of the FA quest for enchanters. Also have heard that it may be an<br/>
&gt; anagram for <br/>
&gt; something in Paineel.<br/>
