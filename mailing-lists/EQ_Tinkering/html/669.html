<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288288388">I petitioned  last night about tinkering, I asked the GM if tinkering was<br/>
broken and he said no, then I asked why no one can make a colapseable<br/>
fishing pole, and he said that part was broken.  So until they get a patch,<br/>
forget about the fishing pole.<br/>

&gt;Heya guys,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like i said quite a while ago, the gnome named Salvadori on Xegony is the<br/>
&gt;one that has learned the secret of how to make the collapsable fishing pole,<br/>
&gt;but is not willing to share the recipe.  He&#39;s only one who can make them<br/>
&gt;that I know of.  Just a reminder of that info for those of you that weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;on the board, or who don&#39;t remember.  Also, yes, he is not on very often<br/>
&gt;anymore.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I went ahead and talked to a gm and a bunch of higher level gnomes.  From<br/>
&gt;&gt; the high levels gnomes I got the impression that tinkering was a complete<br/>
&gt;&gt; and total waste of time.  In fact one told me he didn&#39;t do it because the<br/>
&gt;&gt; skill sucked and it wasn&#39;t worth it.  I did get a name from a high level<br/>
&gt;&gt; gnome who said he knew someone who used to tinker a lot.  He said the guys<br/>
&gt;&gt; name was salvadori or something like that and that he rarely came on.  He<br/>
&gt;&gt; does however come on every once in a while.  The other thing that I found<br/>
&gt;&gt; out, from the gm&#39;s, was that the skill is not broken.  I asked every gm<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;&gt; has been on for the past two nights and they all keep telling me it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;&gt; broken.  Well that&#39;s my search so far.<br/>
