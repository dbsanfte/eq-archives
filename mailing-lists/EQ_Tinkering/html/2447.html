<b>Subject:</b> Proc Level minimums added to tinkered items?! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-789699438">I was stunned, annoyed and wondering if I should be outraged.  I still <br/>
don&#39;t know what to think.  It appears as if some tinkered items, at <br/>
least, have had minimum levels added before you can use them!<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t thoroughly tested it yet but I&#39;ve had 2 reports back from <br/>
twinked newbies stating that they could not use the effect from the <br/>
telescopic eyepatches.  They received some message essentially stating <br/>
that they needed to be higher level to use the item.  I don&#39;t remember <br/>
the exact wording but I think it was the normal one you get for proc <br/>
items when you are under level.<br/>
<br/>
Sure we all know how much these tinkered items overpower characters <br/>
and what a threat giving them to newbies is.  Sure, right!<br/>
<br/>
What next, are they going to make you need to be level 20 before you <br/>
can ignite the fireworks because you can use them to pull at close <br/>
range?  I see the fireworks being able to pull as more of a threat to <br/>
class balance than the use of glimpse gained from spyglasses and <br/>
telescopic eyepatches.  *sigh*  It seriously puts a crimp in selling <br/>
them now since most people buying anything on older servers are <br/>
alternate characters, frequently twinked, and able to get get better <br/>
gear from their main characters easily enough already.  Its just <br/>
easier to buy them from a readily available source rather than have to <br/>
transfer yet more gear back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
If other items now have a minimum level to use their effects (maybe <br/>
aqualungs do now too?) it would be nice to start a list of what items <br/>
have level minimums and what that level min. is so we can warn <br/>
prospective buyers before wasting our time and theirs.</div>
