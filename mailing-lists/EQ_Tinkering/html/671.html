<div id="ygrps-yiv-596816254">The fact that your not willing to reveal what it is you have to do, so that<br/>
others on the list, some of whom are in the high level 40s can do this only<br/>
suggests that your simply back to troll some more.<br/>
<br/>
So why don&#39;t you just kindly leave?<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait, you want to troll a bunch of messages so then you can come back in<br/>
a couple days and say something like, &quot;Well, I found the important thing,<br/>
but since you all were unkind to me I won&#39;t reveal it, but this time its<br/>
your alls faults, not mine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gimme a break and just leave...<br/>

&gt;Subject: Revelations...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello, kiddies. Remember me? Well now... I imagine that you all hate me, but <br/>
&gt;it matters not...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am the 8-year-old troll that made his exit from this list with one last <br/>
&gt;letter admitting his faults...oh that&#39;s right though...I didn&#39;t write it did <br/>
&gt;I? I got my intelligent mother (or was in brother?) to write it, and any <br/>
&gt;more, &quot;intellectual&quot; sounding letters that I wrote in those rough days <br/>
&gt;before I left, because 8-year-old-trolls don&#39;t write like that, of course. <br/>
&gt;Yes yes, well I could please some of you and be an 8-year-old-troll by <br/>
&gt;coming back after leaving you with my final letter that admitted that I had <br/>
&gt;been an ass, and told you that you were all jerks, or I could have flung <br/>
&gt;more mud, and gotten more personal and done even worse, gotten even more <br/>
&gt;immature and done something even more immature, but I didn&#39;t, but why? I <br/>
&gt;mean...an     8-year-old troll would do that, but I didn&#39;t, how could it be? <br/>
&gt;It&#39;s because I&#39;m not an 8-year old troll, its because I am better than you <br/>
&gt;claim, its because I just let it go when you insulted me even after I <br/>
&gt;totally, and outright apologized, and admitted all your true, but crude <br/>
&gt;insults about me to be true. I am not back to start anything either. I am <br/>
&gt;back to reveal something of great importance, not only to tinkering, but <br/>
&gt;possibly to the entire world of Norrath. Yes yes, I know the information I <br/>
&gt;hold in itself is truly more or less insignificant to anyone BUT tinkerers, <br/>
&gt;and I know that it it can DIRECTLY not have much effect on much more than <br/>
&gt;the tinkering world, but it potentially can have great effect indirectly of <br/>
&gt;the entire game, in the long run when I really though about it. This is why <br/>
&gt;I have decided to reveal me information to you. I know that I need help. I <br/>
&gt;know that I alone cannot find something that a combined effort of maybe 1000 <br/>
&gt;people or more could not, but I DID find out the information that could <br/>
&gt;truly be one of the main reason that those 1000 people find the information <br/>
&gt;that they seek. Many of you may belive that I tell you what I know now, <br/>
&gt;because what needs to be done is out of my reach, for higher levels, and I <br/>
&gt;cannot complete it, but this is not true. In fact, I don&#39;t even know for <br/>
&gt;sure if you even need to be a high level to get what we seek so vehemently <br/>
&gt;for, but I am going to tell you the information none-the-less. Right now, I <br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t been able to search the area where I think that the item, or <br/>
&gt;information is located in, because I have been caught somewhere trying to <br/>
&gt;gain a few levels before I move on. I wish to check out the area I think it <br/>
&gt;is in a bit myself before I reveal what I know. If I find nothing, I will <br/>
&gt;tell you all the clue I have extracted, for I have realized in total <br/>
&gt;wholeness the folly of my selfish, idiotic thinking, but, even if I DO find <br/>
&gt;what we seek on my own, I shall reveal to all what I find, why? Because it <br/>
&gt;is only right. You have ALL put so much money, time, mind, and heart into <br/>
&gt;finding it, and you DO deserve to know if I find it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wrote you all this letter to tell you my decision. I must now waste no <br/>
&gt;more time, I will get those two levels with godspeed and race to where I <br/>
&gt;need to go and search, for I want to have SOMETHING to report to you, my <br/>
&gt;fellow, loyal tinkerers as soon as possible, for we are all united by this <br/>
&gt;list for one goal, and one purpose, and that is to further, the research, <br/>
&gt;and the legend, and legacy of tinkering!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I shall now be off my friends, I will return with my report as soon as I <br/>
&gt;can, and either way, I&#39;ll have something interesting to tell you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good luck to you all till then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
