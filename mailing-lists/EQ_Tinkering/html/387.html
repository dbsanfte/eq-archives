Subject: [EQ_Tinkering] More &#39;theory&#39; on the collapsable fishing pole...<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those of us hot on the trail of the ever elusive collapsable fishing<br/>
pole, here is a compilation of ideas from myself and others that might aid a<br/>
few folks with the cash to try different combinations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the subject of which components are the most promising, I would start<br/>
with excluding the reflective shard and the spriket. Next after those the<br/>
least likely candidates are the gnomish bolts, the metal twine, the bamboo<br/>
pole, and the cork. Although there could be an argument made that a &#39;cork&#39;<br/>
could be used.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, that leaves us the following 7 components to work with<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fishing Pole<br/>
&gt; metal rod<br/>
&gt; grease<br/>
&gt; metal shaft<br/>
&gt; gears<br/>
&gt; sprockets<br/>
&gt; Cloth Cord (from a tailor I assume, I have never used this in a<br/>
combination)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This significantly narrows the field, and I would highly recommend that we<br/>
exhaust all combinations of these items before moving on to others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mostly likely the recipe has from 3 to 5 components. Some have made an<br/>
argument that since the original tinker tool box had only 4 spaces, that the<br/>
recipe has 3 or 4 components. This may be true but hey, Verant screwed up on<br/>
the compass, why not the pole? =|<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We should exhaust all combinations of 4 and 5 components before moving on<br/>
to recipes with 6 or more components.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is highly likely that the recipe contains more than 1 metal shaft or<br/>
metal rod, perhaps as many as 3. While combinations using 2 and 3<br/>
rods/shafts WITH the fishing pole have almost been exhausted (check the<br/>
&#39;pole database&#39;), I have noticed we still have quite a few combinations left<br/>
to try that EXCLUDE a regular fishing pole, but INCLUDE 2/3 rods or shafts.<br/>
There are very few of the &#39;double shaft&#39; and &#39;triple shaft&#39; combinations<br/>
that exclude the fishing pole yet to be tried.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Having exhausted all of these, then the most likely possibilities are that<br/>
there is some component somewhere that we are missing, perhaps there is a<br/>
tinkered item like a &#39;reel&#39; that we need to make first before combining it<br/>
to make the fishing pole, or Verant has once again screwed the tinkers of<br/>
the world... =|<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While I tend to lean toward the latter, the possibility of having to<br/>
&#39;pre-tinker&#39; a reel for the rod sounds intriguing...  blah...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anywho, thats my 500 plat on the matter or so (I have spent a hell of a<br/>
lot more than 2 cents).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
