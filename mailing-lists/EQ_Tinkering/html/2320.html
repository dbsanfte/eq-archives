<br/>
So I might as well ask.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On fulcrums tinkering website there is a recipe for a skin improver. <br/>
IE 2 lq pelts make a medium. Is this fact or fantasy?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I see a standard list of items from animated bait to <br/>
rebreather. Is that it? Looks like there&#39;s only about 8 items that <br/>
can be made. Is this comprehensive? (Only got one tinkering book <br/>
myself).<br/>
