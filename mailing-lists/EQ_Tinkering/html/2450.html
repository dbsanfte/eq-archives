<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864491197">Watchman armor is level limited.. its between 17 and 30 I hear (I know the <br/>
17 is right.. doesn&#39;t work on my warrior)<br/>
<br/>
And yes, the eyepatches and footwarming boots are a joke.  The boots cost <br/>
too much to make for an additional +5 sv cold.  They also take way too long <br/>
to make since you have to make the fine steel boots.  At least the watchman <br/>
armor is so difficult that you fail 99% of the time and get the fine steel <br/>
armor back and can try again.  You succeed to much on the footwarming boots <br/>
and have to spend hours making them again.  And the sharkskin tubing is <br/>
150pp each.. sigh<br/>

&gt;Yeah, the eyepatches have a level limit.  I don&#39;t know if the watchman armor<br/>
&gt;does or not.  They haven&#39;t gone back and added limits to the other stuff,<br/>
&gt;though.<br/>

&gt;Eyepatches are a joke.  Use spyglasses.<br/>

&gt;Most of tinkering is a joke right now.  I got my skill to 135 via power<br/>
&gt;gloves and catapults, and it&#39;s going to sit there until more items get added<br/>
&gt;that will raise it, and that are realistically able to be built.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Side note: getting to the point where I could make the 60 or so bows I<br/>
&gt;needed for the catapults got my fletching up to 182.  Heh.  I just might<br/>
&gt;spend some time and get it to 200, just for grins.<br/>
