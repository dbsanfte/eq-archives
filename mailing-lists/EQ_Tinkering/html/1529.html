<div id="ygrps-yiv-332741256">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned the mailing list falling apart, most of it is probably due to nothing really new has been found out in the last couple of weeks and our fearless leader &quot;Gnomad&quot; has closed his EQ account and stopped updating his web site.<br/>
<br/>
With the exception of Diamond Dust, (I could care less about the thermal cloak) everything to be known about tinkering can be found in the books in Steamfont or Akanon.<br/>
<br/>
About the fella claiming to know someone with a 187 skill or whatever, his bullshit post wasnt even worthy of a reply... =| I think there are folks on this list who just hop on every now and again to pull our chain and make us go on a wild goose chase.<br/>
<br/>
About the rebreather. I believe there are folks on some servers that are making them now. My hat goes off to them and the astronomical price they had to pay to get the skill. I would be curious to know how they got the 40k+ plat that is required after you max out at 102 on stalking probes to get the skill raised. My guess would be thier guild put up the cash.<br/>
<br/>
Rebreathers are doable, but like I said above you can expect to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of 40k+ making aqua lungs to get there. Thats a hell of a lot of aqua lungs to sell =|<br/>
<br/>
As for Diamond dust, I aint gonna believe shit till someone shows it to me in a trade window. If someone wants to show off, I would gladly hop on any server of your choice just to take a look at it =) I dont care if you tell me where you got it or not, I would just like to know if its in the game or not...heh-heh.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
