<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564305363">I don&#39;t know about it being a quest.  I have killed hundreds upon hundreds of<br/>
Minotaurs, I have killed Meldrath many times, and I have also killed the<br/>
minotaur guards. Yet my faction with King Akanon isn&#39;t warm.  It maybe because I<br/>
am a necro and there is a certain cap to faction, I really don&#39;t know.<br/>

&gt; . I just think that maybe we are mising somethings, maybe a quest? You<br/>
&gt; know, some quests are not given, or even talked about unless you have high<br/>
&gt; faction, so maybe if your faction with King Ak&#39;Anon is warmly, he talks to<br/>
&gt; you and gives you a quest.<br/>

from The Simpsons:  During contract negotiations.<br/>
<br/>
Burns :  We don&#39;t have to be adversaries Homer, we both want a fair Union<br/>
contract...<br/>
Homer (To Brain) : Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me?<br/>
Burns:  ...and if you scratch my back,  I&#39;ll scratch yours!<br/>
Homer&#39;s Brain:  Wait a minute, is he coming onto me?<br/>
Burns:  I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what&#39;s the harm?<br/>
Homer&#39;s Brain: Oh my God! He is coming onto me!<br/>
Burns: After all, negotiations make strange bed-fellows, [Friendly Laugh]<br/>
Homer&#39;s Brain:  Arggh!<br/>
Homer: Sorry Mr. Burns, but I don&#39;t go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure<br/>
I&#39;m flattered, maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no!</div>
