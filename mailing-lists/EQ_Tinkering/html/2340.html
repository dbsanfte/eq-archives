<b>Subject:</b> Faction not good enough to buy bow parts in Kelethin? Not sure how yer gonna make all those catapults? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-323184517">Well, I looted a TBB the other night, so I finally had some cash to sink<br/>
into tinkering again, and after 600pp continualy recycled on powered gloves<br/>
my skill went from 107 to122. Then I realized that being a necro, i was<br/>
pretty well screwed for making the shaped ashwood recurve bows needed for<br/>
the catapults (after dropping 300pp into fletching to go from 0-125).<br/>
<br/>
Found a simple solution for that though, on the brell server there is a<br/>
guild devoted to fletching &quot;Royal Fletchers&quot; is the name of the guild, I<br/>
offered one of the members the job and he took it (well, i  /auc WTB shaped<br/>
ashwood recurve bows, need 10, 40pp each   and one of them was the first to<br/>
respond)<br/>
Seems to me that this is a great way to get from 122 to 135 without having<br/>
to travel all of Norath just to make some lousy bows for a useless piece yer<br/>
just gonna sell back to the merchant.<br/>
<br/>
The point of course, is that if yer on Brell and at that point in yer<br/>
tinkering career, you may want to give one of them a holler.<br/>
