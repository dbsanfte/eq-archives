<div id="ygrps-yiv-326649723">From the tinkering books it looks like old Simpkin was interested in using the gemcutter to make those wonderful pearl anaglyphs that he was so fond of. Why not try combining the gemcutter with a pearl? I would suggest doing this in a jewelry kit sice Simpkin was a jeweler. <br/>
