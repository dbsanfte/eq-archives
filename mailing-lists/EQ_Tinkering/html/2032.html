<div id="ygrps-yiv-585868057">Unfortunately, the mech lockpicks don&#39;t do anything over regular <br/>
lockpicks.  I tried it myself with a door in freeport.  I practiced until I <br/>
could just open the door using mechanical lockpicks, then tried to use <br/>
regular lockpicks and the door opened.  So, doesn&#39;t matter which you <br/>
use.  Therefore, the mechanical lockpicks have no special ability that is <br/>
readily apparent.  At least not as advertized by Verant.  Before I found <br/>
this out, I was selling them for 40pp each.  Now, I won&#39;t sell them until I <br/>
find out what good they are.  As for spyglasses, 80pp is a normal price.  I <br/>
also give them away to people that resurrect me :)<br/>

&gt;What&#39;s the going price for mech lockpicks, cams, and especially spyglasses?<br/>
&gt;Do any of these turn into moneymakers? </span></blockquote></div>
