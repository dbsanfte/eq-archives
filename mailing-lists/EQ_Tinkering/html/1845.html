<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354389659">I have a character who is always camped inside the palace and has been there<br/>
since the beginning of release. Whenever I sign on, which is to go buy<br/>
things and log inside the palace again (tinkering items), I always have seen<br/>
the king being a small human. I went in game and had a lvl 50 enchanter<br/>
dispell the king. Nothing happenned. This GM is right. I&#39;m tired of<br/>
following Gazamel&#39;s roads to nowhere. -El Fin-<br/>

&gt; Ever since retail release I have been wondering about this and bugging<br/>
&gt; gms for an explanation.  I can not remember a time when Akanon was not a<br/>
&gt; SMALL human.  The only guide to give any explanation said (opinion only,<br/>
&gt; he/she remembered him being a small human since retail as well) that<br/>
&gt; maybe Verant was waiting for something worthy of a King...Who knows.<br/>
&gt; Someone I know went in and killed him once, so I&#39;ll ask him what Akanon<br/>
&gt; repoped as...<br/>

&gt; Mith Marr<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS  A dark elf once told me that Akanon is really a brownie that has all<br/>
&gt; us gnomes fooled...scary thought!<br/>
