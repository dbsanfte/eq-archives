<div id="ygrps-yiv-689444439">Hehe, ya I was surprised when I found him too.  I tried talking to him, but<br/>
it seemed like he didn&#39;t have much to say at the time.<br/>

&gt; Yes, I have seen him. You won&#39;t believe who it is either! =) I have not<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; able to talk to him yet, but a lot of quest raise your faction with him so<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; bet if you do enough quest he will talk to you.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Off topic here, no need to reply, just delete.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; sending it to Tinkering because it&#39;s Gnome specific.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In Ak&#39;anon, if you&#39;re heading towards the warriors<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild, but hitch a left and go out over the water into<br/>
&gt; &gt; the spires that hold a few shops you&#39;ll occasionally<br/>
&gt; &gt; notice something:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; King Ak&#39;anon begins to cast a spell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone SEEN the King?  I can&#39;t find him.  And I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonder if you COULD talk to him, if he would send you<br/>
&gt; &gt; on some really wild quests.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please make sure I&#39;m not smoking crack on this one,<br/>
&gt; &gt; because I SWEAR I receive that message when I&#39;m out<br/>
&gt; &gt; over the water on those shops.<br/>
