<b>Subject:</b> Combinations to try with the cloth twine... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-135259172">Hello Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that the &#39;cloth twine&#39; is about the only component that we have not tried extensively, I thought I would put up a few combination &#39;theories&#39; that some folks with cash might want to try. Since they do not include any gears or sprockets, this series will not be as expensive to try as some of the others.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I kill a few more cazic lizzys I will try a few myself, until then I will leave the rest as an excercise to the reader =)<br/>
<br/>
I have not bought any myself, but I assume that the cloth twine can be found in either a fletchers shop or a tailors shop.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
