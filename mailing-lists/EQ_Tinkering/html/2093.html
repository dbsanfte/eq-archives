<div id="ygrps-yiv-443083820">The sharkskin tubing or whatever its name was never dropped on sharks as far <br/>
as I know. That rumour ran on this list for a long LONG time, but it was <br/>
started by someone who had never seen it. He had only been told by someone <br/>
that claimed 200 skill a long time ago. That 200 skill person was pretty <br/>
flamed on this list for lying and holding back information although he <br/>
himself was never here and me for one, and I&#39;ve been tinkering since I <br/>
started my char over a year ago although my skill is still pretty low, have <br/>
never heard of it from anywhere but that obscure source on this list quite a <br/>
long time ago..<br/>
<br/>
And as someone mentioned earlier, NO chars were moved over from beta, we all <br/>
had to start fresh (Sadly, I had a p3 account, hehe)<br/>
