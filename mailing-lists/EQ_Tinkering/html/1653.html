<br/>
and used the gun in the picture as a refrence, since looking at the pic and<br/>
site, you 1st notice the guy is lvl 100... umm YEA.. Gotta start looking at<br/>
that :) Open graphics program and notice that the text was changed, almost all<br/>
the text on this page was change.. other then the message text. &lt;Graphics guy<br/>
here sorry folks&gt; You&#39;ll notice that some of the items have been &quot;PASTED&quot; into<br/>
there respected positions, not a bad job thou.. but the smuging is blantly<br/>
obvious even for a jpg....but the gun isn&#39;t smudged.. &lt;go look - zoom in&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER... that would mean that this guy would have had to goto great lengths<br/>
to make a new graphic and model for the &quot;gun&quot;, even thou the model info is not<br/>
avable to public &lt;989 propritary&gt; HUMM... makes me wonder... even the &quot;BALL&quot;<br/>
isn&#39;t pasted in......<br/>
