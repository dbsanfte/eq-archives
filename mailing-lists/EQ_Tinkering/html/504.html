<br/>
In other news...<br/>
<br/>
I decided to go zoo hunting the other day... yes, you can kill all those<br/>
animals in the zoo, the guards get real pissed but they can&#39;t get to you if<br/>
you hop over into the little stalls the animals sit in.<br/>
<br/>
The tiger and bear I killed with no problem, and I got a tiger skin from<br/>
the tiger that I haven&#39;t sold yet because it looks so cool.  Anyways, the<br/>
interesting part is that when I killed the minotaur I lost faction with the<br/>
king, gemchoppers, eldritch collective etc...  The reason I think this is<br/>
interesting is because the book mentions campturing a minotaur for the zoo,<br/>
and its also interesting that whoever made the zoo went through the trouble<br/>
of giving this minotaur good faction with the gnomes.  The tiger and bear<br/>
had no faction hit at all, but the minotaur does.<br/>
<br/>
I tried talking to the minotaur and giving him various things but it didn&#39;t<br/>
help any, I also tried talking to the keeper underneath the minotaur and<br/>
didn&#39;t make any progress there either.  But they are definately linked somehow.<br/>
