<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-50943492">All my characters grow up in Steam and I always ask what the loot of Mel is<br/>
when he is taken down.  I&#39;ve never heard of the collapsible fishing pole as<br/>
an item.  Then again you could be right and it is just a rare item, but I<br/>
just don&#39;t see Mel as having a fishing hobby. =)  I&#39;d be more interested in<br/>
seeing what kind of loot the guards have....<br/>

		I have another theory.  The group making spyglasses on the<br/>
Xegony server is <br/>
		not actually making them.  I hypothesis, based upon Luke&#39;s<br/>
ownership of a <br/>
		fishing pole, that the collapsible fishing pole may be a<br/>
drop from <br/>
		Meldrath.  Has anyone killed and looted him?  His guards are<br/>
around Level <br/>
		35 or so, but Meldrath is around 26.  Perhaps a method to<br/>
kill him would be <br/>
		to get a druid or shaman with SOW to cast at the guards,<br/>
pull them away out <br/>
		of the cave and let a warrior and wizard finish Meldrath<br/>
off.  Perhaps its <br/>
		a common drop, maybe a rare drop.  Just another theory.<br/>
