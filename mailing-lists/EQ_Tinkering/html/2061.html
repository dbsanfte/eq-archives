<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692163267">When I did the quest a few times at 29 he was blue to<br/>
me. He was red to a 23rd Ranger that helped out. So he<br/>
had to be between 26-28th level. Not to mention the<br/>
faeri guards will help him out. I would not have been<br/>
able to take him solo...but then again...I&#39;m a<br/>
warrior.<br/>
<br/>
the quest rewards are very disappointing for a mid<br/>
20&#39;s quest. Barbarians and Dwarves have these nice<br/>
weapons....gnomes get rawhide armor and bronze<br/>
weapons...whoohoo!<br/>
