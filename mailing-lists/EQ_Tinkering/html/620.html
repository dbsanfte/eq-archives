<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008341301">This came from the spoilers mailing list... might be a clue... It looks <br/>
like some of the clockworks in Sol have been itemized.. Maybe a rare drop <br/>
of one is the last tinkering book...<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Most of this stuff comes from Sol A- you should be around mid 20s to enter <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;zone, then up to high 30s for exp.  Goblin Captain- high 20s- drops some of it<br/>
&gt;(Boots and Gloves), some of it comes from Gnome Clockworks- Clockwork EXG <br/>
&gt;(drops<br/>
&gt;shield and Breastplate- if you can&#39;t see the shield she has BP).  This EXG is<br/>
&gt;wanders around and is totally immune to spells of all types, plus he hits hard<br/>
&gt;for a level 30 or so MOB.  I&#39;ve seen a level 50 cleric solo it (yes cleric<br/>
&gt;fighting with melee only then healing himself), but it was a tough <br/>
&gt;fight.  Easy<br/>
&gt;with a couple of real tanks.  There are rumors of other pieces out there, but<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve never seen equipped or looted any myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Best piece for a cleric/shaman/druid comes from the EXG- the Charred Guardian<br/>
&gt;Shield is 10ac +9 wis </span></blockquote></div>
