<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893607887"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My conclusions on Level CAP for tinkering skill is as follow:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It has the same exact scheme and Spell Caster Research...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;it start at 16 (the same)..you can only get 1 level of skill up at 16th.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On research, I could not TRAIN anymore point until I hit 20th.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Seem to the same with all the tinkering story.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once you hit 20th, you could train 5 points...and every level 5 more<br/>
&gt;points...(or was it every 4 levels)..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, from what I read, what happened seem to conform with my theory.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What is you guys feedback?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t get past 72 (or was it 71... pretty sure it&#39;s 72) and I&#39;m lvl 30. <br/>
Not sure how this fits into the equation. I gotta do a petition but I&#39;m sure <br/>
the GM&#39;s will just tell me that I just have bad luck... I was coasting from <br/>
60 to 72 also... darnit. There must be some kind of cap...<br/>
<br/>
On another note,<br/>
I petitioned about how much the fireworks blow and convinced the GM to come <br/>
to the mills and see for himself.. like someone else on the board did. After <br/>
I shot off a few of the fireworks the GM laughed at me =(<br/>
Hehe but he was a gnome and agreed that the effect should be a bit better <br/>
and filled out some sort of form. Which is neat =)<br/>
