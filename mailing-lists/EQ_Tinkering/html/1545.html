<br/>
You&#39;re looking for Duster X and Duster V.  Duster V is a fairly common<br/>
spawn and travels from the front gate to the throne room.  Duster X (and<br/>
do not mistake this with Cleaner X - you will take a faction hit if you<br/>
kill this one) is a much rarer spawn (heh I&#39;ve seen it once only) and<br/>
spawns back near the mines of malfuntion by the water wheel, although it<br/>
apparently will travel to the little islands in the lake.  Usually a<br/>
clockwork scrubber will spawn in it&#39;s place and will stay there for<br/>
several hours.  You could try killing the scrubber to get it to spawn but<br/>
you will take faction hits for that.<br/>
<br/>
Once you return the two scrap metal pieces, you will receive the<br/>
Bullsmasher, which is a decent teen-lvl weapon.  I can&#39;t remeber the stats<br/>
off-hand but the weapon is for small races only and adds +2 to 3 stats if<br/>
I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>

&gt; around some in Ak&#39;Anon, and I talked to everyone I<br/>
&gt; could find about diamond dust. Only one NPC responded<br/>
&gt; to my queries, and it seemed kind of related. He told<br/>
&gt; me that I needed to kill &quot;clockwork dusters&quot; and<br/>
&gt; return their remains to him since they&#39;re obsolete.<br/>
&gt; This NPC is just across the water near the Mines of<br/>
&gt; Malfunction. I looked all over for these dusters, but<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t find any, all I found were scrubbers,<br/>
&gt; cleaners, and sweepers. If you happen to come across<br/>
&gt; any, let me know how it turns out!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Keep up the good work, and someone PLEASE find<br/>
&gt; &gt; diamond dust :)<br/>
