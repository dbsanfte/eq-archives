<div id="ygrps-yiv-660251301">In a message dated 99-10-03 17:32:36 EDT, you write:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Why do you all act like this? I try to help, but you decline it. If what <br/>
you <br/>
 want is for me to truly leave with my information, then that is what I will <br/>
 do. I will leave the choice up to you. I&#39;m trying to apologize by helping, <br/>
 but you seem to want to be stubborn, and keep insulting me, saying all I&#39;m <br/>
 out here to do is brag, when in fact I&#39;m trying to do the opposite. What I <br/>
 have to do could easily be done by a level 1 shaman barbarian. I just want <br/>
 to check it out for myself first and return with a report, if you all hate <br/>
 me so much that you wouldn&#39;t even take direct information from me because <br/>
 you think I want to just brag about it, then I wil quietly leave you all <br/>
 with out another letter. But like I said, it&#39;s yur choice, you can accept it <br/>
 or decline it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On your part I don&#39;t think its right your judging the whole message board by <br/>
the posts of 2 people.</div>
