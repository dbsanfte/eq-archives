<b>Subject:</b> Re: Gnomish Fireworks - Ugh! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-898492855">Yep I made a bunch too.  I didn&#39;t realize each one had a different fireworks<br/>
number.  I thought they just shot random colors.  And yes it was a terrible<br/>
let down.  hehe that guy that posted earlier about having a tinkerer&#39;s<br/>
meeting and fireing his one and only firework would have been a pretty<br/>
pathetic finale.  :)  I made a bunch and was handing them out to people for<br/>
free outside ak&#39;anon.  And everyone that took one, fired it and then asked<br/>
me &quot;How do you use it?  I right clicked on it and didn&#39;t see anything&quot;.<br/>
Every single person said that.  hehe I told them don&#39;t blink or you&#39;ll miss<br/>
it.  lol<br/>
<br/>
Althought I did make a couple collapsable fishing poles! (3 metal rods, 1<br/>
gnomish bolts)  And I even made a spyglass after 3 attempts.  All in all,<br/>
I&#39;m a happy gnome for the first time in a while.  :)<br/>

&gt; I just made a bunch of sets of gnomish fireworks...The recipe is<br/>
&gt; Firewater (1)<br/>
&gt; Bat Wing (1)<br/>
&gt; Metal Shaft (1).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  This costs around a gold to make and produces 4 separate fireworks.<br/>
&gt; They differ in that each one has a different effect (Fireworks1,<br/>
&gt; Fireworks2, Fireworks3, Fireworks4).   Unfortunately the effect of each<br/>
&gt; one is horrible!  They might be broken, but as of right now they do<br/>
&gt; nothing but send a TINY colored flame straight out from your body and<br/>
&gt; lasts about a tenth of a second at best.  The difference between the 4<br/>
&gt; types seems to be color of the flame. That is IF you even catch a<br/>
&gt; glimpse of the flame (if you blink you will miss it).  About the only<br/>
&gt; good thing I can say about them is that Im glad they cost me next to<br/>
&gt; nothing to make, since for now they seem to be a complete waste.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope this was an isolated experience and that other people have more<br/>
&gt; luck than I do with them. </span></blockquote></div>
