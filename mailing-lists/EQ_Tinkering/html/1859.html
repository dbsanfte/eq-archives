<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051296585">Praise Bertox that someone is finally talking about tinkering again:)<br/>
I love my king and all but the conversation can only go so far. Well<br/>
as for Oot i will explore that zone as much as i can although i am still<br/>
4 bloody skill pts away from my first attempt at an aqualung. Best of <br/>
luck to all and might i recommend that useing locate undead because if there<br/>
is a boat then there will probably be undead there:) Unfortunatly i don&#39;t <br/>
think it is a small tattered cloak we are looking for. In all the other books<br/>
components of the items are in caps and are always the same name for the item<br/>
as in the books. So I think we are looking for a tattered gnomish cloak and <br/>
recommend killing any so called... BAD gnomes out in Norrath in the hopes that<br/>
they may have the item. BTW tinkering is the best skill in the game in the fact<br/>
that there is so much still to do with it that hasn&#39;t been discovered.<br/>
It may be expensive as all hell but who cares it is fun:)<br/>
