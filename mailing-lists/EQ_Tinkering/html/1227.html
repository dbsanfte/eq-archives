<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399727045">I played in beta (from beta 2) and from what I understand, tinkering was<br/>
completely non-functional.  I don&#39;t believe toolkits were even available.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d even venture that I think tinkering is the last of the trade skills to<br/>
get implemented, with perhaps the exception of poison creation (and maybe<br/>
tied with alchemy).<br/>

5. Anyone do tinkering when EQ was beta? Any formulas for robots and such?<br/>
   I know they were taken out, but maybe such recipes would give clues.</div>
