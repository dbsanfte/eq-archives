Onelist is being crappy to me]<br/>\n<br/>\nOk. Not to get everyone too excited, but I&#39;ve heard rumors of a third<br/>\ntinkering book. Someone said there are clockworks and gnomes in<br/>\nSolusek A and also that there is a tinkering book for sale in there.<br/>\nBut it was said that is costs 7000pp. I camped last night in the entrance<br/>\nto Solusek A, so I&#39;ll try to check it out tomorrow and report back. I<br/>\nwon&#39;t be walking out with the 7000pp book, but I&#39;ll hopefully have<br/>\nthe title of it *grin*.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny confirmations of this? I did hear this directly from someone in game<br/>\ninside Solusek A, so I wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;d be wrong. How&#39;s everyone&#39;s<br/>\ntinkering skill going? Any master tinkers yet or is it too expensive?<br/>\n<br/>\n                        - Chad<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFind people who care about what you care about.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAt ONElist:  your connection to community.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
