Looking on the &#39;Database&#39; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)\">http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)</a> I see that not many combinations have been tried with the cork, sprocket, or cloth twine. Although they dont seem to be the most likely candidates, I could see them as a possibility.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith all the misses, I just cant help thinking we have missed something.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI am also beginning to think that the earlier rumors of the fishing pole being makable are bull shit. If someone is making the poles and the eye glasses, I would have thought we would have heard about more people having them. We have not heard a peep from anyone since. Perhaps as Luke said, the pole was given as part of a GM quest, and was not actually tinkered.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI think it says something about the sad state of tinkering when our &#39;holy grail&#39; is a damn fishing pole =|\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCheers,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFizzWizz of tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
