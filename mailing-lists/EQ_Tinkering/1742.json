I&#39;m nearing rebreathers and wanted to verify our collective knowledge before  I got there.  We hadn&#39;t had a progress report for a while anyway.  FizzWizz? :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n* Aqualungs are NOT triival yet at 134<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone gotten beyond 134?  How high can we say it is not trivial at?  Or has someone actually found the trivial point?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Rebreather recipe:<br/>\n1 Aqualung<br/>\n1 Lime Coated Meshing<br/>\n1 Sharkskin Tubing<br/>\n1 Medium Platemail Helm<br/>\n1 Firewater<br/>\n1 Metal Fastening<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this the verified recipe that has worked for those making rebreathers?  Especially regarding which type of helm to use. :o)  Have we verified that a zero charge aqualung can be used to make the rebreather?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Selling rebreathers for 3250 plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nFizzwizz has mentioned this as his going rate.  Those that are making rebreathers, what say you?  What should we set our standard rate at?  What kind of failure rate are you having with the rebreathers?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, if the person who knows how to get diamond dust is reading this.  Could you please spare us the agony of rumors and anonymously send in a screenshot showing the diamond dust info window and item pic?  That&#39;d be swell, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should be to rebreathers by the end of the weekend and will post a progress report of my journey as a tinker.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlintnilf Ironori<br/>\nLevel 43 Gnome Wizard of Solusek Ro<br/>\nSquire of Dark Valor<br/>\nMaster Tinker<br/>\nPovar Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
