I read in another post that<br/>\nsomeone found one and the runes were very similar to the ones on the<br/>\nGnomish Clock in Qeynos. (I&#39;m trying to determine where he might have<br/>\nfound this note)  Perhaps if these runes could be deciphered, they might<br/>\nlead to a clue to tinkering a collapsable fishing rod.  Anyone notice<br/>\nthese runes anywhere else?
