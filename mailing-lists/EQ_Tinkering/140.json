I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know exactly how to explain it, when you run at the camp from the<br/>\nhunting point next to the water she is the one on the back left.  Bad<br/>\ndirections I know.  She sells them to me with 65 charisma for about 3.4<br/>\npp I would say.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is about the same price it costs me to make them.

The good<br/>\n&gt; news is that killing Dervs hurts your faction with<br/>\n&gt; her, so she won&#39;t deal with<br/>\n&gt; most people in the area.  (Who hangs out in Ro and<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t kill Dervs?)  I<br/>\n&gt; managed to sell a few in the Qeynos area for 4-5pp,<br/>\n&gt; but haven&#39;t been tinkering<br/>\n&gt; much since I&#39;m about as far away from my tinkering<br/>\n&gt; supplies that I can get :)<br/>\n&gt; Cheer<br/>\n&gt; Malkin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Master Brewer, Baker, Tinkerer (Talk about picking<br/>\n&gt; the wrong skills)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; MadGrizzle wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: MadGrizzle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MadGrizzle@...\">MadGrizzle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am by no means condoning price fixing, however,<br/>\n&gt; i would like to know at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what price are you selling compasses.  It costs a<br/>\n&gt; bit over 3pp to make (I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t failed yet..knock on wood).  I&#39;m currently<br/>\n&gt; selling for 5 pp, most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people who want one have no problem paying the 5<br/>\n&gt; pp.  I have found some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people who will only pay 4pp, to whom I tell to<br/>\n&gt; come back to me when you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get a bit more frustrated hitting sense heading. <br/>\n&gt; However, I do manage to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sell one, maybe two a day.  I here that you can<br/>\n&gt; buy compasses from gypsies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in North Karana but I haven&#39;t made the trip to<br/>\n&gt; check it out (last time I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was there i got mauled by a grif).  I also heard<br/>\n&gt; you could get them in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kithicor forest but I went through all the shops<br/>\n&gt; and didn&#39;t find any.  I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go to the gypsies and check them out then head to<br/>\n&gt; lavastorm to see if they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have them also.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
