Only one NPC responded<br/>\nto my queries, and it seemed kind of related. He told<br/>\nme that I needed to kill &quot;clockwork dusters&quot; and<br/>\nreturn their remains to him since they&#39;re obsolete.<br/>\nThis NPC is just across the water near the Mines of<br/>\nMalfunction. I looked all over for these dusters, but<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t find any, all I found were scrubbers,<br/>\ncleaners, and sweepers. If you happen to come across<br/>\nany, let me know how it turns out!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Keep up the good work, and someone PLEASE find<br/>\n&gt; diamond dust :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandortien, 50th gnome wizard of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
