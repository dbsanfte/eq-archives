He&#39;s an inkie that spawns behind Inn 1 in West Commons.  When <br/>\nyou kill him, you get faction adjustment for the Eldritch Collective and he <br/>\ndrops Noresa&#39;s purse.  I went around the Library of Mechamagica and asked <br/>\n&#39;who is Kizdean&#39;, &#39;who is Kizdean Gix&#39;, and &#39;who is Noresa&#39; and got no <br/>\nresponses... Anyone have any clue why killing Kizdean gives you a faction <br/>\nadjustment with the Eldritch Collective... Also, what is everyones faction <br/>\nwith them..
