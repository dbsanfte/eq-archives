I just want a pet to show<br/>\noff my tinkering skill and to goof off with.  It would provide a great money<br/>\nsink which Verant seems to love, as well.  I don&#39;t even care if it will<br/>\nfight anything.  A pet that follows me like a shadow or at most even looks<br/>\nfor food and that&#39;s it is good enough for me. Some people had some great<br/>\nsuggestions on different kinds of pets and the various pricing.  Good work.<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep my fingers crossed and hope my warrior gets to tinker a playmate<br/>\nsomeday. <br/>\n <br/>\nKilkin Cobblepot<br/>\n46 Gemchopper - Fen Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cory Burns [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coryb@...\">coryb@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 23, 2000 9:16 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [EQ_Tinkering] Digest Number 289<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about a wizard class. Which all in all would be the strongest class<br/>\nwith even a crappy little pet. A wizards biggest problem is keeping the mob<br/>\noccupied while he/she cast a spell. Think about it even if the pet had 200<br/>\nHP it would take a giant 2 hits to kill it giving the casting times on<br/>\nwizard spells. He could get his root off and then proceed to whip up the<br/>\ngiant I am not saying he would still win, but a class that is strong like<br/>\nwizards that do not use pets and would really damn strong if they did, would<br/>\nbe something Verant would not ever do.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nFanrick Tinker/Magician of Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
