I was thinking last night while I <br/>\nwas sleeping and having those EQ dreams I often do from playing so much.    <br/>\nThat maybe its a faction issue.   I would like to try this but I am a necro <br/>\nand it would be very difficult and I will do nothing but obtain KOS status <br/>\nwith the Dark reflection.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I remember right that wizard or merchant or whatever he is in the third <br/>\nwindmill says something about the Eldrich collective.   About being a member <br/>\nor something.   Same with the wizard behind the library.    And I think Jogle <br/>\nand his spider are a key to tinkering also.    Maybe if someone does the <br/>\nsmaller quests in akanon over and over their faction will get high enough <br/>\nwith some of the surrounding guilds that maybe jogl or that wizard will give <br/>\nsome sort of quest.    I believe that maybe its a faction issue.    And we <br/>\nmay just be looking in the wrong area.     Or something to do that zoo keeper <br/>\nmentioned in the book.    Gimblestein states in his book about the quest he <br/>\ndid with him.   Maybe there is some sort of quest to obtain a scroll or third <br/>\ntinkering book.     And what about all those mechanics around akanon they <br/>\nhave to be used for some type of quest or other.      Just some ideas.     <br/>\nLet me know what you think or if this has already been discussed.     Because <br/>\nI haven&#39;t heard much word from our infiltrator???   So I take it the <br/>\ninfiltration plan isn&#39;t going to well.<br/>\n<br/>\nShmellbee NuckinFutz (Sillyhood).   Povar.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
