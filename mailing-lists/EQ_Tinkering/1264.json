Apparently after spending a LOT of plat, it appears the rumor that the skill level limit of 5 x (level-15) is true. Damn...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am 35th, and can not get my skill above 100. Another 32nd level gnome beside me could not get his to raise about 85. I have heard other stories of gnomes not being able to break some unknown barrier when it came to tinkering.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this basically does is allow the high level characters (who have most everything by now anyway), to corner the tinkering market. The failure rate of an aqua lung at a skill of 102, depending on your stats, is about 50% to 60%, which means unless you are 35th level or above you will have an unacceptable failure rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just not damn fair. No other trade in the game has a limit like this, and us tinkers have suffered enough. Make sure the first thing you do when you hop on next time is to &quot;/bug&quot; and &quot;/suggestion&quot; Verant about this totally preposterous skill limit.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nFizzwizz of tunare.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
