Because it is.  There was a high level gnome on Xegony that was<br/>\nselling spy glasses, which require the fishing pole.  He had more than one,<br/>\nwhich dispels the idea that he just got one from a gm quest.  According to<br/>\nhim, he is in a guild who specifically had been working to find the recipe<br/>\nfor the pole, and had finally been successful.  Unfortunately, he was<br/>\nunwilling to share his recipe.  No doubt, the recipe is out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nXalastile<br/>\nlvl 22 magician<br/>\nxegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sragan@...\">sragan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com\">EQ_Tinkering@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 17, 1999 7:55 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_Tinkering] Some ponderings about the fishing pole.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sragan@...\">sragan@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello Folks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After seeing all the different combinations that we have tried to no<br/>\navail, I&#39;m beginning to think there might be a component somewhere that we<br/>\nare not using. Looking on the &#39;Database&#39;<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)\">http://www.lockjaw.hamptoncity.com/recipe.html)</a> I see that not many<br/>\ncombinations have been tried with the cork, sprocket, or cloth twine.<br/>\nAlthough they dont seem to be the most likely candidates, I could see them<br/>\nas a possibility.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With all the misses, I just cant help thinking we have missed something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am also beginning to think that the earlier rumors of the fishing pole<br/>\nbeing makable are bull shit. If someone is making the poles and the eye<br/>\nglasses, I would have thought we would have heard about more people having<br/>\nthem. We have not heard a peep from anyone since. Perhaps as Luke said, the<br/>\npole was given as part of a GM quest, and was not actually tinkered.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it says something about the sad state of tinkering when our &#39;holy<br/>\ngrail&#39; is a damn fishing pole =|<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FizzWizz of tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\n&gt; For details and to order, go to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
