I did shout out to see who was making them but got no<br/>\nresponse.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever it does provide me with that glimmer that they are out there just<br/>\nwaiting to be found. . if you haven&#39;t seen them go off. . its green/blueish<br/>\ntrails going up. . which explode in the big firework white fashion. . jsut<br/>\nthought. . .

I am<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; going from what little I now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     While I was riding on the boat to fp i decided to bring some reading<br/>\n&gt; along. (EX: tinkering books). While reading it over I was thinking if any<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; these things could be hints on how to make some other stuff or find the<br/>\n&gt; missing book. Well here are some suggestions to check into. Talk to King<br/>\n&gt; Akannon about it. In the book it mentions at the begging he is writing it<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; him or something along those lines. His wife might be in the game (not<br/>\nsure).<br/>\n&gt; He mentions her in the books as compassvess or something close to that. He<br/>\n&gt; named the compass after her. Maybe she has something about it. Talk to the<br/>\n&gt; zookeeper cause he was the one that practically sent them to the mino<br/>\ncaves<br/>\n&gt; to get a minotaur for the zoo. Try killing the minotaur in the zoo. He<br/>\nmight<br/>\n&gt; somehow have the book. Thats all I could think of about this. If anyone<br/>\nelse<br/>\n&gt; has some ideas send them in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also I was thinking of some gnomish firework recipes. Maybe we have to add<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; stalking probe and a flask of water and maybe some other item to make the<br/>\n&gt; fireworks. It mentions in one of the books that he was worried about the<br/>\n&gt; scouts exploding when the were doing something and he mentions a something<br/>\n&gt; about a flask of water with it. Maybe add a metal rod or that cheaper rod<br/>\n&gt; thing for the stalking probe to shoot out of when it comes in contact with<br/>\n&gt; the water. shoots in the air and explodes. I dunno don&#39;t take these<br/>\nlitteraly<br/>\n&gt; and rely on them alot. There just some guesses i thought of.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
