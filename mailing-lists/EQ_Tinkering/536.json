It turns out, the first guy I talked to was his friend, or used to <br/>\nbe rather (they seem to have had a fight) He said Salvador hadn&#39;t been on <br/>\nfor a long time, but he had been acting strange before he left. He said that <br/>\nSalvador would be the kind of person that would do something like find a <br/>\nsecret that he could make pofit off of, then keep it to himself, but his <br/>\nfriend said he had no knowledge that Salvador had ever been making <br/>\ncollapsible fishing poles, or spy glasses. He also said it was very unlikely <br/>\nthat he could have found out the recipe also, since Salvador never was <br/>\ninterested in tinkering.
