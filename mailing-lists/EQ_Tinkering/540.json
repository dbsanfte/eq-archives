If you look beyond his flavored use of words and <br/>\n&gt;meaningless advice, he is no better... nothing more... then us, the people <br/>\n&gt;who instead of researching ourselves want the information handed to us... <br/>\n&gt;although we attempt some form of detective work, it is mainly the view of a <br/>\n&gt;bat... we look around blindly for the answer, however we still, deep down <br/>\n&gt;expect the answer to be handed to us through sound (word of mouth). My <br/>\n&gt;point is, if this was something that people wanted to keep secret, they <br/>\n&gt;would not let it leak to ppl such as &quot;Joshua Bednarz&quot; who brag about this <br/>\n&gt;so called knowledge on the Tinkering list itself... because this, this is <br/>\n&gt;how stuff gets leaked.. one person says something, which leads to someone <br/>\n&gt;else gaining the knowledge, and the never ending catalyist begins.

I know this book exists and to prove it I&#39;ll give you the one <br/>\n&gt;formula I was able to get out of the person who has it. animated bait -- 1 <br/>\n&gt;cork, 1 spricket. the only purpose I can find for this is practice for non <br/>\n&gt;gnomes since the two things cost much more than bait and it&#39;s trivial for a <br/>\n&gt;gnome. personally I think the book is in Solusek&#39;s eye, the tinkering <br/>\n&gt;merchant has to be there for some reason. I just hope we don&#39;t have to kill <br/>\n&gt;a gnome for it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Fixer gnomish enchanter<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 16<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 7 Sep 1999 20:43:54 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;dlobdell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dlobdell@...\">dlobdell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: EQ Emulator?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry off topic but:<br/>\n&gt;Could someone please tell me the URL to that everquest emulator that was <br/>\n&gt;posted about awhile ago.. not the one that was taken down, but the newer <br/>\n&gt;one...<br/>\n&gt;thanks+ACE-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wes Lobdell,<br/>\n&gt;Note: I&#39;m not a Mac person, but you have to admit, the following is <br/>\n&gt;funny+ACEAIQ- :) And if you don&#39;t +ACI-get+ACI- it, then I guess the media <br/>\n&gt;hasn&#39;t soaked it for all its worth yet after all...<br/>\n&gt;Quote: +ACI-Macintosh -- we might not get everything right, but<br/>\n&gt;atleast we knew the century was going to end.+ACI-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------<br/>\n&gt;My all time favorite Oxymorons:<br/>\n&gt;exact estimate, plastic silverware, genuine imitation, mud bath,   original <br/>\n&gt;copy, student teacher, alone together, anarchy rules, bitter sweet, <br/>\n&gt;bankrupt millionaire, black light, butt-head, casual sex, clean dirt, coed <br/>\n&gt;sorority, cold as hell, computer jock, constant change, cowardly lion, <br/>\n&gt;curved line(according to the mathematical  definition of a line),  <br/>\n&gt;delibrate mistake, dry wine, earth angel(ok thats just going back a ways <br/>\n&gt;+ADs-), educational television, even odds, found missing, freezer burn, <br/>\n&gt;fresh cheese, full-length bikini, half full, half naked, hard water, hells <br/>\n&gt;angels, idiot savant, jumbo shrimp, less is more, and finally my all time<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 17<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 7 Sep 1999 20:34:03 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Mathew Ganja&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ganja@...\">ganja@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Hello all this is a Wizzy that want&#39;s to help all ya.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok first like to say hi to all ya.

It turns out, the first guy I talked to was his friend, or used to<br/>\n&gt;be rather (they seem to have had a fight) He said Salvador hadn&#39;t been on<br/>\n&gt;for a long time, but he had been acting strange before he left. He said <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;Salvador would be the kind of person that would do something like find a<br/>\n&gt;secret that he could make pofit off of, then keep it to himself, but his<br/>\n&gt;friend said he had no knowledge that Salvador had ever been making<br/>\n&gt;collapsible fishing poles, or spy glasses. He also said it was very <br/>\n&gt;unlikely<br/>\n&gt;that he could have found out the recipe also, since Salvador never was<br/>\n&gt;interested in tinkering.
