They would be PETS nothing more,<br/>\n&gt; nothing less. Although they could be very POWERFUL pets, that would<br/>\n&gt; offset the fact that a MASTER TINKERER (MT) wouldn&#39;t have available to him<br/>\n&gt; the amenities of other classes that can have pets. MASTER TINKERERS<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have the ability to cast spells, although through their<br/>\n&gt; creations could approximate the effect of spells through their Tinkers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The issue of these things unbalancing the world through their sale<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t BE a factor because all that would have to be done is make the<br/>\n&gt; life of these Tinkers finite. Rebreathers and Aqualungs for example<br/>\n&gt; would disintegrate FASTER than they do now if not being used by a<br/>\n&gt; MASTER TINKERER. This would be due to an implied ability of the MT to<br/>\n&gt; perform the required maintenance on the objects he creates. (No ACTUAL<br/>\n&gt; maintenance would have to be performed mind you, just having the object<br/>\n&gt; in one&#39;s inventory would be enough to extend the life of a Tinker)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Aranathes Bonethrower [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aranathes@...\">aranathes@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 20, 2000 7:47 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Re: The Creation of Clockwork Machines<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heh, and the letter I sent in was just to improve the fireworks.  =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ghirardelli<br/>\n&gt; 48 necro - e&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Gazamel Prime&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gazamel@...\">gazamel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com\">EQ_Tinkering@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 20, 2000 7:12 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_Tinkering] Re: The Creation of Clockwork Machines<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I agree with much of what you have in this post.

Now, this is a low figure, as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; TEST server is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; down and its not a weekend, where most servers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; average more than 2000<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people at a time, and not 1600 as it is right now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This means Verant is Making the profit from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actual SALES of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Everquest AND at least FIVE-HUNDRED-THOUSAND dollars<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a month on top<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Figures taken from:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ... 50,000 people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...x $ 100 a year (assuming they pay PER six months<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and not per month)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ......÷ 12 months<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; $ 500,000 PER MONTH<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My point being this. If they are making so much damn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; money a month,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they can get off thier collective butts and do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tinkering.

This would work by keeping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tinkering a Gnome trait<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; available to ALL GNOMES, but those Gnomes that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; choose to become a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MASTER-TINKERER would have to coose to do so as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CLASS just like a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Magic-User has to choose what type of caster he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wants to be, a Gnome<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would have to choose between being a normal class of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gnome, or a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MASTER-TINKERER.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gnomes that do this would be able to create the more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; elaborate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tinkers such as the VLC&#39;s and VLH&#39;s and the more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sought-after pieces<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of equipment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are asking about the balance of having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; characters with Pet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Clockwork Dragons or Krackens&#39;, then remember. These<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MASTER-TINKERERS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to spend hundreds of plat just to earn the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SKILL to create these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; creatures, and then spend the time to collect the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pieces of these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; creatures (How many dragons do you think it would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; take to kill, just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to collect every single dragon piece? Thats a LOT of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WORK), and then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the pure plat and time to collect the pieces to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thier brainbox!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What if it fails? We are talking possibly 3-4 WEEKS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Real time in lost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Plat and Time, all in a blink of an eye.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, there would be lots of Clockwork rats and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiders, but who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cares? My Enchanter&#39;s First-level apparition can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; demolish those! Its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not like they would be the most sturdy of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Clockworks...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have taken the time to read this Very long<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Post,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please offer your opinion.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank-you for your time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Send instant messages with Yahoo!
